Diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella\n(MMR), and whooping cough were by far and away the major killers of human\nbeings until the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays, these diseases have been\ndramatically reduced or even eliminated in the Western world as a result of large-\nscale vaccination programs. The major goal of such vaccination programs is the\nmaintenance of the phenomenon of herd immunity, which occurs when a critical\nportion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease, the virus can no\nlonger circulate in the population, so that the disease cannot gain foothold in that\nsociety. Indeed, it is through herd immunity that large-scale vaccination programs\nare so much more effective than individual vaccination.\nA large majority of parents is convinced of the beneficial effect of vaccination on\nthe health of their children and voluntarily enroll their children in such programs.\nHowever, since the introduction of the first vaccination programs in the beginning\nof the 19th century, a myriad of groups of parents have refused to vaccinate their\nchildren. Traditionally, the most well-known objectors are members of religious\ngroups, predominantly Protestant Christian congregations, who argue that vaccin-\nation interferes with divine providence. In recent years, however, we can encounter\na growing modern anti-vaccination movement, which argues that the dangers of\nvaccinations far outweigh their benefits. Unlike the more religious groups that are\nprimarily inwardly oriented, this new anti-vaccination movement actively and suc-\ncessfully reaches out to new parents through anti-vaccination websites and TV\ncelebrities. An important factor here is the MMR vaccine causes autism controversy\na decade ago, in the wake of the publication of Andrew Wakefield's article in The\nBy now, Wakefield's claim has been fully debunked, The Lancet retracted his\narticle two years after its publication due to suspicions of fraud and the association\nof scientific interest with litigation-driven profit motives (Deer, 2011). As a result,\nWakefield has been stripped of his medical license and academic reputation. This\ncontroversy generated a huge industry of peer-reviewed research, none of which\ncould corroborate the alleged vaccination\u00adautism link (Jain et al., 2015; Taylor\net al., 2014). Still, the suggested vaccine\u00adautism link remains ``the most damaging\nreported in the media and went viral on anti-vaccination websites.\nAfter a long period in which the idea that vaccinations were beneficial and safe\ngained an ever-stronger foothold in western societies, this new movement heralded\na turning point in the public trust in vaccines. This renewed public questioning of\nvaccines has led to a decline in vaccination rates, which ultimately culminated in\nPhadke et al., 2016). This was the first major measles outbreak in a decade,\nwhich spread throughout the US and Mexico and caused the death of a woman\nin Washington State (Izadi, 2015).1 How should liberal\u00addemocratic governments\ndeal with such opposition to vaccination when it leads to compromised herd\nimmunity and the re-emerging risk of outbreaks of a disease that for decades\nwas assumed to be under control?2\nGiven their possible devastating effects, the state has a compelling interest in\npreventing (major) outbreaks of infectious diseases. Indeed, although it remains\ncontested whether the liberal state should promote public health through welfare\nstate institutions, it is undisputed that it should protect society against major\nthreats to public health. Fighting infectious diseases is generally considered to be\na classic government task. As part of that task several states legally require that\nchildren receive vaccinations against diseases like measles.\nAt the same time, many liberal political orders have endorsed a practice of rule-\nand-exemption as a way of dealing with legal obligations for morally sensitive\nissues--for example the exemption from compulsory military service for conscien-\ntious objectors. Childhood vaccination is a similarly sensitive issue: although a\nlarge majority of parents voluntarily consent to vaccination, a minority has\nstrong objections against the practice. Historically, these legal exemptions origi-\nnated as religious exemptions, available only to a very limited category of members\nof recognized religions. Over time, such exemptions became available to a wider\ncategory of parents, but up to today, many states explicitly distinguish religious\nfrom secular claims.\nThe issue of religious and secular exemptions has also gained considerable atten-\ntion in current liberal political theory. On what grounds can exemptions to general\nlaw be justified? Why should conscientious objections justify dispensation from\ndemocratically adopted and generally applicable laws? In addition, if legal exemp-\ntions should be granted, should they be limited to religious convictions or should\nthey also be granted to secular ``strong beliefs'' about the central importance and\nvalue of certain convictions, practices, and purposes? What feature of religion\nmakes it so special that it deserves protection from state interference?\nThis paper analyses exemptions to general law through the prism of the topical\nand highly relevant case study of vaccine waivers in the United States. Although\nthere is no federal regulation, all US states legally require the vaccination of\nchildren prior to school or daycare entry, but this requirement is accompanied\nwith a system of medical, religious, and/or philosophical exemptions. These exemp-\ntions became subject to scrutiny after it emerged that the Disneyland measles out-\nbreak was caused by substandard vaccination compliance due to high numbers of\nnonmedical exemptions. In reaction to the outbreak and the public outrage it\ngenerated, the state of California accepted a bill that eliminated all nonmedical\nexemptions. Besides California, legislators in other states have introduced bills that\nwould make it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinating their kids.3 Thus these\nexemptions, though for a long time virtually undisputed, have now become the\nsubject of intense public and political discussion.\nThis paper seeks to answer two questions. First, can legal exemptions from\nmandatory childhood vaccination schemes for parents who are opposed to\nvaccination (still) be justified? Second, should legal exemptions be limited to reli-\ngious objections to vaccination, or should they also be granted to parents with\nsecular objections? Although the argument in the paper starts from the US exam-\nple, it seeks to provide a more general philosophical reflection on the question of\nexemptions from mandatory childhood vaccination and, consequently, a more\ngeneral conclusion on exemptions in general. To focus the paper, I do not discuss\nmandatory childhood vaccination in general, but limit the argument to one disease,\nthe measles, due to the turmoil the Dinseyland outbreak generated and because it is\na ``pure'' example in this context. The measles is an extraordinarily contagious\ndisease; its effects are quite severe and outbreaks are common enough to pose a\nsignificant threat to public health. Moreover, over time the vaccine has proven to\nbe effective and safe. Finally, measles is a predominant example of a childhood\ndisease because the first vaccination must be administered long before the age of\nreason kicks in.4\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section two explains why mandatory child-\nhood vaccination is a necessity in currents days of vaccine hesitancy to maintain\nherd immunity. Section three conceptualizes legal exemptions in general, and sec-\ntion four discusses exemptions in the context of mandatory childhood vaccination.\nSections five (on free-riders) and six (on the distinction between religious and secu-\nlar objections) argue that it is impossible for liberal\u00addemocratic governments to\nsubstantially separate deeply held objections to vaccination from more superficial\npreferences. Section seven argues why an alternative approach, employing proxies\nto separate deeply held objections from more superficial preferences also fails.\nSection eight brings the various arguments together and concludes that a waiver\nsystem for mandatory childhood vaccination cannot be sustained: it either violates\nliberal\u00addemocratic tenets or it is incapable of limiting the number of exemptions in\norder to maintain robust herd immunity.\nJustifying mandatory vaccination: The maintenance\nof herd immunity\nThe measles is a dangerous childhood disease for which there is no curative\nmedicine; the only treatment available is prevention through vaccination.5 Once\ninfected, the patient has to endure the disease and during this period she is suscep-\ntible to various risks. Out of every 1000 individuals who become infected, one or\ntwo will die from the disease; approximately one will develop encephalitis (a swel-\nling of the brain that can lead to convulsions and leave the person deaf or with an\nintellectual disability) and as many as 50 get pneumonia. Even an ``uncomplicated''\ncourse of the measles results in a week with a high fever, cough, sore throat, and a\nrash covering the entire body.6 Moreover, the measles is unusually contagious: an\nunvaccinated person exposed has a 90% chance of becoming infected with the\ndisease.7 This implies that a patient is not only a victim of the disease, but also a\nvector in its further spread. Infected persons (can) infect others and contribute to\noutbreaks. As a consequence, the measles should not merely be discussed in terms\nof parent\u00adchild responsibilities, but primarily in terms of public health.\nVaccination reduces the number of potential hosts--and thus carriers--of the dis-\nease in the population. The higher the vaccination rate, the harder it is for a disease\nto spread. The threshold of herd immunity for measles is achieved at 92\u00ad94%, at\nAs such, herd immunity not only protects the vaccinated but also several cate-\ngories of persons who cannot be vaccinated for various medical reasons. The first\ncategory concerns infants and young children who have not yet completed the\nrecommended childhood immunization schedule. Newborn babies have maternally\nderived antibodies that protect them against the measles and other diseases. Over\ntime, however, the effect of these antibodies fades out and these children remain\nunprotected until their first vaccination. During this period, they can only be pro-\ntected through the vaccination of the persons around them. The second category\nconcerns persons for whom their vaccination turns out to be insufficiently effective\nbecause, in very rare cases, vaccinations do not mount an adequate immune\nresponse. There will always be a small percentage of vaccinated persons who\nremain unprotected; however, it is unclear who these individuals are until they\nget infected. The third category of persons concerns those who cannot undergo\nvaccination because they have certain forms of cancer, have a compromised\nimmune system, or are likely to suffer from a serious allergic reaction.\nHerd immunity thus not only protects individual vaccinated persons against the\ndisease, it provides a higher-order societal protection because it prevents diseases\nfrom breaking out altogether. In that sense it is an important collective good and a\nmajor contribution to public health. Vaccinating healthy toddlers protects them\nfrom falling ill and prevents them from becoming vectors in the further spread of\nthe disease. This is the main reason why countries like the US have endorsed\nmandatory vaccination programs in order to guarantee sufficiently high vaccin-\nation levels that protect the safety of vulnerable co-members of society who\ncannot protect themselves. Moreover, we have arrived at a point in time where\nwe can conclude that there can be no genuine controversy on the risks of vaccin-\nation any more.8 A recent meta-analysis concluded that, after the administration of\nover 25 million vaccine doses, 33 cases of vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis, a poten-\ntially life-threatening allergic reaction, were confirmed (McNeil et al., 2016). Other\nresearch arrives at a similar conclusion: ``there is evidence that some vaccines are\nassociated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare\nand must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide''\nThe state has a compelling interest in preventing (major) outbreaks of infectious\ndiseases. The only way in which such outbreaks can be prevented is through the\nmaintenance of robust herd immunity, and the only way herd immunity can be\nachieved is through mass vaccination. Until recently, outbreaks of the measles\nseemed abstract and remote in the western world. In that context it could seem\nto be an excessive use of governmental power to propose mandatory childhood\nvaccination. However, recent outbreaks have provided parents and the public with\nfirsthand experience of the reality of these diseases and their harmful impact. When\nherd immunity cannot be taken for granted because of a growing vaccine denial-\nism, the question arises whether a system of exemptions from mandatory childhood\nvaccination laws can be maintained.\nConceptualizing legal exemptions\nMany liberal states have a cherished tradition of rule-and-exemption approaches\nas a way of dealing with legal obligations for morally sensitive issues. The most\nwell-known example is that of exemption from compulsory military service for\nconscientious objectors.9 Mandatory childhood vaccination is a similarly sensitive\nissue. As discussed in the previous section, states have a compelling interest in\npreventing (major) outbreaks of infectious diseases and this has led certain states\nto implement mandatory childhood vaccination programs. A case in point is the\nUnited States. Although there is no federal regulation, all 50 states legally require\nvaccination of children prior to school or daycare entry. At the same time, this legal\nduty is accompanied with a system of exemptions. Three states \u00ad Mississippi, West\nVirginia, and (since 30 June 2015) California \u00ad only accept medical exemptions, e.g.\nonly for children who are immunocompromised, those who have allergic reactions\nto vaccine constituents, and those who have a moderate or severe illness. All other\nstates also offer non-medical exemptions: 28 states accept religious exemptions and\n19 states offer religious and secular exemptions.10\nHow should the accommodation of exemptions be judged in the context of\nconstitutional liberal democracies? At first sight, allowing exemptions seems to\ncontradict a basic requirement of the idea of constitutional democracy. After all,\nclear application of the law, equal treatment, and the rule of law are paramount;\nlaw ought to be administered impartially and should have no favorites (Barry,\nfacially neutral laws could nevertheless be disproportionally burdensome for\ncertain citizens. Even though most parents comply voluntarily with the duty to\nvaccinate, some parents vehemently object to the practice. Mandatory vaccination\nimplies that these parents have to go against their conscience or have to sacrifice\ndeep commitments. And even though most other citizens do not share these\nconvictions--or might even disagree with the convictions--they might nevertheless\nunderstand the importance of these convictions for the individual person, and the\npain it would inflict upon parents if they have to act against their deepest\ncommitments.\nThe question, then, is when universal application of law is paramount and under\nwhich circumstances exemptions should prevail. This is also a central question in\ncurrent political\u00adtheoretical debates on legal exemptions. So-called muscular\nliberals rally around the idea of universal egalitarian law and argue that law, as\nthe outcome of democratic deliberation and political processes should, in principle,\nbe administered impartially and be binding on all. Barry's Culture and Equality\n(2001) is the notorious placeholder for this position. On the other hand,\nmore tolerance-leaning liberals see legal exemptions to universal laws as the con-\ntemporary interpretation of the ancient-old liberal ideal of toleration (Dobbernack\nthat a blanket application of state law sometimes unduly burdens citizens who\ndeeply disagree with the law because it contradicts squarely their conscience and\ndeepest convictions. Allowing exemptions recognizes this fact by alleviating the\nparticular burden of the members of these minority groups.\nThis paper does not aim to take a firm theoretical position in this more abstract\npolitical\u00adtheoretical debate.11 I think that the idea of accommodation is, ipso facto,\nnot inconsistent with the central tenets of constitutional liberal democracy,\nespecially in cases in which granting exemptions does not directly violate the\nfundamental rights of others.12 The fact that herd immunity can be maintained at\na vaccination rate of 92\u00ad94% implies that there might be some room for exemptions\nfrom mandatory vaccination without endangering public health and the rights of\nothers. I agree with Mahoney (2011: 311) that government should seek to accom-\nmodate minority practices in the most generous manner possible. We should be\nclear, though, what kind of right this is. It is not a straightforward and inviolable\nright of parents that nullifies the duty to vaccinate; instead, it is a toleration-based\nand conditional right to an exemption from a general legal duty, which can, and\nshould, be revoked at the moment robust herd immunity is endangered.\nIn what follows, I accept that legal exemptions are, in principle, legitimate in\nliberal\u00addemocratic states, but that we should be sure that such exemptions are\njustified, all things considered, in two respects. First normatively: allowing exemp-\ntions should not collide with other central liberal\u00addemocratic values. Secondly,\nexemptions should be feasible practically: government agencies should be able to\ndistinguish sincere objections against vaccination from so-called exemptions of\nconvenience (Calandrillo, 2004), and they should be able to make this distinction\nby employing relatively straightforward legal norms. Narrowing down this\napproach to the subject of this paper: the first-order priority of government\npolicy is to maintain and protect robust herd immunity. The second-order priority\nis to allow for exemptions if, and only if, they are feasible, both normatively and\npractically. Given these priorities, can a waiver system for mandatory childhood\nvaccination against the measles be maintained?\nExemptions from mandatory vaccination\nThe US waiver system for mandatory childhood vaccination became the subject of\npublic and political dispute after the notorious 2015 Disneyland measles outbreak,\nespecially when it became clear that the outbreak resulted from substandard vac-\ncination compliance, which was caused by the high number of parents having\nreceived nonmedical exemptions (Colgrove and Lowin, 2016: 349; Majumder\net al., 2015: E1).13 As a result, the Disneyland outbreak brought to the fore\nwhat was discussed longer in academic circles, namely, that most US states provide\nexemptions in a very generous, and rather unprincipled way. In theory, exemptions\nshould only be given to a limited and very specific set of parents with genuine\nobjections to vaccination. In practice, however, opting out of vaccination turned\nout to be remarkably simple. In a large number of states parents can forgo vac-\ncinations by simply ticking a box on a pre-printed form, no questions asked. In\naddition, the vast majority of states do not enforce any limitations on exemptions,\nas 32 of 48 states that allow exemptions have not denied a single claim (Calandrillo,\n2004: 434). This lenient way of enforcing mandatory vaccination law did little to\nstop the rising vaccine hesitancy that endangered herd immunity and increased the\nDisease Control and Prevention found that most states failed to reach the target\nof having 95% of children entering kindergarten complete the two-dose MMR\nvaccine sequence--in the state of Colorado even less than 85% had received\nboth doses of MMR (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).\nThe Disneyland outbreak led to an outpour of public indignation over the\nirresponsible behavior of non-vaccinating parents and the risks they present to pub-\nlic health. Popular media ironically emphasized that vaccination rates in wealthy\nLos Angeles schools were as low as in South Sudan (Khazan, 2014). In reaction to\nthe outbreak, the state of California discussed Senate Bill 277 to eliminate all\nnonmedical exemptions. The proposal led, predictably, to heated opposition by\nopponents but was in the end accepted by a significant margin in the State\nLegislature (Nagourney, 2015). An initiative to a referendum to overturn the Bill\nfell (far) short of the number of signatures needed to put the issue on the ballot\nremoves philosophical exemption and requires those seeking religious exemptions\nto review evidence-based educational material regarding immunizations. In June\n2015, the American Medical Association explicitly endorsed stringent state immun-\nization requirements to only allow exemptions for medical reasons, and legislators\nand public health professionals in nearly 30 other states are similarly working to get\nsuch reforms passed.14 At the same time, however, similar attempts in Oregon and\nWashington have failed--at least for the moment.\nHowever, the fact that too many states have handed out exemptions too easily in\nthe last decade, does not imply that a waiver system is, ipso facto, doomed to fail.\nAs I will conclude later in this article, though, it might be an indication that such\nregulations are very hard--if not impossible--to implement in practice. Such a\nrule-and-exemption scheme can only be successfully implemented when (at least)\nthree conditions are met. First, only a relatively small subset of persons should\nhave objections to the duty as prescribed by law (Vallier, 2016). After all, allowing\nexemptions should not undermine or nullify the goal for which the specific legal\nduty is introduced. This implies that the large majority of citizens must have suf-\nficient reason to endorse and abide by the law. Second, government agencies should\nbe able to distinguish sincere deep objections from exemptions of convenience by\nrelatively straightforward legal norms. And, thirdly, given the limited number of\nexemptions available, the distribution of this scarce good should not violate basic\nnotions of justice.\nApplied to a waiver system for mandatory childhood vaccination, we can trans-\nlate these conditions in the following way. The first-order priority is to maintain\nand protect robust herd immunity, which implies that the number of exemptions\nshould be limited. The second-order priority is that the process of distinguishing\nsincere objections from exemptions of convenience should not violate central lib-\neral values by, for example, undermining state neutrality, the secular character of\nlaw, or by privileging or discriminating against certain religious or other compre-\nhensive doctrines.15 Only if these two priorities are met, a mandatory vaccination\nscheme with waivers is feasible.\nThe aim of vaccination policies is to protect all persons against infectious\ndiseases, but this does not require that all persons have to be vaccinated.\nAs mentioned above, herd immunity requires an overall vaccination coverage of\n92\u00ad94%, which implies that a limited practice of non-vaccination of 6\u00ad8% can be\naccommodated without sacrificing the rights of others, that is, the right of citizens\nto be protected against outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Since the risk of\nnon-vaccination is cumulative in nature, herd immunity can be sustained, even if a\ncertain percentage of parents refrain from vaccination.\nHowever, the question remains how much room this leaves in practice for\nnonmedical exemptions. Firstly, a certain proportion of the 6\u00ad8% will consist of\npersons who are not (yet) protected for medical reasons, as described in section\ntwo: infants too young to be vaccinated, persons for whom the vaccination turns\nout to be insufficiently effective, and those who cannot undergo vaccination. There\nare good public health arguments to prioritize these medical exemptions over\nnon-medical exemptions.\nSecondly, even though it might be possible to achieve the average threshold\nvaccination rate in society overall, vaccination coverage is never spread evenly\nover the territory. Societies usually contain certain risk clusters in which vac-\ncination rates fall below the level required to maintain herd immunity.\nThe Dutch and US bible-belt, for example, are well known for harboring under-\nvaccinated religious communities. This is a reflection of the more general phenom-\nenon that people who share religious beliefs that object to vaccination will usually\nlive in close proximity to each other and will have much interaction through\nchurches, schools, and communal life (May and Silverman, 2003; Omer et al.,\nTo sum up: the first-order priority is to prevent outbreaks, which requires robust\nstate-wide herd immunity. This implies that the average vaccination rate must thus\nbe higher than the standard 92\u00ad94% threshold to also assure herd immunity in\npockets of under-vaccination. Moreover, a relatively large proportion of the\nexemptions are already taken up by the medical exemptions mentioned above\n(newborn babies, those who cannot undergo vaccination for medical reasons).\nThus, although herd immunity for measles permits 6\u00ad8% of the population not\nto be vaccinated, the percentage thereof that can be allocated to non-medical\nexemptions is considerably smaller. This makes it even more urgent to restrict\nthe number of non-medical exemptions.\nLimiting the numbers of nonmedical exemptions:\nKeeping out free riders\nIn order to limit the number of nonmedical exemptions, sincere objections against\nvaccination must be separated from exemptions of convenience. Before we can\ndiscuss more fine-grained arguments concerning religious and nonreligious exemp-\ntions, first we have to address the more mundane subject of free riders. As men-\ntioned above, herd immunity is a collective good and, as such, it has two important\ncharacteristics. Firstly, it is non-excludable, that is, once achieved, it is impossible to\nexclude people from using the collective good. Herd immunity protects vaccinated\nand non-vaccinated persons alike. Second, a collective good is non-rivalrous, that is,\none person's use of it does not limit the use of others. These characteristics of\ncollective goods open the door to free riding: persons benefiting from a collective\nprovision like herd immunity without contributing to the maintenance of the public\ngood. As long as herd immunity is firmly established, children of vaccinating and\nnon-vaccinating parents are equally protected against the disease, and this can\nexplain the incentive to free ride. For one thing, taking one's kid to the doctor\nfor a vaccination disrupts the daily routine for which one might have to take a\nmorning off from work. And knowing that kids are always slightly feverish for a\nnight or two after a vaccination, it seems rational to seek for such an exemption of\nconvenience.16 Since vaccinations are not provided free of charge by the US gov-\nernment,17 in some states it requires less effort to request an exemption than to\nfulfill the vaccination requirements (Salmon et al., 2006: 439). In addition, even\nthough the standard vaccines like MMR have proven to be very safe, there is no\nsuch thing as a 100% risk-free medical intervention. It is inevitable that adverse\nreactions will occur in some cases, even when all reasonable precautions are taken\nin the manufacture and delivery of vaccinations. The great majority of side effects\nare local and minor--a sore arm or low-grade fever for a few days. As discussed\nabove, more serious reactions to vaccines occur only in exceedingly rare circum-\nstances, but still it is rational for parents to wish to avoid them, if possible, if one\ncan assume herd immunity to be maintained by others.\nHowever, free riding is, of course, inherently self-defeating: the more parents\nfollow suit, the more herd immunity will be endangered and the more a waiver\nsystem is unsustainable. Some anti-vaccinators are very aware that their free ride\ncan only be guaranteed as long as herd immunity is maintained by others. Dr Bob\n(Sears), a well-known US anti-vaccination celebrity, is blatantly honest in his\nadvice to non-vaccinating patients: ``I also warn them not to share their fears\nwith their neighbors, because if too many people avoid the MMR vaccine, we'll\nlikely see the disease increase significantly'' (Sears, 2007: 96\u00ad97, as quoted in Navin,\nNeedless to say, the putative immorality of free riding in this case is clear.\nIndeed, it is quite hard to justify the choice of parents to make use of a collective\ngood that they value, but refuse to contribute their fair share to its maintenance.\nHowever, morally condemning the concept of free riding is one thing; it is quite\nanother thing to come up with legal tools that capture the distinction between free\nriders from conscious objectors in workable legal criteria. Free riders know that\ntheir behavior is objectionable and are therefore not very likely to admit that they\nare free riding. They either follow Dr Bob or seek to hide the fact that they do not\nvaccinate, or present their refusal in terms of a conscientious objection and apply\nfor philosophical or religious exemptions.\nThis demonstrates the first epistemic problem with waiver programs. They not\nonly provide room for genuine grievances against vaccination but also for less-\ngenuine free-rider behavior because free riders are forced to present their exemp-\ntion\u00adclaim in terms of genuine grievances, in order to be taken into consideration.\nIt is precisely this behavior that disables laws and formal regulations to make a\nstraightforward distinction between exemption claims based on genuine objections\nand exemptions of convenience.\nSeparating religious and secular objections\nSince the introduction of the first smallpox vaccines, several groups of parents have\nrefused to vaccinate their children. Traditionally, the most well-known objectors\nare members of religious groups. For example, Dutch Protestant\u00adChristian con-\ngregations refuse vaccination because they consider it contrary to their religious\nconvictions. They believe that God has predestined the fate of all human beings,\nincluding their health and the prevalence of diseases. They might not necessarily\ndeny the effectiveness of large-scale vaccinations programs, but nevertheless pri-\noritize other values, and conclude that vaccination is an ``inappropriate meddling\nin the work of God.'' In the US, we find religious groups including Christian\nScientists, Mennonites, and the Amish of which certain members also object to\nvaccination. For example, some Christian Scientists argue that disease is a spiritual\nphenomenon that should be healed through prayer instead of medication. They\nrefuse vaccines because they believe that physical illness is an illusion of the mater-\nial world and that prayer can help us to correct the false beliefs that give rise to\nillness.\nThese more traditional religiously inspired objectors to vaccination should be\ndistinguished from the current, more secular wave of vaccine hesitancy, which\nprimarily mobilizes parents and activists who are convinced that the risks of\nvaccination outweigh the purported benefits.18 In the last three decades, a vocal\nanti-vaccination movement has emerged, which conveys its message primarily\nthrough anti-vaccination websites. This is a multifaceted movement, including\n``spiritual'' or ``holistic'' approaches, anthroposophists, homeopaths, and\nadherents of ``natural healing'' and ``alternative healing.'' They dispute the medical\nconsensus that vaccines are safe and effective; moreover, they question the self-\nevidence with which governments provide and promote large-scale vaccination\nprograms. Some believe that a disease like measles could--in the case of otherwise\nhealthy children--contribute to growth, development, and immunity building,\nwhich provide someone with greater resilience against diseases like cancer\nand allergies later in life. Others seek to carve out ``all-natural'' lives for their\nchildren, to maintain their ``purity,'' or avoid contamination, assuming that vac-\ncines contain toxic preservatives. Still others argue that current programs over-\nwhelm a child's immune system because it is forced to handle too many vaccines\ntoo early in life. Even though none of these claims has been corroborated by\nevidence-based academic research, such groups are usually not bothered by that\nlack of scientific confirmation. To the contrary: the anti-vaccination movement\nis typically characterized by an aversion to ``mainstream medical science''\nShould religious objections have more weight in such debates than secular objec-\ntions? Again, the development in the US jurisprudence on the waiver system can\nhelp us to make sense of the distinction.19 Historically, the number of exemptions\ngranted was limited because only a limited category was eligible: members of\nnationally recognized and established religious denominations. In 1971, several\nstate courts widened the domain of exemptions ``to everyone and anyone who\nclaims a sincerely held religious belief opposed to vaccination--and not just\nthose emanating from officially recognized religions.''20 Only in 1979 was this limi-\ntation to religion disputed in court, because religious exemptions ``discriminate\nagainst the great majority of children whose parents have no such religious\nconvictions.''\nIt makes sense to lift the distinction between religious and secular claims for\nexemptions, because it does not fit with current, more secular ideals that govern-\nments should be neutral toward various (religious and secular) ideas of the good\nlife (Pierik and Van der Burg, 2014). Moreover, the original distinction led to many\nodd exceptions. For example, although many secular claims were not even taken\ninto consideration, an exemption claimed by a Jewish parent was allowed by a US\ncourt, even though nothing in Judaism objects to vaccinations (Calandrillo, 2004:\n414, n 388). Another example is the fact that thousands of parents have qualified\nfor religious exemptions by joining sham mail-order religions such as the\nCongregation of Universal Wisdom, through a contribution of $75 and a $15 fee\nfor the official notification necessary to qualify for the exemption.21\nIndeed, it is difficult for lawmakers and courts to come up with formal law and\ncogent court decisions to distinguish religious from more secular commitments\nbecause these commitments are typically insulated from ordinary standards of\nevidence and rational justification as employed in common sense and science\n(Leiter, 2013: 34). It is the religion, or the non-theistic equivalent in question\nthat determines which commitments are legitimate causes for an exemption, not\nsecular lawmakers or state judges (Macklem, 2008: 133). It is therefore quite an\nendeavor, if not impossible, for a liberal government to come up with a clear set of\ncoherent conditions to separate legitimate, deep commitments from superficial\npreferences, and remain neutral to the various religious and secular philosophies\nof life.\nMore generally, the growing focus on state neutrality and secular law in the last\ndecades affects the way such claims to exemptions are assessed. The more secular\nthe assessment of exemption claims becomes, the harder it is to distinguish religious\nfrom secular convictions and, more importantly, to distinguish ``strong beliefs''\nfrom ``mere preferences.'' Within the liberal tradition, one that is so much deter-\nmined by inter-Christian strife in Europe after the Reformation, such strong beliefs\nand the mere concepts of ``conscience'' and ``conscientious objections'' were limited\nto the--indeed quite contingent category of--members of nationally recognized\nand established religious Christian denominations and very much understood in\ncurrent, more secular, times, we need a more inclusive conception of the ``strong\nbeliefs'' and ``deep commitments'' that provides normative status to convictions\nthat individuals closely identify with and recognize as theirs, on the grounds of\ntheir ``deep,'' ``serious,'' ``spiritual'' nature. After all, it is because these religious\nand secular commitments meet the criterion of deep commitments that they justify\nexemptions from universal law.22\nThe transition to a more inclusive approach can be recognized in the way US and\nEU courts have assessed such claims. The European Court of Human Rights never\nprovided a comprehensive definition of the term ``religion'' or ``belief.'' Mainstream\nreligions are readily accepted as belief systems. For other religions and personal\nbelief systems, the Court merely employs formal criteria: the conviction must display\n``a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion, and importance.''23 The latter\nterms have never been spelled out in case law, but Murdoch (2007: 11) explains\nthat a specific act, i.e. objecting to vaccination, must relate to a weighty and sub-\nstantial aspect of human life and behavior and be deemed worthy of protection in\nEuropean democratic society.24 But nothing in these formulations separates reli-\ngious from secular convictions. In United States v. Seeger, the US Supreme Court\nhas, in matters of conscientious objection to military service, abandoned the\nreligious/secular distinction by holding that an objection could be understood as\n``religious'' when it is based on a ``sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the\nlife of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those.''25 Following\nthis jurisprudence, it is remarkable that several US states still only accept religious\nexemptions and deny secular exemptions; one would expect the distinction to col-\nlapse as soon as a secular parent in one of these states will make the case before the\nSupreme Court. However, it turns out that Seeger was an exception because the\nSupreme Court was interpreting the narrow terms of a statute rather than addressing\nthe constitutional question of what should count as protected belief for purposes of\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. As a result, judges have been\nreluctant to extend the constitutional protection of nonreligious deep, serious, moral\ncommitments beyond narrowly circumscribed cases of conscientious objection to\nFor liberal governments to comply with the contemporary demands of state\nneutrality--and for the US government to comply with the free exercise clause\nof the first amendment--the earlier theistic and substantial interpretation of the\nterm ``religious'' must be abandoned and replaced by a more inclusive and formal\none (Navin, forthcoming). This is also clear when we analyze the myriad of claims\nto exemptions from childhood vaccination today. Should modern objectors who,\nin one spiritual way or another, still adhere to Wakefield's debunked claim that\nvaccination causes autism be treated differently from Christians who argue that\nvaccination is an inappropriate meddling in the work of God, or from those who\nargue that diseases should be healed through prayer instead of medication, or from\nmetaphysical thinkers who argue that vaccines undermine ``purity'' or hamper\n``spiritual growth of the person?'' Yes, the former is based on a factual claim\nthat contradicts evidence-based medicine, while the latter cannot be refuted scien-\ntifically, but this is, ipso facto, not sufficient as a criterion that can be employed by\na neutral state for distinguishing the two claims, or to conclude that one justifies an\nexemption while the other does not.\nHere the attempt to make meaningful distinctions between on the one hand,\nexemption\u00adclaims based on religious objections and secular objections and on the\nother hand, between sincere objections and mere exemptions of convenience, seem\nto end up in a free fall. The more law, policy, and adjudication have to rely on\nformal criteria like sincerity, cogency, or cohesion, the more a waiver system com-\nplies with the second-order priority, in that it does not privilege or discriminate\nagainst certain religious or other comprehensive doctrines. But when that distinc-\ntion falls apart, it is also much harder to separate sincere objections from free-rider\nclaims disguised as sincere objections. This, in turn, makes it much harder to fulfill\nthe first-order priority: that a waiver system must be capable of limiting the number\nof exemptions to such an extent that herd immunity is not jeopardized. The more\ncategories of exemption\u00adclaimers are acknowledged, the larger the number of\n(potential) claimants. If a liberal government aims to maintain herd immunity\nand if there is no neutral way of distinguishing insurmountable objections to\nvaccination from more superficial preferences, it will become impossible to\ndesign a waiver system that is both neutral to the several religions and secular\nideas about the good life, as well as to be able to maintain robust herd immunity.\nEmploying proxies\nIn the previous section, I concluded that it is very hard to substantively identify\ngenuine objections to vaccination and, consequently, to design law and policies to\ndistinguish genuine objections from exemptions of convenience. One way to hold\non to a waiver system is to give up the attempt to substantively assess parental\nconvictions, but instead, to employ proxies to determine who can legitimately claim\nexemptions. The alternative service for objectors to the military service can serve as\nan example here. Recognized objectors have to contribute to the public good in\nanother way, for example, by serving in educational or health care institutions. In\naddition, the alternative service usually takes a longer period than the military\nservice, up to twice as long, in order to deter non-sincere objectors from taking\nthe alternative route. In our case of exemptions from vaccination, a similar path\ncan be taken. Vaccinating one's children contributes to the public good--it gener-\nates herd immunity--and is burdensome to the parents and the child. Alternative\ntrajectories for vaccine objectors should contribute in a different way to the public\ngood and/or should at least, in one way or another, be as onerous for parents as\ngoing through the vaccination procedure, in order to cut off the easy way out of\nvaccination. The question is to what extent such an approach can comply with the\nrequirements formulated above: the first-order priority, limiting the number of\nexemptions in order to maintain and protect robust herd immunity; and the\nsecond-order priority, that the process of assigning exemptions should not privilege\nor discriminate against certain religious or other comprehensive doctrines.\nLet me discuss three possible proxies. In the first, parents are required to follow\na certain procedure before they are eligible for a vaccine waiver: to complete a set\nof educational sessions and to present their substantive opposition to vaccination\nbefore a formal review board. In this approach, the content of the objection is not\nsubstantially assessed; it is only marginally evaluated on whether it satisfies some\nbasic formal requirements in order to entitle an exemption from mandatory vac-\ncination. The basic idea is that, even though there is no substantive assessment of\ntheir actual arguments, the procedure forces parents to inform themselves about\nthe dangers of non-vaccination, to formulate their objections against vaccination\nexplicitly, and to defend them in a formal setting. Even though undergoing this\nprocedure might not substantially alter the parents' beliefs about vaccination, at\nleast it would make it harder for parents to forgo vaccination without being con-\nfronted with information on the possible dangers involved. Moreover, it would\nmake the process of receiving a waiver more burdensome, which might at least\ndeter some free riders.\nA second proxy moves away from the problematic distinction between sincere\nobjections and mere preferences by starting from an amoral conception of the\npublic good of herd immunity in a specific community. It argues that, since herd\nimmunity is such an essential public good, that all members of society can be\nexpected to contribute. The most obvious contribution is to vaccinate one's chil-\ndren (and oneself). Those with objections to vaccinations have to contribute in\nanother way to the public good, for example through paying a tax, for example\nfinancing vaccination schemes and to support vaccinations for low-income families.\nOne advantage is that such a tax is much less intrusive and might therefore be more\nacceptable for those with religious or philosophical objections. A second advantage\nis that such an approach avoids the problem of assessing the true nature and depth\nof the objection. Your willingness-to-pay is taken as a proxy for the depth of your\nobjection, and given the difficulty of determining sincere conscientious objections,\nwillingness-to-pay might be the most neutral alternative. The level of taxation\nshould yield at least the same burden as participating in a vaccination schedule--to\nmake sure that opting out is not less burdensome than participating. Perhaps the\ncharge could be based on the expected damage, according to the polluter pays-\nprinciple. Another calculation method links the tax rate to the extent to which herd\nimmunity is assured in a certain area. If the number of objectors within a specific\ncommunity is small, the tax rate can be low, only covering the administrative fee\nrequired to uphold the system of exemptions, monitoring levels of herd immunity\nand possible outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, the larger the number\nof objectors in a specific area, the more the tax rate will rise. Above the threshold\npercentage to maintain herd immunity, some objectors have to lose out.\nWillingness-to-pay could, in a way, be the most neutral way to separate the\nwheat from the chaff.\nLotteries might provide a third proxy. Stone (2011) argues that lotteries\nare appropriately employed when it is essential to prevent bad reasons from\naffecting decisions about allocation of a certain good. If we conclude from the\ndiscussion in the previous section that it is impossible to substantially distinguish\nsincere objections from superficial preferences by relatively straightforward legal\nnorms, we could distribute exemptions among parents who seek them through a\nlottery.\nThese proxies have the advantage that government is discharged from the\nimpossible task of substantially assessing the content or the depth of an objection\nagainst vaccination. But all three proxies have their own problems. The first proxy\nmight not provide enough of a barrier to exemption claims in order to secure\nrobust herd immunity (first-order priority). After all, if parents know they only\nhave to meet formal requirements but are in the end not assessed substantially, they\nknow they just have to go through the motions to succeed. In addition, this proxy\nseems to be biased in favor of educated people, for whom it will be easier to\nformulate their substantive opposition than for less-educated people (second-\norder priority). The second tax-proxy might have the ability to limit the number\nof exemptions by raising the tax to the threshold level, but it has the disadvantage\nthat it is biased in favor of wealthier people (second-order priority). In an unequal\nsociety, a tax may not distinguish sincere from convenient objections, but rather\npick out who is able to pay. If the tax is low, then we have done nothing to block\nthe worries about exemptions of convenience for the better-off. If the tax is high,\nthen only the well-off will be able to apply for exemptions. To the extent that we\nconsider the current socio-economic inequality unjust, this proxy only reinforces\nthese injustices. Moreover, it might be considered as insulting--buying one's right\nto follow one's conscience. The third lottery proxy has the disadvantage that it, in\nitself, does not solve the problem of free riding since every parent can subscribe to\nthe lottery. As such it suffers from a reverse version of the second-order priority: is\ndoes not distinguish between groups that are relevantly different. Moreover, it does\nnot take seriously the depth of the objections to vaccination. Genuine objectors\nseek for an exemption because they want their convictions to be taken seriously,\nnot because they have won a lottery. As such it might provide exemptions to people\nwith deep objections, but in such an insulting way that it will be despised and, as a\nresult, maybe even rejected by persons with deep objections.\nConclusion\nThis paper discussed religious and secular exemptions to general law through the\nprism of waivers for mandatory childhood vaccination for the measles. Given that\nthe measles is an extraordinarily contagious and quite severe disease and, given the\nfact that outbreaks are common enough to pose a significant threat to public\nhealth, government has a compelling interest in preventing outbreaks of vaccine-\npreventable contagious disease through maintaining robust herd immunity. The\npaper focused on legal regimes with mandatory measles vaccination schemes and\ndiscussed whether religious and secular exemptions can be maintained. The argu-\nment started from the idea that legal exemptions might ipso facto not be inconsist-\nent with the central tenets of constitutional liberal democracy, but that they can\nonly be accommodated when they are justified, all things considered, both from\nnormative and practical perspectives. These conditions were translated into two\npriorities: the first-order priority that allowing such exemptions should not endan-\nger robust herd immunity and the second-order priority that the distribution of this\nscarce good of exemptions should not violate central liberal\u00addemocratic values.\nA mandatory vaccination scheme with waivers is only justified when these two\nconditions can be met.\nSince herd immunity against the measles only requires an average vaccination\nrate of 92\u00ad94%, the first-order priority leaves some leeway for exemptions.\nHowever, since the vaccination coverage is spread unevenly over the territory\nand since a large proportion of the exemptions are already taken up by medical\nexemptions, the question is how much room the first-order priority leaves for non-\nmedical religious and secular exemptions. Concerning the second-order priority:\nwhere earlier arrangements, only providing exemptions to members of nationally\nrecognized and established religious denominations, might have very been very\nsuccessful in limiting the number of exemptions, this came at the expense of privi-\nleging the claims of certain groups over others. After all, the exempted category\nwas not selected on the basis of the content of their objections, but because they\nwere well established as religious--read Christian--groups in the US society. Given\nthe great importance that is given nowadays to state neutrality and secular law,\nsuch a selective approach is outdated. A more egalitarian analysis of exemptions\nshould be neutral to the various ideas of the good life--religious and secular--and\nshould not privilege religious groups merely because they are historically well\nestablished in a specific society. Such a more inclusive approach makes it impos-\nsible to separate religious from secular objections to vaccination, which is also\nexemplified by the fact that the European Court of Human Rights and the US\nSupreme court have abandoned substantive assessments of objections in favor of\nmore formal criteria like sincerity, cogency, or cohesion.\nBut once the assessment in terms of substantial criteria has been abandoned, it\nbecomes quite difficult to exclude many of the current secular convictions that are\nemployed to object to vaccination. After all, most of them are not merely objec-\ntions to vaccination, but, instead, embedded in wider religious, spiritual, or holistic\nideas of the good life. As such, not only does the distinction between religious and\nsecular objections collapse, but the distinction between genuine and less genuine\nfree-rider objections might dissolve as well. After all, since free riders are forced to\npresent their objections in terms of genuine grievances in order to be taken into\nconsideration, it will be very hard to design law and policies that can straightfor-\nwardly make the distinction between those objections that warrant exemptions,\nand those that do not.\nThis leads to a paradox for liberal\u00addemocratic exemption policies for mandatory\nchildhood vaccination law: it seems to be impossible to satisfy the first-order pri-\nority and second-order priority simultaneously. Either the number of categories of\nobjectors must be limited (and this can only be done by privileging some ideas of\nthe good life over others thus violating the second-order priority) or the policy of\naccepting categories of objectors is neutral. However, that would most probably\nendanger robust herd immunity because it would open the door to too many\nexemption claims. This leads to the conclusion that it is very difficult to maintain\nvaccine waivers for the measles that are consistent with central liberal\u00addemocratic\ntenets and that are also able to maintain robust herd immunity.\n"
