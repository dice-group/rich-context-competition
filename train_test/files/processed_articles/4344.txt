    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study attempted to understand street harassment as experienced by young women in Delhi. Interviews were conducted\nwith 20 women between the ages of 18 and 30 years to understand the nature of harassment they faced, its perceived\nconsequences, their ways of coping with it, and the changes they felt were needed for them to feel safer. Findings revealed that\nharassment occurred most often in crowded spots and in broad daylight. High levels of harassment were attributed to factors\nlike prevalent attitudes toward women and weak implementation of laws. Participants saw their lives as being restricted in\nseveral ways by the harassment. The police was seen as apathetic, and women took on themselves the responsibility for\nstaying safe. Sometimes, women chose to defend themselves by moving away from harassers rather than confronting them\ndue to fear of escalation. However, several participants felt that staying quiet allowed the perpetuation of harassment. The\nmajor change that women sought was more effective police functioning.\n",

A report on crimes against women in India by\nthe National Crimes Records Bureau shows that 8,233 cases\nof dowry deaths, 38,262 cases of kidnapping and abduction,\nalone(National Crime Records Bureau Ministry of Home\nAffairs,2012). It must be kept in mind that the actual number\nof criminal offenses committed against women is far higher\nthan these statistics reveal. Many crimes, in particular those\nthat involve sexual violence remain vastly underreported due\nto a variety of reasons including shame, stigma, the fear of\nretaliation, insensitivity of the police, long and complicated\nlegal procedures, low conviction rates and an overarching\nculture of impunity. Even a cursory assessment of Indian\nlaws on sexual and other forms of violence against women\nshows that these laws were for decades wholly inadequate\nboth in their framing and implementation. It was only after\nthe brutal gang rape and eventual death of a young female\nwide protests compelled the government to enact a stricter\nantirape law. Similarly, laws to deal with the sexual harass-\nment of women at the workplace were lacking at least till 17\nyears ago when, in 1997, the Supreme Court of India gave\nthe basic definition of sexual harassment at the workplace\nand provided guidelines to deal with it. These came to be\ncalled the Vishaka Guidelines. Although several attempts\nwere made to enact a law on this subject, the Sexual\nHarassment of Women at Workplace Bill eventually came\ninto effect as late as 2013. While these changes, though\nbelated, are significant, it remains to be seen whether the\nnew laws will be implemented in the manner required to\nreduce gender-based violence.\nAnother form of sexual harassment rampant in this part of\nthe world but seldom discussed is street harassment, also\nknown as \"eve-teasing.\" This specifically refers to harass-\nment that is faced mostly by women from men who are\nstrangers, in public spaces like streets, parks, modes of pub-\nlic transport, and bus-stops. \"Eve-teasing\" was defined in\nWhen a man by words either spoken or by signs and/or by\nvisible representation or by gesture does any act in public space,\nor signs, recites or utters any indecent words or song or ballad in\nany public place to the annoyance of any women.\n1University of Delhi, India\nCorresponding Author:\nSuparna Bakaya, Psychology Department, University of Delhi, GF 3, 36/75,\nEmail: suparna.bakaya@gmail.com\nStreet Harassment: A Qualitative Study\nof the Experiences of Young Women in\nDelhi\nMegha Dhillon1 and Suparna Bakaya1\n Keywords\nstreet harassment, women, public spaces, safety\n2 SAGE Open\nSome behaviors considered to be forms of \"eve-teasing\"\ninclude making passes, obscene gestures, whistling, staring,\npinching, fondling, and rubbing against women. Fairchild\nand Rudman (2008) have noted that street harassment shares\nmany common themes with the sexual harassment that hap-\npens in other contexts, most specifically the component of\nunwanted sexual attention. However, street harassment is\nunique in that it is perpetrated by strangers (as opposed to\nfamiliar people such as bosses, teachers, or medical profes-\nsionals) and that it takes place in public domains. In this\nstudy, we attempted to extend previous work by understand-\ning street harassment as it is perceived and understood by\nyoung women residing in Delhi. Based on the work that has\nalready happened in this area and the recent spate of sexual\ncrimes against women across India in public spaces, we\nhypothesized that street harassment would be a key factor in\ndetermining how women negotiated their lives in the city,\nhow safe they felt, and the amount of freedom they had in\naccessing public spaces, particularly at certain times.\nThe city of Delhi, although considered to be relatively\ncosmopolitan, modern, and one of the \"best to live in India,\"\nalso faces problems such as overcrowding, tremendous pres-\nsure on its infrastructure, and rising crime rates. In the last\nfew years, the city has garnered the reputation of being\nextremely unsafe for women (Roy Chowdhury, 2011). A\nUniversity reported facing harassment on campus roads\neveryday (Gender Study Group, cited in Mirsky, 2003). A\nmore recent report submitted by the Delhi police to the\nSupreme Court of India revealed that complaints about\nharassment in public spaces registered a fivefold increase\nfindings of a survey conducted by \"Jagori\" (2011), a nongov-\nernmental organization working on women's safety, throw\nlight on important facts about the harassment of women in\nDelhi's public places. The report indicated that most inci-\ndents of violence took place in broad daylight. Roads and\npublic transport emerged to be most unsafe. School and col-\nlege students said that they hesitated to confront perpetrators\ndue to lack of confidence, or even report incidents at home,\nfor fear of being stopped from pursuing education. Although\n70% of the women surveyed by Jagori nevertheless did\nreport confronting harassers, Mitra-Sarkar and Partheeban\nducted in Chennai. Women may choose not to retaliate in the\nface of harassment due to the high risks involved. There have\nbeen several reports from all over the world of women being\nattacked on confronting their harassers. These attacks take\nvarious forms including threats, beatings, and being run over\nby vehicles. In 2013, a young girl in Florida was brutally\nattacked on the street by a man she refused to have sex with.\nThe man unknown to her first dragged her into his car and\nchoked her. Then he dropped her on the ground and ran over\nher multiple times, only stopping when witnesses intervened\n(Kearl, 2013). In another incident that occurred in an\nupmarket Delhi restaurant on International Women's Day\nlast year, a group of five men smashed a bottle on the head of\na woman who protested against lewd comments being passed\nby them (Shekhar, 2013). Forms of retaliation from harassers\nalso include throwing acid on the woman they target.\nAlthough no governmental statistics on acid attacks are\navailable, several media reports indicate that acid attacks on\nwomen in India have been on the rise in recent years and\nmany of them have resulted in the death of the victims (Dhar,\nface of recommendations of stricter regulation of acid sales\nby the Supreme Court of India and an amendment in existing\nlaws to punish perpetrators of acid attacks with a 10-year\nimprisonment.\nDespite the challenges that it creates for women, the issue\nof street harassment has been treated frivolously in the past.\n\"Eve-teasing\" is the most common form of sexual violence\ndepicted in Hindi films (Ramasubramanian & Oliver, 2003),\ntypically shown as an act of romantic love rather than as a\ncrime. Baxi (2001) states that the term \"eve-teasing\" itself is\nhighly problematic as it constitutes women as \"eves,\" tempt-\nresses who provoke men, whereas \"teasing\" denotes that\nharassment is viewed as playful. Contrary to what is depicted\nin Indian movies, street harassment causes women to restrict\ntheir time in public places alone, be perpetually alert, and\nchange neighborhoods and jobs (Kearl, 2010). Macmillan,\nNierobisz, and Welsh (2000) found that the more experiences\na woman had being harassed in public, the less safe she felt\nin public. Harassment from strangers was associated with\nincreased fears about safety when walking alone at night,\nusing public transport, and walking alone in a parking garage.\nIn the study by the Gender Study Group in Delhi (cited in\non campus affected their personal or academic development\nin some way such as avoiding library facilities, not joining\nvarious institutions, and avoiding particular courses.\nGiven the seriousness of the issue and the limited docu-\nmented information available, the purpose of this study was\nto highlight the lived experiences of women in Delhi as they\nattempt to resist the harassment they face while going about\ntheir daily lives like commuting to work, walking to the mar-\nket, going for a movie, and so on. Many reasons have been\npresented for why the issue of street harassment has been\nrelatively neglected, even in research in other parts of the\nworld. Bowman (1993) proposes that it has been overlooked\nperhaps because there is no legal recourse as it is almost\nimpossible to catch strangers for harassment if they disap-\npear instantly. Furthermore, Lenton, Smith, Fox, and Morra\n(1999) suggest that unless it rises to the level of assault, pub-\nlic harassment is not illegal; some men and women construe\nit as trivial or even flattering. Moreover, Gardner (1995)\nwrites that stranger harassment is so pervasive that it is a part\nof the social fabric of public life and thus women experience\nthe harassment believing that no one will think anything of\nsignificance has happened. We feel that it is the very\nDhillon and Bakaya 3\npervasiveness of street harassment and the recognition of it\nbeing so by women that makes it extremely important to\nstudy. With respect to Bowman's point, although it may be\ntrue that sometimes it is difficult to catch strangers in public\nplaces, it must be pointed out that in several cases, women\ncan identify the men who are harassing them. For example, a\nman constantly touching a woman throughout the course of\nher bus journey can easily be identified and nabbed provided\nthe woman believes she has someone to report the incident\nto. Also, regarding the idea that some men as well as women\ntreat the issue trivially, we did not find this to be the case for\nthe women who participated in our study. There are therefore\nseveral reasons for paying due attention to street harassment.\nIt needs to be acknowledged that street harassment is on the\nrise, women's lives are deeply affected by it, and most\nwomen in our experience do not trivialize it.\nIt is striking that while more urban Indian women than\never before are taking up higher studies and careers, are dat-\ning and pursuing social lives, and thus stepping into public\nspaces, these spaces are becoming increasingly dangerous\nfor women. The positive strides being made by women are\nnot translating into increased access to public spaces (Phadke,\n2010). Several intersecting causes may explain the increased\ndangers posed by public spaces to women, particularly the\nthreat of street harassment. Sociologists attribute the rise in\nstreet harassment to urban migration, destruction of mohalla\nculture, sudden upward mobility of certain caste groups, and\nnew wealth. Feminists identify street harassment as a source\nof women's disempowerment and as a part of their system-\natic oppression. Patriarchal societies are seen to share a dis-\ncourse that discourages women from leaving the private\nsphere, which is the supposed site of patriarchal protection,\nwhereas public space is imagined as inherently dangerous\n(Fregoso, 2003). When men are asked why they harass\nwomen, some of the reasons given include reliving boredom,\nentertaining their male friends, and because it is fun (Benard\n& Schlaffer, 1996). The explanations provided by men con-\nnect clearly to the tendency to objectify women. Although\nharassment may be a conjunct of the objectification of\nwomen, the outcome for women of being viewed by others in\nsexually objectifying ways may produce a tendency of inter-\nnalizing the harasser's perspective, resulting in increased\nself-objectification (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). This con-\nnection was partly supported in a study by Lord (2009),\nwhich found that the more harassing behaviors young women\nexperienced, the more likely they were to report experienc-\ning fear and anger. Also, the more negatively the women felt\nabout being harassed, the more likely they were to report\nlower self-esteem, unhappiness with their appearance, and\npreoccupation with their weight. In addition, it seems that\nwomen have come to be seen as \"open persons.\" Goffman\n(cited in Gardner, 1995) described \"civil inattention\" as the\nway strangers behave toward each other in public, which\nessentially means ignoring each other, except for briefly\nmeeting each other's eyes. An open person is someone who\nfalls into a category that allows civil inattention to lapse,\nsuch as someone who is accompanied by a child. Individuals\nwho do not meet society's standards for what is ideal may\nalso fall into this category. It appears that men have for some\nreason learned to treat women as open persons. The conse-\nquence is that civil inattention becomes an important defense\nfor women to develop if they are to avoid the intrusive atten-\ntion of men.\nConsidering the mounting reports of sexual harassment,\nsome agencies have taken steps to make Delhi's public\nspaces more tolerable for women. In 2010, the Delhi Metro\nRail Corporation decided to reserve the first coach in every\ntrain for women, although the segregation of men and women\ndoes not address the reasons that lie behind harassment. In\n2011, a \"slutwalk\" protest was organized in Delhi to high-\nlight the daily violence that women experience. Moreover\nseveral demonstrations and discussions have taken place in\nthe media and other public forums after the heinous gang\nrape of 2012. Although these attempts create awareness\nabout women's discontent, there is a continuing need to\nunderstand how women in Delhi interpret their experiences\nof street harassment, particularly in the face of the contradic-\ntions of modernity and tradition that shape the lives of\nwomen in Indian cities and transformations being witnessed\nby India's urban hubs. In this study, we looked not only at\nwomen's views on the pervasiveness of the phenomenon and\nthe reasons behind it but also attempted to identify the overt\nand covert reactions and coping mechanisms adopted by the\nwomen against the harassment. We also looked at the con-\ncerns expressed by the women's families. In addition, we\nsought to understand what women found most dissatisfac-\ntory about the present state of affairs and the changes they\ndesired to feel safer in the city.\nParticipants\nThe participants were 20 women between the ages of 18 and\n30 years residing in Delhi. The women either belonged to the\ncity or had been living here for a considerable period of time\nand came from middle- and upper-middle-class families.\nTwelve participants were students and were pursuing bache-\nlor's or master's degrees in subjects like elementary educa-\ntion and literature. The remaining participants were working\nand engaged in professions such as journalism, medicine,\nand business. Fifteen participants were unmarried whereas\nthe remaining were married. Nearly all the participants were\nHindu by religion. One participant mentioned that her mother\nwas Hindu and father was a Muslim, whereas her own reli-\ngious orientation was \"spiritual.\"\nThe sample was recruited through convenience and snow-\nball sampling and data was collected through face-to-face\nsemistructured interviews. As all the participants and inter-\nviewers were bilingual, the interviews were conducted in\nHindi and English. These ranged in length from 32 to 90 min.\nEach interview was audiotaped and subsequently transcribed.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe interviews were analyzed using the interpretative phe-\nnomenological approach (Smith & Eatough, 2007). First, the\ninterviews were read to comprehend the essence of each\ninterview. Thereafter, similarities and differences across all\ninterviews were noted. Then initial themes were identified,\norganized into clusters, and checked against the data. The\nfinal themes and subthemes that emerged were then put\ntogether as a narrative account of the interplay between par-\nticipants' perspectives and researchers' interpretations of\nsame.\nResults and Discussion\nThe themes that emerged from the analysis have been pre-\nsented below with illustrative passages from the interviews.\nOmnipresence of Street Harassment\nThe women we spoke to perceived street harassment to be\nextremely prevalent. Frequencies mentioned by the women\nranged from being harassed on 50% of visits to public places\nto being harassed on all such occasions. Prevalence rates\nreported here are similar to those reported by other samples\nfrom Delhi (Gender Study group, cited in Mirsky, 2003) and\nsamples from foreign countries such as the United States\n(Nielsen, 2000). Harassment took place in various forms\nsuch as men staring, passing lewd comments, and rubbing\nagainst women's bodies. Once again participants' responses\nindicate that street harassment occurs in similar ways across\ngeographically distant places. Women in countries like\nBritain (Kearl, 2010) and Egypt have reported similar forms\nof harassment (Ilahi, 2009). With respect to the kinds of pub-\nlic spaces in which such harassment occurred most often,\nrather than isolated places where a woman may find herself\nalone with the harasser, harassment was reported to occur in\ncrowded spaces.Although the perception may be that women\nare safer in places where they are among other people, this\ndoes not appear to be true with respect to street harassment.\nMediums of public transport such as buses and the metro\nemerged to be spaces mentioned with the greatest frequency.\nAt any given time of day, modes of public transport are\nextremely crowded in Delhi. This kind of crowding brings\nmen and women in close proximity creating the possibilities\nof unwanted touches. It also makes it difficult for the woman\nto judge whether the behavior was intentional or uninten-\ntional and therefore to question the aggressor. The partici-\npants reported the harassment in modes of public transport to\nbe so rampant that some had stopped traveling in buses alto-\ngether and traveled only in the ladies' compartment of the\nmetro. With respect to time of day, the participants faced\nharassment during broad daylight. These findings support\nthose of the Jagori report. Women believed that harassment\noccurred after dark as well but said that because they avoided\nbeing in public places on their own after sundown due to\nsafety concerns, they did not have to face the harassment.\nRuhi, a 28-year-old freelance writer, said,\nIt happens the most during rush hours, when you are coming\nfrom office or going to office or school or college. There's a lot\nof rush at that time. It's very easy for people to (harass). At\nnight, I wouldn't know because I don't travel alone. When I was\nusing public transport, I would use it during the day. In the night\nI am sure that (the harassment) is worse.\nThere was no clear-cut consensus on the characteristics of\nmen whom they were harassed by. Whereas some women\nconsidered younger men from lower socioeconomic back-\ngrounds to harass them most often, others said that they had\nbeen harassed by men of all ages, backgrounds, and educa-\ntional levels. For instance, Sushmita, a 21-year-old student\nof chartered accountancy, said,\nI don't think I can pin-point a particular type because I have\nexperienced being eve-teased by people of my grandfather's age\nand people wearing proper shirts and ties and going to office.\nPeople like them and people who are absolutely useless, whiling\naway time on the streets. I don't think there is any type.\nThe fact that no specific demographic characteristics\nemerged to be significant is not surprising. Past research has\nindicated that the sexual harassment of women is not usually\nrelated to a man's age, marital status, physical attractiveness,\nMale harassers are more distinguishable by their psychologi-\ncal characteristics (Paludi & Barickman, 1998; Pryor, Giedd,\n& William, 1995) rather than by demographic\ncharacteristics.\nPerceived Reasons\nOn being asked why they felt harassment was omnipresent in\nDelhi, the women provided several possible reasons. By and\nlarge, Delhi was perceived to be more unsafe, crime-infested,\nand prone to instances of street harassment than the other big\ncities of India. Some women connected increasing rates of\nstreet harassment to the presence of male immigrants who\ncame from what were perceived to more oppressive pockets\nof the country. The participants believed that men who came\nfrom parts of the country in which women were expected to\nremain only within the domestic sphere, used harassment as\na way to demean the women in Delhi who stepped into pub-\nlic spaces. For instance, Ruhi said, \"Small town men in awe\nof Delhi women, very male ego thing. That why are women\nso strong, why are women traveling, why are they doing all\nof that stuff. So they try to put you down.\" Delhi being the\ncapital of the nation witnesses a large amount of in-migra-\ntion. According to a report by the Indian Institute of Human\nSettlement (IIHS), the two largest streams of migration into\nthe city are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Better job pros-\npects is one of the main reasons for migration into the city,\nwith a majority of workers finding employment in the unor-\nganized service sector (Delhi Human Development Report,\n2006). To our knowledge, there is no past research that links\nincreasing immigration into the city with rising rates of street\nDhillon and Bakaya 5\nharassment. Neither is there any data to indicate that most\nharassers are men who do not belong to the city. Considering\nthat studies have indicated men of all demographic profiles\nto engage in harassment, the views expressed by the partici-\npants need to be understood within the context of commonly\nheld perceptions regarding immigrants. First, for example,\nthere are widespread negative stereotypes especially about\nBihari people such as being rural, poor laborers, and unedu-\ncated (Lynnebakke, 2007). Second, and linked to the first\npoint, there have been instances of people in high adminis-\ntrative positions publicly blaming immigrants for the prob-\nlems of the city. In 2012, the then chief minister of Delhi\nidentified the \"unbridled influx\" of migrants into Delhi as a\nmajor challenge and blamed the burgeoning population for\nthe city's problems. Given the notions that exist about immi-\ngrant populations, women may perceive them to be a threat\nto their safety although the reality of these beliefs remain to\nbe objectively tested. However, many participants saw the\npatriarchal culture within Delhi as perpetuating harassment.\nKomal, a 29-year-old woman working in a multinational\ncompany, said, \"It's purely got to do with the ethos of the\nmen here. One, they feel that (harassment) is their right.\nSecond, they feel that it's right. They don't feel it's morally\nwrong.\" Participants also felt that taboos around sex, the\nmales, which is lower than the national average), and the\nlack of close community ties contributed to the harassment\nof women. Other given reasons included weak and poorly\nimplemented laws and lack of awareness about the laws.\nMost participants reported that they themselves knew little\nabout the laws on street harassment. There is no law in the\nIndian penal code (IPC) that exists specifically for street\nharassment. However, certain sections of the IPC that pertain\nto men indulging in obscene gestures, remarks, or songs,\nshowing pornographic material to women, making sexually\ncolored remarks, and so on, can evoke imprisonments and\nfines. The findings point to the need to create awareness\nabout the laws as well as their effective implementation.\nReactions to Street Harassment\nWomen reported a variety of reactions to the harassers rang-\ning from nonconfrontational to highly confrontational.\nSometimes women just ignored the harassment. At other\ntimes, they reacted, for example, by staring back at the\nharasser, hitting him, or shouting at him. For each woman,\nthe decision to confront the harasser was based on certain\nconsiderations such as whether she was in a familiar place,\nwhether she was with an elder person, or whether the harasser\nhad crossed a certain line. At times, women chose to move\naway from harassers due to fears that the situation might\nescalate further. Although several reasons have been identi-\nfied in Western studies for why women will not react in these\nsituations, including societal pressure; concern about being\ncalled a feminist; fear of retaliation; or fear of being\nperceived as impolite, aggressive, or nonfeminine (Swim &\nHyers, 1999), the main reason given by participants in this\nstudy was fear of escalation. This is not surprising in light of\nthe attacks on women we discussed earlier on. Some women\nalso said that they did not want to \"create a scene.\"Appearing\nimpolite, aggressive, or unfeminine were not mentioned at\nall. Most women believed that bystanders would be unsup-\nportive in such situations because they were busy or because\nharassment did not impact their lives. This thought also com-\npelled the women to abstain from confrontations. Despite\nbehaving nonconfrontationally at times, many women felt\nthat it was actually better to confront harassers and wished\nthat they did so more often. Most participants felt that when\nwomen remained quiet, they sent out the message that they\nwere submitting to harassment. Meenakshi, a 22-year-old\nstudent pursuing a bachelor's degree in elementary educa-\ntion considered it important to \"shame\" the harassers. She\nsaid, \"(When I lash out) people are taken aback. You can see\nshame on their faces that a girl said this to them and they\nwalk off.\" Yet, women also felt that while by confronting\nthey were trying to tell that harasser to stop, he himself could\nmisinterpret the confrontation as an invitation. Like Asmita,\na 25-year-old journalist, said, \"(Harassers) think this girl\nabuses, she must be really feisty. So it becomes (that) she is\ntrying to encourage it, let's come back.\"\nBeing harassed was also associated with negative emo-\ntions such as feeling embarrassed, unsafe, disgusted, objecti-\nfied, and frustrated. In line with the findings of Swim, Hyers,\nCohen, and Ferguson (2001), we also found anger to be com-\nmon among the participants. Women felt angry over the idea\nthat harassment was ubiquitous, passed off as inconsequen-\ntial, and faced by participants simply because they were\nwomen. Contrary to men's reports that they intend to compli-\nment women by passing comments or touching them, none\nof the women said that they found such experiences flatter-\ning. Gardner (1995) has pointed out that even when the con-\ntent of street remarks is complimentary, other features of the\nremarks might preclude them from being understood as com-\npliments as they occur in a public place, are passed among\nunacquainted members of the opposite sex, the expected\ncompliment response--thank you--is unacceptable and\noften produces escalating hostility and the remarks often\nrefer to parts of the body not available for public examina-\ntion. Hence, they do not serve the same function as compli-\nments. Not only were acts of harassment completely\nunwelcome, each woman believed that street harassment\nincidents could take uglier turns such as being raped, being\nattacked with acid, getting kidnapped, and so on. A mounting\nbody of evidence suggests that street harassment causes\nwomen to be more aware of their sexual vulnerability, one of\nthe greatest fears being that of rape (MacMillan et al., 2000).\nWhereas some women reported suppressing these feelings,\nothers said that they shared them with friends and parents.\nMeans of coping also included crying to vent feelings or tell-\ning one's self that it was a usual part of life in Delhi.\n6 SAGE Open\nIronically, although this thought provided a superficial sense\nof consolation, the idea that harassment was embedded in the\ncity's functioning was also what deeply angered the\nparticipants.\nFamily Reactions\nWhile street harassment clearly affects the women who face\nit, their families are bound to be effected as well. However,\nconcerns and worries of family members with respect to the\nharassment of women in public places have largely gone\nunstudied. Many participants reported that their mothers and\nfathers remained worried about their safety. To keep their\ndaughters safe, parents were reported to use two kinds of\nmeasures. The first was imposing restrictions on where their\ndaughters could go and what time they needed to come back.\nThis inhibited some of the participants in talking to their par-\nents about the issue because they were wary of the restric-\ntions. For example, Komal said,\nSo my parents would tell me don't go out. If I discuss with them\nthen my freedom is curtailed. So I don't want to discuss it. They\nknow they can't make the world a safer place so they just want\nto reduce the chances of anything happening to me.\nThe second response from parents was advising their\ndaughters on how to handle unpleasant situations. Some par-\nents advised their daughters to take action against the aggres-\nsor. For instance, Meenakshi said, \"My dad is like, even if\nyou have to hit someone below the belt do that . . . and if you\nfeel overpowered, then and there call police.\" Her father also\nadvised her on other more nonconfrontational ways of\nremaining safe. She said,\nHis reaction is that be safe no matter what it takes, whether it is\nconservativeclothing.Ifyouhavetowearsomethingflamboyant,\nsuit your behavior and your transport accordingly . . . don't be\ntoo loud, don't attract too much attention towards yourself.\nHowever, some parents advised their daughters to simply\nget away from the harasser. For example, Sushmita said,\nWhenever I have started fighting (with the harasser), my mom\ngets scared and she tells me to stay away from it which is also I\nthink one huge problem because that also somewhere tells you\nthat you cannot do anything.\nThis indicates that though the participants understood\ntheir parents' concerns, they were not willing to adopt every-\nthing their parents suggested and desired to use their own\njudgments in determining how a particular situation should\nbe handled.\nApathy\nThe participants believed that there was general apathy\ntoward women's concerns about street harassment, which\nwas seen to extend from politicians and police to the general\npublic. They felt that harassment was seen as a \"normal and\nregular affair\" and thus ignored. Politicians were seen as\nextremely insensitive for blaming women for the harassment\nthey faced. Devika, a 19-year-old student of literature, said,\nI remember there was this news correspondent who was\nreturning after her work, late at night, and she was killed or\nharassed, something happened to her. And the chief minister\nsimply said that why are women traveling so late at night when\nthey know that it is not safe!\nAccording to Ilahi (2009), street harassment may be partly\nignored by authorities because women do not usually report\ncases of harassment to the police. This may happen for two\nreasons. One reason that has already been identified in previ-\nous literature is the difficultly involved in identifying the\nharasser. Like Asmita said, \"It's not that you can provide\nmuch information. (Police) will say `Who was it?' I don't\nknow. What was the car number (of the harasser)? I don't\nknow.\" The other reason may be the sense of mistrust women\nhave toward the police. Some women reported that they had\nbeen stared at and whistled at by police personnel. Ruhi talked\nabout how the police, like politicians, could pose a danger to\nwomen by blaming them. In line with this, Meenakshi dis-\ncussed how when she and her friend decided to report an\ninstance of molestation at the local police station, they were\ntoldbyawomanconstablethatthekindofclothesMeenakshi's\nfriend was wearing was bound to result in harassment. Thus,\nthe belief that the police could be extremely insensitive\nextended to female police personnel as well. Some women\nexpressed dissatisfaction with police efforts. Sushmita said,\n\"If you go to (police) they might do something. I myself have\ngone to police and police have shouted at (harassers). But if\nyou are just standing there, I haven't seen a single policeman\ncome up.\" Meenakshi said that attitudes of the police differed\nfrom one police station to another. Police personnel stationed\nnear her college were responsive because they knew the col-\nlege principal, but police stations further off were not.\nPerceptions of the police as apathetic seem widespread.\nwomen surveyed by them sought assistance from the police\nand only a few found them helpful. Indian women's move-\nments have said that women's complaints of sexual harass-\nment are routinely disbelieved. Moreover Baxi (2001) asserts\nthat assault reports are open to interpretation by the police. It\nis clear that what women believe about the attitudes of law-\nenforcing agencies has profound implications for how they\napproach incidents of harassment. When women believe the\nstate machinery to be either unwilling or unable to redress\ntheir problems, as expressed here, it often functions to silence\nwomen around the issue.\nStrategies for Self-Protection\nWhen within public spaces, women anticipated facing\nharassment and actively adopted strategies to prevent it from\nDhillon and Bakaya 7\noccurring. The strategies chosen by the women were directed\nat keeping attention away from themselves and marking their\npersonal boundaries within the public spaces that they occu-\npied. Phadke (2010) asserts that safety for women does not\nautomatically come from institutional factors like infrastruc-\nture or policing but has to be actively produced by women on\nan everyday basis. The production of safety takes place with\nthe implicit understanding that the responsibility of negotiat-\ning \"danger\" rests with women. Not surprisingly, as public\ntransport was seen as one of the most common sites for\nharassment, some participants who were able to afford per-\nsonal cars chose to travel by their own vehicles. However,\neven traveling in a car would not always be safe particularly\nafter dark. Harshita, a 27-year-old information technology\n(IT) professional, spoke of how she ensured that every door\nand window of her car remained locked when she was driv-\ning alone because she had been followed and harassed even\nin her own car. While using public transport, women tended\nto protect their bodies from unwelcome touches and stares in\nvarious ways. For example, Meenakshi said,\nWhen I am traveling in public transport I try to cover my breasts.\nI would just wrap my arms around (myself) or I will hug the pole\nin the bus . . . I make it a point to carry stole . . . When I am in a\ncrowded place I try to wedge everyone with my elbows and I\npush people.\nHence, the women used certain nonsexual parts of their\nbodies and scarves to protect more sexualized parts such as\nbreasts. Nupur, a 20-year-old student pursuing a graduate\ndegree in psychology, said that in buses women would put\ntheir bags between themselves and copassengers to avoid\nbeing touched. Women have also been found to modify their\npublic behaviors in order not to draw unwanted male atten-\ntion (Guano, 2007). This was also found to hold true for the\nparticipants in the present study. Some women adopted\n\"dead-pan\" facial expressions and avoided eye-contact with\nstrangers so as not to attract attention. Women also chose\ntheir clothing according to where they were going and\navoided staying out till late. Harshita said,\nAs a girl you have to be conscious 24\u00d77 in this city. You have to\nbe conscious of where you are going what you are wearing, what\ntime you are going to be there. You leave at a certain time, you\nbe back at a certain time. When you are stepping out, then you\nanyways have to be careful about what you are wearing . . . You\nwould not wear very tight t-shirts, skirts and all of that.\nBecause what women wear has been used to legitimize\nharassment, many women alter their dressing styles in the\npublic sphere. They attempt to draw less attention to them-\nselves by clothes that hide their bodies to attain more public\nfreedom although they may not actually achieve this free-\ndom. Despite the importance given by the women to dressing\nin a certain way, most said that women's clothing was not\nresponsible for harassment. Whereas some said that reveal-\ning clothes attracted unwanted attention, all the participants\nreported that they had been harassed while wearing loose\nclothing that covered their bodies. Nupur explained that\ndespite knowing clothing could not provide protection from\nharassment and believing that clothes were not responsible\nfor harassment, she continued to wear clothes that covered\nher body so that no one would get a chance to blame her for\nthe harassment. In line with this belief, Phadke (2007) states\nthat women who dress in a way that is socially defined as\nprovocative are seen as \"asking for trouble\" and unlikely to\nreceive public sympathy if they are harassed publicly.\nAnother strategy for preventing harassment was to avoid\ngoing out alone at night. Interestingly, street harassment\noccurs mostly in crowded places, and at night, the crowds\nmay be expected to be less. Despite this, women felt vulner-\nable going out at night especially on their own. It is apparent\nhere that harassment had forced women out of public spaces\nat least at certain times and increased their dependence on\nmen. Bowman (1993) has theorized that street harassment\nsubstantially limits the liberty of women in the most funda-\nmental sense of freedom from restraint. It reduces the physi-\ncal and geographical mobility of women, preventing them\nfrom appearing alone in public space and in the process\naccomplishing an \"informal ghettoization\" of women to the\nprivate space of the home. Feminists note that the reasons for\nkeeping women away from public spaces may be rooted in\nthe patriarchal demands for closely monitoring and control-\nling the sexuality and thus the mobility of women, particu-\nlarly those who are young. Sen (1984) discusses the different\nways in which patriarchal setups control and channelize\nyoung women's sexuality. One of these ways is to dominate\nand control public spaces and for men to claim that public\nspaces are male-only dominions. When women do enter\nthese spaces, they are tolerated only within very strict limits\nof movement, action, and dress and \"transgressions\" are\noften met with harsh retribution in the form of sexual and\nphysical assaults. Anwary (2003) for instance discusses how\nthe increase in acid violence against women in Bangladesh\nsince the late 1980s may partly be a result of a reassertion of\npatriarchy in the face of perceived threats of female employ-\nment and independence. Similarly, it has been suggested that\nthe postrevolution spate of sexual attacks on women in Egypt\nmay be the result of a large-scale campaign from Egypt's\nsecurity forces to undermine the political opposition. By tar-\nnishing political demonstrations with sexual violence, it is\nthought that elements of the security forces hostile to the\nrevolution might discredit its moral standing and discourage\nfemale protesters from taking part (Holman, 2012). Here one\nsenses not the state's apathy but complicity in the\npandemic.\nAlthough most women believed that many strategies they\nadopted were effective in reducing the amount of harassment\nthey faced, the possibility of getting harassed always\nremained. Thus, the strategies did not guarantee protection.\nOnly one strategy was seen by every participant as an almost\nfoolproof way of avoiding harassment, which was to go into\npublic spaces with a male. Devika said,\n8 SAGE Open\nWhen I am accompanied by a male . . . I don't know why but I\nfeel more secure. Because probably when accompanied by a\nmale . . . the person who is the harasser doesn't have that much\nof confidence to initiate an assault.\nThe word almost is imperative here as in both cases of the\ngang rape that occurred in 2012 and the incident in the mar-\nketplace that happened a few months later, the women were\nassaulted despite being accompanied by men. Men who\nattempt to intervene and stop the harassment may also be\nattacked as is what happened in 2011 when two young men\nwere beaten and killed for defending their female friends\nfrom harassment outside a restaurant in Mumbai\nRequired Changes\nSome participants felt that for harassment to reduce, a com-\nplete social change and \"social upliftment\" was required. For\ninstance, Devika said, \"you know I think there is a dire need\nfor a change, a revolution wherein women are given the\nrespect they need and they deserve. The disparities between\nmen and women should really decrease.\" Ruhi felt a certain\namount of responsibility lay with women. She said, \"It is not\ngoing to help unless it's a collective consciousness, where\nwomen are actively taking a stand and going out and hitting\n(harassers) out and police is there to support you.\" Also,\nwomen had to stop feeling embarrassed by the harassment,\nand sensitivity and awareness had to be created around the\ngraveness of the issue as opposed to glamorizing it. Sushmita\nsaid,\nIf it is taught that, not only to the girls but also to the boys that it\nis wrong, it is not funny, it is not cool, it does not give you a right\nto raise your collar and walk around with your friends by eve-\nteasing a girl, that's not really showing your manliness. From a\nwoman's perspective at a very personal level I think we need to\nstop getting embarrassed by such situations.\nThe participants also felt that the police needed to be more\nproactive. Sakshi, a 25-year-old entrepreneur, said, \"There\nshould be more awareness in police as well. They should\nmake sure women can travel. There should be more police\nbooths, more numbers where women can just call up. There\nis hardly any awareness about such numbers.\" Stricter pun-\nishments for the harassers and a more supportive attitude\nfrom police personnel were also seen to be important.\nParticipants also expressed that apart from being too busy or\nuninterested in helping, bystanders did not get involved\nthinking that they themselves would get extremely entangled\nin the complex legal process. Ruhi said,\nIt's such a big issue that you need your police, you need\ngovernance in the city to help you do that. Our government\nshould take strict action. They need to really start punishing\nthese guys. I am sure there are a certain category of people who\nwant to go out and help others but they can't do it because they\nknow it's not going to leave them anywhere . . . If I am being\nharassed and your brother is on the road and trying to help me\nand he helps me and it becomes a police case, your brother is\ngoing to get pulled into it. He doesn't even know me. He's just\ngoing to get stuck. But if your brother knows that even if he\nmakes a police complaint, or confronts this (harasser) his family\nlife is not going to get effected in any which way, he will step out\nand do it.\nMany women referred to the media as a source of infor-\nmation through which they learnt the frequency and types of\ncrime that were being committed against women in the city.\nA majority of participants believed that the media could play\na role in creating awareness against street harassment. For\ninstance, Devika said,\nI think media can play a very vital role because they can actually\nbring about a change by propagating the right kind of messages\n. . . they must encourage women to stand up for themselves, and\nstand up for their security and safety. They must encourage\nwomen to actually report to the authorities, to actually adopt\ncertain measures for security probably like carrying pepper\nspray, indulging in martial arts, taekwondo, etc.\nHowever certain others felt that the media was also prone\nto blowing issues out of proportion and portraying women as\ndamsels in distress needing good men to protect them from\nbad men. Ruhi felt that although the media could bring atten-\ntion to such issues, real changes would only occur if the judi-\ncial system took the issue more seriously. The combined\nresponses of the participants thus indicate the need for simul-\ntaneous changes at multiple levels so that women can access\nthe city in the ways that they want to.\nIn line with our expectations, we found that street harass-\nment by male strangers was extremely influential in deter-\nmining how women approached life in the city. The views\npresented by the participants enabled us to identify a number\nof factors and processes through which street harassment\npersists in being an impediment to women's freedom and\nsecurity. These appear to operate in a cyclical manner and\nhave been presented in Figure 1.\nHarassment within public places appears to occur in mul-\ntiple forms with high frequency, most often in broad daylight\nand in crowded spaces. It is an outcome of a number of vari-\nables that appear to be interrelated. Within patriarchal societ-\nies, women are often treated as objects. This objectification\nis considered natural and justified. Women are also often\nblamed for the violence they face. In a society that largely\noperates on these premises, apathy from the police, poor\nimplementation of laws, as well as indifference from bystand-\ners toward women's problems are excepted outcomes. Given\nthe very nature of street harassment, the fact that it carries\ndangers of further harm, such as rape and acid attacks and the\nsheer dismissal of the issue at various fronts, women report\nfeeling a variety of negative emotions in response to it\nDhillon and Bakaya 9\nincluding anger and fear. Anxiety is also experienced by the\nwomen's families who have little control over what the\nwomen have to deal with in public places. Because women\nanticipate harassment and believe that help will not be forth-\ncoming from other quarters, they actively adopt self-protec-\ntive strategies to prevent it from occurring in the first place\nalthough no strategies guarantee safety. When confronted\nwith instances of harassment, women's overt reactions that\nmay range from moving away to confronting the harasser are\nmediated by a variety of considerations. Although women\nwould rather confront the harassers than ignore them, it is\nmost strongly the fear of retaliation and the concern that their\nreaction may be misinterpreted as an invitation that inhibits\nwomen from taking action. In such circumstances, confron-\ntation may lead to further harassment. However, the choice\nto remain silent and ignore harassers is also a difficult one for\nwomen, as silence is also seen to perpetuate the culture of\nharassment.\nConclusion\nThe constant possibility of being harassed in public places\ncontrolled several aspects of the participants'lives, including\ntheir timings of travel, choice of clothing, and behavior in the\npublic sphere. However, there were two positive findings in\nthe study. First, though self-blame has been found to occur\nFactors contributing to Harassment\n\u00b7 Oppressive notions about women\n\u00b7 Objectification of women\n\u00b7 Apathy from police\n\u00b7 Poor implementation of laws\n\u00b7 Indifference from bystanders\nUnchecked these lead to\nHarassment behaviours occurring:\n\u00b7 In Multiple forms\n\u00b7 With high frequency\n\u00b7 In Broad daylight\n\u00b7 In Crowded places\nWomen reactions to harassment involve\nSelf-protection strategies Emotional Reactions: fear,\nanger, frustration\nAnticipation of harassment\nleads to\nWillingness to act upon anger\nand frustration is mediated by\nConsiderations: Am I alone?

Model emerging from views of participants.\namong women who experience harassment (Kearl, 2010),\nnone of the women we spoke to attributed the harassment\nthey faced to anything they did, said, or wore. The responsi-\nbility for harassment was placed squarely on the shoulders of\nthe harasser. Second, although previous research has estab-\nlished linkages between street harassment and women's ten-\ndency for self-objectification, we did not find this to be the\ncase, for example, in the form of lowered self-esteem or\ngreater preoccupation with weight or appearance. However,\nstudying the relationship between levels of street harassment\nand self-objectification in Indian samples appears to be a rel-\nevant area for future research.\nThe detailed perspectives and instances shared by the par-\nticipants point to the need to treat street harassment as a\ndeeply serious matter. Of all the changes that the participants\nwished to see, the most significant was a change in the way\nthe police responded to instances of harassment. The ineffec-\ntive manner in which the police operated was perceived to\nfurther deter already apathetic bystanders from helping\nwomen being harassed. Moreover, police personnel were\nseen as potential harassers. Unless women believe that the\npolice force of the city shall cooperate with them, they are\nunlikely to report such incidents. Crimes that go unreported\nforeclose the possibility of perpetrators being punished and\nallow offenses to occur repeatedly. It is thus imperative to\ncreate better redressal mechanisms and also for the police\nforce of the city to proactively reach out to women to estab-\nlish trust. The findings also indicate that contrary to common\nperception, police patrolling and the creation of safety are\nrequired not only at night and at isolated spots but also dur-\ning the day and in crowded places. Modes of public transport\nneed to be closely monitored, considering that they are seen\nto be extremely unsafe, so much so that some women had\nstopped using them altogether. In addition, creating aware-\nness about laws is important in which the outspoken Indian\nmedia and once again the police can play an important role.\nOrganizations like Jagori are already involved in such initia-\ntives. Over a year ago, the Supreme Court has ordered that in\nthe event of a complaint of harassment, the driver must take\nthe vehicle to the nearest police station. If the driver does not,\nthen the authorities must cancel his permit to ply. This was\npart of directions issued by the court to fight street harass-\nment including the installation of closed-circuit televisions\n(CCTVs) and deputation of plainclothed female police per-\nsonnel in public places. Effective implementation of these\nand other measures like adequately functioning toilets for\nwomen and men, proper street lighting, and gender sensitiza-\ntion programs based on feminist values, particularly in\nschools and colleges to enable young people to challenge\nmisogynistic notions, shall be critical to reducing instances\nof harassment.\nLike any research, this study has certain limitations.\nFirst, the study is intended to elucidate women's experi-\nences; however, it does not endeavor generalizations. The\nsample of the study was small and participants in this study\nwere urban, young, north Indian, and moderately affluent.\nWomen's experiences of street harassment vary in accor-\ndance with race, age, and class. For example, women from\nlower socioeconomic backgrounds would be even more vul-\nnerable to harassment in public spaces considering that they\nare likely to spend more time in these spaces than women\nfrom more affluent backgrounds. Women who belong to dif-\nferent parts of the country, particular the north-east, may\nexperience harassment in unique ways. Future research\nwithin this area needs to understand experiences of women\nfrom various castes, classes, and regions to understand how\nthese categories interact with and shape women's experi-\nences in public spaces. Second, we cannot ignore the possi-\nbility that there may have been more to the experiences of\nthe participants than the present interviews captured. The\nnature of any person's experience is always in part inacces-\nsible to others. Finally, the possibility of researcher's bias\ncannot be ignored in a qualitative study. However, the\nresearchers attempted to maintain reflexivity throughout the\nresearch process.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnwary, A.
