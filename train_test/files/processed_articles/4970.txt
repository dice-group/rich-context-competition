In this study, we investigated whether\nTriggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1) is present in urine samples from children\nwith urinary tract infection (UTI) and in samples from healthy children.\nMethods: A total of 128 samples met the inclusion criteria for the study. Urine samples were\nprocessed for culture and urinalysis as a regular protocol for patients with UTI. Samples were\nclassified according to culture and urinalysis results. TREM-1 protein expression was detected with\nflow cytometry and sTREM-1 was assessed by ELISA.\nResults: Flow cytometry showed detectable expression of TREM-1 in 100% of samples, UTI and\nnon-UTI groups (p < 0.001). Mean fluorescence intensity of TREM-1 was different between the\ngroups (p < 0.001). Levels of sTREM-1 were detected in patients with UTI, but not in non-UTI\npatients.\nConclusions: All of our patients (healthy and diseased) showed TREM-1 expression. However,\nTREM-1 levels in patients with UTI tend to be higher and are associated with increased neutrophils\nand cytokine activity induced by bacteria.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Departamento de Urologi\n\u00b4a, Centro Medico Nacional de\nOccidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,\nGuadalajara, Jalisco, Me\n\u00b4xico\n2Departamento de Inmunologi\n\u00b4a, Centro de Investigacio\n\u00b4n\nBiome\n\u00b4dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro\nSocial, Sierra Mojada, Colonia Independencia, Guadalajara,\nJalisco, Mexico\n3Departamento de Inmunologi\n\u00b4a, Centro de Investigacio\n\u00b4n\nBiome\n\u00b4dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro\nSocial, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\n4Departamento de Endocrinologi\n\u00b4a Pedia\n\u00b4trica, Hospital\nAngeles del Carmen, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\n5Departamento de Inmunologi\n\u00b4a, Centro de Investigacio\n\u00b4n\nBiome\n\u00b4dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro\nSocial, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\n6Departamento de Inmunologi\n\u00b4a, Centro de Investigacio\n\u00b4n\nBiome\n\u00b4dica de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro\nSocial, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\nCorresponding author:\nAlejandro Bravo Cue\n\u00b4llar, Departamento de Inmunologi\n\u00b4a,\nCentro de Investigacio\n\u00b4n Biome\n\u00b4dica de Occidente, Instituto\nMexicano del Seguro Social, Sierra Mojada 800, Colonia\nIndependencia, Guadalajara, Jalisco, 44340 MX, Mexico.\nEmail: abravoc@prodigy.net.mx\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Of the\nnumerous Gram-negative species of bac-\nteria that can cause urinary tract infection\n(UTI), uropathogenic Escherichia coli is\nresponsible for >80% of these UTIs in\nuncompromised patients.1 UTI constitutes\nthe second most common infectious disease\nin humans, following respiratory tract infec-\ntion. The majority of patients with UTI are\nfemales, ranging in age from the early teen\nyears to older people. A large proportion\n(up to 25%) of these patients will subse-\nquently be afflicted by reoccurring or per-\nsistent infection. The presence of immune\nsurveillance molecules is critical to any\nimmune response mounted by the urinary\ntract. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is\nthe best characterized of these molecules.\nTLR4 promotes vigorous cytokine and\nchemokine responses in the urinary tract\nto Gram- negative bacteria.1 Interestingly,\nrecent studies have shown that TLR4 plays\na number of additional antimicrobial roles\nthat appear to be specific for the urinary\ntract.2 Polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells\n(PMN) play an important role in the pro-\ngression of inflammation. They are the first\ncells to be recruited to the site of aggression\nand become highly activated by a wide\narray of ligands. Receptor-activated PMN\nrelease chemokines and cytokines, such as\ntumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a),\ninterleukin (IL)-1b, IL-8, macrophage\ninflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP)-1-a,\nand MIP-1b, among others. The products\nof activated PMN recruit more cells to the\ninflammation site and actively contribute to\nmodulation of the adaptive immune\nresponse.3 One novel molecule, the human\ntriggering receptor expressed on myeloid\ncells (TREM)-1, is a 30-kDa glycoprotein of\nthe immunoglobulin superfamily. In vitro\nand in vivo studies have shown that\nTriggering receptor expressed on myeloid\ncells (TREM-1) expression is strongly\nupregulated by extracellular bacteria, par-\nticularly the cell wall component, and by\nfungi, although not by mycobacteria. In\ncontrast, TREM-1 is poorly expressed\nin noninfectious inflammatory diseases,\nsuch as psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and\nvasculitis, and in granulomatous disorders,\nsuch as tuberculosis (TB) or foreign body\ngranulomas. A soluble form of TREM-1\n(sTREM-1) is released from activated\nphagocytes and can be found in body\nfluids.4 The role of TREM-1 in UTI has\nbeen defined in some studies, but to the best\nof our knowledge, only the soluble form has\nbeen studied.5\nWe designed this prospective and ana-\nlytical study to measure TREM-1 and\nsTREM-1 in myeloid cells in urine sediment\nto investigate their role in UTI.\nMethods\nSubjects\nOur study comprised patients who were\noutpatients during 1 year at the Pediatric\nUrology Department of the Pediatric\nHospital, Western National Medical Center,\nNational Institute of Social Security (IMSS)\nin Jalisco, Mexico. The institutional review\nboard approved the study (number: R-2010-\nabout the study. Inclusion criteria were as\nfollows: children between the ages of 1 and 16\nyears, both sexes, and those with clinical\nsymptoms of UTI (frequency, dysuria, and\nabdominal pain).\nChildren with the following specific risk\nfactors for UTI were excluded: vesicoureteral\nreflux, urinary tract stone disease, chronic\nrenal disease, TB, patients on antibiotics\nor immunosuppressor drugs (transplanted\npatients), and patients with immunological\nor neoplastic diseases. Urine samples were\ncollected for urinalysis and urine culture in all\nof the patients. Diagnosis of UTI was per-\nformed according to American Academy of\nPediatrics criteria.6,7\nPatients were divided into two groups:\nUTI and non-UTI. Nearly 70% of children\nwho were diagnosed UTI presented with\nurinary frequency, dysuria, and abdominal\ncolony forming units (CFU)/mL) were man-\naged with antibiotics. Patients with fever\nand macroscopic haematuria were not\nincluded in the study. Patients with negative\nresults were managed symptomatically.\nmore different microorganisms were\nexcluded. None of the patients included in\nthe study required management as an\ninpatient.\nData collection\nDemographic and disease data of patients\nincluded, sex, age, clinical history, urinaly-\nsis, urine culture, and sTREM-1 and\nTREM-1 levels. Results of TREM-1 and\nurinalysis were collected on the sampling\nday. Urine culture results were collected 72 h\nafter sampling. With regard to sTREM-1,\nthe samples were processed as soon as 40 of\nthese were accumulated for the enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate.\nUrine samples\nFor sampling, all of the patients underwent\ngenital hygiene with soap and water in the\nlaboratory. In the majority of patients,\nsamples were able to be collected during\nthe urinary midstream. Young children\nrequired placement of a collection bag.\nUrinalysis and urine culture samples were\nprocessed and the remainder (5\u00ad15 mL) of\nthe urine was used for the next step\n(sTREM-1, TREM-1, and mean fluores-\ncence intensity [MFI] measurements).\nAll samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm\nduring 5 min. After centrifugation, 1 mL of\nsupernatant was collected and stored at\n\u00c080C until assessment of sTREM-1 by\nELISA. The pellet was prepared and we\nsubsequently analysed TREM-1 expression\nby flow cytometry (FC).\nAssessment of TREM-1 expression\nby flow cytometry\nThe pellet was washed three times with 2 mL\nPBS and resuspended in 100 mL PBS buffer\nadded to Fc Receptor Blocking Solution\n(BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). The\ncells were then incubated with antihuman\nTREM-1-phycoerythrin (R&D Systems,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA) for 30 min at\nroom temperature. Subsequently, the cells\nwere washed with PBS, fixed with 1%\nparaformaldehyde, and analysed by FC.\nAn appropriate isotype control was used to\nadjust for discarding a non-specific back-\nground signal. The results are reported as\nthe % of expression or as the geometric\nMFI. For each sample, at least 1,000 events\nwere acquired in an EPICS XL MCL\n(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).\nData were processed with WimMDI ver. 2.8\nfree software.\nMeasurement of sTREM by ELISA\nSupernatants from the groups were collected\nto determine sTREM-1 levels. The assay was\nperformed as described by the manufacturer\n(Quantikine\u00d5; R&D Systems). After stop\nsolution, optical density was determined\nusing a microplate reader (SynergyTM HT\nMulti-Mode Microplate Reader; BioTek\nInstruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA)\nwavelength correction. The concentration\nwas expressed in pg/mL.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as mean \u00c6 standard\ndeviation (SD).

We only included samples with\nappropriate characteristics for the study.\nPatients with insufficient urine samples\nwere excluded from the study. The remaining\n341 patients were excluded because they had\nother aggregated medical problems (infec-\ntious, oncological, immunological, cardio-\nvascular, gastrointestinal, and endocrine).\nThe medical centre where the research was\ncarried out is a national tertiary care centre.\nTherefore, UTI associated with other dis-\neases in children is the most common.\nThe collected samples corresponded to\nmedian age in both groups was 6 years\n(range, 1\u00ad15 years).

Only 80 samples\nwere processed because we encountered a\ntechnical problem during the thawing pro-\ncess in the remainder of the samples, which\ncould alter the outcome.\nDiscussion\nNeutrophils and monocytes/macrophages\nare the primary mediators of the innate\nimmune response to bacterial infection,\npromoting the release of proinflammatory\ncytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b. When\nthese cytokines are produced in excess, they\ncontribute to end-organ dysfunction and\noverwhelming sepsis. TREM-1, which is\npart of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is\nupregulated in response to bacteria or fungi.\nWhen TREM-1 is bound to a ligand, it\nstimulates the release of such cytokines via\nthe signal transduction molecule DAP12.\nThe soluble form of TREM-1 is shed from\nthe membranes of activated phagocytic cells\nand can be quantified in human body fluids.8\nSeveral studies have investigated the use\nof TREM-1 as a diagnostic biomarker\nand have shown it to be more sensitive and\nspecific than C-reactive protein (CRP) and\nprocalcitonin (PCT).8 Gibot et al.9 con-\nducted a study in 76 patients in whom\nsepsis was suspected. They found that\nplasma sTREM-1 levels were highly accurate\nat a cut-off level of \u00c660 ng/mL) for distin-\nguishing systemic inflammatory response\nsyndrome (SIRS) from sepsis or septic\nshock. The soluble form of TREM-1 was a\nsuperior diagnostic marker to PCT and CRP\nin their study. Our study was not designed\nwith the aim of determining TREM-1 sen-\nsitivity and specificity in urine. However, in\nurine, we found that 92% of patients with\nUTI presented TREM-1 percentages of\n>10%, while in the non-infected group,\nonly 35% presented similar levels. These\ndata suggest the usefulness of TREM-1 in\nurinary sediment cells as a potential diag-\nnostic test.\nSu and colleagues reported changes in the\nCRP during the course of sepsis, as well as\ntheir prediction of outcome in a group with\nSIRS (30 patients) and in a group with sepsis\nsepsis was further divided into survivor and\nnon-survivor groups. Serum markers and\nthe white blood cell (WBC) count were\nadmission to the intensive care unit (ICU),\nthe sepsis group showed higher levels of\ndid the SIRS group (p < 0.05). Although\nPCT and sTREM-1 are good markers for\nidentifying severity, sTREM-1 is more reli-\nable, and it is a risk factor related to sepsis.\nDuring a 14-day observation in previous\nlevels, and Sepsis-related Organ Failure\nAssessment scores continued to rise among\nnon-survivors, while their WBC and CRP\nlevels decreased. The authors concluded that\nsTREM-1 is more ideal for diagnosis of\nsepsis and determining severity, and consti-\nVan Bremen et al.12 examined the expres-\nand human leukocyte antigen-D related in\nblood monocytes and neutrophils using FC\nin 22 patients with E. coli sepsis and six\nhealthy controls. The authors found signifi-\ncantly higher expression of TREM-1 and\nTLR2 in monocytes and neutrophils in\npatients compared with the controls.\nTREM-1 expression tended to be higher\n(p \u00bc 0.07) in monocytes and lower in neu-\ntrophils of patients with severe sepsis com-\npared with controls. TREM-1 expression in\nneutrophils was associated with IL-10\nTNF-a inducibility (Lipopolysaccharide:\nthat there was an association of TREM-1\nexpression in neutrophils of patients with\nE. coli sepsis.\nThe diagnostic value of urinary sTREM-\n1 was studied by Long and co-workers\nin terms of identification of early sepsis,\nseverity, and prognosis, as well as secondary\nacute kidney injury (AKI). The authors\ncompared sTREM-1 with WBC, CRP,\nPCT, urine output, creatinine clearance\n(CCr), serum creatinine (SCr), and blood\nurea nitrogen (BUN). This study enrolled\n104 patients who had been admitted to the\nICU as follows: 16 patients with SIRS,\n35 with sepsis, and 53 with severe sepsis.\nResults for urinary sTREM-1 levels, WBC\ncount, serum CRP levels, and PTC levels\nwere diagnosed with associated AKI, com-\nparisons between their urine sTREM-1\nlevels, urine output, CCr, SCr levels, and\nBUN levels at diagnosis and 48 h prior to\ndiagnosis were carried out. On the day\nof admission to the ICU, the sepsis group\nhad higher urine sTREM-1 levels and Acute\nPhysiologic Assessment and Chronic Health\nEvaluation scores compared with the SIRS\ngroup (p < 0.05). The areas under the curve\nsTREM-1 levels, serum PCT levels, and\nthe WBC count were higher in the severe\nsepsis group compared with the sepsis group\nlevels continuously increased among non-\nsurvivors, while the WBC count and serum\nCRP levels in both groups declined. For the\n17 patients with AKI, urine sTREM-1, SCr,\nand BUN levels at 48 h prior to diagnosis of\nAKI were higher, and the CCr was lower\nthan those in non-AKI patients (p < 0.05).\nThe authors concluded that urine sTREM-1\ntesting is more sensitive than WBC, and\nserum CRP and PCT testing for early diag-\nnosis of sepsis, as well as for dynamic\nassessment of severity and prognosis.13\nOther authors, such as Derive and col-\nleagues, consider that urinary sTREM-1\ncould become a new biomarker for sepsis-\nassociated AKI.14 We found that sTREM-1\nanalysed by ELISA had a frequency of 25%\nin infected patients and 0% in non-infected\npatients. The strength of this study lies in\ndetermination of the TREM-1 fraction,\nwhich is joined with the cellular membrane,\nas well as determination of the MFI.\nThese variables have not been previously\nrelated to urinary infections in the paediatric\npopulation.\nA meta-analysis conducted by Jiyong\net al. evaluated the accuracy of sTREM-1\nfor diagnosis of bacterial infection. Studies\nfor inclusion in the meta-analysis were\nrequired to report an accepted test for\nsTREM-1 (ELISA). The analysis included\nbacterial infection and 423 with non-bacter-\nial infection). The global prevalence of UTI\na Q point value of 0.84. The sensitivity of the\nsTREM-1 assay for diagnosis of UTI was\nconcluded that sTREM-1 may be not a\nsufficient biological marker for UTI because\nof its low sensitivity.15 None of the studies\ndescribed in this meta-analysis reported\ndetermination of TREM-1 in urinary sedi-\nment cells or the MFI.\nJiyong et al.15 included only one experi-\nment in which sTREM was measured in\nurine. In Determann et al.'s study, urine\nsamples were collected from patients who\npresented at the emergency room with symp-\ntoms of lower or upper UTI. For inclusion in\nthe study, infection had to comprise the\npresence of leukocytes (>10 leukocytes per\nhigh-power field) and bacteria in the urine\nsediment. Samples were centrifuged at\nnatant was stored at \u00c080C. Levels of\nsTREM-1 were measured by ELISA (recov-\n20 pg/ml). Samples from 70 patients with\nUTI were analysed. Urine samples of\n10 healthy controls and of nine patients\nwith asymptomatic bacteriuria served as\ncontrols. Patients with UTI were 49 \u00c6 23\nyears old and 31 (44%) were male. Culture\nwas performed in 39 (56%) patients and was\npositive (!105 colony-forming units per ml)\nin all patients. Fifty-five patients presented\nwith lower UTI and 15 patients with pyelo-\nnephritis/urosepsis. Nineteen patients were\nimmunocompromised because of diabetes\nmellitus (n \u00bc 5), use of immunosuppres-\nsive drugs (n \u00bc 15), or haematological dis-\nease (n \u00bc 2). Urinary levels of sTREM-1\npatients with pyelonephritis/urosepsis.\nLevels of sTREM-1 ranged from undetect-\nable to 68 pg/ml in patients with upper UTI.\nThe authors calculated a specificity of 89%\nand a positive predictive value of 93% for\ndiscrimination between UTI and asymptom-\natic bacteriuria. However, sensitivity (19%)\nand negative predictive value (12%) were\nlow. sTREM-1 levels did not correlate with\nplasma PCR levels, plasma or urine leuko-\ncyte counts, or bacterial species cultured\nfrom urine. Five (26%) immunocomprom-\nised patients had detectable sTREM-1\nlevels, but these levels were not different\nwhen compared with those of non-immuno-\ncompromised patients (p \u00bc 0.13). The\nauthors concluded that sTREM-1 urine\nlevels were low to undetectable.15\nIn our study, notably, measurement of\nsTREM-1 was performed in two similar\ngroups (infected and non-infected).
