This study examined if older adults' psychological adjustment to widowhood varies based on whether\nthe death was sudden or anticipated and if these effects are mediated by death context characteristics (e.g., predeath care-\ngiving, nursing home use, spouse's age at death, and couple's communication about the death).\nMethods. The effects of forewarning on multiple indicators of mental health and grief were examined in a sample of\n210 widowed persons who participated in the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study. The CLOC is a proba-\nwith widowed persons reinterviewed 6, 18, and 48 months after spousal loss.\nResults. Forewarning did not affect depression, anger, shock, or overall grief 6 or 18 months after the loss. Pro-\nlonged forewarning was associated with elevated anxiety both 6 and 18 months after the death. Sudden spousal death el-\nevated survivors' intrusive thoughts at the 6-month follow-up only. Sudden death was associated with slightly higher\nlevels of yearning among women but significantly lower yearning among men both 6 and 18 months after the loss.\nDiscussion. The findings call into question the widespread belief that grief is more severe if death is sudden and sug-\ngest a more complex relationship between bereavement and circumstances of spousal death.\nIDOWHOOD is among the most stressful of life\nevents (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). The psychological\nconsequences of widowhood vary widely, however, based\non characteristics of the survivor (Matthews, 1991; Stroebe\nlationship (Carr et al., 2000). The context of the loss--includ-\ning whether the death was sudden or the endpoint of a long\nand lingering illness--is also an important influence on pat-\nstudies have explored whether sudden or anticipated deaths\nare more distressing for bereaved spouses, but this research\nis inconclusive and does not specifically address the unique\ncircumstances of elderly bereaved persons. Understanding\nthe linkage between death forewarning and older widowed\npersons' well-being is critically important today because\nchronic illnesses, or ongoing conditions for which there is no\ncure, account for the majority of older adults' deaths (McLe-\nadvances in medical technology that delay late-life mortality\nmean that the interval between diagnosis and death is length-\nening. It is thus critically important that scholars and practi-\ntioners understand how this \"living-dying interval\" affects\nTheoretical Issues\nThe proposition that sudden deaths are more difficult for\nfamily members to cope with than anticipated deaths was\nfirst suggested in Lindemann's (1944) classic article, \"Symp-\ntomatology and Management of Acute Grief.\" Spouses of\nthe men serving in World War II experienced grief-like\nsymptoms (or anticipatory grief) before their spouses actu-\nally died, but they managed to emotionally disengage in an-\nticipation of their spouses' deaths, and thus did not appear\nto be highly grief-stricken upon the actual death. In contrast,\nthe relatives of young adults killed suddenly in a nightclub\nfire suffered severe grief symptoms (Lindemann, 1944).\nBuilding upon this work, many grief scholars have con-\ncluded that individuals who anticipate their spouse's death\nwill use the forewarning period to prepare psychologically\nand practically for the transition to widowhood. Although\nspouses may exhibit grief-like symptoms during the pre-\ndeath period, their postloss adjustment is believed to be bet-\nter than those who experienced a sudden loss (Gerber, 1974,\nEmpirical studies examining the effect of death forewarn-\ning on widowed persons' psychological adjustment are in-\nconclusive, however. Many studies have suggested that sud-\nden spousal death is associated with poorer psychological\nadjustment among widowed persons (Ball, 1977; Carey,\nThompson, & Gallagher, 1988; Jacobs, Kasl, & Ostfeld,\nA smaller group of studies has found the reverse--that fore-\nwarning is linked to poorer adjustment among widowed\nW\npersons (Fengler & Goodrich, 1979; Gerber, Rusalem, Han-\nChalmers, Conroy, Farris, & Markush, 1975). A third group\nof studies has found no relationship between death fore-\nwarning and survivors' psychological adjustment (Bowling &\nCartwright, 1982; Clayton, Halikas, Maurice, & Robins,\nWe believe that there are four reasons for these inconclu-\nsive findings. First, few studies have explicitly acknowl-\nedged that the age of the deceased may condition the effects\nof forewarning on widowed persons' well-being. Second,\nthe larger context of the death has rarely been considered\n(Sweeting & Gilhooly, 1990); stressors associated with\ndeath forewarning, such as the strain of caregiving, may can-\ncel out the gains presumably provided by the period of pre-\nThird, a diverse set of outcome measures and inconsistent\ndefinitions of sudden versus anticipated death have been\nused, thus limiting the comparability of findings across stud-\nies. Finally, most past research has relied on cross-sectional\nrather than longitudinal data; thus, baseline demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics that may affect both death\ntiming and psychological adjustment have been neglected.\nDeath Forewarning Among Older Adults\nSurprisingly few studies have examined the effects of\nsudden versus anticipated death on older widowed persons'\nwell-being. Rather, most research has focused on premature\nor \"off-time\" widowhood among young and midlife adults\net al., 1976). Other studies have focused solely on sudden\ndeaths occurring under particularly horrific circumstances\nsuch as murders (Rynearson, 1984) or suicides (Calhoun &\nand violent deaths are considered the most difficult to cope\nis not clear whether the deleterious effects of such losses are\ndue to suddenness, life stage, or a combination thereof (i.e.,\nsudden and premature death).\nFor older adults (i.e., aged 65 and older), even \"sudden\"\ndeaths may be anticipated and viewed as timely (Neugarten &\nHagestad, 1976). Given that predictable life transitions are\npresumed to be less stressful than unexpected ones (George,\n1983), a sudden spousal death may be no more difficult for\nthe elderly survivor than death following a long period of\nMoreover, sudden spousal deaths are more likely to be an-\nticipated by older women than older men. Because of men's\nmortality disadvantage, women aged 65 and older outnum-\nber their male peers by roughly 1.5 to 1 (U.S. Bureau of the\nand older are widowed, compared with 14% of men. Noting\nthe gender gap in mortality, Neugarten and Hagestad (1976)\nobserved that women may go through a rehearsal for wid-\nowhood as they observe their peers experience the loss of\nspouse (Fooken, 1985). Consequently, sudden death may have\na more deleterious effect on the well-being of men than\nwomen, because older women are more likely to anticipate\nthe death of their spouse (Hill et al., 1988).\nDeath Context and Forewarning\nA second reason for the inconclusiveness of past studies\nis that empirical analyses have rarely controlled important\ncontextual factors related to the death, which may counter-\nact or suppress the effects of death timing. For instance, al-\nthough prolonged forewarning periods may allow spouses\nto prepare psychologically and practically for the loss (Ka-\ncompanied by difficult caregiving duties (Anashensel, Pear-\nlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlach, 1995; George & Gwyther,\ntional isolation from family members and friends (Kramer,\nrelated to the \"extended death watch\" period (Gerber et al.,\n1975) may be particularly difficult for older adults because\nof their age and accompanying health problems (Averill\nContextual factors associated with death forewarning also\nmight be associated with better spousal adjustment (O'Bry-\nant, 1990\u00ad91). Caregiving may increase closeness with an ill\nrelative (Hinrichsen, Hernandez, & Pollack, 1992; Vachon et\npurpose to the caregiver (O'Bryant, Straw, & Meddaugh,\nprolonged illnesses are more likely to reside in nursing homes\n(Foner, 1994), and thus their spouses may make a smoother\ntransition to widowhood. The institutionalization process has\nbeen characterized as \"quasi-widowhood,\" because spouses\nhave considerably reduced daily contact and communication,\nmay emotionally separate from one another, and are spared\nthe daily stresses of direct caregiving (DeSpelder & Strick-\nanalyses included three important indicators of death context\nthat may mediate (or counteract and hence suppress) the ef-\nfect of death timing on widowed persons' adjustment: age of\nspouse at death, whether the deceased was living in a nursing\nhome prior to death, and whether the survivor provided care\nprior to their spouse's death.\nKnowledge about the impending death also may affect\nthe couple's interactions during the ill spouse's last days.\nCouples who anticipate a death may use the forewarning pe-\nriod to make practical plans for the survivor's economic and\nsocial adjustment, thus enabling a smoother transition to\nwidowhood (Rando, 1986). Moreover, couples who use the\ntime between diagnosis and death to resolve emotional \"un-\nfinished business\" (Blauner, 1966) may find their relation-\nships strengthened in the final days. Bereaved persons who\nwere by their ailing spouse's side at the moment they died\nhave been found to cope better with the loss than those who\ndid not reach such closure (Bennett & Vidal-Hall, 2000;\nno studies that have empirically assessed whether these be-\nhaviors mediate the relationship between death forewarning\nand psychological adjustment. Thus, our analyses included\nindicators of whether the couple talked about how the survi-\nvor would cope with being alone and whether the survivor\nwas with his or her spouse at the moment he or she died.\nMeasuring Death Forewarning and Adaptation to Loss\nThe discrepant results in past studies may reflect differ-\nences in the conceptualization and measurement of both in-\ndependent and dependent variables (Sweeting & Gilhooly,\n1990). The operationalization of sudden versus anticipated\ndeath has varied across studies. Sudden deaths have in-\ncluded those where the deceased was dead on arrival at the\nhospital (Carey, 1979\u00ad80), as well as those where the survi-\nwarning. As noted earlier, still other studies have consid-\nered sudden deaths to be synonymous with violent deaths\nsuch as suicides, murders, or accidents (Calhoun & Allen,\ning also vary, from 1 month (Bornstein, Clayton, Halikas,\nThe dependent variables used across studies also are di-\nverse, ranging from self-report of medical symptoms (Ger-\nber et al., 1975) to depressive symptomatology (Clayton et al.,\nstudies have focused on specific symptoms, such as anger,\nyet most have focused on global indicators of mental health\nClayton, Desmarais, & Winokur, 1968; Fulton & Fulton,\n1971). Consequently, findings purported to characterize the\ngeneral link between forewarning and adjustment instead\nmay be specific to particular outcomes.\nWe believe that psychological adjustment to loss encom-\npasses a complex set of emotional, cognitive, and behav-\nioral reactions. Thus, we explored the effect of death fore-\nwarning and sudden death on five loss-related (i.e., shock,\nanger, yearning, intrusive thoughts, and overall grief) and two\ngeneral (i.e., depression and anxiety) dimensions of psycho-\nlogical adjustment both 6 and 18 months after the death.\nMoreover, rather than operationalizing sudden death and\nprolonged forewarning a priori, we empirically evaluated\ndiverse measures of each construct to ascertain the specific\nnature of the relationship between death forewarning and\nadjustment of older adults. Drawing on past research and\ntheory, we evaluated three possible relationships: sudden\ndeath effects only, linear effects of warning time, and curvi-\nlinear effects of warning time. Thus, our analyses evaluated\nwhether a particular parameterization of forewarning better\npredicts widowed persons' psychological adjustment.\nOther Influences on Psychological Adjustment and\nSpousal Loss\nFinally, our research addressed the possibility that pre-\nloss characteristics might affect both the suddenness and con-\ntext of spousal death, as well as adjustment to the loss, hence\ncreating a spurious relationship between them. Because we\nhad baseline data prior to actual widowhood, we could con-\ntrol for important baseline (or prewidowhood) characteris-\ntics. First, we controlled baseline mental health, to help dis-\ntinguish the spouse's affective state prior to the death and\nchange in affective state that occurred following the death\ntrolled baseline demographic characteristics (age and sex)\nand socioeconomic status (education, income, and home\nownership), because these characteristics have been linked\nto both death context (e.g., younger persons and women are\nmore likely to have their spouses die suddenly) and later\npsychological adjustment. Finally, respondent's physical\nhealth at baseline was controlled, because it may influence\nboth how the spouse manages stressors related to the death\ntiming and psychological adjustment following the death\nIn sum, our research had three objectives: first, to identify\nthe relationship between death forewarning and widowed\npersons' psychological adjustment 6 and 18 months after the\nloss, adjusting for psychological adjustment and other charac-\nteristics prior to widowhood; second, to assess whether and\nhow the relationship between death forewarning and wid-\nowed persons' well-being differs for men and women; and\nthird, to evaluate the extent to which the effect of death fore-\nwarning is mediated or suppressed by death context charac-\nteristics. Analyses were based on data from the Changing\nLives of Older Couples (CLOC) survey, a prospective study\nof a sample of married individuals aged 65 and older.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe CLOC study is a prospective study of a two-stage\narea probability sample of 1,532 married individuals from\nthe Detroit Standardized Metropolitan Statistical Area. To be\neligible for the study, respondents had to be English-speak-\ning members of a married couple where the husband was\naged 65 or older. All sample members were noninstitution-\nalized and were capable of participating in a 2-hr-long inter-\nview. The original researchers oversampled women in an\neffort to maximize the number of respondents who would\nexperience bereavement during the study period. Baseline\nface-to-face interviews were conducted from June 1987\nthrough April 1988. The response rate for the baseline inter-\nview was 68%, which is consistent with the response rate\nfrom other Detroit area studies in that period.\nThe CLOC researchers monitored spousal loss using\nmonthly death record tapes provided by the State of Michi-\ngan and by reading the daily obituaries in Detroit-area\nnewspapers. Researchers used the National Death Index and\ndirect ascertainment of death certificates to confirm deaths\nand obtain causes of death. Of the 335 respondents known\nto have lost a spouse during the study, 316 were contacted\nfor possible interview (19 persons, or 6%, had died during\nticipated in at least one of the three follow-up interviews,\nwhich were conducted 6 months (Wave 1), 18 months\n(Wave 2), and 48 months (Wave 3) after the spouse's death.\nWave 1 analyses were based on the 250 widowed persons\nup, or 79% of the 316 living respondents who lost a spouse.\nWave 2 analyses were based on the 184 widowed persons\n(159 women and 25 men) who were also interviewed at the\nwho were interviewed at Wave 1 and still alive at Wave 2.\nWe weighted the data to adjust for unequal probabilities of\nselection and differential response rate at baseline. The final\nweighted analytic sample for Waves 1 and 2 comprised 210\nowed persons (110 women and 45 men), respectively.\nThe issue of selective attrition deserves mention. If persons\nwho failed to participate in the followup interviews were sig-\nnificantly different from those who did participate (in terms\nof baseline characteristics) then caution should be taken in\ngeneralizing findings to the larger population of elderly wid-\nowed persons. Thus, we estimated logistic regression models\nto predict the correlates of widowed persons' nonparticipa-\ntion in the Wave 1 and Wave 2 interviews. For models pre-\ndicting Wave 1 nonparticipation, baseline demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics, physical and mental health,\nand spouse's physical health were evaluated as predictors.\nAge and baseline anxiety increased risk of nonparticipation,\nand home ownership significantly decreased one's risk of\nnonparticipation. For models predicting Wave 2 nonpartici-\npation (given that one participated in the Wave 1 interview),\nsudden death; months of forewarning; baseline demographic,\nphysical, and mental health; and Wave 1 levels of grief were\nevaluated as predictors. Not one variable was a significant\npredictor (p  .05) of attrition at Wave 2. Caution should be\ntaken in generalizing findings to the population at large, be-\ncause older, more anxious, and the residentially mobile per-\nsons may be underrepresented in the analytic sample.\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--Two general (i.e., depression\nand anxiety) and five loss-related (i.e., shock, anger, yearn-\ning, intrusive thoughts, and overall grief) dimensions of\npsychological adjustment at the 6-month and 18-month fol-\nlow-ups are considered. Depression (  .83) was assessed\nwith a subset of nine negative items from the 20-item Cen-\nter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale\n(Radloff, 1977). In the CES-D, respondents are asked to in-\ndicate how often they experienced each symptom in the\nweek prior to interview. Response categories are \"hardly\never,\" \"some of the time,\" or \"most of the time.\" The nine\nsymptoms are (a) I felt depressed; (b) I felt that everything I\ndid was an effort; (c) My sleep was restless; (d) I felt lonely;\n(e) People were unfriendly; (f) I did not feel like eating; My\nappetite was poor; (g) I felt sad; (h) I felt that people dis-\nliked me; and (i) I could not \"get going.\"\nAnxiety (  .86) was assessed with 10 items from the\nRespondents are asked to indicate how often they have ex-\nperienced each of 10 symptoms in the week prior to inter-\nview. Response categories are \"not at all,\" \"a little bit,\"\n\"moderately,\" \"quite a bit,\" and \"extremely.\" Symptoms in-\nclude being bothered by (a) nervousness or shakiness; (b)\ntrembling; (c) feeling suddenly scared for no reason; (d)\nfeeling fearful; (e) heart pounding or racing; (f) feeling\ntense and keyed up; (g) spells of terror and panic; (h) feeling\nso restless you could not sit still; (i) feeling that something\nbad is going to happen to you; and (j) thoughts and images\nof a frightening nature.\nPsychological reactions specific to the loss, as well as an\noverarching grief scale, were also considered. The four\ncomponents of grief we considered were shock, anger, yearn-\ning, and intrusive thoughts. Shock (  .77) was evaluated\nwith three questions: In the last month, (a) have you felt as\nthough you were in a state of shock; (b) have you felt as\nthough you couldn't believe what was happening; and (c)\nhave you felt emotionally numb? Anger (  .68) was as-\nsessed with three questions: In the past month, (a) have you\nfelt resentful or bitter about your spouse's death; (b) have\nyou felt that the death of your spouse was unfair; and (c)\nhave you felt anger toward God? Yearning (  .75) was\nassessed with four questions: In the last month, (a) have you\nfound yourself longing to have your spouse with you; (b)\nhave you had painful waves of missing your spouse; (c)\nhave you experienced feelings of intense pain or grief over\nthe loss of your spouse; and (d) have you experienced feel-\nings of grief, loneliness, or missing your spouse? We evalu-\nated intrusive thoughts (  .66) with three questions: In\nthe past month, (a) have you had difficulty falling asleep be-\ncause thoughts about your spouse kept coming into your\nmind; (b) have you tried to block out memories or thoughts\nof your spouse; and (c) have you been unable to get\nthoughts about your spouse out of your mind?\nGrief (  .85) was the average of the four subscale\nscores. Response categories for all grief scale items were\n\"no, never\"; \"yes, but rarely\"; \"yes, sometimes\"; and \"yes,\noften.\" Items were drawn from widely used grief scales in-\ncluding the Bereavement Index (Jacobs, Kasl, & Ostfeld,\n1986), Present Feelings About Loss (Singh & Raphael,\n1981), and Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (Zisook,\nDevaul, & Click, 1982). Each of the dependent variables\nwas standardized for ease of interpretation and comparison\nacross indicators and thus had a mean of 0 and a standard\ndeviation of 1.\nIndependent variables.--The central independent vari-\nable in the analysis was warning time prior to death, evalu-\nated retrospectively at the Wave 1 interview with the ques-\ntion, \"How long before your spouse's death did you realize\nthat s/he was going to die?\" Respondents could report the\nduration in hours, days, weeks, months, years or \"no warn-\ning/minutes.\" The number of months of warning time was\nused as the independent variable. Months were top-coded at\n24, because more than 90% of widowed persons said that\nthey had fewer than 2 years of warning. Sudden death was a\ndummy variable indicating those who had \"no warning/\nminutes\" prior to their spouse's death (33% of sample). We\ndid not separately consider the effects of violent sudden\ndeaths (e.g., suicide or murder), because fewer than 2% died\nin this manner. Prolonged forewarning was a dummy vari-\nable indicating those who had more than 6 months of warn-\ning prior to their spouse's death (28% of sample). The refer-\nence group is persons with less than 6 months of warning.\nDeath context.--Because both the psychological conse-\nquences of loss and warning time may be associated with\nother conditions of the death, we controlled three additional\ncharacteristics of the spouse's death: (a) spouse's age at\ndeath (in years), and dichotomous variables indicating (b)\nwhether the respondent was providing care to his or her\nspouse in the 6 months prior to the death, and (c) whether\nthe spouse was residing in a nursing home prior to death.\nCommunication about death was evaluated at Wave 1\nwith the question, \"Did you and [your spouse] talk about\nhow you would deal with being on your own once she or he\nwas gone?\" Closure was evaluated with the question, \"Were\nyou there with your [husband/wife] at the moment when\n[she/he] died?\" Positive responses were coded as 1.\nConfounding factors.--Depression and anxiety at base-\nline were measured exactly as described earlier (Derogatis &\nat baseline was assessed with the question \"How would you\nrate your health at the present time? Would you say it is ex-\ncellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" Responses of \"fair\"\nand \"poor\" were coded 1, and all others were coded as 0.\nDemographic variables.--Control variables included\nage, sex (1  female), home ownership at baseline (1  owns\nhome), total household income at baseline (natural log of in-\ncome), and education (a continuous measure ranging from 3\nto 17 or more years of completed schooling). We measured\nthe total household income variable by having respondents\nindicate which of 10 income categories most accurately char-\nacterized their economic status. We derived a continuous\nmeasure of income by taking the midpoint of each of the 10\nincome categories, with Pareto estimation of the mean for the\ntop income category. The natural log of income was used be-\ncause the respondents' income distribution was skewed, with\nmost respondents in the lower income categories. A final de-\nmographic characteristic--race--was not considered in this\nanalysis. Preliminary analyses revealed that race (where 1 \nBlack) was not a significant predictor of the outcomes vari-\nables, nor did the effects of forewarning differ by race.\nFinally, we controlled for the duration (in months) between\nthe baseline and Wave 1 interviews. Although all Wave 1 in-\nterviews were conducted 6 months following spousal death,\nthe duration between the baseline and Wave 1 interviews\nranged from 9 to 76 months because of variation in the timing\nof spouse's death. Thus, baseline assessments were more tem-\nporally distant for those who lost their spouses at later dates.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nDescriptive statistics and t tests comparing means for\nmen and women are presented in Table 1. Men and women\ndid not differ from one another in terms of anxiety, yearn-\ning, or intrusive thoughts 6 or 18 months following their\nloss. Death forewarning did not differ significantly by gen-\nder; roughly one third of widowed persons experienced no\nforewarning of their spouse's death, and another one third\nreported more than 6 months of warning. The average warn-\ning time was 5\u00ad6 months.\nMen and women did differ in terms of the context sur-\nrounding their spouse's death. Men were significantly more\nlikely than women to report that their spouse was residing in\na nursing home prior to death (14% vs 2%) and that they\nwere with their spouse at the exact moment they died (54%\nvs 40%). One fifth of women and 12% of men reported that\nthey had discussed with their spouse how they would cope\nwith being on their own. Similar proportions of men and\nwomen (44% and 50%, respectively) reported providing\ncare to their spouse in the months prior to death. Few demo-\ngraphic characteristics differed by gender, except that men\nin the CLOC were significantly older at baseline than the\nTable 1.

At baseline, women had significantly higher levels\nof anxiety than men.\nInfluence of Death Forewarning on Mental Health\nOur first two objectives of the multivariate analysis were\n(a) to specify the relationship between death forewarning\nand widowed persons' psychological adjustment 6 and 18\nmonths after their loss and (b) to assess whether these pat-\nterns differ by gender. To address the first objective, we re-\ngressed each of four different measures of forewarning on\ntwo general (i.e., depression and anxiety) and five loss-\nrelated (yearning, shock, anger, intrusive thoughts, and a\ncomposite grief measure) indicators of psychological ad-\njustment at both 6 and 18 months after the death. The four\nmodels evaluated were (a) sudden death effects only, mea-\nsured with a dichotomous indicator of sudden death; (b) lin-\near effects of warning time, measured with a continuous in-\ndicator of months of warning time (from 1 to 24 months)\nand a dichotomous indicator of sudden death; (c) curvilinear\neffects of warning time, measured with a continuous indica-\ntor of months of warning time, months of warning time\nsquared, and a dichotomous indicator of sudden death; and\n(d) effects of sudden death and very prolonged warning\ntime, measured with dichotomous indicators representing\nsudden death and warning time of more than 6 months;\nwarning time of less than 6 months was the reference cate-\ngory. (In preliminary analyses, more fine-grained cutpoints\nwere evaluated. However, the model including just two di-\nchotomous indicators for no warning versus more than six\nmonths warning best fit the data--as evidenced by adjusted\nr2 values.) To achieve the second objective, all models were\nestimated including interaction terms of sex by death fore-\nwarning. All models controlled demographic characteristics\nand respondent's baseline physical and mental health.\n(Complete models are not shown but are available from the\nfirst author.) Models with significant effects of warning\ntime are presented in Tables 2\u00ad4.\nTable 2.

First, the effect of death forewarning on survivors'\nwell-being was far weaker than past research has suggested.\nConsidering only those models that parameterized fore-\nwarning with two dummy variables, we tested 14 models\n(i.e., seven dependent variables each at two follow-ups)\nwith two forewarning indicators in each model. Of these,\nonly two models produced significant effects--each includ-\ning one of the forewarning dummy variables. These effects\nare probably greater than expected by chance but indicate\nvery limited effects of forewarning on reactions to widow-\nhood among older adults.\nSecond, when death forewarning did significantly affect\npsychological adjustment, its effect differed across out-\ncomes. Death forewarning--regardless of how operational-\nized--was unrelated to four (i.e., depression, grief, shock,\nand anger) of the seven possible outcomes at both the 6- and\n18-month follow-up. Even when potential counterbalancing\nor suppressor variables (i.e., death context and communica-\ntion) were added to the regression equation, warning time\nwas not a significant predictor of any of the four outcomes.\nSudden death significantly increased intrusive thoughts 6\nmonths after the loss, although the effect was no longer sig-\nnificant at the 18-month follow-up (Table 2). Prolonged\nforewarning (i.e., more than 6 months of forewarning) was\nassociated with elevated anxiety both 6 and 18 months after\nthe loss (Table 3).\nThird, gender differences in the effect of forewarning\nwere significant for just one of the seven outcomes: yearn-\ning. At both the 6- and 18-month follow-ups, sudden death\n(compared with anticipated death) was associated with\nslightly higher yearning scores among women and consider-\nably lower yearning scores among men at both interviews\n(Table 4).\nTable 3. Ordinary Least Squares Regression Predicting Effects of Forewarning, Death Context, and Communication About Death on\nAnxiety, 6 Months Anxiety, 18 Months\nWarning Time Indicators\nDemographic Characteristics\nBaseline Well-Being\nDeath Context\nCommunication About Death\nNote: Number of months between baseline and Wave 1 interview controlled in all models.\nDeath Context and Communication as Mediators of\nDeath Forewarning Effects\nTo better understand the effect of death forewarning on\nanxiety, yearning, and intrusive thoughts, we expanded base-\nline models (Model 1) to include two sets of possible media-\ntor (or suppressor) variables: death context (Model 2) and\ncommunication (Model 3) variables. Tables 2\u00ad4 show re-\ngression results for intrusive thoughts (Table 2), anxiety\n(Table 3), and yearning (Table 4). Separate models were es-\ntimated for the 6- and 18-month outcomes.\nIntrusive Thoughts\nSudden death was associated with elevated levels of in-\ntrusive thoughts 6 months after the loss. The effect of death\nsuddenness increased when death context and communica-\ntion indicators were controlled. When only demographic\nand baseline health characteristics were controlled (Model\n1), sudden death was associated with a .316 standard devia-\ntion increase in intrusive thoughts (p  .05). When death\ncontext variables were adjusted, the effect of sudden death\nincreased to .39 standard deviations. Few of the death con-\ntext variables had direct effects on intrusive thoughts, al-\nthough having been with one's spouse at the moment of\ndeath protected against high levels of intrusive thoughts (b \nwas positively and significantly related to intrusive thoughts;\nthose with higher levels of anxiety prior to their spouse's\ndeath had elevated levels of intrusive thoughts 6 months af-\nter the death.\nIn general, death forewarning, context, and demographic\nfactors were relatively weak predictors of intrusive thoughts;\nthe final model explained only 6% of the variance in Wave\n1 intrusive thoughts. By Wave 2, intrusive thoughts were no\nlonger significantly linked to sudden death. Although the\nTable 4.

Persons who discussed\nthe death with their spouse and those whose spouses resided\nin nursing homes had significantly lower levels of intrusive\nthoughts.\nAnxiety\nAs shown in Table 3, having more than 6 months of fore-\nwarning was a positive and significant predictor of anxiety\nlevels both 6 and 18 months after the death. The effect of\nprolonged forewarning was not mediated by death context\nor communication variables; rather, the effect was sup-\npressed by these factors. The effects of death forewarning,\ndeath context, and demographic factors on anxiety were\nsimilar at both the 6- and 18-month follow-ups, and the\namount of variance explained was the same at both time\npoints.\nThe baseline model (Model 1) revealed that prolonged\nforewarning was associated with a .37 standard deviation\nincrease in anxiety levels at Wave 1, and this effect in-\ncreased when death context variables were considered. The\nbaseline model predicting Wave 2 anxiety showed a posi-\ntive (though not statistically significant) effect of prolonged\ndeath on anxiety. However, when death context factors\nwere considered, this effect increased from .24 to .32 and\nwas significant at the p  .05 level. Individuals whose\nspouses resided in a nursing home prior to death had signif-\nicantly lower anxiety levels at both waves. Communication\nabout the death and being with one's spouse at death were\nunrelated to anxiety levels both 6 and 18 months after the\ndeath.\nYearning\nAs shown in Table 4, sudden deaths were associated with\nreduced yearning among men and somewhat elevated\nyearning among women at both the 6- and 18-month inter-\nviews. The first row of coefficients represents the effect of\nsudden death among men, and the second row represents the\ninteraction term or the difference between women and men\nin the effect of sudden death. When only demographic and\nhealth variables were controlled (Model 1), sudden death\nwas associated with a .67 standard deviation reduction in\nmen's yearning levels and a .10 standard deviation increase\n(i.e., from .67 to .77) in women's yearning levels at the\n6-month follow-up (compared with those whose spouses\ndied after a warning period). Interestingly, the effect of sud-\nden death on men's yearning was partially mediated by\ndeath context and communication characteristics, yet the ef-\nfect of sudden death on women's yearning was suppressed\nby these factors. Of the three death context variables, only\none was (marginally) significant: Having provided care for\none's spouse prior to death was associated with an increase\n(b  .27) in yearning 6 months after the loss.\nAt the 18-month follow-up, the general patterns docu-\nmented at Wave 1 persisted although effects were weaker.\nAt Wave 2, men whose wives died suddenly continued to\nhave yearning scores roughly .5 standard deviations lower\nthan widowed men who had some forewarning. Women\nwhose spouses died suddenly had yearning levels that were\nroughly .2 standard deviations higher than widows who had\nbeen forewarned. Gender differences in the effect of fore-\nwarning remained significant at the p  .05 level.\nDISCUSSION\nResearchers have conducted many studies to determine\nwhether sudden or anticipated deaths are more distressing to\nthe bereaved. Although findings have been inconsistent\nacross studies, the majority of such work has concluded that\nsudden deaths are more difficult for the survivor than antici-\n1987). Our study of grief among elderly widowed persons\nhas shown that the protective effects of death forewarning\non survivors' mental health--found in earlier research--\nmay be overstated. Our findings also suggest that research-\ners should no longer ask the question, \"Does death fore-\nwarning affect psychological adjustment among widowed\npersons?\" Rather, the more appropriate questions are \"Which\ndimensions of psychological adjustment are affected by\ndeath forewarning?\" and \"For whom does death forewarn-\ning affect psychological well-being?\"\nFirst, our analyses reveal that death forewarning is not a\nsignificant predictor of broad mental health outcomes such\nas depression and overall grief either 6 or 18 months follow-\ning the loss. These findings are consistent with past studies\nshowing that broad measures of negative affect such as de-\npression are unrelated to death forewarning (Ball, 1977;\nprise distinctive emotional, cognitive, physiological, and\nbehavioral symptoms, and these distinct symptoms may\nrespond in very different ways to death forewarning. Our\nsubscale analyses reveal that sudden death is associated\nwith elevated intrusive thoughts yet reduced anxiety. Con-\nsequently, these competing effects may cancel out one an-\nother when an aggregate scale such as grief is considered as\na dependent variable.\nOur analyses also show that death forewarning is not a\nsignificant predictor of postloss shock and anger. Because\nshock and anger are believed to be immediate reactions to\nmeasurements obtained 6 months after the death may be too\nlate to evidence effects. Death forewarning may also be un-\nrelated to shock and anger in an older population, given that\nwidowhood is a normative and anticipated transition among\nolder adults (Neugarten & Hagestad, 1976).\nSecond, sudden deaths are associated with elevated levels\nof intrusive thoughts. Survivors whose spouses died sud-\ndenly have elevated levels of intrusive thoughts 6 months\nafter the loss, although the effect fades by the 18-month fol-\nlow-up. These findings are consistent with research examin-\ning symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among\nthe bereaved. (Intrusive thoughts are believed to be similar\nconceptually to PTSD, where unprovoked painful thoughts\nabout the deceased plague the survivor of a sudden or\nshocking loss; Archer, 1999.) Recent studies have revealed\nthat individuals who lose family members to violent deaths\n(accident, suicide, or homicide) are much more likely to\nmeet the criteria for PTSD than those whose relatives die of\nother conditions (Zisook, Chentsova-Dutton, & Schuchter,\nbers of murder victims report higher levels of intrusive\nthoughts than relatives of persons who die naturally (Ry-\nnearson & McCreery, 1993). Our analysis shows further\nthat the effect of sudden death on intrusive thoughts is no\nlonger significant by the 18-month follow-up, consistent\nwith the observation that intrusive thoughts will fade over\ntime, as the widowed person becomes enmeshed in other ac-\ntivities and relationships (Parkes, 1985; Parkes & Brown,\nThird, prolonged forewarning increases survivors' anxi-\nety levels both 6 and 18 months following the death. The\nharmful effects of advanced forewarning (i.e., more than 6\nmonths) are suppressed by death context and communica-\ntion characteristics; thus past studies that omitted controls\nfor death context characteristics may have underestimated\nthe effect of advanced forewarning on elderly survivor's\nanxiety. Our analyses also show that the harmful effects of\nadvanced forewarning cannot be explained away by care-\ngiving, couple communication, spouse's age at death, or\nwhether one's spouse resided in a nursing home prior to\ndeath. Grief scholars thus face the task of identifying why\nand how prolonged forewarning periods lead to elevated\nanxiety among older adults.\nSociological research on chronic stressors provides a\nstarting point for this inquiry. Chronic (or long-term) stres-\nsors, such as caregiving or watching a spouse suffer from a\ndebilitating illness, are believed to be more difficult for psy-\nchological adjustment than stressors of shorter duration\na review). The psychological effects of a chronic stressor\nmay be compounded when experienced in conjunction with\nconcurrent or successive stressors (Holmes & Rahe, 1967;\nJohnson & Catalano, 1983). Spouses who spend prolonged\nperiods anticipating their spouse's death are presumably at a\ngreater risk of experiencing concurrent stressors than those\nwhose anticipation periods are confined to a shorter time\nframe. By incorporating indicators of other prewidowhood\nstressors into future analyses, the pathways linking pro-\nlonged forewarning and survivors' elevated anxiety levels\nmay become more apparent.\nFourth, the relationship between sudden death and yearn-\ning differs significantly for men and women. Sudden death\npredicts a slight increase in women's yearning, a finding\nthat is generally consistent with past clinical research re-\nvealing that sudden death is linked to poor adjustment to\nthat this finding converges with past research on the effects\nof forewarning, given that the overwhelming majority of\nstudies examining the psychological consequences of late-\nlife widowhood focus on samples of women only (e.g. Lo-\nHowever, it is surprising that sudden death reduces\nyearning for men, yet has only a small harmful effect for\nwomen. We had expected the reverse: Because women are\nmore likely than men to be widowed, they may be better\nprepared for the transition--even if it occurs suddenly\n(Neugarten & Hagestad, 1976). The harmful effects of death\nforewarning on men's yearning may instead reflect gender\ndifferences in how individuals respond to their partner's end\nof life experiences. For men, the forewarning period may be\nassociated with increased closeness to the spouse and isola-\ntion from others. During this time, men may become even\nmore emotionally bonded to their spouse, at the expense of\nrelationships with others. Given gender differences in mor-\ntality, men may have few same-sex peers who are also\nawaiting an ill wife's death. In contrast, women may rely on\ntheir female friends' direct experience with spousal illness\nto help them through the difficult dying process and thereaf-\nWhy do the effects of forewarning differ by sex for yearn-\ning only? This pattern may reflect the fact that yearning is\nthe only subdimension of grief that is explicitly relational\nand thus may reflect gender differences in how spousal rela-\ntionships unfold during the predeath period. Intrusive thoughts,\nin contrast, reflect the cognitive process of stimulus-inde-\npendent thoughts (Archer, 1999, p. 65), and anxiety reflects\nworries about coping with daily experiences.\nIn sum, our findings suggest that among older adults,\nsudden spousal death does not have far-reaching deleterious\neffects on mental health, except for increasing intrusive\nthoughts during the first 6 months after widowhood. Pro-\nlonged periods of anticipating a spouse's death are also not\ngenerally deleterious, but they do seem to increase anxiety\nfor both men and women and yearning among men only.\nThese gender-specific effects may be due to the different\nexperiences of men and women in caring for and relating to\na dying spouse. Future research is needed to more ade-\nquately understand the limited but real effects found here\nand to explore the degree to which other characteristics of\nthe deceased, the surviving spouse, the marital relationship,\nand the social context condition the ways in which older\nadults respond to widowhood and its forewarning.\n"
