Hennekens, MD, DrPH\nheart failure (CHF), an impor-\ntant cause of morbidity and mor-\ntality, will increase with the ag-\ning of the US population. The incidence\nof CHF doubles in each decade after the\nage of 45 years, and CHF is the leading\nhospital diagnosis in those older than 65\nyears.1 Risk factors such as hypertension\nhave been well described.2 However, data\nare sparse regarding other risk factors for\nCHF specifically in the elderly.\nPulse pressure (PP), measured as the\ndifference between systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP), rises markedly after the fifth de-\ncade due to arterial stiffening with age,\nwhich results in a progressive rise in SBP\nand fall in DBP as the elastic capacity of\nthe aorta diminishes.3-6 Arterial stiffness\nincreases afterload7,8 and myocardial oxy-\ngen demand,9 impairs ventricular relax-\nation,10 and causes subendocardial ische-\ncoronaryarterystenoses.Theseeffectsmay\nincrease the susceptibility of the aging\nheart to ischemia and ventricular dys-\nfunction.\nArterial stiffness has been shown to be\na risk factor for cardiovascular disease\n(CVD). In prospective cohorts, PP is as-\nsociated with risk of myocardial infarc-\nmotensive and hypertensive populations,\nas well as reinfarction and total mortality\nafter MI in patients with left ventricular\ndysfunction.18 Measures of arterial stiff-\nness are strongly correlated with left ven-\ntricular hypertrophy.19,20 However, none\nof these studies examined the possible re-\nlationship of arterial stiffness with CHF.\nWe addressed the hypothesis that in-\ncreased arterial stiffness may contribute\nto CHF in the elderly, by prospectively\nexamining whether PP is an indepen-\ndent predictor of CHF risk in a commu-\nnity-based elderly cohort.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThestudypopulationconsistedofpartici-\npants in the East Boston Senior Health\nProject,EastBoston,Mass,1ofthe4cen-\nters of the National Institute on Aging's\nEstablishedPopulationsforEpidemiologic\nStudiesoftheElderly.Acommunitycen-\ninbaselineinterviewsandin-homeevalu-\nations.Follow-upin-homeexaminations\nAuthorAffiliations: DivisionofPreventiveMedicine(Drs\nChae, Glynn, and Hennekens) and the Cardiovascular\nDivision (Drs Pfeffer and Mitchell), Department of Medi-\ncine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Cardiology\nDivision, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts Gen-\neral Hospital (Dr Chae); the Department of Ambula-\ntory Care and Prevention, Harvard Medical School (Dr\nHennekens), the Departments of Biostatistics (Dr Glynn)\nand Epidemiology (Dr Hennekens), Harvard School of\nPublic Health, Boston, Mass; and the East Boston Neigh-\nborhood Health Center, East Boston, Mass (Drs Taylor\nand Hennekens).\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: Claudia U.

Thus, pulse pressure, an index of ar-\nterial stiffening, may predict congestive heart failure (CHF) in the elderly.\nObjective To study prospectively the association between pulse pressure and risk\nof CHF.\nDesign Prospective cohort study.\nSetting The community-based East Boston Senior Health Project, East Boston, Mass.\nMain Outcome Measure Incidence of CHF as ascertained by hospital discharge\ndiagnosis (n = 208) and death certificates (n = 13).\nResults After controlling for age, sex, mean arterial pressure, history of coronary heart\ndisease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and antihyperten-\nsive medication use, pulse pressure was an independent predictor of CHF. For each\n10-mm Hg elevation in pulse pressure, there was a 14% increase in risk of CHF (95%\n(67 mm Hg) had a 55% increased risk of CHF (P = .02) compared with those in the\nlowest (54 mm Hg). Pulse pressure was more predictive than systolic blood pressure\nalone and was independent of diastolic blood pressure.\nConclusion Pulse pressure, an easily measurable correlate of pulsatile hemody-\nnamic load, is an independent predictor of risk of CHF in this elderly cohort.\nwere completed in the other years.

To define a cohort free of evi-\ndence of prior CHF, we excluded those\nwith a prior HCFA diagnosis of CHF\n(n=138)andthosewithoutapriorHCFA\ndiagnosis of CHF but who were taking\ncombinations of digoxin and loop diuret-\nics (n=25) or digoxin, loop diuretics, and\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-\ntors (n = 6). We also excluded 20 sub-\njects with missing medication data. This\nresultedinacohort of 1621 subjects with-\nout known CHF who had complete BP\nmeasurements and were followed up pro-\nspectively for 3.8 years (median).\nExposure Variables\nUsing a standard mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer, trained interviewers took 3 BP\nmeasurements at 30-second intervals af-\nter the participant had been seated for\nat least 5 minutes, using the protocol\nfrom the Hypertension Detection and\nFollow-up Program.21 Details of quality\ncontrol of BP measurements have been\npublished previously.22 The averages of\n3 SBP and DBP measurements were used.\nMean arterial pressure (MAP) was de-\nfined as {[SBP + (DBP  2)]/3}. Pulse\npressure was defined as SBP - DBP.\nWe assessed demographic character-\nistics, medical history, functional abili-\nties, and health habits.23 Interviewers in-\nspected all medication containers for\nprescription and nonprescription drugs\ntaken in the prior 2 weeks. Drugs were\ncoded using the Drug Product Informa-\ntion Coding System.\nHypertension was defined as any of the\nfollowing: self-report of high BP, previ-\nous HCFA diagnosis, use of antihyper-\ntensive medications, or an SBP greater\nthan 160 mm Hg or a DBP greater than\n90 mm Hg on examination. Diabetes\nmellitus (DM) was defined by self-\nreport, use of insulin or oral hypoglyce-\nmic agents, or previous HCFA diagno-\n414, prior percutaneous transluminal\ncoronary angioplasty or coronary artery\nbypass grafting), valvular heart disease,\nand atrial fibrillation (AF) were defined\nby HCFAdiagnoses.Smokingstatus(cur-\nrent, past, never) and alcohol use (none\nin past year, none in past month, 15\ng/d, 15 g/d) were categorized based on\nself-report.\nOutcome Measures\nsubjects reached the end point of first\nhospitalization with CHF, defined by\nhospitalization after the subject's 1988-\nCHF on the death certificate but no prior\nHCFA diagnosis of CHF (n = 13).\nStatistical Methods\nWe used analysis of variance for continu-\nous variables and tested for linear trends\nfor categorical variables to examine study\npopulationcharacteristicsstratifiedbyter-\ntiles of PP. Linear regression models were\nused to determine predictors of PP.\nParticipantscontributedfollow-uptime\nfrom the date of their baseline examina-\npitalization with CHF, death, or end of\nfollow-up, whichever came first. Hazard\nratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox\nproportionalhazardsmodels,controlling\nfor age, to evaluate the association of BP\nparameters with CHF risk.

If a significant linear re-\nlationshipwasfound,thevariablewasused\nas a continuous variable. Other clinical\npredictorsofCHFriskandpotentialcon-\nfounders were tested individually for as-\nsociationswithCHFriskinseparateCox\nmodels, after controlling for age. The re-\nlationships between BP parameters and\nrisk of CHF were examined in multivar-\niateCoxproportionalhazardsmodel,con-\ntrollingforage,sex,CHD,andsignificant\nunivariatepredictorsofCHFrisk.Foreach\nHR,2-sidedPvaluesand95%confidence\nintervals (CIs) were calculated.\nIn analyses assessing the relationship\nof PP with other CVD events and CHF,\nwe excluded participants with prior CHD\nat baseline (n = 167), leaving a total of\nCHF, 118 had nonfatal or fatal MIs (de-\nfined as the primary or underlying cause\nof death on the death certificate, with-\nout prior known CHD), and 68 died with\nCVD attributed as the immediate or un-\nderlying cause of death. In multivariate\nproportional hazards models, we exam-\nined the relationship of PP with MI and\ntotal CVD (259 first events of MI, CHF,\nor CVD death). To assess whether the as-\nsociation between PP and CHF risk is me-\ndiated through CHD, subjects with MI\noccurring before or after the incident\nCHF hospitalization were excluded, or\nMI was controlled for.\nEffect modification by sex, DM, and\nCHF risk factor status (defined as having\nany of the following: DM, CHD, AF, val-\nvular heart disease, or antihypertensive\nmedication use) was also examined.\nRESULTS\nClinical Characteristics\nand predominantly female (66.1%).\nPrevalent conditions at baseline in-\ncluded hypertension (54.6%), DM\nvalvular heart disease (1.8%). Nearly half\n(45.6%) were taking antihypertensive\nmedications,and12%werecurrentsmok-\ners. Mean (SD) BP parameters included\nAge, MAP, presence of DM, hyperten-\nsion, vascular heart disease, and use of\nantihypertensive medication signifi-\ncantly increased with tertiles of PP\n(TABLE 1). Sex, CHD, smoking status,\nand AF were not related to PP. In a mul-\ntivariate regression model, indepen-\ndent predictors of PP included age, MAP,\nand DM (all P.001), antihypertensive\nmedication use (P = .002), and valvular\nheart disease (P = .008). Using Spear-\nman rank order correlation coefficients\n(r), PP was correlated with MAP (r =0.41;\ncorrelation of PP with DBP was small al-\nthough statistically significant (r = -0.07;\nP = .004). Systolic blood pressure and\nDBP were also correlated (r = 0.44;\nBP and CHF Risk\nAge was a strong univariate predictor of\n(FIGURE), systolic blood pressure had a\ngraded relationship with increasing risk\nincrease in risk for every 10-mm Hg rise\nblood pressure, however, tended to have\na U-shaped relationship with CHF risk.\nCompared with subjects whose DBP\npressure had a significant linear relation-\nship with CHF risk (P for trend, .001),\nwith an age-adjusted 17% increase in risk\ntile of PP had a 75% increase in risk of\npared with those in the lowest. The re-\nlationship of PP to CHF risk was not ma-\nterially altered by the presence (to control\nfor the steady component of BP)4 or ab-\nsence of MAP in the model. MAP had no\nassociation with CHF in these data.\nAfter adjusting for age, use of antihy-\npertensive medications, DM, valvular\nheart disease, and AF were significant\npredictors of CHF (TABLE 2). Sex, smok-\ning, and alcohol use were not associ-\nated with CHF risk. Coronary heart dis-\nease was included as a covariate in the\nmultivariate models with the age-\nadjusted association of borderline\nsignificance (P = .07).\nIn a multivariate proportional haz-\nards model controlling for age, sex, MAP,\nCHD, and significant univariate predic-\ntors of CHF risk (DM, AF, valvular dis-\nease, antihypertensive medication use),\nPP was a significant independent pre-\ndictor of CHF (P for trend, .003) (Table\n2).

In these analyses, PP was\nindependent of SBP and DBP, was more\ninformative than SBP alone, and was ad-\nditive to DBP in predicting CHF risk.\nPP and CHD Events\nIn prior prospective studies in middle-\naged cohorts,14-18 PP was a predictor of\nMI and CVD death. In this elderly popu-\nlation, after excluding those with preva-\nlent CHD at baseline, PP was associated\nwith small numbers of incident MI, but\nthis was of borderline statistical signifi-\ncance after multivariate adjustment (HR\na combined end point of CHF, MI, or\ndeath due to CVD, PP was a significant\nindependent predictor of total CVD risk\ning subjects with MI occuring before or\nafter the incident CHF presentation, PP\nremained a significant predictor of CHF\njects were included and MI was con-\ntion of PP with CHF risk was indepen-\ndent of MI and was observed in those\nwithout evidence of CHD.\nEffect Modification\nThere were no significant interactions be-\ntween PP and DBP, sex, DM, antihyper-\ntensive medication use, or CHF risk fac-\ntor status. However, the association\nbetween PP and CHF risk was some-\nwhat stronger in men and those with-\nout CHF risk factors (TABLE 4). Diabe-\ntes mellitus did not appear to alter the\nassociation between PP and CHF risk.\nPulse pressure was not a significant pre-\ndictor of CHF risk in the subgroup of pa-\ntients taking antihypertensive medica-\ntions. This is most likely a chance finding\nin this subgroup, or possibly a reflec-\ntion of the effects of treatment, but we\ndo not have adequate power to address\nthis issue and had not specified this hy-\npothesis a priori.\nCOMMENT\nPulse pressure, an easily measurable cor-\nrelate of arterial stiffness and pulsatile he-\nmodynamic load,3-5 was an indepen-\ndent predictor of CHF risk in this\nprospective cohort. Pulse pressure was\nthe single most informative BP param-\neter, as it best captures the physiologi-\ncal sequelae of arterial stiffness as re-\nflected in disproportionately elevated\nSBP, decreased DBP, or both. These data\nsupport the hypothesis that the relative\nimportance of BP components in pre-\ndicting CVD risk varies with age, with\nPP emerging as a better marker for vas-\ncular overload in the elderly.3,24\nPrior studies of risk factors for CHF\nfocused on systolic or diastolic hyper-\ntension,2 and limited data exist regard-\ning the role of specific BP components.\nIn the Framingham Heart Study, PP was\na better predictor than SBP of CHF risk\nin men, especially after age 65 years, but\nnot in women.25 In elderly patients with\nisolated systolic hypertension, a signifi-\ncant subgroup of those with age-related\nvascular stiffening and increased PP3,4\ntreatment reduced the risk of fatal or\nTable 2.

HR indicates hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; and BP, blood pressure.\nControlled for mean arterial pressure and the above variables.\nModels using diastolic blood pressure included 70 to 79 mm Hg as reference category.\nPulse pressure reflects the complex in-\nteraction between intermittent cardiac\nejection and the dynamic properties of\nthe large arteries.3-5 The distensible, elas-\ntic aorta transiently stores part of the\nstroke volume during each systole and\ntransmits this volume forward in dias-\ntole as its walls recoil. This limits end-\nsystolic pressure and wall tension8 and\nmaintains diastolic perfusion pressure.\nThe progressive loss of aortic compli-\nance with age, due to elastin fragmenta-\ntion and increased collagen deposi-\ntion,27 results in elevation in PP, from the\nassociated rise in SBP and fall in DBP.\nSeveral plausible mechanisms may ex-\nplain an association between increased\nPP and CHF. Increased afterload7,8 and\npremature return of reflected waves in\nlate systole28 impose a greater load on the\nventricle, reducing ejection fraction8 and\nincreasing myocardial oxygen de-\nmand.9 Diastolic relaxation is also im-\npaired.10 Conduit vessel stiffness may in-\ncrease vulnerability to ischemia as well.\nThe increase in systolic load and myo-\ncardial work, coupled with the fall in di-\nastolic coronary perfusion pressure, re-\nsults in subendocardial ischemia with11,12\nand without coronary artery stenoses.13\nArterial stiffness is strongly correlated\nwith left ventricular hypertrophy in nor-\njects and with left ventricular mass in\nsible consequence of its excess hemody-\nnamic load and a known risk factor for\nCHF and CVD events.30\nIn addition to hemodynamic conse-\nquences, the association between el-\nevated PP and CHF risk may in part be\nmediated by CHD. Arterial stiffness is\ncorrelated with atherosclerosis31,32 and\nmay promote primary atheroma devel-\nopment, possibly mediated by greater cy-\nclic wall stress.33,34 Several prospective\nsupport the hypothesis that higher PP is\nassociated with increased CHD, but none\naddressed its relationship with CHF. In\nour data of the elderly, the association\nbetween PP and CHF was independent\nof CHD, suggesting that it may be me-\ndiated by other adverse effects of arte-\nrial stiffness on hemodynamics, systolic\nand diastolic function, and myocardial\nperfusion.\nThese findings have potential preven-\ntive and therapeutic implications regard-\ning modifiability of arterial stiffness and\nperhaps risk of CHF. For example, an-\ngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\ncause greater regression of left ventricu-\nlar hypertrophy than other vasodilators\ndespite lowering MAP to the same de-\ngree.35 This may be due to reduction in\npulsatile load and premature wave re-\nflection35 or modulation of renin-\nangiotensin system effects on arterial\ncompliance.36 Nitrates37 and low-salt di-\nets38 improve arterial distensibility. Ad-\nverse effects on coronary blood supply,\nincluding decreased diastolic perfusion\npressure11,13 and a greater proportion of\nmyocardial perfusion occurring in sys-\ntole,12,39 may have implications for treat-\nment of elderly patients with CHD, in\nwhom hearts perfused by wide PPs may\nbe more sensitive to reductions in SBP\ncreased pulsatile load during acute coro-\nnary occlusion resulted in a 3-fold de-\ncline in ejection fraction, marked fall in\nSBP, and doubling of ischemic mass. This\nmay contribute to the greater severity of\nCHF and left ventricular dysfunction seen\nin the elderly after MI, independent of\nthe severity of coronary stenosis.12\nSeveral issues regarding our study\nmethods should be addressed. Brachial\nartery BPs by sphygmomanometry are\nless accurate in measuring central pres-\nsure than more invasive or technologi-\ncally advanced methods. However, this\ntype of BP measurement is easily ob-\ntained in a clinical setting, and in an el-\nderly population, such as ours, periph-\neral and central PP are better correlated\nthan in younger subjects.3,4 We also used\nthe average of 3 BPs taken by Hyperten-\nsion Detection and Follow-up Pro-\ngram21 protocol to increase the accu-\nracy of our measurements. In other\nprospective studies,14,18 even a single, ca-\nsual BP measurement yielded signifi-\ncant positive associations between PP and\nCVD events.\nWhile we used HCFA diagnoses to\nidentify end points, a validation study\n402) had sensitivities and positive pre-\ndictive values, respectively, of 0.89 and\nin the principal position.40 In a study of\nin 4 states, the principal diagnosis of CHF\n(ICD-9 code 428) was confirmed by clini-\nrestricted our analysis to CHF as the prin-\ncipal diagnosis, the magnitude of asso-\nciation was not materially altered, al-\nthough the CI widened due to the smaller\nnumber of end points. Hospitalization is\na reasonable but imperfect indicator of\nincident CHF. While most patients re-\nquire hospitalization at some point in\ntheir disease course, this method is bi-\nased toward selection of sicker patients\nand will not identify nonhospitalized\ncases of CHF. A potential limitation is that\nsome subjects may have had CHF at base-\nline. Given the natural history of CHF,\nwith its poor prognosis and high rate of\nTable 4.

The pathophysiology of arterial\nstiffness suggests that the association be-\ntween PP and CHF risk may apply pre-\ndominantly to the elderly. We do not\nhave data about left ventricular func-\ntion in these subjects but speculate that\na link may exist between progressive ar-\nterial stiffness, with its adverse effects on\nventricular relaxation, loading condi-\ntions, and myocardial perfusion, and the\nincrease in diastolic heart failure ob-\nserved in the elderly.\nIn summary, in this prospective study\nof a community-based elderly cohort, PP\nwas independently and linearly associ-\nated with risk of CHF. Pulse pressure may\nbe a clinically useful tool to identify el-\nderly subjects at risk for CHF, who may\nbenefit from treatment to improve arte-\nrial compliance. More research is needed\nto further examine the relationship of\narterial compliance with its cardiovas-\ncular sequelae, as well as the possible\nbenefits of therapies specifically de-\nsigned to prevent or treat the vascular pa-\nthology associated with elevated pulse\npressure.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported in part\ntute on Aging, Bethesda, Md.
