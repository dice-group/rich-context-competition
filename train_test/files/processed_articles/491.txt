Popkin\n Key words: metabolic equivalents, U.S. adolescents, tele-\nvision, ethnicity\nIntroduction\nRecent surveys show an alarming trend of increased\noverweight prevalence in U.S. adolescents (1). Childhood\nand adolescent overweight are major health problems for\nAmerican youth because of their associated morbidities\n(2,3) and tendency to persist into adulthood (4,5).\nPhysical activity and inactivity have been shown to be\nrelated to obesity, but exert influence through different\nbehavioral pathways (6). Evidence suggests that physical\nactivity is inversely associated with overweight (7\u00ad9), al-\nthough results are inconsistent (10,11). Researchers have\nfound that inactivity, specifically television viewing, is an\nimportant risk factor for obesity development (6,12\u00ad14),\nalthough these results are inconsistent as well (7,15,16).\nPhysical activity and inactivity track into adulthood, al-\nthough inactivity shows better tracking (17). A substantial\nshown that reducing physical inactivity of children can\nincrease physical activity and reduce obesity.\nCumulative research has shown a positive relationship\nbetween TV viewing and obesity among children and ado-\nwork has explored the relationship among physical activity,\ninactivity, and overweight in large samples, which include\nsubstantial ethnic subpopulations, specifically Asian and\nHispanic Americans. Moreover, analyses of physical activ-\nCarolina Population Center, University of North Carolina and the Department of Nutrition,\nSchool of Public Health University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nAddress correspondence to Dr. Penny Gordon-Larsen, University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill, Carolina Population Center, University Square, 123 West Franklin Street,\nE-mail: gordon_larsen@unc.edu\nity have not included adequate measures of both low- and\nmoderate/vigorous-intensity physical activity. Furthermore,\nthere is little in the literature on the role of changes in\nphysical activity and inactivity and their association with\noverweight among any national sample of U.S. adolescents.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the association\namong physical activity, inactivity, and overweight to in-\nform interventions to reduce overweight. This study aimed\nto document the prevalence of overweight and assess the\nassociation of initial status of (and 1-year change) TV and\nvideo viewing, computer/video game use, moderate to vig-\norous physical activity, and low-intensity physical activity\nwith overweight among U.S. adolescents. This study makes\nthree important and unique contributions to the activity\nliterature: use of baseline and dynamic measures of physical\nactivity and inactivity, use of broad physical activity mea-\nsures, including moderate to vigorous and low-intensity\nphysical activity data, and the opportunity to investigate the\nassociation of physical activity and inactivity with over-\nweight in a large nationally representative sample of ado-\nlescents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSurvey Design\nThe study population includes more than 20,000 adoles-\ncents enrolled in The National Longitudinal Study of Ado-\nlescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal, nationally rep-\nresentative, school-based study of adolescents in grades 7 to\nincluded a core sample plus subsamples of selected minority\nand other groupings collected under protocols approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board of the University of North\neligible adolescents measured April to December, 1995)\nbe still enrolled in high school during 1996, including\ndropouts, measured April to August, 1996). Exclusions in-\ncluded the following: adolescents who used a walking aid (e.g.,\ncane, crutches, or wheelchair); Native Americans (N  178),\ndue to small sample size; adolescents without complete phys-\nical activity, height, and weight data; and adolescents older\n(sample sizes are shown in Table 1), for prevalence estimates\nand logistic regression analysis. The survey design and\nsampling frame have been described elsewhere (25,26).\nIn-home surveys of adolescents provided the physical activ-\nity and inactivity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking data.\nIn-home surveys of parents and adolescents provided income\nand educational data. Race and ethnicity were determined\nusing self-reported data from a combination of all the surveys.\nBody Mass\nHeight and weight were measured in wave 2. For multi-\nvariate analysis, overweight is defined as a BMI  95th\npercentile of age- and sex-specific cut-points from the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for\nPhysical Activity and Inactivity\nAdd Health questionnaires included a standard physical\nactivity behavior recall that is similar, although not identi-\ncal, to other self-report questionnaires that have been used\nand validated in other large-scale epidemiological studies\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity (5 to 8 metabolic\nequivalents [METs], skating and cycling, exercise and ac-\ntive sports) and low-intensity activity (2 to 3 METs; house\ncleaning, hobbies, and hanging out with friends) in units of\ntimes per week. There were no 4 MET level activities\nreported. One MET represents the resting metabolic rate or\n/kg body per minute. TV viewing, video viewing,\nand computer/video game use were recorded as hours per\nweek over the past week. These methods have been de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere (26). Quantifying inactivity has\nreceived far less attention than physical activity (34) and\nlittle, if anything, is published in the literature regarding the\nreliability and validity of inactivity data.\nStudy Variables\nWe examined initial status of physical activity and inac-\ntivity measured in wave 1 of the study and the change\nbetween waves 1 and 2. We categorized initial status of TV\nand video viewing as low (7 h/wk, reference); medium (8\nto 35 h/wk), and high (36 h/wk); and computer/video\ngame use as 4 or 4 h/wk. We used these categories to\ncorrect for non-normal distributions and for comparative\npurposes, based on the recommendation of the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education (35)\nto watch no more than 1 to 2 hours of TV per day.\nWe used categories of change in inactivity for the mul-\ntivariate analyses: TV and video viewing (increase of 7\nh/wk) and computer/video games (increase of 1 h/wk).\nCategories of inactivity (TV, video viewing, and computer/\nvideo game use) were initially analyzed separately; how-\never, final models combined TV- and video-viewing hours\nbecause of absence of a separate video effect on overweight\nand similarity in MET values for watching TV and videos.\nThis strategy ignores the separate effect of TV advertising.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using STATA, Ver-\nsion 6.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) (36). Descriptive\nanalysis used post-stratification sample weights to allow\nresults to be representative of adolescents attending U.S.\nEthnic Differences in Activity and Overweight, Gordon-Larsen, Adair, and Popkin\nTable 1.

All analyses used multiple stages\nof cluster sampling to allow for survey design effects. We\nused logistic regression models of overweight (BMI  95th\npercentile; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/\nNational Center for Health Statistics) to investigate the\neffects of initial (and 1-year change) activity and inactivity\nstatus, and the interaction between initial status and 1-year\nchange in activity and inactivity. Conceptually, use of\nchange in activity/inactivity adds knowledge and increases\nconfidence that the associations between activity/inactivity\nand overweight represent causal relationships. The interac-\ntion between initial status and change variables was not\nsignificant and, therefore, was excluded from final models.\nSociodemographic correlates of activity and inactivity\nwere used as control variables. These correlates included\nage, total household income, parental education, urban res-\nidence (urban, rural, and suburban), cigarette smoking, pres-\nence of mother in household, and presence of father in\nhousehold. Models were stratified by sex and ethnicity.\nResults\nOverweight Status\nOverweight prevalence (Figure 1) was highest among\nnon-Hispanic black girls, non-Hispanic white boys, and\nHispanic boys and girls.

By ethnicity, non-Hispanic blacks had the highest\nlevels (Table 1). Overall, boys, particularly non-Hispanic\nblack and Asian boys, spent considerably more time playing\ncomputer/video games.\nIn the total sample, boys had more bouts per week of\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity than girls (Table 1).\nModerate to vigorous activity was highest for Asian and\nnon-Hispanic white boys and lowest for non-Hispanic black\nand Hispanic girls. Boys and girls engaged in identical total\nmean low-intensity physical activity per week.\nOne-Year Changes in Inactivity and Activity\nThe total sample had a 1-year decrease in the hours per\nsex and ethnic variation shown in Table 1. Overall, adoles-\ncents decreased the number of hours per week of video/\n1-year period. Boys had significantly higher increases in\nTV/video viewing and games than girls.\nOn average, adolescents decreased weekly moderate to\nvigorous physical activity, with a sample mean of 0.19\n(SE  0.03) bouts per week. There were greater decrements\namong boys, and specifically Asian and non-Hispanic white\nboys. On average, adolescents increased their low-intensity\nphysical activity over the 1-year period (mean  0.13; SE \n0.03) bouts per week. It is likely that adolescents are re-\nplacing TV/video viewing with low-intensity physical ac-\ntivity, such as talking on the telephone, hanging out with\nfriends, and driving or riding in cars.\nAssociation of Physical Activity and Inactivity with\nOverweight\nInitial status and change in physical activity and inactiv-\nity were modeled in sex- and ethnicity-stratified models\ncontrolling for age, maternal education, family income,\npresence of mother in the household, urban residence, cig-\narette smoking, region, and cluster sampling (Table 2).\nFor the total sample of U.S. boys (fifth column of Table\n2), odds of overweight were nearly 50% higher with high\nTV viewing and 14% lower with high moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity. A 1-year decrease in moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity was associated with a 10% decrease in\nodds of overweight. For the total sample of U.S. girls (fifth\ncolumn of Table 2), odds of overweight were 43% higher\nwith high TV/video viewing and 10% lower with high\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity. In addition, girls had\n8% higher odds of overweight with 1-year change in low-\nintensity physical activity.\nThe pattern of results by sex and ethnic groups (the first\nfour columns of Table 2) showed substantial variation in the\nassociation between levels of inactivity and activity by sex\nand ethnicity. For example, greater TV/video viewing was\nsignificantly associated with increased risk of overweight\nonly among white adolescents.

Moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity was significantly associated with decreased risk of\noverweight except among non-Hispanic white girls and\nAsians, with levels ranging from 19% lower among non-\nHispanic whites to 9% lower among Hispanic girls.\nModels were run with and without change variables to\ndetermine the effect of using the more dynamic models.\nModels of overweight using baseline measures without the\nchange variables showed similar patterns as those with\nchange variables, although significance level of baseline\nmeasures was moderately higher for the models including\nchange measures.\nPredicted Probability of Overweight by Level of TV\nViewing and Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity\nAn alternative strategy for interpreting the relative im-\nportance of activity and inactivity involves predicting the\nprevalence of overweight at different, researcher-specified\nlevels of activity and inactivity. To accomplish this, we used\ncoefficients derived from the fully adjusted logistic regres-\nsion models described above to calculate predicted proba-\nbility of overweight for low vs. high levels of TV/video\nviewing (7 vs. 35 h/wk), moderate to vigorous activ-\nity (1 vs. 7 bouts/wk) and combinations of high inactivity\nwith low moderate to vigorous activity vs. low inactivity\nwith high moderate to vigorous activity. Results are\npresented in Table 3.\nPredicted probability of overweight was higher (5.3 per-\ncentage points, boys and 3.6 percentage points, girls) with\n35 h/wk of TV/video viewing vs. 7 h/wk. For moderate\nto vigorous activity, the predicted probability of overweight\nwas 9.3 percentage points (boys) and 4.8 percentage points\n(girls) higher among those who engaged in one bout of\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity per week, compared\nwith those who engaged in seven bouts per week. The\ncombined effects of high inactivity and low moderate to\nvigorous physical activity is particularly evident in boys: the\npredicted probability of overweight was nearly 15 percent-\nage points higher for those with high TV/video time and low\nmoderate to vigorous activity. For girls, the comparable\ndifference was 7.9 percentage points.\nThe greatest impact of additional hours of TV/video viewing\non overweight was for non-Hispanic white girls (10 percentage\npoints higher) and Hispanic boys (9.2 percentage points high-\ner), whereas negative effects were seen for non-Hispanic black\nboys (1.1 percentage points lower) and girls (3.7 percentage\npoints lower). Higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity had comparatively stronger effects on non-Hispanic\nwhite boys (12.5 percentage points higher) and non-Hispanic\nblack boys (10.4 percentage points higher).\nDiscussion\nThese results are consistent with previous research show-\ning an association of overweight prevalence with TV view-\nTable 3.

Researchers found a larger\n1-year increase in BMI among youths who reported more\ntime viewing TV, videos, and games (39). However, other\nresearchers found no association between TV viewing and\nobesity (15,40,41). In fact, the point has been made that the\npositive findings cited above represent weak associations\n(15,42).

Simi-\nlarly, other researchers found increased odds of overweight\nResults from the predicted probabilities for the total study\nsample suggest that reducing TV-viewing time will likely\nresult in a dramatic reduction in overweight prevalence.\nRelated to this result, Epstein et al. (19\u00ad21) have shown\nthat reducing TV viewing was successful in decreasing\nobesity among children. In addition, intervention research\nhas shown TV-viewing reductions decreased BMI among\ngirls (16,44). Furthermore, research has shown a greater\nassociation between overweight and TV viewing than phys-\nical activity (24). Our findings indicate that reducing\ninactivity might be less successful among selected eth-\nnic groups (e.g., non-Hispanic black adolescents, Asians\nand Hispanic girls) and this is disconcerting given high-\ninactivity/low-physical activity patterns among minority\nAt the other end of the activity spectrum, we found a\nnegative association between greater moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity and overweight among non-Hispanic white\nboys, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics of both sexes.\nResults suggest that increasing moderate to vigorous phys-\nical activity will likely result in dramatic reductions in\noverweight for all groups, except Asians, with greatest\npotential among non-Hispanic white and black boys. Evi-\ndence from other studies also suggests that physical activity\nis inversely associated with overweight (7\u00ad9). Despite the\nfact that a cross-sectional analysis of a national sample\nfound no relationship between overweight and moderate\nto vigorous physical activity, researchers did find a neg-\native relationship between overweight and participation\nin sport teams and exercise programs in boys and 14- to\nOur findings demonstrate a significant association be-\ntween moderate to vigorous physical activity and over-\nweight. Few studies have examined this association and\neven fewer have found that moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity influences overweight status [e.g., two national\nstudies found no relationship between physical activity and\nbody composition (12,13)]. Moreover, the work of Epstein\net al. (19\u00ad21) has highlighted the importance of reduc-\ntions in inactivity for obesity intervention efforts. Lack of\na positive effect on weight (despite positive changes in\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity) (45) in the Child\nAdolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health study also\nemphasized a greater focus on inactivity (46). Impor-\ntantly, we have shown that moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity is far more amenable to environmental interven-\ntions than inactivity (47).\nIn terms of methodology, we separately tested low-inten-\nsity physical activity, a dimension of physical activity here-\ntofore ignored. We found a modest effect of change in\nlow-intensity physical activity on overweight status for\ngirls, in general, and specifically in Asian girls. In addition,\nwe found that using both baseline and 1-year dynamic\nchange in activity and inactivity were important. On av-\nerage, using the dynamic measures does not dramatically\nchange the association of overweight with our baseline\nvalues, perhaps due to the limited 12-month length of the\nmeasurement period. Future research should use longitu-\ndinal analyses over longer periods to fully understand\nthese longitudinal relationships.\nThe ethnic differences found in this study likely resulted\nfrom a complex interaction between socioeconomic, envi-\nronmental, and cultural factors. For example, previous re-\nsults from the Add Health study suggest that environmental\ninfluences exert an important positive influence on physical\nactivity levels, whereas socioeconomic factors exert an in-\nfluence on inactivity (47). It may also be possible that the\nethnic differentials observed in this study could be the result\nof differential reporting of physical activity and inactivity,\nperhaps due to cultural influences and expectations that may\ndifferentially lead to over- or underreporting of activity and\ninactivity. Future work will help to elucidate the complex\ninteractions between these factors and how they relate to\noverweight among U.S. adolescents.\nIn summary, these findings suggest that overweight prev-\nalence is high and adolescents are engaging in high levels of\ninactivity and low levels of moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity. We find that reductions in television and video\nviewing are likely to reduce overweight of U.S. adolescents.\nIn addition, we find that an increase in moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity represents another potentially successful\nstrategy for reducing overweight among U.S. adolescents.\nBoth approaches, and particularly an approach that com-\nbines reductions in inactivity and promotion of physical\nactivity, are likely to result in marked reductions in over-\nweight prevalence among our nation's youth. However, we\nmust begin to consider the differences in behavior in dif-\nferent ethnic subpopulations, as well as differences in un-\nderlying factors that influence behavior differentials, as we\ndevise intervention strategies.\nEthnic Differences in Activity and Overweight, Gordon-Larsen, Adair, and Popkin\n"
