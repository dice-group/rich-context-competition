Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences,\n\u00a9 The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \nTHERE is growing recognition of the importance of\nwithin-family variability in understanding intergenera-\ntional relationships (Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2005; Suitor,\nSechrist, & Pillemer, 2007). The majority of adults were not\nraised as the only child in their family (Eggebeen, 1992),\nand an extensive literature documents that siblings may ex-\nperience different relationships with parents throughout\nchildhood (McHale, Updegraff, Jackson-Newsom, Tucker,\nBelsky, 1992), and these differences and their effects may\npersist into adulthood (Davey, Eggebeen, & Savla, 2007;\nShaw, Krause, Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004).\nIn the present study, we examine within-family variability in\nadult siblings' recalled experiences with their parents and\nassociation with positive and negative affect across midlife.\nAcross the lifespan siblings experience what has been\nreferred to as a \"shared environment\" in which they all are\nexposed to the same environmental factors, such as parents'\naverage level of affection and discipline, economic status,\nand other characteristics of their environment that work to\ncreate similarities between siblings (Daniels & Plomin,\n1985). In addition to genetic differences (Pike, Manke,\nReiss, & Plomin, 2000), siblings also have nonshared expe-\nriences characterized by those environmental factors that\nwork to make siblings from the same family different from\nNonshared experiences include siblings' relative treatment\nby their parents (i.e., favored vs. unfavored) and changes\nthat occur in the home environment at different ages for\neach sibling (e.g., parental health may decline after older\nsiblings are grown, and younger siblings may experience a\nsickly parent in adolescence; Dunn, 1993). A goal of this\nstudy is to consider how two aspects of nonshared environ-\nment (NSE), adult siblings' recollections of parental treat-\nment and characteristics of their home environment, are\nconnected to current positive and negative affect.\nResearch on differential treatment in childhood high-\nlights its importance for individual well-being (McHale\net al., 2000), but the extent to which perceived differences\npersist into adulthood (Boll, Ferring, & Filipp, 2005; Cicire-\nlli, 1995) and whether these disparities are associated with\ncurrent well-being are unclear. On the one hand, perceived\ndifferences may diminish over time. Parents clearly differ-\nentiate between younger and older siblings in early child-\nhood, but as siblings enter adulthood, parents may treat\nthem more comparably (Dunn & Plomin, 1990) or children\nmay come to accept perceived disparities in treatment as a\nstable family dynamic or eventually reappraise these rela-\ntionships in adulthood (Levine & Bluck, 1997; Piazza,\nCharles, & Almeida, 2007). On the other hand, theorists ar-\ngue that once families establish patterns of differential treat-\nment when offspring are young, it is difficult to break these\npatterns in adulthood (Fingerman & Bermann, 2000; Troll,\n1996). Indeed, studies find that adults retain distinct ideas\nabout who was the favorite sibling in the family (Bedford,\nWithin-Family Variability in Representations of Past\nRelationships With Parents\nAdam Davey,1 Corinna Jenkins Tucker,2 Karen Fingerman,3 and Jyoti Savla4\n1College of Health Professions, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n2Department of Family Studies, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire.\n3Department of Child Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lateyette, Indiana.\n4Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg.\nBackground. We examined within-family variation in siblings' memories of experiences with parents and their as-\nsociations with current positive and negative affect.\nStudy of Midlife in the United States (Mage = 47 years, 59% women, 94% White).\nResults. There was considerable variability in recalled maternal and paternal treatment across the dimensions of affection\nand 0.26). In turn, recalled parental treatment, particularly affection, made unique contributions to current positive (ICC 0.12)\nand negative affect (ICC 0.08) over and above individual and familial level characteristics such as offspring demographic char-\nacteristics, extraversion and neuroticism, family structure, recalled early family environment, and parents' current status.\nConclusions. Results link adults' memories of experiences with their parents in childhood to their current well-being\nand highlight the importance of considering within-family models for family theory.\nKey Words: MIDUS--Negative affect--Positive affect--Recalled parental treatment--Siblings--Within-family.\n& Pillemer, 2006). In childhood, less favored siblings may\nsuffer emotionally, experience decreased self-esteem, and\nexhibit behavioral problems (Brody, Stoneman, & Burke,\nDubas, Gerris, & van Aken, 2004). Other studies find that\nadult children who feel even slightly favored report better\nwell-being. We expect that offspring with memories of\nbeing treated more poorly than their siblings in childhood\nwould fare worse on indicators of positive and negative af-\nfect in midlife, over and above average recalled levels of\ntreatment by parents within the family.\nPrevious studies suggest that parental differential treat-\nment may vary by domain (Hamilton-Giachritsis & Browne,\nnot only favor one sibling with greater affection but also dis-\ncipline that sibling more often. Differential treatment may\nexist with regard to affection, but not with regard to disci-\npline. Moreover, studies suggest the domain in which differ-\nential treatment occurs has implications for adjustment in\nchildhood (Tucker et al). Most studies of adults' past relation-\nships with parents have been confined to memories of affection\net al., 2004) without considering other kinds of experiences,\nbut studies considering adults' memories of problems with par-\nents have found that adults readily recall negative aspects of\nWhitbeck, Simons, & Conger, 1991). Given the multifaceted\nqualities of parent-offspring relationships, this study focused\non siblings' memories of parental affection, discipline, and\nconflict. Of course, these memories are reconstructed in the\npresent and may reflect present situations as well as past ones\nYet, regardless of their accuracy, recollections of prior experi-\nence may be important for understanding positive and negative\naffect for individuals as well as the nature of their relationships\nwith others in adulthood (Amato, 1991; Brewin, Andrews,\nWe compare differences in memories of offsprings' relation-\nships with parents \"within the same family\" to compare sib-\nlings'memoriesofparentaltreatmentaboveandbeyondfamily\ncharacteristics. Thus, we considered (a) characteristics which\nmay vary across siblings within the same family and (b) char-\nacteristics which vary across siblings between families.\nCharacteristics that vary within families: Individual\ncharacteristics of each sibling we could examine were (a)\nchild demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, marital\nstatus, educational attainment, and employment or parental\nstatus) and (b) child personal characteristics (e.g., personal-\nity and health). We also considered birth order, which has\nbeen linked with parental differential treatment in child-\nhood (Kowal, Krull, & Kramer, 2004; McHale, Crouter,\nAge was included because younger siblings tend to be\nfavored in early childhood, but it is not clear whether these\neffects continue throughout adolescence and into adulthood.\nGender was included because mothers tend to favor daugh-\nters over sons, and fathers tend to favor sons (Harris &\nTucker et al., 2003). Finally, adult siblings vary in their cur-\nrent characteristics (e.g., education, employment, marital\nstatus, and parental status), and variability in these charac-\nteristics may be associated with differences in ties to par-\nents as well as predict their current well-being (Belsky,\nSiblings also bring different features to their relationships\nwith their parents that may carry over into differential treat-\nment. Evidence suggests that parents favor easygoing chil-\ndren with more love and nurturance beginning at an early\n1992b) and are less responsive to difficult or anxious babies\n(Rutter et al., 1997). Continuity of individual differences in\ntemperament or personality is beyond the scope of this\nstudy (Angleitner & Ostendorf, 1994; Mroczek, Spiro, &\nGriffin, 2006), but we consider whether adult personality\ncharacteristics are associated with memories of prior expe-\nriences with parents. Finally, prospective as well as cross-\nsectional studies have shown that individuals' assessment\nof their general health and comparative self-rated health are\nimportant predictors of their later social and psychological\nwell-being (Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal,\n2000) and even subsequent mortality (Mossey & Shapiro,\n1982). We therefore include these two variables as a mea-\nsure of the personal characteristic of each sibling in the\nfamily.\nCharacteristics that vary between families: Previous re-\nsearch has shown that parents with more education are less\nlikely to treat siblings differently based on gender (Harris &\nMorgan, 1991), so we expect siblings' memories of ties to be\nassociated with parents' education. We also include parents'\nhealth and work involvement when children were young to\nprovide information about the earlier family environment.\nWe added parents' current health status to our model because\nthis might be associated with the recollection of memories of\nparental treatment and relationships (Davey et al., 2005). Fi-\nnally, we consider family-level characteristics such as sibship\nsize and gender composition. Previous work has shown that\nsmaller sibships are characterized by greater parental differ-\nentiation than larger ones (Freese, Powell, & Steelman, 1999;\nHarris & Morgan, 1991) and that the balance of sons and\ndaughters shapes parent\u00adoffspring ties in adulthood (Connidis,\nIn summary, we used within- and between-family com-\nparisons to address the following research questions: (a)\nWhat proportion of the variability in recalled parental treat-\nment and positive and negative affect is explained by family\nmembership? (b) What within-family and between-family\nfactors predict variability in adults' recollections of mater-\nnal and paternal affection, discipline, and conflict? and (c)\nTo what extent are recollections of parental treatment\nassociated with current positive and negative affect,\ncontrolling for both within-family and between-family\ncharacteristics?\nMethods\nData are drawn from a study of siblings conducted as part\nof the National Survey of Midlife Development in the\nUnited States (MIDUS) sponsored by the MacArthur Foun-\ndation Research Network on Successful Midlife Develop-\nment. The initial phase of the study included a random\nprobability sample of 3,485 English-speaking, noninstitu-\ntionalized adults ages 25\u00ad74 years, oversampling men and\nolder respondents. A study of siblings was derived from this\ninitial sample.\nBy design, the MIDUS sibling sample was confined to\nfamilies where siblings shared the same biological mother\nand father. As a result, it provides a more conservative test\nof parental differential treatment than might be the case if\nstep or half siblings were included. Five hundred and twen-\nty-nine of the MIDUS participants who reported that they\nhad one or more living biological siblings were randomly\nselected for this study. Siblings were recruited by asking\nthese MIDUS participants to provide contact information\nand to personally communicate with their siblings about\nparticipation before a recruiter called. Nine hundred and\nfifty-one of these siblings ages 25\u00ad74 years agreed to par-\nticipate, for a total of 1,480 individuals. Based on partici-\npants' reports of the number of siblings they actually had\nwhile growing up, this sample represents over 88% of the\nsiblings available in these 529 families (MIDUS did not so-\nlicit information regarding sibling mortality). As a result of\nthis inclusion criterion, participants in the sibling data set\nwere more likely to have grown up with both parents (83%)\nthan nonsibling MIDUS participants (75%).\nTo ensure that the overall sample was representative of\neach family size, we used fertility patterns for the mother's\nbirth cohort to adjust the MIDUS sampling weights to ac-\ncurately reflect the number of only-child families (Taeuber,\nresented by 98 siblings) and only children (N = 234) were\nexcluded from analysis. Our results were essentially identi-\ncal when only children were included in the sample. An ad-\nditional 13 cases were excluded because of inconsistencies\nregarding sibship characteristics which we were unable to\nresolve. Our final sample thus consisted of data from 498\nfamilies, for an overall sample size of 1,369.\nAs with almost any large, nationally representative sur-\nvey, the MIDUS data set contains partially missing observa-\ntions. While no single variable in our study was missing for\na large proportion of our sample, use of listwise deletion\nwith a large number of variables is not recommended (e.g.,\nresulted in the loss of a relatively large number of observa-\ntions. As a result, we constructed five imputed data sets\n(Schafer, 1997). Analyses were then run separately for each\nimputed data set and results combined using multiple impu-\ntation inference. This approach allows for valid parameter\nestimates to be obtained while retaining an appropriate\namount of uncertainty in standard errors due to missing\nobservations.\nProcedure\nParticipants completed three research protocols: one 30-\nminute telephone interview and two self-administered ques-\ntionnaires sent by mail. Questions used in this study were\ndistributed throughout the research battery. The original\nMIDUS participants completed this battery first, and their\nsiblings completed the same battery approximately 10\u00ad15\nmonths later.\nMeasures\nBecause the preceding literature review points to a wide\nvariety of sources of both differential recalled parental treat-\nment and positive and negative affect, we included measures\nof each source in our statistical models, as they were avail-\nable in the MIDUS data set.\nPredictor Variables\n\"Child demographic characteristics\" included age in\nyears, whether the child was a daughter (0 = no, 1 = yes),\nwhether the child was currently married (0 = no, 1 = yes), the\nhighest grade of school or year of college completed (1 =\nsome grade school to some high school, 2 = GED or gradu-\nated high school, 3 = some college, 4 = graduated college to\nother professional degree or doctorate), whether the child\nwas currently employed (0 = no, 1 = yes), the number of\nmarriages, and whether the child was a parent (0 = no,\n\"Child personal characteristics\" included measures of\nneuroticism, extraversion, perceived self-rated health (coded\nas 1 = poor to, 5 = excellent), and perceived health relative\nto age\u00adpeers (1 = much better to 5 = much worse). The Neu-\nroticism scale (a = .74) consists of items measuring re-\nsponses to the question: \"Please indicate how well each of\nthe following describes you: Moody, Worrying, Nervous,\nand Calm [reverse-scored].\" Extraversion (a = .78) was\nmeasured using the same item stem question and the adjec-\ntives outgoing, friendly, lively, active, and talkative (Lach-\nTo assess \"family structure,\" we initially considered a\nrange of variables based on theory and previous research.\nFor example, we were able to consider family size, coded as\nthe number of siblings. Birth order was not significant in\nany model, so it was not retained. Gender composition of\nthe sibship was initially considered in a variety of ways,\nbased on Steelman, Powell, Werum, and Carter (2002). We\nconsidered whether there were any daughters, the proportion\nof male siblings, and the proportion of opposite-sex sib-\nlings. In the end, only the last variable was retained. We also\nconsidered spacing of children within the sibship, coded as\ntotal span between oldest and youngest sibling, average age\ngap between siblings, and age gap with closest sibling.\nNone of these was a significant predictor in our models.\nThus, the final family structure variables retained in our\nmodel were family size and proportion of opposite-sex\nsiblings.\nSeveral indicators of \"recalled family environment\" were\navailable in the MIDUS data set. Specifically, we had indi-\ncators of maternal and paternal health status when the child\nwas 16 (\"Looking back to when you were 16, how would\nyou rate your biological [mother's/father's] health at that\ntime?\" 0 = deceased, 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very\ngood, 5 = excellent), maternal and paternal educational at-\ntainment (coded as 1 = no school/some grade school to 12 =\nPhD or other professional degree), and maternal and pater-\nnal work involvement during childhood (\"How much of\nyour childhood did [your mother/father] either work for pay\nor in a family business?\" 1 = not at all to 5 = all). The only\ntwo indicators regarding \"parents' current status\" that could\nbe coded for all individuals was whether the mother and\nfather were currently still living (0 = no, 1 = yes).\nOutcome Variables\nRecalled parental treatment.--Our first set of models pre-\ndicted \"quality of maternal and paternal relationships\"\nacross three dimensions. Siblings rated the \"degree of affec-\ntion\" received in childhood from each parent. This index\nwas developed for the MIDUS study and included five items\npertaining to parental affection (Rossi, 2001). For example,\nparticipants provided a global rating of the quality of the\nrelationship with each parent in response to the question:\n`How would you rate your relationship with your mother\nduring the years when you were growing up using a scale of\n1 to 5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)?' Other items assessed ability\nto confide in parent, parental expression of love and affec-\ntion, empathy concerning problems, and time and attention\nprovided (a for mothers and fathers = .90 and .92, respec-\ntively). Participants also completed a 5-item index of \"disci-\npline\" received from each parent (Rossi, 2001). These items\nwere rated on a 4-point scale (1 = a lot, 2 = some, 3 = a little,\n4 = not at all) and included harshness of discipline, consis-\ntency of discipline, being allowed to engage in activities that\nother children the same age were allowed to play, and so\nforth (a = .73 and .79 for mothers and fathers, respectively).\nA final index of \"conflict\" with the parent was derived from\na 3-item version of Straus's (1979) Conflict Tactics Scale,\nwhich assessed emotional, physical, and severe physical\nconflict with the mother and father. Each dimension of con-\nflict was assessed with a single item. For example, emotion-\nal conflict was assessed by asking participants to indicate\nhow often their mother/father: insulted or swore at them,\nsulked or refused to talk to them, did something spiteful,\nthreatened them, or stomped out of the room. Participants\nrated the frequency of such behaviors on a 4-point scale (4 =\nnever, 3 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 1 = often). Physical con-\nflict included pushing, grabbing, slapping, and throwing ob-\njects. Severe physical conflict involved being kicked, bitten,\nor hit you with a fist or other object, beat up, choked, burned,\nor scalded. We recoded each item as 0 = never, 1 = all other\nresponses, and summed the items across emotional, physi-\ncal, and severe physical conflict to generate an indicator of\nlevel of conflict in which each parent was reported to have\nengaged. Thus, scores could range from 0 (none of the be-\nhaviors ever happened) to 3 (conflict occurred in each of the\nthree domains at least occasionally; a for dichotomized\nitems = .65 and .68 for mothers and fathers, respectively).\nIn order to differentiate overall family levels of maternal\nand paternal affection, discipline, and conflict from the dif-\nferential experiences of specific children within those fami-\nlies,wealsocalculatedaveragelevelsofaffection,discipline,\nand conflict among all siblings in the family and relative\n(i.e., deviations from the family mean) treatment compared\nwith one's siblings (i.e., favored vs. unfavored). Thus, all\noffspring from the same family would have the same aver-\nage levels of recalled parental treatment, but each offspring\nwithin the same family could have different relative levels\nof recalled parental treatment.\nIndividual positive and negative affect.--Measures of\ncurrent positive and negative affect were used to assess in-\ndividual well-being, after preliminary analyses indicated\nthat measures of variables such as depressive symptoms had\nvery low means and little variability in the sample. Partici-\npants rated their positive and negative affect during the past\nnone of the time). Positive feelings included being cheerful,\nin good spirits, extremely happy, satisfied, and full of life.\nItems assessing distress included feeling nervous, so sad\nnothing could cheer you up, hopeless, restless, and fidgety.\nDevelopment of these measures has been reported previ-\nand negative affect, respectively). Descriptive statistics for\nall study variables are presented in Table 1.\nAnalysis Plan\nTo account for the nonindependence of observations from\nmultiple siblings within the same family, we used general-\nized estimating equations to estimate all models (see Liang &\nis very flexible, permitting a wide variety of outcome vari-\nables (continuous, categorical, etc.) and error structures (ex-\nchangeable, autoregressive, etc.). Additionally, as estimated\nusing the Stata software package, it was possible to obtain\nrobust (to violations of the specified error structure) standard\nerror estimates.\nOur analysis proceeded in three distinct steps. To address\nour first research question, regarding the proportion of vari-\nance in each of our outcomes which could be explained by\nfamily membership, we estimated intercept-only models\n(i.e., no predictors) to obtain these estimates directly (Table\n1). In order to address our second research question, regard-\ning within- and between-family predictors of recalled pa-\nrental treatment, we estimated separate models for each\ndimension of recalled maternal and paternal treatment (Ta-\nble 2). Affection and discipline were treated as continuous\nvariables, and conflict was treated as ordinal. These vari-\nables, in turn, became predictors for our models predicting\npositive and negative affect to address our third research\nquestion. For these analyses, we included both average and\nrelative levels of recalled parental treatment as predictor\nvariables in order to differentiate the effects of between-\nfamily and within-family predictors, respectively (Table 3).\nResults\nProportion of Variability Shared Within Families\nA number of approaches can be used to reflect within-\nthat one useful way is the intraclass correlation coefficient\n(ICC), which can be interpreted as the expected correlation\nbetween two units (i.e., siblings) from within the same\ngroup (i.e., family). As can be seen in Table 1, there was\nconsiderable within-family similarity in recalled parental\ntreatment. Specifically, the ICC was 0.33 for recalled mater-\nnal affection, 0.39 for maternal discipline, and 0.24 for ma-\nternal conflict. ICC values were similar but consistently\ncipline, and conflict, respectively. Consistent with expecta-\ntions, family membership was somewhat less predictive of\nvariations in neuroticism (0.17) and extraversion (0.19) and\neven less so for positive and negative affect, with ICC val-\nues of 0.12 and 0.08, respectively. Overall, then, this sug-\ngests that family is an important source of common variance\nin recalled parental treatment.\nPredictors of Variability in Recalled Parental Treatment\nHaving established that a considerable proportion of the\nvariation in recalled parental treatment can be explained by\nfamily membership, we next identified predictors of this\nvariation to address our second research question. Results\nare presented in Table 2.\nMaternal affection.--Several demographic characteris-\ntics predicted recalled maternal affection. On average,\ndaughters reported lower maternal affection than sons (b =\n\u00ad0.19, p < .01). Married children recalled mothers as more\naffectionate (b = 0.15, p < .01), but subsequent marriages\nwere associated with lower recalled maternal affection (b =\n\u00ad0.12, p < .01). Additionally, individuals recalled mothers\nas less affectionate if they were themselves parents (b =\n\u00ad0.18, p < .01). Child personal characteristics were also im-\nportant. Individuals recalled greater maternal affection if\nthey were lower on neuroticism (b = \u00ad0.07, p < .05) and\nhigher on extraversion (b = 0.18, p < .01). None of the fam-\nily structure characteristics were significant predictors of\nrecalled maternal affection. Recalled family environment,\nhowever, included several significant predictors. Children\nrecalled mothers as being more affectionate if they also re-\nported that fathers were in better health when the child was\nMaternal discipline.--None of the offspring demograph-\nic characteristics predicted recalled maternal discipline. In\nterms of offspring personal characteristics, discipline was\nperceived as stricter if offspring were more extraverted (b =\n0.14, p < .01). Offspring recalled their mothers to be stricter\nwhen fathers had lower formal education (b = \u00ad0.03,\nTable 1.

No other recalled family environment characteristics\nwere associated with maternal discipline.\nMaternal conflict.--Older offspring recalled less mater-\nnal conflict (b = \u00ad0.02, p < .05) and offspring higher on\nneuroticism recalled more maternal conflict (b = 0.55, p <\n.01). The higher the proportion of opposite-sex siblings (b =\nthe lower the recalled maternal conflict. Recalled conflict\nwas lower if mothers were in better health when the off-\nPaternal affection.--Older offspring (b = 0.01, p < .05),\nmarried offspring (b = 0.16, p < .01), those with less formal\neducation (b = \u00ad0.07, p < .05), who had fewer previous mar-\nriages (b = \u00ad0.09, p < .05), and were more extraverted (b =\n0.22, p < .01) recalled greater paternal affection. Siblings\nfrom smaller families (b = \u00ad0.03, p < .05) recalled their\nfathers to be more affectionate. Offspring also recalled their\nfathers to be more affectionate if their fathers were in better\nPaternal discipline.--Sons (b = \u00ad0.15, p < .01) and mar-\nried offspring (b = 0.17, p < .01) recalled stricter paternal\ndiscipline, as did offspring who were more extraverted (b =\np < .05). Discipline was recalled to be more strict (b =\n0.03, p < .05) when offspring came from larger families. No\nrecalled family environment variables predicted recalled\npaternal discipline.\nPaternal conflict.--Younger offspring (b = \u00ad0.02, p < .05)\nand sons (b = \u00ad0.56, p < .01) recalled more conflict with\nfathers, as did individuals higher in neuroticism (b = 0.51,\np < .01). Offspring recalled less paternal conflict if they had\nmore opposite-sex siblings (b = \u00ad0.57, p < .01) and smaller\nfamilies (b = 0.16, p < .01). Recalled conflict was lower if\nTable 2.

Results are presented in Table 3.\nPositive affect.--Married individuals reported higher\nlevels of positive affect than did those without a spouse\npositive affect if they were lower on neuroticism (b = \u00ad2.69,\nbetter self-rated (b = 0.43, p < .01) and age-relative health\n(b = \u00ad0.50, p < .01). At the family level, higher average\nmaternal affection (b = 0.75, p < .01) and stricter maternal\ndiscipline (b = 0.52, p < .05) were both associated with\nhigher levels of positive affect. Offspring who reported\nhigher relative levels of maternal affection than their siblings\n(b = 0.62, p < .05), but lower levels of maternal discipline\n(b = \u00ad0.74, p < .01) reported higher positive affect.\nNegative affect.--Offspring who were married reported\nlower levels of negative affect (b = \u00ad1.05, p < .01). Individu-\nals higher on neuroticism (b = 2.46, p < .01), lower on ex-\ntraversion (b = \u00ad0.55, p < .01), and in poor self-rated (b =\n0.52, p < .01) health reported more negative affect. No fam-\nily structure or recalled family environment variable was\nassociated with negative affect. In terms of recalled parental\ntreatment, those recalling greater maternal affection than\ntheir siblings also reported lower levels of negative affect\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we set out to identify the extent to which\nrecalled parental treatment could be explained by family\nmembership, to identify within- and between-family pre-\ndictors of these variations and, in turn, the extent to which\nshared and unique aspects of recalled parental treatment\nwere associated with current positive and negative affect.\nThis study extended previous research in several regards.\nFirst, it employed a within-family design to investigate the\ncorrelates of differential treatment, both between and within\nfamilies simultaneously. Second, it extended consideration\nof the effects of differential treatment into midlife, examin-\ning a representative sample of adults aged 26\u00ad74 years.\nThird, our models included several of the most important\npotential confounds likely to affect differential treatment\nusing retrospective data regarding recalled parental treat-\nment. Specifically, we considered the role of child social\nindex variables, child psychological variables, particularly\npersonality and physical health, family structure, recalled\nearly family environment, and parents' current status.\nWhat Proportion of the Variability in Recalled Parental\nTreatment and Positive and Negative Affect Can Be\nExplained by Family Membership?\nAs noted at the beginning of this paper, a number of fac-\ntors are potentially confounded in between-family studies\nexamining recalled parental treatment and its associations\nwith positive and negative affect. Well-adjusted parents may\ntend both to parent well and to have well-adjusted children.\nTo what factor or factors should we attribute positive out-\ncomes among offspring? Similarly, it is important to rec-\nognize that families develop over time. Thus, the family\nenvironment experienced by the oldest child may differ\ndramatically from the environment experienced by the\nTable 3. Predictors of Positive and Negative Affect\nPositive Affect Negative Affect\nOffspring demographics\nOffspring personal characteristics\nFamily structure\nRecalled family environment\nParents' current status\nRecalled parental treatment\nyoungest child. However, effects of birth order and family\nsize are confounded in between-family designs.\nAlthough differential treatment from parents is well\nestablished earlier in the lifespan the persistence of these\ndifferences into midlife is not clear. In this study, we found\nthat a considerable proportion of the variance, typically one\nquarter to two fifths, was associated with family member-\nship, consistent with previous research (e.g., McCrae &\nCosta, 1988b), and can thus be attributed to sources such as\nparents and shared family environment. The remainder,\nhowever, is unique to each child within the family.As would\nbe expected, the unique component is substantially larger\nfor the more situationally determined constructs of positive\nand negative affect and intermediate for the theoretically\nmediating constructs of neuroticism and extraversion (cf.\nThe behavioral genetics literature reveals that although\nsiblings share an environment, individual experiences also\naccount for a considerable portion of the variance in spe-\ncific outcomes similar to positive and negative affect and\nthat this proportion may increase in adulthood. Indeed, the\nICCs of 0.20 to 0.40 are similar or even relatively high com-\npared with what other studies in this area find (e.g., McCrae\nSocialization theories assume that shared experiences\nlead to similarities among siblings. Our finding that the ma-\njority of variance in each outcome is explained by within-\nfamily rather than between-family variability is consistent\nwith the results from a substantial behavioral genetics re-\nsearch base that consistently indicates that most variance\nlies within rather than between families (Maccoby & Martin,\n1983) and results in vast differences between siblings raised\nin the same family with regard to personality and well-being\ndifferences between siblings in the same family are believed\nto be due largely to four sources of NSE: differential treat-\nment, differential sibling experiences, differential peer\nexperiences, and accidents and illnesses unique to the indi-\nvidual (Plomin & Daniels, 1987). NSE experiences are\nmore common than shared experiences and accumulate over\ntime to create increasing differences between siblings across\ndevelopment. Similarities between siblings are primarily\nbelieved to be the result of genetic influences rather than a\ncommon family environment.\nWhat Individual and Family Factors Predict Variability in\nAdults'Recollections of Maternal and Paternal Affection,\nDiscipline, and Conflict?\nGiven that there is substantial variability both within and\nbetween families in recalled parental treatment, we next\nconsidered which factors were systematically associated\nwith the dimensions of recalled affection, discipline, and\nconflict with mothers and fathers. We find that adult siblings\nwithin the same families often have different recalled\nexperiences with parental treatment, that these differences\nare systematic in nature, and that predictors differ both\nacross domains of treatment and between mothers and fa-\nthers. Looking toward child demographic characteristics,\nwe find that having a spouse generally appears to be linked\nwith recalled parental treatment in a positive way, being as-\nsociated with maternal and paternal affection, as well as\npaternal discipline. By contrast a greater number of previ-\nous marriages is associated with recollection of less affec-\ntionate parenting by both parents. In addition to spouses, the\npresence of biological children is also associated with lower\nrecalled maternal affection. Whether this is evidence that\ncurrent social relationships are important in determining\nhow early relationships are (re)interpreted or that early ex-\nperiences shape current relationship functioning requires\nlongitudinal data (Andersson & Stevens, 1993; Main,\nPersonality also appears to have a consistent role in re-\ncalled differential treatment, with extraversion being most\nstrongly associated with the positive aspects of parenting by\nmothers and fathers, and neuroticism most consistently as-\nsociated with the negative aspects of parenting, specifically\nmaternal and paternal conflict. These findings are consistent\nwith a variety of previous research suggesting that parent-\ning and person characteristics color interpretations of events\nand life circumstances and vice versa (e.g., Halverson,\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that a positive home envi-\nronment in early life contributes to high extraversion and\nlow neuroticism, we can at least say that recalled parenting\nis independently associated with midlife positive and nega-\ntive affect even controlling for personality. We find evidence\nconsistent with previous research suggesting systematic dif-\nferences in recalled parental treatment as a function of per-\nsonality characteristics. Specifically, offspring higher in\nextraversion recalled both mothers and fathers as more af-\nfectionate and stricter disciplinarians, whereas offspring\nhigher in neuroticism recalled greater conflict with both\nparents and less affection from mothers.\nOne of the unique aspects of this study was the use of a\nwithin-family design in order to consider the importance of\nseveral aspects of family structure as predictors of recalled\nparental treatment. Several consistent findings emerged.\nSpecifically, fathers were recalled as less affectionate in\nlarger families. Both recalled discipline and conflict were\nlower for offspring with a higher proportion of opposite-sex\nsiblings. Preliminary models did not find any evidence for\nthe importance of factors such as age spacing between sib-\nlings or effects of birth order; however, other within-family\nresearch from the mother's perspective has suggested that\nthe position of youngest child may hold special significance\nBecause so few studies have applied within-family de-\nsigns to consider differences in recalled parental treatment\nin adulthood, there is little theoretical or conceptual\nguidance regarding which aspects of the family environ-\nment are likely to be most important. As well, existing sur-\nveys such as MIDUS include relatively few indicators of the\nrecalled early family environment. Those indicators that\nwere available to us were associated with some aspects of\nrecalled parental treatment, but not all. To understand the\nimportance of recalled family environment, it is important\nto recognize that families are systems, and as a result many\ninfluences may be indirect as well as direct. For example, it\nis fathers' health that is associated with recalled maternal\naffection. Fathers who are in better physical shape may also\nhave higher earnings or be more involved in parenting, im-\nproving the overall family environment.\nLikewise, fathers' educational attainment predicts both\nlower recalled maternal discipline and less recalled conflict\nwith fathers. Future research, then, should consider ways of\nmore directly assessing the early family environment in or-\nder to better understand the nature of these associations.\nOne immediate implication of these findings, however, is\nthat later-born children are likely to experience lower levels\nof maternal discipline and paternal conflict than their older\nsiblings because parents' educational attainment is higher\n(as are income and socioeconomic status), on average, for\nlater-born offspring than earlier-born offspring.\nIn the current study, it is notable that age was not consis-\ntently associated with recalled parental treatment. The only\nage effect we detected involved conflict with mothers and\nfathers; older adults recall slightly less conflict. This finding\nis consistent with other studies of remembered negative ex-\nperiences; prior research has found that older adults recall\nbad experiences less negatively than younger adults do\ncalled differential treatment by parents persists into midlife.\nBut is there evidence that this recalled treatment exerts inde-\npendent associations with positive and negative affect over\nand above the current contextual sources that also affect it?\nTo What Extent Are Recollections of Parental Treatment\nAssociated With Current Positive and Negative Affect,\nControlling for Both Individual and Family\nCharacteristics?\nThe demographic and personal characteristics associated\nwith positive and negative affect are remarkably consistent.\nAs was found for recalled parental treatment, being married\nis associated with higher levels of positive affect and lower\nlevels of negative affect and is the only significant demo-\ngraphic predictor. Thus, current relationships with spouse\nor children might influence the way that past relationships\nwith parents are remembered. Alternatively, childhood ex-\nperiences with parents may be associated with a greater or\nlesser likelihood of marrying and/or having children of\none's own.\nAll four personal characteristics were significant for both\npositive and negative affect, with higher neuroticism\npredicting lower positive affect and higher negative affect,\nhigher extraversion predicting higher positive affect and\nlower negative affect, better self-rated health predicting\nhigher positive affect and lower negative affect, and poorer\nage-relative health predicting lower positive affect and\nhigher negative affect.\nIn terms of implications, the fact that memories of child-\nhood experiences show persistent associations with well-\nbeing across the full adult range suggests the potency of these\nexperiences in forming life trajectories and experiences.\nWe connect this research to the premise that early experi-\nences with parents in the context of families (i.e., siblings)\nmay have persistent (albeit minor) effects into late life,\neven after individuals have established ties to spouses and\nchildren of their own. Moreover, consistent with prior studies\n(Shmotkin, 1999), memories of parents may play a role in the\nwell-being of adults even after their parents are deceased.\nIn contrast, none of the family structure or recalled family\nenvironment variables was important for either positive or\nnegative affect. This is consistent with the lower within-\nfamily variability observed for these outcomes, compared\nwith recalled parental treatment. Whereas the recalled envi-\nronment itself was not important, recalled parental treatment\nwithin that environment was significantly associated with\npositive and negative affect, and the results are informative\nfor considering differences within and between families.\nAverage recalled maternal affection, a between-family\ncharacteristic, predicts higher positive affect. Thus, all off-\nspring benefit from growing up in a household where moth-\ners are seen as more affectionate. Relative perceptions of\nmaternal affection, a within-family characteristic, is also\nimportant, however, with offspring who report greater lev-\nels of recalled maternal affection than their siblings also\nreporting higher levels of positive affect. In contrast, only\nhigher relative maternal affection predicts lower negative\naffect. Thus, the benefits of favored status (or at least the\nperceptions of favored status) continue to have positive im-\nplications for well-being into midlife, consistent with what\nhas been found with younger siblings (Stocker, 1995).\nSomewhat contrasting findings emerge for the effects of\nmaternal discipline. Average recalled maternal discipline\npredicts higher positive affect. For all offspring within the\nfamily, then, there appear to be benefits of a stricter house-\nhold. However, there was also a negative association be-\ntween recalled relative maternal discipline and positive\naffect. In other words, this is particularly true if mothers\nwere recalled as less strict for oneself than one's siblings.\nWhat we cannot discern from these data is how the shared\nand individual experiences translate into parental behavior.\nDoes strict maternal discipline translate into greater atten-\ntion and concern and thus predict better current function-\ning? Did offspring who received stricter maternal discipline\nfrom mothers than their siblings exhibit more problematic\nbehaviors in childhood which required greater maternal\ncontrol, the effects of which carry over into adulthood?\nMothers are more involved with child care and have\ncloser relationships with their children than fathers do. Most\nearly within-family comparisons of differential treatment\nfocused on mothers, but mothers and fathers interact with\ntheir offspring in distinctly different ways (Parke, 1978;\nSiegel, 1987). Research comparing mothers' versus fathers'\ndifferential treatment shows that mothers and fathers en-\nMcHale et al., 1995). Comparison of mothers versus fathers\nin various domains, however, reveals that in the domains of\naffection and temporal involvement, less than half of moth-\ners and fathers reported the same differential treatment pat-\ntern (Tucker et al., 2003). Despite these studies, little is\nknown about fathers' role in this dynamic and highlights the\nimportance of including reports of mothers' and fathers' dif-\nferential treatment.\nLimitations\nAlthough the use of a large, representative sample across\na wide age range is clearly an important strength of the cur-\nrent study, there are also several limitations. To begin, these\ndata are cross-sectional in nature, limiting the ability to\nreach any causal inferences because both our predictor vari-\nables and outcomes were assessed on the same occasion. In\naddition to the usual biases associated with retrospective\ndata, which we attempted to control as fully as possible, the\nmeasures considered here are still relatively crude with re-\ngard to early parental treatment. It is not clear whether the\nfull range of parenting behaviors have been adequately re-\nflected in the positive and negative aspects of parental treat-\nment available in the MIDUS data set. Certainly, too, the\nmeasures blur the range and dynamics of earlier experiences\neither by selecting a specific time point (i.e., age 16) or ag-\ngregating across periods of childhood (\"How much of your\nchildhood . . .\" or \"When you were growing up . . .\"). De-\nspite these limitations, the current study suggests that repre-\nsentations of past relationships with parents continue to vary\nin systematic ways both within and between families. In\nturn, these systematic differences continue to independently\npredict current psychological well-being across midlife.\nLongitudinal data linking childhood relationships with\nparents to adult outcomes are nearly nonexistent in the\nUnited States and certainly not in the types of national stud-\nies we have with MIDUS. Therefore, sociologists have\ncommonly used memories of parental relationships as a\nproxy for ties to parents in childhood, and researchers also\ncommonly refer to these memories as representations of the\nactual relationship in childhood (e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990;\n2003). Thus, our approach represents a somewhat more so-\nphisticated take on the meaning of these variables. As prior\nsociological research points out, these variables do repre-\nsent past experiences, but they also represent potential re-\nconstructions of the past (based on present circumstances).\nTo extend these arguments into implications for the\nfield, we consider the research of scholars who have shown\nthat narrative life construction has implications for health\nand well-being in late life (e.g., McAdams, 2001). In other\nwords, it is not simply the events we experienced in the\npast, but the way we view those events that makes a differ-\nence for psychological well-being. As this study of sib-\nlings suggests, even individuals who grow up in the same\nhousehold and who share the same parents may have very\ndifferent ways of constructing or remembering that past,\nand those memories have implications for their individual\nwell-being.\nDirections for Future Research\nWhat remains for future research to address is the precise\nsource of these within-family differences. Whether these\ndifferences reflect true long-term effects of parental differ-\nential treatment in a fashion consistent with children's NSE\nwe are tapping another dimension of the implications of the\nparent\u00adchild tie on well-being in adulthood (Umberson &\nChen, 1994) remains to be addressed. Although the mea-\nsures refer to individual siblings' childhood experiences,\nthese relationships have been (re)interpreted by individuals\nand their siblings into adulthood and midlife. The subse-\nquent importance of continued sibling (and parental) ties\nmay be every bit as important as the early childhood experi-\nences themselves. In sum, we are aware that the study as-\nsessed memories, which probably reflect some truth\nregarding the early environment as well as factors that have\nshaped those memories since that time.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the John D. and Catherine T.
