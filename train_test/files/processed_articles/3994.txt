The HPV is primarily sexually transmitted\n(Lenselink et al., 2008). The HPV vaccines are mostly tar-\ngeted on young adolescent girls and they are most effective\nif given to HPV-unexposed girls. Research has captured\ndiverse fears about HPV vaccination of young adolescent\ngirls. Some of the fears are related to safety and unknown\nside effects; the possibility of jeopardizing the future fertil-\nity of vaccinated girls; and the misunderstanding in some\nenvironments that the vaccinations are meant to control fer-\ntility or reduce the population of certain groups (Agosti and\net al., 2012). Moreover, many children loathe injections\nbecause they are painful, frightening, and psychologically\nstressful (French et al., 1994). Fear of HPV vaccination is\nknown to be associated with significant distress among tar-\ngeted adolescents (Bernard et al., 2011).

In this study, we considered HPV\nvaccinations and the associated worries to constitute stress-\nful events, which are threatening and undesirable rather\nthan life readjustment due to change per se (Vinokur and\nSelzer, 1975). Research has demonstrated a consistency in\nthe relation between life stress (life events) and distress\n2011, cohorts of adolescent girls from primary schools in\nIbanda and Nakasongola districts, Uganda were vaccinated\nannually against HPV. The vaccination was part of a dem-\nonstration project by the Uganda Government and PATH to\nevaluate different HPV vaccine delivery strategies. A\nschool-based HPV vaccine delivery strategy was adopted\nin Ibanda district targeting girls enrolled in primary grade 5\n(P5). In Nakasongola district, the HPV vaccine was deliv-\nered during the routine Child Days Plus (CDP) program,\ntargeting girls of at least 10years. Each eligible girl was to\nreceive three doses of the vaccine administered in Month 1,\nthis study was to assess adolescent girls' psychological dis-\ntress in Ibanda district, following HPV vaccination. Based\non the psychosocial paradigm of stress\u00addistress relation-\nship, it was hypothesized in the research for this article that\ngirls vaccinated against HPV compared to unvaccinated\ngirls were more likely to have had worrisome thoughts\nabout vaccination and to experience high psychological\ndistress.\nMethods\nDesign\nThis comparative, mixed methods cross-sectional study\nwas conducted between November and December 2011.\nGirls vaccinated against HPV were drawn from Ibanda dis-\ntrict while unvaccinated participants for comparison were\nselected from Mbarara district.\nParticipants\nPrimary school education in Uganda occurs over 7\nyears,\nbeginning with Primary 1 (P1) and ending with Primary 7\n(P7). The participants in this study were girls enrolled in\nPrimary 5 (P5) and Primary 6 (P6). Vaccinated P6 study\nparticipants had completed their vaccination 13\nmonths\nbefore, while their P5 colleagues completed vaccination\nmonth prior to the date of data collection. During data\nanalysis, the latter were considered as recently vaccinated.\nUsing multi-stage sampling, 16 selected schools in Ibanda\ndistrict and the same number in Mbarara district were strat-\nified by rural\u00adurban location. In Ibanda district, all assent-\ning P5 and P6 girls present on the day of the survey that had\nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine were\nrecruited. Similar criteria were followed for the unvacci-\nnated comparison group in Mbarara district. A sample size\nof 800 girls was determined for the survey using the for-\nmula for sample size calculation to compare two propor-\ndistrict) participated. There were 23 non-responders includ-\ning those who were absent from school and those who\ndid not return their parents' consent forms. Five focus\ngroup discussions (FGDs) each with 8\u00ad12 vaccinated girls\nin P5 or P6 were conducted one per school in Ibanda\ndistrict, involving five schools that had not been sampled\nfor the survey. FGD participants aged 13\u00ad16\nyears were\nselected purposively with the help of teachers, targeting\nself-confident and uninhibited girls who could talk freely in\na group. Girls who participated in FGDs had to have been\nvaccinated against HPV so as to capture their observations\nand experiences during vaccination.\nData collection\nA survey questionnaire and FGDs were used to collect data.\nSelected girls were assembled in a room on the day of the\nsurvey. A pre-tested and translated self-administered ques-\ntionnaire was used. Each girl filled the questionnaire under\nclose supervision of the first author (A.K.T.) and research\nassistants who also explained to them the purpose and pro-\ncedure of the survey. Data were collected first in Ibanda\ndistrict before Mbarara district. FGDs were conducted by\nA.K.T. and a research assistant after survey data collection\nin Ibanda district.\nMeasures\nIndependent variables were socio-demographic character-\nistics (age, class attended, kind of school, location of\nschool, having parents, and perceived parental communica-\ntion) and HPV vaccination status. Dependent variables\nwere worrisome thoughts about being vaccinated and level\nof psychological distress. Moderator variable was knowl-\nedge of HPV and HPV vaccine. Each variable was assessed\nthrough responses to a set of questions or statements. The\nvariables were analyzed as dichotomous.\nHPV vaccination status was assessed by asking respond-\nents whether they had ever been vaccinated against HPV.\nWorrisome thoughts were assessed by asking respondents\nwhether they had ever felt very worried about having been\nvaccinated or going to be vaccinated.\nPsychological distress was assessed using the self-\nadministered Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire\nSDQ has 25 items, some positive and others negative. The\nitems are divided between five scales each with five items:\nemotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/\ninattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial\nbehavior. The first four scales are added together to gener-\nate a Total Difficulties Scale (TDS) based on 20 items with\nTuriho et al. 3\nscores ranging from 0 to 40. A cut-off score of 20 is usually\nused to identify likely \"cases\" with non-specific mental\nhealth disorders. In this study, TDS scores ranged from 1 to\n30. In order to make our findings comparable with other\nMoscardino et al., 2012) that used the SDQ to assess ado-\nlescent psychological distress in the same country, Uganda,\nwe adopted a cut-off score of 16 to indicate adolescents'\nhigh psychological distress. Scores 1\u00ad15 were banded to\ndenote low psychological distress, whereas scores 16\u00ad30\nwere banded to denote high psychological distress.\nKnowledge was assessed through responses to 13\nfactual statements based on information from the print\nmaterials used for community sensitization prior to HPV\nvaccination. Perceived parental communication was\nassessed by asking respondents how often their parents or\nguardians talked to them about their future and the dangers\nof pre-marital sex.\nData analysis\nQuantitative data were analyzed for 769 girls. Data for\neight girls were excluded from the analysis when their\nyears) was found to be above 16\nyears, the\nupper age limit for the version of SDQ used in this study.\nData were entered and cleaned using EpiData, and\nUnivariate analysis was done to generate frequencies\nand percentages for categorical variables. Means and\nstandard deviations (SDs) were generated for continuous\nvariables. The independent samples t-test was the statis-\ntical test used to compare the continuous variables. Since\nour sample was clustered by schools, we conducted com-\nplex sample analyses by applying sampling weights to\nthe statistics (means, percentages, and odds ratios (ORs))\nto take care of the effect of the sampling design. At\nbivariate level, we evaluated relationships between inde-\npendent and dependent variables using the Pearson 2\ntest to determine statistical significance of observed dif-\nferences. We performed complex samples logistic regres-\nsion to test the hypothesis that girls vaccinated against\nHPV were more likely to report worrisome thoughts\nabout vaccination and high psychological distress. In the\nanalysis, we compared proportions of girls vaccinated\nagainst HPV with proportions of unvaccinated girls.\nRelevant ORs with corresponding confidence intervals\n(CIs) set at 95percent were determined. Level of statistical\nQualitative data were transcribed, word processed, and\nentered into ATLAS.ti GmbH (1993) for coding and analy-\nsis. Codes were developed based on the broad themes iden-\ntified from the data. The codes were used to retrieve\nsegments of the data.

Apparently,\nmuch of the reported worry especially concerning pain and\npossible physical harm from injection was anticipatory,\nwhich is a normal response to a perceived threat but an\nunnecessary psychological trauma if no real threat exists\n(Bernard et al., 2011). Qualitative findings indicated that\nthe fear of pain and possible physical harm from injection\nwas usually short-lived, suggesting that time was protec-\ntive. Some girls were said to have missed the initial vaccine\ndosages out of fear only to accept later after realizing that\nthose who had taken the vaccine had not been harmed. This\nbehavior toward the HPV vaccine has previously been\nnoted among both adolescents and their parents in other\nTable 1.

Comparable studies that assessed\nadolescent psychological distress in Uganda using the SDQ\nand a cut-off TDS score of 16 to indicate clinically signifi-\ncant distress were conducted on adolescent samples drawn\nfrom largely high-risk populations in war-affected northern\nand north-eastern Uganda. Compared to the findings of\npercent prevalence of clinically sig-\nnificant distress among vaccinated adolescents in our study\nis clearly higher than the 18.3percent among non-abducted\nadolescents but lower than the 51.2\npercent among war-\nabducted adolescents in a war-affected district (Okello et al.,\npercent among males and\n29.7percent among females from two war-affected and two\nnon-war-affected districts (Abbo et al., 2013); and it is\ngreater than the 33.7percent among never abducted adoles-\ncents but less than the 67.7percent among child soldiers in a\nwar-affected district (Moscardino et al., 2012). Our finding\nshowing relatively high prevalence of distress among vac-\ncinated girls is inconsistent with previous studies of children\nyears undergoing other vaccinations (cited in\nCohen et al., 1999). It was observed from those studies that\nas children grow older they acquire more sophisticated and\nlogical thinking processes and are able to understand the\nrationale for medical procedures. Consequently, they tend to\nexperience decreased worry, distress, and pain (Cohen et al.,\n1999). However, our findings are largely in agreement with\nfindings of a qualitative study of adolescent girls' response\nto HPV vaccination under a school-based vaccine delivery\narrangement (Bernard et al., 2011), which reported that fear\nand distress were commonplace. The study cited negative\nrumors or misinformation among the major factors behind\nTable 2.

In our study, qualitative results show\nvarious negative beliefs the vaccinated adolescents had\nabout HPV vaccination, which were largely based on rumors\nand misinformation. Different FGD participants heard\nrumors that those vaccinated could become barren or would\nface a greater risk of life-threatening childbirth complica-\ntions, HPV vaccination was a disguised plot to gradually kill\nthose vaccinated in unexplained ways, HPV vaccine causes\ncervical cancer that would ultimately kill the vaccinated\nperson, and that those vaccinated would in future give birth\nto only twins. Some of the vaccinated girls worried that it\nwould alter their menstrual cycles. The rumors, though not\nbacked by scientific evidence, are potential sources of dis-\ntress if they are perceived as real. The positive association\nbetween major stressors (such as negative life events) and\npsychological distress has been previously confirmed\namong adolescents in studies not related to HPV vaccina-\nevents are especially distressing if they are viewed as unde-\nsirable, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. Distress is pre-\ndicted by the perception and the interpretation of events (as\nnegative) rather than by the occurrence of events themselves\n(Jackson and Finney, 2002). In the context of HPV vaccina-\ntion, it has been reported that being informed about and well\nprepared for vaccination may reduce the propagation of\nmyths, rumors, and other fear-promoting factors (Bernard\net al., 2011). Future HPV vaccination programs should\ninclude sensitization strategies to counteract the negative\nrumors about the vaccinations so as to mitigate fear and\nanxiety among targeted adolescents. In particular, future\nsensitization programs need to explore the strategy of peer\ninvolvement to mitigate targeted adolescents' fear and anxi-\nety. This suggestion is informed by this study's qualitative\nfindings showing that some vaccinated girls were mainly\nencouraged by their friends to get vaccinated against the\nHPV without fully understanding the vaccination, implying\nthat peer influence may have mitigated some of the fears\nassociated with the vaccination. Moreover, in the study by\nBernard and colleagues (Bernard et al., 2011), girls'concern\nabout their possible reactions in front of peers seemed to\namplify fear in some cases, yet having friends available in\nthe vaccination room to support them by holding arms or\ntalking to them had the reverse effect. Peer influence is a\nknown positive and negative factor in shaping adolescent\nattitudes about HPV vaccine (Gamble et al., 2010; Katz\nHigh psychological distress was especially likely if the\ngirls were recently vaccinated, consistent with findings of\nanother study that reported high levels of distress among\nchildren during immunization in different settings (Cohen\net al., 1997). High distress was also likely if the vacci-\nnated girls reported worrisome thoughts about being\nvaccinated. This is in agreement with findings of the study\n(Bernard et al., 2011), which concluded that fear of HPV\nvaccination was a near universal experience among ado-\nlescents undergoing HPV vaccination in a school setting\nand was often associated with significant distress. Some\ngirls in our study's FGDs reported that while being pre-\npared for HPV vaccination, they felt anxious that it would\ncause pain, bleeding, and irritation based on what they\nheard from their friends at school. Many reported experi-\nencing pain and swelling at the injection site, which ini-\ntially caused worries of probable long-term physical\ndamage. These and other known adverse effects like diz-\nziness and headache have been reported in other studies\n(Katahoire et al., 2013) but they are usually brief and non-\nserious (WHO, 2012). Since this study's findings suggest\nthat both distress and worry especially about pain and\npossible physical harm from injection were largely short-\nterm phenomena, there is a need for a psychosocial com-\nponent in future HPV vaccinations to identify and address\nthe affected adolescents' immediate psychosocial needs.\nHealth workers who administer the vaccines should be\ntrained in basic cognitive and behavioral interventions\nthat have been found to be effective in mitigating pain and\ndistress during immunizations such as child distraction,\nencouraging the child to adopt the stress-reduction\nbehavior, imagery, preparation/information, modeling,\nrehearsal, and desensitization (Bernard et al., 2011; Cohen\nfuture sensitization prior to HPV vaccinations should\nclearly articulate the non-serious nature of the vaccine's\nknown adverse effects, their remedies, and their brevity so\nas to minimize worry and possible distress among the tar-\ngeted adolescents.\nPerceiving high parental communication mitigated ado-\nlescent girls' distress associated with HPV vaccination.\nThis finding supports results of studies (Jackson et al.,\nwhich show positive correlation between parent\u00adadoles-\ncent communication and adolescent psychological well-\nbeing. Our finding is in agreement with the study of\nadolescent girls undergoing HPV vaccination (Bernard\net al., 2011), where the responsible nurses reported that\nparents who discussed HPV vaccination with their adoles-\ncent girls helped to prepare them for the experience. It is\nlikely that in our study, the parents/guardians of vaccinated\nadolescents who communicated highly with them included\nHPV vaccination in their discussion with the adolescents\nand prepared them for the vaccination, leading to parental\ncommunication's mitigation of the adolescents' psycho-\nlogical distress. Future HPV vaccination programs should\ninvest adequately in sensitization of parents and encourag-\ning them to talk about vaccination with their adolescents\nso as to make vaccination a positive experience for the\nadolescents.\n8 Health Psychology Open \nStudy limitations\nThere was a possibility of recall bias among P6 girls who\nwere interviewed 1\nyear after vaccination. This was mini-\nmized during assessment for psychological distress by ask-\ning respondents how things had been in the last 6\nmonths.\nOne vaccination cohort (P6) was studied 1\nyear after com-\npletion of vaccination while the other (P5) was studied\nmonth after vaccination. This was a limitation because\nsome of the psychological reactions to the vaccinations may\nhave subsided or cleared by the time of field data collection\nfor this study. Moreover, girls who may have developed\nclinically significant psychological distress during vaccina-\ntion were denied opportunity for early detection and treat-\nment. Future vaccination programs need to include\npsychological distress assessment to further evaluate time\npattern of clinically significant distress and to enable the\naffected girls to get timely therapeutic intervention. The age\ndesign of the study whereby the same age cohort was simul-\ntaneously studied poses a limitation, whereby cause\u00adeffect\nrelationships between variables could not be evaluated.\nLonger term follow-up studies involving more than one age\ncohort will be needed in future to be able to assess adoles-\ncents' long-term psychological reactions to HPV vaccina-\ntions. A major limitation of the study was the assessment of\nworrisome thoughts by asking respondents whether they had\never felt very worried about having been vaccinated or going\nto be vaccinated without delving into aspects such as content\nand degree of worry. All respondents who responded affirm-\natively to the question were treated as homogenous during\ndata analysis, which may not be true in reality. This limited\nthe ability of the study to make recommendations for focused\nclinical interventions to deal with adolescents' anxiety asso-\nciated with the vaccination. Furthermore, by not specifying\nworry content, the study left a possibility that the worry\nreported by respondents could have been induced by some of\nthe topics covered in the study questionnaire such as cervical\ncancer and dangers of pre-marital sex and the future, which\nmay be independently related to worry about HPV vaccina-\ntion. Future studies should adopt standard instruments for\nassessment of worrisome thoughts whose findings would\nprovide firm basis for recommendation of clinical interven-\ntions to deal with the affected adolescents'anxiety. Selection\nof FGD participants with the help of their teachers targeting\ngirls sharing certain characteristics may have biased the\nqualitative results since those girls could have shared atti-\ntudes associated with shared characteristics. The effect of\nthis was minimized by organizing FGDs in five different\nschools. The main strength of this study is its relatively large\nsample size that increased the power of the study tests.\nConclusion\nWe set out to assess the influence of HPV vaccination on\nadolescents' experience of worrisome thoughts about\nvaccination and levels of psychological distress. HPV\nvaccination predicted experience of worrisome thoughts\nonly among recently vaccinated adolescents. Several HPV\nvaccination-related fears were reported qualitatively among\nvaccinated girls. HPV vaccination predicted high psycho-\nlogical distress, more so if the adolescents had completed\ntheir vaccination doses recently, and had experienced wor-\nrisome thoughts about being vaccinated. Perceiving high\nparental communication mitigated psychological distress\namong adolescent girls vaccinated against HPV. This study\nmakes several recommendations for future HPV vaccina-\ntion program design and research based on findings, related\nliterature, and study limitations.\n"
