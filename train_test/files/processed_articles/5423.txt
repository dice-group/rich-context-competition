    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis work explores the adoption and implementation of Sport Canada's long-term athlete development (LTAD) model by\ncoaches and tries to understand the barriers to and enablers of these processes. LTAD adoption was studied in 14 coaches\n(5 female, 9 male) in seven sports while implementation was assessed among 10 different coaches (2 female, 8 male) from\nnine sports. Semistructured interviews ascertained coaches' perceptions of and experiences with the LTAD model in their\ncoaching practice. Coaches adhered to the global vision and general principles of LTAD. However, several barriers to LTAD\nadoption and implementation were identified. A mismatch between the model's long-term and the short-term visions of\nresults in sport was perceived as deterrent to LTAD adoption and implementation. Coaches involved in early development\nsports mentioned a lack of compatibility of LTAD with the demands of their sport. Coaches also perceived complexity in\nLTAD athlete's developmental stage determination and the identification of \"windows of opportunity\" or critical periods.\nThese barriers should be addressed to complete diffusion of LTAD among Canadian coaches.\n",

Many models have been developed to help\ncountries, sport clubs, and coaches prepare athletes to reach\ntheir full potential. Bruner, Erickson, Wilson, and C\u00f4t\u00e9\n(2010) suggested that athlete development models were cre-\nated with the mind-set of \"continuity and developmental\nchange across athlete developmental stages.\" C\u00f4t\u00e9, Bruner,\nErickson, Strachan, and Fraser-Thomas (2010) postulated\nthat the key role of coaches at particular points in athletes'\ndevelopment is to consider their global developmental\npathway.\nLong-Term Athlete Development (LTAD)\nIn Canada, Balyi and Way (1995) developed the LTAD\nmodel to help enhance performance by internationally com-\npetitive Canadian athletes in some sports and slow the declin-\ning rate of physical activity by Canadians (Ifedi, 2005). Since\n2005, Sport Canada has promoted the LTAD model to\naddress this decline and help in the development of elite ath-\nSport Canada mentioned LTAD as \". . . one of the potentially\nmost significant advances in Canadian sport since the adop-\ntion of Canadian Sport Policy in 2002 . . .\" (Canadian\nThe backbone of LTAD is built on the physiological prin-\nciples of growth, development, and skill acquisition (Bompa,\nlete development, such as C\u00f4t\u00e9's Developmental Model of\nSport Participation, share similar principles, like avoidance\nof early specialization (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Lidor, & Hackfort, 2009), but\nplace strong emphasis on psychosocial maturation.

In Canada, national sport\norganizations, sport clubs, and sport associations developed\nsport-specific LTAD models and resources to help already-\ncertified and new coaches understand the concept. The\nNational Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) is\nCanada's largest contributor to coaches' knowledge of the\nmodel (Banack, Bloom, & Falcao, 2012; Canadian Sport\nCentres, 2006). Canada's LTAD model is touted as the path-\nway for coaches to develop athletes and increase participa-\ntion in physical activity (Canadian Sport for Life, 2011).\nResearch on LTAD\nDespite the intent of Sport Canada and sport organizations in\nother countries to use LTAD for athlete development,\nresearch on LTAD appears to be found mainly in nonrefereed\nreports (Balyi & Way, 1995) and some research on early ver-\nsions of Balyi and Way's LTAD model (Ford etal., 2011).\nHowever, peer-reviewed research on the LTAD model is\nBlack and Holt (2009), who investigated the perceptions\nof coaches and parents on the implementation of a LTAD-\nbased alpine ski program, found that the model helped\ncoaches to update their knowledge, use consistent language,\nand plan training sessions. However, coaches did not have\nmany other positive comments about the model, and parents\nhad little knowledge of it. Banack etal. (2012) evaluated\nwhether the Canadian NCCP entry-level course (Introduction\nto Community Coaching) was teaching cross-country\ncoaches the basic principles of LTAD. All participants per-\nceived that they were able to identify and integrate key com-\nponents of the model into their coaching practices focused on\nyoung athletes having fun as opposed to worrying about\ncompetition results or talent development. This was consis-\ntent with LTAD recommendations for the 6-year-old and\nyounger age group.\nFrankish etal. (2012) investigated how coaches in three\nCanadian cross-country ski (xc-ski) clubs perceived attri-\nbutes of the LTAD model in their decisions to adopt it accord-\ning to Rogers's (2003) theoretical framework. Their results\nidentified two major trends. First, coaches readily adopted\ncertain aspects of the model (i.e., late specialization with\nyouth participating in multiple sports, lifelong involvement\nin sport, and following developmental stages set out in the\nLTAD model). Second, the characteristics of their club influ-\nenced coaches' perceptions and thus their adoption of the\nmodel. LTAD was adapted in the United Kingdom from the\nsame core model as Canadian LTAD.\nLang and Light (2010) found that swimming coaches in the\nUnited Kingdom had concerns about (a) the negative impact\nof overemphasis in the LTAD model on training volume at the\nexpense of precise techniques, and (b) competition rules in\ntheir sport that appeared to contradict elements of their LTAD.\nFurthermore, Lang and Light noted that increasing specializa-\ntion in swimming at a younger age was incompatible with the\nprinciples and developmental stage of the LTAD model.\nGiven the ambitious task of implementing LTAD in\nCanadian sport, there is a need to understand the challenge of\nLTAD's adoption and implementation by coaches and how\nthey perceive LTAD within their sport context. LTAD's\nadoption and successful implementation depend on coaches\ninvolved in their specific coaching environments. Coaches\nare those who apply LTAD principles on the ground.\nAccording to Rogers's (2003) theory, they are agents of\nchange in relation to the proposed innovation that is LTAD.\nIt is, therefore, important to understand how they perceive\nLTAD and what motivates them to adopt or reject it.\nThe purpose of this article was to explore how coaches\nadopted and implemented Sport Canada's LTAD model and\nto understand the barriers and enablers they see in these pro-\ncesses. This research could link adoption/implementation of\ntalent development in general, and the LTAD model in par-\nticular, from the perspective of sport coaches. LTAD has\nbeenadoptedbyvariouscountries(e.g.,theUnitedKingdom),\nand the present study has the potential to be generalized to\nother sport systems. However, we must warn readers that\nours is not a study of LTAD efficacy.\nTheoretical Framework\nRogers's (2003) Diffusion of Innovations served as a theoreti-\ncal framework. Originally designed to understand the diffu-\nsion of technological innovations, this theory became useful\nin helping to fathom the adoption of social innovations within\na social context. A social innovation can be defined as a new\nidea (product, service, or model) developed to fulfill social\nneeds and supported by the public sector, community groups,\nand volunteer organizations from any sector or field (Bacon,\nFaizullah, Mulgan, & Woodcraft, 2008). In some instances, it\nhas been employed in health education and exercise program\nevaluation (Westhoff & Hopman-Rock, 2002), sport manage-\nment (Newell & Swan, 1995), and sport equipment use\n(Schreier, Oberhauser, & Pr\u00fcgl, 2007) to explain and under-\nstand the process of innovation adoption in specific domains.\nThis theory provides an effective framework for studying\nLTAD as a social change, as it can be considered a social\ninnovation that affects the way sport is delivered. The indi-\nviduals responsible for adopting and implementing LTAD are\ncoaches, and social innovation is the LTAD model.\nThe diffusion of innovation process (Figure 1) depicts how\nindividuals move from their initial knowledge of an innovation\ntoward its adoption and implementation in their practice\n(Rogers, 2003). Prior to and during innovation adoption,\nBeaudoin et al. 3\nindividuals are persuaded to adopt its positive attributes when\nthey are interested and actively seek information or details\nabout it (Rogers, 2003). The five attributes that influence an\nindividual to adopt or reject an innovation are (a) the relative\nadvantage that it has over other innovations; (b) compatibility\nof the innovation with the individual's own values, past experi-\nences, or needs; (c) complexity of the innovation, meaning the\ndegree to which it is perceived as easy or difficult to under-\nstand; (d) trialability of the innovation, meaning the ability of\nindividuals to experiment with the innovation; and (e) observ-\nability of the innovation, meaning an individuals' ability to\nobserve the effects of the innovation.\nRegarding the implementation stage, Rogers (2003)\ndetermined that it occurs \"when an individual (or other deci-\nsion-making unit) puts an innovation to use\" (p. 179). Rogers\nexplained that implementation involves behavior change\nrelated to the innovation. During the implementation stage,\nthe innovation can be reinvented, meaning \"the degree to\nwhich an innovation is changed or modified by a user in the\nprocess of its adoption and implementation\" (Rogers, 2003,\np. 180). Rogers noted that a great deal of reinvention occurred\nfor many innovations, and sometimes only parts of it were\nadopted or implemented.\nMethod\nCase Study\nWe took a case study approach. As discussed by Yin (2003),\n\"the case study is used in many situations to contribute to our\nknowledge of individual, group, organizational, social, polit-\nical, and related phenomena\" (p. 1). Our case study is appro-\npriate because its purpose is to gain deeper understanding of\na complex phenomenon: how coaches adopt and implement\nSport Canada's LTAD model. We investigated this phenom-\nenon in its real-life context, as experienced by coaches. Each\ncoach provided valuable information individually and col-\nlectively, providing insight into the phenomenon studied.\nSampling and Recruiting of Participants\nThe University of Ottawa and Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-\nRivi\u00e8res ethics boards approved the project. An information\nletter was sent by email to 40 national and provincial sport\norganizations to invite their coaches to fill out a short online\nquestionnaire. The sport organizations either posted the letter\non their website or included it in their newsletter. The ques-\ntionnaire was designed to verify, on a Likert-type scale, how\nmuch coaches knew about LTAD, by asking, \"How much do\nyou know about Sport Canada's LTAD model?\"At the end of\nthe questionnaire, an open-ended question invited coaches to\ntake part in an individual interview and to give us their tele-\nphone number and email address if they agreed to participate\nfurther.\nStudy Participants\nTwo groups of coaches participated in the study: One group\nwas composed of coaches who decided to adopt LTAD (par-\nFigure 1.

The original model of Rogers is found in the light colored boxes while our observations are in the colored boxes. + = positive influence; - =\nnegative influence.\n4 SAGE Open\ntially or totally) and the other group was in the implementa-\ntion stage (i.e., fourth stage of the decision process).\nAdoption study. For studying adoption, 112 coaches from the\nprovince of Quebec (francophones and anglophones)\nresponded to the survey and, of them, 52 (46%) agreed to\nparticipate in personal interviews. We engaged a selection\nstrategy (purposeful sampling) to recruit participants who\ndecided to adopt LTAD with different levels of knowledge,\n(a) being very familiar with it, (b) had limited knowledge of\nit, or (c) knew very little about it. A total of 31 coaches were\ncontacted by email or telephone, and 14 (numbered from 1 to\n14) agreed to participate in an individual interview.\nImplementation study.Of the 86 English-speaking coaches\nfrom Canada who accepted to answer the questionnaire, 36\nvolunteered to participate in individual interviews (41.8%).\nPurposeful sampling (Creswell, 2013) was adopted as a strat-\negy for participant selection for the interview based on three\ncriteria in their questionnaire responses: (a) coaches were\nactively coaching, (b) those with certification from the\nNCCP, and (c) they were knowledgeable about the LTAD\nmodel. Twenty-four of the 36 coaches who volunteered for\nthe interview qualified by meeting the abovementioned crite-\nria. Ten coaches were randomly chosen and completed the\ninterview component on implementation (numbered from 15\nto 24). They were contacted by email or telephone, depend-\ning on the information they had given in the survey, and were\ninvited to participate in the interview process.\nInstruments\nThe qualitative part of the study took a narrative approach to\ndevelop an interview guide (Elliott, 2005). Conducted by\ntelephone, the interviews lasted between 45 to 75 min, and\nwere digitally recorded. The researchers developed an inter-\nview guide based on Rogers's theoretical framework, includ-\ning questions regarding whether and how the coaches had\neither adopted or implemented the LTAD model. The inter-\nview guide also included questions about their perceptions of\nthe barriers they had encountered. During the interview, par-\nticipants were encouraged to recount their experiences in\nlearning about and implementing the LTAD model. Elliott\n(2005) explained that narrative interviews helped partici-\npants to organize a \"sequence of events into a whole so that\neach event can be understood through its relation to that\nwhole\" (p. 3).\nAdoption study. The interview guide included three sections:\n(a) coach history, in which questions were asked, such as,\n\"Tell me about yourself as an athlete and as a coach,\" \"What\nis your background in sport?\" and \"How did you get started?\"\n(b) LTAD model characteristics, as presented in Rogers's\ntheoretical framework, in which questions included, \"What\nare the advantages or disadvantages of the LTAD model?\"\n\"How is the model compatible or incompatible with your\nvalues, past experiences as a coach, and the needs of your\nsport and athletes?\" and (c) perceived barriers or enablers\nduring LTAD adoption in which the question was, \"Did you\nexperience any barriers in adopting the LTAD model? If so,\nplease explain.\" Probing questions were asked to flesh out\ninitial answers.\nImplementation study. The interview guide for the implemen-\ntation study was similar to the one used by the adoption\nstudy. Sections 1 and 2 were the same as for the adoption\nstudy. Section 3 was oriented with questions on implementa-\ntion such as, \"Did you experience any barriers in implement-\ning the LTAD model? If so, please explain\"--to gain insights\ninto perceived barriers of LTAD adoption.\nData Analysis\nEach interview was transcribed verbatim and uploaded into\nthe QSR NVivo 9 Qualitative software program. As sug-\ngested by Yin (2003), interview content was analyzed. First,\na deductive approach (Patton, 2002), focusing broadly on\nRogers's theoretical framework, transformed the transcribed\ninterviews into \"meaning units\" with the following codes:\n(a) coaches' attributes, including subcodes for their athletic\nexperience, coaching certification, the sport(s) they coached\nin, their duties as coaches, the level of athletes they coached,\nand the years of experience they had as coaches; (b) Rogers's\ninnovation-decision process, including subcodes for the\nstages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, adoption, imple-\nmentation, and confirmation (Figure 1); and (c) barriers to\nadoption and implementation of the LTAD model. The coded\nstatements were reviewed independently by a second\nresearch team member. The researchers took an inductive\napproach to further examine the data coded under the imple-\nmentation stage for undiscovered patterns. Finally, meaning\nunits within the code \"Barriers to LTAD model adoption or\nimplementation\" were subcoded to examine barriers that\npertained directly to LTAD model implementation. These\nwere divided according to two main patterns in LTAD model\nadoption or implementation, as described above.\nAdoption study.Seven coded statements presenting differ-\nences were appraised, discussed, and reviewed indepen-\ndently by a second research team member. Agreement was\nreached by consensus, enabling validation of statement inter-\nstatements were analyzed, 27 for relative advantage, 39 for\ncompatibility, 25 for complexity, 20 for trialability, 13 for\nobservability, 27 for communication channels, and, finally,\n43 for barriers to adoption.\nImplementation study. Owing to the large number of coded\nmeaning units within Rogers's innovation-decision\nprocess (119) and particularly within the subcode for the\nBeaudoin et al. 5\nimplementation stage (43 meaning units), it became\napparent that the majority of coaches were in the process\nof implementing LTAD. To understand how coaches came\nto implement the model, meaning units within the persua-\nsion stage code (33) were further examined, and all the\ndata, in a second round of analysis, were further coded\naccording to Rogers's five attributes of innovation--relative\nadvantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and\nobservability--generating 113 additional meaning units.\nInductively, it became clear that there were two main pat-\nterns in LTAD model implementation: (a) coaches consid-\nered information on LTAD in specific stages according to the\nlevel of athletes they coached, and (b) they viewed the LTAD\nmodel as a global vision, philosophy, or planning tool for the\ndevelopment of athletes across stages.\nResults\nAdoption Study\nParticipants' characteristics. A total of 14 coaches (5 female, 9\nmale) from various regions of Quebec participated in the\nLTAD adoption study (Table 1). These coaches all partici-\npated as athletes in sport competitions at various levels in the\npast except for Coach 6. Most had experience as coaches in\ncompetitive environments, except for one who was involved\nonly at the community level (Coach 5). Thus, all these\ncoaches were engaged from development Stage 3 (Learning\nto Train) and subsequent stages. Coach 5 was involved at\nStages 1 (Active start) and 2 (FUNdamentals).\nAmong coaches who participated in the LTAD adoption\nstudy, eight were very familiar with the model, three consid-\nered themselves as being moderately knowledgeable, and\nthree others knew very little about LTAD. It should be noted\nthat coaches who knew very little about LTAD were mainly\ninvolved in sports with early development, such as gymnas-\ntics and figure skating, but were in the process of adopting it\n(Table 1). The third coach in this situation was Coach 5, who\nworked in baseball at the community level. All coaches had\nheard about the model through their provincial and/or\nnational federations.\nPerceptions of Innovation's Five Attributes\nThe majority of coaches had favorable perceptions of\nLTAD. As discussed by Rogers (2003), positive perception,\nin most cases, increased the likelihood of adoption of the\nproposed innovation (LTAD), while negative perception\nmore likely led coaches to reject it. The following section\npresents interview results on the five key predictors of\ninnovation adoption: relative advantage, compatibility,\ncomplexity, trialability, and observability.\nRelative advantage.The relative advantage is the degree to\nwhich an innovation is perceived as being better than the\nidea it supersedes. The relative benefits of LTAD perceived\nby coaches were many and varied (27 statements). However,\nthe positive central element that emerged from the percep-\ntions of all coaches (except the two coaches in gymnastics\nand figure skating) was a long-term vision of athletes, the\nneed to respect and follow their human development, and\nsupport the development of their full potential:\nIn fact, long-term development brings more athletes to their\nfull potential with a common provincial and national vision.\nTable 1.

We have a model to follow and if we respect it, we\nknow exactly what the goal is, what it is going to give us,\ntechnically, tactically, physically. (Coach 14)\nCompatibility. Compatibility, for its part, is how LTAD can be\nconsistent with the values, past experiences, and needs of\ncoaches. All coaches acknowledged that several components\nof LTAD were compatible with their values and practice (39\nstatements). At first, 12 of the 14 coaches recognized that\nLTAD presented components of training they already applied:\nWe used this concept since a long time. (Coach 1)\nThese elements have always been part of my practice. (Coach 9)\nAnother coach refers to xc-skiing, a late development\nsport for which the sport's governing body had already\nadopted the LTAD model at the time of the interview:\nGiven that we are a \"late development\" sport, we indirectly\nfollowed this model without necessarily knowing it. Thus, the\nmodel came as a confirmation for me. (Coach 11)\nIn a second step, all coaches (except for the two in gym-\nnastics and figure skating) saw that various LTAD compo-\nnents matched their values. They (a) practiced various\nsports and avoided early specialization, (b) developed basic\nskills and took pleasure in playing these sports, (c) respected\nthe rhythm of natural growth in children and young ath-\nletes, and (d) had a healthy lifestyle and exercised over a\nlifetime.\nFinally, some coaches stressed that LTAD was a new tool\nthat met the needs of coaches who had little experience.\nLTAD is a wonderful tool for new coaches coming in, those who\nare volunteers and do not have much training. Many told me:\n\"Wow! Finally, we have the tools we can apply.\" (Coach 11)\nComplexity. Rogers (2003) referred to the notion of complex-\nity by the degree of difficulty in understanding and deploy-\ning the proposed innovation (25 statements). If LTAD seems\nrelatively easy to understand at first, to use and integrate it in\ncoaching practice are perceived very differently, particularly\nin the early stages of development, as expressed by one\ncoach:\nYes, you can share in the vision, but they are significant changes\nnot obvious in practice. The biggest change is much more with\ncoaches involved with young athletes and yet it is those\n(coaches) who are the least equipped. (Coach 9)\nIn addition, some coaches emphasized that LTAD had not\naddressed their difficulty in planning their athletes' training\nand had not helped to ascertain the development stage of\nyoung athletes:\nPlanning: That's the challenge. Anyone can understand LTAD,\nbut they will say, \"How can I do that?\" It gets tricky when\nobserving movement and estimating maturity, to establish what\nkind of activity can be suitable and to work with young people\nin different developmental stages. (Coach 9)\nIt is these remarks that drive most coaches to discuss the\ngreat need for additional training to ascertain the develop-\nmental stages of their athletes, without which it may be very\ndifficult to integrate LTAD in practice.\nTrialability. Trialability is an important feature in the decision\nto adopt or reject innovation because, here, it is possible to\nsee if coaches are able to explore certain components of the\nproposed innovation (Rogers, 2003). Thus, if coaches could\nexperience some components of the model and get satisfac-\ntion from it, they will be more likely to adopt it. The majority\nof coaches (8/10) had already experienced some parts of\nLTAD, which brought various adjustments to their practice at\nthe time of the interview (20 statements). This was the case\nwith one female soccer coach:\nI think that as a coach I did not respect the stages. I realize that\nit is important to make adaptations according to age group.\nAlthough I personally like to make my training sessions\ncompetitive, I believe that with 6-7-year-old kids, it may not\nnecessarily be good to bring competition to training sessions.\nSo, after reviewing the model, I adapted my training sessions.\nHowever, the reality of certain sports in a competitive sys-\ntem can create multiple barriers. This is the case with triathlon\ncoaching but more specifically its swimming component:\nIn swimming, it is not possible because the short-term results are\nextremely important when hiring coaches, ensuring the\ncontinuity of their career and providing feedback from club\nadministrators or parents. The way this is actually done makes it\nvery difficult to apply LTAD because of the expectation of short-\nterm results. (Coach 7)\nObservability.As defined by Rogers (2003), observability is\nthe last feature to target if the results of innovation are visible\nto others in the community where it is released. In this\nrespect, although the majority of coaches believed that the\nbenefits of LTAD would be observed only in 10 or 15 years,\nthey still expressed strong conviction of a positive impact:\nI see that young people have the desire to continue playing\nsports. When I say \"playing sport,\" I am sure that some young\nathletes at any given time will say that they have discovered\nBeaudoin et al. 7\nanother sport. In the long run, it will help our young people who\nwant to pursue sports. (Coach 1)\nAnother coach spoke of benefits on the physical side that\nhe saw in some athletes:\nWhen you take the time to do things differently, there are always\nlong-term benefits in the end. For example, for agility in\nbasketball, I see great improvements in athletes who are less\ncoordinated, particularly due to growth spurts. (Coach 13)\nAnother outcome perceived by a xc-ski coach was perfor-\nmance upgrade in their discipline:\nI think that our sport has become better in the last five or six\nyears. It will perhaps take another 10 years to see the benefits of\nthis model. Their development is probably achieved by keeping\nthem longer in the sport. (Coach 11)\nAdoption Process by Coaches\nAnalyzing coaches' perceptions of LTAD characteristics as\nan innovation theory can help to identifying enablers and\nbarriers that influence coaches' decisions to adopt or imple-\nment LTAD (Rogers, 2003). Table 2 provides a synthesis of\ncoaches' decision process described in the previous section.\nFirst, knowledge of the model and the role of coaches'\ntraining are essential for a critical look at proposed innova-\ntions and their adoption (Table 2). Two coaches (in gymnas-\ntics and figure skating) knew very little about LTAD from the\nstart and were at the beginning of adoption (Table 3). Thus,\nknowing LTAD's benefits and compatibility could have per-\nsuaded them that it could be positive for them and their\nathletes.\nMany factors influenced the adoption process in coaches\n(Table 2). Coaches in track and field (Coaches 1 and 3) and\nxc-ski (Coaches 6 and 11) seem to have adopted LTAD for\nthe following reasons: (a) long-term vision for athletes\nalready present in their sport, (b) validation of what they\nwere doing right, and (c) the organizational structure of their\nsport. For the adoption process, being able to try some of\nLTAD's components and living positive experiences have\nenabled the majority of coaches (two in track and field, two\nin xc-skiing, three in soccer, two in baseball, and one in bas-\nketball) to perceive positive impacts of the LTAD model.\nAlthough they were in agreement with the principles and\nlong-term approach with LTAD, in practice, many barriers\nhindered its full adoption. Also, two triathlon coaches\n(Coaches 4 and 7) encountered several barriers linked to the\nculture and organizational structure of their sport, which led\nus to believe that LTAD adoption was very difficult for them.\nTable 2. Decision-Making Process for LTAD Adoption by Coaches.\nBarriers to adoption Decision process Factors favoring adoption\nLack of LTAD knowledge and education Knowledge Knowing is necessary\nImportance of continuing to discuss it Prior training is favorable\n Perception of low complexity and of being\neasily accessible\nSports culture and organizational structure\nof some sports\nPersuasion Respect and pleasure for youth\nCoaches and parents who want to win at\nall costs\nAdvantages and compatibility Long-term vision\nGoes against long-term vision Helps to take a fresh look\n Validation that what they do is appropriate\n Gives structural and planning assistance\n Common language and vision\nNeed for education of new coaches and\nparents\nDecision 12/14 already tried it and had a positive\nexperience\nNeed to better understand the general\nprinciples of LTAD, associated science\nand coaching\nTrialability and observability (expected) Saw a positive impact on youth and their\nparticipation in sport\n Saw a positive impact on the development\nof coaches and their sport\nLTAD integration in daily practice Implementation Logical and easy to understand if prior\neducation received\nNeed for additional education and tools Complexity \nRaises several questions \nEmphasis on results and competition works\nagainst LTAD\n\nNote. LTAD = long-term athlete development.\n8 SAGE Open\nFinally, LTAD's perceived complexity inhibited its imple-\nmentation in the daily practice of these coaches (Table 2).\nTherefore, barriers perceived by coaches may counterbal-\nance their decisions and hinder the possibility of full LTAD\nimplementation in their practice.\nImplementation Study\nTen coaches (2 female, 8 male) were interviewed to gain an\nunderstanding of their decision and process to adopt or reject\nthe LTAD model (Table 1). Four of the 10 coaches interviewed\nwere coaching in more than one sport. Finally, 8 coaches noted\nthat they knew the LTAD model either very well or quite well.\nTwo of them said they were somewhat knowledgeable.\nPersuasion.Coaches were persuaded (33 meaning units) to\nadopt the LTAD model according to attributes described in Rog-\ners's framework. All 10 coaches interviewed described how\nthey were persuaded to take up the LTAD model because of its\ncompatibility (37 meaning units) with their values, its relative\nadvantage (28 meaning units) over other models, its trialability\n(13 meaning units), and its observability (14 meaning units).\nCoaches involved in our study were persuaded to use the\nLTAD model because they all believed that it was compatible\nwith their personal values. The following quotes show how\ncoaches found the model to be compatible with their own\ncoaching values and approach. Coach 7 stated that \"The LTAD\nmakes a lot of intuitive sense when you understand the ratio-\nnale behind it,\" while Coach 17 pointed out that \"I became\naware of LTAD early in my soccer coaching career. It resonated\nwith me and made a lot of sense.\" For these reasons, coaches\nsaid they were easily persuaded to implement the model.\nThe following quotes indicate how coaches found the\nLTAD model to be relatively advantageous (28 meaning\nunits) compared with previous approaches in coaching:\nI think LTAD gives us some structure, especially at the lower\nlevels. The pathway is now clearer for everybody. (Coach 24)\nCoach 22 asserted how division of athletes' development\ninto defined stages helped them to speak a common language\nwith other stakeholders:\nThe best part for me starting out (with LTAD) was actually\ncategorizing athletes, not just by age, but by \"Learning to Train,\"\n\"Training to Compete,\" and that kind of thing . . . Once\neverybody speaks the same language, then it's easier to turn it\naround and make it work.\nThese advantages helped persuade coaches to implement\nthe model. Coaches also noted that the model influenced club\nTable 3.

LTAD = long-term athlete development.\naCoach 6 was involved in 2 sports: xc-skiing and triathlon.\nBeaudoin et al. 9\nstructure (14 meaning units). This, in turn, persuaded them to\nimplement LTAD because they could see the layout of the\nmodel and how it fit with the level they were coaching:\nThe ski club presented to parents' meetings in the fall and\naligned the programs with appropriate LTAD nomenclature . . .\n\"Training to Train,\" \"Learning to Train,\" etc. I think just\ndesignating groups by these names brings focus and has some\nimpact . . . getting some people to think about LTAD. (Coach 15)\nFinally, the coaches noted that they could try out the\nmodel (13 meaning units), which led to their LTAD adher-\nence. Some of the persuasion needed to adopt a new innova-\ntion includes its trialability. As one coach explained, the\ncoaches at his club were able to learn about LTAD, begin to\nunderstand, and then implement its principles.\nIt's not like the club changed everything it did overnight and set\nup a system that was completely LTAD-based. Slowly, as people\nhave come to know more about it, the way things have been\ndone has changed a bit in accordance with that. (Coach 21)\nOne coach simply stated that LTAD was already being\nimplemented by the other coaches in his club, and so when\nhe started coaching, it was a natural inclusion into his\napproach.\nLTAD was part of the training. I was first introduced to it through\nmy ski club three years ago. When I started coaching, it (LTAD)\nwas already in the club atmosphere. (Coach 18)\nAs the coaches were already persuaded to adopt the LTAD\nmodel, they started to implement it in various ways while\ncoaching their athletes.\nImplementation of the LTAD model by coaches.Two patterns\nappeared to dominate the coaches' ways of implementing\nLTAD (43 meaning units). First, all 10 coaches interviewed\nseemed to acquire information from specific stages (includ-\ning relevant principles) of the LTAD model, which, although\nallowing them to use the model in a way that aided their own\ncoaching approaches, also led to a host of barriers that they\nperceived with its implementation (40 meaning units). Sec-\nond, 7 of these 10 coaches understood the LTAD model as a\nglobal vision of how athletes should develop in sport and\nthey implemented it as a planning tool. With this approach,\nthere appeared to be fewer barriers to LTAD model imple-\nmentation (15 meaning units). However, such an approach\ncan only be taken when coaches have sufficient understand-\ning of the whole model.\nImplementation according to the development stages.All 10\ncoaches interviewed seemed more specifically interested in\nstages of development in the LTAD model that pertained to\nthe level of athletes they coached, and they were also inter-\nested in specific principles in these stages.\nOne coach discussed how he learned from the model, spe-\ncifically with athletes in the fundamental stage of develop-\nment (6- to 8-year-old females, 6- to 9-year-old males), to play\ngames with children and to develop their physical literacy, as\nthe LTAD model endorses within this stage of development:\nNow I use the idea that LTAD makes it fun for kids, and finding\nwhat is fun gains their interest, and helps them learn fundamental\nskills and game intelligence. (Coach 17)\nThis coach determined that athletes became more engaged\nonce he implemented his game approach according to the\nLTAD model in the FUNdamental stage (6-year-old and\nyounger).\nAnother coach, of boys in the \"Learn to Train\" stage (8- to\n11-year-old females, 9- to 12-year-old males) focused on\nLTAD's trainability factor to understand when and how to\ntrain his athletes' skills and physical abilities.\nWith our 10-year-old boys' soccer team last year, we didn't\nspend time specifically trying to develop their aerobic system\nbecause teaching them that is a waste of time. We spent time\nfocusing on the things that they were more receptive to learn and\nfocus on. You need to have a long-term mentality, and it's a\nlong-term program. Winning isn't and shouldn't be the focus in\nthe short-term. (Coach 21)\nA coach in the \"Train to Train\" stage explained how he\nused the factor of developmental age to determine when to\nbegin strength training with his athletes based on their growth\nand maturation.\nOur strength training begins at under 14 year old (U14), but it leans\nmoretowardsresistanceexercises,withweightedballs,coordination\nmovements and simple plyometric exercises. With females, we're\nable to incorporate resistance work earlier than with boys because\nof maturation, as the LTAD model explains. (Coach 16)\nOn the contrary, a gymnastics coach ascertained that the\nnumber of hours prescribed by the LTAD model as part of the\n10-year rule factor was difficult to follow for her more com-\npetitive young athletes. She chose when to implement this\nfactor and when not to do so.\nProvincial gymnastics coaches were all in a bit of a panic with\nLTAD because we're an early immersion sport. LTAD\nrecommend eight weekly hours for the nine-year-olds, but we do\n12 to 18 hours . . . So when parents ask if their child can train\nmore hours, if he or she is able to handle more, I say \"do it.\" But\nif they're unable to handle more training, I quote the LTAD and\nsay, \"According to this document, and all the work that's gone\ninto it, we support the fact that athletes should be involved in\nother things.\" (Coach 23)\nWhat is interesting is that this coach specifically picked\nup on one factor within the model and chose when to use it or\nnot.\nBarriers to Adoption and Implementation\nBarriers to adoption. Barriers to adoption are presented along\nthe decision process. In our study, four main barriers to adop-\ntion stood out with the majority of coaches: (a) lack of LTAD\nknowledge and training; (b) shortage of competent coaches,\nincluding parents; (c) inadequate sports culture and organi-\nzational structures; and (d) emphasis placed on results, that is\nto say, the performance of athletes or sports teams.\nThe majority of coaches underlined how lack of LTAD\nknowledge and training slowed adoption of the new model.\nA figure skating coach mentioned that not knowing enough\nabout the model hindered its exploitation:\nFor me, not knowing the model enough is a real barrier. I miss a lot\nof information, especially how to adapt it to my discipline . . . I\nthink if I had all this information, I would apply LTAD. (Coach 12)\nMore than half of coaches underlined that preparing\ncoaches was important as it could contribute to LTAD adop-\ntion and implementation.\nWe need to make coaching education mandatory for all coaches\nstarting in that role and everything should commence from the\nbeginning with the model. Do not forget that for children who\nstart at 7-8 years, the parents who coach them usually know\nnothing about the sport--as they do it out of kindness . . . .\nSome coaches feel that a paradox exists in the current\nsports culture. The model represents a long-term approach to\nmeet the growth and development of young athletes, whereas\norganizational sport structures encourage them to engage early\nin competition and often leads to their overspecialization.\nI gave a presentation on the long-term development of athletes\nat the soccer federation and they laughed at me. They said: \"We\ncannot do that!\" I replied that there should not be elite-class\ncompetitive soccer before the age of 12 years for girls and 14\nyears for boys . . . and they told me that it would never change!\nSome coaches underscored that the emphasis on results, in\nterms of performance of young athletes or teams, is a big bar-\nrier to LTAD adoption and implementation. So how is it possi-\nble to reconcile an approach based on the long-term\ndevelopment of young athletes with the attraction of short-term\nresults? This is how a triathlon coach explained the situation:\nLook at the structure of swimming here. Even if coaches are\nfairly high level and are aware of the need for youth development,\nthe major issue is that recognition comes with performance, it\nbecomes a vicious circle. What counts are our short-term results.\nSuch situations inevitably lead coaches to run aground in\ninsufficient financial resources, and they are dependent on\nthe performance of their athletes. As explained by the same\ntriathlon coach,\nPeople always focus on financial issues, searching for sponsors.\nThis is only short-term and far removed from concerns about the\nquality of interventions in our youth and their long-term\ndevelopment . . . . (Coach 4)\nIn addition, as pointed out by this coach, such a sport cul-\nture often pushes coaches and athletes to look for shortcuts,\nrecipes, or interventions to attain high-level but short-term\nperformance:\nBasically, when we coach, it is normal to want to win a season,\nand it is very easy to focus on that rather than think about youth\ndevelopment. So we sometimes skip the teaching of certain\nskills to focus more on specific things that will help to win.\nBarriers to implementation.Coaches noted that there were\nspecific barriers as a result of implementing LTAD. The bar-\nriers included lack of information on some stages of develop-\nment in the LTAD model (11 meaning units), a lack of\nunderstanding of the other stages of development within the\nmodel (14 meaning units), and, perhaps most notably,\ncoaches had trouble assessing the developmental stage of\ntheir athletes and following recommendations within the\nLTAD model (15 meaning units).\nOne coach noted that there were no technical and tactical\ndrills that gave coaches the tools to implement the LTAD mod-\nel's recommendations. Acknowledging that LTAD is a model\nthat addresses the many stages of athlete development, two\ncoaches noted that they only really understood the LTAD\nmodel within the age category that they coached. Therefore, a\nbarrier for them in implementing the LTAD model was that\nthey did not understand the model fully. Coach 24 said,\nI've gone over it (LTAD). I'm not going to say I fully understand\nit. The youngest I've ever taught is 16- and 17-year-old athletes.\nI've never taught anybody under that. So for me to use the LTAD\nwith younger stages would be a barrier to me.\nAnother coach explained that the determination of devel-\nopmental age, measuring the growth and development of\nindividual athletes to develop skills at proper times, is hard to\nimplement in team sports where chronological age serves to\nplace athletes on teams.\nSometimes stages are hard to differentiate--you tend to treat all\n12-year-olds the same. I'm not sure how you don't when it's a\nteam sport . . . you've got all kinds of 12-year-olds, some who\nare small and others who look like men--especially around\nIndeed, six coaches found it hard to implement LTAD\nmodel directions explicitly for certain stages of develop-\nment. As Coach 15 explained,\nThe whole concept around puberty in terms of athletes'\ndevelopment and monitoring their growth, to look for peak\nheight velocity and all those fancy terms . . . I don't see 97% of\ncoaches out there involved in measuring their athletes' height\ndifferences on a monthly basis. I'm not sure many coaches out\nthere have the time or motivation to do so.\nThe same coach determined that the LTAD model could\nbe perceived as a barrier to athlete development if coaches\nfixated on specific recommendations. Instead, he suggested\nthat LTAD was best considered as a guideline:\nSome people accept precise details of LTAD as gospel . . . if\nJohnny didn't complete 359 hours of aerobic conditioning by\nthe age of 13 years and 3 months, he's out of luck, and he's never\ngoing to make it as a skier. (Coach 15)\nImplementation as a Global Vision for Athlete\nDevelopment Over Time\nSeven coaches considered the LTAD model to be a guide or\na plan with a global vision for athlete development. These\nseven coaches noted that LTAD was a vision for coaching\nindividuals across their life span. This was useful as it pro-\nvided a framework for the coaches' lesson plans:\nI used it (LTAD) as baseline, kind of like a course curriculum. I\ndeveloped an outline and then wrote down my objectives.\nHere's the rough outline . . . there's a certain skill set or physical\nability that this age group player should have. (Coach 19)\nCoaches also cited the LTAD model when explaining\ntheir plan to athletes and parents. It enabled them to have a\ntool with which to explain their coaching approach.\nWhat I like to explain to the parents and athletes are the keys\nstages. Following the LTAD, I'm developing all core skills for\nmovement and sport in younger children. At 12 to 14 years, we\ncan introduce competition or preparation for events. (Coach 18)\nMore specifically, one coach talked about how explaining\nthe LTAD model to parents helped them relax in regard to\ntheir child's sport development.\nI spend time speaking to parents about goals, expectations, and\nprocesses (according to LTAD), and I find them much more\nrelaxed when they understand that kids develop at different rates\nBarriers to implementation as a global vision.Seven coaches\ndiscussed barriers that prevented them from fully imple-\nmenting LTAD (15 meaning units). These included lack of\nsupport and evidence-based research of the LTAD model, its\ncomplexity, and the difficulty in ensuring that all individuals\nworking with athletes (coaches, parents, and support staff)\nadhered to LTAD recommendations.\nIn general, coaches felt that there was no support to help\nthem learn about the LTAD model. Some coaches noted that\nthe coach education courses where they learned the LTAD\nmodel were too time-consuming and that they could not take\nthe many courses required to fully understand the model.\nOthers who had received their certification from the old\nNCCP system (Levels 1-5) noted that they were not required\nto recertify and so they never had the opportunity to learn the\nLTAD model. Still others noted that even after learning about\nthe LTAD model, they were unsure whether it would really\nimprove athlete development over the course of their entire\nathletic careers. As one coach said,\nIf you take a group of nine-year-olds and you do lots of speed\ntraining with them, and you take another group of nine-year-olds\nand you don't do any speed training, then when they are 19 years\nold, is one group significantly better off than the other group as\na result of what they did? I don't believe that sort of research has\nbeen done so . . . are we really sure that the LTAD is right?\nTo this coach, the lack of evidence-based research regard-\ning the model was a barrier because it led him to question\nwhether or not to implement it.\nProbably the greatest barrier to implementing LTAD as a\nglobal vision for developing athletes is its sheer complexity.\nOne coach called the LTAD model \"a bit daunting\" (Coach\n21). This coach noted that understanding how athletes\ndevelop over the course of their childhood and adolescence\nis a huge undertaking.\nIf you gave me a piece of paper and asked me to draw the graph,\nto getall windows (of trainability) in the right places, I couldn't\ndo it. I read those documents a bunch of times but I would still\nfail the exam, so to speak. (Coach 21)\nIndeed, not only is complexity a barrier for coaches, but\ncoaches must also properly describe the model to parents to\nget them on board. The coaches noted that parents play an\nimportant role in ensuring that coaches implement the LTAD\nmodel and that athletes are following their advice:\nThe LTAD is a bit of an overhaul of information because your\nathletes don't necessarily get the information directly. You\nwould have to go through the parents. (Coach 20)\nCoaches felt that it was difficult to properly implement\nthe LTAD model without educating parents about the de-\nemphasis on winning and competition at younger ages. An\nice hockey coach explained,\nEach year is an education process for parents, learning training\nto game ratios, rest and taking a long-term approach. I find that\nit's always a challenge. (Coach 17)\nA barrier to implementing the LTAD model as a global\nvision was getting everybody committed to the LTAD model.\nIn other words, if everyone working with athletes throughout\ntheir development was not on board with the model, then\nathletes would not have the continuity needed to ensure suc-\ncess. One coach suggested that head coaches organize their\ncoaching staff to understand and implement the LTAD model\nto ensure athletic success:\nIf you leave LTAD implementation up to individuals, you're\ngoing to get a fair bit of variability and that doesn't lend itself\nwell to the kids who might move from coach to coach and not\nget consistency. (Coach 21)\nTaking a long-term global view of the LTAD model, coaches,\nparents, support staff, and athletes have to be aware of and\nunderstand it--to have the same vision for implementation.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this article was to explore how Canadian\ncoaches adopted or implemented Sport Canada's LTAD\nmodel and to understand the barriers they perceived in adopt-\ning and implementing it. Rogers's (2003) theoretical frame-\nwork served to understand the decision-making process of\ncoaches and to analyze their perception of the model's char-\nacteristics influencing their decision to adopt or reject this\nsocial innovation or the process of implementation once it\nwas adopted.\nThe Five Attributes of Innovation and LTAD\nAdoption and Implementation\nThe five attributes of an innovation, as stated in Rogers's\n(2003) theoretical model (relative advantage, compatibility,\ncomplexity, trialability, and observability), provide a concep-\ntual framework for understanding what may have limited or\nhelped LTAD adoption and implementation by coaches.\nKnowledge of the model. Knowledge is the first determinant\nof innovation adoption. More than half of participants in the\nadoption part of the study reported very good knowledge of\nLTAD, and all coaches had already acquired some LTAD\nfacts before it was introduced by Sport Canada. Communica-\ntion channels for information on LTAD are available to\ncoaches through sports (national or provincial) federations.\nInformation is transmitted in several ways, but in most cases\nduring coaching seminars. This could be due to the fact that\ncoaches who responded to the invitation to participate in the\nstudy were experienced, and most of them had a relatively\nhigh level of training before LTAD's arrival. Therefore, they\ndid not attend recent coaching seminars for new certification\n(Table 3). However, coaches with lower level LTAD knowl-\nedge also had lower level coaching certification. Indeed, the\nthree coaches who reported having little knowledge of LTAD\nwere at Levels 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1), and their experience as\ncoaches was, respectively, 6, 11, and 12 years. However,\nthey recognized that the model's merits resided in the devel-\nopment of knowledge cohesiveness as a whole. Many\ncoaches observed that sport in Canada was still driven by\nmany parent volunteers who had little or no knowledge of\ntheir sport. It is one of the tenets of LTAD that better coaches\nof younger athletes would help to develop all the basic skills\nproposed in LTAD (Balyi, Way, & Higgs, 2013). Therefore,\nit is a challenge to better prepare coaches, even those involved\nwith younger athletes.\nCoaches at the level of implementing LTAD and who per-\nceived that they had better knowledge of the LTAD model\nexploited it not only for information pertaining to their ath-\nletes'stages of development but also as an overarching vision\nof athlete development, so that they deemed the model to be\na guide for athlete development in general.\nCoaches in early development sports may be less familiar\nwith LTAD, as two of them, who knew very little about the\nmodel, were from this type of sport (gymnastics and figure\nskating). However, it remains to be confirmed in a larger\nstudy sample with objective measures of LTAD knowledge\nas the present study measured the perception of knowledge\nof LTAD. Gymnastics Canada and Skate Canada produced\nrespectively. Our gymnastics coach (Coach 2), who lived in\na remote area, testified about the challenges of having access\nto continued education in coaching. However, such was not\nthe case with our figure skating coach (Coach 12). The\nmodel, in its original form (Balyi & Way, 1995), was much\nless compatible with the type of performance progression\nobserved in early development sports, whereas in our days,\nthe revised version of LTAD and the new structure of the\nNCCP, adding the community sport coach approach, offer\nmore opportunities to integrate LTAD in most sports organi-\nzations. This subject warrants further investigation.\nRelative advantages of LTAD. LTAD was the first athlete devel-\nopment model officially adopted in Canadian sport as part of\na policy. Thus, LTAD itself does not replace an existing\nmodel. This may partially explain the positive perception of\nLTAD by coaches. The relative advantages perceived by\ncoaches can be divided into two categories, those favoring\nathlete development and those associated with coaches'\nduties. The majority of coaches emphasized the importance\nof designing training plans respecting the developmental\nstages of athletes as persons and not just performers. The\nbenefits related to athletic performance have not been\nemphasized probably because there is currently no evidence\nshowing that this model is more effective than others in pro-\nducing better athletes and more of them. Coaches at the level\nof implementation also perceived relative advantages from\nLTAD. The main advantage was the \"creation of a common\nlanguage with other stakeholders,\" particularly parents. For\ncoaches, it is a tool to help their interaction with parents.\nTrialability and observability were also identified as positive\nfeatures of LTAD but were much less often mentioned than\ncompatibility and relative advantages (Table 2). Indeed, it is\nevident that to really study impacts of LTAD, a cohort of\nathletes would need to be longitudinally followed during\ntheir careers as only parts of the LTAD model are evidence\nbased.\nDepending on their duties, many coaches mentioned help-\nfulness of the model in guiding new coaches and facilitating\ncommunication with parents. This is consistent with the find-\nings of Black and Holt (2009)--that the relative advantage of\n\"speaking the same language\" (vision and common tongue)\nhas helped alpine ski coaches in Alberta, Canada. However,\ntheir work also indicated that a common language facilitated\nby LTAD was not associated with a total \"buy in\" of the\nCompatibility. At first glance, we see that LTAD is compatible\nwith the values of the coaches interviewed. Others suggest\nthat the model validated their own approach and that of some\nparents.Again, this point was cited by Black and Holt (2009).\nMany themes emerged that indicated positive influences on\nLTAD implementation (Figure 1). Coaches considered that\nLTAD was compatible with their values, which may not be\nsurprising. As mentioned by Collins and Bailey (2013), is it\nbecause LTAD incorporates \". . . much face-valid and simple\nadvice, guidance that is so fundamental and sound that it is\nalmost irrefutable . . . ?\" (p. 186) Or is it attributable to previ-\nous knowledge of some LTAD components (e.g., avoidance\nof early specialization and prevention of dropping-out) that\nwere already presented in curricula of university physical\neducation or kinesiology programs or other forums? How-\never, a problem has been raised about LTAD compatibility\nwith the organizational structure of sport that generally grati-\nfies short-term success, rejecting athletes and coaches who\ndo not achieve this kind of goal. It is a major digression in\nLTAD implementation that will have to be addressed to cre-\nate compatibility between LTAD, the actors in the system,\nand the sport system itself. Moreover, several examples show\nthat short-term success, defined mainly by wins and endorsed\nby the sport system, hamper the development of athletes and\nultimately the ability to retain young people who would oth-\nerwise have reached their full potential later. One example is\nthe phenomenon of \"relative age effect\" in which younger\nindividuals in a category are less likely to progress to higher\nor competitive categories and are possibly more inclined to\nleave the sport (Musch & Grondin, 2001). Another example\nis the overspecialization of athletes, which is considered det-\nrimental to the development of a repertoire of general motor\nskills (Fransen etal., 2012). In today's sports culture, the\nemphasis on results brings a whole lot of profit, instant satis-\nfaction for athletes and their parents, coach recognition,\nincreased coaching salaries, sponsors, government grants,\nand so forth. The effect of these factors may be obvious at\nhigher levels of competition. However, even in younger\ncategories, they may exert negative influences and heighten\nthe risk of early specialization and its consequences (Malina,\nComplexity.While understanding LTAD principles, coaches\nemphasized difficulties in taking action, especially when it\ncame to (a) determining athletes' stages of development and\n(b) planning short- and long-term training according to\nstages. At the stage of implementation, two patterns emerged\nin LTAD implementation. First, some coaches took informa-\ntion from the model that pertained directly to the stage of\ndevelopment in which their athletes fit. These coaches found\nthat barriers existed in implementing the LTAD model,\nincluding a dearth of information on particular stage, a lack\nof understanding stages different from their own athletes,\nand trouble identifying the developmental stage of their ath-\nletes, to follow LTAD model recommendations. Other criti-\ncisms particularly matched with this study included a lack of\nguidelines for LTAD implementation. Some coaches wanted\nspecific technical and tactical drills or exercises that would\nhelp with implementation in their sport, while others found\nthat the lack of specific guidelines allowed coaches to con-\nsider the model more as a guide without adhering too strictly\nto its recommendations. This reinforces the need for coach-\ning education, citing concrete examples of these two identi-\nfied difficulties to be overcome once LTAD principles are\nwell understood. Continuing education on more practical\naspects of training is warranted.\nTrialability. For some coaches, it was clear that an approach,\nsuch as LTAD, with long-term outputs, makes its full imple-\nmentation illusory at the moment. However, the majority of\ncoaches interviewed were able to engage some LTAD prin-\nciples. Although they experienced certain beneficial effects,\nthey indicated that it was often difficult to explain their rele-\nvance to others. Gratification of short-term success, as\nexpressed by a swimming coach, was a limiting factor of\ntrialability. There is a perceived risk to try LTAD with ath-\nletes. By following the LTAD approach, not aiming at short-\nterm success, and not knowing if success will come later,\ncoaches as well as parents may fear that their athletes may\nnever be successful. Therefore, each sport may suggest inter-\nmediate goals (competencies, skills, etc.) to coaches and ath-\nletes that may help them to follow progression based on\ndevelopmental stages and not uniquely on results (medals,\nranks, etc.).\nObservability. Some coaches have already begun to perceive\nthe positive effects of LTAD, including persistence not only\nin sport and physical activity among young people but also in\nthe acquisition of motor skills. In the latter case, it is difficult\nto see what effect this will have on performance. However, a\nxc-ski coach has already begun to witness a new generation\nof athletes. It is noteworthy that Cross-Country Canada was\none of the first sport federations to adopt LTAD.\nThe Role of Social Systems\nSocial innovations like LTAD are not only dependent on the\nattributes of the innovation. The surrounding social system\nwith its values also influences that capacity of individuals\nto adopt and implement the social innovation. All inter-\nviewed coaches expressed their views on the sporting cul-\nture in Canada and how its organizational structure limited\nLTAD adoption and implementation, as proposed by Sport\nCanada. Triathlon coaches involved in swimming and those\nin soccer and baseball specifically mentioned how the com-\npetitive system in place worked against LTAD. Thus, the\nmain barrier may be the persistence of a system that empha-\nsizes results in competitions at stages where some other\naspects of athletic development would be preferred. In\naddition, the outcomes of these competitions are short term,\nproviding financial and other rewards or support for ath-\nletes, which go directly against the principles of LTAD and\ndiscourage its implementation in daily practice for these\ncoaches. When coaches have to choose between training\norientation (e.g., specialization) that will provide immedi-\nate results and another approach that may take time to pro-\nduce results, sport system demands will pull coaching\ntoward short-term goals. However, the majority of coaches\nsurveyed adhere to LTAD principles but are in a paradoxi-\ncal situation where they cannot afford to reduce short-term\nperformance because they are immediately accountable. In\nfact, as suggested by C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Gilbert (2009), the notion of\ncoaching success is questioned by LTAD. There is a need to\nbetter define what is successful-effective coaching, depend-\ning on athlete levels.\nCoaching education also seems to be a factor identified\nby coaches as having an influence on whether or not LTAD\nwill be adopted. Indeed, five coaches, perceiving their\nknowledge of LTAD as being less than optimal, had NCCP\nLevel 1 or 2 certification. However, this observation should\nbe confirmed in a larger sample. In coaching education on\nLTAD, it is clear that different communication channels are\ntargeted: (a) NCCP training when coaches want to reach\nhigher levels; (b) attending meetings, workshops, and semi-\nnars; (c) sending documentation; or (d) visiting websites\n(Table 3). These testimonials suggest that coaching educa-\ntion programs should not rely on a single communication\nchannel. Finally, the clear need for coaching education is to\ntarget LTAD observability by coaches by giving concrete\nexamples of implementation experienced by them during\nNCCP training seminars.\nIn terms of practical recommendations, sports funding\nshould be consistent with the sport development model cho-\nsen in a given country. Specifically, in Canada, prioritizing\nlong-term and integrated athletic development and not\nmerely focusing on short-term results should be targeted to\nfollow the plan proposed by LTAD. Each sport federation\ncould develop a set of process goals that could help coaches\nfollow the progress of their athletes.\nBarriers faced by coaches may be addressed through rein-\nvention. Many of the barriers faced by coaches created\nobstacles to overcome LTAD implementation but did not\nbring about its discontinuance. Therefore, an alternative\nimplementation occurred where coaches implemented only\nselected stages of the model (i.e., reinvention). In parallel,\nthey engaged in ongoing learning to develop better under-\nstanding of the model and to teach it to others (parents, ath-\nletes, assistant coaches).\nRogers (2003) noted that reinvention is a strong indicator\nof actual change.All 10 coaches interviewed declared having\nimplemented LTAD with adaptations, according to the exam-\nples that they provided in interviews. For the coaches in this\nstudy, reinvention of the model within a specific stage of\ndevelopment gave coaches the opportunity to implement it\ndespite insufficient information, support, or understanding,\nall while keeping the model less complex in their minds. In\nsome coaches similarly used the model for certain stages or\nfactors only. However, Rogers noted that, in many cases,\nreinvention could be judged as good or bad. Indeed, partial\nimplementation, or not viewing the model as a global vision\nof athlete development, could limit coaches from ensuring\nthat all sports persons were working toward a common goal\nfor their athletes and safeguarding consistency for athletes'\ndevelopment no matter what stage they were in.\nRogers (2003) explained that \". . . some reasons for re-\ninvention lie in the innovation itself, while others involve the\nindividual or organisation adopting the new idea\" (p. 186).\nBanack etal. (2012) discussed how the sport context (i.e.,\nrecreational) could have an impact on the way coaches per-\nceive and adopt the LTAD model in their coaching practices.\nFrankish etal. (2012) also determined that coaches in clubs\nwith different goals and structures perceived the model in\ndifferent ways. For example, coaches from competitive clubs\nadopted the model more easily than coaches from clubs with\na recreational \"Learn to Ski\" environment. In addition,\nFrankish etal. suggested that a coach's role within the club\ncould lead to a different path of adoption. Therefore, build-\ning from their research, it was found that coaches perceived\nthe model and employed it in two main ways: (a) coaches'\nperception and knowledge of the model, with barriers to\nimplementation coming from LTAD itself; and (b) the orga-\nnization's inability to properly support the model.\nBlack and Holt (2009) found inconsistencies in the way\nthat the LTAD model was implemented in one sport-specific\nsituation and highlighted the difficulty in evaluating LTAD\nimplementation. In fact, reinvention of the LTAD model to\nthe specific needs of different sports is described in both\nFrankish's etal. (2012) study on the late-specializing sport\nof xc-ski and Lang and Light's (2010) study on the early-\nspecializing sport of swimming.\nWhile acknowledging that the LTAD model could provide\na common vocabulary for coaches and emphasize the impor-\ntance of teaching fundamental skills, Martindale, Collins,\nand Daubney (2005) raised concerns regarding its scientific\nmerit in a study of the LTAD implementation in the United\nKingdom. Similarly, a few coaches in our study expressed\nthese concerns as potential barriers that created doubts about\nthe model's rigor. It may explain why some coaches rein-\nvented LTAD according to their beliefs, prior knowledge,\nand barriers. In fact, reinvention may also be seen crudely as\ncherry-picking of concepts from LTAD that they already\nknow. Indeed, of the few references on LTAD, the majority\nunderlined that many key LTAD concepts (e.g., perils of\nearly sport specialization) were already known to some prac-\nconcepts, like \"critical developmental phases,\" remain non-\nStudy Limitations\nInterview duration enabled researchers to gain deeper under-\nstanding of coaches' use of the LTAD model (a total of 287\nmeaning units analyzed). The views in this article were those of\nindividual coaches. Rather, the focus was on exploring how\ncoaches adopted and implemented the model that was presented\nto them by Sport Canada. Our study did not address the different\nsport contexts of coaches (community, competition, and instruc-\ntion) that could influence LTAD model adoption and implemen-\ntation. The observations of coaches in their work environment\ncould have further strengthened the interview data.\nFuture Research Paths\nFurther research is warranted to develop a global understand-\ning of how the model is adopted, implemented, and con-\nfirmed or abandoned over time. The results of our study and\nthose of others have shown how different sports, sport orga-\nnizational structure, training of coaches, and the role of par-\nents are key factors influencing LTAD model adoption and\nimplementation. Of course, adoption and implementation\nprocesses need to be assessed in other countries where LTAD\nis in place. Cultural differences in coaches dealing with\nLTAD or other models of performance/participation may\nexist and will have to be addressed (Collins etal., 2012).\nConclusion\nAccording to Canadian Sport Policy, the LTAD model is\nactually the \"paradigm\" of Canadian sport (Canadian\nhave adopted a LTAD framework (Canadian Sport for Life,\n2011). Our research identified factors that influence coaches'\nadoption and implementation of LTAD or some of its compo-\nnents. LTAD, compatible with most coaches' values respect-\ning human development stages, is potentially helpful for\nadoption and implementation. The creation of a common\nlanguage with other stakeholders is also a point that favors\nLTAD adoption and implementation.\nBarriers hindering LTAD implementation included (a)\nlack of organizational support regarding implementation of\nthe model, (b) shortage of evidence-based research on the\nmodel, and (c) complexity of the model when viewed in its\nentirety, and the difficulty in getting all sports persons\ninvolved in implementing the LTAD model's recommenda-\ntions (Figure 1). A sport system gratifying short-term success\nis not compatible with the long-term approach of LTAD.\nAlso, the compatibility of LTAD with sports demanding\nearly performance development, such as gymnastics, is a\nchallenge to stakeholders involved in these sports.\nThose who implemented LTAD did not necessarily do it\nintegrally. Many coaches undertook reinvention, or imple-\nmented only selected aspects of the model, and consider\nLTAD as a set of guidelines without adhering too strictly to\nthem. This may be ascribed to the fact that parts of LTAD are\nevidence based, but the whole approach must be empirically\nverified by longitudinal studies.\nThe model's perceived complexity also stands as an\nobstacle for some coaches, particularly with regard to com-\nprehension of the transition between development stages,\nmethods to estimate athletes' stages, and identification of\n\"windows of opportunity\" or critical periods. Therefore, pro-\nfessional development regarding LTAD in its entirety (not\njust for those stages in which the coaches work), with empha-\nsis on philosophical underpinnings of the model and includ-\ning practical ways that coaches can teach others (parents,\nother coaches, athletes), must be offered to coaches.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\nsupported by the Sport Canada Research Initiative and the Social\nSciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\nReferences\nBacon, N., Faizullah, N., Mulgan, G., & Woodcraft, S.
