ILT4-positivity on CD40L-stimulated\nmonocytes was negatively correlated with disease activity in patients. Adalimumab treatment\nresulted in significant increases from baseline in ILT4-positivity, and in decreases in CD40, CD80\nand CD86-positivity in monocytes from patients.\nConclusion: The effect of adalimumab on monocyte surface phenotype may be due to\nmodification of the inflammatory milieu associated with therapy-induced reduction of disease\nactivity in psoriatic arthritis.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Rheumatology, Allergology and Clinical Immunology,\nDepartment of Systemic Medicine, University of Rome\n``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy\n2Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine\nUniversity of Rome ``La Sapienza'' Rome, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nMaria Sole Chimenti, Rheumatology, Allergology and\nClinical Immunology, Department of Medicina dei Sistemi,\nUniversity of Rome ``Tor Vergata'', viale Oxford 81, Rome\nEmail: maria.sole.chimenti@uniroma2.it\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

High levels of inhibitory ILT recep-\ntors are found on the surface of all APCs,\nalong with inhibition of nuclear factor-kB\nactivation and CD40-induced upregulation of\ncostimulatory proteins, with a consequent\neffect on T-cells.2 Although inhibitory ILTs\nappear to be upregulated in patients with\nrheumatoid arthritis, little is known about\ntheir expression in psoriatic arthritis.3\nThe aim of the present study was to\ninvestigate the presence of ILT4 and costi-\nCD86), as well as tumour necrosis factor\n(TNF)-a production, in peripheral blood\nmonocyte-derived APCs from patients\nwith psoriatic arthritis, before and after\ntreatment with the anti-TNF-a therapy,\nadalimumab.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited adult patients (>18-\nyears-old) with moderate-to-severe psori-\natic arthritis (diagnosed according to\nCASPAR criteria4) who were attending the\nRheumatology Unit, University of Rome\n``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy, between April\nrequired to be nai\u00a8ve to biological therapies\nand be eligible for adalimumab treatment.\nAll patients received 40 mg adalimumab via\nsubcutaneous injection every other week.\nBlood samples were taken and disease activ-\nity was assessed by measuring the disease\nactivity score (DAS)5 immediately before\nthe first adalimumab dose and at week 12. A\ngroup of matched healthy control subjects\nwere recruited from blood donors attending\nthe Universitary Hospital ``Policlinico Tor\nVergata'', Rome, Italy.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nethics committee of the University of Rome\n``Tor Vergata''. All patients and healthy\nsubjects provided written informed consent\nprior to enrolment.\nMaterials\nSoluble trimeric CD40L was purchased from\nR&D system, San Diego, CA, USA.\nLipoplysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia\nChemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA. All\ncompounds and media used in this study\nwere analysed for endotoxin contamination\nusing the limulus amebocyte lysate test (QCL-\n1000, BioWhittaker, Inc, Walkersville, MD,\nUSA). All samples were free of endotoxin\ncontamination (<0.1EU/ml).\nCell culture\nPeripheral blood (from controls or patients)\nwas enriched for peripheral blood mono-\nnuclear cells (PBMC) by centrifugation at\nHypaque (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences,\nUppsala, Sweden). PBMC were either\nimmediately analysed via fluorescence-\nactivated cell sorting (FACS; see below) or\nmented with 20% heat inactivated fetal\ncalf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine,\n50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin\nCells were plated in 96-well V-bottom plates\nat a concentration of 5 \u00c2 105 cells/well in\n250 ml of complete medium and incubated\nfor 72 h at 37C in a humidified atmosphere\nof 5% carbon dioxide in air, in the presence\nor absence of 0.5 mg/ml CD40L, then ana-\nlysed by FACS.\nTo evaluate the ability of sera from\npatients with psoriatic arthritis to modulate\nILT4 positivity, buffy coat monocytes were\nobtained from healthy subjects by elutri-\nation. Elutriated monocytes were plated at\nwithout FCS, and cultured for 72 h with the\naddition of 20% serum from each patient\n(obtained at baseline just before the first\nadministration of adalimumab) or control,\nor 20% FCS (negative control). Cells were\nthen analysed by FACS. To evaluate intra-\ncellular cytokine production the cells were\nwashed in PBS (pH 7.4) at the end of the\nincubation period, then incubated with fresh\ncomplete medium containing 1 mg/ml of the\nprotein transport inhibitor brefeldin A, with\nFACS\nCells were washed once with washing buffer\n(3% FCS and 0.1% sodium azide in phos-\nphate buffered saline [PBS, pH 7.4]), then\nin the dark with: R-phycoerythrin-cyanine\n(PC5)-conjugated anti-CD14 (Immunotech,\nMarseille, France), phycoerythrin (PE)-\nconjugated anti-ILT4 (Immunotech; clone:\nand anti-CD86 (BD Biosciences, San Jose\n`\nCA, USA) (all diluted 1:10). For the deter-\nmination of intracellular cytokine produc-\ntion, cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4,\nthen stained with anti-CD14 and anti-ILT4\nas described above. Cells were then permea-\nbilized in Cytofix/CytopermTM solution\n(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA),\nstained with anti-TNF-a (R&D systems,\nSan Diego, CA, USA; diluted 1:10) for\n30 min at room temperature, then analysed\nby FACS. The negative range and staining\nspecificity for each cell-surface marker and\ncytokine was established using a corres-\nponding isotype-matched control antibody,\nconjugated with the same fluorescent dye.\nFlow cytometry was performed using\na FACScanTM flow cytometer and analysed\nwith CellQuestTM software (Beckton\nDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). For\nexpression and a light-scatter gate designed to\neither include only viable cells (surface markers\ndetermination) or exclude cellular debris (deter-\nmination of intracellular cytokine production).\nStatistical analyses\nThe Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov goodness-of-fit\ntest was used to assess normality of distri-\nbution. Comparisons between distributions\nof two variables for a single group were\nperformed by Student's unpaired t-test or\nMann\u00adWhitney U-test. Correlations were\nevaluated using Pearson's parametric test\nfor univariate analysis. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 version 10.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5, and P values <0.05 were con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 20 patients with psoriatic\narthritis (six male/14 female; mean age\nrange 28\u00ad59 years). Demographic and clin-\nical characteristics of the study population\nare given in Table 1.\nThere was no significant difference\nbetween patients and controls in the number\nof ILT4\u00fe monocytes in freshly isolated\n24 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)\nPBMCs. CD40L-stimulation resulted in sig-\nnificantly more ILT4\u00fe monocytes in cultures\nfrom control subjects than those from\nno significant increase in ILT4\u00fe monocyte\nnumbers following CD40L-stimulation of\nPBMCs from patients.\nDisease activity score was negatively\ncorrelated with ILT4\u00fe monocyte numbers\nin CD40L-stimulated cultures from patients\nWhen CD40L-stimulated cells were\nsorted for ILT4, significantly more ILT4\u00c0\nthan ILT4\u00fe monocytes were positive for\ncomparison; Figure 1c). In addition, there\nCD86-positive cells in ILT4\u00c0 monocytes\nFigure 1c).\nWhen spontaneous TNF-a production\nwas analysed at single-cell level in the total\nmonocyte population and ILT4\u00fe and ILT4\u00ad\nmonocyte subsets from patients and con-\ntrols (Figure 1d), TNF-a production was\nfound to be restricted to ILT4\u00ad monocytes.\nThere was no significant difference between\npatients and controls in TNF-a production\nby ILT4\u00ad monocytes.\nAdalimumab treatment resulted in a sig-\nnificant increase in ILT4 positivity and\ndecreases in costimulatory molecule-positive\ncell numbers compared with baseline\n(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Figure 1e).\nThere was a significant positive correlation\nbetween the ILT4-positivity at week 12 and\nFigure 1f).\nDiscussion\nThe present study found that CD40L-sti-\nmulation resulted in significantly more\nILT4\u00fe monocytes in PBMC cultures from\ncontrol subjects than those from patients\nwith psoriatic arthritis. APCs expressing\nhigh levels of ILT4 are known to anergize\nand convert them into regulatory T (Treg)\ncells, propagating the T-cell suppression\ncascade.6 The regulatory properties of\nILT4 are mediated by downregulation of\nthe costimulatory proteins CD40, CD80 and\nCD86, hindering their ability to activate\nCD4\u00fe cells.7 Thus, the downregulation of\nILT4 and upregulation of costimulatory pro-\nteins on monocytes from patients with psori-\natic arthritis may suggest that these cells\nacquire an activated/nontolerogenic pheno-\ntype that may contribute to abnormally high\nAPC activation. Inappropriate APC activity\nin affected joints, together with the accumu-\nlation of activated T-cells, may drive the\ninitiation and persistence of T-cell activation.8\nIn conclusion, 12 weeks' treatment with\nadalimumab resulted in a significant\nincrease in ILT4-positive cells and reduced\ncells in monocytes from patients with\nTable 1.

This effect may be related\nto the ability of adalimumab to block the\nTNF-a effect in vivo, which may then inhibit\nILT4 production by APCs.9 However, the\ndirect relationship we found between ILT4-\npositivity and the change in DAS44 after\ntreatment suggests that the effect of adali-\nmumab on monocyte surface phenotype\nmay be due to modification of the inflam-\nmatory milieu associated with therapy-\ninduced reduction of disease activity.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFigure 1.
