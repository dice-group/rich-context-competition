What is unique about this study is\nthat we explore the possible impact that different social pro-\ngrammes, such as entitlement unemployment benefits or means-\ntested welfare schemes could have with respect to ameliorating\na possible negative mental health impact among the unem-\nployed, as well as the fact that we are able to look at different\nemployment arrangements simultaneously.\nOur hypothesis is that economic hardship is only one of the\neffects associated with being without a job.30 Unemployment\nmay have additional psychological and sociological costs that\ncould be mitigated by different activities and programmes of\nsocial support in addition to the provision of economic relief.\nWe argue that in order to have a protective effect on mental\nhealth, social support should not only consist of adequate\neconomic assistance, but should simultaneously seek to\nalleviate the additional sociological and psychological impact of\nunemployment.\nThe importance of social support in protecting health has\nbeen widely documented since the publication of a compre-\nhensive review by Cassel in 1976.31 In addition, recent research\nindicates that `the actual social environment is not the source of\nsome protective factors for mental health; instead, what may\nbe more important is how the environment is perceived'\n(p.395),32 and that the effect of perceived support is not always\nmediated by actual supportive behaviours.33 While the social\nenvironment can be the source of adverse health outcomes, the\nway social support is perceived could be a key factor in\nbenefiting from its health protective effects.\nIn a previous study it was found that the type of unem-\nployment benefits received played a role in modifying the\nimpact of unemployment on symptoms of depression,12 but\nthe nature of the cross-sectional analysis carried out precluded\nthe possibility of assessing whether the observed differences\nwere due to the impact of the different benefit programmes\nor to a selection process. By using longitudinal data, we are able\nto further explore the possible differences between unemployed\ngroups in relation to full-time employed, and to better under-\nstand how men and women are affected in different ways.\nMethods\nWe analysed panel data collected in the National Survey of\nstudy consisted of interviews with 13 014 respondents, of\nents an attrition rate of 23%. We analysed possible differences\nbetween respondents to the 1992 survey and those who were\nlost to follow-up after the 1987 interview. There were no\nsignificant differences in attrition rates by gender, age, ethnic\ngroup, and marital status between those who were re-\ninterviewed and those lost to follow-up.\nWe limited our analysis to those respondents who were aged\nAs the outcome measure, we used a depression index created\nfrom the responses to 15 items from the Center for Epidemio-\nlogical Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D) which were included\nin the survey. The 15 CES-D items are described in Appendix 1.\nThe index of depression ranged from 0 to 105, and we trans-\nformed it to log (depression + 0.05) to better fit the assumptions\nof multiple regression analyses. The mean (and standard devia-\ntion) of the untransformed and transformed index were 16.89\nsymmetric with the mean in the middle of the range of \u00ad0.693\nand 4.66. An advantage of the log transformation is that the\nregression coefficients that result from the analysis can be back-\ntransformed to yield an interpretation of how many times\nhigher or lower is the depression index for one group compared\nto another.\nAn employment situation variable was constructed from\nseveral variables asking about the respondents' employment.\nEmployed respondents in 1987 were divided into full- and\npart-time employed, depending on whether they worked 30,\nemployed population into two additional categories according\nto whether or not they were satisfied with their jobs. Satis-\nfaction with 1992 employment reflects the perception of the\nindividual, and could be due to a variety of both structural and\npersonal factors (e.g. level of benefits, schedule, friendliness of\nsupervisors of co-workers).\nIn addition, we differentiated those working people who were\nsimultaneously receiving welfare benefits (i.e. means-tested or\npublic assistance), and followed the same strategy. Males work-\ning and receiving welfare could not be included in the analysis\nbecause of the insignificant number involved.\nNon-employed individuals looking for work during the\n4 weeks prior to the interview, and those not actively looking\nfor work were separated into two categories. These two groups\nwere then further divided into three categories: (1) people\nreceiving public assistance in the form of welfare or means-\ntested benefits; (2) people receiving income from government\nentitlement benefit programmes (including veterans' benefits,\nunemployment compensation, and worker's compensation),\nand (3) people not receiving any type of income or economic\nassistance. This last group of non-working people is difficult to\ninterpret; it could include both people out of the labour force\nby choice, and unemployed people who have given up looking\nfor work. Of these, we do not know how many are housewives\nby choice, students, or simply discouraged unemployed not\neligible for any kind of benefits. There was no question\nincluded in the survey that allowed us to differentiate between\nthese three groups of people included in the same category of\nnon-employed and not looking for work without receiving\nany benefits.\nThose who were fully retired in 1992 were grouped in a\nseparate category. The typology of employment situation was\noperationalized as dummy variables.\nStatistical analysis\nWe ran three different multiple regression models to explain\ndepression. First, we analysed the possible impact of 1987\nemployment status and receipt of benefits on 1992 depression,\nindex of depression, and two measures of social support\n(number of social contacts, and having someone to call in an\nSecond, we added other 1992 factors to the model, including\nyears of education in 1992, marital status, family income, assets\nand debts, having a physical or mental limitation that would\nrestrict the ability to work, number of weeks unemployed\nduring the year before the second interview (i.e. 1991), fre-\nquency of social contacts, satisfaction with personal relations,\nand environmental variables such as unemployment rate in the\nState of residence and amount of unemployment benefit\navailable per unemployed person in the relevant State. Third,\nwe added employment situation in 1992 to create a full model\nthat allowed us to assess the impact of current employment\nstatus on depression while controlling for 1987 employment.\nWe used a Box-Cox transformation of the income, assets and\ndebts variables to reduce skewness of these variables. The\noptimal transformations were found by doing a grid search over\npossible values of the Box-Cox shape parameter. The appro-\npriate regression diagnostic tests were performed to assess the fit\nof the model. We did not impute any missing values in the\ndependent variable. For the categorical independent variables,\nwe added an option of `no response' where necessary. The\nincome, assets and debts variables were complex, comprised of\nmany components. If a component was missing, we imputed\nthe values deterministically with the predicted values estimated\nfor the age, sex, ethnic, marital and occupational group of the\nrespondent. Preliminary analyses indicated that results were not\nsensitive to the inclusion of these imputed values.\nTo control for a possible reverse causation effect, we included\nin our model previous measures of depression and employ-\nment history.\nResults\nTable 1 presents a description of our sample according to\nemployment status and reported level of depression in 1992.\nConsistent with the literature, women report higher levels\nof depression symptoms than men. The main similarities\nbetween men and women are the lower levels of depression\nindicators among respondents who are full- or part-time\nemployed and satisfied with their jobs, and those who are fully\nretired. All respondents report higher indices of depression if\nthey were unemployed and receiving welfare (i.e. means-tested)\nbenefits.\nTable 2 presents the results of our multiple regression analysis\ntoms of depression. As observed in Table 2, the important\nfactors in explaining less symptoms of depression include age\nand years of education. Index of depression previously reported\nbetween men and women include frequency of social contacts\nbeing negatively associated with depression only among men.\nRace other than white or African American is associated with\nthe depression outcome only among women.\nTable 1 Means and standard deviations (SD) of depression index for different employment status groups in 1992 (range: 0\u00ad105)\nWomen Men\nEmployment status Mean SD N Mean SD N\na Government.\nb These groups were not included in the regression analysis due to small number of observations in these categories.\nIn comparison with full-time workers, women not working,\nnot looking for work, and not receiving any social benefits in\n1987 (i.e. mostly housewives) report a lower index of depres-\nlower. A similar association is observed among unemployed\nwomen who were looking for work while receiving govern-\nment (entitlement) benefits in 1987, although the confidence\ninterval for the effect is relatively large; these women have a\ndepression index that is 2.2 times lower than that of the\nreference group. In contrast, women who were not working\nwhile receiving welfare (means-tested) benefits in 1987 are\nsignificantly more likely to report depression in 1992; they have\nan index of depression that is 1.3 times higher.\nMen have a different pattern than women with regard to the\nassociation of employment status and depression. Only those\nwho were working part-time in 1987 report less symptoms of\ndepression in 1992 than full-time workers. No other important\ndifferences are observed among the other employment groups.\nWhen the 1992 explanatory variables are added to the regres-\nployment categories that remain inversely associated with 1992\ndepression are those of unemployed people receiving government\nbenefits. In addition, an inverse association is observed among un-\nemployed women who were not looking for work while receiv-\ning government benefits in 1987. For men (Table 3, column 2),\nwe observe the same association as in our reduced model: those\nwho were working part-time in 1987 report less symptoms of\nemployment status to the model (Table 3, Columns 3 and 4).\nWomen who were not satisfied with their job in 1992 report\nmore symptoms of depression than those who were satisfied.\nAmong non-working women, only those who were unemployed,\nnot looking for work, and receiving welfare benefits are more\nlikely to report depression than the comparison group. Men\nworking full-time but not satisfied with their jobs are more\ndepressed than those who were satisfied, and among the\nunemployed men only those looking for work while receiving\ngovernment benefits report more depression.\nFactors strongly related to depression in 1992, for men\nand women alike, are having a physical or mental condition\nthat could limit ability to work in 1992, and the respondents'\nbaseline 1987 index of depression (Table 3).

In\ncontrast, greater frequency of social contacts is associated with\nmore symptoms of depression.\nSome of the most notable differences between men and\nwomen include the impact of debts, and marital status. While\nbeing divorced, widowed or separated is significantly related to\ndepression among females, never having been married is what\nis significantly related to depression among men. Once we\ncontrol for 1992 employment status in our model, the impact of\nyears of education is no longer significant among women. In\naddition to total family assets, for women the amount of accu-\nmulated debt is also significantly related to depression. In\naddition, the number of weeks that respondents were unem-\nployed and looking for work during the previous year (i.e.\n1991) is significantly related to depression among men only.\nDiscussion\nLimitations\nFor researchers concerned with the dynamics at work between\nsocial issues and health, going beyond the modelling of complex\nrelationships among risk factors and focusing on an under-\nstanding of their origins and implications are significant\nchallenges. Our study confirms the need to look at men and\nwomen separately.\nWe attenuated the effects of reverse causation by using\nprospective longitudinal data. We controlled both for having\nany physical or mental condition that would limit the ability to\nwork for pay in 1992, and the previous index of depression.\nHowever, unemployed people receiving benefits differ in many\nways from people not receiving benefits, and these differences\nmay not be fully controlled for by the background covariates\nused in our analysis. Our exclusion criteria and the factors con-\ntrolled for in our models should have eliminated most of the\ndifferences between the various groups of unemployed people,\nbut uncontrolled variables determining both unemployment\nresources and health outcomes may still have existed.\nOne of the difficulties in a longitudinal study is that cases are\nsubject to attrition over time.34 Many variables expected to be\nrelated to drop-out status were included in the regression\nmodel, and the per cent of respondents lost to follow-up in\n1992 was similar across employment categories, with the\nexception of those unemployed actively looking for work and\nreceiving welfare or no benefits at all in 1987. Among those\ngroups, the attrition rate was close to 30%. It is plausible that\nunemployed people actively looking for work had a higher\nprobability of changing residencies and relocating, and\nconsequently a higher probability of being lost to follow-up.\nMain findings and implications\nOne of the most interesting findings is to see a direct effect of\nwere receiving government, i.e. entitlement, benefits in 1987.\nEven after incorporating 1992 variables in the regression\nmodel, unemployed women who were receiving entitlement\nbenefits in 1987 report less symptoms of depression than those\nwho were full-time employed. This finding gives support to\nthe hypothesis that the receipt of entitlement government\nassistance may have a long-term protective effect on unem-\nployed women, and confirms previous findings using cross-\nsectional data.\nOn the contrary, being unemployed and receiving means-\nHowever, the effect is reduced when we include 1992 variables\nTable 3 (continued)\n(Model 2) Full Model (Model 3)\nWomen Men Women Men\nNot working/Not looking for work, with gov.\nNo one to call in an emergency\nPositive value of a parameter estimate indicates a high value of index of depression in 1992, whereas a negative value indicates a low value of index of\nb Government.\nin the model. Not working while receiving welfare in 1992 has\na direct effect on increasing symptoms of depression among\nwomen. One possible explanation is that the amount of welfare\nbenefits provided is insufficient to positively influence mental\nhealth. However, given that we control for family income and\nwealth, other factors are more likely to be responsible for\nthe difference. Social stigma and/or some other factors in the\nprocess associated with receiving welfare benefits could add\nadditional stress to the lives of the recipients, which could offset\nsome of the positive impact of welfare or other means-tested\nbenefits. Previous research has shown the importance of per-\nception in mediating the effect of supportive events, and how\nthose perceptions influence the coping processes of individuals.\nIn any case, the 1992 employment situation is more important\nin having an impact on depression than the fact of having been\non welfare 5 years earlier.\nPrevious research has found an association between length of\nunemployment periods and depression. In our model the num-\ndirect effect on depression among women, but it has some effect\non decreasing symptoms of depression among men.\nIn our full regression model unemployed men who were\nlooking for work while receiving government benefits are more\nlikely to report symptoms of depression than the employed.\nThis could be due to the fact that government unemployment\nbenefits are usually short-term subsidies, and depression could\nbe higher during the initial period of the unemployment.\nMen on welfare report three times more symptoms of\ndepression than those employed and satisfied with their jobs\n(Table 1), and the lack of a direct impact on depression in our\nregression model is probably due to a small sample effect.\nIn this study we have been able to confirm simultaneously\nthe significant impact that both economic and emotional\nresources of the family have in explaining depression, for men\nand women alike. Interestingly, total family income is not a\nsignificant factor once family assets and debts are included in\nthe model, which suggests that those indicators could be better\nmeasures of wealth.\nThe effects of unemployment on depression depend upon\ngender and upon participation in governmental assistance\nprogrammes in a complex way. Continuing to develop an\nunderstanding of these effects will be increasingly important as\nrapid and substantial changes are made in the structure of\nemployment and governmental assistance for those not\nemployed.\n"
