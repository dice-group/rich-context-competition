Conclusions These results have important implications for the development of prevention and\ntreatment modalities.\nKey words ADHD; adolescence; smoking.\nIntroduction\nIt is well established that there are numerous negative\nhealth consequences due to smoking and that there is an\nincreased risk of smoking among those with a psychiatric\ndisorder (Breslau, Novak, & Kessler, 2004). Attention\nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the more\ncommon psychiatric disorders in childhood and adult-\nhood affecting between 2% and 5% of the population\n(American Psychiatric Association, 1994). In addition to\nhaving serious consequences for academic and other\noutcomes, ADHD is a significant risk factor for smoking\nnonADHD, respectively) and adolescents (19.0\u00ad46% vs.\n10\u00ad24% for ADHD and nonADHD, respectively)\n(Lambert & Hartsough, 1998; Milberger, Biederman,\nFaraone, Chen, & Jones, 1997; Milberger, Biederman,\nPomerleau, Downey, Stelson, & Pomerleau, 1995;\nRohde, Kahler, Lewinsohn, & Brown, 2004). Moreover,\nindividuals with ADHD report earlier initiation of\nsmoking and report more difficulty quitting than\nindividuals in the general population (Milberger et al.,\nThere is considerable evidence that core ADHD\nsymptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity\nconfer risk for smoking related behaviors, independent\nof clinical diagnosis. For example, in a recent study in\na large population-based sample of young adults, retro-\nspectively-reported ADHD symptoms were significantly\nand linearly related to lifetime smoking risk, age of\nonset of regular smoking and, among current smokers,\nnumber of daily cigarettes smoked (Kollins, Fuemmeler,\n& McClernon, 2005). The findings of this epidemiologic\nstudy are consistent with other reports in the literature\nusing community and nonclinical samples and with\nlaboratory studies of the effects of nicotine on attention\nand other executive functions (Burke, Loeber, & Lahey,\nAll correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Bernard F.

For example,\nthe risk for smoking has been shown to be more strongly\nassociated with the number of reported inattentive (IN)\nsymptoms than by the diagnosis of ADHD itself in\na clinical sample (Burke et al., 2001). In contrast, a study\nin a nonclinical population has reported that HI\nsymptoms are more strongly associated with lifetime\nrisk of smoking than IN symptoms (Kollins et al., 2005).\nThe differences in findings between these studies may\nreflect differences in how relations between ADHD\nsymptoms interact with smoking at various points in\nthe life-course. For instance, Burke et al. employed an\nadolescent sample, whereas the study by Kollins et al.\nwas a cross-sectional analysis of smoking in a young\nadult sample. As such, different ADHD symptoms may\ncontribute to different aspects of smoking behavior, and\nthese effects may be influenced by developmental level.\nOne potential approach for understanding the differ-\nential contribution of HI and IN symptoms to the\ndevelopment of smoking and related outcomes is to\nexamine the progression of smoking behavior prospectively.\nSmoking behavior does not progress similarly for all\nadolescents. For instance, some adolescents may experi-\nment with smoking but never become addicted, whereas\nothers may progress to regular smoking. Smoking experi-\nmentation is typically initiated during this early adolescent\nphase with those who begin at an earlier age more likely to\nbecome addicted and more likely to have more difficult time\nquitting (Chassin, Presson, Pitts, & Sherman, 2000;\nKhuder, Dayal, & Mutgi, 1999). Although several studies\nhave begun to show an association between smoking\nbehaviors and ADHD symptoms, few studies have explored\nthe degree to which symptoms influence progression to\nsmoking. Establishing an association between psychiatric\nsymptoms and the progression to addictive behaviors is a\nfirst step toward examining potential causal mechanisms\nand planning optimal methods and time periods for\nintervention. At least one study has examined the associa-\ntion between psychiatric disorders and risk to progression\nto daily smoking during the transition between adolescence\nand young adulthood and found a lifetime diagnosis of\nADHD to be a significant predictor of progression, although\nthis study did not report the differential effects of IN and HI\nsymptoms, and did not report on data from a population-\nThe purpose of the present study was twofold. First,\nwe assessed the differential effects of retrospectively\nreported HI and IN symptoms on the progression of\nsmoking behaviors from adolescence through young\nadulthood. Second, we examined the relation between\nHI and IN symptoms on reports of nicotine dependence\nin individuals who were current regular smokers. Based\non our previous work and the work of others suggesting\nhyperactive symptoms to be important predictors of\nlifetime smoking risk, we hypothesized that although both\nHI and IN symptoms would be associated with progres-\nsion to smoking, HI symptoms would confer a greater\nrisk. We examined data from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health)--a nationally\nrepresentative cohort of youth--to accomplish these goals\nMethods\nData Source\nThe study population was drawn from 20,747 adoles-\ncents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth, a nationally representative study of adolescents.\nThe longitudinal cohort includes 14,388 eligible respon-\ndents who participated in in-home surveys on three\nseparate occasions (April\u00adDecember, 1995, April\u00adAugust,\nsurvey participants on the three waves of data collection\nsurvey included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity,\nschool type, ethnic mix and size to garner a nationally\nrepresentative sample. Precise details regarding the design\nand data collection have been described elsewhere\nStudy Sample\nFor the present study, the subpopulation of individuals\nwith available population weights and who had reported\ndata on the smoking items that comprised the trajectory\ncategories included 13,494 participants. Women who\nwere pregnant (n \u00bc 379) were excluded, as it was believed\nthat women who were pregnant may alter their smoking\nbehaviors. Further, participants who were regular smokers\nat Wave I (n \u00bc 2670) were excluded from analysis\nbecause they would not provide unique information\nabout progression to smoking. Thus, the available study\nsample included 10,445 participants who included the\nfollowing: nonsmokers at Wave I who continued to be\nnonsmokers at Wave III (n \u00bc 4810), nonsmokers at\nWave I who went on to be experimenters at Wave III\n(n \u00bc 1554), nonsmokers at Wave I who went on to be\nregular smokers at Wave III (n \u00bc 1669), experimenters\nat Wave I who continued to be experimenters at Wave III\n(n \u00bc 993), and experimenters at Wave I who went on\nto be regular smokers at Wave III (n \u00bc 1419). See Fig. 1\nfor details.\nMeasures\nSmoking Progression and Dependence. In our analyses,\nsmoking experimentation was defined as those subjects\nwho had smoked a whole cigarette at least once. Regular\nsmoking was defined as ever having smoked at least one\ncigarette daily for 30 consecutive days. Based on these\ndefinitions, three separate dichotomous smoking trajec-\ntories were used to describe progression of nicotine use\nacross Waves I and III. First, an Experimentation (EXP)\ntrajectory was defined in which adolescents who reported\nno experimentation with smoking at either Waves I or III\nwere classified as 0; those who reported no experimenta-\ntion at Wave I, but experimentation at Wave III (but not\nregular use) were classified as 1. A second trajectory,\nRegular Smoking Initiation (RegSmk) was defined as\nfollows: those subjects who reported no experimentation\nat either Waves I or III were classified as 0; those who\nreported no experimentation at Wave I, but regular\nsmoking at Wave III were classified as 1. Finally, a third\ntrajectory of Progression to Regular Smoking (ProgSmk)\nwas defined. In this trajectory, subjects who reported\nexperimentation at Wave I and regular smoking at\nWave III were classified as 1, while all others were\nclassified as 0. These three trajectories, therefore,\ncaptured different patterns of smoking progression from\nadolescence to young adulthood.\nParticipants who reported current regular smoking at\nWave III also completed the six items that comprise\nthe Fagerstro\n\u00a8m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND),\na widely used measure of nicotine use (Heatherton,\nKozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991). Sample items\nof the FTND include, ``do you smoke more frequently\nduring the first hours after waking than during the rest of\nthe day'' and ``do you still smoke even if you are so ill\nthat you are in bed most of the day.''

Scores from this instru-\nment have been found to be correlated with biomarkers\nfor nicotine levels (C. S. Pomerleau, Carton, Lutzke,\nFlessland, & Pomerleau, 1994; Radzius, Moolchan,\nHenningfield, Heishman, & Gallo, 2001). Summed\nscores from these six items were used as the primary\nmeasure of nicotine dependence for analysis.\nADHD\nIn Wave III, participants were asked to retrospectively\nreport ADHD symptoms experienced between the ages of\n5 and 12 years. Respondents were asked to report the\nfrequency of a symptom using a 4-point Likert scale:\nnever or rarely, sometimes, often, very often. For reasons\nthat are not clear, one item asked in the retrospective\nADHD section of Wave III--``you were spiteful or\nvindictive''--is not a DSM-IV ADHD symptom and was\nexcluded from analyses; while one DSM-IV impulsivity\nsymptom, ``often interrupts or intrudes on others'' was\nnot included in the retrospective ADHD section. Thus,\nour analyses included responses to nine IN and eight HI\nsymptoms. Table I displays symptoms of ADHD assessed\nin Add Health.\nA symptom was considered present if it was\nexperienced ``often'' or ``very often.'' This approach\nto dichotomizing symptoms has been used in other\ncommunity-based studies of ADHD symptomatology, is\nconsidered clinical convention (Murphy & Barkley, 1996)\nand was also used in a previous study on the relation\nbetween ADHD and smoking outcomes (Kollins et al.,\n2005). For our primary analyses, the total number of\nsymptoms reported (0\u00ad9 for IN; 0\u00ad8 for HI) was used as\na measure of ADHD severity in order to assess the\nrelation between symptoms and smoking progression and\ndependence. Individuals were also classified into one\nof four clinically relevant groups based on the number\nof reported symptoms: (a) IN subtype: 6 IN symptoms,\nsymptoms, <6 IN symptoms (2.93%); (c) Combined\nsubtype: 6 IN symptoms AND 6 HI symptoms\nsymptoms (91.86%). The six-symptom cutoff was chosen\nto be consistent with DSM-IV ADHD criteria requiring\nthe presence of six or more symptoms from either the IN\nor HI symptom domains. As such, it does not represent\na proxy for the diagnosis of ADHD.\nThe use of retrospective report is common in clinical\npractice when working with adults with ADHD and data\nexist that support the reliability and validity of these self-\nreports (Epstein & Kollins, 2005; P. Murphy & Schachar,\n1993; Zucker, Morris, Ingram, Morris, & Bakeman,\n2002). In our previous report, we also demonstrated\nadequate reliability and validity of this approach by\ndemonstrating good internal consistency of the items\n(a \u00bc .86) as well as showing that parents of respondents\nreporting six or more symptoms on either or both HI and\nIN scales were more likely to indicate learning or\nbehavioral problems at Wave 1; and these individuals\nalso were more likely to report taking medications for\nADHD at Wave III (Kollins et al., 2005).\nDemographic and Other Variables\nDemographic factors that have been shown to contribute\nto smoking risk were also assessed. These included items\nassessing gender, race (white vs. nonwhite), and indica-\ntors of socioeconomic status (parental report of the\nhighest education level of either themselves or their\nspouse and whether the family of the participants had\nreceived public assistance at Wave I).\nSince conduct disorder (CD) has been shown in\nprevious studies to be an important mediator of the risk\nTable I.

Logistic regression analyses were used to\npredict smoking trajectories from self-reported ADHD\nsymptoms. Two models were tested for each trajectory.\nIn the first, the total number of IN and HI symptoms\nwere used as predictors and in the second, the subtype\nclassification of ADHD symptoms was used (i.e., IN, HI,\nCombined, and Control).

These findings extend previous work by\nour group which found that ADHD symptoms, most\nnotably HI symptoms, increased lifetime risk of regular\nsmoking (Kollins et al., 2005). In the present study,\nHI symptoms were significantly associated with the\nprogression from nonsmoking to regular smoking, and\nwith the progression from experimentation to regular\nsmoking. These results were significant even after\ncontrolling for a range of other variables associated with\nsmoking risk, as well as controlling for IN symptoms.\nWe also found that among current smokers, the\nnumber of self-reported IN symptoms was significantly\nassociated with the level of nicotine dependence as\nmeasured by items from the FTND. However, when the\nclinically relevant subtypes of symptoms were examined,\nall three symptom clusters (IN, HI, and Comb) were\nsignificantly associated with nicotine dependence.\nConsistent with other complementary studies,\nwe also found in our models that white adolescents\nwere significantly more likely to progress to experimenta-\ntion from nonsmoking and regular smoking from\nnonsmoking than members of other racial/ethnic groups\n(Flint, Yamada, & Novotny, 1998; Robinson, Berlin, &\nMoolchan, 2004). We did not find that Whites were\nsignificantly more likely to be in the trajectory group from\nexperimentation to regular smoking. It may be that racial\ndifferences are mitigated among those who are initially\nmore experienced with tobacco use during adolescence,\nalthough this deserves further study. This finding may\nalso reflect differences across racial categories with respect\nto onset of regular smoking. For example, one study\nfound that African-American youth exhibited a 1-year\ndelay in onset of both initiation and daily smoking,\ncompared to nonAfrican-American youth (Robinson et al.,\n2004). We also found that CD symptoms were\nsignificantly associated with smoking progression in all\nthree trajectory groups. This is consistent with the\ndocumented literature suggesting that CD symptoms\nenhance risk of many types of substance use, including\ntobacco (Lynskey & Fergusson, 1995). The findings\nextend the literature as few studies have examined the\nrole of CD on smoking progression in longitudinal\nOne of the unique aspects of the current study was\nthat we examined the role that ADHD has on various\npatterns of smoking progression. In this study, ADHD\nsymptoms expressed both continuously and as clinically\nrelevant subtypes were associated with smoking progres-\nsion, but not with progression to experimentation.\nAlthough future studies are needed in this area, the\nfindings suggest that HI symptoms play a key role in the\nadoption of regular smoking, but HI and IN symptoms\ndo not seem to play a role in the progression to\nexperimentation. In our previous study, we found that\nADHD symptoms were associated with earlier age of\nonset of smoking (Kollins et al., 2005). To the extent that\nADHD symptoms were associated with earlier onset, it is\npossible that ADHD symptoms are associated with earlier\nexperimentation. Notably, in order to study progression,\nwe excluded some individuals from our analyses because\nthey had already had a history of regular smoking prior to\nthe baseline data collection. Future prospective studies\nwill be needed that can assess ADHD symptoms and\nsmoking behaviors from an earlier age in order to more\ndefinitely determine and describe this ADHD symptom--\nsmoking relation from early childhood, to adolescence,\nto young adulthood. Overall, the findings are important\nas they extend previous work by demonstrating not only\nthat ADHD symptoms are associated with lifetime risk\nof smoking (Kollins et al., 2005), but also that they\ninfluence the developmental progression of smoking\nbehavior.\nAnother unique aspect of the study was that we\nexamined what effect retrospectively reported ADHD\nsymptoms had on nicotine dependence in current\nsmokers. When we assessed ADHD symptoms as a\ncontinuous factor, IN and HI symptoms were related to\nFTND scores and, when the ADHD subtype variable\nwas used in the regression analyses, all three subtypes\npredicted FTND scores. We also found that when\nconsidering symptom presentation that is below tradi-\ntional clinical levels (i.e., less than six symptoms), only\nIN symptoms regulate nicotine dependence. These\nfindings are consistent with the literature documenting\nthe beneficial effects of nicotine on attention (Levin et al.,\nthey suggest individuals with inattention symptoms may\nADHD Symptoms and Smoking Progression 1209\nbe administering nicotine to improve attention. These\npreliminary findings suggest more research is needed on\nthe role that IN and HI have on regulating dependence in\nboth clinical and nonclinical ADHD samples.\nThere are several limitations to the present study that\nwarrant comment. First, the primary independent variable\nwas based on retrospective self-report of ADHD symp-\ntoms in childhood. The nature of the Add Health survey\nwas such that individuals were asked to report on\nsymptoms occurring 10 years before the time of report.\nAs such, the extent to which this self-report reliably\nand validly reflects ADHD symptoms in childhood is\nunknown. Complicating this issue is the degree to which\nindividuals with true ADHD symptoms may be able to\naccurately report on the presence or absence of such\nsymptoms. However, as mentioned, the use of retro-\nspective report is very common in clinical practice when\nworking with adults with ADHD, and these approaches\nhave been found to be reliable and valid (Epstein &\nmore, the Add Health survey of HI symptoms lacked one\nitem included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders nomenclature (i.e., interrupts or\nintrudes on others) (American Psychiatric Association,\n1994). If this is a low prevalent symptom, in the\npopulation, there may be negligible effects; however,\nif it is a highly prevalent symptom, the data may\nunderestimating HI symptoms. It is difficult to know\nfor certain what effect these survey limitations may have\non our findings. However, as we have noted previously,\nthe approach to quantifying ADHD symptoms within the\nAdd Health does appear demonstrate consistency among\nthe items and promising evidence of measurement\nvalidity (i.e., parents of respondents reporting six or\nmore symptoms on either or both HI and IN scales were\nmore likely to indicate that their participating child had\na learning or behavioral problem when they were\nchildren and respondents also were more likely to\nreport taking medications for ADHD symptoms at\nA second limitation was the use of the FTND as the\nprimary measure of nicotine dependence. The FTND\nhas been criticized as more a measure of ``use'' than\na measure of ``dependence'' (Colby, Tiffany, Shiffman,\n& Niaura, 2000). Assessment of craving or the use of\nbiological verification may have been a more precise way\nof characterizing nicotine use and dependence, but these\nendpoints were unavailable in the context of the available\ndata set.\nA third limitation is that the Add Health study is not\na clinical sample. Thus, although we categorized indivi-\nduals based on subtypes of ADHD symptom (predomi-\nnately inattention, predominately hyperactive, and\ncombined) this cannot be considered a true diagnostic\nestimate of prevalence in the population. Rather, this\nmethod was primarily chosen to explore how\nthe potentially relevant ``clinical categories'' relate to\nsmoking progression. A further limitation of using a\nnonclinical sample is that alternative comorbid diagnoses\ncould not be evaluated. Therefore, the impact of clinically\nrelevant symptoms and categories as well as other\npotential related diagnoses (e.g., Pervasive Developmental\nDisorders, Anxiety Disorders) could not be fully exam-\nined in the current models. The effect of these conditions\nwill need to be evaluated with clinic-based rather than\npopulation-based samples. Nevertheless, the approach\ntaken in this study provides evidence of a potential\nrelation between ADHD symptoms (along with subtypes)\nand smoking progression at a population-level and thus,\nadds to and extends research in clinical samples. Finally,\na myriad of factors have been associated with smoking\ninitiation and progression including, family, peer, envi-\nronmental, and policy. While a full treatment of these\nfactors is outside the scope of the current study, this area\nis ripe for future investigation.\nIn spite of its limitations, the present study has a\nnumber of strengths. This is the first study to system-\natically examine the link between ADHD symptoms\nand progression of smoking behaviors in a nationally\nrepresentative longitudinal cohort. As such, these findings\nadd to the literature that has previously identified risk\nconferred by ADHD symptoms to smoking outcomes,\nAlso, these findings highlight the potential unique\ncontributions of the IN and HI symptom domains in\nthe development of smoking-related behaviors. Under-\nstanding such differences will be important to extend this\nwork and to consider how the present data may be used\nto develop viable prevention or intervention strategies.\nThe present results suggest that the observed effects\nhave important public health implications. The specific\nresults indicate that a one unit increase in hyperactive\nsymptoms was associated with a 14% increased odds\nof progressing from no smoking in adolescence to initiat-\ning regular smoking and a 16% increased odds of\nprogressing from experimentation to regular smoking.\nMoreover, having six or more symptoms of both types of\nADHD symptoms was associated with a two and a half\nfold increased odds of progressing from no smoking\nto initiating regular smoking and a nearly two fold\nincreased odds of progressing from experimenting to\nregular smoking. If these associations represent a true\nrelationship, they could have an important implication at\na population level, as ADHD symptoms are common\namong children. Continued research that can verify these\nassociations would be needed to accurately estimate\nthe population effect. Nevertheless, an implication of the\npresent study is that measuring these symptoms in the\ngeneral population may prove useful in identifying\nindividuals at higher risk for smoking, regardless of\nwhether they are also at risk for ADHD diagnosis. Such\nindividuals might then be selectively targeted for early\nprevention/intervention efforts. Likewise, our findings\ncould inform treatment and prevention efforts and\nsuggest that the effects of such efforts may be moderated\nby the presence of ADHD symptoms. That is, traditional\nprevention and intervention programs may be less\neffective among individuals with high levels of ADHD\nsymptomatology.\nThese results highlight the need for additional work\nin this area. Notably, the study results are correlational.\nIdeally, research that uses prospective longitudinal\ndesigns to more fully characterize the relationship\nbetween ADHD symptoms in youth with smoking\noutcomes later in life will address some of the limitations\nof the current study. Given the convergence in the\nliterature with respect to the link between ADHD\nsymptoms and nicotine use, as well as laboratory studies\nof nicotine effects on attention and related process, basic\nlaboratory studies that investigate the potential mecha-\nnisms underlying these associations are warranted.\n"
