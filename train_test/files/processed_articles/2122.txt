The ATUS is a large, on-going, cross-sectional survey of where Americans spend time and what activities they\nundertake in those locations. The data are reported as a series of sequential activities over a 24-h time period F a ``diary day'' F starting at 0400 hours.\nBetween 12,000 and 13,000 surveys are obtained each year and the Bureau has plans to continue ATUS for the foreseeable future. The ATUS already\nhas about 73,000 diary days of data, more than twice as many as that which currently exists in the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)\n``Consolidated Human Activity Database'' (CHAD) that the Agency uses for exposure modeling purposes. There are limitations for using ATUS in\nmodeling human exposures to environmental pollutants. The ATUS does not report the location for a number of activities regarded as ``personal.'' For\n2006, personal activities with missing location information totaled 572 min/day, on average, for survey participants: about 40% of their day. Another\nlimitation is that ATUS does not distinguish between indoor and outdoor activities at home, two of the traditional locational demarcations used in human\nexposure modeling. This lack of information affects exposure estimates to both indoor and outdoor air pollutants and potentially affects non-dietary\ningestion estimates for children, which can vary widely depending on whether or not a child is indoors. Finally, a detailed analysis of the work travel\nactivity in a subsample from ATUS 2006 indicates that the coding scheme is not fully consistent with a CHAD-based exposure modeling approach. For\nATUS respondents in this subsample who reported work as an activity, roughly 48% of their days were missing work travel at one or both ends of the\nwork shift or reported within work-shift travel inconsistently. An extensive effort would be needed to recode work travel data from ATUS for EPA's\nexposure modeling purposes.\nKeywords: American Time Use Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics, time use, travel, exposure modeling.\nIntroduction\nSince the early 1980s the US Environmental Protection\nAgency's (EPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and\nStandards (OAQPS) has modeled exposures to environmen-\ntal pollutants using a time-series approach (Johnson, 1995).\nA major output of these models has been ``the time pattern of\ndose rate received'' in the respiratory system, as that process\nis what gives rise to adverse health risks associated with\nairborne pollutant exposures (McCurdy, 1997). Time series\nexposure models enable the researcher to explicitly account\nfor the correlated, and sequential, nature of human activity,\n``activity level,'' and location as a person goes through her or\nhis daily life. OAQPS' Air Pollution Exposure Model\n(APEX) uses a time series approach, described in Ambient\nStandards Group (2007) and other reports available on\nEPA's Technology Transfer Network (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/).\nThe multi-route, multi-media time series logic used in APEX\nis now also used in OAQPS's Total Risk Integrated Model\n(TRIM; Palma et al., 1999) and in the EPA National\nExposure Research Laboratory's Stochastic Human\nExposure and Dose Simulation model (Burke et al., 2001;\nOne distinguishing characteristic of all these models is their\nneed for human activity time use data that are specific to an\nindividual and temporally sequential (chronological) for\nevery activity undertaken and every location visited. The\nmodels use the midnight-to-midnight time period so that\nhourly and daily exposures are simulated efficiently. Time use\ndata having all these characteristics are needed on a\nlongitudinal basis for the exposure models, so NERL\ndeveloped the Consolidated Human Activity Database\n(CHAD; available at http://www.epa.gov/chadnet1/)\ndays of data, most of which are from probability-based,\nnationally representative studies. The remainder are from\npanel studies that are either probability-based for a single\nurban area or are from convenience samples of smaller areas.\n1.

Almost 37% of the data used by\nOAQPS is cross-sectional in nature, 1 day per person, while\n2-day diaries constitute 34% of the database. The remaining\n30% have 3 or more diary days of data for a single\nindividual. EPA's exposure models cited above simulate\nsubjects' time series in silico by linking individual days of\ninformation longitudinally in a manner that replicates intra-\nand inter-individual variability and daily correlations from\nobserved time-use data (Glen et al., 2008). About 34% of the\nthe 1980s. The older data in CHAD may no longer reflect\nwell where people are in time and space.\nA relatively new source of human activity data is the\nAmerican Time Use Survey (ATUS). The US Census\nBureau conducts a number of probability-based, nationally\nrepresentative surveys every year for the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS), two of which are the Current Popula-\ntion Survey (CPS) and ATUS. The ATUS is described at\nhttp://www.bls.gov/tus/. The ATUS collects data on how\nAmericans spend time on 1 day a year, which BLS calls ``a\ntypical day.'' The data are downloadable from its website, as\nare the coding manuals, activity lexicon, lists of variables\nsurveyed, data dictionaries, and so on (BLS, 2007a). The\nATUS is further described below.\nThe intent of this paper is to investigate the ATUS\ndatabase from the perspective of using it in EPA's time series\nexposure simulation models cited above. We also provide\ndescriptive statistical analyses of data from ATUS regarding\n``travel,'' an important topic in modeling ``near-roadway,''\nand ``in-cabin'' exposures (Flachsbart, 1995; Adar et al.,\n2007a, b). To our knowledge, ATUS has not yet been used\nby the exposure modeling community, even though it\ncontains more-current time use information than does\nCHAD or any single data source that we know of.\nThe ATUS is a continuously administered survey of how\nnon-institutionalized civilian US residents use time. It is a\nprobability-weighted, national, cross-sectional survey of time\nuse based on a sampling design that selects one person Z15\nyears old per household from households that completed\neight previous CPS interviews. It is a ``post hoc'' survey,\nasking the respondent what he or she did for the 24-h period\nstarting at 0400 hours on the previous day. For each activity\nundertaken, questions are asked about what the person was\ndoing, where the activity occurred, and who the person was\nwith at the time (BLS, 2007b). Twenty-six locations\n(TEWHERE) are coded: 14 specific places, 10 transit types,\nand two that are not very informative (``unspecified place''\nand ``unspecified mode of transportation''). In addition, two\nof the ``specific'' TEWHERE codes are not informative from\nan exposure perspective: ``other place'' (TEWHERE \u00bc 11)\nand ``other mode of transportation'' (TEWHERE \u00bc 21).\nThis nonspecific location data illustrates a limitation common\nthroughout extant activity data, including those in CHAD.\nThe complete list of locations captured by the TEWHERE\nvariable in ATUS appears in Table 1.\nSpecific activities are classified into 17 major (Tier 1)\nTable 1.

From an exposure modeling perspective, an\nevent occurs whenever an activity, location, or clock hour\nchanges, so activities 460 min are subdivided into more than\none event. The median number of events per day for adults in\nCHAD is 38, with a mean of 39 (Graham and McCurdy,\n2004). We calculated the exposure-modeling median and\nmean number of events from the 2006 ATUS data and found\nthey matched those from CHAD. In looking across age/\ngender groups in the 2006 ATUS data, there are differences\nin the mean number of events recorded, but they are small\nand not considered further in our analysis.\nMissing Location Information\nAs mentioned, ATUS does not report location information\nfor two Tier 1 Activity Codes (01 personal care and 50\nunable to code) and for two place and mode of transporta-\ntion locations (89 and 99, respectively), see Table 1. Activities\nincluded under personal care are sleeping, napping, and lying\nawake; using the bathroom and washing (including bathing/\nshowering); dressing and grooming; and participating in self-\nhealth care, sex, other private activity, or a personal\nemergency. The location code used for these activities is\nWe analyzed the amount of TEWHERE \u00bc \u00c01 missing\nlocation data in the 2006 ATUS survey to get a sense of the\nissue; the missing location logic is common across the survey\nnot addressed in that Table as they have very little impact on\nthe results.

Table 4 illustrates the level of detail available from\nATUS for all the years surveyed. Although the data can be\ndisaggregated by age and gender, we combined all respon-\ndents' information in Table 4, including that for 15-year olds.\nThe largest proportions of trips taken are for Work (13.4%),\nSocializing and Leisure (16.3%). There is some, though\nnot extensive, variability in the median time spent in Tier 2\nactivities within each Tier 1 category by those who undertake\ntravel (historically called ``Doers'' in the exposure modeling\nfield).\nWe aggregated the Tier 1 activity codes into five general\ncategories for further analyses. Tables 5 and 6 present\nweighted descriptive statistics for these aggregated categories\nfor females and males, respectively. ``Education'' travel in\nTables 5 and 6 are the same as the Work and Work-related\nTravel results for both genders generally seem to be\nintuitive and similar across the survey years. Educational\ntravel for both females and males drop off acutely past age 20\nyears: see ``% Doers.'' The time spent per day (by Doers) in\neducational travel does not change much, however, with age\nor survey year. We note that there are some small sample\nsizes for this category, especially for respondents 444 years\nof age. Proportionately more females undertake household\ntravel for longer daily periods of time than males in all of the\nage groupings. Leisure travel decreases with age in both\ngenders and this is true for all of the years surveyed. Females\nundertake proportionately more shopping trips than do\nmales, but there is not much difference in the time spent per\nday in that activity either between genders or by survey year.\nTo better understand the ATUS travel data, we undertook\ndetailed analysis of work-related trips reported by the 2006\nsample respondents. There were 3,972 diary days with work/\nwork-related travel in ATUS (codes 1805xx) for that year:\n30.7% of the total days. This percentage seems reasonable as\nweekend and non-workers are included in the sample. The\nbreakdown of respondents with and without one or more\npaid employment code (TEWHERE \u00bc 2) during their 2006\nATUS surveyed day appears in Table 7, which shows that the\nunweighted proportion of ``workers'' varies greatly by age\nand gender.\nage/gender group using a weighted analysis of ATUS\nresponses. We regressed work travel time and the natural\nlog of work travel time on age category, gender, and their\ninteraction using the SAS MIXED procedure. On the basis\nof the residuals analysis from these weighted regression\nmodels, we found that the natural logarithm of time was\npreferred over the original-scale time metric (see Methods\nsection). Figure 1 depicts the weighted empirical distribution\nfunctions for 2006 by age/gender group. For each year in the\ncategories travel for work than females, and their time spent\nin travel is slightly longer. We tested the equality of means for\ntime spent in work travel by gender, regressing the log of\nwork travel time on year (a class variable) in SAS MIXED\ntested the differences between pairwise least squares means\nand found that the means for 2005 differed from those for\nother years for females and similarly for 2006 for males. We\nfound no linear trend in time.\nThe wide interval between the median and maximum\ntravel times depicted in Tables 5 and 6 for all of the survey\nyears and by travel type indicates that there are substantive\ndifferences among individuals in the time spent in a particular\ntravel category. Using the mean estimate for all individuals\nin an age/gender cohort can significantly under-predict travel\ntime for some people. It is usually the people at the ``tail of\nthe distribution'' who are of most interest from the exposure\nIn evaluating the ATUS work travel data (1805xx code),\nwe noticed that the mean values for work travel were lower\nthan those usually reported (US Census, 2005). The average\ndaily one-way commute for US workers is 24.3 min/day\n(presumably 48.6 min/day round-trip), whereas the ATUS\ndata for total daily work trips (weighted average) ranged\nTo better understand how work travel was coded in ATUS,\nwe evaluated the activity records for 500 individuals from the\nlocation. They are called ``workers'' for our purposes. The\nresults are depicted in Table 8. Twenty-nine of the diaries could\nnot be definitively analyzed due to major uncertainties about\nthe TEWHERE code itself, illogical trip modes/times, and\nother discrepanciesFaccounting for 5.8% of the sample.\nWorker trips were disaggregated by ``shift'' types and by mode\nof travel. Most people worked only one shift during the\nsampled day (98.4%), although some of the reported shifts\noccurred at either or both ends of the 24-hour day beginning\nat home, a surprisingly small percentage. Equally small is\nthe number of people who did not report using a car or truck\nfor work travel: only 10% of all work trips evaluated used\nsomething other than a car or small truckFeither as a\npassenger or the driverFin the 500 cases.\nAmerican time use survey\nBJ George and T McCurdy\nTable 5.

To and from issues are depicted in Table 8\nas one-side and both (sides) problems. A one-side problem\narose when work travel was coded as a non-work trip either\ngoing to work or coming from work. For instance, there were\n69 work trips preceding a TEWHERE \u00bc 2 location that were\ncoded as some other type of trip. About half of these were\ncoded as a ``socializing and leisure'' (1812xx) trip because the\nperson did not start work immediately upon arriving at a\nTEWHERE \u00bc 2 location, even if the social activity only\nlasted a few minutes. The same was true for work trips coded\nobvious miscoded trips on the ``front-end,'' but these were\nminor in comparison with the non-work trip codes used on\nthe ``back-end'' of a work shift. There were 153 of those.\nMost of them were coded as shopping (1807xx), eating,\nsocializing, and professional care. In these cases (42% of the\nsubsample evaluated), the leaving-work trip was coded using\nthe next-activity undertaken by the individual. Although that\nis not illogical in itself, it systematically underestimates the\namount of time people travel for work in the ATUS sample,\nat least from an exposure modeling perspective. Obviously\nto/from work trips are not always handled consistently from\nan exposure modeling perspective in ATUS, as these were\nreview. The ``correct'' coding for exposure modeling\nidentified work-related travel without regard to the activity\nundertaken immediately before or after the trip to/from the\nTEWHERE \u00bc 2 location.\nWhen just those cases are considered that were coded as\ngoing to/coming from work for a TEWHERE \u00bc 2 event, the\nmean time spent in work travel is 21.2 min/day going to work\nand 21.7 coming from it. These values are still less than those\nfrom the US Census Bureau (24.3 min) each way, but are an\nimprovement over the 19\u00ad20 one-way min/trip obtained\nusing the ATUS-coded data.\nFinally, ``within-shift'' travel when a person is at a\nTEWHERE \u00bc 2 location is also handled inconsistently in\nATUS from an exposure modeling perspective for those\nworkers undertaking such a trip. These problems were\nconfined almost entirely to those people using a car/or truck\nfor work travel. Sometimes the out/back-to-work trips were\nboth coded as a work trip (17% of those taking such a trip),\nother times only one of these trips was coded as a work trip\n(64%)Fgenerally the return trip. Sometimes neither was\ncoded as a work trip (19%). Probably the latter is the\npreferred coding, but a case can be made for using a one-way\nback code also. The important point is that how within-shift\ntrips are treated in ATUS is not always consistent with the\nexposure modeling view.\nHome and Yard Coding\nAnother problem with ATUS from an in silico exposure\nmodeling perspective is the failure to distinguish between a\nrespondent's home and their yard. Both locations are coded\nas TEWHERE \u00bc 1. Thus, there is no distinction between the\noutdoors and indoors when someone is at home, which\npotentially has a major impact on estimating exposures to\nairborne pollutantsFboth for ambient air pollutants and for\nindoor-source air pollutants. There is also potential for\nmisclassification with respect to estimating non-dietary\ningestion as a pollutant pathway, as hand- and object-to-\nmouth frequencies are often very different between the\nindoors and outdoors (Xue et al., 2007). Even if we infer\nwhether or not an ATUS respondent is indoors given\nTEWHERE \u00bc 1, depending upon the activity being under-\ntaken and what events preceded and followed it, there is\nuncertainty associated with this approach that could easily\nhave been avoided if the two locations were coded separately\nin ATUS.\nDiscussion\nWe evaluated the cross-sectional ATUS data collected by the\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics for usefulness in time-series\nhuman exposure simulation models. It is the largest, and\nmost recent, survey of activity ever undertaken in the United\nTable 7.

The analysis is only approximate\ndue to differences in what is included as personal care in the\ntwo databases, and to important survey differences. For\nexample, ATUS data are more recent and entirely cross-\nsectional, whereas CHAD contains both cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal data. In addition, in some of the CHAD studies,\nsurvey respondents and study staff were in face-to-face\ncontact every day and to reduce embarrassment, respondents\nwere often told that they did not have to code PC activities at\nall. Even so, the number of PC minutes in CHAD is 556 min/\nday on average, only 3% lower than TEWHERE \u00bc \u00c01 min/\nday. The medians for both databases, while lower than the\nmean estimates, have the same 3% difference, which gives us\nsome confidence in being able to compare the two databases.\nTable 9 provides a breakdown of PC activities in CHAD\ndiaries. The first row provides descriptive information for\ntotal PC time by individuals 414-years old in CHAD. The\nsecond row provides PC information for all residential\nlocations, and while the descriptive statistics are similar, note\nthat no PC activities occurred in a residential location for 146\npeople (0.8%) in CHAD. For those with PC, some or all PC\nactivities occurred in someone else's residence for 507\nindividuals (2.8%). Note that the median for their PC\nactivities is 420 min/day, about 77% of the median total PC\ntime of 545 min/day. Non-residential PC time is significantly\nless, as expected, but is quite high for the upper tails of the\ndistribution. This type of finding is not uncommon for\nhuman activity data: a small proportion of the population\nhas quite different time use patterns than the majority. It is\noften the ``unusual'' group that is of interest from the\nexposure modeling perspective (Ott, 1982; Jordan et al.,\nThe TEWHERE \u00bc \u00c01 problem needs to be addressed,\nperhaps through imputation.

The issue of failing to distinguish between\nindoor and outdoor activities at home may be more difficult\nto address than the TEWHERE \u00bc \u00c01 problem. Perhaps the\nCHAD databaseFor parts of itFcould be used, despite the\nage of the data, in assessing distributions of PC and indoor/\noutdoor activities. Analyses to replace missing location/\nactivity data in ATUS would be a large, but likely\nworthwhile, effort due to the sheer amount of more recent\ntime use data available in ATUS.\nWe also developed insights into the 200 different activities\nincluded in ATUS. These activities are subdivided into three\nhierarchical Tiers that are conducive to analyzing population\nparticipation rates by age, gender, and year. We focused\nmostly on work-related travel in this paper as a concrete\nexample of what data are available in ATUS, but data on\ndaily participation in other activities having exposure\nimplications are also collected. One example is the time\nspent by individuals using tobacco and/or drugs (Code\nworking in the yard (020501), and so forth. Many of the Tier\n1 (major) activity codes have the same level of detail available\nas the travel activity example illustrates; see Table 2 for the\nnumber of Tier 3 subcodes available for Tier 2 categories.\nIn our analyses of work-related travel, we found that\nproblems exist from an exposure modeling perspective in how\nactivity is coded for a sample of 500 respondents having one\nor more TEWHERE \u00bc 2 locations (the respondent's work-\nplace); see Table 8. Only 52.2% of this sample had a clearly\nunderstandable work-related coding for exposure modeling,\nwith the remaining using inconsistent approaches for before/\nafter work-shift travel or within-shift travel. While we know\nfrom the ATUS data that the person is traveling, determining\nthat the travel is work-related for exposure modeling would\nrequire extensive coding review.\nany statistically significant trends over time in the work travel\nactivity codes, using unrevised ATUS categories, by age or\ntime frame, proportionately more males in all age categories\ntravel for work than females, and their time spent in travel is\nslightly longer.
