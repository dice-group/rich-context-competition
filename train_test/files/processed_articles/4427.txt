The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) was used to assess self-care\nbehaviours. EQ-5D-3L was used to quantify HRQoL.\nResults: Of self-care activities, individuals (n \u00bc 322) were most likely to adhere to treatment and\nleast likely to perform foot care. A total of 78.9% of participants did not examine their feet and\n33.9% of participants did not monitor blood glucose during the questionnaire period. Moderate/\nsevere anxiety or depression was reported by 28.6% of participants; 23.9% reported moderate/\nsevere pain or discomfort. The individual's level of diabetes education, insulin injection regimen and\nHbA1c were independently associated with total SDSCA score. Household income and age were\nindependently associated with EQ-5D index.\nConclusions: Enhancing diabetes education in individuals and implementing strict insulin regimens\ncould improve self-care behaviours in people with T1DM in China.\n",

Self-care is important to maintain\noptimal glycaemic control and prevent com-\nplications,7 including both microvascular\n(e.g. retinopathy and neuropathy) and\nmacrovascular complications (e.g. myocar-\ndial infarction, angina pectoris and stroke),\nwhich can negatively affect health-related\nquality-of-life (HRQoL)8,9 and have fatal\nconsequences.10 Self-care requires frequent\nmonitoring of blood glucose levels (at least\nthree times per day), monitoring and con-\ntrolling carbohydrate intake, frequent insu-\nlin administration (four injections per day or\ninfusion via pump), altering insulin dose to\nmatch diet and activity patterns, participat-\ning in moderate-intensity physical activity\nfor !150 min per week, and checking urine\nfor ketones when necessary.7\nLiving with T1DM affects the psycho-\nlogical and emotional wellbeing of affected\nindividuals and their families. HRQoL\nassesses the individual's perception of\nhealth and is a useful measure of overall\ndisease burden. It is a multidimensional\nconcept, comprising physical, emotional\nand social components.8 The most import-\nant outcome measure in T1DM may not be\nglycaemic control, but perceived HRQoL.11\nPeople with T1DM may have varying\nHRQoL burdens at different life stages,\nsuch as loss of Fexibility or overprotection\nin childhood, future worries and school\nwork in adolescence, and work, marriage\nand reproduction issues in adulthood. In\naddition, diabetes self-care behaviours is\nclosely associated with metabolic control,12\nbut it is unclear which behaviours have the\nmost influence over glycaemic control.\nUnderstanding the factors influencing self-\ncare behaviours and HRQoL will help\nhealthcare providers design interventions\nto improve the wellbeing of people with\nThe aim of the present study was to assess\nself-care behaviours and HRQoL of indi-\nviduals with T1DM who participated in the\n3C study at the Shantou Centre.2,3 It was\nhypothesized that these people were weak in\nsome aspects of self-care, that diabetes had a\nnegative effect on HRQoL, that self-care\nbehaviours and HRQoL varied between\npeople at different life stages, and that\nsome controllable influencing factors could\nbe identified that could guide clinical\nmanagement.\nParticipants and methods\nStudy population\nThe study was designed by the IDF2 and\nincluded primary (four in Beijing, two\nin Shantou), secondary (three in Beijing,\ntwo in Shantou), and tertiary (six in Beijing,\ntwo in Shantou) health care facilities with\nactive diabetes outpatient clinics and the\nwillingness and capacity to participate in the\nstudy. Study subjects were recruited sequen-\ntially from outpatient clinics and inpatient\nwards, or by invitation from a list of people\ndiagnosed with T1DM in a 3-year retro-\nspective record review. Participants or their\nparent(s) (if <15 years of age) underwent\nface-to-face, personal, interviews. People\naged <6 months at T1DM diagnosis were\nexcluded.\nThis analysis included people from health\ncare facilities in Shantou. Trained investiga-\ntors performed interviews during July/\n7 days. Venous blood samples were taken\nand tested for HbA1c at local hospital\nlaboratories using pressurized liquid\nchromatography. Detailed project design\nand implementation information was as\ndescribed.2\nThe study was approved by the Human\nEthics Committee of Shantou University\nMedical College, Shantou, China. All par-\nticipants provided written informed consent.\nSDSCA\nDiabetes self-care activities were assessed\nusing the Chinese version of the Summary of\nDiabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)\nquestionnaire, which has been showed to\nhave high reliability and validity.15 Scores\nwere calculated for six items: following a\nhealthy diet; physical activity; adherence to\nrecommended medications; self-monitoring\nof blood glucose; foot care; smoking. Using\na continuous scale ranging between 0 and 7,\nthe numerical scoring of items was based on\nthe number of days of the week that the\nbehaviour was performed; the mean of each\nitem score was determined to find an overall\nscore for each self-care activity. Since smok-\ning is uncommon in children and adoles-\ncents in China16 this parameter was not\nincluded in the present study.\nHealth-related quality-of-life was assessed\nusing EQ-5D-3L, a standardized scale used\nin a wide range of health conditions and\ntreatments as well as in the general popula-\ntion.17 Respondents classify their health\nstatus at three levels of severity (no, moder-\nate, or severe problems) in five dimensions\n(mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain/\ndiscomfort; anxiety/depression), resulting in\nscores that can be converted into a single\nindex value for health status (1 \u00bc full health;\n0 \u00bc dead). The index value was assigned\nusing a Japanese time trade-off value set,18\nsince no Chinese value set is available.\nParticipants also completed the EQ-VAS,\nwhich records self-rated health on a visual\nanalogue scale ranging between 100 (best\nimaginable health state) and 0 (worst\nimaginable health state).\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size of the 3C study was\ncalculated by the IDF, who determined\nthat a minimum of 320 participants were\nrequired at each study centre (Beijing and\nShantou).2\nData were presented as median (25th, 75th\nquartile), mean \u00c6 SD or n (%). Differences\nand associations between variables were ana-\nlysed by one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA), multiple ANOVA, 2-test or\nSpearman's product-moment correlation.\nReliability was assessed using Cronbach's a-\ncoefficient, and the coefficients of the SDSCA\n0.77, respectively. Multiple linear regression\nanalysis was used to identify factors associated\nwith total SDSCA score and EQ-5D index.\nIndependent variables included age, sex, dia-\nbetes duration, household income, residence,\npresence/absence of medical insurance,\nnumber of daily insulin injections, HbA1c\nlevel, presence/absence of group diabetes edu-\ncation, and presence/absence of individual\ndiabetes education. The signiEcant variables\nwere included in a forward stepwise approach.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values< 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nyears; age range 3\u00ad65 years).

Children and adolescents had\nsignificantly better HRQoL related to pain\nand discomfort than adults (P < 0.01 and\nP < 0.05, respectively), and children had sig-\nnificantly better HRQoL related to anxiety/\ndepression compared with both adolescents\nand adults (P < 0.05 for each comparison).\nMultiple regression analysis found that\nindividual diabetes education (P \u00bc 0.012),\ninsulin injection regimen (P \u00bc 0.001) and\nciated with total SDSCA score.

It is\npossible that participants may not have\nbeen aware of the need for foot care, due\nto the low rate of diabetes education in the\nstudy group (66.5% had received no dia-\nbetes education). In addition, cost is a\nsubstantial barrier to the use of blood\nglucose self-monitoring equipment in\nChina.3 Few people with diabetes are able\nto afford such equipment, and their blood\nglucose levels must be monitored in hospital.\nDiabetes had a significant impact on\nHRQoL. The proportion of participants in\nthe present study who reported moderate or\nsevere problems was significantly higher\nthan in the general population of China.21\nFigure 2.

SMBG, self-\nmonitoring of blood glucose.\nThis result was consistent with most stu-\nthe present study commonly reported prob-\nlems with pain/discomfort, in accordance\nOlder people with T1DM have been\nshown to have poorer self-care behaviours\nthan children with the condition, especially\nafter leaving home and becoming focused on\nstudy or work.28\u00ad30 There were no significant\ndifferences between age groups in self-care\nbehaviours in the present study, however,\nthis is probably due to the small numbers of\nchildren and adolescents in this cohort.\nOur finding that adults had significantly\nlower EQ-5D index than children and ado-\nlescents was consistent with other studies.31\nThis may be related to the presence of\ndiabetic complications, since nephropathy\nhas been shown to reduce HRQoL in people\nwith T1DM.8 In addition, adults reported\nsignificantly worse anxiety/depression com-\npared with younger people in the present\nstudy. Adults are generally independent in\nthis society and experience burdens in fac-\ntors including work, marriage, pregnancy or\nchildrearing. Adolescents and adults with\nT1DM have been shown to have a higher\nrate of depression and lower self-esteem\nthan children with the condition.6,32\nEducation is important in the self-care of\npeople with T1DM.6 It is of interest that\nindividual diabetes education had a substan-\ntial effect on total SDSCA score in the\npresent study, but group education did not.\nIt is possible that group education may\ngenerate resistance and could ignore what\nis most important to people with T1DM. In\ncontrast, individualized diabetes education\nemphasizes the importance of increasing\npatient autonomy and independency,\nwhich help people with T1DM to discover\nand develop their inherent capacity to be\nresponsible for themselves.33 Family behav-\nioural interventions are known to be more\neffective than conventional education pro-\ngrammes in influencing self-care behaviours\nThe type of insulin injection regimen also\nhad a major impact on self-care behaviours\nin the present study. People with an insulin\npump or basal-bolus insulin regimen with\nfour injections per day must self monitor\nglucose levels frequently and receive more\ndiabetes education compared with other\npeople with T1DM. Studies have indicated\nFigure 4. Percentage of people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Shantou, China, reporting no problem in\ncategories of the EQ-5D17 health-related quality-of-life scale. People stratified according to age (children aged\nthat both individual and group lifestyle\ninterventions have positive effects on diet\nand self-care behaviours in people with\ndiabetes, with group settings being most\neffective.35 Integrating education and other\ntherapies, such as intensiEed insulin regi-\nmens, is an approach that is likely to achieve\nthe most effective diabetes control.36\nSelf-care activity score was independently\nrelated to HbA1c level in the present study.\nGuidelines emphasize that effective self-care\nis an essential component of metabolic\ncontrol.6 All self-care behaviours were\nequally important, but self-monitoring of\nblood glucose was most effective at influen-\ncing the individual's HbA1c level in our\nstudy. Frequent and accurate blood glucose\nmonitoring, and concomitant optimal\nadjustment of insulin to carbohydrate\nintake and exercise, are required to attain\n(and maintain) ideal glycaemic control.37,38\nThe frequency of self-monitoring is asso-\none of the least frequently performed self-\ncare behaviours in the present study.\nIncome and age were independent pre-\ndictors of HRQoL in the present study. Poor\nHRQoL causes suffering, can seriously\ninterfere with daily diabetes self-manage-\nment, and is associated with poor medical\noutcomes and high costs.41 Improvement in\nquality of care (determined by care practices\nthat improve outcomes) will decrease the\noverall lifetime cost of diabetes and normal-\nize life expectancy, by decreasing acute and\nchronic complications. More importantly,\nimproving outcomes will improve HRQoL\nfor both people with T1DM and their\nfamilies. In people with T1DM in the\nUSA, HRQoL was associated with a pri-\nmary insurance source of Medicaid or\nanother government-funded insurance\nscheme.42 We suggest that the Chinese gov-\nernment increases medical investment, sub-\nsidizes health insurance and reduces medical\ncare costs as soon as possible, in order to\nimprove HRQoL in people with T1DM.\nThis study is limited by the fact that\nparticipants were recruited using conveni-\nence sampling from six hospitals in Shantou,\npossibly affecting the generalizability of\nresults. Further studies should include\nlarger, more diverse populations.\nIn conclusion, the majority of people with\nT1DM in this region of China exhibit poor\nself-care behaviours and HRQoL. Self-care\nbehaviours could be improved by enhancing\nindividual diabetes education and imple-\nmenting strict insulin regimens. Increasing\nthe frequency of self-monitoring of blood\nglucose may improve metabolic control.\n"
