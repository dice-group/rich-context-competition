Unrelieved pain results in decreased phys-\nical function, longer hospital stays, and increased rates of re-hospitalization and outpatient vis-\nits[3], leading to lost employment, income, and insurance coverage. Although measurement\ntools exist to enable physician-patient communication regarding specific components of pain\n(e.g., frequency and severity)[4, 5], there is a need to assess the reliability of existing, brief mea-\nsurement tools such as the Short-Form Global Pain Scale (SF-GPS), which incorporate quality\nof life factors often impacted by the presence of chronic pain[6].\nPeople with some pain conditions have increased risk for comorbid pain disorders [7], which\nmay add complexity to pain management plans. Current treatment methods for pain are largely\ninadequate, and non-opioid medications such as Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs\n(NSAIDs) carry side effects for as many as 25% of long-term users[8]. In addition to the potential\nharm induced by NSAIDs and other non-opioids, a worrisome trend of increased prescription\nand utilization of opioid treatment for chronic nonmalignant pain has emerged over the past\ndecade[9], despite accompanying physical and psychological dependence. Further, age-adjusted\ndeaths involving opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999[10]. In particular, West Virgin-\ntively), and was more than double the national rate, which has also been rising over time (2010\nstresses the importance of increased research regarding the translation of effective treatments for\nchronic pain into practice[3], and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nmaster list) may be made available to qualified\nresearchers, upon request.

Thus, the potential of non-pharmaco-\nlogical therapies for chronic pain management has garnered recent research interest[14\u00ad16].\nPain-related disorders are the most commonly reported conditions for which patients use\nComplementary Health Approaches (CHAs)[17\u00ad19]; these include natural products (e.g., vita-\nmins, herbs, probiotics, etc.) and Mind-body practices (e.g., yoga, meditation, etc.), as well as\nNaturopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and others. Although their use is considered some-\nwhat controversial, at least 30% of the U.S. population uses CHAs[20]. Further, most people use\nCHAs with conventional treatments[21\u00ad23]. The most comprehensive economic review to date\n(N = 28 trials) concluded that substituting a CHA in place of usual care had better health out-\ncomes and lower costs than usual care alone for a variety of chronic health conditions[24]. How-\never, studies regarding patterns and correlates of CHA use in chronic pain populations remain\nrelatively few, as does research regarding the overlap of CHA use and/or conventional treatments\namong those with pain conditions[25]. Further, little is known regarding the relation of specific\ndemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors to CHAs used specifically for pain; epidemio-\nlogic research is particularly sparse in Appalachian and other underserved communities. Many\nof these communities have the highest rates of pain conditions in the nation, including arthritis\n[26], yet have a rich anecdotal history of using natural products for pain management[27\u00ad30].\nNumerous measurement tools have been developed to collect information regarding popula-\ntion-level CHA use in the U.S.[31\u00ad44]. However, only two have assessed CHAs used specifically\nfor pain; of these resource-intensive telephone-based surveys, one lacked the identification of dif-\nferent CHA categories in item design[40], while another lacked temporal specification [39]. Fur-\nther, no measurement tools have assessed short- and long-term concurrent use of CHAs, which is\nan important consideration due to the heterogeneity of potential effects for individual approaches\namong those with one or more pain conditions. Existing, available tools measure use of CHAs,\nincluding intake of dietary supplements alone[45\u00ad50], and those using a variety of CHAs for any\n44], and at any point in an individual's lifetime[33, 34, 36]. Though otherwise helpful, these assess-\nments do little to provide differentiation between pain-related and non-pain use; attributing the\noverall use of CHAs to those with diagnosed pain conditions alone likely results in the misclassifi-\ncation of outcomes, resulting in biased estimates regarding the prevalence of CHAs used specifi-\ncally for pain and related symptoms. In addition, participant use of CHAs for specific health\nconditions is captured by the largest ongoing national survey [33, 34]. However, participants may\nperhaps be less likely to report their CHA use for one or more specific complex pain conditions\nand more likely to report only for associated individual symptoms. The resulting variability to\npain-specific prevalence estimates, coupled with a lack of short and self-administered tools to\nassess CHA use specifically for pain rather than by disease or overall use, indicates a gap in our\nknowledge regarding CHA use for pain. Because the utilization of CHAs for pain may be associ-\nated with potential behavior change regarding the use of opioids, a short measurement tool which\nutilizes a behavioral theoretical underpinning and assesses distinct stages of behavior change\nregarding CHAs used specifically for pain is warranted.\nThe Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is a behavioral theory which proposes that changes in a\nhealth behavior consist of movements between sequences of discrete, qualitatively distinct\nstages, characterized by distinct mindsets. Stage progression of behavior change occurs through\n6 separate `Stages of Change,' for which specific social-cognitive factors influence stage progres-\nsion[51]: Precontemplation (a person has no intention to change a health behavior), Contempla-\ntion (they begin to consider changing a health behavior), Preparation (they intend to change\nthis behavior), Action (initiation of the new health behavior), Maintenance (execution of the\nhealth behavior, sometimes for more than 6 months)[52], and the recently added Termination\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\n(desired health behavior complete)[53]. The `Stage of Change' construct is central to the TTM\n[54], and has demonstrated success in cross-sectional research on diet[55, 56], the use of health\ncare proxies[57], exercise in pain patients[58], physical activity/body satisfaction[59], and can-\ncer prevention behaviors[60]. The Stages of Change serves as an ideal framework to consider as\ndevelopment guidance for the measurement of CHAs used for pain, since differing stage status\nmay indicate varying levels of influence on conventional treatment and may also reflect differ-\nent risks to patient safety. Differing stage status, which may be obtained by asking participants\nabout health behaviors by differing lengths of time (each corresponding to a specific stage), may\naid in understanding distinctions between short- and long-term use of CHAs for pain, an area\nwhich has been largely unexplored.\nInformation on patient CHA use is not routinely or systematically collected in the clinic set-\nting [61, 62], and patients often do not disclose concurrent use of CHAs to their physicians[63,\n64], although such CHA use may influence conventional treatments and pose risks to patient\nsafety [65]. Thus, adverse events may be under-reported to relevant databases (i.e., the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System). Alternatively, the potential\ntherapeutic benefits of short- or long-term use of certain CHAs as primary or adjunctive treat-\nments for pain management may remain largely unrecognized. Thus, improved understanding\nregarding not only the patterns of CHA use in patients with chronic pain, but the risks and\nbenefits associated both with short- and long-term CHA use and with concurrent use of spe-\ncific CHAs and medications is clearly needed. An easy to use, validated instrument that cap-\ntures key information on patient CHA use, which can be readily administered by health care\nstaff in a clinical setting, would provide an effective way to address the challenges of patient\nnon-disclosure [66\u00ad77] and aid physicians in better assessing the risks and benefits of CHA\nuse in patients with chronic pain. A validated instrument capturing short- and long-term\nCHA use would improve understanding and therapeutic potential in this population, and ulti-\nmately, help reduce risk for adverse events and optimize pain management. Due in part to its\ndemonstrated success measuring changes in various health behaviors, the TTM Stages of\nchange serves as an ideal underlying theoretical framework to gauge the prevalence and pat-\nterns of short- and long-term CHA use for pain management, and perhaps further assess the\n\"readiness\" or receptivity of a patient with respect to non-pharmacologic therapies for pain\nmanagement.\nThe overall aim of this study was to create and validate the first systematically-designed\ninstrument to assess sociodemographic and health factors by CHA use for pain. This aim was\nachieved by accomplishing the following objectives:\n1. Design a new measurement tool to capture short- and long-term use of CHAs used specifi-\ncally for pain among adult patients seeking conventional care for pain management;\n2. Assess face validity of this tool among content experts and stakeholders, followed by pre-test-\ning and implementation of survey in an Appalachian population experiencing pain; and,\n3. Implement and assess reliability of the SF-GPS and the CHAs by TTM stage.\nMaterials and methods\nScope of Project\nThis cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June 2014 through March 2016 in a sam-\nple of 301 English-speaking adult (!18 years) patients in four Northern WV pain and rheuma-\ntology clinics (Fig 1). We conducted primary data collection using a new measurement tool, the\nComplementary Health Approaches for Pain Survey (CHAPS) (S1 Appendix; CHAPS dataset\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nand codebook are freely available as S1 Dataset and S1 Codebook), and included use of the\nSF-GPS[6] to measure pain severity and related characteristics. The CHAPS was implemented\nusing consecutive sampling (response rate across 343 patients in all clinics = 88.0%) to investi-\ngate the associations between a variety of demographic, lifestyle, and health factors with 12 sepa-\nrate CHAs for pain management in a population seeking conventional care for pain. This study\nvey development and content, study population, and survey administration are below.\nFig 1. The study flow chart.\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nMeasurement tool\nUnderpinning: Transtheoretical Model. Patient engagement of CHA use may be consid-\nered as a health behavior [78]. Thus, we employed the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) as a\nguide for survey development with regard to CHA-specific questions. As far as we know, the\nTTM Stages of Change have not yet been applied to measure the health behavior of CHA use.\nBecause chronic pain is defined as pain lasting from 3\u00ad6 months [1], and many CHAs likely\nhave long-term rather than short-term (e.g., two weeks) effects [79], a 6-month cutoff was\nestablished as an appropriate collective short-term and long-term cutoff which could be used\nfor each separate approach. Further, the 6-month cutoff has been used in previous TTM-based\nsurvey development for other health behaviors as described [55\u00ad60].\nWe adapted each stage to represent differing lengths of time participants used each CHA\n[54, 80] for pain based on previous literature[81]: \"I do not know what this is;\" \"No, and I do\nnot intend to within 6 months (Precontemplation);\" \"No, but I intend to within 6 months\n(Contemplation);\" \"No, but I intend to within 30 days (Preparation);\" \"Yes, and I have for less\nthan 6 months (Action; i.e., short-term CHA use);\" and, \"Yes, I have for more than 6 months\n(Maintenance; i.e., long-term CHA use).\" Additionally, researchers have indicated projects\napplying the TTM should include investigation of problem severity[80]; our approach to mea-\nsuring problem severity of pain was through the administration of the SF-GPS[6] alongside\nour TTM-based CHA tool. Ideally, the CHAPS was designed to accompany a variety of pain\nmeasurement tools, since their use is not uniform in practice across disciplines.\nSurvey Development. Initial development of the CHAPS incorporated input from a panel,\nincluding: CHA researchers, survey methodologists, a clinical therapist specializing in opioid-\ndependence, a psychologist, and members of the WV population. The CHAPS included 2\nclosed-ended items regarding past and present chronic pain, with an accompanying definition\nas any pain lasting more than 12 weeks; demographics and lifestyle questions (10 and 6 items,\nrespectively); previous diagnosis of 24 health conditions (including nine known to cause pain)\nand other health factors (3 items); 12 separate CHAs using the TTM underpinning as described,\nand, open-ended questions regarding specific herbs and other CHAs we may have inadvertently\nomitted (2 items). Our list of CHAs was derived by visually scanning the National Institutes of\nHealth National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NIH NCCIH) website[82]\nand existing cross-sectional surveys on overall CHA use [31\u00ad44] to create a master list of rele-\nvant terms, followed by the elimination of CHAs we believed would not be accessible in some\nrural settings (i.e. Ayurvedic treatments, Naturopathy) or those which may be easily misinter-\npreted (i.e., inclusion of a commercial caloric restriction program such as Weight Watchers1\nas `special diets'). Previous psychometric testing of NHIS CHA categories in a national sample\nusing CHAs determined that overlap of individual approaches into broader categories (i.e.,\nMind-body) was present[83]; when further considering our list was already limited to individ-\nual approaches for which accessibility was likely to be an issue, we concluded that we would not\ncreate broader definitions for separate group classifications. We inquired about natural prod-\nucts `Herbs/Botanicals' (also using a definition from the NIH NCCIH), `Vitamins/minerals,'\n`Probiotics,' and `Other Natural products,' as well as `Acupuncture,' `Massage therapy,' `Spinal\nmanipulation/Chiropractic,' `Tai Chi/Qi Gong,' `Yoga,' `Meditation,' `Other relaxation prac-\ntices,' and `Movement therapies.' Accompanying examples (e.g., \"Herbs. . .such as Echinacea,\nBlack Cohosh, etc.\") were also included to minimize potential misclassification and ensure the\nincorporation of many self-administered and all core practitioner-based CAM therapies recom-\nmended for inclusion by the Members of the International Society for Complementary Medi-\ncine Research[84]. We did not incorporate specific questions about marijuana use due to\nsensitivity concerns. For conciseness, we did not ask about energy healing or specific religious\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\npractices, for which a wide variety of types exist. Twelve optional, nested questions regarding\nperceived efficacy of CHAs were also included.\nData Collection Protocol. CHAPS data collection protocols were standardized before\nimplementation, and team members were given opportunities to practice engaging in dialogue\nbefore approaching patients. A cover page was attached to every survey, indicating the intent\nof the research study and ensuring anonymity; return of the survey served as implied informed\nconsent. The CHAPS was designed to be a ninth grade reading level or below according to the\nAutomated Readability Index[85], and require no more than 15 minutes to complete. Study\npersonnel observed the timing of !75% administered surveys; the average time for survey\ncompletion of CHAPS and the SF-GPS among clinic patients was approximately 12 minutes.\nThis was shorter than our anticipated response time, which may have been attributed to the\nrecurring item format and underutilization of optional efficacy questions within the\nquestionnaire.\nMeasurement of Pain. The SF-GPS was developed from the previously-validated Global\nPain Scale (GPS) by its original authors[6] to meet the need for a simplified instrument for use\nby clinicians and researchers, while incorporating key elements of many existing pain assess-\nments; these scales were created to capture the multidimensional effects of pain. The original\n33-item GPS and 20-item SF-GPS[86] use a variation of the Visual Analog Scale; numbers\n0\u00ad10 are spaced equidistant from one another on a horizontal line, both ends are defined as\nthe extreme limits of the parameter (pain severity, etc.), and orientation is from the left (best)\nto the right (worst), indicating the impact each measure has had in a participant's life. The\nSF-GPS contains 5 items each on pain (`No Pain' = 0 to `Extreme Pain' = 10 for each: Current\npain; best, worst, and average pain in past week; and, average pain in past 3 months), feelings\nin past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly Agree' = 10 for each: Afraid, depressed, tired,\nanxious, and stressed), clinical outcomes in past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly\nAgree' = 10 for each: Trouble sleeping, trouble feeling comfortable, was less independent, was\nunable to work, and needed to take more medication), and inability to engage in activities dur-\ning past week (`Strongly Disagree' = 0 to `Strongly Agree' = 10 for each: Go to store, do chores\nat home, enjoy friends and family, exercise (including walking), and participate in favorite\nhobbies). In a population of adults with chronic pain, the GPS demonstrated high internal reli-\nability (alpha = .89), appropriate factor loadings within subscales (>.40), and moderate-strong\ncorrelation with similar subscales of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (GPS Pain\nsubscale with `Present Pain Intensity' = .65), the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain\nInventory (GPS Pain subscale with `Pain Severity' = .79 and `Interference' = .54; GPS Emotions\nsubscale with `Negative Mood' = .67 and `Self Control' = -.53; GPS Clinical Outcomes subscale\nwith `Pain severity' = .41), and the Perceived Stress Scale (GPS Emotions subscale = .62)[6].\nThe SF-GPS is freely available and has been described in greater detail elsewhere[6].\nSurvey implementation\nPilot testing period. After obtaining provider permission and obtaining exemption status\nfrom the West Virginia University IRB, we piloted the survey in a convenience sample of pain\npatents attending the WVU Medicine Pain clinic in Morgantown, WV (June 2014 through\nMarch 2015). We placed a stack of surveys, pens, and a survey drop box in the waiting room;\nduring the following 9 months, we visited every 2\u00ad3 weeks to collect surveys, and ensure sur-\nveys and pens were replenished. A total of 66 patients completed surveys during this period,\nincluding 28 during one in-person visit, where we solicited patient participation in the survey.\nThis preliminary version of the CHAPS was also pilot-tested in 11 patients by two investiga-\ntors to assess comprehension and quality, including clarity and recall[87]. Items and survey\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nformatting were evaluated during a 5-minute interview using nine pre-determined questions\npertaining to five fundamental components of the effectiveness of a survey[88]. These incl-\nuded: 1) attractiveness, 2) comprehension, 3) acceptability, 4) self-involvement, and 5) persua-\nsion (Table 1). Based on responses and other feedback, and after learning more about the\npatient experience through a 20-hour clinical immersion (accompanying a lead physician in\npatient rooms at the WVU Medicine Pain clinic), we made minor formatting changes to the\nCHAPS to improve clarity, and included (each) an additional question about prescription\ndrug use, medical diagnoses we may have overlooked, perceived CHA efficacy, and military\nstatus. We then piloted this final survey version (described below) in 11 additional patients at\nthe same clinic location.\nFinal Version. Panel members who provided initial input regarding CHAPS development\nwere re-approached to assess face validity of the final survey version. The final CHAPS survey\ncomprised 69 self-report items and used an easily-identifiable response pattern. Commensu-\nrate to the preliminary version, items included demographic, lifestyle, and health factors (10, 6,\nand 25-items, respectively) and questions regarding CHAs used for pain; the latter were struc-\ntured in a manner consistent with surveys utilizing a Stages of Change approach[55, 57\u00ad59,\n81]. Additionally, the CHAPS incorporated 4 open-ended questions regarding additional\nCHA use, diagnoses, and prescriptions used for pain. The final survey version was\nTable 1.

With the addition of the 20-item SF-GPS[6], sur-\nvey administration required 10\u00ad12 minutes.\nTarget study population and identification of sampling locations. Site selection is\ndescribed in Fig 1. Our target study population was comprised of adult patients seeking con-\nventional care for pain, and attending WV pain management or rheumatology clinics within a\n100-mile radius of Morgantown, WV. Rheumatology clinics were selected for inclusion due to\ntheir high prevalence of patients with chronic pain[89]. Pain and rheumatology clinics were\nidentified by conducting internet searches for physicians within 100 miles of the CHAPS office\n(May through July 2015). Due to rurality and limited resources, it would not have been feasible\nto stratify sampling of clinics from specific areas in WV.\nOf the 15 and 91 rheumatology and pain management practices identified, respectively, non-\npain specializing physicians were excluded, as were multidisciplinary practices including special-\nties other than pain or rheumatology; also excluded were opthamologists, podiatrists, neurosur-\ngeons, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and weight centers, leaving 9 and 30 eligible rheumatology\nand pain clinics, respectively. After exclusion of duplicates, we engaged clinic managers or lead\nphysicians from each clinic in an effort to describe the study, secure permission to visit, and\nadminister the survey to patients in waiting rooms. A total of 4 eligible clinics (1 rheumatology\nand 3 pain management) located in 4 West Virginia counties agreed to participate. Managers\nfrom each participating clinic signed a consent form which briefly described the study purpose,\nstated study investigators would neither disrupt clinic practice nor provide any medical advice,\nCHAPS study coordinator. Our resources allowed for 24 total clinic visits throughout the study.\nClinic visits. Our presence was not advertised in clinics. All surveys were self-adminis-\ntered with the exception of 14 (4.7%), which were completed by a proxy; we also assisted with\npersonal interview format requests (n = 6, 2.0%). Upon return, each survey was stored in a\nlocked filing cabinet in our research coordinator's office. During all phases of data collection,\nwe also engaged with clinic administrative staff, ensuring they were familiar with our study\nobjectives; this facilitated return of surveys taken back into the patient rooms.\nStatistical analysis\nFeedback from nine pre-determined questions relating to quality/comprehension of both survey\nversions was elicited, and Fisher's chi-square tests were used to examine differences in responses\nacross versions and clinic location. We did not conduct internal reliability or factor analysis for\nall the Stages of Change-based CHA items combined due to inherently distinct differences bet-\nween stages[81]. However, we were able to use Cronbach's alpha to establish internal reliability\non each Stage of Change subscale, each with 12 CHA items, for whether a participant was in that\nparticular Stage of Change (coded yes/no). Cronbach's alpha was also used to establish the inter-\nnal reliability of the total SF-GPS, in addition to each 5-item subscale Pain, Clinical outcomes,\nActivities, and Feelings as described above.\nIn order to assess if our tool was appropriately written to discourage systematic item-miss-\ning patterns, we examined the final dataset for missing data patterns (PROC MI; SAS 9.4,\nCary, NC) using the missing data indicator matrix for missing data patterns[90, 91]; We did\nthis in order to examine the most- to least-common missing data patterns by item for patterns\nconsistent with non-response, sensitive item(s), and attrition. Consistent missing data patterns\nwould indicate a missing data mechanism such as missing not at random (MNAR) data, which\nwould indicate multiple imputation (MI) to be inappropriate for recovering missing informa-\ntion. Missing data indicators were also examined in conjunction with present demographic\ndata, again to assist in determining presence of MNAR data. Once we determined the presence\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nof missing at random or completely at random data instead of MNAR data, we conducted sen-\nsitivity analyses in order to determine whether there were differences in data with MI in the\nrelationships between all sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors with CHA use using\nlogistic and linear regression using PROC MI ANALYZE.\nResults\nResponse rates were high (88% \u00b1 4.1%) ranging from 84 to 94% in the four sites sampled. Spe-\ncific reasons for refusal included reluctance to fill out paperwork (18.8%), hand pain (12.5%),\nOverall, quality/comprehension of both survey versions was strong (Table 1). The only\nchanges which occurred between versions were simple font format changes (i.e., darker, bolder\nprint) to ensure readability, and the addition of new questions to capture information we\nbelieved we initially overlooked (Veteran status, etc.); there were no changes to the content or\nwording of questions themselves. Further, there were no differences in overall CHA use by sur-\nvey version, (pilot) test sample, or clinic location (Fisher's p's > .05). Based upon the positive\nfeedback from our subsamples, and the vast similarity of preliminary and final CHAPS ver-\nsions on all other factors assessed in the survey (i.e., age, sex, race, etc.; p's ! .05), data were\npooled for analysis.\nQualitative data\nScale development and assumptions. Despite our high response rates, some items had\nrelatively high rates of missing data, including herbal use (18.3%), BMI (11.6%), alcohol (11%),\nand income (12.3%). However, there were no consistent visual subgroup patterns of missing\ndata, suggesting missing data were likely missing at random or missing completely at random.\nFurther sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of missing data on the rela-\ntionships of many potential correlates with CHA use for pain; we compared estimates using\nnon-imputed data with multiple imputed data using the Fully Conditional Specification\nmethod[92]; estimates were unchanged (not shown), further demonstrating that no factors\nassessed in the survey were associated with systematic missing data, thus suggesting the appro-\npriateness of MI.\nResults indicated very high internal consistency for the SF-GPS[6] (Cronbach's alpha over-\nall = .93); the internal reliability of each (5-question) subscale was also high (Cronbach's alpha\nfor the Pain subscale = .89; Feelings subscale = .87; Clinical Outcomes subscale = .83; Activities\nsubscale = .91). There was satisfactory internal reliability for each of the five TTM stages for all\n(twelve) combined CHA measurements: precontemplation (0.89), contemplation (0.72), prep-\nDescriptive statistics\nSample Characteristics are displayed in Tables 2, 3 and 4.

Additionally, 44% used\nopioids and 31% used other prescription medications (Table 3), while 66% used at least one\nCHA for pain, with 48% using at least one CHA for greater than 6 months (Table 4).

However, the majority of those\nindicating concern were willing to complete our survey after we told them they could continue\ncompletion in patient rooms, if that was their preference. Although we made every effort to\navoid sampling from the same patient population, 4/347 patients approached stated they had\ncompleted the survey previously.\nDiscussion\nAlthough overall CHA use has been examined in a variety of populations[93\u00ad101], the CHAPS\nis the first concise measurement tool designed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of\nCHA use specifically for pain, by length of use. The CHAPS is flexible in that it may be used\nalongside different pain measurement tools by clinicians and researchers, in addition to other\ntools designed to measure patient expectations of CHAs[102]. Individual patient pain out-\ncomes vary greatly, propelling efforts toward precision medicine[103]; the CHAPS may serve\nas a time-saving approach to assess patient CHA use for pain. This may be of particular interest\nfor clinicians possessing openness in identifying individual patient response for non-pharma-\ncological approaches as adjuncts to conventional pain management strategies, as the limited\nevidence base for these approaches is mostly positive but remains inconclusive[79]. Further,\nclinicians unfamiliar with several types of CHAs may particularly benefit from use of the\nCHAPS, since information regarding (evidence-based) CHA practices are not consistently\nintegrated into medical school curricula despite their wide use by a variety of patient popula-\ntions[104, 105]. For example, nearly half of our rural sample were long-term users of CHAs\nspecifically for pain.\nFindings of this pilot study suggest that the CHAPS was readily understandable, acceptable,\nand feasible to implement in chronic pain patients in WV, and that the SF-GPS, a measure-\nment tool designed to capture the multidimensional experience of pain, was reliable for gaug-\ning the impact of pain. The GPS, from which the SF-GPS originated, is a valid measurement\ntool with high internal reliability; interestingly, reliability coefficients for the SF-GPS in the\ncurrent study were higher than those previously reported in a sample of college students[6],\nperhaps reflecting in part differences in population characteristics. In addition, we only\nassessed approaches believed available in Appalachian rural settings. However, future use of\nthe CHAPS may benefit from the addition or substitution of other CHAs available in different\nsettings.\nAlthough selection bias due to non-response is possible, our use of consecutive sampling,\ncoupled with the high survey response rates, render non-response bias less likely. As in many\nstudies using self-report data, there is also a possibility of recall bias. Researchers wishing to\nimplement the CHAPS or similar surveys should explore barriers to survey implementation\npresent at specific clinics, partially by considering attitudes of the clinic staff and working\ntogether to facilitate involvement, as well as considering the available physical space.\nConclusions\nThe CHAPS is the first measurement tool to assess correlates of CHA use specifically for pain,\nand was successfully pilot-tested and implemented in a population with pain. The CHAPS\nincluded comprehensive information on a range of factors and constructs, yet required only\n12 minutes to complete, and may thus be appropriate for use in future population- and clinic-\nbased survey studies assessing CHA use in patients with chronic pain. Robust survey response\nrates and high face validity further support use of the CHAPS as a measurement tool in rural\npopulations with chronic pain.\nComplementary health approaches for pain in a rural patient population\nSupporting information\nS1 Appendix.
