    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, particularly among minorities, and if\nimproperly managed can lead to medical complications and death. Healthcare providers play vital roles in\ncommunicating standards of care, which include guidance on diabetes self-management. The background of the\nclient may play a role in the patient-provider communication process. The aim of this study was to determine the\nassociation between medical advice and diabetes self care management behaviors for a nationally representative\nsample of adults with diabetes. Moreover, we sought to establish whether or not race/ethnicity was a modifier for\nreported medical advice received and diabetes self-management behaviors.\nMethods: We analyzed data from 654 adults aged 21 years and over with diagnosed diabetes [130 Mexican-\nAmericans; 224 Black non-Hispanics; and, 300 White non-Hispanics] and an additional 161 with `undiagnosed\nExamination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether medical\nadvice to engage in particular self-management behaviors (reduce fat or calories, increase physical activity or\nexercise, and control or lose weight) predicted actually engaging in the particular behavior and whether the\nimpact of medical advice on engaging in the behavior differed by race/ethnicity. Additional analyses examined\nwhether these relationships were maintained when other factors potentially related to engaging in diabetes self\nmanagement such as participants' diabetes education, sociodemographics and physical characteristics were\ncontrolled. Sample weights were used to account for the complex sample design.\nResults: Although medical advice to the patient is considered a standard of care for diabetes, approximately one-\nthird of the sample reported not receiving dietary, weight management, or physical activity self-management\nadvice. Participants who reported being given medical advice for each specific diabetes self-management\nbehaviors were 4-8 times more likely to report performing the corresponding behaviors, independent of race.\nThese results supported the ecological model with certain caveats.\nConclusions: Providing standard medical advice appears to lead to diabetes self-management behaviors as\nreported by adults across the United States. Moreover, it does not appear that race/ethnicity influenced reporting\nperformance of the standard diabetes self-management behavior. Longitudinal studies evaluating patient-provider\ncommunication, medical advice and diabetes self-management behaviors are needed to clarify our findings.\n",

Mexican Americans have\nthe highest rate of diabetes among Hispanics and are 1.7\ntimes more likely to have diabetes as White non-Hispa-\nnics [1] and their age-adjusted diabetes death rate was\n1.5 greater than White non-Hispanics [4]. African Ameri-\ncans are 2.1 times more likely to be diagnosed with dia-\nbetes than White non-Hispanics [1] and their age-\nadjusted death rate from diabetes was nearly twice that of\nDue to the many health consequences of diabetes and\nthe nature of the disease, diabetes care is vital to quality\nof life and survival. Diabetes is a disease that can be man-\naged by the individual with appropriate guidance. Yet\nfewer than 60% of all adults age 40 and over with diag-\nnosed diabetes have their blood glucose, cholesterol, or\nblood pressure within the recommended levels for ade-\nquate control [5]. According to the American Diabetes\nAssociation's (ADA) Standards of Medical Care [6] an\noperational definition of high quality health care for per-\nsons with diabetes would include guidance on risk factor\ncontrol for all of the following: 1) dietary intake and\nweight management; 2) glycemic and lipid control; and\n3) foot and eye care.\nThe ecological model (Figure 1) was used in this study\nas a framework for the concepts applied to DSM out-\ncomes [7]. Medical advice, diabetes education, and the\npatient's race and cultural environment influence their\nbehaviors and consequently their health outcomes. Dia-\nbetes care is largely the responsibility of the individual;\nhowever, healthcare professionals can play vital roles in\nthe patient's skill development through effective patient-\nprovider communication with respect to collaborative\ngoal setting and individual assessment [8,9].\nMethods\nData collection\nAll data used for this study were openly, publically avail-\nable [10]. Raw data were extracted from datasets from\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,\ntained data for 10,149 individuals of all ages. Data were\nusing a complex, multistage, probability sample design.\nThe data from NHANES consist of 2-year representative\nsamples of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S.\npopulation. All participants read, understand and sign\ninformed consent forms based on the approved study\nprotocol from the National Center for Health Statistics\nResearch Ethics Review Board [10]. The study was lim-\nited to male and female adults ages  21 years who pro-\nvided self-report diagnosis of diabetes or who had\nhemoglobin A1c\n(A1C)  6.5, underwent an examination\nat the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), and belonged\nto one of the following race/ethnicity classifications:\nBlack non-Hispanics (BNH), Mexican American (MA),\nand White non-Hispanics (WNH). Of the total sample\npersons classified as \"other\". From the combined sample,\nwho responded to the screening question for diabetes\ndiagnosis. The categories for \"other Hispanics\" and\n\"other races\" were 10.8% and 2.7%, respectively and did\nnot have a sufficient sample sizes for comparative ana-\nlyses. Approximately 2% (n = 14) of the subjects were\nminors (< 18 years). The final sample size of participants\nwho met the inclusion criteria for the main study ques-\nThere were n = 161 classified as `undiagnosed diabetes'.\nThe final sample size, including individuals with `undiag-\nDefinitions\nDiagnosed diabetes\nSeveral questions were considered for the construction\nof the variable `diagnosed diabetes': 1) \"The next ques-\ntions are about specific medical conditions. Other than\nduring preganncy, have you ever been told by a doctor\nor health professional that you had diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes?\"; 2) \"How old were you when a doctor or\nother health professional first told you that you had dia-\nbetes or sugar diabetes?\"; and 3) \"When was your dia-\nbetes diagnosed?\"\nEach question was by self-report and subject to recall-\nbias. Since there were missing values for questions 2\nand 3, construction of the variable, `diagnosed diabetes'\nwas based on question 1.\nUndiagnosed diabetes\nBoth fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1C\n(A1C) were initially considered for construction of the\n`undiagnosed diabetes' variable. The latter was chosen,\nsince there were approximately twice as many missing\nvalues for FBG as compared to A1C. The inclusion cri-\nteria were the same as for `diagnosed diabetes' with the\nexception that both conditions were met: 1) `no self-\nreport of being diagnosed with diabetes'; and, 2) percent\nEcological model\nThe ecological model suggests that changes in knowledge,\nskills and attitudes will change behaviors and consequently\nhealth outcomes. Behaviors that are hypothesized to\nimpact DSM health outcomes were measured in the\nNHANES [10] and in the applied DSM model using the\n`current behaviors' (dietary plans, weight management,\nand physical activity changes). Patient provider communi-\ncation is an assumption of the model and it was not mea-\nsured in this study.\nMeasurements using the ecological model\nIndependent variables\nMedical advice (on diet, weight management and physical\nactivity and `told by a doctor or health provider in the past\n12 months'), fits into the ecological model as an environ-\nmental influence which acts on the individual and helps to\npromote health behavior change. Influences were measured\nin NHANES [10] and in the applied model (Figure 1) using\n1) `medical advice' (reduction of fat or calories, control or\nloss of weight, increased physical activity or exercise); 2)\n`diabetes education' (enhancing skills related to self-care);\nand, 3) `race/ethnicity' (culture/health disparities). The\nNHANES database [10] measures reported `medical advice'\nwithout making a distinction among the healthcare provi-\nder (the response choice for these questions were `told by a\ndoctor or health provider'). The response for diabetes edu-\ncation was `When was the last time you saw a diabetes\nnurse educator or dietitian or nutritionist. Do not include\ndoctors or other health professionals'.\nPrecursor Influences Behaviors Health Outcomes\nCurrent behavior\nDietary patterns\nWeight\nmanagement\nPhysical activity\nlevel\nKnowledge, skills\nand motivation\n-their association\nwith following\ndiabetes care\nrecommendations:\ndietary changes and\nphysical activity,\nMedical advice\nRecommendations\nReduce fats/calories\nControl or lose\nweight\nIncrease physical\nactivity or exercise\nDiabetes\nEducation\nEnhancing skills\nRace/ethnicity\nCulture/health\ndisparities-\nrelationship\nwith access\nto health care\nHealth care\ncoverage\nMeasures\nFollowing medical\nadvice\n1.

Adapted from the NHLBI workshop on predictors of\nobesity, weight gain, diet and physical activity; August 4-5, 2004; Bethesda MD and from Ecological model [7]. Notes: The grey areas denote constructs\nthat are not measured by this study. The level and quality of patient-provider communication is unknown and is designated as a precursor for this\nstudy. It is assumed that persons diagnosed with diabetes would have some level of communication with health care professionals.\nDependent variables\n`Health Outcomes' measured in this study were the\nchanges in behavior related to diabetes self-management\n(reporting reducing fat or calories in the diet, increasing\nphysical activity or exercise and controlling or losing\nweight) (Figure 1). Questions on medical advice were\nused for the first time by NHANES [10] and correspond\nto recommendations from the Global Guideline for Type\n2 Diabetes, lifestyle management standard care [11].\nMedical advice questions examined in this study all\nwere phrased with the standard language `to lower your\nrisk for certain diseases, during the past 12 months have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or health professional to'\nand the advice added for each question were 1) reduce\nthe amount of fat or calories in your diet; 2) increase\nphysical activity or exercise; and, 3) control weight or\nlose weight. The health behavior questions were phrased\n`To lower your risk for certain diseases, are you now\ndoing any of the following' and behavior added for each\nquestion were: 1) reducing the amount of fat or calories\nin your diet; 2) increasing your physical activity or exer-\ncise; and, 3) controlling weight or losing weight. A vari-\nable for recent diabetes education was created with two\ncategories (two years or less and more than 2 years or\nnever) based on responses from the following `When\nwas the last time you saw a diabetes nurse educator or\ndietitian or nutritionist for your diabetes? Do not\ninclude doctors or other health professionals'.\nLogistic regression models were performed with\nreporting receipt of medical advice within the past 12\nmonths by race/ethnicity for each outcome of diabetes\nself-management behavior. Specifically, the independent\nvariable for model 1 was binary responses to `told to\nreduce fat or calories' and the dependent variable was\n`currently reducing fat or calories'. Similarly, model 2\nassessed the likelihood of `told to increase physical activ-\nity' with `currently increasing physical activity' and model\n3 contained `told to control or reduce weight' as the inde-\npendent variable and `currently controlling or reducing\nweight' as the dependent variable. Full models contained\nage, gender, education, health insurance, overweight/\nobese, and diabetes education.\nAdditional analysis dependent variable: obesity\nA binary variable was constructed using a proxy measure\nof obesity, body mass index (BMI). Classification was \n30 for `obese' and < 30 `not obese' with measurements of\nweight in kg divided by height in m2 (kg/m2). Values\nused for BMI for this study were calculated by direct\nmeasurements taken in the MEC by NHANES. Next,\nquartiles of BMI were compared with each medical\nadvice and behavior by the Chi Square Test.\nStudy questions\nIn this study, we assessed the following.\n1. Whether the effect of medical advice on the likeli-\nhood of performing the corresponding recommenda-\ntions differs by race/ethnicity.\n2. Whether individuals having `undiagnosed diabetes'\n(no self-report of being diagnosed with diabetes and a\npercent hemoglobin A1C  6.5) versus `diagnosed dia-\nbetes' (self-report of being diagnosed by a doctor or\nhealth professional) would differ in the relationship\nbetween given medical advice (yes/no) and its effect on\nthe corresponding behaviors.\n3. Will the effect of reporting being told to control or\nloss weight by reporting performing the behavior (con-\ntrolling or losing weight) be associated with obesity.\nData analysis\nSample weights were constructed and included in the\ndata sets to account for complex sample design and\nachieve unbiased national estimates. The choice of sam-\nple weight was based on the data file with the smallest\nsample size as recommended by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) guidelines [12]. Data analysis\nwas conducted with IBM-SPSS version 18 with a com-\nplex sampling add-on. Prior to analysis, continuous vari-\nables were assessed for normality by Q-Q plots and\nwhen needed, transformed. Post-analysis, continuous\nvariables were tested by residual graphs for skew. Hier-\narchical logistic regression models were conducted for\nmedical advice by race/ethnicity predicting adequate/\ninadequate DSM adding variables associated by the lit-\nerature as covariates. We examined 3 different types of\nmedical advice, therefore a Bonferroni correction was\nused to ensure an overall error rate of 0.05 and p <\n0.017 was considered significant. Models were estimated\nwith and without covariates. Covariates considered\nincluded age, gender, health insurance, diabetes educa-\ntion and education. In addition, obesity was added for\n`told to reduce fat or calories' and `told to increase phy-\nsical activity; whereas overweight and obesity was\nincluded for `told to control or loss weight'. The final\nmodels retain covariates with p-values of  0.2 for diag-\nnosed diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes models were\nadjusted for health insurance, age, gender, and body\nmass index categories. The Wald F statistic was used to\ndetermine model significance for complex logistic\nregression analysis [13] where the degrees of freedom\nare constrained to a constant value (the primary sam-\npling units minus the strata which equal 17 for this\ndata). Results are only presented for models which sig-\nnificantly predicted the outcomes (values available upon\nrequest). Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits\nare presented for the model without covariates and\nadjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence limits\nare presented for the models with covariates. Where\nthere was information missing, list-wise deletion was\nused and the number for each analysis was provided.\nResults\nPopulation characteristics\nThe general characteristics of the participants are shown in\nTable 1. Over two-thirds of the sample was classified as\nobese and 88% were classified as overweight based on their\nbody mass index (BMI). There were significant differences\namong race/ethnicity for age and education. White non-\nHispanics were approximately 4 years older than BNH and\nMA.

In addition, over 40% of MA responded\nthey did not know how many times per year they saw their\ndoctor; whereas approximately half of BNH and WNH\nreported they did not recall the number of doctor's visits\nover the past year. Of those who reported number of doc-\ntor visits, there were no significant differences among\nparticipants by race/ethnicity; however, those reporting\nspecific frequencies may not be representative of their\ngroup (data not shown). These results indicated there were\nsignificant differences in access to health care in MA as\ncompared to WNH. Approximately one-third of the com-\nbined sample reported not receiving advice to reduce fat/\ncalories, increase physical activity/exercise or control/lose\nweight. Additionally, participants who were overweight or\nobese were four times more likely to report receiving\nadvice to control or reduce their weight than individuals\nwith a normal body mass index (data not shown).\nMedical advice, race/ethnicity, and behavior\nThe Odds Ratios for receiving medical advice and fol-\nlowing medical advice are presented in Table 2 for par-\nticipants with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes.\nThere was a significantly greater chance of performing\nthe recommended behaviors if given the advice, inde-\npendent of ethnicity/race.

Similarly individuals who\nreported having performed the behavior were also more\nlikely to have been in the upper quartiles of the BMI\ndistribution for reducing fat or calories and losing\nweight, but not for increasing physical activity. The\nmedian BMI within the groups who had and had not\nreceived medical advice and engaged in the behavior is\nshown in Table 3 to illustrate these results.\nDiscussion\nThe ecological model applied to this study was sup-\nported with certain limitations. Our result indicated\nthat, regardless of race/ethnicity, individuals with dia-\nbetes who reported being given medical advice to per-\nform essential DSM behaviors: reducing fat or calories;\nincreasing physical activity or exercise; and, controlling\nor losing weight, were more likely to report performing\nthe corresponding behavior than those who were not\ntold. Weight reduction and management, an important\naspect of DSM, can be achieved by reducing fat or cal-\nories and increasing physical activity. Performing these\nskills is central to the recommendations for persons\nwith type 2 diabetes by the ADA [6].\nDespite the recommendation by ADA that all persons\nwith diabetes be given this medical advice, approxi-\nmately one-third of the combined sample reported not\nreceiving advice to reduce fat/calories, increase physical\nactivity/exercise or control/lose weight. Participants in\nthe normal weight category were four times less likely\nto report receiving advice to control or reduce their\nweight as compared to individuals in the overweight or\nobese category. Understanding the context of medical\nadvice and diabetes care within the ecological model\nmay be of value for understanding these discrepancies.\nDiabetes is a public health problem requiring a multi-\nlevel systems approach for prevention and treatment\n[14]. The population-based approach advocated by Glas-\ngow et al [14] includes personal, family, health care\nteam, and community influences that impact the promo-\ntion or inhibition of diabetes self-management and life-\nstyle changes. A key factor, interwoven through each\nsystem, is communication. Investigations concerning the\nrelationship between patient-provider communication\nand health behavior were conducted in the late 1960's\n[15]. There have been detailed protocols for medical\nadvice, which included collaborative goal setting, in the\nfield of nursing since the 1960's. Despite these advances,\nprocess and outcome evaluation of patient-provider\ncommunication remains underdeveloped. The complex\ndynamics of interpersonal relationships makes assess-\nment of `culturally sensitive and collaborative,' patient-\nprovider communication difficult. Moreover, few studies\nhave investigated whether the message was received in\nthe manner it was intended for diabetes patients and if\nrace/ethnicity affected the communication process.\nSeveral studies have indicated health disparities by\nrace/ethnicity have occurred in participatory provider-\npatient relationships [16-19]. There is some evidence\nthat improvements in diabetes outcomes may not occur\nfor minority patients, even when physicians are made\naware of racial disparity in diabetes care and outcomes\n[20]. A 12-month, randomized controlled trial applying\ncultural competency training found no improvements in\ndiabetes outcomes, despite the physicians' increased\nawareness of health disparities [20]. For this study, it\nwas conceivable that some patients received the stan-\ndard, recommended advice but did not process the\ninformation. We are not sure to what degree the com-\nmunication was received as intended and if there were\nvariations by race/ethnicity. Consequently, patient-provi-\nder communication may have been a confounder in\ndetermining whether receiving medical advice resulted\nin the corresponding DSM behaviors. Since patient-pro-\nvider communication was not measured but may have\ninfluenced health outcomes, it was considered a precur-\nsor for this study's theoretical model.\nWith respect to our theoretical model's categories of\ncurrent behavior leading to health outcomes, several\npoints need to be clarified. First, medical advice given\nwas measured by self reporting. The communication\nprocess, together with the patient's health beliefs and\npersonal characteristics (knowledge, motivation, and\nself-efficacy) were factors in determining if the advice\ngiven was understood as it was intended. Second, medi-\ncal advice may not be the driving force changing beha-\nviors to the corresponding desired health outcomes. It is\nnot known if the participants were performing these\ndietary and physical activity behaviors prior to being\ngiven medical advice. The inclusion of questions regard-\ning the connection of advice with the corresponding\nbehaviors by subsequent NHANES would be needed to\nclarify their associations.\nAnother difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of\nmedical advice was the nature of the questions. Medical\nadvice and health behavior questions asked by NHANES\nwere broad. The recommendations for lifestyle manage-\nment comprehensive care includes this advice; albeit\nwith individual advice on diet and physical activity as\nwell as ongoing counseling and access to a dietitian or\nhealthcare professional trained in nutrition. The ques-\ntions did not specify the clinical profession who gave\nthe advice (such as physician, nurse, nurse practitioner,\nor dietitian) or the quality and frequency of the advice.\nStrengths and limitations\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, cause\nand effect could not be established by this study since the\ndata were comparing groups from a single time point.\nSecond, there may have been subject bias in some of the\nvariables. The demographic data and data concerning\nmedical advice received were self-reported. It may be\nthat those participants who followed advice were more\nlikely to remember being given the advice. Third, the\ncomparisons by race/ethnicity were not of completely\nhomogenous groups. Within the category \"Black, non-\nHispanic\" several Caribbean cultures were combined\nwith African American. Immigrant minorities (Haitian\nversus English-speaking, Caribbean Blacks) are likely to\nhave acculturation and health belief differences from\nnon-immigrant minorities (African Americans). Within\nthe \"Mexican American\" classification differences in\nlength of time in the United States accounted for varia-\ntion of homogeneity. Even though NHANES over-sam-\nples the poor for each racial group, and the variable\neducation level was chosen as a control, income could\nnot be completely equalized across groups. Fourth, there\nwere variations in exposure variables. While the major\nexposure variables for medical advice were standard\nquestion, their interpretation may vary by the individual\nor across race/ethnicities. For example, the quantity and\nquality of the specific dietary and physical activity recom-\nmendations were not asked and interpretation may vary\nby race/ethnicity. Comparably, diabetes education varied\nby frequency (within the past two years) and duration\n(contact time with the diabetes educator) and may have\ndiffered in quality. It was possible that the exposure to\ndiabetes education could have been unequal across race/\nethnicity. Finally, the comparisons of the diagnosed and\nundiagnosed (based on A1C) were of relatively low\npower and whereas no statistically significant impact was\nTable 3 Median, 25th and 75th percentile BMI stratified by level of medical advice and behavior\nMedical advice Median BMI (P25, P75) P-value\nCross-tabs for each medical advice and each behavior with quartiles of BMI were performed by complex analysis. Significance was based on the adjusted F and\nits degrees of freedom (adjusted for complex design). The adjusted F is a variant of the second-order Rao-Scott adjusted Chi-Square statistic.\nfound, there were clinically important differences in the\nestimated Odds Ratios for these two groups. Further\nexamination of individuals with undiagnosed probable\ndiabetes is warranted.\nOne limitation of this study was the limited data inher-\nent in all secondary analysis research. In particular, data\nregarding the patient-provider communication processes\nwere absent in the NHANES database; hence in this study.\nIt has been well-documented that the patients' participa-\ntion in treatment goals improves health outcomes. Despite\nthe limitations, a major strength of this study was the use\nof a national database (NHANES), which has specialized\nin collecting health data by race/ethnicity. Since this was\nthe first year that NHANES [10] included data concerning\nmedical advice for DSM; this study was one of the first to\nuse a national database to assess health disparities of\nreported medical recommendations.\nConclusions\nThis study has demonstrated the association of specific\nmedical advice and the self-management behaviors for\nthree nationally represented racial/ethnic groups with dia-\nbetes. Although the literature indicates race/ethnic differ-\nences in health behavior, these findings suggest diabetes\nself-management may be influenced by medical advice,\nindependent of race/ethnicity. It is recommended that\nhealthcare providers reinforce specific weight management\nadvice for patients at every opportunity. Case studies and\nlongitudinal investigations are needed to determine causal-\nity among quality of patient-provider communication,\nstandards of care received, and corresponding behaviors.\nAbbreviations\nADA: American Diabetes Association; AHRQ: Agency for Healthcare Research\nand Quality; AOR: Adjusted odds ratio; BNH: Black non-Hispanic; BMI: Body\nmass index; CDC: Center for Disease Control and Prevention; DSM: Diabetes\nself-management; MA: Mexican-American; MEC: Mobile Examination Center;\nNDSS: National Diabetes Surveillance System; NIDDK: National Institute of\nDiabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases; NCHS: National Center for Health\nStatistics; NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; OR:\nOdds Ratio; WHN: White non-Hispanic.\n"
