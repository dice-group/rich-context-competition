    "abstract": "Abstract\nEciency is considered a key factor when evaluating a bank's performance. More-\nover, eciency enhancement is an explicit policy objective in the Single Market Di-\nrective of the European Commission. But eciency improvements may come at the\nexpense of deteriorating bank prots and excessive risk-taking. Both the quantitative\neects and dynamic reactions of performance in response to eciency improvements\nremain often unclear on both theoretical and empirical grounds. We analyze the dy-\nnamic relations between eciency and performance in the German banking market.\nTo this end we use panel data for all German banks for the years from 1993 to 2004\nand estimate impulse response functions (IRF) derived from a vector autoregressive\nmodel. The IRF estimate the response of a shock in eciency on prots or default\nprobabilities. The former is estimated with stochastic frontier analysis, the latter is\nestimated with a hazard rate model. The results indicate that a positive unit shift in\neciency reduces the probability of default and increases prots. On the one hand,\nwe nd evidence that the long-run impact of prot eciency on risk is larger than\nfor cost eciency. However, cost eciency impacts with a shorter time lag on the\nprobability of default. On the other hand, cost eciency has on average a slightly\nlarger impact on prots than prot eciency.\n",

Empirical evidence on the magnitude and the dynamics\nof these interdependencies, however, is virtually absent from the nancial economics\nliterature. In this study we estimate the protability and risk reactions to eciency\nshocks (and vice versa). To this end we use a panel of German universal banks\neciency itself is also driven by protability and risk. We therefore develop a panel\nvector autoregression model in order to account for endogeneity.\nWith the exception of protability, measured as return on risk-weighted assets,\nwe cannot directly observe the variables of interest. Therefore, we estimate cost\nand prot eciency (CE and PE) with stochastic panel frontier analysis and use a\nbank's probability of default estimated with a hazard rate model (Score) as a proxy\nfor risk.\nBoth measures are employed in a two equation dynamic panel model. From\nthat we obtain coecients for eciency and performance equations regressed on\nlagged endogenous, performance and eciency measures, respectively. From here we\ncalculate impulse response functions (IRF) to quantify the magnitude and dynamics\nof each eciency-performance pairing for all four measures.\nWe nd that positive eciency shocks signicantly improve bank performance in\nsubsequent periods. The eect of PE improvements on risk and of CE improvements\non protability are largest. Eciency shocks impact with a time lag of only two years\non prots and decay rapidly thereafter. The same applies for the responses of risk\nto cost eciency shocks, whereas responses to prot eciency shocks display higher\nlags of roughly four years. Compared to cost eciency the overall eects from prot\neciency shocks on risk are larger. Hence, banks that require immediate action\nto reduce their probability of default may want to focus on improving their cost\nmanagement skills. Long-term reductions of risk seem more adequately targeted by\nenhancing prot eciency.\nIn sum, improving eciency reduces risk and boosts prots. This result is robust\nacross various specication choices and IRF indicate that the eects are rather\npersistent.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nKosten- und Gewinnezienz werden im allgemeinen als wichtige Bestimmungs-\ngr\u00f6\u00ffen f\u00fcr die Ertragskraft und das Risiko einer Bank angesehen.

Dazu wird ein Panel aller deutschen Universalbanken aus den Jahren 1993\nEin Problem bei der Sch\u00e4tzung ergibt sich daraus, dass auch die Ertragskraft und\ndas Risiko die Kosten- und Gewinnezienz beeinussen. Um diesen Endogeni-t\u00e4ten\nRechnung zu tragen, wird ein Panel-Vektorautoregressives Modell entwickelt. Ein\nweiteres Problem entsteht dadurch, dass die verwandten Gr\u00f6\u00ffen in der Studie mit\nAusnahme der Ertragskraft, welche hier mit dem auf die risikogewichteten Aktiva\nbezogenen Gewinn gemessen wird, nicht direkt beobachtbar sind und deshalb sep-\narat modelliert werden m\u00fcssen. Die Kosten- und Gewinnezienz werden mit einer\nstochastischen Panel-Frontieranalyse bestimmt. Das Risiko einer Bank wird mit der\nAusfallwahrscheinlichkeit aus einem Hazardratenmodell gemessen. Aus den Vari-\nablen wird ein Zweigleichungs-Vektorautoregressives Modell gesch\u00e4tzt, jeweils mit\neiner Ezienzvariablen (alternativ Kosten- oder Gewinnezienz) und einer Per-\nformancevariablen (Ertragskraft oder Risiko). Um die Auswirkungen von Ezienz-\nschocks auf die Performancevariablen zu bestimmen, werden aus den Sch\u00e4tzergeb-\nnissen Impuls-Response-Funktionen f\u00fcr 10 Zeitperioden berechnet.\nDie Ergebnisse zeigen, dass positive Ezienzschocks in den Folgeperioden mit\neiner signikant h\u00f6heren Performance einhergehen. Besonders hoch sind die Wirkun-\ngen von Gewinnezienz auf das Risiko und von Kostenezienz auf die Ertragskraft.\nAuf die Ertragskraft wirken Ezienz-Schocks zwar mit einer vergleichsweise geringen\nVerz\u00f6gerung von etwa zwei Jahren, verlieren aber danach rasch an Wirkung. Auf\ndas Risiko wirken Kostenezienz-Ver\u00e4nderungen ebenfalls rasch. Gewinnezienz-\nschocks hingegen entfalten hier ihre Hauptwirkung auf die Risikosituation erst nach\netwa vier Jahren und sind in der Summe l\u00e4nger anhaltend und wirkungsvoller als\nKostenezienzschocks. Eine m\u00f6gliche Schlussfolgerung ist, dass Ma\u00ffnahmen zur\nSteigerung der Kostenezienz geeignet sind, auch sehr kurzfristig eine Verminderung\nder Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten zu bewirken, w\u00e4hrend sich substanzielle Risikore-\nduzierung nachhaltig eher mittels einer Verbesserung der Gewinnezienz erzielen\nl\u00e4sst.\nZusammenfassend best\u00e4tigen unsere Ergebnisse, dass Ezienzverbesserungen zu\neinem geringeren Risiko und einer h\u00f6heren Ertragskraft beitragen.

It's aim is to enhance competition and the ecient provision\nof nancial products and services in Europe (Benink, 2000). The objectives of the\nEuropean Commission (EC) have changed little since: to foster competition as to\nfurther boost the eciency of Europe's nancial industry (EC, 2005). Regulators\nand practitioners, in turn, are also concerned with the performance of banks. In\nparticular, nancial stability reviews by the Deutsche Bundesbank (2006) and the\nEuropean Central Bank (2006) monitor protability and risk.2\nBut to a large extent the relation between bank eciency and performance re-\nmains a conundrum. After all, one fundamental theorem of welfare economics ne-\ncessitates perfect competition for eciency. More eciency-enhancing competition\nreduces prices to marginal costs, thereby reducing banks' prots or even forcing\nthem out of the market. Alternatively, banks on the brink of exit may be inclined\nto take excessive risks in an attempt to gamble for resurrection when exposed to\nconstant pressure to improve eciency (Amel et al., 2004). Consequently, one may\nask whether we can have eciency and nancial stability as measured by protable\nyet reasonably risky banks at the same time (Gorton and Winton, 1998)?\nA number of studies theorizes on the relation between competition and nancial\n1m.koetter@rug.nl (M.

We would\nlike to thank participants at the Economic Seminar Series at the University of T\u00fcbingen and the\nSupervision Seminar Series at Deutsche Bundesbank. We are grateful to Claudia Buch, Ferre de\nGraeve, Sandra Eickmeier, Frank Heid, Robert Jung and Laura Spierdijk for helpful comments.\nThis paper is part of a research project funded by the 'Stiftung Geld und W\u00e4hrung'. The paper\nrepresents the authors' personal opinions and not necessarily those of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nWe are grateful for the provision of data. Any remaining errors are, of course, our own.\n2The use of the words prot and risk in the ECB's latest Review provides anecdotal evidence on\nand thus of importance, too. In contrast, the title word \"stability\" occurs only 589 times.\nstability implicitly assuming the former to enhance eciency.3 Two views juxtapose\neach other. For example, Allen and Gale (2000; 2004) advocate the concentration-\nstability notion. They argue that atomistic banking markets, and hence ceteris\nparibus more competitive and ecient ones, are more prone to crises for two rea-\nsons. Competitive markets are characterized by poor protability, which implies a\nlack of buer to absorb adverse shocks. In addition, supervision can be executed\nmore eectively for a low number of banks compared to monitoring a system of\nmany intermediaries. This view is contrasted by the concentration-fragility view.\nBoyd and De Nicolo (2005) also posit that increased concentration boosts prots\nbut highlight that market power also changes the conduct of banks. Specically,\ntheir model results in excessive risk-taking of banks if higher interest rates can be\nimposed on customers due to market power. Beck et al. (2006) tests the relation\nbetween competition (as measured by concentration) and banking system fragility\nlatter as periods when mean shares of non-performing total loans exceeded 10%.\nThey report results in line with the concentration-stability hypothesis, indicating\nthat further concentration as a response to increased competition actually stabilizes\nnancial systems. However, Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) note that approaches using\nrelatively crude macroeconomic proxies for risk and competition may fail to cap-\nture important dynamics across banks. In this vein, they conclude that empirical\nevidence, especially at the macroeconomic level, does not yield a clear picture so far.\nIndeed, the micro economic variation across rms, and even products, is at the\nheart of an important contribution by Goodhart et al. (2006). They depart from\nthe most common assumption of a representative agent but allow for heterogenous\nagents and product markets in banking. The suggested general equilibrium model\ncombines individual bank behavior, especially risk-taking, at the microeconomic\nlevel with monetary and regulatory policy at the macroeconomic level. The latter\ndetermine interest rates and costs of bank default. One core result is the endoge-\nnous possibility of trade-os between nancial stability and economic eciency. In a\ncompanion paper, they forward numerical solutions from simulation exercises with\na simplied version of the complete model (Goodhart et al., 2004). Results cor-\nroborate the previous conclusion of a possible goal conict between eciency and\nperformance. First, they nd that monetary and regulatory policy are non-neutral\nand inuence both bank protability and default penalties. Second, they nd that at\nthe microeconomic level, heterogeneous agents and banks react dierently to shocks.\nHowever, the authors caution carefully that especially the latter set of results de-\npends considerably on chosen starting values for their simulations and develop in\na hard to predict fashion. This suggests that the evolution of dierent aspects of\nbanking business, for example risk-taking on the one hand and eciency on the\nother, depend in a complex manner upon each other.\nApparently, the exact dynamics of how bank eciency and performance relate to\n3For example, theoretical models by Gorton and Winton (1998) and Perottia and Suarez (2002)\non the relation between competition and stability are both motivated by stipulating that deregula-\ntion fosters competition and thereby the eciency of the banking system. Empirically, the relation\nbetween (market) structure, (rm) conduct and performance represents an extensive literature in\nit's own right. European banking market SCP studies are Bikker and Haaf (2002a,b) and Hempell\n(2004). However, the SCP paradigm in itself is not beyond debate, see Bikker et al. (2006) for a\ncritical evaluation.\neach other remain contradictory at the least if not unclear. Despite the dierences\n(2004) are united in their call for further research to provide empirical evidence\ngiven the lack of consensus on theoretical grounds. Unfortunately, empirical tests on\nthe relation between eciency and performance of banks are to a large extent also\nreections of the described ambiguity as we illustrate shortly. Therefore, we suggest\nin this paper an alternative, agnostic empirical approach to provide evidence if\naiming at improved eciency, higher protability and reasonable risk at the same\ntime indeed is an attempt to square the circle.\nTo this end we use a panel dataset of German banks. First, we estimate cost\nand prot eciency scores with nancial data. (In)eciency is the deviation from\nan optimal cost and prot obtained from stochastic panel frontier analysis (SFA)\nusing nancial data of individual banks. Second, we observe protability also from\nbank-specic nancial accounts. Third, we develop a hazard model to estimate a\nbank's risk as the probability of default (PD). The hazard model in our context is\na rating model, which uses the correlation between a set of risk drivers observed in\na specic period and the default state observed some time after. Thus, we measure\neciency and performance directly at the rm level instead of having to follow the\ntheoretical detour via competition.\nNext, we need to appropriately deal with encountered endogeneity between e-\nciency and performance. Endogeneity means that eciency and performance aect\neach other simultaneously. The contemporaneous feedback implies that shocks in ef-\nciency impact on performance and shocks in performance impact on eciency. An\nexample of an eciency shock at the macroeconomic level is the implementation of\ndirectives enhancing competition, such as the abolishment of guarantee and mainte-\nnance obligations by the government (\"Gewaehrtraegerhaftung\" and \"Anstaltslast\")\nfor savings banks in 2004 (IMF, 2004). At the bank level, a typical eciency shock is\na restructuring program launched in period t. Presumably, such a program will not\nonly aect eciency but also prots of the current period. A typical performance\nshock, on the other hand, is an economic downturn in a sector to which a bank's\ncredit portfolio is exposed. The downturn will cause high loan loss provisions, lower\nprots and a higher PD. Contemporaneously, the performance shock may impact on\neciency, when the downturn induces the bank to enter in new sectors or markets.\nThe examples show that estimators for the impact from eciency on performance\nhave to be derived from a simultaneous model. To our knowledge this paper is the\nrst to explicitly address this simultaneity between eciency, prots and risk.\nA look on the data generation process conrms the necessity to account for the\ninterdependence of risk, return and eciency. Performance and eciency are both\ncalculated from data which refer to the same nancial statement. For accounting rea-\nsons, the dierent balance sheet and prot and loss account positions are correlated.\nFor example, accounting rules imply that loan loss provisions are linked to prots,\nwhich in turn are linked to equity capital. Data from all three accounts of the exam-\nple typically enter both, the eciency variable and the performance variable (PD\nor prots). Thus already from a static perspective, eciency, PD and prots are a\nconglomerate of correlated variables and are therefore correlated among themselves.\nA third characteristic of our study is to account for dynamic interdependencies.\nWe consider a variety of lagged relationships between eciency and performance\nsince the eects from either shock will not be conned to one period only. In con-\ntrast, we expect complex patterns of contemporaneous and lagged interactions be-\ntween both variables, which can hardly be modeled with a priori knowledge. A\nway to deal with endogeneity and complex lag structures are vector autoregression\n(VAR) models. VAR models were originally proposed by Sims (1980) as an alterna-\ntive to structural models. The major dierence between VAR models and structural\nmodels lies in the model building process. Structural models heavily rely on a priori\nknowledge, whereas VAR models are more data-driven.4 In our case, VAR mod-\nels have benets compared to structural models because the relationship between\nperformance and eciency is expected to be complex. At the same time there is\nlittle (or no) a priori knowledge about the exact lag structure. In the following we\ntherefore estimate a (two-variable) VAR model for eciency and performance.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. We set out with a brief review of\nprevious empirical work on the relation between eciency and performance in section\n2. In section 3, we introduce our theoretical concepts for estimating eciency, prots\nand risk and the IRF. In section 4 we describe the individual bank data provided by\nthe Bundesbank and the regional macroeconomic data which we additionally use.\nIn section 5 we present and discuss our results. We conclude in section 6.\n2 Empirical work on eciency and performance\nIn light of our study, empirical work on bank eciency and performance can broadly\nbe classied into two groups. Studies that explain bank performance as a function of\neciency and studies that specify an ecient frontier conditional on performance.\nThis observation alone indicates the necessity to account for interdependency on the\none hand and cautions to draw inference on causal relationship on the other.\nPerformance and eciency The literature on bank PD estimation to approx-\nimate risk is abundant and dates back to the 1970s5 First generation bank rat-\ning models focused on cross-section techniques, such as discriminant analysis and\nmethods for panel or duration data (Cole and Gunther, 1995; Estrella et al., 2000;\nrst time evidence on the direct relation between eciency and banking risk. On the\nbasis of nancial ratios, which also include protability, and historical default data\nthey predict bank failures of Kansas state chartered banks between 1910 and 1928.\nThey use non-parametric, linear programming techniques to estimate rm-specic\neciency much more directly compared to earlier studies (Charnes et al., 1978).\n4Structural models aim to t parsimonious models because coecient restrictions are necessary\nto identify the model. Imposing restrictions in our model is problematic due to unknown feedback\nrelations between eciency and performance and, thus, potentially biased results. To avoid 'unreal-\nistic restrictions', VAR models estimate an unrestricted reduced form of the underlying structural\nmodel, which allows for a maximum of feedback relations. Identication of the structure is then\nachieved by imposing a minimum number of restrictions. Hence, VAR models are parsimonious\nin the number of restrictions, but not in the number of reduced form coecients estimated. This\nallows the analysis of feedback relations and is therefore particularly suited for our purpose.\n5A comprehensive overview on rating methods is (King et al., 2005).\nTheir results yield that ineciently managed banks are more likely to fail, thus pro-\nviding evidence that higher eciency reduces the risk of instability in the banking\nindustry.6 In turn, Pasiouras and Kyriaki (2006) seek to identify the determinants\nmotivate their research by pointing out that \"adequate\" earnings are necessary to\nensure the stability and growth of banks and, ultimately, the economy. They specify\na fairly a-theoretical reduced prot equation that includes bank-specic variables\nand controls for macroeconomic conditions and ownership type. In line with other\nthey nd that better capitalization, i.e. less risky banks, has a positive impact on\nreturn on assets (ROA) and less ecient banks to exhibit also lower protability.\nEciency and performance Since it's inception in the late 1970s, the bank e-\nciency literature expanded beyond limits possibly reviewed within the scope of this\npaper.7 However, only relatively few studies followed a suggestion by Mester (1993,\n1996) to control for performance, especially risk, during estimation. Rather than\nincluding controls in the frontier itself, some studies attempt to identify what is fre-\nquently coined determinants of eciency by means of second stage analysis. They\nususally report a positive relation between eciency and protability proxies, such\nas return on assets or equity (ROE) and interest margins, and a negative relation\nwith risk proxies, such as poor capitalization or high non-performing loan shares\nA rst observation is that results are frequently inconsistent. Girardone et al.\n(2004) report insignicant coecients for protability in many sub-samples and\nthat higher interest rate margins are negatively correlated with eciency. Similarly,\nWilliams and Gardener (2003) nd that eciency depends negatively on interest\nrate mark-up's. This contradicts other ndings of higher prots to be related to\nhigher eciency. Likewise, results obtained by Casu and Molyneux (2003) yield\ninsignicant relations between risk and eciency and signicantly positive inuences\nof ROE on eciency for only two years in their sample. Das and Ghosh (2006) nd\na signicantly positive eect of ROA on eciency but carefully note that the former\nis endogenously related to eciency and therefore instrument ROA. But in their\ndiscussion it remains unclear why endogeneity is limited to ROA. We argue that\nany indicator, either performance or eciency, is based on nancial annual reports\nand may thus suer from similar problems.\nThis relates to a second critique on studies using second stage regression to \"ex-\nplain\" eciency.8 Any study of bank-specic data ultimately extract information\n6Most subsequent papers conrm that eciency measures are signicantly correlated with lower\nprobabilities of default and market exit through mergers in numerous countries (Wheelock and\neciency measures report signicant correlations for only a some (Worthington, 2002).\n7Excellent introductions to parametric and non-parametric frontier methods are Kumbhakar\nand Lovell (2000) and Ali and Seiford (1993), respectively. The development of bank eciency\n8Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) note two further problems. First, 2nd stage regressors are as-\nsumed to be uncorrelated with frontier elements in the 1st stage. If they are not, eciency estimates\nregressed in the 2nd stage are biased. Second, eciency is identically distributed by assumption in\nthe 1st stage. Estimation of a functional relationship in a 2nd stage is then paradoxical.\nfrom the identical data generation process. Put dierently, measures for risk, prof-\nitability, eciency and other indicators all emerge from bank's annual reports. Only\nfew eciency studies attempt to address this issue explicitly. Kwan and Eisenbeis\n(1997) estimate a simultaneous system of four equations to account for both risk\nand eciency being endogenously dependent. Three equations capture dierent as-\npects of risk and one species eciency as a function of the former three. They\nnd that less ecient banks are more inclined to take risks. At face value, one may\nconclude that competitive pressure to improve eciency may ignite excessive risk\ntaking. But Kwan and Eisenbeis (1997) also report that higher capitalization, i.e.\nless risky banking, positively inuences eciency. They carefully conclude that their\nresults do not only suer from low explanatory power in statistical terms, but also\nthat the economic inconsistency of results warrants future work on the presumably\nmore intricate relation between risk and eciency.\nIn sum, empirical evidence at the microeconomic level measures risk, eciency\nand protability more directly compared to the macroeconomic level. However, re-\nsults are mixed and the earlier lack of theoretical guidance as to the direction of\ncausal relations remains. The endogeneity inherent in the data generation process is\nusually neglected, let alone the dynamics of a change in eciency on performance.\nTherefore, we derive rst auxiliary measures of eciency and performance as to\nquantify subsequently the dynamic eects of both respective measures with a panel\nVAR approach.\n3 Variable Generation and Methodology\nEciency analyses benchmark individual banks relative to a market cost or prot\nfrontier (Amel et al., 2004; Berger, 2003). Theoretically, the main function of a bank\ni is to channel savings from surplus units to investors in need for funds (Sealey and\nLindley, 1977). Assuming perfect factor markets and cost minimization as objective,\nbanks demand input quantities x at given factor prices w to produce outputs y\nsuch that costs C are optimal. To account for heterogenous risk proles of banks,\nwe follow the convention in the eciency literature and condition the production\ntechnology T(y, x, z) on equity capital z. Solving this cost minimization problem\nyields an optimum cost function C\ni\n= f(yi\n, wi\n, zi\n). Observed costs are higher than\noptimal costs either due to random noise or due to ineciency. Cost ineciency\nresults from the employment of too large quantities of factors given output and/or\na sub-optimal input mix given respective prices.\nHumphrey and Pulley (1997) argue that cost eciency alone fails to evaluate\nthe ability of a bank to generate prots. They emphasize the necessity to study\nprot eciency, too. Most prot eciency studies use their alternative prot model\nwhere banks possess some output market power. This assumption is appropriate for\nGerman banking given the regional demarcation of markets (Koetter et al., 2006)\nand evidence of prevailing market power in regional credit markets (Hempell, 2004;\nFischer and Pfeil, 2003). Banks maximize prot before tax, PBT = py-wx, subject\nto T(y, x, z) and, in addition, a pricing opportunity constraint H(p, y, w, z), where\np denote output prices. Note, that the ineciencies arising from the cost side are\nconsidered in this model, too. Banks choose input quantities and output prices and\nprot ineciency leads to lower than optimal prots PBT\ni\n= f(yi\n, wi\n, zi\n). Since we\nallow banks some price setting discretion within the boundaries of H(\u00b7), both cost\nand alternative prot frontiers depend on the identical set of independent variables.\nWe use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate cost and prot functions as\nwell as cost and prot eciency (CE and PE).9 Recall that we are interested in the\nlong-run impact of eciency shocks on performance on the one hand and long-run\nreactions of eciency to performance shocks on the other. It is therefore crucial to\nspecify panel stochastic frontiers that allow for time-variant ineciency. We use the\ntranslog functional form to write a cost frontier as:10\nln Cit\n= i\n+\nJ\nj\nln xijt\n+\nJ\nK\njk\nln xijt\nln xikt\n+ it\nHere x consists of outputs y, input prices w, control variables z and a time trend\nt. In any year t, a bank i can deviate from optimal cost C due to random noise vit\nor\nineciency uit\n. To distinguish these two eects, we specify a composed total error\nit\n. Cost ineciency leads to above frontier costs and the total error is it\n= vit\n+uit\n.\nProt ineciency leads to lower than optimal prots, thus leading to it\n= vit\n- uit\n.\nThe random error term vit\nis assumed iid with vit  N(0, 2\nv\n) and independent of\nthe explanatory variables. The ineciency term is iid with uit  N|(0, 2\nu\n)| and\nindependent of the vit\n. It is drawn from a non-negative distribution truncated at\nzero. The i\n's are allowed to be correlated with yit\n, wit\nand zit\nMost studies estimate bank eciency over multiple years. But only few exploit\nthe additional information contained in longitudinal data. Parameters of equation\n(1) are estimated instead as a pooled cross-section. This is problematic since this\napproach implicitly assumes that individual bank's production is independent over\ntime, ineciency uit\nis assumed to be independent of the regressors and point es-\ntimates of ineciency are not consistent (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000). In turn,\nmost panel frontier application treat eciency either as time-invariant (Bauer et al.,\n1993) or impose substantial structure on the evolution of eciency over time (Bat-\ntese and Coelli, 1988). In light of our interest to assess the long-run behavior of\nperformance and eciency, both model classes are inappropriate. First, we assume\nby construction that shocks to performance lead to changes in eciency. Hence,\nany time-invariant modeling of eciency is ill-suited to our ends. Second, we hy-\npothesize that eciency shocks, such as restructuring programs, are likely to cause\ndeteriorating eciency rst and to yield gains only after some implementation pe-\nriod. Consequently, the development pattern of eciency should be allowed to be\nnon-monotonic.\nTherefore, we use what Greene (2005) coins a 'true' xed eects frontier model,\nwhich has two main advantages. First, eciency can develop unrestrictedly over\n9Linear programming approaches are more sensitive to outliers due to the neglect of random\nnoise. Given well-known measurement problems with banking data (Mountain and Thomas, 1999),\nwe opt here for parametric methods.\n10In case of the prot frontier only the dependent variable changes from to lnPBT.\ntime. The uit\nis not parameterized in any way as a function of time and may thus\nexhibit virtually any development pattern for a given bank i. Second, systematic dif-\nferences other than ineciency enter the bank-specic eect i\n. In contrast to most\nprevious estimators, the latter is identied separately from the ineciency term uit\nment a substantially improved performance compared to previous panel estimators.\nWe use the conditional distribution of u given  to obtain bank-specic eciency\nmeasures (Jondrow et al., 1982). A point estimator of technical eciency is given by\nthe mean of uit\ngiven it\n. Cost and prot eciency are calculated as exp(-uit\n) and\nequal one for a fully ecient bank. In the prot case, PE of 0.9 implies that a bank\nrealized only 90% of optimal prots that could have been realized with the identical\nproduction plan. Likewise, in the cost case a CE score of 90% indicates that the\nbank could have produced the identical output vector with 10% less operating cost.\nWe evaluate bank performance along two dimensions: prots and risk. The former\ncan be directly observed from nancial accounts and we dene our protability\nmeasure prots before tax PBT relative to risk-weighted assets RWA as:\n=\nIn contrast to protability, risk is not observable and has to be estimated with an\nappropriate model. We dene risk as a bank's default risk which can be assessed with\nthe probability of default (PD). Porath (2006) uses a time-discrete hazard model to\nestimate the PD of German savings banks and credit cooperatives with a sample\nsimilar to ours. Concerning the discussion of dierent rating models and the nal\nchoice we therefore refer to his study and estimate a similar time-discrete hazard\nmodel.\nLike any rating model, a hazard model transforms a set of (mostly) bank-specic\ncovariates observed in a given year t into the PD. The rating process can be thought\nof as a two-step procedure where the rst step yields the score as a weighted sum\nof the covariates. The second step transforms the score into the PD with an appro-\npriate link function. The score weights can be estimated with historical data of the\ncovariates observed in t and the actual state of default in t + 1. In such a setting\nthe average PD of all banks in t is a predictor for the default rate of all banks in\nt + 1. The individual bank PD in a given year PDit\nis the probability that bank i\ndefaults within one year. The exact denition of default is largely determined by the\navailable data. In our dataset a default event is any event indicating that the bank\nis in danger of ceasing to exist as a going concern.11 This denition corresponds to\nthe supervisory objective to prevent insolvencies.\nSince Porath (2006) nds no signicant dierences between dierent link func-\ntions we use the logit link function, which is the most easiest to handle. We write\nthe time-discrete hazard model as:\n11We provide details in section 4.\nPDit\n=\neScoreit\n1 + eScoreit\nHere, PDit\ndenotes the probability that bank i will default in period t + 1 and\nScoreit\nis the score of bank i in period t. Scoreit\nis calculated from\nScoreit\n=\nn\nj\nXit,j\nEquation (4) is a linear function of the set of j covariates Xit,j\nobserved for bank\ni in period t and weighted with the parameters j\n. Additionally, a set of time dummy\nvariables 0t\nenters equation (4) in order to account for unobserved time-eects. The\nunobserved individual eects i0\nare assumed to be random because the alternative\nxed-eects model requires a change of status of the observed endogenous variable\n(Chamberlain, 1980). This would restrict the sample to defaulted banks.\nInstead, the random-eects model permits the inclusion of the whole sample in\nthe estimation. Here we use the population average model proposed by Zeger and\nLiang (1986). The population average model estimates equations (3) and (4) with the\nGeneralized Estimating Equations (GEE) after replacing the (unobserved) variable\nPDit\nwith a dummy variable Yit+1\ntakes the value of 1 if bank i defaults in\nperiod t+1 and the value 0 otherwise. The time lag of one year between the dummy\nvariable and the covariates determines the forecast horizon.12\nOur covariate selection is in line with other bank rating studies (King et al.,\n2005). We rst allocate covariates to dierent categories of risk drivers, where the\nlatter follow the CAMELS taxonomy used by U.S. supervisory authorities and other\ncentral banks to monitor and assess banks. The categories comprise\nCapitalization,\nAsset quality,\nManagement skill,\nEarnings,\nLiquidity and\nSensitivity to market\nrisk. We then select the model which maximizes the discriminative power under\nthe restriction that it contains at least one variable of each CAMELS category. We\nmeasure the discriminative power by the area under the Receiver Operating Char-\nacteristics (ROC) curve. Typical to statistical rating analysis our dataset contains\na large set of similar variables. Capitalization, for example, can be measured with\nmany alternative ratios (e.g. Tier I capital per risk weighted assets , balance sheet\nequity capital per balance sheet total, Tier II capital divided by risk weighted assets\netc.) which are variants of the same risk driver. In order to avoid multicollinearity,\nwe additionally require that the model does not contain variants of the same risk\n12The GEE method accounts for the unobserved individual correlation with the help of a working\ncorrelation matrix which enters the estimation. We specify that all observations of one bank have\nthe same correlation, which is the standard exchangeable working correlation. The estimators are\nasymptotically consistent even if the working correlation matrix is not correctly specied (Hosmer\n13Additionally, we analyze the stability of the model with the help of hold-out samples and\nseparate estimations for dierent groups of banks.\n3.3 Panel Vector Autoregressive Model\nWe rst estimate the reduced form of the model. Since our data is a panel of indi-\nvidual bank observations we have to estimate the reduced form with dynamic panel\nestimation techniques. This means that we regress all endogenous variables on the\nlagged endogenous variables. The reduced form VAR model is a stochastic multi-\nequation system. We obtain parameters by regressing the endogenous variables on\nthe whole set of lagged endogenous variables. Analyzing eciency and performance\nresults in a two-equations VAR with the following structure:\nEffit\n=\nJ\nEffit-j\n+\nJ\nPerfit-j\nPerfit\n=\nJ\nEffit-j\n+\nJ\nPerfit-j\nHere, Effit\nand Perfit\ncapture one of our eciency variables, CEit\nor PEit\n, and\nperformance variables, ROAit\nor Scoreit\n, respectively. We use Scoreit\ninstead of PDit\nbecause equations (5) and (6) are linear and the score is the linear transformation of\nthe PD. Combining both variables for each category results in a total of four dierent\nspecications for equations (5) and (6). The maximum lag order J of the right-hand\nvariables can be xed with statistical means using the Akaike Information Criterion\n(AIC) and the outcome from diagnostic tests. To account for the unobserved time-\nin equations (5) and (6), we further specify year-dummies. We\nhandle the individual eects (10i\n) by applying the GMM estimation of\nArellano and Bond (1991) to equations (5) and (6). Note that the reduced from\ndepicted in equations (5) and (6) is a pure forecast model. As noted for example by\nSims (1980), this implies to refrain from analyzing individual coecients of these\nestimations since we are primarily interested in error terms to calculate impulse\nTo this end, we solve the estimated model and obtain the moving average (MA)\nrepresentation. This is done by recursive elimination of lagged independent covari-\nates. Note, that it is exactly this approach that necessitates stationarity of the\ndependent variables Effit\nand Perfit\nThe MA representation shows how the endogenous variables depend on the lagged\nresiduals from the reduced form. The MA representation equates Effit\nand Perfit\non present and past residuals e1\nfrom the VAR estimation:\n14One may regard the reduced form as a reection of the true but unknown structural model.\nThe latter contains additionally contemporaneous cross-terms of the respective sister equation.\nThus, the structural model cannot be estimated due to a lack of identication and simultaneous\nequation bias, as would be the traditional approach to devise an explanatory model. Instead, a\nVAR approach proceeds by estimating and subsequently solving a reduced form. On this basis, the\nsolution of the structural model is obtained thereafter.\nEffit\n+\n\n+\n\nPerfit\n+\n\n+\n\nUnder the endogeneity assumption the residuals will be correlated and therefore\nthe coecients of the MA representation are not interpretable. The reason is that for\ncorrelated residuals the ceteribus paribus condition is not reliable when interpreting\nthe coecients. Thus, the residuals have to be orthogonalized. We orthogonalize the\nresiduals by multiplying the MA representation with the Cholesky decomposition\nof the covariance matrix of the residuals. The orthogonalized, or structural, MA\nrepresentation then is:\nEffit\n+\n\n+\n\nPerfit\n+\n\n+\n\nwith\n=\nHere P is the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix of the residuals:\n) Cov(e1it\n)\n) Cov(e2it\n)\nThe orthogonal residuals can be interpreted as shocks: 1it\nis a shock in eciency\nis a shock in performance. The coecients in the equations (9) and (10) are\nthe impact multipliers and give the current response of the left-hand side variable\nto shocks occurring j periods ago. The MA representation with orthogonal residuals\nis also called impulse response function (IRF). The IRF gives the response of each\nvariable included in the model to shocks from each of the variables for individual\nperiods. For performance and eciency the IRF provides estimates for the impact\nof eciency on bank performance for the whole set of periods. The coecients of\nthe IRF are called impact multipliers because they measure the impact of a shock\nin a single period. By accumulating the impact multipliers for all periods we obtain\nthe long-run multipliers which measure the overall response of performance to an\neciency shock. IRF and long-run multipliers answer exactly the questions raised in\nour study. We are primarily interested in the impact multiplier 21j\n, which reects\nthe response of performance to a shock in eciency for the dierent time horizons\nj. But since there are no theoretically motivated priors, it also conceivable that\neciency responds to shocks in performance. An example for the latter kind of\nshock could be a hike in credit defaults due to a random macroeconomic shock\nsuch as a ood in rural areas.15 The upshot of our model is that we can assess the\ndynamic interdependencies between eciency and performance with a minimum of\nrestrictions imposed.\nThe latter results from the orthogonalization of the residuals from the observed\nresiduals. The Cholesky decomposition involves imposing one restriction on the co-\necients in the IRF because the matrix P results in an upper right element of zero.\nAs can be seen from equation (11) this implies 120\nin equation (7) to be zero. The\nkind of short-run restriction imposed depends on the order of the variables. When ef-\nciency is the rst variable in the model, we impose the restriction that performance\nshocks have no instantaneous impact on eciency. In order to impose the instan-\ntaneous zero restriction on shocks from eciency to performance, we additionally\nestimate a VAR model where the order of the variables is reversed and calculate the\nIRF function. In line with the previously mentioned lack of theoretical guidance, we\nchose two alternative short-run restrictions regarding zero contemporaneous impact\nmultipliers of eciency and performance, respectively: First, we assume that shocks\nin eciency do not instantaneously impact on the performance variable. Second,\nwe restrict shocks in performance to have no instantaneous impact on the eciency\nvariable.\nBoth restrictions have dierent implications for the interpretation of eciency:\nIn the rst case, shocks in eciency are identied as those shocks which do not\nimmediately change the performance prole of a bank. In the second case, shocks in\nperformance are only those shocks without immediate impacts on eciency. To il-\nlustrate the implications of both dierent restrictions we again refer to the examples\nof a restructuring program (eciency shock) and the bank specialized in a sector\nwhich experiments an economic downturn (performance shock). With the rst kind\nof restriction, all the contemporaneous impacts of the restructuring program are\nentirely attributed to eciency. In contrast, the contemporaneous eects from an\neconomic downturn are not restricted. With the second kind of restriction, the eco-\nnomic downturn is restricted to have instantaneous eects on the performance only.\nAt the same time the restructuring program may induce contemporaneous shifts\non performance as well as on eciency. Both restrictions have shortcomings which\nmay bias the results: The rst restriction ignores all instantaneous eects from e-\nciency on performance and the second restriction ignores the instantaneous eects\nfrom performance on eciency. Since there is no theoretical hint about which bias\nis smaller we report IRF for both alternative restrictions and analyze whether the\nresults depend on the choice of the restriction.\n4 Data and Auxiliary Results\nWe source our raw data from the Deutsche Bundesbank. It includes balance sheet,\nprot and loss account as well as audit reports for all universal banks operating in\nGermany between 1993 and 2004. In addition, we have access to the default database\n15As happened twice during this decade in East German areas on the banks of the river Elbe.\nwe estimate eciency and risk proxies, respectively.\nIn line with the intermediation approach presented in section 3.1, we specify the\nvolume of funds channeled to agents in the economy as bank output captured by\ninterbank loans y1\n, commercial loans y2\nand securities y3\n. To account for the increas-\ning importance of o-balance sheet (OBS) activities, we additionally follow Clark\nand Siems (2002) and specify OBS as a fourth output y4\n. Subject to factor prices,\nbanks demand three factors to produce this output portfolio: xed assets, labor and\nborrowed funds. We approximate the price of xed assets w1\nas depreciation over\nare calculated by dividing personnel expenses over full-\ntime equivalent employees. The cost of borrowed funds w3\nis captured by the sum of\ninterest expenses relative to interest-bearing liabilities, mostly deposits and bonds.\nFinally, we include the level of equity as a control variable z.\nTables 8 and 9 in the appendix depict parameter estimates of equation (1) and\nmean values and standard deviations of bank production and dependent variable\ndata between 1993 and 2004, respectively. First, note that during the sample pe-\nriod the number of banks almost halved. As noted by Koetter et al. (2006), most\nof this consolidation is due to mergers and acquisitions rather than voluntary exits\nor outright failures. In fact, they show that higher ineciency and lower perfor-\nmance increases the likelihood of distressed mergers. However, the interdependence\nof performance and eciency as well as the dynamic eects over a longer forecast\nhorizon remain unclear. Second, the importance to account for systematic dier-\nences between banks is underlined by large standard deviations of bank production\nAt the bottom of table 9 we depict mean CE and PE estimates from the xed\neect panel frontier model. Frontier diagnostics, such as a signicant ratio of sys-\ntematic to random variance , support the specication of both cost and prot\nfrontiers.18 Mean CE is well in line with previous results reported for German, (Al-\nmarkets (Bauer et al., 1998).Our PE scores are somewhat lower compared to other\nEuropean or U.S. studies (Amel et al., 2004), but similar to those that use compa-\nrable data sets and panel methods (Lang and Welzel, 1996; Koetter, 2006). Despite\ngrowing bank production, rising total costs and consolidating markets, CE is very\nstable over time. Apparently, relative performance was constantly monitored among\nGerman banks. On the other hand, PE exhibits a rather volatile time pattern in\n16Mountain and Thomas (1999) criticize that most bank eciency studies approximate theoret-\nically exogenous factor prices with bank-specic expenditures. Here, we calculate input prices that\nbanks face in regional markets (Koetter, 2006).\n17One may argue that excessive heterogeneity requires the estimation of separate frontiers. How-\never, comparing eciency derived from dierent samples is not possible (Coelli et al., 2005). For\nexample, 80% CE may be very good relative to one benchmark, but very poor in another peer\ngroup. Thus, we estimate a joint frontier and account for heterogeneity with bank-specic eects.\n18Log-likelihood ratio tests also support the translog functional form with a time-trend.\ntable 9 while protability continued to plummet since 1993.19 Apparently, even in\na period of steadily declining absolute protability, the relative prot eciency of\nbanks diered considerably.\nThe apparent lack of correlation of both eciency measures is well-documented\nin the literature (Bauer et al., 1998) and underlines our approach to analyze both\neciency measures' inuences on protability and risk. Simple descriptive statistics\nindicate to us that the long-term eects of shocks in the former are anything but\nclear ex ante and therefore call for the VAR approach chosen here. Beforehand, we\nturn to the estimation of our hazard model as to obtain risk proxies.\n4.2 Hazard model and PD\nTo estimate the hazard model, we rst have to dene default events. While studies\nof U.S. banks can rely on fairly clear failure criteria (Cole and Gunther, 1995; DeY-\noung, 2003), most non-U.S. studies have to approximate failure on the basis of some\nnancial ratio's threshold. In contrast to the latter, we can observe failures from\nthe records of the supervisory authorities at the Bundesbank. The occurrence of six\ndierent events is recorded and classied as distress by the authorities. First, the\nannouncement of situations that may indicate a restriction to the bank as a going\nconcern according to 29(3) of the banking act. Second, a decline of the operating\nearnings ratio by more than 25%. Third, the announcement of losses in excess of\n25% of liable capital. Fourth, capital injections by the respective pillars' insurance\nschemes. Fifth, a takeover serving restructuring purposes. Sixth, forced closure of\nthe bank following a moratorium. Note, that the Bundesbank does not actively in-\ntervene in any of these events but merely records defaults since it does not have\na legal mandate to, for example, close a bank or dismiss managers. Any legally\nbinding interventions are conducted by the Federal Supervision Agency of Financial\nServices ('Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin'). However, the\nBundesbank conducts the ongoing supervision of banks and closely cooperates with\nthe Ban. Therefore, our denition of default is in line with supervisory policy in\nGerman banking and we can refrain from having to dene some ultimately arbitrary\nthreshold level of a nancial ratio.20\nNext, we select covariates to predict these failure events. We follow broadly the\nCAMELS taxonomy described in section 3.2 and amend bank-specic covariates\nto capture the health of the corporate sector and bank market structure of banks'\nregional markets. Our dataset does not contain variables that adequately measure\nliquidity and management skill.21 We therefore restrict the analysis to the categories\ncapitalization, asset quality, earnings and sensitivity to market risk. In total, our\nmodel contains nine variables. Since we specify lags for each covariate of two years\nto predict default events, our resulting sample contains 21,599 observations between\npoints in 2004. Poor protability trends apply to all banking pillars (Koetter et al., 2006).\n20In contrast to, for example, U.S. banking markets, none of the banks in the sample fell below\nthe legally required minimum capitalization levels (Koetter et al., 2006). Hence, approximating\ndefault on the basis of nancial data alone seems inappropriate.\n21The Principle II liquidity reports are not available for the entire period and the management\nquality of a bank could be assessed with qualitative information collected in on-site inspections.\nevents and explanatory variables, we estimate equations (3) and (4) as described in\nsection 3. Parameter estimates and mean covariates for distressed and non-distressed\nobservations are depicted in table 1. The former are highly signicant and display\nthe expected sign. The area under the ROC curve amounts to roughly 0.76 which\nindicates a good discriminatory power.\nTable 1: Parameter estimates Hazard model and mean covariates\nVariable Coecients Mean of x\n(1) (2) (3) non-distress distress\nEquity ratio c1\nSecurities a1\nBad loans a2\nOperating result e1\nLoan-loss provisions e2\nFixed income s2\nNotes: Population average model estimated with GEE; Year-dummies included; Banks: 3,332; Observations: 21,599;\nROC is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics-curve; ,, denote signicant at the 1,5 and 10\npercent level.

We measure capital-\nization c1\nwith the equity capital ratio. Equity capital here also contains undisclosed\nreserves. The negative sign of the coecient indicates that increasing equity capital\nceteris paribus lowers risk. Asset quality is measured with the ratio of total secu-\nand the ratio of provisioned loans or loans with increased\nrisk to the total of audited loans a2\n. The negative impact of securities on PD can\nbe explained with a lower risk of securities compared to other assets. The opposite\napplies to provisioned loans or loans with increased risk, which exhibits a positive\ncoecient in table 1. We capture the earnings situation with operating results di-\nvided by balance sheet total e1\nand the share of provisions of the operating results\n22Including primarily money market and xed income assets.\n. As expected, the former enter the model with a negative sign. Higher operating\nresults ceteris paribus improve a bank's nancial health. In turn the latter indicates\nincreased risk as witnessed by a positive coecient. Sensitivity to share price uc-\ntuations is measured with the share of stocks to the balance sheet total s1\n. The\nrationale for the positive sign of the coecient is the positive correlation between\nthe volume of stocks and the exposure to stock market price risk. The exposure\nto interest rate risk is captured by the net xed interest rate liabilities s2\n, which\nalso is positively correlated to default. Both ratios are rather simple compared to\nthe market risk indicators developed in recent years. However, more sophisticated\nratios were not available for the whole sample and the whole set of banks. The rst\nregional control variable is the corporate insolvency ratio per district ('Kreis') INS.\nIt controls for the quality of the regional asset market and is linked to credit risk.\nThe second regional control variable is the mean market share per district. It ac-\ncounts for market power and therefore may be linked to both market risk and credit\nrisk. Both variables presumably have a signicant inuence on default because many\nGerman banks operate on regionally conned markets.\nWe also analyze the discriminatory power of eciency. To this end we rst add\nthe variables cost and prot eciency to the hazard model, respectively, as depicted\nin column (1) in the second panel of table 1. In both cases we nd no signicant\nrelation.23 But a hazard model with eciency as the only covariate yields a signi-\ncantly negative impacts of prot eciency in (column 2) and cost eciency (column\n3). Hence, eciency alone is a helpful predictor for defaults but the predictive infor-\nmation is completely contained in other nancial ratios. This result underpins the\nendogeneity of a bank's PD, performance and economic indicators such as eciency.\nWhile eciency itself is signicantly correlated with bank defaults, the eminent\nthreat of default for the chosen prediction horizon can be retrieved more directly\nby alternative nancial indicators. These, in turn, may in fact follow structural in-\neciencies of a bank. This endogeneity between eciency and other nancial ratios\nthus supports our approach to use VAR-modeling and seems to be an appropriate\nway to gain insight into the dynamic relationship between eciency and risk.\nWe discuss rst specication tests for the VAR model and present next our results\nregarding shocks and responses of eciency and performance, respectively.\nLag order The rst step in VAR-modeling is to determine the appropriate lag order\nJ of the reduced form given in equations (5) and (6), respectively. Lutkepohl (2005)\nsuggests to estimate models with dierent lag orders and then to choose the model\nwith the highest lag order that passes the diagnostic tests. We estimate the reduced\nform with the Arellano-Bond-GMM (AB) estimator for the lag orders of J = 1, ..., 4\n23Coecient estimates for other covariates hardly changed, as did explanatory power depicted\nby ROC values in the bottom panels of table 1.\nTable 2: Optimal lag order J for the reduced form VAR\nLag Arellano-Bond autocorrelation test1)\nSargan AIC\nEciency equations\nPerformance equations\nNotes: AB-GMM two-step estimation with time-dummies; ,, signicant at 5%, 1% and 0.1%.\nWe report the AIC, the Sargan test of over-identifying restrictions and the\nArellano-Bond tests of autocorrelation for the whole set of our variables.24 We de-\npict results from the eciency equations in the upper panel and those from the\nperformance equations in the bottom panel.\nThe AIC criteria unanimously advocate the maximum lag order of four. In most\ncases the Sargan test also turns insignicant for higher lag orders.25 Therefore, we\nfocus on the models with J = 4.26 Table 2 shows that the residuals from the re-\ngression of PE on ROA and PE are autocorrelated. When reducing the model to\nsmaller lag orders the autocorrelation seems to vanish. This is counterintuitive, since\nincreasing lag orders should come along with reduced autocorrelation of the residu-\nals. Potentially, this result is attributable to a loss of degrees of freedom. Except for\n24We use the two-step estimator for regression diagnostics and the one-step estimator for infer-\nence about coecients because t-ratios of the former estimator are unreliable (Bond, 2002).\n25The only exception is the regression of Score on Score and PE. Tests for autocorrelation of\nhigher order than four lags are infeasible due to sample size.\n26Note that the AB estimator takes dierences of the variables in equations (5) and (6). This\nintroduces a rst-order MA-component in the model. As a result, signicant test statistics of rst\norder autocorrelation do not indicate a misspecication.\nthree specications all remaining 4th-order models pass the autocorrelation test.27\nOverall the results conrm that the model with four lags is optimal.\nStationarity As noted in section 3.3, our approach of solving the reduced form\nto obtain the structural MA representation requires that the dependent variables\nare stationary. Therefore, we test all four measures for panel unit roots for one up\nto four lags. Since our panel is unbalanced we use an augmented Dicky Fuller test\nin the vein of Maddala and Wu (1999) rather than the Im-Pesaran-Shin test (2003).\nThe according tests statistics are depicted in table 3.\nTable 3: Fisher test for panel unit roots\nEciency Performance\nLag Statistic CE PE Score RoA\nOur results pertain that we can reject the hypothesis of non-stationarity for all\nfour series. While this does not imply per se that resulting IRF are reasonable,\nstationarity is a necessary condition for our methodology. Consider therefore next\nthe respective shocks and according responses of both eciency and performance,\nrespectively.\n5.2 Shocks and responses\nWe calculate two separate Impulse Response Functions (IRF) for each eciency-\nperformance pairing depicted in gures 1 through 4, respectively. The rst impact\nmultiplier restriction (IMR) entails that the instantaneous impact multiplier of per-\nformance in the equation for eciency is zero. The second IMR is that the instan-\ntaneous impact multiplier of eciency in the equation of performance is zero. We\nalso show 90%-condence intervals for the IRF.28 To ease interpretation, we further\ndivide the coecients in equation (9) by 110\nand the coecients in equation (10)\n. The transformed coecients represent the response to unit shocks.29 The\n27The specications Score on Score and PE and on Score and CE as well as PE on Score and\nPE, respectively, yield signicant autocorrelation of higher order than one, albeit only at the 5%\npercent level.\n28For the calculation of the condence intervals we randomly draw 1,000 sets of values for the\ncoecients in the VAR model with the estimated mean and standard error and calculate the IRF\nafterwards based on this model. The 90% condence interval is then given by the 5% and 95%\npercentile of the simulated IRF distribution.\n29We also calculated IRF on the basis of shocks of one standard error. Results are qualitatively\nnot aected.\ncorresponding long-run multipliers (LRM) are reported for each of the four pairings\ninvestigated, too.30\nCost eciency shocks We are most interested in the performance responses to\nshocks in eciency. Consider to this end gure 1, which depicts the relations between\nCE shocks and both Score and ROA responses, respectively.\nFigure 1: Unit shocks in CE and performance responses\nhorizon\nCE on Score - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nCE on Score - Efficieny multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nCE on ROA - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nCE on ROA - Efficieny multiplier is zero\nCost efficiency shocks and performance responses\nImpulse Response Function\nRegarding the dynamics of a CE shock on risk as measured by Score, consider the\nIRFs in the upper panel of gure 1. Independent of the chosen restriction, both\nexhibit large responses in the period after the occurrence of the shock. Afterwards\nthe responses continuously and rapidly decay. Responses nally turn insignicant\nafter about four periods. The empirical evidence therefore conrms the role of ef-\nciency as an eective target when aiming at lowering a bank's risk. Our results\nfor cost eciency improvements thus support the view that the political objective\nof enhancing eciency does not jeopardize the average riskiness of German banks.\nThis is corroborated by odds ratios calculated from the long-run multipliers, which\nwe report in table 4. For CE the odds ratio implies that a unit shock lowers the\nodds to default by about 10 to 20 percent. This underpins that targeting eciency\nimprovements can yield substantial and sustained reductions of risk.\nApart from reducing risk, a shock in CE furthermore improves bank protability\nconsiderably as shown in the bottom panel of gure 1. Shocks reach their maximal\nimpact approximately after one year, wear out very rapidly and do virtually not exist\nanymore after the second period. While the restriction choices lead to somewhat\n30As noted earlier, long run multipliers are calculated on the basis of the estimated reduced\nform model. While the latter is ill-suited for direct inference due it's forecasting nature, we depict\nindividual parameter estimates for completeness in table 10 in the appendix.\nTable 4: Long run multipliers: Cost eciency and performance\nShock in Impulse on IMR1) on LRM2) OR3)\n1) IMR: Instantaneous Multiplier Restriction; 2) LRM: Long-run\nmultiplier; 3) OR: Odds Ratio equal to OR = eLRM .\ndierent evolution paths of ROA in the immediate aftermath of a CE shock, the\nshort-run nature of eects is robust for both. The cumulative eects for shocks from\ncost eciency are approximately 0.4. Thus, cost eciency improvements lead to an\nimmediate increase of prots but only to limited long-run eects.\nIn sum, both impulse-response functions and long-run multipliers show that in\nall periods where the responses are signicantly dierent from zero, higher cost\neciency lowers risk and increases prots. The choice of restrictions seems to be of\nminor importance for most of our results as witnessed by similar long-run multipliers\nfor the dierent restrictions reported in table 4.\nProt eciency shocks A number of bank eciency studies demonstrate that\ncost eciency alone may not reect the full picture of bank's ability to manage\ntheir business appropriately in competitive markets. European banking studies em-\nphasizing the importance to analyze also prot eciency are, for example, Altunbas\nincreased competition from non-bank nancial intermediaries necessitates not only\necient cost management. It is at least equally important to supply a vector of out-\nputs in correct proportions. In the same vein, much of the legislative initiatives to\ncreate a level playing eld in European banking aim especially at increasing prot\neciency in the sense of providing customers with the desired range of nancial ser-\nvices at optimal prices. But, for example, the European Central Bank (2005) point\nout that such prot eciency improvements imply increased pressure on margins,\nthereby reducing prots. Eorts to enhance eciency may even induce excessive\nrisk-taking in an attempt to defend market shares. To assess the consequences of a\nshock to PE consider gure 2.\nInstantaneously, the impact of a shock in PE on risk is small and even declining\nduring the rst years. However, eciency changes exhibit a high persistence and\nreach their maximum after four years. The long-run eect on score is about -0.4\n(for the restriction on PE) and -0.3 (for the restriction on Score) according to our\nresults shown in table 5. As for cost eciency, we also report the odds ratios and\nnd that a unit shock in PE lowers the odds to default by about 25 to 35 percent.\nThus, prot eciency has a larger impact on PD compared to cost eciency. On\nthe other hand, cost eciency impacts immediately on PD while the eects from\nprot eciency unfold completely only after four years. A possible policy implication\nfrom this nding is that cost eciency is an appropriate target for banks that aim\nFigure 2: Unit shocks for PE and performance responses\nhorizon\nPE on Score - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nPE on Score - Efficiency multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nPE on ROA - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nPE on ROA - Efficiency multiplier is zero\nProfit efficiency shocks and performance responses\nImpulse Response Function\nto reduce their risk immediately. In contrast, prot eciency seems preferable for\nenhancing the long-run risk prole of a bank.\nTable 5: Long run multipliers: Prot eciency and performance\nShock in Impulse on IMR1) on LRM2) OR3)\n1) IMR: Instantaneous Multiplier Restriction; 2) LRM: Long-run\nmultiplier; 3) OR: Odds Ratio equal to OR = eLRM .\nWith respect to protability, PE shocks mimic the dynamics of cost eciency\nshocks. The eects on ROA reach their maximal impact after one year and vanish\nquickly in subsequent periods yielding an overall eect of 0.3. Thus, both types\nof eciency improvements come along with an immediate increase of prots. The\nlong-run eects from cost eciency, however, are larger compared to prot eciency.\nCost eciency responses By means of examples we considered so far eciency\nshocks, which may either emanate from macroeconomic or microeconomic changes.\nAn example of the former are deregulation eorts such as the introduction of a single\nbanking license in Europe. An example for the latter are restructuring programs or\nreplacement of incumbent managers. However, we need to acknowledge that none\nof these examples is founded in theory. In fact, it is also perfectly conceivable that\nperformance shocks occur and eciency changes in response to that. Due to this\nlack of theoretical guidance, which exists in macroeconometric VAR applications,\nfor example, by modeling monetary shocks, we also report results for cost and prot\neciency responses to performance shocks, respectively. In the top panel of gure 3\nwe depict to this end CE responses to a unit shock in Score.\nFigure 3: Unit performance shocks and CE responses\nhorizon\nScore on CE - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nScore on CE - Efficiency multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nROA on CE - Performance multiplier is zero\nhorizon\nROA on CE - Efficiency multiplier is zero\nPerformance shocks and cost efficiency responses\nImpulse Response Function\nIn contrast to the reverse relation of shocks in CE and resulting Score responses\ndepicted earlier, our results show that a shock in risk actually increases CE sig-\nnicantly for up to ten years. While the dynamics dier slightly according to the\nchoice of restriction (see right panel in gure 3), the bottom line remains quali-\ntatively robust. This response of eciency to shocks in Score may reect banks'\neorts to change eciency when performance is deteriorating. Increasing risk comes\nalong with a long-run increase in cost eciency, which peaks after approximately\nthree years before the responses decline slowly thereafter. Apparently, banks focus\non improving their ability to provide nancial services cost eciently after having\nexperienced a shock in PD.\nTable 6: Long run multipliers: Performance and cost eciency\nShock in Impulse on IMR1) on LRM2)\n1)IMR: Instantaneous Multiplier Restriction; 2)\nLRM: Long-run multiplier; 3)OR: Odds Ratio equal to OR = eLRM .\nThe response of CE on protability shocks regarding both the shape of the\nimpulse response functions and the magnitude of the long-run multipliers depicted\nin table 6 also dier across restriction choices. Short-run restrictions on eciency\nlead to lower long-run multipliers (0.1 for CE) than short-run restrictions on prots\n(0.5 for CE). Robust to the short-run restriction is that in all cases the impacts on\ncost eciency are positive, yet very volatile, and last around four years.\nProt eciency responses As can be seen from gure 4, the reverse relation be-\ntween Score and PE diers from the reverse relation with cost eciency. Increasing\nrisk has only small positive eects on prot eciency. Impulse response functions for\nboth multiplier restrictions yield mostly insignicant eects after two years. Hence,\nprot eciency seems to be hardly aected by sudden changes in the risk prole of\nthe bank.\nFigure 4: Unit performance shocks and PE responses\nhorizon\nScore on PE - Performance multipliers is zero\nhorizon\nScore on PE - Efficiency multipliers is zero\nhorizon\nROA on PE - Performance multipliers is zero\nhorizon\nROA on PE - Efficiency multipliers is zero\nPerformance shocks and profit efficiency responses\nImpulse Response Function\nThe responses of eciency on protability shocks also depend on the choice of the\nrestriction, as indicated by dierent shapes of the impulse response functions and\nthe magnitude of the long-run multipliers. Short-run restrictions on eciency lead to\nlower long-run multipliers (zero for PE and 0.1 for CE) than short-run restrictions\non prots (0.2 for PE and 0.5 for CE). Robust to the short-run restriction is that in\nall cases the impacts on cost eciency are higher than on prot eciency and that\nthe overall eect is positive. A positive impact from prot shocks on eciency sug-\ngests that, in contrast to risk shocks, banks do not react to protability shocks with\neciency enhancing measures. Potentially, these two dimensions of performance are\nregarded as substantially dierent problems that each require alternative manage-\n31For example, banks may indeed target eciency after risk shocks but may try to acquire\nmarket power through mergers (Amel et al., 2004), or boost sales by entering new markets after a\nprotability shock (Berger et al., 2003).\nTable 7: Long run multipliers: Performance and prot eciency\nShock in Impulse on IMR1) on LRM2)\n1)IMR: Instantaneous Multiplier Restriction; 2)LRM:\nLong-run multiplier; 3)OR: Odds Ratio equal to OR = eLRM .\nBut given the volatile pattern of eects, their bare signicance and the very low\nmagnitude, we are more inclined to hypothesize that the relation between protabil-\nity shocks and eciency reactions is simply weak. Perhaps the long-run nature of\nmany eciency enhancing measures, such as restructuring projects, is simply con-\nsidered an inappropriate management tool to react to declining prots.\nTo sum up, our results conrm that eciency is a powerful means to enhance a\nbank's performance. Both, cost and prot eciency shocks increase prots and de-\ncrease risk. Cost eciency impacts with a shorter time lag on probability of defaults\nthan prot eciency at the expense of a lower long-run eect. Cost eciency, on\nthe other hand, has a slightly larger overall eect on prots. By and large, results\nare robust to the dierent restrictions used in our estimation and only protability\nshocks and responses exhibit alternative dynamics subject to this choice.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we suggest a VAR approach to model and quantify the intricate in-\nterrelations between bank eciency, risk and protability. While our approach is\nantithetic to recent theoretical developments of general equilibrium models, such as\nin Goodhart et al. (2006), we aim to contribute complementary agnostic evidence\non the issue if eciency gains and sustained performance are mutually exclusive\nobjectives. In short, we nd for the German banking market that both objectives\ndo not contradict each other.\nhand, we measure cost and prot eciency (CE and PE) with stochastic frontier\nanalysis. On the other, we approximate a bank's risk with a hazard model using\nhistorical distress data provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. These measures are\nthen employed to estimate a dynamic panel VAR. In line with theoretical predictions,\nwe nd indeed that eciency and performance measures exhibit complex interde-\npendencies. Both determine each other both contemporaneously and over time. To\nquantify the long-term dynamic eects of shocks in either of our measures, we calcu-\nlate impulse response function for a forecast horizon of ten years. Our main ndings\nare as follows.\nFirst, we nd that both kinds of eciency improvements reduce risk and increase\nprotability. The largest cumulative long-term eects are those of PE shocks on risk\nand CE shocks on protability. Consequently, bankers are well-advised to target ef-\nciency improvements since they can yield sustained and pronounced improvements\nin protability and risk.\nSecond, the dynamics of shocks and eects dier across our four eciency and\nperformance measures respectively. While CE improvements reduce the risk of a\nbank immediately, PE improvements fully unfold only after four years but impact\nfor as long as up to 10 years. Thus, bankers and/or regulators that see need for\nimmediate action to reduce a bank's probability of default may want to focus on\ncost eciency. In turn, sustained risk reduction warrants a stronger focus on the\nbank's relative ability to maximize prots given its production plan.\nThird, interactions between eciency and performance are asymmetric. Higher\neciency reduces risk, but increases in risk lead to higher eciency, especially on the\ncost side. This result suggests that bankers aim especially at cost eciency improve-\nments, for example by means of restructuring programs, after having experienced a\nrisk shock. In turn, higher eciency aects protability positively and vice versa.\nThus, bankers seem to react only to shocks in their riskiness by improving eciency\nwhile protability declines are according to our results no spark to launch eciency\nimprovements.\nTo our knowledge, our results provide for the rst time empirical evidence about\nthe dynamic interdependencies of eciency and performance. The quantication of\nshocks and responses show that eciency improvements are a useful target to im-\nprove protability and reduce risk. Our ndings suggest that eciency enhancing\nmeasures, for example the promotion of more competition, do not bear immediate\ndangers of excessive risk-taking or sudden protability distortions. Our results re-\ngarding dierent timing patterns of these eects may be of interest to policy makers\nand regulators as well as bankers and consumers of nancial services alike.\nClearly, this research is at the same time subject to a number of limitations,\nwhich warrant future research. First, our model does not explicitly allow for conta-\ngion eects across banks. This is an important limitation when drawing inference\nfor policy-making at the macroeconomic level. Second, the VAR methodology sug-\ngested here is completely a-theoretical. Future extensions should aim to follow the\ndevelopments of macroeconomic VAR modelling and devise structural VARs. Specif-\nically, augmenting the model for an explicit competition equation along the adjusted\nPR-approach of Bikker et al. (2006) seems challenging yet promising in this respect.\nFinally, our model does not account explicitly for (cross-border) bank market con-\nsolidation, which certainly is an important item on policy makers' agendas, too.\nReferences\nAli, A.
