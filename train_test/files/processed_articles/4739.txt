    "abstract": "Abstract\nPersonality trait questionnaires are regularly used in individual differences research to examine personality scores between\nparticipants, although trait researchers tend to place little value on intra-individual variation in item ratings within a\nmeasured trait. The few studies that examine variability indices have not considered how they are related to a selection of\npsychological outcomes, so we recruited 160 participants (age M = 24.16, SD = 9.54) who completed the IPIP-HEXACO\npersonality questionnaire and several outcome measures. Heterogenous within-subject differences in item ratings were\nfound for every trait/facet measured, with measurement error that remained stable across the questionnaire. Within-subject\nstandard deviations, calculated as measures of individual variation in specific item ratings within a trait/facet, were related to\noutcomes including life satisfaction and depression. This suggests these indices represent valid constructs of variability, and\nthat researchers administering behavior statement trait questionnaires with outcome measures should also apply item-level\nvariability indices.\n",

The contextual variation established\nat the broad trait construct level is a result of variations in\ndifferent behaviors generally associated with the same trait.\nAn examination of this kind of variation is rarely done or\nreported in personality trait research. Yet, according to\nMcDonald (1999), measurement error of the constructs in a\ntest remains moderately invariant, while the true components\nmay differ.\nFailing to account for true within-subject variation, as dis-\ntinct from any measurement error, in a personality trait ques-\ntionnaire means past research may have missed meaningful\npredictable relationships between intra-individual differ-\nences and outcomes. Past research has found personality\ntraits to be related to a variety of behavioral acts (frequency\nof) and clinical indicators (Gruzca & Goldberg, 2007;\nnot distinguished between and within-subject variances\nseparately.\nA person's contextual responsiveness may be revealed in\nthe way in which personality trait measures are developed\nfrom item pools and analysis. The Cronbach's alpha equation\n(Cronbach, 1951), for example, is a key statistic for measur-\ning test reliability. Inter-item correlations are not always very\nstrong (above r = .50) even in high reliability tests. Items\ncorrelating above r = .50 are likely to be too similar to be\nuseful in a representative trait test for the wide spectrum of\nbehaviors captured by that trait. This supports there being\nsome meaningful true within-subject variation in the item\nratings. This suggests some people may be displaying true\nwithin-subject variation in the item ratings within a trait,\nrather than displaying a strong trait disposition at either end\nof a trait dimension. When responding to personality trait\nquestionnaires, individuals who do not display a strong trait\ndisposition will display variations in their responses to highly\nspecific behavior items, even if these items tap into a similar\npersonality dimension. Consider, for example, these five\nbehaviors that reflect expressiveness from the IPIP-\nTalk a lot\nAm never at a loss for words\nAm the life of the party\nTell people about it when I am irritated\nHave an intense, boisterous laugh\nA respondent may give ratings that indicate they may talk\na lot, but not tell people about it when they are irritated; or\nthe respondent may be the life of the party, but not have an\nintense, boisterous laugh. Few studies have been conducted\ninto this area in comparison to the mass of trait personality\nresearch available in the literature. The previous research\ninto item-level variability, conducted from classical test and\nitem response theory approaches, suggests that participants\ndo display varied levels of consistency--sometimes called\n\"traitedness\"--between behaviors thought to tap into the\nsame disposition (Baumeister, 1991; Biderman & Reddock,\nvariability in responses has been found to display re-test sta-\nbility (Baumeister, 1991) and is influenced by genetics\n(Hershberger, Plomin, & Pedersen, 1995). This would not be\nexpected, particularly if the variation is due to measurement\nerror. This variability is likely to be influenced by the diffi-\ncultly of each item, which may be different for every partici-\npant (Reise & Waller, 1993), and item-specific variances that\ndo not align solely with the trait construct it aims to measure.\nThis may be because an item has different connotations for\neach participant, based on their personal experiences, that\nmay cause meaningful changes in difficulty or its alignment\nwith a particular trait construct for that individual.\nThere are reasons, therefore, to believe, that these varia-\ntions in the different behavioral aspects of a trait validly mea-\nsure variation in behavior of considerable importance in\npersonality research, although the trait approaches appear to\nminimize it. Part of the reason for this may be that these indi-\nces have not been examined in relation to a wide range of\npsychological outcomes, which brings their validity into\nquestion. Recent research indicates that behavioral flexibil-\nity may itself be related to personal outcomes in health\nbehaviors (Fletcher, Hanson, Pine, & Page, 2011), suggest-\ning that within-subject variation may be important for well-\nbeing. The research reported here considers this issue--if\nitem level within-subject variation is present (in a wide range\nof traits and facets), does this variation predict meaningful\npositive or negative psychological outcomes? If it does pre-\ndict meaningful outcomes, then these indices would appear\nto be valid measurements of variability that should be applied\nin personality trait research to provide more information\nfrom the questionnaire.\nTo test whether the within-subject component of variation\nis valid, we first measure the extent of this variation in the\nHEXACO model and then consider how much of these vari-\nations can be considered true variation, rather than measure-\nment error. Previous research found varied degrees of\ncorrelation in inter-item ratings and so we predicted that\nmore variation will be explained by true within individual\ndifferences than error, which will be stable across traits or\nfacets.\nWithin-subject standard deviations (WS SDs) of state-\nment ratings within each personality trait and facet will be\ncalculated as indices of variability. We will examine the WS\nSDs in relation to various outcomes including life satisfac-\ntion, anxiety, depression, self-pluralism, sensation seeking,\nand tendency toward habitual behavior. If the variability\nreflects useful responsiveness to particular behaviors within\nthe attribute, the WS SDs are expected to correlate positively\nwith life satisfaction and sensation seeking, and negatively\ncorrelate with anxiety, depression, self-pluralism, and\nChurchyard et al. 3\ntendency toward habitual behavior. This refers mainly to\nvariation in item ratings for the emotionality (E) and extra-\nversion (X) traits and sub-facets, as displaying extremes at\neither end of these attributes is not beneficial (being highly\nunemotional or emotional, or highly introverted or extra-\nverted). For those WS SDs where variability of behavior\nmight be detrimental, the opposite was expected. This mainly\nrefers to variation in the honesty\u00adhumility (H), agreeable-\nness (A), conscientiousness (C), and openness to experience\n(O) traits and sub-facets, as higher honesty\u00adhumility, agree-\nable, conscientious, and openness behaviors are generally\nconsidered positive trait qualities. It should be noted that\nthere are reasons to believe the effect sizes for these correla-\ntions may not be as strong as in standard trait studies. First,\nthe psychometric construction of trait questionnaires is\ndesigned to minimize such variability, even when it is \"true\"\nvariability. Second, based on Britt (1993), the relationships\nbetween a dispositional outcome (traited) variable and an\nuntraited variable display substantially lower effects than\ntwo dispositional (traited) variables.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nA psychology department subject pool was used along with a\nsmaller community sample to collect 160 adult participants\nage\naccessed the study measures via the U.K. survey hosting site,\nBristol online survey. One hundred and twenty of the partici-\npants (those recruited from the psychology school subject\npool for course credit) completed all measures (113 female,\nage\n46). For technical reasons, some measures were unavailable\nfor the 40 community participants as these were collected\nearlier (specified in the measures section).\nMeasures\nIPIP-HEXACO Personality Questionnaire. Developed by Ashton\net al. (2007), the IPIP-HEXACO is based on the HEXACO-\nPI, which measures the HEXACO model of personality (Lee\n& Ashton, 2004). The IPIP-HEXACO measures the Big-\nFive and an additional honesty\u00adhumility trait, and 24 facets\n(4 for each trait). There were 10 items included in each facet\nscale. Behavior statement items were rated on a 5-point Lik-\nert-type scale (response options: 1 \"very inaccurate,\" 2\n\"moderately inaccurate,\" 3 \"neither accurate nor inaccu-\nrate,\" 4 \"moderately accurate,\" 5 \"very accurate\") to indi-\ncate the extent to which an item is characteristic of the\nindividual, yielding a score between 10 and 50 for each per-\nsonality facet (trait scores were divided by 4 to match this\nscale). The IPIP-HEXACO facet scales contain positively\nand negatively keyed items (the negatively keyed items were\nreverse coded prior to analysis). The IPIP-HEXACO items\nwere in a randomized order when the questionnaire was\nadministered. The IPIP-HEXACO facet scales have sound\npsychometric properties (Ashton et al., 2007) with Cron-\nbach's alphas ranging between .69 and .88 (M\n\nSensation seeking score. Sensation seeking was computed as\nan outcome based on an equation developed and reported in\nde Vries, de Vries, and Feij (2009) from the total facet scores\nfor fearfulness, unconventionality, creativity, social bold-\nness, sociability, fairness, and prudence. de Vries, de Vries,\nand Feij found this score to converge highly with other sen-\nsation seeking measures.\nitems with a true/false response that measure the individual's\nperception of how much their behavior varies across situa-\ntions. The SPS-30 has been found to be highly reliable ( =\nThoughts and Feelings Questionnaire. The Thoughts and Feel-\nings Questionnaire from the FIT Profiler (Fletcher & Stead,\n2000) measures frequency of feeling anxious (4 items) and\ndepressed (4 items; each a 0-12 ratio scale). Items were\nrated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (response options: 0\n\"never,\" 1 \"very rarely,\" 2 \"now and again,\" 3 \"very fre-\nquently/often\"). These have been shown to display high reli-\nability (anxiety  = .80, depression  = .78) and have been\nvalidated against several other common measures of general\nfree-floating anxiety and depression (Sharma, 2010). To\navoid confusion with the anxiety facet in the IPIP-HEXACO,\nthese two variables are referred to as anxiety(TF) and\ndepression(TF).\nLife satisfaction. Life satisfaction was measured with 17 items\n(n = 120). Five of these items were the item set from the\nSatisfaction With Life Scale developed by Diener, Emmons,\naddition, 12 items were designed by the researcher to mea-\nsure aspects of life satisfaction as single item indicators.\nThese items tapped into satisfaction with social, family, and\nromantic relationships; happiness and pride with the indi-\nvidual's life; and satisfaction with career. An example item\nwas, \"I have satisfying social relationships.\" All the items\nwere measured on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1\n\"strongly disagree\" to 7 \"strongly agree.\" The combination\nof these 17 items is referred to as life satisfaction in this\nTendency toward habitual behavior. Tendency toward habitual\nbehavior was measured using three items (n = 120). The\nthree items were measured on a Likert-type scale ranging\nfrom 1 \"strongly disagree\" to 7 \"strongly agree,\" giving a\nscale range between 3 and 21. These general items were\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. The Within-Subject ANOVA Results for Differences in Ratings Within Each Trait and Facet.\nHEXACO variable\nF(df) Partial 2 F(df) Partial 2\nNote.

High scores indi-\ncated a greater tendency toward habitual behavior. An exam-\nple item was \"I do not find making changes easy.\" The three\nitems displayed a reliability of  = .73.\nResults\nThe following analyses were conducted using SPSS, Version\n19. All of the variables used in the following analyses were\nfound to be normally distributed.\nWithin-Subject-Level Variation in Each Trait and\nFacet\nWe conducted within-subject analyses of variance (ANOVAs)\non the statements tapping into each trait and facet scale to\ndetermine whether the variation is due more to differences\nwithin the person, rather than measurement error. The within-\nsubject ANOVA allows for this as it partials out the between-\nsubject variation and examines the within subject variance as\nseparate from between-subject variance. The mean square\nresidual error (MSE) values for every trait were similar (rang-\ning between 1.41 and 1.56), and the MSE values for the facets\nerror was quite stable. This means the F statistics (the ratios of\nthe mean square of differences between behavior statements\nand mean square residual error) can be used to distinguish\ndegree of within-subject variation between the attributes well.\nThe within-subject ANOVA statistics (based on Huynh-\nFeldt adjustments) for each facet are reported in Table 1. The\nresults indicate there are significant within-subject differences\nin the rating of behavior statement items across the sample. The\nChurchyard et al. 5\nMauchly test of sphericity for every analysis suggested hetero-\ngeneous variances, which is expected with individual differ-\nences in within subject varied response styles to the behavior\nstatements. For the traits, the Huynh-Feldt values were below\n.75, so multivariate tests were also run based on Hertzog and\nRovine's (1985) recommendation. F statistics from multivari-\nate tests are reported for the traits, which provided slightly\nreduced F statistics. Wilks'Lambda effect sizes are reported for\nthe traits. We ran the analyses using only the 40 community\nsample participants and highly significant differences were still\nfound for the facet analyses. The F statistic for openness to\nexperience was excessively large compared with the other trait\nWS SDs in the community sub-sample, suggesting extreme\ninflation. Overall, this suggests within-subject differences in\nbehavior statement ratings are not just statistical artifact due to\nthe sample size but are also meaningful.\nThe Within-Subject Standard Deviations (WS\nSDs)\nWe have established that true within-subject variation occurs\nin ratings for specific behaviors within a trait or facet attri-\nbute. To examine whether this within-subject variation is\npredictive of psychological outcomes, we calculated the WS\nSD of ratings in each trait and facet for each participant. The\ninitial step was to calculate the within-subject variance using\nthe conceptual variance equation (Equation 1).\n\nY\nN\n=\n-\n( )\n\nEquation 1: The conceptual variance equation.\nY is the participant's raw score of a single item.\nY\n-\nis the participant's mean across all the items (10 for the\nfacets; 40 for the traits)\nN is the number of observations per participant (10 for the\nfacets; 40 for the traits).\nAfter the within-subject variance was calculated; the\nsquare root of the value was used to obtain the WS SD for\neach participant. The average WS SD in most traits and fac-\nets was close to or greater than 1, which is large on a 5-point\nanalyses were conducted on the WS SDs, they achieved a\nreliability of  = .88 for the six trait WS SDs, whereas the\nanalysis for the 24 facets achieved a reliability of  = .87,\nsuggesting the WS SDs all measure similar variability\nconstructs.\nCorrelation Analyses Between the WS SDs and\nPsychological Outcomes\nThe following correlation analyses were run for each spe-\ncific WS SD, its total trait/facet score and the psychological\noutcomes. Table 2 displays the correlations between the WS\nSD values for each trait/facet and the outcome variables.\nMany negative correlations were found between the WS\nSDs and trait/facet score (ranging between -.17 and -.45),\nsuggesting that WS SDs reflect an opposing varied behavior\nstyle for these particular attributes. The expressiveness and\npatience WS SDs show positive relationships with the\nrespective trait/facet scores. Significant correlations\nbetween WS SDs and outcomes ranged in strength between\nAs some of these effect sizes were modest, bootstrapping\nanalyses of WS SDs (based on 1,000 simulated re-samples)\nin relation to an outcome were conducted to help determine\nwhether these findings were due to chance in this sample or\nare meaningful. If the confidence interval covered r = .00,\nthis means the correlation lost significance. This resulted in\na few of the correlations losing significance, although most\nretained significance suggesting the majority are meaning-\nful significant relationships.\nPartial correlations between the WS SDs and outcomes\ncontrolling for the trait/facet score were conducted. Table 3\ndisplays the correlations between the WS SD values and the\noutcome variables when partialling out the trait/facet score.\nTwo positive relationships to life satisfaction surfaced, with\nlost significance--between honesty\u00adhumility facet WS SDs\nand outcomes, although the sincerity WS SD and anxiety\nof the agreeableness facet relationships lost significance,\nalthough the flexibility WS SD to sensation seeking\nness WS SD relationships decreased in strength, but still\nretained significance, with self-pluralism, r(157) = .30, p <\n= .29, p < .001.

The findings here also sug-\ngest that it is important to examine variability indices (WS\nSDs) based on specific attributes from a personality model,\nin this case the HEXACO model, rather than one or two indi-\nces as past research in this area has done. The findings show\nthat this variability is related to positive and negative psy-\nchological outcomes, providing validity for the WS SD indi-\nces. The research here supports the need to take account of\nthis true variation in responses, which is ignored in the vast\nbulk of trait research. Admittedly, it is difficult to completely\nremove measurement error from the WS SD indices; how-\never, the Cronbach's alpha values for the trait and facet WS\nSD indices constructs suggest that these mainly reflect that\nwithin-subject variability in scoring is a true, meaningful\ninter-individual difference.\nMany of these relationships between WS SDs and out-\ncomes found were modest, as would be expected, based on\nBritt (1993), but bootstrapping re-sampling analyses helped\nconfirm the majority were meaningful relationships. As the\nWS SDs are calculated from the same items used to calculate\nthe trait/facet score confounding of measures is an issue. We\nfound that many trait/facet scores were related to their WS\nSDs, and also some WS SD--outcome relationships lost sig-\nnificance when partialling out trait/facet score and trait/facet\nscore squared. This suggests that within-subject variability is\nnot independent of traitedness in many cases, although some\nTable 3.

These are important factors that emphasize the\nneed to calculate WS SDs separately to trait/facet scores as\nwe did here. Other researchers in this area may find examin-\ning within-subject variation in responding, as well as the\nbetween-subject variation in scores valuable in their own\ndata, for surfacing new relationships or for checking data\nquality.\nIndividuals may display specific behaviors relevant to a\ntrait or facet to different degrees (at either end of a dimen-\nsion), which can affect psychological outcomes. Whether the\nvariations in questionnaire item ratings shown here represent\nreal variations in actual behavior cannot be answered directly\nfrom this study, although we are optimistic that this is so,\nbased on a diary study of personality states in different situa-\ntions measuring the HEXACO model (Churchyard, Pine,\nSharma, & Fletcher, 2013). This method will never be as\neffective as a diary study in measuring varied behavior\nstyles; however; it could act as a useful indictor of within-\nsubject variability in a single measurement occasion trait\nquestionnaire studies. To confirm this, diary studies could be\nconducted that initially collect trait questionnaire data using\na behavior statement questionnaire, before moving on to an\nadjective-based diary, to examine WS SD indices relation-\nship to repeated diary measurements in a multi-level model\nanalysis.\nWe would also suggest that being able to distinguish\nbetween meaningful and error variation--as our methods\nallow--is another reason to have more confidence the varia-\ntion will reflect actual behavior.

This sug-\ngests variation initially occurs to try and adapt. The relation-\nship of WS SDs to positive or negative outcomes likely\nreflects the feedback received from attempts at varied behav-\nior. These reflect varied behavioral styles developed over\ntime, which have become habitual, as they are strong enough\nto be significantly associated with an outcome. In our study,\nwe found variability in expressiveness to be associated with\na positive outcome (higher life satisfaction, lower anxiety,\ndepression, and self-pluralism), suggesting that variability in\nexpressive behavior has had consistently positive feedback;\nwhereas variability in conscientiousness and its facets, and\nalso sincerity, fairness, liveliness, and creativity variability\nwere associated with negative outcomes (higher anxiety,\ndepression, and self-pluralism), suggesting these are due to\nconsistent negative feedback. The fact that only those WS\nSDs consistently related to anxiety and depression were also\nrelated to self-pluralism suggests this self-perceived varia-\ntion is an aspect of negative affect, which results of from\npoor adaptation behaviors that differ from natural trait style.\nResearch supports this since individuals higher in negative\naffect are more sensitive to punishment (Torrubia, Cesar,\nMolto, & Caseras, 2001), and will therefore associate this\nvariation with a negative result strongly with negative affect.\nOf course, personality trait questionnaires are specifically\ndesigned to include a set of behaviorally representative items\nfor each trait, and so we would expect the variation between\nitems to also be representative.\nWhen the WS SD relationships to psychological outcomes\nwere examined, the significant relationships were focused\naround particular attributes, rather than being spread across all\nthe WS SDs examined, as might be expected if variation in a\ngeneral capacity was responsible. This suggests that it is the\nvariability of a particular personality attribute, and not a gen-\neral capacity for variation, that determines outcome relation-\nships, even if all the WS SDs are tapped into a similar\nvariability construct. This leads to an important question in\npersonality trait research where WS SD variability is not rou-\ntinely reported. Is the positive directionality of personality trait\nand facet constructs measured itself confounding reported\nrelationships? A normal trait score on a personality trait or\nfacet reflects only the between-subject differences of that attri-\nbute, and does not reflect any within-subject variation on that\ntrait or facet but--by definition--the WS SD scores subsume\nand account more for negative as well as positive item ratings.\nThe positive directionality of most of the personality trait and\nfacet attributes measured here, where a higher score reflects a\nmore positive quality (all except those associated with trait\nemotionality), may have led to more of the significant WS SD\nrelationships found being associated with negative outcomes\n(negative relationships to life satisfaction and positive rela-\ntionships to anxiety, depression, and self-pluralism). It may be\nthat having a more negatively directed questionnaire, where\nhigher scores indicate negative qualities, would change mat-\nters and reveal new insights into personality expression.\nExamples in this study include the positive relationships of the\nemotionality and sentimentality WS SDs to the positive out-\ncome of sensation seeking. Because we have only examined a\nlimited number of psychological outcomes here, we need to\nremain circumspect about this.\nAt least 10 statements or items were available to calculate\nthe WS SDs for each trait (or facet), providing the WS SDs\nwith validity as an index of variability. The sample size pro-\nvided decent statistical power to find significant findings.\nThe calculation of the sensation seeking measure involved\ntotal facet scores from seven facets, so this could have raised\na potential confound in the analyses between the WS SDs for\nthese facets and the sensation seeking score. However, of the\nseven facets used to calculate this, only the fairness WS SD\nwas (weakly) associated with sensation seeking. The selec-\ntion of different facet attribute scores involved in the calcula-\ntion likely dilutes the impact of each specific facet attribute.\nIn addition, the WS SDs rather than trait scores are exam-\nined, which reduces the potential confound even further.\nWe did not measure behavior in context, although we sug-\ngested that specific behavior item ratings would reflect con-\ntextual-dependent behavior within the trait/facet (supported\nby Lievens et al., 2008). Future research could examine this\nby using shorter trait/facet questionnaires that allow the par-\nticipant to note the context they think suits a specific behav-\nior. The behaviors that are frequently assigned a particular\ncontext could be examined together in a reliability analysis\nto see whether they reveal contextually specific behavior\nsets. We would predict more different contexts assigned for\nthose with higher WS SDs.\nThis study raises important issues in personality trait test\nresearch. In particular, it considers how variability in one\npersonality trait/facet may affect, or be affected by, the\nexpression of another personality trait/facet, and how this\ncould affect psychological outcomes. The use of WS SD\nscores is core to answering these questions. In this study, we\nexamined the relationships of WS SDs to other psychological\noutcomes and have partialled out trait/facet scores. It is pos-\nsible that other subject level characteristics, such as intelli-\nan impact on WS SDs. Future research might consider par-\ntialling out the impact of other subject characteristics. It does\nseem important that future personality research calculate WS\nSDs in multiple-item trait scales to examine the questions\nraised by this research.\nThis research was conducted to determine the validity of\nitem-level within-subject variation of ratings in personality\ntrait questionnaires, by examining the impact of variability\nindices in relation to a selection of psychological outcomes.\nMost of the attributes measured displayed a degree of within-\nsubject variation considered to be true variation, rather than\ndue to error. This within-subject variation was found to be\nassociated with positive and negative psychological outcomes,\ndepending on the attribute displaying the variation. This sug-\ngested that item-level within-subject variability is a valid psy-\nchological construct to analyze in behavior statement based\npersonality trait questionnaires. There may be considerable\nvalue in examining this in existing data collected from previ-\nous trait studies using a behavior statement questionnaire,\nbecause it is likely to reveal new meaningful individual differ-\nences in those who completed them. We would recommend\nthat future research examining personality traits and other out-\ncomes using behavior statement based trait questionnaires also\nreport this variability, considering the ease with which it can\nbe calculated, and the added meaningful information on\nwithin-subject variability in relation to psychological out-\ncomes that it provides.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAltrocchi, J., & McReynolds, P.
