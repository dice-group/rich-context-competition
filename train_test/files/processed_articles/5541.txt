Here, the proteins are cleaved by\nsite-1 and site-2 proteases and are maturated\nto a soluble transcription factor that stimu-\nlates the expression of their target genes.\nThese genes encode enzymes with important\nroles in the synthesis and uptake pathways of\ncholesterol and triglyceride.20\nresults in substitution of a glycine by an\nSREBP-2 protein; it has been shown to be\nassociated with intima\u00admedia thickness (a\nmarker of atherosclerosis) and total choles-\nterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic\npatients, and with elevated plasma lipid\nreported a significant association between\ndevelopment of OA.23 In addition, the GA\nhas been shown to be significantly associated\nwith the risk of avascular necrosis of the\nfemoral head in Chinese Han24 and Korean\npopulations.25 On the basis of these studies,\npossible correlations between the SNPs\nand susceptibility to knee OA were investi-\ngated in a Chinese Han population. As the\nnucleotides, it was not necessary to perform\nhaplotype analysis.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nIn this hospital-based case\u00adcontrol study,\nconsecutive Han Chinese patients diagnosed\nwith knee arthritis between March 2007 and\nOrthopaedics, Sir Run Run Shaw\nHospital, Zhejiang University School of\nMedicine, Hangzhou, China, were evaluated\nfor inclusion. Anteroposterior extended-\nview weightbearing radiographs of the\naffected knees were obtained. Radiographic\nfeatures were assessed by two examiners\nblinded to the clinical information to give a\nglobal Kellgren\u00adLawrence (KL) score ran-\nging between 0 and 4, as previously\ndescribed.26 Only patients with radiographic\nOA, defined as a KL score of !2, were\nincluded in the study. Other aetiologies of\nknee joint disease such as inflammatory\narthritis (rheumatoid, polyarthritic\nor autoimmune disease), post-traumatic or\npostseptic arthritis, skeletal dysplasia or\ndevelopmental dysplasia were excluded.\nAge- (\u00c65 years) and sex-matched healthy\nvolunteers were recruited from the same\nhospital during the same period. Selection\ncriteria for the controls included no history\nof OA and a KL score <2 on radiographic\nexamination. Age, sex, weight, height and\nbody mass index (BMI) were recorded for all\nstudy participants.\nWritten informed consent was provided\nby all participants and the study protocol\nwas approved by the Ethics Committee of\nthe Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang\nUniversity School of Medicine, Hangzhou,\nChina.\nGenotyping\nVenous blood samples were obtained from\nall study participants using ethylenediamine\ntetra-acetic acid anticoagulant (20 g/l).\nGenomic DNA was extracted immediately\nfrom 200 ml of venous blood using a\nQIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen,\nValencia, CA, USA) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions and stored at \u00c080C\nusing the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,\nUSA). The polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) was performed using 100 ng of gen-\nof each probe, 200 mM of each deoxyribo-\nnucleotide, 3 mM MgCl2\nand 1 U Platinum\nTaq DNA polymerase. PCR amplification\nwas carried out using the 7900HT Fast Real-\nTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions, with an initial denaturation at 95C\nfor 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of\ndenaturation at 95C for 15 s and annealing\nat 65C for 30 s. Data analyses were per-\nDetection System software version 2.3\n(Applied Biosystems). Approximately 5%\nof the samples were randomly selected for\nrepeated genotyping, for confirmation.\nStatistical analyses\nThe Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium was\ntested using a goodness-of-fit 2-test to\ncompare observed and expected genotype\nfrequencies in controls. Differences in the\ndistributions of demographic characteristics\nbetween patients with OA and controls\nwere evaluated using the Wilcoxon's test\nfor analysis of age and the 2-test for all\nother variances. Associations between the\nSREBP-2 variants and OA risk were esti-\nmated by calculating the odds ratios (ORs)\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using\nboth univariate and multivariate logistic\nregression analysis with adjustments for\nage, sex and BMI. Two-sided tests were\nused for statistical analyses and a\nP-value < 0.05 was considered to be statis-\ntically significant. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

When\nstratified by sex, both male and female\npatients showed significant differences in\ngenotype frequencies between patients with\nOA and controls (P < 0.01) (Table 3). In\naddition, GC heterozygotes carried a 1.55-\nand 2.46-fold increased risk of knee OA in\nmales and females, respectively, compared\nwith GG homozygotes (Table 3).\nIn contrast, logistic regression analysis of\nshowed that the GA and AA genotypes\nwere not significantly associated with knee\nOA susceptibility when stratified by age or\nsex (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn the present hospital-based case\u00adcontrol\nstudy, associations between the potentially\nSREBP-2 and the risk of knee OA were\ninvestigated in a Chinese Han population.\npolymorphic GC genotype of SREBP-2 and\nvariant C may contribute to the risk of knee\nOA, and that this risk was increased in older\nTable 1.

Further\nresearch is therefore needed to elucidate the\nrole of other functional SNPs of SREBP-2\nand other related genes involved in similar\nbiological pathways that may be involved in\nthe aetiology of OA.\nStudies have shown a significant associ-\nation between the GA genotype of the\nof avascular necrosis of the femoral head in\na Chinese Han24 and Korean populations.25\nHowever, in the present study, the GA and\ncantly associated with the risk of knee OA.\nIn addition, further stratification analysis\naccording to age or sex did not reveal any\nsignificant associations between knee OA\nThe present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, as a hospital-based\nstudy, it may be subject to inherent biases;\nhowever, the C allele frequency in the con-\ntrol subjects was similar to that in the\nhaplotype map database, and the genotype\nconformed to the Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium, suggesting that the results did not\nsuffer from selection bias. Secondly, the\nsample size was relatively modest, therefore\nthe results should be confirmed in larger\nscale studies. Thirdly, only two SREBP-2\nSNPs were investigated; SNPs at other loci\nmay also be associated with susceptibility\nto OA.\nIn conclusion, the present study was the\nfirst to show that the genotype distribution\nwas significantly different between\npatients with knee OA and healthy controls\nin a Chinese Han population. Larger\npopulation-based and in-depth molecular\nstudies are required, to validate these cur-\nrent findings and to elucidate the functional\naetiology of OA.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported partly by a grant from\nthe Health Bureau of Zhejiang Province, China\nkey project of Zhejiang Provincial Department of\nZhejiang Provincial Natural Science\nthe Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang\nand the Medical Scientific Research Foundation\n"
