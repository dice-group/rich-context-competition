    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper explores the extent to which changes in medication use during the\n1990s are linked to improvements in functioning among Americans before they reach re-\ntirement age. Using two cross-sections from a survey of Americans ages 51\u00ad61, we exam-\nined changes between 1992 and 1998 in the prevalence of functional limitations and med-\nication use associated with five chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, lung disease,\nstroke, and arthritis. We found no evidence linking increases in medication use to improve-\nments in functioning. Instead, increases in educational attainment offset the negative ef-\nfects of increases in obesity and arthritis over this period. Findings underscore the need for\ncaution in projecting forward improvements in old-age functioning when considering the fu-\nture of Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that serve the elderly with disabilities.\nAfter nearly a decade of debate\namong academics and policymakers, a\nconsensus is emerging that disability\nrates among older Americans have declined\nover the past fifteen years.1 If such declines\ncontinue into the future, their effect on the\nnation's health and economic well-being\ncould be far-reaching, with more older Amer-\nicans able to work longer and relatively fewer\nneeding medical and long-term care. How-\never, the implications of such trends for pub-\nlicly funded programs such as Medicare,\nMedicaid, and Social Security remain far from\nclear, in part because it is uncertain whether\nsuch declines will continue. While some have\nsuggested that continued declines of 1.5 per-\ncent per year are plausible, others have cau-\ntioned that future trends may not mirror\nthose of the past decade.2\nTo understand the consequences of disabil-\nity declines for publicly financed programs, we\nneed better insight into the causes of the trend.\nCurrent hypotheses may be classified broadly\ninto long-term and shorter-term factors. Long-\nterm factors might include better nutrition,\nimprovements in the public health infrastruc-\nture, and widespread use of infectious disease\ntreatments such as antibiotics. More recent\nexplanations include changes in the socioeco-\nnomic status of older Americans, healthier life-\nstyles, increased use of assistive technologies,\nless restrictive environments, and better treat-\nment of chronic diseases through medical pro-\ncedures and medication use.\nIndeed, use of medications has become an\nincreasingly important aspect of health care\nfor older Americans, and the development of\ndrugs aimed at some of the more debilitating\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\n\u00a92003 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nVickiFreedmanisthedirectorandHakanAykan,apolicyanalyst,atthePolisherResearchInstitute,Madlynand\nLeonardAbramsonCenterforJewishLife(formerly,PhiladelphiaGeriatricCenter),inHorsham,Pennsylvania.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In both\nyears respondents were instructed to report\nhow much difficulty they had with various\nphysical tasks (for example, reaching, stoop-\ning, and lifting) because of a health or physical\nproblem.9 The survey also obtained informa-\ntion about height and weight (from which we\ncalculated obesity) and the history of and cur-\nrent medication use for five chronic condi-\ntions: hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung\ndisease, stroke, and arthritis.10\nn Reliability of self-reports. Previous\nstudies generally show excellent agreement\nbetween administrative or medical records\nand self-reports for chronic conditions such as\nhypertension, diabetes, and stroke.11 Studies of\nthe reliability and validity of reported medica-\ntion use are less common and with one excep-\ntion involve foreign populations.12 Moreover, a\nstudy of the influence of question structure on\nrecall of medication use found that when ques-\ntions were linked to specific conditions, as\nthey are in the HRS, 88 percent of medications\nwere accurately recalled.13\nn Analysis theory and structure. Our\nanalysis draws upon a well-established depic-\ntion of the disablement process.14 Whether pa-\nthology and impairments lead to limitations in\nfunctioning is mediated in part by predispos-\ning factors (such as demographic, social, and\nbehavioral factors) and by intervening factors\n(such as medication use, medical care, and\nchanges in behavior in response to diagnosis).\nIntervening factors are inserted during the dis-\nablement process, and the timing of their effects\nmay be immediate, delayed, or cumulative.15\nOur analysis involves four steps. We first\npresent descriptive statistics on chronic con-\nditions, medication use, and functioning in\ndemographic composition of the preretire-\nment-age population and in functioning for\nthese subgroups. Next we present for the en-\ntire preretirement-age population and each\nchronic condition group the mean change in\nseries of regression models.16 Our focus is on\nwhether the change in functioning between\nother factors--namely, the demographic com-\nposition of the population (including age, sex,\nrace, ethnicity, education, marital status, and\nownership of liquid assets); the chronic dis-\nease profile (as measured by obesity [body\nmass index > 30] and indicators of the history\nof the five conditions of interest in this study);\nand the rate of medication use for the five con-\nditions--are taken into account. Finally, to ex-\nplore whether medications have become more\neffective over time in relation to functioning,\nwe test whether improvements have been\ngreater for groups who used medications than\nfor those who did not.\nStudy Results\n1998 the reported prevalence of diabetes,\nT r e n d s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 2 , N u m b e r 4 1 5 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The prevalence of obesity also in-\ncreased dramatically, but reports of hyperten-\nsion and lung disease declined.17\nStatistically significant increases in reports\nof medication use occurred among people with\npercent of respondents ages 51\u00ad61 with hyper-\ntension reported taking medications, up from\nage group with diabetes reported medication\nthree conditions, medication use did not\nchange appreciably.\nDuring the same period the average number\nof functional limitations reported by people\n(Exhibit 2). Fewer limitations were reported\nby subgroups of respondents with hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis. Only peo-\nple with lung disease did not report signifi-\ncans ages 51\u00ad61 were slightly younger and\nmore likely to be Hispanic, to be unmarried,\nand to have completed years of education\nbeyond high school than they were in 1990s\n(Exhibit 3). With the notable exception of\nnonwhites, all other groups experienced sig-\nnificant improvements in functioning between\nn Demographic factors and functional\nchanges. Before controlling for any other fac-\nof limitations declined by \u00ad0.40 (Exhibit 5).\nShifts in the use of medication for the five con-\nditions considered here do not explain the de-\ncline, which would have been \u00ad0.44 had no\nchange in use occurred.\nHowever, demographic factors accounted\nfor about 40 percent of the decline, attenuat-\ning it to \u00ad0.24. That is, increases in educational\nattainment and the shift toward the younger\nages appear to account for much of the im-\nprovement. Controlling for changes in the\nchronic condition profile increases the change\nover time to \u00ad0.31. That is, had chronic condi-\ntions not increased over this time period, limi-\ntations would have declined even more than\nthey did. Adding information about medica-\ntion use after considering these other factors\ndoes not change this finding appreciably. That\nis, medication use does not appear to account\nfor any of the improvements in functioning be-\nyond those explained by shifts in the demo-\ngraphic and chronic-condition profiles of this\npopulation.\nSimilar results are evident when we focus\non subgroups of people with specific chronic\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nPercentage Of Americans Ages 51\u00ad61 Reporting Selected Chronic Conditions And\nPercent reporting chronic condition\nPercent reporting medication use\n(among those reporting condition)\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nLung disease\nStroke\nArthritis\nObesity\n\u00adb\n\u00adb\n\u00ad\nSOURCE: Authors' analysis of data from the Health and Retirement Study.\na Percentage points.\nb Medication use for obesity was not ascertained.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Changes in the chronic-condition pro-\nfile work in the opposite direction, offsetting\nsome of the decline. For four of the five condi-\ntions, medication use does not further explain\nany of the declines. Only among those report-\ning a stroke does the coefficient on year atten-\nuate when information about medication use\neffect is statistically different from finding no\nchange.\nn Medication use and functional limita-\ntions. If changes in the type of medication--\nand consequently changes in the effectiveness\nof treatment--are contributing to improve-\nments in functioning, we would expect to see\ngreater improvements in functioning among\nthose reporting medication use compared\nwith those who are not using medications. We\nexplore these relationships in Exhibit 6.\nTwo patterns are noteworthy. First, for all\nfive conditions, people reporting medication\nuse had more functional limitations on average\nthan did those who reported no medication\nuse. The relationship likely reflects disease se-\nverity: That is, those having more severe\nchronic conditions were more likely to be put\non medication and also were more likely to\nhave functional impairments.\nSecond, the improvements do not appear to\nbe greater for those reporting medication use.\nFor those reporting diabetes, only those not\ntaking medications experienced improve-\nments in functioning over time.

For lung\ndisease, stroke, and arthritis, reports of medi-\ncation use remained stable. Although there is\nclearly more medication use among this age\ngroup, we were unable to find statistical evi-\ndence linking medication use to improve-\nments in functioning for the conditions con-\nsidered here.\nn Limitations. This study is limited in\nseveral important respects. First, our analysis\nis limited to reports of medication use associ-\nated with only five chronic conditions. It may\nbe that medication use for other disease proc-\nesses has played an integral role in improving\nfunctioning. For example, pharmacological\ntreatment of depression has increased mark-\nrelieving gastrointestinal discomfort, the\nsymptoms of menopause (primarily in the\nform of estrogen therapy), and back pain also\nclearly have implications for quality of life but\nwere beyond the scope of this study.\nSecond, we have not considered medical\ntreatments beyond pharmacological agents.\nFor example, surgical treatments for vision\nloss because of cataracts and glaucoma and for\nhip and knee replacements have also increased\ndramatically over the past decade. If the rela-\ntive importance of medical treatment to recent\ntrends in old-age functioning is to be fully un-\nderstood, further study of the contribution of\nthese important procedures is warranted.\nThird, data limitations kept us from ad-\ndressing what types of medications people\nwere using in each year. However, we did not\nfind evidence consistent with aggregate im-\nprovements in the effectiveness of medication\nfor the five conditions considered here.\nFourth, our analysis focuses on people ages\n51\u00ad61. But the largest improvements in func-\ntioning have been observed for much older\npeople.19 It may be that the beneficial effects of\nmedication use in midlife are not fully appar-\nent until later in life. Follow-up analyses with\nfuture waves of the HRS could provide valu-\nable insight into the cumulative benefits of\nmedication use in midlife.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, be-\ncause of changes in question wording in the\ndata we drew upon, we excluded from our\nmeasure of functioning several mobility items\nthat are typically included in functional limi-\ntation scales (for example, walking one or sev-\neral blocks, or climbing one or several flights of\nstairs). It may be that medication use has a\ngreater effect on mobility than on other body\nfunctions included here. As newer data be-\ncome available to examine the link between\nmedication use and mobility-related impair-\nments, this question should be addressed.\nn Education factor. Notwithstanding\nthese limitations, our analysis suggests that\nchanges in the rate of medication use and its\neffectiveness do not appear to be driving re-\ncent improvements in functioning at ages 51\u00ad\n61. Instead we find, consistent with previous\nstudies, that increases in educational attain-\nment appear to be an important factor.20 Had\nyears of schooling not increased, functioning\nwould have improved only half as much as it\namong older Americans will continue to in-\ncrease over the next several decades, but not at\nthe rates observed during the 1980s and early\nscore the need for caution in projecting for-\nward improvements in old-age functioning\nwhen considering the future of Medicare,\nMedicaid, and other programs that serve the\nolder population with disabilities.\nn Obesity. Also noteworthy are the large\nincreases in some of the most disabling condi-\ntions in this preretirement-age group. Notably,\nobesity increased more than 25 percent in just\nsix years. Other studies have confirmed an\nobesity epidemic occurring in the United\nStates that reaches down the age spectrum, af-\nfecting one in four of America's children.22\nObesity has been linked not only to disability\nbut also to costly conditions such as heart dis-\nease, stroke, and diabetes. Studies of the impli-\ncations of impending increases in obesity for\nfuture disability rates and related medical\ncosts are clearly a critical next step.\nn Narrowed racial gap.

In further analyses\n(not shown), we explored whether this lack of\nimprovement could be attributed to dispro-\nportionately low medication use but found the\nopposite: For the five conditions considered\nhere, nonwhites had higher rates of medication\nuse relative to whites, even after we controlled\nfor other health and socioeconomic differences\nacross these groups. These findings may signal\nyet another cautionary note: The recent nar-\nrowing of the racial gap in old-age disability\nmay yet again reverse course as the remaining\nmembers of the birth cohorts considered here\nn Future research agenda. Finally, our\nanalysis suggests that researchers may need to\nrefocus their search for the causes of recent im-\nprovements in late-life functioning. While our\nfindings do not rule out substantial future\ncontributions of pharmaceuticals to the qual-\nity of life of older persons, researchers may do\nwell to focus on other factors, particularly\nthose linked to educational attainment.\nThisresearchwasfundedbyasupplementfromthe\nOfficeoftheAssistantSecretaryforPlanningand\nEvaluation,U.S.DepartmentofHealthandHuman\nServices,totheNationalInstituteonAging,Grantno.\naloneanddonotreflecttheopinionsofthefunding\nagencies.\nNOTES\n1.
