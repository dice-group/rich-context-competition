For example,\nless than one-third of patients reported knowledge of all\nmodifiable risk factors in some studies.8,11 In a recent\nstudy of 260 women following myocardial infarction\n(MI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), only a\nfew identified hypertension (5%), hypercholesterolae-\nCV risk factors.12 Wartak et al.13 found that patients'\noverall knowledge was good, with 37% of patients able\nto identify the effect of all seven factors. Patient knowl-\nedge was greatest for harmful factors and lowest for pre-\ndictive behaviours.\nKnowledge of CV risk factors can vary with the\noccurrence of CV events. Recent research has demon-\nstrated greater knowledge of coronary risk factors\namong patients who have experienced MI than among\nthose who have received a coronary angiography.8\nPatients' knowledge and beliefs about CVD are impor-\ntant because studies have demonstrated that perceived\npersonal susceptibility can increase prevention-seeking\nAccording to most studies, the level of knowledge of CV\nrisk factors is influenced by sociodemographic factors.13,15,16\nMultivariate analysis studies have identified education,15\nage, marital status, and sex5 as significant sociodemographic\npredictors of knowledge of CV risk factors. Using a multi-\nvariate model, Wartak et al.13 found that knowledge of all\nseven components was positively associated with high\nschool education or greater (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% con-\nof CV risk factors has been associated with an increase in\nhealth-promoting behaviour.5,8,17 It is known that CV risk\nfactors and the prevalence of CVD are linked to education\nand socioeconomic status.6,8 More recently, it has become\napparent that the risk of heart failure and mortality after MI\nmechanisms are not clear, low educational attainment is also\nreported as an indirect cause of CVD through its influence\non lifestyle, unhealthy diets, and beliefs.18\u00ad20\nThe objective of this study was to assess trends in the\nknowledge of CV risk factors in patients five years after\ncoronary angiography, and to evaluate the associations\nbetween awareness of CV risk factors and educational level.\nMethods\nDesign\nData were derived from a follow-up study of 4391 patients\nwho underwent coronary angiography at the National\nInstitute for Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology\nDeterminants and Health Status - ESANDE' research pro-\nject.16 The patient selection procedure of the ESANDE\nstudy involved systematic recruitments to undergo coro-\nnary angiography, and the study was prospective in nature.\nThe patients were contacted again in the context of the\nMonitoring and Dynamics of Health Status through the\nRisk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (MDYNRFC)\nproject, which aimed to assess the evolution of health sta-\ntus and CV risk behaviour. This follow-up study was con-\nFor the follow-up study, a self-completed questionnaire\nwas sent by post. In cases in which the patient had died, the\nfamily were asked to mention the date of death on the\nquestionnaire. In total, 1837 questionnaires were returned\n(with 548 notifications of patient death), resulting in a\n2009. Finally, excluding patients who died, information on\n1289 patients was used in the longitudinal cohort study.\nThe questionnaire was composed of two parts: the first\nconsisted of all questions used at baseline, and the second\nincluded new questions designed to measure health status\ndynamics and risk factors for CVD, such as smoking sta-\ntus, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia, physical\nactivity and relative weight, in the context of a longitudi-\nnal approach.\nEthical approval and administrative\narrangements\nThe investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the National\nResearch Ethics Committee and the National Commission\nfor Data Protection. Informed consent was obtained from\nall participants. The National Commission for Data\nProtection approved the survey design and the content of\nthe questionnaires. This study is part of the MDYNRFC-\nproject, and is funded by the National Research Fund.\nMeasures\nKnowledge of CV risk factors was assessed based on\nunprompted responses to the survey question: `Can you\ncite what are the main cardiovascular risk factors?' This\nquestion was similar to questions used in other studies,\nsuch as: `Can you tell me what are the major causes of\nheart disease or heart problems?'.3 In the study by Lynch\net al.,21 participants were asked, `What do you think are the\nmost important causes of heart attack and stroke?'. Our\nquestion focused on the ability to cite five modifiable risk\nfactors. This formulation of the question allowed us to\nunderstand or appeal to the patient's knowledge with\nrespect to the probable causes of heart disease. We also\nfeel that this formulation is more representative because\nquestions with fixed answers, such as `yes', `no', `true', or\n`false', allow people lacking knowledge to guess the cor-\nrect answer. This may overestimate patient knowledge.22\nThe five most cited modifiable CV risk factors identified\nby the participants were smoking, diabetes, hypertension,\nhypercholesterolaemia and obesity. We supposed that the\nability to cite a CV risk factor was evidence of knowledge\nof this CV risk factor.\nThe CV events considered were angina pectoris (AP),\nacute MI and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Events were\ndiagnosed by physicians or medical specialists in\navailable demographic variables (sex and age group), soci-\noeconomic variables (level of education), and CV risk fac-\ntors (smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension status,\ncholesterol status and obesity). All variables are defined in\nTable 1. Unfortunately, physical activity was rarely indi-\ncated by patients, and thus was not included in the five\nmodifiable risk factors quoted by patients.\nStatistical analysis\nThe descriptive statistical analyses were mainly stratified\naccording to sex and education level. In the first stage, the\npatients' knowledge of several CV risk factors (at least\nthree), and of each individual CV risk factor was analysed\naccording to education level and sex. In the second stage,\nthe patients'knowledge of the same CV risk factor was pre-\nsented according to education level and stratified by diagno-\nsis. We calculated the rate ratios of knowledge of patients\nwith the highest educational level compared to patients with\nthe lowest educational level (rate ratiohighest-lowest\n). This indi-\ncator allowed us to monitor the gap in knowledge between\ngroups and over time. Due to the poor knowledge of CV\nrisk factors among patients in the survey, we considered\nthe ability to cite at least three CV risk factors as an indica-\ntor of knowledge of several CV risk factors. The cut-off of\nthree CV risk factors as an indicator of knowledge level\nwas determined in a post-hoc manner.\nLogistic regression models were used to assess the\nassociation between educational level and knowledge of\nCVD risk factors adjusted by age and sex. The first model\nassessed the probability of citing at least three CV risk fac-\ntors by educational level, adjusted by age and sex. The\nother models, concerning the probability of citing one CV\nrisk factor, were adjusted by the patients' exposure to the\nsame CV risk factor to avoid its influence on the analysis.\nFor example, we assumed that a patient with hypertension\nshould be able to identify it as a CV risk factor more fre-\nquently than a patient without hypertension.\nWe reduced potential bias by only using the data of\nComparing participants with non-participants indicated no\nmajor differences.\nAll data management and statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, North\nCarolina, USA).\nResults\nThe distribution of sociodemographic characteristics and\nis presented in Table 1.

However, compared to\nPoor knowledge of CV risk factors and\npersistence of socioeconomic differences five\nyears after coronary angiography\nOur findings demonstrated that knowledge of CV risk fac-\ntors increased during the five-year follow-up period in the\nentire cohort, while differences between the highest edu-\ncated patients and the lowest educated patients in both men\nand women decreased. The ability to quote at least three\nrisk factors increased more in women than in men in rela-\ntive terms. Poor knowledge of CV risk factors was also\nobserved in patients undergoing elective CABG, as\nreported by Karthik et al.23\nEven in population-based studies, knowledge of estab-\nlished modifiable CVD risk factors is low, particularly\namong the lowest educated groups.21 In Canada, individ-\nual knowledge of risk factors for CVD is poor, and it has\nbeen reported that older Canadians do not possess suffi-\ncient knowledge about CVD to improve their health.1\nExcept for smoking tobacco, which was reliably iden-\ntified as a CV risk factor, <40% of the patients reported\nknowledge of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol,\n(both men and women) were able to cite at least five mod-\nifiable CV risk factors (figures not shown). However,\nother studies have reported significant differences in the\nknowledge of CV risk factors between men and\nwomen.3,8,24 For example, some studies have shown that\nknowledge of coronary risk factors remains relatively\nlowing MI or CABG, women mainly attributed their coro-\nnary heart disease to smoking (44%) and family history\n(40%),12 while only a few women identified hypertension\n(5%), hypercholesterolaemia (14%), obesity (15%) and a\nhigh-fat diet (16%) as risk factors.12 In contrast, our find-\nings showed that men tended to possess better knowledge\nof the various CV risk factors than women, but this was\nnot statistically significant.\nIn the present study, socioeconomic differences in the\nknowledge of risk factors among patients were still present\nfive years after the initial assessment, although they all\ndecreased significantly with the exception of hypertension\nin women. These results are useful, and will help in the\ndevelopment of specific and targeted intervention pro-\ngrammes within the context of secondary prevention.\nKnowledge of CV risk factors was influenced by\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteristics\nand experience with different CV risk factors\nIn this study, younger patients had better knowledge or\nawareness of CV risk factors than elderly patients in both\nlack of a significant difference between women and men\nings demonstrated a decrease in the knowledge gap\nbetween patients who had or had not experienced CV risk\nour results confirmed that educational level was a strong\npredictor of the knowledge of risk factors for CVD, even\nin patients with such risks factors. Moreover, educational\nlevel was not associated with knowledge of diabetes as a\nsocioeconomic status, and particularly education, was a\nstrong and consistent predictor of risk factor aware-\nconditions during the early part of a person's life, and is\nassociated with knowledge of CVD risk factors.24 A study\nreported by Kayaniyil et al.27 found that cardiac inpatients\nwith lower than high school education had significantly\nworse knowledge of coronary heart disease risk factors.\nPsychosocial parameters may also play a role; patients\nwith higher education levels are more motivated to seek\ninformation regarding healthy lifestyle habits,26 and\nTable 4.

Knowledge of CV risk factors exists within\na system of beliefs (incorporating psychosocial and bio-\nmedical issues), not in isolation.21,29 Furthermore, few\nreports have suggested that educational attainment is an\nindirect cause of coronary heart disease.20 Conversely,\none study showed that education level is not predictive of\nknowledge of CVD.2\nImplications of results from a secondary\nprevention perspective\nIn the context of secondary prevention, it should be\nexpected that differences in the knowledge and aware-\nness of CV risk factors would be reduced or disappear\ncompletely over time. Indeed, any patient, regardless of\nsocioeconomic status, can become aware of the differ-\nent risks and ways to combat them because care after a\ncardiac event aims to restore quality of life and main-\ntain or improve functional capacity.30,31 Most CVD\npatients benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation pro-\ngramme in the secondary prevention framework after a\ncardiac event.\nThe results of the present study demonstrated both\nimproved knowledge and a reduction in differences associ-\nated with knowledge among patients five years after coro-\nnary angiography. These changes probably represent the\nconsequences of various interventions during the five-year\nfollow-up period. However, our findings also demon-\nstrated poor knowledge of CV risk factors that persisted\namong patients despite the fact that the risk factors were\nprevalent in the patient group. This information should\nraise concerns, and needs to be addressed in order to\nimprove outcomes in patients with CVD.16\nThe results of this study highlighted the fact that\nimprovements in patient knowledge of CV risk factors\noccur slowly. Knowledge and/or awareness of CV risk fac-\ntors is often not sufficient to bring about change. For\nexample, the transtheoretical model is a heuristic model\nthat describes the sequence of steps in successful behav-\nioural change: (a) precontemplation (no recognition of\nneed for or interest in change); (b) contemplation (thinking\nabout changing); (c) preparation (planning for change); (d)\naction (adopting new habits); and (e) maintenance (on-\ngoing practice of new, healthier behaviour).7,32\nThe presence of a high global CV risk in patients with\nlower levels of education might be attributed to poor com-\nmunication between doctor and patient and/or an insuffi-\ncient understanding by the patient of the importance of the\nproper management of CV risk factors.33,34 This is another\nreason why the results of this study may prove important\nin the development of effective educational and secondary\nprevention strategies. In the future, it will be important to\ncollect long-term data on the knowledge and awareness of\nrisk factors within different social groups after coronary\nangiography. This will allow prevention programmes to be\nspecifically targeted to help poorly educated or lower soci-\noeconomic patients.26\nLimitations and strengths\nThe results of this study are not representative of all patients\nwith CVD in Luxembourg.16,35 However, the INCCI is a\nreference national service for coronary angiography in\nLuxembourg. As our study was based on a relatively long-\nterm follow-up (five years), a substantial number of patients\ndied or did not live at their reported address at the end of\nthis period. This could have affected the composition of our\ncohort, leading to bias. To avoid such bias, we concentrated\ninformation regarding diagnosis, CV risk factors, quality of\nlife, lifestyle changes and health status. Much of the data\nare self-reported or measured by physicians or medical spe-\nobserved that patient knowledge of CV risk factors was\nvery poor in all socioeconomic groups, and was particu-\nlarly modified by education level.
