Once en-\nrolled in hospice, patients receive comfort\ncare and forgo all curative treatments for their\nterminal illness and related conditions.

This latter in-\ncrease could be related to recent improve-\nments in medical treatments that might have\nprompted patients to pursue new curative op-\ntions until shortly before death, resulting in\nshorter lengths of hospice service use.16 Our re-\nsults might also indicate the diffusion of hos-\npice care into current medical practice as a\nnew medical specialty, with many patients go-\ning into hospice as part of their ordinary care\nwhen death is imminent. Researchers, clini-\ncians, and insurance companies have recently\nrealized the importance of palliative care in the\nearlier stages of the chronic care continuum\nand are trying to combine life-prolonging\ntreatments when appropriate, palliation of\nsymptoms, and support for caregivers as a po-\ntentially more effective form of end-of-life\ncare.17 This open-access approach could\nremove some barriers to hospice access and\naffect hospice use in the future.\nAlthough recent studies indicate that even\nvery brief hospice stays can be beneficial,\nsymptom management is often difficult to\nachieve over a week or two.18 Our results show\nthat among adult hospice patients in 1999\u00ad\ndays of hospice service, while about half of\nthem had 0\u00ad15 days. Although little is known\nabout the optimal length of a hospice stay, ear-\nlier hospice enrollment might improve the\nmanagement of patients' symptoms and sup-\nport for family caregivers.\nn Changes in the hospice population.\nOur results indicate that the percentage of\nadult hospice patients with Medicare as their\nprimary payer increased and that there was a\nsubstantial shift toward the oldest-old (age\neighty-five and older). These patients consti-\ntuted almost one-fourth of all adult hospice\npice patients with noncancer diagnoses or ex-\nisting Alzheimer's disease or dementia also\ngreatly increased during this period. We also\nnote that the decrease we found in the number\nof hospice patients ages 18\u00ad49 might be due in\npart to the improvement in HIV/AIDS treat-\ning standard end-of-life care for patients with\na variety of terminal diagnoses.\nn Future research and suggestions.\nHospice has grown dramatically because of\nthe development of government reimburse-\nment systems and private health insurance\ncoverage and because it meets many basic hu-\nman needs associated with terminal illness\nand bereavement. However, in 1998 more than\n95 percent of those who died in nursing homes\ndid not receive hospice care; and in 2000 about\n75 percent of U.S. decedents did not use hos-\npice services near the time of death.19 Future\nstudies are needed to understand the charac-\nteristics and needs of both hospice patients\nand nonhospice terminally ill patients, to en-\nsure the provision of high-quality care at life's\nend. Moreover, researchers need to examine\nhow the quality of hospice care has been af-\nfected by the increase in patients with short\nhospice stays over time. How hospice care is\nperceived and is used by terminally ill patients\nand their families is continuing to evolve. Fu-\nture studies are needed to assess how various\nemerging approaches to end-of-life care affect\nhospice use, the benefits received by hospice\npatients and their families, and the hospice\ncare delivery system.\nTheauthorsacknowledgetheexperienceandknowledge\nsharedwiththemfromSeanMorrisonattheMount\nSinaiSchoolofMedicineaswellasfromJamesLubitz\nandJenniferMadansattheNationalCenterforHealth\nStatistics(NCHS).Theviewspresentedinthispaper\narethoseoftheauthorsanddonotnecessarilyreflect\nthoseoftheNCHSoritsofficials.\nNOTES\n1.
