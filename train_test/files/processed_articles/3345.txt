    "abstract": "Abstract\nEven though climate scientists are nearly unanimous that climate change is real and manmade, about 40% of Americans\nreject the scientific consensus. Why? The largest contributing factor is partisanship; however, recent studies argue that\nunderlying conspiracy thinking exerts a positive, linear effect on climate change denial. In this article, we reexamine the\neffect of conspiracy thinking on climate change attitudes by accounting for the various pathways that conspiracy thinking\ncould drive denialism in a politically polarized environment. We find the effects of conspiracy thinking on climate change\ndenial are not only larger than previously suggested, but also non-monotonic and conditional on individuals' party\nidentification. Moreover, we find evidence suggesting conspiracy thinking affects independents' positions, and even their\npartisan leanings. These findings further explain why people reject the scientific consensus on climate change, and suggest\nthat climate change denial is not merely the product of partisan polarization.\n",

Social scientists have identified many factors that\nWhitmarsh, 2011); however, partisanship may be the most\nconsistent predictor. In general, Democrats accept the sci-\nentific consensus and Republicans reject it (Dunlap et al.,\nsible for this polarization ( Bolsen et al., 2015; Carmichael\nthere is some within-party heterogeneity, independents are\nlargely divided.\nBeyond partisanship, conspiracy theories claiming that\nclimate change is a hoax, communist ploy, or precursor to\ntotalitarianism are entangled in the debate. For example, in\nAmericans thought it true or possibly true that \"global\nwarming is a myth concocted by scientists.\" Researchers\nfind that just exposure to climate change conspiracy theo-\nries can have a harmful effect on climate opinions and\nbehaviors (Jolley and Douglas, 2014; van der Linden,\n2015).

Our findings show that con-\nspiracy thinking is a more important predictor of climate\nchange denial than previously thought, but that these effects\nare highly contingent on partisan identity.

Uscinski, Associate Professor, Political Science, University of\nEmail: Uscinski@miami.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nConspiracy thinking and climate denial\nConspiracy thinking (also called conspiracist ideation) is a\nworldview that leads a person to view events and circum-\nstances as the product of conspiracies, powerful actors as\nconspirators, and authoritative accounts as fabricated\n2016). This way of thinking should be thought of as a spec-\ntrum: the more a person is predisposed toward conspiracy\nthinking, the more likely he/she is to believe in specific\nconspiracy theories (Uscinski et al., 2016).\nPrevious analyses find a positive and linear relationship\nbetween conspiratorial thinking and climate denial\n(Lewandowsky et al., 2013a), meaning that the more a per-\nson engages in conspiracy thinking, the more likely they\nare to reject the scientific consensus. This finding meshes\nwith extant literature showing that a stronger disposition\ntoward conspiracy thinking leads people to reject official\naccounts (Wood et al., 2012). In this case, people regardless\nof their party affiliation will reject the scientific consen-\nsus--simply because it is the official consensus--as they\nincrease in levels of conspiracy thinking.\nWith this said, the findings of Lewandowsky et al.\n(2013a) diverge from a long line of literature suggesting\nthat the effect of conspiracy thinking is conditioned by\nparty attachment (McClosky and Chong, 1985). Social sci-\nentists show that people selectively apply their conspiracy\nthinking based upon their partisan identity (Miller et al.,\nconspiracy theories surrounding climate change (Douglas\nand Sutton, 2015). Specifically, Republicans are more\nlikely to believe that climate change is a hoax while\nDemocrats are more likely to believe that oil companies are\nhiding solutions to climate change (Cassino, 2016;\nFurnham, 2013). Therefore, and given that different parties\noffer different official accounts on climate change, there is\nreason to doubt Lewandowsky et al.'s (2013a) finding that\nconspiracy thinking exerts a positive linear effect on cli-\nmate change denial, irrespective of party identification.\nThe conditional effect of conspiracy\nthinking\nGiven prior results connecting conspiracy thinking to parti-\nsan identity, and given that elite cues are polarized on the\nissue of climate change, conspiracy thinking can be\nexpected to push partisans' attitudes in different directions\ndepending on partisan affiliation. Thus, conspiracy think-\ning could drive partisans to \"double-down\" on their oppos-\ning positions, pushing Republicans to be more skeptical of\nclimate change and Democrats to be more convinced.\nAlternatively, conspiracy thinking could also drive parti-\nsans to accept positions opposite of their party elites, in this\ncase interrupting the signals coming from those party elites.\nTo account for these possibilities, our analyses interact par-\ntisanship and conspiracy thinking.\nThis latter possibility suggests that, in order to correctly\naccount for the conditioning effect of partisanship, we need\nto control for the possibility that partisans direct their con-\nspiratorial thinking to elites in their own party. Thus, parti-\nsanship, conspiratorial thinking, and the direction in which\nthe conspiracy thinking is aimed could interact to produce\ndifferent expectations about elite cues. Although partisans\nare generally suspicious of the opposing party (McClosky\nand Chong, 1985), polls show that some partisans--a minor-\nity--believe that their co-partisans are conspiring against\nthem (Uscinski and Parent, 2014). This skepticism of their\nparty possibly leads them to discount the cues coming from\ntheir party's leaders and instead take positions closer to that\nof the opposition. A historical example is the conservative\nJohn Birch Society whose conspiracy thinking led them to\nbelieve Republican President Dwight Eisenhower was a\ncommunist agent (Hofstadter, 1964). Just the same, a belief\nthat the opposition is conspiring may drive partisans to take\nextremely polarized positions because they will fully dis-\ncount cues coming from the other party and be even more\naccepting of cues coming from their own. To account for\nthese possibilities, we include three-way interactions in our\nanalyses between partisanship, conspiratorial thinking, and\nthe groups that individuals believe are conspiring.\nAs for independents, the literature has paid less attention\nand does not provide firm footing for expectations.\nConspiracy thinking may drive them to reject the existence\nof climate change since it represents an official consensus\n(Wood et al., 2012). On the other hand, conspiracy thinking\ncould drive independents to accept climate change because,\nabsent of the exposure to and acceptance of cues from par-\ntisan elites, the broader information environment (i.e., sci-\nence, popular culture) accepts climate change and tends to\naccuse carbon-emitting industries and denialist politicians\nFrom the available literature, we present one hypothesis\nand one null. The null reflects the current state of the litera-\n: Conspiracy thinking has a positive and linear effect\non climate change denial.\n: The effect of conspiracy thinking on climate denial\nis non-monotonic, and depends on party affiliation.\nIn turn, we will explore the effects of conspiracy thinking\non independents to provide new evidence of how conspir-\nacy thinking affects independents, an important set of\nvoters.\nData and methods\nUsing data from the 2012 Cooperative Congressional\nElection Study (CCES) survey (Ansolabehere, 2013), we\ninvestigate the impact of conspiracy thinking and partisan-\nship on attitudes toward climate change while controlling\nUscinski and Olivella 3\nfor a series of demographic, social, economic, and environ-\nmental factors. YouGov administered the survey online to a\nnationally representative sample of 1230 respondents in\nDependent variable\nOur dependent variable is each respondents' level of agree-\nment with the scientific consensus on climate change.\nWhen prompted to express their opinion, respondents could\nchoose from five alternatives ranging from complete agree-\nment (Global climate change has been established as a\nserious problem, and immediate action is necessary) to\ncomplete denial (Global climate change is not occurring;\nthis is not a real issue). These options touch on both the\nexistence of climate change and the necessity of action;\nthey are ideal because they match the positions taken by\nparty elites. These alternatives were numbered 1\u00ad5.\nExplanatory variables\nConspiracy thinking. To estimate the degree to which survey\nrespondents engage in conspiracy thinking, four statements\nwere loosely adapted from McClosky and Chong (1985)\nand provided to respondents: \"Events like wars, the current\nrecession, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by\nsmall groups of people who are working in secret against\nthe rest of us\"; \"Much of our lives are being controlled by\nplots hatched in secret places\"; \"Even though we live in a\ndemocracy, a few people will always run things anyway\";\n\"The people who really `run' the country, are not known to\nthe voters.\" Agreement with each statement was measured\non a five-point Likert scale running from 1= \"strongly\nagree\" to 5 = \"strongly disagree.\"\nSince the above-mentioned survey items are all Likert-\ntype questions, we use a graded-response (GRM) item\nresponse theory (IRT) model to obtain measures of latent con-\nspiracy thinking (Samejima, 2016). The GRM IRT essentially\nestimates an ordinal regression model of all Likert-type sur-\nvey responses as a function of a single, latent predictor (viz. a\nmeasure of conspiracy thinking), and two question-specific\nparameters (viz. difficulty and discrimination parameters)--\nmuch in the same way IDEALand NOMINATE estimate ide-\nology measures based on a binomial (rather than ordinal) IRT\nmodel of \"yay\" and \"nay\" legislative votes. The distribution\nof our estimated measure of conspiracy thinking is depicted\nin Figure 1(a), appearing largely symmetric with a slightly\nlonger right-hand tail, indicating the presence of a few highly\nconspiracy-minded respondents.\nPartisanship\nPartisanship was measured using standard three-point scale.\nThe boxplots (Figure 1(b)) depict the conditional distribu-\ntions of our conspiracy thinking measure across partisan-\nship, which we would expect to be different if members of\none partisan group were more prone to engage in conspiracy\nthinking than others. However, partisanship appears inde-\npendent of our estimated measure of conspiracy thinking.\nControl variables\nScholars have found that demographic factors are predic-\ntive of climate denial. Accordingly, we rely on the battery\nFigure 1. Estimated conspiracy thinking: distribution of estimated conspiracy thinking scores across all observations (a) and by\nparty affiliation (b).\n4 Research and Politics \nof demographics collected by the CCES to control for fam-\nily income, educational attainment, importance of religion,\nrace, gender, and age. Scholars have also found that local\nweather can impact views of climate change (Egan and\nMullin, 2012); therefore, we account for respondents'\nregional and local weather by including state fixed-effects\nand the difference between historical average temperatures\nin the respondent's zip code and the average temperature in\nthe month prior to the survey. We also account for news\nattention, as news is a common forum through which elites\ncommunicate to the masses.\nFinally, and to account for the fact that attitudes toward\nclimate change can depend not only on partisanship and con-\nspiracy thinking, but also on the direction of the conspiracy\nthinking, we allow the effects of conspiracy thinking to vary\nacross respondents' partisanship and the partisan identity of\nthe groups that respondents believe are conspiring. To meas-\nure the latter, we rely on a question that allows respondents to\nindicate whether they believe certain groups \"work in secret\nagainst the rest of us.\" We aggregate responses to this ques-\ntion into four categories: No Groups, Liberals, Conservatives,\nOther groups. Specifically, if respondents answered that no\ngroups work against the rest of us, we coded them as No\nGroups; if they answered either \"Democrats or other liberal\ngroups,\" \"Communists and Socialists,\" or \"Labor Unions\"\n(and explicitly said no to the conservative groups) we coded\ntheir direction of distrust as \"Liberals\"; if they answered yes\nto either \"Corporations and the rich\" or \"Republicans or other\nconservative groups\" (and explicitly said no to the liberal\ngroups), we coded their direction as \"Conservatives\"; other-\nwise, we coded their direction as \"Other.\"\nResults\nGiven the nature of our outcome variable, we estimate an\nordered probit model. As we are interested in evaluating\nwhether the effect of conspiracy thinking on attitudes about\nclimate change are conditional on partisanship, our model\nallows the cumulative probability of believing climate\nchange is a serious issue to be a function of an interaction\nbetween party affiliation, conspiracy thinking, and the direc-\ntion of conspiracy thinking. Although the survey included\nnot answer at least one of the items involved in the model,\nleaving us with 1025 cases on which the model is estimated.1\nThe results of our estimation are presented in Table 1.\nThe model fits the data significantly better than a null\n(intercepts only) model, with a 2 test statistic equal to\nstill discernibly better than our own (with a deviance of\n2535.02 indicating there is large amount of variation across\nour 1025 observations yet to be accounted for), our model\nstill correctly classifies about 43% of cases. With five\nresponse categories in our outcome variable, the classifica-\ntion rate is roughly twice as good as chance would have it.\nAs interpreting the estimated effects of variables\ninvolved in a three-way interaction is difficult to do by sim-\nply reviewing coefficients, we opt instead for obtaining\npredicted probabilities of answering our outcome question\nwith the category \"Global climate change has been estab-\nlished as a serious problem, and immediate action is neces-\nsary\" (which we call the focal category) and comparing it\nto the probability of choosing any other alternative. To cal-\nculate predicted probabilities, we follow the \"observed\nvalue\" approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan, 2013), which\nconsists of taking N samples from the sampling distribution\nof coefficients and recording, for each sample, an average\nquantity of interest across observed values. These N aver-\nages across observed values are in turn averaged, and con-\nfidence intervals are approximated by considering empirical\nUsing the \"observed value\" approach also averages over\nthe potentially conditioning effects of direction that we\naccounted for in the three-way interaction, allowing us to\nfocus on the conditioning relationship of interest: that of\nconspiracy thinking and partisanship.\nThe quantity of interest is thus the difference in pre-\ndicted probabilities of choosing the focal category for high\nand low values of the conspiracy thinking variable, for each\ndifferent party affiliation label. The predicted differences\n(i.e., the effects of a maximal change in conspiracy think-\ning) by party affiliation are plotted in Figure 2, with posi-\ntive values on the vertical axis indicating an increase in the\nprobability of adopting a stance on climate change that is in\nline with the scientific consensus. Furthermore, as we are\nnot holding the target of conspiracy thinking constant, these\neffects correspond to marginal predicted differences across\nsaid targets, allowing us to focus on the different effects of\nconspiracy thinking across party affiliations while still\naccounting for their conditional nature.\nAs the plot shows, the effect is significant across party affil-\niations. Holding all else constant at their observed values, and\naveraging across conditional effects, conspiracy thinking\nmakes partisans less likely to take a stance in line with scien-\ntific evidence, even if it means (in the case of Democrats)\nmoving away from the cues offered by their own party. The\neffectislargeramongRepublicansthanitisamongDemocrats.\nWhile the probability of choosing the focal category as a\nresponse is 15 percentage points lower among conspiratorial\nDemocrats than among their non-conspiratorial co-partisans,\nconspiratorial Republicans are about 28 points less likely to\nchoose the focal category than their non-conspiratorial\nRepublican counterparts. This provides support for H1\n--that\nthe effect of conspiracy thinking is non-monotonic and condi-\ntional upon party affiliation--and allows us to reject the null.\nUnderstanding independents\nHeterogeneity, and support for H1\n, is even more pronounced if\nwe consider the effect among independents, where more\nUscinski and Olivella 5\nconspiracy thinking is associated with a higher probability of\nadopting the scientific consensus. Conspiracy-minded inde-\npendents are on average about 18 percentage points more likely\nto align their beliefs with the scientific community on climate\nchange than their non-conspiracy-minded counterparts. This\nseems to be the case among both Democratic and Republican\nTable 1. Ordered probit model of level of agreement with consensus on climate change.\nCoefficient Standard error\nState fixed-effects Yes \nNote: A * indicates significance at the 0.05 level.\n6 Research and Politics \nleaning independents (though not among \"true\" independents),\nas illustrated by Figure 3, which replicates Figure 2 after group-\ning leaning independents with their partisan counterparts.\nDoing so moves the effect of conspiracy thinking among both\nDemocrats and Republicans closer to zero (indeed rendering\neffects among Democrats statistically indiscernible from zero).\nTo further explore our findings regarding independents,\nwe evaluated whether conspiracy thinking could predict\nwhich way independents lean when asked about their parti-\nsanship using a seven-point scale. We analyze independ-\nents, and predict their partisan leanings as a function of an\ninteraction between their estimated conspiracy thinking\nand the direction of that thinking again using an ordered\nprobit model and relevant control variables. Although we\nrefer readers to our online appendix for specific results,\nFigure 4 displays the predicted probability of leaning in\neither direction as a function of conspiracy thinking, for\neach of two types of people: those whose conspiracy\nthoughts are targeted toward liberal groups, and those\nwhose conspiracy thoughts are targeted toward conserva-\ntive groups.\nAs the overall increasing trend in darker shaded areas\nindicates, conspiracy thinking appears to be a strong pre-\ndictor of partisan leaning, with more conspiracy-minded\nindependents (i.e., those further to the right along the\nx-axis of Figure 4) being more likely to lean Democrat--\nparticularly so when the objects of conspiracy thinking are\nConservative groups. In turn, the object of conspiracy\nthinking is itself an even stronger predictor of partisan\nleaning, with larger portions of the right-hand panel (which\npresents results for independents who believe conserva-\ntives conspire against them) shaded in dark gray as com-\npared to the left-hand panel (which presents results for\nindependents who believe liberal groups conspire against\nthem). In general, then, our model's results suggest a\npotentially relevant mechanism through which the prefer-\nences of an important--if often ignored--portion of the\npopulation are formed.\nConclusion\nIn politically charged domains, partisans tend to take cues\nfrom politicians (Zaller, 1992), not scientists. With this\nsaid, there is considerable heterogeneity within each par-\nty's identifiers and our analysis shows that conspiracy\nthinking explains a significant portion of it. To change\nminds, science communicators must battle both Republican\nelites and conspiracy thinking. This makes changing minds\nFigure 2.

Predicted probability of partisan leaning as a function of conspiracy thinking, conditional on the object of conspiracy\nthinking.\n8 Research and Politics \nparticularly difficult: even if partisan elites uniformly\ncame out in favor of the scientific consensus, conspiracy\nthinking will still be difficult to overcome.\nOur findings move the literature forward by detailing\nthe nuanced role that conspiracy thinking plays in shaping\nclimate change opinions. Our results show that the effects\nof conspiracy thinking on climate change attitudes are\nlarger than previously argued and conditional on party\nidentification: conspiracy thinking drives Republicans and\nDemocrats to reject the scientific consensus, but independ-\nents to accept it (depending on how one operationalizes\n\"independents\"). That conspiracy thinking drives pure\nindependents to reject climate change suggests that parti-\nsanship is not solely to blame for denialism. Our results\nsuggest that not all partisans accept elite cues: conspiracy-\nminded Democrats (excluding leaners) actively reject cues\ncoming from their own elites. Conspiracy thinking may\nthen constrain the influence of party elites in some instances.\nIt is important to note that our findings varied depending on\nhow we operationalized independents and partisans;\nresearchers should therefore pay careful attention to their\nchoices in operationalizing these important groups, particu-\nlarly in conspiracy theory research. Our findings also shed\nlight on how independents came to their position on climate\nchange and suggest further avenues for research into how\nother worldviews drive independents in lieu of partisan\nattachment.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nSupplementary Material\nThe supplementary files are available at http://journals.sage-\ntion files are available at: http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/\nresearchandpolitics.\nNote\n1.
