Study participants were 1149 pri-\nmary informal caregivers, stratified by care recipients'\nsurvival or death during the following 12 months.\nResults: An estimated 11.2% of the chronically dis-\nabled community-dwelling older adults died within 1 year\nof being interviewed. Among persons who died, 72.3%\nwere receiving help from an informal caregiver at the time\nof the interview. End-of-life primary informal caregiv-\ners helped an average of 43 hours per week, 84.4% pro-\nvided daily assistance, and caregiver support services were\ninfrequently used (ie, respite care and support groups were\nused by less than 5% of caregivers). While end-of-life care-\ngivers reported significant emotional (28.9%), physical\nthirds endorsed personal rewards related to their help-\ning role. Compared with primary informal caregivers of\npersons who survived the following 12 months, end-of-\nlife caregivers provided significantly higher levels of as-\nsistance and reported more challenges and strains, but\nthey were no less likely to endorse rewards related to their\nhelping role.\nConclusions: End-of-life caregivers provide frequent and\nintense assistance with few supportive services.

First, studies to date have\npredominantly relied on family members\nof decedents8,14 or individuals identified as\nactively dying.2,4 Yet, death is difficult to\npredict, and individuals thought to be near\ndeath disproportionately represent par-\nticular terminal conditions or end-of-life\ntrajectories.15-17 Likewise, relying on the re-\ncall of family members of decedents is sub-\noptimal because remembrances of the in-\ntensity or experience of providing care may\nevolve subsequent to the event.18,19 Lastly,\nthat the provision of end-of-life care may\ngenerate its own rewards3 and that indi-\nviduals approaching death value their on-\ngoing contributions to others20 are con-\ncepts that have been recognized but are\nlargely absent from empirical research to\ndate.\nThisstudyaddressesthesegapsbydraw-\ning from a nationally representative sur-\nvey that collected information from both\nchronically disabled community-dwelling\nolder adults, and, for those who were re-\nceivinghelpfromfamilyorfriends,theirpri-\nmarycaregivers.Studyparticipantswerefol-\nlowed up over time to ascertain survival; in\nthis study we examine the help study par-\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Health Policy\nand Management, The Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of\nHealth, Baltimore, Md.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Among in-\ndividuals receiving help from family or friends, we inves-\ntigate the nature and intensity of help provided by primary\ninformal caregivers, use of community-based supportive\nservices, and caregivers' perceptions of their role, includ-\ning both related burdens and rewards.\nMETHODS\nData for this study were obtained from the 1999 National Long-\nTerm Care Survey (NLTCS) and the NLTCS Informal Care-\ngiver Survey (NICS). The NLTCS is a nationally representa-\ntive survey of Americans aged 65 years and older that was\nspecifically designed to study the prevalence of chronic dis-\nability.21,22 Medicare enrollment files constituted the sampling\nframe; screening interviews were conducted to determine eli-\ngibility for a detailed interview. In-person community inter-\nviews were conducted with participants, or with proxy respon-\ndents when participants were unavailable or unable to respond.\nnity interview.23 The NICS was conducted with the primary care-\ngiver (relative or unpaid nonrelative) who provided the most\nhours of help to the NLTCS participant with activities of daily\nliving or instrumental activities of daily living in the week prior\nto the community interview. The design of the NICS has been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere.24\nIn this study we compare primary caregivers' experiences\nby care recipients' survival status, although our main objec-\ntive was to elucidate the experiences of family caregivers pro-\nviding end-of-life care. The NLTCS and NICS were adminis-\ntered to participants and their primary informal caregivers during\nthe fall of 1999 (the NLTCS preceded the NICS since caregiv-\ners were identified in the NLTCS). The 1999 NLTCS partici-\npants' subsequent 12-month survival was based on the date of\nthe NLTCS participant interview and dates of death recorded\nin the vital statistics file. A total of 3115 community-dwelling\nNLTCS participants screened into the NLTCS as chronically\ndisabled, of whom 1622 were determined to have been receiv-\ning assistance from an informal caregiver. Of these, 251 per-\nsons died within 12 months of interview and 182 of their care-\nchronically disabled NLTCS participants who were receiving\nassistance from an informal caregiver and who survived 12\nmonths following their interview, a total of 967 primary care-\ngivers completed the NICS (70.5% response).\nObservations from the NLTCS and NICS must be weighted to\nproduce nationally representative estimates and to account for\nits complex sampling strategies. Detailed community weights\nreleased with the NLTCS were used in this study to generate\npopulation estimates of chronically disabled community-\ndwelling older adults. In addition, as outlined elsewhere,24 we\nconstructed weights for primary caregivers to chronically dis-\nabled community-dwelling older adults so as to generalize to\ncaregivers nationally.\nDemographic, economic, and health characteristics of chroni-\ncally disabled older adults and chronically disabled older adults\nreceiving help from an informal caregiver were first examined\nand were stratified by their survival throughout the 12 months\nfollowing the date of their NLTCS detailed community inter-\nview. We compared primary caregivers' sociodemographic char-\nacteristics, types of assistance provided, perceptions of their help-\ning role, and use of community and supportive services, stratified\nby recipients' survival status. All analyses were calculated us-\ning SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) us-\ning the Taylor expansion method to account for the complex\nsampling strategy of the NLTCS in estimating sampling er-\nrors. Estimates that cannot be considered reliable (relative stan-\ndard errors exceeding 30%) are noted in the tables.\nMEASUREMENTS\nKey measures for care recipients included demographic char-\nacteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and marital status\n[whether they were widowed]), living arrangement, socioeco-\nnomic factors (education, health insurance), and health status\n(self-rated health and functional disability). Personal assis-\ntance referred to active or standby help with activities of daily\nliving (eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and in-\ndoor mobility), and help with instrumental activities of daily\nliving tasks (grocery shopping, transportation, laundry, light\nhousework, managing money, meal preparation, using the tele-\nphone, medication management, and outdoor mobility) be-\ncause of a health problem or disability.\nForprimaryinformalcaregiversweexaminedage,gender,self-\nrated health, relationship to recipient (spouse, child, or other),\nand whether they lived with the care recipient. Information re-\ngarding caregiver commitment included duration of time pro-\nviding help, frequency of help, hours of assistance provided in\nthe previous week, and types of task assistance provided. Pri-\nmary caregivers' perceptions included challenges, burdens, and\nrewards experienced in their role, as well as the reciprocal ex-\nchanges by the person to whom they provided assistance. Lastly,\nwe examined use of community-based supportive services.\nRESULTS\nOf an estimated 5.6 million chronically disabled older\nadults who were living in the community during 1999,\ntive to community-dwelling chronically disabled older\nadults who survived, individuals in the last year of life\nwere significantly older and more likely to be male, to\nlive with others, to report fair or poor health, and to carry\na higher burden of functional disability.\nA total of 72.3% of chronically disabled older adults\nin the last year of life were receiving help from family or\nfriends compared with 48.6% of chronically disabled older\nadults who survived the following year. Relative to chroni-\ncally disabled older adults who received informal help\nand who survived the following year, recipients of in-\nformal care in the last year of life were significantly more\nlikely to be male, to report fair or poor self-rated health,\nand to carry a greater burden of functional disability.\nPrimary informal caregivers to individuals in the last year\ners (19.5%) (Table 2). End-of-life caregivers were, on\naverage, 64 years of age, tended to be female (75.1%),\nand were mainly in excellent or good health (66.3%).

How-\never, relative to primary informal caregivers of individu-\nals who survived, end-of-life caregivers were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be female, to have helped for a shorter\nperiod, and to be providing more intense and frequent\nassistance with tasks relating to personal care and nurs-\ning and medication administration.\nPrimary caregivers to individuals in the last year of life\nreported providing assistance when they did not feel well\n(53.5%), that their sleep was interrupted due to provid-\ning help (44.8%), that care recipients could not be left\nalone (36.8%), and that special medical care was re-\nquired that they could not provide (18.5%) (Table 3).\nThese challenges tended to be significantly more com-\nmon among end-of-life caregivers. End-of-life caregiv-\ners also reported significantly greater emotional (28.9%)\nand physical (18.4%) strains (but not financial strains)\nrelative to other primary caregivers.\nLarge proportions of end-of-life primary caregivers en-\ndorsed statements regarding the rewards and reciproc-\nity afforded by their helping role; the proportions were\ncomparable in magnitude to that of other caregivers. Ap-\nproximately 70% of end-of-life caregivers agreed or\nstrongly agreed with the statement that helping \"makes\nme feel good about myself\" and \"enables me to appreci-\nate life more,\" and 76.0% of caregivers reported that help-\ning made them \"feel useful and needed.\" A substantial\nproportion of primary caregivers acknowledged recip-\nrocated exchanges with the person to whom they pro-\nvided assistance, reporting that recipients helped \"keep\nhelped with household chores (20.8%).\nUse of community-based supports that were most com-\nmonly reported by end-of-life caregivers included assis-\nTable 1.

Services for housework\n(6.2%) were less commonly used. In terms of tradi-\ntional caregiver-related support services, less than 5% of\nall primary caregivers reported having participated in care-\ngiver support groups, used respite services, or enrolled\ntheir loved one in a program outside the home. Relative\nto other primary caregivers, end-of-life caregivers re-\nported statistically significant greater use of assistive de-\nvices and home modifications but were approximately\nhalf as likely to report the use of transportation services\nCOMMENT\nDrawing from a nationally representative survey of chroni-\ncally disabled community-dwelling older adults and their\nprimary caregivers, this study confirms family and friends\nto be the chief providers of end-of-life assistance. Nearly\nthree quarters of chronically disabled older adults in the\nlast year of life received help from family and friends. Pri-\nmary informal caregivers provided an average of 43 hours\nof help per week and 84.4% helped daily; supportive ser-\nvices were infrequently used. At the same time, a higher\nproportion of end-of-life primary informal caregivers en-\ndorsed personal rewards that accompanied their help-\ning role than identified related emotional, physical, or\nfinancial strains.\nThe mean 43 hours of weekly assistance that was pro-\nvided by end-of-life primary caregivers is substantially\nhigher than what has been previously reported in na-\ntional studies of family caregivers,24,25 and is compa-\nrable to the 46 hours of help reported by one end-of-life\nstudy conducted among caregivers of persons with de-\nmentia.5 Thus, chronically disabled older individuals\nwithin 1 year of death were receiving assistance equat-\ning to 1 full-time equivalent worker from their primary\ncaregiver alone. This finding is pertinent to discussions\non end-of-life care in that most studies regarding the costs\nof end-of-life care have limited their scope to those costs\nTable 2.

Approximately 70% of caregivers re-\nported that providing help \"enables me to appreciate life\nmore\" and \"makes me feel good about myself.\" A nota-\nbly greater proportion of end-of-life primary caregivers\nendorsed rewards associated with helping than identi-\nfied emotional, physical, and financial burdens; a find-\ning that, to our knowledge, has heretofore not been noted\nin the published literature. Importantly, whereas end-\nof-life caregivers were more likely to identify challenges\nand burdens than other long-term caregivers, they were\nno less likely to identify a sense of rewards. Quantifying\nthese rewards is important because concerns about be-\ning burdensome are thought to loom large among indi-\nviduals at the end of life,12,13 and are thought to be a fac-\ntor in patients' end-of-life treatment decisions.4,33\nSeriously ill patients have expressed the importance\nof ongoing daily interactions with family and friends, and\nthe ability to help others as components of a good\ndeath.13,20 Data from this study indicate that primary care-\ngivers were readily able to identify reciprocated emo-\ntional, instrumental, and financial exchanges afforded to\nthem by the person to whom they provided assistance.\nWe are unaware of other studies that have examined mu-\ntuality of exchanges within caregiving dyads at the end\nof life; the frequency of these interactions and stated im-\nportance to seriously ill or dying patients suggest this topic\nmerits further inquiry.\nResults from this study indicate that few supportive\nservices are used by chronically disabled older adults and\ntheir primary informal caregivers, regardless of sur-\nvival. This finding is consistent with other work show-\ning limited use of paid services by individuals nearing\ndeath,2 and the low take-up of support services among\ninformal caregivers.34 We cannot comment on the pres-\nence or nature of barriers to accessing supportive ser-\nvices, or the extent to which these services were per-\nceived as desirable or needed. That said, by quantifying\nnonmedical service use near the end of life, this study\nprovides important insight on a topic that is not well un-\nderstood35 and that is highly relevant to policy makers\ninterested in reconfiguring the health system to better ad-\ndress the needs of chronically disabled older adults and\ntheir families.\nThere are several important limitations of this study.\nThe sample was restricted to older adults who were\nchronically disabled and we, therefore, cannot com-\nment on help received by working-age adults or older\nadults without chronic disability. In addition, our cat-\negorization of help that individuals were receiving prior\nto death was assessed at a single point in time, while par-\nticipants' health needs and personal care arrangements\nwere not static. For example, individuals in the last year\nof life who were not receiving help from an informal care-\ngiver carried a lower burden of functional disability, and\nit may well be that some portion of persons in this group\nhad no need for personal care at the time they were in-\nterviewed. From this standpoint, the 72.3% of chroni-\ncally disabled older adults who were found to have re-\nceived help from family, friends, or both prior to their\ndeath may underestimate the reliance on family, be-\ncause some portion of older adults who were catego-\nrized as being without help may have subsequently ac-\nquired a family caregiver. Likewise, families' experiences\nand perceptions in providing assistance may shift with\nimpending death, yet we relied on a crude categoriza-\ntion that only accounted for 12-month survival.\nThe heterogeneity of the study sample inhibits our abil-\nity to describe caregivers' experiences by virtue of spe-\ncific diseases, timing, or site of death, or to compare our\nfindings with other evidence from the end-of-life litera-\nture. The particular constellation of disease or diseases\nbeing managed, decedents' end-of-life trajectory, and tem-\nporal proximity to death are all apt to influence families'\nexperiences providing care. For example, understand-\ning decedents' trajectories of dying could have helped in-\nform our finding that end-of-life caregivers were less likely\nto be long-term caregivers.17 We would have ideally liked\nto have further examined families' experiences on sev-\neral of these dimensions; however, the study sample was\ninsufficient in size for this level of subanalysis. While we\nacknowledge the limitations of relying on a heteroge-\nneous, population-based study sample, most of what is\nknown about the circumstances of family care at the end\nof life has been derived from studies of individuals with\nclear dying trajectory.2,4,35 Although the sample of end-\nof-life caregivers is small, by drawing from a nationally\nrepresentative survey this study provides valuable infor-\nmation about the end-of-life experience for a broader\nTable 4.

That\nnearly three quarters of chronically disabled older adults\nin the last year of life received help from an informal care-\ngiver underscores the relevance of family to end-of-life\npatient care, and the potential benefit of productive col-\nlaborative relationships between physicians, patients, and\nfamilies. Collectively, the literature on end-of-life care-\ngivers suggests a role for physicians in monitoring the\nwell-being of seriously ill or dying patients, as well as their\ncaregivers; considering the health status and needs of both\nmembers of the caregiving dyad collectively, as a unit.7,36\nHowever, the general perception of families, particu-\nlarly family members of severely ill, hospitalized, or dy-\ning patients, is that communication with health care pro-\nbeen some recognition that the health care community\nshould better acknowledge the contributions and needs\nof patients' families and friends,42-44 much remains to be\nlearned regarding how families should be integrated in\nmedical care.45 By doing so, health care professionals might\nbetter capitalize on families' ability to serve as a re-\nsource and ally in patient care, and potentially benefit\nThis is, to our knowledge, the first study to draw from\na nationally representative surveyof primaryinformal care-\ngivers to examine their experiences providing care to in-\ndividualsinthelastyearoflife.Informationreportedherein\nconfirmstheintensityandfrequencyofend-of-lifecare,and\nhelps elucidate the pathway by which the provision of such\nassistance may generate adverse health consequences.
