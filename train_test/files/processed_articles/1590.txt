To determine if socioeconomic status, as measured by education level, is associated with mortality due to\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to determine if these associations differ among ethnic groups.\nMethods. Sex- and race-specific mortality rates due to SLE by education level were computed for persons age 25\u00ad64 years\nusing US Multiple Causes of Death data from 1994 to 1997. SLE-specific mortality rates were compared with all-cause\nmortality rates in 1997 to determine if the association between education level and mortality in SLE was similar to that\nin other causes of death.\nResults. Among whites, the risk of death due to SLE was significantly higher among those with lower levels of education,\nand the risk gradient closely paralleled the 1997 all-cause mortality risks by education level. However, in African\nAmerican women and men and Asian/Pacific Islander women, the risk of death due to SLE was lower among those with\nlower education levels, contrary to the associations between education level and all-cause mortality in these groups.\nComparing the distribution of education levels among deaths due to SLE and all deaths in 1997, persons with lower\neducation levels were underrepresented among deaths due to SLE in African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders.\nConclusion. Among whites, higher education levels are associated with lower mortality due to SLE. These associations\nwere not present in ethnic minorities, likely due to underascertainment of deaths due to SLE in less-well educated\npersons. This underascertainment may be due to underreporting of SLE on death certificates, but may also represent\nunderdiagnosis of SLE in ethnic minorities with low education levels.\nKEY WORDS.

Similar associations have\nbeen found for both whites and African Americans when\nrace-specific mortality has been examined (2\u00ad4,6\u00ad10,\nsure of socioeconomic status, mortality rates among those\nhigher than those of college graduates (1,4,5,8,13).

Most studies examined clinic-based\ncohorts, which may be susceptible to selection bias and\nhave limited generalizability. Four of the 5 studies used\nmedical insurance status as the measure of socioeconomic\nstatus, or inferred patients' socioeconomic status from the\neconomic characteristics of their area of residence, rather\nthan using more direct personal measures of socioeco-\nnomic status, such as income or education level (21\u00ad24).\nAn ecologic analysis of national data from the United\nStates found higher mortality rates due to SLE in counties\nwith higher poverty rates (26). Previous studies also re-\nported higher mortality rates due to SLE among African\nAmericans and Asian Americans, but these studies did not\nMichael M.

This\nquestion is important because although the health out-\ncomes of patients with SLE have improved over time,\nIn this study, I examined the hypothesis that socioeco-\nnomic status, measured by education level, was inversely\nassociated with mortality due to SLE in whites, African\nAmericans, and Asian/Pacific Islanders in the United\nTrends in SLE mortality by education level were also\ncompared with similar trends in all-cause mortality.\nMETHODS\nData on the number of deaths occurring in the United\nStates in persons with SLE were abstracted from Multiple\nCauses of Death files of the National Center for Health\nStatistics (31). These files include information on all re-\ncorded deaths occurring in the United States each year,\nbased on death certificates filed in each state. Records for\neach death include the underlying cause of death and up\nto 20 additional conditions listed as associated or contrib-\nuting causes of death, by International Classification of\nDiseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes (32). Each record\nalso includes the decedents' age, sex, race (white, black,\nNative American, Asian/Pacific Islander), Hispanic ethnic-\nity, and place of residence, as well as information on the\ntime and place of death.\nInformation on the decedents' education level was first\nincluded on the Standard Certificate of Death in 1989, but\nthis item was not immediately adopted by all states. In\n1993, information on education level was not available for\ndeaths in New York City, Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Is-\nland, and South Dakota, was missing for 20% of deaths\nin Kentucky and West Virginia (and therefore considered\nunreliable), and was missing for 9% of deaths in other\nstates. Beginning in 1994, information on education level\nwas available for deaths in 46 states, New York City, and\nthe District of Columbia. Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Is-\nland, and South Dakota did not include education level on\ntheir death certificates. Data on education level were miss-\ning for 20% of deaths in Kentucky. In the remaining\nstates, data on education level were missing for 4.2% of\nFor this study, all deaths occurring in 45 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia (excluding Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode\nwhich SLE was included as either the underlying cause,\nimmediate cause, or contributing cause of death were in-\ncluded. The study was limited to persons age 25\u00ad64 years\nbecause SLE most often occurs in young adulthood or\nmiddle age, because most people have completed their\nformal education by age 25, and because death certificate\ndata on education level may be less accurate among per-\nsons age 65 and older (33). For each death, data were\nabstracted on age, sex, race, years of education, and place\nof death.\nNephritis and renal failure are markers of severe SLE\nidentify a subset of persons in whom the diagnosis of SLE\nis made with greater specificity. Therefore, decedents\nwhose records included acute or chronic glomerulone-\nfailure, unspecified (ICD-9 code 586) as one of the multiple\ncauses of death along with SLE were also identified.\nMortality rates by education level for each sex and race\nsubgroup were computed using census counts as the de-\nnominators. Counts by age (in 5-year age groups), sex, race,\neducation level, and state from the 1990 census were pro-\nprovide the population at risk of death in these years (38).\nCounts for Georgia, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Da-\nkota, and Kentucky were omitted from these totals. Al-\nthough information on deaths by both race and Hispanic\nethnicity was available, mortality by Hispanic ethnicity\ncould not be analyzed because census data on education\nlevel by both race and Hispanic ethnicity were not avail-\nable for each state. Therefore, Hispanics were not analyzed\nas a separate category, but were included in either the\nwhite, African American, or Native American racial\ngroups. For white and African American women, mortality\nrates were computed for education levels of 0\u00ad8 years,\nBecause fewer deaths due to SLE occurred in men and\nAsian/Pacific Islander women, mortality rates for these\ngroups were computed for education levels of 0\u00ad11 years,\n12 years, and 13 years. Because validation studies of\ndeath certificate information have indicated that ethnic\nminorities with 12 years of education were more likely to\nbe recorded as being high school graduates than recorded\nwith lower levels of educational attainment, comparisons\nwere also performed using only 2 categories of education\nSex- and race-specific mortality rates were age adjusted\nusing direct standardization, with the 1990 United States\npopulation as the standard. For strata with 100 deaths,\n95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the mortality rates\nwere computed based on Poisson distribution. For strata\nwith 100 deaths, 95% CIs for the mortality rates were\ncomputed based on z distribution (39). Poisson regression\nmodels were used to estimate rate ratios for mortality due\nto SLE among education groups, with the highest educa-\ntion category as the reference group. P values  0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant. Analyses were per-\nformed separately for each sex and race, and for persons\nwith SLE included as any category of cause of death (un-\nderlying, immediate, or contributing), for those with SLE\nas the underlying cause of death, and for those with SLE\nwho had renal disease included among the causes of\ndeath. Analyses were performed using SAS programs (ver-\nsion 8; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nTo determine if the association between education level\nand mortality due to SLE was similar to that of other\ncauses of death, these analyses were repeated using all\ndeaths in 1997. Consistency in the education-related risks\nEducation Level and Mortality in SLE 617\nof mortality between deaths due to SLE and all-cause\nmortality would support the validity of this association,\nwhereas inconsistency would suggest either that the edu-\ncation-mortality association was modified in the setting of\nSLE, or that there were deficiencies in the identification of\ndeaths due to SLE.\nRESULTS\nsons age 25\u00ad64 years for which SLE was recorded as the\nunderlying, immediate, or contributing cause. Data on ed-\nucation level were missing for 160 persons (3.3%), and\nthese people were excluded from analysis. These persons\ndid not differ from the 4,619 persons who had information\non education level in age, sex, race, or the likelihood that\nSLE was the underlying cause of death. Persons with miss-\ning data on education level were more likely to have died\nwere Asian/Pacific Islander, and 28 (0.6%) were Native\nAmerican. Three hundred forty-seven persons (7.5%)\npleted 16 years. The mean age of death was 46.1 years.\nSLE was the underlying cause of death for 2,852 persons\n(61.7%). Renal disease was listed as one of the multiple\ncommon diagnoses being unspecified renal failure (n \nyears). There were too few deaths due to SLE among\nAsian/Pacific Islander men (n  24) and Native Americans\nfor meaningful analysis, and these groups were not ana-\nlyzed further.\nAmong white women, the age-adjusted mortality rate\ndue to SLE (as an underlying, immediate, or contributing\ncause of death) decreased from 20.9/million in those with\nyears of education (Table 2). White women with 0\u00ad8 years\nof education were twice as likely to have died of SLE than\nthose with 16 years of education, and the risks decreased\nprogressively with increasing education level. Results\nwere similar for analyses of SLE as the underlying cause of\ndeath and for the subgroup with renal disease, with some-\nwhat stronger risk gradients for these outcomes. Findings\nin white men were similar to those in women, with mor-\ntality rates due to SLE as any cause of death or as the\nunderlying cause significantly higher among those with\n12 years of education (Table 3). For both white women\nand white men, the education gradient in risk of mortality\ndue to SLE closely paralleled the education gradient in\nrisk in all-cause mortality (Figure 1).\nAmong African American women, the age-adjusted mor-\ntality rates due to SLE were similar among those with 12\nHowever, the mortality rates due to SLE were lower among\nthose with 0\u00ad8 years or 9\u00ad11 years of education. African\nAmerican women with 0\u00ad8 years of education were only\n48% as likely to die of SLE as those with a college educa-\ntion, and those with 9\u00ad11 years of education were only\n76% as likely to die of SLE as those with a college educa-\ntion. Results were similar in analyses of SLE as the under-\nlying cause of death and for the subgroup with renal dis-\nease as a cause of death. These decreased risks of mortality\ndue to SLE contrasted with the increased risk of all-cause\nmortality among less-well educated African American\nwomen (Figure 1).\nResults for African American men and Asian/Pacific\nIslander women demonstrated a pattern similar to that of\nAfrican American women. Among African American men,\nthe risk of SLE-related mortality was 30% lower among\nthose with 0\u00ad11 years of education than among those with\n13 years of education (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.70),\nwhereas all-cause mortality was approximately twice as\nhigh in those with 0\u00ad11 years of education (Table 5 and\nFigure 1). Among Asian/Pacific Islander women, the risk\nof SLE-related mortality among those with 0\u00ad11 years of\neducation was only 72% of the risk of those with 13\nyears of education, whereas the risk of all-cause mortality\nwas slightly increased among those with 0\u00ad11 years of\neducation (Table 6 and Figure 1).\nTo limit the effects of any upgrading of education levels\nto high school graduate, the data were also analyzed by\ncomparing those with 12 years of education with those\nreported as having 12 years of education (Table 7). White\nwomen with 12 years of education were 1.64 times more\nlikely to die of SLE than white women with 12 years of\neducation. This risk was similar to the all-cause mortality\nyears versus >12 years)*\nWhite\nwomen\nWhite\nmen\nAfrican American\nwomen\nAfrican American\nmen\nAsian/Pacific Islander\nwomen\nSLE deaths\nAll deaths\n* Data presented as no (%).

Among white men, the risk of mortality due\nto SLE in those with 12 years of education (OR 2.12) was\nalmost identical to the all-cause mortality risk (OR 2.10).\nHowever, among African American women (OR 1.03), Af-\nrican American men (OR 0.92), and Asian/Pacific Islander\nwomen (OR 0.90), there was no association between lower\neducation levels and mortality due to SLE, even though in\neach group those with lower education levels had signifi-\ncantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (ORs of 1.38, 1.76,\nand 1.22, respectively). Results were similar for the sub-\ngroups with mortality due to SLE as the underlying cause\nand mortality due to SLE with renal disease.\nA possible explanation for the divergent association be-\ntween education level and mortality risk due to SLE and\nits association with all-cause mortality in ethnic minori-\nties, and for the differences in this association between\nethnic minorities and whites, may be found in the distri-\nbution of education levels in these groups. In white\nwomen and white men, two-thirds of deaths due to SLE\nTable 2.

However,\namong African American women, African American men,\nand Asian/Pacific Islander women, there were relatively\nfewer deaths due to SLE occurring in those with 12 years\nof education than deaths due to any cause. For example,\namong African American women, 73.3% of all deaths oc-\ncurred in persons with 12 years of education, but only\n61.3% of deaths due to SLE occurred in this education\ngroup, representing an absolute decrease of 12% and a\nrelative decrease of 20%. This suggests a selective absence\nof deaths due to SLE recorded among ethnic minorities\nwith 12 years of education.\nDISCUSSION\nThis national, population-based study indicates that edu-\ncation level has an important association with mortality\ndue to SLE among whites. Compared with those with 16\nyears of education, the risk of mortality due to SLE was\ntwice as high among white women with 8 years of edu-\ncation. Mortality risks decreased with increasing educa-\ntion level so that risks were similar between those with\nwomen, the mortality risk gradient with education level\nwas higher among those with renal disease, as might be\nexpected if renal disease was a marker of more severe SLE,\nFigure 1.

Odds ratios\nwere adjusted for age. Persons in the highest education category were the reference group.\nand if socioeconomic status was associated with the sever-\nity of SLE. Among white men, risks of mortality due to SLE\nwere twice as high among those with 12 years of educa-\ntion, compared with those with 12 years of education.\nThe association between education level and mortality\ndue to SLE in whites paralleled that found for all-cause\nmortality, and is consistent with many previous studies\nthat demonstrate that persons of higher socioeconomic\nstatus have lower mortality rates (1\u00ad15). These associa-\ntions support the validity of the analytic approach used\nhere, which merged information on education level from\ndeath certificates with census data to compute mortality\nrates by education level.\nIn contrast to the findings in whites, and in contrast to\nthe associations between socioeconomic status and all-\ncause mortality in many prior studies, higher education\nlevels were not associated with lower mortality due to SLE\namong African Americans or Asian/Pacific Islander\nwomen. In fact, lower education levels appeared protec-\ntive of mortality due to SLE among African American\nTable 4.

This\neffect appeared to be specific for mortality due to SLE,\nbecause all-cause mortality in these groups was higher\namong those with lower education levels. There are sev-\neral potential explanations for the difference. It is possible\nthat SLE is more prevalent in ethnic minorities with higher\neducation levels and more prevalent in whites with low\neducation levels, and these differences in prevalence\ntranslated into the differences in mortality rates that were\nobserved. However, this explanation seems unlikely, as\nthere is no evidence that the prevalence of SLE varies by\nsocioeconomic status differently in different ethnic\ngroups. Postponement of mortality past age 65 may also\ninfluence these results, but for this explanation to account\nfor the ethnic differences detected, one would need to\npostulate that high education levels lead to preferential\npostponement of mortality in whites with SLE, whereas\nlow education levels lead to preferential postponement of\nmortality in ethnic minorities with SLE, which seems im-\nprobable. Similarly, the findings could be explained by\nhigh mortality before age 25 in ethnic minorities with 12\nyears of education, but low mortality before age 25 in\nwhites with 12 years of education, in those with onset of\nSLE in adolescence or young adulthood. However, the\ngenerally low mortality in this age group makes this ex-\nIt also is possible that the severity of SLE differs among\nethnic groups. The interpretation that ethnic differences in\nseverity account for the results would need to explain why\nlow education levels would be associated with more se-\nvere SLE and higher mortality rates in whites but with less\nsevere SLE and lower mortality rates in ethnic minorities.\nSimilar associations were also present in the subgroup of\npatients with SLE and renal disease as a cause of death.\nThe associations in this subgroup, which controls in part\nfor the severity of SLE, suggest that differences in severity\nare unlikely to account for the findings. A differential\nTable 6.

SLE  systemic lupus erythematosus\nassociation between education level and mortality by race\nwould also conflict with the results of a cohort study that\ndemonstrated similar socioeconomic effects on mortality\nin whites and African Americans with SLE (24).\nA more likely explanation for the findings in African\nAmericans and Asian/Pacific Islanders is underascertain-\nment of deaths due to SLE in those with 12 years of\neducation. This group was underrepresented among\ndeaths due to SLE, with relative decreases of 20\u00ad25%\ncompared with the proportion of deaths from all causes\namong persons of similar education levels in these ethnic\ngroups. Such underrepresentation was not present among\nwhites, for which the proportions with 12 years of edu-\ncation were identical in deaths due to SLE and deaths due\nto any cause. Because of this underascertainment, it may\nnot be possible to report valid mortality rates due to SLE in\nAfrican Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders from this\nsource.\nBias in the reporting of education level on death certif-\nicates results in more people with low education levels\nbeing classified as having completed high school (33).\nAlthough more common among decedents 65 years or\nolder, this misclassification also occurs in younger age\ngroups and is more common among African Americans.\nAlthough this upgrading may have impacted our examina-\ntion of risk gradients by education level in ethnic minori-\nties, racial differences in the associations between educa-\ntion level and SLE-related mortality on one hand, and\nbetween education level and all-cause mortality on the\nother hand, persisted when results were compared be-\ntween those with some college and those with high school\neducations or less.\nThis study indicates that mortality due to SLE is higher\namong whites with lower socioeconomic status, as mea-\nsured by educational attainment. It is difficult to draw\nconclusions about the association between education level\nand mortality due to SLE in other ethnic groups because of\nevidence suggesting possible underascertainment of\ndeaths due to SLE in ethnic minorities with lower levels of\neducation. This underascertainment may be due to more\nfrequent misreporting of causes of death among ethnic\nminorities with low socioeconomic status, and specifically\nunderreporting of SLE among these patients. However, of\nmore concern is that this underascertainment could reflect\nthe underdiagnosis of SLE in persons of low socioeco-\nnomic status, particularly ethnic minorities. Underdiagno-\nsis would likely be associated with inadequate treatment.\nPopulation-based prospective cohort studies with active\ncase findings are needed to investigate these possibilities,\nand to investigate the role of limited access to medical care\nin the diagnosis and treatment of SLE in ethnic minorities\nof lower socioeconomic status. These findings also suggest\nthat SLE may be underrepresented in United States mor-\ntality statistics (29).\nREFERENCES\n1.
