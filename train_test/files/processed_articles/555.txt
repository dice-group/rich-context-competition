Number of comorbid medical\nconditions was the independent variable, lifetime and 12-month MDD were dependent variables, and age, gender,\neducation, marital status, employment, and body mass index were covariates. Race- and ethnic- specific logistic\nregressions were used to determine race and ethnic differences in the associations between number of chronic\nmedical conditions and lifetime and 12-month MDD, while the effect of all covariates were controlled.\nResults: Number of chronic medical conditions was positively associated with lifetime MDD among non-Hispanic\nCaribbean Blacks (P > .05).

With 465 billion dollars direct medical cost, dia-\nbetes is responsible for about 10 % of total healthcare\nexpenditures in the United States [1].\nPossibly due to its complications [3, 4] and also its ef-\nfects on activities of daily living and well-being and social\nlife [5\u00ad9], individuals with diabetes are at higher risk of de-\npression [10, 11]. The prevalence rate of depression is\nthree-times higher in people with type 1 diabetes and\nnearly twice as high in people with type 2 diabetes com-\npared to controls [12]. Up to 75 % of adults with diabetes\nhave at least one comorbid medical conditions [13]. High\nrates of depression and comorbid medical conditions are\nan essential aspect of diabetes, emphasizing the need for\ncollaborative care for patients with diabetes [14].\n* Correspondence: lankaranii@yahoo.com\n1Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Michigan, 4250\n2Center for Research on Ethnicity, Culture, and Health (CRECH), School of\nPublic Health, University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor,\n\u00a9 2015 Lankarani and Assari.

As most patients with index\nmedical diseases such as diabetes also suffer from comor-\nbid health conditions [15], studying the influence of co-\nmorbid conditions on health outcomes helps health care\nproviders to better plan the follow up of patients' health\nNumber of chronic medical conditions is one of the\ncommonly used measures of comorbidity in epidemio-\nlogical and community-based studies [18\u00ad21]. In this ap-\nproach, comorbidity is measured based on number, not\ntype, of medical conditions [22\u00ad28]. Studies have shown\nthat number of comorbid conditions is associated with\nlow well-being [29\u00ad33], functional status, health related\nquality of life [34], and higher disability [34] and mortality\n[35]. Patients with diabetes and comorbid conditions are\nat higher risk of insulin resistance [13, 36]. Unfortunately,\nthe existing literature on the link between co-morbidity\nand health and well-being [37\u00ad51] does not provide infor-\nmation on this association among patients with diabetes.\nVery few studies have tested if race and ethnicity interfere\nwith the effects of medical comorbidities on the mental\nhealth of individuals with diabetes or other index diseases.\nRace and ethnicity determine social class and life experi-\nences, personalities, identities, values, exposures, resources\nand assets. In this view, even if separate effects of risk and\nresilience factors are similar across groups, their additive\nand multiplicative effects may be different across subgroups\n[52\u00ad60]. This can be in part due to differential overlap of\nrisk and protective factors, or different distribution of con-\nfounders and mediators. Race and ethnicity shape human's\nidentity, life experience, values, social power, and access to\nindividual and environmental assets and resources that in\nturn determine distribution, vulnerability, and resilience of\nindividuals to risk and protective factors [18, 56]. In this\nview, race and ethnicity operate as contextual factors that\nmodify resilience and vulnerability to the separate, additive,\nand multiplicative effects of risk and protective factors.\nAs race and ethnicity have shown to moderate the link\nand in response to the gap of knowledge on race and ethnic\ndifferences in the associations between medical and psychi-\natric comorbidities among patients with diabetes, the\ncurrent study compared non-Hispanic Whites, African\nAmericans, and Caribbean Blacks with diabetes for the as-\nsociation between number of medical comorbidities and\nlifetime and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD).\nMethods\nThe current study used a cross sectional design. We bor-\nrowed data from the National Survey of American Life\na part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology\nSurveys (CPES). The study was funded by the National\nInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH).\nEthics\nThe study protocol received approval by the Institutional\nReview Board of the University of Michigan. Participants\nreceived monetary compensation. Data was kept fully con-\nfidential, and all data were collected, restored, and ana-\nlyzed in an anonymous fashion. All participants provided\nwritten consent.\nParticipants\nThe NSAL methodology, including sampling, process, and\ninterviewer training, has been described elsewhere [61\u00ad63].\nThe NSAL used a national household probability sample of\nadults (18 years and older). African Americans were resi-\ndents of large cities, other urban areas, or rural areas.\nCaribbean Blacks were sampled from large cities.\nRace and ethnicity\nAfrican-American individuals were identified as Blacks\nwho did not identify any ancestral tie in the Caribbean.\nCaribbean Blacks were composed of Blacks who self-\nidentified as being of Caribbean ancestry. The non-\nHispanic White population included all Caucasian adults\nexcept for those who reported Hispanic ancestry [64].\nEnrollment to the NSAL\nThe NSAL survey population included US adults (age 18\nand older) who were African Americans, Caribbean Blacks\nor Whites and resided in households located in the coter-\nminous 48 states. The NSAL sample was restricted to\nadults who were able to complete the interview in English.\nInstitutionalized individuals (e.g. including those in\nprisons, jails, nursing homes, and long-term medical or\ndependent care setting) were excluded [64].\nSampling\nThe NSAL applied a multi-stage sampling design. The\n`core' sample for the NSAL was a national area probability\nsample from which African Americans and Whites were\nsampled. The sampling also included a special supplemen-\ntal sample of households in areas of high Caribbean Black\nresidential density. The design of the NSAL Core sample\nclosely resembled the National Survey of Black Ameri-\ndrawing the African-American sample. The NSAL na-\ntional area probability sample was selected independently\nof other CPES samples [64].\nInterview\nAll interviews were conducted in English. For 86 % of the\nrespondents, data was collected through face-to-face\ncomputer-assisted interviews. Telephone interviews were\nused for collection of data of the remaining 14 % of the\nparticipants. Interviews lasted 140 min on average. Re-\nsponse rate was 72.3 % overall. The response rate was\nBlacks, and 69.7 % for non-Hispanic Whites.\nMeasures\nSocio-demographic characteristics\nDemographic (age and gender) and socio-economic\n(marital status, and geographic region of the country)\ncharacteristics were control variables in this study.\nMarital status was operationalized as a three level cat-\negorical variable (Divorced/Separated/Widowed, Never\nMarried, and Married) while country of origin was a four\nlevel variable (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).\nNumber of comorbid medical comorbidities\nNumber of comorbid medical conditions was measured\nusing self-reported history of doctor-diagnosed chronic\nmedical conditions, from 13 medical conditions that\ncould occur in addition to diabetes. Respondents were\nasked about the following conditions: Arthritis/rheuma-\ntism, peptic ulcers, cancer, hypertension, chronic liver\ndisease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, asthma, other\nchronic lung diseases, atherosclerosis, sickle cell disease,\nheart disease and glaucoma. Self-reported history of\ndoctor-diagnosed chronic medical conditions has been\nshown to be accurate [65].\nOutcomes\nA modified version of the World Mental Health (WHO)\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was\nused to measure lifetime and 12-month MDD. The CIDI\nis a fully structured diagnostic interview that is designed\nto measure a wide range of DSM-IV based non-psychotic\nmental disorders. The CIDI has been used in the World\nMental Health project [66]. The CIDI is used by trained\nlay interviewers to generate diagnoses of lifetime and re-\ncent DSM-IV-TR / ICD-10 disorders [67]. Clinical re-\nappraisal studies have documented high concordance of\nCIDI diagnoses with diagnoses made by psychiatrists [68,\n69]. Investigation of area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC) has found excellent concord-\nance between CIDI and the Structured Clinical Interview\nfor DSM-IV diagnoses of MDD. Additionally, the preva-\nlence differences between CIDI and Structured Clinical\nInterview for DSM-IV (SCID) are non-significant at the\noptimal CIDI diagnostic thresholds. Thus, CIDI operating\ncharacteristics are equivalent for MDE to those of the best\nalternative screening scales [70]. CIDI is also known to\nprovide valid findings for Blacks and their ethnic groups\nStatistical analysis\nTo consider the NSAL's multi-stage sample design, we\nused Stata 13.0 for data analysis. For all our analyses, we\napplied weights due to strata, clusters, and non-response.\nAs a result, results are nationally representative. We used\nsub-population survey command for all our analyses.\nRace/ethnic- specific logistic regressions were applied for\ndata analysis. We used number of comorbid medical con-\nditions as the independent variable, demographic and\nsocio-demographics as controls, and lifetime and 12-\nmonth MDD as outcomes. Adjusted Odds Ratios (OR)\nand 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) were reported. P-\nvalues less than 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nMost NSAL participants in all ethnic groups were be-\ntween 30 and 44 years of age. Almost half of NSAL partic-\nipants in each ethnic group were women. While most\nnon-Hispanic Whites and African Americans were born\ninside the US, most Caribbean Blacks were born outside\nthe US. Although most non-Hispanic Whites and African\nAmericans lived in the South, the Northeast represented\nmost Caribbean Blacks (Table 1).\nIn summary, number of medical comorbidities was posi-\ntively associated with lifetime MDD among non-Hispanic\nCaribbean Blacks (P > .05) with diabetes (Table 2). Number\nof medical comorbidities was associated with 12-month\ndiabetes (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThe present study documented racial and ethnic varia-\ntions in the association between number of medical co-\nmorbidities and MDD among individuals with diabetes.\nOur findings suggest that number of medical comorbidi-\nties is associated with higher odds of lifetime and 12-\nmonth MDD among non-Hispanic Whites and African\nAmericans, but not Caribbean Blacks with diabetes. Al-\nthough there is a well-established literature on the effect\nof medical comorbidities in diabetes and other index med-\nical conditions [74, 75], very little is known about race and\nOur finding regarding the positive association between\nnumber of medical comorbidities and MDD among non-\nHispanic White and African American individuals with\ndiabetes is in line with the findings from previous studies\n[51, 76]. There are also studies not showing any effects\nfor comorbidities on patients' outcomes [77, 78]. We\nalso could not show an association between number of\nmedical comorbidities and MDD among Caribbean\nBlack individuals with diabetes. The remaining ques-\ntion is what psychosocial factors explain race and eth-\nnic differences in the link between medical and mental\nhealth.\nSome researchers believe that the effect of somatic co-\nmorbidity on well-being and health is independent of\ntype of comorbidity, index disease, outcome, and popu-\nlation. Although medical comorbidities worsen a wide\nrange of objective and subjective outcomes [19], our\nstudy suggests that these effects may vary across popula-\ntions. Thus, although health care providers should take a\nholistic approach to the subjective well-being of patients\nwith any index disease such as diabetes [19], such inter-\nventions can also benefit from tailoring based on race\nand ethnicity.\nMedical comorbidities are rules rather than exceptions\n[19]. As comorbidities influence multiple aspects of\nsubjective health, health care providers should pay spe-\ncial attention to the existing physical and mental comor-\nbidities; such a comprehensive approach may improve\nphysical and mental well-being of patients [51]. Physi-\ncians and other health care providers who deliver care\nto patients with diabetes should evaluate patients for\nother comorbid medical and mental conditions includ-\ning MDD, however, the screening and management pro-\ntocols that are tailored based on race and ethnicity may\nbe superior in efficacy. In all groups, however, regardless\nof race and ethnicity, early detection and treatment of\ncomorbid conditions should be considered as a univer-\nsal goal.\nAlthough it is not only the index medical condition\nbut also comorbid conditions that impose risk to the\nwell-being of patients, health care providers have a ten-\ndency to exclusively focus on the index disease. Any\nmedical decision for a patient with diabetes should be\nmade while taking into account all medical and psychi-\natric comorbid conditions. Unfortunately, less has been\ndiscussed about the importance of incorporating medical\nand psychiatric comorbidities in the process of care for\nracial and ethnic minority patients with chronic medical\nComorbidity affects prognosis of medical conditions,\nand diabetes is not an exception [81\u00ad85]. Primary health\ncare providers and also specialists should always be en-\ncouraged to consider all chronic medical and mental\ncomorbidities in the process of decision-makings re-\nstudy provides a better understanding of racial and\nethnic differences in the effect of comorbid medical\nconditions on MDD of patients with diabetes, and this\ninformation will hopefully help with the medical\ndecision-making related to the care of patients with\nBefore any final conclusion, all limitations of the\ncurrent study should be discussed. Due to the cross sec-\ntional nature of our study, causal association is implaus-\nible. The results do not suggest whether MDD is a risk\nfactor for multiple comorbid conditions, or comorbid\nmedical conditions cause MDD. The study did not sam-\nple U.S. residents who were not able to undergo an\ninterview in English. Type of chronic comorbid condi-\ntions was not entered into the analysis, as well. This is\nparticularly important because various chronic medical\nconditions may have different psychological correlates\n[88]. In addition, diabetes and also comorbid medical\nconditions were measured using self-reported data,\nwhich is subjected to measurement error (recall bias).\nFurthermore, the result of our study is generalizable to\nthe community sample of adults with diabetes, not ne-\ncessarily to a clinical sample of patients with diabetes.\nFinally, it was also unknown if comorbid conditions such\nTable 1 Demographic and Socio-economic Description of the\nNSAL participants based on race and ethnicityb\nRace/ethnic subgroups\nDemographic\ndata\nAfrican\nAmerican\nCaribbean\nBlack\nWhite Total\nn (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)\nGender\nMarital Status\nNever\nmarried\nRegion\nMean (SDa) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD)\naSD standard deviation\nbWeights have been considered\nas heart disease or stroke were complications of diabetes\nor not. Future research should differentiate between\nmedical comorbidities (such as hypertension, which are\nindependent of the diabetes diagnosis) and medical com-\nplications associated with diabetes (e.g. micro-vascular\nor macro-vascular complications) which are secondary\nto diabetes. Due to the above limitations, the results\nshould be interpreted with caution.
