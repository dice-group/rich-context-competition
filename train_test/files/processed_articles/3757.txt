The control group comprised age-, sex- and clinical characteristic-matched patients\nundergoing non-PMM flap reconstruction. All patients completed the Disability of the Arm,\nShoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire preoperatively and >1 year postoperatively.\nResults: There was no significant difference between pre- and postoperative DASH scores in the\nthe postoperative DASH score was significantly higher than the preoperative score (7.00 \u00c6 9.13\nand 2.44 \u00c6 3.50, respectively). In the PMM flap group, flap size was significantly associated with\npostoperative DASH score.\nConclusion: PMM flap reconstruction has a small but significant negative effect on upper\nextremity dysfunction.\n",

Studies\nhave variously indicated that any loss in\nshoulder function is well tolerated,6 while\nothers have presented patients who were\nunable to return to normal function after\nPMM flap surgery.7 The aim of the present\nstudy was to investigate the effect of PMM\nflap surgery on upper extremity function.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited consecutive patients\nwho underwent PMM flap reconstruction\nfollowing head and neck cancer excision at\nthe First Affiliated Hospital of China\nMedical University, Shenyang, China,\nThe control group comprised patients who\nreceived a non-PMM flap reconstruction\nfollowing head and neck cancer excision.\nControl patients were matched to PMM\npatients by sex, age (!5 years), tumour stage\n(according to the International Union\nmary tumour site and type of neck dissection\n(selective vs modified radical). In all neck\ndissections, the spine accessory nerve was\npreserved and levels I, II and III were\ndissected.\nThe China Medical University institu-\ntional research committee approved the\nstudy. All participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nDASH questionnaire\nAll patients completed the Disability of the\nArm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) ques-\ntionnaire9 preoperatively and at >1 year\npostoperatively. This questionnaire evalu-\nates symptoms and the ability to perform\neveryday activities, and reflects upper-extre-\nmity function regardless of which hand/arm\nis used. DASH comprises two components:\ndisability/symptom questions (30 items,\neach scored 1\u00ad5); and optional high per-\nformance sport/music or work questions\n(four items, each scored 1\u00ad5). The final\nhigher scores indicating more severe\ndisability.\nStatistical analyses\nDue to previous conflicting data it was not\npossible to calculate the actual incidence of\npostoperative complications and the\nrequired least sample size.

Pearson's and Spearman's\ncorrelation coefficients were used to deter-\nmine associations between clinical and\ndemographic factors, and postoperative\nDASH score. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS\u00d5 version 13.0 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nA total of 59 consecutive patients who\nunderwent PMM flap reconstruction com-\npleted the preoperative DASH question-\nnaire, but 13 died in the first postoperative\nyear.

The\neffect of neck dissection on shoulder func-\ntion is well documented. Selective neck\ndissection has a better outcome than radical\nneck dissection, with the risk of injury\n(including neural injury, local devasculari-\nzation and decompression injury) to the\naccessory nerve reduced if the level 5 nodes\nare not included. Patients undergoing level\n2\u00ad4 dissection have less shoulder dysfunc-\ntion that those undergoing level 2\u00ad5 dissec-\ntion,10 and those who undergo modified\nradical neck dissection report more severe\ndisability (``shoulder syndrome'') than other\npatients.11 Although the current study\nTable 1.

It is therefore important that studies\nare designed to exclude these effects of neck\ndissection.\nThe few studies evaluating the associ-\nation between PMM flap reconstruction and\nshoulder function did not take the effect of\nneck dissection into account. A retrospective\nstudy found that PMM flap reconstruction\nresulted in minimal or low shoulder mor-\nbidity.12 Another study compared both\nshoulders in patients who underwent PMM\nflap surgery, and found significantly reduced\nflexion angle and strength, as well as higher\ndisability scores, in the donor shoulder\ncompared with the non-donor side.13\nThe effect of radiotherapy on upper\nextremity function is unclear. Postoperative\nradiotherapy in patients who undergo neck\ndissection has been shown to result in a 20%\ndecrease in the range of shoulder motion\ncompared with patients who undergo neck\ndissection but no radiotherapy.14 In add-\nition, a tendency towards reduced shoulder\nfunction in patients undergoing postopera-\ntive radiotherapy has been reported.15\nHowever, others have found no apparent\nnegative effect of radiotherapy on shoulder\nfunction.16,17 The current study did not\nexamine the effect of radiotherapy, and this\nshould be evaluated in future studies.\nTo our knowledge, the present study is\nthe first to evaluate the effect of PMM flap\nreconstruction on upper extremity function\nas determined by DASH score. The DASH\nquestionnaire is brief, self-administered and\nmultifactorial, and has sufficient detail to\nidentify subtle changes. It has high reliability\nand credibility in assessing upper extremity\ndysfunction.18,19 PMM flap reconstruction\nresulted in significantly higher DASH scores\n(i.e., more extensive upper extremity disabil-\nity) compared with preoperative values in\nthe present study. However, it should be\nnoted that all patients were evaluated !1\nyear after surgery, and early physical ther-\napy is known to improve the recovery of\nshoulder function.20 Furthermore, the mean\npostoperative DASH score after PMM flap\nsurgery was 7.0 (of a possible maximum of\n100), indicating that any damage caused was\nnot severe.\nThere was a positive correlation between\nflap size and DASH score in the present\nstudy. This may be due to the greater extent\nof muscle damage associated with a larger\nflap, since the pectoralis major has an import-\nant role in rotation, flexion and adduction of\nthe shoulder. In a finding consistent with\nothers, there was no association between\npostoperative DASH score and age.12\nThe present study had several limitations,\nprimarily the lack of randomization. In\naddition, objective measurements would\nallow evaluation of the mechanism by\nwhich PMM flap reconstruction affects\nupper extremity function.\nIn conclusion, after taking into account the\neffect of neck dissection, PMM flap recon-\nstruction has a small but significant negative\neffect on upper extremity dysfunction.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
