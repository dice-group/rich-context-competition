Following a\nreview of current research in the field (S. J.

CRT is intimately\nconcerned with the methods for articulating and listening to\nvoices which have been eschewed, disadvantaged, and\nsilenced; it therefore pays particular attention to the\nnecessity to reflect the voices of those who are the\nsubject/object within the research (Ladson-Billings, 2003;\nA Deleuzian perspective on school-based beliefs and\npractices contends that they are articulated through\nlanguage, symbols, bodily movements, and behaviors\nwithin particular spaces, as well as being embodied in the\nsocial structures which are created, maintained, and\nway, there is scope for the creative reinterpretation of\nexisting cultural systems because, as argued by Mayo\n(2000), the creative use of language can alter behaviors and\npractices providing scope for divergent and somewhat\ntemporary systems to arise, these nonetheless alter the\ninitial trajectories of power and discourse. The concept of\norganic repositioning draws on rhizomic analogies\nhistorical genealogies of Foucault and the universal\ngrammar associated with Chomsky are broken down to\nreveal a series of multifarious interconnectivities, which are\nreflected in the workings of the rhizome that\nceaselessly establish connections between semiotic chains,\norganizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts,\nsciences, and social struggles. A semiotic chain is like a tuber\nagglomerating very diverse acts, not only linguistic, but also\nperceptive, mimetic, gestural, and cognitive. (Deleuze &\nThe practices and subjectivities associated with\nschooling become stratified, territorialized, and organized,\nbut in so doing they also encompass spaces for collapse and\nthis facilitates the regeneration of novel ideas and practices,\nwhich are referred to as \"lines of deterritorialization\" or\nThe application of the methodological framework relied\nupon qualitative-based research in two schools in\nClareborne1: Hopton Primary (a local authority [LA]\nmaintained school) and St. Anthony's (a Roman Catholic\nSchool). Research was conducted over a 9-month period\nrestricted to Year 6, the final year of primary education.\nThe total enrollment in Hopton Primary is 535 pupils; in\nthe two Year 6 classes, there were six pupils for whom\nEnglish was an additional language: three Polish pupils, two\nfrom Latvia, and one from Lithuania. In Hopton, the\nresearch focused on the experiences of these six pupils, of\nwhom only one was male. I also collected data from\ninterviews and observations involving the three Year 6\nteachers in the two classes: Mrs. Harris who taught in Class\n6A, Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Neary, the special educational\nneeds coordinator (SENCO), who time-shared the teaching\nof 6B. In addition, I interviewed Ms Bronowski, a Polish\nimmigrant who was a qualified teacher but who acted as a\nteaching assistant (TA) with responsibility for pupils with\nEnglish as an additional language (EAL). I had many\ninformal conversations with other staff at the school and I\ncommunicated frequently with and interviewed Mr.\nHawkes, the deputy head teacher with responsibility for\nSt. Anthony's Primary school had a total enrollment of\n209 pupils. It was a single form entry and in Year 6, a total\nof nine pupils were identified as having EAL; two of these,\na boy and a girl, were of Polish heritage, one boy was\nFilipino and the other six were of Kerala Indian heritage;\nfour of these pupils were boys and two were girls. All of\nthese pupils agreed to take part in the research. I conducted\nobservations in the Year 6 classroom and also interviewed\nMrs. Beckett the class teacher. She also acted as a deputy\nhead teacher and was responsible for leading on; literacy,\nModern Foreign Languages and the Performing Arts. I also\ninterviewed Mrs. Sexton, the higher level TA who worked\nin this class, and the Polish TA, Mrs. Walicki who had\nresponsibility for EAL within the school. In addition, I\ninterviewed the head teacher Mrs. Whittington. The\nmethods used in the research included\n a piloting of the research in a West-Midlands primary\nschool,\n the critical analysis of school documentation,\n semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders;\nSENCOs, TAs, head and deputy head teachers, and\npupils within the schools,\n Observations in formal and informal settings,\n Photo-voice interviews with participating pupils.\nThe Policy Context: A Review of Pertinent\nLiterature\nThe official English policy context toward the recognition\nof learner identity and difference is ambiguous, and there\nare contrasting views as to how schools are expected to\naddress societal inequalities and their impacts on pupils'\nlearning. According to the national school inspectorate\nagency charged with ensuring educational quality, \"equality\nand diversity are important to learners' success (and)\nlearners cannot achieve well unless individual needs are\nmet, the provider is inclusive, and equality and diversity are\npromoted well\" (Office for Standards in Education\nurged to \"place greater emphasis on the impact for learners\nand reduce the focus on policies and procedures\"\nessentialized so that normed student attainment levels\nbecome the primary criteria for determining how well\nschools engage with diversity. Over a decade ago, schools\nwere provided with a clear vision for how the concept of\ninclusion might be realized within and beyond the school.\nHead teachers, staff, and inspectors were informed that\nAn educationally inclusive school is one in which the teaching\nand learning, achievements, attitudes and well-being of every\nyoung person matter. Effective schools are educationally\ninclusive schools. This shows, not only in their performance,\nbut also in their ethos and their willingness to offer new\nopportunities to pupils who may have experienced previous\ndifficulties. This does not mean treating all pupils in the same\nway. Rather it involves taking account of pupils' varied life\nAt the heart of the project of becoming an inclusive\nschool was a realization that processes were important and\nhad the potential to impact on ethos. In addition, teachers\nwere encouraged to place pupils' cultural and linguistic\ndifferences to the forefront of curriculum enactment\nsignificantly from that offered to educators a decade ago.\nContemporaneously, at a national level the official narrative\nof cultural inclusion is increasingly obscured by a focus\nupon drivers for improving standards through competition\nand outputs. These external constraints define the ever\nrestrictive boundaries within which schools and teachers\noperate and place limitations on the requisite latitude to be\ncreative and cognizant of difference (Ainscow, Booth, &\nIt remains to be determined whether in the current\nclimate schools still engage in practices of \"institutional\nracism,\" such practices were described as entailing\nThe collective failure of an organisation to provide an\nappropriate and professional service to people because of their\ncolour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in\nprocesses, attitudes and behaviour which amount to\ndiscrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance,\nthoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage\nWith its realization that racism may be evidenced in\nsocial practice rather than being reflected in outcomes alone\nit will be challenging to subject discrimination to official\nexternal monitoring. Thus, it is possible that certain school-\nbased behavior may be constructed on values and beliefs\nwhich are inadvertently exclusionary and racist (Devine,\nshifts to educational outcomes and interschool\ncompetitiveness, local policy and provision for the\ninclusion of those from minority ethnic communities is in a\nstate of extreme flux resulting in a fragmentation of services\nwhere it is increasingly challenging for schools and teachers\nto access previously available supports and professional\nadvice (Chowdry & Sibieta, 2011; National Association of\nSchoolmasters Union of Women Teachers [NASUWT],\n2012). These services, as provided through LAs, were\nidentified as having a pivotal role in assisting teachers to\nengage more effectively with cultural and linguistic\ndiversity (Tikly, Osler, & Hill, 2005; White, Lewis, &\nFletcher-Campbell, 2006). In this context, it is important to\ngauge the effects that a dramatically shifting policy\nlandscape has had in terms of pedagogy and practice.\nFindings From the Research: Analyzing\nWider Values and Policies\nDuring the research time frame, a socio-political narrative\nemerged portraying immigrants as exploitative and\nrelease from the Prime Minister's office reported, \"There's\na lot more to do to make sure that while we're welcoming,\nwe don't allow people to come here and take advantage of\nus, because I think that does happen too often\" (Jowitt,\n2013). A notional dichotomy is created between the\nwelcoming British and those from without who connive to\nfurther their own selfish agendas. The characterization\nfacilitates claims that strains in national services are\nattributable to the (unwelcome) presence of immigrants\n(Skidmore, 2013). As recognized by Deleuze and Guitarri\n(1987), \"everything is political, but every politics is\nsimultaneously a macropolitics and a micropolitics\" (p.\n213). National policy dialogs are interpreted and transposed\ninto the affective domain of subjects within local settings.\nThe positioning of the research in a relatively rural town\nwas significant. Two teachers in Hopton Primary\nrecognized and identified how the external to school space\nand its attendant social engagements had an impact upon\nthe educational and social experiences of migrant pupils.\nMrs. Neary expressed a concern about the impact of\nmajority community parental views on the values and\nbehaviors of children within the school because there was a\nhistory of some parents lodging complaints about the\npresence of Polish pupils within the school. She was very\nconcerned about the effects of societal racism and how this\nmight manifest within the school. In her view,\nI come from here, but it is a very small-minded county and I\nthink they find it very hard to accept that Polish and Portuguese\nare our biggest intake in population, they don't like the\n\"invasion\" (here she signals inverted commas) of other people.\nFor some reason, that small-minded attitude here is, \"they're\ntaking our houses, taking our jobs, our land and they're . . .,\" so\nyeah, it kind of has an impact. We have started on that build up\nof trying to overcome those issues, but there is a long way to\ngo. (Interview: Mrs. Neary, Hopton Primary)\nMs. Bronowski, the EAL teacher, had been working as a\nTA at the school for 3 years; in that time she noticed that\npeople's social attitudes have changed in the locality and\nthis has influenced her own sense of belonging. Ms.\nBronowski spoke about how the name place signs for the\ntown had been defaced, so that they now read, \"welcome to\n4 SAGE Open\nPoland\" instead of \"welcome to Clarebourne.\" For Ms.\nBronowski, the Polish EAL teacher, there is a sense that the\nexternal space has become somewhat hostile to foreigners:\nI think myself and most of my friends we just now feel really\nconscious and quite careful really about what we say and\nsomething that hasn't happened before like excusing ourselves\nthat we are here. Previously, I really didn't have to explain, I\nmean like saying, \"oh I am sorry I am here, sorry that I live\nhere,\" I didn't have to do it before, whereas now there is that\npressure on you to explain yourself and explain what really you\nbring here to this place that can explain whether you should be\nhere or not. And even though no one ever says that to me, you\nfeel urged to somehow excuse yourself for your very existence.\n(Interview: Ms. Bronowski, Hopton Primary)\nThere is a new self-awareness among immigrant\ncommunities, a sense of difference prompted by wider\nsociological and political forces, which seek to exclude and\nemphasize otherness. On the day of the Prime Minister's\nstatement, of which Ms. Bronowski was unaware, she\nshared,\nthe very word multiculturalism . . . it doesn't really exist really\nany more. I don't know, it is just more about feelings, just\nsensing things rather than really experiencing them but, I feel\nlike . . . we were more welcome here those six, seven years ago\nthan we are now as Eastern European workers. I think the\nwhole society, it has been described as broken, but I think also\nputting people against each other and because of the difficult\nfinancially and the political climate, I think there are more\nthings being allowed to be said and more of an overall feeling\nthat society has become more xenophobic. (Interview: Ms.\nBronowski, Hopton Primary)\nFor this Polish teacher of English, changing political\nsentiments are conjoined with economic factors to alter the\ninterrelationships with others making for a \"sense\" of\ndiscomfort and the unease of being other. The teacher\nconcerned can almost \"feel\" the impact of political and\nsocial wider thinking.\nWithin the intertwined national, regional, and local\ncontext, policy development and its mediation take place\nwithin schools while, \"through a combination of both media\nhype and social and political hype, `threat' profiles are\nsocially constructed based on physical characteristics;\ncountry of origin and language\" (Ortiz & Jayshree, 2010, p.\n179). The dialog is compounded by an emerging policy\nnarrative, as shared recently by the chief inspector of\nschools that reinterprets educational disenfranchisement by\nsplintering particular cohorts into those deserving of\nadditional resources within schools, for example, \"our\"\nWhite, British, working class boys, against those who may\nno longer be deserving of attention, such as Afro-Caribbean\nor \"other\" males (Adams, 2013). The external policy\nnarrative was reflected in St. Anthony's. When asked about\nthe educational engagement of pupils for whom English\nwas an additional language, the head teacher responded,\nWe looked at data for closing gaps to show where we were\nweaker, where we needed significant improvement, and our\nparticular group within this school is summer born children,\nand so the weakness is there rather than in fact whether\nchildren are Malayalam and EAL children. They pull our\nfigures up, their data is very strong, and it is our White British\nboys that we're concerned about. (Interview: Mrs. Beckett)\nThis reading of the data was at odds with the spatial\norganization of the Year 6 class in St Anthony's where\npupils from ethnic minority backgrounds were\nsignificantly underrepresented in categorizations of \"top\nperforming\" groups for English and Math classes and\nwere as equally represented as British pupils in the\n\"lowest\" groups. The practices of differentiated and\ncategorizing grouping are themselves problematic and\ninfused with aspects of power, politics, affect, and\npractices as expressions of the external policy agenda\ncreate an image of being meritocratic, while they are \"shot\nthrough with challenging assumptions\" (Cole, 2011, p.\n552). Policy orientations potentially mask systematic\ninequalities of privilege, power, and unintentional\ninstitutional racism within schools (S. J. Ball, 2013;\nThere are subtle interplays between the role of national\npolicy discourses and how these are \"bought into\" by\nteachers and the ways in which schools may seek to\nreinterpret or redevelop their own transpositions of policy\norientations (S. J. Ball, Maguire, Braun, & Hoskins,\nand linguistic knowledge as exemplified in performance\ndata sets deficiently labeling cohorts of students as;\n\"English not as first language\" (Department for\nEducation, 2012), this clearly identifies these pupils as\nhaving potential to underperform. The fix for the need is\nto attend to the English language deficit and to bracket\nthe pupils into appropriate \"performance sets\" to address\nthe \"problem.\" A subtle policy reorientation away from\nappreciation for multilingualism as exemplified in the\nexpression of having \"English as an additional language,\"\nhas the potential to influence ways in which policy\nbecomes practice.\nWhile St. Anthony's Primary School Inclusion Policy\nindicated the school would\ncelebrate the achievements of pupils who are bilingual and\nencourage pupils for whom English is a second language to\nfeel proud of their linguistic talents and to continue to use and\ndevelop their first language. (St. Anthony's, Inclusion Policy,\n2009, available on the school website\u00ad\u00adanonymous)\nHosting an inclusive language policy does not\nnecessarily lead to the practice of an appreciation for\nmultilingualism within the school. When questioned about\nthe extent to which pupils' languages were incorporated\nwithin the school, the senior TA, who also acts as the\nschool's EAL coordinator, responded,\nI don't think very much, because I don't really know what a\nparticular policy or curriculum says, but as far as I am\nconcerned from observing what's happening in classes, I think\nteachers are trying to get everything down to one point, so\nthere isn't really sort of . . . there isn't much happening really\non the celebration of the differences let's say, you have got\ndifferent cultures . . . no you need to sit down and write a\nproper English sentence sort of thing. (Interview: Mrs. Waliki,\nEAL TA, St Anthony's Primary)\nPolicies are also enacted through school-based practices.\nAccording to the study of ways in which the Ethnic Minority\nAchievement Grant (EMAG) was used in schools (Tikly,\nOsler, & Hill, 2005), policy makers and educators would do\nwell to ensure that the grant was targeted to address\ninstitutional racism, provide clear ideas for literacy\nenhancement programs, and enable the adoption of a more\ninclusive curriculum. However, recent policy developments\nhave moved significantly away from such advice by ensuring\nthat local schools fora are allowed to \"de-delegate\" LA\nmaintained EMAG school funds. Under this new system,\nthere is no accountability mechanism regarding schools' use\nof this funding (National Association for Language\nDevelopment in the Curriculum [NALDIC], 2013). Schools\nmay decide whether or not to expend funds on supporting the\nsocial and educational support of pupils from ethnic minority\nbackgrounds. Consequently, Mrs. Neary, the SENCO in\nHopton Primary, argued, \"I do have this horrid feeling that\nit's going to get worse again because if we need to access the\nEAL team it has to come out of our service level agreement\nbudget,\" with competing demands the pupils from ethnic\nminorities will not emerge as beneficiaries within an\n\"architecture of policy positions within which divergent\nUltimately, schools are sites where policies \"riddled with\npower concerns\" (Cole & Masny, 2012, p. 2) are contested\nand practiced and these influence options for ethos and\nculture. Drawing direct causal lines between policy and\nschool-based effect is problematic. Nonetheless, tangents of\nassociation do link policies, practices, and the resultant\nartifacts and spaces which become the enactment of policy\n2011). The \"entanglements of policy associations\"\nand performatives which are imbued with power relations\nand these are manifest in the ways schools provide for\nlearning within differing cultural settings.\nExploring the Relationships Between\nSchool Cultures and Pupil Identities\nThe second key question sought to highlight\ninterrelationships between enactments of school cultures\nand their influences on individual creativity, potentials for\nfreedom of expression as well as their constraining\npotentialities. Contemporary interpretations of school\ncultures see them as being imbued with \"a relational sense\nof context\" (Taylor-Webb & Gulson, 2012) where actors\nwith prior experiences and beliefs coalesce in particular\nspaces and times to form a heteroglossia of\ninterrelationships imbued with power (Foucault, 1986, p.\n118). These have significant implications for practices of\nlearning and teaching. They are also informed by external\ndiscursive formations of \"sovereign, communal meanings\"\ngranted and normative assumptions about the nature of\neducation and how it ought to be realized in schools.\nHowever, there is scope for disruption in communal\npractices and perceptions. The Deleuzian concept of\nrhizomic flight provides a conceptual gateway through\nwhich historical and social norms may be ruptured giving\nway to unpredictable avenues where differences flourish\nand become sites for learning. Creativity is enabled because\nrhizomic actions and sensibilities reflect the features of the\nrhizome, which is\nan acentric nonhierarchical network of entangled and knotted\nloops, folding and growing through multiple sites of exit and\nentry. Rhizomatic growth is contrasted to arboreal or tree\ngrowth in that the latter is hierarchical and bound to one trunk,\nwhereas the rhizome is a network of proliferating roots and\nBecause the research took place in Year 6 classes, for the\nschools concerned the primary grand narratives, or\nmanifestations of the arboreal, coalesced to form\n\"communal meanings\" related to national Standardized\nAchievement Tests (SATs) and levels of pupils' attainment.\nIn addition, there were concerns about the changing nature\nof the national curriculum and how it might be best\ndelivered. The ever looming prospect of external\naccountability through the school inspection process\nconducted by OFSTED also permeated actions and dialogs,\nand these in turn shaped perceptions and expectations of\npossible pupil achievements. Categorizations were created\nand pupils were subsequently assigned, sectioned, and\nbracketed according to perceived ability or impossibility of\nlearning. The systematic grouping of pupils was also\noverlaid with notions of behavior and discipline, where\nnaughty and unruly boys were assigned to the lowest\ncorresponded with my observations in both the schools and\nin all three of the classes I observed. While discussing the\nrationale for grouping with the head teacher in St Anthony's\nschool, groupings were discussed as follows:\nA class will group for maths and for English and then it is\nweighted depending on the paper they are going to be sitting, I\nthink whether they are an EAL child or not they can then have\nthat self image and with their self-esteem they might then start\n6 SAGE Open\nto think, \"I am good at this,\" or \"I am not so good at that,\" but\nthere are EAL children within the Year 6 grouping who are\nspread throughout the class within the different groups so that\nyou have some in the top group, some in the middle group,\nsome who were needing more support. (Interview: head\nteacher, Mrs. Wittington, St Anthony's Primary)\nThe use of the word weighted reveals the contrastive\nanalyses used to assign individuals according to their\nperceived intellectual weightiness and how they are\nascribed to groups accordingly. The process corresponds\nwith Foucault's (1991) analysis of how educational\nestablishments create mechanisms of disciplinary and\nsorting powers. These produce hierarchical classifications\nto delineate spaces that correspond to the worthfullness of\nindividuals using criteria of \"bodies, activities and time\"\nappears troubled by the experience, she realizes there may\nbe affective side effects associated with the sorting\nmachine's end results, and there is a recognition that pupils\nmay internalize emotive fallout from the process. However,\nfor the rational logic of the system to stay intact and for\npupils to operate effectively,\nThey need to tolerate those differences with each other and that\nis quite a hard skill for children to learn; \"I am ok with this,\nand in fact I am good at that, but I need a bit of help with this\"\nand that is a tough message, because rather than think the\nworld will come crashing down and \"I am no good,\" you just\nhave to make sure that if those groupings are set in place what\ndo the children still recognise as their strengths even if they\nneed support. (Interview: head teacher, Mrs. Wittington, St\nAnthony's Primary)\nIt is not that the system of grouping that is perceived as\nbeing problematic, rather the necessity for individual pupils\nto come to terms with their own standing within the groups.\nHowever, from a pupil's perspective this situation is very\ndifferent. In an interview with Tanvi, a female pupil of\nMalayalam heritage, the educational experience is seen as\nbeing analogous to the medical; a recurring concern within\nTanvi's narrative is the concern for how to \"get better,\" her\nacademic performance is an illness from which hard work\nwill make her recover.\nResearcher: Let's have a look at some of the other photos,\nwhat's this one?\nTanvi: Well, that's some books and I like reading because I can\nlearn from them and know how to get better at writing stories .\n. . and I could get to a higher group than am now . . .\nResearcher: So what group are you in now?\nTanvi: Em . . . (4 s delay) eh, well we don't have names for the\ntables, but eh . . . I'm in like the second lowest (photo\ninterview, Tanvi, St Anthony's).\nThe concern is that such practices \"systematically\nelevate the standing of notions such as ability, intelligence,\ntalent, and learning difficulty\" (Cremin & Thomas, 2005, p.\n432), while the concepts should be openly interrogated\nwithin schools as being socially constructed. Just as pupils\nare weighed and measured, so too are the schools:\nWe are very much prescribed by Government, this is what you\ncan teach and you know we do work towards that because this\nis the same as any other school, this is how we are measured so\nto a certain extent we will play the game and get ourselves\nmeasured and come out at the right end, at the end of the day it\nis data that will make us float or sink as a school. (Interview:\ndeputy head teacher, Mr. Hawkes, Hopton Primary)\nThe cultural parameters within which schools operate are\nguided by organizing principles of grouping and\ndifferentiation to which they are subjected, and these have\nas its basis \"the primary and fundamental character of the\nnorm\" (S. J. Ball, 2013, p. 51). The norm is established in a\npublic domain of comparative data analysis and is\ndependent upon classroom-based practices of \"educational\ntriage\" involving\nthe deployment of notions of ability and intelligence, notions\nthat are suffused with age old ideas of race and class hierarchy\nand which cement these classifications and their hierarchical\narrangement and normalize the uneven distribution of\nopportunities and outcomes across differentiated groups of\nWhat is important here is that the delimiting dialogs of\n\"good work,\" \"effort,\" and acceptable and resistant\nbehaviors fashion the ways in which pupils and teachers\nthink about and engage with their work and produce shared\nunderstandings about what is acceptable. For example, as\nidentified in my observation notes in Mrs. Beckett's class\nthe contributions from Wojciech, a Polish pupil adjudged to\nhave special educational needs in addition to \"being EAL,\"\nwere imbued with suspicion and tinged with\nunacceptability. However, when Wojciech is supervised by\na perapathetic teacher in ICT class, he becomes animated\nand creative. A co-constructor of knowledge that belies his\nnormative status of EAL/SEN person (Class observation,\nfieldnotes, St. Anthony's). Though the narrative of norming\nis pervasive, creative movements along the lines of flight\ncan disrupt the prevailing order of things by producing\nmultiple becomings that are collective, dynamic, and social\nThis is also reflected in one of my classroom experiences\nin St Anthony's. According to my field notes from February\n2013, I arrive at Mrs. Beckett's classroom and am struck by\nthe tectonic shifts that have taken place, I have been away\nfrom the room for no more than 10 min and in the interim,\nthere has been a change of subject focus from mathematics\nwith its solidly defined groupings to religious education\nwhere pupils are enabled to intermingle. The class spirit has\nlifted; there is open communication, sharing, and\ncollaboration. A buzz of excited voices fills the classroom.\nMovement has taken hold of sedentary bodies because each\npupil was provided with a piece of information that all\nneeded to complete a comprehensive class-based learning\npuzzle. I feel as if I have been in two very different places:\none of control and segregation, the other a place of\ndynamism, movement, and full of learning potential.\nLines of flight can come about from opening doors to\noutside, so that affectation takes hold of the educational\nspace. During their interviews, three of the teachers in\nHopton Primary spoke of the school's openness to the wider\ncommunity. Mr. Hawkes spoke excitedly about an open day\nfor grandparents, a concept borrowed from the Polish\nschool system:\nWe actually did it the day of our Ofsted inspection, which of\ncourse we didn't know this, but it just happened to be the\nsame time, we invited the grandparents of our year one and\ntwo children into school, at one point we did have\ngrandparents down the corridor, out the door, across the car\npark and down, down the road queuing to come in, we were\nslightly having kittens at that point, I think we had\u00ad\u00adI think\nthis is against all the fire regulations you can possibly have\u00ad\u00ad\nwe were getting on for nearly like 600 grandparents, it was\nabsolutely amazing. (Interview: Mr. Hawke, deputy head\nteacher, Hopton Primary)\nThe engagement of grandparents from the community\nmight represent a contra \"flow of energy,\" which is\ndifferentiated from the normative patterns or discourses of\nfor the difference outside to take hold within the school and\ninternal difference had been elevated to the level of the\nabsolute, it is the difference of pupils that motivates the\nschool to incorporate and follow that difference as a line of\nflight from normative educational experiences (Cole, 2005).\nA normed and currently accepted conceptualization of\ndifference as expressed in grouping according to ability is\nreferred to as \"differentiation\"; however, the practice is in\nfact a tyranny of repetition and sameness designed to limit\npotentialities for creativity and innovation, which is the real\nsite for difference as the beginning of learning (Ringrose,\nDifference as the basis for pedagogy is not universally\naccepted or practiced within schools, and this pertains\nparticularly to the non-recognition of pupils' home\nlanguages. During the early phases of the research, when I\nmet with pupils for the first few times, I wanted to share\nwith them my belief that knowledge of differing languages\nis a positive part of who we are, some of my early field\nnotes recorded such an incidence in St Anthony's. While I\nwas leading the camera research training, I drew on some of\nmy knowledge of Pacific languages to ask Joselito who is\nFilipino to count with me in Tagalog; we count slowly from\none to five: \"isa, dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima,\" he smiles as he\ncounts along with me. Abha, his \"clever girl\" Kerala\nclassmate shares, \"this is the first time I've ever heard him\nspeaking in his own language.\" She seems surprised that he\nis someone who has capacity beyond being one of the boys\nin the second worst performing group in class, someone\nperhaps who might have access to aspects of knowledge\nthat have remained untapped.\nThe silenced languages of pupils are sedimented under a\nhierarchy of linguistic preferences where acceptable other\n\"modern\" foreign languages are featured in the curriculum,\nno rationale is offered to pupils as to why their languages\ndo not matter, it is not explained as to why they are\ninconsequential in the educational world of reified pre-\npackaged knowledge. In Hopton Primary, Spanish is taught\nas a second language once a week, whereas in St Anthony's\nPrimary, all of the pupils learn German. Rendering invisible\npreviously acquired literacy and multilingual fluencies\nrecasts immigrants into an always deficit mode of needing\nto catch up, the characterization is then of the needy student\nwho requires the assistance of others to acquire the accepted\nphonic and literacy skills to become \"more normal\"\n(Stevens, 2009). Pupils' cultural and linguistic selves are\nsubjectivized by such experiences as is evidenced in the\ninterview with Katarina, a \"lower performing\" Polish pupil\nwho has lived in the UK for three years:\nInterviewer: Did you ever write in Polish?\nKatarina: No.\nInterviewer: Would you ever like to?\nKatarina: No, because I don't like it, because it's hard.\nInterviewer: Are there any books in Polish at the school?\nKatarina: Really, I don't know . . . I like using the library and\nreading in England, in English in school because it's much\neasier for me.\nInterviewer: Would you like to know more about Polish\nhistory?\nKatarina: No, emmmm I don't want it, because I'm always\ninterested in em English stuff, em English history, and em\nbooks.\nInterviewer: Would you like to see a Polish teacher?\nKatarina: Em, I already have, she's not really a teacher, she's\nsometimes a helper.\nInterviewer: But would you like to see a Polish teacher or\nhead teacher?\nKatarina: No, it's good to have an English one (Photo\nelicitation interview: St. Anthony's Primary).\nAs a \"lower performing\" pupil, Katarina inhabits the\nperipheries of the classroom and this existence on the edges\nis also a place where her identity and socialization is\ndeveloped. Her space has been identified for her and it is\none for those, \"racialised others who occupy the liminal\nstatus may not be created consciously; rather it is defined\nby the subtleties of absences and presences in literacy, in\nmath, in the geographies of classroom and subject where\nthe terrain does not include Poland or the Polish. These are\nthe unseen dynamics where the curriculum and classroom\ncreate \"hierarchical racial structures\" that bind pupils within\n8 SAGE Open\ncategories \"that serve to maintain unequal order in society\"\nnarrative maintains that all pupils are equal, there is no\nspace to raise the significance of invisible and invidious\nracism where \"difference is deficit, meritocracy is\nappropriate, and English-is-all-that-matters\" (Mitchell,\nwhere the classroom content is peopled by \"majoritarian\nstories, or normative narratives\" that promote racist\noutcomes but where racism is never acknowledged as being\nan issue. However, the experiences of Annessa at Hopton\nPrimary school were somewhat different, as she shared\nduring an interview:\nSometimes we have like a language of the week and in the\nmorning and afternoon we'd have to say like \"good morning\"\nor \"good afternoon\" in that language and it was Russian once,\nbut we haven't done Lituanian and at the time I had to teach\neveryone how to say hello and good afternoon in Russian, so if\nit was this week you'd have to say dobre utra and if it was the\nafternoon you'd have to say dobre dien. (Photo elicitation\ninterview: Hopton Primary)\nAnnessa's role, for at least one day, has been that as a\nknower and guide enabling other pupils and the teachers to\nlearn what she already has acquired. Earlier in the\ninterview, Annessa described England as being her home,\nshe is comfortable with her friends and her surroundings\nand she has no desire to live in Eastern Europe. For her,\nthere are differing dimensions to her Englishness and one of\nthose is the capacity to speak in several languages, which is\na positive attribute to her identity:\nAnnessa: When I'm home with my brother I don't really chat\nto him in Lithuanian, sometimes we might but really the\nwhole time we talk English. With my mum, I speak with\nher Russian, with my mom it's Russian, with my dad\nLithuanian, with my Nan its Russian and Lithuanian, and\nwith my brother it's English, but with my little brother, he's\n4 he was born in England and I talk to him in Lithuanian,\nRussian, and English. When I'm with my family we usually\ntalk Russian and sometimes Lithuanian. In school, I'd like\nto be able to talk Russian, and to teach it 'cos sometimes\nyou have a secret to tell and then you could say it and\nothers would understand.\nInterviewer: How do you feel to have lots of different\nlanguages?\nAnnessa: Quite happy 'cos it might help me with my future\nand it's just good to have more languages than one. I got\nsome Russian books and some Lithuanian books and my\nNan teaches me Russian and I teach myself English in\nschool (Photo elicitation interview: Hopton Primary).\nHaving conducted a comprehensive review of the\nrelationships between the positive incorporation of pupils'\nlinguistic and cultural identities and their concept of self.\nShe also states that there are strong correlations between the\nuse of fist language and the capacity of pupils from ethnic\nminority communities to engage with learning meaningfully\n(O'Hara & Pritchard, 2008). Providing for linguistic\ndiversity within schools also allows for enhanced\ncollaboration with the wider community, which affects\nparental involvement in schools, a key determiner of\nPerceptions of languages and their attendant cultures are\ndetermined according to interpersonal conventions and\nperceptions of what is, or should be identified as \"the\nnorm.\" The extent to which they are incorporated in the life\nof schools is fashioned by the unwritten values and\npractices of acceptance, ambivalence, or antagonism toward\nlinguistic diversity among teachers and pupils alike.\nTeacher subjectivities embody understandings of perceived\npossibilities within the constraints of \"delivering\" a\ntraditional curriculum, as congruence with existing and\nfamiliar social expectations of the non-urban classroom are\nintertwined with such constraints, there are delimiting\nspaces available for exploration and difference within the\nrealms of what might be taught and how it might be taught.\nConclusion\nAs evidenced in the interview with Mrs. Bronowski at\nHopton, the effects of policies which are antagonistic\ntoward others (Aithenhead, 2013) and external to school\nsocial dialogs had profound affective implications, which\nwere simultaneously disempowering and subjectifying. The\nfindings indicate that while there is a place for developing\ninclusive policies within schools, the role of cultural\npractices and values was seen to be more significant in\ninfluencing the ways that teachers engaged with pupils. For\nexample, while there was a very inclusive language and\nculture policy displayed on the school's website at St.\nAnthony's Primary, teachers' practices and a shared belief\nin the \"universality\" of pupil experience were at variance\nwith a commitment to engage positively with difference.\nThe most significant attribute of external influences on\nschool-based practices was associated with the ways in\nwhich space was carved with bodies in preparation for\nstandardized assessments and to facilitate \"individual\ndifferentiation,\" a notion charged with taken-for-granted\nsuppositions and quintessentially laden with values and\npower.\nCultures within schools and classrooms were enmeshed\nwith power flows between and within external and internal\ncomprising an enfolding that involved \"a moving matter\nanimated by . . . movements, folds and foldings that\ntogether make up an inside: they are not something other\nthan the outside but precisely the inside of the outside\"\nexemplified how teachers recreated the culture of schooling\nto define aspects of normality and the shared identification\nof those who were perceived as being beyond the bounds of\neducation.\nHowever, classroom and school cultures were not\nimmutable, there was evidence of cultural changes and of\nrhizomic reorientations, which provided opportunities for\nteachers and for schools to alter cultural forces of\nsubjectivization (S. J. Ball, 2013). Avenues were created\nthat countervailed the regimentation of stigmatizing data\nthrough \"individuation,\" where the Deleuzian concept of\nindividuation is understood as openness to dynamic\nprocesses involving intensive capacity \"to affect and be\naffected\" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. xvi). Affects are not\nsimple personal feelings, but \"becomings that spill over\nbeyond whoever lives through them (thereby becoming\nThis was achieved, for example, within Hopton\nPrimary's willingness to involve the language of the other\nas part of the curriculum and as exemplified by their\nopening of the school gates to the grandparents of pupils\nwithin. In St. Anthony's, this was achieved when pedagogy\nof non-core subjects was released from the constraint of\nhierarchical differentiation enabling individuals to redefine\npredefined concepts of self and identity. Ultimately, by\nsharing ways in which schools engage with difference there\nis a scope to alter powerful policy laden preconceptions and\nto enhance pupils' lived and educational encounters in,\nwith, and through being different.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
