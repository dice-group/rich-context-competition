Miller, PhD, Charles F. Longino, Jr., PhD, Roger T. Anderson, PhD,\nMargaret K. James, MS, and Angela S. Worley, BS\nHealth ecology--that is, environmental adaptations\nto changes in health status--became a more promi-\nnent concern for hospital administration, clinical prac-\ntice, and medical research after Diagnostically Related\nCroups (DRGs) were introduced into government re-\nimbursement regulations for Medicare patients, thereby\nlimiting hospital stays. Environmental adaptations go\nfar beyond discharge planning, however, and are of\nspecial interest in geriatrics and gerontology. The fit\nof persons to their environments in very old age is\nsometimes made problematic by declines in functional\nhealth or by health crises that require extended recu-\nperation. Several kinds of environmental adaptations,\nor transitions, therefore, may result from declining func-\ntional health. A good deal of attention has been paid\nto the health care outcomes of functional declines,\nsuch as institutionalization (Foley et al., 1992; Wolinsky,\n(Guralnik, LaCroiz, Branch, Kasi, & Wallace, 1992;\nManton, 1988). Comparatively little notice (Worobey\n& Angel, 1990), however, has been paid in the healtn\ncare use literature to noninstitutional or community-\nbased moves, in contrast to moves resulting in institu-\ntionalization, as responses to differing levels of func-\ntional health. To what extent are such moves within\nthe community a response to increasing disability?\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute\nAll of the authors are affiliated with the Department of Public Health\nSciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North\nCarolina.\nAddress correspondence to Michael E. Miller, PhD, Department of Public\nHealth Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center\nLitwak and Longino (1987) proposed that there were\nthree, not two, types of elderly migration associated\nwith different periods in the life course. In their typol-\nogy of moves, the first move that older people make\nis now well known; it tends to follow retirement fairly\nclosely. Movers are often married couples in good\nhealth with better than average financial resources\n(Longino, Wiseman, Biggar, & Flynn, 1984) and ap-\npear to be motivated primarily by lifestyle consider-\nations. Wiseman (1980) called this type \"amenity\" mi-\ngration. Of course, only a small minority of retired\npersons ever makes this type of move. It is not re-\nquired in a life course, but if it occurs, it tends to\nhappen early in retirement.\nLitwak and Longino (1987) theorized that the mo-\ntivation in the life course for a second type of move\narises when older people develop instrumental chronic\ndisabilities that make everyday household tasks diffi-\ncult to perform. The presence of a spouse provides\nhelp and motivation for performing these tasks. Brad-\nsher, Longino, Jackson, & Zimmerman (1992) dem-\nonstrated that motivation for this second move is\ncompounded when deficits from widowhood and dis-\nability are combined. As health demands arise, if older\npeople live at a distance from a person who is avail-\nable to provide help and if they cannot adapt their\nliving environments adequately, they must move to\nget the help they need. This type of move is not nec-\nessarily the second in a sequence of moves in the\nindividual's life, even after retirement. However, per-\nsons who make this type of move will have a higher\nmedian age than those making a postretirement ame-\nnity move, and in that cross-sectional sense, it is the\nsecond move of the typology. The third type of move\nis one to a nursing home when the health needs of\nthe older person overwhelm the capacity of the fam-\nily to provide informal support.\nThe existence of the second move was later tested\nby Longino and his colleagues (Longino, Jackson, Zim-\nwaves of the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). In\nkeeping with the conceptual model, their study fo-\ncused on community-based moves and only one di-\nmension of functional disability, measured by instru-\nmental activities of daily living (lADLs; i.e., difficulty\ndoing heavy and light housework, shopping, prepar-\ning meals, managing money, and using the phone).\nThe predicted probability of moving during this 2-year\ninterval, regardless of specified migrant characteristics,\nas produced from maximum likelihood estimation, was\nthe level of disability, while adjusting for other rel-\nevant factors. Findings supportive to this analysis were\noffered at about the same time by Speare, Avery, and\nwho reported that health declines of older parents\nwere associated with residential moves bringing par-\nents and adult children geographically closer to one\nanother. The second move now seems firmly estab-\nlished in the research literature. Our study elaborates\nthe second move concept.\nIn an attempt to explore the mechanisms connect-\ning health and mobility, Zimmerman, Jackson, Longino,\n& Bradsher (1993) examined the economic and inter-\npersonal resources of persons making health-related\nwaves of the LSOA. Family income, however, had no\nindependent effect on mobility in the face of declin-\ning functional health. The availability of assistance in\none's home, then, is a buffer to a health-motivated\nenvironmental adjustment, such as moving, and is\nconsidered in the present study.\nIn the retirement migration literature, the concept\nof place ties has a strong influence on the likelihood\nof moving (Longino et al., 1991). This concept, which\nis drawn directly from geography-based studies of mobility\ntheoretically as a counterbalance to the pushes and\npulls that motivate moves. Ties to place, particularly\namong older adults, often include ties to geographic\nregions and local support networks. The best mea-\nsure of the concept in the LSOA, however, is indi-\ncated by whether the migrant owns His or her dwell-\ning. Home ownership also figured prominently in the\nmodels that were specified in the previously cited\nstudies of health and community-based moves in later\nlife and is included in our model as an adequate rep-\nresentation of place ties.\nWolinsky and his colleagues (Wolinsky & Johnson,\nWolinsky, Johnson, & Fitzgerald, 1992) produced a\nset of five multiple-item scales of functional health taken\nfrom or modeled after various measures of activities\nof daily living (ADLs). In addition to stripped-down\nversions of basic and instrumental (household) ADL\nscales, they added three others. One is an advanced\n(cognitive) ADL scale (difficulty managing money, talking\non the phone, and eating). The other two tapped\nlower body limitations (difficulty walking, standing,\nstooping, and lifting) and upper body limitations (diffi-\nculty sitting, reaching up, reaching out, and grasping).\nFollowing the coding conventions prescribed by Wo-\nlinsky and colleagues, it is possible to relate a much\nricher range of measures for functional health to com-\nmunity-based residential change. In our investigation,\nwe use Wolinsky's definitions to group functional limi-\ntations into meaningful areas, and we further investi-\ngate how the number of limitations within these groups\nmay differentially alter the future probability of a resi-\ndential move.\nThe employment of more complex measures of func-\ntional health allows us to better understand the rela-\ntionships between health demands and geographical\nmobility. Earlier studies relied only on additive ADL\nand IADL scales. Because the present study uses five\nmeasures of functional health, it is possible to sort out\nsome of the subtleties of the effects of health demand\non community-based moves within a general multi-\nvariate model framework accounting for competing out-\ncomes such as institutionalization and death.\nA more thorough examination of mobility and health\nusing LSOA data is now possible because of the\nrecent availability of computer software for analyzing\nmulticategory outcomes (e.g., nominal, ordinal outcomes)\nobtained from longitudinal survey samples (Liang,\nShah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996). Until the release of\nthe MULTILOG procedure in SUDAAN (Shah et al.,\n1996), statistical software that accounts for the survey\naspects of the sample design (i.e., cluster sampling\nof participants with unequal probabilities of selection)\nand permits the specification of models for longitudinal\ndata with multicategory outcomes was not readily avail-\nable. The MULTILOG procedure permits the analyst\nto use generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods\nto perform estimation and inference for longitudinal\nrelease of this software, analysts of categorical outcomes\nobtained from longitudinal survey samples were lim-\nited to use of binary or survival analysis techniques.\nOne GEE method is equivalent to the cluster data\nmethods developed for the analysis of survey sampling\ncan provide a unified approach to the analysis of data\ncontaining dependencies between repeated measure-\nments taken on individuals and within clusters defined\nby the complex survey design (e.g., communities se-\nlected within the complex survey sampling scheme).\nFor analysis of a rare outcome such as a residential\nmove, use of multiple time points for individuals per-\nmits us to investigate whether it is possible to collapse\nall changes between adjacent LSOA interviews (1984-\nof 2-year change. Thus, this type of model can over-\ncome the previously mentioned limitations involv-\ning the small number of community-based moves be-\nmodels available to Longino and colleagues (1991).\nBy taking advantage of all moves occurring during each\ntransition period, this exploratory study asked the\nfollowing question: Does there exist an association be-\ntween the availability of assistance and declining\nlevels of health in predicting a particular type of house-\nhold adjustment (i.e., a community-based move), in\nthe same 2-year time period? Initially, predictors col-\nlected only at the beginning of each interval are used\nto gain a more thorough understanding of the nature\nof future moves. Subsequently, to address the afore-\nmentioned question, we relate the presence of assis-\ntance and changes in functional limitations to the oc-\ncurrence of concurrent community-based moves. As\nsuch, this analysis considers the role of health demand\nas a motivator of geographical mobility.\nMethods\nSample\nData used in our analyses were drawn from all four\nwaves of the LSOA conducted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS, 1990) in collaboration with\nthe National Institute on Aging. The LSOA is based on\nthe 1984 Supplement on Aging (SOA) of the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), a probability sample\nof noninstitutionalized persons aged 55 and older liv-\nlowed over a 6-year period with repeat interviews in\nProxy respondents, often family members, were inter-\nviewed when the respondents were incapable of be-\ning interviewed. Due to financial constraints, only 5,151\nLSOA participants were selected for reinterview in\n1986. We restricted our initial analytical sample to this\nsubsample because participants with missing data in\n1986 aid not contribute information to analyses of\nInformation from participants with unknown status\nin one interval but complete data in two other con-\nsecutive interviews was used in our analyses. This has\nimplications for the number of observations used in\nour models. Participants had to possess covariate in-\nformation at the beginning of each time period to\nOutcome Measures\nResponses given by participants or proxy respon-\ndents at each of the LSOA interviews were compared\nto determine whether a move took place within any\nof the three 2-year periods comprising the LSOA. An\nindividual was categorized as having moved during a\nparticular interval if the individual reported a change\nin residence in that 2-year time period. When data\nobtained from a proxy were inconsistent with infor-\nmation obtained from a later self-interview regarding\nthe time of the participant's move, the data from the\nproxy were ignored. We also determined whether par-\nticipants moved to or remained in a nursing home,\ndied, made no residential transition, or had unknown\nstatus during each 2-year period. We refer to these\nfive nominal outcome categories as \"transition\" states\nin the remainder of this article.\nPredictor Variables\nGender, age, and race were measured in the 1984\ninterview. Gender (men vs women) and race (White\nvs all other races) were considered time-stationary co-\nvariates and their constant values were used to pre-\ndict observed transitions for all intervals within all\nmodels considered. Due to the small number of His-\npanics and members of \"other\" ethnic groups present\nin the sample, a more diverse categorization of race\nwas not possible. Age was measured in 1984 using\n1-year increments and was categorized into 5-year\nintervals from 70 to 90 for use in our models to esti-\nmate a cross-sectional effect of aging on the probabil-\nity of the observed transition. These three predispos-\ning factors have been shown to be related to moving\nin earlier studies (Longino et al., 1991; Jackson, Longino,\nZimmerman, & Bradsher, 1991), and they are rou-\ntinely included in nearly all health behavior studies.\nChange in age since 1984 was used to estimate the\nlongitudinal effect of aging. Because this variable only\ncould take on values of 0, 2, or 4 years, it also repre-\nvariables. We refer to the variable representing this\neffect as the \"survey transition year\" in subsequent dis-\ncussions. Our parametrization of the aging effect is\nsimilar to that described by Laird, Donnelly, and Ware\nWe selected a cluster of variables, generally mea-\nsured during all interviews of the LSOA, that were re-\nlated to the resources inherent in the social environ-\nment. The familial and community resources hypoth-\nesized to modify community-based moves are repre-\nsented by a participant's living arrangement (alone vs\nwith others), marital status, home ownership (yes/no),\nyearly family income, and assistance with three areas\nof functioning. There were no direct measures of par-\nticular community services or social support. Marital\nstatus was coded using three levels: married, widowed\nwithin the previous 2 years, and other status (e.g., di-\nvorced, separated, single, widow for >2 years). Home\nownership, the measure of place ties, was not mea-\nsured in the 1986 interview; thus, for prediction of\nownership values for missing 1986 values. The impact\nof this imputation would be to lessen any estimated\neffect of home ownership on moves. Family income\nin 1984 was coded using an unknown category and\nfour additional categories representing income incre-\nare described below in relation to the defined areas\nof functional status. Finally, the ability to adapt the\nhome environment, although of theoretical importance,\nwas not measured in the LSOA.\nHealth measures make up the primary independent\nvariable. Hospitalization in the previous year was con-\nsidered a characteristic that may capture acute health\nconditions in contrast to the five areas of functional\nstatus developed based on statistical analyses of these\nsame LSOA data by Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, and\nJohnson (1993). These included: (1) Basic Activities\nof Daily Living (BADLs)--any difficulty with bathing,\ndressing, getting out of bed, toileting, or a related item\non walking; (2) Household Activities of Daily Living\n(HHADL)--any difficulty with meal preparation, snopping,\nand light or heavy housework; (3) Advanced Activities\nof Daily Living (AADL)--any difficulty with managing\nmoney, using the telephone, and eating; (4) Lower\nBody Limitations (LBL)--any difficulty with walking a\nquarter of a mile, walking up 10 steps without rest,\nstanding or being on the feet for two nours, stooping,\ncrouching or kneeling, and lifting or carrying 25 pounds;\nand (5) Upper Body Limitations (UBL)--any difficulty\nsitting for two hours, reaching over the head, reach-\ning out as if to shake hands, and using fingers to grasp\nobjects. Several of the functional tasks contained within\nthese LBL and UBL scales involve activities that may\nutilize strength in both lower and upper body areas.\nWithin each of these functional status areas, we de-\nfined variables representing the number of limitations\nreported: two variables were used to represent the\nlevels 0, 1, and >1 limitation within BADLs, HHADLs,\nand AADLs, whereas single variables taking the values\n0-5 and 0--4 were usea for LBLs and UBLs, respec-\ntively. For an individual reporting any difficulties with\nBADLs, HHADLs, or AADLs, we were able to obtain\ninformation regarding whether the person received any\nassistance performing any of the tasks within these\nareas of functioning. The different approach for cod-\ning the number of BADLs, HHADLs, and AADLs, in\ncontrast to LBLs and UBLs, made it possible to in-\nvestigate the effect of assistance within those persons\nreporting only a single limitation versus individuals\nreporting more than one limitation. As previously\nmentioned, these assistance variables were considered\ninterpersonal resources.\nStatistical Modeling--Stage 7\nThe initial model that we investigated used multi-\nvariate logistic regression (Agresti, 1990) to analyze a\nfive-category nominal response with outcomes defined\nas (1) institutionalization; (2) move; (3) death; (4) un-\nknown status; and (5) no move. Although \"no move\"\nis not a literal transition, to simplify the presentation,\nall outcomes are referred to as transition states. Be-\ncause our primary interest was in the'odds of moving\nrelative to not moving, our use of the other categories\nadjusted our analyses for the competing transition\nstates. We present the results from our models in terms\nof ratios of odds for being institutionalized, moving,\ndeath, or unknown status relative to the no move cat-\negory. A mathematical description of both Stage 1 and\nStage 2 (explained in the next section) models is pro-\nvided in the Appendix.\nWe took the following approach for the develop-\nment of the Stage 1 model predicting transitions to\nthe five nominal categories using variables containing\ninformation collected at the beginning of each of the\nthree transition periods. Initially, we entered variables\nrepresenting gender, age, race, hospitalization, mari-\ntal status, living arrangements (alone/others), family in-\ncome, home ownership, and survey transition year effects\ninto the model. We also assumed the presence of an\ninteraction term between gender and age, because a\ndifferential effect of age on death and institutionaliza-\ntion for men versus women was expected. Within this\nmodel, we investigated for two-way interactions be-\ntween gender, age, race, and each other variable, as\nwell as a three-way interaction between marital sta-\ntus, living arrangements, and gender. We had interest\nin developing separate models within strata defined\nby marital status, living arrangements, and gender; how-\never, the total sample sizes available for the move out-\ncome precluded this possibility. The two- and three-\nway interaction terms were retained in the model if\nthey met either of two criterion: (1) if the overall test\nof the effect of the interaction across all outcome cat-\negories was significant at p < .05, or (2) if the overall\ntest was not significant, but the component of the in-\nteraction term related to moves versus no transition\nwas significant at p < .05. Although this approach to\nmodel building runs an increased risk of Type I error,\nwithin our exploratory analysis, to control appropri-\nately for the probability of response in the competing\noutcome states, we felt it necessary to include inter-\nactions when the overall test of the effect across all\noutcome categories was significant. Inclusion of inter-\naction terms related to the move outcome was neces-\nsary as these terms were of primary interest to our\nanalysis.\nTo the aforementioned model, we added the assis-\ntance and functional status variables collected at the\nbeginning of each transition interval. For BADLs, HHADLs,\nand AADLs, using the interaction inclusion criterion\ndescribed previously, we also investigated for interac-\ntions between the number of reported functional\nlimitations and both assistance (for BADLs, HHADLs,\nand AADLs) and living alone.\nBecause individuals in our sample could possess up\n1990), the validity of our modeling approach was con-\ntingent on an investigation for interactions between\nthe variable representing the transition survey year and\nassociated covariates used in these models (see Ap-\npendix for further details). If these interactions were\nsignificant, we would be unable to combine param-\neters across the multiple transition periods, thus ne-\ncessitating the use of separate parameters to repre-\nsent the effects of the variable for each transition\nperiod. The same criterion, as described earlier for\nretaining other interactions, was used to investigate\nsurvey year interactions.\nStatistical Modeling--Stage 2\nTo investigate how changes in functional status were\nassociated with the probability of concurrent commu-\nnity-based moves, we introduced change in functional\nlimitations into the aformentioned model by fitting\nmodels containing both the baseline measure and the\nfollow-up measure. In contrast to the Stage 1 model,\nthis model was not prospective in that both the\nchange in functional status and the transition occurred\nin the same interval. Additionally, because participants\nhad to possess covariate information at the end of\neach interval, it was necessary to exclude from this\nanalysis persons having the outcomes of institutional-\nization, death, and unknown status at the end of\nan interval. Thus, this model made inference only to\nthose noninstitutionalized survivors with known status\nat the end of the 2-year transition period. The num-\nber of observations used in this model was N = 3,862\nsitions.\nUsing initial and follow-up functional status levels\nin this latter predictive model produces results that\nare equivalent to fitting a model containing the initial\nlevel and the change from that initial level. The pa-\nrameters from our model can be used to obtain odds\nratios representing change that are identical to those\nthat would be obtained from a model that explicitly\nmodels change. It is important to note that, for either\nof these approaches, the interaction between the ini-\ntial level and the follow-up level (or baseline and\nchange variables) should be investigated; otherwise,\nthe model may make the restrictive assumptions that\n(a) the effect of change is independent of the starting\npoint, and (b) the odds ratios related to improvements\nare the reciprocal of odds ratios associated with\ndeclines of equivalent magnitude. We investigated\nfor these interactions for all types of functional limi-\ntations.\nModel Estimation\nIndependence estimating equations were used to\nestimate parameters within each model (Liang & Zeger,\nLiang & Zeger, 1986) was used to account for depen-\ndency both within primary sampling units (PSUs) de-\nfined for the original NHIS survey (Kovar, Fitte, & Chyba,\n1992), and between repeated outcomes obtained on\nthe same participant. Because the PSU references the\nhighest level of clustering, with repeated measures taken\non participants falling within single PSUs, this use of\nthe robust variance estimate also accounts for depen-\ndence between the multiple measurements obtained\nfor each participant (Korn & Graubard, 1995). With-\nout use of this robust variance estimate, the standard\nerrors of parameter estimates potentially would be in-\naccurate. When the correlation between repeated out-\ncomes and within clusters is zero, these methods re-\nduce to maximum likelihood.\nAll results that we present are weighted using\nweights that account for the unequal probabilities of\nselection and nonresponse adjustments. It is well known\nthat the use of weights can increase variances of pa-\nrameter estimates; however, parameters estimated in\nweighted analyses are typically less biased than those\nobtained from unweighted analyses. Following the sug-\ngestions of Korn ana Graubard (1995), we estimated\nthe inefficiency that resulted from incorporating weights\nin our analyses. These analyses indicated that the in-\nflation in variances resulting from our use of weights\nwas small; thus, all results are presented in terms of\nweighted analyses. Full details on unweighted analy-\nses are available upon request. Modeling results\nwere obtained using the MULTILOG procedure of\ndures.\nFindings\nDescriptive Results\nTable 1 presents a description of the sample/popu-\nlation. The number of moves and reason for moving\nduring each transition period are included at the top\nof this table. The second type of move, as formulated\nby Litwak and Longino (1987), would include the com-\nmunity-based moves that were motivated by health\nor a desire to live closer to children and possibly some\nmoves listed as residential considerations. Moves listed\nas resulting from residential considerations may include\nmoves resulting in \"better or improved living condi-\ntions, arrangements and environment\" or residential\nlimitations related to \"location, size and design.\" The\nproportion of movers giving at least one of these rea-\n1988.

Our discussion concen-\ntrates on the move outcome and those effects that\nwere significant at p < .05. Because no interactions\nbetween effects and survey transition year were found\nto be significant, we were able to fit common param-\neters across all survey years for each effect (see Ap-\npendix for details).\nOverall, we found that the odds of a move versus\nno transition for men were 1.51 times these odds for\nwomen. As expected, men also experienced signifi-\ncantly greater odds for death. This result is consistent\nwith the unadjusted, weighted probabilities of each\noutcome for men versus women. In the unadjusted\ndata, across all periods, the percentages of movers among\nmen and women are almost equal (5.01% for men vs\n5.44% for women). However, the percentage of men\nthat died exceeded that of women (14.8% for men vs\n9.7% for women), resulting in increased odds ratios\nfor men for both of these outcomes relative to the\n\"no move\" outcome. Age in 1984 showed minimal\nimpact on the probability of a subsequent move, the\nonly significant increase in the odds of moving being\nfor men aged 90 or older, where the odds ratio was\n3.02. For men in this oldest age group, the percent-\nage of men who moved was 8.3%, versus between\n4.5% and 5.5% for men in any other age group. As\nexpected, age did have a significant impact on the\nodds of institutionalization and death.\nNo main effects were found for the odds of moving\nversus \"no move\" for race (p = .19 for move, p = .01\noverall for all outcomes); marital status (p = .32 for\nmove, p = .32 overall for all outcomes); income (p =\n.42 for move, p < .001 overall for all outcomes); or\nhospitalization (p = .98 for move, p < .001 overall for\nall outcomes).

Although not significantly higher, men liv-\ning alone had increased odds for all outcomes versus\nmen living with others, whereas women living alone\nhad essentially equivalent or significantly smaller odds\nthan women living with others. For home ownership,\nboth men and women who owned their homes had\ngreatly reduced odds of moving relative to those who\ndid not own their homes; however, the effect was\nsignificantly stronger among men (OR = 0.26) com-\nUsing the parameter estimates from both the mari-\ntal status and living arrangements variables, we deter-\nmined that for recently widowed men living alone,\ntimes these same odds for married men, of whom\n>95% reported living with their spouse.

The number of\nBADLs did exhibit an influence of borderline statisti-\ncal significance on the odds of moving (p = .07 for\nmove, p = .003 overall for all outcomes). For those\nparticipants reporting a single BADL, the odds of moving\nwere 1.35 times these odds for those reporting zero\nticipants reporting more than one BADL relative to\n2.19). In contrast to increased numbers of BADLs be-\ning associated with increased odds of moving, a non-\nsignificant trend of decreasing odds for moving with\nan increasing number of HHADLs was found (p =\n.12 for move, p = .072 overall for all outcomes). Base-\nline levels of neither LBLs (p = .54 for move, p >\n.001 overall for all outcomes) nor UBLs (p = .26 for\nmove, p = .014 overall for all outcomes) exhibited a\nsignificant effect on the odds of moving.\nAid for BADLs (p = .45) and HHADLs (p = .09)\ndid not exhibit a significant influence on the odds of\nmoving. Interactions between these variables and\nthe baseline levels of BADLs and HHADLs also were\nnot statistically significant (p > .10 for all hypothesis\ntests). In contrast, a significant interaction was found\nbetween the number of AADLs and assistance with\nAADLs (p = .04 for move, p = .20 overall for all\noutcomes). Because the interaction between the num-\nber of AADLs and assistance results in different odds\nratios depending on whether assistance was received,\nwe report in Table 4 the odds ratios associated with\nan increasing number of AADLs separately for those\nreceiving ana/or not receiving assistance. Likewise, odds\nratios for the impact of receiving assistance are re-\nported separately within each level of AADLs.\nConclusions obtained using the adjusted model-\nbased results were very similar to conclusions based\non the unadjusted, weighted percentages reported in\nTable 3.

All of the confidence intervals for\nBADLs contain the value 1, agreeing with the overall\nfinding of nonsignificance of these effects at both\nbaseline and follow-up. Due to the significant interac-\ntion between initial and follow-up levels of HHADLs,\nodds ratios greater than unity were estimated for either\nimprovements or declines in functional status; how-\never, only the odds ratio for improvement from one\nlimitation to no limitations was statistically significant\nat p < .05. The odds ratio for decline from one limi-\ntation had borderline statistical significance (p = .06).\nIn contrast to these findings for HHADLs, all esti-\nmated odds ratios for AADLs were statistically sig-\nnificant (p < .05). For AADLs, after controlling for\nwhether assistance was reported at the earlier inter-\nview, we found that declines were consistently associ-\nated with increased odds of moving, whereas improve-\nments were associated with decreased odds of moving.\nDiscussion\nIn 1993, Wolinsky and associates reported the first\nevidence from the LSOA that declines in certain types\nTable 5.

Specifically, they found that deterioration\nin cognitive function and lower body strength were\nassociated with increased risk of these two outcomes\neven when the effect of other factors (and baseline\nvalues of the disability measures themselves) were netted\nout.\nThe findings of the present investigation represent\nan advance in health ecology by combining the eco-\nlogical changes studied by Wolinsky and those of re-\nsearchers concerned with community-based residen-\ntial moves. In earlier research using LSOA data, Bradsher\nand colleagues (1992) found that the loss of a spouse\ngreatly increases the probability of a move when health\ndeclines. In contrast, our model did not indicate that\nwidowhood within the past 2 years was significantly\nrelated to a move in the subsequent 2 years when\ncontrolling for baseline functional status. The differ-\nence in these results potentially lies in the fact that\nwe did not look just at those experiencing health de-\nclines.\nSimilar to the earlier work of Longino and colleagues\n(1991), we found that home ownership, a surrogate\nfor place ties, had a strong impact on the odds of\nmoving for both men and women. However, we also\nidentified that this relationship is stronger for men than\nfor women. Combining all transition intervals, approxi-\nmately 3.5% of men owning a home made a commu-\nnity-based move; however, of those men who did not\nown homes, slightly more than 11% made moves. For\nwomen, a similar relationship held, with 4% of home-\nowners and 8% of those not owning homes making\ncommunity-based moves. It could be argued that per-\nsons who do not own homes may have already made\ntransitions for reasons related to health deterioration,\nor that they may have fewer financial resources, which\nmitigates against a move. Unfortunately, this question\ncould not be addressed using available LSOA data.\nAfter controlling for numerous baseline health-related\nfactors, this relationship continued to hold up within\nour models. With respect to this relationship, it is im-\nportant to note that much of the same information is\ncontained in the variables representing home owner-\nship, living alone, and marital status. For example, in\nthe absence of either the home ownership or marital\nstatus variables, living alone was highly predictive of a\nmove for men with an odds ratio of 1.5; however,\nwhen either of these variables were in the model, this\nodds ratio dropped to approximately 1.3. When both\nhome ownership and marital status were included, the\nodds ratio further dropped to 1.2. Thus, due to the\ncorrelation between these variables, it was not pos-\nsible to \"tease out\" the full effect of each. The strength\nof the home ownership variable in the presence of all\nother variables, however, does underscore the impor-\ntance of place ties for both men and women.\nA general contribution of our analysis is that our\nmodels illustrate that a combination of factors, includ-\ning the type and number of functional limitations and\nthe presence or absence of assistance, may have dif-\nferential effects on the probability of a residential transi-\ntion. For instance, assistance did not have substantial\nimpact on the probability of a residential transition for\nhousehold or basic ADLs; however, the presence of\nassistance had a substantial impact on the probability\nof a move for participants reporting more than a single\nadvanced ADL Interestingly, inspection of the unad-\njusted, weighted probabilities associated with advanced\nADLs reveals that persons who reported receiving as-\nsistance also had increased probabilities of institution-\nalization and death and a decreased probability of\nhaving unknown status, relative to those who reported\nno assistance. Thus, one hypothesis is that these indi-\nviduals may be somewhat sicker and have already\nmade residential adjustments, whereas those without\nassistance are in the process of making adjustments.\nWolinsky and colleagues (1993) did find lower ini-\ntial levels of basic self-care, such as dressing, bathing\nand toileting, to predict subsequent nursing home\nplacement. Our initial model (see Table 4) also dem-\nonstrated this effect for the institutionalization out-\ncome. However, when Wolinsky and colleagues (1993)\napplied a dynamic model, examining the effect of change\nin disability as a predictor, change in basic self-care\nwas not predictive of nursing home placement. In our\nstudy, such initial levels of basic self-care needs were\nsomewhat predictive of a residential move (p = .07).\nIn the Stage 2 model investigating the impact of change\nin limitations on the probability of a move, the one\nmost closely resembling the dynamic model of Wolin-\nsky and colleagues (1993), interval increases in BADLs\n(controlling for initial level) were not predictive. In-\nstead, similar to the findings of Wolinsky and col-\nleagues (1993), for nursing home placement, the\ndeterioration of advanced (cognitive) ADLs and lower\nbody strength significantly predicted a community-based\nresidential move, even when adjusting for the effect\nof baseline levels of functional health and other fac-\ntors. In this regard, our analysis extends the earlier\nfindings of Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) to encom-\npass residential change as an ecological outcome of\nhealth decline in old age.\nLitwak and Longino (1987) predicted that residen-\ntial moves are one type of environmental adjustment\nthat could be anticipated when functional status de-\nclines. In the face of moderate increases in functional\ndisability, they argued, there would be a correspond-\ning increase in the need for informal social support,\nwhich could be provided best by family members.\nHousehold ADLs (HHADLs), Wolinsky's dimension of\nfunctionality that most closely resembles lADLs, how-\never, showed little utility in predicting community-based\nmoves in the present analysis--that is, until interinterval\nchange in HHADLs is considered apart from its initial\nlevel. In our Stage 2 model, both improvements and\ndeclines were associated with an increased probabil-\nity of moving. The odds ratios, however, were only\nsignificant or of borderline significance for individuals\nwith one limitation at the previous interview. It is this\nchange in ADL level that was emphasized by Litwak\nand Longino as the potential trigger for the second\ntype of move. Based on our results, it appears that\nany instability in HHADLs may, in fact, trigger an ad-\njustment.\nWhen considering our results, one must judge the\npotential limitations of our study. Proximity to chil-\ndren, a consideration that was important in the Litwak/\nLongino model was not addressed in this analysis\nbecause the data were not collected in all intervals.\nLitwak and Longino's (1987) research suggests that\nproximity may be as important to environmental en-\nrichment for some older persons as living with others.\nRegarding analytical limitations, although we report\nparameter estimates and confidence intervals for our\nmodels, we do not report tests of fit for these models.\nUnfortunately, methods for assessing the goodness-of-\nfit of logistic models to longitudinal survey data are\nnot yet fully developed. The dependence between re-\npeated measurements on individuals and observations\nwithin households makes traditional approaches for\nassessing the fit of logistic regression models (e.g., ROC\ncurves, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests) not applicable to this\nMissing from our analyses is a consideration of the\nlag effect between declines in the various types of func-\ntional status and outcomes such as community-based\nmoves. Had we used lagged effects, we would have\noutcome because measures of functional disabilities\nwere not collected prior to the first interview in 1984.\nThus, our analyses have concentrated on how con-\ncurrent changes in functional health and moving may\nbe related, thus, potentially investigating the short-term\nimpact of changes in functional status. However, our\nfindings for the model relating change in various as-\npects of functional status to transitions in the same\ninterval may be limited by the fact that the temporal-\nity of concurrent changes within an interval cannot be\nestablished. When data are collected in 2-year inter-\nvals such as in the LSOA, investigation of concurrent\nrelationships may be the only means of determining\nthe effects of changes in limitations that may have close\ntemporal relationships to subsequent adjustments.\nBecause functional status was collected only every\n2 years among this oldest-old population, a consider-\nation of how lagged effects alter the probability of\ntransitions that subsequently take place anywhere from\n2 to 4 years later might capture how the various mea-\nsures of functional status have long-term effects on com-\nmunity-based residential adjustments. The second type\nof move, as discussed by Litwak and Longino (1987),\nmay turn out to be a cluster of types of health-related\ncommunity-based moves.\nReferences\nAgresti, A. (1990).

Jour-\nAppendix\nModeling Approaches for Stage 1 & 2 Models\nStage 1 Model\nA generalized logit model allowing for both discrete\nand continuous explanatory variables (Agresti, 1990,\np. 313) was used to model the probability of a transi-\ntion (institutionalization, community-based move, death,\nunknown status, no household move) during each\ninterval. Defining ; = 1, 2, 3, as the transition inter-\nval, j = 1, . . . , 5 as the outcome categories, and\nletting k denote the participant in the survey, the ex-\npected probabilities from this model take the form:\nI exp(P;x*)\nHere, xik\nis the vector of predictor variables for the\nkth participant during the ith interval and also con-\ntains indicator variables allowing a transition-year\neffect. For identifiability purposes, we let (35\nrameters associated with no household move during\nthe interval), thus resulting in the multiple logit model:\nThe transition year effect was parameterized with\nvariables to represent the three transition periods. Note\nthat Equation 1 specified common (3s across all transi-\ntion periods. This assumption was tested for each pre-\ndictor variable by fitting an interaction between each\npredictor variable and the transition-year effect. By fit-\nting the common effects across transition years, and\nadjusting for a transition year effect, we were able to\ngain power for investigating relationships between po-\ntential predictors and the relatively rare household\nmove outcome. However, we do note that one draw-\nback associated with this approach is that the power\nto reject the null hypothesis of common effects across\ntransition intervals (i.e., the test of the interactions be-\ntween predictor variables and the transition-year ef-\nfect) may be low for some predictor variables.\nOdds ratios were estimated from the above model\nusing the following approach. Assume, for sake of il-\nlustration, that the logistic model for White males\nrelating the probability of response in the \"Institution-\nalized\" category to the probability of response in the\n\"No Move\" category is specified as\nlog (Prob Institutionalized / Prob No Move)jk\n=\nV, + *c, + **i + ft ** '\nwhere //,, x^, and xR1\nrepresent the intercept, gender\neffect, and race effect, respectively, for this logit model\nwhich also contains the terms j ^ x.k\ncontrolling for both\nother covariates and the transition-year effects. In Table\nA-1, we specify a parameterization that could be used\nto fit a model relating the main effects of gender and\nrace to these five response categories, assuming each\nof the cells in the table contains the additional terms\nThe odds ratios specific to any outcome category\nfor either race or gender, controlling for the other factor,\nare found by exponentiating the differences between\nTable A-1.

Because these vari-\nables could only be obtained on noninstitutionalized\nsurvivors, this restricted our model to a simple logistic\nregression model of \"community-based movers\" ver-\nsus \"nonmovers.\" Using the above notation, the prob-\nability of moving during the /th transition interval can\nbe written as\n. %\nexp(P'x/fc\n)\n* 1 + expip'xj\nHere, xjk\nalso contains terms representing functional\nstatus at both the beginning and end of each interval.\nTests for common transition interval effects were per-\nformed in the same manner as was used for Stage 1."
