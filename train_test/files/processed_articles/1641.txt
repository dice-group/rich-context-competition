Social characteristics are of spe-\ncial interest because they have the potential to readily identify\nthose at risk of obesity, some can be modified, and they may\noffer ways to target overweight individuals and assist them in\nweight management. Although many sociocultural aspects of\nobesity have been analyzed (1), one characteristic that has not\nbeen well examined is marital status.\nAmong studies that explicitly examine marital status and\nbody weight, cross-sectional investigations tend to find that\nmarried people are heavier (2,3), although this finding is not\nconsistent for all investigations and may vary for some marital\ncategories like widowhood (4) and be contingent upon other\ncharacteristics like gender (5,6). Longitudinal analyses tend to\nfind that marital entry is associated with weight gain and mari-\ntal exit is associated with weight loss (7\u00ad13), although these\npatterns also vary between studies and are sometimes condi-\ntional upon other variables like gender (14,15).\nThe mixed patterns of past studies suggest a need to fur-\nther examine how and under what conditions marriage and\nbody weight are related. Marriage may be associated with body\nweight in many ways, both through social selection of indi-\nviduals into and out of marital states because of their weight,\nand through social causation where particular marital states\ninfluence body weight (16). Body weight is influenced by inter-\nactions between dietary intake, physical activity, smoking, and\nother factors that are embedded within marital relationships.\nMarriage has been changing historically, with a retreat from\nthe institution of marriage evidenced by rising deferral of\nage at first marriages, increased cohabitation without marry-\ning, higher dissolution of marriage through separation and\ndivorce, and more frequent lifelong nonentry into marriage\n(17). These changing dynamics of marriage vary among differ-\nent subgroups in society.\nIn particular, the role of ethnicity in marriage\u00adweight rela-\ntionships deserves special attention because consistent differ-\nences occur between ethnic groups in marital patterns and\nprocesses (18) and body weight and the prevalence of obesity\n(19,20). Blacks in the United States appear to have retreated\nfrom marriage more than other ethnic groups (21,22). In con-\ntrast, Hispanics tend to exhibit higher desire to marry and\ngreater commitment to marriage, and therefore have retreated\nless from marriage (23,24). Ethnicity also is associated with\nbody weight, with white Americans tending to be thinner\nthan black Americans, and average body weights of Hispanic\nAmericans tending to be situated between those two ethnic\nGender also is strongly related to body weight (26), with body\nweight differently experienced by men and women (1). Weight\npatterns are conditional upon gender for some ethnic groups\n(27), particularly among black Americans where women tend\nIt is currently unclear how ethnic groups vary in mar-\nriage\u00adweight relationships for men and women.

Frongillo2\nMarried individuals tend to be heavier than those who are unmarried, particularly men, and individuals in different\nethnic categories vary in their involvement in marriage and in their body weights. We examined gender and ethnic\ndifferences in relationships between marital status and body weight using cross-sectional data from the 1999\u00ad2002\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 3,947 women and 4,019 men. The findings revealed\nthat compared to married men in the same ethnic category, white divorced men, black never-married men, and all\nHispanic men except for widows had lower odds of being overweight. Compared to married women in the same ethnic\ncategory, white women's weights did not significantly differ by marital status, black separated women had greater\nodds of being overweight, and Hispanic never-married women had lower odds of being overweight. Associations of\nmarriage with body weight appear to be at least partly contingent upon gender and ethnicity, which may reflect larger\nsocietal patterns of involvement in marriage, commitment to family, and body-weight norms and expectations.\n1Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA; 2Department of Health Promotion, Education, and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health,\nUniversity of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.

Two studies compared marriage\u00adweight\nrelationships for different ethnic groups, and found simi-\nlar patterns for blacks, Hispanics, and whites (12,13). These\nstudies, however, only examined young adults, used self-\nreported body weight, and did not consider widowhood as\na marital category.\nThis investigation examined gender and ethnic patterns in\nrelationships between six categories of marital status (includ-\ning cohabitation, separation, and widowhood) and body\nweight for adults of all ages. The analysis is further strength-\nened by the use of measured (rather than self-reported) height\nand weight, and by the use of dietary intake, physical activity,\nand cigarette smoking as potential mediating mechanisms in\nmarriage\u00adweight relationships.\nOverall, we hypothesize that married individuals will be at\ngreater risk for overweight than their unmarried counterparts.\nThe risk of overweight among never-married men and women,\nand those who exited a marriage through separation or divorce\nare expected to be equivalent. Widows, on the other hand,\nexperience a unique and often sudden marital exit and are\nexpected to have risk for overweight that mirrors their married\ncounterparts. In contrast to overweight, we hypothesize that\nthe more extreme body weight measure of obesity is unrelated\nto marital status.\nWe further expect that overall marriage\u00adweight relation-\nships are contingent upon ethnicity and gender. Among\nwhite men and black men, the overall patterns are expected\nto hold. Among Hispanic men, who have high commitment\nto marriage and value marital longevity, risk of overweight\nand obesity is expected to be higher among the married men\nand widowers than in all other marital categories. Among\nwhite women, who tend to be more concerned with thinness\nthan either men or women of other ethnicities, the risk for\noverweight is expected to be greater among married women\nthan among never \nmarried and divorced women who may be\nactively seeking marital partners. Among black women, who\nexperience greater cultural acceptance of varying body images,\nrisk of overweight and obesity is expected to be independent of\nmarital status. Patterns among Hispanic women are expected\nto mirror those of Hispanic men.\nMethods And Procedures\nData, design, and sample\nData were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES), which collected questionnaire and medical exami-\nnation data from noninstitutionalized civilian residents of the United\nUniversity Institutional Review Board. The design was cross-sectional,\nwith each of the four annual survey years pooled into one analyti-\ncal data set to obtain sufficient numbers of individuals for subgroup\nanalysis (29). In all, 22% of sampled individuals were excluded because\nthey did not complete the medical exam (n = 820), were women who\nwere pregnant or for whom pregnancy was uncertain (n = 582), had\nunknown marital status (n = 441), did not have reported dietary data\n(n = 418), or had no measured or reported height and weight (n = 19).\nNHANES used a complex multistage probability sampling procedure.\nVariance corrections for the complex sample design were performed\nusing masked strata and pseudo primary sampling units provided by\nThe National Center for Health Statistics with the SPSS Complex Samples\nmodule. Data were weighted using National Center for Health Statistics\nsample weights calculated to adjust for over-sampling of low income,\nAfrican American, and Mexican American individuals, and those over\nMeasures\nMarital status was treated as the independent variable and was cat-\negorized as never married, cohabiting, married, separated, divorced,\nor widowed. Body weight was treated as the dependent variable, and\nwas measured by trained personnel using regularly calibrated scales.\nHeight was also measured, and used with weight to calculate a BMI of\nkg/m2 to indicate stored body fat levels beyond the weight of lean skel-\netal, muscle, or organ tissues (30). Measured weights and heights were\nhighly correlated with self-reported weights (r = 0.97) and heights\n(r = 0.93) in this NHANES data, so self-reported measures were used\nfor 335 individuals for whom measured weight or height was not\navailable. BMI subsequently was categorized to produce indicators of\nbeing overweight (BMI >25) or obese (BMI >30) (see ref. 31).\nGender was a stratifying variable for all analyses because of the differ-\nent ways that men and women experience and are affected by marriage\n(32) and the different ways each gender perceives body weight (26). There\nEthnicity was used as a stratifying variable for some analyses to com-\npare the marriage\u00adweight relationship within and between three major\nUnited States ethnic groups. Ethnicity was self-reported by the partici-\npants in separate questions about ethnicity and race that were used by\nThe National Center for Health Statistics to establish four categories to\nconduct ethnic comparisons: white nonHispanic, black \nnonHispanic,\nMexican American, and other Hispanic. We combined Mexican\n\nAmericans and other Hispanics into one Hispanic group to provide\nsufficient sample sizes for adequate comparisons. There were insuffi-\ncient numbers of study participants in other ethnic groups available to\npermit explicit stratification by additional ethnic categories. Respond-\nents reporting multiple or mixed ethnicities were coded with the \"other\"\ncategory and excluded from ethnic subgroup analyses to create a clear\ncomparison of white, black, and Hispanic ethnic categories.\nSociodemographic control variables included four characteristics\nof individuals that may confound the marriage\u00adweight relationship.\nAge is directly related with body weight (1) and was self-reported in\nyears, with individuals older than age 85 coded as 85. Age squared\nwas also included in multiple regression models to adjust for possible\ncurvilinear relationships as height and weight decline slightly among\nolder adults (4). Socioeconomic status is inversely associated with\nbody weight, particularly among women (1). Education was reported\nin the three categories of less than high school, high school graduate\nor equivalent certification, and more than high school. Family income\nBiological childbearing is associated with higher body weights among\nwomen (33) and a fertility variable was constructed for female respond-\nents. Women reporting one or more live births were considered child-\nbearers, whereas those reporting not yet menstruating, never having\nbeen pregnant, or never having a live birth were considered not to be\nchildbearers, although information for this variable was missing for 225\nwomen (6%). Adequate correlates were not available for imputing miss-\ning values for childbearing, and inclusion of this variable made no sub-\nstantial difference in multivariate models, so therefore childbearing was\nnot included in the final analyses.\nBehavioral control variables included three key types of potential\nmediators for the marriage\u00adweight relationship. Dietary intake was\nassessed using a 24-h recall procedure (30). From this assessment,\nenergy intake from foods consumed was calculated. Three dietary vari-\nables were analyzed here: (i) total daily energy intake, (ii) percentage\narticles\n \nof energy from carbohydrates, and (iii) percentage of energy from fat.\nPhysical activity represents energy output and was assessed as (i) a\nusual physical activity rating in four categories from 1.4 to 1.8 metabolic\nequivalents (34), (ii) a 30 day recall of leisure-time physical activity we\ncoded as either no leisure physical activity or some leisure physical\nactivity, and (iii) daily hours of nonwork time reported as spent view-\ning television or videos or at a computer screen, that we coded from 0\nto 5 or more. Additionally, smoking was self-reported and participants\nwere coded as smokers if they smoked one or more days during the\nMissing values were imputed for income (10% missing), education\n(0.1%), physical activity (0.1%), television/computer use (0.1%), and\nsmoking (0.1%) using an expectation-maximization procedure per-\nformed separately for men and women (35).\nData analyses\nAll analyses were stratified by gender, and some analyses were\nstratified by ethnic group. First, descriptive information about\nall variables was examined, with 2 and ANOVA tests performed\nto identify statistically significant differences across marital cat-\negories. Second, bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to\nexamine the relationship between marital status and body weight\nnot adjusted for confounding or mediating variables. Third, mul-\ntivariate logistic regressions were performed to control for blocks\nof confounding and then mediating variables in the total sample.\nFourth, multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for other\ndemographics were performed for whites, blacks and Hispanic\nrespondents separately. Fifth, multivariate logistic regression\n\nmodels which also included interactions between ethnic group and\nmarital status were examined for the three ethnic groups combined.\nEach marital category was compared to married individuals as a\nreference group, and for interaction effects married whites were the\nreference group.\nResults\nDescriptive analyses for men and women showed that the\nweighted data were similar to national patterns of adults,\nwith respondents being mostly white, married, middle-\naged, high-school educated, moderate income individuals\n(Table 1). Weight-category data revealed that the majority of\nrespondents were overweight. Their mean reported energy\nintake was approximately equivalent to national averages,\nwith approximately half of energy intake from carbohydrates\nand a third from fat. Most individuals in the sample were\nsomewhat active, engaged in leisure time physical activity,\nwatched television several hours per day, and did not smoke.\nNearly every measured demographic and health behavior\n\ndiffered significantly across marital categories for both men\nand women. Among married respondents, there were few\nblacks (6% of men and women) mirroring the national retreat\nfrom marriage among blacks, whereas blacks were most\nprevalent in the separated marital category. The economic\nadvantages of married individuals were apparent, with more\neducation (55% of married men and 30% of married women\nhad more than a high school education) and higher family\nincomes (29% of married men and 30% of married women\nNever-married men and women had notably different health\nbehaviors than individuals in other marital categories. They\nconsumed the most energy (almost 2,750 kcal for men and\nried men and 66% of never-married women engaged in some\nform of leisure time physical activity. Never-married men also\nhad the most screen time (2.7h on average). Among women,\n\nwidows had the most screen time (2.9h on average).\nBody weight also differed across marital categories, with\nmarried men being the most likely to be overweight (74%) or\nobese (30%). Among women, the separated marital category\nwas most likely to be overweight (75%) or obese (43%).\nMultivariate analyses of overweight and obesity by marital\ncategories, adjusting for demographic characteristics revealed\ndifferentpatternsformenandwomen(Table2).Nevermarried,\nseparated, and divorced men had significantly lower odds of\nbeing overweight than men who were married. Only divorced\nmen had significantly lower odds of being obese compared to\nmarried men. Controlling for diet, physical activity, and smok-\ning behaviors did not change this pattern of relationships.\nAmong women, there were no significant relationships\nbetween marital status and overweight after adjusting for\ndemographic characteristics. Including health behaviors did\nnot alter this result. Obesity among women did vary by marital\ncategory, with cohabiting and divorced women less likely to be\nobese than married women only when demographic charac-\nteristics were included in the regression model. The addition\nof health behaviors to this regression model attenuated these\nsignificant results, and marital category was no longer associ-\nated with obesity. Overall, this table suggests that mediating\nbehaviors explained little of marriage\u00adweight relationships\namong men and women and further regression models here\ninclude only adjustment for the demographic characteristics\nof respondents.\nEthnic differences in body weights differed by gender. For\nmen, body weight did not differ significantly by ethnic group,\neven after controlling for other demographic characteristics\n(data not shown). Among women, however, large differences\nwere observed across ethnic groups. After controlling for other\ndemographic characteristics, black women had approximately\ntwice the odds of being overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 2.26,\nwomen. Hispanic women also had greater odds of being over-\nno significant difference in obesity.\nDistinct relationships existed between marital status and both\noverweight and obesity within ethnic groups (Table 3). White\nmen who were divorced had about half the odds of being over-\nweight or obese as married white men. Black men who were\nnever married had about half the odds of being overweight as\nmarried black men, but no significant differences in obesity by\nmarital status existed for black men. Hispanic men who were\nnever married, cohabiting, separated, or divorced all had lower\nodds of being overweight than married Hispanic men. For\nobesity among Hispanic men, divorced and widowed individu-\nals were significantly less likely to be obese than married men.\nAmong white women there were no significant marital\n\nstatus differences for overweight, and the only significant\ndifference for obesity was that white women living with a\npartner had about half the odds of obesity as did married\nwhite women. For black women, the only significant marital\narticles\n \nTable 1Sample characteristics by marital status\nMen Women\nTotal\nsample\nNever\nmarried\nLiving with\npartner Married Separated Divorced Widowed\nTotal\nsample\nNever\nmarried\nLiving with\nPartner Married Separated Divorced Widowed\nDemographics\n Race/ethnicity (%)\n Education (%)\n High school\n diploma\u00adGED\n Annual CPS family income (%)\nTable 1 Continued on next page\narticles\n \nTable 1 (Continued)\nMen Women\nTotal\nsample\nNever\nmarried\nLiving with\npartner Married Separated Divorced Widowed\nTotal\nsample\nNever\nmarried\nLiving with\nPartner Married Separated Divorced Widowed\nHealth behaviors\n Mean energy\n intake (s.e.)\n Mean % of energy\n from carbohydrates\n (s.e.)\n Mean % of energy\n from fat (s.e.)\n Average level of physical activity each day (%)\n Sits during day &\n does not walk\n Stands-walks a\n lot, but not\n carry-lift things\n Lifts light loads/\n climbs stairs or\n hills very often\n Heavy work/\n carries heavy\n Any leisure time\n physical activity (%)\n Mean hours of TV &\n computer in a typical\n daily (s.e.)\nBody weight\nDifferences in means or percentages across marital categories were tested using ANOVA and 2-analysis, with statistical significance denoted: *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.\narticles\n \nstatus difference was that separated black women had over\ntwice the odds of being overweight as married black women.\nNever-married Hispanic women had lower odds of being\noverweight than married Hispanic women, and divorced\nHispanic women had significantly lower odds of being obese\nthan married Hispanic women.\nMultivariate regressions for the three ethnic groups com-\nbined, including interactions between marital status and eth-\nnicity, revealed significant differences between the patterns of\nmarriage\u00adbody weight relationships for each ethnicity.

This study found that\nmarital status was related to weight and that relationship dif-\nfered by gender and ethnicity. These findings for men support\nthe overall hypothesis that married people are heavier, which is\ncongruent with prior studies about marriage and weight (2,3).\nAmong women, however, no overall difference existed by mar-\nital status after controlling for other variables.\nThese analyses further reveal a diversity of relationships\nbetween marriage and weight when ethnicity is considered.\nAmong whites, divorced men have lower odds of being over-\nweight or obese than married men. In contrast, white women's\nweights did not differ by marital status, which is consistent with\nthe tendency for weight norms to apply to all women (22).\nOverall, black women had higher prevalence of overweight\nthan white women. Black women tend to have more accepting\nbody image and are not as invested in thinness as white women\n(36). Among black women, however, it is notable that sepa-\nrated women were more than twice as likely to be overweight\nthan those who were married.

Among white married women, 58% are over-\nweight and 32% are obese. Among black married women, 79% are overweight and 49% are obese. Among hispanic married women, 74% are overweight and 39% are\nobese. Regression models for each ethnic subgroup include marital status, ethnicity, age, age squared, education, and income. The statistical significance of interactions\nbetween marital status and ethnicity were tested with the full sample including all the variables listed above plus indicators for black and Hispanic and their interactions\nwith marital status.\n*Significantly different from Married within ethnic subgroup: *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Significant interaction between ethnicity and marital category: P < 0.10 and\nand economic hardship are particularly problematic for black\nwomen (18) and may contribute to this higher prevalence of\noverweight. Separated black women withdrawing from mar-\nriage may not seek thinness because they are not interested in\npursuing other relationships, they face a discouraging mar-\nriage market (37), or because cultural expectations of poten-\ntial marriage partners do not include thinness. If this was\nthe case, however, we would expect all categories of unmar-\nried black women to have similarly higher body weight than\nmarried black women and this is not what was observed in\nthese data. The economic hardship of being a separated black\nwoman may be a more relevant explanation of the higher body\nweights observed here. Other research has noted that resource\ndifferences do not explain away weight differences (38), and\nwe controlled for two indicators of socioeconomic status in\nthis analysis. Food insecurity, however, has been shown to be\nrelated to disordered eating and to overweight among women\n(39,40). Food insecurity can lead women to have restricted\nintake when food is scarce and then to overeat when food is\nmore plentiful, resulting in weight gain.\nNever-married Hispanic and black men were lighter than\ntheir married ethnic counterparts, even after controlling for all\nother demographic characteristics. This pattern of results was\nsignificantly different among whites where the never married\nand married were equally likely to be overweight or obese. This\nsuggests that the striking differences among Hispanic and black\nrespondents may drive the overall theme in the literature that\nmarried men are heavier than their unmarried counterparts.\nIt is notable that married Hispanic men had considerably\nhigher odds of being overweight than all other Hispanic mari-\ntal categories, except widows. Hispanic men tend to exhibit\ngreater desire to marry, more marital involvement, and greater\ncommitment to family than other ethnic groups (23,24).\nMarried Hispanic men may engage in more regular and more\nextensive family eating and sedentary family activities than\ntheir unmarried counterparts. Married Hispanic men may eat\ngreater amounts of food more regularly in family meals and\nforego individualistic or away-from-home recreational physi-\ncal activity (41). Hispanic widowers may continue to eat in this\nfamilial context, given the nature of their marital exit.\nThese results show the relevance of considering the complex-\nity of interacting and contingent relationships between gender,\nethnicity, marriage, and body weight. Ethnic cultural differ-\nences may be involved at many levels. Ethnic and marital dif-\nferences in body image may underlie some of these observed\nrelationships, particularly among women who tend to be more\nconcerned about body image than are men (42). For example,\nwhites and never-married individuals have greater concerns\nand more stringent standards about body weight than those\nwith other ethnic and marital identities (43).\nIncluding mediating measures of diet, activity, and smok-\ning produced few additional changes in marriage\u00adweight\narticles\n \nrelationships beyond adjusting for socio-demographics. This\ndoes not mean that energy intake, physical activity, and smok-\ning are not involved in the establishment and regulation of\nbody weight, but rather that their influence is independent of\nthe relationships that we observed between marriage and body\nweight. Furthermore, these physiological mechanisms may not\nhave been adequately assessed by the NHANES survey. Diet\nand activity data in epidemiological analysis are often incom-\nplete and prone to measurement error (34). Duration and\namount of smoking differs between gender and ethnic groups\n(44), and the multifaceted aspects of tobacco use are difficult to\nfully examine. Adequate modeling of the roles of health behav-\niors in marriage\u00adweight relationships may require data with\nadditional measures and greater depth of assessment in larger\nsamples with greater numbers of people in all ethnic groups.\nSeverallimitationsofthisstudydeservenote.First,Although\nthe sample is broadly representative of the United States\npopulation, it omits institutionalized individuals, those who\nrefused to participate, and excluded cases due to missing data,\nwhich may vary across ethnic groups and influence observed\nmarital differences. The sample included thousands of indi-\nviduals, but some marital-ethnic subgroups had relatively few\ncases, which limited our analysis of ethnicity to white, black\nand Hispanic respondents.\nSecond, the design was cross-sectional, which did not per-\nmit clear consideration of the extent to which marital status\ninfluenced weight, weight influenced marital status, or both.\nWhereas NHANES is unique among large public data sets in\nincluding dietary data, cross-sectional assessment of diet at\none point in time does not necessarily relate to body weight\nlevels that may have been established through long-term die-\ntary, activity, and smoking patterns.\nThird, there were measurement limitations in the data.\nAlthough our analysis controlled for several key demographic\nvariables, the observed relationships may be influenced by\nor contingent upon other variables that were not available in\nNHANES like neighborhood environments or family meal\npatterns. BMI, even when calculated from measured height\nand weight, is an imperfect measure of body fat stores and its\naccuracy may vary between ethnic groups (45). Also, multiple\nmarriages and duration of partnerships may offer additional\ninsights beyond current marital status, but were not available\nin the NHANES survey.\nThese findings show that overweight was more prevalent\namong married Hispanic men compared to other Hispanic\nmen, and among separated black women compared to other\nblack women. Programs to manage body weight may benefit\nfrom tailoring interventions to specific gender-ethnic-marital\nsubgroups. For example, interventions designed to serve mar-\nried Hispanic men might capitalize on their commitment to\nmarriage and family and include premarital diet and weight\neducation, emphasize controlled food portions at family meals,\nor use a couples weight management model. Additionally,\ninterventions for separated black women might focus on main-\ntaining regular eating patterns, identifying sources of social\nsupport after separation, and seeking opportunities to be more\nactive in everyday tasks. To effectively address high prevalence\nof overweight among separated black women, however, may\nrequire improved economic conditions or better food security,\nwhich would require broader economic or policy shifts rather\nthan interventions with individuals.\n"
