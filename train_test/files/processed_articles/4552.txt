The RAS contributes to\nelectrolyte homeostasis and to the regulation of blood pres-\nsure in vivo.3 Dysregulation of this system can contribute to\nthe development of essential hypertension. Furthermore,\nangiotensin II is a potent pro-inflammatory modulator that\naugments the immune response.4\u00ad7 Elevated serum ACE\nlevels have been observed in patients with active sarcoido-\nsis.8 Since serumACE levels may reflect the mass of granu-\nloma in the body and are a consequence of the activation of\nthe monocyte-macrophage-epitheloid cell system, they are\nconsidered to be an activity marker of the disease.9 Thus,\nACE is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of\nsarcoidosis.\nThe ACE gene, located on chromosome 17q23, contains\nan insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism within intron 16\nThe DD genotype is associated with an approximately two-\nfold higher tissue11,12 and plasma concentration of ACE\nthan the II genotype.10 Thus, the D allele could play a role\nin the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism has been studied in the con-\ntext of sarcoidosis. However, published results on the\nAssociations between the angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme insertion/deletion\npolymorphism and susceptibility to\nsarcoidosis: A meta-analysis\nGwan Gyu Song, Jae-Hoon Kim and Young Ho Lee\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, meta-analysis, polymorphism, sarcoidosis\nDivision of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea\nUniversity College of Medicine, Korea\nCorresponding author:\nYoung Ho Lee, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal\nMedicine, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of\nEmail: lyhcgh@korea.ac.kr\nOriginal Article\n220 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\ngenetic associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism are con-\ntroversial and inconclusive.13\u00ad27 This may be because of\nsmall sample sizes, low statistical power, and/or clinical\nheterogeneity. In order to overcome the limitations of indi-\nvidual studies, resolve inconsistencies, and reduce the like-\nlihood that random errors are responsible for false-positive\nor false-negative associations, we employed a meta-analy-\nsis to further characterize the association and to investigate\nwhether the ACE I/D polymorphism contributes to suscep-\ntibility to sarcoidosis.\nMaterials and methods\nIdentification of eligible studies and data\nextraction\nA search of the literature for studies that examined the asso-\nciation between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoido-\nsis was conducted. We utilized the MEDLINE and\nEMBASE citation indices to identify articles published\nuntil December 2012 in which the ACE I/D polymorphism\nwas identified in sarcoidosis patients and controls. In addi-\ntion, all references mentioned in the identified articles were\nreviewed to identify studies not indexed by MEDLINE and\nEMBASE. The following keywords and subject terms were\nused in the search: \"angiotensin-converting enzyme,\"\n\"ACE,\" and \"sarcoidosis.\" Studies were included in the\nanalysis if: (1) they were case-control studies, (2) contained\noriginal data, and (3) included sufficient data to calculate\nodds ratios (ORs). No language restriction was applied. We\nexcluded the following: (1) studies including overlapping\ndata; (2) studies in which the number of null and wild geno-\ntypes or alleles could not be ascertained; (3) studies in\nwhich family members were studied because their analysis\nwas based on linkage considerations; and (4) studies in\nwhich the genotype distribution in controls was not consist-\nent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), because\ndeviation from the HWE among controls suggests the pos-\nsibility of bias during control selection or genotyping\nerrors. The following information was extracted from each\nidentified study: author, year of publication, ethnicity of the\nstudy population, demographics, numbers of cases and con-\ntrols, the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles of the\nACE I/D polymorphism, and type of sarcoidosis.\nEvaluation of publication bias and study\nquality\nThe chi square test was used to determine if the observed\ngenotype frequencies in controls conformed to Hardy-\nWeinberg (H-W) expectations. Funnel plots are often used\nto detect publication bias, but they require a range of stud-\nies of varying sizes and subjective judgments; therefore, we\nevaluated publication bias using Egger's linear regression\ntest.28 Egger's linear regression test measures funnel plot\nasymmetry on a natural logarithmic scale of ORs.\nEvaluation of statistical associations\nWe performed meta-analyses using (1) allelic contrast (D\nvs. I); (2) recessive (DD vs. ID + II); (3) dominant (DD +\nID vs. II); and (4) codominant (DD vs. ID vs. II) models.\nPoint estimates of risks, ORs, and 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) were calculated for each study. In addition, within-\nand between-study variations and heterogeneities were\nassessed using Cochran's Q-statistic. Cochran's Q-statistic\ntest assesses the null hypothesis that all studies evaluated\nthe same effect. The effect of heterogeneity was quantified\nusing I2 with a range between 0% and 100%, representing\nthe proportion of between-study variability attributable to\nheterogeneity rather than to chance.29 I2 values of 25%,\n50%, and 75% were nominally assigned as low, moderate,\nand high estimates. The fixed-effects model assumes that a\ngenetic factor has a similar effect on disease susceptibility\nacross all studies investigated and that observed variations\namong studies are caused by chance alone.30 The random-\neffects model assumes that different studies show substan-\ntial diversity and assesses both within-study sampling error\nand between-study variance.31 When study groups are\nhomogeneous, the two models are similar. If the study\ngroups lack homogeneity, the random-effects model usu-\nally provides wider CIs than the fixed-effects model. The\nrandom-effects model is most appropriate in the presence\nof significant between-study heterogeneity.31 Statistical\nmanipulations were undertaken using the Comprehensive\nMeta-Analysis computer program (Biosta, Englewood, NJ,\nUSA). The power of each study was computed as the prob-\nability of detecting an association between the ACE poly-\nmorphism and sarcoidosis using a significance level of 0.05\nand assuming an OR of 1.5 (small effect size). Power anal-\nysis was performed using the statistical program G*Power\n(http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/\ngpower).\nResults\nStudies included in the meta-analysis\nFifty-two studies were identified by electronic and manual\nsearches, 18 of which were selected for full-text review\nexcluded because it contained a polymorphism different\nfrom the ACE I/D polymorphism.33 Thus, a total of 17 stud-\ncontained data on two different sarcoidosis groups,19,22 and\nthese were treated independently. Thus, a total of 19 sepa-\nrate comparisons met our inclusion criteria. However, two\nof the 19 separate comparisons were excluded because they\nhad a genotype distribution in controls that was not in\nstudies met our inclusion criteria. These studies consisted\nof 12 European, three East Asian, one West Asian, and one\nin total. Selected details of the individual studies are sum-\nmarized in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Evidence of publi-\ncation bias was not found in a meta-analyses of the ACE\nI/D polymorphism in all AA (Egger's regression test p val-\nDiscussion\nACE is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the\nkidneys, heart, lungs, vascular endothelium, skin, joints,\nand testes.11,12 ACE plays an important role in RAS, angio-\ntensin II conversion, directly increases vascular smooth\nmuscle cell contraction, and affects smooth muscle prolif-\neration, monocyte adhesion, platelet adhesion, and aggre-\ngation.3,4 The ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for 47% of\nthe variation in ACE plasma activity,10 therefore the source\nof the majority of the variation still remains to be discov-\nered. Measuring plasmatic ACE activity provides a good\nindicator of activity of sarcoidosis and treatment success,\nbut the genetic component (I/D polymorphism) studied\nhere does not account for the majority of that variation,\ntherefore a linear association cannot and must not be\nassumed. This polymorphism has been studied in connec-\ntion with several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease,34\nmyocardial infarction,35 cerebral infarction,36 hyperten-\nsion,37 and vasculitis.38 These studies reported associations\nbetween susceptibilities to these diseases and the DD geno-\ntype and D allele.34\u00ad38 Considering the high serum ACE\nlevels observed in sarcoidosis and the role of ACE as a bio-\nchemical marker of sarcoidosis, ACE may be a candidate\ngene for sarcoidosis.9\nIn this meta-analysis, we combined evidence on the\nassociations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sus-\nceptibility to sarcoidosis. Meta-analysis of the DD+ID gen-\notype (dominant model) and ID vs. II genotype (codominant\nTable 2.

Furthermore, meta-analysis stratified by\nethnicity indicated an association between the DD geno-\ntype (recessive model) and DD vs. ID genotype (codomi-\nnant model) of the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis\nin Europeans. The difference in genetic models for an asso-\nciation of the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis\nbetween Europeans and East Asians may be explained\npartly by the ethnic difference of the D allele frequency.\nEuropean populations demonstrated a higher frequency of\nTable 3.

An antigen-driven process\nmay result in an exaggerated Th1-type immunological\nresponse in genetically susceptible people in sarcoidosis.2\nEpithelioid cells in granulomas are the main source of\nACE. The serum ACE level is increased in active sarcoido-\nsis, and is a marker for monitoring sarcoidosis activity.8\nACE is expressed in T cells and activates macrophages and\naugments CD4+ T-cell infiltration. Angiotensin II, which\nis produced by conversion from angiotensin I by ACE,\nmodifies the inflammatory response. Moreover, in view of\nthe fact that the ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for\napproximately one-half of the variance in ACE plasma lev-\nels,10 it is likely that the ACE I/D polymorphism plays a\nrole in susceptibility to sarcoidosis.\nThe results of this meta-analysis differ from those of a\nprevious meta-analysis on the relationship between the\nACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis risk performed by\nMedica et al.39 The present study included four more stud-\n345 more controls, than the Medica et al. study, and only\nstudies consistent with HWE were included. In addition, an\nethnicity-specific meta-analysis was conducted for\nEuropeans and East Asians. This meta-analysis revealed an\nassociation between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sar-\ncoidosis risk in European and East Asian populations, in\ncontrast with the results of the previous study.\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism may influence the antihy-\npertensive response of ACE inhibitors (ACEI). The ACEI\nhas been known to be associated with better response for\nhypertension in the DD genotype compared with the II gen-\notype.40 Our meta-analysis confirmed the association\nbetween the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis. Thus\nthere is a possibility that the ACEI use is associated with\nbetter clinical improvement of sarcoidosis in patients carry-\ning the DD genotype in comparison with the II genotype.\nFurther evaluation is needed to clarify the relation between\nthe ACE I/D polymorphism and response to ACEI therapy\nin patients with sarcoidosis.\nThe present study has some limitations that should be\nconsidered. First, heterogeneity and confounding factors\nmay have distorted the analysis. Second, other ACE poly-\nmorphisms capable of affecting ACE activity could also be\nassociated with sarcoidosis. However, the limited amount\nof data available prevented further meta-analysis. Third,\nthere are varying levels of disease severity, and the activity\nlevel of sarcoidosis was unclear. Further research is required\nto examine whether an association exists between the ACE\nI/D polymorphism and the activity or clinical features of\nthe disease. Fourth, we included data from European, East\nAsian, Indian, and Turkish patients in our meta-analysis,\nbut our ethnicity-associated results are applicable only to\nEuropean and East Asian ethnic groups.\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis of the ACE I/D poly-\nmorphism, which was based on a total sample of 1556\npatients and 2381 controls, demonstrated that the ACE I/D\npolymorphism is associated with susceptibility to sar-\ncoidosis in Europeans and East Asians. Accordingly, our\nfindings support the notion that the ACE I/D polymor-\nphism plays a role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.\nLarger-scale studies in populations with different ethnici-\nties are needed to explore the relationships between the\npolymorphisms of the ACE gene and the pathogenesis of\nsarcoidosis.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any fund-\ning agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit\nsectors.\nReferences\n1.
