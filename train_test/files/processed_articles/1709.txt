Among adults (aged >20 years of\nage) who were not problem drinkers, we examined hepatitis B and C antibodies and the liver enzymes\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamyl transaminase (GGT)\nwith impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes (unweighted, n  5234; weighted, n \n172,626,805). Logistic regression models were computed controlling for major risk factors that drive\ndiabetes screening, including age, gender, race, diagnosed hypertension, diagnosed hypercholesterol-\nemia, and obesity.\nResults: In unadjusted analyses 51% of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes have elevated GGT\nversus 20% of individuals without diabetes or impaired fasting glucose (P  .01). Similarly, 43% of\nindividuals with undiagnosed diabetes have elevated ALT versus 23% of individuals without diabetes or\nimpaired fasting glucose (P  .01).

Thus, the\npurpose of this study was to examine the relation-\nship of hepatitis antibodies and liver enzymes with\nimpaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes.\nWe hypothesized that elevated liver enzymes will\nbe associated with the presence of impaired fasting\nglucose and undiagnosed diabetes.\nMethods\nThe data for this study were derived from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nsentative sample of the noninstitutionalized US\npopulation. The NHANES design includes an\noversampling of minorities and an ability to make\npopulation estimates. More information on the\ncluding laboratory assessment, can be found at the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)\nwebsite.20 This study included fasting participants\n20 years old who were not problem drinkers of\nalcohol. Problem drinking was defined as 14\ndrinks per week for men or 7 drinks per week for\nwomen. We excluded binge drinkers, defined as 5\ndrinks during 1 day per week.21\nVariables\nDiabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose\nDiagnosed diabetes was defined as self-report of a\ndoctor's diagnosis of diabetes. Undiagnosed diabe-\ntes was defined as patients reporting that they had\nnot been diagnosed by a doctor with diabetes but\nwho had fasting plasma glucose of 126 mg/dL.\nImpaired fasting glucose was defined as patients not\ndiagnosed with diabetes who had fasting plasma\nwith diabetes who had fasting plasma glucose 100\nmg/dL were classified as normal.16\nHepatitis Antibodies and Liver Function\nHepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis C antibody\n(confirmed) were classified as positive or negative.\nThe Ortho HBc Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent\nAssay (ELISA) Test System is a qualitative ELISA\nfor the detection of total antibody to anti-HBc in\nhuman serum or plasma. The Chiron RIBA 3.0\nStrip Immunoblot Assay (SIA; Chiron Corpora-\ntion, Inc., Emeryville, CA) is an in vitro qualitative\nenzyme immunoassay for the detection of antibody\nto hepatitis C virus in human serum or plasma. The\nSIA was used to confirm hepatitis C identified us-\ning an anti-hepatitis C virus screening ELISA.\nCRP was classified as low (0.3 mg/dL) or elevated\n(0.3 mg/dL).22 After previous research relating\nliver enzymes to the development of diabetes, liver\nenzymes were classified as low (below the fourth\nquartile) or high (fourth quartile). ALT 27.78\nu/L was classified as elevated; AST 25.51 u/L was\nclassified as elevated; and GGT 29.48 u/L was\nclassified as elevated.4\u00ad6 We also evaluated patients\nbased on their answers to the questions, Has a\ndoctor or health professional ever told you that you\nhave a liver condition? and Do you still have a liver\ncondition?\nControl Variables\nIn addition to age and gender, the control variable\nof self-reported race/ethnicity was created out of a\nquestion about the person's race and an additional\nquestion about Hispanic ethnicity. Race/ethnicity\nwas classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, and other. Body mass index was\ncalculated as kg/m2 from height and weight mea-\nsured during the NHANES physical examination\nand was analyzed as a continuous variable. Because\nhypercholesterolemia and hypertension are risk\nfactors that drive screening for diabetes we felt that\nit was important to control for previously diag-\nnosed hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.\nPrevious diagnosis would allow health care provid-\ners to be aware of the condition. High cholesterol\nwas defined as the self-report of a doctor having\ntold the participant he or she had high cholesterol.\nThose who had not been tested were considered to\nhave not been diagnosed with high cholesterol.\nHypertension was defined as the self-report of a\ndoctor ever having told the participant he or she\nhad high blood pressure or hypertension.\nAnalysis\nBecause this survey is based on a complex sampling\ndesign that makes it representative of the noninsti-\ntutionalized US population, we are able to make\nnationally representative estimates. We used\nSUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) to account for the\nweighting and complex sampling design.\nWe evaluated bivariate relationships between\nhepatitis antibodies, CRP, and liver enzymes with\ndiagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, impaired\nfasting glucose, and normal participants using 2\nanalysis. Because biomarkers may be affected by\ntreatment regimens once an individual has been\ndiagnosed with diabetes, we conducted additional\nanalyses focusing on individuals with undiagnosed\ndisease. We conducted adjusted logistic regres-\nsions, excluding patients with diagnosed diabetes\nand predicting undiagnosed impaired fasting glu-\ncose and undiagnosed diabetes alone. Control vari-\nables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, body\nmass index, previous diagnosis of hypercholesterol-\nemia, and previous diagnosis of hypertension.\nFinally, we examined whether the association\nbetween liver enzymes and impaired fasting glucose\nor undiagnosed diabetes was affected by elevated\nCRP. We created variables with 4 categories: 1)\nelevated liver enzyme, elevated CRP; 2) low liver\nenzyme, elevated CRP; 3) elevated liver enzyme,\nlow CRP; and 4) low liver enzyme, low CRP. The\ncombination of GGT, AST, and ATL with CRP\nwere used in 3 separate logistic regressions to pre-\ndict undiagnosed diabetes or impaired fasting glu-\ncose, adjusted for the previously identified control\nvariables. In the analyses of this study we assumed\na level of P  .05 to represent statistical signifi-\ncance.\nTable 1.

Elevated GGT and ALT, but not AST, are\nassociated with undiagnosed diabetes as well as im-\npaired fasting glucose. People who report currently\nhaving a doctor-diagnosed liver condition were not\nassociated with undiagnosed diabetes (odds ratio,\nTable 4 presents the results of the adjusted lo-\ngistic regressions that include liver enzymes com-\nbined with CRP. As with the single variable anal-\nyses, in the combined variable analysis there is no\nrelationship between undiagnosed diabetes and\nAST. Neither ALT nor GGT seems to indicate an\ninteraction between liver enzymes and CRP and\nthe likelihood of having undiagnosed diabetes. The\nresults for impaired fasting glucose did seem to\nsuggest that having elevated GGT and elevated\nCRP increased the likelihood of having impaired\nfasting glucose.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study add to our knowledge of\ncurrent markers that are associated with the pres-\nence of undetected diabetes. Hepatitis B was asso-\nciated with diabetes in unadjusted analyses, but\nwhen other risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes\nwere accounted for this marker was no longer sig-\nnificant. However, both elevated ALT and GGT\nwere independently associated with a significantly\ngreater likelihood of having undiagnosed diabetes\nand impaired fasting glucose. Previous research has\nsuggested that elevated ALT and GGT are associ-\nated with the development of diabetes.4\u00ad8 This\nsuggests that not only is liver function associated\nwith the development of diabetes but it also seems\nto be a risk factor for currently having undiagnosed\ndiabetes.\nThe finding that AST was not significantly asso-\nciated may be because, although ALT is found pri-\nmarily in the liver, AST is found not only in the liver\nbut also in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys,\nbrain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes\n(in decreasing order of concentration). Thus, it may\nnot be as specific a marker of the liver injury that is\nassociated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose.\nOne implication of these findings for clinical\npractice is that undiagnosed diabetes should be\nconsidered as a possibility in instances of elevated\nALT or GGT. A finding of elevated liver enzymes\nmay act for clinicians as a cue to consider an inves-\ntigation of the possibility of undiagnosed diabetes\nor impaired fasting glucose, even in the absence of\nother common risk factors. These results suggest\nTable 4.

Several variables are based on\nself-reports by the patients (eg, previous diagnosis by\na doctor of diabetes, high cholesterol, or hyperten-\nsion). Although the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics has for many years uses a cognitive laboratory\nto evaluate and validate items regarding receipt of\nhealth services and health behaviors, there is a possi-\nbility of response bias in these questions.23\nThe results presented here suggest that elevated\nliver tests, especially of ALT and GGT, indicate\nthat clinicians might want to investigate whether or\nnot a patient has undiagnosed diabetes. Liver func-\ntion as a risk stratification variable for undetected\ndiabetes or impaired fasting glucose may be worth\nfurther investigation.\nReferences\n1. Bock G, Chittilapilly E, Basu R, et al.
