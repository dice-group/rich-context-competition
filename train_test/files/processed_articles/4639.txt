    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrograms that attempt to increase tolerance and openness to diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities through education\nand exposure are popular and often successful in higher education, but at times backfire, leading instead to an increase in\nprejudice. The present study considered several intrapersonal and developmental factors that may be important to consider.\nIdentity development (Measures of Psychosocial Development, based on Erikson's theory of psychosocial development),\nmoral reasoning (Defining Issues Test, based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development), and empathy (a subscale of the\nCalifornia Personality Inventory) were tested as predictors of openness to diversity (Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity\nScale) with entering first-year university students (n = 282) at a small, private comprehensive university. As hypothesized,\nidentity development, principled moral reasoning, and empathy each significantly and positively predicted openness to\ndiversity, and the combination of predictors accounted for a moderately large portion of the criterion's variance. Implications\nare discussed for developing effective programs to facilitate openness to diversity in emerging adulthood.\n",

Globally,\nalthough distances are ever-shrinking and differing cultures\nmust cooperate for survival, terrorist threats and genocidal\nwars are part of the daily news. Within the United States,\nalthough population projections suggest that racial and eth-\nnic minorities will comprise one third of all Americans by\nnic groups are responsible for many hate crimes (Wang et al.,\n2003). Numerous institutions, from governmental agencies\nto educational systems, have noted the need for increasing\ntolerance. Institutions of higher learning have, in particular,\ndeclared the importance of facilitating openness to diversity\namong students in preparing young adults to become respon-\nsible and successful citizens in today's multicultural and\nglobal society (Association of American Colleges and\nothers from diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities, both\nat home and abroad (Monroe & Martinez-Marti, 2008;\nNelson Laird, Engberg, & Hurtado, 2005).\nTolerance can be conceptualized in many ways, from\nmerely \"putting up with\" others who are different, to valuing\nand celebrating others' differences (Robinson, Witenberg, &\nSanson, 2001) and research ranges from a focus on reducing\nprejudice, to increasing comfort, kinship, and other positive\nfeelings toward diverse others (Pittinsky, 2009). Many uni-\nversity-wide diversity initiatives currently attempt to increase\ntolerance, variously defined, through exposure.

Positive consequences can include\nincreasing empathy, perspective-taking, tolerance, and the\ncelebration of various cultural traditions; but at times, preju-\ndice and discrimination increase instead. A report prepared\nby the State Higher Education Executive Officers (1987)\ncautioned that, while lack of cross-cultural contacts can be\ndetrimental, contacts can also be damaging if participants\nbegin the interactions with prejudice or ignorance. As noted\nby Taylor (1994), \"engendering tolerance is not simply a\nquestion of demographics--gathering a diverse group of\npeople together--but is dependent on the quality of that\nexperience\" (p. 32). Multicultural campus programs may\nincrease ethnic identity (Simmons, Wittig, & Grant, 2010)\nand, although feeling a strong connection to one's own group\ndoes not necessarily lead to a hatred of nonmembers (Brewer,\n1999), negative intergroup attitudes have been found at times\nto increase as a result (Verkuyten, 2008). Although there is\nconsiderable evidence that diversity initiatives can foster\ncultural knowledge and interracial understanding among col-\nlege students, some attempts at increasing openness to diver-\nsity solely through education and discourse can have\nunfavorable results (McCauley et al., 2000; Wood &\nA number of conditions have been posited by contact the-\nory (Allport, 1954) to be important for favorable conse-\nquences, including adequate opportunity for the members to\nget to know each other, similarity in status, a cooperative\nsituation, support by the institution and those in authority,\npositive relationships with peers from other groups may be\nrelevant in that they both build positive feelings and reduce\nuncertainty and anxiety about interacting with diverse others.\nThey may also promote perspective-taking and empathy.\nEven when the conditions noted are met, however, a meta-\nanalysis of studies on children and adolescents in school set-\ntings indicated that intergroup contact accounts for only a\nmedium-sized effect on negative ethnic attitudes (Tropp &\nPrenevost, 2008). In a review of the evidence for positive\nand negative consequences of interethnic contact in schools,\nThijs and Verkuyten (2013) called for a consideration of\nindividual characteristics and social and psychological pro-\ncesses as important predictors of tolerance.\nIn fact, research on a number of intrapersonal variables is\npertinent to understanding the development of tolerance. As\nargued by Witenberg (2007), tolerance may be best concep-\ntualized, not as the absence or control of prejudice, but as\nsomething related to morality, with concerns for justice,\nequality, and fairness. Examining the reasoning used by chil-\ndren and adolescents for their tolerant or intolerant attitudes\nin response to dilemmas portraying prejudicial behaviors,\nWitenberg found moral considerations of fairness as well as\nempathy for the plight of the target of prejudice to underlie\nmost participants' tolerant attitudes. She also found that an\nindividual's degree of tolerance and underlying reasoning\ntended to be cross-situational, wherein some individuals\nwere tolerant irrespective of the circumstances described,\nreflecting an enduring intrapersonal attribute. Furthermore,\ntolerance, morality, prosociality, and aspects of identity\ndevelopment may be linked in their shared quest for under-\nstanding what factors allow people to move away from pro-\ntecting only their self-interests and toward a perspective that\nmay include or benefit others or society. The extensive litera-\nture on prosocial behavior and morality also points to the\nRest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 2000) and affective\ndomains (Batson, Chang, Orr, & Rowland, 2002; de\nVignemont & Singer, 2006; Eisenberg, Shea, Carlo, &\nhave received attention as well (Blasi, 2005; Perugini &\nLeone, 2009), and many researchers have argued that a com-\nbination of factors must be considered (Frimer & Walker,\nThe process of teaching intercultural sensitivity to college\nstudents is a complex challenge, which some have also noted\nshould include a consideration of developmental issues\n(Mahoney & Schamber, 2004). For example, some social\njustice and diversity courses in college curricula require a\ncertain level of developmental maturity, including critical\nthinking and self-reflective abilities, openness to conflicting\nperspectives, and perspective-taking (Adams, 2002). King\nand Baxter Magolda (2005) have argued that intercultural\nmaturity in the college years should be understood as a\ndevelopmental process and research supports the importance\nof maturity in promoting openness among college students to\nexposure to diversity (Kubal, Stone, Meyler, & Mauney,\n2003). With emerging adulthood, comes the potential for a\nnumber of developmental strides, including new cognitive\nabilities (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958), corresponding advances\nin moral reasoning (Gibbs, Moshman, Berkowitz, Basinger,\ncess of facilitating positive growth in emerging adults is\ncomplex (Pike & Kuh, 2006); emerging adulthood, with its\nnew-found potentials for maturity, may be, in fact, a particu-\nlarly fruitful time to facilitate the acceptance of others.\nGerson and Neilson 3\nIn considering the potential roles of both cognitive and\naffective variables relevant to openness to others in emerging\nadulthood, two developmental theories are particularly perti-\nnent: Erikson's psychosocial theory of identity development\nand Kohlberg's theory of moral reasoning. Accordingly, the\npresent study focused on both identity development and the\ndevelopment of moral reasoning as understood by these the-\nories. The role of empathy, as possibly \"the most prototypi-\ncal moral emotion and . . . certainly the most widely\nthree factors were also selected to represent both cognitive\nand affective domains, so that we could test the relevance of\na variety of intrapersonal areas.\nIdentity Development\nIdentity has been considered from a number of perspectives\n(Craig-Bray, Adams, & Dobson, 1988; Hill, Allemand, &\npsychosocial theory of identity development may be espe-\ncially applicable to understanding a new potential for open-\nness to diversity during emerging adulthood. According to\nErikson's theory, identity development is an epigenetic pro-\ncess wherein specific issues tend to be addressed and resolved\nin a predictable order across the life span. A progression\nthrough childhood stages, of trust versus mistrust, autonomy\nversus shame and doubt, initiative versus guilt, and industry\nversus inferiority, culminate, in adolescence, in a crisis\ninvolving identity versus ego confusion. Each of Erikson's\nstages of identity development can be seen as relevant to the\nevolution of tolerance and openness to diversity, but the suc-\ncessful resolution of identity in adolescence would seem to\nbe especially pertinent. Erikson (1959) noted that, before a\nsense of identity is adequately established, adolescents\nbecome remarkably clannish, intolerant, and cruel in their\nexclusion of others who are \"different,\" in skin color or cultural\nbackground, in tastes and gifts, and often in entirely petty\naspects of dress and gesture arbitrarily selected as the signs of an\nin-grouper or out-grouper. (p. 97)\nAccording to Erikson,\nIt is important to understand . . . such intolerance as the necessary\ndefense against a sense of identity confusion . . . It is difficult to\nbe tolerant if deep down you are not quite sure . . . that you really\nand without a positive resolution of this stage, one is left with\n\" . . . distantiation: the readiness to repudiate, to isolate, and,\nif necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose\nessence seems dangerous to one's own . . . \" (p. 101). Erikson\ncontinued, \"This . . . repudiation is an outgrowth of the\nblinder prejudices which during the struggle for an identity\ndifferentiate sharply and cruelly between the familiar and the\nNot all who tolerate or even embrace diversity in others\ndo so because of a mature identity. For example, some ado-\nlescents may gravitate toward \"all that is different\" as they\nexplore various aspects of themselves or as a means of rebel-\nling against the status quo. It can also be argued that being\nindiscriminantly accepting of others' values may not be\ndesirable (Shady & Larson, 2010). Being open to a respectful\ndialogue and serious consideration of diverse perspectives\nmay be facilitated by feeling secure in oneself, however. We\nreasoned that successful resolution of the adolescent identity\ncrisis may facilitate the young adult's ability to tolerate oth-\ners' differences and foster the security helpful for under-\nstanding and appreciating others' perspectives, feelings, or\nneeds.\nPrincipled Moral Reasoning\nMuch research has been rooted in Kohlberg's developmen-\ntal theory of moral reasoning (Haggbloom et al., 2002).\nExtending Piaget's work on morality, Kohlberg's theory\n(Kohlberg & Kramer, 1969) posits that increasingly sophis-\nticated moral structures may emerge as developing cogni-\ntive capabilities interact with one's social and cultural\nenvironment. Although some have questioned the continued\nvalidity of this theory (Lapsley & Hill, 2008) and conceptu-\nalizations of prosociality and morality involve heated debate\n(Frimer & Walker, 2008), recognition of the utility of the\nKohlbergian approach (Boom, Wouters, & Keller, 2007) and\nthe importance of considering developmental issues in\nresearch on moral functioning (Gibbs et al., 2009)\ncontinues.\nThe neo-Kohlbergian approach of Rest and colleagues\n(2000) is well suited to studying a level of moral reasoning\nthat, developmentally, first becomes possible shortly before\nemerging adulthood. This approach describes moral sche-\nmas, with development seen as involving shifting distribu-\ntions of less and more mature types of moral reasoning. The\nthree main schemas--Personal Interest, Maintaining Norms,\nand Postconventional--are seen as increasingly mature\nways of answering \"the \"macro\" question (of) . . . how to get\nalong with people who are not friends, kin or personal\nacquaintances, i.e. how to organize society-wide co-\nmajor social-cognitive advance that allows for reasoning\nbeyond a Personal Interest approach and toward a sociocen-\ntric perspective. The Maintaining Norms schema involves\nappeals to a moral consensus that are based on established\npractice and existing authority, whereas the Postconventional\nschema is principled, viewing moral obligations as based on\nshared ideals, as reciprocal, and as open to scrutiny, debate,\nand tests of logical consistency. Principled moral reasoning\nmay best reflect a perspective that involves moving away\nfrom one's own self-interest and toward one that reflects\nconcerns with fairness, social justice, equality, and openness\nto diversity.\n4 SAGE Open\nEmpathy\nEisenberg and her colleagues have extensively studied the\nrelationship between empathy and prosocial behaviors and\nintentions, noting that \"other-oriented cognitions and emo-\ntions may foster prosocial moral judgment and vice versa\"\nand Eggum (2008), \"altruists see strangers as fellow human\nbeings\" and \"the cultivation of sympathy--especially for\nindividuals who . . . may differ in ethnicity, race, nationality,\nor other ways--is critical for enhancing cooperation and\naltruistic behavior\" (p. 69). Batson, Early, and Salvarani\n(1997) also noted that once empathic feelings are aroused,\nthey have some \"inertia,\" allowing for positive feelings to\ngeneralize to a stigmatized group as a whole and numerous\nother studies have found various aspects of empathy to pre-\ndict prosocial behavior (Batson et al., 2003; Eisenberg,\nFabes, & Spinrad, 2006; Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &\nThe Present Study\nCollege students are exposed to experiences with ethnicities,\nreligions, political views, values, and lifestyles that differ\nfrom their own. Consistent with Erikson's psychosocial the-\nory of identity development, we predicted that resolution of\nthe adolescent crisis involving identity and ego confusion\nwould significantly predict openness to diversity (Hypothesis\n1). In accordance with research on prosociality and moral\nreasoning, we predicted that principled moral reasoning\n(Hypothesis 2), and empathy (Hypothesis 3) and would also\nbe significant predictors.\nMethod\nInstruments\nSample demographics.\nThe Background Questionnaire\nassessed participants' age, gender, and ethnicity.\nOpenness to diversity. We chose to assess tolerance as defined\npositively, to reflect an interest in diverse others. As college\nstudents are typically exposed to others who differ in many\nways, including ethnicity, abilities, and sexual orientation,\nwe also selected an instrument that tapped diversity as\nbroadly defined.\nOpenness to diversity was assessed by the total score on\nthe Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale\n(M-GUDS). The M-GUDS was developed by Miville et al.\n(1999) to measure a universal-diverse orientation (UDO).\nQuestions address attitudes regarding a variety of potential\nhuman differences, including age, gender, race, abilities, and\nsexual orientation, and assess the degree to which there is a\nrecognition and acceptance of similarities and differences,\nboth past and intended interpersonal contact with diverse\nothers, and an emotional bond felt toward others.\nThe instrument consists of 45 items, rated on 6-point\nscales (from 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree).\nPositive and negative phrasings are present to avoid a\nresponse bias; negative items are reverse-scored, and a\nhigher score indicates higher levels of UDO.\nFive judges were involved in item development and\nassessment and a number of studies have assessed the instru-\nment's validity and reliability. In a series of four studies,\nMiville et al. (1999) found internal consistency to range from\n.89 to .94 and test\u00adretest reliability for the measure at 1 to 2\nMeans and standard deviations for the present study fell\nWhen tested with predominantly Caucasian samples\n(comparable with the present sample), construct validity for\nthe M-GUDS was supported by significant and positive cor-\nrelations with other measures of openness to others, includ-\ning the Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern subscales\nof Davis's (1980) Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the\nAutonomy scale of Helms's (1990) White Racial Identity\nAttitude Scale, Fassinger's (1994) Attitudes Toward\nFeminism and the Women's Movement Scale, as well as with\nAndrogyny and Femininity scores on the Bem Sex-Role\nInventory (Bem, 1974). Also as predicted by its developers,\nthe M-GUDS correlated significantly and positively with\nseveral measures of psychological health developed by\ntively with both Troldahl and Powell's (1965) Dogmatism\nScale and Hansen's (1982) Homophobia Scale. Discriminant\nvalidity was supported by low, non-significant correlations\nwith SAT Verbal scores, the Fantasy and Personal Distress\nscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and Crowne and\nMarlowe's (1964) Social Desirability Scale.\nIdentity development. Identity development was assessed by\nthe Measures of Psychosocial Development (MPD). Hawley\n(1988) developed this self-report instrument to assess the\ndegree to which each of Erikson's eight stages of psychoso-\ncial development has been resolved. It consists of 112 Likert-\ntype 5-point scales (from 1 = not at all like you to 5 = very\nmuch like you) about feelings, experiences, and self-\nconcepts. Each stage is represented by seven positive (e.g.,\nwilling to give and take in my relationships) and seven nega-\ntive (e.g., avoid commitment to others) statements, allowing\nfor the computation of positive, negative, and resolution\n(positive minus negative) scores for each stage.\nHawley (1988) found test\u00adretest reliability coefficients to\nCronbach's alpha coefficients to range from .65 to .84. The\nMPD correlated positively with corresponding traits on two\nother measures of Erikson's theory: Constantinople's (1969)\nInventory of Psychosocial Development (correlations = .46-\nrelations = .28-.65), supporting its construct validity.\nGerson and Neilson 5\nIdentity was assessed in the present study by subtracting\nthe subscore for adolescent ego confusion (i.e., experiencing\ndifficulty in integrating a central identity) from the subscore\nfor identity (i.e., knowing who one is, where one is going,\nand what one's goals and values are). Hawley (1988) reported\ntive sample of women. Means and standard deviations were\nMoral reasoning. The Defining Issues Test (DIT) was devel-\noped by Rest and colleagues (Rest, 1993; Rest & Narvaez,\n1998) to assess moral reasoning. Based on Kohlberg's theory\nof moral development, the DIT is conceptualized as a device\nfor activating moral schemas (Rest et al., 2000). Participants\nread six moral dilemmas and respond to a series of issue\nstatements which provide fragments of lines of reasoning.\nItems that both make sense to the participant and activate a\npreferred schema receive a high rating and rank. Scores rep-\nresent percentages of the relative importance that a partici-\npant gives to each of three modes of reasoning: Personal\nInterest, Maintaining Norms, and Postconventional (princi-\npled) schemas (Rest et al., 2000). Data that do not pass five\nreliability checks are purged.\nOver 400 published articles support the test's construct\nvalidity and reliability (Rest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau,\ncorrelate with moral education interventions, many prosocial\nbehaviors, desired aspects of professional decision making,\ncontroversial public policy and political attitudes, education\npost junior high school, age, and numerous cognitive mea-\nsures. Rest et al. reported that the DIT is equally valid for\nmales and females, and that DIT scores predict seven validity\ncriteria, above and beyond variance accounted for by scores\nof verbal ability/general intelligence or political attitude.\nCronbach's alpha and test\u00adretest reliability scores range\nThe P score is most often used to reflect a principled orien-\ntation, generally averaging in the 30s for senior high students\nand 40s for college students (Rest, 1993). The mean score fell\nand was used for assessing principled reasoning.\nEmpathy.The California Personality Inventory (CPI) is a\n462-item, self-report inventory, which consists of 20 \"folk\nscales.\" These scales were developed \"to assess the kind of\neveryday variables that ordinary people use in their daily\nlives to understand, classify, and predict their own behavior\nIn the present study, empathy was assessed by the inven-\ntory's Empathy Scale. The scale is composed of 38 true/false\nstatements, measuring the extent to which an individual\nunderstands the feelings of others. According to its devel-\noper, Gough (1987), a high-scorer would be \"comfortable\nwith self and well-accepted by others\" (p. 6) and would\nunderstand others' feelings, whereas a low-scorer would be\n\"ill at ease in many situations; unempathic\" (p. 6). A study\nwith college students indicated internal consistency for the\nscale to be .58, and test\u00adretest measures on high school stu-\nbe converted to standard scores.Ascore of 21 on the Empathy\nScale is at approximately the 50th percentile for both men\nand women. The mean for the present study was very close\nParticipants\nParticipants initially consisted of 282 entering first-year stu-\ndents (84% of the class) at a small, private university in\nsouthern California. No potential participants were purpose-\nfully excluded from the sample. All participants were at least\nwere approximately equally represented. The sample was\npredominantly Caucasian (74.5%), followed by Mixed Race\nethnicities. Two outliers (scoring over 3 SDs from the M)\nwere omitted from the data: One male scored very low on\nopenness to diversity and one male scored very low on iden-\ntity. Data were analyzed for the resulting 280 cases.\nProcedure\nThe study was approved by the university's Institutional\nReview Board (IRB), and the American Psychological\nAssociation's (2002) ethical guidelines for research with\nhuman participants were followed throughout the process.\nBefore beginning the study, all participants signed an\ninformed consent form detailing the procedure and notifying\nthem of their rights as participants. The consent form\nexplained that their participation would assist in a research\nproject on the thinking processes and attitudes of the fresh-\nman class. They were informed that questionnaire packets\nwere coded by identification numbers linked to their names\nfor a voluntary follow-up study to be offered in the future.\nParticipants were assured that all personal information would\nbe kept confidential and that participation was entirely vol-\nuntary. All identifiers, as well as informed consent forms,\nwere separated from the questionnaires and secured in locked\nfiles accessible only to the researchers. Participants were\ngiven contact phone numbers and email addresses of the\nresearchers to obtain a summary of the findings and to\naddress any questions or concerns.\nUniversity students completed the packet of question-\nnaires during their first-year orientation, 2 days prior to the\nstart of the fall semester. Packets were completed simultane-\nously in quiet classrooms, in groups of approximately 20.\nThe order of questionnaires in packets was counterbalanced\nand administration took approximately 1\u00bd hr.\n6 SAGE Open\nResults\nAn alpha level of .05 was adopted for all statistical tests.\nPrimary statistical analyses were conducted using the\nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences 20.0 (SPSS 20.0,\nprofessional package). One-tailed Pearson correlations were\nused only for hypothesis tests; otherwise, two-tailed tests\nwere used. Size of effect was assessed by R2 for multiple\nregressions and cutoffs recommended by Cohen (1992) were\napplied for interpreting squared values of r (.01 for small, .09\nfor medium, and .25 for large). All scores were approxi-\nmately normally distributed.\nHypothesis Tests\nAs predicted, openness to diversity correlated positively and\np < .001. In addition, it did not correlate positively with\nstages of non-principled moral reasoning and a two-tailed\ntest revealed that it correlated negatively and significantly\nwith stages of moral reasoning that reflect a personal interest\nThe three predictors were tested in a stepwise multiple\nlinear regression analysis, with PIN (minimum probability of\nF that a variable can have to enter the analysis) set at 0.050\nand POUT (maximum probability of F that a variable can\nhave and not be removed from the model) at 0.051. In all\ncases, Tolerance was at least .91 and variance inflation factor\n(VIF) was no greater than 1.10, satisfying possible collinear-\nity concerns. Empathy significantly predicted openness to\nB\nB\nB\naccounted for a moderately large proportion of the variance\nsupported.\nOther predictors of openness to diversity.We examined the\nrelationship between resolution of each of Erikson's first six\nstages of psychosocial development and openness to diver-\nsity. Theoretically, Stages 7 and 8 would not yet apply to\nemerging adults and so were not included in the analyses.\nOpenness to diversity correlated positively and significantly\nwith resolution of every stage: trust versus mistrust, r(280) =\ntion scores for the first six stages were entered into a stepwise\nmultiple linear regression analysis, openness to diversity was\nbest predicted by resolution of intimacy versus isolation,\nCI\nB\nity significantly added to this prediction, R2 = .01, F(1,\nB\n0.93]. Together, they accounted for a moderate proportion of\nthe variance, R2 = .09. Values for Tolerance (at least .78) and\nVIF (no greater than 1.28) were again well within acceptable\nranges.\nDiscussion, Limitations, and Conclusion\nOur Findings and Implications for Future\nResearch\nAs hypothesized, identity development, principled moral\nreasoning, and empathy each predicted openness to diversity.\nConsistent with previous research, empathy was a particu-\nlarly strong predictor. These findings confirm that intraper-\nsonal variables predict openness to diversity. They also\nconfirm the importance of considering cognitive, affective,\nand developmental variables in predicting openness to diver-\nsity for emerging adults.\nWe had predicted that resolution of the adolescent identity\ncrisis would be particularly important for facilitating open-\nness to diversity. Exploratory analyses found that resolution\nof the next stage, intimacy versus isolation, was an even\nstronger predictor, especially in combination with the earlier\nstage of industry versus inferiority. Both stages of intimacy\nversus isolation and industry versus inferiority are interest-\ning, as the first involves issues related to connecting with\nanother person and the second, confidence in one's own\ncompetence relative to peers. Erikson (1959) posited resolv-\ning identity versus ego confusion to be important for the\nstrength not to engage in \"distantiation\" and intolerance of\ndiverse others. Interestingly, a recent study (Tadmor et al.,\n2012) demonstrated that a cognitive need for closure predicts\nstereotype endorsement, racism, and discrimination.\nAlthough their study was based on a very different theoreti-\ncal framework from that of the present study, individuals in\nthe throes of ego confusion might be expected to have a need\nto protect themselves from the \"threat\" of diverse others. Our\nfinding for the relative importance of the next stage of devel-\nopment may in fact reflect how we operationalized tolerance.\nRather than assessing the absence of prejudice or intoler-\nance, our instrument (M-GUDS) measured a positive attitude\nof interest in exploring diversity--a characteristic which\nmay involve issues related more to intimacy and in being\nopen to linking with others. Promoting a positive interest in\nothers may support an appreciation for diversity. Future\nresearch should explore whether the mere absence of intoler-\nance involves different intrapersonal mechanisms than does\nembracing diversity.\nRegarding the stage of industry versus inferiority, Erikson\n(1959) wrote, \"this is socially a most decisive stage: since\nindustry involves doing things beside and with others, a first\nGerson and Neilson 7\nsense of division of labor and of equality of opportunity\ndevelops at this time\" (p. 93). It is also the first stage in which\nthe child's significant relations move beyond the basic fam-\nily, to include neighborhood and school (Erikson, 1959), pre-\nsumably with new-found opportunities for exposure to\ndiversity. It makes sense that successfully resolving issues\nrelated to working side-by-side with others outside the fam-\nily would be conducive to openness to diversity. Further\nresearch could explore the role of childhood experiences, as\nwell as ways to promote a sense of competence and develop-\nmental readiness to connect intimately with others.\nPrincipled moral reasoning was found to be a significant\npredictor of openness to diversity and non-principled moral\nreasoning was not. This is also an interesting finding given\nhow we operationalized tolerance. Other studies (Witenberg,\n2007) have found moral reasoning to be important in reac-\ntions to descriptions of another's prejudicial behaviors--sit-\nuations which may more clearly be tied to issues of justice,\nequality, and fairness. We found moral reasoning to be a sig-\nnificant factor in embracing differences as well, although the\neffect size for the variable was small. It may be worthwhile\nto study whether its strength as a predictor depends on how\ntolerance is operationalized. As noted by Witenberg (2007),\nunderstanding its role, as well as how moral reasoning pro-\ngresses developmentally, may have important implications\nfor curriculum design and social policy.\nFinally, empathy was found in our study to be the stron-\ngest predictor of openness to diversity. This finding is consis-\ntent with previous research linking empathy with both the\nreduction of prejudice and the presence of prosocial behavior\nVan Lange, 2008), and suggests that empathy may be related\nto an overall interest in being with and understanding other\npeople. Empathy may foster an identification with another\nperson in an emotionally significant way. Further research\ncould explore how far-reaching the effects of empathy may\nbe.\nNot only may multiple factors be involved in openness to\ndiversity, there may be individual differences regarding\nwhich factors predominate as well. In a person-level analysis\nof moral exemplars, for example, Walker, Frimer, and\nDunlop (2010) found that exemplary moral functioning can\narise from different sources across individuals. Specifically,\nthey found three \"clusters\" of moral exemplars: some heroes\nwere strong in relational and generative motives, some were\nstrong in sophisticated moral reasoning and self-develop-\nment, and others were quite \"ordinary,\" differing little from\nnon-heroes. Accordingly, it may be productive to explore\nwhether behaviors are motivated by heterogeneous factors,\nas opposed to universally resulting from a particular charac-\nteristic or combination of variables. Consistent with findings\nof Walker et al. (2010) for multiple possible motives for her-\noism, predictors may vary for individuals, subgroups, and\nsituations. The sample size of the present study prohibited\nreliable cluster analyses to identify possible distinct\npathways, but an informal review of the data revealed that a\nrelatively high score on no single predictor was a necessary\nprerequisite for a relatively high score on openness to diver-\nsity. Future research may consider exploring large samples\nusing a cluster analytic approach. Better questions than\nwhich variable is most important may be for whom are par-\nticular variables important and/or most efficiently strength-\nened, as well as what additional variables should be\nconsidered. Finding a single \"key\" to increasing openness to\ndiversity may not be as effective as designing programs that\naddress multiple factors and/or are tailored to individual\nneeds.\nFinally, it may be worthwhile to consider how these intra-\npersonal factors can be developed. As noted by Butrus and\nWitenberg (2013), \"There is a consensus that pro-social atti-\ntudes and behaviours of empathy, sympathy, compassion,\nand caring, which form the basis of tolerance, can be taught\nand learned\" (p. 297). There is also some evidence for bi-\ndirectionality among some of these variables and exposure to\nmulticultural experiences. Tadmor et al. (2012) found that\nexposure to multicultural experiences may be helpful in that\nthey may lead to a reduction in cognitive rigidity, thereby\nreducing intolerance. They conceptualized this growth in\nterms of responses to the cognitive disequilibrium and\nrepeated experiences with dissonance which led individuals\nto become \"epistemically unfrozen\" (p. 753). Experience\nmay be helpful by what it teaches a person about others, by\nresulting cognitive changes, and/or by changes in feelings\ntoward others. The interplay among multicultural experi-\nences, identity development, moral development, empathy,\nand other factors may be bi-directional. Developmental read-\niness may be important to consider, however, to minimize\nthe chances of destructive outcomes.\nLimitations of the Study\nAnumber of limitations are important to address. We selected\nonly three factors to explore as potential predictors of open-\nness to diversity. Our intent was not to address all relevant\nfactors, but rather to demonstrate that developmental factors\nmay be important to address, as well as both cognitive and\naffective domains. Other factors are also undoubtedly influ-\nential, including such intrapersonal or interpersonal variables\nas past and current experiences with diverse others, family\nattitudes (Castelli, Zogmaister, & Tomelleri, 2009; Stringer\nto temperament (Davis, Luce, & Kraus, 1994). Eisenberg\nand colleagues (Eisenberg & Eggum, 2008), for example,\nhave found that level of personal distress may impair one's\nability to be empathic toward others.\nEach of our factors could also be assessed by other mea-\nsures. Our instruments relied on self-report, which can give\nvaluable information about feelings, attitudes, and experi-\nences, but are limited to information about which a partici-\npant is both aware and willing to share. We believe that our\n8 SAGE Open\nmeasure of openness to diversity is particularly rich in that it\ntaps attitudes regarding multiple aspects of diversity, feelings\ntoward diverse others, and both past and intended behavioral\ncontact. Sound alternatives exist for measuring our con-\nstructs, however, and findings should eventually be tested\nwith direct behavioral measures. Distinctions between lack\nof intolerance and positive intergroup attitudes should also\nIt should also be noted that our sample was limited to\nundergraduates entering a small, private university in south-\nern California. We were able to include most of our entering\nfirst-year students; however, our students may have differed\nfrom other emerging adults in the general population or even\nat other universities. Further research is needed to confirm\nour findings with other samples. Furthermore, a larger sam-\nple would allow for cluster analyses to explore the possibility\nof multiple pathways to openness to diversity.\nConclusion\nWe found evidence for the relevance of a developmental\napproach, as well as for a number of specific intrapersonal\nvariables which included both cognitive and affective fac-\ntors. Identity development, principled moral reasoning, and\nempathy each significantly predicted openness to diversity in\nour sample of emerging adults. Continuing to define specific\nsituational features that support and elicit desired behaviors\nremains important future work--both exposure and educa-\ntion have been found to be effective in building acceptance\nof diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities. Including a\nconsideration of developmental and intrapersonal variables\nmay be important as well, however, both for increasing the\neffectiveness of such programs and for reducing the likeli-\nhood of adverse effects. In fact, it may be fruitful to explore\nways in which intrapersonal variables and situational factors\nmay benefit each other in a bi-directional way or even inter-\nact, to maximize the effectiveness of future programs.\nDefinitions of tolerance vary, from \"putting up with\" oth-\ners, to being genuinely interested in understanding and\nknowing about them, and the strongest predictors may\ndepend somewhat on the definition used. Our measure of\nopenness to diversity assessed the degree to which partici-\npants accepted similarities and differences, had both past and\nintended interpersonal contact, and felt an emotional bond\nwith others who differed from them in a variety of ways,\nincluding age, gender, race, abilities, and sexual orientation.\nAlthough resolution of identity versus ego confusion signifi-\ncantly predicted our measure of openness to diversity, reso-\nlution of the next stage of intimacy versus isolation was an\neven stronger predictor, and principled moral reasoning was\na significant but relatively weak predictor. A mere absence of\nintolerance, however, may be more closely linked to resolu-\ntion of the adolescent identity struggle as well as to concerns\nabout morality. Research should explore further which pre-\ndictors are strongest, based on an intervention's goals.\nWe also found suggestive evidence for multiple possible\npathways. Might some individuals be open to diversity\nbecause of feelings of empathy, others because of what they\nhave reasoned to be fair, and others because they have\nenough security in their own identity that they are not threat-\nened by differences? Considering how to assess an individu-\nal's developmental readiness and intrapersonal strengths or\nneeds may be helpful for creating successful programs.\nTolerance and mutual respect are crucial for peaceful\ncoexistence and success in today's multicultural and global\nsociety. Institutions of higher learning are attempting to\naddress the challenge with programs to build tolerance.\nEmerging adulthood, with its new-found potentials for matu-\nrity, is a particularly fruitful time, developmentally, to\naddress the acceptance of others, and understanding the com-\nplex array of factors involved in promoting openness to\ndiversity may be helpful for developing the most effective\nprograms possible.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, M.
