The respondents, mainly college students, were asked to\nassess the degree of un/desirability of sixty behavioural and personality traits in a\npotential mate, on the 7-point Likert type scale. The sexes strongly agree in\ngeneral ranking of the traits' desirability. The obtained statistically significant\ndifferences tend to favour the evolutionary interpretation. The largest differences\nare in the perceived desirability of thinness, strength, fearfulness, self-pity,\nfragility, aggressiveness, and beauty. Males perceived all these traits as more\ndesirable (or less undesirable) than females, except that females valued strength\nmore positively. Male respondents are less troubled by negative character traits of\na potential partner, while females are less concerned with a partner's physical\nappearance.

Convergence of the obtained findings\ncorroborating this simple generalization about sex differences has been followed\nby divergent theoretical interpretations. Two general approaches are presently\nrelevant: the socio-structural and that of evolutionary psychology.\nsex differences in mate selection criteria in humans. Since the number of\noffspring a Homo sapiens female can produce is limited, evolution would favor\nthose who are able to secure sufficient resources for upbringing her offspring.\nTherefore, part of the female reproductive strategy is to secure mates that are able\nand willing to provide necessary resources. Hence, Buss (1987) concludes, female\nmate choice criteria should include signs indicating control or potential control\nover necessary resources, and related personality traits \u00ad ambition, dominance,\ndiligence.\nBasic limitation for males' reproductive success is not so much in the access to\nresources (since their parental investment is modest), but rather in their access to\nreproductively capable females (Buss, 1987). Since female reproductive value is\nclosely related to age and health, these should be among the most important\ncriteria males should take into account. Because it is difficult to directly assess\nhealth and age, \"male mate preferences and standards of female beauty should\nevolve to reflect the physical and behavioral cues that signify female reproductive\ncapability... Physical appearance probably provides the strongest set of cues, and\nthese include features such as clear, smooth, and unblemished skin, lustrous hair,\nThe expected sex differences have repeatedly been observed in different studies\nmethodological approaches (Feingold, 1990).\nSocio-structural perspectives view sex differences in mate selection criteria as\nthe outcome of the interaction of class and gender inequalities, sexual power\nrelations, and patriarchal ideology (Eagly and Wood, 1999; Jackson, 1992). Eagly\nand Wood (1999) attribute the decisive causal influence to the different social\nroles men and women are routinely assigned. Since typical male social roles are\naccompanied with greater power and prestige, women, lead by the desire to\n\"maximize their outcomes within the constraints that society establish for people\nof their sex\" (Eagly and Wood, 1999, p. 414), seek to exchange their appearance\nand nurturance for characteristics associated with male roles (see also Hamermesh\nand Biddle, 1994). In favor of the socio-structural interpretation, for example,\ncould be the finding that in recent decades, with increased social and economic\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nequality, sexes have become more alike in their mate preferences, although the\nconvergence seems to be mostly due to men approaching women's standards\nContrary to the socio-structural hypothesis, however, a number of studies have\nfound that women of higher socio-economic status emphasize the importance of\npotential partner's `good financial prospects' even more than women of lower\nThe debate between the two theoretical orientations still seems to be\nunresolved, as attested by different interpretations of the same cross-cultural data\npossible ways to contribute to the issue is further cross-cultural research.\nCountries of the former 'Second World' are especially rarely studied in this\nrespect, which is unfortunate given the emphasis placed on equality among sexes\nin the official ideology of the 'Real Socialism'. In reality, gender equality was\npursued more sincerely with respect to political freedoms and the labor market\nthan in the private sphere, where communists remained rather conservative. Thus,\nit is important to examine whether experience with the specific official ideology\nmade our Serbian respondents different from those from other cultures.\nSince Serbia culturally represents a mixture of patriarchalism and a socialist\nmodernization project, we expected to replicate findings reported in the literature,\nbut we also expected a difference of relatively small magnitude. On the basis of\nstructural powerlessness hypothesis, we predicted that the socioeconomic status of\nwomen should be negatively related to their emphasis on economic resources of a\npotential mate.\nCertain methodological aspects of the present study should be noted. We opted\nfor the Likert-type items rather than for ranking in order to allow for the\nexpression of equal desirability of different traits. We also included a rather\nextensive list of traits (60 items) in order to examine whether sex differences exist\nin other areas besides preferences for resources and physical attractiveness.\nFinally, the respondents were asked for their preferences concerning long-term\npotential mates. Hence, the expected sex differences should be more likely to\nappear since men tend to relax their requirements in the context of short-term\nmating (e.g., Buss, 1994; for women's perspective on short-term mating see\nMethod\nSurvey and respondents\nThe survey was conducted in the spring of 1997, as a part of an extracurricular\ncourse in Social Psychology, at the Open University, Subotica, Serbia. Some of\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nthe respondents were the attendants of the course, who themselves collected the\nrest of data by administering the questionnaire to their peers, family members and\nacquaintances. The sample is not a random one, but it is comparable to the\nsamples from other related studies. Moreover, it is more diverse than typical\npsychology student samples. There were 127 respondents in total, of which 74 are\nfemales. The average age of the respondents is 18.5 years; the range from 15 to\nInstrument\nWe applied the frequently-used technique of a closed-ended list of un/desirable\nAllgeier, 1992). The respondents were asked to asses the degree of un/desirability\nof each of the 60 traits and characteristics (see Table 1) of a potential mate, on the\n7-point Likert type scale (from 1 \u00ad completely undesirable, unimportant, to 7 \u00ad\nmost important, most desirable). The questionnaire also asked for basic socio-\ndemographic indicators, such as age, sex, and education. Youngsters were asked\nfor their parents' education, while in case of adult respondents we used their own\neducational level.\nResults\nAverage estimates of trait desirability for the entire sample, and females and\nmales separately, are given in Table 1. Looking at the results for the total sample,\nwe can observe that among the traits assessed as the most desirable are sincerity,\nfaithfulness, tenderness, passion, reliability, maturity, and intelligence. Traits\nassessed as moderately desirable or important are, for example, courage,\nelegance, attractiveness, thinness, talent for sports, strength, thriftiness,\ndominance. The least desirable, or the most undesirable are traits such as\nconceitedness, selfishness, insecurity, aggressiveness, fearfulness, introversion.\nThere is a strong agreement between the sexes about this general ordering of\nthe traits, but there are some statistically significant differences. The largest\ndifferences (p's<.01) are in the desirability of aggressiveness, thinness, strength,\nself-pity, fearfulness, fragility, and beauty. Males perceived all these traits as more\ndesirable (or less undesirable) than females, except for the strength which is more\nvalued by women.\nThere are six additional items with somewhat smaller but still statistically\nsignificant differences (p <.05). Two items refer to appearance - good looks and\nattractiveness, and four items refer to personality traits: seriousness,\nindependence, enterprising, sincerity. Men scored higher on the former items,\nwhile the character traits were perceived as more desirable by women .\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nTable 1 Mean trait desirability assessments for the entire sample and separately for\nfemales and males (ordered descending from the most desirable trait)\nTraits* Entire\nsample\nStandard\ndeviation\nMales Females Significance of\ndifference (two-\ntailed t-test)\nattractiveness\nclothes\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nprofession\n47.

In the total sample,\nSES correlates with the perceived desirability of a mate's erudition (r=.20,\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nHowever, the results for the total sample hide the fact that none of the coefficients\nis significant in both subsamples.\nTable 2 Correlation between the perceived trait desirability and socio-economic status\nTraits Entire sample Females Males\nNote: Shown only traits where at least one coefficient is significant.\nAmong women, SES is in positive correlation with the estimated desirability of\na mate's erudition (r=.36, p<.01), passion (r=.33, p<.01), interesting profession\n(negatively) only with the importance attached to the taste for clothes (r=-.30,\np<.05). Thus, higher status women desire better educated, more passionate\npartners, who have interesting profession and are more talkative. Lower status\nmen desire, relatively more, partners who show better taste for clothes.\nDiscussion\nOf the 60 examined traits, statistically significant differences were obtained on\n13 characteristics. The size of even the largest differences (e.g., thinness,\naggressiveness) is relatively small in terms of the raw scores (somewhat above\none raw score point). Just as in many other studies (e.g., Buss, 1987; Goodwin,\n1990), we observed that sex differences in mate selection criteria are small.\nBoth sexes perceive traits such as faithfulness, sincerity, tenderness, reliability,\npassion, carefulness, as highly desirable. Traits with the opposite implications are\nassessed as the most undesirable (e.g., conceitedness, selfishness, insecurity,\naggressiveness, shyness). These highly desirable and undesirable traits seem to be\nimportant for interpersonal functioning, and are often regarded as consequential\nfor mate retention, rather than mate selection (cf. Buss, 1994).\nMany of the characteristics particularly relevant for the present research\nproblem are assessed as moderately desirable, or even neutral. In accordance with\nother reported results (Buss, 1989; Buss et al., 2001), traits pertaining to physical\nappearance are assessed as moderately desirable by both sexes. There is not a\nsingle trait referring to physical appearance in the upper third of the list - the\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nhighest graded is physical attractiveness, and it is 22nd on the list.\nOne category of traits that does differentiate sexes indicates negative\npersonality characteristics, including fearfulness, self-pity, and aggressiveness.\nAlthough both sexes evaluate these traits negatively, men are more ready to\ntolerate them in potential mates. From the point of view of evolutionary theory,\nthe more negative attitude of females towards fearfulness, fragility, and self-pity,\nmight speak of their anticipation of the failure of such person in social\ncompetition. At the same time, this can be explained from the perspective of the\ngender roles - these traits contradict traditionally defined masculinity.\nSeriousness, independence, and being enterprising are traits assessed\nsignificantly more positively by women. From an evolutionary perspective traits\nlike these are indirectly related to a mate's potential capability to secure resources\nand succeed in social competition. However, this provides rather modest support\nfor the hypothesis about `female choice'. Many of the traits more directly related\nto resource acquisition are equally desired by both sexes (e.g., intelligence,\nability, diligence, capability to earn, erudition, ambition, to have money, or to\nhave a car), thus confirming that \"desire for status is fundamental dimension of\nmate preferences for both men and women\" (Pratto, Sidanius and Stallworth,\nThinness, attractiveness, good looks, and beauty form another category of traits\nthat significantly differentiate sexes. All these traits are indicators of physical\nappearance, and are significantly more positively valued by men. This result\nconfirms sex-linked character of the importance of a mate's look in the long-term\nmating (e.g., Buss, 1994). It is interesting that a significant difference did not\nappear on the item physical attractiveness - the item that significantly\nWomen's more positive assessment of a mate's strength has somewhat\nambiguous meaning. Besides the `bodyguard hypothesis' (Mesnick, 1997),\nstrength can be interpreted as a character trait, potentially useful in social\ncompetition. On the other hand, strength could imply physical attractiveness from\nthe female point of view. Pratto et al. (1993) found that items such as dominant\nand tall loaded on factor \"sexy\" that contained attractiveness and sexuality items\namong women. Similar reasoning could be applied to women's lower valuation of\nbeing thin, thus challenging the evolutionary psychologists' claim that females\nplace less emphasis on the partner's physical appearance. Perhaps, male physical\nattractiveness is expressed in terms other than 'physical attractiveness'.\nFinally, the higher desirability of sincerity expressed by women, together with\ntheir already discussed more positive assessment of various personality traits\nspeaks not only about the care to choose a reliable partner, but also about the\nattention devoted to the quality of interpersonal relationship and a mate's\npersonality characteristics. Similar results are reported by, for example, Smith et\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nIn order to examine the hypothesis about the functionality of mate selection\ncriteria from the perspective of the subordinate position of women in socio-\neconomic structure, we examined whether sex differences existed in the\nrelatedness of SES and perceived trait desirability. SES generally does not\ncorrelate with perceived trait desirability. In the female sample, relatively low\nsignificant positive correlations are obtained between the SES and desirability of\na mate's erudition, passion, interesting profession, and talkativeness. To the\nextent that education and interesting profession indicate higher (potential) status,\nthis finding goes against socio-structural theories (cf. Wiederman and Allgeier,\n1992). Women of higher socio-economic status could `afford' relationships with\nlower status males since they themselves could provide resources, yet they instead\nincrease their requirements. While cross-cultural research show that sex\ndifferences in the emphasis on resource-acquisition characteristics diminish in\ngender-egalitarian societies (Kasser and Sharma, 1999), our findings reinforce the\ngeneralization that intra-culturally women's preferences for high status mates\nincrease with their SES.\nFrom the perspective of the theories examined it is not clear why women's\nperception of desirability of passion and talkativeness increases with SES. It is\npossible that higher-status females tend to become more demanding in general, as\nif their higher status is treated as an additional asset in the mate selection strategy\nallowing women to increase their demands. Negative correlation of SES and taste\nin clothing on the sample of males (the only significant coefficient) is also of\nunclear theoretical relevance. It is possible that a clothes, as a status symbol, is\nmore relevant for respondents of lower social status.\nConclusions\nThe hypothesis formulated on the basis of the evolutionary psychology\nperspective received qualified support: results indicate that males tend to attach\nrelatively greater weight to physical attractiveness of potential mates.\nNevertheless, sex differences in the evaluation of strength and thinness could be\ninterpreted as referring to male physical attractiveness, and therefore as evidence\nof women's specific emphasis on mate's physical attractiveness.\nWomen did not perceive traits directly referring to a mate's material wealth as\nmore desirable than men (traits such as capability to earn, success in job, or to\nhave money). The differences are obtained concerning the traits more indirectly\nrelated to material propsects of a potential mate, and to his readiness to share\nresources as well. These traits are seriousness, independence, being enterprising,\nand sincerity.\nThe hypothesis derived from (one possible interpretation of) socio-structural\ntheories, stating that with higher socio-economic status women should attach less\nMate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia\nimportance to a mate's material perspective, is not supported. Moreover, the\nresults contradict this hypothesis since higher SES is related with higher\nevaluation of a partner's erudition among women.\nIn general the results clearly suggest the essential similarity of men and\nwomen. Their congruence in the assigned desirability of the given traits is\nremarkable. Both sexes seem to strive for maximization along dimensions of\nattractiveness, status, and personality traits (Shaffer and Bazzini, 1997). Our\nrespondents seem to be concerned first with finding a partner with whom they\ncould develop and maintain a satisfying interpersonal relationship, and then with\nher or his appearance and economic status.\nReferences\nBotwin, M.
