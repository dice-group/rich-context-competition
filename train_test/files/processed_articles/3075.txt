This study also fills the gaps in our\nunderstanding of the patterns of medi-\ncal care for dog bite victims. With such\nanunderstanding,thebroadmedicaland\npublic health impact of dog bite\u00adrelated\ninjuries can be better appreciated and\ntargeted for preventive efforts.\nMethods\nData Source.--Data were obtained\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS), a\npopulation-basedstratifiedsampleofUS\nED visits.

Consistent with\nthe results of other reports, males were\nmore likely than females to be bitten by\ndogs,childrenhadthehighestrateofED\nvisits for dog bite injuries, and young\nchildren were more likely than adults to\nbebitteninthehead,neck,andfacearea.\nThe Table presents some interesting\ncomparisons between the incidence of\nthe dog bite\u00adrelated ED visits and ED\nvisits for selected injury types reported\nby the US Consumer Product Safety\nCommission (CPSC).20 The CPSC does\nnot currently collect or report dog bite\u00ad\nrelated injuries.\nWe also applied a limited but useful\npayment model to the data. This model\nwas based on averaging a non\u00adNCHS/\nNHAMCS sample of actual ED visit re-\nimbursements for each of several broad\nbody part\u00adbased diagnosis code group-\nings (details available from authors on\nrequest). This conservative model ex-\ncluded indirect costs (such as pain and\nsuffering or lost work, either by parents\nor the victim), charges for ED follow-up\nvisits and inpatient visits, and non\u00adED-\nrelated charges. Also, given the risk of\ninfection,22 the ragged nature of many\nbite-related lacerations, and the large\nnumber of dog bites treated by at least\nan initial course of rabies prophylaxis,\nthe average payment for a dog bite\u00adre-\nlated injury might be much higher than\nthediagnosticgroupaverageusedinthe\nmodel. Nevertheless, using this model\nweestimatetheaveragedogbiteresults\nin a payment to the hospital of $274 and\na national annual total payment for ED\nservices for new dog bite\u00adrelated inju-\nries of $102.4 million. Children and ado-\nlescents younger than 20 years ac-\ncounted for over half these payments\n($58.7 million), and Medicaid, Medicare,\nand other government sources were\nmentioned as payers in 26% of the visits.\nRegarding study limitations, some\nundercounting was possible since the\nNHAMCS data set had no cause of in-\njury text-string field available to search\nfor dog bite\u00adrelated visits that were not\nE-coded. Therefore, some bites may not\nhave been identified on account of miss-\ning or incorrect coding. However, a\nsingle, unambiguous E-code for dog\nbites limits the false positives likely in\nthe ICD-9-CM coding scheme used in\nthis data set.\nThe NHAMCS provides the ongoing\nability to quantify nationally the magni-\ntude of the incidence of hospital-treated\ndog bite injuries. This data set is a rep-\nresentative sample of the US popula-\ntion from which trends can eventually be\nfollowed for the nation as a whole and to\nset realistic goals for local programs.\nHowever, sample size issues result in\nlarge 95% CIs for many subgroup distri-\nbutions, limiting the data set's useful-\nness. Most animal control programs are\nadministeredlocallyandrequirelocaland\nmorespecificdata,suchasbreedtypeand\nmore specificity about the incident, for\nwhich the NHAMCS national ED sur-\nvey is not suited.\nAnalysisoftheNHAMCSdatasethas\nshown that each year US EDs treat\nassociated ED treatment payments of\nover $100 million. With more than one\nthird of American households owning a\ndog, the number of dogs in the United\nStates is over 50 million.23 Clearly, the\npopularity of the dog as both friend and\nprotector will not soon disappear. Con-\nsidering the risk to large parts of the\npopulation, especially to children, it is\nnecessary that effective preventive\nstrategies be developed and applied to\nreduce the painful and costly burden of\ndog bites. We know little about which\nstrategies work or do not work, how-\never.11 More knowledge is needed\nthrough a combination of enhanced and\ncoordinated dog bite reporting systems,\nexpanded population-based surveys,\nand implementation and evaluation of\npreventive trials. Particularly for the\nmoresevereepisodes,informationneeds\nto be obtained regarding high-risk\nsituations, high-risk dogs, and what\nleads to successful preventive interven-\ntions.\nThis study was supported in part by project\nServices for Children Program (Section 1910 of the\nUS Public Health Service Act), Health Resources\nand Services Administration, Department of\nHealth and Human Services.\nThe payment model was done with the assistance\nof Ted Miller, PhD, and tabulations by his colleague\nDiane Lestina at the Children's Safety Network\nEconomics and Insurance Resource Center, Na-\ntional Public Services Research Institute, Land-\nover, Md.
