At times, their trajectory becomes hidden for a brief period of time by other\nobjects. In these circumstances, the ability to accurately judge the time of reappearance of the hidden\nobject becomes very important. For example, to avoid an accident while driving, we have to judge, and\nwe do it quite accurately, the time it takes for a motorbike to pass behind a still bus at a bus stop. This\ncommon skill (innate ability) brings up many interesting questions. How do we perform an estimate of\noccluded motion on the base of visible motion?\nPrevious studies have addressed this issue by using a prediction-of-motion paradigm, in which\nobservers estimate the time to contact (TTC) using the speed information of the initiation of an object's\ntrajectory (prior to occlusion), i.e., the time between the disappearance of a target's leading edge\nbehind the occluder, and when it would make contact with a given point of interception. The difference\nbetween the \"total response time\" (total response time 5 TTC 1 duration of the visible trajectory) and\nthe \"physical arrival time\" results in the \"timing error.\"\nMany studies have sought to determine which strategy is best used to estimate TTC. One idea\nis that people use a \"cognitive clocking\" strategy (DeLucia & Liddell, 1998). They compute time to\ncontact prior to occlusion based on the rate of change in the visual angle between a moving target and\nits endpoint. This temporal representation can then be \"counted down\" during the occlusion period\n(Tresilian, 1995). The \"cognitive clocking\" model seems at odds with several findings. For example,\nit has been shown that moving distractors disrupt motion extrapolation performance (Lyon & Waag,\n1995). Furthermore, induction of the motion aftereffect where invisible trajectory occurs systemati-\ncally shifts response time (Gilden, Blake, & Hurst, 1995).\nRecent studies have provided direct and indirect evidence that people use an alternative \"track-\ning strategy\" for motion extrapolation across the frontoparallel plane (de'Sperati & Deubel, 2006;\nMakin & Poliakoff, 2011; Makin, Poliakoff, Ackerley, & El-Deredy, 2012; Makin, Poliakoff, Chen,\n& Stewart, 2008). Jonikatis, Deubel, and de'Sperati (2009) claimed that observers follow the target\nwith the spotlight of visuospatial attention while it is visible and perform a sequence of saccades that\nmirror the continuous extrapolated target movement. The \"tracking strategy\" (Makin & Poliakoff,\n2011) involves using memory of the target velocity during visible motion and the shift of visuospatial\nattention controlled by the oculomotor system (Rizzolatti, Riggio, & Sheliga, 1994), irrespective of\nwhether participants fixate (Huber & Krist, 2004; Peterken, Brown, & Bowman, 1991) or follow with\nIllusory speed is retained in memory during invisible motion\nIllusory speed in memory during invisible motion 181\na sequence of saccades (Jonikaitis, Deubel, & de'Sperati, 2009). This view is compatible with the pre-\nmotor theory of attention, in which shifts of spatial attention are produced by sensorimotor networks\nthat guide responses to external locations. Attention and motor planning are not distinct cognitive\nmodules; we shift attention to a spatial location by planning an action aimed at that location, even if the\nplanned action is never executed (Eimer, Van Velzen, Gherri, & Press, 2007). The tracking model pre-\ndicts that during a visible trajectory, visual velocity signals attained by extra-retinal input are retained\nin short-term memory. If stored velocity information can be retrieved from short-term memory (Kaas,\nWeigelt, Roebroeck, Kohler, & Muckli, 2010), it can remain active during occluded motion and direct\novert (covert) visual attention.\nIn this study, we investigate how the memory of visible velocity accurately reflects the perception\nof speed during a visible trajectory (Kaas et al., 2010; Makin & Poliakoff). In most cases, the \"tim-\ning error\" of TTC is found to depend on speed (Lyon &Waag, 1995; Peterken et al., 1991; Sokolov,\nobservers perform the task accurately at all speeds. However, several studies suggest that the relation-\nship between visual speed and TTC is not linear. Lyon and Waag (1995) found that the lower the speed,\nthe more difficult it is to detect when a target passes a given cue during the invisible motion. Bennett,\nBaures, Hecht, and Benguigui (2010) showed an overestimation of TTC during short periods of occlu-\nsion (less than 1 s) and an underestimation for long periods (greater than 1 s). Sokolov and Pavlova\n(2003) found that \"timing error\" depends on the interaction between the speed and visible trajectory.\nIn sum, depending on the visible velocity (either too low or too fast), on the time of occlusion, and\non the length of the visible trajectory, the memory of speed during occluded motion may not always\nbe isomorphic to the input received from the visible trajectory.\nThe most likely explanation is that the underlying neural mechanisms for coding velocity in\npart corresponds to those involved in memory of speed (Pasternak & Greenlee, 2005) and in part do\nnot. There is evidence from both imaging (Jiang, Ding, Gold, & Powell, 2008; Lencer et al., 2004;\nNagel et al., 2006; Shuwairi, Curtis, & Johnson, 2007) and primate neurophysiological data (Assad &\ning increased activity during periods of occlusion relative to full visibility. Indeed, the behavioral data\nassociated with imaging show a difference in pursuit latency (Nagel et al., 2006) and response latency\n(Shuwairi et al., 2007) between occluded and un-occluded conditions. This supports the suggestion\nthat visible and occluded motion evokes different speeds of processing.\nHowever, psychophysical studies show that speed information is stored in an extremely precise\nmanner in short-term memory. Speed discrimination thresholds are not impaired for the range of 130 s\nMagnussen and Greenlee (1992) tested two velocities: 2.5 and 5 deg/s for a 2 c/deg drifting grating.\nAlthough discrimination thresholds increased at higher speeds, reference velocity did not interact with\nthe retention interval: i.e. the Weber fraction was almost constant across retention intervals.\nThese results suggest that observers can use speed information stored in short-term memory pre-\ncisely. Our study questions whether speed information, as modulated by target contrast and size, is\nstored in the early visual perceptual memory system and whether it remains active during occluded\nmotion.\nIn this case, we predict that differences in perceived speed will be reflected during occluded\nmotion, independent of the range of visible speed, of the length of the visible trajectory and occluder,\nand of the type of task. To our knowledge, only two studies provided indirect support for this predic-\ntion. Sokolov and Pavlova (2003) found that \"timing error\" depended on the interactions between\nspeed and target size. Makin et al. (2008) showed that the current velocity of occluded motion was\nfaster after a previous trial with a fast velocity and vice versa.\nTo establish whether perceived speed is stored in short-term memory during occluded motion,\nwe explored whether subtle misperception of visible speed is maintained during occluded motion. We\nmanipulated parameters that are known to produce an illusory perceived speed of a moving target. It is\nwell known that perceived speed is affected by contrast (Thompson, 1982, 2003; Thompson, Brooks,\n& Hammett, 2006). Furthermore, it is well known that the perceived speed of an object is modulated\nby its size and by the width of the visible window where the object moves (Epstein, 1978).\nWe measured, as in previous works, the TTC to a visible cue (a bar). We did not compute a simple\n(absolute) \"timing error\" (Peterken et al., 1991), but rather analyzed the remembered speed: a ratio\nbetween the length of the invisible trajectory and the TTC measured only during invisible motion.\n182 Battaglini L, Campana G, Casco C\nWe believe that this ratio reflects a true pattern of underestimation and overestimation errors (Bennett\nWe know from previous studies that high contrast stimuli appear to move faster than low-contrast\nThompson et al., 2006). Thompson et al. (2006) found that underestimation of speed at low contrast\noccurred with grating targets of low (2 cpd) and high (8 cpd) spatial frequency. Experiment 1A was\ncarried out to check whether the effect of contrast on perceived speed also occurred when using small\ncircles in a continuous translational motion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSix volunteers, 4 males and 2 females, aged between 23 and 25, all right handed, took part in this\nexperiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. We obtained informed consent from\neach subject at the beginning of each experiment.\nStimuli and apparatus\nParticipants sat in a dark room, 57 cm away from the display screen. Viewing was binocular. Stimuli\nels. Each pixel subtended ~1.9 arcmin. The luminance of the background was 0.8 cd/m2. Stimuli were\npresented as small circles of 0.5 deg in diameter. The luminance of the standard stimulus (SS) was\n144 cd/m2 and that of the comparison stimulus (CS) was 1.1 cd/m2. Both were presented approximately\nat eye level. Luminance was measured using a Minolta LS-100 photometer. Each target appeared\nabruptly and traveled horizontally, either leftward or rightward, with equal probability. The motion\ntrajectory was produced by presenting the target in a new position in each frame. The visible trajec-\ntory started 9 deg from the center and ended after 12 deg. The speed of high-contrast SS was fixed at\n2.5, 5, or 10 deg/s; the speed of the low-contrast CS varied on nine levels: SS speed of 2.5 deg/s: 1.3,\nconditions of the SS, respectively.\nExperimental procedure\nThe experiment consisted of three blocks, each devoted to one speed, preceded by 18 trials of practice\n(2 repetitions  2 size  9 speed levels). Each block consisted of a random presentation of 180 trials\ncomprising 20 repetitions of the 9 speed levels. After 90 trials, a resting pause of 5 minutes was given.\nIn each trial, SS and CS trajectories were randomly presented in sequence, interleaved by an interval\nof 500 ms. We used a 2IFC task in which the subject had to report whether the stimulus perceived was\nfaster in the first or in the second presentation. All participants were instructed to track the moving\ntargets and to press the appropriate key (counterbalanced between subjects) to indicate the interval\nwith the faster target. The next trial started 1,000 ms after the subject pressed the appropriate button.\nNo feedback was given.\nResults\nPsychometric functions (Figure 1) were fitted to the probabilities of perceiving the low-contrast target\nfaster than the higher contrast one, as a function of the physical speed levels (Finney, 1971). We then\nconducted a two-tailed t-test to compare individual PSEs, i.e. the point of subjective equality to the\npoint of physical equality of speed (PE). Results revealed that the PSEs were larger than PE at every\nspeed of the SS: low (t(5)\nwhen the circles moved at the same speed, the low-contrast ones were perceived as slower. Interest-\ningly, the ratio between PSE and PE was constant at all speeds (1.04  0.01), suggesting that the effect\nof contrast on perceived speed increased linearly with speed.\nIllusory speed in memory during invisible motion 183\nExperiment 1A showed that the speed of the lowest contrast target was underestimated. The PSE\u00adPE\nratio was constant, indicating that the underestimation increased linearly with speed. Experiment 1B\ninvestigated whether the illusory speed was retained during occluded motion. If speed was retained,\nwe predicted the low-contrast target to be \"perceived\" as moving slower behind the occluder with the\nresult of an overestimation of TTC. Furthermore, we predicted a constant ratio between this stored\nsignal and the one obtained at high contrast across visible speeds. This would be indicative of simi-\nlarities between the perception of speed during visible motion and the memory of speed active during\noccluded motion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe same volunteers of Experiment 1A took part in this experiment.\nStimuli and apparatus\nThe apparatus, shape, and contrast of the stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1A. The target\nappeared abruptly 7 deg to the left or to the right of the screen with equal probability, and the extent\nof the linear visible motion trajectory was always 12 deg. The speed of the stimulus was 2.5, 5, or 10\ndeg/s. The length of the invisible trajectory was either 4 or 12 deg. A cue, a gray bar (luminance 1.89\ncd/m2, width 0.17 deg, height 1.7 deg) represented the end of the invisible trajectory (Figure 1). Stimu-\nlus duration varied from 1.6 and 9.6 s, depending on the speed and the length of the invisible trajectory.\nExperimental procedure\nWe used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. The experiment consisted of six blocks, three\nwith a low-contrast target and three with a high-contrast target. A block consisted of 120 trials ran-\ndomly presented: 3 speed  2 occluder lengths  20 repetitions, preceded by 12 practice trials (2\nrepetitions  3 speed levels  2 occluder lengths). The observers were instructed to follow the target\nwith their eyes until it reached the cue. They were also invited to \"follow\" the target with their eyes\nwhile it moved behind the occluder, and instructed to press the space bar when it reached the bar cue.\nThe next trial started 1,000 ms after the key press. No feedback was given.\nFigure 1. The probability of perceiving a low-contrast target faster than a high-contrast target. PSE, point of\nsubjective equality, indicates the speed that low-contrast stimuli should have to be perceived as fast moving as\nthe high-contrast stimuli.\nFigure 2.

For each speed level, we compared remembered speed data with a two-way repeated-measures\nANOVA having contrast (low vs. high) and invisible trajectory (short vs. long) as main factors. Results\nreveal an effect of contrast on TTC for the high (F(1, 5)\ninteraction contrast  occluder length (high: F(1, 5)\n5 1.13, p 5 0.34) was significant. These results indicate that target contrast modulates not\nonly perceived speed but also remembered speed.\nThe ratio between the remembered speeds obtained in the high- and low-contrast conditions is\nconstant at all speeds (low: 1.10, medium: 1.12, high: 1.12), suggesting that the effect of contrast on\nremembered speed increases linearly with speed. This suggests the involvement of a visual perceptual\nmemory system that precisely retains the illusory speed during occluded motion. Interestingly, the\nremembered speed ratio is higher than the PSE\u00adPE ratio obtained during visible trajectory (medium:\nnomenon may contribute to render the remembered speed illusory.\nIn addition, we conducted single-sample two-tailed t-tests to compare estimated TTC with actual\nvalues. The difference was significant only for the low-contrast target for both occluder lengths at the\nmedium- (short: t(5)\npower 5 0.69) and high-speed conditions (short: t(5)\nremembered speed with a low-contrast target.\nResults of Experiment 1 show that remembered speed, which according to the \"tracking model\" is\nneeded for judging TTC, retains the illusory effect of contrast on perceived speed. To further inves-\ntigate whether the illusion of speed is retained in memory, we applied the \"transposition principle\"\n(Brown, 1931). According to this principle, the perceived speed of one object is modulated by its size\nand by the width of the visible window within which the object moves. The bigger the target size and\nthe frame that delimits its motion, the slower is the perceived speed (Wallach, 1939). Other studies\nEpstein & Cody (1980) pointed out that the crucial factor producing the illusion was the size of the\ntarget, whereas the presence of the frame was irrelevant.\nFigure 3. The slopes of the oriented continuous lines on a time (TTCinvisible\n) space (occluder length) plot reflect\nremembered speed in the low- and high-contrast conditions. The dotted line represents the ideal slope that would\nbe obtained if remembered speed perfectly reflected physical speed.\nIllusory speed in memory during invisible motion 185\nIn Experiment 2A, we varied the shape and size of the target, i.e. a flat and long rectangle versus a\nsquare 10 times taller, in order to allow targets of different sizes to reach the end of the invisible trajec-\ntory at the same time. To our knowledge, there are no studies that report the \"transposition principle\"\nwhen shape and size co-vary and it is worthwhile to inquire whether the transposition principle holds\nin these conditions. With size and shape co-varying in Experiment 2A, we evaluated the extent of the\ntransposition principle during visible motion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA different group of nine participants, 2 males and 7 females, aged between 22 and 30, took part in this\nexperiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nStimuli and apparatus\nThe apparatus was the same as in previous experiments. The SS (small shape) was a rectangle of\n0.25 deg in height and 2.5 deg in width, and the CS was a square of 2.5 deg. Both were presented\napproximately at eye level, with a luminance of 144 cd/m2 on a dark background (luminance 0.8 cd/\nm2). Each target appeared abruptly and traveled horizontally, either leftward or rightward. Frame rate\nand visible trajectory were as defined in Experiment 1A. The speed of the small SS was fixed at either\n2.5 or 7.5 deg/s; the speed of the large CS varied according to nine levels: SS speed of 2.5 deg/s: 1.3,\nrespectively.\nExperimental procedure\nWe used the same experimental procedure as in Experiment 1A.\nResults\nPsychometric functions (Figure 4) were fitted to the probabilities of perceiving the large shape as\nfaster, as a function of the physical speed levels. We then conducted a two-tailed t-test to compare\nindividual PSEs with PE. Results showed that the PSEs were larger than PE at high speed (t(8)\nThis indicates that at a speed of 7.5 deg/s, the larger shape was perceived as slower. Different from\nExperiment 1, a PSE\u00adPE ratio larger than 1 was found only at the highest speed (1.08).\nExperiment 2A shows that at faster and equal speeds, a larger target is perceived as slower than a tar-\nget of smaller size. Experiment 2B investigated whether the illusory speed, as inferred from TTC, is\nretained during occluded motion. Both targets had the same width and speed, then reached the end of\nthe occluder at the same time. However, we predicted the largest target to be \"perceived\" as moving\nFigure 4.

The PSE indicates the speed that\nthe large shape should have to be perceived as faster as the small shape.\n186 Battaglini L, Campana G, Casco C\nslower behind the occluder, resulting in an overestimation of TTC. As in Experiment 2A, we predicted\na remembered speed ratio  1 at highest speed. This would be indicative that a visual perceptual\nmemory system is active during occluded motion, which precisely retains subjective visible speed.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe same nine volunteers took part in this experiment.\nStimuli and apparatus\nThe apparatus, stimulus shapes, and luminance were identical as in the previous experiment (2A).\nThe target appeared abruptly 7 deg to the left or to the right of the screen with equal probability, and\nthe extent of the visible motion trajectory was always maintained at 12 deg (Figure 5). The speeds of\nthe stimuli were either 2.5 or 7.5 deg/s. Stimulus duration was 1.6 or 4.8 s, depending on the speed and\nthe length of the invisible trajectory: 4 or 12 deg.\nExperimental procedure\nWe used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. This experiment consisted of one block of\n160 trials randomly presented: 2 speed  2 occluder lengths  2 size of the target  20 repetitions,\npreceded by 16 practice trials (2 size  2 speed levels  2 occluder lengths  2 repetitions). After 80\ntrials, a 2-minute pause was given. The observers were instructed to follow the target with their eyes\nduring its visible and invisible trajectory, and to press the space bar when it reached the bar cue. The\nsucceeding trial started 1,000 ms after the subject pressed the appropriate button. No feedback was\ngiven.\nResults\nRemembered speed is represented on a time\u00adspace plot (Figure 6).

This indicates that the subjective illusory speed during visible\ntrajectory is retained during the occluded motion.\nThe one-sample t-test revealed that with a large target, the TTC is significantly greater than the\nactual one at high speed for both occluder lengths (short: t\nlong: t\nAt high speed, where the transposition principle works, the remembered speed ratio (1.12) does\nnot significantly differ from the PSE\u00adPE ratio (1.08) obtained during visible trajectory (t(8)\nOur data show an underestimation of remembered speed for the low contrast (Experiment 2A) and\nfor the large targets (Experiment 2B), indicating that remembered speed is involved during occluded\nmotion and reflects the perception of visible speed. It is possible that changing contrast and size/shape\ninfluences subjective perception of speed during the initial visible part of the presentation, which com-\nbined with amplitude of the visible and occluded part of the trajectory could then influence the estima-\ntion of time to contact based on a counting strategy. That is, participants could establish an estimation\nof TTC prior to target occlusion, and then countdown to contact without any need to memorize speed\nduring occlusion. To check this possibility, we ran a third experiment in which the occlusion duration\nand the position of reappearance were always unpredictable, preventing any a priori knowledge of\nwhen or where reappearance would occur (DeLucia & Liddell, 1998; Makin & Poliakoff, 2011; Makin\net al., 2008). A persistence of an effect of contrast with this paradigm would favor the hypothesis that\nsubjects can precisely use speed information stored in short-term memory during the extrapolation of\noccluded motion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSix volunteers, 3 males and 3 females, aged between 23 and 28, all right handed, took part in this\nexperiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. We obtained informed consent from\neach subject at the beginning of each experiment.\nStimuli and apparatus\nThe apparatus was the same as in Experiment 1A. The stimuli, luminance, and diameter were the same\nas in Experiment 1A. The length of the invisible trajectory was 4, 8, or 12 deg. The velocity of the\nstimuli was always 7.5 deg/s. The visible trajectory (12 deg) started 11 deg from the center. Without\naltering the length of the invisible trajectory, a reappearance error of 0, 150, and 300 ms was added\n(Figure 7). After the reappearance, the target ran 6 deg and then disappeared. At 300 ms after target\noffset, a 300-Hz pure tone alerted observers to press the response button.\nFigure 7. Diagrammatical representation of the events in a single trial for the high- and low-contrast conditions.\nThe target reappeared either at the correct time or with an error of 150 or 300 ms, assuming a constant velocity\nduring occlusion. Participants discriminated between early and late reappearances.\n188 Battaglini L, Campana G, Casco C\nProcedure\nWe used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. The experiment consisted of 300 trials ran-\ndomly presented: 2 contrast  3 occluder lengths  5 levels of reappearance errors  10 repetitions,\npreceded by 30 practice trials (2 contrast  3 occluder lengths  5 levels of reappearance error \n1 repetition). After 180 trials, a 2-minue pause was given. The observers were instructed to press an\nappropriate button to indicate whether the target reappeared earlier or later, even when the target reap-\npeared in time. Eye movements were allowed. The next trial started 500 ms after the subject pressed\nthe appropriate button. No feedback was given.\nResults\nWe conducted a 2  3  5 repeated-measures ANOVA with contrast (low vs. high), occluder length\nResults (Figure 8) revealed a significant main effect of the contrast (F(5)\npearance errors (F(5)\nThis effect confirms (Magnussen & Greenlee, 1992) that remembered speed follows Weber's law.\nIndeed, if remembered speed at low contrast is underestimated, this would explain why subjects are\nmore accurate in discriminating very small reappearance errors in the low-contrast condition.\n7 Discussion\nIn agreement with the literature, Experiments 1A and 2A show that speed is underestimated when\nthe size of the target is increased or when its contrast is lowered. We did not replicate the finding\n(Thompson et al., 2006) that the effect of contrast inverts when the target speed is larger than either\n4 deg/s (with 2-cpd target) or 2 deg/s (with a 8-cpd target).Alternatively, we found a linear relationship\nbetween the effect of contrast and speed. This may be due to the different stimulus analyzers involved:\nhigh-level shape analyzers in our stimulus conditions versus low-level spatiotemporal tuned filters in\nthe conditions of Thompson et al. (2006). In Experiment 2A, we found an effect of large target size\ndespite the absence of the reference frame. However, it is smaller (8%) with respect to that reported in\nprevious studies. Epstein (1978) reported an increment of 45% in perceived velocity when the size was\nhalved. The absence of the reference frame could explain the difference. However, Epstein and Cody\n(1980) showed that the frame of reference is not necessary. Compared with previous studies, we used a\nfixed trajectory length. This factor, together with the different shapes used (the smaller size target was\na rectangle and the larger one a square), could explain the smaller illusion.\nMost importantly, Experiments 1B, 2B, and 3 showed that the misperception of speed due to either\ncontrast or size influenced remembered speed, as inferred from TTC during occluded motion.\nInterestingly, results of Experiment 2B are in line with previous findings (Sokolov & Pavlova,\n2003; Sokolov et al., 1997), but not with studies made in a more ecological environment (Horswill,\nIn Experiment 3, by using a paradigm that prevents or at least discourages counting (DeLucia &\nbered speed. Results suggest that remembered speed follows Weber's Law: given that remembered\nFigure 8. Psychometric functions of probability of judging the target late on reappearance error, for the low- and\nhigh-contrast conditions.\nIllusory speed in memory during invisible motion 189\nspeed(low contrast)\n< remembered speed(high contrast)\n, a smaller  remembered speed needs to be added (or\nsubtracted) to discriminate it. Indeed, as Figure 8 shows, the effect of the contrast seems greater with\nthe longer occluder length. This may account for higher accuracy in discriminating very small reap-\npearance errors with a low-contrast target.\nThe results provide support for the involvement of an early visual perceptual memory system during\noccluded motion. We believe that the modulation of remembered speed by contrast and size is an effect\nthat cannot be assimilated to any of the speed effects previously described. Apart from other studies that\nfind a dependency of TTC on the length of the occluder (Bennett et al., 2010; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003),\nwe found no effect of occluder length on remembered speed, neither in Experiment 1B nor in Experi-\nment 2B. In other words, given a fixed visible speed, the remembered speed gathered from TTC is simi-\nlar, regardless of occluder length. We believe that these results are reliable because they are free from\nbias. Instead, previous studies used the \"timing error\" which is not a bias-free parameter: since speed is\nspace over time, the same variation in remembered speed leads to a smaller \"timing error\" at high speed.\nThus, the lower error at high speed previously found (Peterken et al., 1991; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003)\ncould only be an artifact. Second, the illusory remembered speed cannot be confounded with the effect\n2003). Figures 3 and 6 disentangle these two effects. They show, as expected, that remembered speed\nis underestimated in both experiments at high speed, whereas at low speed, remembered speed either\nreflects perceived speed in a precise manner (Experiment 1B) or is overestimated (Experiment 2B).\nYet, we found that the remembered speed ratio is isomorphic with the PSE\u00adPE ratio. In Experiment 1,\nthe two ratios are constant across speeds. In Experiment 2, the illusion is present in both perceived and\nremembered speeds only at high speed. Third, the illusory remembered speed cannot result from an\ninteraction between speed and visible trajectory (Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003) since the visible trajectory\nis fixed in all conditions.\nOne apparent contradiction in the results of Experiment 1 is that the value of remembered speed\nratio (~1.12, Experiment 1B) is larger than that of the PSE\u00adPE ratio (~1.04, Experiment 1A). One\npossible explanation is that size constancy by depth cues fails during occlusion (Dresp, Durand, &\ntarget as smaller than it is, and according to Thompson et al. (2006), this gives rise to a larger effect\nof contrast.\nConsolidating our results demonstrates that visible illusory speed affects either the absolute judg-\nment (Experiments 2A and 2B) or the discrimination (Experiment 3) of remembered speed. This sug-\ngests the involvement of an early visual memory system by either a mental imagery or a higher level\nvelocity representation (more likely during pursuit) that retains the sensory characteristics of visible\nspeed. Based on these findings, we are tempted to speculate that remembered speed may share pro-\ncessing with visual memory processes occurring at low cortical levels (Huber & Krist, 2004; Jonikaitis\net al., 2009). Indeed, Makin et al. (2009) showed a positive event-related component over occipitopa-\nrietal areas both with visible and invisible moving targets, although in the occluded condition the peak\noccurs 200 ms after the onset of occlusion and is not related to a target velocity. Kaas et al. (2010)\nshowed that imagery of a motion trajectory produced a bold signal in MT/V51.\nIn conclusion, our results agree that TTC estimation during occluded motion is mediated by mem-\nory and suggest that an early visual perceptual memory system closely linked to mechanisms of visual\ndiscrimination is involved (Huber & Krist, 2004; Jonikaitis et al., 2009). This memory may share the\nproprieties of either visual imagery or mental representation and produce an internal simulation of the\ncontinuous motion of the invisible target.\nReferences\nAdelson, E.H., & Bergen, J.R.
