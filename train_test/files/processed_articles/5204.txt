Thus, given the moderate to high\nheritability of male aggressiveness, the State tends to remove violent predispositions from\nthe gene pool while favoring tendencies toward peacefulness and submission.

And it has been doing so at an accelerating rate, particularly after agriculture\nreplaced hunting and gathering less than ten thousand years ago. At that time, the rate of\ngenetic change may have risen over a hundred-fold (Hawks, Wang, Cochran, Harpending,\nBy then, our species had colonized almost every biome on the planet: savanna,\ntropical rain forest, temperate woodland, boreal forest, and arctic tundra. It was not because\nwe were adapting to new ecological environments that genetic change sped up. Rather, the\ncause was a proliferation of new social environments.\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nMany of these new social environments limited male behavior, particularly violent\nbehavior. Previously, men could use violence more freely for self-advancement, notably to\nattract women and to sire children. This is still the path to male reproductive success among\nthe Yanomam\u00f6, a horticulturalist people of Amazonia, among whom significantly more\nchildren are fathered by men who have committed homicide than by those who have not\n(Chagnon, 1988). Among the Ache, a hunter-gatherer people of Paraguay, \"homicidal\"\nmen do not have more offspring but more of their offspring survive, either because strong\nfathers better protect their children or because some other factor makes both father and\noffspring healthier than average (Hill and Magdalena Hurtado, 1996, p. 445).\nThis situation reversed with the rise of State societies. Over circumscribed\nterritories, power fell into the hands of a few \"big men\", often only one, and violence\nbecame a privileged instrument of power. In such societies, reproductive success required\ncompliance with the State, including its monopoly on violence. Successful men tended to\nhave higher thresholds for violent behavior when acting on their own and relatively lower\nones when acting under the command of authority (Milgram, 1974).\nInitially, men complied by changing their behavior within the limits of phenotypic\nplasticity. This shift in the mean phenotype created a more peaceful society where violent\nmales were less often imitated, celebrated, and accommodated. The more placid males\nwere now the ones who enjoyed reproductive success, the result being a parallel shift in the\nmean genotype. In sum, once the State began to enforce its monopoly on violence, it\nfavored not only certain phenotypes but also, indirectly, certain genotypes. Cultural\nevolution led the way for biological evolution, a process called Baldwinian selection.\nSuch selection was possible because male aggressiveness is moderately to strongly\nheritable. A heritability of 40% is suggested by a meta-analysis of 51 twin and adoption\nstudies (Rhee and Waldman, 2002). A later twin study indicates a heritability of 96%, the\nsubjects being 9-10 year-olds from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Baker, Jacobson, Raine,\nLozano, and Bezdjian, 2007). This higher figure reflects the closer ages of the subjects and\nthe use of a panel of evaluators to rate each of them. According to the latest twin study,\nheritability is 40% when the twins have different evaluators and 69% when they have the\nThe historical economist Gregory Clark argues that this kind of behavioral selection\nshaped the English population. Once central authority had become established, male\nhomicide fell steadily from the twelfth century to the early nineteenth. Meanwhile, there\nwas a parallel decline in blood sports and other forms of exhibitionist violence (cock\nfighting, bear and bull baiting, public executions) that nonetheless remained legal\nthroughout this period. Clark ascribes the behavioral change to the reproductive success of\nupper- and middle-class individuals who differed statistically in temperament from the\nmuch larger lower class. Although they were initially a small minority in medieval\nEngland, their descendants grew in number and gradually replaced the lower class through\ndownward mobility. By the nineteenth century, such lineages accounted for most of the\nnumbers to make their behavioral mean the norm for English society.\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nFormation of the Roman state\nLike its English counterpart, the Roman state created a central authority,\nmonopolized the use of violence, expanded through military conquest, and enjoyed lengthy\nperiods of internal peace.\nIn the Roman view, the State emerged from a loose group of individuals called\nlatrones (singular latro, usually translated by \"bandits\") who commanded respect through\ntheir charisma, access to prized resources, and ability to inflict violence (Shaw, 1984). To\nthe extent that they gained control over a population and its territory, they also gained a\nstake in its well-being and ceased to be purely parasitic. An incipient state would take\nshape. As Augustine wrote in the fifth century:\nAnd so if justice is left out, what are kingdoms except great robber\nbands? For what are robber bands except little kingdoms? The band also\nis a group of men governed by the orders of a leader, bound by a social\ncompact, and its booty is divided according to a law agreed upon. If by\nrepeatedly adding desperate men this plague grows to the point where it\nholds territory and establishes a fixed seat, seizes cities and subdues\npeoples, then it more conspicuously assumes the name of kingdom ...\n[Augustine. De civitate dei 4.4]\nJust as yesterday's bandits could become tomorrow's monarchs, the reverse was\nalso true. Following a struggle for succession, the defeated factions would lose not only\ntheir legitimacy but also their sources of pay and provisioning. Many would turn to\nThe Pax Romana\nThe Roman state was supposedly founded by two bandit brothers, Romulus and\nRemus [Livy. 1.4.9, 1.5.4]. The next six centuries saw it expand from a small core to the\nlimits of the Mediterranean world. As conquest gave way to pacification, the State sought\nto change the behavior of the newly conquered and even their character:\nBy humanitas the Romans meant two things: the adoption of the customs\nand the value system of the Roman people and material prosperity. The\nfirst was to be achieved by pacification, subjugation, and\n\"Romanization\"; the second was provided under the umbrella of the Pax\nRomana. By pacifying unruly elements, the Pax Romana allowed for\ntheir integration into civilization itself: it promised urbanization, cultural\nrefinement, and in some instances, even enfranchisement. (Parchami,\nThe Pax Romana did not mean peace with rival empires. Nor did it really mean\npeace within the empire. Indeed, it meant regular use of State violence to quash revolts by\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nslaves or the newly conquered and to fight brigands, bandits, pirates, and the like. Violence\nhad become a state monopoly and any transgressors became enemies of the State.\nThus, pax did not exclude State violence, as Weinstock (1960) explains. \"Pax, the\nroot-noun of the verb pacisci, did not originally mean \"peace\" but a \"pact\" which ended a\nwar and led to submission, friendship, or alliance.\" With the establishment of empire, this\nmeaning narrowed: \"pax was no longer a pact among equals or peace but submission to\nRome, just as pacare began to refer to conquest.\" In short, pax was not the absence of war.\nIt was the outcome of war. It was submission to a single authority, i.e., the State.\nThe Pax Romana was far more lasting and widespread than any previous pax. As\nAristides, a second-century philosopher, observed: \"Now total security, universal and clear\nto all, has been given to the earth itself and those who inhabit it\" [Regarding Rome 104]\n(Parchami, 2009, p. 33). This pax did not simply benefit the elites by eliminating potential\nrivals. It made everyone wealthier by protecting life and property, by allowing traders to\ntravel freely, and by keeping disputes between individuals or communities from erupting\ninto violence.\nBut these benefits incurred a social contradiction. Whereas the State could achieve\nits ends violently, simple citizens had to achieve theirs peacefully. What was legitimate and\neven noble in one case was illegitimate and despicable in all the others. Initially, this\nsituation seemed normal. It certainly seemed so to the ruling elites, particularly during the\nearly years of empire when their subjects were mostly \"objects\"--the spoils of recent\nconquests. Nor did the general population see any hypocrisy. Were not the Gods\nthemselves above the law?\nA new set of selection pressures\nThe Pax Romana punished those men who had previously enjoyed high\nreproductive fitness, i.e., the latrones. First, their access to resources, including women,\nwas cut off through ostracism. They became non-persons without the rights of other\nlawbreakers. \"The person stigmatized with the label of bandit did not have normal access to\ncourts for judgements, a marriage was declared to be null and void if one of the partners\nwas discovered to be a latro, and so on\" (Shaw, 1984, pp. 22-23). The stigma even\nsurvived death, as indicated by Galen, a second-century physician:\nOn another occasion we saw the skeleton of a bandit lying on rising\nground by the roadside. He had been killed by some traveller repelling his\nattack. None of the local inhabitants would bury him, but in their hatred\nof him were glad enough to see his body consumed by the birds which, in\na couple of days, ate his flesh, leaving the skeleton as if for medical\ndemonstration.[Galen. De anatomicis administrationibus 1.2] (Shaw,\nSecond, the Roman state made violence against individuals an offense against the\ncommunity. All citizens were given access to law courts and, more importantly, the courts\ncould enforce their decisions (Liebeschuetz, 2006, p. 40). In the case of latrones, justice\nwas summary and procedure minimal. Punishment likewise set them apart from other\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\ncriminals, being typically a death sentence by one of the brutal methods allowed: throwing\nto the beasts, burning alive, and crucifixion (Shaw, 1984, p. 20).\nThird, the State hunted down such people. In military districts, this function fell to\nthe army (Shaw, 1984, p. 18). Indeed, the frontier defenses served not only to stop external\nenemies but also to police the semi-pacified local population (Shaw, 1984, p. 12). Areas\nunder civil rule had stationes (guards, posts) and viatores (road patrols), but the bulk of\npolicing was done by vigilantes in the pay of landowners or simply by private individuals.\nHere, the State mobilized the general population in the fight against latrones:\nThe laws also stress that it is the duty of private individuals to detect, to\npursue and to betray bandits to local authorities. In the pursuit of this\nobligation the private individual was authorized to use force, to injure and\neven to kill such men. And they were also exempted, in doing this, from\nPacified versus unpacified peoples\nThis legal environment stood in contrast to the one beyond the northern borders of\nthe Roman state. \"Barbarians\" took the law into their own hands. Law courts did exist but\ntheir rulings had to be enforced by the aggrieved party. There was no State enforcement:\nThe injury was treated as an offense against the injured and his kin and it\nwas left to the injured and/or his kin, not to the community, to compel the\nperson who had caused the injury to give compensation for the damage he\nhad inflicted. Unless the perpetrator or his kin paid compensation, it was\nthe duty of the victim or his kin to take vengeance on the perpetrator or\nhis kin. But the use of force was likely to start a chain of retaliation, in\nFeuding began easily and lasted indefinitely because of the readiness to meet violence with\nviolence. For all these reasons, a private individual was much likelier to kill or be killed in\nbarbarian society than under Roman administration (Liebeschuetz, 2006, p. 46).\nThis societal difference was commented on at the time. Barbarians were said to be\ninherently violent:\nBoth explicitly and implicitly late antique writers created a generic\nbarbarian identity that was intimately associated with violent behavior.\nThis was only consistent with a classical literary tradition in which\nbarbarians were associated with several violence-related traits, including\ncrudelitas (cruelty), feritas (wildness), immanitas (savagery),\ninhumanitas (inhumanity), impietas (impiety), ferocitas (ferocity), furor\nToday, we might attribute such traits to external circumstances and not to internal\npredispositions. After all, these people were ancestral to today's civilized Europeans. The\npicture is less clear if we read the Roman literature of the time.\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nTheir violent nature also meant that barbarians were thought to be\ngoverned by their emotions rather than by their intellect. Seneca could\nclaim that grief particularly affected \"barbarians more than persons of a\npeaceful and learned people\" and that barbarians were more likely to\nbecome angry. He also commented on barbarian lack of self-control:\n\"Whom does one admire more than one who controls himself, who has\nhimself under control? It is easier to rule barbarian nations and those\nimpatient of alien rule than to contain and control one's own mind.\"\nFinally, Libanius suggested, \"In this regard in particular I find the Greeks\nalso to be superior to barbarians. The latter are akin to beasts in despising\npity, while the Greeks are quick to pity and get over their wrath.\"\nAlthough barbarians were thought to be violent by nature, this predisposition was\nnot understood in terms of selection for certain heritable traits. Instead, the cause was said\nto be the climate, i.e., if a country is too hot or too cold, its people will have a less balanced\nhoped to build a world empire and were thus inclined to believe in a single human nature.\nIs it likely, then, that Romans and barbarians had differing temperaments because of\ndiffering selection pressures? To create and maintain a mean difference in temperament,\nsuch pressures need a barrier to the flow of individuals, and hence genes, between the two\npopulations. Barbarians did enter the Roman world as mercenaries or foederati (allies who\nhad to provide military forces for the emperor on demand), but this inflow was not\nsubstantial until the fourth century, when the army could no longer recruit enough soldiers\n10-15% of the empire's population seems to have been of external barbarian origin\n(Williams and Friell, 1994, pp. 37-38). Barbarians also entered the Roman world as slaves,\nbut this source too seems to have been relatively minor. Slaves came mainly from two\nregions within the empire, one being Asia Minor and Syria and the other the lower Danube\nand the northern Black Sea coast (Gordon, 1924). Beginning around the time of Christ,\nthere was a gradual increase in the flow of slaves from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly into\nthe eastern provinces, but this inflow seems to have become substantial only in late\nThus, while the empire was not a closed system, there was relatively little gene flow\nfrom outside until the century before the fall of Rome. Long before then, observers were\nalready commenting on the differing temperaments of Romans and barbarians.\nPacification and the shift to a new ideological environment\nTo maintain control, Rome had to preserve its martial values while instilling\npacifism and submissiveness in its new subjects. This social contradiction would eventually\nbecome unsustainable.\nFirst, the conquered assimilated into Roman society. Many became citizens and, as\nsuch, enjoyed certain rights and protections. Second, the State no longer had to be so\nviolent with its subjects. Piracy largely disappeared following the battle of Actium in 31\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nBC. After the emperor Hadrian (117-138 AD), there were no new provinces to pacify and\nfewer rebellions in the older ones. The social climate had become so calm by the first\ncentury that Plutarch could write: \"so far as peace is concerned the peoples have no need of\nstatesmanship at present; for all war, both Greek and foreign, has been banished from\namong us and has disappeared\" [Praecepta gerendae reipublicae 32].\nThird, a profound behavioral change was spreading through the population. People\nwere less willing to become soldiers than earlier generations had been, and many would\npay gold or cut off their thumbs to avoid military service (Swain and Edwards, 2004, pp.\ninterested in violence and more submissive to authority. In fact, the new Romans were\ncoming to see arrogant, aggressive conduct as wrong, even wicked. Yet this was how the\nGods themselves behaved. Increasingly, people looked elsewhere for spiritual comfort.\nInto this new behavioral environment came Christianity. Indeed, one of the early\nChurch fathers, Origen (185-254 AD), explicitly linked the success of his faith to the Pax\nRomana:\nGod was preparing the nations for his teaching, that they might be under\none Roman Emperor, so that the unfriendly attitude of the nations to one\nanother, caused by the existence of a large number of kingdoms, might\nnot make it more difficult for Jesus' apostles to do what he commanded\nthem when he said, \"Go and teach all nations\". It is quite clear that Jesus\nwas born during the reign of Augustus, the one who reduced to\nuniformity, so to speak, the many kingdoms on earth so that he had a\nsingle empire. It would have hindered Jesus' teaching from being spread\nthrough the whole world if there had been many kingdoms, not only for\nthe reasons just stated, but also because men everywhere would have\nbeen compelled to do military service and to fight in defence of their own\nland. This used to happen before the times of Augustus and even earlier\nstill when a war was necessary, such as that between the Peloponnesians\nand the Athenians, and similarly in the case of the other nations which\nfought one another. Accordingly, how could this teaching, which\npreaches peace and does not even allow men to take vengeance on their\nenemies, have had any success unless the international situation had\neverywhere been changed and a milder spirit prevailed at the advent of\nJesus? [Origen. Contra Celsum 2.30]\nFor the church father Eusebius writing in the fourth century, it \"was not by mere\nhuman accident\" but \"of God's arrangement\" that the universal empire of peace came in\ntime for the universal religion of peace (Mommsen, 1951, p. 361). Both strove to unify and\npacify the world's peoples:\nTwo great powers sprang up fully as out of one stream and they gave\npeace to all and brought all together to a state of friendship: the Roman\nempire, which from that time appeared as one kingdom, and the power of\nthe Saviour of all, whose aid was at once extended to and established with\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nImmediately after Augustus had established his sole rule, at the time of\nour Saviour's appearance, the rule by the many became abolished among\nthe Romans. And from that time to the present you cannot see, as before,\ncities at war with cities, nor nation fighting with nation, nor life being\nworn away in the confusion of everything.\nThis peace, however, was sustained by violence--a contradiction that Christians\nwished to end. Origen felt that Rome's enemies were better fought through prayer [Contra\nCelsum 8.73]. Arnobius of Sicca thought it preferable to convert them. If everyone lent an\near to Christ's commandments, the terms of peace treaties would be kept unbroken and \"the\nwhole world, long since having diverted the use of iron to more gentle pursuits, would be\npassing its days in the most placid tranquillity and would come together in wholesome\nChristians thus sought to demilitarize the concept of pax, by giving it a meaning\ncloser to the one we now give to \"peace\" (Theissen, 1992).\nChristianization of the Roman State\nThis question would no longer be semantic in the fourth century. In 313,\nChristianity was placed on a par with Roman paganism; then, gradually, it became the sole\nofficial religion. With its newfound power, the Church could now limit State violence.\nThe limits were spelled out by Ambrose, bishop of Milan (374-397). Christians\ncould wage war only if it is defensive in nature, if no unfair advantage is taken of the\nenemy, and if mercy is shown to the defeated. Christians must nonetheless accept the\ninevitability of war with barbarians, who are to be treated as natural enemies (Swift, 1970,\npp. 534-535). In all this, he was restating the concept of \"just war\" that pagan writers had\nearlier formulated.\nNonetheless, these limits now came from a higher spiritual authority that everyone\nhad to obey, including the emperor. Barbarians would also be treated as being one with\nhumankind, \"sprung from the same womb of nature and bound by a single tie of blood\"\n(Swift, 1970, p. 535). They were natural enemies only in a political sense. When the\nVisigoths revolted in 395, they did so not as barbarians but as mistreated foederati and,\nhence, as fellow Romans who deserve fair play.\nMoreover, a true Christian could use violence only to defend others, and not for\nself-defense. This is made clear by Ambrose:\n... a Christian man, a just and a wise man, ought never to try to save his\nown life at the cost of death to someone else. Indeed, even if he\nencounters an armed robber [latronem], he is not at liberty to hit back\nwhen his assailant hits him, lest in his anxiety to defend his own life he\nmar the sense of obligation he ought to feel towards the man. The\nprinciple given to us about this in the gospel records is crystal clear: \"Put\naway your sword: for everyone who strikes with the sword shall perish by\nthe sword.\" Could any robber ever be more loathsome than the persecutor\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nwho had come to slay Christ? Yet Christ would not let anyone defend\nhim by inflicting wounds on those who persecuted him: his desire was to\nFinally, Ambrose felt that the Church should remain aloof from war, however\nwas a radical departure from pagan Rome, where religion had been key to rallying the\npeople for war.\nIt is thus wrong to assume that Christianity ceased to be pacifist when it became the\nofficial religion. As Swift (1970, p. 538) observes, \"if the realities of political and social\ndevelopment prevented Christians from maintaining the pacifist emphases of earlier\ncenturies, pacifist arguments retained much of their old vigor.\" There was likely a range of\nattitudes among Christians, with many interpreting their pacifism broadly. It is perhaps\nsignificant that when the Visigoths invaded Italy in 401 the Roman army responded not by\nconscripting civilians but by enrolling recently defeated barbarians (Liebeschuetz, 1993).\nNor can we assume that this pacifism was limited to the general population and did\nnot penetrate the State administration. Ambrose himself had been governor of Northern\nItaly before becoming Bishop of Milan. Undoubtedly, other functionaries wished to bring\ntheir duties into line with Christian principles. This is apparent in a letter from a Roman\nmagistrate who felt troubled by the death penalty and asked Ambrose for advice. In a long\nreply, the bishop defended this punishment, but then went on to argue that those who\nrefrain from it deserve praise. In fact, most of his reply was an appeal for mercy on the\ngrounds that the wrongdoer may end up repenting (Swift, 1970, p. 542).\nAmbrose openly challenged State violence in 390 when a mob killed a Roman\ngeneral in Thessalonica and thousands were slain in retaliation. The bishop denounced the\nmassacre and forced the emperor, Theodosius I, to do public penance (Lenox-Conyngham,\n2005). Through this gesture, what had once been simply the State's prerogative--its\nmonopoly on violence to ensure its monopoly of power--was raised to a moral principle\nthat constrained not only the common people but also the State itself.\nInterestingly, while Ambrose sought to limit State violence, he did not condemn the\ngrowing wave of violence by Christian individuals against pagan or Jewish places of\nworship. When a mob burned down a synagogue in 388, Theodosius I moved to have the\nwrongdoers punished and the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the local bishop who had\ninstigated the riot. This attempt at restitution was denounced by Ambrose in a long letter\nThe Church thus increasingly became a partner in the making of public policy, a\npartner that seemed to gain strength and vitality as the State declined. This was especially\nso in the western half of the empire, where the barbarian threat would weaken and\nultimately overwhelm the Roman state.\nThe Christianized State and the barbarian threat\nThe fourth century saw many barbarians enter the empire. They were let in largely\nout of expediency: they helped meet the army's manpower needs and it was considered\nbetter to have them as allies on the inside than as enemies on the outside. Although some\nRomans feared the growing barbarian presence, others felt no cause for concern. The late\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\npagan philosopher Themistius wrote in 383 that the Goths of Thrace \"are now converting\nthe iron from their swords and cuirasses into mattocks and scythes.\" These sentiments were\nechoed in 417 by the Christian theologian Orosius: \"the barbarians [in Spain], having\nforsworn their swords, have turned to the plow, and now nurture the surviving Romans as\nDuring the same period, paganism lost all official status after one last clash with\nChristianity: the controversy over the Altar of Victory. \"Victory\" was a Roman goddess\nand incense was burnt at her altar whenever the Senate met. She represented not so much a\ndivine being as a divine principle: the imperative to triumph over all enemies. The altar was\nremoved in the mid-fourth century under Constantius II but then put back by Julian the\nApostate. It was removed a second time, in 382, following an edict that made Christianity\nthe sole official religion. Pagan senators pleaded for its return, arguing that it had helped\nmake Rome a great empire. After the death of Valentinian II (392), the altar was restored\non the condition of being treated as a work of art and not as an idol.\nThis controversy inspired the poet Prudentius to proclaim the true reason for the\nRoman Empire:\nShall I tell you, Roman, what cause it was that so exalted your labours,\nwhat it was that nursed your glory to such a height of fame that it has put\nrein and bridle on the world? God, wishing to bring into partnership\npeoples of different speech and realms of discordant manners, determined\nthat all the civilised world should be harnessed to one ruling power ...\nThe untroubled harmony of human union wins his favour for the world;\nby division it drives Him away, with cruel warfare it makes Him wroth; it\nsatisfies Him with the offering of peace and holds Him fast with quietness\nThe poem portrays the empire as a woman, Roma, who dismisses fears of barbarian\nconquest:\nLet those who din into my ears once more the story of past disasters and\nancient sorrows observe that in your time I suffer such things no longer.\nNo barbarian foe shatters my bars with his spear, nor with strange arms\nand dress and hair goes roving through my captured city, carrying off my\nyoung men to bondage across the Alps.\nThose words were written in 403. Seven years later, the Visigoths entered Rome unopposed\nand sacked the city. The empire then imploded as one barbarian nation after another moved\nin. In 455, Rome was sacked by the Vandals, who likewise entered unopposed after\npromising not to kill anyone. With the return of piracy and brigandage, trade fell off, as did\nfood production and maintenance of roads, ports, and aqueducts. Neither life nor property\nwas safe. Urban life shriveled in the wake of disorder, pandemics, dwindling trade, and\ndisruption of food provisioning. The weakened populace was then hit in the 6th and 7th\ncenturies by plagues that killed three out of ten people (Seccombe, 1992, p. 57). So ended\nthe Pax Romana.\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nDiscussion\nDid Christianity destroy Rome? Or did Rome destroy itself by pacifying its subjects\nwhile more and more unpacified barbarians pressed on its borders? The answer probably\nlies somewhere in-between.\nAll State societies are prone to collapse because their existence depends on the\nState's ability to repress individual and communal violence. Such repression permits a\nhigher level of economic output and ultimately a larger population. It also alters the mix of\nbehavioral genotypes by selecting out aggressiveness and selecting in submissiveness. If,\nhowever, the State falters, there will be a resurgence of both individual and communal\nviolence. On the one hand, the State can no longer hold down the potential for violence that\nstill exists among its citizenry. On the other, it can no longer keep out unpacified\npopulations that lie beyond its borders. This new social environment reduces economic\noutput, thus worsening the initial instability and causing a downward spiral that may spin\nout of control.\nNonetheless, when Rome faltered in the fifth century it did so as never before.\nEarlier, the third century had seen a similar crisis: civil war, foreign invasion, return of\nbrigandage, and steep economic decline. Yet Rome fought its way back and reasserted its\nauthority. There was no such response in the fifth century. Instead, the crisis was met with\na strange mixture of complacency and willful naivet\u00e9.\nWe cannot understand this change without considering the ideology that now\nshaped the Roman worldview, i.e., all humans share the same potential for peaceful and\nsubmissive behavior. This was largely true among the pacified populations inside the\nempire's borders. Outside, it was largely false. Tragically so.\nThe Roman state and genetic pacification\nTable 1.
