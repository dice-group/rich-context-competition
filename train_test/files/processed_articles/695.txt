    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Young adults with disabilities and chronic conditions have high\nuninsurance rates, while Medicaid and Medicare are closed to many of them.\nFederal legislation to allow states to offer Medicaid to employed persons with\ndisabilities has met with an unenthusiastic reaction thus far in the states, with\nfew using the Medicaid options and low enrollment levels even in those states.\nNevertheless, these Medicaid changes do move us toward a more basic solu-\ntion: replacing employability with insurability and dependence on health inter-\nventions as the eligibility standards for public coverage for adults.\nAlarge number of young american adults lack\nhealth insurance: twelve million, or 30 percent of persons\nages nineteen to twenty-nine (twice the rate of uninsurance\namong those ages thirty to sixty-four). Young workers dispropor-\ntionately lack employer-sponsored insurance, and college-based in-\nsurance is rare among persons with low and moderate incomes.\nYoung adults, of course, tend to be healthy as a group. But for young\nadults with disabilities or with chronic illnesses, the lack of health\ninsurance can be devastating.\nPersons with disabilities and chronic conditions often have pri-\nvate or public coverage as children. A large majority of parents of\nadolescents have employer coverage, and the State Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid provides categori-\ncal coverage for poor and near-poor children and for virtually all\nfoster children. However, turning nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one\ncan bring a treacherous transition from parental or public coverage.\nIn this paper I first present previously unpublished data on young\nadults with disabilities and describe the insurance gaps among\nyoung adults with serious chronic illnesses. I then discuss three\nexisting state policies--extensions of Children with Special Health\n\u00a9 2001 Project HOPEThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nEliot Fishman is a senior research associate at the Institute for Medicare Practice, Mount\nSinai School of Medicine, in New York City.\nYOUNG\nADULTS\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Almost all of\nthese programs are tiny, short on outreach, and thus far grossly\ninadequate to the problems that exist. Most states have not imple-\nmented the new Medicaid options, and those that have imple-\nmented them have largely failed to enroll people outside the cash\nassistance system. Even if fully implemented, these expansions would\nnot reach many young adults with serious chronic conditions who\ncannot get private insurance but who are not functionally disabled.\nNevertheless, the halting, incremental adjustments to Medicaid\neligibility described here have begun a move toward a more funda-\nmental solution. The recent Medicaid options have the potential to\nbreak the connection between public coverage and cash assistance\nfor persons with disabilities, just as it has been broken for children\nthrough Medicaid changes in the past fifteen years. That so many\nyoung persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses lack health\ninsurance points to the need to base adults' eligibility for public\ncoverage on the urgency of health needs and insurability, rather than\non lack of employability and receipt of income support. I conclude\nwith some ideas to move policy more firmly in that direction.\nI Data and methods. There have been little analysis or few data\npublished on the insurance status of the young adults discussed\nhere. While the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP)\nand the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) each include de-\ntailed sets of questions on disability and insurance status, this paper\nis the first to publish data on insurance coverage for those ages\nnineteen to twenty-nine with varying levels of disability, using SIPP.\nNo similarly comprehensive and well-defined national survey data\nare available for persons with chronic illnesses, but there is enough\ninformation to indicate enormous gaps in coverage among persons\nwith acute health care needs. To examine the impact of previous\nreforms in coverage policy, I have surveyed program administrators\nin states that have used the new Medicaid options or have extended\nTitle V programs to adults.\nLevels Of Uninsurance\nI Young persons with disabilities. For younger adults (ages\n19\u00ad29) with disabilities, insurance coverage is poor: Almost 22 per-\ncent are uninsured, a proportion much larger than is the case for\nsimilarly disabled children (age eighteen and younger) (Exhibit 1).\nAbout 36 percent have public coverage, and 42 percent have private\ninsurance (Exhibit 2).

About 16 percent lack health\ninsurance (4.4 million persons), even though half of them are em-\nployed.! Of the 9.3 million adults with a long-term disability that\nlimits their ability to work, 15 percent (1.4 million) are uninsured.\nApproximately 40 percent of these more severely disabled unin-\nsured persons manage some employment.\" Adults with disabilities\nwho work but lack health insurance are mostly low income: 30\npercent are poor, and 62 percent make less than 200 percent of the\nfederal poverty level.#\nUninsurance For Persons With Disabilities, By Age And Level Of Disability, 1996\nSOURCE: Survey of Income and Program Participation, 1999.\nPercent uninsured\nAll with disability Severe disability\nSOURCE: Survey of Income and Program Participation, 1999.\nNOTE: Percentages do not add to 100 because of rounding.\nAll with disability\nPrivate\nUninsured\nSevere disability\nPublic\nPrivate\nUninsured\nPublic\nYOUNG\nADULTS\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Private parental\ncoverage covers many more children than young adults because of\nthe limits on most family coverage policies. SCHIP covers children\nonly up to age nineteen. Medicaid has relatively generous coverage\nof children: Most important, it covers all children in households\nwith incomes up to 100 percent of poverty (or much more in many\nstates). Moreover, in states offering coverage for \"Katie Beckett\"\nchildren (the great majority of states), Medicaid covers community-\ndwelling children meeting the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\nstandard for disability regardless of parental income, if they are\nreceiving care that would be provided in an institution. But Medic-\naid coverage of adults with disabilities in almost all states is limited\nto the SSI program and \"medically needy\" options. Finally, the SSI\ndisability standard for children is more liberal in certain respects\nthan that for adults--most explicitly, adults who earn more than\n$700 a month are considered ineligible for SSI as a rule, regardless of\nyear-olds with disabilities applying to continue their previous SSI\ncoverage were turned down; this likely led to the loss of Medicaid\ncoverage for some 35,000 young adults in those two years.$\nI Young persons with chronic illnesses. Many children with\nserious, chronic health conditions depend on Medicaid for their\nhealth coverage. This is so both because poor and near-poor children\nare disproportionately burdened with these conditions, and because\nthe high health expenditures these conditions impose can help fami-\nlies to \"spend down\" to Medicaid eligibility in most states. Yet most\nof these children will not qualify for Medicaid when they turn nine-\nteen. The main path for such coverage, as discussed above, would be\nSSI eligibility. But SSI focuses on employability and functional prob-\nlems rather than serious health problems as such.\nThis is reflected in statistics on children enrolled in Medicaid--\neven those with serious chronic conditions generally get Medicaid\nbecause of their age rather than by qualifying for both Medicaid and\ncash payments through SSI. The prevalence of severe, chronic health\nconditions is three to five times higher among Medicaid-insured\nthan privately insured children.% These conditions include cancer,\ncystic fibrosis, severe asthma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\ninfection, and sickle-cell anemia. However, 74 percent of the chil-\ndren in Medicaid who have a severe medical condition do not re-\nceive SSI, even under SSI's relatively generous eligibility rules for\nchildren, and a similar majority of children in SSI have disabilities\nthat are not severe medical conditions.& SSI eligibility is typically\ndetermined by level of functional loss or, in some cases, medical\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

A medical con-\ndition may be under control and nondisabling yet very expensive to\ntreat.' A 1997 study of Medicaid-enrolled children in California,\nNew York, Georgia, and Michigan found that 2 percent had one of\nthese conditions but were not enrolled in SSI. If this proportion is\nsimilar in other states, about 400,000 of the twenty million children\nenrolled in Medicaid have a serious, chronic health condition but no\nSSI. When these children turn nineteen, they are likely to have\nenormous health costs with no Medicaid eligibility.\nShortfalls In Existing Coverage Policy\nExcept in a handful of states with broad Medicaid waivers, public\ncoverage for nonelderly adults is available only to very low-income\nparents, to those receiving income support by reason of disability\nfrom either Social Security or SSI, or to some of those who gain\nemployment after having received income support for their disabil-\nity. The regulatory definition of disability includes a substantial list\nof serious illnesses, but the illness must be sufficiently advanced to\nconstitute a work disability. The provision of publicly financed\nhealth insurance to persons with disabilities and serious illnesses,\nthen, has traditionally been based upon unemployability. Three ar-\neas of policy that have seen some efforts to change that traditional\nstandard are Medicaid reforms; adult add-ons to Title V programs;\nand regulation of private coverage. None has had much of an impact\nthus far.\nI Medicare and Medicaid eligibility and enrollment. Three\nmillion persons with disabilities ages eighteen to sixty-four received\nMedicare in 1995. People receiving Social Security checks and their\ndependents are eligible for Medicare coverage, including those eligi-\nble for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), although SSDI\nrecipients must wait two years before their Medicare eligibility\nkicks in. Adults with disabilities under age sixty-five can only get\nMedicare through SSDI if they have an employment history but are\nnow disabled, or if they are the dependent child of a Social Security\nbeneficiary. They also must be severely disabled under Social Secu-\nrity rules, meaning that they are not able to work and earn signifi-\ncant income. Nevertheless, former Medicare beneficiaries who begin\nworking can get free Medicare coverage for eight and a half years\nafter returning to work; after that they can take advantage of a\nbuy-in option created by the new Ticket to Work legislation.\nMedicaid is the public alternative for the larger number of young\nadults with disabilities who cannot qualify for Medicare because\nthey never worked and do not have retired parents. About 4.9 mil-\nlion persons with disabilities ages eighteen to sixty-four are in\nYOUNG\nADULTS\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

(Of these Medicaid beneficiaries, 800,000 receive Medi-\ncare as well, meaning that there were 7.1 million disabled Medicaid\nand Medicare beneficiaries ages eighteen to sixty-four in 1995.)\nThey can qualify for Medicaid through SSI if they make less than\n$700 per month in earned income after subtracting certain ex-\npenses, along with some other income and asset restrictions.\nOnce qualified for SSI, young adults can retain Medicaid coverage\neven if they get a job and earn a modest income: Under rules in place\nsince 1980, Medicaid coverage must continue for employed former\nSSI recipients if their income is below state-specific limits. In 2000\nthis provision allowed 83,000 persons with disabilities to receive\nMedicaid after their income disqualified them for SSI; 25,000 were\nage twenty-nine or younger.!\nIn a small number of states, adults with disabilities with higher\nincomes can in principle qualify without ever having been on SSI\nthrough two new, optional Medicaid eligibility categories. One pro-\nvision, passed in 1997, allows states to give Medicaid coverage to\nemployed persons with disabilities earning up to 250 percent of\npoverty who meet the other SSI eligibility standards because of the\nseverity of their impairment.\" A second optional Medicaid exten-\nlaw to become completely open-ended, allowing states to offer\nMedicaid to anyone disabled enough for SSI at whatever income the\nstate chooses. States can even extend coverage to those working\npersons with disabilities whose conditions have improved medi-\ncally to the point that their severe impairment no longer meets the\nSSI standard. The law only loosely restricts cost sharing and premi-\nums. As of August 2001 only fifteen states had implemented one of\nthese optional Medicaid extensions.\nEven in the states that have implemented these two optional\nMedicaid provisions, programs have so far mainly helped those com-\ning off the SSI rolls--that is, those who find jobs after they had been\ndeemed unemployable and thereby gained SSI or SSDI eligibility.\nPartial figures show that almost all of the enrollees in the new pro-\ngrams had already qualified for Medicaid and SSI before they started\nworking (Exhibit 3). All states with information on enrollees indi-\ncate that almost all of them were prior Medicaid beneficiaries, and\nfew have incomes high enough to trigger cost-sharing requirements.\nThis is largely true of those states that have achieved relatively high\ninitial enrollments, with the partial exception of Minnesota. These\nstates have adopted these Medicaid expansions as welfare-to-work\nsupports for SSI beneficiaries rather than as health insurance expan-\nsions.\nI Private insurance.

In-\ndeed, previous SSI enrollment is one of the primary sources of docu-\nmentation that insurers use to determine initial eligibility. Student\ndependent coverage usually ends in the early twenties and requires\na full-time course load that persons with disabilities and chronic\nillnesses often cannot maintain, and persons from low-income fami-\nlies often cannot afford. The other three options--COBRA, high-\nrisk pools and community-rated markets, and HIPAA portability\ncertificates--all involve high premiums, because of adverse selec-\ntion and the lack of employer subsidy. Moreover, the uninsured with\ndisabilities and chronic illnesses are a predominantly low-income\npopulation, with 62 percent of the uninsured with serious disabili-\nties making less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, an\nincome that is not much more than the premium for a community-\nrated policy. Uninsured young adults, if anything, have even lower\nincomes.\nI Condition-specific Title V program extensions. Twenty-one\nstates operate condition-specific coverage programs for adults with\none or more genetic diseases. These are primarily programs for chil-\ndren that use federal Title V block-grant funding (state programs\ndating back to \"Crippled Children's\" programs in the 1920s and\n1930s) that states have extended to adults, generally using state\nfunds. But while most of those programs cover a substantial number\nof children with a wide variety of conditions, adult enrollment is\ntypically limited to those who have one or one of two specific condi-\ntions, and it may be limited as well to those who were enrolled in the\nprogram as a child (because they were ineligible for Medicaid) or to\nthose using specific providers and medical centers (Exhibit 4). Most\nof these program extensions are quite small. Because Title V is a\nblock-grant program, moreover, expansions of Title V programs are\nalmost always with state-only funds, while Medicaid receives an\nopen-ended federal match of 50\u00ad80 percent. If states are going to\nexpand eligibility, it is more likely to be through Medicaid.\nA New Standard For Public Coverage?\nSubstantial employment with significant income generally keeps\npersons with disabilities and chronic illnesses from gaining eligibil-\nity for Medicare and Medicaid, since the disability standard is de-\nfined around inability to work. That keeps many people uninsured\nand also a large number unemployed: The 1994 Harris Survey of\nAmericans with Disabilities found that 31 percent of those who are\nunemployed find loss of health insurance or long-term services to be\na work barrier.$\nYOUNG\nADULTS\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

These states appear to be uncertain what\nstandards to use to enroll working people with disabilities into\nMedicaid. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS,\nformerly HCFA) has clearly stated that enrollees need not go\nthrough the SSI/SSDI disability determination process. The CMS\nhas added, however, that states should enroll those who would be\neligible for SSI except for the fact that they are working. Yet three of\nthe five steps in determining eligibility for SSI have to do with\nunemployment and the inability to work. The CMS, then, has in-\nstructed the states to make Medicaid available to working people\nbased on standards that are supposed to indicate an inability to\nwork. A Connecticut program administrator stated that he has in-\nstructed enrollment officers to use the following broad standard:\n\"People who work through extraordinary efforts even though their\ndisability is substantial enough that they would be justified in not\nworking and collecting SSI are eligible.\" In practice, this apparently\nhas meant enrolling recent SSI beneficiaries.\nWhile the fact that these programs have been enrolling straight\nout of the SSI rolls sidesteps the problem of disability determina-\ntion, it also greatly limits the reach of the federal legislation. The\nvery existence of this definitional problem, however, derives from a\nmore fundamental problem in American health policy, the same\nfundamental problem that leaves so many young people with dis-\nabilities and chronic conditions uninsured: Employability does not\nmean insurability. The unemployability standard is a legacy of\nMedicaid's connection to welfare. But the employer health coverage\nsystem often excludes bad health risks, persons with low incomes,\nand persons in part-time jobs--all characteristics typical of the\nState Health Insurance Programs For Adults With Genetic Disabilities (cont.)\nState/\nprogram name\nAdult\nenrollees\nCoverage\nlimitations\nIncome\nrequirements Funding\nCystic fibrosis (CF) and other rare conditions\nVermont: (no program name) 100 CF only None State-only\nVirginia: Children with\nSpecial Health Care Needs\nhemophilia only\npoverty\nTitle V\nblock grant\nSOURCE: Author's survey of state programs.\nNOTES: Twenty-two states also offer specific programs offering coverage for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), most of\nwhom categorically qualify for Medicare.

First, it ex-\ncludes persons with functional disabilities who can work, but can-\nnot work in a full-time job that offers them coverage. Second, it\nexcludes persons with chronic conditions and illnesses that are ex-\npensive to treat but do not limit or only partly limit their ability to\nwork. Legal, social, and medical advances have allowed more per-\nsons with disabilities and chronic medical conditions to work. But\nbecause of their disability or health condition, their work will often\nbe part time and may not offer benefits, particularly for young per-\nsons in entry-level jobs. Also, the individual and small-employer\nhealth insurance markets are inaccessible to persons with serious\nhealth problems in ways that are difficult to address with market\nregulation.\nIn principle, a loosening of the unemployability standard is all\nthat is needed to reach the first group--those with functional dis-\nabilities who can and should work but whose disability is a strong\nrisk factor for lack of access to jobs with benefits. To reach persons\nwith chronic illnesses, however, focusing on employability is off\ntarget: Their claim on public coverage stems from the urgency of\ntheir health needs and their unattractiveness to private insurers.\nThese criteria ought to be the basis of a new eligibility standard,\nalthough such a standard would need to balance the need to cover\nthe uninsurable against the risk of turning public coverage into an\nall-purpose dumping ground for people who get sick.\nMedicaid may be a poor vehicle to accomplish this change in\neligibility standards. Although Medicaid is a natural choice given its\ncurrent enrollment of persons with disabilities who are not former\nworkers, there is already substantial experience that many states\nwill refuse optional Medicaid expansions, particularly expansions\nto expensive populations. And even if expansions are made manda-\ntory, the means-tested, state-administered Medicaid model has had\ntrouble reaching employed people in many states, as evidenced by\nunderenrollment problems among mothers and children in recent\nMedicaid expansions and SCHIP.\nBoth one-fifth of all young adults with disabilities\nand one-fifth of those with severe disabilities are uninsured.\nClose to half of uninsured persons with disabilities work.
