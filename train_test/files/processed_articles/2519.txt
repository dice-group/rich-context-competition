Interestingly, the effect of psychiatric\ndisorders on the age of onset of suicidal ideation is\ndose dependent, and the effect of multiple psychiatric\ndisorders on suicidal ideation is most pronounced\namong those with low religiosity.[23] Among Blacks, low\neducation, residing in the Midwest, and having one or\nmore psychiatric disorders contribute to increase in risk\nof suicidal attempts.[24]\nAmong Blacks, ethnicity changes the distribution of\nsuicidal behaviors, as AfricanAmericans may attempt\nTaylor et al. studied differences in the association\nbetween certain measures of religiosity and suicidality\namong AfricanAmericans versus Caribbean Blacks.\nFor instance, among Caribbean Blacks, subjective\nreligiosity, looking to God for strength, and comfort and\nguidance were protective against suicidal attempts and\nideation. These associations could not be found among\nAfricanAmericans.[18]\nThis study aimed to investigate if the additive effects of\nsocioeconomic factors, number of psychiatric disorders,\nand subjective religiosity on lifetime serious suicidal\nideation among Blacks vary based on the intersection of\nethnicity and gender.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and participants\nData came from the National Survey of American\nLife (NSAL), which was conducted as a part of the\nCollaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, 2003.\nCaribbean Black adults. The study was funded by\nNational Institute of Mental Health.\nAfricanAmericans were composed of individuals that\nselfidentified as Black, but did not report Caribbean\nancestry. Individuals that selfidentified as Black were\nconsidered Caribbean Blacks, if they met at least one\nof the following criteria: (a) Being of West Indian or\nCaribbean descent, (b) being from a Caribbean country,\nor (c) having parents or grandparents that were born in a\nCaribbean country.[26]\nAfricanAmerican samples, being the largest portion\nof NSAL, were selected from 48 neighboring states\nand included households that contained at least one\nBlack adult. The Caribbean Black sample included\n265 samples that were collected from households within\nthe core sample. The remaining samples were collected\nfrom households within geographic areas that had a high\nCaribbean population.[27] Caribbean Blacks were sampled\nfrom residential areas that reflect the distribution of\nthe AfricanAmerican population and from additional\nmetropolitan areas where Caribbean Blacks composed\nStudy instruments and variables assessment\nAge, education level (less than high school, high school\ngraduate, some college, college graduate), marital status\n(married, previously married, never married), and region\n(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Census regions)\nwere measured as controls. Ethnicity (AfricanAmerican\nand Caribbean Black) and gender were moderators.\nSubjective religiosity\nSubjective religiosity is one of the dimensions of religious\ninvolvement and is defined as the subjective perception\nof and attitude toward religion.[28] It can be measured\nby questions regarding the perceived importance of\nreligion, the role of religious beliefs in one's life, and\none's perception of being religious.[29] This dimension\nis nonbehavioral, as opposed to organizational and\nnonorganizational religiosity.[30,31] Measures of subjective\nreligiosity have been validated using structural equation\nmodeling procedures among Blacks.[30]\nIn this study, subjective religiosity was measured using two\nitems: (1) How religious are you? and (2) How spiritual\nare you? Responses to the first question included: Not\nreligious at all, not too religious, fairly religious, and very\nreligious. Responses to the second question included:\nNot spiritual at all, not too spiritual, fairly spiritual, and\nvery spiritual. The total score varied from 0 to 6 with a\nhigher score indicating higher subjective religiosity.\nPsychiatric disorders\nWorld Mental Health Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview was used to measure number of\nlifetime psychiatric disorders based on the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth\nEdition. Psychiatric disorders were classified as: Mood\ndisorders (i.e., major depressive disorder, dysthymia,\nbipolar I and II disorders); anxiety disorders (i.e., panic\ndisorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, obsessivecompulsive disorder, posttraumatic\nstress disorder); substance use disorders (i.e. alcohol\nabuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse, drug\ndependence); disorders usually diagnosed in childhood\n(i.e. separation anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant\ndisorder, conduct disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder), and eating disorders (i.e., anorexia nervosa,\nbulimia nervosa, bingeeating disorder).[26]\nMain outcome\nLifetime serious suicidal ideation was measured using the\nfollowing single item: Have you ever seriously thought\nabout suicide? Other questions related to suicide were\nStatistical analysis\nTo handle the complex sampling design of the NSAL,\nStata 12.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA) was used for data\nanalysis. We estimated standard errors based on the Taylor\nseries linearization to account for the clustered nature of\nthe data. Subpopulation survey logistic regression was\nused for all inferences. Multicollinearity between the\nindependent variables was ruled out.[32] Odds ratios (OR)\nwith 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. ORs\nlarger than one indicated a positive association between\nexposure and outcome. P < 0.05 were considered\nsignificant. Missing data were not imputed.\nRESULTS\nAmong Blacks, about 44.4% of the participants were\ncriteria for any lifetime psychiatric disorders, 21.8% (95%\nall participants had seriously thought about suicide since\nAmong AfricanAmerican men, perceived religiosity and\nnumber of psychiatric disorders were associated with\nlifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, age, education,\nand country region were not associated with suicidal\nideation [Table 1].\nAmong AfricanAmerican women, age, education, and\nnumber of psychiatric disorders were associated with\nlifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, perceived\nreligiosity and country region were not associated with\nlifetime suicidal ideation [Table 2].\nAmong Caribbean Black men, education, and number of\npsychiatric disorders were associated with lifetime suicidal\nideation. In this group, age, perceived religiosity, and\ncountry region were not associated with lifetime suicidal\nideation [Table 3].\nAmong Caribbean Black women, age, education, and\nnumber of psychiatric disorders were associated with\nlifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, perceived\nreligiosity and country region were not associated with\nlifetime suicidal ideation [Table 4].\nDISCUSSION\nOur study showed that after adjustment for the effect\nof socioeconomic status and number of lifetime\npsychiatric disorders, subjective religiosity protected\nAfricanAmerican men against serious suicidal thoughts.\nSuch an effect was not found among Caribbean Black\nmen or women or AfricanAmerican women.\nAfter controlling the effect of type of psychiatric\ndisorders, Taylor et al. (2011) showed major differences\nbetween AfricanAmericans and Caribbean Blacks for\nthe association between various domains of religiosity\nand suicidal behaviors. Their study showed that some\nindicators of religiosity were negatively associated with\nsuicidal ideation and attempt; however, there were also\npositive associations between some aspects of religiosity\nand suicidality among Caribbean Blacks. Authors\nargued that there is a need for further qualitative and\nquantitative research to understand reasons for the\ndifferences in these associations across ethnic groups.[31]\nIn another study, AfricanAmericans and Caribbean\nBlacks were shown to be very different in additive\neffects of five psychiatric disorders on suicidal ideation.\nAmong AfricanAmericans, major depressive disorder,\nposttraumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse disorder\nwere associated with higher odds of suicidal thoughts,\nwhile among Caribbean Blacks, major depressive disorder\nand drug abuse disorder were associated with higher odds\nof suicidal ideation.[33]\nBased on the current study and also previous\nstudies,[1820,34] the additive effects of risk and protective\nfactors of suicidality of Blacks depend on their ethnicity.\nOur study showed that religiosity is a protective factor\nwith differential effects that depend on the intersection\nof ethnicity and gender. Although multiple psychiatric\ndisorders are always a risk factor, different types of\npsychiatric disorders may contribute to the suicide of\nAfricanAmericans and Caribbean Blacks. This finding\nis beyond the previous knowledge on the main effects of\nethnicity on suicidal ideation among Blacks.[25]\nFindings of the current study shed more light on\nthe complex link between race and ethnicity, gender,\nTable 1: Association between socio-economic status, number of psychiatric disorders, perceived religiosity, and suicidal\nideation among AfricanAmerican men\nOR SE t P 95% CI for OR\nEducation levela\nRegionb\naReference group=Education <12 years, bReference group=Northeast, cReference group=Low.

SE=Standard error, CI=Confidence interval, OR=Odds ratio\nsocioeconomic status, psychiatric disorders, religiosity,\nand suicidal behaviors. Assari had previously shown\nthat the effect of psychiatric disorders among Blacks\nmay be more pronounced among those who report low\nsubjective religiosity. Based on that study, number of\npsychiatric disorders has a dosedependent effect on\nsuicidal ideation, with the highest number of comorbid\npsychiatric disorders having a very strong cumulative\neffect on suicidal ideation.[23]\nAmong Blacks, the effect of psychiatric disorders on the\nage of suicidal ideation may be a doseresponse relation.[23]\nOther studies have also confirmed the doseresponse in\nthe effect of number of psychiatric disorders and suicidal\nbehaviors.[3537] In a study by Kessler et al., number\nof psychiatric disorders was the strongest predictor of\nsuicidal attempt in the population.[38] According to our\nstudy, the effect of each additional psychiatric disorder\non suicidal ideation is highest for Caribbean Black men\n(OR = 6.0) and lowest for Caribbean Black women\nhigher prevalence of suicidal ideation among women.[23]\nGender differences in suicidal thought have been partially\nattributed to social norms and gender expectations.[43]\nCompared to men, women report more suicidal thoughts\nbut do not act on thoughts (low suicidal attempt).[44]\nMost studies, however, have focused on the main effects\nof gender on suicidality,[4547] and our knowledge is very\nlimited on the moderating effect of intersection of gender\nand ethnicity on factors that contribute to suicide.[48]\nGender differences in suicidality have not been explained\nby differential exposure to the risk factors.[49] To test the\ndifferential vulnerability hypothesis based on gender, a\ncontrols and showed that unemployment, retirement,\nbeing single and sickness absence from work were risk\nfactors for men, while having a young child was protective\nfor women. History of hospitalization due to psychiatric\ndisorder was the most strong suicide risk factor among\nboth genders. The magnitude of the association between\nsuicide and psychiatric admission status also differed\nbetween genders.[49]\nBased on our results, programs on screening, diagnosis,\nprevention or treatment of suicidal ideation among\nBlacks may benefit from tailoring based on ethnicity\nand gender.[50] Although screening and treatment of\npsychiatric disorders among Blacks seem crucial across\nall gender and ethnic groups, AfricanAmerican men\nmay need additional evaluation if less religious. Suicidal\nprevention programs may need to reach AfricanAmerican\nmen with multiple psychiatric disorders and low religiosity.\nUniversal diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders\nis, however, essential for all gender and ethnic groups of\nBlacks.\nIn this study, groups based on the intersection of\nethnicity and gender were very different in additive\neffects of known determinants of suicidal ideation. The\nmoderating effect of race, ethnicity, gender, social class,\nand other contextual factors on the associations between\nrisk and protective factors and outcomes has been shown\nfor other risk factors and outcomes.[5162] We, however,\nstill do not know how contextual factors such as gender\nand ethnicity modify the additive effects of a risk and\nprotective factor, even when separate effects of the same\nThis study had a few limitations. Due to the\ncrosssectional design, causative associations are not\nplausible. In addition, as this study relied on selfreports,\nunderreporting of suicidal ideation cannot be ruled out.\nMoreover, ethnic and gender differences in the validity\nof the measures of suicidality and religiosity are not\nknown. In addition, statistical power was not identical\nTable 4: Association between socio-economic status, number of psychiatric disorders, perceived religiosity, and suicidal\nideation among Caribbean Black women\nOR SE t P 95% CI for OR\nEducation levela\nRegionb\naReference group=Education <12 years, bReference group=Northeast, cReference group=Low. SE=Standard error, CI=Confidence interval, OR=Odds ratio\nin different groups of this study. Furthermore, we also\ndid not include any measure of behavioral religiosity.\nFinally, Caribbean Blacks in this study were composed of\na heterogenic group based on nativity and time lived in\nthe USA.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on our findings, while the effect of number\nof psychiatric disorders is constant across ethnic and\ngender groups of Blacks, subjective religiosity may only\nprotect AfricanAmerican men against suicidal ideation.\nSubjective religiosity may not have a protective effect\nabove and beyond number of psychiatric disorders\namong AfricanAmerican women, or Caribbean Black\nmen or women. The direction of the association between\neducation level and suicidal ideation also vary based on\nthe intersection of ethnicity and gender.\nREFERENCES\n1. Nordentoft M.
