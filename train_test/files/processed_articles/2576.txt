Physical attractiveness has a well-established link with earnings and other\ndesirable job-related outcomes [1\u00ad9]. Indeed, one study suggests that the return on attractive-\nness is comparable in magnitude to the return on ability [2]. Studies have also identified effects\nof perceived physical attractiveness on educational outcomes, including teacher's perceptions\nof academic ability, grade point average (GPA), and educational attainment [10\u00ad14].\nAssociations between perceived personality attractiveness and attainments have received far\nless attention than perceived physical attractiveness, and studies report mixed results [10,15].\nAlthough not measuring an attractive personality per se, numerous studies have examined the\neffects of different dimensions of personality on educational and labor market outcomes [16\u00ad\n21]. Some dimensions of personality--especially, in the American context, agreeableness and\nextraversion--likely foster perceptions of an attractive personality. Research has identified\nassociations of agreeableness with GPA and educational attainment [20,22] and of extraversion\nwith job performance and work conditions [20,23]. Of the five dimensions of personality rec-\nognized by the NEO Personality Inventory, conscientiousness is most consistently related to\nindicators of attainment, GPA, earnings, and occupational prestige [22,24\u00ad27].\nThis paper extends this research in four respects. First, the association between attractive-\nness and attainments may vary by parental status such that attractiveness is a resource that\ncompensates for low SES background. That is, the association between attractiveness and\nattained education may be stronger for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Second,\nattractiveness is one potential mechanism by which attainments reproduce across the genera-\ntions. This mediational hypothesis (i.e., parental status ! attractiveness ! attained education)\nstems from the idea that higher status parents have the resources to foster attractiveness in\ntheir children, which in turn evokes more positive assessments from other people (e.g., teachers\nand employers). Third, past studies typically focus on measures of attractiveness at one point\nin time. This study, in contrast, extracts the stable trait component of attractiveness from three\nmeasures spanning the time period from adolescence to young adulthood and thus addresses\nmeasurement error that arises from a reliance on measuring attractiveness at a single time\npoint. Finally, most past studies focus on one dimension of attractiveness--either physical or\npersonality--at a time despite the fact that they are likely correlated (but see [10] for an excep-\ntion). This study simultaneously assesses both physical and personality attractiveness in the\nsame models.\nAttractiveness and Education\nand sign a data-use contract agreeing to keep the\ndata confidential.

The resource substitution hypothesis states that a given psychosocial\nresource will be more beneficial for people who have fewer alternative psychosocial resources.\nFor instance, education influences health moreso among people with less (versus highly) edu-\nIn the present context, perceived attractiveness represents a psychosocial resource that\nfosters educational attainment and may function as an alternate resource when family socio-\neconomic resources are lacking. Youth whose behaviors comport to middle-class expecta-\ntions are known to fare better in classrooms, even with adjustments for intellectual ability\n[32]. Such youth are less disruptive and they constructively contribute to the social dynamics\nof the classroom, which teachers reward both explicitly and implicitly. For example, youth\nwho are competent, goal- driven, and easy to get along with may appear a \"better investment\"\nof a teacher's time than youth who are impulsive and behaviorally challenging [33]. Indeed,\nattractive youth from low status households may be more likely to elicit support from teach-\ners, and these relationships are positively associated with educational continuation [34]. Con-\nsistent with these mechanisms, both perceived physical and personality attractiveness may,\nin part, compensate for some of the disadvantages associated with a poor socioeconomic\nbackground.\nAttractiveness and Intergenerational Status\nParent socioeconomic resources may enhance perceptions of their children's attractiveness via\nseveral mechanisms. First, economic resources could directly influence perceptions of attrac-\ntiveness by enabling children to purchase fashionable clothing and other accoutrements of\nwealth and status. Second, parent socioeconomic resources tend to be associated with adopting\nhealthier lifestyles that in turn may increase perceptions of attractiveness. Parental education\nis associated with knowledge about health and diet, and higher income allows people to buy\nhealthier, fresh foods and to enroll their children in sports camps, gyms, and other activities. In\nturn, children of higher status parents have lower body mass indices and such people tend to\nbe perceived as more attractive [35,36]. Third, parent socioeconomic resources are known to\nbe associated with various dimensions of personality that are likely to be factors in ratings of\nperceived attractiveness [20,37,38]. For instance, one study found that higher levels of parental\neducation are associated with higher ratings of agreeableness, extraversion, and imagination\nand lower ratings of neuroticism among their adult children [20].\nIf perceived attractiveness has a greater effect on educational attainment for people with\nless socioeconomic resources (i.e., moderation) and perceived attractiveness is a mechanism\nthrough which parent socioeconomic resources shape their children's educational attainment\n(i.e., mediation), then a pattern emerges that Ross and Mirowsky refer to as \"structural amplifi-\ncation\" [20,29,39]. In the context of this study, structural amplification refers to the possibility\nthat those youth most likely to benefit from perceived attractiveness will be least likely to be\nperceived as attractive.\nData and Methods\nData for this analysis come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult\nHealth (Add Health). Wave I of Add Health is a nationally representative sample of adoles-\ncents who were enrolled in middle school or high school in 1994. The sample was obtained\nAttractiveness and Education\nby first randomly selecting 80 high schools from a list of all high schools in the United\nStates stratified to ensure adequate representation of different regions, types of schools, eth-\nnic compositions of schools, and study body sizes. The 80 high schools were then paired with\n65 middles schools that fed into their student body. The combined 145 middle and high\nschools hosted an in-school survey that yielded 90,118 student respondents in grades 7\nfor in-depth in-home interviews, which resulted in a sample of 20,745 adolescents at Wave I.\nThe in-home component also included an interview with a parent or caretaker (typically\nthe mother or female head of the household if available). The parent/caretaker interviews\nincluded information about parent socioeconomic resources that is used in the following\nanalyses.\nA second wave of data was collected roughly one year after the first wave and included\nafter the first wave of data. The third wave included 15,197 respondents between the ages of 18\nand 28. Finally, a fourth wave of data was collected roughly 14 years after Wave I. The fourth\nwave included 15,700 respondents between the ages of 24 and 34. Add Health participants pro-\nvided written informed consent for participation in all aspects of Add Health in accordance\nwith the University of North Carolina School of Public Health Institutional Review Board\nguidelines. The University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board has approved the\nresearch reported as part of R01HD061622. Information about obtaining access to Add Health\ndata can be found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth.\nThe analytic sample consists of respondents present in all four waves (N = 10,120). An addi-\ntional seven respondents were dropped who were missing data for sex, race, or educational\nattainment (N = 10,113). Multiple imputation via chained equations was used to address miss-\ning data in the remaining covariates by constructing 10 complete data sets. The number of\ncomplete data sets, 10, was chosen to help ensure stable parameter estimates and standard\nerrors [40]. Most of the covariates had missing data for less than 5 percent of respondents,\nbut parental income was missing for a greater percentage of respondents (22 percent). Diag-\nnostics were performed on the imputed values for parental income and results indicated that\nthe imputed values did not significantly alter the distribution of the measure.\nMeasures\nThe measures of perceived attractiveness come from two items completed by interviewers at\neach wave (we use Waves 1, 2, and 3). The first item is \"how physically attractive is the respon-\ndent?\" and the second item is \"how attractive is the respondent's personality?\" For both items\ninterviewers rated respondents from 1 \"very unattractive\" to 5 \"very attractive.\" For both\ndimensions of attractiveness, ratings averaged between 3 (\"about average\") and 4 (\"attractive\")\nat every wave (see Table 1).\nThe outcome for this analysis is educational attainment measured at Wave IV. Values range\nfrom 1 \"less than high school education\" to 5 \"more than a four-year college degree.\" The\nstudy relies on two measures of parent socioeconomic resources. The first is the highest level of\neducation completed by either parent, coded the same as respondent education. The second is\nlogged family income reported by the parent. Parent education and parent income are both\nobtained from a parent questionnaire. Respondents had an average attainment between some\npostsecondary education and four-year degree while parental education averaged close to some\npostsecondary education (see Table 1). Both respondent education and parental education are\ntreated as continuous measures in the following analyses.\nAttractiveness and Education\nThe models include a number of potential confounders that may be related to parent socio-\neconomic resources and influence both perceived attractiveness and educational attainment.\nThe confounders include sociodemographic measures: the age of respondents at Wave IV, sex,\nrace (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other race), family structure in\nadolescence (two-biological parents, two parents, single mother, single father, and other family\nstructure), and the region of the United States in which the respondent lived in adolescence\n(west, midwest, south, and northeast). Three additional potential confounders capture cogni-\ntive/academic ability and body size: Peabody picture vocabulary test [41], self reported GPA at\nWave I when respondents were in high school, and adolescent BMI.\nStatistical Models\nThe analytic approach relies on extracting the stable components (\"traits\") of perceived physi-\ncal and personality attractiveness by specifying each dimension of attractiveness as a latent var-\niable measured by the three indicators over time. The latent variables for attractiveness are\nthen incorporated into a larger model of predictors of educational attainment. The larger\nmodel allows for the specification of interactions between the latent variables for attractiveness\nand the measures of parent socioeconomic resources. The model without interactions can be\nrepresented by the following system of equations\nedu\ni\n\u00bc a \u00fe b\n\u00f0L phy\u00de\ni\n\u00fe b\n\u00f0L per\u00de\ni\n\u00fe b\npedu\ni\n\u00fe b\npinc\ni\nx\ni\n\u00fe \ni\nphy\nij\n\u00bc a\nphy;j\n\u00fe l\nphy;j\n\u00f0L phy\u00de\ni\n\u00fe d\nphy;j\nper\nij\n\u00bc a\nper;j\n\u00fe l\nper;j\n\u00f0L per\u00de\ni\n\u00fe d\nper;j\nMean Mean\nPhysical attractiveness Personality attractiveness\nOther covariates\nNotes: Means are averages over the 10 complete data sets. Educational attainment and parental education range from 1 \"less than high school\neducation\" to 5 \"more than a four-year college degree.\" All attractiveness measures range from 1 \"very unattractive\" to 5 \"very attractive.\"\nAttractiveness and Education\nwhere i indexes respondents, j indexes waves 1, 2, and 3, edu is respondent's education, L phy\nand L per are latent perceived physical and personality attractiveness respectively, phy and per\nare the measures of perceived physical and personality attractiveness across the three waves,\npedu and pinc are parental education and logged parental income, and x is a vector of addi-\ntional covariates. Interactions between latent attractiveness measures and parent socioeco-\nnomic resources can be included in the first equation.\nThe analysis proceeds in three steps. The first step is to develop a measurement model for\nperceived physical attractiveness and attractive personality. The second step is to specify struc-\ntural equation models that treat the two latent attractiveness variables as mediators in the edu-\ncational attainment model. The third step is to test whether parental education and parental\nincome moderate any effects of attractiveness on educational attainment. Parameters estimated\nbased on the models in the second and third steps allow us to assess our primary research ques-\ntions: (1) whether associations between physical/personality attractiveness and educational\nattainment vary by parental socioeconomic resources and (2) whether parental socioeconomic\nresources are associated with perceived physical and personality attractiveness.\nAuxiliary analyses were conducted to analyze whether the relationships observed in the\noverall sample hold for subgroups defined by sex and race, whether the observed relationships\nheld net of specific personality dimensions, and whether the observed relationships held in a\nsibling subsample. Past studies suggest that standards of attractiveness are more salient for\nwomen than men and that there are also racial and ethnic differences in the assessment of\nattractiveness [42]. Despite these differences, however, empirical studies have generally not\nfound that perceived attractiveness has a greater effect for different demographic subgroups\n[5,13]. Nonetheless, the first auxiliary analysis examines whether the role of perceived attrac-\ntiveness in mediating and/or moderating the link between parent socioeconomic resources and\neducational attainment differs by sex and race/ethnicity.\nThe second auxiliary analysis adds measures of the Big Five personality traits [43] to the\nmodels to help determine whether specific dimensions of personality account for any potential\nrelationship between personality attractiveness and educational attainment. Wave IV of Add\nHealth includes the Mini-IPIP, a 20-item short-form version of the International Personality\nItem Pool that is designed to measure the Big Five factors of personality [44]. These items were\nused to construct scales for agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, imagination, and\nneuroticism.\nThe third auxiliary analysis tests whether associations between perceived attractiveness and\neducational attainment remain after accounting for unobserved family factors that may shape\nboth attractiveness and educational attainment. This analysis leverages the sibling subsample\nof Add Health to specify sibling fixed effects models to address confounding by unobserved\nfamily factors. The sibling subsample consists of 2,766 siblings from 1,383 families with non-\nmissing data for educational attainment. Missing data in the covariates were handled via multi-\nple imputation with chained equations by creating 10 complete data sets. The sibling fixed\neffects model was specified to incorporate latent measures of perceived physical and personal-\nity attractiveness in addition to covariates that vary within sibling pairs (Peabody vocabulary\ntest scores, grade point average, and body mass index) [45].\nThe analyses involve specifying structural equation models in which latent variables (per-\nceived physical and personality attractiveness) interact with observed variables (parental edu-\ncation and log parental income). The numerical procedures for estimating a model involving\nlatent interactions do not permit the inclusion of sample weights [46]. Because of this, the anal-\nyses do not use the Add Health sample weights to adjust for unequal probabilities of inclusion\nand attrition over time. Instead, the analyses rely on including the primary variables that\naccount for the unequal probabilities of inclusion in the sample in the models [47].\nAttractiveness and Education\nThe data were prepared for analysis using Stata v13 [48] and the structural equation models\nwere estimated using Mplus v7 [46]. All of the Stata and Mplus code for the analysis is available\nfor replication and further analysis at a github repository (https://github.com/sbauldry/attr).\nResults\nMeasurement Model for Perceived Attractiveness\nThe first step in the analysis is to develop a measurement model for the two types of perceived\nattractiveness. A natural starting point is a model that specifies a latent variable for perceived\nphysical attractiveness and a latent variable for perceived personality attractiveness each mea-\nsured by their respective indicators across the first three waves of data (Model 1). Interviewers\nmight have a tendency to rate respondents high or low on both physical attractiveness and\nattractive personality at any given wave independent of the trait component of each measure.\nTo capture this possibility, a second model specification allowed the disturbances for physical\nattractiveness and attractive personality to be correlated at each wave (Model 2).\nTable 2 presents model fit statistics and selected parameter estimates for Models 1 and 2.\nThe overall model fit statistics strongly support the model allowing for correlated disturbances\nover the baseline model. Although the chi-square statistic remains significant in Model 2, all of\nthe other measures of model fit suggest that the model is a good fit with the data--the BIC is\nnegative, the CFI and TLI are both close to 1, and the RMSEA is below .05. In addition, the\nTable 2. Measurement Model Fit Statistics and Selected Parameter Estimates (N = 10,113).\nPhysical Personality Physical Personality\nFactor Loadings\n- - - -\nReliabilities\nModel Fit Statistics\nNotes: Model fit statistics and estimates averaged over 10 complete data sets. The factor loadings are unstandardized estimates with 95% confidence\nintervals in brackets. Model 1 is the baseline model. Model 2 allows the disturbances between the indicators for a given wave to be correlated. The factor\nloadings for the Wave 1 indicators for both attractive personality and physical attractiveness are fixed to 1 to identify the model.\nAttractiveness and Education\ncorrelation between latent physical and personality attractiveness is estimated to be 1.31, an\nimpossible value, in Model 1, which is another indication of poor model fit.\nIn Model 2, the Wave 2 and Wave 3 indicators for perceived physical attractiveness and\nattractive personality are strongly associated with their respective latent variables as indicated\nby the factor loadings (the factor loadings for the Wave 1 indicators are fixed to 1 in order to\nidentify the model). The correlation between the two dimensions of perceived attractiveness\n(r = .72) is positive and moderate-to-high in magnitude. Finally, the estimated reliabilities\nreveal that the indicators of attractiveness contain a notable amount of measurement error.\nThe reliabilities at best come close to .4, but are below .1 for the Wave 3 indicators. These low\nreliabilities underscore the importance of extracting the trait components of perceived attrac-\ntiveness from the noisy measures. Thus, the analysis proceeds with the second measurement\nmodel to introduce latent perceived attractiveness into the educational attainment model.\nPerceived Attractiveness and Educational Attainment\nSteps 2 and 3 of the analysis incorporate the measurement model for perceived physical and\npersonality attractiveness into a model for educational attainment and introduce interactions\nbetween the latent dimensions of perceived attractiveness and parent socioeconomic resources.\nTable 3 presents selected parameter estimates from the model incorporating the two dimen-\nsions of perceived attractiveness and from a set of four additional models that add interactions\nbetween the two dimensions of perceived attractiveness and the two measures of parent socio-\neconomic resources (the complete set of parameter estimates is available at the github reposi-\ntory referenced above).\nTable 3. Selected Parameter Estimates from Educational Attainment Models (N = 10,113).\nEducational Attainment\nNotes: Unstandardized estimates with 95% confidence intervals in brackets. R-squares are not available for the models including an interaction with a\nlatent variable. Par edu refers to parent education, par inc refers to parent income (logged), phy refers to latent physical attractiveness, and per refers to\nlatent personality attractiveness.\nAttractiveness and Education\nThe first column of Table 3, labeled M1, reports selected estimates for the predictors of edu-\ncational attainment. As expected, both parental education and logged parental income have\npositive associations with educational attainment (b = .18 and b = .13 respectively). Perceived\npersonality attractiveness also has a positive association with educational attainment (b = .30),\nbut perceived physical attractiveness does not. The size of the personality effect on educational\nattainment, when standardized, is comparable to the effect of parental income, about half the\neffect of parental education, and about a third of the effect of GPA.\nAssociations between other covariates (not shown in Table 3) and educational attainment\nare largely consistent with past studies. Women, people who grew up with both biological\nparents (as compared with other two parent households and single mother households), people\nliving in the Northeast (as compared with people living in the West), and people with more\nfacility with English and cognitive abilities (as indicated by Peabody vocabulary test scores and\nGPA) are all associated with higher levels of education. In addition, people living in the South\nhave slightly lower levels of education than people living in the West.\nModels 2 through 5 introduce the interactions between parent socioeconomic resources and\nthe two dimensions of perceived attractiveness. In the model that includes an interaction term\nbetween parental education and perceived personality attractiveness (M2), the two main\neffects (parental education b = .13, personality attractiveness b = .53) and the interaction effect\n(b = -.07) are all predictors of educational attainment. This pattern of positive main effects and\na negative interaction indicates that the association between perceived personality attractive-\nness and education is reduced at higher levels of parental education (see Fig 1, Panel A). This is\napparent in the steeper slope for personality attractiveness at lower levels of parental education\nthan at higher levels of parental education. In other words, as predicted, perceived personality\nattractiveness has a stronger association with educational attainment at lower levels of parental\neducation.\nFig 1. Response surface plot illustrating interaction of latent perceived attractiveness and parental education on educational\nattainment. Parental education ranges from 1 to 5. The latent dimensions of perceived attractiveness have mean 0 and standard deviations\n.40 and .44 for personality attractiveness and physical attractiveness respectively. The graph thus captures roughly plus/minus 2 standard\ndeviations. The z-axis illustrates how the effect on educational attainment varies across the ranges of perceived attractiveness and parental\neducation based on the parameter estimates reported in Table 3, Models 2 and 3.\nAttractiveness and Education\nModel 3 includes an interaction term between parental education and perceived physical\nattractiveness. In this model, a similar pattern of estimates is observed as found with perceived\npersonality attractiveness: the two main effects are positive (parental education b = .13, physi-\ncal attractiveness b = .25) and the interaction effect is negative (b = -.06). Once again, this\nparticular pattern of effects suggests that the association between perceived physical attractive-\nness and educational attainment is stronger at lower levels of parental education (see Fig 1,\nPanel B).\nModels 4 and 5 introduce interactions between parental income and both dimensions of\nperceived attractiveness. In both models the confidence intervals for the interaction terms over-\nlap 0 and thus there is no evidence that the associations between perceived attractiveness and\neducational attainment vary across different levels of parental income.\nThe last two columns of Table 3 report estimates of the associations of parent socioeco-\nnomic resources with latent perceived personality and physical attractiveness respectively.\nParental education has positive associations with both perceived personality attractiveness\n(b = .02) and perceived physical attractiveness (b = .02). Similarly, logged parental income also\nhas positive associations with both perceived personality attractiveness (b = .03) and perceived\nphysical attractiveness (b = .06). The sizes of the effects are not large, but, when standardized,\nare comparable in magnitude to the effect of BMI on perceived personality attractiveness and\nto about half of the effect of being female on perceived physical attractiveness.\nInterestingly, other positive correlates of each dimension of perceived attractiveness include\nwomen, Hispanics (as compared with whites), and people with more facility with English and\ncognitive abilities (as indicated by Peabody vocabulary test scores and GPA). People with\nhigher BMIs in adolescence are perceived as less physically attractive and as having a less\nattractive personality.\nAuxiliary Analyses: Sex and Race/Ethnicity\nAuxiliary analyses by sex and race/ethnicity were conducted to determine whether the patterns\nobserved in the full sample held among different subgroups. Parameters for the two measure-\nment models for perceived attractiveness outlined above were estimated separately for females\nand males and for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other racial/ethnic groups. For all subgroups\nthe second model fit the data better than the first, and the parameter estimates for the second\nmodel (i.e., the factor loadings, correlation between the two latent dimensions of attractiveness,\nand the reliabilities of the indicators) were similar to the overall measurement model. There-\nfore, the second measurement model specification that allowed correlated disturbances\nbetween the indicators of physical and personality attractiveness at each given wave was used\nfor all subgroups.\nSeparate models by sex revealed a similar pattern of results as observed in the full sample\n(results available at the github repository referenced above). Parental education, parental\nincome, and perceived personality attractiveness have associations with educational attainment\nfor both females and males. The interactions between parental education and perceived per-\nsonality attractiveness and between parental income and perceived personality attractiveness\nexhibit the same pattern of positive main effects and negative interaction effect, but they are\nonly statistically significant among females. Finally, parental education and parental income\nhave positive associations with both dimensions of perceived attractiveness for females and\nmales; however, the confidence interval for the association between parental education and\nperceived physical attractiveness among females includes 0.\nSeparate models by race/ethnicity also reveal a similar pattern of results as observed in the\nfull sample, though with fewer statistically significant associations (results available at the\nAttractiveness and Education\ngithub repository referenced above). Parental education, parental income, and perceived per-\nsonality attractiveness all have positive associations with educational attainment among every\nracial/ethnic group with the one exception of parental income among Hispanics. In the models\nincluding interactions between parent socioeconomic resources and perceived attractiveness,\nthe only interaction is between perceived physical attractiveness and parental education among\nHispanics. For all racial/ethnic groups, however, the pattern of positive main effects for parent\nsocioeconomic resources and perceived personality attractiveness and a negative interaction\nremains. Furthermore, the estimates for the associations between parental socioeconomic\nresources and perceived attractiveness are all similar in magnitude to the estimates in the full\nsample, though some are not statistically significant.\nThese results indicate that the role of perceived attractiveness in the link between parent\nsocioeconomic resources and educational attainment operates similarly among females and\nmales and among whites, blacks, Hispanic, and other races. The reduced statistical power from\nconsidering members of each group separately renders some of the associations non-signifi-\ncant, but there is no evidence that perceived attractiveness plays a different role in the educa-\ntional attainment process by sex or race/ethnicity.\nAuxiliary Analysis: Big Five Dimensions of Personality\nThe second auxiliary analysis examined whether including the Big Five dimensions of person-\nality (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, imagination, and neuroticism) in the\nmodel attenuated the association between personality attractiveness and educational attain-\nment and/or altered the pattern of resource substitution. Adjusting for the specific dimensions\nof personality attenuates the effect of personality attractiveness on educational attainment by\n27 percent (b = .30 in primary analysis and b = .22 in auxiliary analysis), but an association\nbetween personality attractiveness and educational attainment remains. In addition, the inclu-\nsion of the Big Five dimensions of personality does not alter the pattern of resource substitution\ndescribed above.\nAuxiliary Analysis: Sibling Fixed Effects\nThe third auxiliary analysis relies on sibling fixed effects models to test whether associations\nbetween perceived attractiveness and educational attainment remain once one accounts for\nfamily-level unobserved confounders. In fact, both latent personality attractiveness (b = .32)\nand latent perceived attractiveness (b = .41) maintain positive associations with educational\nattainment net of Peabody vocabulary test scores, grade point average, and body mass index at\nwave 1. Thus the relationship between perceived attractiveness and educational attainment\ndoes not appear to be substantially affected by unobserved family level confounders.\nDiscussion\nDetailed understanding of the intergenerational reproduction of status and mobility is of criti-\ncal importance given recent trends in American society that document growing inequality.\nHow do the children of less well-educated parents \"get ahead?\" Evidence shows that achieve-\nment is not solely based on relevant merits. Yet the extent to which other forms of capital\ncontribute to status is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine (1)\nwhether the association between attractiveness and educational attainment varies by parent\nsocioeconomic resources and (2) whether parent socioeconomic resources are associated with\nattractiveness.\nWith respect to the first research question, the results suggest that both perceived personal-\nity and physical attractiveness have stronger associations with educational attainment for\nAttractiveness and Education\npeople coming from families with low levels of parental education. In other words, perceived\nattractiveness may compensate for other background disadvantages with respect to educational\nattainment, but people from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to be perceived as\nattractive. This pattern of results extends the resource substitution with structural amplification\ntheory developed by Ross and Mirowsky beyond health outcomes to the status attainment pro-\ncess and non-cognitive traits.\nThe results also indicate that perceived personality attractiveness has a positive association\nwith educational attainment. This finding suggests that past studies that have focused exclu-\nsively on physical attractiveness appear to be missing the more important dimension of person-\nality attractiveness, which reflects factors other than the Big Five personality dimensions.\nGiven the excellent content validity of the Big Five, the issue for future research becomes what,\nbeyond the Big Five, makes people's personality attractive? Plausible candidates include inter-\npersonal warmth, body language (e.g., eye contact), cooperativeness, and motivational charac-\nteristics. Yet plausible candidates must contend with the fact that our measure of \"personality\nattractiveness\" reflected an impression that the respondent made on the interviewer during a\nshort visit.\nAdditionally, most past studies have not addressed measurement error in the indicators of\nattractiveness, and thus past findings of physical attractiveness may be biased. Given the nota-\nble magnitude of measurement error that we observe, reliance on state-based measures may be\nhighly misleading. It is often asserted that measurement error leads to attenuation of effects,\nbut this is only true in bivariate analyses. In analyses involving numerous covariates, particu-\nlarly covariates that may also contain non-negligible measurement error, the bias can be in any\nWith respect to the second research question, the results indicate that parent socioeconomic\nresources have a small association with both dimensions of perceived attractiveness. Nonethe-\nless, the magnitudes of the associations are roughly comparable with the associations between\nBMI and perceived personality attractiveness and about half of the gap between females and\nmales in perceived physical attractiveness.\nWhy do these forms of attractiveness matter for attainment? Prior research suggests that\nattractive students may elicit attention from teachers and coaches and unrelated adult mentors\n[34]. Yet the mechanisms are not known and deserve further attention, particularly to inform\ninterventions to assist educators.\nLimitations\nOne important limitation of this study is that estimates should not be interpreted as causal\neffects. Although the study is able to incorporate a wide array of potential confounders, includ-\ning two measures of ability and adolescent body size, and the relationships between perceived\nattractiveness and educational attainment remain once one adjusts for unobserved family-level\nconfounders, additional unmeasured within-family confounders could influence parent socio-\neconomic resources, perceived attractiveness, and educational attainment.\nAn additional limitation of this study is that there is only a single rating of attractiveness for\neach respondent within a given wave. Ideally, the data would have included multiple interview-\ners' ratings of the physical and personality attractiveness of each respondent at each wave. Such\ninformation would have allowed for an assessment of the within-wave reliability of the attrac-\ntiveness measures. Lacking these data, analyses cannot correct for the potential systematic bias\nin some interviewers' assessments of attractiveness at each wave. This limitation is one reason,\nhowever, why we chose to focus on attractiveness across waves as the longitudinally-defined\nAttractiveness and Education\ntrait helps to counter systematically over- or under-rated attractiveness at any given wave,\nespecially given that interviewers differed across waves.\nConclusions\nDrawing on nationally representative data, trait-based measures of attractiveness, and an engag-\ning conceptual model, our paper suggests that, in contrast to students from higher class house-\nholds, attractiveness promotes educational attainment moreso among students from lower class\nbackgrounds, but that these same students are less likely to be judged attractive. This moderat-\ning pattern reflects \"resource substitution,\" and there is now mounting evidence that diverse\nforms of capital--social, psychological, physical, financial--may be interchangeable.\nThe potential interchangeability of different forms of capital opens important avenues for\nfuture work on the reproduction of inequality. Precisely how these forms of capital \"substitute\"\nfor one and other and translate into \"value\" in the classroom is not well understood and should\nbe the subject of further investigation. Such knowledge would not only improve our under-\nstanding of the contours of social stratification but could also have practical implications in\nhelping teachers foster learning in students from diverse backgrounds and with diverse constel-\nlations of capital.\n"
