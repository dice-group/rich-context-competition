Design and\nMethods: Analyses are based on the Changing\nLives of Older Couples, a prospective study of 1,532\nmarried individuals aged 65 years and older. The ana-\nlytic sample includes 148 widowed persons who have\nat least one living child and participated in the base-\nline and two follow-up interviews conducted 6 and\n18 months following widowhood. Results: The\nanalyses revealed that higher levels of positive sup-\nport from children 6 months following widowhood\nwere associated with fewer depressive symptoms at\nthe 18-month follow-up, whereas higher levels of\nnegative support 18 months after loss and a decrease\nin positive support following loss were associated\nwith more depressive symptoms. Greater negative\nsupport both prior to and after loss was associated\nwith greater anxiety, whereas greater negative\nsupport 6 months after loss and an increase in neg-\native support following loss were related to greater\nanger. Implications: Given their differential im-\npact on widowed persons' psychological adjustment,\nboth positive and negative aspects of social support\nas well as its changing nature should be considered\nin working with bereaved older adults.\nKey Words: Spousal bereavement, Grief, Negative\nsocial interactions, Intergenerational relationship\nAlthough widowhood is an extremely stressful\nlife event (M. S. Stroebe, Hansson, Stroebe, &\nSchut, 2001), clinical studies note significant varia-\ntions among widowed individuals in their capacity\nto cope with the distress of widowhood. Although\nmost people recover from major depression within\n1 year after losing a spouse, some people experi-\nence prolonged depressive and grief symptoms\nover an extended period (Beem, Maes, Cleiren,\nSchut, & Garssen, 2000; Onrust & Cuijpers,\nIn search of a social mechanism that explains\nthis variation, many studies have examined the\nrole of social support in adaptation to widowhood\n(Norris & Murrell, 1990; Silverstein & Bengtson,\n1994; W. Stroebe, Stroebe, Abakoumkin, & Schut,\nBaarsen, 2002). In particular, much research has\ninvestigated whether preexisting social support\nprotects (i.e., buffers) one from experiencing severe\npsychological outcomes upon spousal loss (Norris &\nMurrell; W. Stroebe et al., 1996) and whether\nsocial support accelerates recovery from distress\n(W. Stroebe et al., 2005). However, few studies\nhave explored how changes in social relationships\nThe Effects of Positive and Negative Support\nFrom Children on Widowed Older Adults'\nPsychological Adjustment: A Longitudinal\nAnalysis\nJung-Hwa Ha, PhD*,1\n1School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, Illinois.\n*Address correspondence to Jung-Hwa Ha, PhD, School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, 969 E. 60th Street, Chicago, IL\nDecision Editor: William J. McAuley, PhD\nThe Gerontologist\nfollowing widowhood, especially in terms of nega-\ntive social interactions, influence widowed persons'\npsychological adjustment.\nThe purpose of this article was to examine the\nextent to which widowed older adults' positive\nand negative support from adult children influence\ntheir coping with depressive and grief-related\nsymptoms (i.e., anxiety and anger) over the course\nof bereavement. Particular attention is given to\ntwo important issues that are not sufficiently ad-\ndressed in the previous literature: (a) longitudinal\neffects of positive and negative support and (b) im-\nplications of changes in positive and negative sup-\nport following widowhood. In the following\nsection, I elaborate on these overlooked issues and\nreview relevant literature.\nEffect of Positive and Negative Support on\nWidowed Persons' Psychological Adjustment\nThe first objective of this article is to investigate\nboth the concurrent and the lagged effects of\npositive and negative support from children on\nwidowed older adults' psychological adjustment.\nPrevious research suggests that close social relation-\nships, such as parent\u00adchild relationships, consist of\nnot only positive but also negative social exchanges\n(Akiyama, Antonucci, Takahashi, & Langfahl, 2003;\nBirditt, Miller, Fingerman, & Lefkowitz, 2009).\nA significant body of literature also suggests that\nthese two aspects of social support are not at\nopposite ends of the spectrum (Rook, 1984) and\nthat each aspect has a distinct impact on older\nadults' well-being (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, &\nPositive and negative support can exert unique\ninfluences on widowed persons' psychological ad-\njustment as well. On the one hand, positive sup-\nport from children can help older adults better\ncope with the loss through decreased feelings of\nloneliness and isolation (Rook, 1984). On the oth-\ner hand, negative support, such as demands and\ncriticism, can create the feelings of unhappiness\nand ambivalence toward children among widowed\nparents (Talbott, 1990), which may lead to in-\ncreased psychological distress.\nIn the past two decades, a growing body of\nliterature has examined how positive and nega-\ntive aspects of social relationships differentially\naffect psychological well-being. Some of the key\nfindings of this literature are that negative aspects\nof social relationships, in general, have more po-\ntent effects than positive social relationships on\npsychological well-being (Newsom, Nishishiba,\nMorgan, & Rook, 2003; Schuster, Kessler, &\nAseltine, 1990) and that negative exchanges are\nmore distressing for people who have experi-\nenced many life events (Ingersoll-Dayton et al.,\n1997). However, very few studies have investi-\ngated this issue specifically among widowed older\nadults, and most of the existing studies are based\non cross-sectional data.\nAmong the studies that focus on widowed older\nadults, a cross-sectional study found that negative\nsocial interactions have a more potent effect than\ndo positive interactions on the life satisfaction of\nolder widows (Rook, 1984). In terms of loneliness,\nhowever, this study found that positive interac-\ntions exerted a stronger influence than negative\nones, suggesting that positive and negative social\nsupport may have a differential impact depending\non the outcome.\nAmong the studies that use samples drawn from\nthe general population, a handful of studies have\nexamined how the effects of positive and negative\nsupport change over time using longitudinal data.\nBased on a sample of community-dwelling older\nadults, Finch and Zautra (1992) found that in pre-\ndicting concurrent depression, both positive and\nnegative support were significant. However, in\npredicting depression assessed 1 month later, they\nfound only negative support was significant. In an-\nother longitudinal study of older adults, Newsom,\nMahan, and Rook (2008)) found that stable nega-\ntive social exchanges have a significant negative\nimpact on physical health outcomes both concur-\nrently and 2 years later. However, they did not ex-\namine the relative effects of positive versus negative\nsocial exchanges on health.\nDespite growing utilization of longitudinal data\nin examining the impact of positive and negative\nsupport, no study has yet specifically investigated\nthe extent to which positive and negative support\nfrom children both prior to and after spousal loss\naffect widowed persons' ability to cope with the\ndistress of losing a spouse over time. With cross-\nsectional data, we cannot exclude the possibility of\na reverse causation--that initial levels of psycho-\nlogical distress among widowed older adults may\nhave led to greater negativity in social relation-\nships, rather than vice versa (Newsom et al., 2003;\nRook, 1997). Thus, by using prospective data on\nbereavement, the current study aims to enhance\nthe understanding of the longitudinal associations\nof positive and negative support from children with\nwidowed older adults' psychological adaptation.\nSpecifically, two hypotheses are proposed. First,\nconsistent with the findings from previous litera-\nture (Newsom et al., 2003), it is hypothesized that\nhigher levels of positive and lower levels of nega-\ntive support from adult children will be associated\nwith lower psychological distress among older\nwidowed persons both concurrently and in the\nlong term. Second, given previous findings that\nnegative exchanges are especially detrimental\nwhen individuals are experiencing multiple stresses\n(Ingersoll-Dayton et al., 1997), it is hypothesized\nthat negative support from adult children will exert\na greater influence on widowed persons' psycho-\nlogical adjustment than will positive support.\nEffects of Changes in Social Support Following\nSpousal Loss\nAnother important gap in the current literature\non positive and negative support is that previous\nresearch has rarely paid attention to the implica-\ntions of the changing nature of social relation-\nships during a stressful life transition. Even in the\nvast literature focusing on the beneficial effects of\nsocial support, most previous studies have exam-\nined how preexisting or currently existing social\nsupport protects widowed persons from experi-\nencing severe psychological outcomes, without\nconsidering the effect of changes in social support\nfollowing spousal loss (Wethington & Kessler,\nOne reason for this dearth of research focusing\non the impact of changes in social support may be\nthat researchers have conceptualized social sup-\nport as a resource that remains stable over time.\nIn fact, much theoretical and empirical work in\nprevious literature suggests that people maintain a\nstable network of close social relationships\n(Carstensen, 1992) from which they can draw\nsupport. However, the quality of social relation-\nships may change during times of stressful life\ntransitions (Guiaux, van Tilburg, & van Groenou,\nimpact on the psychological well-being of older\nadults.\nResearch has shown that, shortly after widow-\nhood, older adults experience an increase in posi-\ntive and a decrease in negative support from\nchildren (Ha & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2008). Further-\nmore, bereaved older adults use strategies such as\nrevitalization of old social ties and development of\nnew ties to compensate for their loss (Zettel &\nRook, 2004). However, few studies have looked\ninto the implications of these changes in social re-\nlationships. Zettel and Rook note that older adults'\nsubstitution of social ties following widowhood\ndoes not necessarily lead to better psychological\nwell-being. However, to date, no study has fol-\nlowed this line of research to examine whether or\nhow positive and negative support from adult\nchildren affect widowed persons' psychological\noutcomes.\nGiven that the parent\u00adchild relationship is one\nof the most enduring relationships of all, under-\nstanding the ways in which changes in relation-\nships with children following spousal loss influence\nolder adults' psychological well-being is critical.\nThe different ways that children respond to spou-\nsal loss and how widowed persons perceive these\nresponses may have important implications for\nwidowed persons' psychological adjustment. Thus,\nthe current study examines the effect of changes in\nsupport from children on widowed parents' psy-\nchological outcomes. It is hypothesized that those\nwho experienced an increase in positive support\nand a decrease in negative support 6 months fol-\nlowing widowhood will show lower psychological\ndistress 18 months after spousal loss. On the\nother hand, those who experienced a decrease in\npositive support and an increase in negative sup-\nport will show greater psychological distress at\nthe 18-month follow-up.\nMethods\nSample\nAnalyses are based on data from the Changing\nLives of Older Couples (CLOC; Carr & Utz, 2002),\na prospective study of a two-stage area probability\nsample of 1,532 married men and women from the\nDetroit area. To be eligible for the study, respon-\ndents had to be English-speaking members of a\nmarried couple in which the husband was aged 65\nyears or older. Sample members were community\ndwelling and were capable of participating in a\n2-hr face-to-face interview. Baseline interviews\nwere conducted between June 1987 and April\nticipated in the interview.\nAfter baseline interviews, CLOC researchers\nmonitored spousal loss by reading the daily obitu-\naries in three Detroit-area newspapers and by using\nmonthly death records provided by the state of\nMichigan. The National Death Index was used to\nconfirm the deaths and obtain the causes of death.\nOf the 319 respondents who lost a spouse during\nThe Gerontologist\none of the follow-up interviews conducted 6 months\n(Wave 3) after the death. The primary reasons for\nnonresponse were refusal to participate (38%) and\nill-health or death at follow-up (42%).\nThe analytic sample of this article focuses on\n148 widowed persons who participated in the\nWave 1 and the Wave 2 interviews and had at least\none living child. This sample comprises approxi-\nmately 65.7% of all widowed persons who par-\nticipated either in the Wave 1 or in the Wave 2\nparticipated in the Wave 1 interview only and 14\npeople participated in the Wave 2 interview only.\nAttrition analysis showed that respondents who\nare older, have greater functional difficulty, and\nare more depressed at Wave 1 showed lower pro-\npensity to participate in the Wave 2 interview,\ngiven participation in the Wave 1 interview (t-test\nresults were significant at a = .05). For this reason,\nfindings may not be generalizable to the oldest old\nor widowed persons with severe functional diffi-\nculty or depressive symptoms. Also, the attrition\nof those who are severely depressed at Wave 1 may\nlessen the variability in depressive symptoms\namong the resulting sample and thus reduce the\npower to detect the effects of positive and negative\nsupport on depressive symptoms at Wave 2. Data\nfrom Wave 3 interviews were not included because\nonly 83 widowed respondents participated in all\nthree follow-up interviews. The sample sizes are\nweighted to account for nonresponse and different\nprobabilities of selection.\nMeasures\nDependent Variables.--One general (depressive\nsymptoms) and two grief-related symptoms (anger\nand anxiety) are used as dependent variables. The\ndepressive symptoms variable at Wave 2 (a = .81)\nconsists of a subset of 11 (9 negative and 2 posi-\ntive) items from the 20-item Center for Epidemio-\nlogical Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale (Radloff,\n1977). The scale is standardized on the mean and\nstandard deviation of the baseline sample. Higher\nscores reflect more depressive symptoms. Anxiety\nat Wave 2 (a = .71) was assessed with the fol-\nlowing three items: (a) afraid of what is ahead,\n(b) felt anxious or unsettled, and (c) worried\nabout how you would manage your day-to-day\naffairs. Anger at Wave 2 (a = .68) was assessed\nwith the following three items: (a) felt resentful\nor bitter about your spouse's death, (b) felt that\nthe death of your spouse was unfair, and (c) felt\nanger toward God. Both anxiety and anger as-\nsessed grief symptoms during the past month\nand response categories included (a) no, never;\n(b) yes, but rarely; (c) yes, sometimes; and (d) yes,\noften. Higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety\nand anger.\nIndependent Variables.--The analysis controls\nfor depressive symptoms, anxiety, and anger at\nWave 1 in order to capture changes between Wave\n1 and Wave 2. These measures are assessed with\nthe same items as at Wave 2.\n\"Positive support from children\" (a = .70 at\nbaseline) is assessed with the following questions:\n\"How much do your children make you feel\nloved and cared for?\" and \"How much are they\nwilling to listen when you need to talk about\nyour worries or problems?\" Response categories\nare a great deal, quite a bit, some, a little, and\nnot at all. The scale is standardized based on the\nmean and standard deviation of the baseline\nsample. Higher scores indicate greater positive\nsupport.\n\"Negative support from children\" (a = .48 at\nbaseline) is assessed with the following questions:\n\"How much do you feel they make too many de-\nmands on you?\" and \"How much are they critical\nof you or what you do?\" Response categories are\nthe same as the positive support items. The scale is\nstandardized, and higher scores indicate greater\nnegative support. The measures of positive and\nnegative support are assessed at baseline, Wave 1,\nand Wave 2 using the same questions.\nThe measure of negative support from children\nhas low reliability, likely due to the fact that the\nscale tries to capture diverse aspects of negative so-\ncial interactions (e.g., being critical and demand-\ning) in one measure, resulting in low internal\nconsistency reliability. In order to address this is-\nsue, I conducted a supplementary analysis with in-\ndividual components of this scale (i.e., demands\nand criticism). This result is summarized in the\nDiscussion section. Although a low reliability\nmakes it harder to detect the significant relation-\nship between independent and dependent variables\nby attenuating the correlations between them, the\nbroader range of content may increase the validity\nof the measure in covering various dimensions of\nsocial support. Thus, a composite scale is used in\nthe main analysis.\n\"Changes in positive and negative support\" from\nbaseline (prior to loss) to the Wave 1 (6-month\nfollow-up) interview are assessed first by subtract-\ning the Wave 1 support score from the baseline sup-\nport score (unstandardized scores are used for this\ncalculation). Then, two dummy variables are cre-\nated to capture those who experienced an increase\nin support and those who experienced a decrease in\nsupport. The reference category includes those who\ndid not experience any changes in positive and neg-\nativesupport,respectively(i.e.,baselinescore-Wave\n1 score = 0). Changes in positive and negative sup-\nport from the Wave 1 (6-month follow-up) inter-\nview to the Wave 2 (18-month follow-up) interview\nare also considered in the preliminary analyses but\nnone of these indicators showed significant effects.\nThus, these results are not reported in this article\n(results are available from the author).\nConfounding Factors.--The analysis controlled\nfor four possible confounding factors (i.e., sudden-\nness of death, coresidence status of children, atten-\ndance at religious services, and functional\nlimitations) that are closely linked to psychological\nadaptation to loss (Brown, Nesse, House, & Utz,\nness of death is a dichotomous variable where 1\nindicates that the spouse's death occurred either\ndue to accident, murder, or suicide or the respon-\ndent did not have any forewarning about the death\nand 0 indicates that the respondent had a fore-\nwarning about the death. Presence of a coresident\nchild(ren) at Wave 2 is a dichotomous variable\nwhere 1 indicates that the respondent has a coresi-\ndent child and 0 indicates that the respondent\ndoes not have any coresident child. Attendance at\nreligious services at Wave 2 assesses how often\nthe respondent usually attends religious services.\nResponses ranged from 1 = never to 5 = more than\nonce a week, and a standardized measure of this\nvariable is used in the analysis. Functional difficulty\nat Wave 2 (a = .77) is a four-item scale indicating\nhow much difficulty the respondent has (a) bath-\ning by oneself, (b) climbing a few flights of stairs, (c)\nwalking several blocks, and (d) doing heavy house-\nwork. Response categories are a little, some, a lot,\nand cannot do. The scale is standardized, and higher\nscores indicate higher levels of functional difficulty.\nControl Variables.--Additionally, the analyses\ncontrolled for two demographic variables--race\n(1 = White and 0 = Black) and education (in years)--\nthat have been found to be related to positive and\nnegative support (Lincoln, Chatters, & Taylor,\ndent's age, gender, and number of children are con-\nsidered in the preliminary analyses but are dropped\nin the final models because they were not signifi-\ncantly associated with the outcomes and also did\nnot influence the association between support from\nchildren and psychological well-being. Descriptive\nstatistics for these variables are provided in Table\n1. Finally, the duration (in months) between the\nbaseline and follow-up interviews is controlled.\nAnalytic Plan\nFirst, descriptive statistics of the variables will\nbe presented. Next, ordinary least squares (OLS)\nregression models are used to examine the concur-\nrent and lagged effects of positive and negative\nsupport on depressive and grief symptoms assessed\n18 months after spousal loss. Finally, OLS regres-\nsion models are used to examine the effects of\nchanges in positive and negative support.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics of the ana-\nlytic sample. Means and standard deviations of the\nmeasures included in the analyses and of addition-\nal demographic variables are presented. The mean\nlevel of depressive symptoms increases at Wave 1\n(6-month follow-up) and then decreases at Wave 2\n(18-month follow-up), suggesting that on average,\nwidowed persons experienced more depressive\nsymptoms 6 months following widowhood but\nthis elevated level of depressive symptoms subsides\nover time. A decrease in the mean CES-D score\nfrom Wave 1 to Wave 2 could reflect either recov-\nery or selective attrition. Widowed persons may\nexperience fewer depressive symptoms at Wave 2\nbecause they recovered from intense grief; however,\nit is also possible that those who remain severely\ndepressed at the Wave 2 interviews are more likely\nto drop out of the sample, thus lowering the average\nCES-D score. Anxiety and anger remained at simi-\nlar levels at Wave 1 and Wave 2. Measures of anx-\niety and anger were not assessed at baseline (prior\nto loss) and thus are not presented in the table.\nOn average, levels of positive support in-\ncreased from baseline to Wave 1, whereas levels\nof negative support decreased from baseline to\nWave 1. In terms of demographic characteristics,\nThe Gerontologist\nthe sample consists of predominantly White women,\nwith women comprising 71% and White subjects\ncomprising 88% of the sample. The average age\nof respondents at Wave 2 was about 73 years.\nOther characteristics of the sample are also de-\nscribed in the table.\nTable 2 shows the percentage of respondents\nwho experienced an increase, no change, and a\nTable 2.

The results show that com-\npared with those who did not experience any\nchange in positive support, those who experienced\na decrease in positive support show higher levels of\nin negative support did not have any significant\ninfluence on depressive symptoms. Anxiety was\nnot significantly influenced by changes in either\npositive or negative support. In terms of anger,\nthose who experienced an increase in negative\nsupport showed higher levels of anger (b = .33,\np = .008). The effects of control variables were sim-\nilar to the results shown in Table 3.\nBecause including both the baseline and the\nchange measure of support can create a multicol-\nlinearity problem, in a supplementary analysis, I\nalso examined models without the baseline mea-\nsure of support as a control variable. Omitting the\nbaseline measure, however, did not significantly\nchange the result and the effects of changes in pos-\nitive and negative support in these models were\nsimilar to the ones reported earlier (results are not\nshown but available from the author).\nDiscussion\nSummary of Findings\nThis study extends our understanding of the\nrelationship between different aspects of social\nsupport and widowed older adults' psychological\nadjustment in three ways. First, the findings from\nthe current study provided partial support for the\nproposed hypotheses that there will be a significant\nassociation between positive and negative support\nand psychological outcomes and that negative\nsupport will have a more potent effect than posi-\ntive support. The relative impact of positive and\nnegative support differed depending on the out-\ncomes, but in general, negative support appeared\nto have a greater impact than positive support.\nSpecifically, higher levels of children's positive\nsupport at Wave 1 were associated with fewer\ndepressive symptoms at Wave 2; otherwise, the ef-\nfects of positive support on psychological outcomes\nwere minimal. On the other hand, the effects of\nnegative support were notable across different\noutcomes, although the significance of these ef-\nfects depended on the timing of negative support.\nIn the case of anxiety, negative support at all waves\nwas significantly associated with higher levels of\nanxiety.\nIn interpreting these findings, however, we\nshould be cautious about the possibility of a Type\nII error. That is, given the small sample size of this\nstudy, the lack of significant association between\npositive support and grief symptoms may be due\nto the lack of power or a measurement error. Fu-\nture studies should build upon this study and ex-\namine more thoroughly how different aspects of\nsocial support (e.g., positive and negative support)\naffect grief-related psychological functioning and\ninvestigate the mechanisms by which social sup-\nport affects older adults' psychological adjustment\nupon spousal loss using a bigger sample. Further-\nmore, future research should explore under what\ncircumstances or contexts negative support is most\nlikely to result in detrimental psychological conse-\nquences among widowed older adults.\nSecond, with regard to the concurrent and long-\nterm effects of social support, the findings suggest\nthat the timing of support may be an important\ndeterminant of the effectiveness of support. On the\none hand, except in the case of anxiety, neither\npositive nor negative support prior to widowhood\nhad a significant impact on widowed persons' psy-\nchological well-being. On the other hand, support\nassessed after widowhood--either Wave 1 or 2--\nwas significantly associated with psychological\ndistress. There may be several ways to interpret\nthese findings. One possibility is that support pro-\nvided when parents are in need or under stress--\nthat is, after widowhood--may be more critical\nthan previously available support. Another possi-\nbility is that psychological outcomes are more\nsusceptible to concurrent than to lagged support\nor negative exchanges, especially in the case of\ndepressive symptoms. The small sample size may\nbe also contributing to the lack of significant as-\nsociation between pre-loss support and psycho-\nlogical adjustment. Although with the available\ndata it is difficult to pinpoint the exact driving\nforce, this finding encourages researchers to more\nthoroughly examine how the appropriate timing\nof support may play a role in helping bereaved\nolder adults.\nA final contribution of this study is that it con-\nsidered the changing nature of social support, an\naspect of support that has been relatively over-\nlooked. Although only a few effects were signifi-\ncant, the findings suggest that changes in support\nfrom pre- to post-loss may have an important in-\nfluence on widowed persons' psychological adap-\ntation. In particular, a decrease in positive support\nwas associated with greater depressive symptoms\nand an increase in negative support was associated\nwith greater anger. These findings suggest that re-\nsearchers and practitioners should not only attend\nto the stress-buffering effect of preexisting support\nbut also consider how different responses of close\nsocial relationships in the event of crisis affect old-\ner adults' well-being. Adult children, in particular,\nare expected to provide support when their aging\nparents are in need (Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995).\nWhen children do not meet this expectation of in-\ncreased positive support, parents may show more\ndepressive symptoms. Likewise, surviving spouses\nmay experience greater anger when they feel that\ntheir children are critical or demanding while they\nare going through a stressful life transition into\nwidowhood.\nLimitations\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, as\naddressed in other studies (e.g., Okun & Keith,\n1998), this study bears the problem of low reliabil-\nity and low variability in social support measures,\nespecially in assessing the degree of negative sup-\nport. As noted previously, in order to address the\nproblem of low reliability in the negative support\nscale, I conducted an individual component analy-\nsis examining the separate effects of children's\ndemands and criticism on outcomes (data are not\nshown). The analyses revealed that anxiety is re-\nlated to children's demands rather than to criti-\ncism, whereas depressive symptoms and anger are\nThe Gerontologist\nrelated more closely to children's criticism than to\ndemands.\nAnother limitation in the measures of positive\nand negative support is that the items used to as-\nsess these constructs may not have equal intensity\ndress this issue by using comparably structured\nquestions to assess positive and negative social in-\nteractions (e.g., \"In the past month, how often did\nthe people in your life do things that made your\nlife easier\" vs. \"In the past month, how often did\nthe people in your life do things that made your\nlife harder\"). Efforts such as these will help us bet-\nter understand the relative effects of positive and\nnegative support in future work.\nFinally, the measures of social support grouped\nall children together, although there may be vast\ndifferences in the quality of relationships with re-\nspect to individual children. Future studies should\nexamine how different characteristics of children\n(e.g., child's gender, geographic proximity) add to\nwithin-family variability in the ways that intergen-\nerational relationships affect older adults' adapta-\ntion to widowhood.\nBecause of the small sample size, the current\nstudy was also not able to explore diversity within\nthe widowed population. Levels of positive and\nnegative support may have different implications\nfor different subgroups of the population. For ex-\nample, given that men experience greater difficulty\nthan women in terms of keeping ties with family\nfollowing spousal loss (Campbell & Silverman,\n1996), high levels of positive support may yield\ngreater benefits for widowers than for widows. Fu-\nture studies should further explore these questions\nbuilding on the current research findings.\nImplications for Practice\nThe findings have important implications for\npractice in developing various intervention strate-\ngies to help bereaved older adults and their fami-\nlies. First, the findings highlight the importance of\nconsidering both the positive and the negative as-\npects of social relationships when helping older\nadults cope with spousal loss. Because the health-\npromoting effect of social support is well estab-\nlished (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988) and\nappeals intuitively, interventions have often over-\nlooked the potential negative consequences of so-\ncial relationships. However, the literature suggests\nthat there are stressful aspects of social support\ncially in close relationships, such as the parent\u00ad\nchild relationship, and that even positive support,\nwhen it is excessive, can lead to negative psycho-\nlogical consequences (Silverstein, Chen, & Heller,\n1996). Previous studies have also suggested that in-\nteractions with children can lead to negative reac-\ntions on the part of widowed older adults, such as\nfears about bothering or burdening them, and of\nincreased emotional dependence on their children\n(Talbott, 1990). Practitioners can help bereaved\nolder adults evaluate the helpful and nonhelpful\naspects of intergenerational relationships and\nempower them to think about ways to improve\nthe quality of the relationship by asking what\nkind of help is most useful or not useful and what\nchanges in intergenerational relationships would\nbenefit them. In particular, practitioners can help\nolder adults identify potential sources of conflict\nor tension in intergenerational relationships\nby discussing different expectations and social\nnorms that widowed persons and their children\nhold.\nThe findings also underscore the importance of\nassessing and evaluating the impact of changing\nrelationships over time. As bereaved older adults\nmove from early stages of acute grief to long-term\nadjustment, practitioners should reevaluate the\navailability of their widowed clients' social sup-\nport as well as their changing needs. Attending to\nwhether there have been any significant changes in\nintergenerational relationships and discussing with\nclients ways to maintain, reshape, or foster healthy\nrelationships can benefit bereaved persons' psy-\nchological adjustment.\nIn conclusion, the current study adds important\ninformation to our understanding of the relation-\nship between social support and adjustment to\nwidowhood by exploring both the concurrent and\nthe long-term influences of positive and negative\nsupport from children on various psychological\noutcomes and by investigating the effects of chang-\nes in support. The findings underscore the impor-\ntance of considering both positive and negative\naspects of social support as well as the changing\nnature of social support in working with bereaved\nolder adults. By maintaining contact with wid-\nowed individuals over the course of bereavement,\nand by assessing their available support as well as\nthe areas that they need to make changes in social\nrelationships to better meet their needs, practitio-\nners can maximize the benefits of social support\nand minimize the potentially harmful aspects of\nsocial relationships.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the University of Michigan Rackham\nPredoctoral Fellowship and the Society for Social Work Research Doc-\ntoral Fellows Award.
