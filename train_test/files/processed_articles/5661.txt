    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction: Adiponectin (ADIPOQ), involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid oxidation, plays key roles in\nmetabolic derangements such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Previously, several studies have been conducted to\nassess the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and risk of GDM. The results, however, are inconclusive.\nWe aimed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphism on the risk of GDM using a meta-analysis.\nMaterials and methods: After databases searching, eight records were identified. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with\ntheir corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G\npolymorphism and risk of GDM.\nResults: No significant association was observed between the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and the risk of GDM\nOR = 1.17, 95% CI, 0.79\u00ad1.76, respectively). Apparent heterogeneity was detected. However, no evidence of publication\nbias was found.\nConclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism was not related to the\nrisk of GDM. Further multicenter, prospective studies with larger sample size would be valuable to confirm the result.\n",

For example, Takhshid\net al. reported that the TG/GG genotypes had a 2.55-fold\nincreased risk of GDM compared with the TT genotype,31\nwhereas Beltcheva et al. reported that no association with\nGDM was found for the polymorphism.25 One reason for\nthe conflicting results is small samples in a single study.\nMeta-analysis is a useful tool to increase power by pooling\nall the published data together. In this study, we performed\na meta-analysis to clarify whether the ADIPOQ +45 T/G\npolymorphism is associated with the risk of GDM.\nMaterials and methods\nRecords selection\nPubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu\nand Wangfang databases were searched using the following\nterms: \"ADIPOQ or adiponectin\" and \"polymorphism* or\nvariant\" and \"gestational diabetes mellitus\" or \"Gestational\narticles were identified after database searching. We selected\npublications using the following criteria: (a) studies evaluat-\ning the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymor-\nphism and the risk of GDM; (b) original genotyping data to\ncompute pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI); (c) language was not restricted. Among them,\n18 articles were removed for duplicate publication. After\nfull-text assessment, 12 articles were excluded for these rea-\nsons: no ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism (n = 8), reviews\n(n = 3), and not a study of GDM (n = 1). During data collec-\ntion, we excluded three articles for repeated data. Finally,\neight studies were included in this meta-analysis. A flow\ndiagram of studies selection is presented in Figure 1.\nData extraction\nThe following information was extracted by two research-\ners independently: author, year of publication, country\n(origin), ethnicity, study design, number of cases and con-\ntrols, matching criteria, genotyping method, and minor\nallele frequency in controls. The information was checked\nby a third researcher to confirm the accuracy.\nStatistical analysis\nThe association between the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymor-\nphism and the risk of GDM was evaluated by pooled ORs\nand their 95% CI under a heterozygote comparison,\nhomozygote comparison, dominant model, recessive\nmodel, and allele comparison. A fixed-effects model was\nused to estimate summary ORs because p values for het-\nerogeneity test were  0.10 in all comparison analyses.33\nTo identify the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analy-\nses were performed based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilib-\nmeta-regression was also performed according to ethnic-\nity, genotyping methods, HWE, and sample size. Begg's\nfunnel plot was used to test publication bias.34 All analyses\nwere conducted using STATA software (version 10.0,\nSTATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nCharacteristics of studies\nThe characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table\n1. In total, eight studies were included in this meta-analysis\nwere of Asian descendants26\u00ad32 and one study was of\nEuropean descendants.25 The sample sizes were relatively\nsmall in all the studies, with the least having 79 participants30\nand the most having 436 participants.28 Most of the studies\n(62.5%) reported a matched frequency of controls to\nincluding TaqMan, polymerase chain reaction-restriction\nfragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and DNA\nsequencing. However, only two studies reported quality con-\ntrol to ensure the reproducibility of the genotyping assay.25,31\nMost of the studies (75.0%) were consistent with HWE\nexcept for one study departing from HWE27 and one study\nwithout available data to assess HWE.25 Minor allele fre-\nquency in controls varied greatly, ranging from 0.10 to 0.49.\nMeta-analysis\nAs shown inTable 2, no significant association was observed\nbetween the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and the risk\nFigure 1.

After excluding two studies with Hardy-\nWeinberg disequilibrium, no significant association was\nfound. Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis\nwere also observed in both subgroups.\nHeterogeneity analysis and publication bias.In overall and\nsubgroup analyses, we detected apparent heterogeneity\n(p  0.10). Logistic meta-regression was used to explore\nthe sources of heterogeneity. We took the common variables\ninfluencing heterogeneity into consideration: ethnicity, gen-\notyping methods, HWE, and sample size. However, none of\nthese factors affected the heterogeneity among studies.\nBegg's funnel plot was used to test publication bias, and\nno evidence of publication bias was found (p > 0.05) in the\nmeta-analysis (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis\nto investigate the relationship of the ADIPOQ +45 T/G pol-\nymorphism with GDM. We failed to find any association\nbetween the SNP and the risk of GDM, suggesting that the\nADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism may not be a risk factor\nfor the etiology of GDM.\nPreviously, several SNPs have been performed to eval-\nADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism is the most frequently\ninvestigated. Controversial results, however, have been\nobtained. In this study, we collected all previous publica-\ntions and performed a meta-analysis to assess the associa-\ntion of the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism with the risk\nof GDM. Our meta-analysis provided evidence that the\npolymorphism was not a risk factor for the development of\nGDM although 75% (six of eight) studies reported a posi-\nHWE and sample size, null results were also observed.\nObvious heterogeneity was detected among studies. We\nused logistic meta-regression to examine the sources of het-\nerogeneity based on ethnicity, genotyping methods, HWE,\nand sample size. None of these parameters could explain the\nheterogeneity, indicating that other unknown reasons may\ninfluence the heterogeneity. As most of the studies previ-\nously reported a significant association between the\nADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and susceptibility for\nGDM, in this meta-analysis we used Begg's funnel plot to\ntest if there is a tendency of prior publication positive results.\nHowever, no evidence of publication bias was found.\nThese are some limitations in this study. Firstly, sample\nsize is very small in each single study as well as in this\nmeta-analysis, which may result in false-negative result\ndue to insufficient power. Secondly, very limited data in the\nXu et al. 5\nliterature reported the association between the ADIPOQ\n+45 T/G polymorphism and serum adiponectin level, which\nprevented further genotype-phenotype analysis. Thirdly,\nnearly all the studies included in this meta-analysis were of\nAsian descendants, and thus the results cannot be directly\nextended to other ethnicities. Further evaluation is war-\nranted, especially in multi-ethnic populations.\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that\nthe ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism was not related to\nthe risk of GDM. Further multicenter, prospective studies\nwith larger sample size would be of great value to confirm\nthe result. Additionally, gene-gene and genotype-pheno-\ntype analysis may help to comprehensively understand the\nrole of the SNP in the etiology of GDM.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis work was funded by the National Natural Science\nReferences\n1.
