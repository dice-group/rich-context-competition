    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvolutionary reasoning indicates that certain traits are more beneficial when they are found in a mate than in a son- or a daughter-\nin-law, while other traits are more beneficial when they are found in a son- or a daughter-in-law than in a mate. This translates into\ndifferent evolutionary pressures exercised on in-law and mate preferences driving them to diverge. The purpose of this research\nis to identify the domains over which in-law and mate choice is exercised, and following this, to identify the areas of agreement and\ndisagreement in these domains. In particular, using an extensive sample of parents (N \u00bc 1,717), Study 1 identifies 10 domains over\nwhich mate and in-law choice is exercised. Study 2 employs a sample of families (N \u00bc 541) in order to compare the preferences of\nparents with the preferences of their children. It is found that in-law and mate preferences diverge over several domains including\ngood looks, personality, and family background.\n",

The purpose of this work\nis to advance this research by providing a comprehensive study\nof the areas of disagreement and agreement. This is accom-\nplished in two stages: First, the domains over which in-law and\nmate choice is exercised are identified; and second, the pre-\nference of parents with the preferences of their children are\ncompared in order to identify the areas of agreement and\ndisagreement in these domains.\nParent\u00adOffspring Conflict Over Mating\nParents and children are genetically related but not genetically\nidentical, which translates into their interests overlapping as\narea where this is manifested is mate choice, where the mating\ndecisions of children do not always meet the agreement of their\nBuunk, & Weissinga, 2013). In particular, children and parents\ntend to agree over how important several traits are in a pro-\nspective partner for the former, but they tend to disagree about\nthe importance of several other traits.\nGenetic quality constitutes a good example of this disagree-\nment. Prospective mates differ in their genetic quality: Some\ncarry more genetic mutations than others, while others have\nalleles that can better withstand the challenges of the environ-\nment. Individuals are 0.50 related to their children and 0.25\nrelated to their grandchildren (note that this refers to common\ndescent, that is, 50% of the genes individuals carry come from\none of their parents and 25% from one of their grandparents),\nwhich means that it is beneficial to get mates and in-laws,\nrespectively, of good genetic quality, as this will lead to having\nchildren and grandchildren with good chances of survival.\n1 Social Sciences, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus\nCorresponding Author:\nMenelaos Apostolou, Social Sciences, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus.\nEmail: m.apostolou@gmail.com\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nNevertheless, this means also that it is more beneficial for\nindividuals to get mates of superior genetic quality rather than\nin-laws of superior genetic quality. The reason being that indi-\nviduals have more to lose if, due to poor genetic quality, their\nchildren rather than their grandchildren suffer survival penal-\nties, since they are more closely related to the former than to the\nlatter. Consequently, parents and children would agree that\ngood genetic quality is important in a mate, but they would\ndisagree on how important it is, with the latter ascribing more\nimportance than the former (Apostolou, 2008a).\nThis disagreement can lead to conflict between the two,\npredominantly due to the compromises mate choice entails.\nMore specifically, children are constrained by their own mate\nvalue with regard to the mate value of the individual they can\nattract. For instance, individuals looking for long-term mates\ncannot attract mates of much greater value than their own\nbecause these mates would not be willing to enter in such a\nrelationship, as it would be optimal for them to seek mates of\nsimilar mate value to their own (Apostolou, 2011b; Buss,\n2003). Therefore, mate choice inevitably involves compro-\nmises. In order to be able to keep a long-term partner, mate\nseekers may, for example, have to accept less attractive mates\nthan they would desire. Yet, the asymmetrical fitness benefits\nthat certain traits provide result into children making com-\npromises which are not to the best interest of their parents\nIn particular, as beauty (a proxy of genetic quality; see\nGangestad, Thornhill, & Yeo, 1994; Thornhill & Gangestad,\n1993) is more beneficial in a mate than in an in-law, children\nwill be willing to compromise on traits such as social status and\nfamily background in order to get a more attractive mate.\nNevertheless, because beauty is not as beneficial in an in-\nlaw, the benefits from good looks will not balance the losses\nfrom the compromises in other desirable qualities; thus, from\nthe parents' point of view, these compromises are not optimal.\nIn different words, children's mate choices inflict an opportu-\nnity cost to parents, which equals to the traits they lose and\ncould get if they were to exercise mate choice for their children.\nConsistent with this framework, one study asked children\nand their parents to allocate a fixed budget of mate points\nacross different traits in a prospective spouse and in-law,\nrespectively (Apostolou, 2011b). It was found that individuals\ncompromised in traits such as good family background in order\nto get more of other traits, such as beauty. Parents, however,\nmade different allocations, compromising more on traits such\nas beauty to get more of other traits such as a good family and a\nsimilar religious background. These traits may help parents to\nincrease their own social status (Ertem & Kocturk, 2008; Riley,\nare socialized in a culturally appropriate manner and they will\nreceive care in old age (Dubbs, Buunk, & Taniguchi, 2013;\nRiley, 1994). Overall, beauty in a prospective mate is beneficial\nto both children and their parents, but it is more beneficial to\nthe former than to the latter. Hence, children are willing to\nmake compromises in other traits to get more of it, compro-\nmises that are not to the best interest of parents.\nParent\u00adoffspring conflict over mating can also be under-\nstood in the context of evolutionary trade-offs. The theory of\nevolutionary trade-offs suggests that individuals high in genetic\nquality are likely to be poorer quality parents, as they tend to\ninvest more effort into seeking and obtaining mates than in\nraising children (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). Children, in\ncomparison to their parents, benefit more by mating with an\nindividual of high genetic quality because genetic benefits will\nbe delivered to the resulting offspring. If the partner is a poor\nquality parent, then the children can rely on their parents for\nextra support in raising any resulting offspring. Nevertheless, if\nthe child opts for a partner with traits indicating high parental\ninvestment and lower genetic quality, then the parents would\nnot need to invest extra resources into their child and grand-\nchildren that might then be diverted to other children and\ngrandchildren (Dubbs et al., 2013; Gangestad & Simpson,\nDomains of disagreement. One line of research employed a\nwithin-participants design to compare in-law and mate prefer-\nences. This design was based on the premise that both types of\npreferences are active within a sexually mature individual who\nis also a parent. That is, such an individual can act both as a\nmate seeker and a parent (Apostolou, 2008a). Accordingly,\nparents in the United Kingdom were asked to rate several traits\nin a prospective spouse for themselves and in a prospective\nspouse for their children. Individuals ascribed more value in\nthe good looks and in the exciting personality of a prospective\nmate than of a prospective in-law, while they ascribed more\nvalue in the good family background and in the similar reli-\ngious background of a prospective in-law than of a prospective\nbased on an instrument that was predominantly developed to\nmeasure mate preferences. Consequently, several domains of\ndisagreement may have been missed.\nIn order to identify the domains over which in-law and mate\nchoice takes place, another study employed an open-ended\nquestionnaire and found 86 traits individuals value in a pro-\nspective in-law and in a prospective mate (Apostolou, 2011b).\nOn the basis of findings from anthropological studies, a subse-\nquent study added two more traits to reach a list of 88 traits and,\nby using principal components analysis, classified these into 11\nbroader domains (Apostolou, 2014a). On this basis, Apostolou\net al. (2014) constructed an instrument consisting of 11 items\nand asked a sample of parents to rate their desirability in a\nprospective mate and an in-law. It was found that individuals\nascribed more value in the exciting personality and in being\npleasant and cooperative in a prospective spouse than in an in-\nlaw, while they ascribed more value in being family oriented\nand in coming from a similar religious and ethnic background\nin a prospective-in-law than in a mate.\nIn a similar line of research, individuals in the Netherlands\nwere asked to indicate how acceptable they considered a set of\ntraits in a spouse for themselves and how acceptable they\nthought that their parents would consider the same set of traits\nin a spouse for their children. It was found that participants\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nconsidered an unattractive mate who lacks exciting personality\nas more unacceptable than their parents, while they considered\na mate who does not come from a good family background and\nhas a different religious background than their own, as more\nacceptable than their parents (Buunk et al., 2008; Dubbs &\nBuunk, 2010). Using a similar method, these findings were\nreplicated in an Uruguayan (Park, Dubbs, & Buunk, 2009),\nan Argentinean (Buunk & Castro Solano, 2010), and a Japanese\nOne limitation of the above studies is that they make com-\nparisons within individuals rather than between parents and\ntheir actual children. To allow for this limitation, one study\nasked American individuals to rate a set of 13 traits in a pro-\nspective mate and their parents in a prospective son- and\ndaughter-in-law for their children (Perilloux, Fleischman, &\nBuss, 2011). It was found that individuals ascribed more value\nin attractiveness and personality than their parents, while their\nparents ascribed more value in being religious. The main lim-\nitation of this research is, however, that it employed an instru-\nment that was originally constructed to measure mate\npreferences and as such may have failed to identify important\nareas of disagreement.\nBased on a different theoretical framework, another study\ncompared the mate preferences of 63 parent\u00adchild dyads of\nChinese-Canadian and ChineseAmerican immigrants (Hynie,\nLalonde, & Lee, 2006). It examined disagreement over four\ndimensions, namely, attractiveness, social status, warmth/\nunderstanding, and traditional values. It was found that sons\nplaced a greater emphasis on attractiveness than their parents,\nbut the difference between daughters and their parents was\nmarginal. In addition, it was found that parents emphasized\ntraditional values more than their children (see also Lalonde,\nHynie, Pannu, & Tatla, 2004). This study is also limited by the\nfact that it was based on an instrument predominantly devel-\noped to investigate mate preferences, and it has only investi-\ngated four dimensions of mating interest.\nOverall, the current literature on parent\u00adoffspring conflict\nover mating has several limitations, including being based on\ninstruments developed to measure mate preferences, and thus,\nit may have missed important domains of disagreement. There\nhas been only one study that employed an instrument devel-\noped specifically for this purpose, which has only been exam-\nined in a within-participants design (i.e., Apostolou et al.,\n2014). In addition, this instrument has been developed based\non principal components analysis, without any attempt to repli-\ncate the factor structure in a different sample. Moreover, each\nfactor or domain has several facets, that is, it is composed of\nseveral subtraits. Nevertheless, there has not been any attempt\nto examine disagreement over these traits or over traits that do\nnot load on any factors (i.e., with factor loading below 0.300).\nLast but not least, to the knowledge of the authors, there has\nbeen only one evolutionary informed study that compares the\npreferences of parents and the preferences of their actual chil-\nThe present research attempts to address these limitations\nand to provide a comprehensive account of parent\u00adoffspring\nagreement and disagreement over mate choice. In particular, it\naims to (a) identify the main domains, where mate and in-law\nchoice is exercised and (b) examine the agreement and dis-\nagreement of parents and their actual children in (1) the broader\ndomains, (2) in the facets of each domain, and (3) in traits\nwhich do not load in any domain.\nThe purpose of Study 1 is to identify the primary domains of\ninterest over which mate and in-law choice are exercised.\nMethod\nParticipants\nEight research assistants were employed for the purposes of\nthis study. They recruited individuals who volunteered to par-\nticipate in a research on family relationships (no payment was\ngiven). A snowball sampling technique was used, where the\nresearch assistants recruited initially several parents and then\nobtained references for other parents who may be interested in\nparticipating in the study. The data collection process lasted\napproximately 6 months. To qualify for participation, an indi-\nvidual had to have at least one child. This research did not\nemploy couples, that is, fathers and mothers came from differ-\nent families. The participants were initially asked to sign a\nconsent form and then they were given the survey. Upon com-\npletion, the participants put the questionnaire in an unmarked\nenvelop and sealed it.\nchildren and a mean of 1.5 (SD \u00bc 0.7) female children. The\nmean age of the oldest female child was 20.4 (SD \u00bc 9.1) and\nthe mean age of the oldest male child was 20.6 (SD \u00bc 9.2).\nMoreover, 85.5% of the participants were married, 11.5% were\nwere in a relationship.\nMaterials\nThe survey had two parts. In the first part, participants\nwere asked to rate how desirable they considered a set of\ntraits to be in a prospective spouse for their children using\na 4-point Likert-type scale (0 \u00bc unimportant, 1 \u00bc somehow\nimportant, 2 \u00bc important, and 3 \u00bc indispensable). The\ninstrument employed to measure in-law preferences con-\nsisted of 88 traits (e.g., family oriented, selfless, etc.) that\nhave been identified by previous research (Apostolou,\ntion was collected (sex, age, marital status, number of\ndaughters and sons, and ages of the oldest male child and\nof the oldest female child).\nApostolou 3\nResults\nIn order to classify traits in broader preference domains, prin-\ncipal components method for factor extraction and direct obli-\nmin as the rotation method were used. Direct oblimin was\nchosen because the assumption of noncorrelated preferences\nis unlikely to hold. The results suggested a 10-factor solution\n(eigenvalue > 1). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic was\n.975, indicating an excellent sample adequacy. The factors and\nthe respective loadings are presented in Table 1. The scales\nproduced by this procedure were checked by means of relia-\nbility analysis. The internal consistency (Cronbach's a) ranged\nThe factors ``good looks,'' ``good cook-housekeeper,''\n``well-off family background,'' ``similar religious and ethnic\nbackground,'' ``family oriented,'' ``good economic prospects,''\nand ``exciting personality'' replicate previous factors (Aposto-\nlou, 2014a). The ``kind, understanding, and cooperative'' is\nsimilar to the ``kind and understanding'' factor, but traits\nrelated to cooperativeness also load here. The ``reliable and\nmature'' is similar to the ``emotionally stable and mature;''\nhowever, in this case, items related to emotional stability do\nnot load. The ``spontaneous and selfless'' is similar to the\n``pleasant personality and cooperative,'' but the item loadings\nare different.\nFinally, the ``chastity'' factor did not emerge here. One\npossible reason is that in the Apostolou (2014a) study, the\nfactor structure was derived separately for daughters and for\nsons, which was not the case for the current study. In addition,\nin this cultural context, individuals are usually sexually expe-\nrienced before marriage, which turns chastity not to be an\nimportant consideration for parents, which may make it less\nlikely to be detected as a stand-alone factor.\nStudy 2 aims to identify agreement and disagreement between\nparents and their children in the domains found in Study 1.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFour research assistants were employed for the purposes of this\nstudy. They recruited families who volunteered to participate in\nresearch on family relationships (no payment was given). To\nqualify for participation, a family had to have at least one child\nwho was 16 years of age or older. The research assistants\nvisited families in their homes and administered the survey to\neach family member who was willing to participate. Partici-\npants completed the questionnaire independently, and upon\ncompletion, they put it in an unmarked envelop and sealed it.\nIn this study, 541 Greek\u00adCypriot families participated, con-\nchildren (295 daughters and 349 sons).

Finally, 69.5% of sons\nwere single, 15.5% were in a relationship, 1.7% were married,\nand 0.3% were divorced.\nMaterials\nThe survey was in Greek and it came in two versions, one\nadministered to parents and the other to their children. Each\nversion had two parts. In the first part, participants were asked\nto rate the desirability of 88 traits employed in Study 1 in a\nprospective spouse for their daughters and sons using a 4-point\nLikert-type scale (0 \u00bc unimportant, 1 \u00bc somehow important,\n2 \u00bc important, and 3 \u00bc indispensable). The order of presenta-\ntion (daughter and son) was counterbalanced across partici-\npants. In the second part of the version administered to\nparents, demographic information was collected (sex, age, mar-\nital status, number of daughters and sons, and age of the oldest\nmale child and the oldest female child).\nThe survey administered to children had a similar format. In\nthe first part, participants were asked to rate the desirability of\nthe 88 traits in a prospective spouse for themselves using a\n4-point Likert-type scale (0 \u00bc unimportant, 1 \u00bc somehow\nimportant, 2 \u00bc important, and 3 \u00bc indispensable). In the sec-\nond part, demographic information was collected (sex, age, and\nmarital status).\nResults\nIn order to examine whether parents and children differ in their\npreferences, doubly multivariate analysis (which is statistically\nequivalent to repeated measures multivariate analysis of var-\niance) was conducted for each of the 10 preferences. In each\ncomparison, the role (parent\u00adchild) entered as the independent\nvariable and the traits that composed each preference entered as\nthe dependent variables. Note that this analysis was appropriate\nbecause a within-family design was employed, so children's\nand parents' answers should not be considered independent.\nThe analysis was performed individually for mothers,\ndaughters and sons, and for fathers, daughters and sons. The\nresults are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Please note that the\ndesign of the study did not allow for the sex of the parent to be\nentered as an independent variable.\nNot all traits loaded in the extracted factors (i.e., have a\nfactor loading above .300); however, we would like to know\nif there was agreement and disagreement in these as well. For\nthis purpose, a series of paired-samples t-test was applied\nbetween the ratings that mothers and their children, and fathers\nand their children gave for each trait that did not load in any\nfactor. The results are presented in Table 3.\nFinally, in each case (i.e., mother\u00addaughter, mother\u00adson,\nfather\u00addaughter, father\u00adson), 10 different tests (one for each\ndomain) were performed for each comparison which is likely to\ninflate the a level. Accordingly, Bonferroni correction was\nparisons of individual traits (Table 3), there are 13 comparisons\nMothers Versus Children\nWith respect to mothers and daughters, Table 2 indicates that\nthere was divergence in preferences over good looks, sponta-\nneous and selfless, and exciting personality, with these being\nvalued more by daughters in a spouse than by their mothers in a\nson-in-law. On the other hand, mothers placed more emphasis\nthan their daughters on similar religious and ethnic back-\nground. For the ``reliable and tolerant'' and family oriented,\nthere were differences that are not consistent to one direction.\nThat is, certain constituent traits were preferred more by daugh-\nters while others more by their mothers. Also, for most of the\nconstituent traits, significant differences were not found, indi-\ncating that there was not much disagreement between mothers\nand daughters. In addition, for good economic prospects, well-\noff family background, and good cook-housekeeper, there was\nagreement between mothers and daughters. Finally, from Table\n3 we can see that ``positive,'' ``energetic,'' and ``optimist''\nwere preferred more by daughters in a husband than by their\nmothers in a son-in-law.\nTable 1.

More spe-\ncifically, good looks, spontaneous and selfless, and exciting\npersonality were valued more by sons in a wife than by their\nmothers in a daughter-in-law. As in the case of daughters,\nmothers valued similar religious and ethnic background more\nin a daughter-in-law than their sons in a wife. In addition, for\nthe ``reliable and tolerant,'' well-off family background, and\nfamily oriented, there were differences that were not consistent\nto one direction, whereas there was agreement for most traits\nthat compose them. Furthermore, for good economic prospects\nand good cook-housekeeper, there was agreement between\nmothers and sons. Finally, from Table 3, we can see that ``pos-\nitive'' is valued more by sons in a prospective mate than by\ntheir mothers in a daughter-in-law.\nFathers Versus Children\nRegarding fathers and daughters, we can see from Table 4 that\ndaughters considered good looks, spontaneous and selfless,\nkind, understanding and cooperative, exciting personality,\n``reliable and tolerant,'' family oriented, and good economic\nprospects more important in a husband than their fathers did in\na son-in-law. On the other hand, fathers considered more\nimportant the well-off family background in a son-in-law than\ntheir daughters did in a spouse. In addition, no significant dif-\nferences were found for the similar religious and ethnic back-\nground and the good cook-housekeeper preferences. Finally,\nfrom Table 3, we can see that there were several traits such\nas ``positive'' and ``sweet'' which were preferred more by\ndaughters in a spouse than by their fathers in a son-in-law.\nWith respect to fathers and sons, good looks and sponta-\nneous and selfless were considered as more important by sons\nin a wife than by their fathers in a daughter-in-law. Similarly,\ndaughters placed more emphasis in the good economic pros-\npects of a prospective husband than their fathers in a prospec-\ntive son-in-law. On the other hand, fathers considered well-off\nfamily background, good cook-housekeeper, and similar reli-\ngious and ethnic background more important in a daughter-\nTable 2.

Also, for the ``reliable\nand tolerant'' preference, there were differences that were\nnot consistent to one direction, whereas there was an over-\nlap for most traits that compose them. Finally, for the kind,\nunderstanding and cooperative, spontaneous and selfless,\nand family oriented, there were no significant differences.\nInteraction Effects\nWe would like to examine whether parents disagree more with\ntheir daughters than with their sons or the reverse, that is,\nwhether in-law and mate preferences diverge more between\nparents and daughter or the other way around. In different\nwords, we would like to investigate whether there is an inter-\naction effect between the role (i.e., parent\u00adchild) and the sex of\nthe child. Toward this end, we repeated previous analysis by\nentering the sex of the child as the independent variable.\nMore specifically, doubly multivariate analysis was con-\nducted for each of the 10 preferences, where role and sex of the\nchild were entered as the independent variables, and the traits\nthat composed each preference were entered as the dependent\nvariables. The analysis was performed twice, once for mothers\nand children and once for fathers and children. No significant\ninteraction effects were found for any of the comparisons.\nDiscussion\nTheresultsindicatethatparentsdonotagreewiththeirchildrenover\nwho might their ideal mate be. Disagreement is found in several\ntraits, but it appears that it is centered on three broader domains of\ninterest: good looks, personality, and family background.\nTo begin with, good looks were rated consistently more\nimportant by daughters and sons than by their mothers and\nfathers. Furthermore, both daughters and sons valued personality\ntraits that make an individual pleasant to be with more than their\nparents. This is primarily reflected in the spontaneous and self-\nless and the exciting personality preferences. This appears also\nin traits such as positive, energetic, and optimistic, which did not\nload in any of the 10 domains, but they were preferred more by\nchildren in a spouse than by their parents in an in-law.\nOn the other hand, parents placed more emphasis on the\nfamily background of a prospective in-law than their children\nTable 3.

Parents were predominantly\nconcerned with their daughters- and sons-in-law coming from\nfamilies, which have similar characteristics to their own family.\nFathers also placed greater emphasis than their children on in-\nlaws coming from well-off families.\nThe current research confirms previous findings that there is\nparent\u00adoffspring disagreement over good looks, and it identi-\nfies that this is the case for most of the traits associated with this\ndomain. It further confirms that exciting personality is another\narea of disagreement, while it reveals that this disagreement is\nalso found for the related spontaneous and selfless domain. In\naddition, previous research has identified good family back-\nground and similar religious background to be a key area of\nPerilloux et al., 2011). The present research finds that these\ntraits constitute different facets of a preference for similarity\nover religious and ethnic background, which was preferred\nmore in an in-law than in a spouse.\nFinally, this research finds that for certain domains, there is\ndisagreement, but the direction of the disagreement is different\nfor its constituent traits. For instance, for the family oriented,\nchildren placed more emphasis on a spouse being sincere and\nhonest than their parents on an in-law, but parents, mainly\nmothers, placed more emphasis on traits such as ``loves his/her\nfamily.'' This contradicts the finding of Apostolou et al. (2014),\nwhere it was found that this trait is valued more in an in-law\nthan in a spouse. The Apostolou et al. study, however, asked\nparents to rate only the family-oriented trait without examining\nits constituent traits. This discrepancy in the findings suggests\nthat in order to better understand disagreement, differences in\nthe overall domains as well as in their constituent components\nmust be considered.\nThe results indicate further that parent\u00adoffspring disagree-\nment is not contingent on the sex of the child, that is, the\ndisagreement between parents and their daughters is not stron-\nger or weaker than the disagreement between parent and their\nsons. There is, however, still the possibility that fathers or\nmothers disagree more or less with their sons or with their\ndaughters. In other words, there may be a three-way interaction\nbetween the role, the sex of the parent, and the sex of the child.\nThe design of this study does not allow testing for this interac-\ntion, and future research needs to be pursued to examine if this\nis the case.\nOne of the strengths of this study is that it uses a relatively\nlarge sample to identify the domains of interest in mate and in-\nlaw choice. This, along with the fact that the extracted domains\nTable 4. (continued)\nPreferences\nFather Daughter\np Value d\nFather Son\np Value d\nMean (SD) Means (SD) Mean (SD) Means (SD)\nNote. Significant main effects are in boldface.\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\noverlap considerably with the domains identified by previous\nresearch, provides us with some degree of confidence that these\nare the main domains of interest. Furthermore, this study exam-\nined individually all traits identified as important in a prospec-\ntive spouse and in an in-law. As a consequence, it is unlikely\nthat there is a major area of disagreement or agreement over in-\nlaw and mate choice that has not been identified here. Last but\nnot least, this study is the first one to examine agreement and\ndisagreement in the constituent traits of the extracted domains\nbetween parents and their actual children.\nThis work is not without limitations, one being that it is\nbased on self-report data. Thus, when they have to actually\nexercise mate or in-law choice, individuals may exhibit differ-\nent preferences than the ones they indicate here. Another lim-\nitation is that the design of Study 2 cannot distinguish between\nevolved predisposition effects and age and accumulated expe-\nrience effects. In particular, when we compare parents and\nchildren, what changes between them is not only the role\n(i.e., parent vs. child) but also the age and life experience. For\nexample, the evolutionary perspective predicts that different\nselection pressures have been exercised on in-law and mate\npreferences, with these diverging over good looks, a trait that\nis preferred more in a mate than in an in-law. Accordingly, the\ndifferences we observe in this research partially reflect evolved\npredisposition effects. Yet, as people age, they may have\nlearned through life experience that beauty goes away and that\nit is not such an important trait in a partner after all. Since\nparents are older, they have more life experience, than their\nchildren, which adds to the observed effect. In other domains,\nhowever, the age and experience effect may be to the opposite\ndirection of the evolved predisposition effect, and it can even\nmask it. This limitation can be addressed by employing a\nwithin-participants design, where individuals would rate traits\nboth in a spouse and in an in-law.\nThe present research is also limited by the fact that it is\nconfined to a single culture. The cultural context is likely to\nbe influential on mate and in-law preferences (Apostolou,\nagreement is also likely to be affected by the specific cultural\nsetting. Future research needs to replicate the study in different\ncultures, particularly in preindustrial ones, where mate choice\nis regulated.\nFurthermore, participants in this research were recruited\nthrough a snowball sampling technique, which might be sus-\nceptible to nonrepresentativeness. For instance, participants\nwere recruited predominantly in cities such as Nicosia. Conse-\nquently, traditional rural participants might be underrepre-\nsented. Future studies need to account for this limitation by\nemploying a different sampling technique. In addition, the\nsocioeconomic status of both parents and children is likely to\nhave an effect on their in-law and mate preferences, respec-\ntively. In this study, socioeconomic variables were not mea-\nsured, and future research needs to assess their impact on in-\nlaw and mate preferences. Last but not least, this study did not\ntake into consideration participants' sexual orientation. This\ncan introduce a bias, as people with predominantly homosexual\norientation may not give valid answers to questions about\nchoosing spouses.\nMate choice is important, one reason being that it introduces\na new member in the family unit, who will play a considerable\nrole in its survival and reproduction. Given its importance, we\nexpect that selection forces would have shaped the human mind\nto pay considerable attention to mate and in-law choice. This\nmeans that parent\u00adoffspring conflict over mating is not just\nanother area of disagreement between parents and children, but\nit is a central area of disagreement. Progress in understanding\nthis disagreement is likely to help in developing successful\nintervention programs that will aim to reduce intrafamily strife.\nSuch interventions may enable, for instance, individuals to\nunderstand that their parents may react negatively to their mate\nchoices because they have different preferences to them. It may\nalso enable parents to understand that their children date indi-\nviduals who do not comply with their preferences not as a\nreaction against their parents' wishes, but because they have\ndifferent preferences.\nOverall, the present research has attempted to provide a\ncomprehensive account of the domains and their facets over\nwhich there is disagreement between parents and their children\nwith respect to the latter's mate choices. Future work needs to\nreplicate these findings in different samples and in different\ncultural settings. Future work needs also to employ these find-\nings in developing interventions, which can improve intrafam-\nily communication and reduce conflict between family\nmembers.\n"
