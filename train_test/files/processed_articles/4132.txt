Our\nobjective was to understand the perspectives of United States' state-level policy makers and health researchers on the barriers\nand facilitators to the translation of health evidence into the policy process, with a particular focus on issues related to relationship\nbuilding. We conducted interviews with 215 US health services and health policy researchers and 40 state-level staffers and\nlegislators. Researchers and policy makers faced the same major barrier to research translation: lack of dedicated time to do so.\nSome policy makers questioned the credibility of research, and researchers questioned policy makers' authentic desire to use\nevidence in decision making. For some study participants, a mutual mistrust of the other group challenges stronger relationship\nformation. Interventions are needed to help both groups understand a broader role that research plays in policy making and to\nincrease personal contact, and ultimately trusted relationships, across various actors in the policy process.\n",

Commentators have suggested that research is in dan-\nger of being relegated as less important to the policy-making\nprocess,1 which is particularly concerning after several years\nof apparent progress in promoting the translation of evidence\ninto policy making. The Obama administration was known\nfor using scientific research in unprecedented ways, such as\nin its cross-agency Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to\nleverage the insights of behavioral economics to make gov-\nernmental programs work better to solve problems.2 At the\nsame time, experts and commentators have argued that prog-\nress has been too slow. A 2012 US National Academies of\nScience report called for more social science research on the\nconditions under which research is used or not in public pol-\nicy.3 New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, sparking\ndebate among the US academic community in a February\n2014 column, argued that academics should inject themselves\nmore seriously into public discourse and policy making.4\nGiven the current political climate, it is critical to reconsider\na key question: What are the conditions in which research evi-\ndence is, or is not, used in health policy-making settings?\nAbodyofempiricalresearchinthefieldofknowledgetransfer\nand exchange over the last 3 decades seeks to answer this ques-\ntion.5 This research relies on surveys and interviews with govern-\nment officials, agency staff, advocates, research institutions, and/\nor researchers to investigate the barriers and facilitators to evi-\ndence use in policy making.6-12 One synthesis of this research, for\ninstance, finds that the most prominent barriers include negative\nattitudes and mistrust, misaligned incentives, ineffective\n1University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, MN, USA\n2Boston University School of Public Health, MA, USA\n3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA\n4Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA\n5University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSarah E.

He argued that the differing perspectives,\nvalues, and ideologies of researchers compared with govern-\nment officials make their worlds isolated from and mistrust-\nful of the other, which explains low incorporation of research\nin policy. Other empirical research supports the notion that\nthe 2 groups do not sufficiently understand one another, and\nthat this contributes to communication challenges.15\nThe major conclusion, then, supported by a wealth of evi-\ndence in the field of knowledge transfer, is that building per-\nsonal relationships is the most important way to bridge the\n\"gap\" between the 2 communities and ultimately to more\neffectively translate research to its end users.8 Studies fre-\nquently show, for instance, that personal contact between\nresearchers and policy makers facilitates greater evidence\nuse in policy making.15 A recent systematic review found\nthat increased contact, collaboration, and relationships facili-\ntate evidence use in over two-thirds of all studies consid-\nered.16 As a result of this evidence, recommendations for\nmore effective translation strategies often include facilitating\nopportunities for more in-person networking, communica-\ntion, and ultimately relationship building--particularly\nbefore a specific decision making need arises--between\nWhile there has been much work, as outlined above, on\nthe barriers researchers face in communicating their research\nevidence (ie, lack of training, capacity, time, etc) and the bar-\nriers policy makers' face in using it (ie, constituents'\ndemands, credibility concerns, lack of time, other political\ninfluences), relatively few studies have analyzed relational\nfactors of both groups simultaneously (although see\nBogenschneider and Corbett's12 work for a notable excep-\ntion). Yet examining the attitudes and perspectives of both\nresearchers and policy makers together is essential for mak-\ning recommendations of how relationships between the two\ncan be better supported. In addition, since some of the exist-\ning empirical research on evidence in health policy making is\nolder than the past decade,11,18 drawing conclusions from the\nexisting body of literature for the current context of health\nservices and policy research needs may be inappropriate.\nThe time is ripe for a comprehensive look at researchers'and\npolicy makers' mutual perceptions, in order to understand\nwhether and how conditions related to knowledge transfer\nhave changed in recent years and to identify new recommen-\ndations for a political context characterized by uncertainty\nover the value of evidence.\nOur objective in this study was thus to examine US health\nservices researchers' and health-related policy makers' per-\nceptions of the role of research evidence in the policy-mak-\ning process and, particularly, their attitudes about each other.\nThe ultimate aim of this work was to identify recommenda-\ntions for future interventions to improve knowledge transla-\ntion. These findings and recommendations are important to a\nvariety of stakeholders, including research funders (such as\nthe National Institutes of Health and foundations that have\nmade evidence-based policy a priority, including the W.T.\nGrantFoundationandtheLauraandJohnArnoldFoundation),\nstate governments and legislators (particularly legislative\nresearch functions), universities and university-based centers\nthat fund and promote research, and intermediary organiza-\ntions, such as professional societies for researchers (such as\nAcademyHealth) and independent research clearinghouses\n(such as blogs like The Incidental Economist).\nNew Contribution\nThis qualitative study provided an in-depth assessment of the\ncommonalities and differences between applied health pol-\nicy researchers and policy makers in 2013, focusing particu-\nlarly on their perspectives toward each other. The results\nilluminate sources of potential friction between researchers\nand policy makers and identify recommendations for\nimproved processes of research translation that incorporate\nbroader perspectives on how scientific evidence can be used\nacross the policy-making process, not just at the point of\npolicy decisions.\nData and Methods\nStudy Participants\nIn the summer of 2013, we collected data from researchers\nand policy makers at the AcademyHealth's Annual Research\nMeeting (ARM) and the National Conference of State\nLegislatures annual meeting, respectively. AcademyHealth\nis the largest gathering of US health policy and health ser-\nvices researchers (more details on recruitment and methodol-\nogy are available elsewhere20). The AcademyHealth sample\nincluded 215 health services and health policy researchers\nrecruited from a random sample of 325 preregistrants for the\n2013 AcademyHealth's Annual Research Meeting in\nBaltimore, Maryland, in June (66% response). We limited\nour sample to researchers whose primary affiliation was an\nacademic institution. We sent each of the 325 registrants an\ninvitation to be interviewed at the meeting along with a $2\nincentive. We sent a follow-up e-mail to schedule interviews\nwith responders, and we contacted nonresponders 2 addi-\ntional times by e-mail. Interviews were conducted by trained\nresearch assistants in a designated meeting area. Twenty-\neight participants were unable to complete the interview dur-\ning the meeting and were interviewed by telephone.\nGollust et al 3\nThe second sample included legislators and legislative\nstaff attending the National Conference of State Legislatures'\nannual Legislative Summit in August 2013 in Atlanta, GA.\nThe Summit is the largest national gathering of state-level\nlegislators. Our sample was limited to legislators and legisla-\ntive staff from the United States who focused on health and/\nor human services issues. Inclusion in the study was based on\nconfirmation of role as legislator or legislative staff by inter-\nview, and a total of 43 policy makers participated. Because\nthese were intercept interviews solicited as they attended\nconference sessions (ie, no formal sampling frame), we\nreport no response rate.\nConsent was obtained prior to all interviews. Participants\nwere entered in raffles for a $200 retail gift card. The study\nwas approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional\nReview Board.\nInterview Instruments\nThe 2 instruments were designed to identify researchers' and\npolicy makers' professional activities related to the dissemi-\nnation of and use of research in the policy-making process.\nFor the researcher sample, researchers first answered a struc-\ntured (quantitative) survey instrument (with results previ-\nously reported20). Then they were asked several open-ended\ninterview questions concerning activities they engaged in\nrelated to the dissemination of their own research. The inter-\nview instruments for policy makers were solely qualitative.\nPolicy makers were asked to describe specific activities they\nengaged in related to finding and using research evidence in\nthe policy-making process, with probes related to their use of\nsocial media. The open-ended question that is the focus of\nthis analysis for the researcher sample was, \"What is the big-\ngest challenge as a researcher to influencing policy?\" The\nopen-ended question that is the focus of the analysis for the\npolicy maker sample was, \"What do you see as the biggest\nchallenge to using research evidence in health policy?\"\nAnalysis\nAll interviews were transcribed and de-identified. First, all\nmembers of the author team discussed a small set (N = 5) of\ntranscripts from both groups. Through this inductive process,\nwe identified the main emergent themes, mentions of chal-\nlenges and barriers to translation, best practices for finding\nand/or communicating research (how it is accessed, how it is\ncommunicated, and by whom), characteristics of the policy-\nmaking process, and differences between researchers and\npolicy makers. While many themes were identified in both\nresearchers' and policy makers' transcripts, others were\nunique to one group (such as \"credibility of science,\" which\nemerged only in the policy maker sample). These themes\ncomprised the initial codes in our codebook; additional\nthemes were identified and added to the coding scheme as\nneeded in a pilot coding process led by 3 of the authors.\nBefore coding all transcripts, a subset of transcripts were\ndouble-coded to ensure interrater reliability. Disagreement\nwas reconciled and agreement exceeded 90%. Next, 2\nauthors coded all transcripts using the final codebook in\nNVivo 10.0. After all codes were entered, the study team cre-\nated analysis memos for all codes, describing the major\nthemes under each code, key outliers, and a comprehensive\nlist of illustrative quotes. Through a comparative method, the\nteam analyzed all the researcher and policy-maker memos\nfor consistency and disagreement. We also examined differ-\nences in themes for researchers by their academic rank\n(assistant, associate, full professors) and for policy makers\nby whether they were elected legislators or staff. Differences\nin these characteristics did not stand out as important and so\nwe report the findings at the level of the group as a whole.\nFor the purposes of the present analysis which seeks to illu-\nminate the role of relationships in research translation, we\nfocused our results on the barriers and facilitators of research\ntranslation and attitudes relevant to relationships between\nresearchers and policy makers.\nResults\nTable 1 describes the characteristics of the 215 researcher\nparticipants. There were more female than male researchers,\nwhile the policy maker sample was nearly three-fourths\nmale. The largest group (44%) of researchers were within the\nfirst 10 years of degree; similarly, the largest group (32%) of\npolicy makers had been in their position for 6 to 10 years.\nThe policy maker sample was well represented across parti-\nsan groups, with somewhat more Democrats (47%) than\nRepublicans (33%), with the remainder nonpartisan (for\nstaff) or unknown.\nThe analysis generated 4 broad findings related to policy\nmakers' and researchers' perceptions of one another and of\nuse of evidence in policy making (see summary in Table 2).\nFirst, despite coming from different professional back-\ngrounds, both groups faced consistent barriers to communi-\ncating and using research effectively, barriers that impede\nefforts to build relationships across groups. Second, the 2\ngroups had varying perspectives on the value of research in\npolicy making, with a high degree of cynicism on the role of\nevidence in policy making expressed by both groups. Third,\nfor some study participants, negative perspectives about the\nuse of research in policy making corresponded with a\nstrongly expressed mistrust toward the other group. Fourth,\nboth groups described a mismatch between the needs of pol-\nicy makers and the approaches taken by researchers.\nConsistent Barriers\nResearchers and policy makers were consistent in their\n"
