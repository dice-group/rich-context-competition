In the past decade, there has been increasing interest in regional differences in attitudes and behaviors;\nhowever, little of this research has focused on families, particularly in later life. The goal of this article is to address two\nspecific questions: (a) Does adult children's closeness and contact with mothers vary by region? and (b) Can traditionalism\nexplain patterns of regionality?\nMethods. To address these questions, we used a subsample of adult children (aged 25\u00ad74) from the National Survey of\nFamilies and Households (Wave II) who were asked about contact and closeness with their mothers (aged 65 and older).\nResults. Adult children residing in the South reported greater contact and closeness with mothers than those residing in\nother parts of the country. Traditionalism regarding gender ideology and religious involvement could not account for the\ngreater contact and closeness observed among Southern respondents.\nDiscussion. Recent literature has demonstrated the persistence of a distinctive Southern culture; the present study\ncontributes to this body of work by showing that intergenerational cohesion is also greater in the South than in other regions\nof the United States. These findings call for greater attention to regionality in future studies of intergenerational relations.\nACROSS the past decade, there has been a resurgence of\ninterest in comparing the American South to other regions\nof the country (DiMaggio, Evans, & Bryson, 1996; Hurlbert &\nMuch of this work has focused on the traditional values and\nbehaviors that compose ``Southern culture.'' Although the fam-\nily is generally considered to be a cornerstone of traditionalism,\nit has received little attention in the study of regional differences.\nIn the present study, we began to examine this issue by focusing\non one of the most enduring of family relations--that between\nmothers and adult children. To this end, we used data from the\nNational Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to\ninvestigate whether mother\u00adadult-child closeness and contact\ndiffer between the South and other regions of the United States.\nFurthermore, we examined whether other dimensions of\ntraditionalism can explain patterns of regionality in mother\u00ad\nadult-child relations.\nStudies across the past three decades have shown evidence\nof regional differences, the strongest and most consistent of\nwhich have been between the South and all other regions of\nthe United States. In particular, Southerners are expected, both\nby themselves and by non-Southerners, to be more sociable\nregarding both moral issues and gender roles (Powers et al.,\nhave noted the strong role of the family in Southern culture (cf.\ndimensions of traditional values and behaviors (DiMaggio\nstrong relationship between other dimensions of traditionalism\nMcLanahan, 1993), it stands to reason that the same trend in\nregional differences regarding other aspects of traditionalism,\nsuch as those regarding gender and religion, would be found in\nfamily relations. Therefore, we hypothesized that relations be-\ntween mothers and their adult children would be more cohesive\nin the South than in other regions of the country.\nAs discussed previously, we believe that closer parent\u00adadult-\nchild relations among Southerners is primarily a manifestation\nof greater traditionalism in the South across a variety of issues,\nincluding religion, gender-role attitudes, and attitudes regarding\nsocial issues more generally. If this is the case, the association\nbetween region and parent\u00adchild relations should weaken or\ndisappear completely when controlling on such measures of\ntraditionalism. However, this may not be the case if familism\nvaries by region apart from other dimensions of traditionalism.\nCarter and Borch's (2005) recent analysis of regional differ-\nences in gender-role attitudes suggests that, in fact, this might\nbe the case. They found that even after controlling on reli-\ngiosity, religious attendance, and education--three strong pre-\ndictors of traditionalism--region continued to exert an effect\non gender-role attitudes. These findings suggest that there\nmay be dimensions of Southern culture that function beyond\neffects of other characteristics common to the South. Rather\nthan developing specific hypotheses regarding the independent\neffects of region on parent\u00adadult-child closeness and contact,\nwe explored this question.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\nIn summary, we hypothesized that closeness and contact\nbetween mothers and adult children would be stronger in the\nSouth than in other regions of the United States. We also ex-\nplored the association between region and mother\u00adchild rela-\ntionship quality and how dimensions of traditionalism mediate\nthis relationship.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data for this study were a subsample of Wave II of the\nNSFH used a national stratified, multistage area probability\nsample collected from both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan\nareas (Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The NSFH is a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adults, all of whom were asked about\ntheir relationships with their living parents (Wave II n \u00bc\nregional differences in parent\u00adadult-child relations for two\nreasons. First, because regional differences have become more\nwanted to use the most recent data available; thus, NSFH2\nwas preferable to NSFH1. Additionally, given the concern\nwith recency, NSFH3 might have been the most ideal for our\nstudy; however, the substantial attrition between T2 and T3\nreduced the number of respondents with living parents below\nthe threshold we believed was reasonable for analysis.\nThe subsample for the present study included all members of\nthe original sample with (a) mothers alive and older than age 65\nand (b) data on both contact and closeness with mothers (n \u00bc\n2,502). The analysis focused on parent\u00adchild relations from the\nadult child's perspective. We chose to focus on mothers rather\nthan both parents because in families in which parents were\nalive and living together, the NSFH2 asked adult children about\ntheir contact with mothers only. Because contact with mothers\nand fathers, even when coresidential, differs substantially\n(Lawton, Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994), we felt that it would\nbe inappropriate to use contact with mothers as a surrogate for\ncontact with fathers.\nSample Characteristics\nCharacteristics of adult children. --The respondents were\nwere married. With regard to education, 11% had less than\na high school education, 32% had a high school diploma or\nequivalent, 19% had some college, and 38% were college\ngraduates. A total of 60% were women. Finally, 81% were\nWhite, 13% were Black, and 6% were non-White Hispanic.\nCharacteristics of mothers. --The mothers were between the\nmarried, and 46% were widowed. With regard to education,\n37% had less than a high school education, 40% had a high\nschool diploma or equivalent, 11% had some college, and 12%\nwere college graduates.\nDependent Variables\nThe respondents were asked about multiple aspects of their\nrelationships with their mothers. For the purposes of this article,\nwe used measures of frequency of contact and closeness with\nmothers. Contact was measured by two questions asking how\nmany times during the past 12 months the respondent had seen\nhis or her mother or communicated by letter or phone with her.\nAnswers to these questions ranged on a 6-point scale, where 0\u00bc\nnot at all and 5 \u00bc more than once a week. We used these two\nquestions to create a single contact measure. To do this, we\nused the highest response to either measure as the respondent's\nscore. Thus, for example, if a respondent reported that she had\nseen her mother once a month and also reported that she had\nspoken to her mother on the phone more than once a week, we\nassigned her a score of 5 on the combined item. Closeness was\nmeasured by the following question: ``Taking all things\ntogether, on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is really bad and\n10 is absolutely perfect, how would you describe your\nrelationship with your mother?''\nIndependent Variables\nRegion was created by the NSFH using the state in which the\nrespondent resided. Following the lead of the preponderance of\nTwenge, 1997) we compared the South with all other regions\ncombined. States designated by the NSFH as Southern were\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina,\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee,\nAlabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and\nTexas. It is important to note that prior to making a final\ndecision regarding our analytic approach, we conducted a set of\nanalyses in which we compared the South to each of the other\nregions available in the NSFH (Northeast, Midwest, and West);\nwe found that the findings mirrored those comparing the South\nto all other regions combined.\nTraditionalism was assessed using two different constructs:\ngender ideology and religious participation. Previous work\nusing the NSFH has included these constructs (Sarkisian,\nGerena, & Gerstel, 2006). The gender ideology scale consisted\nof four items measuring the respondent's agreement (on a 5-\npoint Likert scale) with the following statements: (a) It is much\nbetter for everyone if the man earns the main living and the\nwoman takes care of the home and family, (b) preschool\nchildren are likely to suffer if their mother is employed, (c) it is\nall right for mothers to work full time when their youngest child\nis younger than 5 years, and (d) both the husband and the wife\nshould contribute to family income (a \u00bc .69 in the subsample\nused in this study).\nReligious participation was measured by frequency of\nattendance: 0 \u00bc never, 1 \u00bc less than once a month, 2 \u00bc once\na month, 3 \u00bc twice a month, 4 \u00bc three times a month, 5 \u00bc once\na week, 6 \u00bc more than once a week.\nControl Variables\nWe included six controls that have been found to affect\nrelations between parents and adult children--gender, race,\nproximity, child's marital status, child's age, and child's\neducational attainment. Respondent's gender was coded 0 \u00bc\nmale and 1 \u00bc female. Respondent's race was measured by three\nbinary variables: Black, Hispanic, and White. White was the\ncomparison category throughout the analysis. Proximity was\nmeasured in distance the child lived from the mother.\nCategories were (a) less than 1 mile, (b) 1 to 14 miles, (c) 15\nthan 120 miles away. Marital status was assessed as 1\u00bcmarried\nor 0 \u00bc not married. Child's age was measured in years.\nRespondent's educational attainment was assessed as 1 \u00bc less\nthan high school graduate, 2 \u00bc high school graduate, 3 \u00bc some\ncollege, and 4 \u00bc college graduate.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used ordinary least squares regression to assess the rela-\ntionship between region and contact, and between region and\ncloseness, between respondents and their mothers. We created\ninteraction terms for region and gender as well as for region and\nrace in order to test for subgroup variations by child's gender\nand race. We ran analyses using SPSS Version 14.\nRESULTS\nRegion and Emotional Closeness\nThe first two data columns of Table 1 present the analysis of\nfactors associated with emotional closeness. These analyses\nshow that Southerners reported greater emotional closeness\nwith their mothers, both in the first model and when we con-\ntrolled for traditionalism.\nOnly one measure of traditionalism influenced emotional\ncloseness to mothers. Children reporting more frequent re-\nligious attendance were closer to mothers. However, as noted\npreviously, this factor did not reduce the regional differences\nfound in children's relationships with their mothers.\nThe control variables were related to closeness as expected\nbased on other studies of parent\u00adchild relations using the\nNSFH. Adult children who were married, less educated, and\nBlack also reported greater closeness with mothers.\nRegion and Contact\nThe right-hand columns in Table 1 present the analysis of\nfactors associated with contact with mothers. The findings\nindicate that Southerners had more contact with their mothers\nthan did adult children in other regions (Model 3). This\nrelationship remained even when we included measures of\ntraditionalism in the equation (Model 4).\nAgain, consistent with other analyses using NSFH data,\ndaughters, younger children, children with higher levels of\neducation, and children who lived closer to their mothers had\ngreater contact.\nBecause studies have shown intergenerational affect and\ncontact to differ by race and gender, we thought it was im-\nportant to examine whether the patterns presented here were\naffected by these factors. In separate analyses, we included\ninteraction terms for both race and child's gender. None of\nthese analyses revealed any differences in the effects of region\nby race or gender.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study we examined whether there are regional\ndifferences in relationships between adult children and their\nmothers. The findings revealed consistent support for our\nhypotheses that adult children in the South are closer to and\nhave greater contact with their mothers. Furthermore, these\npatterns do not vary by child's gender or race.\nContrary to our expectations, the analysis did not indicate\nthat regional differences in contact and closeness could be\nexplained by traditionalism. Although the original associations\nwere reduced, the reductions were small and insignificant. This\npattern of findings provides strong support for several scholars'\nassertion that Southern culture is a broader constellation of\nsocial attitudes and behaviors than can be captured by specific\nconcepts such as gender-role attitudes or religiosity. Although\nmost research has emphasized these components of regional\ndifferences, writers about the South have argued that Southern\nculture goes beyond such specific issues to a broader con-\nscientiousness held by Southerners regarding their distinctive\nthat a distinctive Southern culture persists despite increases in\neducation and industrialization in the South (Hurlbert, 1989;\ncan be interpreted as suggesting that stronger intergenerational\nrelations are a component of Southern culture rather than\na separate phenomenon that can be explained by other dimen-\nsions of this cultural phenomenon. In fact, greater emphasis\nTable 1. Regional Differences in Closeness and Contact With Mother (N \u00bc 2,457)\nCloseness Contact\nVariable B (SE) b B (SE) b B (SE) b B (SE) b\non parent\u00adadult-child closeness and contact would be highly\nconsistent with the roles of both traditionalism and socia-\nbility in Southern culture. Furthermore, if intergenerational\nsolidarity is a component of Southern culture, we would not\nexpect that including other dimensions of this culture would\nsubstantially weaken the relationship between region and\nfamily cohesion.\nWe recognize that the present study is limited both by the\nrange of dimensions of intergenerational relations and by the\nparticular measures available. We hope that future research\nwill shed additional light on the issue of regional differences\nin intergenerational relations, including other dimensions of\nsolidarity such as support and attitude similarity. We also hope\nthat scholars will replicate the present study using other\nmeasures of affect. We believe that the measures available in\nthe NSFH may account for the relatively low variance ex-\nplained in our models. For example, the amount of variance\nexplained using more sensitive measures of closeness has been\nfound to be greater than that using the NSFH measure (Suitor &\nWe hope that future studies will examine whether the pat-\nterns of regional differences shown here are mirrored in adult\nchildren's relationships with their fathers. We posit that the\npatterns of greater closeness to mothers than fathers may differ\nin the South, particularly for sons. Some of the components of\nSouthern culture, such as an increased emphasis on hunting and\nmale activities that might increase closeness and contact\nbetween fathers and their adult sons (Nydegger & Mitteness,\n1991), thus muting the pattern of closer mother\u00adson than\nfather\u00adson bonds generally shown in the literature (Kaufman &\nIn summary, this study contributes to a growing literature\nindicating that there continues to be a distinct culture in the\nSouth compared to other regions of the country (Hurlbert, 1989;\n1995). Although traditionalism is a component of this cultural\nregional differences in adult children's relationships with their\nmothers remain even after controlling on other dimensions of\ntraditionalism suggests that Southern culture extends beyond\nmerely more traditional attitudes regarding gender and religion.\nIn fact, we suggest that greater intergenerational cohesion may\nbe yet another component of this cultural phenomenon. Finally,\nwe believe that the findings we have presented make a case for\nincluding region in studies of intergenerational relations\nwhenever this information is available.\n"
