This article examines\nchanges in the economic well-being of elderly women at wid-\nowhood in the United States and Germany. Design and\nMethods: Longitudinal data from the U.S. Panel Study of In-\ncome Dynamics and the German Socioeconomic Panel were\nused to prepare a sample of elderly widows. Economic well-\nbeing the year before the husband's death was compared with\neconomic well-being the year after the husband's death.\nResults: Although the prevalence of poverty is different in the\ntwo countries, most widows in both countries experienced a\ndecline in living standards, and many actually fell into poverty\nat widowhood. A fall in Social Security and pension income\nwas the largest contributor to the fall in living standards.\nImplications: The retirement income system in both countries\nseems to be adequate for married couples but appears to fail\nfor widows.\nKey Words: Widowhood, Social Security, Economic well-being\nPoverty rates among unmarried elderly women in\nthe United States are among the highest of any demo-\ngraphic group. In 1997, the poverty rate for unmar-\nried elderly women was 19% compared with a pov-\nerty rate of less than 5% for married elderly couples\n(see Appendix, Note 1). Unmarried women make up\nalmost 60% of the U.S. elderly poor while accounting\nfor only a third of the total elderly population (Na-\ntional Economic Council, 1998). One reason for the\nhigh poverty rate among elderly women in the United\nStates is their reliance on Social Security as a sole or\nmajor source of income. Social Security was never\nmeant to provide adequate income but rather to be a\nfoundation to be built on with pensions and savings.\nOn average, unmarried elderly women derive over\nhalf of their income from Social Security, and, for the\npoorest 40% of unmarried elderly women, Social Se-\ncurity accounts for over 75% of their total income\nNevertheless, Social Security is probably the most\neffective antipoverty program in the United States:\nPoverty rates of elderly people have fallen dramati-\ncally over the past 60 years since the program began\npaying benefits (Smolensky, Danziger, & Gottschalk,\n1988). Social Security plays a large role in reducing\nboth the poverty rate and the poverty gap among el-\nderly people and disabled people (Hungerford, 1996).\nHowever, it apparently is not as effective in prevent-\ning poverty among elderly women after the death of\na spouse or divorce (Burkhauser, Duncan, & Hauser,\nunmarried elderly women), some have proposed that\nSocial Security survivor benefits be increased and\nspouse benefits be lowered to shift income from a\ntime of low poverty risk to a time of high poverty risk\nSocial Security Advisory Council, 1997).\nA commonly accepted fact is that widowhood in-\ncreases the likelihood of being poor. Burkhauser,\nHolden, and Feaster (1988), using the Retirement\nHistory Study (RHS; see Appendix, Note 2), found\nthat for nonpoor older married women who eventu-\nally become widows, widowhood and a fall in non-\nwage income are the two events most associated\nwith a fall into poverty. Myers, Burkhauser, and\nthe RHS, found that poverty rates of women who be-\ncame widowed jumped dramatically after the deaths\nof their husbands. However, both studies also found\na correlation between economic status before and\nduring widowhood. Bound, Duncan, Laren, and\nOleinick (1991), using the Panel Study of Income Dy-\nnamics and a much wider distribution of ages, con-\ncluded that \"economic status prior to widowhood is\nthe strongest predictor of status during widowhood\"\n(p. 115). Obviously, the commonly accepted fact is\nonly part of the story.\nIn this article, I examine two issues related to the\ndeath of an elderly spouse and economic well-being.\nThe first issue deals with economic status before and\nafter the death of a spouse: Are elderly women who\nare poor after becoming widows poor before? The\nanswer to this question has important policy implica-\ntions. Will policy proposals to reduce the Social Se-\ncurity spouse benefit and raise the survivor benefit\nI thank Maria S.

The second issue is how the\nUnited States compares with a country that has a dif-\nferent philosophy toward social welfare programs.\nThis study differs from other studies in two important\nrespects: First, it examines living standards and in-\ncome before and after the death of an elderly\nwoman's husband. Second, it compares the United\nThe results show that in both the United States and\nGermany, most elderly women experienced a fall in\nliving standards at widowhood, and many fell into\npoverty. Also in both countries, poor widows were\nmuch more likely than other widows to be poor be-\nfore the deaths of their husbands. Last, a fall in Social\nSecurity and pension income was the primary con-\ntributor to the fall in income at widowhood. This arti-\ncle is organized as follows: The next section briefly\nexplains the retirement income systems in the two\ncountries. The third section describes the data used\nfor the analysis, and the results of the analysis are\npresented in the section that follows. Concluding re-\nmarks are offered in the final section.\nRetirement Income Systems in the United States\nand Germany\nThe World Bank (1994) argued that a multipillar\nsystem is necessary for income security in old age\nand that different pillars have different functions and\nshould have different levels of government involve-\nment. In the United States, these pillars are often re-\nferred to as the three legs of the retirement income\nstool: Social Security, pension income, and savings.\nGermany has a similar multipillar system for retire-\nment income.\nThe first pillar in both countries is Social Security,\nwhich is part of the social insurance system started in\nThere are many similarities in the Social Security sys-\ntems of the two countries. Social Security coverage is\nmandatory and nearly universal, and both systems\nare paid for by workers and their employers, al-\nthough the German system also receives some gov-\nernment subsidies. At retirement workers receive a\nSocial Security benefit based on lifetime earnings and\nage, but the benefit is progressive in that workers\nwith lower lifetime earnings receive a proportion-\nately higher benefit than workers with higher lifetime\nearnings, although workers with higher lifetime earn-\nings receive higher benefits. The German benefit\ntends to be much more generous than the U.S. bene-\nfit. B\u00f6rsch-Supan and Schnabel (1999) reported that\nthe German benefit replaces about 72% of preretire-\nment net earnings of a worker with average lifetime\nearnings, which is substantially higher than the 53%\nreplacement rate of the U.S. benefit for a worker with\naverage lifetime earnings.\nThere are also some significant differences be-\ntween the two countries' systems. In the United\nStates, the retired worker's spouse will receive a ben-\nefit based on the retired worker's earnings equal to\nup to 50% of the retired worker's benefit. However, if\nthe spouse has a substantial work history, he or she\nwill receive the higher of the spouse benefit or a re-\ntired worker benefit based on his or her own earnings\nand age. The German Social Security system does not\npay a spouse benefit, but women with some attach-\nment to the labor market (at least 15 years of work\nwith 10 years after age 40) will receive a benefit\nbased on their earnings and age (see Appendix, Note\n3). In the United States, after the death of the retired\nworker, the widow(er), if 60 years or older, receives a\nsurvivor's benefit equal to the retired worker's benefit\n(see Appendix, Note 4). In Germany, after the death\nof the retired worker, the survivor, if 45 years or\nolder, receives 100% of the deceased worker's bene-\nfit for 3 months and then 60% thereafter.\nOf the three pillars, Social Security is mandatory,\nwhereas the other two pillars (pensions and savings)\nare voluntary. Consequently, many people rely on\nthe first pillar as a sole source of income in old age\nbecause they were unable or unwilling to save and\nwere not covered by a pension plan while working.\nIndividuals in different parts of the income distribu-\ntion rely on different combinations of income sources.\nTable 1 shows that those elderly persons in the bot-\ntom decile of the income distribution in both coun-\ntries rely primarily on Social Security for income sup-\nport--about 70% of income comes from Social\nSecurity. At the other end of the distribution, Social\nSecurity is a fairly important source of income, but it is\nnot the only source. In both countries, earnings and\npension each contribute more toward income support\nthan Social Security for those in the top decile.\nData and Methods\nThe data sources for this study are the Panel Study\nof Income Dynamics (PSID) and the German Socio-\neconomic Panel (GSOEP). The PSID is a nationally\nrepresentative longitudinal data set of the U.S. popu-\nThe PSID interviewed a national sample of 4,800\nhouseholds in 1968, and the number interviewed has\ngrown to over 7,000 today. The replacement mecha-\nnism of the PSID for births is designed to yield a rep-\nresentative sample in each year.\nThe GSOEP is a longitudinal data set started in\n1984. The data are representative of the population\nTable 1. Shares of Aggregate Income of the Elderly by Income\nDecile, United States and Germany\nof the western states of the reunified Germany, in-\ncluding \"guest workers,\" and currently consists of\nover 6,000 households (Wagner, Burkhauser, & Beh-\nringer, 1993). The PSID methodology influenced the\ndevelopment of the GSOEP, and the methods for fol-\nlowing households are similar in the two samples.\nable (Burkhauser, Butrica, & Daly, 1995). The file\ncontains equivalently defined variables (to the extent\npossible) on income, employment, and demographic\ninformation from the PSID and the GSOEP. Also in-\ncluded are annual price indices for the two countries\nand median household annual income. The PSID\ndata contain information on over 7,000 households\nThe income measure used in the study was post-\ntransfer, pretax income. There were several reasons\nfor choosing this measure. First, it is the income mea-\nsure used in the United States for official poverty sta-\ntistics and is used by most researchers in poverty re-\nsearch. Second, tax information is not available in\nthe PSID file after 1991; thus, almost half of the sam-\nple would be unusable. Third, taxes in each data set\nare calculated on the basis of household characteris-\ntics rather than actual taxes paid by the household.\nFourth, if taxes were subtracted from income, not\nonly would income be lower but so too would the\npoverty thresholds (see Appendix, Note 5). House-\nhold income is adjusted to reflect the composition of\nthe household (household size and ages of house-\nhold members), using the detailed official U.S. equiv-\nalence weight (see Appendix, Note 6). People are\nranked on basis of the income of the household they\nlive in adjusted for household size and composition\n(see Appendix, Note 7).\nThe concept of poverty is different in the two\ncountries (Germany does not have an official poverty\nthreshold), consequently a comparable measure of\npoverty needed to be developed. I use two different\nthresholds in this article, but both are based on me-\ndian household income. The first is 35% of median\nequivalence-adjusted household income (denoted\nPOVLIN35); the second is 45% of median equivalence-\nadjusted household income (denoted POVLIN45).\nMedian income is determined for the entire PSID and\nGSOEP samples for each year. I chose a relative pov-\nerty threshold because an absolute measure (updated\nfor inflation) would fall further behind living stan-\ndards (measured by median income) during eco-\nnomic expansions. A relative measure has a fixed re-\nlationship to the standard of living, and changes in\nthe standard of living of elderly widows are the main\nfocus of this article. In the United States, it should be\nnoted, the poverty rate, using a relative threshold, is\ngenerally higher than the official poverty rate (Dan-\nziger, Haveman, & Plotnick, 1986). For the United\nStates, POVLIN35 yielded about the same level of\npoverty as the official U.S. measure when averaged\nover several years but did not track year-to-year changes.\nThis is because income and prices grow at different\nrates. POVLIN45 yielded a higher poverty rate on av-\nerage and in all years. This measure yielded poverty\nrates that were 42% (United States) and 75% (Ger-\nmany) greater than the 35% measure. I used POVLIN45\nbecause many researchers and policymakers (includ-\ning myself) believe that the U.S. official poverty\nthreshold is too low. Burkhauser and colleagues (1995)\nprovided a more detailed discussion of the differ-\nences between the United States and Germany re-\ngarding poverty.\nThe sample used in this study included all women\n58 years of age or older who were initially married\nand living with their husbands, who were living in a\nfamily receiving Social Security or pension income,\nand who were eventually widowed. Three years of\ndata were used in the study: Year t is the year of the\nhusband's death, Year t  1 is the year before wid-\nowhood (i.e., the women were married), and Year t \n1 is the year after the husband's death occurred.\nOnly Years t  1 and t  1 were compared because\nthe data files did not record when during the inter-\nview year (Year t) the death occurred. Furthermore,\nincome in the year of widowhood (Year t) may not be\ncomparable to the years before or after because\nlump-sum death benefits (e.g., life insurance) are of-\nten paid to widows and may temporarily increase in-\ncome. The final sample used contained data on 177\nwomen in Germany (see Appendix, Note 8) and 259\nwomen in the United States. Household weights\nwere used throughout the analysis.\nTable 2 reports some descriptive information on\nthe women in the sample. The age distribution in Pe-\nriod t  1 was similar in the two samples: The mean\nin both was about 71 years, and the range was from\nolder in Year t  1 and were therefore eligible to re-\nceive survivor benefits in both countries. Over 50%\nof the women in the German sample and 39% in the\nU.S. sample had less than a high school education.\nAnother major difference between the two samples\nwas that 22% of the women in the U.S. sample had\neducation past high school, and only 1% of women\nin the German sample had education past high\nschool. Part of this could be due to institutional dif-\nferences in educational systems in the two countries\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics of Panel Study of Income\nDynamics and German Socio-Economic Panel Samples\nCharacteristic United States Germany\nEducation (%)\nNote: Sample is weighted by household weights.\n(see Appendix, Note 9). Average household sizes in\nPeriod t  1 and in Period t  1 in the two countries\nwere roughly the same.\nThe method used in this article was a tabular anal-\nysis of poverty and income dynamics. The poverty\nmeasures examined were the poverty rate and the av-\nerage poverty gap. The poverty gap is the difference\nbetween the poverty threshold and household in-\ncome if the difference is positive and is equal to zero\notherwise. The income measures were income\nchanges and mobility within the income distribution.\nWhen examining income mobility, mobility refers to\nmovement within the distribution of the entire sam-\nple of households, not just the sample of elderly wid-\nows. Hypothesis tests were conducted for either Pe-\nriod t  1 to t  1 changes in each measure or for\nU.S.\u00adGerman differences in these measures.\nPoverty Dynamics\nPoverty dynamics in the two countries were sensi-\ntive to the poverty threshold used. Results for both\nolds are presented and discussed. Table 3 shows the\npoverty rate and poverty gap for Periods t  1 and t \n1 in both countries. The hypothesis tested was\nwhether the Period t  1 and the Period t  1 mea-\nsures were equal. The first half of the table presents\nthe results using POVLIN35, and the second half pre-\nsents the results using POVLIN45.\nThe period t  1 poverty rate for these women in\nthe United States was 12% and increased by 10 per-\ncentage points (almost doubling) to 22% in the year\nafter widowhood. This increase in poverty is statisti-\ncally significant at the 1% level. The average poverty\nbetween Period t  1 and Period t  1. When exam-\nining just widows who were poor in Period t  1,\ntwo points are worth emphasizing. First, the Period t \n1 average poverty gap of t  1 poor widows was\nmuch larger than the average poverty gap of the\nwhole sample (200% larger in the United States)--\nPeriod t  1 poor widows started out in Period t  1\n(when married) much poorer than most widows. Sec-\nond, the increase in the average poverty gap between\nPeriods t  1 and t  1 was particularly startling--\n350% in the United States (this increase was statisti-\ncally significant at the 1% level). In contrast, the pov-\nerty rate in Germany started out in Period t  1 at just\n3% and increased by 5.7 percentage points, or tri-\npled, in Period t  1. The increase in poverty gap in\nGermany at widowhood, however, was just as star-\ntling as the increase in the United States.\nThe second half of Table 3 presents the poverty re-\nsults using POVLIN45 as the threshold. The overall\nPeriod t  1 to Period t  1 dynamics in both coun-\ntries were pretty much the same, although the starting\npoverty rates and poverty gaps were much higher in\nboth countries. The results in the halves of Table 3\nsuggest that in both the United States and Germany\npoor widows started out from a more disadvantaged\nposition than nonpoor widows and become much\npoorer after the deaths of their husbands, although\nthere was a smaller proportion of poor widows in\nGermany.\nThe next table, Table 4, shows the distribution of\nincome in relation to the poverty threshold. The col-\numns in this table show the Period t  1 and t  1\ndistributions for the entire sample in both countries,\nplus the distribution in Period t  1 of those widows\nwho were poor in Period t  1 (labeled t  1 poor in\nt  1). The first half of the table shows the results\nwhen using POVLIN35 as the poverty threshold. The\nPeriod t  1 columns (a) reiterate the poverty rate\nresults shown in Table 3 and (b) show that most\nwomen who became widows were not concentrated\njust above the poverty threshold. Consequently, it was\nnot just small changes in income that pushed many of\nthese widows into poverty. Over half of these widows\nin the United States lived in households with income\nover double the poverty threshold. In addition, 17%\nof Period t  1 poor widows started out in Period t \n1 in households with income over twice the poverty\nthreshold. The column for Period t  1 shows that the\ndistribution generally shifted down toward the pov-\nerty threshold, but still nearly half of the widows had\nincome that was at least twice the poverty threshold.\nThe overall pattern in Germany was not that much\ndifferent than that in the United States.\nAs would be expected, with the POVLIN45 thresh-\nold poverty appeared to be much more persistent--a\nhigher proportion of Period t  1 poor widows were\npoor or near poor in Period t  1 (see bottom half of\nTable 4). In Period t  1, more U.S. women were\nconcentrated near the poverty threshold, and more\nwomen were below the poverty threshold. Fewer\nTable 3.

The results were even more\nstriking for the Period t  1 poor widows: over 40%\nwere poor in Period t  1, and another 20% were\nold) in the United States. In Germany, many of the\nsame qualitative results are evident. In addition, 28%\nof Period t  1 poor widows were poor in Period t \nPoverty transitions between Period t  1 and Pe-\nriod t  1 are shown in Table 5. When POVLIN35\nwas used (top half), three quarters of the women in\nthe U.S. sample were not poor in both Periods t  1\nand t  1 compared with 90% of the women in the\nGerman sample (the U.S.\u00adGerman difference was\nstatistically significant at the 1% level). Slightly less\nthan 10% in the United States and less than 3% in\nGermany were poor in both periods (again, the U.S.\u00ad\nGerman difference was statistically significant at the\n1% level). Even though a very small minority in each\ncountry were always poor, it turns out that in the\nUnited States 40% of Period t  1 poor widows were\npoor before widowhood in contrast to 29% of Period\nt  1 poor German widows. The results were qualita-\ntively similar when POVLIN45 was used (bottom half\nof Table 5).\nIncome Dynamics\nThe results on poverty dynamics in the previous\nsection show the proportion of elderly widows who\nmoved above or below a particular threshold. How-\never, these results do not provide much information\non how living standards changed more generally. Ta-\nble 6 shows how income changed for these women\nbetween Periods t  1 and t  1. The top two rows\nshow the median equivalent real household income\n(in 1991 currency units) for these women in Periods\nt  1 and t  1. Median real income decreased\nslightly in both countries. On the basis of these me-\ndian values, one might conclude that widowhood\nbrings a small change in living standards. The results\nTable 4.

The next rows in Table 6 show that the median\nfall in equivalent real income after the husband's\ndeath was 16%, and about two thirds of the widows\nexperienced a fall in equivalent real income in the\nUnited States. Almost 60% experienced a 10% or\ngreater fall in income, and almost 25% of these\nwomen experienced a 10% or more increase in\nequivalent real income after the deaths of their hus-\nbands. Although a similar proportion of German wid-\nows experienced a fall in income after widowhood,\nthe fall was not nearly as large as that of U.S. widows\n(the median decrease was 9%).\nAlthough Table 6 shows how income changed, it\ndoes not show which income changed. Elderly cou-\nples and widows receive income from several sources,\nall of which can change over time or after certain\nevents such as widowhood. For Table 7, each sample\n(U.S. and German) was split into three groups, based\non the percentage of change in equivalent real\nhousehold income (labeled %Inc in the table) be-\ntween Periods t  1 and t  1. Average income from\neach source for each group was then calculated for\nPeriod t  1 and Period t  1.\nFor the U.S. widows who experienced a large de-\ncline in income (at least a 10% fall; see Appendix,\nNote 10), the largest absolute change in income was\nretirement income (Social Security plus other in-\ncome; see Appendix, Notes 11 and 12), accounting\nfor about 44% of the total decrease in income. After\nretirement income (Social Security and pension in-\ncome), a fall in labor income was the second largest\nabsolute change. Most of the Period t  1 labor in-\ncome for these women was earned by the hus-\nbands--about 20% (most in part-time jobs) of the\nU.S. sample worked in Period t  1 (see Appendix,\nNote 13). The loss of the main breadwinner and a fall\nin Social Security and pension income accounted for\nthe lower living standards of many widows. To-\ngether, the change in labor income, Social Security\nincome, and other income accounted for 73% of the\nfall in income in the United States. In Germany, the\nfall in retirement income (i.e., Social Security) and la-\nbor income accounted for 94% of the fall in total in-\ncome. Either the retirement income system (Social\nSecurity and pensions) is failing a substantial number\nof widows in each country, or many families are not\nadequately preparing for retirement in both coun-\ntries.\nThe next group of widows was women experienc-\ning either a small decrease or a small increase (10%)\nin income. Generally, in both countries the change in\neach component of total income was fairly small,\nand only one of the t  1/t  1 differences (Social Se-\ncurity income in Germany) approached statistical sig-\nnificance (at the 10% level). The final group is the\nwomen who experienced a large (i.e., more than\n10%) increase in real equivalent household income\nat widowhood. Again, there were few differences be-\ntween the two countries. The single largest increase\nin income was in asset income (see Appendix, Note\n14). There are two possible reasons for the large in-\ncrease in this component of total household income.\nThe first source could be the annuitization of a large\nlife insurance distribution. The second source could\nbe an increase in the imputed rental value (equiva-\nlent) of owner-occupied housing, as ownership of\nthis asset is generally transferred to the widow (see\nNext, I examine how widowhood affects a woman's\nposition in the income distribution. Table 8 shows\nthe distribution of movement within the income dis-\nTable 7.

In both countries,\nabout 50% of widows lived in households in the\npoorest two income quintiles before they became\nwidows (see Appendix, Tables 1A and 2A). Further-\nmore, of the widows who started in the poorest two\nquintiles in Period t  1, the vast majority (86% in\nthe United States and 73% in Germany) remained in\nthe poorest two quintiles in Period t  1. Many wid-\nows were in the poorest 40% of the population be-\nfore their husbands' deaths, and most remained there\nafterward. Very few women actually moved up in the\nincome distribution (15% in the United States and\n27% in Germany). The proportions for quintile mo-\nbility in Table 8 were based on the number of\nwomen who could potentially move the number of\nquintiles indicated. For example, the proportion who\nmoved up two or more quintiles were those women\nwho started out in the bottom three quintiles of the\nincome distribution. In both countries, almost 45% of\nthe widows did not change their quintile position in\nthe income distribution. Roughly the same propor-\ntion of widows moved down one quintile in both the\nUnited States and Germany (35% and 30%, respec-\ntively). A larger proportion moved down two or more\nquintiles in the United States than in Germany, and\nthe difference was statistically significant at the 1%\nlevel. Interestingly, 25% of the women who could\nmove two or more quintiles did move two or more\nquintiles in Germany, compared with only 5% in the\nUnited States.\nConcluding Remarks\nWidowhood, in both the United States and Ger-\nmany, is a time of loss. Widows have lost not only\ntheir husbands but also, for many, their standard of liv-\ning. Many American and German women become\npoor at widowhood, and many American women\nare poor before widowhood and then become even\npoorer after the loss of their husbands. In Germany,\nwomen are two to three times more likely to be in\npoverty after the deaths of their husbands than when\nthey were married. In the United States, women who\nbecome widows are less than twice as likely to fall\ninto poverty after the deaths of their husbands. In addi-\ntion, many poor widows were poor before the deaths\nof their husbands. It must be emphasized, however,\nthat the poverty rate for elderly widows in the United\nStates was more than double the rate in Germany.\nMost widows in the United States and Germany\nexperienced a fall in real income after the deaths of\ntheir husbands. A fall in Social Security and pension\nincome was the largest contributor to the fall in total\nincome in both countries, and the loss of the hus-\nband's labor income was the second largest contribu-\ntor. But not all widows were worse off financially af-\nter the deaths of their husbands; one in four widows\nactually experienced a large rise in income (i.e., by\nover 10%), mostly due to an increase in asset income.\nThe German retirement income system appears\nmuch more effective than the U.S. system in keeping\nretired married couples out of poverty because Social\nSecurity benefits are more generous (taxes are also\nhigher, though). However, both the U.S. and German\nsystems are much less successful in maintaining the\nliving standards of women who become widows.\nThese results suggest that proposals in the United\nStates to reduce the spouse benefit and increase the\nsurvivor benefit would, for many, just transfer in-\ncome from a time of poverty to another time of pov-\nerty (see Appendix, Note 17). A policy to increase\nsurvivor benefits only or to increase means-tested\nbenefits could be effective in maintaining the living\nstandards of elderly widows, but program costs would\nnecessarily increase.\nReferences\nB\u00f6rsch-Supan, A., & Schnabel, R.

This 19% poverty rate is just slightly lower than the 20%\npoverty rate for children under 18 years.\n2. The RHS sample consists of women married to men born\n3. B\u00f6rsch-Supan and Schnabel (1999) noted that most wives\nreceive their own benefits.\n4. This assumes the widow(er) is not eligible for a higher Social\nSecurity benefit on the basis of his or her earnings record.\n5. The poverty threshold is based on median income.\nIncorporating taxes would change the income distribution\nsince taxes are progressive. The calculated poverty threshold\nwould be lower; consequently, the poverty rates in both\ncountries would also be lower. Taxes are more progressive in\nGermany than in the United States. However, based on a\nlimited analysis with the reduced data set the qualitative\nresults hold if taxes are incorporated, but in many instances\ncell sizes are very small.\n6. This equivalence weight is based on the official poverty\nthreshold in the United States and accounts for economies of\nscale by adjusting for both the size and the composition of\nthe family.\n7. An implicit assumption is that income is freely shared among\nhousehold members.\n8. No German guest workers were included in the sample\nbecause they are not eligible to receive Social Security\nbenefits.\n9. Burkhauser and colleagues (1995) reported that the\neducation variables are not entirely comparable between the\ntwo countries.\n10. This group accounted for almost 60% of the widows in the\nUnited States and almost 50% of the widows in Germany\n(see Table 6).\n11. From the income variable calculation appendix in the\ncodebook (Butrica & Jurkat, n.d.), Social Security income in\nGermany included income from Social Security pensions plus\nincome from employer or occupational old-age pensions. In\nthe U.S. sample, Social Security income included only\nincome from the Social Security Administration.\n12. Other income in the United States included employer\npension income as well as transfers from persons outside of the\nhousehold. In the German sample, other income included\nonly transfers from persons outside of the household.\n13. Of the households where women worked in Period t  1,\ntheir labor income accounted for 43% of total household\nlabor income in the United States.\n14. Asset income included income from assets plus the imputed\nrental value of owner-occupied housing. The imputed rental\nvalue of owner-occupied housing captures a cost that\nhomeowners do not incur and was considered as income.\n15. The imputed rental of owner-occupied housing most likely\nremains constant over Periods t  1 to t  1, but the\nequivalence factor becomes smaller after the husband's\ndeath. Consequently, the equivalent value of this income\nsource will increase after the husband's death.\n16. The transition matrices for both the United States and\nGermany are shown in Appendix Tables 1A and 2A. Income\nquintiles are defined for all households and are based on\nequivalent household income. Consequently, the rows and\ncolumns in Appendix Tables 1A and 2A do not necessarily\n17. It can also be argued that for families with high discount rates\na transfer of income (inflation adjusted) to the future would\nmake the family worse off.\nTable 1A.
