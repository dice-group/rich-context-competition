Disability measures among elderly non-Hispanic White populations have traditionally been associated\nwith activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). More recently, performance-\nbased measures have increasingly been used to predict the onset of disability in initially nondisabled elderly populations.\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) to assess the degree with which lower mobility performance measures\npredict future disability in a representative sample of older Mexican Americans from the Southwestern United States.\nResults. Performances on an 8-foot walk, repeated chair stands, and standing balance among nondisabled subjects at\nbaseline were significantly associated with the onset of ADL and lower body disability 2 years later, controlling for\nage, gender, and the presence of medical conditions. The results were significant for each performance measure and for\na measure combining all three.\nConclusion. This study offers further evidence that performance-based measures of lower body function are able to\npredict future disability in older Mexican Americans, as has been found with other elderly populations. These measures\nwere able to detect changes over a relatively short period of time (2 years). In addition, the study found that the short\n(8-foot) walk was the most sensitive measure in predicting future disability.\nS the ability to perform normal daily tasks diminishes\nwith advancing age (1-2), dependence on others may\nincrease. Reduced independence or loss of independence has\nbeen associated with certain medical conditions such as\nheart disease (3-4), obesity (9), and stroke (4,10); it has also\nbeen linked to future institutionalization and death (11-12).\nDisability among elderly people has traditionally been\nassociated with self-report measures that are grouped into\ntwo categories: activities of daily living (ADLs) and instru-\nmental activities of daily living (IADLs). In more recent\nyears, objective assessments of physical functioning have\nbecome more common in studies of older people (12,13).\nPerformance-based measures offer several advantages over\nself-reports including increased validity and reproducibility\n(14); less influence from culture, language, and education\n(14); and greater suitability in assessing function in both\ndisabled and nondisabled individuals. Thus, they provide\nphysicians with the ability to detect deteriorating physical\nfunction among nondisabled persons including the emer-\nGuralnik and colleagues (15) demonstrated that physical\nperformance measures provide useful preliminary knowl-\nedge about healthy elderly persons who report little to no\ndisability. Much of the performance-based research, how-\never, has focused on non-Hispanic White populations with\nlittle attention given to minorities. It is not entirely clear\nwhether elderly Mexican Americans will perform in a man-\nner comparable to non-Hispanic Whites (17). For example,\nMexican Americans report higher rates of certain chronic\nhealth conditions such as diabetes and obesity, which have\nbeen associated with greater disability.\nThis analysis attempts to replicate Guralnik and col-\nleagues' study (15), which found that simple performance-\nbased measures of lower mobility functioning predicted\nfuture disability in an elderly non-Hispanic White popula-\ntion. Our hypothesis is that lower mobility performance\nmeasures in nondisabled Mexican Americans aged 65 and\nolder will predict the onset of ADL- and mobility-related\ndisabilities over a 2-year period.\nMETHODS\npanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Stud-\nies of the Elderly (EPESE), a population-based study of\nfrom five Southwestern states: Texas, California, New\nMexico, Colorado, and Arizona (17). This study was mod-\neled after earlier EPESE surveys that began in the 1980s in\nNew Haven, CT, East Boston, MA, North Carolina, and\nrural Iowa (18). A multistage area probability sampling\ndesign was used, assuring a sample representative of at\nleast 85% of Mexican Americans aged 65 and older in the\nSouthwestern United States. The sample is generalizable to\nsons were reinterviewed in person and another 272 (8.9%)\npersons were reinterviewed by proxy. Of the remaining\n(8.9%) could not be located.\nThe present analyses included persons who reported no\nbaseline disability in ADLs--bathing, using the toilet,\ntransferring from bed to chair, and walking across a small\nroom--and reported that they were capable of walking a\nhalf mile and climbing stairs without help. At baseline\nof whom 1,365 completed the follow-up 2 years later\nchronic conditions, 496 (36%) reported one chronic condi-\nported three or more conditions out of a possible four (heart\nproblems, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis).\nAssessment.--Lower mobility function for this group of\nnondisabled elderly Mexican Americans was assessed with\nthree independent measures: timed repetitive chair stands, a\ntimed walk across a small room (8-foot walk), and standing\nbalance (12,15). The 8-foot walk was timed twice to the\nnearest second with the faster of the two walks used for\nscoring purposes. Scores for the sample were divided into\nquartiles. A timing of > 9.0 sec received a score of 1; 6.0 to\nsec a score of 4.\nScores for the five timed repetitive chair stands were cal-\nculated to the nearest tenth of a second among those who\ndemonstrated that they were first capable of standing once\nfrom a sitting position with arms folded across their chest.\nThese scores were also divided into quartiles, with a score\nof 1 assigned to those who completed the task in > 16.5 sec,\nThe standing balance test included three tasks of increas-\ning difficulty. To advance to the next level of difficulty, the\npreceding level needed to be successfully completed. The\nfirst task required individuals to stand with their feet in a\nside-by-side position; the second task asked participants to\nstand with their feet in a semi-tandem position in which the\nheel of one foot was placed beside the big toe of the other\nfoot; the third task required a tandem position in which the\nheel of one foot was placed directly in front of the other\nfoot. A score of 1 was recorded if both the side-by-side\nposition and the semi-tandem position were held success-\nfully for 10 sec; a score of 2 if the tandem position was\nheld for greater than 2 sec and less than 10 sec; and a score\nof 3 if the tandem position was held for 10 sec.\nIn addition, an overall lower body function score was\ncalculated by summing the three individual scores--8-foot\nwalk, chair stands, and balance test. Total summed scores\nfor individuals ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 11.\nA tiered performance scale for each performance mea-\nsure was used to group the nondisabled elderly Mexican\nAmericans at baseline into one of three categories at fol-\nlow-up: (a) no disability; (b) mobility-related disability\nonly (the inability to walk a half mile or climb stairs with-\nout help); or (c) ADL disability (with or without mobility-\nrelated disability).\nThe Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistic was used to test\nthe bivariate association between lower mobility perfor-\nmance at baseline and disability at follow-up. A multiple\nlogistic regression analysis was used to assess the associa-\ntion of each individual performance measure and of the\ntotal performance score with disability at follow-up adjust-\ning for age, sex, and number of chronic conditions. All sta-\ntistical analyses used the SAS statistical software package.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the association of the three lower mobility\nperformance measures at baseline with disability at the 2-\nyear follow-up. Persons with higher scores on the 8-foot\nwalk or repeated chair stands were less likely to report dis-\nability at follow-up compared to those with lower scores.\nSimilar trends were evident for the standing balance perfor-\nmance measure. Individuals who were more successful at\nbaseline were more likely to be disability-free at follow-up,\nwhereas those who encountered more difficulty with the\nbaseline task were more likely to experience ADL- and/or\nmobility-related disability at follow-up.\nTable 2 shows the results of separate logistic regression\nanalyses of ADL and mobility-related disability at follow-\nup, by performance on the timed 8-foot walk, chair stands,\nand standing balance. The table shows a linear association\nbetween performance on the timed walk and subsequent\ndisability. For example, the odds of becoming ADL-depen-\ndent over the 2-year period were 5.4 for those in category 1\npared to category 4 (fastest). The respective odds were 3.4,\n2.6, and 2.1 for mobility-related disability. Performance on\nthe repeated chair stands was also associated linearly with\nsubsequent disability; however, the association was not as\nstrong as for the timed walk. A similar relationship was\nfound between performance on standing balance and ADL-\nor mobility-related disability at follow-up. However, the\nincreased odds for disability associated with poorer perfor-\nmance on standing balance were not always significant,\npossibly because this variable is so highly skewed.\nAs also reported by Guralnik and colleagues (15), scores\non the three individual measures were summed to provide a\ncombined scale. Higher scores indicate better performance,\nwith a score of 9--11 used as the reference in the logistic\nregression analysis given in Table 3. For both models the\nodds of ADL- or mobility-related disabilities 2 years later\nincreased as scores decreased. For example, the odds of\nbeing ADL-dependent were 6.2 among those in the lowest\nsummary performance category, and 2.0 among those in the\n5 to 8 summary performance category. The odds of mobil-\nity-related disability with a summary score of 1 to 4 was\nDISCUSSION\nOlder Mexican Americans represent a unique and rapidly\ngrowing segment of the population, but there is relatively\nlittle health information available on this group.

Separate logistic regression models showed\nthat all three measures employed (8-foot walk, repeated chair\nstands, and standing balance) were good predictors of both\nADL- and mobility-related disabilities over 2 years. In addi-\ntion, our composite measure combining the three exhibited a\nstrong linear association with subsequent disability.\nPerhaps of greater interest, the 8-foot walk appeared to\nbe an especially good indicator of future disability. Odds of\nincreasing magnitude for both ADL- and mobility-related\ndisabilities were associated with increased time to complete\nthe 8-foot walk. A similar result was reported in the Inter-\nvention study of Elderly in Goteborg (IVEG), Sweden (19),\nin which walking speed was the only measure that pre-\ndicted dependence in ADLs for both elderly men and\nwomen. Thus, this single measure may be useful for clini-\ncians in assessing and predicting future disability among\nelderly persons. In contrast, it appears that the least effec-\ntive measure in predicting disability is the standing balance.\nHoeymans and colleagues (20) have also shown that the\nstanding balance test may not be a good performance mea-\nsure for elderly people.\nDespite the short length of follow-up in the present study\n[2 years vs 4 in the Guralnik et al. study (15)], we were\nable to detect significant changes in disability status at fol-\nlow-up. This is important because the disability process in\nsome elderly individuals has been shown to be reversible\nwhen in an early and acute stage (19). Over time, however,\nminor disabilities often become more severe or increase in\nnumber, and, in turn, may lead to loss of independence\n(21). Loss of independence is a major determinant of need\nfor supportive services such as nursing home care (22),\nhospitalization (21), institutionalization (23), and ultimately\nThe concept of preclinical disability has been described\nby Fried et al. (25), who defined it as a time of increasing\nimpairment or disability in the absence of any recognition\nof loss of performance by the individual. Thus, mobility-\nrelated performance measures appear to be useful in iden-\ntifying older persons who are at an increased risk of be-\ncoming disabled and perhaps dependent on others for\nassistance. If disability can be delayed through timely inter-\nventions such as physical activity, which can maintain and\nTable 2.

Information collected from these individ-\nuals may be beneficial in helping others prevent, delay, or\neven reverse their disability. In addition, more precise mea-\nsures could be developed that will be able to detect future\ndisability and that can also be administered as part of a\nclinical examination. With improved diagnostic measure-\nment instruments and increased awareness by physicians of\nthe relevance of these measures, earlier detection of clinical\ndisability can be achieved. Better detection in turn may\nhelp to lessen future disability and add to the number of\ndisability-free years among elderly people.\n"
