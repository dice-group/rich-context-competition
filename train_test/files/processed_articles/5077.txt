    "abstract": "Abstract\nNumerous studies have examined the association between pharmacogenetic effects and the\nresponse to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with asthma. In fact, several single nucleotide\npolymorphisms of a number of candidate genes have been identified that might influence the clinical\nresponse to ICS in children with asthma. Their direct or indirect effects depend on their role in the\ninflammatory process in asthma or the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids, respectively.\nAmong the genes identified, variants in T-box 21 (TBX21) and Fc fragment of IgE receptor II\n(FCER2) contribute indirectly to the variability in the response to ICS by altering the inflammatory\nmechanisms in asthma, while other genes such as corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1\n(CRHR1), nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1), stress induced phosphopro-\ntein 1 (STIP1), dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), glucocorticoid induced 1 (GLCCI1), histone\ndeacetylase 1 (HDAC), ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3), and vascular\nendothelial growth factors (VEGF) directly affect this variability through the anti-inflammatory\nmechanisms of ICS. The results to date indicate various potential genetic factors associated with\nthe response to ICS, which could be utilized to predict the individual therapeutic response of\nchildren with asthma to ICS. Clinical trials are underway and their results are greatly anticipated.\nFurther pharmacogenetic studies are needed to fully understand the effects of genetic variation on\nthe response to ICS in children with asthma.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam National\nUniversity, Hanoi, Vietnam\n2Department of Immunology, Allergology, and\nRheumatology, National Hospital of Paediatrics, Hanoi,\nVietnam\n3Department of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey,\n4Department of Pulmonology, Hospital Cochin, Paris\nDescartes University, Paris, France\n5Department of Respiratory Diseases, Medical-Biological\nResearch Centre, Lam Dong Medical College, Dalat,\nVietnam\nCorresponding author:\nSy Duong-Quy, Department of Respiratory Diseases,\nMedical-Biological Research Centre, Lam Dong Medical\nEmail: sduongquy.jfvp@gmail.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

About 50% of patients with\nasthma have the initial symptoms from\nchildhood.1 One of the key pathogenic\ncharacteristics of asthmatic children is\nchronic inflammation in the airways. Anti-\ninflammatory drugs are therefore the usual\ntreatment of choice and they are recom-\nmended by many international asthma man-\nagement guidelines.2 Children with asthma\nare recommended to use inhaled corticoster-\noids (ICS), bronchodilators (short- or long-\nacting beta-agonists), antileukotrienes, or\nanticholinergics for those more than 12\nyears old;2 and immunotherapy is recom-\nmended in some severe cases.3 To date,\ncorticosteroids are known to be one of the\nmost effective ways to treat inflammation for\nchildren with persistent asthma and for\npreventing airway remodelling.4 However,\nthere is evidence that some asthmatic chil-\ndren do not respond when using ICS.5\nPrevious studies have suggested that\n60\u00ad80% of asthma patients have different\nresponses due to genetic factors.6 The results\nfrom pharmacogenetic studies have demon-\nstrated the correlation between candidate\ngenes and drug responses, for example\nadrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB2), corticotropin\nreleasing hormone receptor 2, and arginase 1\nencoding for different responses to beta-2\nagonists; arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, leu-\nkotriene A4 hydrolase, leukotriene C4 syn-\nthase, and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2\nfor affecting the response to leukotriene\nantagonists; and corticotropin releasing hor-\n(TBX21), and Fc fragment of IgE receptor\nII (FCER2) for response to ICS.5,7\u00ad9 This\nreview summarizes the results of studies on\ngenetic factors in the modulating corti-\ncotherapy effects in children with asthma.\nOverview of airway inflammation\nin asthmatic children\nAsthmatic children are particularly recog-\nnized by inflammation in the airway, bron-\nchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and\nreversibility of airway obstruction.10 Many\ninflammatory and structural cells and\ninflammatory mediators are involved in the\ndisease processes in asthmatic children.11\nNegative impacts on the airways caused by\npathogens induce structural changes of the\nairways or remodeling.12 These changes are\nresponsible for the persistent clinical symp-\ntoms such as a chronic refractory cough and\ndyspnoea. It is also a common cause for\nbronchoconstriction and severe dyspnoea\nduring and after exercise.\nMechanism of airway inflammation\nin asthmatic children\nIn children with asthma, the inflammation is\ninitiated by infiltration of allergens into the\nlower airway, which are taken up by den-\ndritic cells (DC).13 DC process allergens to\npeptides and present the peptides to nai\u00a8ve T\ncells, and in a suitable environment the nai\u00a8ve\nT cells develop into type 2 helper T (Th\n2 cells produce cytokines such as\ninterleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, stimulating B\nlymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin\n(Ig)E; IL-3 and IL-5, attracting eosinophils\nto the lungs; and IL-4 and IL-9, which\nstimulate mast cell hyperplasia.14 Under\nthe influence of Th\n2 cells, B lymphocytes\nsecrete IgE, which is a key factor in allergic\nasthma because it activates mast cells\n(Figure 1). With exposure to the specific\nallergens that individuals are sensitized to,\nmast cells, secondary to binding of allergens\nto IgE, release histamine and start to\nproduce prostaglandin D2 and cysteinyl-\nleukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4),\nwhich attract inflammatory cells to the\nlungs.11 The early phase of asthma is sec-\nondary to the effects of histamine and other\nmediators released from mast cells, while the\ndelayed effect is secondary to other inflam-\nmatory cells and the release of mediators.\nMolecular mechanism of inflammation\nin asthmatic children\nAs in adults, the molecular mechanism of\ninflammation in asthmatic children is char-\nacterized by increasing various inflamma-\ntory genes controlled by proinflammatory\ntranscription factors, such as nuclear\nfactor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1\n(AP1).15 Both NF-kB and AP1 are activated\nby mediators, including cytokines, tumour\nnecrosis factor-a, IL-1b, and other factors\n(Figure 2).14 There are many coactivators\nthat also participate in the activation and\nrepression of inflammatory genes through\nacetylating the core histones.4 As a result,\ninflammatory proteins or enzymes and other\nproteins are synthesized and their produc-\ntion can influence inflammation in asthma.16\nAnti-inflammatory mechanisms\nof corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are synthesized and secreted\nby the cortex of the adrenal gland as a result\nof stimulation by the hypothalamus\u00adpituit-\nary\u00adadrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is\nresponsible for the adaptation to stress and\ninflammatory stimuli. This response is char-\nacterized by a hypothalamic release of\nFigure 1.

Hypothalamic\nCRH acts by combining with the CRH\nreceptor (CRHR), predominantly CRH\nreceptor 1 (CRHR1) (Figure 3). When\nCRH combines with CRHR1 on the anter-\nior pituitary gland, ACTH is released and\nthen binds to melanocortin 2 receptors on\nthe adrenal cortex to stimulate cortisol\nBoth endogenous and exogenous cortico-\nsteroids act effectively by combining with a\ncytoplasmic receptor known as the gluco-\ncorticoid receptor (GR). Two isoforms of\nthe GR exist, GRa and GRb, of which only\nGRa can bind ligand.18 GRs are expressed\nin most types of cells with different modular\nstructures.19 A protein complex including\nbinds the inactive GR. While HSP70 inacti-\nvates GR through partial unfolding, HSP90\nreverses this inactivation, and is required for\nactivation of the GR. The nuclear localiza-\ntion of the activated GR\u00adsteroid complex\ntakes place when the ligand combines with\nGR-HSP90 complexes. GR homodimers\nbind to glucocorticoid response elements\n(GREs) in the promoter region of steroid-\nsensitive genes, by which the anti-inflamma-\ntory proteins, such as annexin-1, secretary\nleucocyte protease inhibitor, MAPK\nNF-kB, inhibitor of kappa B alpha, IL-10\nand glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper\ncan be encoded.19 Less frequently, GR\nhomodimers prevent genes from being\nencoded by combining with negative\nGREs, especially those relating to cortico-\nsteroid side-effects.4 Proinflammatory\ntranscription factors like NF-kB or\nAP1 activate coactivator molecules, like\nFigure 2.

With regard to the response to ICS,\nthe genetic factors in question may be\ncategorized into three groups: (i) the proin-\nflammatory mechanisms of asthma; (ii) the\nanti-inflammatory mechanisms of cortico-\nsteroids; and (iii) a group with unclear\nmechanisms.\nGenetic factors and inflammation\nin asthma\nThe transcription factor T-bet (also known\nas T-box 21 or Tbx21 protein) encoded by\nthe TBX21 gene acts as a type 1 helper T cell\ndevelopment regulator by inducing inter-\nferon-g production and inhibiting Th\nkines (Figure 1).22 Previous research has\nshown that knockout mice lacking T-bet\ndeveloped BHR and other changes consist-\nent with asthma, including peribronchial\ninflammation and collagen deposited in the\nbasement membrane.23 ICS also modify\nBHR in asthma patients and it's efficacy\nA correlation between the single nucleo-\nreported in children,23 which was also seen\nin another study in adults.22 Changes in\nTBX21 expression in asthmatic children\nwas previously demonstrated, in which the\nwhich codes for glutamine (33Q), was\nassociated with a dramatic improvement in\nthe PC(20) (a measure of airway responsive-\nness) in the ICS-treated group (Table 1).24\nHowever, this was not replicated in a study\nthat genotyped four genes (ADRB2, adenyl-\nate cyclase 9, neurokinin receptor 2, and\nmild-to-moderate asthma; after 4 weeks of\ntreatment with ICS, there was a correlation\nbetween the control of asthma and the high\nfrequency of the major C allele in TBX21\nThe FCER2 gene\nThe Fc fragment of IgE receptor II (FCER2)\ngene, which encodes the low-affinity recep-\nmediated immune responses when activated\n(Figure 1).27 In patients with asthma, high\nIgE levels cause acute exacerbations,28 emer-\ngency consultations,29,30 and hospitaliza-\nto be associated with higher IgE levels and\nincreased severe exacerbations in children\nwith asthma treated with ICS (Table 1).26\nA study that aimed to identify predictors of\na poor response to ICS during long-term\ntherapy, evaluated 17 phenotypic variables\nand polymorphisms of the FCER2 and\ntreated with budesonide during the\nChildhood Asthma Management Program\n(CAMP) clinical trial by comparing recur-\nrent exacerbations and lung function.33 The\nresults showed that both a poor lung func-\ntion response and repeated exacerbations\nwere caused only by the FCER2 gene muta-\ntion.33 Children that were homozygous for\n3.3-times higher risk of recurrent exacerba-\ntions and a 3.9-times higher risk of poor\nlung function than the wild-type homozy-\nData from two cohort studies undertaken\nin the Netherlands, which included 386\nchildren in the Pharmacogenetics of Asthma\nmedication in Children: Medication with\nANti-inflammatory effects study and 939\nchildren in the BREATHE study, were used\nto analyse the effect of the FCER2 gene\nT2206C variant on acute asthma exacerba-\ntions, symptoms and treatment.34 The results\nshowed that the T2206C variant was asso-\nciated with a higher risk of asthma-related\nTable 1.
