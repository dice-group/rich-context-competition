Demographic and drug susceptibility data were retrieved from TB\ntreatment cards. Univariate logistic analysis was used to assess the association between risk factors\nand MDR\u00adTB.\nResults: Among the 3552 patients who were smear positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB),\nresistant TB isolates were detected from 25 newly treated and 50 previously treated patients. In\ntotal, 215 (6.1%) patients were infected with a poly-resistant strain of MTB. Previously treated\npatients and older patients were more likely to develop MDR\u00adTB.\nConclusions: The study showed a high prevalence of MDR\u00adTB among the study population.\nHistory of previous TB treatment and older age were associated with MDR\u00adTB.\n",

MDR\u00adTB\nstrains are resistant to isoniazid and rifam-\npin, the standard, first-line drug treatments\nfor TB; and XDR\u00adTB stains are resistant\nto isoniazid and rifampin, at least one\nfluoroquinolone and any of the second-line\ninjectable treatments (i.e. amikacin, capreo-\nmycin, kanamycin).3 The World Health\nOrganization (WHO) estimated that in\nMDR\u00adTB worldwide and approximately 1.9\nmillion associated deaths.4 Moreover, com-\npared with drug-susceptible TB, treatment\nfor MDR\u00adTB and XDR\u00adTB can cost up to\n25 times more and take three times longer to\nbe effective.5,6 Importantly, only approxi-\nmately 20% of MDR\u00adTB cases are correctly\ndiagnosed and the strains are highly\ntransmissible.7\ncases in 2014, China has the largest number of\nTB and MDR\u00adTB cases in the world.4\nHowever, the drug resistance rate estimated\nby the WHO is inadequate for TB control for\nChina.1 Therefore, a study was conducted to\ndetermine the prevalence and characteristics\nof drug-resistant TB in a specific region in\nChina with the aim of providing more accur-\nate data on TB surveillance. Data from a TB\ncentre in Dalian, a coastal city in the north-\neast of China with approximately 7 million\ninhabitants and a growing number of\ndrug-resistant TB cases, were used to analyse\ndrug-resistant TB and identify potential risk\nfactors, especially for MDR\u00adTB.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design and patient population\nThis was a retrospective review of data from\nTB patients attending TB treatment clinics in\nDalian, Liaoning Province, China between\ncharacteristics and details of drug suscepti-\nbility tests were retrieved from TB treatment\ncards and recorded by three researchers\n(X.T.L., X.Y.S., and X.W.L.). Newly treated\npatients were defined as those who had either\nnever received anti-TB treatment or had\nreceived treatment for less than 1 month.\nPreviously treated patients were defined as\nthose who had received treatment for more\nthan 1 month.1 The retrospective nature of\nthis study and that it used anonymized data\nmeant that it did not require ethical commit-\ntee approval or patient consent.\nMicrobiological methods\nTwo sputum samples had been collected\nfrom each patient with suspected TB. One of\nthe samples, usually the first unless it was of\npoor quality, was used for culture. Smear\nmicroscopy and culture had been performed\nby a local laboratory while drug resistance\ntesting had been conducted at a specialist\ncentre. The Ziehl\u00adNeelsen stain was used to\nconfirm the presence of acid-fast bacilli in\nsputum smears. Positive smear samples\nwere then cultured on Lo\n\u00a8 wenstein\u00adJensen\n(LJ) culture medium with and without\np-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB). Growth of\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is\ninhibited by PNB, whereas non-tuberculosis\nmycobacteria (NTM) are resistant.\nIncubation was at 37 C for up to 8 weeks\nand the cultures were checked weekly for the\ngrowth of mycobacteria. Samples contain-\ning NTM were excluded from the study.\nDrug susceptibility testing was performed\non LJ medium impregnated with isoniazid\n(INH), rifampin (RIF), streptomycin (SM),\nethambutol (EMB), ofloxacin (OFL) and\nkanamycin (KM) according to the propor-\ntion method as recommended by the WHO.8\nThe concentrations of anti-TB drugs used\n2 mg/l for EMB, 4 mg/l for SM, 2 mg/l for\nOFL, and 2 mg/l for KM. Any drug-\nresistant TB was defined as resistance to any\nof the anti-TB drugs among the six drugs\nrecommend by the WHO (i.e. INH, RIF,\nEMB, SM, OFL or KM).4 Mono-resistance\nwas defined as resistance to only one drug and\npoly-resistance was defined as resistance to\ntwo or more drugs excluding INH and RIF.\nStatistical analyses\nData analyses were performed using IBM\nSPSS software, version 19.0, for Windows\u00d5\n(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Between\ngroup comparisons were made using 2-test\nand univariate logistic regression analysis\nwas performed to assess the association\nbetween several risk factors and MDR\u00adTB.\nA P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate\nstatistical significance.\nResults\nIn total, 3552 smear positive patients were\nincluded in this retrospective study of\nnew TB cases and 998 were previously\ntreated patients.

For example, the propor-\ntion of previously treated patients with\nMDR\u00adTB was approximately four times\ngreater than that of newly treated patients\nresults of a univariate logistic regression\nanalysis also showed that a history of pre-\nvious treatment and older age were the most\nsignificant factors associated with MDR\u00ad\nTB.

Thus, the timely\ndetection of drug resistance is of great\nimportance in order to optimize patient\ntreatment and to inform infection control\nmeasures designed to block the transmission\nof MDR\u00adTB. Further work is required to\nunderstand the social and environmental\ndeterminants that contribute to high trans-\nmission rates. Moreover, a systematic study\non the relationship between genotype and\ndrug resistance is needed.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
