Building on\nextensive fieldwork at print and online news media outlets on the island and 14 in-\ndepth interviews with reporters, editors, and news bloggers, this article shows that\nconstructive journalism practices are widespread in St. Maarten. These are based\non ideals of contributing to economic development, engagement and belonging, and\nsocial stability. The fieldwork, however, also revealed skepticism toward constructive\njournalism practices because of local political, economic, and socio-cultural constraints.\nThis skepticism parallels broader critiques on active and involved forms of journalism,\nthrowing up questions about the meaning and feasibility of a `constructive' role of\njournalists in young, postcolonial democracies. This article argues that local constraints\non St. Maarten journalism undermine the normative underpinnings of constructive\njournalism and calls for more disruptive journalism to serve the local community.\n",

In this article,\nI explore how constructive journalism is practiced, adjusted, and contested in the local\njournalism context of St. Maarten,1 part of a binational Dutch and French Caribbean\nisland that attained an autonomous country status in the Kingdom of the Netherlands in\n2010. Drawing on participatory observation and interview material collected during\n10months of fieldwork on the role of newspapers, news websites, and social media2 in the\nisland communities of St. Maarten (and Cura\u00e7ao) in 2015 and 2016, this article provides\ninsights into how and why constructive journalism is practised in this local Caribbean\ncommunity. Moreover, by taking the local political, economic, and socio-cultural context\ninto account, this article aims to contribute to more contextualized and localized knowl-\nedge about the potentials and problems of constructive journalism practices.\nSt. Maarten represents a pertinent case study of constructive journalism in a local\nmedia context. Similar to those of other small Caribbean islands, St. Maarten's media\nlandscape is deeply connected to the community and, thereby, experiences the vulner-\nabilities that might result from personal involvements, such as political affiliation and\nemerging from current local journalism realities to alter journalistic practices and to\nrethink the traditional watchdog role of journalism in local communities (Firmstone,\nResearch on constructive journalism has primarily been located in and focused on\nNorth-Western European and the US media landscapes and traditions (an exception is\nMcIntyre and Sobel, 2017). To venture beyond this, we urgently need to study con-\nstructive journalism in other parts of the world, especially in young democracies that\ncontinuously struggle with political and socio-cultural realities inherited from a colo-\nnial past, such as in the case on St. Maarten. In these postcolonial contexts, similar\nforms of journalism \u00ad such as community, civic, and development journalism \u00ad have\nbeen developed, practiced, and criticized. This article takes perceptions on and prac-\ntices of these more active and involved journalistic approaches into account, and thus\nresponds to McIntyre and Sobel's (2017) call `that more work needs to be done to\nprecisely define and measure the concept [of constructive journalism] and distinguish\nit from similar forms of journalism' (p. 6).\nBuilding on the theory of and critical responses to constructive journalism in relation\nto other active, involved approaches to journalism, the following questions are posed:\nhow and why did St. Maarten journalists in 2015 and 2016 practice constructive journal-\nism? and how can these practices be critically understood in the local, postcolonial con-\ntext of St. Maarten?\nConstructive journalism in an international context\nConstructive journalism has been defined as `an emerging form of journalism that\ninvolves applying positive psychology techniques to news work in an effort to create\nmore productive, engaging stories while holding true to journalism's core functions'\n(McIntyre, 2015: 9). In addition to its watchdog role, constructive journalism `can hold\npower to account (...) by fostering conversation, collaboration, consensus building and\nchallenging power to be proactive in providing solutions' (Constructive Journalism\nRotmeijer 3\nProject, 2017). Whereas constructive journalism is unique in applying specific positive\npsychology techniques to news stories, such as inclusion of positive emotion and infor-\nmation about potential solutions (McIntyre, 2015: 19), its aim to actively participate in\nenhancing societal well-being (Gyldensted, 2015) builds on a tradition of more active\nand involved approaches to journalism, such as `community journalism' or `civic jour-\nConcerns about constructive journalism have primarily been directed toward the\nactive, involved approach these forms of journalism share and the possible news bias\nresulting from a close association with communities. Critique on civic and community\njournalism included their presumed lack of `objectivity, accuracy and ability to shape a\nshared public consciousness'(Romano, 2010: 22). Similar concerns have been expressed\nthat constructive journalism `risks watering down news and undercutting the accounta-\nbility role of journalists' (World Editors Forum, 2016). This would be a risk, `especially\nin contexts like new democracies (...), where governments often make demands for the\nmedia to support rather than criticise them' (World Editors Forum, 2014).\nThis particular concern has also been expressed in reaction to the emergence of `devel-\nopment journalism'among developing nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas in the late\n1960s. Influenced by processes of decolonization, development journalism emerged as a\nnew journalistic approach aiming at `counteracting the dependency relationship of coloni-\nalism and promoting (...) institutions supporting the new nation state'(Domatob and Hall,\neconomic development, providing constructive critique on governments, and solution-ori-\nented reporting (pp. 358\u00ad362). Despite its popularity, researchers have stressed the dangers\nwhen governments use development journalism to either restrict news (Storr, 2016: 18) or\nuse the media for own political goals. Postcolonial democracies have been particularly\nvulnerable to the latter, as local elites have used development journalism to consolidate and\nperpetuate their power reproducing `the same motivations that governed the colonial pow-\nDespite similar key components and techniques to development journalism, construc-\ntive journalism's proponents stress that it is not `government influenced development\njournalism' (Constructive Journalism Project, 2017). Constructive journalism stays true\nto journalism's core functions, including holding government accountable and monitor-\ning the ones in power. Yet, critics raise concerns that constructive journalism `avoids\npolitically controversial stories' (Yanqiu and Matingwina, 2016: 94) and is at risk of\nbeing exploited by local elites (Wasserman, 2017: 196). In their recently published\nresearch on constructive journalism in Rwanda, McIntyre and Sobel (2017) do not coun-\nter these concerns. They argue that in particular contexts the aim of constructive journal-\nism supersedes serving as a watchdog:\njournalists (...) pointed to the difficulty in playing the watchdog role in Rwanda, and even a\njournalist at the most independent news outlet in the country considered the idea that perhaps\nunity is a more important goal given the country's history. (McIntyre and Sobel, 2017: 18)\nHowever, as previous research on development journalism shows, constructive jour-\nnalism's aims of enhancing `societal well-being', `unity', and `development' may be\nused to restrict and repress news media, especially in young postcolonial democracies,\nsuch as St. Maarten, to which I now turn.\nSt. Maarten's media landscape: Cultural and historical\ncrossroads\nTogether with the French collectivity of Saint Martin in the north, the southern part of St.\nMaarten forms an island located in the North-Eastern Caribbean. Its binational status\nreflects the colonial history of the island. In 2010, St. Maarten seceded from the\n`Netherlands Antilles', governed by a central government in Cura\u00e7ao, to become an\nautonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The island has since faced\nongoing political instability, reflected in governmental crises, six different cabinets, and\naccompanied by issues of political corruption. In 2010, governmental institutions were\nnot yet in place and remain weak today. The Netherlands continues to be responsible for\ngood governance and financial affairs in the non-sovereign country. In 30\nyears, St.\nnumber increases significantly when unregistered people living on the island are consid-\nered (US State Department, 2014). Almost two million (mostly US) cruise and yacht\ntourists pass the island every year, attracting tens of thousands of regional migrants\n(Alberts, 2016). This has caused a rapid growth not only in the number but also in the\ndiversity of the population of the island (De Wit, 2015). This is reflected in the local\npress. The official languages of St. Maarten are Dutch and English,3 of which the latter\nis dominant in society as well as in the media.\nSt. Maarten's main newspaper,4 The Daily Herald, also called The Herald, was estab-\nlished in 1994 by Roger Snow, who then was director of the oldest contemporary news-\npaper of the Dutch Caribbean founded by the Roman Catholic Church in Cura\u00e7ao in\nditionally the biggest and most influential in the Dutch Caribbean. Although current\nreporters at The Herald have different backgrounds (see Method), the newspaper repre-\nsents the historical White Dutch/Antillean establishment on the island. As a family busi-\nnewspapers a day and is considered to be the leading news outlet on the island. Its print-\ning office is responsible for printing most of the weeklies and magazines in the region.\nDigitalization of news is reflected in the growing blogosphere and social media use\non St. Maarten.5 Current news websites, such as SMN-News, SXMIslandtime, 721 News,\nand Soualiga News, are mainly one-person businesses that have up to 30,000 unique\nviewers a month. Most news websites attract visitors from all over the world. Some have\nalliances with media outlets throughout the Caribbean, as well as in the United States and\nin Europe. St. Maarten's press also has online outlets and social media pages \u00ad primarily\non Facebook. Foreign administered news websites that include news on St. Maarten,\nsuch as Caribbean News Now, are available; `however, their impact is less significant\nNews media in St. Maarten is thoroughly intertwined with the press in the other countries\nwithin the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The cooperation between The Herald and the\nRotmeijer 5\nCura\u00e7aoan press is one example.Another is the multilingual Caribisch Netwerk, which is part\nof the Dutch Public Broadcaster for Information, Education and Culture (NTR). Caribisch\nNetwerk is the online successor of Radio Netherlands Worldwide and works with freelance\njournalists throughout the Dutch Caribbean. Many journalists working on St. Maarten have\nobtained their education in the Netherlands or the United States. Dutch news coverage highly\ninfluences St. Maarten news and its people. Regional perceptions still `depend upon images\nand representations that are produced and distributed through NorthAmerican and European\nstructures'(Pertierra and Horst, 2009: 104). The proximity of the United States is reflected in\nthe impact of US media and culture in the Caribbean, and news media on the island tend to\nfollow American news models that strictly separate news from opinion.\nIn addition, and due to immigration from the region, St. Maarten's media landscape\nreflects a Caribbean media culture, which is influenced by the small scale of the com-\nmunities living on Caribbean islands, local `word-of-mouth' traditions (i.e. Jeffry, 2003)\nthat are deeply embedded in Caribbean oral cultures (Storr, 2016: 78), and a colonial\nhistory that is reproduced in an authoritative culture of secrecy and silence (Storr, 2016:\n134). `In these small, secretive societies, media systems are plagued by partisan politics,\nwhich presents itself in a variety of ways and influences the performances of journalists'\n(Storr, 2016: 167). This statement expresses a sentiment that is shared by local journal-\nists and that has been independently verified by the recently conducted Transparency\nInternational \u00ad National Integrity Assessment in St. Maarten. Despite the absence of\nrestrictive laws, the assessment concludes that `[t]he small scale of St. Maarten society\ngives rise to a culture of self-censorship on the part of its journalists and makes it difficult\nGlobal commercialization has deeply impacted St. Maarten's local journalism. All\nnews outlets in St. Maarten are privately owned and dependent on advertisements from\nbusiness and political elites on the island, who are often closely connected in the island's\ncommunity (Guadeloupe, 2008; Roitman and Veenendaal, 2016). It is difficult to detail\naffiliations and ownerships, as local `media outlets do not provide disclosure of relevant\ninformation on their ownership, staff, and reporting and editing policies'(De Wit, 2015).\nThus, St. Maarten's local journalism is at the crossroads of Caribbean, European, and\nNorth- and South-American media cultures. And local journalism can only be under-\nstood in light of the historical and global mediascape.\nMethod\nThis article draws on my broader research into how St. Maarten (and Cura\u00e7aoan) online\nand print news media practice and interpret journalism. Building on news anthropology\nMaarten, I was a participant-observer at the main newspaper, The Herald, and with the\ngrowing group of news bloggers on the island. For 3months, I had my own desk at the\nnewsroom of The Herald, participating in editorial meetings, and joining journalists and\nnews bloggers to press conferences and other public events. Moreover, I wrote pieces for\nthe newspaper in order to better understand the news production process. I also con-\nducted in-depth interviews of 80\nminutes on average with 14 journalists, editors, and\nnews bloggers (see Table 1), covering most of the journalists working in St. Maarten's\nsmall print and online media landscape.\nInterviews were conducted between January and April 2016. Depending on the pref-\nerences of the interviewees, interviews were conducted in English (total of nine) or in\nDutch (total of five). The interviews were semi-structured, with a list of topics that\nincluded personal background, reflection upon the role of journalism, ideals, practices,\nand the challenges local journalists face. All interviews were audio recorded and verba-\ntim transcribed, and, if necessary, translated to English. Together with detailed field\nnotes (Crang and Cook, 2007), I analyzed the transcripts following an iterative qualita-\ntive analysis approach of open, selective, and axial coding (Boeije, 2010) to categorize,\nsort, reorganize, and structure the material in light of the posed research questions of this\nparticular study. Codes such as `watchdog' and `community builder' exemplifying vari-\nous understandings of the role of journalism on the island, and `economic development'\nand `social stability' illustrating journalists' ideals, have formed the basis for the three\noverall patterns of constructive journalism described below.\nFindings\nThe concept of constructive journalism was never mentioned by the journalists as such.\nHowever, I observed that most local journalists use constructive techniques in their prac-\ntices. Analyzing interview material and field notes, I related these observations to the\nideals of local journalists. I ended up distinguishing three intertwined patterns of\nTable 1.

Occupation has been categorized as: management (publisher, editor-in-chief),\njournalist, and website owners. Interviewees work at the following (current and past) news outlets: The Her-\nald, The Today Newspaper, NTR Caribisch Netwerk, SXMIslandtime, SMN-News, Soualiganews, 721News, PdJ2,\nThe Island Newsday, and The St. Maarten Republic. Many journalists work or used to work at multiple news\noutlets. Respondents were born in the following countries: St. Maarten, Cura\u00e7ao, Saba, The Netherlands,\nSurinam, Guyana, and Jamaica.\nRotmeijer 7\npractices of and motives for constructive journalism in St. Maarten: to enhance local\neconomic development, to promote engagement and belonging, and to foster social sta-\nbility. Journalists, however, also pointed to the local political, economic, and socio-cul-\ntural constraints of local journalism. Below I will describe the three patterns of\nconstructive journalism practices in relation to these constraints. In the `Discussion and\nconclusion' section, I will further reflect on the implications of constraints for the mean-\ning and feasibility of constructive journalism in young postcolonial democracies.\nConstructive journalism to enhance economic development\n`I focus on business-oriented news (...) because that creates the opportunities for\nsociety to move forward. Economic development is basically the key to any country\nin order for the people to move forward' (Interview 12). This journalist recently\ndecided to start a news website focusing on business news. The ideals expressed in\nthis interview \u00ad to contribute to economic development and progress \u00ad are shared by\nmany journalists and news outlets on the island and motivate them to use constructive\njournalism techniques.\nThe journalistic focus on local economic growth can be traced back to the time the\nfirst daily newspapers were set up in St. Maarten. The daily press came into being\nduring the second half of the past century, when American investors caught wind of\nSt. Maarten and local political leaders capitalized on these opportunities (Guadeloupe,\n2008: 16\u00ad17). Most successful in this was St. Maarten politician Claude Wathey who\nRoitman and Veenendaal, 2016). His policies led to the `rapid development of the\ntourist market' in St. Maarten and the `massive influx of workers' from the region\nAs the management The Herald recalls, Wathey approached Snow to start a daily\nnewspaper on St. Maarten. Wathey was interested in investing in daily news media that\nwould help him with the economic development of the island \u00ad reflecting the popularity\nthe beginning of the 1990s, however, the opposition to Wathey's policies grew, which\nwas reflected in the news coverage, and Snow left the Wathey-financed newspaper to\nstart his own newspaper.\nAlthough Wathey died in 1998, the effects of his policies are a daily reality on the\nisland, and reflected in journalism practices directed toward enhancing economic devel-\nopment of the island, which is primarily based on tourism. The competition for tourists\nin the region has increased immensely during the past decades. And many St. Maarten\njournalists aim to promote tourism and local business in order to compete and economi-\ncally survive. One of the managers of The Herald explains,\nWe have to brand ourselves better. (...) Lately, Arke [Airline] said that they wanted to help us\nwith that, but only if St. Maarten's government also contributes. (...) By publishing articles we\ncan put pressure (...) in a positive manner, by making substantiated comparisons to other\nislands. (...) Stories like these help society to progress because money keeps a society going.\nAnd our main source of income is the tourist market. (Interview 2)\nFigure 1. Example of front-page headline: `Arke Airline returns to St. Maarten November' \u00ad 4\nLooking up the archives, The Herald indeed has published multiple articles about\nArke Airlines. On 4 March 2015, for example, one of the headlines on the front page\nsaid, `Arke Airline returns to St. Maarten November' (see Figure 1).\nThe article is accompanied by an editorial on page 2 with the title `Reassuring' (see\nFigure 2), which reflects the above quote of the editor about the need to put pressure in a\npositive manner (`obviously good news'), and by making comparisons to other islands\n(`compared to the ABC-islands'). The editorial also shows how the newspaper construc-\ntively frames its articles; not everything is positively formulated (`Still, a word of caution\nRotmeijer 9\nis in order'), but the article ends with an uplifting message (`it's reassuring to read in\ntoday's paper that the matter is being given highest priority').\nLocal journalists believe it is vital for St. Maarten's survival to promote tourism and\nbusiness. This motive for using constructive journalism techniques, however, can be\nquestioned from the perspective of what anthropologist Guadeloupe (2008) has described\nas St. Maarten's `money tie system, the notion that all relationships are somewhere along\nFigure 2. Example of constructive message. Editorial: `Reassuring' \u00ad 4 March 2015 (www.\nthedailyherald.sx).\nthe line based on a quest for more money and power' (p. 39). Together with news com-\nmercialization and the (in)direct impact of advertisers (Storr, 2016: 140), it is difficult to\ndistinguish economic development ideals from market-led motives. Often, journalists\nare well aware of the idealistic ambiguity underlying their constructive journalism prac-\ntices toward economic development. According to a newspaper manager,\nOne very important function of journalism is control, but the other is being an intermediary of\ncourse. (...) Look, for example, at this article in yesterday's edition: `Divico now officially\nexclusive distributor for [supermarket] Intermarch\u00e9'. I have to put up with this article, because it\nactually is promotion. But on the other hand, Intermarch\u00e9 is a very important company, and\npublishing about it [stimulates] the economy \u00ad so, in a certain way, also this is news. (Interview 1)\nThe aim to stimulate St. Maarten's economy by functioning as an intermediary for\nlocal business ties in with the constructive journalism's philosophy that journalists can\nand should participate in enhancing societal well-being. However, considering the\nisland's money tie system in relation to the commercialization of news, functioning as an\nintermediary obscures the underlying motives for publishing about tourism, business,\nand economic growth. Hence, promotion and news become inseparable.\nConstructive journalism to promote engagement and belonging\nAs a result of the rapid growth of the tourism industry, St. Maarten has attracted many\nmigrants from the region and beyond. In order to create more inclusive belonging among\nmembers of St. Maarten's diverse and transnational community, many journalists \u00ad and\nespecially those having a migrant background themselves (see Table 1) \u00ad use construc-\ntive journalism techniques in their journalistic practices.\nHaving an international audience, the owners of news websites focus above all on\nengaging St. Maarten's transnational community. A journalist explains why engaging\nstudents who go study abroad was an important reason to start her news website:\nHome becomes a strange place or a place of the past. Because there is no interaction. So it's not\nencouraging for them to come back, because they don't basically know what's happening. (...)\nOne of my goals is to let the people from St. Maarten, mostly our students, get day to day\ninformation. Because, they are from here. They just leave temporarily. (Interview 10)\nMany journalists related that having an immigrant background makes them not only\nmore aware of the transnational character of the local community but also more sensitive\nto the issues affecting immigrants, as well as to how immigrants perceive the news. One\nof them explained that many migrants are not involved as `they don't feel part of the\ncommunity'and `they're told they are not part of the community'. She, however, aims to\nchange this: `I want to make an impact to tell them: this affects you' (Interview 3). This\naim is reflected in her journalistic practice:\nEvery single time the word `citizen' comes up, I change it to `resident'. (...) I know it's only a\nsmall definition, but it makes an impact. When somebody says `I'm a citizen of St. Maarten',\nautomatically [people think]: `Oh that person has a Dutch nationality'. That's the mindset. But\nwhen you say: `I'm a resident', then the question comes up: `Oh where the hell did you came\n[from]? You live here'. Right away there is a different mindset, so I changed it. I said: that's my\nlittle revolution by itself. (...) I use words that work to bring about an inclusive mindset.\n(Interview 3)\nThis journalist hopes that by using the word `resident' instead of `citizen', more peo-\nple will identify with the news. In this way, she aims to provide more inclusive news that\nresonates with people so that they take action. Following this, she also decided to focus\non people as having strengths and to stop using the word victim. Thus, by using `words\nthat work', this journalist aims to constructively promote the active contribution of peo-\nple living on St. Maarten.\nAnd she is not the only one. The government also uses the word `residents' on its web-\nsite, and in official documents, which local journalists then publish about. News media are\nconnected to other institutions in local communities, and produce and reproduce national\nideologies (Blommaert, 1999: 427). The use of `residents'in St. Maarten news media may,\ntherefore, not only be the result of individual journalistic efforts to create an inclusive\nmind-set but also the result of the nation-building strategies of local politicians, whose\n`affiliation may be antagonistic and ambivalent; solidarity may be only situational and\nstrategic: commonality is often negotiated through the \"contingency\" of social interests\nSimultaneously, journalists showed how they use constructive journalism practices to\nchallenge local policies.Ajournalist who migrated to the island 17years ago explains that she\nused to write in-depth, more investigative stories to comprehensively inform the community\nand force authorities to act on migration-related problems. She gives the following example:\nI was actually shocked when I moved here and I realized that immigrant kids without papers\ndidn't have access to the regular education system. I was like: how is that even possible? And I\nwrote about it, I did a series and what not. It even ended up with the authorities in The\nNetherlands. (...) I think that public pressure; continuously asking the questions and bringing\nout the stories of the actual kids, forced our authorities. In 2009 something was finally done,\nthey started a first implementation of compulsory education. (Interview 4)\nAccording to her, media coverage in the form of in-depth features `is lacking a lot in\nthe media in St. Maarten'. This is a view shared by many local journalists, who all\nexpressed their frustrations about the lack of human resources, money, and time for con-\nducting more investigative journalism.\nBut local journalists \u00ad especially those with a work permit \u00ad are also said to be\ncautious about going in-depth. According to a newspaper manager,\nI have to be careful how I formulate this, but I think that some journalists have been afraid to\nask certain questions over the years. There have been many journalists from other islands, who\nare dependent on a work permit. (Interview 2)\nA journalist who used to be dependent on a work permit, but now has the Dutch national-\nity, confirms that:\nThere were a lot of issues about you being an immigrant. Because the government needed to\napprove your permit. So if you weren't `good', they'd say: `Well, you have to go back to your\ncountry, because I'm not going to issue your permit'. (Interview 3)\nMany journalists on the island are indeed dependent on the authorities for their working\npermits, which leads to situations where `they do not want to be too critical and take the\nThe threats to immigrant reporters result in the repression of aspects of the news in\nmanifold ways. They lead to self-censorship among immigrant journalists as well as to a\nlack of in-depth stories that expose migration-related problems. The use of constructive\njournalism techniques that focus on words of inclusion, without critically addressing\nexclusion in practice, is counterproductive. And worse, it risks giving local elites free\nrein to serve their own interests under the banner of nation-building.\nConstructive journalism to foster social stability\nAt this moment it is important that one constructively contributes to this society \u00ad we are in an\nimportant period-, that one objectively brings information, but also that we think constructively\nabout how we can progress (...) For example by writing a statement in an editorial. But also,\nby writing stories in which positive ideas are brought forward and people can think: `ok, this\ntakes us further'. (Interview 2)\nMost local journalists share the view expressed by this newspaper manager that the politi-\ncal instability since 2010 has hindered the community from moving forward. In addition, the\npolitical instability and related issues of integrity and corruption have been extensively\ndetailed in the Dutch press and by Dutch politicians writing letters to news media in St.\nMaarten. This has led to overall negative news coverage of St. Maarten on a local and inter-\nnational level, which has not only impacted the local tourism sector but also the relationship\nwith the Netherlands. Most local journalists see it as an important task for themselves to\nmaintain good relations with the Netherlands. One of the managers of The Herald explains,\nConsidering the relationship with The Netherlands, you have to be careful in what you cover,\nand how you cover topics. You should not make things worse. This is a society in transition.\n(...) And that's a process of growth that is going to take decades. And, you have to be careful\nin how you accompany this process. Also, as a newspaper. (Interview 2)\nBased on the idea that the main newspaper on the island can easily make or break\npersons living in the small community, journalists working for The Herald feel a respon-\nsibility to foster social stability in the local community and to bring news that is fair. One\nof the managers says about this:\nReal corruption should be handled, and flat out. However, one should also realize what happens\nwith society when everyone is locked behind bars. It is \u00ad I would almost say \u00ad a devilish\nequation one has to make. (...) There are still some politicians that has to be caught, but you\nshould take into account that you won't disrupt the stability of society (...) It is very important\nthat we maintain a stable society. (Interview 2)\nBecause of the focus on stability, The Herald is often criticized for self-censorship by\njournalists on the island.\nThey sugarcoat everything. Everyone has to be treated fairly. You can't step on anybody's toes?\n[But] if you're a newspaper and you don't piss some people off, [it] means you can never\nactually write a piece that matters in a sense, you know? (Interview 8)\nWhile stressing that they never censor themselves, some journalists working at The\nHerald acknowledge this critique, admitting that the management often puts (too much)\nemphasis on the journalistic principle of fair hearing. This leads to situations in which\nreporters have to go back and forth between different parties before their articles are\nfinally published.\nSome journalists take their critique one step further, like this news website owner:\nTheir entire newspaper is politically affiliated. Ninety percent of the companies are \u00ad I am\nprobably exaggerating a bit \u00ad but a lot of the companies on the Dutch side [St. Maarten] are\nowned by certain politicians and their families, and they advertise with The Daily Herald. If\nthey go write things about them, they'd risk losing the advertising. (Interview 10)\nAnother journalist adds, `because it is a small town, you can't piss off business, because\nthat means you can't pay your journalists' (Interview 8). According to a journalist of an\nolder generation, who used to have several small newspapers and magazines, `We had the\ntypical problem St. Martin journalism has, namely that we could not get the advertise-\nments that we needed. It's not like Today, or The Herald. (...) Our position always clashed\nwith the establishment' (Interview 14).\nIndeed, the need for advertisements does stimulate journalists not only to write posi-\ntively about business but also to avoid reporting negatively about them. News websites,\ntypically run by lone individuals, are susceptible to advertisers' influence in the same\nway. Website owners have to not only write pieces about advertisers but also maintain\nrelationships with their `clients'. One of them says,\nLet's say you have a client, and let's say that client becomes the news. What do you do? You\nhave to do the news, right? You have to report that story. But perhaps, how you write the story\nmay not do too much harm to your client. So, you know, you have to be tactical. (Interview 12)\nIn addition to market-driven principles, some local journalists argue that these care-\nful, tactical journalistic approaches reflect the overall `sugarcoated society' of St.\nMaarten `where nobody feels completely comfortable with being outspoken' (Interview\n8). This ties in with what Storr (2016) has described as local Caribbean cultures of\nin some cases, these cultures may require a more radical role of local journalism in criti-\ncizing local political and economic elites (p. 97). Since the 1950s, local news initiatives\nhave been active in opposing the establishment on the island (Johnson, 1987: 75). Based\non `a philosophy of advocacy journalism', local journalists have started news outlets\nwith the aim of `helping to improve the social, economic, educational, and political con-\nditions' of St. Maarten `by advocating against the causes of Injustice and Oppression'\n(Reiph, 2009). Today, only some journalists take this more radical approach. One of\nthem states, `I do a lot of investigative journalism. It takes a lot of courage in a small\nisland, where everybody knows everybody, to take the risk that I take. I go after [Dutch]\nprosecutors if I have to' (Interview 10).\nThus, the majority of (the main) news media take a tactical, cautious approach to\nenhance social stability, which ties in constructive journalism's ideal to hold power to\naccount by fostering conversation, collaboration, and consensus building. But in the\nlocal, postcolonial context of St. Maarten, this approach risks reflecting and strength-\nening a culture of secrecy and silence. As long as the fear of being outspoken persists\nin the local culture, a focus on social stability could simply play into the hands of those\nin power in St. Maarten and beyond; something I will further reflect upon in the\ndiscussion.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nIn this article, I showed that many St. Maarten journalists practice constructive journal-\nism based on ideals of constructively contributing to economic development, engage-\nment and belonging, and social stability of the island. Local constructive journalism\nincludes positively reporting about local businesses and putting pressure on the govern-\nment to support economic growth. Moreover, constructive journalistic practices seek to\nengage with the highly diverse population on St. Maarten and to develop a sense of\nbelonging among St. Maarteners. In light of St. Maarten's ongoing relationship with the\nNetherlands and the political crises the island has been confronted with, constructive\njournalism is practiced to foster social stability, which, according to some, supersedes the\nwatchdog function of local media.\nAt the same time, I contended that local journalists deeply struggle with local politi-\ncal, economic, and socio-cultural constraints. Local journalism is dependent on com-\nmerce and lacks human resources. Moreover, St. Maarten is home to a culture in which\npeople fear outspokenness. This is likely a reflection of the colonial past and is rein-\nforced by the small community setting in which many people are related to one another.\nThese constraints undercut the meaning and feasibility of constructive journalism, as\ncritics of this approach and similar forms of journalism have previously stressed.\nEvery journalist wants to write `words that work'. But for whom and for what pur-\npose? In St. Maarten, news stories about local business that seek to foster economic\ndevelopment risk to becoming promotion. Local journalistic initiatives to use words of\ninclusion in news stories, while local journalists do not have the capacity or the courage\nto address ongoing policies of exclusion, are counterproductive. And a journalistic focus\non social stability in St. Maarten reproduces the local `sugarcoated' community and the\nbenefits political and economic elites have of this culture of fear.\nSo, practicing constructive journalism under St. Maarten's restricted political, eco-\nnomic, and socio-cultural conditions not only risks reflecting the status quo but also may\nplay into the hands of the ones in power. This undermines the normative underpinnings\nof constructive journalism and the ideals of local journalists willing to foster develop-\nment, engagement, and societal well-being. For constructive journalism to flourish and\nto realize its normative potential, the local culture of fear has to change as well as the\nentrenched political and economic power structures. St. Maarten news media can play an\nimportant role in overcoming these problems. However, rather than constructive, this\nrole should be disruptive, unsettling, and deconstructing of the hegemonic power dynam-\nics in St. Maarten's community. Therefore, indeed, `[i]n the small countries of the\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean, where the dynamics of producing news are different, the\njournalist's role must also include advocacy and radicalism' (Storr, 2016: 189).\nThe dynamics of news production in St. Maarten differ from those in the United\nStates and overseas Dutch journalism contexts. They are formed in a culture that reflects\ncolonial legacies and the globalized reality of today. This local, postcolonial context is\nnot unique to St. Maarten. Further research should be done on whether the problems and\nrisks of constructive journalism in St. Maarten, and the need for more disruptive journal-\nism, also apply to other small postcolonial democracies around the world.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNotes\n1. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over St. Maarten causing economic crisis, politi-\ncal instability, and extensive damage to the island's infrastructure. The impact of Irma on St.\nMaarten's community and its news media landscape has been immense and devastating. This\narticle draws on a research conducted on the island prior to Irma in 2015/2016. Meanwhile, the\nmedia landscape has changed considerably. Nevertheless, this article still is relevant for post-\nIrma St. Maarten, where the call for journalism's role in rebuilding and reconstructing the island\nhas become more intense, as has the need for `independent, critical and strong journalism, also\nin light of the recent political developments' (The Daily Herald, 2017).\n2. This article focuses on print and online news media. The local press, however, is thor-\noughly intertwined with radio and TV broadcasting. Many journalists have a multi-media\nbackground.\n3. Mostly spoken on the island is St. Maarteners' English, which is a local creole. News media\nall publish, broadcast, and post news in British English.\n4. In October 2017, just after Hurricane Irma, St. Maarten's second and smaller newspaper, The\nToday Newspaper, was forced to cease its printing operations.\n5. At the moment of writing this article, no statistics were available on Internet penetration in\nSt. Maarten.
