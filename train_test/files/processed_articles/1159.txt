The\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention maintains a national surveil-\nlance system of nonfatal injuries treated\nin US hospital emergency depart-\nments,6 as well as a surveillance sys-\ntem of health-risk behaviors among\nhigh school students in the United\nStates.7 These systems provide valu-\nable information, but they are limited\nbecause they focus on narrow groups\n(attempters who present at hospital\nemergency departments and youth who\ncurrently attend high school). Sec-\nond, several epidemiologic surveys have\nreported population-based prevalence\nestimates for suicidal thoughts and sui-\ncide attempts.8-10 It is unclear, though,\nwhether these results accurately re-\nflect current prevalence because of the\nconsiderable increase in recent years in\nthe number of people in the United\nStates who have received treatment for\nSubstantial efforts have also been\nmade to develop and implement sui-\ncide prevention and intervention pro-\ngrams during the past decade.14 There\nhas been a roughly 6% reduction in the\nperiod prevalence of suicide in the\nUnited States among people in the\ning this period, from approximately\nis possible that a significant change also\noccurred in the prevalence of suicide-\nrelated behaviors, including suicidal\nthoughts, plans, and attempts.\nTheaimofthecurrentreportistoshed\nsomelightonthisissuebyexaminingthe\nonly nationally representative general-\npopulationtrenddataavailableonthe12-\nmonthprevalenceandtreatmentofthese\nsuicide-relatedbehaviors.Thesedataare\nMETHODS\nSamples\nThe NCS is a nationally representative\nhousehold survey of English-speaking\nsponse rate was 82.4%, according to the\nresponse rate 3 method of the Ameri-\ncan Association for Public Opinion Re-\nsearch.17 The latter method includes the\nnumber of completed interviews in the\nnumerator and the number of origi-\nnally sampled households, excluding\nineligible households (ie, vacant house-\nholds and households in which the ran-\ndomly sampled respondent was found\nto be ineligible after contact) in the de-\nnominator, with an adjustment for the\nestimated proportion of uncontacted\nhouseholds that contained an eligible\nwere completed. The NCS-R is a na-\ntionally representative household sur-\nvey of respondents aged 18 years and\nolder. The response rate was 70.9%,\nwith the same method of calculation as\nwere completed.\nBoth surveys used a 2-part internal\nsubsampling scheme in which all re-\nspondents received a part I interview\nthat assessed mental disorders, whereas\n100% of part I respondents who met cri-\nteria for a disorder and a probability\nsubsample of part I respondents who\ndid not meet criteria for a disorder were\nadministered the part II interview. The\npart II interview assessed risk factors,\ntreatment, and consequences of men-\ntal disorders. Nonrespondent screen-\ning data were used to weight the NCS\nfor nonresponse bias. Other weights ad-\njusted for differential probabilities of se-\nlection and residual discrepancies be-\ntween sample and census demographic-\ngeographic distributions. The part II\nsamples were also weighted for the\noversampling of part I respondents with\ndisorders. More details about NCS and\nNCS-R samples and weights are pre-\nsented elsewhere.16,18 Suicidality was as-\nsessed in part I of the NCS and in part\nII of the NCS-R, whereas most of the\ncorrelates examined here were as-\nsessed in part II of both surveys.

The human sub-\njects committees of the University of\nMichigan and of Harvard Medical\nSchool approved these recruitment and\nconsent procedures.\nSuicidal Behaviors\nRespondents were asked whether they\never seriously thought about killing\nthemselves and, if so, whether they had\nthese thoughts in the past 12 months.\nRespondents who reported such sui-\ncidal ideation were then asked whether\nthey ever made a plan for committing\nsuicide and, if so, whether they made\nsuch a plan in the past 12 months. Re-\ngardless of the answer to the question\nabout a plan, respondents who re-\nportedsuicidalideationwerethenasked\nwhether they ever attempted suicide\nand, if so, whether they made such an\nattempt in the past 12 months. Respon-\ndents who reported making a 12-\nmonth attempt were then asked to de-\nscribe the lethality intent of the attempt\nby indicating which of the following 3\nstatements best described their at-\ntempt: \"I made a serious attempt to kill\nmyself and it was only luck that I did\nnot succeed.\" \"I tried to kill myself, but\nknew the method was not foolproof.\"\n\"My attempt was a cry for help. I did\nnot intend to die.\" Respondents who\nendorsed either of the first 2 state-\nments were considered in the analysis\nto have made a suicide attempt, whereas\nrespondents who endorsed the third\nstatement were considered to have\nmade a suicide gesture.\nCorrelates\nWe examined associations of suicide-\nrelated behaviors with the mental dis-\norders assessed in the 2 surveys. These\ndisorders were assessed with the World\nHealth Organization Composite Inter-\nnational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),\na fully structured diagnostic interview\ndesigned to be used by trained lay in-\nterviewers.19 The Diagnostic and Statis-\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-\nvised Third Edition (DSM-III-R) version\nof CIDI was used in the NCS20 and the\nDiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMen-\ntal Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)\nversion in the NCS-R.21 We also exam-\nined associations of suicide-related be-\nhaviors with 7 sociodemographic vari-\nables:age,sex,race/ethnicity,education,\nmarital status, employment status, and\nregion of the country. Race/ethnicity\nwas coded into the standard census\ncodes of non-Hispanic black, non-\nHispanic white, Hispanic, and other ac-\ncording to responses to 2 questions\nabout Hispanic heritage and race. The\nfollowing prespecified racial catego-\nries were used in the second question:\nAmerican Indian, Alaskan Native,\nAsian, black or African American, Na-\ntive Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, white,\nand other. Race/ethnicity was in-\ncluded in the analysis because of ex-\ntensive previous research on the rela-\ntionship between racial/ethnic minority\nstatus and mental disorder.22 All part\nII respondents in both surveys were also\nasked about 12-month treatment for\nemotional problems. Responses were\nused to distinguish treatment across 5\nsectors: psychiatrist, other mental\nhealth specialist (eg, psychologist, so-\ncial worker in a mental health spe-\ncialty setting), general medical practi-\ntioner (primary care physician, nurse);\nhuman services professional (reli-\ngious or spiritual advisor, social worker\nin any setting other than a specialty\nmental health setting); and comple-\nmentary-alternative medical treat-\nment (CAM; treatment by a CAM pro-\nfessional, such as a massage therapist,\nor participation in a self-help group).\nAnalysis Methods\nTrends were assessed with pooled lo-\ngistic regression equations using the sui-\ncidal behaviors as dichotomous out-\ncomes. Predictors included time (NCS-\nR=1, NCS=0), demographics, and\ninteractions between time and demo-\ngraphics.

The rationale was that signifi-\ncant changes in subsample trends are\npossible even in the presence of no sig-\nnificant change at the population level\nif an increase in one segment of the\npopulation offsets a decrease in an-\nother segment. All but 1 of these 28 tests\nfailed to exceed the critical value of the\ntest statistic, whereas inspection of the\ndata in the one case in which the test\nwas significant suggested that this re-\nsult was due to an outlier. These re-\nsults indicate that suicide-related be-\nhaviors not only remained unchanged\nin the population as a whole but also\nin major subgroups of the population\ndefined by sociodemographic variables.\nAccording to the above result, we\nwere able to pool the data in the 2\nsamples to examine consistent socio-\ndemographic correlates of suicide-\nrelated behaviors. A global test showed\nthat the sociodemographics were sig-\nnificant overall in predicting all 4 out-\nthough the associations were fairly\nmodest in substantive terms (contin-\n(TABLE 3).

The\nnever married had elevated ORs for ges-\ntures (3.9 and significant) but de-\ncreased ORs for ideation, plans, and at-\nattempts). Race/ethnicity and region of\nthe country were not significantly re-\nlated to any of the outcomes.\nTrends in Treatment\nRespondents who reported 12-month\nsuicidal ideation were divided into 3\nmutually exclusive subgroups defined\nby the presence of an attempt, a ges-\nture, or neither. Respondents in each\nof these 3 subgroups were then distin-\nguished by whether or not they had a\nsuicide plan, thus creating 6 sub-\ngroups. The proportion of respon-\ndents who reported receiving treat-\nment for emotional problems in the past\n12 months increased over time in each\nof these 6 subgroups, 2 of them signifi-\ncantly so at the .05 level (TABLE 4). The\nincreases were confined to treatment in\nthe psychiatrist sector and the general\nmedical sector. No significant in-\ncreases were found in the other men-\ntal health, human services, or CAM sec-\ntors (results available on request).\nAlthough treatment in the mental\nhealth specialty sectors (either psychia-\ntrist or other mental health specialist)\nremained somewhat more common\nthan treatment in the general medical\nsector in 5 of the 6 NCS-R subgroups,\nthis difference was much more pro-\nnounced in the NCS than the NCS-R\nbecause of a greater increase in gen-\neral medical than mental health spe-\ncialty treatment in all subgroups.

The prevalence\nof gestures was found not to decrease\nbetween the 2 surveys more among re-\nspondents who received treatment than\namong those who did not (TABLE 5).\nFurthermore, the prevalence of at-\ntempts was found not to increase be-\ntween the surveys more among respon-\ndents who did not receive treatment\nthan among those who did.\nCOMMENT\nThese results should be interpreted with\n5 limitations in mind. First, the out-\ncomes are sufficiently rare that mean-\ningful changes could have occurred that\nwere not detected as statistically sig-\nnificant with samples of the size con-\nsidered here. Also, a number of the ORs\nin the prediction equation have wide\nCIs. Second, suicide-related behaviors\nare likely to be underreported because\nof stigmas that might change and vary\nat a point in time across sociodemo-\ngraphic segments of society. Third, al-\nthough the survey methods were kept\nas comparable as possible in the 2 sur-\nveys, even subtle differences in inter-\nview procedures, sample nonre-\nsponse, or respondent reluctance to\nadmit suicidal thoughts or behaviors\ncould have led to changes in the inter-\nnal validity of responses over time.\nFourth, external validity is reduced by\nthe fact that the response rate was less\nthan perfect, coupled with the fact that\nthe sampling frame excluded people\nolder than 54 years, individuals living\nin institutions, the homeless, and in-\ndividuals who had completed suicide.\nFifth, we did not assess whether treat-\nments began before or after onset of sui-\ncidality, nor did we assess the ad-\nequacy or effectiveness of treatment,\nwhich might have changed over time.\nWith these limitations in mind, the\nanalysis documented 3 noteworthy re-\nsults. First, we found no significant\nchanges in the 12-month prevalence of\nsuicidal ideation, plans, gestures, or at-\ntempts, which is consistent with an ear-\nlier analysis that found no evidence of\nchange in the overall 12-month preva-\nlence of DSM-IV mental disorders in the\n2 surveys.25 The lack of trends in sui-\ncide-related behaviors does not follow\nlogically from the failure to find a trend\nin disorder prevalence for 2 reasons: a\nmeaningful minority of respondents\nwith suicide-related behaviors did not\nmeet 12-month criteria for any of the\nDSM disorders assessed in the 2 sur-\n12% of attempters), and the remain-\ning respondents with suicidal behaviors\nhad a much higher concentration of se-\nvere and comorbid 12-month DSM dis-\nTable 5.

In addition\nto including mental health and general medical treatment, the category of any treatment includes treatment by a human services professional (eg, religious or spiritual advisor,\nsocial worker) and complementary-alternative medical treatment (treatment by a professional, such as a massage therapist, or participation in a self-help group).\nSignificant difference between NCS and NCS-R at the .05 level, 2-sided test.\norders than cases in the general popu-\nlation.\nSecond, we found that risk of suicide-\nrelated behaviors is consistently el-\nevated in several vulnerable sub-\ngroups, including the young, women,\nindividuals with low education, and in-\ndividuals lacking stable relationships or\nemployment. These patterns did not\nchange significantly, which means that\nthe lack of a significant time trend in\nthe prevalence of suicide-related be-\nhaviors in the total sample does not\nmask opposite-direction significant\ntrends in major sociodemographic seg-\nments of the population. It also means\nthat the enormous increase in treat-\nment of emotional problems in the de-\ncade between the 2 surveys did not re-\nduce the disparities in risk of suicide-\nrelated behaviors associated with these\ndisadvantaged social statuses.\nThird, we found that treatment in-\ncreasedsubstantiallyamongpeoplewith\nsuicide-related behaviors, which is con-\nsistent with a number of earlier studies\nthat documented increased treatment of\nmental health problems throughout the\ndecade,11-13 presumably linked to the in-\ntroduction of direct-to-consumer mar-\nketing of new psychotropic drugs; new\ncommunityprogramstopromoteaware-\nness, screening, and help-seeking for\nmental disorders; expansion of \"carve-\nout\"systemstodelivermentalhealthser-\nvices; and new policies to reduce barri-\nIt is not clear how to interpret the\nfinding that suicide-related behaviors\ndid not decrease when treatment in-\ncreased dramatically. Completed sui-\ncides decreased by about 6% during this\nperiod. The increase in treatment might\nhave played a part in this trend, al-\nthough county-level analysis shows no\noverall association between amount of\ntreatment, as indicated by per-capita\nnumber of antidepressant prescrip-\ntions, and the suicide rate.35 If in-\ncreased treatment did play a part in the\ndecrease in the suicide rate, then why\ndid we not see a comparable decrease\nin suicide-related behaviors?\nOne way to begin addressing this\nquestion is to recognize that suicide-\nrelated behaviors are distinct from com-\npleted suicides, if for no other reason\nthan their numbers. There are approxi-\nUnited States each year compared with\npopulation. It is possible that pro-\ncesses affecting the comparatively small\nnumber of suicide completers had no\neffect on the much larger number of ide-\nators or attempters.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility\nthat methodologic factors played a role\nin suicide-related behaviors not being\nless prevalent in the NCS-R than the\nNCS. Such factors could include dif-\nferences between the surveys either in\nsample bias or in willingness to admit\nsuicide-related behaviors to interview-\ners. Arguing against these possibilities\nare our adjusting for sample selection\nbias with nonresponse adjustment\nweights and our finding no evidence in\nresponses to questions about stigma\nthat willingness to admit emotional\nproblems increased over time.\nIn light of these results, 3 substan-\ntive possibilities appear to be more plau-\nsible than methodologic ones in ac-\ncounting for the finding that suicide-\nrelated behaviors remained unchanged\nin the NCS and NCS-R when treat-\nment increased dramatically. One is that\nthe prevalence of suicide-related be-\nhaviors would have increased, were it\nnot for the increase in treatment. A sec-\nond is that attempters typically ob-\ntained treatment only after making at-\ntempts. A third is that the increase in\ntreatment was of such low intensity or\nquality that it had no effect on suicide-\nrelated behaviors.\nAlthough all 3 substantive interpre-\ntations are equally consistent with the\nsurvey data, other information argues\nagainst the possibility that the in-\ncrease in treatment prevented an in-\ncrease that would otherwise have oc-\ncurred in suicide-related behaviors.\nSpecifically, randomized controlled\ntrials find only modest effects of treat-\nment in reducing suicidality, even with\nies of treatment quality consistently find\nthat the majority of patients currently\nin treatment for mental disorders re-\nceive care that fails to meet minimal evi-\ncomplication raised by the US Food and\nDrug Administration's recent analyses\nof pediatric antidepressant trials is that\nthe benefit from treatment in terms of\nsymptom improvement in some pa-\ntients might be offset by adverse ef-\nfects of medications in other pa-\ntients.45 Taken together, these results\nwould lead us not to expect substan-\ntial effects of increased treatment on\npopulation trends in suicidality.\nIt is more difficult to determine the\nrelative importance of the other 2 pos-\nsibilities: that increased treatment either\ndid not reach suicidal people quickly\nenough to prevent attempts or that this\ntreatment, when it was delivered in\ntime, was of such low intensity or qual-\nity that it was ineffective in preventing\nattempts. Both processes could have\nbeen at work, which suggests several\nimportant directions for future inves-\ntigation. With regard to the timeliness\nof treatment, we know that a substan-\ntial minority of survey respondents with\nsuicide-related behaviors received no\ntreatment. In addition, we suspect that\nat least some who reported receiving\ntreatment did so only after making a sui-\ncide gesture or attempt. These results\nmean that efforts are needed to in-\ncrease access to and demand for treat-\nment among people with suicidal ide-\nation. The most serious cases--\nideators who make attempts--\nexperienced smaller increases in\ntreatment throughout the decade than\nless serious cases. Programs that ex-\npand treatment resources32,46 may be es-\npecially important in addressing this\nproblem, as might initiatives that en-\ncourage timely treatment seeking spe-\ncifically among people with suicidal ide-\nation (eg, Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration's Na-\ntional Suicide Prevention Lifeline pro-\ngram).47 Because the dramatic in-\ncrease in treatment in the last decade\nfailed to reduce sociodemographic dis-\nparities in the suicidal behaviors con-\nsidered here, programs specifically tar-\ngetinghigh-riskpopulationsareneeded.\nRecent policies and National Institute\nof Mental Health initiatives encourag-\ning treatment among traditionally un-\nderserved and high-risk groups may\nIncreased treatment, though, will be\nof little value unless the quality of treat-\nment is adequate. Efforts are needed to\nidentify optimal interventions for pri-\nmary and secondary prevention of sui-\ncidality. Although a growing litera-\nture has shed light on the optimal\nintensity, duration, and follow-up re-\ncomparable data on optimal treat-\nments of suicidal thoughts and behav-\niors are just beginning to emerge.57 A\nrecognition is needed that effective pre-\nvention of suicide attempts might re-\nquire substantially more intensive treat-\nment than is currently provided to the\nmajority of people in outpatient treat-\nment for mental disorders. In light of\nthe controversy about the role of anti-\ndepressants in suicidality among ado-\nlescents, identifying whether emerg-\ning treatments have the potential to\nameliorate suicidality in some individu-\nals while potentially worsening it in oth-\ners will be important. The solution is\nlikely to involve providing intensive\nmonitoring and follow-up, as indi-\ncated in the US Food and Drug Admin-\nistration's recent \"black box\" warning\nfor all antidepressants.58\nEfforts will also be needed to pro-\nmote the uptake of effective treat-\nments for suicidality, including those\nthat already exist, as well as any new\ntreatments that are developed and\nshown to be effective.
