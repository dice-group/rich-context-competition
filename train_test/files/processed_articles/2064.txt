    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors on diabetes mellitus. The\naim of this study was to improve understanding of the association between two psychosocial\nfactors- sense of control and social support- and diabetes mellitus.\nMethods: The authors analyzed data from 2,592 U.S. households in the 1995 survey of the Aging,\nStatus, and the Sense of Control study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine\nwhether sense of personal control and social support were associated with DM and whether\ngender, race, and Hispanic ethnicity modified these associations.\nResults: After adjusting for age, obesity, and socioeconomic position, a one point increase in sense\nof control (i.e., a stronger sense of control) was associated a significant reduction in risk of diabetes\nassociated with a non-significant risk of diabetes (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.93,\n1.89). No effect modification was detected.\nConclusion: Sense of control deserves greater attention as a predictor of diabetes mellitus.\nFurther studies of the contribution of psychosocial factors to diabetes mellitus should assess the\ntemporal nature of this relationship.\nBackground\nOver the past thirty years, psychosocial variables have\nemerged as important risk factors for cardiovascular dis-\nease [1] but similar attention has not been paid to their\npotential contribution to diabetes mellitus (DM). Previ-\nous research of psychosocial characteristics related to DM\nhas focused largely on their role in the management of the\nillness [2]. Factors such as anger, hostility, depression,\nlack of social support, and locus of control have been\nassociated with coronary heart disease incidence and mor-\ntality [3-6]. Because type 2 DM shares many risk factors\nwith cardiovascular impairment, it seems plausible that\nsome of these same psychosocial factors may impact one's\nrisk for developing DM.\nThis article is available from: http://www.bpsmedicine.com/content/1/1/19\n\u00a9 2007 Cardarelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nType 2 DM, which accounts for 90%\u00ad95% of the total DM\nprevalence in the United States, is associated with obesity\nand physical inactivity [7], largely preventable risk factors,\nwhich have been linked to a sense of control [8,9] and to\nsocial support [9,10]. Sense of control is the belief that\none can and does master, control, and shape one's own\nlife, and is related to self-efficacy and locus of control [11].\nSense of control may provide empowerment to synthesize\nhealth-promoting behaviors into a coherent lifestyle,\nthereby reducing one's risk for a number of diseases [11].\nSocial support is the perception of existing within social\nembeddedness; that is, having friends or family who may\nprovide comfort and assistance [12]. Social support may\nimprove psychological well-being and is directly associ-\nated with physical health [13]. There is a large body of evi-\ndence that documents lower risk of depression and\npsychological distress for individuals with a high degree\nof social support [14]. Likewise, social support has been\nlinked with cardiovascular disease [15-18].\nIn the present study, we examined whether a strong sense\nof personal control and strong social support were associ-\nated with a reduced self-reported prevalence of DM in a\nU.S. population. In addition, we examined whether these\nrelationships were modified by sociodemographic charac-\nteristics including gender, race, or Hispanic ethnicity con-\nsidering DM affects a disproportionate number of\nminorities in the U.S.\nMethods\nThis study used data from the Aging, Status, and Sense of\nControl (ASOC) survey, a representative national tele-\nphone survey of 2,592 English-speaking respondents aged\nThe ASOC study, conducted in 1995, examined the rela-\ntionship between age and changes in the sense of control\nover one's own life. The Survey Research Laboratory of the\nUniversity of Illinois conducted data collection, and the\nNational Institute on Aging funded the study (R01\nAG12393, PI: John Mirowsky). A prescreened random-\ndigit dialing method was used to decrease the probability\nof contacting a business or nonworking number and to\ndecrease the standard errors compared with the Mitofsky-\nWaksberg method, while producing a sample with similar\ndemographic profile [19].\nEnglish-speaking persons age 18 or older were eligible to\nparticipate in the survey, and two subsamples were\ndevised to produce an 80% oversample of persons age 60\nor older. In the main sample, the adult with the most\nrecent birthday was selected as a participant. In the other\nsample, the person aged 60 years or older with the most\nrecent birthday was selected to participate. Interviews\nwere completed with 71.6% of contacted, eligible per-\nsons, resulting in 2,592 participants ranging in age from\n18 to 95. Respondents were asked about their physical\nhealth, including activities of daily living; mental health,\nincluding anxiety and enjoyment of life; health behaviors;\nuse of health care services; sense of control over their lives;\nsocial support and participation in community activities;\nand social hardship, including assault and extended\nunemployment. Table 1 demonstrates the comparability\nof the ASOC study population with the general U.S. pop-\nulation, using 1995 demographic statistics from the U.S.\nRespondents who answered the following question with\nan affirmative response were considered diabetics: \"Have\nyou ever been diagnosed or told by a doctor that you have\ndiabetes?\" Types 1 and 2 DM were not distinguished and\nadditionally age of onset was not ascertained. Social sup-\nport was conceptually defined as resources provided by\nother persons [21], including emotional and instrumental\nsupport. Emotional support includes the things that indi-\nviduals do to make a person feel connected, loved, and\ncared for, while instrumental support refers to the type of\nassistance that others provide [22]. To measure emotional\nsupport, respondents were asked, \"How much do you\nagree with the statements: 'I have someone I can turn to\nfor support and understanding when things get rough,'\nand 'I have someone I can really talk to.' To measure\ninstrumental support, respondents were asked, \"How\nmuch do you agree with the statements, 'I have someone\nwho would help me out with things, like give me a ride,\nwatch the kids or house, or fix something,' and 'I have\nsomeone who would take care of me if I were sick.\"\nResponses were coded 1= strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = dis-\nagree, 4 = strongly disagree; and the mean response served\nas an index of social support. A low score indicates a high\ndegree of social support. This index was found to have a\ncoefficient alpha in the ASOC study population of 0.85\nA personal control scale created by Mirowsky & Ross [24]\nwas used to measure sense of control. Responses to the\nfollowing four perceived control questions were coded 2\n= strongly agree, 1 = agree, 0 = neutral, -1 = disagree, -2 =\nstrongly disagree:\nTable 1: Comparability of Aging, Status, and Sense of Control\nage 18 years and older\nCharacteristic ASOC U.S.\naPresented as mean value\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nControl over good\n(1) \"I am responsible for my own successes\"\n(2) \"I can do just about anything I really set my mind to\"\nControl over bad\n(3) \"My misfortunes are the result of mistakes I have\nmade\"\n(4) \"I am responsible for my failures\"\nResponses to the following four perceived powerlessness\nquestions are coded 2 = strongly disagree, 1 = disagree, 0\n= neutral, -1 = agree, -2 = strongly agree.\nPowerlessness over good\n(1) \"The really good things that happen to me are mostly\nluck\"\n(2) \"There's no sense planning a lot\u00adif something good is\ngoing to happen, it will\"\nPowerlessness over bad\n(3) \"Most of my problems are due to bad breaks\"\n(4) \"I have little control over the bad things that happen\nto me\"\nThe sense of control scale was calculated as a mean score\nof the responses to these eight questions, with a high score\nindicating a strong sense of control. This index was found\nto have a coefficient alpha in the ASOC study population\nSelf-reported sociodemographic characteristics of\nrespondents included sex, age, race, ethnicity, and socioe-\nconomic position. Age was analyzed as a continuous var-\niable, coded in years. Race was categorized as White,\nAfrican American, and other (including Asian or Pacific\nIslander, Native Americans, and those who responded\n\"other\"). Ethnicity was dichotomized as either Hispanic\nor not Hispanic. Because race was not mutually exclusive\nfor Hispanic ethnicity, both race and ethnicity variables\nwere included in the analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated using self-reported height and weight values\nand were dichotomized into obese ( 30 kg/m2) or not\nobese (< 30 kg/m2), based on clinical guidelines estab-\nlished by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n[25]. Socioeconomic position was operationalized by\neducation, and ascertained by asking respondents, \"What\nis the highest grade or year in school that you have com-\npleted?\" This variable was categorized as (1) less than high\nschool, (2) high school completed or some college com-\npleted, and (3) college completed or more than a college\neducation.\nBecause the ASOC survey oversampled adults age 60 years\nand older by a factor of 1.8, weights were applied to the\ndata. The weight was the inverse of the sampling probabil-\nity, which was 1 if the respondent was younger than 60\nand 1/1.8 if the participant was age 60 or older. In order\nto retain the correct total number of survey respondents, a\nfinal weighting variable was created by using the initial\nweighting variable divided by the average weight for the\nentire sample. This weighting factor was utilized in all\nanalyses to bring the study sample into alignment with\nthe target population.\nLogistic regression models were created, with DM status\nregressed on each psychosocial variable separately,\nadjusted for sex, age, and obesity status. To assess for effect\nmodification, these models were then stratified by race,\nethnicity and gender, and interaction terms were also cre-\nated. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were cal-\nculated for each factor.\nThe software program SPSS version 14.0 was used to man-\nage data and conduct the analyses. The type I error rate\nwas set at the  =.05 level. This study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at the University of Texas\nHealth Science Center at Houston.\nResults\nFive percent of the study population, or 131 participants,\nreported a DM diagnosis. DM was more prevalent in Afri-\ncan Americans, obese participants, respondents over the\nage of 60, and those who were either disabled or retired\nfrom employment (Table 2). A higher sense of control\nand a stronger social support system were inversely asso-\nciated with DM status.\nThe odds ratios for the effect of each psychosocial variable\nregressed on DM status, adjusted for age, obesity status,\nand socioeconomic position, are shown in Table 3. For\nevery one point increase in the sense of control scale (or a\nstronger sense of control) the odds of having DM were\npoint increase in the social support scale (or a weaker\nsocial support system), the odds of having DM increased\ncates that this point estimate is imprecise and results are\nnot statistically significant. Stratification by gender, race,\nand ethnicity showed no evidence of effect modification.\nFurthermore, interaction terms for these models were not\nstatistically significant (results not shown). We also found\nno interaction between sense of control and social sup-\nport.\nConclusion\nOur findings show that, after adjusting for covariates, hav-\ning a strong sense of control was significantly protective\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nagainst DM. Few studies have previously examined these\npsychosocial variables as independent correlates for DM.\nMore often, psychosocial factors have been investigated\namong diabetics in the context of self-management. For\nexample, sense of control has been identified as a predic-\ntor of metabolic control among diabetics [26,27], as has\nsocial support [28]. DM-specific social support and self-\nefficacy have been shown to correlate with an improved\nhealth related quality of life [29]. Among those studies\nthat have considered psychosocial risk factors for DM, one\nfound effort-reward imbalance related to work environ-\nments to be associated with type 2 DM incidence among\nmen only [30]. In contrast, another study found an asso-\nciation between both low decision latitude at work and\nlow sense of coherence with type 2 DM only among\nA low sense of control may result in a compromised abil-\nity to deal with environmental or psychological stressors\n[32]. In response to stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-\nadrenal (HPA) axis secretes cortisol, an overabundance of\nwhich may contribute to insulin resistance [33]. Addition-\nally, persons with a low sense of control may be less likely\nto engage in healthy behavior.\nLimitations of this study should be considered in inter-\npreting the results. People without telephones were not\nincluded in the ASOC survey, and it is likely that those\nTable 2: Characteristics of the study group, Aging, Status, and Sense of Control Study, 1994\u00ad1995\nCharacteristic No. in sample % of total population % diabetics in each\ncategory\np-valuea\nSex\nRace\nEthnicity\nAge, in years\nEducation\nCollege degree or some graduate/professional school or\ngraduate/professional degree\nBody Mass Index\naChi-square test for categorical variables, independent samples t-test for continuous variables\nbPresented as mean values and standard errors; independent t-test\nTable 3: Adjusted odds ratiosa for psychosocial factors on\ndiabetes mellitus status, Aging, Status, and Sense of Control\nSense of Control Social Support\naAdjusted for age, obesity, and socioeconomic position\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nindividuals would be of low socioeconomic position,\nwhich is associated with DM [34]. In a study that exam-\nined the potential coverage bias in telephone surveys,\ninvestigators who used data from the NHANES III found\nthat those respondents without a telephone were more\nlikely to be both obese and diabetic [35]. This selection\nbias has the potential to underestimate the association\nbetween psychosocial factors and DM.\nMeasurement of the outcome was based on respondents'\nself-reports of DM status. In general, the prevalence of DM\nin the ASOC study population (5%) is similar to estimates\nbased on self-report from both the National Health Inter-\nview Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSystem [36,37]. Additionally, undiagnosed DM was not\nassessed. One study that used laboratory testing to verify\nDM diagnosis found the prevalence of undiagnosed DM\nto be 2.7% [38]. This bias also has the potential to under-\nestimate the associations of interest if the disease nega-\ntively affects one's sense of control or ability to maintain\none's social contacts. It was also not possible to distin-\nguish type I and type 2 DM in the ASOC survey. Although\nthey share some risk factors, type 1 and type 2 DM gener-\nally have different characteristics and courses. However,\nbecause of the low prevalence of type 1 DM in the general\nU.S. population (roughly 5%\u00ad10% of all DM) [7], and the\npopulation-based nature of this study sample, the ambi-\nguity of the type of DM is unlikely to bias the point esti-\nmates. Finally, because this study utilized cross-sectional\ndata (and prevalence instead of incidence), no determina-\ntions of causality are possible. Although it may be reason-\nable to assume that adverse psychosocial factors are risks\nfor DM, it is also possible that the reverse is true. Future\nresearch should include longitudinal studies to assess\ntemporality of the influence of psychosocial factors on the\nincidence of DM. In addition, future research may focus\non diagnostic criteria, as opposed to self-reported preva-\nlence, as evidence for DM. Distinguishing between levels\nof received and perceived support with incidence of DM\nmight also provide valuable associations.\nOver the last twenty years, DM has emerged as an epi-\ndemic in the United States [7]. It is estimated that the\nnumber of adults in the U.S. with diagnosed DM (includ-\nfurther projected to at least double by the year 2050\n[7,36]. The observed association of sense of control and\nDM prevalence in this study is suggestive of the contribu-\ntion of an adverse psychological environment in under-\nstanding the epidemiology of this condition and warrants\nfurther investigation. Particular attention in future\nresearch should be paid to the temporal nature of these\nfactors and the incidence of type 2 DM.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDr. Cardarelli conceptualized the study, conducted the\ndata analysis, and led the writing of the article.
