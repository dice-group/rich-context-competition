HIV Co-Morbidities and Co-Infections\nBackground. In the setting of expanded ART, there is increasing awareness that\nHIV-infected populations also face a dual burden of non-communicable diseases\n(NCDs). The aims of this study are to describe the differences in prevalence and access\nto care for diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) across the HIV Care Cascade in\n  and to assess the relationship between HIV infection, ART use\nand access to care for these major NCDs.\nMethods. The Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of INDEPTH\nCommunities (HAALSI) Study is a cohort of 5059 adults aged 40 and over based in\nsurvey collected self-reported demographic characteristics and health service utiliza-\ntion. Height, weight, blood pressure (BP), glucose, HIV antibody, viral load and expo-\nsure to ART (FTC/3TC) were measured. We calculated differences in access to care for\nDM and HTN among HIV-positive participants who had never received ART (HIV/\nNever ART), who had a detectable viral load on ART (ART/VL Detected) and who\nwere virally suppressed on ART (ART/Suppressed), compared to the HIV-negative\npopulation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used; all models were adjusted\nfor age, sex, BMI, educational attainment and wealth quintile.\nResults. DM prevalence in the HIV-positive groups ranged from 6.6 to 9.1% and\nHTN from 42.6 to 50.4%. Logistic regression models showed increased odds of ever\native population.\nConclusion. The burden of NCDs is substantial across the HIV Care Cascade in\nAgincourt. The HIV-positive population on ART also reported greater access to pre-\nventive care for NCDs. The positive spillover effects from ART utilization to preventive\ncare for other chronic conditions could provide a powerful vehicle for broader popu-\nlation health improvements via increased programmatic integration.\nDisclosures.
