    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the health, lifestyles, and goals of homeless male shelter users. The mixed-methods\ndescriptive non-experimental study was conducted at a homeless shelter cot program. The Dykeman biopsychosocial\ninterventional model was used as a framework for this study. Thirty men utilizing the program were interviewed using the\nChapin Lifestyle Assessment Survey. In addition, the men were asked about their social support system and goals. The results\ndemonstrated that the group had a strong sense of responsibility for their own actions, a desire to learn, and were motivated\nto make a meaningful contribution. Goals focused on obtaining employment and securing housing. Shelter staff was reported\nas a source of social support.\n",

It\nis evident that the appropriateness of the current structure of\nservices and modes of delivery require evaluation and modi-\nfication to meet existing needs. There has been limited litera-\nture that examines the health, lifestyles, and goals of the\nhomeless and potential interventions, which will move indi-\nviduals from homelessness to self-sufficiency and social\nreintegration. Community health nurses are in a key position\nto participate in interdisciplinary care models for the home-\nless through awareness of health, lifestyles, and identifica-\ntion of personal and vocational goals.\nLiterature Review\nDespite the interventions provided by various social services\nprograms and religious and governmental organizations,\nhomelessness continues to be a significant issue in the United\nStates. While it is impossible to measure with exact certainty\nthe number of individuals experiencing homelessness in a\nreported as homeless in January, 2012 (National Alliance to\nmodest decrease in homelessness of 0.4%, which is represen-\ntative of approximately 2,235 people (National Alliance to\nhomeless persons per 10,000 persons in the general popula-\ntion (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2013). The\nproblem has been perpetuated over the past two decades by\nthe lack of affordable housing and a concurrent increase in\npoverty. The poverty rate increased by approximately 5%\npoverty in 2011 (National Alliance to End Homelessness,\n2013). The circumstances leading to homelessness are\nnumerous and can be classified as personal, financial, and\nstructural (Christiani, Hudson, Nyamathi, Mutere, & Sweat,\n2008). Personal causes of homelessness include mental\nhealth issues, addiction, physical health issues, and domestic\nviolence. Structural and financial causes include lack of\nemployment, decreased access to health care, minimum\nwage jobs incapable of providing self-sufficiency, lack of\naffordable housing, foreclosure, recession, medical bank-\nruptcy, and decrease in public assistance programs.\nThe majority of homeless are single adults with a variety\nof complex medical, mental health and addiction issues. The\nmorbidity and mortality rates are higher for the homeless\npopulation as compared with the general population with\ncardiovascular diseases comprising the leading cause of\nIn many instances, the homeless population exists from\nday to day lacking a plan or sense of direction for the future.\nMany of the services currently in existence to serve the\nhomeless aggregate support a day to day existence by pro-\nviding meals and shelter but lack educational, vocational,\n1Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKelly A.

Most of the\nhomeless seeking assistance focus on meeting immediate\nneeds for food and shelter and do not address the issues that\nhave led to homelessness (O'Toole et al., 2007). To provide\nholistic care to the homeless, it is imperative that surround-\ning social and personal issues be addressed (Tsai, Mares, &\nindividuals often experience social isolation and stigmatiza-\ntion. Possessing an affiliation with a group or organization\nprovides the individuals a sense of societal belonging,\nthereby facilitating social reintegration (Tsai et al., 2012).\nHomeless adults may better benefit from a model of long-\nterm management rather than crisis management of food and\nshelter (Kim, Ford, Howard, & Bradford, 2010). Supportive\nhousing alone does not affect societal reintegration of home-\nless adults. Providing choice and a sense of control over\none's living environment may slightly affect psychological\nwell-being and satisfaction with housing in this population\nTo move individuals from poverty, addiction, chronic dis-\nease, and homelessness to self-sufficiency and reintegration\ninto society, the provision of structured, goal-oriented pro-\ngramming is essential. One such biopsychosocial interven-\ntional model is multidimensional and is designed to meet the\ncomplex and holistic needs of the homeless population\n(Dykeman, 2011). The model includes four components. The\nfirst component is initial interface with the homeless client\nwhere basic physical and safety needs are assessed and\naddressed. The second phase focuses on mental health status\nand cognitive capabilities as well as the as the ability to\naccess community resources. This adaptive functional\nassessment describes the client's skill set for coping with\nvarious social and environmental demands such as relation-\nships, school, and work. The need for referrals and associ-\nated case management is often identified. The third\nintervention phase focuses on psychological counseling to\naddress lifestyle issues surrounding work and social demands\nas well as self-concept and spirituality. The fourth phase of\nthe intervention addresses client advocacy. This is accom-\nplished when working on a one on one basis with clients and\nalso when assisting them as they negotiate local, regional,\nand federal resources. This type of supportive housing and\ncomprehensive case management provides the much-needed\nresources beyond the basics of meals and shelter to assure\nthat the personal, social, and environmental issues leading to\nhomelessness are addressed.\nWhile there is an abundance of literature describing the\nchallenges and experiences of the homeless in terms of physi-\ncal, mental, and social challenges, few studies examine the\nperspectives of the homeless population in terms of health,\nlifestyle, and goals. To effectively care for the homeless\npopulation, it is imperative that health care professionals\npossess insight into and awareness in these areas. Ideally, the\nfunction of shelters should be to provide temporary crisis or\ntransitional residence in conjunction with active and ongoing\ncollaboration with the homeless population on goal-directed\neducational and vocational training, which facilitates self-\nsufficiency instead of merely providing for basic necessities.\nSupporting housing models need to focus on social reinte-\ngration and improvement of clients' life satisfaction (Tsai\nnurses are in a key position to participate in interdisciplinary\nteams and provide expertise in case management, wellness,\nhealth promotion, and maintenance.\nMethod\nTo further expand the body of knowledge related to the\nhealth, lifestyles, and goals of homeless men, a study was\nconducted at a homeless shelter with an overnight cot pro-\ngram for homeless men in a Midwestern city. The study was\na mixed-methods design of descriptive statistical analysis\nand naturalistic inquiry using qualitative data (Patton, 1990).\nHomelessness was theoretically defined as \"an individual or\nfamily living in a supervised publically or privately operated\nshelter designated to provide temporary living arrange-\nments\"(U.S.DepartmentofHousingandUrbanDevelopment\n[HUD] Homeless Emergency and Rapid Transition to\ndefined as residents sleeping in the local shelter cot program.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment Survey (Chapin & Ivey, 2004) was\nused to measure health and lifestyles. Open-ended interview\nquestions inquired into events leading to homelessness, long-\nand short-term personal goals, and social support. Interviews\nwere conducted by a male registered nurse research assistant.\nThis nurse was chosen due to his prior relationship with the\nmen and their comfort with the nurse.\nSample and Procedure\nThere was an average of 40 to 50 men sleeping at the shelter\nnightly. A convenience sample of 30 homeless men was\ninterviewed. All men sleeping at the shelter were above the\nage of 18 years. Participants were solicited during the morn-\ning breakfast. Those choosing to participate received two bus\npasses and a bottle of water as an incentive for participation.\nAfter an individual introduction to the study by the inter-\nviewer, informed consent was understood if the individual\nverbally chose to proceed with the interview. The study was\napproved by the agency and the university institutional\nreview board.\nInstrumentation\nParticipants were interviewed using the LifestyleAssessment\nSchwend et al. 3\nquestions on a 5-point Likert-type scale. There were six sub-\nscales dividing lifestyle into Physical Health, Emotional\nWell-Being,IntellectualEnrichment,Life\u00adWorkSatisfaction,\nSocial Effectiveness, and Spiritual Awareness. Each subscale\nconsisted of 10 statements reflective of a positive lifestyle.\nParticipants were asked to rate their lifestyle behaviors with\na maximum score of 50 in each subscale. Possible total\nscores range from 60 to 300 with higher scores indicating\nmore positive lifestyle behaviors and lower scores\nindicating less positive lifestyle behaviors and a need for\nimprovement.\nIn addition, participants were interviewed regarding their\nsocial support system, events leading to homelessness, and\ntheir personal goals for the week, month, and year.\nDemographic variables included age, number of years home-\nless, and level of education. The interview format was cho-\nsen due to a potential lack of reading ability and to assure\ncomprehension of the survey items, and to allow for open-\nended questions that encourage free responses. Participants\nwere able to seek clarification regarding statements. Each\ninterview took place in a private setting located in the shelter\nand lasted approximately 30 min.\nResults\nThe results of the study found the average age of homeless\nmen to be 45 years with ranges of 24 to 69 years. Eighty-six\npercent completed high school or additional education. The\nmajority of men were found to be on the street 1 to 5 years\nwith outliers ranging from 10 to 44 years.\nThe mean score for the participants on the Lifestyles\nthis score indicated the group as \"having the right idea but\nmore work is needed\" according to the Lifestyle Assessment\nSurvey. Internal consistency of items on survey was demon-\nstrated with a Cronbach's alpha of .917. Survey item means\nindicate areas that lend opportunity for programming and\nlifestyle improvement. Individual questions were reviewed,\nand 7 mean scores were at or above 4.0/5.0. Three individ-\nual questions had mean scores of 2.0/5.0 or less. See\nThe mean total score of the Lifestyle Assessment Survey\nwas compared for the men who reported being homeless for\nless than 2 years with the total score of those reporting being\nhomeless for 2 years or more. It was hypothesized that those\nbeing homeless for a longer time would report a less healthy\nlifestyle. There was no significant difference between the\nFor the analysis of the open-ended questions, a cross-case\nanalysis was done individually by three researchers to\ndescribe the data. Each question was reviewed, and items\nwere grouped by topic and color coded. Subsequently,\nresearchers gathered to compare grouped items and discuss\nthe interpretation of the data.\nThere were a variety of responses to the question associ-\nated with events leading to homelessness. The responses\nwere grouped into four categories: relationships, economic,\nsubstance abuse, and health. Relationship responses were\nrelated to loss; many had divorced or lost a parent who had\nbeen providing a home. Economic responses were related to\njob loss, money mismanagement, and child support. The loss\nof a driver's license also affected ability to find employment.\nMany study participants were forthright with responses\nrelated to substance abuse. Alcoholism, drug abuse, and mul-\ntiple DUIs (driving under the influence) were reported as\nevents leading to homelessness. In addition, substance-\nabuse-related health issues including depression, multiple\nsurgeries, and a bleeding disorder were reported as factors\nleading to homelessness.\nAll of the study participants had personal goals. Short-\nterm goals focused on employment, whereas long-term goals\nwere related to housing. The immediate or weekly goals\nwere related to getting sober, being healthy, and finding a\njob. Monthly goals included finding a home, while goals for\nthe year were staying sober, getting a job, finding a home,\nand finding transportation.\nFriendship and emotional support were reported from\nmany men. Most participants reported having family and\nfriends. Some singled out parents and siblings. In addition,\nthe shelter staff was reported to be a source of social\nsupport.\nLimitations\nA significant limitation of the study was the lack of a com-\nparison group for the assessment tool. Specific metrics were\nnot available from the author. In addition, the tool may have\nnot been the most appropriate to utilize with this population.\nIt is possible the tool did not capture data specific to this\npopulation, particularly information regarding physical\nhealth and health promotion behaviors. Finally, the sample\nsize was small, and interviews were conducted by one inter-\nviewer at one homeless shelter with an exclusive male popu-\nlation. Therefore, results may not be generalizable.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the health, lifestyles,\nand goals of homeless male shelter users. The literature\ndescribing these concepts in the homeless population is lim-\nited. The findings of this study suggest that this sample of\nhomeless men have a broad range of lifestyle behaviors and\npersonal goals. Many of the study participants, like many\nhomeless, have made poor lifestyle choices related to sub-\nstance abuse, which in turn, resulted in their homelessness.\nThe mean of the total score on the Lifestyle Assessment\nSurvey demonstrates this population is in need of assistance\nto increase healthy lifestyle choices, health promotion, and\nhealth maintenance behaviors. To best address the broad\n4 SAGE Open\nrange of needs of this population, an interdisciplinary\napproach utilizing a biopsychosocial model (Dykeman,\n2011) is essential. Services for the homeless population must\nprovide interdisciplinary interventions including supportive\nhousing, which facilitates social reintegration, assistance\nwith obtaining employment or vocational training, and the\nprovision of comprehensive health care services.\nIn the Dykeman (2011) model, physical and safety needs\nare initially assessed. Although basic safety needs are being\naddressed in the shelter cot program, physical and health\npromotion parameters were demonstrated as lacking. Mean\nscores on the Physical Health subscale were the lowest of all\naerobic exercise, it can be assumed this is related to walking\naround town as they have no permanent housing or shelter at\nthis emergency facility. More structured exercise programs\ncould benefit these men. To address the issue of physical fit-\nness, community health nurses must be innovative in their\napproach and encourage aerobic activities in ways the home-\nless population can easily access and participate. Street soc-\ncer is one such activity that has demonstrated success\n(Randers et al., 2012). Incentivizing organized exercise or\nwalking programs may increase daily aerobic activity. Other\nitem means in the Physical Health subscale were very low.\nTable 1.

The community health\nnurse might refer or design programs in smoking cessation\nand/or partner with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or\nNarcotics Anonymous (NA). Additional health measures of\ndiet, health exams, substance abuse, rest, and relaxation are\nnot typically under the control of the homeless. Therefore,\nthe Physical Health subscale may not have been ideal to\naccurately assess physical health parameters in the homeless\npopulation.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale on Emotional\nof responsibility for one's actions, an acceptance of self and\nlife circumstances, possessing a sense of humor, and deriv-\ning enjoyment from life. It is both troubling and noteworthy\nthat the lowest subscale item mean ascertaining whether the\nindividual felt loved was 2.1/5.0. Overall, despite being\nhomeless, the resiliency of the human spirit prevailed, and\nindividuals reported a relatively high degree of emotional\nwell-being and acceptance of their life station.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale on Intellectual\nsix subscales. Although participants reported they enjoyed\nlearning new information, the opportunities to express cre-\nativity, enjoy a variety of entertainment, and acquire and\nshare new information are limited in a shelter setting. Nurses\nin collaboration with community agencies can provide pro-\ngraming on a variety of health topics, entertainment, creative\nart and music classes, and speakers with discussion on cur-\nrent world events.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment subscale on Life\u00adWork\nSatisfaction mean (35.1/50.0) was the highest of the six sub-\nscales. Participants reported being motivated to make a\nmeaningful contribution, were willing to accept new or extra\nresponsibilities, and were receptive to feedback regarding\ntheir life work. The mean for an item in the subscale related\nto the balance between life work and leisure was particularly\nlow (2.8/5.0). This is most likely reflective of the survival\nmode reality in which homeless individuals exist. Shelter\nprogram directors are in a position to facilitate partnerships\nwith agencies and community colleges for skills training and\njob placement.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale mean on\nsubscale item related to involvement in the local community\n(2.0/5.0) is likely reflective of the social isolation a marginal-\nized group experiences. The highest mean for an item on the\nsubscale was related to acceptance of others of a different\nrace, gender, or faith (4.1/5.0). Although shelter residents\nmay not feel part of the local community, a sense of belong-\ning and a culture of friendship exist. The men enjoy camara-\nderie with fellow residents. Shelter staff were frequently\nreported to be a source of social support and identified as\nfamily.\nThe Lifestyle Assessment Survey subscale mean for\ning the beliefs of others (3.8/5.0) and acting to help and care\nfor others (3.7/5.0) were the highest. This is also supported\nby the reported sense of community in the interviews related\nto social support. Similarly, Tsai and Rosenheck (2011) con-\ncluded that assessing and promoting spirituality may benefit\nhomeless populations in both clinical and psychological\noutcomes.\nA hallmark finding in this study was the lack of feelings\nof esteem from others, as participants had to contemplate\nwhether or not they felt loved. Dykeman's (2011) third inter-\nvention phase recommends a focus on counseling surround-\ning work, social demands, and spirituality. Health\nprofessionals at this shelter need to be aware that shelter per-\nsonnel may be identified as \"family\" and, therefore, are an\nimportant source of social support. Therapeutic relationships\nand professional boundaries must be negotiated by nurses\nand social services personnel while being viewed by home-\nless clients as supportive and caring. Finally, persons who\nwere previously homeless identified that a critical compo-\nnent of moving off of the streets was someone reaching out\nto them (MacKnee & Mervyn, 2002). It is important that\ncommunity health nurses and other health professionals\ninterfacing with this population validate and promote these\nattributes, as this will facilitate the process of goal setting\nand attainment necessary to move from homelessness to\nself-sufficiency.\nIn the Dykeman (2011) model, the second intervention\nphase addresses cognitive capabilities and mental health sta-\ntus. It is noteworthy that 86% of the sample reported gradu-\nating from high school. This level of educational attainment\nsuggests a strong potential for success with vocational train-\ning. Future services directed toward this population should\nfocus on educational and vocational programs that chal-\nlenge and encourage these men to succeed. Goals should be\ndirected toward attaining and maintaining sobriety, obtain-\ning appropriate housing, and securing employment.\nCommunity health nurses must partner with addiction\nrecovery specialists and social services personnel to facili-\ntate optimal outcomes for this population. Transitioning\nfrom homelessness into a community residence is a tremen-\ndous undertaking because of the complex psychosocial\nissues inherent in the homeless population. Homeless per-\nsons will require more assistance and support while navigat-\ning the social service system after obtaining housing, as\nobtaining housing alone is not sufficient. On obtaining\nhousing, continued and long-term additional assistance in\nthe form of supportive housing and active case management\nis necessary to improve outcomes. Ongoing social support\ncan facilitate improvement in physical and mental health\noutcomes (Stein, Nyamathi, & Zane, 2009). Continued\nmonitoring and support will facilitate a successful transition\n6 SAGE Open\nCommunity health nurses possess the knowledge, atti-\ntude, and skills to lead and take the initiative in the develop-\nment of a tool to more accurately assess the health and\nlifestyles of the homeless. Traditional tools may not accu-\nrately assess physical health and health promotion behaviors.\nFurther study, which includes a modified assessment of those\nparameters, is warranted. Interventions must be tailored to\nmeet the unique and individual needs of this population.\nFinally, community health nurses must assume a leadership\nrole and advocate for changes in public policy and streamlin-\ning of services, which facilitate the process of social reinte-\nAuthors' Note\nThis manuscript has not been published elsewhere, nor has it been\nsubmitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article\nReferences\nChapin, L.
