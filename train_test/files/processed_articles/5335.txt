Thoracotomy, extracorporeal cir-\nculation, aortic cross-clamping, high-dose\nanticoagulation, and single lung ventilation\ncan be avoided. Several studies have shown\nthat the mortality rate following EVAR for\ntype B TAD is acceptably low at 1.5% to\n8%.4\u00ad6 However, despite short- and mid-\nterm promising clinical results of this new\ntherapy, the long-term durability of EVAR\nhas not been established. Similar to\nall conventional surgical methods, EVAR\nfor type B TAD is associated with\ncomplications.\nWepresentourexperienceofcomplications\nfollowing TAD endovascular procedures, and\nfocus on the occurrence, management, and\nprevention of complications.\nMethod\nPatient cohort\nment admitted 58 patients without Marfan\nsyndrome who had undergone a thoracic\nendovascular stent\u00adgraft (SG) procedure for\nacute or chronic type B TAD and developed\nserious complications.\nTwenty-seven patients underwent emer-\ngency TEVAR (after onset < 72 hours) for\nacute TAD, 16 patients received selected\nTEVAR (after onset > 2 weeks) for acute\nTAD, and eight patients underwent TEVAR\n72 hours to 2 weeks after onset.\nEndovascular procedures were performed\nin seven patients with chronic asymptomatic\ndissection. Thirty-nine patients developed\nsymptomatic complications postoperation\nmonths). Nineteen asymptomatic complica-\ntions were detected at the follow-up after\na SG was deployed (mean postoperative\nThe patients' complications are listed in\nTable 1.

Serious complications after stent grafting\nfor type B dissection.\nComplications Number Percentage\nSG migration and\nincorrect deployment\nInvestigation and imaging studies\nComputed tomography (CT)-angiography of\nthe entire aorta with three-dimensional recon-\nstruction was performed in all of the patients\nto investigate complications after the endo-\nvascular procedure. Several variables were\ncarefully determined on contrast-enhanced\nCT images and angiographic images. These\nincluded the location and shape of a previ-\nously planted SG, the true lumen, the false\nlumen, extension, the entry and re-entry sites,\nand the relationship between the dissection\nmembrane and major aortic branches.\nStent\u00adgraft device and grafts\nFour types of SG were used in this series,\nincluding the Talent and Captivia\n(Medtronic, USA), TX-1/TX-2 (Cook,\nUSA), and Hercules (Microport, China)\nstraight tube devices. One bare stent, Sinus\n(OptiMed, Germany), was also used. All of\nthe SGs were available in different lengths\nand sizes. The bare stents were also sized by\nindividual diameters. PTFE grafts (Gore,\nUSA) were used for surgical bypass.\nClassification of complications and\ntreatment\n1. Endoleak\nEndoleaks were detected in 16 patients,\nincluding 12 type 1 endoleaks and four type\n2 endoleaks from the left subclavian artery\n(LSA). We treated five patients with type 1\nendoleak with additional SGs proximal to\nthe original SG, and we treated three\npatients by ballooning the original SG. All\nof the endoleaks disappeared postopera-\ntively. Four type 1 patients were treated by\nconservative medical treatment with no\nenlargement of the false lumen. Four\ntype 2 leaks from the LSA were sealed by\ncoil embolization.\n2. Distal true lumen collapse\nSixteen patients had distal true lumen\ncollapse following deployment of SGs. Four\nof them developed a secondary rupture and\nhaemothorax. All of the patients were treated\nwith two additional SGs or one SG with one\nbare stent. First, we implanted a smaller bare\nstent or SG extension in the distal aorta. A\nlarge SG was then placed in the proximal\naorta to block the intimal tear and attach the\nprevious SG and distal stent (Figure 1).\n3. Retrograde dissection\nSix retrograde type A dissections were\nfound. One patient had serious chest pain\nand underwent surgical intervention by\nascending aorta replacement. Five patients\nreceived conservative medical treatment and\nwere provided follow-up care after discharge\nbecause of advanced age and a poor physical\ncondition.\n4. Paraplegia/paraparesis\nOnly one patient with complete paralysis\nhad undergone an aortic arch replacement\nsurgery before EVAR (Figure 2). We treated\nthis condition with thrombolytic therapy\nusing urokinase and anticoagulation ther-\napy with low-molecular-weight heparin.\nSix patients suffered strokes. Primary\nstrokes occurred in all of the patients\nbecause of forward pushing of the SG that\nled to covering of the left carotid artery.\nFour patients underwent emergency surgical\nbypass operations (Figure 3). The other two\npatients who were transferred from another\nhospital 2 months after the endovascular\nprocedure only received conservative med-\nical treatment because of a lack of time for\nemergency surgery.\nSG migration and mistaken deployment\nFour misaligned deployments of the SG\noccurred, and angiography showed that the\nproximal bare stents were bent outward and\nfolded over the SG (Figure 4). One patient\nunderwent an open surgical operation invol-\nving aortic replacement, and the other three\nwere maintained in follow-up.\nWe also experienced two cases involving\nincorrect recognition of the true lumen, in\nwhich SGs were directly placed into the false\nlumen. These two patients were treated by\ndeploying several long SGs into the aorta\nsuch that the proximal lumen and the distal\ntrue lumen were connected by the SGs\nthrough the false lumen (Figure 5).\n6. Lower limb ischaemia\nFive patients developed lower limb\nischaemia after the procedure. Two of\nthem underwent surgical thrombectomy\nand artery angioplasty. An emergency\nFigure 1. (a) CT shows a type B dissection that was repaired by a SG. (b) Six months after EVAR, a distal\ntrue lumen collapse was observed. (c) This collapse was treated using two SG implants. First, a smaller SG\nfitting the distal lumen was deployed to prevent true lumen collapse, and then a large SG fitted to the previous\nSG was implanted.\nFigure 2. A patient with complete paralysis with\nprevious aortic arch replacement surgery and long\ndescending aortic coverage.\nFigure 3. Bypass surgery was performed to\nrescue patients with an SG covering the left carotid\nartery.\nfemoral\u00adfemoral artery bypass was per-\nformed in one patient. Delayed lower limb\nischaemia occurred in the other two\npatients. We performed a femoral\u00adfemoral\nbypass in one patient and a stent implant\nfollowing balloon dilatation in the other\npatient.\n7. Stent\u00adgraft fracture\nAn SG fracture occurred in two patients.\nThesepatientsdevelopedacutechestpainafter\nthe SG implant for several years. CT showed\nthat the SG fractured and the false lumen\nexpanded. We deployed new SGs to repair the\nbroken SG and false lumen (Figure 6).\nFollow-up investigation\nThe median follow-up time was 29.5 months\n(range: 2\u00ad45 months). Physical examin-\nations and enhanced CT post-discharge\nwere performed at 6 months, 12 months,\nand annually thereafter.\nResults\nEndovascular, open surgical, or medical\nmanagement were performed in the patients.\nAll of the secondary operations succeeded.\n(1/58) for patients undergoing management.\nFour patients died during follow-up.\nThe survival rate in our group was 91.4%\nNine of the 12 type 1 endoleaks were\nclosed by secondary endovascular proced-\nures or conservative medical treatment.\nThree of the type 1 endoleaks were still\npresent with no evidence of aortic enlarge-\nment. One patient with a type 1 endoleak\ndied during follow-up because of aortic\nrupture resulting from poor blood pressure\ncontrol. All type 2 endoleaks were closed by\ncoils or occluders.\nAll of the patients with distal true lumen\ncollapse (16/16) received endovascular man-\nagement. All of the newly developed distal\ndissection disappeared and no new compli-\ncations occurred during follow-up\n(Figure 1).\nOne of the six patients with retrograde\ntype A dissection who underwent surgical\nintervention by ascending aorta replacement\nsurvived. Five patients with conservative\nmedical treatment survived, but two\nshowed obvious aortic enlargement, and\nultimately died because of aortic rupture.\nThe other three patients died of other causes\nthat did not appear to be related to retro-\ngrade type A dissection.\nThe only patient with paraplegia\nremained unhealed. Four of the six patients\nwith stroke underwent emergency surgical\nbypass operations, and three of them recov-\nered with slight sequelae (Figure 3). One\npatient died 1 week after the operation. The\nother two patients with stroke remained\nunhealed with no obvious change.\nOne of the four patients with SG migra-\ntion recovered after surgical intervention by\nascending aorta replacement. Two patients\nrecovered after endovascular repair by an\nadditional covered SG proximal to the\nFigure 4. Image showing a proximal bare stent\nthat is bent outward and folded over the SG.\noriginal SG. One patient was treated by\nconservative medical treatment with no\nenlargement of the false lumen. One of two\npatients with mistaken deployment died\nbecause of severe SG migration and aortic\nrupture 30 months after secondary EVAR\n(Figure 5). Another patient who received a\nconventional operation was still alive at\nfollow-up.\nAll of the patients with lower limb ischae-\nmia recovered after surgical intervention\nand appeared to be in good health. All of\nthe patients with SG fracture recovered after\ndeploying new SGs to repair the broken SG\nand false lumen.\nDiscussion\nThe first endovascular repairs of type B\naortic dissection were reported in 1999 by\nDake et al.7 and Nienaber et al.8 Since this\ntime, many clinical reports have shown that\nendovascular repair is technically feasible\nand has a significantly lower rate of\nFigure 5. (a, b) Angiograph showing an SG in the false lumen. (c) Two other long SGs were deployed into\nthe false lumen to connect to the distal true lumen. (d) After 30 months, the patient had severe chest pain and\nhaemothorax. An X-ray shows that the SG is out of shape.\ncomplications compared with conventional\nlow early operative morbidity and mortality,\nlater serious complications related to EVAR\n(e.g., development of aneurysms, aortic\nrupture, stroke, paraplegia, limb ischaemia,\naccess-related complications, and endo-\nleaks) have been increasingly reported.4,5,10\nTherefore, every surgeon should consider\nmethods for reducing the incidence of com-\nplications of EVAR for type B dissection.\nDetailed preoperative assessment of\npatients should be carefully performed. In\naddition to the general condition, observa-\ntion and measurement of aortic dissection\nimages are required. Some items must be\ndetermined, such as the true lumen, false\nlumen, entry and re-entry sites, location and\nextension of the lesion, diameter of the\naorta, tortuosity of the aorta, access arteries,\nand the relationship between the dissection\nmembrane and major arterial branches. The\neffects of EVAR treatment are closely\nrelated to preoperative evaluation and selec-\ntion of cases, configuration and type of SG,\nas well as the clinical experience of the\nsurgeon.\nEndovascular procedures are accompa-\nnied by various types of risks, especially for\ncomplex aortic lesions. The incidence of\ncomplications is closely correlated with the\nsurgeon's skill and advanced endovascular\nequipment.12 Therefore, EVAR treatment\nshould be carried out in highly specialized\nvascular centres where the requirement can\nbe met to routinely perform open and\nendovascular procedures. This would help\nto cope with accidents in an effective and\ntimely manner.\nThe time of endovascular intervention for\naortic dissection is still controversial. We\nbelieve that EVAR for dissection should not\nproceed from 3 days to 3 weeks since the\nonset because of oedema, weakness, and\npoor flexibility and tensility of the aortic\nwalls. We found that severe complications\nwere more common if EVAR was carried\nout within 3 weeks. Therefore, if there was\nno organ or lower limb ischaemia, we still\ninsisted that EVAR should occur 3 weeks\nFigure 6. (a) Angiograph showing a fractured SG and the false lumen is expanded. (b) A new SG was\ndeployed to repair the broken SG.\nafter the dissection. To avoid risks, EVAR\nshould be performed in an emergency\n(<72 hrs) or selectively (>3 weeks).\nHowever, for considerable complications,\nalso believe that asymptomatic chronic\npatients may benefit more from conservative\ntreatment than from EVAR.\nWith continuous improvements of SGs\nand development of endovascular tech-\nniques, indications of EVAR for aortic\ndissections are also expanding. However,\nbecause of limits of the SG structure, indi-\ncations for intervention should be strictly\nselected to improve the efficacy. There are\nsome relative contraindications to EVAR\nfor aortic dissection. In particular, EVAR\nshould be contraindicated when the anat-\nomy of dissection prevents a safe and effect-\nive performance of the SG that often\nremarkably increases the complication\nrates. EVAR in patients with an aortic size\noutside the range of available SG devices\nshould be avoided. Severe tortuosity of the\naorta or the access vessels and advanced\naortoiliac occlusive disease preclude the\nsafety of EVAR. EVAR should also be\navoided in patients with a poor general\ncondition, those with no tolerance of the\nprocedures, and those with serious disorders\nwith an expected survival < 2 years.\nEndoleak is the most common complica-\ntion of endovascular treatment. The inci-\ndence of EVAR for a thoracic aorta\nApproximately half of the endoleaks may\nclose spontaneously. Short-term follow-up\nin a previous study showed that there were\nno significant survival differences between\npatients with endoleaks closing and non-\nclosing endoleaks.6 However, long-term\nendoleaks, especially type I endoleaks, may\ncause an intimal tear to continuously open,\nand blood flow may persist in the false\nlumen, thus affecting the long-term effects.\nThe main reasons for this situation include a\ntortuous aorta that may cause the SG to not\ncompletely attach to the aortic wall or SG\nbending, an anchor zone that is too short, an\nSG that is too small or too large, and a\nfragile proximal aorta. Careful preoperative\nevaluation and selection of the appropriate\nSG configuration should be carried out to\nincrease the proximal and distal landing\nzones to prevent the occurrence of endo-\nleaks. If endoleak occurs, balloon dilatation\nand SG expansion may help to close the\nendoleak. Small, stable endoleaks can be\ntreated by medication and observation if\nthere is no false lumen growth.15\nNeurological complications can be devas-\ntating after EVAR for type B dissections.\nStroke occurs at similar rates between open\nand endovascular repairs.10 Deployment of\nthe proximal end of the SG proximal to the\nleft carotid artery can cause a fatal stoke.\nEmergency revascularization has to be per-\nformed as soon as possible for such patients\nto survive. Moreover, perioperative stroke\nmay occur secondary to manipulation of the\narch with catheters, wires, balloons, and SG\ndevices at the origin of the cerebral vessels.\nProficiency of an endovascular technique is\nimportant and can minimize the risks.\nEVAR shows a marked reduction in\nparaplegia/paraparesis compared with\nopen procedures.16 This may be related to\navoidance of thoracic clamping and reduced\nhaemodynamic disturbance at the spinal\ncord level. However, there is a decrease in\ncerebrospinal perfusion pressure when over-\nstenting feeding intercostals.5 Surgeons\nshould exercise caution in patients with\nprevious open surgery of the thoracic or\nabdominal aortas. Overstenting of too long\na segment of the total descending thoracic\naorta should be avoided. Spinal drainage\ntechniques and steroids can be used to\nprevent these complications.\nEven after successful placement of SGs in\ntype B dissection, the distal descending\nthoracic aortic segment is still a problem.\nIn the presence of a larger distal SG size and\nsmaller distal true lumen dimension, the\ndescending thoracic aortic segment of the\nfalse lumen shows no tendency to thrombose\nand remodel completely. However, this can\nlead to late distal true lumen collapse. An\nextended bare stent or short SG scaffolding\nof the dissection beyond the main SG and\ndown to the distal aorta results in repos-\nitioning and fixation of the distal lamella.\nThis technique can be applied as an adjunct-\nive measure to primary SG insertion to\nprevent distal true lumen collapse.17 This\nmethod also has the capacity to repair such\ncomplications in a secondary procedure. A\ntapered SG adapted to variations in aortic\nsize could solve this problem. However,\nbecause this requires customization of the\nSG individually, it may not be applicable to\nemergency procedures.\nRetrograde type A dissection within hours\nor even 1 month after EVAR is not a rare\ncomplication and can be life-threatening,\nespecially when a type B tear has been over-\nstented close to or opposite to the left\nsubclavian ostium.18 Fragility of the aortic\nwall and progression of disease, combined\nwith SG-related causes, contribute to occur-\nrence of retrograde type A dissection.\nImprovement of the SG system, careful selec-\ntion of SGs and patients, and specialized\nendovascular manipulation may prevent such\ncomplications. Surgical and medical treat-\nment can be effective management strategies.\nMistaken deployment can occur during\ndeployment of thoracic SGs because of a\nhigh flow rate and severe aortic angulation,\nwhich are often encountered in the thoracic\naorta. This mistake is an unusual phenom-\nenon that tends to occur in the context of\ncertain well-defined anatomical conditions\nin the thoracic aorta. To date, most of these\nevents have not led to major adverse\nsequelae. However, careful selection of\npatients, periprocedural imaging, and case\nplanning can help to identify anatomy in\nwhich a misaligned opening is likely to\noccur, allowing physicians to avoid this\nSG fractures are rare. They occur in\nirregular homemade products. Products\nmust undergo formal government approval.\nStrict laws regarding quality should be\nmade, with establishment of criteria for\nquality inspection and setting up of a regu-\nlatory body to ensure that the criteria are\nstrictly adhered to.\nWith the EVAR technique being widely\nperformed, an increasing number of inex-\nperienced operators have started to perform\nendovascular repair for type B dissection. A\nlack of assessment for lesions and an\ninappropriate choice of SG could cause\nsevere consequences. These consequences\ninclude SG migration and incorrect deploy-\nment, which are difficult to deal with.\nStandard specialized treatment will reduce\nthe occurrence of such complications.\nTherefore, every surgeon should undergo\nstandardized professional training before\nstarting EVAR for aortic diseases.\nFor lesions involving the aortic arch,\nimportant arterial branches, and a short\nanchor zone (so-called complex dissections),\nuse of a common configuration of SG often\nleads to various types of severe complica-\ntions. These complications include endo-\nleak, organ ischaemia, unstable SG\nimplants, and SG migration. LSA over-\nstenting can increase the anchor zone.\nWith preoperative evaluation of transcranial\ncrossflow facilities and the absence of car-\notid stenosis, it is well tolerated without\ntransposition of the LSA.6,10 According to\nthe range of dissections, a hybrid procedure\ncombines vessel debranching, and endovas-\ncular repair can be chosen for complex\ndissections. There have been no reports of\ncerebral ischaemia after hybrid proced-\ncovered or bare stent that is deployed par-\nallel to the main aortic SG, which can\npreserve flow to branches by the aortic SG.\nStandard off-the-shelf SGs can be used to\ninstantly treat lesions with inadequate\nanchor zones.22,23 However, this may also\ncause more endoleaks. Specially designed\nfenestrated or branched SGs can seal the\ncomplex dissection and reconstruct import-\nant arterial branches. However, currently,\nthis endovascular procedure is still under\nclinical trial and cannot be widely\nConclusion\nAlthough long-term data are still unavail-\nable, the advantages of TEVAR over con-\nventional descending aortic surgery are\nclear. TEVAR is minimally invasive, results\nin less blood loss, requires a shorter oper-\nation time, is easier to operate, leads to\nfaster postoperative recovery, and results in\nmuch shorter hospitalizations compared\nwith other techniques. TEVAR also reduces\nthe incidence of common postoperative\ncomplications in organs, such as the heart,\nlungs, and kidney. Older patients or those\nwith severe co-morbidities can be effectively\ntreated with this technique.\nCurrently, TEVAR is becoming the gold\nstandard for type B TAD. Despite the\nfavourability of TEVAR, notably, compli-\ncations that are unique to endovascular\nprocedures may occur, and acute or delayed\ncomplications may occur. A reduction in\nthese complications could be achieved by\noptimal evaluation of patients, selection of\nSGs, and specialized endovascular manipu-\nlation. Further studies are still needed to\ninvestigate life-long surveillance and long-\nterm clinical effects of TEVAR.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
