Among others, Bils and\nKlenow (2004) and Dhyne et al. (2004) investigate the issue of the frequency of price adjustments\nfor CPI data in several sectors of the United States and the euro area. While, on average, about 15%\nof prices in the euro area and 25% in the United States are adjusted each month, dispersion across\nsectors is most relevant. In the euro area and the United States, energy and unprocessed food prices\ndisplay the highest frequency of price adjustment, while service prices are the stickiest.\nAnother fairly well established fact is the puzzling \"caution\" that central banks, and the\nFederal Reserve in particular, seem to adopt in the conduct of monetary policy. Rudebusch and\nSevnsson (1999), for example, estimate a small-scale model of the United States economy and,\nassuming a commonly accepted loss function for the central bank, show that the optimal Taylor rule\nin their setting has much larger coefficients on inflation and the output gap than the actual\n(estimated) Taylor rule of the Federal Reserve. Sack (2000) provides more evidence by performing\na similar exercise and showing that the response of the federal funds rate to five identified economic\nshocks should be stronger than what is actually observed.\nThis paper argues that the two stylized facts above may be linked. In fact, both the\neconomic literature and the practice of policy-making assign a relevant role to core inflation\nindices. These indices filter out high frequency fluctuations from prices in order to improve the\nunderstanding of medium-term inflationary pressures on the economy (for a survey of methods see\nCristadoro et al., 2005). In particular, simple core inflation indices are derived by eliminating the\nmost volatile components (usually, unprocessed food and energy prices) from the aggregate price\nindex. How does this practice of central banks affect their behavior? In particular, do central banks\nbehave more or less aggressively by using core inflation rather than overall inflation as a measure to\nassess inflationary pressures?\nAoki (2001) studies an economy featuring a continuum of sticky price goods and one\nflexible price good and shows that, in this economy, an optimizing central bank should fully\nstabilize inflation in the sticky price sector rather than overall inflation. Sticky price inflation,\nresponding to smoothed expectations of output gaps and relative price changes, is defined as core\ninflation to the extent that it captures a persistent component of inflation. Both the form of nominal\nrigidities in Aoki (2001) and the definition of core inflation are maintained in this paper.\nHowever, in contrast to Aoki (2001), this paper assumes the existence of nonnegligible\ntransaction frictions. This creates a trade-off between macroeconomic stabilization (that is,\nstabilization of inflation and the output gap) and interest rate stabilization, a feature that is rather\nplausible empirically. As a result of this assumption, full stabilization of core inflation is no longer\nthe only desired target of the optimizing central bank. Then, the equilibrium solution for inflation,\naggregate activity and the interest rate conditional to the policy rule followed by the central bank\nare derived, based on two assumptions.\nFirst, it is assumed that the central bank can only implement an optimal noninertial plan as\nin Woodford (1999): the policy instrument is assumed to be a linear function of only present and\nfuture values of policy relevant variables. Conditional to the optimal non-inertial plan, the dynamics\nof the economy can be derived analytically in order to identify the drivers of the aggressiveness in\nthe reaction of the interest rate to shocks. Comparing the outcomes in the economy with\nheterogeneous price setters (heterogeneous economy) with those in an economy with 100% of\nsticky price goods (hereafter, baseline New Keynesian economy, described in Woodford, 1999), it\nturns out that the optimal non-inertial plan in the heterogeneous economy may generate less\naggressive responses of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks than in the baseline New\nKeynesian (NK) economy. A sufficient condition for the latter is that output is rather interest\nsensitive, that is the transmission of the monetary impulse to output is rather strong. In fact, the\npresence of sectorial heterogeneity in nominal rigidities makes aggregate activity less interest-\nsensitive than in the baseline fully sticky price economy. This effect is more pronounced the\nstronger the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to output. Moreover, inflation sensitivity\nto output is \"small\" when output is strongly interest-sensitive. These two features reduce the\nwillingness of monetary policy-makers to engage in macroeconomic stabilization increasing their\nwillingness to preserve interest rate stability. However, if the sufficient condition above is not\nsatisfied, other structural features of the economy shape the aggressiveness of monetary policy.\nFinally, the assumption of forward-looking policy is relaxed and it is shown that the\nunconstrained optimal and time consistent policy rule of the central bank features history-\ndependence. Conditional to this policy, the equilibrium path for inflation, output gap and the\ninterest rate can no longer be analytically derived. Numerical outcomes show that, conditional to the\nfully optimal policy and to a wide range of parameters, the reaction of the interest rate to supply and\ndemand shocks is less aggressive in the heterogeneous economy compared with the fully sticky\neconomy.\nHence, a central bank in an economy featuring heterogeneity in the mechanisms of price\nadjustments is more likely to behave less aggressively than in a fully sticky economy.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nSektorale Heterogenit\u00e4t bei der Preissetzung ist eine gut belegte Tatsache. So sind etwa\nBils und Klenow (2004) und Dhyne et al. (2004) der Frage nach der H\u00e4ufigkeit von\nPreisanpassungen f\u00fcr VPI-Daten in verschiedenen Sektoren der Vereinigten Staaten und des\nEuro-W\u00e4hrungsgebiets nachgegangen. Jeden Monat werden durchschnittlich rund 15 % der\nPreise im Eurogebiet und 25 % der Preise in den Vereinigten Staaten angepasst. Am\naussagekr\u00e4ftigsten dabei sind jedoch die Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen Sektoren. So\nwerden die Preise f\u00fcr Energie und unverarbeitete Nahrungsmittel im Eurogebiet und den\nVereinigten Staaten am h\u00e4ufigsten angepasst, w\u00e4hrend sich die Preise f\u00fcr Dienstleistungen als\nam rigidesten erweisen.\nEine andere recht bekannte Tatsache ist die erstaunliche ,,Vorsicht\", die Zentralbanken,\nund insbesondere die Federal Reserve, bei der Durchf\u00fchrung der Geldpolitik augenscheinlich an\nden Tag legen. So sch\u00e4tzen Rudebusch und Svensson (1999) beispielsweise ein kleines Modell\nder US-Wirtschaft und zeigen unter Annahme einer allgemein akzeptierten Verlustfunktion f\u00fcr\ndie Zentralbank auf, dass die optimale Taylor-Regel in ihrem Szenario viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere\nKoeffizienten der Inflation und der Produktionsl\u00fccke als die eigentliche (gesch\u00e4tzte) Taylor-\nRegel der Federal Reserve hat. Sack (2000) liefert in einer \u00e4hnlichen Analyse weitere Belege\ndaf\u00fcr, dass die Reaktion der federal funds rate auf f\u00fcnf identifizierte konjunkturelle Schocks\nst\u00e4rker als tats\u00e4chlich beobachtet ausfallen sollte.\nIm vorliegenden Papier wird argumentiert, dass zwischen den beiden oben genannten\nstilisierten Fakten ein Zusammenhang bestehen k\u00f6nnte. In der Tat weist sowohl die\nwissenschaftliche Literatur als auch die reale Geldpolitik den Indikatoren f\u00fcr die Kerninflation\neine wichtige Rolle zu. Diese Indikatoren filtern Hochfrequenzschwankungen aus den Preisen\nheraus, um zu einem besseren Verst\u00e4ndnis des mittelfristigen Preisdrucks auf die Wirtschaft zu\ngelangen (ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Methoden findet sich in Cristadoro et al., 2005). So werden\neinfache Kerninflationsraten ermittelt, indem man die volatilsten Komponenten (normalerweise\nsind dies die Preise f\u00fcr unverarbeitete Nahrungsmittel und Energie) aus dem Gesamtpreisindex\nausschlie\u00dft. Inwieweit wirkt sich diese Praxis der Zentralbanken auf ihr eigenes Verhalten aus?\nVerhalten sie sich durch Zugrundelegung der Kerninflation aggressiver oder weniger aggressiv,\nals wenn sie die Gesamtinflation als Messgr\u00f6\u00dfe zur Beurteilung des Inflationsdrucks\nverwenden?\nAoki (2001) untersucht eine Volkswirtschaft, die durch ein Kontinuum rigider\nG\u00fcterpreise (,,sticky prices\") und einem Gut mit flexiblen Preisen gekennzeichnet ist, und zeigt,\ndass eine optimierende Zentralbank in dieser Volkswirtschaft die Entwicklung im Sektor der\nrigiden Preise vollkommen stabilisieren sollte statt die Gesamtinflation. Eine tr\u00e4ge Anpassung\ndes G\u00fcterpreisniveaus (,,Sticky-price-Inflation\") - als Reaktion auf gegl\u00e4ttete Erwartungen in\nBezug auf die Produktionsl\u00fccken und relativen Preis\u00e4nderungen - wird insoweit als\nKerninflation definiert, als dass sie eine dauerhafte, rigide Komponente der Inflation\nwiderspiegelt. Sowohl die Form der nominalen Rigidit\u00e4ten gem\u00e4\u00df Aoki (2001) als auch die\nDefinition der Kerninflation werden in diesem Papier beibehalten.\nAnders als Aoki (2001) unterstellt dieses Papier jedoch die Existenz von nicht zu\nvernachl\u00e4ssigenden Transaktionsfriktionen. Dies schafft einen Zielkonflikt zwischen\nmakro\u00f6konomischer Stabilisierung (d. h. Stabilisierung von Inflation und Produktionsl\u00fccke)\nund Zinsstabilisierung - was empirisch recht plausibel ist. Aufgrund dieser Annahme stellt die\nvollkommene Stabilisierung der Kerninflation nicht mehr das einzige angestrebte Ziel der\noptimierenden Zentralbank dar. Dann werden die Gleichgewichtsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Inflation, die\ngesamtwirtschaftliche Aktivit\u00e4t und den Zinssatz nach der von der Zentralbank angewandten\ngeldpolitischen Regel auf Basis von zwei Annahmen abgeleitet.\nZun\u00e4chst wird angenommen, dass die Zentralbank lediglich einen Optimal Noninertial\nPlan wie in Woodford (1999) umsetzen kann: Das geldpolitische Instrument ist den Annahmen\nzufolge ausschlie\u00dflich eine lineare Funktion der gegenw\u00e4rtigen und zuk\u00fcnftigen Werte der\ngeldpolitisch relevanten Variablen. Im Rahmen des Optimal Noninertial Plan l\u00e4sst sich die\nWirtschaftsdynamik analytisch ableiten, um die Bestimmungsfaktoren der Aggressivit\u00e4t der\nZinsreaktion auf Schocks zu ermitteln. Vergleicht man die Resultate in der von heterogener\nPreissetzung gepr\u00e4gten Wirtschaft (heterogene Wirtschaft) mit den Resultaten in einer\nWirtschaft mit hundertprozentiger Preisrigidit\u00e4t (nachfolgend bezeichnet als Baseline New\nKeynesian Economy, wie in Woodford 1999 beschrieben), so stellt sich heraus, dass der\nOptimal Noninertial Plan in der heterogenen Wirtschaft weniger aggressive Reaktionen des\nZinssatzes auf Angebots- und Nachfrageschocks zur Folge hat als in der Baseline New\nKeynesian (NK) Economy. Als hinreichende Vorraussetzung f\u00fcr Letzteres gilt, dass die\nProduktionsleistung recht zinsempfindlich ist, d. h., die Transmission des monet\u00e4ren Impulses\nauf die Produktion ist ziemlich stark. In der Tat bewirkt eine sektorale Heterogenit\u00e4t bei\nnominalen Rigidit\u00e4ten, dass die gesamtwirtschaftliche Aktivit\u00e4t weniger zinssensitiv reagiert als\nes in der Baseline Economy mit vollkommen rigiden Preisen der Fall w\u00e4re. Je st\u00e4rker der\nTransmissionsmechanismus der Geldpolitik auf die Produktion, umso ausgepr\u00e4gter ist dieser\nEffekt. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist die Reagibilit\u00e4t der Inflation auf die Produktion ,,gering\", wenn die\nProduktion sehr zinssensitiv ist. Diese zwei Besonderheiten reduzieren die Bereitschaft der\nGeldpolitik, sich eingehend mit makro\u00f6konomischer Stabilisierung zu besch\u00e4ftigen, und\nerh\u00f6hen ihre Bereitschaft, Zinsstabilit\u00e4t zu wahren. Ist jedoch die oben erw\u00e4hnte hinreichende\nVoraussetzung nicht erf\u00fcllt, so sind es andere strukturelle Merkmale der Wirtschaft, die die\nAggressivit\u00e4t der Geldpolitik bestimmen.\nSchlie\u00dflich wird die Annahme der vorausschauenden Geldpolitik abgeschw\u00e4cht und\ngezeigt, dass die uneingeschr\u00e4nkte, optimale und zeitkonsistente geldpolitische Regel der\nZentralbank vergangenheitsbezogen ist. Dadurch bedingt kann der Gleichgewichtspfad f\u00fcr\nInflation, Produktionsl\u00fccke und Zinssatz nicht mehr analytisch abgeleitet werden. Numerische\nErgebnisse zeigen, dass bei einer vollkommen optimalen Geldpolitik und einer breiten Palette\nan Parametern die Reaktion des Zinssatzes auf Angebots- und Nachfrageschocks in der\nheterogenen Wirtschaft nicht so aggressiv ausf\u00e4llt wie in einer vollkommen rigiden Wirtschaft.\nFolglich verh\u00e4lt sich eine Zentralbank in einer Wirtschaft, deren\nPreisanpassungsmechanismen sich durch Heterogenit\u00e4t auszeichnen, aller Wahrscheinlichkeit\nnach weniger aggressiv als in einer vollkommen rigiden Wirtschaft.\n1 Introduction\nSectorial heterogeneity in price setting is a well established fact. Among others, Bils\nand Klenow (2004) and Dhyne et al. (2004) investigate the issue of the frequency of\nprice adjustments for CPI data in several sectors of the United States and the euro\narea. While, on average, about 15% of prices in the euro area and 25% in the United\nStates are adjusted each month, dispersion across sectors is most relevant. In the euro\narea and the United States, energy and unprocessed food prices display the highest\nfrequency of price adjustment, while service prices are the stickiest.\nAnother fairly well established fact is the puzzling \"caution\" that central banks, and\nthe Federal Reserve in particular, seem to adopt in the conduct of monetary policy.\nRudebusch and Svennsson (1999), for example, estimate a small-scale model of the\nUnited States economy and, assuming a commonly accepted loss function for the central\nbank, show that the optimal Taylor rule in their setting has much larger coefficients\non inflation and the output gap than the actual (estimated) Taylor rule of the Federal\nReserve. Sack (2000) provides more evidence by performing a similar exercise and\nshowing that the response of the federal funds rate to five identified economic shocks\nshould be stronger than what is actually observed.\nThis paper argues that the two stylized facts above may be linked. In fact, both\nthe economic literature and the practice of policy-making assign a relevant role to core\ninflation indices. These indices filter out high frequency fluctuations from prices in order\nto improve the understanding of medium-term inflationary pressures on the economy\n(for a survey of methods see Cristadoro et al., 2005). In particular, simple core inflation\nindices are derived by eliminating the most volatile components (usually, unprocessed\nfood and energy prices) from the aggregate price index. How does this practice of\ncentral banks affect their behavior? In particular, do central banks behave more or less\naggressively by using core inflation rather than overall inflation as a measure to assess\ninflationary pressures?\nAoki (2001) studies an economy featuring a continuum of sticky price goods and\none flexible price good and shows that, in this economy, an optimizing central bank\nshould fully stabilize inflation in the sticky price sector rather than overall inflation.\nSticky price inflation, responding to smoothed expectations of output gaps and relative\nprice changes, is defined as core inflation to the extent that it captures a persistent\ncomponent of inflation. Both the form of nominal rigidities in Aoki (2001) and the\ndefinition of core inflation are maintained in this paper.\nHowever, in contrast to Aoki (2001), this paper assumes the existence of non-\nnegligible transaction frictions. This creates a trade-off between macroeconomic stabi-\nlization (that is, stabilization of inflation and the output gap) and interest rate stabi-\nlization, a feature that is rather plausible empirically. As a result of this assumption,\nfull stabilization of core inflation is no longer the only desired target of the optimizing\ncentral bank. Then, the equilibrium solution for inflation, aggregate activity and the\ninterest rate conditional to the policy rule followed by the central bank are derived,\nbased on two assumptions.\nFirst, it is assumed that the central bank can only implement an optimal non-\ninertial plan as in Woodford (1999): the policy instrument is assumed to be a linear\nfunction of only present and future values of policy relevant variables. Conditional to\nthe optimal non-inertial plan, the dynamics of the economy can be derived analytically\nin order to identify the drivers of the aggressiveness in the reaction of the interest rate\nto shocks. Comparing the outcomes in the economy with heterogeneous price setters\n(heterogeneous economy) with those in an economy with 100% of sticky price goods\n(hereafter, baseline New Keynesian economy, described in Woodford, 1999), it turns\nout that the optimal non-inertial plan in the heterogeneous economy may generate\nless aggressive responses of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks than in the\nbaseline New Keynesian (NK) economy. A sufficient condition for the latter is that\noutput is rather interest sensitive, that is the transmission of the monetary impulse\nto output is rather strong. In fact, the presence of sectorial heterogeneity in nominal\nrigidities makes aggregate activity less interest-sensitive than in the baseline fully sticky\nprice economy. This effect is more pronounced the stronger the transmission mechanism\nof monetary policy to output. Moreover, inflation sensitivity to output is \"small\"\nwhen output is strongly interest-sensitive. These two features reduce the willingness\nof monetary policy-makers to engage in macroeconomic stabilization increasing their\nwillingness to preserve interest rate stability. However, if the sufficient condition above\nis not satisfied, other structural features of the economy shape the aggressiveness of\nmonetary policy.\nFinally, the assumption of forward-looking policy is relaxed and it is shown that\nthe unconstrained optimal and time consistent policy rule of the central bank features\nhistory-dependence. Conditional to this policy, the equilibrium path for inflation, out-\nput gap and the interest rate can no longer be analytically derived. Numerical outcomes\nshow that, conditional to the fully optimal policy and to a wide range of parameters,\nthe reaction of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks is less aggressive in the\nheterogeneous economy compared with the fully sticky economy.\nHence, a central bank in an economy featuring heterogeneity in the mechanisms\nof price adjustments is more likely to behave less aggressively than in a fully sticky\neconomy.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: section 2 presents the model economy and\nits loglinear approximation; section 3 describes the optimal monetary policy problem;\nsection 4 solves the optimal monetary problems and provides an interpretation for the\nresults; section 5 concludes.\n2 The Model\nHeterogeneity in the degree of nominal rigidities across sectors is a relevant empirical\nfeature in the United States and the euro area. Consequently, a model that describes the\noptimal behavior of the monetary policy-maker should take this feature into account.\nTo this end, this paper follows Aoki (2001) by adopting a framework in which there is\na good that has a flexible price2 and a continuum of differentiated goods whose price\n2Benigno (2003) and Woodford (2003) specify two sectors (or countries) models with different degrees\nof price stickiness and imperfect competition. However, the simplified framework of Aoki (2001) is\nadopted here in order to account for the extremely skewed distribution of frequency of adjustment in\nis sticky3.\nThe economy is populated by a continuum (0 - 1) of infinitely lived households.\nEach household can work at the production of only one single good. A fraction of size\n of these households supply their labor for the production of a continuum 0 -  of\ndifferentiated sticky price goods. The remaining households (of measure 1 - ) supply\ntheir services for the production of a flexible price good. Households receive utility\ndirectly from holding real balances. The expected utility function of household i is\n\nT U(Ci\nt+T\n, Bt+T ) + K(\nMi\nt+T\nPt+s\n, Dt+T ) - V (hi\nj,t+T\nwhere  is the constant subjective discount factor, Ci\nt\ntotal consumption expenditure of\nhousehold i, Mi\nt\nnominal balances, Pt the aggregate price index and hi\nj,t\nhours worked\ninto the production of the good i (i = 0 - ; f) in sector j (j = s, f). Bt, Dt and Ej,t\nare preference shocks with Bt and Dt common to all the agents while Ej,t is allowed to\nvary across the two sectors. The utility function is concave and additive separable in\nits arguments and there is a positive level of real balances at which agents are satiated.\nCi\nt\nis a CES aggregator\nCi\nt\n=\nCi\nst\nft\nwhere Ci\nst\nand Ci\nft\nare, respectively, aggregate household i consumption expenditure in\nsticky price and flexible price goods.

As in Woodford (2003), the flow budget constraint of household i\nis given by\nit\n- im\nt\nMi\nt\n+ EtQt,t+1Wi\n Wi\nt\n- Tt\n- PtCi\nt\n+ wi\nj,t\nhi\nt\n+\nwhere Wi\nrepresents the amount of financial wealth carried over to the next period\nby household i, wi\nj,t\nis the wage earned by household i for the production of good i in\nsector j, t(z) is the amount of profits stemming from the sale of good z accruing to\nhousehold i, it is the risk-free interest rate, im\nt\nis the interest rate earned on nominal\ngoods and services prices.\n3Here, flexible and sticky sectors are defined as the set of firms producing the flexible price goods\nand the sticky price goods, respectively\nbalances4 and Qt,t+1 is the unique stochastic discount factor or asset-pricing kernel in\nthis economy. Since it is the risk - free interest rate, it must hold that\nThe aggregate price index is given by\nPt = P\nst\nft\nwhere Pft is the price of the unique flexible price good, while Pst is the index that\naggregates all the price ps,t(i) of the sticky price goods and is defined as\nPst =\n\n\n\n\nps,t(i)1-di\n\n\nHousehold i chooses its optimal contingent plan for consumption expenditure, financial\nwealth, hours worked and real balances taking good prices, financial prices and wages\nas given. The consumption-saving trade-off is regulated by the Euler Equation\n= Et\nUc(Ct, Bt)\nPt\nwhich links the expected evolution of the consumption path to the expected real interest\nrate. Higher expected real interest rates induce households to save more and then to a\nsteeper positively sloped or a flatter negatively sloped consumption path. Notice that\nconsumption expenditure is not indexed in (2.8) since, in equilibrium, consumers share\nrisk perfectly. Money demand is the same for all agents: it is positively affected by the\nlevel of transactions and negatively affected by the opportunity cost of holding wealth\nin the form of money, the risk-free interest rate. In fact,\nKm(mt, Dt)\nUc(Ct, Bt)\n=\nit\nOverall consumption expenditure is split across sticky and flexible price goods according\nto the following relationships\nCst = (\nPst\nPt\nand\nCft = (1 - )(\nPft\nPt\nthat is, aggregate consumption of the goods in the two sectors depends negatively on the\nrelative prices of the sectorial consumption aggregates with respect to the aggregate\nt\n= 0 which turns out to represent the institutional arrangements of actual central banks,\nlike the Federal Reserve.\nconsumption price index.

Firms set prices optimally by taking the demand\nfor their goods as given. For each good i, the following market clearing conditions hold\nys,t(i) = cs,t(i)\nand\nyf,t = cf,t\nthat, on aggregate, imply\nYst = Cst, Yft = Cft, Yt = Ct\nMoreover, the production function of each of the firms takes the simple linear form\nwhere there is only a production input, labor, whose marginal productivity is affected by\na stochastically evolving and possibly sector-specific technological factor. Consequently,\ntotal variable costs for producer i in sector j are represented by\nV Ci\nj,t\n= wi\nj,t\nhi\nj,t\n= wi\nj,t\nyj,t(i)\nAj,t\nwhich implies the following marginal costs\nj,t\n=\nwi\nj,t\nAj,t\nSince firms in the flexible price sector act in a regime of perfect competition, their\noptimal price equals marginal costs\nPf,t =\nwf,t\nAf,t\nwhich, in general equilibrium, becomes\nPf,t = Pt\nVhf\n(hf,t, Ef,t)\nUc(Ct, Bt)\nAf,t\nThe sticky price sector, on the other hand, features both real and nominal rigidities.\nGoods are differentiated and firms act in a regime of monopolistic competition.

Finally, as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), the\nproduction in the sticky price sector is subsidized at a rate  such that the effects of\nmarkup pricing in monopolistic competition are completely offset.

However, the sensitivity of the\npath to the riskless interest rate (and consequently to monetary policy) is affected by\nthe (steady state) value of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1\n\n= - UC\n. The\nmore agents are willing to substitute intertemporally (that is, the bigger the elasticity\nof intertemporal substitution), the more aggregate demand is sensitive to the interest\nrate and hence to monetary policy. The equations (2.11) and (2.12), relating to the in-\ndividual demand for goods, can be aggregated and loglinearized providing the sectorial\ndemand curves\nyst = yt\n7The symbol  indicates first differencing\n8Throughout this paper, all the stochastic processes of the shocks are assumed to be stationary and\nnormalized to 1 in steady state. Consequently, bt\n= - UCB\nBt\n.\nyft = yt\nwhich are downward sloping in the corresponding prices relative to the overall index.\nImportantly, sectorial outputs may be affected by the other sector dynamics through\ntheir dependence on aggregate output and the linkages in relative prices xft and xst,\nhighlighted in equation (2.21). The first order condition for real balances (2.9) gives\nmt = yyt\nwhere y and i are two positive coefficients, while t is a composite shock that involves\nboth Bt and Dt\n9. This equation is a stochastic version of the traditional LM equation\nwhere money demand depends positively on the level of transactions and negatively\non the opportunity cost of holding wealth in a monetary form.

It is worth\nnoticing that, if the labor supply shock and the technology shock are common to the\nwhole economy, natural output in the sticky price sector and in the flexible price sector\nare the same. Aggregate output gap gt is defined as\ngt =  (yt\n- yn\nst\n) + (1 - ) yt\n- yn\nft\nwhich, in the case of common technology and labor supply shocks, simplifies to11\ngt = yt\n- yn\nst\n= yt\n- yn\nft\nCore inflation depends only on the prices of the firms in the sticky price sector that\ncan reset the price. In fact, by loglinearizing equation (2.17), one obtains\nst =\n\np\nst\nwhere in p\nst\n, the index i is dropped since each firm sets it at the same value, in\nequilibrium. The optimal pricing equation in the sticky price sector (2.19) may be\nloglinearized along the lines of Aoki (2001) and Woodford (2003) to derive a stochastic\ndifference equation in p\nst\n. Putting this equation together with equation (2.29) and\nmanipulating slightly, one finds\n9In particular, y\n= \nm\nwhere  has previously been defined and m = -KMM\nKM\nM and i\n=\nUC\nKM\n, while t\nm\nKMD\nKM\nDt\nUC\nBt\n.\n10Defined as output in the fully flexible price economy.\n11In other words, when all the shocks in the economy are aggregate, aggregate output gap is equal\nto the sectorial output gaps gst\n= yt\n- yn\nst\nand gft\n= yt\n- yn\nft\nst = Etst+1 +\nCore inflation is forward-looking because firms forecast the future evolution of their\nmarginal costs when they are allowed to reset the price, as they might not be able to\nadjust it in the future.

Moreover, it is also assumed that the government\nsubsidizes production in the sticky price sector in order to eliminate the effects of monopolistic pricing,\nas in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997). On the consequences of different assumptions (small or delib-\nerately large monopolistic distortions and distortionary taxation), see Woodford (2003) and Benigno\ng =\nrepresent, respectively, the weights of interest rate and output gap stabilization relative\nto core inflation stabilization14 and i = ln 1\nwith iss equal to the steady state value\nof the nominal interest rate. As in Aoki (2001), the central bank in this economy must\nstabilize core inflation (st) and aggregate output gap (gt). Output gap appears in\nthe loss function because the level of aggregate output in the economy is inefficient,\ndue to nominal rigidities rather than imperfect competition, whose effect on output is\neliminated by a government subsidy. However, eliminating the output gap is not enough\nto lead the economy to an efficient allocation of resources. In fact, price staggering\nimplies an inefficient dispersion of prices. Such a distortion is eliminated by setting\ninflation to zero, which explains why inflation in the sticky price sector (core inflation)\nappears as an argument in the loss function. The relative price of the flexible good\nwith respect to the aggregate is set at a sub-optimal level from a social welfare point\nof view only because of the linkages between the two sectors highlighted in (2.21).\nConsequently, eliminating distortions in the sticky price sector is enough to restore the\nefficient allocation in the flexible price sector and in the aggregate, as well. This is why\nno variables relative to the flexible price sector appear explicitly in the loss function.\nOutput gap and core inflation stabilization will be jointly referred to as \"macroeconomic\nstabilization\" from now on.\nOn the other hand, the central bank in this model should also dampen fluctuations\nin its operating target, the risk-free interest rate, differently from Aoki (2001). In\nfact, money provides services to the agents and is included in their utility functions.\nConsequently, the central bank should give the agents as much money as needed to\nsatiate them, driving the nominal interest rate to the return earned by money15. Hence,\nevery variation of the interest rate from the return to money16 is penalized in the loss\nfunction of the central bank. Hereafter, this objective will be defined as \"operating\ntarget stabilization\".\nOperating target stabilization generally runs counter to macroeconomic stabiliza-\ntion. In fact, in (2.32), macroeconomic stabilization implies that the real interest rate\nequals the natural interest rate rn\nt\n, while operating target stabilization requires the\nnominal interest rate to be constantly equal to zero. The consequences of this trade-off\nwill be explored at length in the next section.\nThe structure of the economy acts as a constraint in the problem of the central\nbank. Usually, one must consider the equations defining the dynamics of aggregate\nactivity (2.32) and inflation in the sticky price goods (2.30). On the other hand, notice\nt = st +\n\nxft\n14The weights depend on the deep parameters coming from the microfoundations of the model. The\nonly parameter that has not been defined before is v, which represents steady state \"money velocity\".\n15This fact is commonly defined as the Friedman Rule.\n16Assumed to be zero in this paper.\nimplying that in order to solve for inflation and aggregate activity, the evolution of the\nrelative price in the flexible price sector is to be taken into account. To this end, by\nxft = c(yt\n- yn\nft\nwhere\nc =\n + \nBy replacing aggregate inflation in (2.32) with (2.22), the system of equations de-\nfined by (2.30) and (2.32) includes the three variables st, gt and xft, as well as the\nmonetary policy instrument it. Furthermore, (3.37) provides an expression for xft that\ndepends only on the sectorial output gap in the flexible price sector. Assuming that\nall the shocks in the economy are common, sectorial output gaps become equal to\naggregate output gap. This implies\nthat can be used to eliminate xft giving\ngt = Et(gt+1) -\nS\n(it\n- Etst+1 - rn\nt\nwhere\nS =  +\n\nIn other words, the central bank is only subject to the two constraints (2.30) and\n(3.39) in its minimization problem. Notice that this problem is isomorphic to the one\ninflation is replaced by core inflation and the parameters are different17. As the size of\nthe sticky price sector () approaches 1, core inflation approaches overall inflation and\nthe problem here converges to the one in the baseline New Keynesian model. Then,\nthe outocmes for the heterogeneous ( < 1) economy of this paper are easily compared\nto those of the baseline model retrieved by setting  = 1.\nAssuming, instead, that the technological and/or labor supply shocks are sector\nspecific, xft depends on the relative sectorial output gap rather than the aggregate\noutput gap. At any rate, a structural constraint in the same form as (3.39) can be\neasily derived for this case as well. In fact, by defining\nxn\nft\n= c(yn\nt\n- yn\nft\narbitrary weights on the different objectives. Instead, here the weights come from the microfoundations\nof the model. This makes it possible to measure the impact of a different  (smaller than 1 as in the\ncurrent model, rather than equal to 1 as in the baseline New Keynesian) on the relative importance of\nthe macroeconomic and operating target stabilization.\nas the natural relative flexible price18, it can be shown that\ngt = Et(gt+1) -\nS\n(it\nwhere, again\nS =  +\n\nc > \nand\nut = rn\nt\nHence, assuming sectorial technology and labor supply shocks, the optimal problem of\nthe central bank remains virtually the same. The only difference in (3.42) with respect\nto (3.39) is in the interpretation of the composite shock. For this reason, this paper\nonly deals with the case of common shocks.\nSumming up, in the economy outlined in the previous section, the central bank aims\nto minimize a loss function that embeds quadratic terms in core inflation, aggregate\noutput gap and the interest rate. Both in the case of common and sectorial technology\nand labor supply shocks, the central bank is subject to two structural constraints (2.30\nand 3.39 or 3.42) on the evolution of aggregate output and sticky price inflation. What\nchanges on the basis of the assumption on the shocks, is the stochastic process (and\ninterpretation) of the composite shocks appearing in the equations that define the\nevolution of aggregate activity (3.39 and 3.42). Finally, the results obtained in this\npaper are easily compared to those in the baseline model solved by Woodford (1999)\nand Giannoni (2002) retrieved by setting  = 1 in the results for the model with\nheterogeneity.\n4 Optimal monetary policy\nThis section derives the optimal monetary policy followed by the central bank in het-\nerogeneous and baseline economies and studies the consequences (in terms of reaction\nof the interest rate to shocks) of their implementation.\nIn particular, in the first sub-section the central bank is assumed to follow the\noptimal policy from a timeless perspective in the class of the forward-looking policies\n(optimal non-inertial plan). While this policy is sub-optimal because of the constraints\nimposed by the forward-looking assumption, it permits to solve analytically for the\npath of the interest rate contingent to shocks and provides intuition on the mecha-\nnisms explaining the different reactions of a central bank in heterogeneous and baseline\neconomies.\nThe second sub-section, on the other hand, derives the monetary policy that is fully\noptimal. This policy is not in the class of forward-looking policies since it features.\n18This is the (logarithmic) relative price in the flexible sector that would prevail were the whole\neconomy to feature flexible prices. This variable is different from zero only if, as in this case, the two\nsectors can be affected by different shocks.\nHowever, results from the forward-looking case can be used in order to interpret the\ndynamics of baseline and heterogeneous economies under such a policy.\n4.1 The optimal non-inertial plan\nIn this sub-section, it is assumed that the central bank implements a purely forward-\nlooking policy: it sets its policy rate at each date depending only on the set of develop-\nments for the target variables that are possible from that period onwards. In particular,\nit follows a simple rule of the form19\nit = iss + (st\nAmong the forward-looking plans, the central bank is assumed to follow the optimal\nnon-inertial plan20, that is the forward-looking policy minimizing the unconditional\nexpectation of the loss function L over the stationary distribution of the possible initial\nexogenous states rn\n. This implies that the optimal plan does not depend on the state\nof the economy at the time when the commitment is made, so that the central bank\nimply determinacy of the rational expectation equilibrium. As a consequence of the\ndeterminacy and the AR(1) assumption for the shocks, the path followed by the interest\nrate, output gap and core inflation under the optimal non-inertial plan is\nit = iss + firn\nt\n, gt = gss + fgrn\nt\n, st = ss + frn\nt\nwhere iss, gss and ss are the steady state values for the nominal interest rate, the out-\nput gap and core inflation under the optimal policy defined in (4.45). Replacing (4.45)\nproblem of the entral Bank becomes\nmin\nfi,fg,f,iss,gss,ss\n\ni\ng\n)V ar(rn\nt\nsubject to\nf(1 - ) = kfg\nfg(1 - ) =\nS\n(1 + f - fi)\nand\nss(1 - ) = kgss\n19As for the specific form of the rule, notice that a slightly more complicated rule that also includes\nthe output gap would not improve on this simple one. In fact, since the relevant stochastic term for\nthe problem of the central bank is only the exogenous natural interest rate rn\nt\nor the composite shock\nut\n, a single variable rule is able to implement the non-inertial plan.\niss = ss\nThis optimization problem may be split into two independent parts. On the one hand,\nthe steady state component (choosing iss, gss, ss) and, on the other hand, the choice\nof fi, fg and f for stabilization purposes. The focus of this paper is exclusively on\nthe impulse response function of the interest rate to shocks, so we only deal with the\nsolutions for fi, fg and f\n21. The first order conditions for the stabilization problem\nare\nf\n- \nS\nifi + \nS\nwhere  and  are the lagrangian multipliers associated with the structural constraints.\nTogether with the constraints, the first order conditions define a system of five linear\nequations whose solution22 is\nfi =\nf =\nki(S(1 - )(1 - ) - k)\nfg =\nThe coefficient  that implements the desired equilibrium is easily derived since from\nfi = f\nwhich implies\n =\nki(S(1 - )(1 - ) - k)\nThe analysis is restricted to positive values of  and  has to be bigger than one to\nensure determinacy. This implies\nki\ncontext.\n22From the solution for st,\ngt\nand it\n, one can derive the solution for all the other variables in the\neconomy.\nki\nis positive, implying that the set of parameters identified in (4.52) is non-\nempty.\nThe impulse response function of the interest rate to a natural rate shock is char-\nacterized by the coefficient fi, as in Giannoni (2002). It must also be noted that fi is\nalways positive and can take values between 0 and 1. In the policy problem defined in\nAoki (2001), fi is equal to 1, due to the lack of stabilization trade-offs for the central\nbank. Hence, fi is independent of the size of the flexible price sector in that economy.\nHowever, when the central bank faces a trade-off between macroeconomic stabilization\nand operating target stabilization it may not be optimal to set fi to 1. Operating\ntarget stabilization would require fi to be as small as possible, closer to 0 than 1 and\nthe central bank eventually sets fi at the intermediate level reflecting the right balance\namong conflicting objectives. Interestingly, the optimal fi when there is a trade-off\ndoes depend on , the size of the sticky price sector.\nStudying the way in which fi depends on the size of the sticky price sector sheds light\non the question if, under certain circumstances, the optimal non-inertial plan in the\nheterogeneous economy leads to a less aggressive (a smaller fi) reaction of the interest\nrate than in the baseline New Keynesian economy. The difference in the aggressiveness\nof the central bank in the two economies can be analyzed by comparing the fi in (4.50)\nwith f\ni\n, the counterpart to fi in the baseline case  = 1. Notice that the value of \naffects both the structural equations and the weights of the three economic variables\nin the loss function. In fact, besides (3.40), the following relationships hold between\ncoefficients in the heterogeneous and in the baseline models23\nk =\nk\n\ni =\n\ni\n\ng =\n\ng\nThe higher weights to interest and output gap stabilization with respect to inflation\nin the heterogeneous economy arise because in this type of economy, the sticky price\ndistortion affects a smaller fraction of the firms than in the baseline economy. Moreover,\nsticky price inflation is more sensitive to the level of the output gap in the model with\nheterogeneity than in the one without (k > k) and then the output gap weight is\nfurther magnified in the model with heterogeneity even relative to the interest rate\nstabilization objective.\nSetting  = 1, we can derive the optimal reaction of the interest rate to a shock in\nthe baseline case, that is\nf\ni\n=\n\ng\n\ng\ni\n23Coefficients of the baseline model are denoted by a star.\nIn order to facilitate the comparison between fi and f\ni\n, we can use equations from\nfi =\n\ng\n\ng\ni\n\nand consequently\nfi < f\ni\n\n\nThe inequality in (4.58) holds if  is smaller than or equal to 124. In fact, in that\ncase  is smaller than or equal to c and the left hand side of the equality in (4.58) is\nbigger than or equal to the right hand side. However, when  is big enough, fi can\nbe either bigger than, smaller than or equal to f\ni\ndepending on other features of the\neconomy.\nThe result can be interpreted by looking at equation (3.39) and (3.40), which allow\nus to recast the monetary policy problem in the model with heterogeneity in a format\nthat only includes the policy relevant variables (which are those that explicitly appear\nin the loss function of the central bank) and is directly comparable to the traditional\nproblem in the baseline New Keynesian model. These equations imply that the central\nbank in the model with nominal heterogeneity behaves like a central bank in a model\nwith a representative sector but with output less interest-sensitive than in the baseline\ncase (S > ). Then, in the heterogeneous model, the monetary policy-maker has less\nincentive to use monetary policy for macroeconomic stabilization than in the baseline\ncase since she acts as though monetary policy were less effective at dampening the\nfluctuations in aggregate activity and consequently in inflation. This explains why she\nrather engages in more interest rate stabilization and then the smaller reaction of the\ninterest rate to economic shocks. However, when  is big, the result is not so clear\ncut and, depending on the values taken by other structural parameters, both more or\nless aggressive behavior can stem from the optimal plan in the heterogeneous economy\nrelative to the baseline. The ratio\nS\n\n+\n\nmay help to understand why. S is always bigger than  implying that the policymaker in\nthe core model always behaves as if output were less sensitive than in the baseline case,\nbut this ratio decreases with the increase in , stabilizing around 1 + 1-\n. Hence,\nthe difference in the strength of the effects of monetary policy on output tends to\ndecrease when  increases, making output less interest-sensitive. Moreover, an increase\n24Notice that the positivity constraint on \nimplies that [ + (1 - )c] (1 - )(1 - ) - k2 is\npositive. The inequality also holds for some values of  bigger than 1 since the result can be extended\nto those values by continuity. However, deriving the exact upper bound for  is cumbersome and does\nnot add much content to the main message of the paper.\nin  increases k more than k as shown by (4.53) and (2.31). Sticky price inflation\nis still more sensitive to aggregate activity in the core model than in the baseline\nmodel, but this difference is magnified by the increase in . These two factors imply\nthat macroeconomic stabilization becomes more attractive relative to operating target\nstabilization for the central bank in the core model when  increases. Eventually,\nmacroeconomic stabilization may become more important in the heterogeneous model\nthan in the baseline model relative to operating target stabilization, explaining why\nmonetary policy might turn out to be more aggressive in the former than in the latter\neconomy.\n4.2 The unconstrained optimal interest rule\nAlthough it allows useful insights, in general the optimal non-inertial plan represents a\nsub-optimal choice and also one that is not fully supported by the empirical analysis on\nthe behavior of central banks. Indeed, with forward-looking private agents the central\nbank can improve on the non-inertial plan by committing to some form of inertial\nbehavior that could shape expectations towards a stronger stabilization of the welfare\nrelevant variables. Moreover, lagged interest rate terms are shown to be empirically\nrelevant for the analysis of the behavior of central banks.\nThe fully optimal and time consistent interest rule of the central bank solves the\nfollowing problem25:\nminst,gt,it\n\nst\n+ i(it\nt\ns.t.\nst = Etst+1 + kgt\ngt = Et(gt+1) -\nS\n(it\n- Etst+1 - ut)\nSetting up the Lagrangian of this problem, taking the first order conditions and\nreplacing the Lagrange multipliers, it can be shown that the solution of this problem\nfrom period 2 onwards is:\nit = -\nk\nS\ni +\nk + S\nS\n\nk\nSi\nst +\ng\nSi\ngt\nDemanding that this policy is already in place at time 0 and 1 allows the cen-\ntral bank to achieve time consistency (that is, it implements the policy that is optimal\nfrom a timeless perspective). The optimal rule has some notable features already inves-\ntigated by Giannoni and Woodford (2002b) for the baseline New Keynesian economy26:\n26Notice that the optimal rule in the baseline New Keynesian model can be retrieved once again by\nsetting  = 1\n- it is history-dependent in that the optimal interest rates depends on its own two\nlags and on the first lag of the output gap;\n- it resembles a Taylor rule in that the optimal interest rate is a linear function of\ninflation and the output gap.\nNext, in order to derive the dynamics of this economy and, in particular, of the\ninterest rate in response to shocks, the following system of three stochastic difference\nequations has to be solved:\ngt = Et(gt+1) -\nS\n(it\nit = -\nk\nS\ni +\nk + S\nS\n\nk\nSi\nst +\ng\nSi\nIt can be proved27 that, under this policy, the economy can follow only one contin-\ngent path (in other words, the solution is determinate) for any value of the parameters.\nHowever, the solution for this system is to be derived numerically28 due to the presence\nof three more state variables (the lags of the interest rate and output gap) than in the\noptimal non-inertial plan.\nAs in the previous section, the focus here is on the reaction of the nominal interest\nrate to a unitary shock in rn\nt\n, comparing the outcomes in the heterogeneous to those\nin the baseline New Keynesian economy. In order to solve the model, numerical values\nhave to be assigned to the parameters in equations (4.60) to (4.62). The baseline\ncalibration takes the values of the parameters estimated in Rotemberg and Woodford\n(1997), with some exceptions. In particular,  is set to 0.75, a value that is plausible\nempirically and that implies that firms reset their price on average once a year (with\nquarterly data). More importantly, the model in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), does\nnot feature sectoral heterogeneity in the price adjustment mechanisms. Hence, in order\nto calibrate the parameter  (the percentage of firms with a sticky price adjustment),\nwe follow Bils and Klenow (2004) and set it to 0.75. These and the other values of the\nstructural parameters in this economy are reported in Table 1.\nTable 1: Baseline Calibration\nModel          k S i g\n27For a proof in the case of the baseline New Keynesian model, see Giannoni and Woodford (2002b).\nThe case of the heterogeneous economy does not require a separate proof due to the isomorphism of\nthe two minimization problems\n28The numerical solutions are derived by using the AIM algorithm of Anderson and Moore.\nNotice that the values of the first nine parameters (from  to ) are assumed, while\nthe remaining four parameters are non-linear functions of the previous nine. The only\ndifference in the values of the first nine parameters between the heterogeneous and\nbaseline New Keynesian economies lies in the percentage of sticky price firms () which\nis 100% in the baseline economy. Given these values of the parameters, figure 1 plots\nthe reaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous (solid line) and baseline\n(dashed line) economies.\nFigure 1: Reaction of nominal interest to a unitary shock in the natural real interest\nrate\nTime\nHeterogeneous Model\nBaseline NK model\nFigure 1 shows that, given the values of the parameters assumed in the baseline\ncalibration, the reaction of the interest rate in the heterogeneous economy is less ag-\ngressive than in the baseline economy. In other words, the concern for interest rate\nstabilization is more relevant in the heterogeneous economy than in the fully sticky\neconomy.\nHowever, in the previous section, we saw that higher values of  imply that this\nresult can be reversed, with the reaction of the interest rate being less aggressive in\nthe baseline than in the heterogeneous economy. Hence, figure 2 reports results on the\nreaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous and baseline New Keynesian\neconomies under different values of the parameter . In particular, figure 2 reports\niHet\nwhich is the ratio of the reaction of the interest rate in the heterogenous economy\nrelative to the corresponding reaction in the baseline New Keynesian economy at the\ntime when the shock is realized (t=1). A value smaller than 1 in this ratio indicates\nthat, on impact, monetary policy is less aggressive in the heterogeneous than in the\nbaseline economy.\nFigure 2: Ratio impact response interest rate in heterogeneous versus baseline NK\nmodel\nSigma\nFigure 2 shows that the reaction of the interest rate in the model with heterogeneity\nis always less aggressive than in the case where all prices are sticky. This also happens\nfor very high values of , although the ratio is monotonically increasing for values of \nhigher than one. This result partly mirrors those obtained with the non-inertial plan:\nfor high values of sigma, the relative importance of macroeconomic stabilization with\nrespect to interest rate stabilization increases more in the model with heterogeneous\nprice setters than in the baseline New Keynesian model. However, the numerical sim-\nulations show that, conditional to the values assigned to the other parameters of the\nmodels in the calibration, the result of a less aggressive reaction of the interest rate in\nthe heterogeneous economy remains robust for higher values of .\nAppendix 2 reports results for the ratio when several other parameters of the model\nare assumed to vary from the values assigned in the baseline calibration. The outcome\nof these simulations is that the reaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous\neconomy remains robustly less aggressive than in the baseline New Keynesian economy.\nIn conclusion, the result of the attenuation in the reaction of the interest rate to\nshocks in the model with heterogeneous price setters is quite robust. This supports\nthe idea that the puzzling caution in the conduct of monetary policy by actual central\nbanks may be partly explained by the fact that they take into account the sectorial\nheterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper analyzes the optimal monetary policy problem of a central bank facing sec-\ntorial heterogeneity in price setting. The focus is on the reaction of the interest rate to\nstructural shocks. Comparing this reaction in an economy with heterogeneity with one\nin which all goods have sticky prices, it is found that a central bank is much more likely\nto react less aggressively to shocks in the heterogeneous economy. Since actual central\nbanks take into account the sectorial heterogeneity in price setting mechanisms in that\nthey derive and monitor core inflation indices excluding the most volatile components\nof consumer prices, this finding might help to explain why their reaction to shocks is\nconsidered too cautious.\nReferences\nAoki, K.

Exploiting (4.61) and noticing that\nbt = - UCB\nBt and  = -UCC C\nUC\n, we get\nU(Yt, Bt) = Y Uc yt +\nt\nApproximation of K(Mt\nPt\n, Dt\n)\nAssume, ss in Woodford (2003), that the transaction technology implies that there is\nsatiation in real money balances at a finite positive level. Moreover, all the conditions\non the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to consumption and real\nbalances invoked in Woodford (2003), pg 422 are verified. Besides that, assume that\n = I\nis small and can be treated as an expansion parameter. This leads to the\nconclusion that the economy is well approximated in a neighborhood of the steady state\nclose to the point in which agents are satiated in real balances.\nK(Mt/Pt, Dt) = KM mt +\nt\n+ KMDmtdt + t.i.p. + O(3)\nwhich gives\nK(Mt/Pt, Dt) = KM M mt +\nt\n+\nt\n]\nU(Yt, Bt) + K(Mt/Pt, Dt) =\nY UC yt +\nt\n+ btyt +\nMKM\nmt +\nt\n+\nKMD\nKM\nmtdt + t.i.p. + O(3)\nwhere m = -KMM M\nKM\n. Defining Sm = MKM\nm\nKMD\nKM\nDt\nUC\nBt , this\nexpression can be rewritten as\nU(Yt, Bt) + K(Mt/Pt, Dt) =\nY UC yt +\nt\n+ btyt + Smmt +\nt\n+ Smmtmt + Smbtmt + t.i.p. + O(3)\nNow, notice that from (2.9), Sm = O(). Moreover, Smm = -KMM m2\n. Hence\nSmmt+\nt\n+Smmtmt+Smbtmt = Smmt\n-\nt\n+Smmtmt+O(3)\nwhich, after some tedious calculations, gives\nSmmt\n-\nt\n+ Smmtmt + O(3) = Smmt\n-\nSmm (mt\n- t)2 + t.i.p. + O(3)\nIf (steady state) money velocity is defined as v = Y\nM\n, then\nSmm = -\nUCY\n=\nKM\nUC\nKM\nthat can be used together with i = UC\nKM\nto show that\niv = (Smm)-1 + O()\nThis relationship, coupled with equation (A.66) implies that\nU(Yt, Bt) + K(Mt/Pt, Dt) =\nY UC yt +\nt\n+ btyt + Smmt\n-\n(iv)-1 (mt\n- t)2 + t.i.p. + O(3)\nFinally,\nmt = yyt\n- iit + t\nwhere y= \nm\n, and y and i are O(). Hence,\nU(Yt, Bt) + K(Mt/Pt, Dt) =\nY UC yt +\nt\n+ btyt\n- Smiit\n-\nt\n+ t.i.p. + O(3)\nApproximation of -(1 - )V (Hf,t\n, Ef,t\n)\nV (Hf,t, Ef,t) =\nV Yf\nYf yf,t +\nf,t\n+ Yf VYf Af\nyf,taf,t + Yf VYf Ef\nyf,tef,t +\nf\nVYf Yf\nf,t\n+ t.i.p. + O(3)\nNotice that for j = s, f\n= VHj\nA\n= VHj\n= VHjHj\n= VHjHj\n= -(VHjHj\nHj + VHj\nMoreover,\nHj =  and\nwhich are equal in both sectors and\nHs =\nVHf Hf\nHf =\nVHH\nVH\nThen\nV (Hf,t, Ef,t) = VHH yf,t +\nf,t\n- (1 + )yf,taf,t + yf,tef,t + t.i.p. + O(3)\nApproximation of - \nV (Hi\ns,t\n(i), Es,t\n)di\nBefore working out the approximation of this term, notice that\nys,t = Ei (ys,t(i)) +\n\nV ari (ys,t(i)) (A.79)\nwhere Ei and V ari are, respectively, the mean and the variance of ys,t(i) with respect\nto the cross section of sticky price firms. Then,\n-\n\nV (Hi\ns,t\n(i), Es,t)di = - VHHEi (ys,t(i)) +\n+\ni\n- VHHEi (ys,t(i)) As,t + VHHEi (ys,t(i)) es,t + t.i.p. + O(3)\nwhich, by using (A.76) in order to eliminate the expectation term Ei (ys,t(i)), becomes\n-\n\nV (Hi\ns,t\n(i), Es,t)di = -VHH ys,t\n-\n\nV ari (ys,t(i))\n+\n(1 + )Ei (ys,t(i))2 - (1 + )ys,tas,t + ys,tes,t + t.i.p. + O(3)\nExploiting the definition of variance and again (A.76) in order to eliminate negligible\nterms, Ei (ys,t(i))2 can be further simplified to obtain\n-\n\nV (Hi\ns,t\n(i), Es,t)di = -Vhh ys,t\n-\n\nV ari (y(i)s,t)\n+\ns,t\n- (1 + )ys,tas,t + ys,tes,t + t.i.p. + O(3)\nApproximation of flow utility function\nU (Ct, Bt) + K(\nMt\nPt\n, Dt) -\n\nV (Hi\ns,t\n(i), Es,t)di - (1 - )V (Hf,t, Ef,t) =\nY UC yt +\nt\n+ btyt\n- Smiit\n-\nt\n-Vhh ys,t\n-\n\nV ari (y(i)s,t) +\ns,t\n- (1 + )ys,tas,t + ys,tes,t\n- (1 - )VHH yf,t +\nf,t\n- (1 + )yf,taf,t + yf,tef,t\nV ari\n(ys,t\n(i))\nFrom\nYst(i) =\n\nPst(i)\nPst\n-\nYst\none can show that\nV ari (ys,t(i)) = 2V ari (ps,t(i))\nThe term on the right hand side represents the dispersion of prices in the sticky price\nsector due to the staggered price setting mechanism described by Calvo. Intuitively,\nthis term depends on inflation in the sticky price sector, since if inflation in the sticky\nprice sector is zero at each time, no dispersion would be observed among relative prices\nset by sticky price setters. Define\nps,t\n= Ei ln ps,t(i)\nand notice that\nps,t\n= Ei ln ps,t(i) - ps,t-1\n= Ei ln ps,t-1(i) - ps,t-1\n+ (1 - ) p\ns,t\n= (1 - ) p\ns,t\nThe term we are interested in is\nt = V ari lnPs,t(i) - ps,t-1\nNotice that\nt = Ei ln Ps,t-1(i) - ps,t-1\n+ (1 - ) ln P\nt\n- ps,t\nwhich reduces to\n\nps,t\nNow, notice also that\nPs,t =\n\n\n\n\nPs,t(i)1-di\n\n\nimplies\nln Ps,t =\nwhich, in turn, implies that\nps,t = ps,t\nHence,\n\ns,t\nwhich, by backward iteration, gives\n\nt\ns,k\nand, finally,\n\nt =\n\n\ns,t\nFinal Form of the loss function\nNotice that, from the first order conditions\nMoreover,\nyt = ys,t + (1 - )yf,t\nyn\nt\n= yn\ns,t\n+ (1 - )yn\nf,t\nand\ngt = yt\n- yn\nt\nthis implies that the second order approximation of the flow utility function is equal to\n-\nY Uc\nt\n+(1-)(1+) ys,t - yf,t\n- c(ys,t - yf,t\nt\n+(1+)V ari(p(i)s,t) +t.i.p.+O(3)\nt\ncan be further simplified by noting that\nSmv =\nKM\nUC\n=\nI\n= \nand, then,\nt\n= iv-1(it + )2 + t.i.p. = (vi)-1(it\nwhere i=-. Moreover, further tedious algebraic manipulations show that\n[ys,t\n- yf,t\n- c(ys,t\n- yf,t)]2 =\n\nt\nand, then\n\nst\n+ i(it\nt\nwhere\ni =\nand\ng =\ndisregarding scaling parameters, terms independent of policy and O(3) terms.\nAppendix 2: Robustness checks\nThis appendix shows how the ratio of the impact reaction in the interest rates in the\nheterogenous economy relative to the baseline New Keynesian economy varies when the\nvalues of the parameters depart from those in the baseline calibration.\nFigure 3: Ratio impact response interest rate in heterogeneous versus baseline NK\nmodel\nGamma\nObviously, when the percentage of firms with sticky price tends to 100%, the out-\ncomes in the heterogeneous and baseline New Keynesian economy tend to become the\nsame.\nFigure 4: Ratio impact response interest rate in heterogeneous versus baseline NK\nmodel\nOmega\nHigh values of  reduce the differences in the reaction of the interest rate to shocks\nin the heterogeneous economy compared to the baseline. However, the result does not\ndisappear even for extremely high values of this parameter. The interpretation for\nthe convergence of the results in the heterogeneous economy to those for the baseline\neconomy is that, while the sensitivity of inflation to the output gap does not vary\nmuch with , the sensitivity of aggregate activity to the interest rate decreases a lot in\nthe heterogeneous economy (conditional to the value assigned to ) when  increases.\nThen, the central bank engages more and more in macroeconomic stabilization relative\nto the baseline economy.\nFigure 5: Ratio impact response interest rate in heterogeneous versus baseline NK\nmodel\nRho\nThe outcome of this simulation shows that the result of attenuation in the mon-\netary policy reaction in a heterogeneous economy does not depend on the degree of\nautocorrelation  assumed for the stochastic shock in the economy.\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2006:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\novernight rate, the ECB's policy rate and the Dieter Nautz\nterm spread Christian J.
