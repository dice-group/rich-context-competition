Rivara, MD, MPH\nIMPORTANCE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among US adolescents, and\nin-home firearm access is an independent risk factor for suicide. Given recommendations to\nlimit firearm access by those with mental health risk factors for suicide, we hypothesized that\nadolescents with such risk factors would be less likely to report in-home firearm access.\nOBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of self-reported in-home firearm access among US\nadolescents, to quantify the lifetime prevalence of mental illness and suicidality (ie, suicidal\nideation, planning, or attempt) among adolescents living with a firearm in the home, and to\ncompare the prevalence of in-home firearm access between adolescents with and without\nspecific mental health risk factors for suicide.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of data from the National\nComorbidity Survey\u00adAdolescent Supplement, a nationally representative survey of 10 123 US\nadolescents (age range, 13-18 years) who were interviewed between February 2001 and\nEXPOSURES Risk factors for suicide, including a history of any mental health disorder,\nsuicidality, or any combination of the 2.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported access to a firearm in the home.\nRESULTS One in three respondents (2778 [29.1%]) of the weighted survey sample reported\nliving in a home with a firearm and responded to a question about firearm access; 1089\n(40.9%) of those adolescents reported easy access to and the ability to shoot that firearm.\nAmong adolescents with a firearm in home, those with access were significantly more likely\n(28.1% vs 22.6%) (P < .05 for all). Adolescents with firearm access also had a higher lifetime\ncompared with those without firearm access. In multivariable analyses, adolescents with a\nhistory of mental illness without a history of suicidality (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.13; 95% CI,\n0.98-1.29) and adolescents with a history of suicidality with or without a history of mental\nwithout such histories.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents with risk factors for suicide were just as likely to\nreport in-home firearm access as those without such risk factors. Given that firearms are the\nsecond most common means of suicide among adolescents, further attention to developing\nand implementing evidence-based strategies to decrease firearm access in this age group is\nwarranted.\nSupplemental content at\njamapsychiatry.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Author\naffiliations are listed at the end of this\narticle.\nCorresponding Author: Joseph A.\nSimonetti, MD, MPH, Veterans Affairs\nPuget Sound Health Care System,\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n152 (Reprinted) jamapsychiatry.com\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

While the relationship between mental health and\nin-home firearm access has been studied in adults,34 little in-\nformation exists regarding firearm access among adolescents\nwith mental health disorders, arguably the group most at risk\nof self-inflicted firearm injuries. Understanding the preva-\nlence of in-home firearm access among adolescents with and\nwithout mental illness is important for informing public policy\nand designing interventions. Aims of this study were (1) to es-\ntimate the prevalence of self-reported in-home firearm ac-\nof US adolescents, (2) to quantify the lifetime prevalence of\nmental illness and suicidality among adolescents living with\na firearm in the home, and (3) to compare among adolescents\nwith a firearm in the home the prevalence of in-home firearm\naccess between adolescents with and without specific men-\ntal health risk factors for suicide.\nMethods\nData Source\nThe human subjects committees of Harvard Medical School,\nBoston, Massachusetts, and the University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, approved all original National Comorbidity Survey\u00ad\nAdolescent Supplement (NCS-A) procedures. Participants' par-\nents or guardians provided written informed consent, and par-\nticipants provided written assent.

We also abstracted self-reported race/ethnicity because\nfirearm ownership and storage patterns vary by this\ncharacteristic.37 Race/ethnicity classifications initially de-\nfined by the NCS-A were categorized as non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, or other.\nMental Health Disorders\nThe NCS-A assessed participants' mental health histories using\na modified version of the World Health Organization Compos-\nite International Diagnostic Interview.38 The Composite Inter-\nnational Diagnostic Interview was validated among adoles-\ncents, and diagnoses are based on the DSM-IV.39 We used\ndiagnostic hierarchy rules to identify specific lifetime and re-\ncent (preceding 12 months) mental health disorders, includ-\ning mood, anxiety, behavioral, and substance use disorders.40\nWe also quantified the total number of lifetime mental health\ndisorders for each participant (0, 1, 2, or more).\nSuicidality\nThe NCS-A assessed any history of suicidal thoughts and be-\nhaviors using a modified version of the suicidal behavior mod-\nPsychiatric Comorbidity, Suicidality, and Firearms Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

The exposures of interest were a lifetime history\nof any mental health disorder, a lifetime history of suicidality\n(ie, suicidal ideation, planning, or attempt), or any combina-\ntion of the 2. We used Poisson regression with robust SE of the\nvariance to obtain prevalence ratio estimates and correspond-\ning CIs, and we compared the prevalence of in-home firearm\naccess between adolescents without suicide risk factors (ie, no\nlifetime mental health disorders or suicidality) and adoles-\ncentswith(1)alifetimehistoryofamentalhealthdisorderwith-\nout a history of suicidality and (2) a lifetime history of suicid-\nality with or without a history of a mental health disorder. In\neach model, we included the following covariables based on\ntheir a priori relevance: age, sex, race/ethnicity, ratio of fam-\nily income to the federal poverty level, level of urbanicity, and\nUS census region.\nTo determine whether the relationship between suicide\nrisk and firearm access differed by age or sex, we analyzed 2\nseparate multivariable models. These included the following\ninteraction terms: (1) age (continuous variable) and suicide risk\ncategory and (2) sex and suicide risk category.\nTo determine whether the relationship between suicide\nrisk and firearm access was dependent on proximity or sever-\nity of mental illness, we performed 2 subgroup analyses. First,\nwe repeated our main analyses using only 12-month histories\nof mental health disorders and suicidality. Second, we com-\npared the prevalence of in-home firearm access between ado-\nlescentswithnolifetimehistoryofsuicideriskfactorsandado-\nlescents who reported a suicide attempt in the preceding\n12 months.

User on 11/20/2015\n \nOur estimate of firearm prevalence among households\nwith adolescents is consistent with estimates reported\nelsewhere.25,26 In addition, our estimate of adolescent in-\nhome firearm access is similar to estimates based on storage\npractices reported by adult firearm owners in other national\nof adolescent-reported firearm access is from a study29 of 1995\ndata finding that 24.3% of US adolescents reported in-home\nfirearm access, almost double our estimate. Reasons for this\ndiscrepancyareunclear.TheNCS-Amayhaveidentifiedamore\nspecific subset of adolescents by asking about both immedi-\nate access (ie, \"right now\") and the ability to shoot the fire-\narm. Regardless, our study confirms that a large proportion of\nUS adolescents have in-home firearm access.\nThis study makes several important contributions to the\nfirearm access literature. Most studies25,26,28 have focused on\nparentorguardianreportofstoragepracticesasaproxyforado-\nlescent firearm access (eg, storing a firearm unlocked). How-\never, such reports tell us little about whether adolescents can\naccess the firearm and, perhaps more important, whether ado-\nlescents are aware that they can access the firearm. By focus-\ning exclusively on adult storage practices, prior studies25,26,28\nfail to address an important aspect of firearm access: adoles-\ncents may be able to access and shoot a firearm even if that\nfirearm is stored locked, unloaded, and separate from locked\nammunition.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehen-\nsively describe the burden of mental illness among adoles-\ncentswithfirearmaccess.Wefoundthattheprevalenceofmost\nmental health disorders and suicidality was similar between\nadolescents with and without firearm access and, most im-\nportant, was similar to previously reported estimates of these\ndisorders among the general US adolescent population.2,40\nHowever, those with access were more likely to endorse a his-\ntory of alcohol and drug abuse, findings that are particularly\nconcerning given prior research demonstrating greater odds\nof substance abuse and firearm access among suicide\ndecedents.43,44 This is consistent with previous studies find-\ningthat10%ofUSadolescentshaveaccesstobothfirearmsand\nalcohol in the home29 and that parents with substance abuse\nproblems were more likely to report storing a firearm un-\nsafely than parents without such problems.45 Given that alco-\nhol and drug\u00adrelated disorders cluster within families,46 these\nfindings may help explain the increased firearm access among\nadolescents with substance abuse histories.\nBecauseofrecommendationstolimitfirearmaccessamong\nadolescents with suicide risk factors,31,33 we hypothesized that\nsuch adolescents would be less likely to report firearm access\nthan those without suicide risk factors. However, we ob-\nservednodifferenceinfirearmaccessbetweenriskgroupseven\nin subgroup analyses limited to adolescents who had recent\nmental health disorders or those who reported a recent sui-\ncide attempt compared with adolescents who had no lifetime\nrisk factors. This suggests that many parents or guardians of\nadolescents with suicide risk factors and a firearm in the home\nmay not be aware or convinced that (1) their child has access\nto the firearm,47 (2) firearm access is a risk to their child, or (3)\nlimiting firearm access may mitigate the risk of having a fire-\narm in the home. The prevalence estimates of DSM-IV disor-\nders obtained by the NCS-A do not represent formal clinical\ndiagnoses. Therefore, these findings may also represent un-\nrecognized mental health risk factors among US adolescents.\nAlthough the objective of this study was to address fire-\narm access among adolescents at risk of suicide, these find-\nings have several other important implications. First, adoles-\ncents and adults living in homes with firearms, particularly\nloaded or unlocked firearms, are disproportionately at risk of\nother firearm-related injuries, including unintentional shoot-\nings and homicide.22,48 Second, we estimated that almost 1 in\n4 adolescents living in a home with a firearm has a lifetime be-\nhavioral disorder such as intermittent explosive disorder or\nconduct disorder. Several of these illnesses are associated with\nincreased risk of personal injury or violent behavior.49,50 The\nimplications of firearm access among this population are un-\nclear. Third, these analyses are based on data collected from\narm access among adolescents with suicide risk factors un-\nderscores the importance of reassessing this issue among the\npresent US adolescent population.\nThese findings present an area for intervention by policy\nmakers,healthcaresystems,healthcareprofessionals,andpar-\nents. Safe storage practices may reduce the likelihood of fire-\nprofessional organizations,31,33 and are a focus of the Insti-\ntute of Medicine's recommendations for firearm injury\nprevention.52 The limited literature on this subject demon-\nstrates that most parents are unlikely to comply with health\ncare professionals' recommendations to remove firearms from\ncare professional and clinic\u00adbased firearm interventions to im-\nprove firearm storage practices are acceptable to parents, and\na growing body of evidence suggests that brief interventions\ndelivered in clinical settings can decrease adolescent firearm\nrisk behaviors, including alcohol use problems and weapon\ncarrying.57,58 In fact, community and clinic\u00adbased random-\nized interventions have demonstrated efficacy in improving\nsafe storage practices among firearm owners, including par-\nTable 3.

Sec-\nond, we defined adolescents at risk of suicide using any his-\ntory of a mental health disorder or suicidality. Most important,\nsomeadolescentshavecompletedsuicidewithoutidentifiedhis-\ntoriesofmentalillness.7 Third,theseestimatesarebasedonado-\nlescent reporting of firearm access and are subject to misclas-\nsification bias if adolescents incorrectly believe that they do or\ndo not have access to a firearm. Fourth, parent report of ado-\nlescent mental health disorders has been shown to improve di-\nagnostic accuracy in the NCS-A sample, particularly for behav-\nioral diagnoses. Although lack of parent report may have led to\nunderestimates of some disorders, it is unlikely that differen-\ntialmisclassificationbetweenadolescentswithandwithoutfire-\narm access biased these results.\nConclusions\nIn summary, a substantial proportion of US adolescents re-\nported in-home firearm access, and those with suicide risk fac-\ntors were just as likely to report access as adolescents without\nsuch risk factors.
