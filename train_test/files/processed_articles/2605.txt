By 12th grade nearly 50% of teens report being frequently with\nothers drinking to get high, 75% indicate that one or more friends\ndrink until drunk routinely [8], and over 80% drink to have a good\ntime with friends [9]. Because drinking impairs cognitive functioning\nand judgment [10], promotes risky behaviors [11-13], and leads to\naccidents and mortality [14], understanding how friendships shape--\nand are shaped by--drinking is a critical public health issue [8].\nIn service to programmatic efforts to reduce teen drinking,\nresearchers have sought to determine the magnitude of friend influence\n[15] by linking friends' drinking to individual drinking [16]. One\ncentral challenge has been the inherent difficulty in accounting for\nfriend selection, the process by which peers become friends, when\nestimating friend influence [17,18]. Without accounting for selection,\nit is impossible to accurately determine whether one's drinking is\ninfluenced by how much friends drink, or whether one's drinking\nreflects homophily [19]--the extent to which \"birds of a feather flock\ntogether\" [20]. Individuals may seek out others who drink like they\ndo, or select into environments where drinkers socialize together [21],\nrather than adjusting behaviors to be more like those of friends' [22,23].\nLongitudinalsocialnetworkanalysisusingmethods[24]todecompose\nteen alcohol use into separate selection and influence components finds\nroles for both processes [25]. Although there is disagreement about when\nselection and influence each emerge in importance over adolescence,\nboth factors contribute to the correlation between friendship networks\nand alcohol use [26-28]. We extend this novel line of research by jointly\nestimating the contributions of friendships to adolescents' drinking, and\nhow alcohol use contributes to whether new friendships form and existing\nWe use network analysis because self-reports are unreliable and\ninflate influence estimates [30,31]. Social network measures capture\nconnections between each adolescent and other students based upon\nreported friendships, directly capturing the friendship patterns of all\nyouth in the same school [32,33]. Because all adolescents in a school are\nassessed, each reports on his or her own behavior, so friend estimates\nare not subject to the \"same-source bias\" problem that confounds\ninfluence estimates in traditional observational studies [34].\nWe assess how alcohol use contributes to drinking homophily with\nboth individual drinking behavior and friendship selection modeled as\nmutually influencing processes to account for the inherent endogeneity\nof influence and selection [18,23]. We assess the roles of teen popularity\n(receiving friendship nominations), sociability (nominating friends),\nand friend influence (average friend alcohol use) on drinking alcohol,\nwhile controlling for selection [35]. Simultaneously, we assess the role\nof drinking in connecting adolescents to one another via new and\nexisting friendships, and thus in shaping the friendship network as\nindividual and friend drinking changes over time.\n*Corresponding author: Jacob E Cheadle, The University of Nebraska-Lincoln,\nj.e.cheadle@gmail.com\nCitation: Cheadle JE, Walsemann KM, Goosby BJ (2015) Teen Alcohol Use\nand Social Networks: The Contributions of Friend Influence and Friendship\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cheadle JE, et al.

Add Health is a cluster stratified longitudinal study\nparent and child consent and provide de-identified data to other\nresearchers under approved security protocols [36]. All procedures\nfor this study, including data security protocols for working with\nthe restricted de-identified data, were approved by the University of\nNebraska-Lincoln IRB.\nWe use a subset of the 16 schools where friendship data was\ncollected at each observation point. Of these 16 schools, two are mid-\ndata from the two largest schools, because the other smaller schools\nwere either special education or middle schools, or because a network\nsampling error at observation 2 restricted participants to nominating\nonly one female and one male friend rather than up to 5 of each (about\n5% in the schools we use and over 50% in other schools; we include an\nindicator for this subset of students). The resulting sample was 2,296\nadolescents; 1,531 in the large, racially heterogeneous high school,\nwhich is commonly referred to as \"Jefferson High School\", and 765 in\nthe middle-sized predominantly white high school, commonly referred\nto as \"Sunshine High School\" [37]. Sunshine was 7% nonwhite, and\nThe network response rates are acceptable for social network analysis\n[38]. Approximately 65-97% of teens provided information on at least\none friend within the network at each wave, and 86% provided at least\none nomination at 2+ waves. Missing data were handled within the\nestimation procedure with the composition change method developed\nfor longitudinal network models [39], so that all youth were included in\nthe analysis and allowed to enter the study later or leave.The sample was\nlimited to youth with at least two drinking observations, and missing\ndrinking/attribute data is model imputed using standard procedures\nThe close friendship network\nThe close friendship network matrix captures the system and\nstructure of relationships among adolescents at each observation point\nand so plays two roles in our models: it is both a primary endogenous\nvariable for modeling selection, and it captures the relationships\nnecessaryforestimatingfriendinfluence[41].Networksareconstructed\nfrom up to five male and five female friend nominations from the\nschool roster at each wave separately. The nomination question, with\nmale nominations as the example, was worded as \"List your closest\nmale friends. List your best male friend first, then your next best friend,\nand so on. Girls may include boys who are friends and boyfriends.\"\nAlcohol use\nAlcohol use frequency predicts and is predicted by the friendship\nnetwork. It is based on the question, \"During the last 12 months, on\nhow many days did you drink alcohol?\" This item is a standard intensity\nassessment measured on a seven-point scale with values for never\ndrinks, once or twice in the last year, once a month or less, 2\u00ad3 days\na month, 1\u00ad2 days a week, 3 to 5 days a week, and every day or almost\nevery day [22]. Due to sparse distributions in the upper categories, we\ntop-coded alcohol use at the sixth category. Drinking similarity, which\nranges between 0 (dissimilar) to 1 (perfectly similar), in the network is\nmodest between friends: 0.55 (Sunshine) and 0.61 (Jefferson). In order\nto understand how close friendship is linked to heavier drinking, we\nalso model drunkenness frequency (friend similarity: 0.65 [Sunshine]\nand 0.75 [Jefferson]) with the same categories as for alcohol use, from\nthe following question: \"During the past twelve months, how often did\nyou get drunk?\"\nControl variables\nFemale is included to reflect sex-stratification in adolescent\nfriendships [42], grade level and race/ethnic background [43,44], which\nis captured in the model with an indicator for whether or not dyads are\nofthesamerace/ethnicbackgroundintheselectionmodel,andbyblack,\nHispanic, and Asian indicators in the behavioral model (Jefferson) or\nan indicator for non-white (Sunshine) in the selection model, are all\nincluded. Adolescents self-stratify socioeconomically [45], so parent\neducation (observation 2) is included as: did not graduate from high\nschool, graduated from high school, some higher education, graduated\nfrom college, and obtained advanced schooling.\nThree additional factors related to alcohol use are included. The\nfirst, drawn from observation 2, is parent drinks alcohol (1=never to\n6=nearly every day). Parents model alcohol use [46] and friend-parent\nsimilarity is higher than chance [47]. Because access may support\nalcohol use selectivity, whether alcohol is easy to get (observation 2) is\nmeasured from the question \"Is alcohol easily available to you in your\nhome?\" Finally, whether the youth is a regular smoker (ever smoked at\nleast one cigarette a day for at least 30 days) is a time-varying covariate\nthat influences friend selection [48] and is correlated with alcohol use\n[9,11]. The final control is a time-varying (observations 1 and 2) off-list\nnominations count capturing close friendships outside of school.\nStatistical analysis strategy\nThe analysis uses Snijders and colleagues' [24,35,41] stochastic\nactor-based (SAB) network model. Parameters reflect changes in\nnetwork statistics and drinking across waves using a method of\nmoment's estimator summarizing network-behavior configuration\nchanges between observations. Agent-based simulations update\nparameters, estimate uncertainties, and provide an interpretational\nframework. The data-constrained simulation model decomposes\nnetwork changes into sequential transitions in either one tie or\ndrinking for a randomly selected adolescent. Change opportunities are\ngoverned by rate parameters determining the simulation steps needed\nto reproduce changes in the observed data between observations.\nFriendship selection captures friendships over time. This model\ndimension specifies network structure and attributes on change/\nstability in friendship status [49]. Selection is operationalized with four\nparameters to discriminate between the different ways that drinking\naffects friendships. The alter effect captures the extent to which teens\nare chosen as friends based on their alcohol use (popularity) and the ego\neffect reflects whether drinking is related to nominating more friends\n(sociability). The ego-alter interaction term, the primary selection\neffect, is a dyadic effect expressing an increasing logit of friendships\namong higher drinkers. This effect is included first as a baseline term\ncapturing the presence of a friendship or not. It is then disaggregated\nto reflect (b) the formation of new friendships, and (c) the continuation\nof existing friendships [29]. Other included network controls/statistics\nappear in (Table 1).\nThe friend influence model is similar to ordinal logistic regression\n[50]. In addition to background controls, we include the following\nparameters (see Table 1): In degree expresses how many friendship\nnominations an adolescent received and measures popularity [51].

The average\nnumber of friends nominated in Sunshine decreased from nearly 6\nat observation 1 to 3.5 at observation 3, and from 3.6 to fewer than\n2 in Jefferson Table 3.

Coefficients are logits.\nThe first panel contains results from two models with selection and\ninfluence estimated independently. The three inferences are first that\ndrinking is differentially related to popularity by school; it is related\nto increased popularity in Sunshine (b=.35), but lower popularity in\nalcohol use increases the odds of receiving a friendship nomination by\nselection. Two adolescents with drinking levels one unit above the\nteens with average drinking. Third, average alter in the influence model\nindicates that higher friend use is associated with increasing individual\nuse. For example, in Sunshine, the odds that a teen with average use\nbut whose friends are on average 1-unit above the mean has odds\nfriends also had average use (Table 4).\nModel 3 disaggregates the ego-alter selection term into differences\nin the formation of new friendships and continuation of already\nexisting relationships.

Drinking\nselection is never related to increased friend nominations (sociability),\nand neither popularity (in degree) nor sociability (out degree) predicts\ndrinking changes, indicating that popularity does not predict drinking\nchanges, or that being socially active predicts use.\nDrunkenness model results\nA parallel model series is shown in Table 5 for drunkenness\nfrequency. The results are similar to alcohol use frequency, but also have\nimportant differences. First, drunkenness is never related to popularity\nin Sunshine, suggesting some nonlinearity in the returns to drinking in\nthat setting, and even greater associated negativity in Jefferson. Second,\ndrinking selection in both schools reflects the tendency for heavier\ndrinkers to form new friendships, but is not related to old friendship\ncontinuation. Third, individual drunkenness changes are subject to\nfriend influences, just as with drinking frequency. Notably, there are\nfewer significant effects in Jefferson, mostly as a result of decreasing\nprecision with increasingly complicated models. E.g., the size of\nthe ego-alter interaction (new) is the same across schools, but is not\nsignificant in Jefferson. The influence effect is also of similar size in\nthe joint analysis and is statistically significant due to greater precision\n(Table 5).\nDiscussion\nAdolescent drinking, like other behaviors, predicts friendships,\nbut is also influenced by those relationships [54,55]. We accounted\nfor selection when estimating friend influences on drinking, but also\nextended prior selection research [26-28] by assessing how drinking\nleads to new friendships and the continuation of existing friendships.\nCitation: Cheadle JE, Walsemann KM, Goosby BJ (2015) Teen Alcohol Use and Social Networks: The Contributions of Friend Influence and\nJ Alcohol Drug Depend\nPrior studies have generally not distinguished between friendship\nformation and continuation [21,29], limiting our understanding\nabout how drinking contributes to friendship selection and thus how\nadolescent social networks are configured.\nThe inability of prior research to satisfactorily address selection\nhas fostered numerous criticism that selection, when unaccounted for,\nbiases influence estimates [23,41]. When interventions are designed\naround faulty inferences, the social processes they seek to modify are\nlikely to be ineffective. However, our findings suggest that influence\nand selection are largely independent of one another. Though\nmore research is needed to determine if this finding is generalizable\nacross schools [25], an important implication is that peer influence\nis a viable intervention lever in some schools even when drinking is\nsimultaneously a basis of friendships.\nMost studies assume that selection operates the same for new or\nexistingfriendships[26-28].Onecontributionofourstudyisthefinding\nthat alcohol selection does not have the same relationship with new\nversus existing friendships. We found that drinking is less consistently\nrelated to continuing existing friendships and is instead more strongly\nrelated to forming new friendships. Drinking behaviors in friendship\nselection do not operate the way most research conceptualizes them\nand may in fact largely reflect the opportunities that arise through\npartying rather than a strong preference for drinkers to befriend one\nanother [56]. To the extent that partying reflects novelty and sensation-\nseeking [57], friendships based on partying would exhibit the pattern\nwe have found: new friendships, but not their continuation. Efforts to\nchannel adolescents into exciting but safer environments may support\nthe creation of new and supportive friendships that protect teens from\nIn so far as selection is less interpersonal and more environmental,\nthe more amenable it will be to intervention \u00ad which is an important\nfinding because prior studies assume that selection is not amenable to\nintervention. Future work clarifying whether selection operates at the\ndyad-level or is based on drinking as a \"social focus\" that organizes\nsocial opportunities [59], is thus warranted. Emphasis on friend\ninfluence as a policy lever and concern that friend selection is dyadic\nand not amenable to intervention may have created a false sense that\npeer selection does not represent a promising avenue for intervention.\nOur findings suggest that future inventions should continue pursuing\nstrategies that mitigate negative peer influences, while also developing\nsocializing opportunities fostering opportunities to select on healthy\nbehaviors.\nOur results also have implications for peer counseling, peer\neducation, and peer-led interventions [60], which have been developed\nto mixed success [61-64]. Peer-guided approaches typically seek to\nleverage social network information, such as popularity, to incorporate\npositive peer influence processes into their design [65]. We found that\ndrinking does not strongly increase popularity, and may damage it as\nin the large, heavily minority school. Moreover, we found no evidence\nthat drinking is responsive to popularity.\nUnderstanding the local social dynamics of drinking is important\nas some network processes, such as popularity, differ across schools\nand population subgroups [66]. The between-school differences likely\nreflect different attitudes about drinking in majority and minority\nsettings [67,68]. In general, white teens drink more than minority\nyouth [69,70], and the challenges of acquiring alcohol relative to other\nsubstances in different settings may decrease its `social value' [71] and\ntherefore the implications it has for socially connecting youth to one\nanother and in fostering popularity. Variation in the role of drinking\nin promoting popularity and incorporating peer leaders into programs\nmay have disparate implications in different schools where the social\nstatus rewards of drinking differ.\nDespite limitations (e.g., only two schools), this study makes\nimportant contributions to understanding the social context of\nteen alcohol use. Future work assessing programmatic efforts to\nprevent teen substance use should incorporate longitudinal network\nassessments. Friend selection and influence processes are relatively\nindependent when network and behavior change are considered\ntogether. Determining how alcohol reduction programs can help teens\nsocialize in venues that foster relationships supportive of positive health\nbehaviors, while also using social networks to encourage positive rather\nthan negative behaviors like drinking, remains to be done. Elucidating\nthese joint processes is critical for ascertaining how programs can be\nbetter leveraged to further improve prevention of teen drinking.\n"
