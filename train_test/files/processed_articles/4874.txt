However, that\ninterdisciplinarity brings with it a risk: terms with a technical meaning in their own field\nare used wrongly or too loosely by those from other backgrounds. Unfortunately, this risk\nhas been realized in the case of language evolution, where many of the terms of social\nevolution theory (reciprocal altruism, honest signaling, etc.) are incorrectly used in a way\nthat suggests that certain key fundamentals have been misunderstood. In particular the\ndistinction between proximate and ultimate explanations is often lost, with the result that\nseveral claims made by those interested in language evolution are epistemically incoherent.\nHowever, the correct application of social evolution theory provides simple, clear\nexplanations of why language most likely evolved and how the signals used in language \u00ad\nwords \u00ad remain cheap yet arbitrary.\n",

However, the social evolution of human\ncommunicative behavior has remained at the stage of speculation, with several hypotheses\nThe social evolution of language\nthis speculation misuses or misunderstands the key concepts and terms of social evolution\ntheory, and as a result a number of the positions taken are incoherent. The purpose of this\npaper is twofold. First, to highlight a number of specific examples of such\nmisunderstandings; and second, to show that when social evolution theory is correctly\napplied it produces simple, parsimonious explanations. As I hope to show with a range of\nexamples, there is a real need for such an analysis, for confusion within evolutionary\nlinguistics on matters of social evolution theory is remarkably commonplace.\nIn order to prepare the ground for the arguments to come, the next section makes\nexplicit a crucial distinction, between ultimate and proximate explanations (see Mayr,\n1961; Tinbergen, 1963). I then turn to the question of why we should talk at all, and show\nthat a number of proposed answers to this question come from a misunderstanding of this\nfundamental distinction between the ultimate and the proximate. Once this is made clear\nthen the question of why we should talk is answered straight-forwardly and very generally:\nto influence the (future) behavior of others. I also address the other big question for any\nsocial evolutionary analysis of communication; that of honesty. Why are human utterances\ncheap yet reliable? What keeps the system stable? Contrary to a popular belief within\nevolutionary linguistics (and in intellectual circles more generally) the handicap principle is\nnot the only candidate answer here. In fact, there are several others, and one in particular \u00ad\nthat it is dishonest rather than honest signals that carry costs \u00ad seems very plausible in the\ncase of natural language. I outline the case for this explanation in the fourth section.\nUltimate and proximate explanations\nThe difference between ultimate and proximate explanations is a rich source of\npossible confusion, and so should be clearly delineated at the outset. The difference is\ntypically explained as the difference between the how and the why: ultimate processes\nexplain why certain social behaviors exist, and proximate mechanisms explain how that\nlogic is enforced. This explanation risks confusion, however, since for some scholars\nmechanistic descriptions of behavior are precisely what is sought (this is often the case in\nPsychology) and are therefore given the status of why. The difference is may instead be\ncaptured as the difference between process and product.\nUltimate explanations describe the processes by which the present set of behaviors\nobserved in a population arose and are maintained. It is here that terms like kin selection,\nreciprocity and the like \u00ad the technical terminology of social evolution theory \u00ad find\nmeaningful use: as processes that explain the continued presence of behaviors (like\naltruism) which would be otherwise unexpected under the laws of natural selection. Indeed,\nsuch ultimate, process-driven explanations of social behavior are, essentially, the raison\nd'etre of social evolution theory. In contrast, proximate explanations describe how the logic\nof such processes is manifested in particular cases. So if we accept that some behavior of a\nparticular species is the result of, say, kin selection (an ultimate process), then to complete\nthe story we should also ask how the members of that species recognize kin and how they\ndiscriminate their behavior accordingly (a proximate product of the ultimate process).\nIn fact, ultimate and proximate explanations can be further divided: the former\nincludes both function and phylogeny; the latter mechanism and ontogeny (Tinbergen,\n1952). This four-way distinction, commonly known as the \"four whys\", is the\nmethodological foundation of contemporary ethology. The particular distinction that this\narticle draws attention to is that between function and mechanism. The other two whys are\nThe social evolution of language\nconcerned with developmental issues (of the species and of the organism) and are hence not\ncentral to the points made here.\nAll of these explanations are desirable. Indeed, they complement each other.\nMoreover, because the ultimate and the proximate are different types of explanation, they\ncannot coherently be conflated. Ultimate explanations are not \u00ad not at all \u00ad hypotheses\nabout how the logic they describe is manifested. For example, we may state that peacocks\nhave large tails because of the handicap principle (Grafen, 1990; Zahavi, 1975; Zahavi and\nZahavi, 1997), whereby an organism pays cost as a guarantee of its honesty: only those\npeacocks who are of sufficiently high quality can afford the largest, most cumbersome tails.\nYet this hypothesis makes no necessary statement whatsoever about peacock cognition,\nexcept that such cognition must produce behaviors that approximate the underlying logic of\nthe process. In particular, a full representation of the process and notion of a handicap\n(whatever that might mean in the case of peacocks) is unnecessary. The intentional\nlanguage (e.g., \"The peacock wants the peahen to understand that he is of high-quality\")\nthat is sometimes used to describe such behavior is, then, only as simple but justified\nshorthand for the processes described by social evolution theory (Dennett, 1995; Grafen,\n1999; Hamilton, 1964). Despite everyday meanings, this language is neutral on whether\nand how the peacock can entertain desire (c.f. \"...wants...\") or comprehension (c.f.\n\"...understand...\"). Rather, the terms are used exclusively as an anthropomorphized\nshorthand to conveniently describe animal behavior. Of course, the logic of the handicap\nprinciple must be manifested somehow, and a large part of that story presumably involves\nthe peacock brain, but ultimate explanations (like the handicap principle) can only be\nneutral on this, because ultimate explanations are about process rather than product. The\ntwo types of explanation are fundamentally different, and should not be confused or\nconflated.\nHowever, such confusion does often arise. To illustrate, consider recent work on the\nevolution of cooperation in humans, and specifically the idea of strong reciprocity (Fehr\nreciprocity is defined as a combination of \"a predisposition to reward others for\ncooperative, norm-abiding behaviors... [and] a propensity to impose sanctions on others for\nnorm violations\" (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003, p.785). This is a proximate definition, and\nas such cannot be a solution to the ultimate problem of why such behavior should persist in\nthe face of natural selection (West, Griffin, and Gardner, 2007). Another definition makes\nit clear that strong reciprocity is a product and not a process: \"a strong reciprocator is\npredisposed to cooperate with others and punish non-cooperators, even when this behavior\ncannot be justified in terms of extended kinship or reciprocal altruism\" (Gintis, 2000, p.\n169, italics added). Strong reciprocity is therefore, by its own definition, a hypothesis about\nhow cooperation might be manifested in humans. It is not, however, a hypothesis about why\ncooperation exists at the ultimate level, for it does not describe any process that will\nmaintain the system's stability. This point is well-appreciated within social evolution\ncircles, but the same is not true of evolutionary linguistics, where strong reciprocity is\nsometimes invoked to explain the large-scale cooperation that is plainly necessary for\nlanguage to flourish. Consider the following claim, made by a senior member of the\nevolutionary linguistics community: \"strong reciprocity shows how a weakness in\nreciprocal altruism can be overcome\" (Hurford, 2007, p. 477). Yet any \"weakness\" in\nreciprocal altruism must be overcome by some other evolutionary process, not by the\nThe social evolution of language\nproduct of that process. It is not enough to say that strong reciprocity will do the work\nwhere reciprocity alone is insufficient, because such an explanation says nothing about why\nsuch a set-up would be stable \u00ad which is precisely the problem that reciprocity is sought to\nexplain. The conflation of these two complimentary but different explanations is\nepistemically incoherent.\nThis is not the only example, by any means. The next section surveys some of the\nvarious hypotheses that have been proposed in response to the question of why humans\nshould talk to each other at all, and shows that conflation of proximate and ultimate\nexplanations is remarkably commonplace. However, when we keep the distinction clear\nthen a simple and very general answer presents itself: we talk to influence the future\nbehavior of others.\nWhy talk?\nWhen we talk we pass information onto our conspecifics, some of which will be of\nvalue and use to them. Yet talking carries production costs; if nothing else there is the\nopportunity cost of the time spent in conversation (Maynard Smith and Harper, 1995).\nWhy, then, do we talk? Of course, communication most obviously allows us to coordinate\nour behaviors with far more ease than otherwise, but our communicative instincts go far\nbeyond this. We have a \"robust and passionate urge of some kind to communicate\" (Bates,\n1994, p. 139) with the result that a surprisingly large proportion of the time we spend in\nconversation is spent on those relatively mundane and trivial matters that we call gossip\n(Dunbar, Duncan, and Marriott, 1997). Why, then, are we such enthusiastic users of this\nskill? This question may sound naive at first blush, but no evolutionary answer is\nimmediately forthcoming. Indeed, any real naivety here lies in \"linguistic communism\"\n(Bourdieu, 1991, p. 43): the assumption that humans will simply talk to each other for no\nreason other than the altruistic sharing of information. Correspondingly, several researchers\nhave correctly identified the matter of why we talk at all as a key question for evolutionary\nThe well-known processes of kin selection and/or reciprocal altruism have both\nbeen proposed as solutions, or partial-solutions, to this problem. (Reciprocal altruism is in\nfact a misnamed theory, for it is not a type of altruism at all. On the contrary, what the\ntheory purports to explain is why superficially altruistic acts are in fact not altruistic. A\nbetter term is reciprocity (West, Griffin, and Gardner, 2007), and I will use this hereafter).\nOn this line, large-scale communication is the result of a process whereby we share\ninformation either with kin or with those whom we expect to return the favor. With regard\nto natural language, the problem with the kin selection hypothesis is plain, and\nacknowledged by the most complete argument presented in its favor: \"the glaringly obvious\nflaw in this hypothesis is that today, language is not used exclusively or even\npredominantly to communicate among kin\" (Fitch, 2004, p.292). Reciprocity is a more\npopular explanation, endorsed by several researchers (e.g., Hurford, 2007; Knight, 1998;\nPinker, 2003; Ulbaek, 1998): \"only under the extraordinary conditions of reciprocal\naltruism can information-sharing take place without loss of fitness to the speaker\" (Ulbaek,\n1998, p. 41). In order to evaluate this claim, let us be clear exactly what it states: that our\nwillingness to talk is the result of, and is maintained by, a process whereby we exchange\nconversation on a reciprocal basis. However, our conversational behavior does not support\nthis conclusion: if the donation of information were costly and the receipt of information\nThe social evolution of language\nbeneficial, as the reciprocity hypothesis supposes, then the cheating strategy \u00ad the defect\noption in game-theoretic terms \u00ad would be to absorb the information offered by others and\nnot to speak at all (Dessalles, 1998, 2007). Yet such a strategy does not trigger anything\nthat looks like cheater detection: those that speak only occasionally are not excluded from\nfuture conversations (on the contrary, those most likely to be excluded are those that talk a\ngreat deal but do little in the way of listening, yet if speaking were altruistic then these\nwould be generous individuals indeed). The reciprocation argument depends upon the\nexchange of acts in which one party \u00ad supposedly the speaker in this case \u00ad pays a cost in\norder that the other party \u00ad the listener \u00ad receives a payoff. Yet if cheater detection is any\nguide to the existence of such relationships then this does not occur in the case of\nconversation.\nMoreover, there are further reasons to suppose that speaking has benefits for the\nspeaker, even when unreciprocated. One is our anatomical divergence from other primates:\nour vocal tract is significantly different to both our primate cousins and our ancestors,\nmainly due to the descended larynx, while our ears are not. Although it has been argued\nthat the descended larynx is an adaptation for speech (e.g., Lieberman, 1984), the most\ncompelling explanation is that it evolved to exaggerate size, as it has in other species: a\ndescended larynx produces greater formant dispersion, which is negatively correlated with\nsize (Fitch, 1999, 2002). Vocalizations thus produce some payoff for the speaker, at least in\nsome contexts. As for ears, if information transfer were the function of language, then we\ncould reasonably expect our ears to have developed adaptations to better capture all the\ninput that they can, so that background chatter was no longer just noise but a set of many\ndistinct information sources (Miller, 2000). Yet this is not the case. Of course, these\nthoughts are pure speculation, but the reasoning is certainly not fanciful. At the very least,\nthey are questions that must be addressed by those who suppose that talk is simply the\nprovision of useful information.\nA computational model poses a similar question: if the payoff to communication\nwere simply that the listener gains information, then we should predict more true synonymy\nand less homonymy (Hurford, 2003). The model works as follows. Agents send and receive\nsignals from one another and are evolved according to one of two possible selection\npressures: their fitness is defined either as their ability to signal their intended meaning\ncorrectly, or as their ability to deduce intended meaning correctly. Under the first condition\nthe resulting language is free of true synonymy and rich in homonymy, just as we observe\nin all natural languages. Under the second condition, however, the resulting language was\nrich in synonymy and free of homonymy, a situation never observed among natural\nlanguages. The emergent languages hence resemble real languages only when selection is\nplaced on the agent's productive capabilities, and not their receptive capabilities. This\nsuggests, like the anatomic observations above, that speaking is not the altruistic act of\ninformation sharing that a na\u00efve reading would suppose it to be. Instead, the speaker is\nlikely to have gained something from the interaction, just as the listener will have done. It\nis therefore hard to conclude that the stability of speaking is dependent on reciprocation, a\nprocess by which individual speech acts are costly but are maintained through a process of\nexchange. On the contrary, they suggest that the speaker must receive some net payoff from\neach speech act. In light of these arguments, and the lack of cheater detection discussed\nabove, reciprocation seems a highly unlikely explanation of our enthusiasm to converse\nThe social evolution of language\nOne scholar similarly observes that \"a human speech-community is not a personal\nmutual aid network but is typically an extended group transcending the limits of affiliation\non the basis of residence, economic co-operation or kinship\" (Knight, 1998, p. 75).\nHowever, this observation is then followed by just the sort of error discussed earlier:\nconflation of the proximate and the ultimate. Specifically, it is suggested that the problem\nwas overcome by a \"profound coalitionary restructuring [of human sociality]\". This is a\nproximate explanation \u00ad the structure of human sociality is a product of natural selection,\nnot a process \u00ad and therefore it cannot answer the ultimate problem of why we should talk\nto each other at all.\nThis is not an isolated example. Consider the suggestion that our syntactic abilities\nare based upon the same cognitive mechanisms that must underpin reciprocal altruism\n(Bickerton, 1998). The assumption here is that because reciprocity is about who did what to\nwhom and when, then there must be some cognitive representation of the corresponding\nsocial calculus, and it is this representation that it is suggested was exapted for use in\nsyntax: \"thematic analysis must have been selected-for long before the hominid-pongid\nsplit\" (Bickerton, 1998. p. 351, italics added). This is akin to saying that because ant\nbehavior can be explained in terms of kin selection then ants must have some of the\ncognitive machinery required to do arithmetic (see also Dawkins, 1979). In fact, nothing of\nthe sort is entailed by these processes. (For the record, ants appear to recognize kin through\nsmell (Keller and Ross, 1998)). To repeat the previous section's leitmotif: social evolution\ntheories (kin selection, reciprocity, etc.) are utterly silent \u00ad can only be silent, by their very\nnature \u00ad on how the logic they describe is actually enacted in any given example. Social\nevolution theory may of course guide our intuitions in this regard, but no more than that.\nAlthough it may indeed be the case some general social reasoning skills provided a pre-\nadaptation for syntax (c.f. Seyfarth, Cheney, and Bergman, 2005) this is not a necessary\ncondition; it does not follow as a matter of course. Any such claim must do considerably\nmore than simply observe similarities in the structures of our theories of syntax and social\nbehavior.\nIf it is hard to envisage how reciprocity could occur without a representation of who\ndid what to whom and when, then ask the same question about, say, incest avoidance. Our\nbrains are not pre-wired to represent our family-tree. The evidence instead suggests that a\nsimple heuristic, namely \"Do not have sex with anybody who grew up in the same\nhousehold as you\", does the job to a high-enough degree of approximation (Shepher, 1971,\nto suppose that it will not be based upon some similar heuristic (possibly, ironically\nenough, one that makes use of linguistic markers like, say, accent (Nettle and Dunbar,\n1997)). It is not the case that \"of course, reciprocal altruism theory relies upon animals\nhaving a capacity to remember, in detail, the past behavior of others\" (Hurford, 2007, p.\nThis conflation of the proximate and the ultimate, which, as observed in the\nprevious section, renders such claims technically incoherent, is not the only error that\nevolutionary linguists have made with social evolution theory in general and reciprocity in\nparticular. Consider the following: \"If we inform only those people who are likely to return\nthe favor, both of us can gain the benefits of trade...\" (Pinker, 2003, p. 28). This is the\nreciprocity hypothesis (c.f. \"...benefits of trade...\"). This is then followed by \"...it seems\nclear [though no data is offered \u00ad TSP] that we do use our faculties of social cognition to\nThe social evolution of language\nration our conversation to those with whom we have established a non-exploitative\nrelationship\" (Pinker, 2003, p. 28). This is a more general statement, and not the same thing\nas the reciprocity hypothesis, which specifically states, when it is used correctly, that we\nexchange pieces of information with each other. One is tempted to conclude that at least\nsome of the popularity of the reciprocity idea is due to an imprecise, overly general use of\nthe term.\nThat is not to deny that the establishment of equitable relationships was an\nimportant landmark in the phylogeny of the language faculty. It is just that such\nrelationships are unlikely to have arisen within the tight and specific constraints of\nreciprocity. A more general explanation is more likely, and in the next section I will argue\nfor a major role for reputation. Before then, however, I wish to briefly comment on two of\nthe selfish suggestions as to why we talk without relying on reciprocation, both drawn from\nthe evolutionary psychology literature. Doing so will enable us to see more clearly that the\n\"incredibly boring\" (Pinker and Bloom, 1990, p. 708) conclusion that language evolved\nunder a pressure to communicate complex propositions is most likely the correct one.\nFirst is the thesis that gossip acts as a form of social glue in the same way that\ngrooming does in non-human primates (Dunbar, 1993, 1997). Although this certainly has a\ndegree of plausibility, two comments should be made. The first is that gossip/grooming is\nby no means all that we use language for. We frequently talk to others even without any\ndesire to build or maintain social relationships. Indeed, we occasionally talk to people we\nwould like to break ties with. Second, and more pertinently, this hypothesis does not\nexplain why language need be as complex as it is: if social grooming was the sole function\nof language then grunts could perform the same task, but instead we have a far more\ncognitively complex and evolutionarily costly communicative mechanism (Pinker, 2003).\nA second prominent idea is sexual selection. The suggestion that this process played\na prominent role in the evolution of language goes back as far as Darwin (1871) but it, too,\ncannot tell the whole story, a fact acknowledged by its most prominent modern-day\nadvocate (Miller, 2000). After all, we use communication for far more than attracting\nmates. That does not rule it out completely, of course. Neither do the following two\narguments, both of which have recently been argued to speak against the sexual selection\nhypothesis (Fitch, 2004): first, that sexually selected traits are usually sexually dimorphic,\nwith the displaying sex (typically, but not necessarily, the male) expressing such traits\nexclusively, or at least to a far greater degree, than the choosing sex (typically, but not\nnecessarily, the female); second, that sexually selected traits are not usually expressed until\npuberty.\nWith regard to the first point, the degree to which we should expect to witness\nsexual dimorphism is in large part determined by the mating system employed by the\nspecies, and in particular the relative levels of parental investment in child rearing: the\nmore investment a parent has to make, the less likely they are to display sexually selected\ntraits (Andersson, 1994; Cartwright, 2000). In humans the norm includes a significant role\nfor paternal as well as maternal investment in the young. We should therefore expect both\nsexes to display sexually selected traits. With regards to the second point, it may in fact be\nargued that full linguistic competence does indeed not develop until puberty: language is, in\nits widest sense, more than the ability to produce coherent grammatical utterances; it is also\nthe ability to use such utterances in socially appropriate ways, a skill that does not reach\nadult levels of proficiency until the end of adolescence. Thus, this apparent criticism\nThe social evolution of language\nbecomes a strength of the sexual selection hypothesis; considered in its widest sense,\nlanguage does indeed develop fully only when sexual selection theory predicts that it will.\nIn conclusion, then, we may only be equivocal: sexual advertisement may, like\ngossip, have a role to play. Yet still, these two possibilities (and any possible effects of kin\nselection) do not at all exhaust the range of domains in which we speak. In short, we put\nlanguage to an indefinably large number of uses. This is true of many human traits: \"hands\nmay be very good for throwing rocks, shooting arrows, and pressing triggers, but we not\ninfer that manipulability therefore arose as an adaptation for success in aggression\" (Gould,\n1991, p.53). Indeed; instead we simply conclude that such manipulability is an adaptive end\nin its own right; a versatile tool with a wide range of applications. Similarly, we use a range\nof linguistic devices \u00ad imperatives, declaratives, requests and the like \u00ad to fulfill a diverse\nrange of sociobiological functions, amongst them sexual advertisement and grooming.\nWhat these functions have in common is that all involve the alteration of another's\nbehavior. Rather than claim that any single one is the function of language, we should\ninstead draw the general and banal conclusion that language evolved for the purposes of\ncommunication (c.f. Pinker and Bloom, 1990); after all, the functional alteration of another\norganism's behavior is precisely what it means to communicate (Maynard Smith and\nHarper, 2003). In sum, language's great expressivity reflects its diverse selection pressures.\nDoes such a conclusion actually answer our initial question? We talk to influence\nthe behavior of others, but if that is the whole story then why should others pay attention to\nour utterances? Indeed, what stops us from simply making claims without any substance,\nsimply so that others will believe them and act accordingly? In the conventional terms of\nsocial evolution theory, how is honesty maintained in such a system? That question is the\nfocus of the next section.\nHonesty\nThe theories discussed in the previous section \u00ad kin selection, reciprocal altruism,\netc. \u00ad are those used by social evolutionists to discuss animal social behavior in its many\nforms, including communication. But communication also brings its own, unique problem,\nand with it its own set of theories. That problem \u00ad honesty, or reliability \u00ad is arguably the\ncentral problem for any evolved signaling system: if there is no mechanism by which\nindividual signals are kept honest then free-riders can invade. If one can gain through the\nuse of a dishonest signal without paying additional costs then we should expect natural\nselection to favor such behavior. Consequently, signals will cease to be of value, since\nreceivers have no guarantee of veracity. Ultimately, dishonesty will produce listeners who\nwill not attend to signals and the system will collapse in an evolutionary retelling of\nAesop's fable of the boy who cried wolf.\nBefore we consider this matter for the case of human communication, a brief\nterminological aside is merited. In its everyday use, honesty makes reference to the\nrelationship between a proposition and its truth value. This is roughly the meaning used in\nsocial evolution theory, with the obvious but important caveat that here is its use is\nnecessarily metaphorical; it does not suppose that an animal must have \"meanings\" that are\neither true or false. Rather, terms like honesty are, like the intentional verbs used to\ndescribe animal social behavior more generally, a convenient shorthand that makes use of\nan anthropomorphic gloss of the animal's behavior. We assign an \"intended\" \"meaning\" to\nthe behavior and this allows us to subject it to evolutionary analysis, but this does not at all\nThe social evolution of language\nsuppose that the animal necessarily has \"intentions\" or \"meanings\" in any psychologically\nreal sense. In many ways, this is the same point as the ultimate/proximate distinction\nalready discussed above; honesty is used within social evolution theory in an ultimate and\nnot proximate sense.\nWe may now ask what keeps human communication stable. That is, what prevents\ndishonesty becoming so widespread that trust in others' utterances simply breaks down?\nThis question is surprisingly little addressed by language evolution researchers, mainly\nbecause those who have thought about language in the context of social evolution theory\nhave, as discussed in the previous section, mainly argued that linguistic use can be\nexplained through reciprocity or kin selection, processes that address the problem of\nhonesty before it is asked. But if we accept that these are unlikely explanations of our\nwillingness to talk then we must look elsewhere for a Darwinian explanation of honesty.\nOutside of social evolution theory it is sometimes thought that the handicap principle\nsignals may remain honest, but this is not the case: cost-free honesty does exist in nature,\nand not just in humans. Many male passerines, for example sparrows, typically display\ndominance badges on their plumage; the larger the badge, the greater the bird's RHP\n(Resource Holding Potential; an indexical measure of all factors that influence fighting\nability (Parker, 1974)). However, there appears to be no cost associated with the badge, and\nWhat, then, are the alternative processes that may explain such a phenomenon?\nSeveral have been identified by social evolution theorists (Maynard Smith and Harper,\n\u00b7 Indices \u00ad signals that cannot be faked, because the form of the signal is causally\nrelated to the signal's meaning.\n\u00b7 Coordination games \u00ad where each party has a different preference for the outcome\nof the interaction, but where an overriding common interest is shared (Maynard\n\u00b7 Repeated interactions, or reputation \u00ad where individuals meet each other repeatedly\nover time, it may be in both parties' longer term interests to be honest rather than\ntake whatever short-term payoff may be available through dishonesty (Silk, Kaldor,\nand Boyd, 2000). Depending upon the specifics of the relationship, the most\noptimal strategy may be generally honest with occasional deception (Axelrod, 1995;\n\u00b7 Punishment of false signals \u00ad if dishonesty is punished then this obviously reduces\nor nullifies any possible benefit (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995).\nOf these, it is clear that indices cannot offer a solution to our question, since\nlinguistic form is unrelated to meaning. The handicap principle seems similarly unlikely:\nutterances are metabolically cheap. What of the other three suggestions? A first\nobservation is that they are not strictly independent of one another. A loss of reputation, for\nexample, whilst ostensibly coming under the banner of repeated interactions, could also be\nseen as a punishment. In fact, something very similar has been proposed as a solution to the\nproblem at hand.\nThe crucial idea behind this proposal is that costs are paid not by honest individuals\nas a guarantee of their honesty (\u00e0 la the handicap principle) but by dishonest individuals as\na punishment for their dishonesty (Lachmann, Sz\u00e1mad\u00f3, and Bergstrom, 2001). In this\nThe social evolution of language\nscenario, it is cheap and easy to deceive, but there are costs to be paid for doing so. In\ngame-theoretic terms, the costs are paid away from the equilibrium; they are paid by those\nwho deviate from the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). This contrasts with costly\nsignaling, in which the costs are paid at equilibrium; costs are paid as part of the ESS, and\nthe system works because those costs are correlated with that honesty. Consider the\nparadigmatic example of costly signaling, the peacock's tail. Here, costs are paid by each\npeacock; the greater the costs, the greater the guarantee, and honesty is guaranteed by those\nvery costs.\nThis is different to the dominance badges of sparrows because sparrows will pay\ncosts away from the equilibrium; in other words, if they deviate from honesty. The\nsparrow's signal is one about RHP, and this is easily verified by other sparrows; they may\nsimply approach more closely or, at worst, initiate a fight. In this way, sparrows are\ndeterred from dishonest signaling; such behavior will result either in fights they are\nunlikely to win (if they signal a higher RHP than is true), or in less sexual opportunities (if\nthey signal a lower RHP than is true). In the peacock example, however, the signal is one\nabout genetic quality, and the peahen cannot confirm this until they have sired and raised\nthe peacock's offspring. By this time, any sanctions the peahen may impose will be trivial\nin comparison to the fitness payoff received by the peacock. Hence, the peacock must pay\nsome cost as a guarantee.\nIn other words, if signals can be verified with relative ease, and if there are costs\nattached to being revealed as a liar, then cost-free signaling can be evolutionarily stable. In\nsituations where these conditions do not hold, we should expect signals to be costly.\nSpecifically, this will apply in interactions where the protagonists are unlikely to meet again\nor when communicating about otherwise unverifiable information (Lachmann, Sz\u00e1mad\u00f3, and\nBergstrom, 2001). Of course, dishonesty may still be the more appropriate strategy if the\nexpected payoff is sufficiently large that it outweighs the expected costs. In other words,\ndeception may still pay under certain circumstances, specifically when the benefits associated\nwith doing so outweigh the social costs that will follow.\nHence, honesty can be ensured if dishonesty is costly. One important implication of\nthis analysis is that it allows for signals to take an arbitrary form (ibid.). It has previously\nbeen assumed by some language evolution researchers that signals cannot be arbitrary\nbecause they are open to invasion from cheats: \"resistance to deception has always selected\nagainst conventional [arbitrary \u00ad TSP] signals \u00ad with the one puzzling exception of humans\"\n(Knight, 1998, p. 72, italics added). However, if the costs associated with a signal are\nremoved from the signal form \u00ad that is, when the costs are paid by the dishonest individual \u00ad\nthen the requirement that signal form is causally related to meaning is removed with it.\nConsider again the sparrow's badge of status; not only is it honest but it is also arbitrary.\nGiven the already discussed implausibility of other mechanisms that have been proposed to\nexplain the emergence of arbitrary symbolism, it is tempting to suggest that the imposition of\nsome form of cost for dishonest signaling is a necessary (but obviously not sufficient)\ncondition for such a process to take place.\nI know of no attempts to test this idea with human subjects. In fact, evolutionary\nlinguistics has thus far shown little interest in Lachmann, Sz\u00e1mad\u00f3 and Bergstrom's work,\ndespite its evident power and plausibility. This is not due to a lack of exposure. The work\nwas published in a major journal (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), and is\ncited extensively elsewhere (41 times as of June 2007). However, it is not cited at all in the\nThe social evolution of language\ncollections of work that have arisen from the biannual conferences on the evolution of\nlanguage that have taken place since the article's publication (Cangelosi, Smith, and Smith,\n\"bring together... all the major perspectives on language evolution...\", with each chapter\nwritten by \"key authorities...\" so that \"..together they cast the brightest light yet on\nquestions surrounding the origin and evolution of language\" (Christiansen and Kirby, 2003,\np. 2). Despite these goals the problem of what maintains honesty is barely addressed and\nwhere it is the most plausible and likely solution is not discussed. One inevitably wonders\nif this neglect is simply because the explanatory power of the suggestion, and of social\nevolution theory more generally, is yet to be realized by many language evolution\nresearchers.\nConclusions\nI have sought to make three crucial points. First, I have made clear the distinction\nbetween ultimate and proximate explanations of behavior: the first is concerned with the\nprocess of evolution, the second with its product. These are different types of explanation\nthat, when used correctly, will support and reinforce each other. However, the two are often\nconflated within the language evolution literature, a practice which leads to epistemically\nincoherent claims.\nSecond, even when understood correctly, social evolution theory is often over-\napplied in evolutionary linguistics. A specific example is reciprocity, which in many cases\nappears to be used in a fuzzy way to refer to general social cognition. However, a brief\nanalysis of linguistic behavior shows that its specific claims \u00ad that speaking is costly when\nunreciprocated \u00ad are highly unlikely to be true.\nThis conclusion opens up the question of honesty. Contrary to a common belief\noutside social evolution, the handicap principle is not the only explanatory candidate here.\nMy third central point is therefore that one specific alternative \u00ad that individuals pay costs\nfor dishonesty \u00ad seems very plausible in the case of humans. Bafflingly, this suggestion has\nnot yet been taken up by the evolutionary linguistics community, despite significant\nexposure elsewhere. The need to find an evolutionary explanation for honesty is doubly\nimportant in the case of humans, since multilevel selection means that our individual fitness\nwill be affected not only by our own honesty but by the overall level of honesty in our\nsocial group. The individuals of any group polluted by a high degree of dishonesty \u00ad or any\nother socially divisive behavior \u00ad will lose faith in the notional social contract. This break-\nup of socially-mediated cooperation will most likely lead to selection against the group in\nquestion, in addition to the fitness costs paid by the individual members.\nIt is hard to escape the conclusion that social evolution theory has been too often\nmisused by language evolution researchers. This is regrettable, for when applied correctly it\nis a powerful explanatory tool. It is hoped that this article has shown how that power might\nbe correctly applied to language.\n"
