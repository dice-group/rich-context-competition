    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article examines the association between drug use severity and mortality in primary care patients with substance use\ndisorders. In 848 individuals with known vital status, severity was low in 32%, intermediate in 38%, or substantial/severe\nin 30%. Two-year survival was 93% in the low group, 96% in the medium group, and 92% in the high group (p = .19). The\nage-adjusted risk of death for the high-severity group was twice that of the medium-risk group (hazard ratio = 2.00, 95%\nconfidence interval = [1.02, 3.93]). Individuals in the high group were more likely to die from accidents than those in the\nlow- or medium-severity groups (50% vs. 20%, p = .021). Compared with low- and medium-severity groups, age at death was\n5 years younger in the high-severity group (52 \u00b1 9 vs. 57 \u00b1 6, p = .017). Premature death due to accidental causes in persons\nwith substance use disorders is a persistent yet complex problem.\n",

Whether these\npremature deaths are preventable is a critical question. With\nrespect to substance use disorders, the risk of premature\ndeath varies by many possible factors, including type of\ndrug, severity of use, trajectory of drug use, co-occurring\npsychiatric illness, and other personal characteristics, includ-\ning age, gender, race socioeconomic status, health status, or\nhealth behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol use (Bargagli\nSome of these factors are not modifiable (e.g., age), or are\nvery difficult to modify (e.g., socioeconomic status), whereas\nothers such as drug use severity are potentially modifiable.\nThe purpose of this article is to examine the association\nbetween drug use severity and mortality as well as cause of\ndeath in primary care patients with substance use disorders.\nThe motivation for conducting this analysis stems from the\nidea that if there were an association, then intervening to\nreduce severity could result in lower rates of premature\ndeath.\nMethod\nPatient Population\nwere enrolled in a randomized clinical trial designed to\nexamine the effects of a one-time brief intervention for prob-\nlem drug use (Roy-Byrne et al., 2014).All individuals agreed\nto be assessed at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.\nWhile some of these individuals had alcohol use disorders,\nthe focus of the study was on problem drug use and not prob-\nlem alcohol use. There were 848 (98%) individuals who gave\nconsent for researchers to search administrative data, includ-\ning arrest records, hospital discharge abstracts, chemical\ndependency treatment records, and Washington State death\nrecords. These individuals received medical care in seven\nprimary care clinics affiliated with a public safety net hospi-\ntal in King County, Washington.

This study included 848 individuals with\nknown vital status.\nStudy Variables\nFor this study, there was extensive information on patient\ncharacteristics including sociodemographic variables as well\nas assessments of drug and alcohol use in the year prior to\nand after study enrollment (Roy-Byrne et al., 2014). Drug\nuse in the month prior to enrollment was assessed with the\nAddiction Severity Index (ASI; Cacciola, Alterman,\nMcLellan, Lin, & Lynch, 2007). The major independent vari-\nable, the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), was used to\ndefine problem drug severity as low (score = 1-2), intermedi-\nate (score = 3-5), or substantial/severe (score  6; Yudko,\nonly at baseline, whereas the ASI was administered at regu-\nlar follow-up assessment times.\nThe primary dependent variable in this study was vital\nstatus determined primarily from Washington State death\nrecords provided by the Washington State Department of\nHealth. These records are electronic versions of death certifi-\ncates and include the underlying cause of death. Washington\nable and were linked to study participants using name, date\nof birth, gender, and social security number if available.\nDeath reporting for the first 6 months of 2014 was provi-\nsional and not yet complete. Other sources of vital status\nincluded obituaries, the Social Security Death Master File,\nand primary care clinics where patients received health care.\nSurvival time was calculated as the number of days from\nenrollment to death or June 30, 2014, for survivors. Cause of\ndeath, available only from death certificates, was categorized\naccording to International Classification of Diseases, Version\n10 codes and was classified as (a) diseases of the heart; (b)\nmalignant neoplasms; (c) external, including accidents and\nsuicide; (d) chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; (e) infectious;\nStatistical Method\nThe chi-square statistic was used to assess the association\nbetween categorical variables and DAST-10 score category,\nand the one way analysis of variance was used for continu-\nous variables such as age. Survival curves were constructed\naccording to the Kaplan\u00adMeier method. The log rank statis-\ntic was used to determine whether unadjusted survival dif-\nfered among the three DAST-10 score categories. To further\nexamine whether DAST-10 score category was associated\nwith vital status, we ran several Cox regression analyses.\nFirst, the unadjusted association between DAST-10 score\ncategory and survival was determined; second, given that\nsurvival decreases with increasing age, the age-adjusted\nassociation was examined; and third, forward stepwise selec-\ntion was used to identify statistically significant predictors of\noutcome, and after all statistically significant predictors\nentered the model, DAST-10 score category was forced into\nthe model. Finally, chi-square analysis was used to examine\nthe relation between DAST-10 category score and cause of\ndeath.\nResults\nFor the 848 participants, the DAST-10 score category was\nbetween baseline characteristics and DAST-10 score cate-\ngory. p values refer to overall association between the vari-\nable of interest and the DAST-10 score category. Age\ndecreased with increasing severity of the drug problem,\nwhereas gender was not associated with DAST-10 score cat-\negory. Overall, there was a statistically significant associa-\ntion between race and DAST-10 score category (p = .005).\nDAST-10 score category, whereas there were 537 individu-\nals who were not Black and 209 (39%) were in the low cat-\negory. In general, individuals in the high-severity group had\nsocially less stable situations in that they were less likely to\nbe married or living with a partner, had lower levels of edu-\ncation, and were more likely to be disabled and unable to\nwork. Significantly, 50% of the high-severity group was\nhomeless for at least one night in the past 3 months.\nNot surprisingly, the high-severity group had a higher ASI\ndrug use composite score as seen in Table 2. The high-\nseverity group was less likely to use marijuana, but was more\nlikely to use stimulants, opiates, sedatives, or two or more\ndrugs. Intravenous drug use was very low in the low- and\nmedium-severity groups, yet was much higher in the high-\nseverity group. Overall, the majority of participants used\nalcohol and tobacco, although the high-severity group was\nTable 1.

Notably, a higher percent\nof the high-severity group had a goal of total abstinence from\ndrugs.\nThere were 57 deaths, and 55 appeared in Washington\nState Death Records. Average follow-up was 3.6 \u00b1 1.1 years.\nAs seen in Figure 1, overall 2-year survival was 94% and\nmedium group, and 92% in the high group (p = .19, by log\nrank statistic). Cox regression was used to further investigate\nthe association between drug use severity and survival.\nBecause survival was highest in the medium group, it was\nTable 2.

Cause of Death and Drug Use Severity.\nNote. DAST-10 = Drug Abuse Screening Test.\nselected as the reference category. As seen in Table 3, the\nunadjusted association between DAST-10 score category\nwas not statistically significant. In comparison with the\nmedium-severity group, the hazard ratios were higher for the\nlow- and high-severity groups, but the differences were not\nstatistically different. After adjusting for age alone, the risk\nof death for the high-severity group was twice that of the\nmedium risk group; this difference was statistically signifi-\ncant as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was\n1.02. In the third model, age and intravenous drug use were\nthe only two variables selected from candidate variables in\nTable 2. After adjustment for these two factors, the hazard of\ndeath for both low- and high-severity groups compared with\nthe medium-severity group was higher but not statistically\ndifferent as indicated by the wide confidence intervals.\nUnderlying causes for the 55 deaths that appeared in\nWashington State death records are shown in Table 4.\nOverall, there was no association between cause of death and\nthe percent of external causes of death was higher in the\nhigh-severity group than it was in the low- and medium-\nOverall, there were four (two in the low group and one\neach in the medium and high groups) deaths due to lung can-\ncer and another four (one each in the low- and medium-\nseverity groups and two in the high group) due to human\nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syn-\ndrome (HIV/AIDS). Three individuals who succumbed to\nlung cancer were current smokers, and two who died of HIV/\nAIDS were intravenous drug users. There were an additional\nseven individuals who died of chronic liver disease related to\nalcohol use, three of whom were in the low-severity group.\nThe age at death was 52 \u00b1 9 years in the high-severity group\nand was higher in the low- (58 \u00b1 6 years) and medium-\nseverity (57 \u00b1 6 years) groups. Compared with the low- and\nmedium-severity groups, the 5-year difference in age at\ndeath for the high-severity group was statistically significant,\nDiscussion\nIn this group of individuals who had substance use disorders\nand received primary care in clinics affiliated with a public\nsafety net hospital, high-severity problem drug use was asso-\nciated with worse survival, accidental death, and earlier age\nat death. The estimated death rate in this group of 848 indi-\nthe U.S. age-adjusted death rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 per\nhigh for all individuals in the study, compared with those\nwith medium severity, individuals with high severity had\ntwice the risk of death after adjusting for age. The associa-\ntion between severity and mortality was not linear, in that\nthose with medium severity had better survival than those\nwith low severity. This is a little puzzling as the low-severity\ngroup had less disability and psychiatric illness, although\nthey were slightly older and more often never married.\nIndividuals in the high-severity group were 2 to 3 years\nyounger than those with low- or medium-severity problem\ndrug use, yet their average age at death was 5 to 6 years\nyounger than their counterparts in the other two groups.\nAlso notable were differences in the underlying cause of\ndeath as reported on death certificates; individuals in the\nFigure 1.

Individuals in the low- or medium-severity\ngroups had a higher percent of deaths due to cancer or car-\ndiovascular diseases, yet also died of conditions related to\nsubstance use disorders, including alcohol use disorders.\nWhile these findings were not particularly unexpected,\nthey tell a tragic story of premature death and potentially\navoidable deaths due to accidents among individuals with\nproblem drug use (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006; Dembling\nParticipants in the trial used a variety of drugs including mar-\nijuana, prescription opiates, methadone, heroin, and stimu-\nlants as well as alcohol and nicotine. In addition, a high\nproportion had accompanying psychiatric illness. Nationally,\nthere are 23 million Americans who have substance use dis-\norders, yet only 10% access treatment (Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration, 2013). The stigma\nassociated with drug addiction and alcohol addiction to a\nlesser extent is a major barrier to treatment of what has been\ncalled the leading cause of preventable death in the United\nIt is beyond the scope of this study to determine whether\nsome deaths were preventable. Although the results were\nstriking, they are based on only 55 deaths that were reported\nin Washington State death records. There are the usual con-\ncerns about the validity of the underlying cause of death as\nstated on the death certificate as well as the difficulty of dis-\ntinguishing deaths due to accidents from those that were\nintentional. Another limitation has to do with the measure of\nalcohol consumption; individuals reported the number of\ndays per month they consumed alcohol and did not report\nhow much they drank at a given time. Consequently, it was\nnot possible to assess the relative contributions of drug and\nalcohol use to survival.\nLimitations regarding the completeness of death records\nand accuracy of the underlying cause of death do not call into\nquestion the finding that drug use severity was associated\nwith decreased survival and more accidental deaths. Despite\nbeing younger than their counterparts with low or medium\nseverity, persons with high severity died at younger ages.\nThese findings have been previously reported and are\nunlikely to improve without changes in the way addiction is\nviewed by providers, health care organizations, legislative\nbodies, and the larger society (Kelly et al., 2015).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This study was\nReferences\nBargagli, A.
