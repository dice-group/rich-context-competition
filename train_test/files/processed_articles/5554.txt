In this study, 86.8%\nof those who had updated training had the most positive attitudes toward training ( = .293, p < .05). Furthermore, 80% of\nthose who had negative training attitudes also had negative views on their proficiency ( = .465, p < .000).\n",

Furthermore, several authors have sug-\ngested that training is most extensive only in establishments\nwhich operate in complex market environments (Rowden &\nden and Conine (2005) indicate that there is limited research\non human resource development in small and midsized busi-\nnesses. According to these authors, most people believe that\nsmall businesses do little, if any, development of their work-\ners. Moreover, Rowden and Conine cite Training Magazine,\nwhich annually conducts research on the training industry in\nthe United States, as not even attempting to contact busi-\nnesses with fewer than 100 employees. In addition, in their\nannual research sample, only 16% consisted of companies\nresource development occurs in small businesses (Hill &\nStewart, 1999). In summary, a slowly growing number of\nauthors are currently doing more research in the areas of\ntraining and development and its effects on employees that\nwe have not seen in past literature.\nMonths of research failed to locate objective evidence in\nsupport of connecting training and attitude, its impact on job\nproficiencies, and the employee's perception that lack of\nmeaningful training directly affects proficiencies and atti-\ntude. The objective of this study is to gather and provide\nempirical data for training relationships that are not currently\navailable.\nCheng and Ho (2001) also discuss the importance of\ntraining and its impact on job performance:\nWhile employee performance is one of the crucial mea-\nsures emphasized by the top management, employees\nare more concerned about their own productivity and\nare increasingly aware of the accelerated obsolescence\nof knowledge and skills in their turbulent environment.\nAs the literature suggests, by effectively training and\ndeveloping employees, they will become more aligned\nfor career growth--career potential enhances personal\n1Salisbury University, MD, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: dltruitt@salisbury.edu\nThe Effect of Training and Development\non Employee Attitude as it Relates\nto Training and Work Proficiency\nDebra L.Truitt1\n Keywords\ndevelopment, training, attitudes, job proficiency\n2 SAGE Open\nTo illustrate Cheng and Ho's (2001) position, Constantino\nand Merchant (1996) comment that \"both training and educa-\ntion are necessary components for a successful conflict man-\nagement system \" (p. 22). One might clearly imagine how\nfailure to provide training and education by the organization\ncould result in conflict between employer and employee.\nSuch conflict could potentially lead to any number of compli-\ncated scenarios, including but not limited to formal com-\nplaints by the employee which eventually become actual law\nsuits against the organization, all of which could cost the\nindustry time, energy, and money. When universities or busi-\nnesses withhold opportunities for training and development,\nthey also fail to demonstrate an understanding of how to iden-\ntify organizational conflict. According to these same authors,\nall organizations should have a conflict management system\nin place (Constantino & Merchant, 1996). When conflict is\nmanifested in the organization by clusters of employees who\nare dissatisfied, this group dissatisfaction state of mind can\nresult in frenzied chaos, dissatisfaction, grievances, and tur-\nmoil in the organization. Again, having a conflict manage-\nment system in place would potentially be able to short circuit\nsuch a disruptive process. Clearly, it is extremely important\nthat employees benefit from ongoing employer provided train-\ning. \"One of the most frequently encountered human capital\ndevelopment interventions is training\" (Campbell & Kuncel,\nbehaviors have to be transferred to the workplace, maintained\nover time, and generalized across contexts (Holton & Baldwin,\n2000). Consequently, specific job training is a complicated\nmatter and has been the focus of much of the training literature\n(Chiaburu & Teklab, 2005). More specifically, in addition to\nthe exact nature of job training, training is seen as relevant to\nfostering a positive relationship between learning satisfaction\nand the effectiveness of applied learning (Liu, 2002; Wang,\n2001). As an aside, even though authors have suggested that\ntraining programs are vital to organizations (Knoke &\nare often the first to go (Young, 2008). This trend to cut train-\ning programs during poor economic times seems short-\nsighted, if in fact, training does affect job proficiency and\nrelieves workplace conflict. The definition of results and\nempirical data included in this study demonstrates that\nemployee do, in fact, perceive that training directly effects\njob proficiency is an indicator which many employers inter-\nested in sound business management and growth in the mar-\nketplace should subscribe to initiating and maintaining\nofferings of soft skill (leadership, effective communica-\ntions, and coaching) and technical proficiency training.\nMoreover, several authors have also written about the\nimportance of staff development. Both formal and informal\ntraining opportunities are thought to provide a forum for the\ndevelopment of talent. When talent is fostered and nur-\ntured, competitive advantages in performance are untainted\nPeters & Waterman, 1982). Furthermore, the organizational\ncommitment or \"the relative strength of an individual's iden-\ntification and involvement in a particular organization\"\ndevelopment programs.According to these authors, organiza-\ntions demonstrating keen insight make provisions for satis-\nfying the training needs of their current workforce. Cheng\nand Ho (2001) indicate that adequate training produces\nmarked improvements in employee communication and pro-\nficiency of performances as well as extending retention time.\nMoreover, when programs target communication skills with\ncoworkers, there are significant increases in profit as well as\na greater number of reported positive working relationships\nthat are formed. Employees with good communication skills\ngather more information concerning procedures and tech-\nnologies related to job performances, thus assuming greater\naccountability and subsequent responsibility, both of which\nAlso, training and education have been shown to have a sig-\nnificant positive effect on job involvement, job satisfaction,\nand organizational commitment (Karia & Asaari, 2006).\nSimilarly, Ahmad and Karia (n.d.) have emphasized the\nrelationship between training and attitude as it relates to\nworking with others. Employees with positive attitudes\nbecome stakeholders in the process and job accomplishment\nis of a higher priority. Furthermore, successful organizations\nachieve a partnership between workers and management.\nThe partnership includes participation in teamwork activities\nand continuous learning application. The reported findings\nfurther suggest that an employee's participation in decision\nmaking and problem solving develops organizational trust\nCorporations and businesses need to grow and innovate\ncontinuously, pursue sustained development, and cope with\nrapid changes in their external environments as well as\nincreasingly competitive international markets. Hence, orga-\nnizations need to strengthen or expand the knowledge base,\nskills, and abilities of their employees. For this purpose, edu-\ncation and training must be incorporated into a systematic\nand formal system if the goals of employees and corporation\nTraining, as defined in the present study \"is the planned\nintervention that is designed to enhance the determinants of\nindividual job performance\" (Chiaburu &Teklab, 2005).\nTraining is related to the skills an employee must acquire to\nimprove the probability of achieving the organization's over-\nall business and academic goals and objectives. Positive\ntraining offered to employees may assist with reduction of\nanxiety or frustration, which most employees have experi-\nenced on more than one occasion during their employment\nAccording to Tsai, Yen, Huang, and Huang (2007),\nemployees who are committed to learning showed a higher\nlevel of job satisfaction that has a positive effect on their\nperformance. Moreover, Locke defined job satisfaction as a\npleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from a\npositive appraisal of the job or job experiences (Locke,\n1976). The literature suggests that commitment results from\nadequate training and development for successful job com-\npletion and an increase in job performance (Tsai et al., 2007).\nIn addition, the larger the gap between the skills required\nto perform a task and the actual skills available for perform-\ning a task, the greater the lack of job satisfaction and the\ngreater the increase in employee turnover within the organi-\nzation. Conversely then, not having the skills to perform a\njob correctly can set up employees for failure and put the\nbusiness at a less-than-competitive disadvantage. The result-\ning high turnover would predict the need for even more\ntraining that would then have a direct impact on the bottom\nline of any business.\nMoreover, poor performance reviews due to inadequate\njob training can produce employee dissatisfaction and con-\nflict. Although there is no direct link in the literature between\ntraining and job satisfaction, Rowden and Shamsuddin\nthoroughly trained employees will better satisfy the needs of\ntheir customers and employees.\nIn summary, although the literature strongly suggests a\ndirect relationship between job training and job perfor-\nmance as well as job training and employee attitudes, there\nis little empirical support for this suggestion. Clearly, there\nis a need to provide such empirical support. The purpose of\nthe present study was to explore the relationship between\ntraining and development and its perceived impact on\nemployee attitudes and perceived job performance profi-\nciencies. The empirical data suggest a perceived gap by the\nemployees between training attitudes and job proficien-\ncies. This gap could then result in conflict between the\nemployee and employer relationship. The present study\nelaborates and extends previous research by exploring par-\nticipant attitudes in an academic institution as well as in\nthree businesses, one of which is a small-to-moderate size\nbusiness that is usually overlooked in other research stud-\nies. The hypotheses in this study specifically address the\nrelationship between employees with training experiences\nwho have positive attitudes about training (training atti-\ntudes), and those positive training attitudes are perceived\nto improve job proficiency.\nMethod\nProcedures\nUsing convenience sampling, four organizations were\nrecruited through personal contacts with business profession-\nals, including one university and three for-profit businesses.\nParticipation by the academic institution was approved by the\nDirector of Human Resources. The approving and granting\nauthority for the companies was respectively the Director of\nOperations, Executive Advisory Board Committee, and\nPresident.\nThe strategy behind the choice of this particular target\npopulation was to determine cultural variations between aca-\ndemic and for-profit businesses by assessing attitudinal dif-\nferences in relation to training and development and by\ncomparing the result of these assessments. The exempt/\nsalary and nonexempt/hourly staff at the academic institu-\ntion was selected based on past history of training and devel-\nopment if the Human Resources Department had offered\ntraining opportunities. The university's Human Resource\nDepartment provided the primary investigator a list of all\nexempt/salary and nonexempt/hourly employees. A survey\ndeveloped by the primary investigator, along with other sup-\nporting documents, was sent to each employee on the list.\nEach company that was contacted also reported ongoing\ntraining initiatives and offerings similar to those offered by the\nacademic institution in the past. The participants representing\nthe three companies were determined by their availability and\nwillingness to volunteer to participate in the survey. In accor-\ndance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Committee,\nparticipant anonymity was maintained.\nParticipants were provided a packet containing a partici-\npant instruction sheet, a risks/benefits analysis sheet, a disclo-\nsure form, a consent form, a survey form, and a self-addressed,\nstamped envelope addressed to the primary investigator.\nOnce data were returned to the primary investigator, all\nconsent forms were separated from the original survey, placed\nin a designated folder, and locked in a file cabinet housed in\nthe primary investigator's locked office. All returned surveys\nwere coded and the results entered into a statistical system\npackage (PASW). All data had been run and completed, and\nthe results of the surveys are made available on request.\nThe initial sample for this study totaled 487 full-time\nexempt/salaried and nonexempt/hourly employees. The total\nnumber of surveys returned was 237, yielding a response rate\nof 48.6%. Each participating business had ongoing training\ninitiatives and offerings similar to those of the academic\ninstitution. All participants for this study were selected based\non their availability and willingness to participate. No com-\npensation was given in exchange for participation. This\nstudy was approved by the university's Institutional Review\nBoard (IRB; see Appendix A)\nThe sampled organizations include a university in Maryland\nwith 380 exempt and nonexempt employees, an Arizona\nCorporation's subdivision of 50 employees, a Delaware\ncompany's department with 34 employees, and a Maryland\nCorporation with 60 employees. Random sampling tech-\nniques were employed to arrive at a representative sample of\neach division of interest.\nSurvey Development andTesting\nThe survey for this study was created by the author as part\nof a graduate course requirement. The survey was composed\nof 20 items, 16 of which were rated on a 4-point Likert-type\nscale ranging from 1= fully disagree to 4 = fully agree. Three\n4 SAGE Open\nremaining items were demographic information (gender,\nage, and job status). The final item was an open-ended ques-\ntion that asked participates about preferred training proto-\ncols. This final item was analyzed separately and did not\ndirectly address the hypotheses.\nTwo different reliability measures were generated to test\nthe survey instrument used for this research. A Cronbach's\nalpha test of reliability was used to establish the internal reli-\nability of the scaled variables as a whole. The Cronbach's\nalpha score derived was .915 (see Table 1), surpassing the\nAsecond reliability measure called the Guttman Split-Half\nReliability Coefficient Statistic was computed to assure reli-\nability of the scale items. The test is designed to compare the\nitems in the first half of the scale with the items in the second\nhalf of the scale. The obtained Guttman value was .815, sug-\ngesting strong reliability of the instrument (see Table 1).\nInstrument validity tests were conducted using experts and\nhypotheses testing. A psychologist, human resources repre-\nsentative, business vice president, and business employee\nreviewed the survey to establish face validity. All four agreed\nthat the questions on the survey appeared to measure what\nthey were intended to measure. Construct validity using\nhypothesis testing assesses the correspondence between\nthe concept itself and the empirical indicators of the con-\ncept. Concurrent validity also uses hypothesis testing to show\ndifferences between groups about whom we know differences\nexist. Each of the hypotheses below was tested using chi-\nsquare and gamma statistical procedures.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Those employees with training\nexperiences have positive attitudes about training\n(training attitudes).\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Positive training attitudes are per-\nceived to improve job proficiency.\nData Overview\nSample demographics.

These are the following: Updated Training--Item 6\non survey instrument, Effective Coaching--Item 8,\nMeaningful Coaching--Item 9, Solicits Input--Item 12.\nTraining Attitudes is a scale created using Questions 1 to 5\non the survey instrument (see items listed below).\nQuestion 1: Effective Tools--On-the-job training is an\neffective tool for learning new skills.\nQuestion 2: Communications--Developmental train-\ning should include effective communications, team\nbuilding, and coaching.\nQuestion 3: Levels--Development training should be\nafforded to all levels and/or positions.\nQuestion 4: Growth and Advancement--Training and\ndevelopment is important for job growth.\nQuestion 5: Advancement--Training and develop-\nment is important for potential advancement.\nDependentVariables\nThe following two variables, training attitudes and profi-\nciency, that are described above were identified in the\nhypotheses as the dependent variables in this study.\nProficiency is also a scale using Items 6, 8, 9, and 12 from\nthe survey.\nQuestion 6: Updated Training--I receive updated\ntraining which is required for my position.\nQuestion 8: Adequate Training--My supervisor con-\nducts effective coaching sessions with me.\nQuestion 9: Meaningful Coaching--My coaching ses-\nsions are meaningful and motivational.\nQuestion 12: Solicits Input--My supervisor solicits\nmy input on issues and opportunities.\nIn terms of construct validity, the results of Tables 4 and 5\nsuggest that the concepts (training attitudes and perceived\njob proficiency) do in fact measure what they are intended\nto measure.\nTable 4 on updated training by training attitudes has a\nmoderately strong gamma score of .293 that is statistically\nTable 4.

Out of 87 responses, 47\nparticipants (54%) requested more soft skill training such as\nleadership, effective communications, and mentoring.

This finding\nalso supports the literature that discusses the impact of job\ntraining on psychological variables such as motivation and\nand willingness to go above and beyond to meet their job\nAlthough this study did not directly assess organizational\n\"conflict,\" it seems clear that because training is seen to be\nso important in forming positive attitudes that it may further\nlead to job proficiency, and not receiving adequate training is\nassociated with a feeling of reduced competency, it seems\nvery reasonable to predict that poor training could result in\npoor attitudes about performance, which then could lead to\npoor performance. This finding opens up employees to an\nentire set of potential consequences; one such consequence\nis conflict in the workplace environment. Other conse-\nquences could include poor performance review, lack of\norganizational trust (because the employee feels unfairly\nevaluated due to not receiving adequate training for job func-\ntions), and the beginning of a downhill spiral leading to\npossible termination and subsequent loss of resources for the\norganization.\nClearly, where job training is concerned, poor fits between\nemployee and the job/organization may result in eventual\nperformance gaps (Harrison, 2005) emphasizing the need for\nconflict management systems to be in place at all levels of\nthe organization.\nSurprisingly, the research did not find significant dif-\nferences in attitudes between the younger and older\nemployees. However, the research did find significant dif-\nferences between men and women with respect to overall\npositive training attitudes. Women, significantly more often\nthan men, indicated positive attitudes toward training. It\nwas not known if these results suggest that women felt that\ntraining is more beneficial because of the technical nature\nof current job demands being placed on women(who may\nnot feel prepared for these demands), or if women are more\nsupportive in general of extra educational offerings than\nare men. Future research may address this gender-related\ndisparity when developing future training programs.\nAlthough exempt/salary and the nonexempt/hourly\nemployees fully agreed that training was related to job profi-\nciency, when they disagreed, they significantly disagreed.\nSpecifically, nonexempt/hourly employees disagreed more\nstrongly that attitudes were related to job proficiency.\nAlthough an interesting finding, more interesting is the\nTable 13.

This author was told\nthat in the Arizona Corporation, job training occurs very\nregularly, and for the first three probationary years, employ-\nees are expected to pass proficiency tests following each\ntraining session to stay employed with the company. An\nexcellent study for future research might investigate whether\njob training requiring passing proficiency tests as a condition\nof employment is more valuable than training without the\nconditional testing criteria.\nIn summary, this author researched the hypotheses that\nadequate job training is related to positive attitudes about job\nproficiency and that having adequate job training is related\nto positive attitudes about job training. The results have sup-\nported the hypotheses. However, given the nature of the\nresearch, there are several limitations to this study.\nSurvey research has many problems associated with its\nuse. Surveys are self-reported instruments and, as such, may\nnot be completely valid or reliable. However, it can be\nreported that a strong internal consistency of the instrument\nwas confirmed by using both Cronbach's alpha and\nGuttman's split-half coefficient. Both of these measures pro-\nvide reliability information when instruments use formats\nthat generate ordinal data.\nA major limitation to the interpretation of the results has\nto do with the instrument (see Appendix B). A close exami-\nnation of Appendix B shows the direction provided between\nQuestions 5 and 6, \"If you have not had training, please skip\nQuestions 6-12.\" This directive probably should not have\nbeen included on this questionnaire because it may have\neliminated all those respondents who have never been\ntrained, leaving only respondents who have had some train-\ning, effective and ineffective, meaningful and nonmeaning-\nful. Given that industry trains very often, and given that the\nreturn rate for the three for-profit organizations was 100%,\nthe missing data came from the Maryland university sam-\nthe Maryland University. Omitting this directive may have\nextended the sample from those who had some type of train-\ning to include a category for those who had never received\ntraining, making the comparison more meaningful. Based\non the present finding, one may never know how those\n\"never having training\" felt about their competence.\nMoreover, it may have been better to have used a true\n7-point Likert-type scale, allowing the author to make finer\ndiscriminations in the findings.\nIn addition, the survey could have included more useful\ndemographic information questions as well as questions\nrelated to conflict. Specifically, respondents could have been\nasked if they felt they received the right amount of training,\nand if that having the right amount of training ever resulted\nin a negative performance consequences. Respondents could\nalso have been asked questions related to how conflict is\nmediated in their workplace and how important it was to\nthem to have an actual conflict management system in place\nin their place of work.\nEven though the study could have been methodologically\nimproved in several ways, it is still important to state that\nthis study is one of only a few attempting empirically to\nanswer questions related to the importance of job training.\nFurthermore, this study is also a first attempt at trying to\nassess the real importance of job training to the employee\nand the far-reaching complications of the ensuing conflict in\nour present day work environments where the employee\nperceives that meaningful job training is unavailable. Chris\nYoung of Rainmaker Group, Inc. has noted that the \"training\nand development budget is often the first to go and the last\nto come back\" (Young, 2008). Organizations undergoing\nfiscal challenges may target employee training as the first\ncost-cutting measure. If we follow the collective wisdom of\nsuccessful businesses, conflict management system pro-\nfessionals, and the results of this empirical research, one\nmust conclude that effective and ongoing training and\ndevelopment should be the final cost-cutting measure.\nTraining and its positive effects on employee attitude and\nproficiencies create long-lasting stakeholders and could\nserve as the binding force for business success during trou-\nble times.\nWhen understanding the connection between employee\nattitudes about competence and potential organizational con-\nflict, a conflict management system may be the first line of\ndefense to assess and assist in the analysis of the fits and\ngaps when dealing with the organizational culture of attitude\nand training.\nCheng and Ho (2001) claim that as a result, \"ungraded\"\nemployees look for improving their job performance as well\nas enhancing their future career prospects. Obviously, when\nemployees transfer their positive learning content to their\njob, a win\u00adwin solution for organizations and employees can\nbe accomplished. Therefore, when employees are provided\nbetter and more intensive training, the result is an increase in\nself-worth and greater job performance proficiency. If the\nemployee's perception is one of having sufficient training\nand development, it may also serve as a catalyst for enhanc-\ning the employee teaming effect.\nFuture research could build on this study's results by\nmeasuring quantitatively the actual increases in job perfor-\nmance as well as the actual changes in job proficiency atti-\ntudes.This could be accomplished in a simple pretest\u00adposttest\ndesign using a control group not having had the training as a\ncomparison group. It would be valuable to connect percep-\ntion to actual changes in job performance that can be quanti-\nfied and measured. Attitude studies like this one are limited\nto representing what the person would be feeling should he\nor she be in that position, or try to recall what he or she felt\nwhen she actually was in that position. More actual behav-\nioral data of this nature might convince upper level manage-\nment to invest in employee development programs. It is\nimportant for employers to provide relevant and meaningful\ntraining for the employees, which supports and enhances\nemployee attitude. When training is perceived by the\nemployee to be relevant and meaningful, the results may be\ndemonstrated through improved proficiencies.\nWhen examining the open-ended question on the survey\nthat asked about preferred training programs to be offered,\nmost responders requested training on soft skills, such as\nleadership, values, effective communications, and so on, and\ntechnology training such as, computer literacy, computer\nupdated software programs, and so on. These results of the\nopen-ended question strengthen our position that employees\nrequire and desire training that will make them competitive\nin this highly demanding market.\nThe present survey was conducted to assess a relationship\nbetween attitudes about training and perceived subsequent\njob proficiency. The data that were collected supported our\nhypotheses that job training is correlated with positive feel-\nings about job training and that positive job training predicts\npositive attitudes about job proficiency. Limitations to this\nstudy have been considered and suggestions for future\nresearch have been provided. Clearly, empirical research in\nthe area of expected job training and resulted job proficiency\nand potential organizational conflict is only in its infancy.\nThis study has been an important first step in this line of\nresearch.\nAppendix A\nStatement of Approval Committee\non Human Research\u00adAddendum\nSalisbury\nStatement of Approval\nCommittee on Human Research\nTo: Debra Truitt\nTitle: ADDENDUM: The More Important Training and\nDevelopment is to a Person, the More Likely They Will be a\nTeam Player With their Coworkers and a Better Employee to\nthe University\nThe Committee on Human Research has considered the\nabove application and, on the basis of available evidence,\nrecords its opinions as follows:\n1.
