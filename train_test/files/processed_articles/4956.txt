DI is often\noperationalized as fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a composite measure of an individual's\ndeviations from symmetry in traits that are symmetrical at the population level, without\nregard to side (Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill, 2001). Interest in DI stems in part from\nthe wide range of studies demonstrating that humans with greater FA may show reduced\nfecundity, health, social dominance, and mating success (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000;\nMurphy, and Rhodes, 2002). However, there is substantial variability in the strengths of\nassociations across studies, and reasons for inconsistencies are poorly understood.\nTo date, greater FA has been reported in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders\n(e.g., Edgar et al., 2006; Yeo, Gangestad, and Thoma, 2007) and has also been linked in\nhumans with traits such as intelligence, jealousy, and physical violence (Kowner, 2001).\nMore specifically, individuals with greater FA have been reported to show relatively lower\ngeneral intellectual functioning (Bates, 2007; Furlow, Armijo-Prewitt, Gangestad, and\nGangestad, Halgren, Sanchez, and Lewine, 2005; though see also Johnson, Segal, and\nBouchard, 2008) and to express more jealousy in mating situations (Brown and Moore,\n2003). Furthermore, greater FA predicts fewer self-reported lifetime sexual partners\n(Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill, 2001) and fewer episodes of physical violence\n(Furlow, Gangestad, and Armijo-Prewitt, 1998).\nGiven these behavioral correlates, one would expect FA to vary systematically with\naspects of brain anatomy and/or physiology. Identifying specific neural correlates of FA\nwould facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms linking the genetic and\nenvironmental determinants of FA with individual differences in behavior. To date, studies\nlinking neural variation with FA in humans are sparse. In general, FA appears to be\nassociated with atypical functional lateralization of the human brain (Thoma, Yeo,\nGangestad, Lewine, and Davis, 2000; Yeo, Gangestad, Thoma, Shaw, and Repa, 1997). In\naddition, we previously reported a positive relationship between skeletal FA and a\ncomposite measure of asymmetries of gray matter, white matter, and planum temporale\nHowever, we did not find any significant relationships between measures of brain volumes\n(total brain, gray matter, or white matter) and FA in either of these studies. Consistent with\nthese results, Furlow et al. (1997) found no relationship between head circumference and\nFA. Further, although FA, gray matter, and total brain volumes individually predict\nintellectual ability, we have found that these volumes as assessed from MRI scans do not\nmediate the FA-intelligence relationship (Thoma et al., 2005). However, Bates (2007)\nrecently reported that skull size, which is correlated with brain volume, did mediate the\nrelationship between intelligence and FA.\nIn the current study, we examined the neuroanatomic correlates of FA using voxel-\nbased morphometry (VBM). In contrast to traditional region of interest (ROI) magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) analysis methods, which are spatially limited and labor-intensive,\nFluctuating asymmetry\nVBM allows for a fully automated and objective assessment of variations in regional\ncortical volume, on a whole-brain basis. Studies comparing VBM to manual ROI methods\nhave attested to the validity of the former technique, and have even highlighted the\ncomplementarity of the two approaches (Good et al., 2002; Giuliani, Calhoun, Pearlson,\nFrancis, and Buchanan, 2005). As well as quantifying between-group differences in brain\nvolume, VBM has also been used to highlight the relationship between local changes in\ncortical tissue and measures of cognitive performance (Haier, Jung, Yeo, Head, and Alkire,\n2004), disease severity and heterogeneity (Koutsouleris, Gaser, Jager, et al., 2008), and\ndemographics (Smith, Chebrolu, Weckstein, Schmitt, and Markesbery, 2007). Here, we\nemployed VBM to explore the relationship between variations in regional cortical gray and\nwhite matter volumes and measured of, in a sample of neurologically intact adults. VBM is\nespecially well suited for exploring the neural correlates of FA. The wide range of\nbehavioral associations of FA does not suggest the central importance of any single brain\nregion. Rather, numerous brain regions could possibly be related to FA, rendering the ROI\napproach inadequate. In this study, we used VBM to investigate whether specific regions of\ncortical gray matter and underlying white matter are correlated with FA.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwenty normal participants (13 male, 7 female) were recruited through ads in the\nlocal media. Participants were adults ranging in age from 26 to 62 (see Table 1); one\nfemale and two male participants were left-handed. None had a history of head injury,\nneurological disorder, or unstable medical illness. All participants were screened with the\nStructured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders, Clinician Version (SCID-CV;\nFirst, Spitzer, Gibbon, and Williams, 1996). Individuals with a history of alcohol or other\nsubstance abuse in the three months preceding the study were excluded, as were individuals\nwho demonstrated any history of either marijuana or cocaine dependence.\nFA Measurement\nFA measures reflect deviation from perfect symmetry in bilateral features that,\nacross the relevant population, are typically symmetrical. Alternatively, directional\nasymmetries (DA) occur in features for which a population of organisms shows a\nconsistent structural or functional bias for a particular side of the body. Examples of\ndirectional asymmetry in humans include the placement of the heart and number of lobes in\nthe right versus the left lung. Skeletal FA was assessed in 20 participants using calipers\nacross the feet, ankles, elbows, wrists, and hands. The length and width of each ear and the\nlength of the first four fingers were also measured. Each of these measures was conducted\ntwice to increase reliability, and the mean of the two measurements was calculated and\nused as the feature size for calculation of FA. Of the seven body parts measured, only hand\nwidth was determined to be directionally asymmetric; it was excluded from the present\nanalyses. FA for individual traits was calculated by taking the absolute value of the\ndifference between left and right sides, divided by one-half times the sum of left plus right\nsides {individual FA = |R-L| / [.5 x (R+L)]}. FA scores for the ten remaining measurements\nwere summed to derive a total FA score for each subject.\nImage Acquisition\nFluctuating asymmetry\nFor each subject, high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MR images were acquired with a\n1.5 T Picker Edge Imager at the VA Functional Neuroimaging Center, using a Field Echo\nVoxel Based Morphometry\nAll image analysis was performed using and SPM2\n(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running in MATLAB version 6.5. The fundamental\nprinciples behind VBM have previously been introduced by Ashburner and Friston (2000).\nFirst, MR images were manually aligned to a common space in SPM based on the locations\nof the anterior and posterior commissures. VBM procedures followed the \"optimized\nVBM\" protocol as described by Good et al. (2001), including creation of study-specific\ngray and white matter templates. This involved spatially normalizing each study image to\nthe generic T1 template within SPM using an affine transformation and non-linear basis\nfunctions, and segmenting the resulting images into gray matter, white matter, and csf\nbased on voxel intensity values and a priori information about brain tissue distribution. The\nobtained normalization parameters were then recursively applied to the original images in\nnative space to achieve optimal normalization and segmentation. Optimally segmented gray\nand white matter images were then averaged to obtain study-specific templates which were\nsmoothed via convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 8mm full width half-maximum\nTo achieve optimal segmentation of the individual study images, the above\nrecursive procedure was performed where each image was initially segmented and\nnormalized to their respective gray or white matter template. Again, the normalization\nparameters obtained from this segmentation and warping were applied to the original study-\nimages in native space, and the resulting optimally normalized images underwent final\nsegmentation into gray matter, white matter, and CSF. Next, the \"modulation\" step was\nperformed to correct for erroneous volume changes introduced during spatial\nnormalization. The resulting gray and white matter probability maps were then smoothed\nwith a kernel of 12 mm FWHM, giving the analysis a resolution of approximately 12mm\nspatial scale for regions significantly associated with FA based on the Matched Filter\nStatistical analyses were conducted using the multiple regression model in SPM2.\nIndividual FA values were the variable of interest, whereby FA scores were tested on a\nvoxel-by-voxel basis for significant positive or negative association with regional gray and\nwhite matter volumes. Additionally, age, sex, and raw gray/white matter volumes were\ntreated as covariates of no interest (i.e., nuisance variables) in the analyses. For all\nanalyses, contrasts were defined to test for clusters of voxels of brain tissue that were\npositively or negatively associated with FA. Clusters of voxels were considered significant\nat p < 0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), and additionally thresholded for\ndisplay at using a minimum of 100 contiguous voxels. For each significant cluster, spatial\ncoordinates were entered into the xjView image viewing program\n(http://people.hnl.bcm.tmc.edu/cuixu/xjView/) program to determine its approximate\nanatomical locus (Cui, Jeter, Yang, Montague, and Eagleman, 2007). Importantly, as the\ncurrent study utilized a study-specific template and is hence in unique study-specific space,\nFluctuating asymmetry\nthe reported x, y, z coordinates and associated regions only approximate their\ncorresponding regions in Talairach space.\nResults\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics on age, FA, and tissue compartment volumes.\nPartial correlations, controlling for age and sex, were obtained for relationships between\nsegmented overall tissue volumes and FA. We found a significant correlation between total\nFA and white matter volume (r = .53, p = .025) and a trend toward a significant\nrelationship between FA and total gray matter volume (r = .43, p = .079). A total of eight\nVBM analyses were performed. In the first four, VBM analyses examined positive and\nnegative relationships of FA with gray and white matter volumes, and age and sex were\ntreated as covariates. The second four analyses added another covariate, either total gray\nmatter volume for the gray matter analyses or total white matter volume for the white\nmatter analyses. As our results below suggest, treating total tissue volume as a covariate\nreduces statistical power for detecting significantly increased or decreased regions related\nto FA, yet serves to highlight those regions which are most strongly linked to FA.\nTable 1.

In contrast, no gray matter regions and\nvery few white matter regions showed negative covariation with FA. Prior to discussing the\nimplications of these results, several methodological issues should be considered. First, in\ntwo prior studies (Thoma et al., 2002; Thoma et al., 2005) with small samples using a\ndifferent, operator-defined segmentation analysis, we found no significant univariate\ncorrelations between overall gray matter or white matter volumes and FA. In contrast, the\ncurrent study found a significant positive correlation between total white matter volume\nand FA and a trend in the same direction for gray matter. Given that the current sample was\nsomewhat older and had slightly greater FA than our prior samples, these differences across\nstudies could reflect either methodological or sampling variance, or both. Second, FA\nmeasures are known to be imperfectly related to the latent variable of interest,\ndevelopmental instability. A biometric analysis of FA (Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill,\n2001) demonstrated that a composite measure, such as was used in the present study, has a\nvalidity coefficient of approximately .68 (see also Prokosch, Yeo, and Miller, 2005). Thus,\nthe true magnitude of FA-brain relationships in the current sample is underestimated unless\none corrects for attenuation, which we have not done and replication of the current findings\nis necessary in a larger sample.\nThird, the current results must be understood within the context of the multiple\ncomparison issue. The growing VBM literature is characterized by diverse approaches to\ncorrecting for multiple comparisons. The number of statistical comparisons made is not\nactually the total number of voxels (1,844,677 in the current study), but rather the number\nof \"resels\" (910 in the current study). Many investigators (e.g., Rotzer, Kutzian, Martin,\nvon Aster, Klaver, and Loenneker, 2008) have adopted a p < .001 criterion for each\nindividual cluster, foregoing any formal correction, and this criterion is most commonly\nused in studies with relatively small samples such as ours. Others have simply used a\nBonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (e.g., Haier et al., 2004), though this\nFluctuating asymmetry\nmethod adversely impacts statistical power. Given our reliance upon the less conservative\napproach, the current results should be considered preliminary.\nOur results indicate that gray and white matter regions linked with FA were not\nrandomly scattered throughout the cortex. Rather, significant clusters were more apt to be\nfound in the frontal lobes and in the right cerebral hemisphere. Thus, although the frontal\nlobes comprise only about one third of total brain volume, 62% of gray matter voxels\ndescribed in Table 2 and 53% of the white matter voxels described in Table 3 were from\nthe frontal lobes. Similarly, 67% of these same gray matter voxels were in the right\nhemisphere, as were 60% of the white matter voxels. Notably absent were any voxels from\nthe occipital lobes. Very few voxels were identified in left-hemisphere peri-sylvian regions\nassociated with language functioning. The regional specificity of these results demonstrates\nthe advantage of VBM over simple correlational analyses of total tissue compartment\nvolumes.\nWhy would FA be related to greater gray and white matter volumes? As distinct\nmaturational processes contribute to variation in volume at different ages, developmental\nstudies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed neuroanatomic\nvariation. In general, gray matter volume increases during gestation and early childhood\nand decreases during adolescence and early adulthood, whereas white matter volume tends\nto show a linear increase over this time frame (Toga, Thompson, and Sowell, 2006).\nGreater gray matter volume could reflect more robust early neurogenesis or less robust\ndevelopmental pruning. It is well established that early brain growth increases head\ncircumference; however, since FA is not associated with greater brain circumference\n(Furlow et al., 1997), it appears that a reduced rate of pruning may be the more likely\nprocess. Interestingly, recent data suggests that gray matter pruning may be under the\ncontrol of the innate immune system (Stevens et al., 2007), perhaps providing a link to\nobservations of greater rates of certain types of infection in individuals with higher FA\nAs mentioned above, FA has been previously linked with a variety of behavioral\ntraits in humans. Unfortunately, in this study we were not able to evaluate potential\nrelationships between anatomic variations and behavioral traits. The identified sites are\ninvolved in distributed neural circuits underlying a diverse set of functions; moreover, they\nlikely comprise only one component of the total set of brain variables linked with FA, such\nas atypical laterality (Yeo et al., 1997) and variation in neurometabolite concentrations\n(Yeo, Hill, Campbell, Vigil, and Brooks, 2000). Nonetheless, the identified regions\nrepresent possible substrates for FA-related behavioral variation. For example, one site\nprominently linked with FA in our VBM analysis was the right dorsolateral frontal region.\nZaatari and Trivers (2007) reported that low FA individuals are less likely to make \"fair\"\noffers in the ultimatum game. Right frontal fMRI activation occurs during performance of\nthis game (Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, and Cohen, 2003) and transcranial magnetic\nstimulation of this same region, creating a \"temporary lesion,\" specifically diminished\nbehaviors reflecting reciprocal fairness (Knoch, Pascual-Leone, Meyer, Treyer, and Fehr,\n2006). Hence, gray and white matter variation in the right dorsolateral frontal region may\nbe related to behavioral variation linked with FA in the ultimatum game.\nFurther research is needed to better understand how developmental instability may\nintroduce variability into an otherwise \"normal\" course of brain development. The current\ndata demonstrate that FA is significantly related to variation in gray matter regions and the\nFluctuating asymmetry\nwhite matter that connects them. Linking this cortical variability with individual differences\nin behavioral and psychological factors remains to be done in a larger sample. Assessment\nof these variables in a longitudinal developmental study would optimally address this issue.\nInvestigation of the role of FA in cortical variability in subjects with developmental\ndisorders may also further our understanding of the contribution of DI to abnormal\nneurodevelopment and psychopathology.\nReferences\nAshburner, J. and Friston, K.J.
