Older adults (aged 55-74 years) had a twofold greater prevalence of high\nBP than younger adults (25--54 years), and older black persons had the highest rates. Isolated systolic\nelevation was uncommon under 54 years of age, but occurred in 5% to 10% of adults over 55 years and\nwas less common than systolic-diastolic elevation. In older adults, body mass (weight/height ) had the\nstrongest relationship to BPof all the nutritional variables. Alcohol consumption and dietary calcium\nand phosphorus were associated with high BP, but dietary sodium and salt use were not. The serum\ncalcium/phosphorus ratio and serum urate were significantly higher in older adults with high BP. In\ngeneral, the variables associated with elevated BP in older adults were similar to those in younger\nadults, although the strengths of the associations differed. Associations of factors useful for nonphar-\nmacologic prevention and management of high BP in older persons were suggested from this survey.\nKEY WORDS \u00b7 calcium \u00b7 body mass index \u00b7 sodium alcohol\nHIGH blood pressure (BP) is a common and\nimportant problem in older Americans, but\nrelatively few data are available regarding its\nprevalence and related demographic and nutritional\nfactors. High BP in older persons carries an increased\nrisk of mortality and morbidity from cerebrovascular,\ncardiovascular, and renal involvement.1-2 In clinical\ntrials, successful lowering of BP in older persons has\nbeen accompanied by a favorable change in mortal-\nity.3-4 A recent symposium3 highlighted the important\nrole of nutrition in BP regulation and indicated its\npotential use in preventing and managing high BP.\nDespite these important health implications, there is\nrelatively little information in older persons about fac-\ntors correlating with BP that could lead to rational\ndevelopment of life-style interventions. Yet, nutrition-\nal interventions are particularly important in older indi-\nviduals because drug therapy is associated with greater\nuntoward effects than in younger persons.

Because a broad range of nutritional, clinical,\nand biochemical variables were measured, it has been\npossible to explore their joint relationships to BP. Uni-\nvariate and covariate adjusted associations between BP\nand nutritional variables have been presented in a de-\ntailed report6 for adults aged 18 to 74 years. Our focus\nhere is on a comparison between older adults and\nyounger adults. To take into account the complex in-\nteractions among nutritional variables, we used multi-\nvariable analyses to adjust for the effects of important\nnonnutritional variables.\nPopulation and Methods\non a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population with respect to sex, race, age, socio-\neconomic status, geographic region, and urban-rural\nresidence.7 Because of special interest in the health and\nnutrition of selected subgroups, there was deliberate\noversampling of lower socioeconomic groups, older\ncitizens, black persons, and pregnant women. The\nyears, who represented an overall response rate of 74%\nof those selected for the sample. Prevalence data on BP\nand dietary intake utilize data from this survey. In\naddition to this general survey, a representative sub-\nsample of adults aged 25 to 74 years received special\nquestionnaires and examinations of the cardiovascular,\npulmonary, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as\nadditional clinical biochemistry determinations. This\nsubsample of 3854 persons is referred to as the detailed\nsample and is used to examine BP correlates and to\ndevelop predictive models of BP because of the avail-\nability of biochemical measurements.\nThe survey was conducted in mobile examination\nunits at locations of the sampled populations. Exami-\nnations were performed by specially trained teams of\nphysicians, nurses, and technicians who used a stan-\ndard manual of operations. Dietary intake was deter-\nmined through 24-hour dietary recall and 3-month\nfood frequency records. A computer program was used\nto determine nutrient values of food consumed. Partici-\npants aged 12 to 74 years completed a medical history\nquestionnaire, which requested information on health\nhabits, general medical status, and known disease con-\nditions and medical treatments.\nThe BP was recorded in the sitting position near the\nbeginning of the examination, according to recom-\nmendations of the American Heart Association. A cuff\nwas selected that was at least 20% wider than the\ndiameter of the arm, and adult (13 cm) and pediatric\n(9.5 cm) cuffs were available to examiners. The cuff\nwas deflated at a rate to 2 mm Hg per heartbeat, and\nreadings were made to the nearest 2 mm interval on the\nscale. Diastolic pressure was taken on cessation of\nKorotkoff sounds (Phase V) unless there was no loss of\nsounds, in which case, the point of muffling (fourth\nphase) was used as diastolic pressure. If the latter situ-\nation obtained, this was recorded. Three determina-\ntions of BP were made on subjects in the detailed\nsample, but for this analysis we have reported only the\nfirst sitting BP measurements. Although we have not\ninvestigated the variation among multiple BP readings\nseparately for the older age group, we have reported6\nan extensive comparison of single and paired BP read-\nings for the detailed and augmented survey groups\nacross all ages. These analyses indicated that the initial\nand subsequent BP measurements yielded essentially\nthe same means and marginal distributions of catego-\nrized pressures. Body measurements, including\nheight, weight, and skinfold thickness, were made by\nspecially trained examiners who used equipment de-\nsigned for the study that was checked weekly and be-\nfore each examination series.7\nAll respondents underwent laboratory assessments\nthat included hematologic examinations and nutrition-\nal biochemistries on serum and urine specimens. On\nthe detailed sample only, the following serum bio-\nchemistries were performed: total bilirubin, aspartate\naminotransferase (formerly serum glutamic oxaloace-\ntic transaminase or SGOT), alkaline phosphatase, cal-\ncium, phosphorus, and uric acid.8\nAll analyses were performed by statistical proce-\ndures that incorporated the sample weights and the\ncomplex design effects.9 Consequently, the results re-\nported here can be extrapolated to the target U.S. pop-\nulation. Because dietary and drug treatments for ele-\nvated BP might alter the prevalence estimates or\ninterrelationships among BP and other variables, indi-\nviduals reporting therapy were considered separately\nin the analysis. For prevalence estimates, treated indi-\nviduals were classified as having hypertension regard-\nless of the pressure recorded in the survey. In univar-\niate and multivariate analyses, treated persons were\nincluded or excluded from analysis.6 There were no\nmajor changes in the relationships when treated indi-\nviduals were included, and the analyses in this report\ninclude treated individuals.\nSeveral analytical approaches were used to investi-\ngate the relationships between BP and other variables.\nFirst, BPs were used as continuous dependent varia-\nbles in multiple regression models. Then, three clinical\ncategories of BP were made: 1) systolic-diastolic high\nisolated systolic high BP (greater than 160 and less\nthan 90 mm Hg); and 3) normal BP (remainder). The\nweighted mean values for key variables were among\nthese three subgroups investigated by analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) tests. Older adults (aged 55-74 years)\nwere contrasted to younger adults (aged 25-54 years)\nby use of multivariable models and clinical categoriza-\ntion of BP. Statistical significance was determined for\nall these methods with use of the sample weights and\nthe design effects.9 Both biological and statistical con-\nsiderations led us to separate the groups at 55 years of\nage. After this age, the mean diastolic BP for men\nplateaus, rather than increases, and the prevalence of\nisolated systolic high BP becomes important.l0 Of less-\ner importance was the restricted sample sizes available\nfor analysis, particularly when race-sex separations\nwere made for each decade. Sample sizes for each\ndecade and contingency tables for the variables ana-\nlyzed have been provided in a detailed report.6\nResults\nThe prevalence of systolic-diastolic BP elevation\nand isolated systolic BP elevation are presented in Fig-\nure 1 for male and female and white and black sub-\njects. The prevalence rate increased with age for sys-\ntolic-diastolic high BP, and 30% or more of the older\nadults had elevated pressures. At all ages after 25\nyears, black persons had the higher rates. Systolic-\ndiastolic BP elevation was more common in young\nmales than females during younger adult years, but at\n65 to 74 years of age, females had a higher prevalence\nof high BP. All differences were statistically signifi-\ncant, although the large sample sizes vitiated conven-\ntional use of statistical comparisons, because even\nsmaller, and potentially unimportant, differences may\nhave been significant.\nZ\no\nFIGURE I. Prevalence of systolic-diastolic and isolated systolic high blood pressure bv sex and race in the\nUnited States population, 1971-1974 (National Health and Nutrition   I).\nIsolated systolic BP was uncommon in subjects un-\nder 55 years of age, but was present with increasing\nfrequency after this age. The prevalence was highest in\nwomen, and there were no major differences between\nblack and white groups. In subjects over 55 years, the\nprevalence of systolic-diastolic BP elevation was\nabout 2.5 times greater than isolated systolic BP\nelevation.\nMultiple regression models were used to investigate\nthe joint relationship between variables found to be\nstatistically significant singly with either systolic or\ndiastolic BP in order to assess the relative importance\nof these independent relationships.6 Prediction models\nwere developed for men (Table 1) and women (Table\n2). Older persons (55-74 years) were contrasted with\nyounger persons (25-54 years). With this analytical\nprocedure we selected first the independent variable\nhaving the strongest association with the dependent\nvariable and thereafter selected the independent varia-\nbles only if they provided increments significant to the\nexplanation of the residual variance in the dependent\nvariable. Variable selection was terminated when no\nadditional variable had a significance level less than\n0.05. The variables are listed in the forward stepping\norder in which they were selected for the final model.\nStandardized beta weights are given so that the relative\ncontribution made by each independent variable in the\nmodel can be observed.\nAlthough the population was grouped by age, the\nfirst variable selected was generally age, except for\ndiastolic BP in older men and women. The decreased\nassociation between age and diastolic pressure reflect-\ned the trends found in older persons. In men, it has\nbeen found\" that the diastolic BP plateaus or declines\nafter 55 years and it increases only gradually in women\nafter this age. We selected body mass index (weight/\nheight2) as the first or second independent variable for\nall groups except systolic BP in older women. We\nfound that skinfold thickness, which is a measure of\nsubcutaneous fat thickness, added little to the predic-\ntion of high BP except in young males. Pulse rate was\ndirectly related to systolic BP at all ages, but was less\nstrongly related to diastolic BP in young adults. Socio-\neconomic status (SES) was inversely related to diastol-\nic BP in older and younger men, but not in women,\nwho were not greatly represented in the work force at\nReported dietary intake and serum biochemistries\nmade significant, but often inconsistent, contributions\nto the explanation of BP variance. Alcohol intake had a\ncurvilinear relationship with BP; heavy alcohol con-\nsumers had the highest pressures, while moderate con-\nsumers had the lowest pressures, and abstainers,\nslightly higher pressures.6 SGOT was selected as a\npredictor of BP in the younger groups and may be a\nsurrogate for heavy alcohol intake.

Dietary calcium and phosphorus intake\nwere inconsistently related to BP. On the other hand,\nserum calcium and phosphate were frequently related\nto systolic and diastolic BP in younger adults. The\nrelationship was direct for serum calcium and inverse\nfor serum phosphate, that is, higher serum calcium and\nlower serum phosphate were associated with higher\nBP. When the Ca/P ratio was used in the analyses, it\nproved to have a more consistent relationship.6 Serum\ncholesterol was inversely related to BP in older women\nonly. Serum uric acid was directly related to BP, but\nthis variable was not consistently selected. Similarly,\nhemoglobin concentration was selected in younger\nadults, but in older men it was related to diastolic BP.\nRelevant variables in older and younger adults were\ncontrasted for the BP categories (Table 3). The cutoff\nBP levels of the prevalence studies (Figure 1) were\nused to define the three groups. Because isolated sys-\ntolic high BP was not common in younger persons, this\nclassification was omitted for this group. The variables\nwere separated into nutritional (and pulse rate) varia-\nbles and serum biochemistries because the data dif-\nfered in relation to separate subsurvey populations, the\ngeneral survey (nutritional), the detailed survey (se-\nrum biochemistries), and the number of examinees.\nHowever, the findings for each category were repre-\nsentative of the U.S. population. The findings general-\nly confirmed those obtained when systolic and diastol-\nic BPs were treated as continuous variables in the\nmultiple regression models. However, comparison of\nthe mean values across the BP categories did not take\ninto account the confounding and interaction among\nthe independent variables. Two sets of contrasts were\nevaluated statistically. The mean values across the BP\ncategories were contrasted within each group of older\nand younger adults (the column entitled \"ANOVA\nP\"). Most differences were significant, which indicat-\ned that the means were significantly different among\nBP categories within the older adult or younger adult\ngroups. The BP categories, normal and systolic-dia-\nstolic high BP, were contrasted across older and\nyounger groups, and significant differences have been\nnoted with an asterisk.\nThis permitted older adults with normal BP to be\ncompared to younger adults with normal BP, and like-\nwise for systolic-diastolic high BP. Within older and\nyounger adult groups, significant differences between\nnormal and high BP were found for all listed variables,\nexcept dietary phosphorous in young adults and serum\ncholesterol in older adults.\nWhen older and younger adults with normal BP\nwere compared (Table 3), there were statistically sig-\nnificant differences in most of the nutritional variables,\nalthough the differences in mean values were small.\nThese differences reflected changing nutritional status\nand dietary intake in older persons or possibly a cohort\nPressure\nComparison of Mean Values for Nutritional and Biochemical Variables for Older and Younger Adults with Normal or High Blood\nVariable\nNutritional variables\nNumber\nBody mass index (kg/m2)\nSkinfolds (mm)\nPulse rate (bpm)\nDietary calcium\nDietary phosphorus\nScrum biochemistry variables\nNumber\nCalcium/phosphorus\nSerum aspartate amino-\ntransferase (unit/dl)\nPhosphate (mg/dl)\nUrate (mg/dl)\nCholesterol (mg/dl)\nNormal\nBP\nOlder adults\nSys-dias\nhigh BP\nIsol sys\nhigh BP\nANOVA\nP\nNS\nYounger\nNormal\nBP\nSys-dias\nhigh BP\nyears)\nANOVA\nP\nNS\n\u00b7Significant difference (p = 0.05 or less) in mean values between comparable blood pressure category for older and younger adults.\neffect, namely, such that the older persons had differ-\nent dietary patterns that persisted to later life. Similar-\nly, the differences in nutritional varibles between older\nand younger persons with systolic-diastolic high BP\nwere small but significant, except for pulse rate. With\nrespect to serum biochemistries, there were fewer dif-\nferences between comparable BP categories of older\nand younger adults. Calcium/phosphorous and SGOT\nwere not significantly different. For serum phosphate\nand urate, there were age group differences in the nor-\nmal BP group, but not in the high BP group.\nOlder adults with isolated systolic high BP had char-\nacteristics similar to older adults with systolic-diastolic\nhigh BP except for ethanol ingestion, SGOT, serum\nphosphate, and serum calcium/phosphate. The means\nof these variables for the isolated systolic high BP\ngroup were not significantly different from those in the\ngroup with normal BP.\nDiscussion\nThis national survey provides a useful and unique\nprofile of the BP of a representative sample of older\nAmericans and, specifically, permits comparison of\nnutritional relationships in older and younger persons.\nThe survey includes noninstitutionalized older people\naged 55 to 74 years, a population group that often visits\nphysicians and hospitals for symptomatic problems but\ninfrequently is the subject of population studies. The\nsampling and analytical approaches make the observa-\ntions representative of the adult United States popula-\ntion with respect to demographic variables, such as\nage, sex, race, socioeconomic status, urban/rural resi-\ndence, and geographic region. Therefore, the preva-\nlence rates for high BP and the correlates for systolic\nand diastolic BP can be assumed to represent contem-\nporary characteristics of the United States population.\nThe age limit for NHANES was 74 years, and, there-\nfore, the oldest segment of the population and those\ninstitutionalized were not surveyed.\nHigh BP is common in older adults; the prevalence\nof systolic-diastolic BP elevation is higher at succes-\nsively older ages through 74 years of age (Figure 1).\nThe only exceptions are a slight decline in men and in\nblack persons aged 65 to 74 years. The racial differ-\nences in the rates of high BP are most striking in older\nadults, although present in younger adults. Interesting-\nly, these racial differences are not found in similar\nsurveys of adolescents. '2 The prevalence of high BP is\napproximately the same in black and white persons\nfrom childhood through 25 years of age, but thereafter,\nthe prevalence of systolic-diastolic high BP increases\nrapidly in black persons. The rate for blacks over age\n55 years is l'/2 to 2 times the rate in whites. This\nimpressive racial difference cannot be explained by\ndifferences in measured nutritional or physiologic\ncharacteristics, but may relate either to other unmeas-\nured environmental features or to genetic differences,\nor to an interaction between them.\nIsolated systolic high BP (greater than 160 mm Hg\nsystolic, less than 90 mm Hg diastolic) is infrequent\nuntil 55 years of age; then the prevalence reaches 10%\nmore common in women than men, but there are no\nimportant black-white differences. Although there is\nconsiderable interest in this entity, the national preva-\nlence data indicate that this situation is found consider-\nably less frequently than systolic-diastolic BP eleva-\ntion13- '4 through age 74 years. Systolic BP determines\nthe risk for subsequent mortality and morbidity as well\nor better than diastolic BP, but the benefits of treating\nisolated systolic hypertension have not been defined in\na clinical trial as they have for diastolic hypertension.l5\nThe variables associated with isolated systolic high BP\nare similar to those related to systolic-diastolic high BP\n(Table 3) except for the lesser alcohol consumption,\nlower serum calcium-phosphorous ratio, and higher\nserum cholesterol. These observations provide some\nhelp in delineating isolated systolic BP elevation as an\nepidemiologically distinct entity, but further informa-\ntion on differential prognosis and responses to therapy\nwould be helpful in this regard.\nThese prevalence rates should be interpreted with an\nappreciation for the variability of BP levels and the\npotential misclassification if a BP measurement from a\nsingle examination is used for diagnosis. Because hy-\npertension is defined as a persistent elevation of BP\nrecorded on several occasions over a period of weeks\nto months, we have chosen to use the term \"High BP\"\nrather than \"hypertension\" when categorizing the sur-\nvey data. When we selected the cutoff levels for high\nBP we considered the differential variability of systolic\nand diastolic BP. Systolic BP is generally more vari-\nable than diastolic, and the cutoff point was set at 160\nmm Hg.13 The cutoff point for diastolic was set at 90\nmm Hg, because of the lesser variability of this pres-\nsure and the demonstrated benefits of treatment of\npressures above this level. The prevalence rates for\n\"high BP\" are affected by the cutpoints selected and\nby regression toward the mean. In this latter case,\ninitially high BP levels tend to be lower on repeat\nmeasurement. Modest overestimates of the prevalence\nof high BP may result, therefore, from surveys. These\noverestimates may be greater in older persons who\nhave greater day-to-day variability in BP, especially\nsystolic BP.\nHowever, the relationships between high BP and\nother variables were not altered in these analyses by\nchanging the cutoff level. When systolic and diastolic\nBPs were analyzed as continuous variables in the mul-\ntiple regression models (Tables 1 and 2), the associ-\nations were the same as when the BP categories were\nused (Table 3). The multiple regression model tested\nfor correlations throughout the entire range of BP val-\nues and was not influenced by the cutoff levels. More-\nover, in these multiple regression models, variables\nwere selected only if they made independent contribu-\ntions to the prediction of BP not made by previously\nselected variables. Categorical analyses were used to\ncomplement the regression model by placing the ob-\nservations in a clinical context and by indicating the\nmagnitude of difference in the variables associated\nwith selected BP categories.\nIn general, factors selected in the regression models\nwere also significantly related to high BP levels, and\nthe two approaches to the analyses were concordant.\nThe variables related to systolic and diastolic BP levels\nin older adults (55-74 years of age) were similar to\nthose in younger adults (25--54 years of age). Howev-\ner, the explanation of BP variance was less for older\nadults; the variance explained (r2) ranged from 0.08 to\nyounger group. Age and body mass were the most\nimportant determinants of BP levels. Even within the\ntwo broad age groups developed for this analysis, age\nremained an important correlate for systolic BP but not\nfor diastolic BP in older men or women. This reflected\nthe trend of systolic BP to increase throughout adult\nlife and diastolic BP to plateau or decline.\"\nAnother important correlate of BP was adiposity or\nbody mass, and several lines of evidence10 have sug-\ngested that age and body mass have independent,\nthought potentially confounding, effects on BP. Body\nmass index (weight/height2) was directly related to BP\nand was the strongest nutritional correlate selected in\nall comparisons except for systolic BP in older men.\nThis variable provides a crude assessment of weight\nfor volume and, in older adults, increased body mass\nprimarily reflects accumulation of adipose tissue. With\naging, the major changes in body mass are increases in\nadipose tissue and losses in muscle mass and bone\ndensity.16 In the United States, adiposity increases\nthrough mid-adulthood and then plateaus for men\nwhile continuing to increase in women.l0 Although this\nis a cross-sectional survey, a similar association be-\ntween body mass changes and BP have been found in a\nlongitudinal study of adult men.l7 This association has\nobvious implications for prevention through weight\nreduction and maintenance of leaness. Because the\nrelationship is similar in older and younger adults, the\nbenefits of having lean body weight in maintaining\nnormal BP should be as great in older adults as in\nyounger adults.\nRelatively few dietary constituents have consistent\nrelationships to BP, and we have presented only those\nwith significant relationships. A complete assessment\nis available.6 These dietary relationships differ some-\nwhat in older persons. The sodium-potassium ratio of\nreported food intake was an important predictor in\nyounger men but not in older men or women (Table 1).\nThis perhaps reflects, in part, the lower mean sodium\nintake of older persons in the United States when com-\npared with the intake in late adolescence and early\nadulthood. In fact, if salt use and BP are correlated\nacross the entire adult age range, the relationship is\ninverse because older individuals have lower reported\nsalt intake and higher BP.6 This survey is cross-sec-\ntional and reflects only current measures of nutritional\nand health status and does not disclose prior dietary\nintake that may have been different or may have acted\nas an initiating but not maintaining agent in the genesis\nof high BP. Moreover, there are problems in reliably\nquantifying even current intake, and population sur-\nveys cannot delilneate a \"salt-sensitive\" segment of\nthe population. Nevertheless, this survey indicates\nthat, within the range of sodium intake of the older\ncontemporary U.S. population, there is no significant\ncorrelation beween sodium or sodium-potassium in-\ntake and BP. Such a relationship can be demonstrated\nin cross-cultural comparisons of populations with\nmarked divergence in salt intake, but rarely within\npopulations with relatively homogeneous salt use.\nA significant, direct relationship is present between\nalcohol consumption and high BP in both older and\nyounger adults, although the reported alcohol con-\nsumption of older persons regardless of BP status is\nless than that for younger persons. The differential in\nalcohol intake between normal and high BP groups is\nsignificantly greater in younger adults, but the rela-\ntionship remains significant in older persons. The ef-\nfect of alcohol on BP is modified by age, but the\nheaviest consumers have high BP regardless of age.\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase levels are consis-\ntently related to systolic and diastolic BP and to BP\ncategories. This relationship may reflect excessive al-\ncohol consumption and its toxic effect on the liver and\nperhaps a pharmacologic effect on BP.\nSerum urate is significantly higher in those with\nhigh BP, and the difference is present in older and\nyounger adults. This association is independent of\nbody mass (or adiposity), although both BP and urate\nlevels relate to body mass.6 A previous study\" has\nsuggested that the elevation of urate found in high BP\nwas related to vascular changes in the kidneys. How-\never, the similar findings in older and younger men\nargue against this explanation, since higher urate lev-\nels would be expected in older persons who have more\nextensive vascular disease.18\nProvocative relationships are present between BP\nand serum levels of calcium and phosphorous. Serum\ncalcium was directly related and serum phosphorous\ninversely related to systolic and diastolic BP. The most\npedictive variable was the serum calcium/phosphorous\nratio, which combined the independent relationships\nof each. No significant differences were found be-\ntween older and younger groups in comparable hyper-\ntensive categories. These findings agree with those of\nother epidemiological studies of non-U.S. popula-\ntions. In Belgian military personnel (mean age, 39 \u00b1\n11.5 years), Kesteloot and Geboers19 found serum and\nurinary calcium levels to be significantly and inde-\npendently related to BP. Other studies20 2I have con-\nfirmed the direct relationships to serum calcium.\nMoreover, serum phosphorous has been found to be\ninversely related to BP in a survey of Swedish men\naged 49 to 50 years, although no relationship was\nfound for serum calcium.22 Thus, studies of other pop-\nulations support the relationships found in the U.S.\nsurvey, but these findings are counter to studies in\nanimals and selected patient groups. In the spontane-\nously hypertensive rat, low serum calcium is associat-\ned with higher pressures, and calcium feeding lowers\nlower serum calcium and a decrease in the ionized\nfraction in hypertensive patients. Reasons for these\ndiscordant findings are not apparent, but they may\nrelate to dietary preparation and patient selection. Prior\ntherapy with thiazide diuretics is apparently not re-\nsponsible.\nIn contrast to the conflicting human and animal data\non serum calcium, there is general agreement that cal-\ncium intake is lower in those with elevated BP. This\nNHANES-1 analysis, a survey of Puerto Ricans,26 and\nthe findings of McCarron et al.23 indicate a significant-\nly lower dietary calcium intake in persons with high\nBP. It is not clear why the directional effects of dietary\nintake and serum levels are contrary to each other, and\nhow survey findings may relate to physiologic regula-\ntion of BPby calcium and phosphorous. Several expla-\nnations are possible. First, there may be a direct effect\nof calcium and phosphorous on vascular tone, and such\na direct action has been demonstrated in physiologic\nstudies. Cellular calcium flux is linked to membrane\nstability and vascular tone, and it has been suggested27\nthat calcium can increase vascular resistance by mod-\nerating the interaction between calcium and sodium\nfluxes. The relatively small differences in dietary and\nserum calcium and their contrary effects would argue\nagainst a direct relationship to cellular fluxes in BP.\nA second possibility is that a hormonal response\ncould explain the countervailing relationships of di-\netary and serum levels and secondarily influence BP.\nA third possibility is that the measured calcium levels\nin diet and blood reflect the action or interaction with\nother divalent cations. Lead and magnesium are possi-\nble candidates. Magnesium was measured in this sur-\nvey and had no consistent relationship to BP.6 Lead has\na direct effect on BP in toxic amounts and the appropri-\nate interactions with dietary and serum calcium, but\nblood lead was not measured in NHANES-I. The\nmechanism of serum calcium effect on BP cannot be\nresolved by a survey approach. Nevertheless, the clini-\ncal implications of the calcium/phosphorous relation-\nship and BP are of particular interest because of the\nlowering effect of nifedipine on BP, which is a cal-\ncium-entry-blocking agent.2* This affords further epi-\ndemiologic support for the relationship between cal-\ncium and hypertension, but does not afford further\nleads about the mechanism underlying this relation-\nship.\nThese analyses have focused on contrasts between\nolder and younger adults with respect to sociodemo-\ngraphic and nutritional variables related to BP. The\npathogenesis of BP may differ considerably between\nolder and younger groups, and many of the aspects on\nwhich they differ were not measured in this survey,\nwhich had a primary focus on nutritional and clinical\nfeatures. For example, the relative importance of reno-\nvascular hypertension in older individuals was not as-\nsessed in NHANES-I nor was the contribution of ar-\nterial rigidity to elevation of systolic BP in older\npersons. Therefore, while the analyses indicate simi-\nlarities between older and younger adults in the nutri-\ntional correlates to systolic and diastolic BP, there may\nbe differences in physiologic and biochemical param-\neters that were not (and cannot be) assessed in a large\nnational survey.\nThis survey establishes a useful perspective on po-\ntential approaches to the prevention and management\nof high BP in older individuals. Nutritional factors are\nimportant and, in general, are similar to those in\nyounger adults. Excessive weight has as prominent an\ninfluence on BP in older adults as in younger adults or\nadolescents. Because of the parallel age trends in adi-\nposity and BP, much of the increasing incidence of\nhypertension at older ages, particularly in women,\nmight be ascribed to weight gain after 40 years of\nage.l0 The data from this survey and similar studies of\nnutritionally homogeneous populations do not support\na robust relationship between sodium intake and BP\nwithin the usual range of intake in this country. This\ndoes not infer that restricted sodium intake (below 75-\n100 mEq/day) will not lower BP, but it does suggest\nthat modest changes in salt use may have little effect.\nFinally, the potentially important effect of dietary cal-\ncium and phosphorous on BP and the reverse relation-\nships of serum levels deserve considerable attention,\nespecially in older persons who have a lower dietary\ncalcium intake and who may benefit from calcium\nsupplementation as a prophylaxis for osteoporosis.\nReferences\n1.
