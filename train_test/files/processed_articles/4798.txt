The sample consisted of 147 cancer survivors (70 boys and 77 girls)\naged 8 to 18 who were in remission 2 to 5 years. The analyses were carried out separately for younger (8-12 years) and\nolder (13-19 years) age groups. Cancer survivors were asked to complete Minnesota\u00adMinneapolis Quality of Life Instrument\n(MMQL) as well as other methods of measuring involvement in everyday life activities and parent\u00adchild interactions Social\nAnd Health Assessment (SAHA) were used. Severity of late effects was assessed on a 4-point scale in accordance with\nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. While severity of late effects correlated positively only with parental\nwarmth in younger age bracket, there were many relationships between severity of late effects and quality of life in older age\nbracket. The difference between the two age brackets is explained by the fact that adolescents are able to assess the impact\nof the disease.\n",

Two thirds of childhood cancer survi-\nvors suffer from at least one chronic health problem, approx-\nimately half of which are serious or even life-threatening\none third of survivors have no health problems.\nSpecific types of late effects on somatic health include\nphysical damage (limb amputation, permanent alopecia),\nrestriction of physical functions due to conservational sur-\ngeries (resection of affected bones and homograft replace-\nments), chronic organ dysfunctions (heart, intestines, liver,\nkidneys, and urinary bladder), diseases occurring in adult age\n(cardiovascular problems and diabetes), impaired growth\nand other disorders of endocrine functions (particularly after\nradiotherapy [RT] of neurocranium or bone marrow trans-\nplantation), neurological disorders (pareses, plegias, poly-\nneuropathies), dysfunctions of sensory organs (hearing loss,\npartial or complete loss of sight), and infertility. Extremely\nunfavorable effects of oncological treatment include second-\nary malignities. According to certain authors, the overall risk\nof incidence of these tumors in survivors is 2%, but in some\nspecific types of malignities, it can be much higher (25%-\nThe most severe psychosocial effects of therapy include\ndisorders of neurocognitive functions.

Learning difficulties and problems with memory\nand concentration can be also a consequence of absence from\nthe school (Eiser et al., 2007). Cognitive difficulties tend to\nintensify with the lapse of time after treatment. Other serious\nconsequences include social difficulties and problems form-\ning close/intimate relations. The impaired social functioning\nmay cause more distress than physical effects of the illness\n(Zebrack et al., 2004).About 12% of cancer survivors develop\nposttraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD;Langeveld,Grootenhuis,\nVoute, & de Haan, 2004). In the long term, childhood cancer\nsurvivors may also have problems finding employment. The\ncontributing factors include cognitive impairments and poor\nschool performance, physical limitations, suboptimal social\nskills, and preconceptions on the part of some employers.\nCancer survivors live with uncertainty over their future\nhealth, and worry about possible relapse of the disease and\nsecondary tumors and about the limitations presented by late\neffects. They have to come to terms with a compromise in\ntheir physical and social functioning.\nQuality of lives of cancer survivors is influenced not only\nby the presence and number of late effects of therapy but also\nby their severity. Studies on the relationship between sever-\nity of late effects and perceived quality of life are rather\nscarce and, what is more, they provide ambiguous results.\nFor instance, Benesch et al. (2009) observed in survivors of\nmedulloblastoma/ependymoma (median of time after ther-\ntion only between neurological late effects and scores of\nChildren Quality of Life Questionnaire KINDL. Meeske,\nvors aged 8 to 18 years (average time after therapy 7.8 years)\nand found out that fatigue and severe effects of therapy were\nassociated with impaired physical functioning. On the con-\ntrary, L\u00f6f, Winiarski, Giesecke, Ljungman, and Forinder\n(stem cell transplantation) that adverse effects had none or\nlimited impact on their health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL).\nThe relationship between severity of late effects of anti-\ncancer therapy and perceived quality of life are however\naffected also by other factors such as type of diagnosis,\ntumor localization, type of therapy, age at the time of ther-\napy, time of therapy termination, and age of respondents at\nthe time of completion of questionnaires (Skinner, Wallace,\n& Levitt, 2007). For instance, infertility significantly\ndecreases perceived quality of life in adolescence and young\nadulthood, but not in childhood, as children usually cannot\nunderstand the consequences. Similarly, infertility does not\nhave to influence quality of life of older adults who had\nalready come to terms with it.Age of respondents can explain\nweak or no correlation between severity of effects and\nperceived quality of life reported by L\u00f6f et al. (2009), who\nperformed a study with adult survivors.\nThe present study analyzes the relationships between\nseverity of late effects of anticancer therapy and perceived\nquality of life in two brackets: children aged 8 to 12 years\nand adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. It was assumed that\nseverity of late effects in children would be compensated by\ngood physical functioning--as physical activities are\nextremely important for them (Langmeier, Langmeier, &\nKrejc\u00edov\u00e1, 1998)--and overall outlook on life. The assump-\ntion in adolescents was that, in addition to previously dem-\nonstrated relationship between severity of late effects and\ndecreased physical functioning (Meeske et al., 2007) and\ncognitive functioning (Kep\u00e1k et al., 2007), there would be\nnegative correlation between severity of late effects and\ninvolvement in social relations and leisure time activities,\nforming intimate relations and body image, as these aspects\nof life are very important in adolescence (Brown & Larson,\nof late effects on overall outlook on life was expected also in\nadolescents.\nMethod\nSample\nThe study sample consisted of 52 anticancer therapy survi-\ninquiry, younger respondents were in remission for 20 to 118\nmonths (median = 37 months), having been diagnosed to\nhave central nervous system (CNS) tumor (12 persons), leu-\nkemia (22 persons), and solid extracranial tumors (18 per-\nsons). Older respondents were in remission for 8 to 140\nmonths (median = 40 months), having been diagnosed to suf-\nfer from CNS tumor (20 persons), leukemia (10 persons),\nand solid extracranial tumors (65 persons).\nInstruments\nInvolvement in leisure time activities was measured by the\nConventional Involvement scale taken from SAHA (Social\nand Health Assessment) questionnaire (Schwab-Stone et al.,\nindividual activities on a 5-point scale (\"How often in the\nTotal involvement in afterschool and leisure activities is\nexpressed as the mean score.\nInteractions between parents and children (parenting\naspects) were measured using the Parent\u00adChild Interactions\nScale, again from SAHA questionnaire, that determines four\naspects of parenting--parental involvement (Cronbach's  =\ntrol (Cronbach's  = .705) and inconsistency of parenting\nBlatn\u00fd et al. 3\n(Cronbach's  = .560.

Late effects were assessed by a physician on the date\nof investigation using appropriate medical records. Individual\nlate effects and their combinations were evaluated in accor-\ndance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse\nEvents v3.01 (CTCAE). The resulting degree of severity was\nestablished according to the most severe late effect recorded.\nMethods of Analysis\nThe relationship between late effects of anticancer therapy\nand perceived quality of life was assessed by correlation\nanalysis: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used\ndue to ordinal nature of variable reflecting the severity of\neffects.\nResults\nDescriptive data about severity of late effects of therapy in\ndependence on patient's age and type of diagnosis are stated\nin Table 1.\nTable 1 demonstrates that overall severity of effects was\nslightly lower in children aged 8 to 12 years than in adoles-\ncents aged 13 to 19 years.

Physical functioning,\npsychological (emotional) functioning, and overall outlook\non life decrease with higher severity of late effects; this rela-\ntionship however is not statistically significant. In adoles-\ncents, severity of late effects of therapy is associated with\nmany aspects of perceived quality of life. Severity of late\neffects correlates negatively with cognitive functioning,\nphysical and social functioning, and body image. Overall\noutlook on life and satisfaction with intimate relations\ndecreases in adolescents with higher severity of late effect of\ntherapy. Nevertheless, these relationships were not statisti-\ncally significant.\nDiscussion\nThe incidence of late effects of anticancer therapy observed\nin the present study sample corresponds with many studies\nthat identified certain late effect in up to 70% survivors (e.g.,\nproved that the most severe late effects are found in survivors\nof CNS tumors, whereas the least severe effects are seen in\npatients with history of leukemia.\nIt was assumed that severity of late effects of therapy in\nvarious age categories would correlate with different aspects\nof perceived quality of life. However, only a part of this\nhypothesis was confirmed. As expected, more relationships\nbetween severity of late effects and perceived quality of life\nwere observed in adolescents. Although the anticipated rela-\ntionships were found in younger bracket as well, they were\nnot statistically significant--this was namely the relationship\nbetween severity of late effects and decreased physical and\npsychological functioning and pessimistic outlook on life.\nThe only statistically significant relationship between\nseverity of late effects of therapy and perceived quality of\nlife in children was the correlation between severity of late\neffects and parental warmth: The severer the effects, the\nmore the parental warmth. This relationship could explain\nthe absence of other statistically significant correlations\nbetween perceived quality of life and severity of late effects\nof therapy: Parental warmth can compensate for children's\nhandicaps resulting from the consequences of therapy.\nIn fact, more relationships between late effects severity\nand perceived quality of life were found in adolescents. This\nmight be due to the fact, that they took an adult attitude about\ntheir disease, were fully aware of its effects, and could antici-\npate future consequences. In accordance with other authors,\nthe present study indicated that severity of late effects\nreduced perceived quality of life in the area of physical and\ncognitive functioning (Meeske et al., 2007; Mulhern et al.,\n2004). The results of this study suggest that severity of\neffects negatively influences also involvement in leisure\ntime activities, social functioning, and body image. This is\non average) consider physical appearance and conventional\ninvolvement as key domains of their lives (Lerner &\nSteinberg, 2009). Moreover, adolescents showed negative\nrelationships between severity of late effects and outlook on\nlife and satisfaction with intimate relations. These relation-\nships were however statistically insignificant.\nThe results of the present study confirm the hypothesis\nthat severity of late effects of anticancer therapy should be\nstudied in relation to not only specific diagnosis, tumor\nlocalization, type of therapy, and age of patients at the time\nof therapy but also age of respondents at the time of inquiry.\nActually, criteria of perceived quality life as well as domains\nthat are most affected by the consequences of anticancer\ntherapy can change with time.\nLimitations\nThis study has typical limitations of inquiries based on self-\nreport data. However, as it studies quality of life, it has to\nwork with such data. This study is also limited by uneven\ndistribution of diagnoses in the sample, as adolescent survi-\nvors of CNS tumors and leukemia are not represented suffi-\nciently. Hence, possible interaction between severity of\ntherapy effects and the type of diagnosis and their overall\nimpact on perceived quality of life could not be analyzed.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\nsupported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No.\nNote\nReferences\nBenesch, M., Spiegl, K., Winter, A., Passini, A., Lackner, H.,\nMoser, A., Urban, C.
