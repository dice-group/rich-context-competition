This study defines an individual's daily\ndiscretionary minutes by subtracting minutes of necessary and committed\ntime from 1,440 (total daily minutes) as done in Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and\nAndrews (2011). Necessary activities are those activities that must be per-\nformed by an individual for him- or herself (sleep, grooming, health-\nrelated self-care, and other personal and/or private activities). Committed\nactivities are those that must be performed due to previous life choices\nsuch as whether to marry, to divorce, to have and raise children, and to be\nemployed (time spent in household work, time spent in child care, time\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Agricultural and Applied Economics Association 2012.\nspent caring for household adults, and time spent in employment or\nrelated activities).1 Although an individual has the ability to make mar-\nriage, divorce, fertility, and employment choices over time, on a given day\nthese choices have already been made, and their associated time commit-\nments are thus essentially fixed. Therefore, although each individual tech-\nnically has 24 hours in a day, different people face different discretionary\ntime constraints depending on their life circumstances.\nThis study hypothesizes that time-poor individuals may not be able to\nprepare and eat healthy meals or to exercise. These hypotheses are tested\nby estimating a simultaneous model that jointly analyzes the relations\nbetween time poverty and fast food purchases, the number of eating and\ndrinking occurrences, minutes spent engaging in sports and exercise, and\nengaging in active travel (walking or biking twenty minutes or more).\nBetter understanding of Americans' eating and activity behaviors can\nprovide insight into policies and programs that address obesity issues.\nTheory\nIn the standard labor-leisure model, discretionary time, T, is divided\ninto two categories, labor and leisure. Paid work would fall under the cat-\negory of labor, while preparing and eating healthy meals and exercising\nwould fall under the category of leisure. While predictions from the\nmodel based on T can be made, most analyses assume that T is fixed and\nis the same for all individuals. However, due to people's differing com-\nmitments, for example, due to a minimum amount of child care that must\nbe performed, people do indeed have different levels of discretionary\ntime. In figure 1, individual 1 has more discretionary time, T1\n, than indi-\n. Because the individuals' discretionary time is different, the\nmaximum hours that they work and the maximum income from their\nwork are different, even if their wage rates are the same. Consequently,\nindividual 1, with greater discretionary time, will be able to attain a\nlabor-leisure choice on a higher indifference curve with greater utility (U1\n)\nthan individual 2 (U2\n). Labor-leisure choice A on U1\nallows for more\nhours worked and more income (I1\n), but also more discretionary hours\n) than individual 2's choice B with less income (I2\n) and less discretion-\nary time (D2\n).\nLiterature Review\nand Davis and You (2011) modified existing income poverty thresholds to\naccount for time constraints. Gershuny (2011) developed the \"triangle of\ndaily activities,\" which includes leisure, unpaid work, and paid work to\nrepresent work-life balance when measuring national well-being. Other\nauthors defined time poverty and calculated time poverty thresholds for\nvarious countries: Bardasi and Wodon (2006) for Guinea; Harvey and\nIreland; Burchardt (2008) for the United Kingdom; Spinney and Millward\n1More detail regarding the classification of necessary, committed, and discretionary activities is pro-\nvided in the appendix.\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\nUnited States. Zacharias (2011) compared alternative approaches to defin-\ning time and income poverty and discussed their potential role in anti-\npoverty policies.\nFewer studies, however, have investigated the associations of time\npoverty and individuals' behavior. Mothersbaugh, Hermann, and Warland\n(1993) examined the relationship between perceived time pressure and\npeople's adherence to recommended dietary practices (RDPs), and found\nthat perceptions of time pressure do indeed have adverse effects on indi-\nviduals' eating habits and RDPs. Although he did not directly measure\ntime poverty, Christian (2009) found that longer commutes were associated\nwith less time spent in exercise and other health-related activities, and were\nalso associated with substitution into lower-intensity exercise. In addition,\nhe found that longer commutes increase the likelihood of non-grocery food\npurchases. Spinney and Millward examined the associations between time\nand income poverty and participation in moderate or higher intensity phys-\nical activities, and concluded that \" . . . time poverty may be more important\nthan income poverty as a barrier to regular physical activity,\" (Spinney and\nEating patterns have been found to matter for health outcomes. By\nusing the Seasonal Variation of Blood Cholesterol Study data, Ma et al.\n(2003) found that a greater number of eating episodes per day was associ-\nated with a lower risk of obesity. Using the American Time Use Survey\n(ATUS) Eating and Health (EH) Module data, Hamermesh (2010) found a\nsimilar result, that the frequency of eating meals (primary eating occur-\nrences) and grazing (secondary eating occurrences) were associated with\nlower BMI and better self-reported health. Kolodinsky and Goldstein\n(2011) also used the ATUS and EH Module data to investigate the relation-\nships between time use and food patterns and obesity, and found that\nFigure 1 Labor-Leisure Choices with Different Amounts of Discretionary Time\nHow Does Time Poverty Affect Behavior? A Look at Eating and Physical Activity\nincreases in time spent in meal preparation and cleanup are associated\nwith decreases in BMI.\nEating food away from home (FAFH) also has been found to matter for\nhealth outcomes. Binkley, Eales, and Jekanowski used the 1994-96\nContinuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) and found a pos-\nitive relationship between respondents' BMI and FAFH consumed in the\nprevious 24 hours. They concluded that \"FAFH, and particularly fast food\nconsumption, are likely to be contributing factors to increased obesity,\"\n(Binkley, Eales, and Jekanowski 2000). Todd, Mancino, and Lin, using the\nSurvey (NHANES) data, concluded that FAFH \" . . . is a contributing factor\nto poor diet quality and that concern about FAFH's effect on obesity is\nwarranted,\" (Todd, Mancino, and Lin 2010). These authors also found that\none additional meal eaten away from home increases daily caloric intact\nby about 134 calories, and lowers diet quality by two points on the\nHealthy Eating Index.\nLooking specifically at fast food, the literature is mixed on the effects of\nthat fast food consumption was positively associated with BMI. Mehta\nand Chang (2008) studied food environment and found that a higher ratio\nof fast food to full-service restaurants was associated with higher BMIs.\nBowman and Vinyard (2004) found an association between fast food con-\nsumption and overweight status, but characterized that relationship as\nbeing weak. However, Cutler et al. (2003) found that Americans' increased\ncaloric intake is from more snacks, whereas the increase in fast food con-\nsumption is a result of reduced home consumption. Thus, fast food calo-\nries are offsetting fewer calories eaten at home. Despite this mixed\nevidence, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies report\n(2012) categorizes fast food restaurants as \"unhealthy food venues\" (p. 3).\nPhysical activity also affects health outcomes. Hemmingsson and\nEkelund (2007) collected their own data measuring physical activity with\naccelerometry, and tested the generally-accepted inverse relationship\nbetween physical activity and BMI. They found that physical activity and\nBMI are only weakly associated for non-obese individuals, but are highly\nsignificantly associated for obese individuals. Stamatakis, Hirani, and\nRennie (2009) investigated the relationships of physical activity types--\nfrom inactive to sufficiently active for obesity prevention--and sedentary\nbehavior with BMI using the 2003 Scottish Health Survey. These authors\nconcluded that physical activity and sedentary behavior are both strongly\nand independently related to obesity, for obesity defined as BMI 30 kg/\nm2 and waist circumference (WC) 88 cm in women and 102 cm in\nmen. Dunton et al. used the 2006 ATUS and EH Module data to examine\nthe interaction between time spent in physical activity and in sedentary\nbehavior on BMI. They concluded that \"sedentary behaviors and physical\nactivity interact with each other in relation to BMI in adults,\" (Dunton\nLong-run trends in obesity have also been studied (Cutler et al. 2003;\nVariyam 2005), and a variety of environmental factors have been identified\nas contributing to these long-run trends. Powell and Chaloupka (2009)\npoint to the decline in food prices and the increase in the availability of fast\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\nfood and restaurant meals, and Chou et al. (2004) point to the increased\nprice of cigarettes and the reduction in smoking. Another important con-\ntributor to the increase in Americans' body size has been the changing\nnature of work. Both technological advances and industrial restructuring in\nthe United States have resulted in the decline in physical exertion required\nfor performing paid work. Philipson and Posner stated this trend concisely\nby noting that in an agricultural or industrial society, \"work is strenuous;\nin effect, the worker is paid to exercise,\" whereas in a post-industrial\nsociety, \"people must pay for undertaking--rather than be paid to under-\ntake--physical activity\" (Philipson and Posner 2003). As a result, individu-\nals then pay for exercise by budgeting their recreational time. \"The full\nprice of physical activity is the opportunity cost of allotted time--the value\nof the most preferable alternative given up by allotting time for a walk in\nthe neighborhood or a run in the park\" (Variyam 2005).\nThe contribution of the present study is to utilize the very detailed and\ncomprehensive ATUS data to examine both sides of the energy-balance\nequation\u00adboth input and expenditure of energy. As such, it analyzes how\ntime poverty is associated with fast food purchases, the number of eating\nand drinking occurrences, the number of minutes engaged in sports and\nother exercise, and time engaged in active travel.\nData\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey data were\nused for this study. One individual aged 15 or older from each sampled\nhousehold was interviewed about his or her activities for the 24-hour\nperiod from 4 A.M. the day before the interview to 4 A.M. the day of the\ninterview. Survey respondents were asked to identify their primary activ-\nity if they were engaged in more than one activity at a time. They were\nalso asked to report where they were and who else was present for each\nactivity. In addition to the time-diary data, demographic, labor force par-\nticipation, and household information was collected from the respondents.\nThis study used the Respondent, Activity, Activity Summary, and\nMethodology (Case History) files from the ATUS, as well as the EH\nModule Respondent, Activity, and Replicate Weights files. The analysis\n37,832 completed interviews of individuals aged 15 or over. The replicate\nweights from the EH Module produce nationally-representative estimates\nfor an average day over this period. Excluding those with bad diaries,3\n2See U.S. DOL BLS (2010) for discussion of using the American Time Use Survey data, and Hamrick\n(2010) and Hamrick et al. (2011) for discussion of using the Eating & Health Module data.\n3After each ATUS interview is completed, the Census interviewer answers two data quality questions:\n\"Is there any reason the information from this interview should NOT be used?\" and \"Why do you\nthink the data should not be used?\" In 275 cases of the 37,832 completed interviews, the Census inter-\nviewer thought that the respondent's time diary was not of good quality, as indicated by the variable\nTUDQUAL2 from ATUS Case History data file. We defined a poor-quality time diary as one where\nTUDQUAL2 had a value of 1 (intentionally wrong), 2 (could not remember), 3 (deliberately long\ndurations), or 4 (other reason).\nHow Does Time Poverty Affect Behavior? A Look at Eating and Physical Activity\nthose under age 20, and those that are underweight,4 the resulting sample\nOne potential drawback of the ATUS diary data is that information on\nonly one time-diary day per person was collected. There may be concern\nthat some activities, such as eating fast food or engaging in sports and\nexercise, are not daily activities and thus that a one-day diary such as the\nATUS lacks intrapersonal variability. However, some activities, such as\neating patterns, have a large degree of persistency, meaning that\nday-to-day variation is minimal; Wansink's (2007) Mindless Eating dis-\ncusses the myriad external influences that result in eating habits. Exercise\nis also considered to be a habit, and researchers have studied what con-\nmuch of an individual's daily activities can be classified as habitual repeti-\nNevertheless, food intake surveys are typically multiday surveys. For\nexample, the NHANES includes two 1-day food recall interviews.6\nHowever, because the second-day diaries have a higher rate of non-\nresponse, and because respondents' consistent reports of less food con-\nsumption on the second day suggest under-reporting, some researchers\nelect to use only the first diary day (Gregory et al. 2012).\nIndeed, existing research supports using a one-day diary to analyze\nindividuals' activity patterns. Lambe et al. (2000) examined food consump-\ntion using 14-day diaries in five locations in the European Union. Among\ntheir findings was that the quality of the diaries declined over the 14 days,\nwith the best information and most variation obtained in the first three\ndays. However, they found that mean intakes of a given food item were\nnot affected by survey duration. More recently, Raux et al. (2011) studied\nseven-day travel diaries for individuals in Ghent, Belgium, and concluded\nthat while there is a large amount of interpersonal variability (differences\nacross individuals in their travel patterns), there is small intrapersonal var-\niability (variation across an individual's seven days of time diaries).\nLikewise, Schmidt (2011) studied seven-day diaries of Germans' payments\n(consumer expenditures), both cash and noncash, with a focus on cash\npayments, and found that survey fatigue is apparent and that more cash\npayments were recorded on day one. However, the distribution of pay-\nments during diary days 2\u00ad7 is similar, leading Schmidt to conclude \"that\nadditional diary days only increase the sample size, rather than provide\n4We exclude those under 20 years old because the Centers for Disease Control adult BMI interpreta-\ntion is for persons aged 20 and over. Body Mass Index is calculated as: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 \u00d7\n(25  BMI , 30), and obese (30 BMI). See CDC for more information on adult BMI: http://\nwww.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html. We exclude those who are underweight because\nof the small number of respondents. Those who have a BMI less than 18.5 comprise 1.4% of respond-\nents aged 20 and over with a BMI value. It is the authors' experience that because of the small cell\nsize, this group's characteristics and patterns can be dominated by a small number of respondents who\nengage in activities for a long duration. Having a small number of respondents dominate an estimate,\nin some cases as few as 2 respondents, is an indicator that the cell size is not large enough for\nanalysis.\n5Creation of the analysis data set was done using SAS 9.2 and STATA 12 and estimation was per-\nformed using STATA 12.\n6For more information on NHANES, see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\nVariables\nTwo measures of eating patterns are available using the ATUS data, an\nindicator variable for whether or not fast food was purchased on the diary\nday, and the number of eating and drinking occurrences on the diary day\n(both primary and secondary).7 Two measures of physical activity can be\ncreated using the ATUS data, minutes spent on sports and exercise (ATUS\nactivities 1301xx) on the diary day, and an indicator variable for whether\nor not the respondent engaged in active travel (walked or biked twenty\nminutes or more on the diary day (ATUS activities 18xxxx and\nTEWHERE \u00bc 14 or TEWHERE \u00bc 17). Twenty minutes of daily exercise is\na federal guideline for weight management.8\nEating and drinking is a daily activity for almost everyone, and food\nconsumption away from home takes place several times a week, on\naverage.9 Active travel is likely to be a daily activity for those who engage\nin it, especially if they walk or cycle for all or part of a commute to work.\nTherefore, the only measure that is likely to be underestimated by using\none-day diary data is sports and exercise, which is typically not a daily\nactivity, although it can be considered a habitual activity.\nThe key explanatory variable in this analysis is an indicator for whether\nor not individuals are time-poor. This indicator takes a value of one if\ntotal daily discretionary time is less than 289.8 minutes (4.83 hours), and a\nvalue of zero otherwise. The cutoff of 60% of the median discretionary\ntime as calculated by Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and Andrews (2011) was\nused.10 Discretionary time is defined as total daily minutes (i.e., 1440)\nminus time spent on personal care, market work, household work, child\ncare, and adult care.\nOther explanatory variables available in the ATUS are an indicator vari-\nable for whether or not the diary day that was a holiday or weekend day;\nan indicator variable for whether or not the respondent is female; age\nmeasured in number of years; an indicator variable for whether or not the\nrespondent is married; the number of children in the household; an\nat a restaurant (TEWHERE \u00bc 4). We included both respondents who ate the food at the restaurant\nand those who carried out the food. By including only the 070103 cases with TEWHERE \u00bc 4, we\nexcluded purchasing food at TEWHERE \u00bc 7 (other store, mall) and TEWHERE \u00bc 11 (other place).\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has identified that secondary eating at these \"other place\" locations is usually\nat an entertainment venue such as a stadium or movie theater (e-mail correspondence from BLS to\nKaren S. Hamrick dated February 29, 2008). By selecting those who pay first, that is, those who pur-\nchase at a counter-service restaurant, we excluded those who were at sit-down restaurants and reported\ntalking with waiters and waitresses or interacting with restaurant cashiers at the end of the meal,\nwhich are also coded as 070103. Including these individuals did not qualitatively change the results.\nAlso note that selecting those cases where the individual paid first will include both fast food or\nquick service restaurants (e.g., McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts) and fast\ncasual restaurants (e.g., Panera Bread, Cosi, Corner Bakery), which tend to have fresher, lighter fare\nthan fast food restaurants.\n8http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Chapter2.pdf. Page 17.\n9The National Restaurant Association's 2000 survey found that Americans aged 8 and older consume\nan average of 4.2 commercially prepared meals per week (National Restaurant Association 2000). Men\nare more likely to consume commercially prepared meals. About 22% of men's meals, and about 18%\nof women's meals are commercially prepared. Because restaurant sales have increased in real dollars by\nabout two-thirds from 2000\u00ad2012 (projected), the frequency of consumption of commercially-prepared\nmeals is likely to have increased since the 2000 survey (National Restaurant Association 2012).\n10Kalenkoski, Hamrick, and Andrews (2011) performed an extensive sensitivity analysis using alterna-\ntive definitions of time poverty. The results of those sensitivity analyses are discussed in that paper.\nHow Does Time Poverty Affect Behavior? A Look at Eating and Physical Activity\nindicator variable for whether income is greater than 185% of the poverty\nthreshold; 11 an indicator variable for whether income is missing; and an\nindicator variable for whether or not the respondent has at least a bache-\nlor's degree.\nModel\nThree probit models and two continuous regressions are jointly esti-\nmated:\nX + EF\nX + EA\nY + ET\nX + EN\nX + ES,\nwhere F* is a latent variable representing a fast food purchase; F is an\nindicator variable equal to 1 if fast food was purchased and 0 otherwise;\nA* is a latent variable representing active travel; A is an indicator variable\nequal to 1 if the respondent engaged in active travel on the diary day and\n0 otherwise; TP* is an indicator variable representing non-discretionary\ntime; TP is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent was time-\npoor and 0 otherwise; N is the number of eating occurrences on the diary\nday; and S is the number of minutes spent on sports and exercise on the\ndiary day.\nNote that TP is the key explanatory variable in each of the time-use\nequations. Because it is a potentially endogenous regressor, it is modeled\njointly with these uses of time. The variable X is a vector of demographic\nand other characteristics of the respondent and his/her household, while\nY is a vector of additional variables in the time poverty probit that may\nhelp identify time poverty in the other equations. The B's are estimated\ncoefficients on the explanatory variables, and the E's are the error terms.\nSubscripts for the individual are suppressed for clarity. Because all of the\nactivities we analyze were engaged in by the same individual, and\nbecause they were all subject to the same time constraint, we allow the\nerror terms to be correlated across models.\n11The EH Module asks respondents whether their household income is greater or less than the dollar\namount of 185% of the poverty threshold, which corresponds with the income eligibility thresholds for\nreduced-price school meals and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and\nChildren (WIC). We use the 185% poverty threshold level to define individuals in low-income\nhouseholds.\nApplied Economic Perspectives and Policy\nResults\nTable 1 presents weighted descriptive statistics for the full sample\n(those aged 20 and over who participated in the EH module and also pro-\nvided good time diaries), and for the time-poor and not time-poor sub-\nsamples. These descriptive statistics reflect an average day for the years\npoor, and 25,821 persons (80%) are categorized as not time-poor. Eight\npercent of Americans aged 20 and older purchased fast food on an\naverage day. Seven percent of those who were time-poor purchased fast\nfood, while 9% of those who were not time-poor purchased fast food. The\naverage number of eating and drinking occurrences12 per day was just\nunder three, with time-poor individuals having fewer eating and drinking\noccurrences (2.7) than not time-poor individuals (2.9). Nineteen minutes\nwas the daily average number of minutes spent on sports and exercise,\nbut there was a dramatic difference between the average number of\nminutes spent on these activities by those who were time-poor (6 minutes)\nand those who were not time-poor (22 minutes). Five percent of respond-\nents were engaged in active travel; 4% of the time-poor and just over 5%\nof the not time-poor.\nMen were more likely to be time-poor, perhaps because of their greater\nlabor force participation. Younger individuals were more likely to be time-\npoor than older individuals, while married people and people living with\nmore children in their households were also more likely to be time-poor.\nHigher-income individuals were more likely to be time-poor, as were\nmore highly educated individuals.\nTable 2 presents results from a maximum likelihood model that jointly\nestimates the fast food and active travel probits and the continuous regres-\nsions representing the number of eating and drinking occurrences and the\nnumber of minutes spent on sports and exercise. This model accounts for\ncorrelations in the errors of the activity equations but treats time poverty\nas exogenous (i.e., excludes the time poverty equation from the model).\nTime-poor individuals have different eating patterns than not-time-poor\nindividuals. Being time-poor is associated with a reduction in the likeli-\nhood of a fast food purchase on an average day by 3%, perhaps due to the\ntime needed to travel to a fast food establishment and to wait in line; that\nis, fast food may not in fact be fast to those with limited time. If fast food\nis indeed unhealthy food, this is good news for time-poor individuals.\nTime poverty is also associated with a reduction in the number of eating\nand drinking occurrences on an average day by 0.27. This is a substantial\neffect, given that the average number of eating and drinking occurrences\nfor the full sample is 2.9. According to Ma et al. (2003) and Hamermesh\n(2010), this means a greater risk of obesity for time-poor individuals.\nTime-poor individuals also have different activity patterns than do\nnot-time-poor individuals. Time-poor individuals spend almost 18\nminutes less on sports and exercise on a given day than do not-time-poor\nindividuals, a large effect given that the average time spent by all individ-\nuals is almost 19 minutes. Similarly, time-poor individuals are 1% less\nlikely to engage in active travel than not-time-poor individuals. Thus,\n12Eating and drinking occurrences include both primary eating and drinking (eating and drinking\nbeverages as a main activity) and secondary eating and secondary drinking (eating and/or drink-\ning beverages as a secondary activity while doing something else as the primary activity).\nHow Does Time Poverty Affect Behavior?

RhoFS is the estimated\nerror correlation between a fast food purchase and the number of minutes\nspent on sports and exercise; it is negative and statistically significant, sug-\ngesting that an unobserved factor, such as a preference for a healthy life-\nstyle, leads to a lower likelihood of a fast food purchase and more minutes\nspent on sports and exercise. RhoNA, the estimated error correlation\nbetween the number of eating and drinking occurrences and active travel,\nis positive and statistically significant, perhaps also reflecting an unob-\nserved preference for healthy living. Finally, RhoSA is the estimated error\ncorrelation between the number of minutes spent on sports and exercise,\nand the probability of active travel; it is positive and statistically signifi-\ncant, again suggesting that a person's desire to have a healthy lifestyle\nleads to more time spent on sports and exercise and a greater likelihood of\nwalking or biking more than 20 minutes on an average day.\nTable 3 presents results that control for the possibility that time poverty\nis endogenous13 (i.e., a time poverty probit is added to the previous simul-\ntaneous equations model). Time poverty may be endogenous because it\ndepends on time spent in other activities such as personal care, market\nwork, and household work. Although we have argued that these daily\nactivities are largely fixed given prior commitments to work and family,\nthere may be discretionary time spent on these activities that was jointly\nchosen with time spent eating and engaging in physical activity.\nOnce the potential endogeneity of time poverty is controlled for, time\npoverty is no longer a statistically significant determinant of the number\nof eating and drinking occurrences, or the number of minutes spent on\nsports and exercise. However, time-poor individuals are still significantly\nless likely to purchase fast food, with time-poor individuals 4% less likely\nto make a fast food purchase than not-time-poor individuals. They are\nalso 2% less likely to engage in active travel. These effects are only slightly\nlarger in magnitude than those from the model that did not account for\nTable 3 Continued\nError Correlations\nRhoAT\u00adbetween engaging in active travel and time poverty 0.026\nNotes: An intercept is also included in all equations.\nEating and Health Module replicate weights were used to calculate standard errors.\nMarginal effects for the fast food, active travel, and time poverty probit equations are calculated at the\nmean.

In table 2, marginal effects and standard\nerrors of the marginal effects are presented for the probit models. However, the complexity of the model\nin table 3 renders calculation of the standard errors of the marginal effects of the probit models inap-\npropriate. Indeed, STATA SE 12 refuses to compute them. Thus, in table 3, for the probit outcomes,\ncoefficient estimates, standard errors of the coefficient estimates, and marginal effects are presented.\nHow Does Time Poverty Affect Behavior? A Look at Eating and Physical Activity\nendogeneity. Most of the other explanatory variables retain similar effects\nacross models. Thus, controlling for endogeneity appears only to eliminate\nthe associations of time poverty with the number of eating and drinking\noccurrences and minutes spent on sports and exercise.\nIt should be noted that no \"instruments\" are included in the time\npoverty equation to identify time poverty in the other equations. Metro\nstatus, the state-level monthly unemployment rate, and the state-level cost\nof child care as a percentage of income were all tried as possible instru-\nments, as each could potentially affect an individual's discretionary time.\nHowever, none of these was a significant correlate of time poverty. It is\nlikely that this lack of significance is due to the limited geographic infor-\nmation available in the ATUS, which provides information on the state in\nwhich a respondent lives, but these variables are likely more relevant at\nthe county or local level. Nevertheless, our model is identified by non-\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the complexities of Americans' eating and activity\nbehaviors is important for addressing America's high obesity rate. These\nfindings on the relationships between time poverty and fast food pur-\nchases, the number of eating and drinking occurrences, time spent\nengaged in sports and exercise, and active travel shed light on this issue.\nTo their benefit, time-poor individuals are less likely to purchase fast\nfood, which is considered by some to be generally unhealthy. This finding\npresents the possibility that time-poor individuals are purchasing pre-\npared food from grocery stores or other venues. Research is needed to\nbetter understand convenience foods and their sources. To their detriment,\ntime-poor individuals are also less likely to engage in active travel. One\npossible policy implication of this finding is that policy-makers could con-\nsider the development of sidewalks and bike paths to encourage individu-\nals to walk or cycle more frequently. Employers could also implement\nprograms to encourage active travel to work, such as taking steps to earn\nthe designation of \"Bicycle Friendly Business.\"\n"
