Studies have shown that 33percent of\nthe general population has experienced chest pain at least\nonce (Eslick et al., 2003). A Norwegian study showed that\npercent of patients referred to a cardiac medical out-\npatient clinic for an initial evaluation of chest pain did not\nhave any evidence of coronary artery disease (Dammen,\n2002). Most of these patients are sent home with the assur-\nance that there is nothing wrong with the heart. However,\nstudies have shown that 47\npercent of patients with non-\ncardiac diagnoses still experienced chest pain 5\nmonths\nafter their cardiac evaluation, and more than 50percent of\nthese patients were not convinced by their negative cardiac\ndiagnosis (Dumville et al., 2007). A follow-up study of\npatients who had received reassurance that they were at\nvery low risk of cardiac disease after a full assessment by a\nchest pain observation unit (including exercise stress test-\npercent reported that they still worried\nabout their chest pain 1month after assessment (Goodacre\net al., 2001). These findings may indicate that a large pro-\nportion of patients who experience non-cardiac chest pain\n(NCCP) are not reassured and continue to be worried by\ntheir chest pain. It is important to mention that the term\nNCCP means that the pain is of a non-cardiac origin and\nthat it includes other different etiologies, such as musculo-\nskeletal, gastrointestinal, and psychological causes (Fass\nand Achem, 2011). That many in this patient group con-\ntinue to experience pain and worry about cardiac causes of\ntheir pain, despite comprehensive medical examination that\nshows there is no cardiac cause, is a well-documented phe-\nis pertinent to add that NCCP often results in high health-\ncare resource utilization (Fass and Achem, 2011).\nSeveral factors may influence the individuals' experi-\nence of chest pain. According to Turk's biopsychosocial\nmodel, pain can be modulated by the patient's personality,\nemotional state, and method of coping with symptoms.\nMoreover, how patients interpret their symptoms and their\nexpectations about the meaning of their symptoms contrib-\nute to their subjective experience and report of pain (Turk\nand Okifuji, 1999). Because of the large number of indi-\nviduals who seek medical assistance for their NCCP, fac-\ntors that influence the experience of symptoms need to be\nAssociations between emotional instability,\ncoping, and health outcomes among\npatients with non-cardiac chest pain\nMarie Undheim, Edvin Bru and Terje A Murberg\n Keywords\ncoping, emotional instability, health outcomes, illness worry, non-cardiac chest pain, perceived limitations\nUniversity of Stavanger, Norway\nCorresponding author:\nMarie Undheim, Department of Health Studies, University of Stavanger,\nKjell Arholms Hus, 4036 Stavanger, Norway.\nEmail: marie.undheim@uis.no\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nidentified. It is well known that personality factors can\ninfluence a person's perception of symptoms (Watson and\nPennebaker, 1989). There is also evidence indicating that\nthe personality characteristics of emotional instability,\nwhich in this study is used synonymously with neuroticism,\nare linked to the experience of bodily symptoms (Costa and\nPennebaker, 1989). The emotional stability\u00adinstability\ndimension refers to the variation in individuals' disposition\nto experience situations or bodily sensations as benign or\npleasant versus threatening or distressing. Individuals with\na higher score on emotional instability are found to be more\nlikely to experience somatic symptoms and interpret these\nas more threatening compared to emotionally stable indi-\nviduals (Costa and McCrae, 1987). More emotionally insta-\nble persons may be predisposed to extensive illness worry,\nwhich is likely to lead to increased pain-related limitations.\nPrevious research in non-clinical samples has indicated that\nemotional instability is associated with worries and bodily\nsymptoms (Rosmalen et al., 2007), but to our knowledge\nthere have been no studies that have investigated the asso-\nciations between emotional instability, illness worry, and\nperceived limitations due to pain in NCCP patients.\nTherefore, an important aim of this study was to investigate\nthe association of emotional instability with illness worry\nand perceived limitations due to chest pain (PLCP) among\npeople with a non-cardiac diagnosis.\nEmotional instability may influence the perception and\nunderstanding of pain indirectly by affecting the use of cop-\ning styles. There is substantial evidence indicating that\nemotional instability is linked to less adequate coping strat-\negies. Findings from a meta-analysis of the relationships\nbetween personality and coping revealed that emotional\ninstability is related to less use of problem-focused coping\nand acceptance but more emotion-focused coping and sup-\nport seeking (Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007).\nStress and lack of perceived control are found to be\nimportant morbidity factors in a previous study among\nNCCP patients (Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Living with\nchronic chest pain may generate overwhelming stressors\nfor the individual and, in turn, create significant challenges\nin terms of adaptive coping demands. Turk's biopsychoso-\ncial model of pain indicates that coping can modulate pain.\nHowever, limited attention has been given to how coping\nstyles as factors can influence pain perception among peo-\nple with NCCP and how the individuals' coping styles may\nmediate the link between emotional instability and the\nexperience or interpretation of chest pain symptoms.\nKnowledge about how coping styles may mediate this link\ncould help target interventions.\nThere is some empirical support for the existence of sev-\neral primary dimensions of coping. These dimensions can\nbe organized into two higher-order categories: engagement\nand disengagement coping. Disengagement coping involves\ndisengaging the individual from the person/environment\ntransaction (Tobin et al., 1989). Previous research shows\nthat emotional instability is positively related to disengage-\nment coping (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010). In NCCP\npatients, disengagement coping are likely to imply different\nforms of avoidance in order to avoid the experience of pain\nor heart attack. However, instead of relief from pain, avoid-\nance coping are likely to deprive the person from learning\nthat they can carry out also physically strenuous activities\nwithout experiencing pain, and thus result in maintained\nworry and perceived physical limitations. On the other\nhand, engagement coping implies that individuals engage\nin active efforts to control, manage, or change stressful cir-\ncumstances as well as to manage emotional responses to\nthe stressor (Tobin et al., 1989). Support seeking and\nacceptance are coping styles included in engagement cop-\nAcceptance of the life situation including the possibility\nof experiencing pain could reduce worry and improve how\nthe individual deals with the experience of pain (Carver\net al., 1989). Previous research suggests that this type of\nacceptance is particularly difficult for people with NCCP\n(Dumville et al., 2007) and that this may be one reason why\nthey continue to worry about their health and the experi-\nence of chest pain. Moreover, accepting the possibility of\nexperiencing pain and avoiding a strong focus on the pos-\nsibility of pain are likely to be more difficult for people\nwith higher scores on emotional instability (Carver and\nSeeking support is another important form of engagement\ncoping. Support, both from family and health services, is\nusually used to obtain information and to interpret symptoms\npositively. From this perspective, seeking support could con-\ntribute to a decrease in illness worry and improve the ability\nto carry out daily activities despite the possibility of experi-\nencing chest pain. However, seeking support may also reflect\nincreased concerns about what the experienced bodily symp-\ntoms may indicate, and could increase the likelihood that\nsome individuals continue to worry about their chest pain. In\nthat regard, it is relevant to note that emotional instability is\nfound to be linked to more seeking of emotional support\n(Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010). Yet, a previous meta-\nanalysis suggests that emotional instability, on average, is\nunrelated to coping by the seeking of social support (Connor-\nSmith and Flachsbart, 2007). The role of support seeking in\nthe experience of chest pain among NCCP patients is poorly\nunderstood and therefore important to explore.\nAims of the study\nThe main aim of this study was to (1) examine the relation-\nship of emotional instability with illness worry and PLCP\nand (2) investigate to what degree any associations are\nmediated by the following chest pain\u00adrelated coping styles:\nacceptance, seeking emotional support, seeking instrumen-\ntal support, and avoidance.\nUndheim et al. 3\nMethods\nThis study was conducted in an out-patient cardiac clinic in\na city in Norway and is part of a larger longitudinal study. It\nwas approved by the Norwegian Regional Ethic Committee\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki. All the participants volun-\nteered and were able to withdraw at any time.\nSubjects and recruitment\nAll patients who were referred to an out-patient clinic for an\ninvestigation of new onset chest pain were invited to partici-\npate in this study. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1)\nnew onset, non-acute chest pain; (2) age more than 18years;\n(3) ability to read and communicate in Norwegian; and (4)\nability to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the\nfollowing: (1) previously diagnosed with heart disease, (2)\nno symptoms of chest pain, (3) cardiac investigation as part\nof pre-surgical procedure, (4) pregnancy, (5) participation in\nother studies, and (6) life-threatening disease.\nA total of 282 patients were recruited; 59 were excluded\nbased on inclusion and exclusion criteria or because they\nrefused to participate (51.4%). The number of patients\nhad a positive test result, and 10 had an inconclusive test\nresult. The sample for this study included 94 participants,\nand all had a negative test result. The response rate is a\nchallenge among NCCP patients, but the response rate in\nthis study is in line with that of other studies conducted\namong this group of patients (Kisely et al., 2012).\nThe employees in the clinic recruited the patients based\non the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients\nreceived information about the study and a questionnaire\ntogether with an appointment at the cardiac investigation.\nThe questionnaire had to be completed before the appoint-\nment and was collected at the visit. The employees at the\nclinic were called to remind them about the study 2\u00ad5days\nbefore their appointment. When they arrived, they were\nonce again checked against the inclusion and exclusion cri-\nteria, and written informed consent was collected. They all\nunderwent both echocardiogram and electrocardiogram\n(ECG)-stress test as a part of the investigation. Before they\nleft the clinic, they received the results of the tests and\nanswered five questions about the extent to which they had\nbeen reassured. The characteristics of the patients are pre-\nsented in Table 1. The mean duration of chest pain was\nMeasures\nPLCP.To measure the patients' PLCP, eight items from\nThe Medical Outcomes Study Pain Measurement (McDow-\nell, 2006) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (Spertus\net al., 1995) were selected. The participants were asked to\nindicate the extent of limitations they had experienced due\nto chest pain during the previous 4weeks. Items concerned\nlimitations regarding various daily activities, and how the\npain had affected their sleep and mood. The items were\nrated on a 5-point scale, from 1=not at all to 5=extremely,\nand were answered before the appointment. Factor analyses\nwith principle axis extraction and eigenvalue set to 1.0 for\nthese items resulted in a one factor solution that accounted\nfor 57.3percent of variance in items. Results from the fac-\ntor analysis indicate that the items included in the scale\nmeasuring PLCP assess a uniform concept. Cronbach's \nfor the scale was .88.\nIllness worry. To investigate chest pain\u00adrelated worries, we\nused two items from the Reassurance Questionnaire\n(Donkin et al., 2006) and one item from the Brief Illness\nPerception Questionnaire (Broadbent et al., 2006). The\nscale based on these three items yielded high internal con-\nsistency (=.89), and a factor analysis with eigenvalue set\nto 1.0 gave a one factor solution (explained vari-\nance\n=\n82.5%), indicating that the scale measured a uni-\nform concept. The items included were as follows: (1)\n\"How worried are you about your health?\" (2) \"To what\nextent do you believe you have a serious illness?\" and (3)\n\"How concerned are you about your chest pain?\"1 All of\nthese items were rated on a 10-point scale, ranging from\n0=not at all to 10=very much, and were answered before\nthe appointment.\nEmotional instability. Emotional instability was assessed by\nusing the neuroticism subscale from the Eysenck Personal-\nity Questionnaire (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975). This scale\nconsists of 22 items and is scored according to a yes\u00adno\nformat. Scoring range is 22\u00ad44, a higher score indicating\nmore emotional instability. Cronbach's  of the scale for the\nsample used in this study was .88.\nCoping.Chest pain\u00adrelated coping styles were assessed\nusing four subscales from the COPE Scale (Carver et al.,\nTable 1. Characteristics of the patients included in the study\nVariable Years % (n)\nGender\nSick leave or disability pension\nbecause of chest pain\nSD: standard deviation.\n4 Health Psychology Open \n1989): Acceptance, Seeking Instrumental Support, Seeking\nEmotional Support, and Disengagement. The subscale for\nDisengagement was modified to suit the context of this\nstudy, two items were removed, and a new item was added.\nThe items included in this subscale were the following:\n\"I've avoided activities that can lead to chest pain,\" \"I've\ngiven up trying to live a normal life,\" and \"I have become\nless active due to chest pain.\" This shifted the content of this\nscale toward coping by avoidance, and the included meas-\nure was therefore labeledAvoidance. The introduction to the\nscale on coping was modified to relate the items to coping\nwith chest pain. Additionally, some items were modified to\nassure that coping-related chest pain was assessed. The orig-\ninal response alternatives were used, and items were scored\non a 4-point scale ranging from 1=never to 4=often.\nA factor analysis yielded a four factor solution that was in\naccordance with the intended grouping of items but sug-\ngested that one item from instrumental support should be\nincluded in the subscale for emotional support. However, the\noriginal solution from Carver et al. (1989) was chosen. The\nfactor analysis with principle axis extraction and the number\nof factors set to four accounted for 67.9\npercent of the total\nvariance. The explained variances and Cronbach's s for the\nfactor-based indexes were as follows: Seeking Instrumental\nSupport: 7.1percent, \n=\n.73; Seeking Emotional Support:\nControl variables. Previous research on NCCP showed that\nthose who sought treatment had higher rates of NCCP, were\nmore likely to be women, were younger, and had higher\nlevels of self-reported anxiety (Huffman and Pollack,\n2003). Therefore, age and gender were included as control\nvariables. Gender was coded: 1=women and 2=men.\nProcedures and statistical analyses\nIBM SPSS version 21.0 software was used to conduct the\nstatistical analyses (SPSS, 2012). The selected statistical\nprocedures were descriptive analyses, reliability testing\n(Cronbach's ), factor analysis, product\u00admoment correla-\ntions, and multiple regression analysis. Path analysis was\nconducted by performing three multiple regression analy-\nses in which the variables for chest pain\u00adrelated coping\nstyles, illness worry, and PLCP were regressed on the vari-\nables to the left in the path model depicted in Figure 1. The\nmissing values varied from 0 to 6.5 percent. The missing\nvalues were replaced with the mean score for the variable.\nResults\nThe bivariate relationships between the variables are given\nin Table 2. Scores for Emotional instability were moder-\nately to strongly positively correlated with scores for Illness\nworry and PLCP. Emotional instability also showed signifi-\ncant positive associations with scores for Avoidance and\nSeeking Emotional Support and a negative correlation with\nAcceptance. The strongest bivariate correlations were com-\nputed for the associations of Seeking Emotional Support\nwith Seeking Instrumental Support, Avoidance with PLCP,\nand Illness worry with PLCP. Moreover, correlational anal-\nysis revealed tendencies for older patients and women to\nhave lower scores on Illness worry and Avoidance.\nFigure 1. Results of the path analysis.\nNote that only statistically significant coefficients are given, and that all coefficients are adjusted for the control variables age and gender.\nUndheim et al. 5\nThe results from the path analysis are given in Figure 1.\nAge and gender were controlled for in the analyses. The\nresults from the path analysis showed that most of the asso-\nciations of Emotional instability with Illness worry and\nPLCP were mediated by coping styles. The link from\nEmotional instability to PLCP via Avoidance yielded the\nstrongest indirect association. The results reflected a ten-\ndency for those with high scores for emotional instability to\nreport more avoidance, which in turn was associated with\nmore illness worry and PLCP. Moreover, there was a mod-\nerate tendency for high scores on Emotional instability to\nbe associated with low scores for Acceptance, which in turn\nwas related to lower scores on Illness worry. Variables\nassessing the seeking of support did not mediate the rela-\ntionship between Emotional instability and Illness worry\nand PLCP. The regression equation accounted for 52\nper-\ncent of the variance in PLCP.\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have\ninvestigated the associations between emotional instability,\ncoping styles, illness worry, and PLCP in NCCP patients.\nThis study might therefore provide new and important\ninformation about the role of emotional instability and cop-\ning styles in NCCP.\nThe results from the correlation analyses showed mod-\nerate to strong relationships between Emotional instability\nand Illness worry and between Emotional instability and\nPLCP. These results are in accordance with the general\nfindings of individuals who score high on emotional insta-\nbility to have more worries and to report more bodily symp-\nWatson and Pennebaker, 1989) as well as to report more\nchest pain than others (Costa et al., 1982). Moreover, a pre-\nvious study among cardiac patients suggested that those\nwith high scores for emotional instability reported lower\nhealth-related quality of life (Van den Berg et al., 2005). In\nthis study, Emotional instability was found to be indirectly\nrelated to PLCP via Illness worry. This finding is likely to\nindicate that individuals with a higher score on emotional\ninstability experience more limitations due to chest pain\nbecause they restrict their activity and are prone to believe\nthat such activity may have serious negative effect on the\nhealth, despite the fact that such activity most likely will\nimprove their health condition.\nEmotional instability can influence coping styles, which\nin turn influence outcomes (Carver and Connor-Smith,\n2010). Previous research indicates that more emotionally\ninstable individuals tend to use more passive or disengage-\nment coping styles when dealing with stressful life-events\nand that such disengagement coping predicts poorer out-\nThis has, however, not been investigated among people\nwith NCCP. The main purpose of this study was thus to\nexamine the mediating role of coping styles in the relation-\nship between emotional instability and health outcomes\nexpressed by illness worry and PLCP among NCCP\npatients. Results from the path analysis indicate that disen-\ngaged or avoidant coping mediate the relationship of\nEmotional instability with both Illness worry and PLCP.\nThese findings may suggest that more emotionally instable\nNCCP patients are prone to avoid activities they fear can\nelicit chest pain. Moreover, this type of avoidant behavior\nmay reduce opportunities to learn that activities could be\nperformed without chest pain, and is likely to maintain an\nirrational belief that these activities could lead to a serious\nhealth condition. This type of belief and coping could seri-\nously reduce the quality of life among more emotionally\ninstable persons experiencing chest pain. The results showed\na moderate negative association between Emotional insta-\nbility and Acceptance, which is in accordance with a\nTable 2.

Accepting their condition is difficult for\nNCCP patients, and this leads to continued worry. Findings\nindicate that this is especially so for more emotionally insta-\nble patients. Results from this study suggest that it is impor-\ntant to identify more emotionally instable patients, and give\npriority to helping them accept their condition and encour-\nage them to maintain or resume their normal activities.\nCoping by support seeking could provide patients with\ninformation that could reduce worry, but it could also con-\ntribute to maintaining worry because of the persistent focus\non the possible health threats the chest pain may signal. In\nthis study among NCCP patients, there was a slight ten-\ndency for more emotionally instable patients to seek more\nsupport. However, the seeking of support was unrelated to\nchest pain\u00adrelated worry and limitation. These findings are\ninteresting because this factor concerns a core challenge\namong NCCP patients. Many people with NCCP continue\nto seek medical help for their perceived condition without\nbeing reassured that they do not have a serious somatic con-\ndition. Findings suggest that the type of support seeking that\nNCCP patients perform is not likely to be beneficial to them.\nThe correlational analyses also indicate that men tend to\nuse more avoidant coping and to be more worried by their\nchest pain. Generally, men have a tendency to use more\navoidant coping styles, which in turn may be more adaptive\nin handling everyday stress (Krohne, 1996). An explana-\ntion for this phenomenon could be that chest pain due to\nheart disease, such as myocardial infarction, is still viewed\nas a male condition, and women might interpret their chest\npain as a less severe symptom (Granot et al., 2004).\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, this\nstudy is cross-sectional, which means that caution is neces-\nsary if causality is inferred. Second, data are based on self-\nreport, and reporting bias may have influenced results.\nThird, approximately 50percent of the eligible patients did\nnot participate in this study. Low participation rate is com-\nmon in research among this patient group (40%\u00ad60%)\nvalidity problem. Yet, as relationships are assumed to be\nlinear, we do not have reason to believe that a low partici-\npation rate has affected results in a significant way.\nHowever, more research is needed in order to make firm\nconclusions.\nConclusion\nThe findings support the opinion that higher score on emo-\ntional instability is associated with NCCP patients' illness\nworry and their PLCP. Moreover, findings show that these\nassociations are mediated by the coping styles acceptance\nand avoidance. Findings suggest that more emotionally\ninstable patients need to be identified and given special\nattention. They should be carefully informed about possible\ncauses of their chest pain and how they best can adapt to\ntheir condition. Reliable information may help them better\nunderstand and accept their situation and contribute to\ndecreased illness worry as well as less PLCP. Moreover,\nthese patients are likely to benefit from opportunities to\nexpose themselves to situations and activities they usually\navoid, preferably in a safe and supervised environment.\nSuch experience may help them to learn that normal daily\nactivity and even strenuous physical activity is no danger to\nbut rather promotes their health.\nBased on the findings in this study, future considerations\nfor interventions among NCCP patients should also involve\nstress management techniques. Mindful techniques or cog-\nnitive behavioral interventions to reduce worry and accept\nthe chest symptom as unharmful could be helpful (Querstret\n"
