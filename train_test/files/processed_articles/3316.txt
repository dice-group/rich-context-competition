The introduction of education and vocational skills training to ex-militants\nis an innovative approach to transforming one of the major stakeholders in the conflict--youths. Youths had hitherto been\nmajorly associated with violence and criminality in the region. These approaches have achieved some level of successes as\nviolence and militancy have greatly reduced in the region. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed before\nthe program can be regarded as fully successful. Employment opportunities must be provided for ex-militants after their\ntraining, and combatants who have not been accommodated by the program should be catered for, to prevent a return to\nviolence and militancy. With this, ex-militants will become change agents that will spur peace and development in Nigeria's\npost-conflict Niger Delta.\n",

The South\u00adSouth is one of the six regions in the\ncountry. The others are the South\u00adWest, South\u00adEast, North\u00ad\nEast, North\u00adWest, and North\u00adCentral. The South\u00adSouth\ncomprises eight states, namely, Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa,\nCross Rivers, Delta, Edo, Imo, and Ondo (Figure 1). It is\nbelieved to be Africa's largest delta covering about 7,000 sq.\nkm (Iwuoha, 2012) and presently holds all of the country's\noil and gas resources. The region is the economic base of the\ncountry, and the oil and gas sector, the most attractive sector\nof the Nigerian economy (United Nations Development\nThe Niger Delta has been plagued by conflicts and vio-\nlence as a result of the large deposit of crude oil in the region.\nCompetition for resources is a major cause of conflict in\nevery society, and the competition over the nation's \"black\ngold\" has led to protracted conflict in the region. The causes\nof the conflict can be directly traced to environmental chal-\nlenges experienced by communities in the region. David-\nenvironmental pollution of the Niger Delta regions are con-\nsequences related to the oil exploration activities of multi-\nnational oil companies in the area.\" These activities have\ndestroyed the ecological balance in the region (Kuku, 2012),\nleading to widespread poverty. The attitude of international\noil companies (IOCs) and successive governments at the\ncenter to the plight of the people also aggravated the situa-\ntion and led to what has been termed the \"struggle\" by many\npeople in the Niger Delta. The \"struggle\" emanated as a\nresult of the people's displeasure against perceived injustices\nand their exploitation by oil companies in the region. These\ninjustices included non-provision of amenities, non-provi-\nsion of employment opportunities, and the refusal or delay in\nthe payment of compensation to communities. The struggle\nlater on expanded to include the desire for the creation of a\ndistinct region with a political and administrative structure\n2005), as well as a greater share of the federation's revenue\nthan was hitherto allocated to them. The struggle involved\nconfrontation with multi-national oil companies and the fed-\neral government.

The Isaac Adaka Boro group in\n1966 attacked the facilities of Shell-British Petroleum and\ngovernment, and ordered the closure of schools, customary\ncourts, and other institutions. It also canceled all agreements\nrelating to crude oil exploration and production in the Niger\nDelta (Ogbogbo, 2005). Since that first revolt, other pressure\ngroups have sprung up. They include Movement for the\nSurvival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ijaw National\nCongress (INC), and Movement for the Emancipation of the\nNiger Delta (MEND), as well as Chikoko Movement among\nothers (Kuku, 2012). These groups spearheaded coordinated\nattacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta and sabotaged\nthe activities of multi-national oil companies in the region.\nThe Ogoni, under the aegis of the MOSOP, for instance,\neffectively halted the activities of oil companies in the 1980s\ntill the grievances of the people were addressed. MOSOP\nwas also able to mobilize communities in its fight against oil\ncompanies, and it can be said that it was responsible for\nengendering community activism in the struggle.\nThese struggles spanned over three decades and different\nstrategies. Strategies adopted included dialogue, litigation,\nprotest, and recourse to violence (Ogbogbo, 2005). The last\ntwo approaches were responsible for the high rate of insecu-\nrity in the region.\nBy the time the country returned to democratic gover-\nnance in 1999, youth and community restiveness in the Niger\nDelta had reached an all-time high. Different governments at\nthe center made efforts aimed at combating the crisis in the\nNiger Delta, but these did not yield positive results. This was\nprobably because the people of the delta did not trust govern-\nment. Kuku (2012) writes, \"Since independence, the people\nof the Niger Delta have become used to the military being\ndeployed against them by successive military regimes.\" This\nmistrust was extended to civilian governments, especially\nthe Obasanjo regime. His government was accused of using\nviolence and counter violence (force and military action) to\naddress the situation in the Niger Delta (Isumonah, 2003). In\n2003, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), headed by\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo, set up the Joint Task Force\n(JTF) in the Niger Delta, \"to safeguard oil production, secure\noil installations, crush community protest and deal with any\nactivities that threaten the activities of the oil companies or\npersonnel within the oil industry\" (Kuku, 2012). Also in\n1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo ordered the leveling of\nOdi, a riverine community in Bayelsa state, by military per-\nsonnel. It was estimated that about 2,000 people died in that\nmilitary action (Human Rights Watch, 2002).\nMilitant groups in the delta, led by Asari Dokubo of the\nNiger Delta Volunteer Force (NDVF) and Ateke Tom of the\nNiger Delta Vigilantes, retaliated with violence. In 2004,\nAsari Dokubo declared an all-out oil war against the Nigerian\nstate and oil companies operating in the region. He was\nThis was the state of things in the Niger Delta till Umar Musa\nYar'Adua came into office as president in May 2007.\nOn assumption of office, late President Umaru Musa\nYar'Adua realized that youths were the perpetrators of violence\nand militancy in the region, and that there was, therefore, a\nneed to address the problem of militancy in the Niger Delta.\nHis government identified that many of these militants were\n\"able-bodied youths whose energies could be harnessed for the\ndevelopment of the Niger Delta and nation at large\" (Kuku,\n2012). He therefore set up mechanism to tackle the problem of\ninsecurity and youth restiveness in the region. That mechanism\nThe amnesty program is made up of four components,\nnamely, the environmental, petroleum, infrastructural, and\nDemobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR)\ncomponents. The DDR component has direct bearing on the\nsuccessful rehabilitation of armed youths in the region. DDR\nrefers to \"the process of demilitarizing official and unofficial\narmed groups by controlling and reducing the possession of\narms, by disbanding non-state armed groups and rightsizing\nstate security services and by assisting former combatants to\nreintegrate into civilian life\" (Ball & van de Goor, 2006). It is\nused to consolidate peace and to promote stability within con-\nflict-affected communities. The DDR is a proven instrument\nof conflict resolution and peacebuilding, but it cannot and\nshould not be substituted for peace enforcement activities.\nFigure 1. Constituent states of the Niger delta, Nigeria.\nThe Niger Delta DDR component of the amnesty program\naccording to Okonofua (2013), though, might not achieve\nthe desired results, which stakeholders expect or desire\nbecause it failed to address the causes of the conflict. In other\nwords, Okonofua (2013) is insinuating that the DDR process\nmight not produce the desired stability and consolidation of\npeace in Nigeria's delta region because fundamental issues\nthat gave rise to the militarization of youths in the region\nwere not addressed in the amnesty document.\nThe DDR component of the amnesty program is an inte-\ngral part of the intervention. The amnesty program was\ndesigned and established to tackle the problem of insecurity\nand youth restiveness in the Niger Delta, and by implication,\nto restore peace and stability to the region.\nIn light of the motive for establishing the amnesty pro-\ngram by the Federal Government of Nigeria, this article\ninvestigates whether the amnesty program can ensure the\nsuccessful reintegration of ex-militants back into their soci-\nety, as well as, whether and how the empowerment process\nof ex-militants can stimulate peace and development in post-\nconflict Niger Delta.\nTheoretical Underpinnings\nConflicts caused by competition for oil and petroleum prod-\nucts, unjust exploitation of resources, environmental degra-\ndation, and violence all have their roots in the quest to control\nresources, thus engendering poverty, inequality, and injus-\ntice. The Niger Delta conflict is a clear example of conflict,\nwhich emanated from struggles over oil and the unjust and\nexploitative tendencies of both state and non-state players in\nthe oil industry in Nigeria, resulting in widespread poverty,\nenvironmental degradation, violence, and militancy.\nThe causes of violence and militancy in the Niger Delta\ncan be attributed to triangulation (Okonofua, 2013).\nTriangulation can be used to explain the reasons for the\ninvolvement of youths in violence and militancy in the\nregion. It occurs in family studies \"when two people in a\nfamily bring in a third party to dissolve stress, anxiety or ten-\nsion that exists between them\" (Charles, 2001, in Okonofua,\n2013). It is a technique and process used for\ntransforming a 2-person, 2-group or person--group conflict into\na positive \"friend\" interaction and relationship by identifying a\n3rd element in the interaction that can serve as a \"target\" or\nfocus toward which all negative feelings or expectations can be\nTriangulation originated from the study of dysfunctional\nfamily setups, but can also be applicable to the study of\nbehavior in other setups such as workplace and conflict\nsituations.\nApplying triangulation to the Niger Delta conflict sug-\ngests the involvement of more powerful third-party stake-\nholders in the conflict. This suggests that the youths were\npawns of these stakeholders who initially used them to pros-\necute their political ambitions. Okonofua (2013) states that\nthese youths who were recruited from the creeks were used\nas paid political supporters at political events.\nTriangulation is also important to the conflict because it\nhelps to explain how dysfunctional family systems contrib-\nuted to the upsurge in violence and militancy in the region.\nThe activities of IOCs and their workers negatively affected\nthe host communities and their peoples in different ways. For\ninstance, it is reported that the traditional roles of women in\nthe Niger Delta was to sustain their families through farm-\ning, fishing, and trading, all of which have become extremely\ndifficult on account of oil exploration and exploitation. The\nconsequence of this is that their economies are affected, and\nprostitution became a means of survival for many (Iwuoha,\nNiger Delta is directly linked to the petroleum industry since\nit is petroleum company employees and the employees of\npetroleum related service companies that patronize the pros-\ntitutes.\" The direct fallout of this sex industry is that there are\na lot of children sired by expatriates in the region, and more\nimportantly, the rate of abandonment of these children is\nvery high, thus contributing to the lop-sidedness of the fam-\nily system in the region and giving rise to poverty among the\npeople.\nYouths who often get involved in militancy and violence\ninclude those \"who have no parents, youths who have\nextremely poor parents (such that parents lose control over\ntheir kids) and uneducated and unemployed youths desperate\nfor some kind of subsistence\" (Okonofua, 2013).\nCorroborating this position on parentless and poor youths\nand violence and militancy in the Niger Delta is this state-\nment from an ex-commandant, also in Okonofua (2013):\nIt's easy for some youths to be sucked into the whole militancy\ngame. Many of these boys fend for themselves. They have no\neducation . . . They have no rich father or mother or uncle to look\nup to. Many of them have no parents.\nOther theories also suggest that conflicts in the Niger\nDelta are caused by environmental factors. Scholars have\nsince established that the environment can be a source of\nKlare, 2001). The Niger Delta environment in which IOCs\noperate has become a source of conflict because of the activi-\nties of these companies, which have negatively affected the\npeople. These activities have resulted in economic losses as\nwell as other health and social challenges and pushed the\npeople, especially the youths, into resorting to violence and\nmilitancy.\nview states that \"eco-demographic pressures have created\nnumerous emergencies within African states, including pov-\nerty and malnourishment, and these challenges have forced\nmany African societies into acts of violence.\" The peoples of\n4 SAGE Open\nthe Niger Delta have been forced into acts of violence\nbecause of the unjust exploitation of their environment,\nwhich has affected their sources of livelihood, thus leading to\nwidespread poverty in the region.\nHowever, although some scholars believe that violence in\nthe region is a result of the unjust exploitation of the environ-\nment and its consequences on the lives of the people, others\nattribute violence in the region to greed (Collier, 2000; Keen,\nconflicts in Africa are caused more by greed than by griev-\nance (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004). They posit that armed con-\nflicts are mainly caused by the desire of militants to enrich\nthemselves rather than any altruistic reasons. Greed in con-\nflict is fueled by opportunities available in armed conflict.\nThese opportunities may be in terms of financing, recruit-\nment, or geography. Of relevance to this article is the issue of\nrecruitment as an element of greed in armed conflict--this is\nin terms of the ability to attract fighting manpower; \"some-\nthing made easier when there is a high proportion of young\nunemployed males in a population, in a setting of endemic\n595). In the Niger Delta, majority of the perpetrators of vio-\nlence are able-bodied youths who have no source of income,\nare not educated, and have not gone through any form of\nskills training.\nDavid Keen (2000) does not support the position of\nCollier and Hoeffler (2004) that greed is the major fuel for\narmed conflicts, but that both greed and grievance are moti-\nvations for armed conflict. He says that that because the two\nare powerful incentives, the result is that \"greed generates\ngrievance and rebellion, which in turn further legitimizes\nNiger Delta is a continuous cycle of both greed and griev-\nance. The grievance of the people toward IOCs and the\nNigerian state has resulted in the \"struggle\" being hijacked\nby their leaders who exploited it to their own advantage.\nThe grievances exploited include injustices meted out to the\npeople and exploitation of host communities by oil companies\noperating in the region; anger at the force and military action\nused by the Federal Government of Nigeria against the people\nof the region; desire for the creation of a distinct region with a\npolitical and administrative structure for the Niger Delta; and\nthe desire for total control of their resources, with appropriate\ntax paid to the federal government (Isumonah, 2003).\nIn checking restiveness in the communities, the federal\ngovernment employed the use of force and deployed security\nstates,\nIn 2003, in an operation titled Operation Restore Hope, the\nFederal Government of Nigeria set up a task force, the Joint\nTask Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta to safeguard oil production,\nsecure oil installations, crush community protest and deal with\nany activities of the oil companies or personnel within the oil\nindustry.\nThis drew the ire of youths in the region who were aggrieved at\nthe high-handedness of government.\nHowever, despite the fact that the people had legitimate\nreasons for their grievances, these factors are closely related\nto greed, especially the desire by stakeholders to benefit per-\nsonally from new opportunities that open from the \"strug-\ngle.\" An ex-combatant says in Okonofua (2013),\nLet no one be deceived, it is all about oil. If there is a separation\nbetween political power and oil, a lot of Niger Delta politicians\nwill not contest elections and there will be no militancy.\nMilitancy is the child of greedy and corrupt politicians who will\nstop at nothing to make money for themselves, their families,\nand their friends.\nWhat this suggests is that the militancy in the Niger Delta\nregion is fueled by corrupt politicians who use the excuse of\nenvironmental degradation and exploitation to incite youths\nto further their own ambitions and interests.\nMethod\nThe study employed the use of both qualitative and quantita-\ntive methods. The use of this mixed-method approach incor-\nporating semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) and a\nstructured questionnaire is the only way to understand the\ndeeply complex Niger Delta conflict and the amnesty pro-\ngram. Six semi-structured IDI sessions were conducted with\nex-militants on the Amnesty Scholarship Program in1 pri-\nvately owned Nigerian tertiary institutions to get their views\nabout the amnesty program as a veritable DDR tool and the\nimportance of empowerment of the delegates to lasting peace\nand development in the delta region.\nThe structured questionnaire comprised 16 questions,\ndivided into 2 sections. Section A had three questions that\nfocused mainly on the gender, age, and educational qualifi-\ncation of respondents. These variables are germane to the\nstudy because the amnesty program is basically targeted at\nyouths in the Niger Delta. The other 13 questions examined\nrespondents' perception of the amnesty program, the DDR\nprocess, and the importance of empowerment to the success-\nful rehabilitation of ex-militants.\nA total of 100 questionnaires were administered to\nrespondents; out of these, 50 were administered to youths\nin the amnesty program in privately owned universities.\nThe choice of youths in privately owned university was\nhinged on the fact that one of the elements of the DDR pro-\ngram is educational empowerment for ex-militants, and\nmajority of them were awarded scholarships to study at pri-\nvately owned universities in Nigeria. The remaining 50\nquestionnaires were administered to youths who are indi-\ngenes of Niger Delta resident outside the region (in Ibadan).\nThis category of respondents was chosen because they are\nyouths of Niger Delta origin who also have a stake in the\nfuture stability of the region. It aimed to find out whether\ntheir opinions on the amnesty program, the DDR process,\nand the importance of empowerment of youths to peace and\ndevelopment deviated from the reasons for setting up the\nprogram and the views of the direct beneficiaries, that is,\nex-militants.\nNinety-eight copies of the questionnaire were retrieved,\nmaking it 98% retrieval rate. One copy out of the 98 was\nrendered invalid because it was improperly filled. The data\nwere analyzed using the descriptive statistics and presented\nusing graphs and diagrams. Thematic analysis was per-\nformed on the qualitative data (which includes secondary\nopen source data), and the results were used to frame the\ndiscussion of findings, becoming the basis for the qualitative\nanalysis. In other words, the results of the qualitative study\nwere tested with the quantitative study, which helped to\nstrengthen the overall findings and conclusions of the study.\nFinally, the results of the qualitative and quantitative studies\nwere combined at the initial stage by the theoretical dis-\ncourse and later by the methodological approach known as\ntriangulation, which helped to anchor both the findings and\ndiscussion of findings.\nBrief Literature Review\nPrevious Approaches to the Niger Delta Problem\nThe Nigerian government had tried to address the problems\nin the Niger Delta, before the problems escalated to conflict\nand violence, prior to the intervention by the Yar'adua gov-\nernment in 2009. The report of the Technical Committee on\nthe Niger Delta (The Niger Delta Technical Committee\nReport [NTDC] Report, 2008) highlights some previous\nreports of committees and interventions.

This master plan was\nbased on the inputs of stakeholders and experts in 25 sectors\nof the region's economy. It aimed to encourage economic\ngrowth, infrastructural development, and the peculiar needs\nof communities and environmental preservation for the\ndevelopmental transformation of the region (Kuku, 2012).\nIn 2008, the NTDC was set up by the Yar'adua government.\nIt was chaired by Ledum Mitee, the leader of the MOSOP. The\nrecommendations made by the committee are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 An increase of derivation from the present 13% to 25%\nand dedication of additional revenues largely to new\ninfrastructure and sustainable development of the region\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Open trial and bail for Henry Okah, a militant under\narrest\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Completion of the East\u00adWest road from Calabar to\nLagos, with at least one link road per state to the\ncoastline\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Payment of outstanding statutory funds owed to the\nNDDC\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Disarming process for the youths involved in mili-\ntancy through the creation of an enabling environment\nand the establishment of a credible DDR process with\nconfidence building measures put in place\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Rehabilitate all existing health care facilities and pro-\nvide free medical care for the vulnerable in the society\n(persons older than 65 years, children under 5 years,\nand pregnant women)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Rehabilitate and equip all existing public primary and\nsecondary schools and staff them with well-trained\nteachers\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The FGN should fully resettle all persons displaced\nfrom Bakassi and stop the ongoing dispersion of the\nBakassi people\nThe recommendations of the NTDC are germane to the\nsetting up of the amnesty program.\nThe Amnesty Program\nThe amnesty program for the Niger Delta derived from the\nrecommendations of the Presidential Panel on Amnesty and\nDisarmament of Militants in the Niger Delta. The panel was\nset up on May 5, 2009, to implement the recommendations\nmade by the NTDC regarding the granting of amnesty to\nNiger Delta militants. Subsequently, President Umaru\nAmnesty for the Niger Delta militants.\nThe proclamation relied heavily on powers vested in the\noffice of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as\n1. I hereby grant amnesty and unconditional pardon to\nall persons who have directly or indirectly partici-\npated in the commission of offenses associated with\nmilitant activities in the Niger Delta.\n2. The pardon shall take effect on the surrender and\nhanding over of all equipment, weapons, arms, and\nammunition, and execution of the renunciation of\nmilitancy forms specified in the schedule hereto, by\nthe affected persons at the nearest collection center\nestablished for the purpose of government in each of\nthe Niger Delta states.\n3.

However, the DDR component\nhas direct bearing on stability and peace in the Niger Delta.\nThe DDR Process\nThe DDR process started with the disarmament phase. This\ninvolved the voluntary surrendering of arms by ex-militants.\nBoyloaf from Bayelsa State was the first militant leader to\nembrace the amnesty program, followed by others, and\ntant agitators had accepted the offer of Amnesty and handed\nin their firearms and ammunition which were in excess of\nThe disarming phase was followed by comprehensive pro-\ngrams such as workshops and incentives aimed at positively\ntransforming the ex-militants. The Kernigan and non-violent\nprogram that took place in Calabar in 2009 focused on coun-\nseling and attitudinal change while agreements were signed at\nthe Obubra rehabilitation camp. Subsequently, the ex-militants\nbecame known as the amnesty program delegates.\nThe amnesty agreement reached made allowances for the\ndelegates to be given a monthly stipend, the opportunity to\nlive as free citizens, and contest (political participation) and\nfreedom to travel out of the country if they so wished. They\nalso have the opportunity to undergo educational or voca-\ntional training, depending on their preference, and these were\neither within or outside the country.\nResults and Discussion of Findings\nThere have been a number of previous approaches to the\nNiger Delta problem, before the current intervention. These\nhave been highlighted in other sections of this article.\nHowever, a major area in which the amnesty program appears\nto be different from these other approaches is the introduc-\ntion of educational and skills training (empowerment) for the\namnesty delegates. It is important to note that the Niger Delta\nstruggle was majorly spearheaded by unemployed youths in\nthe region.\nYouth can be a phase or time when someone is young. It\ncan also be a young person within a specific age range gener-\nally believed to be between 18 and 35. Youth, according to\nthe United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), is\na period of transition from the dependence of childhood to the\nindependenceofadulthoodandawarenessofourinterdependence\nas members of a community. A youth is a person between the\nage where he/she leaves compulsory education, and the age at\nwhich he/she finds his/her employment (www.unesco.org/new/\nen/social-and-human.../youth-definition/ ).\nWith this description of youth, it shows that youth is actually not\nrestricted to age.\nThe involvement of youths in militancy and violence in\nthe Niger Delta can be traced to powerful stakeholders within\nthe conflict zone who hid under the guise of the \"struggle\" to\nbrainwash young, unemployed youths in the region to fight\nfor what were regarded as genuine grievances by the youths\nbut a means of self-enrichment for their leaders. A respon-\nLet me tell you, for many years we fought someone else's war.\nThey gave us the guns and the bombs. They mark the targets and\ntell us when to attack . . .

All those years; we fought their war thinking\nthat we were fighting for ourselves and our children.\nIt can also be traced to the fact that there are many\nunemployed youths in the region who lacked academic and\nvocational skills to improve their lives and who, because\nthey were jobless, were ready to take arms against per-\nceived enemies of their communities--the IOCs and the\nNigerian state.\nThemes\nThe conflict is generally believed to be as a result of griev-\nances of the people. Both greed and grievance are motivators\nfor armed conflict (Keen, 2000). In this instance, grievance\nagainst the state was a major reason why youths in the region\ntook to arms. However, although some schools of thought\nbelieve that the conflict came up as a direct consequence of\nthe peoples'grievances, others say that greed cannot be sepa-\nrated from the struggle, especially because it is believed that\nmost resource-based conflicts in Africa are caused more by\ngreed than by grievance (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004). Greed in\nconflict is fueled by opportunities available in armed con-\nflict. And in the instance of the Niger Delta crisis, opportuni-\nties in terms of recruitment and resources abound because of\nthe allure crude and the availability of able-bodied young\npeople who are poor and who come from dysfunctional\nbackgrounds to be used as instruments of violence. Okonofua\nIt's easy for some youths to be sucked into the whole militancy\ngame. Many of these boys fend for themselves. They have no\neducation . . . They have no rich father or mother or uncle to look\nup to. Many of them have no parents.\nIf the empowerment process fails, there will be more\nthan enough manpower to prosecute violence in the\nregion. A respondent says, \"About 80 percent of the ex-\nmilitants have not been carried along. There are still many\nthat have not benefited from the program.\" If these 80%\ngo back to the creeks, or if they are employed by more\npowerful third-party stakeholders in the guise of continu-\ning the \"struggle,\" then there is no hope for peace in the\nregion.\nA recent survey conducted by the researcher with benefi-\nciaries of the amnesty program and young people of Niger\nDelta extraction shows that the people believe that the con-\nflict is majorly about resource control (62.8%) and develop-\nment (77.6%), and development in this instance includes\nenvironmental security and empowerment (57.4%). The sur-\nvey also indicates that (79%) respondents believe that the\namnesty program addressed the agitation of the people of the\nregion (Figure 2).\nEnvironmental security has also been adduced to be a\nmajor source of conflict and violence (Homer-Dixon, 1999;\nhealth, and social challenges as it has been the case for the\npeople of Niger Delta.\n8 SAGE Open\nPeace and Development\nOpinions are almost divided equally about the amnesty pro-\ngram as it is currently implemented being able to sustain\npeace and development in post-conflict Niger Delta.\nRespondents who believe that it will help achieve sustain-\nable peace are 48%, whereas those who do not believe it will\nhelp achieve sustainable peace and development are 46%\n(Field Survey: 2014). Reasons given for either stand are\nwide and multi-faceted. Respondents believe it will help\nachieve sustainable peace basically because of the DDR pro-\ncess. The DDR process involved counseling and training\nworkshops to re-orientate ex-militants, the voluntary sub-\nmission of arms by ex-militants, and the withdrawal of these\narms from circulation, provision of monetary incentive,\nempowerment programs (education and skills acquisition),\nand the provision of job opportunities for ex-militants in the\nfuture.\nAll these things have led to the positive transformation of\nthe conflict. As it stands presently, violence has reduced\ndrastically in the region.\nOther respondents who do not share the opinion of the\nprevious group gave reasons why the amnesty program can-\nnot spur sustained peace and development in the region as\ncorruption in the process (respondents claim that the process\nhad been hijacked by politicians and funds siphoned through\nthe programme); it is only one component in the program,\nthat is, the DDR, that is effective; the other components that\naddress infrastructural development, environmental degra-\ndation, and petroleum have not been tackled with as much\nseriousness as it had been done with the DDR component. It\nis believed that the Niger Delta conflict is not about mili-\ntancy in the region but about core developmental issues as it\naffects the daily existence of the people. Other reasons given\nare that not all the ex-militants benefitted from it, and there\nare still about 80% ex-militants who were excluded. What\nthis portends is that, because the program revolves basically\nround the ex-militants, the 80% that have been excluded\nmight take up arms in the nearest future and at the slightest\nexcuse.\nEducational and Vocational Skills Training\nThe reason for embarking on educational and vocational\nskills training as rehabilitation and socialization strategies in\nthe amnesty program (Figure 3) is because, according to a\nrespondent, \"it is only through education and skills training\nthat the Niger Delta people can be truly and fully empow-\nered.\" With education and skills acquisition, a majority of the\nyouths will become gainfully employed on graduation, and\nthey will be able to provide for themselves and their families.\nThe provision of educational and vocational skills will also\nkeep Niger Delta youths busy and out of the clutches of pow-\nerful third-party stakeholders who normally use them to\nprosecute their own political and personal agenda.\nMaking use of both education and vocational skills acqui-\nsition as instruments of rehabilitation and reintegration of\nyouths is a positive in the DDR process; however, out of the\ntwo strategies, respondents prefer education (55.3%, skills\nalmost 70% chance of ex-militants getting good jobs on\nOf the respondents, 44.7% feel that empowerment of ex-\nmilitants will stimulate peace and development in post-con-\nflict Niger Delta as indicated in Figure 4 below. This is\nbecause presently, the level of violence in the region and\nmilitancy has decreased as a result of the intervention. The\nenergies of ex-militants who are the major beneficiaries have\nbeen re-channeled into other avenues. They have been\nengaged positively through the empowerment program.\nHowever, it should also be noted that the empowerment\nwill only work if opportunities for employment and setting\nup their own small scale businesses are provided after train-\ning. A respondent shares this view that \"provision of jobs for\nYes No No Response\nFigure 2. Amnesty program addresses the agitations of the\nNiger Delta.\nSource.

Other areas pertaining to the development\nof the region, which are very fundamental to the problem,\nhave not been addressed. It is also believed that the program\nis selective, in that it catered only to ex-militants rather than\nto the generality of youths in the region; environmental chal-\nlenges such as gas flaring and improving the lives of the\npeople in the Niger Delta have not been addressed, and alle-\ngations of corruption have dogged the entire amnesty pro-\ngram. The only area that the intervention addressed is\nmilitancy, and it did not extend to all the ex-militants in the\nregion. This is a major potential problem because other ex-\nmilitants who have not benefitted from the program might\nonce again resort to violence and militancy to attract atten-\ntion and get what they want from the federal government and\nmulti-national oil companies operating in the region. So,\nfrom that perspective, the empowerment of ex-militants is\nnot enough to stimulate peace and development in post-con-\nflict Niger Delta.\nCorruption\nCorruption has been identified as one of the reasons the\nempowerment process of the DDR component might not\nwork. Of the respondents, 72.4% believe that it will not\nwork, whereas 29.6% feel that it might work.\nThe program has been dogged by allegations of corrup-\ntion leveled against some top ranking officials in government\nand the fact that the amnesty agreement between the govern-\nment and ex-militants was signed by the ex-generals on\nbehalf of the militants, and a majority of the militants were\nnot privy to the content or details of the agreement, espe-\ncially the part that pertains to the empowerment process does\nnot indicate transparency in the process. This supports the\nposition of Collier and Hoeffler (2004) that greed is the moti-\nvating factor for armed conflict, especially in the Niger\nDelta. These scholars believe that armed conflicts are mainly\ncaused by the desire of militants to enrich themselves rather\nthan any altruistic reasons.\nConclusion\nThis article examined the role of the empowerment process\nin the DDR component of the amnesty program on the suc-\ncessful reintegration and rehabilitation of ex-militants in the\nregion. According to Ball and van de Goor (2006), DDR is\n\"the process of demilitarizing official and unofficial armed\ngroups by controlling and reducing the possession of arms,\nby disbanding non-state armed groups and rightsizing state\nsecurity services and by assisting former combatants to rein-\ntegrate into civilian life\" (www.clingendael.nl/sites/default/\nmission by Ball and van de Goor, the DDR component of the\nprogram was used to disarm, rehabilitate, and reintegrate\nmilitant youths in the region. The inclusion of the empower-\nment of ex-militants in the component has direct bearing on\npeace and stability in the region because DDR is used to con-\nsolidate peace and to promote stability within conflict-\naffected communities.\nAs shown in the findings, youths were the perpetrators of\nviolence and militancy in the Niger Delta, and their involve-\nment can be traced to the influence of powerful third-party\nstakeholders in the region. These powerful stakeholders,\nwhich included politicians and elites, incited youths to take\nup arms against IOCs and Nigerian State. Okonofua (2013)\ndiscusses this as triangulation to include the deliberate inser-\ntion of youths into stakeholder political and economic\ndisagreements.\nApplying triangulation to the Niger Delta conflict sug-\ngests that youths involved in militancy were victims of more\npowerful third-party stakeholders who initially used these\nyouths for political brigandage. Triangulation also helps\nexplain how dysfunctional family systems in the Niger Delta\ncontributed to the upsurge in militant activities in the region.\nIwuoha (2012) notes that the activities of oil companies\noperating in the region and their staff have negatively\naffected the family system in the region. These activities\nmade a number of women and young girls go into prostitu-\ntion. \"The sex industry in Niger Delta is directly linked to the\npetroleum industry since it is petroleum company employees\nand the employees of petroleum related service companies\nwomen and young girls often gave birth to children for expa-\ntriates, many of whom were abandoned. These children often\ngrew up to become instruments of terror and violence, and as\nYes No Partially No Response\nFigure 4. Empowerment will stimulate peace and development\nin post-conflict Niger Delta.\nSource. Ajibola I.O.: Field Survey 2014.\nOkonofua (2013) says, youths who often get involved in\nmilitancy and violence include those \"who have no parents,\nyouths who have extremely poor parents (such that parents\nlose control over their kids) and uneducated and unemployed\nyouths desperate for some kind of subsistence.\"\nThe involvement of youths in militancy can also be traced\nto the fact that the region is populated by many unemployed\nyouths who lack academic and vocational skills to improve\ntheir lives. The DDR component has tried to address this by\nproviding academic and vocational training opportunities for\nvulnerable youths in the region.\nOther findings indicate that the DDR component is rela-\ntively successful, despite the shortcoming highlighted by\nOkonofua (2013) where he states that the \"Niger Delta DDR\ncomponent of the Amnesty Programme might not achieve\nthe desired results which stakeholders expect or desire\nbecause it failed to address the causes of the conflict.\" The\nDDR component, however, has been able to address areas of\ncounseling and training, re-orientate ex-militant, facilitate\nthe voluntary submission of arms by ex-combatants and the\nwithdrawal of these arms from circulation, and put an\nempowerment process in place. This has spurred the de-\nescalation of violence in the region. There are concerns,\nhowever, that the empowerment process might not fully\nachieve its objectives if employment opportunities are not\nprovided for these ex-combatants after their training. If the\nempowerment process fails, then youths in the region might\nrevert to violence and militancy.\nThere are also concerns that many of the ex-combatants\nhave not been catered for by the program. A respondent says,\n\"About 80 percent of the ex-militants have not been carried\nalong. There are still many that have not benefited from the\nprogram.\" If these 80% go back to the creeks, or if they are\nemployed by more powerful third-party stakeholders in the\nguise of continuing the \"struggle,\" then there is no hope for\npeace in the region.\nRespondents also allege that core developmental issues in\nthe region, which led to the aggravation of conflict, have not\nbeen addressed. Theories underscore the importance of envi-\nronmental factors to resource conflicts (Homer-Dixon, 1999;\nties of IOCs had negative effects on the delta people and their\nrates this statement when he states, \"eco-demographic\npressures have created numerous emergencies withinAfrican\nstates, including poverty and malnourishment, and these\nchallenges have forced many African societies into acts of\nviolence.\"\nBecause environmental factors also contributed to mili-\ntancy in the region, it is important to nip in the bud issues\npertaining to environmental degradation and underdevelop-\nment in the region that might make youths revert to militancy\nand violence.\nBased on the above, this article submits that the empower-\nment process of the DDR component has contributed to the\npartial successes recorded in the reintegration and rehabilita-\ntion of ex-militants in the Niger Delta. However, the reinte-\ngration and rehabilitation can only be considered fully\nsuccessful if there is no recourse to violence and militancy in\nthe region. To fully achieve peace and stability in the region,\nex-militants undergoing training must be provided with\nopportunities for gainful employment and enabling environ-\nments to apply their acquired vocational skills after training,\nthe influence of powerful third-party stakeholders in the\nregion must be whittled down, the impact of political control\non the empowerment activities of ex-militants must be inves-\ntigated and addressed, core developmental issues pertaining\nto environmental degradation and infrastructural develop-\nment which might make youths return to militancy should, as\na matter of urgency be addressed.\nThere is still need for further research because of the con-\nstantly changing contexts of the conflict. It will be ideal to\ninvestigate the consequences of political control, monetiza-\ntion, contracting of pipeline security to ex-militants and\npolitical contestation to the success of the amnesty program,\nand by extension, the future peace and stability of the Niger\nDelta.\n"
