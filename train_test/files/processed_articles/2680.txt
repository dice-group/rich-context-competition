Small\nstudies suggest high, and increasing, prevalence especially in urban areas, with poor detection and management, but\nnational data has been lacking. The aim of the current study was to use nationally-representative survey data to examine\nsocio-demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and management of hypertension in Indian adults.\nMethods: Using data on self-reported diagnosis and treatment, and blood pressure measurement, collected from 12,198\nrespondents aged 18+ in the 2007 WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in India, factors associated with\nprevalence, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension were investigated.\nResults: 22% men and 26% women had hypertension; prevalence increased steeply with body mass index (,18.5 kg/m2:\nusing alcohol (1.96 (1.40 to 2.76)). Over half the hypertension in women, and 70% in men, was undetected with particularly\npoor detection rates in young urban men, and in poorer households. Two-thirds of men and women with detected\nhypertension were treated. Two-thirds of women treated had their hypertension controlled, irrespective of urban/rural\nsetting or wealth. Adequate blood pressure control was sub-optimal in urban men.\nConclusion: Hypertension is very common in India, even among underweight adults and those of lower socioeconomic\nposition. Improved detection is needed to reduce the burden of disease attributable to hypertension. Levels of treatment\nand control are relatively good, particularly in women, although urban men require more careful attention.\nCitation: Moser KA, Agrawal S, Davey Smith G, Ebrahim S (2014) Socio-Demographic Inequalities in the Prevalence, Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension\nEditor: Yiru Guo, University of Louisville, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2014 Moser et al.

Moser1*, Sutapa Agrawal2, George Davey Smith3, Shah Ebrahim1,2\n1 Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom, 2 South Asia Network for Chronic Disease,\nPublic Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India, 3 School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom\n Introduction\nHypertension is a major contributing factor to the current\nepidemic of cardiovascular disease in India and many other low-\nand middle-income countries [1,2]. The global burden of\nhypertension was estimated to be close to 1 billion adults in\nWorldwide, in excess of 7 million deaths annually may be\nattributable to hypertension [4] which is the third most important\ncause of the global burden of disease [5]. There is marked\nvariation in levels of mean systolic blood pressure between\ncountries, with highest levels evident in low- and middle-income\ncountries, and a small decrease in mean systolic blood pressure\nglobally since 1980, although the trends varied across regions [6].\nHypertension tends to be inversely related to socioeconomic\nposition in high income countries [7] with the opposite often being\nthe case in low- and middle-income countries [8]. Only in the later\nstages of the epidemiological transition does the burden of chronic\ndisease including hypertension shift from higher to lower\nsocioeconomic groups [2,9]. A high and increasing prevalence of\nhypertension in both rural and urban areas of India has been\nreported in recent studies [10,11] with higher prevalence in urban\nthan rural areas and intermediate levels among migrants [12].\nDetection and effective management of hypertension decreases\nthe risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease\nand heart failure. Knowledge about the prevalence and social\npatterning of hypertension is essential for informing the public\nhealth effort to control hypertension in the community. In the US\nand other high-income countries in the 1970s what has become\nknown as `the rule of halves' found that only half of adults with\nhypertension were diagnosed, only half of those diagnosed were\ntreated, and only half of those treated were well controlled [13,14].\nWhile detection and treatment has improved in many high-income\ncountries over recent decades good control remains low [15,16].\nRecent small scale and local studies show that the rule of halves\napplies in India where detection, treatment and control of\nhypertension remain inadequate [11,17\u00ad19]. However there is an\nurgent need for national data to confirm the situation. With the\ncurrent epidemic in chronic disease, primarily affecting older\npeople, the gap in the evidence base has become only too\napparent. The nationally-representative surveys conducted in the\nWHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)\nprogramme (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/cohorts/en/\nindex2.html) are beginning to fill this gap by collecting detailed\ninformation on the health and well-being of adult populations and\nthe ageing process [20,21]. Using self-reports of hypertension\ndiagnosis and treatment, in addition to blood pressure measure-\nment, from the 2007 SAGE survey in India, we examined socio-\ndemographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and\nmanagement of hypertension in Indian adults and assessed `the\nrule of halves' for detection, treatment and control.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nEthical approval was not required for this analysis of\nanonymised secondary data. The 2007 SAGE Wave 1 survey of\nIndia received approval from the review board of the International\nInstitute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, India. Respondents\nprovided informed consent to participate in the survey. A standard\nconsent form, approved by the World Health Organization ethics\nreview committee, was read to the respondent in the respondent's\nlanguage. If the respondent agreed to participate in the survey,\nand if s/he was literate, the form was provided to him/her to\nperuse and sign and was countersigned by the interviewer. If the\nrespondent was illiterate and gave consent to participate, the\ninterviewer confirmed this consent and signed on the form that the\nform had been read to the respondent, that s/he had understood\nthe study and had agreed to participate. This procedure was\napproved by the review board of the International Institute for\nPopulation Sciences.\nThis analysis uses data collected in the 2007 SAGE Wave 1\nsurvey of India (conducted by the International Institute for\nPopulation Sciences, Mumbai with the World Health Organiza-\ntion, Geneva). The SAGE survey took representative samples of\nsix states in India (Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,\nUttar Pradesh and West Bengal) which can be modelled to a\nnationally representative sample. The survey consisted of a large\nsample of people aged 50 years and older and a smaller\ndescribed in full elsewhere [20,22] and the questionnaires can be\nfound at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/cohorts/en/index2.html\npublic domain at the same location.\nThe survey includes 3 types of information on hypertension.\n1. Blood pressure (BP) measurement at physical examination,\nmeasured in the left wrist using a Boso Medistar Wrist Blood\nPressure Monitor Model S (which avoids the need for different\ncuff sizes necessary with blood pressure measured in the upper\narm). Validation studies of similar wrist blood pressure\nmonitoring devices indicate they are capable of providing\naccurate measurements [23,24] but that the position of the arm\nin relation to the heart is critical (http://www.bhsoc.org/bp-\nmonitors/bp-monitors/). Respondents were asked to remain\nseated with legs uncrossed, positioning their arm level with\ntheir heart, taking 3 deep slow breaths before measurement\nstarted and then remaining relaxed and still while their BP was\nTable 1.

Later in the interview respondents were asked: Have you ever\nbeen diagnosed with high BP (hypertension)?\n3. Those answering `yes' were asked: Have you been taking any\nmedications or other treatment for it during a) the last 2 weeks?\nb) the last 12 months? (The questionnaire stated `Other\ntreatment might include weight loss program or change in\neating habits').\nWe calculated mean systolic and diastolic BP using all three BP\nreadings and where systolic . = 140 mmHg and/or diastolic\n. = 90 mmHg respondents were classified as having high BP at\nexam in accordance with guidelines [25]. We defined hypertension\nas high BP at exam and/or self-reported diagnosis; this included\nall those on treatment as only respondents reporting diagnosis\nwere asked about treatment. Treatment was defined as being on\nmedication or other treatment in the past 12 months. For\nrespondents reporting diagnosis, or diagnosis and treatment, we\nexamined whether their hypertension was controlled, defined as\nsystolic BP ,140 mmHg and diastolic ,90 mmHg. The rule of\nhalves for detection, treatment and control was assessed by\nsplitting hypertension into the following proportions i) undiag-\nnosed and uncontrolled (i.e. high BP at exam, but diagnosis not\nreported), ii) diagnosed but uncontrolled (i.e. high BP, diagnosis\nreported), and iii) controlled (i.e. diagnosis reported, BP not high).\nBoth ii) and iii) were further sub-divided into those reporting being\non treatment or not.\nSocio-demographic and risk factors considered were respon-\ndents' area of residence (urban; rural); age; sex; religion (Hindu;\nMuslim; other religion); caste (scheduled tribe; scheduled caste;\nother backward caste; other); highest level of education completed\n(no formal education; less than primary school; primary school\ncompleted; secondary school completed; high school (or equiva-\nlent) completed; above high school); body mass index (BMI,\nheight and weight measurements where both values were non-\nmissing; alcohol consumption (recent use (in last 30 days), used but\nnot recently, never used); household wealth index (provided in\ndataset, derived using WHO standard approach to estimating\npermanent income from survey data on household ownership of\ndurable goods, neighbourhood and dwelling characteristics, and\naccess to water, sanitation, electricity etc [27]).\nSurvey response was high with 92% of the eligible persons\ncontacted completing the interviews. Respondents with complete\ninterviews and complete hypertension data were included in the\nanalysis. Hypertension data was considered complete if the\nrespondent had all three BP measurements and had answered\nyes or no when asked if ever diagnosed with high BP\n(hypertension). We examined whether respondents with complete\nhypertension data differed from those with incomplete hyperten-\nsion data.\nOutcome variables were mean systolic and diastolic BP, high BP\nat examination, self-reported diagnosis and treatment of hyper-\ntension, any indication of hypertension (that is, high BP at exam\nand/or self-reported diagnosis of hypertension), and control of\nhypertension. We explored the association between outcome\nvariables and age, sex and other socio-demographic characteris-\ntics. Age-standardisation was conducted using the United Nations\n2005 population of India (both sexes combined) as the standard\n[28]. Associations with socio-demographic characteristics were\nexamined using linear regression for mean BP adjusted for age and\nsocio-demographic variables, and logistic regression for the\nprevalence of hypertension adjusted for age. STATA statistical\nsoftware version 10.0 was used. The analysis took account of the\ncluster sampling design. Supplied weighting factors were used\nthroughout the analysis, including the regression analyses, to\ncorrect for the unequal probability of selection resulting from the\nsampling design. Detailed information on the survey weighting is\navailable at http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/surveydata/\nindex.php/catalog/65#page = sampling&tab = study-desc.

The mean age was 41\nyears, with over two-thirds living in rural areas. One-third of either\nof men had a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or above. Two-thirds of men and\n99% of women reported never consuming alcohol.\nIn general, findings for mean diastolic BP mirrored those of\nsystolic BP so only systolic BP data are shown in Table 2. Mean\nsystolic BP increased with age for both sexes, with a steeper and\nsmoother gradient in women than men. After full adjustment,\nmean systolic BP increased with BMI in both sexes, and recent\nusers of alcohol had higher mean BP than never users. No wealth\ndifferentials were apparent in either sex. While no urban-rural\ndifferential was apparent in women, in men systolic BP was higher\nin urban than rural residents by 4.4 mmHg which attenuated after\nfull adjustment to 3.2 mmHg.\nThe age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was 23% in\nmen and 26% in women increasing, in both sexes, with age from\nmen, hypertension was more prevalent in urban than rural areas\n(age-standardised prevalence, 28% vs. 21%) with the age-adjusted\nto 2.38) times that of men in rural areas.

In men, the odds of having hypertension was high in\n2.25)) users of alcohol compared with never users.\nTable 4 shows the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and control\nof hypertension by age and sex, with the rule of halves findings\nsummarised in Figure 1. In both sexes, the age-standardised\nprevalence of high BP at examination was around 19%, with the\nrate increasing from 10% under age 30 to around one-third at ages\n70 and over. The proportion of men with high BP at exam\nthose with high BP at exam reported being diagnosed with\nhypertension, with proportions particularly low at younger ages;\nnone of the men under 30 with high BP, and only 4% of those in\ntheir 30 s, reported being diagnosed. The situation was slightly\nbetter among women, but in no age group in either sex did the\nproportion of those with high BP reporting diagnosis exceed one-\nthird; this indicates detection rates far worse than the 50%\nsuggested by the rule of halves. Among both men and women\nreporting diagnosis with hypertension, two-thirds reported treat-\nment in the past 12 months; half the men and two-thirds of the\nwomen treated had their BP controlled.\nUrban-rural differences\nOne-quarter of urban men and 17% of rural men had high BP\nat examination, with no urban-rural differential observed in\nwomen (18%) (Table 5). The expected increase in prevalence of\nhigh BP with age was not apparent for urban men; a very high\nalthough these figures were based on relatively small numbers. A\ngreater proportion of those with high BP reported diagnosis in\nurban than rural areas (men: 18% urban, 11% rural; women:\n27%, 16%). Among men there was no urban-rural differential in\nthe proportion of those with any indication of hypertension who\nwere diagnosed, although in both settings, at around 30%,\ndetection rates were low (Figure 2). The situation was better for\nwomen. In either sex two-thirds of those diagnosed were treated,\nwith little evidence of an urban-rural differential. Control among\nthose treated was sub-optimal in urban men, only one-third of\nwhom had their BP controlled.\nWealth differences\nIn both sexes, the proportion reporting diagnosis of hyperten-\nsion showed marked positive gradients from poorest to least poor\nquintiles of household wealth (Table 6). The prevalence of high BP\nat examination in men showed a less pronounced gradient and\namong women there was no gradient with household wealth.\nHowever, of those with high BP at exam the proportion reporting\ndiagnosis increased steeply with wealth (poorest: 3% men, 7%\nwomen; least poor: 26%, 29%). When considering any indication\nof hypertension, the proportion reporting diagnosis was twice as\nhigh in the least poor as the poorest quintile (39% vs. 19% men;\n56% vs. 25% women) (Table 6, Figure 3), but, excepting women in\nFigure 1.

Two-thirds of\nwomen reporting diagnosis were treated, and around two-thirds of\nthose treated had adequate BP control, regardless of household\nwealth. Treatment rates in men increased with household wealth,\nalthough control among those treated appeared better in poorer\nquintiles.\nDiscussion\nThese analyses indicate that over one-fifth of Indian adults had\nhypertension, most of which - half in women, 70% in men - went\nundetected and therefore remained untreated and uncontrolled.\nLess than one-quarter of adults with measured high BP were\naware of their condition, with diagnosis rates at younger ages\nparticularly bad. On the other hand the data suggest that of the\nhypertension that was detected, treatment rates, and control\namong those treated, generally exceeded 50% which, although\nsub-optimal, is comparable with the situation in more affluent\nThere were differentials across population groups. Although\nhypertension was particularly prevalent in the least poor and the\noverweight, prevalence in the poor and the underweight was also\nhigh. These findings do not support the idea that hypertension is a\ncondition only of affluence [29] and therefore of low priority for\nhealth and development programmes in India and other low- and\nmiddle-income countries. The lack of the usual age gradient in the\nprevalence of measured high BP in men is surprising. In our study\nrecent alcohol use was much higher in underweight than\noverweight men, in rural than urban areas, and highest among\nmen in their 30 s and 40 s. This, and other recent exposures such\nas increased dietary salt intake and low levels of physical activity in\nyounger people, may be contributing to our findings [30,31].\nThere were important differences between the sexes. The higher\noverall rates of diagnosis seen in women, especially those in urban\nlocations and in better off households, probably result from\ncontact with health services around childbearing. National Family\nattended an antenatal clinic for their most recent birth, and 64%\nof attendees had their BP measured [32]; attendance was much\nless common in rural than urban areas, and in poorer households,\nas was the proportion of attendees who had their BP measured.\nOur data show for women, but not men, a lack of patterning of\ntreatment and control of hypertension across urban-rural or\nhousehold wealth categories suggesting that the quality of care is\nmore of an issue for men than women. The failure to detect\nhypertension in younger men, and the poor control in urban men,\nis of particular importance, suggesting a need for more proactive\nsurveillance.\nThese analyses, based on recent nationally-representative survey\ndata, provide up to date national estimates of the prevalence,\ndiagnosis, treatment and control of hypertension amongst adults in\nIndia. This is important new information as, to date, most\nevidence on hypertension, and chronic disease more generally, in\nIndia has come from small scale and/or local studies.\nThe SAGE survey has the strength of containing blood pressure\nmeasurements and self-reported information on diagnosis and\ntreatment of hypertension thus providing the opportunity to\ncompare and contrast clinical measurements with self-reported\ndata. The accuracy and reliability of Boso BP instruments, widely\nused in Germany, has been recognised by the German consumer\nsafety organisation with the Medistar S coming top in the wrist\ncategory and the German Hypertension Society also confirms\ntheir high accuracy [33]. Self-reported information may be\naffected by recall biases and reporting errors which may vary by\nsocio-demographic characteristics. As the survey question on\ntreatment did not differentiate taking medication, weight loss\nprogram or change in eating habits, it was not possible to identify\nthe subgroup taking hypertension medication, as recommended by\nthe JNC guidelines as a diagnostic criteria for hypertension [25].\nThe adequacy of assessing prevalence of high BP using measure-\nments made at a single clinic visit has been questioned [34] as it\ndoes not mirror clinical guidance of making repeated measure-\nments over several weeks in order to avoid regression to the mean\neffects. These effects lead to over-estimation of the prevalence of\nhigh BP as the within-person fluctuations in blood pressure will\ntend to underestimate the ``usual'' level of blood pressure [35].\nHowever, measurements made on a single occasion do have strong\npredictive power for cardiovascular disease in epidemiological\nFigure 2.

Tackling low detection\nrates is the priority as, once detected, the results indicate that rates\nof treatment and control of hypertension are relatively good.\nSubstantial effort \u00ad both in improving clinical practice and in\npreventing high BP in the first place - is needed to reduce the high\nrates of hypertension, and the resulting large burden of\ncardiovascular disease, in India.\n"
