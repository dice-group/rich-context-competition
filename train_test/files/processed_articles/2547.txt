These messages\nhave helped raise some public awareness about dis-\naster readiness but, overall, have not resulted in sig-\nnificant behavior change.1 In addition, as the number\nand costs associated with disaster increase, communi-\nties, and not simply individual households, are chal-\nlenged with making decisions about where to rebuild,\nhow to recover, and how to address readiness for the\nnext disaster. This recognition that whole community\nmust convene to develop integrated disaster plans and\nCopyright C 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\nprepare constituents for the magnitude and length of\nresponse and recovery is evidenced in national plan-\nning documents that call for community resilience\nand a heightened emphasis on community-level ca-\npacities and capabilities for disasters.2 For example,\nthe National Health Security Strategy asks communi-\nties to consider the extent to which they have strong\npartnerships across government and nongovernmental\norganizations.3 Other frameworks such as the National\nDisaster Recovery Framework or Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention's (CDC's) Public Health Emer-\ngency Preparedness Capabilities argue for community\ncapacity building, yet in all of these policy documents,\nthere is little information on the metrics that should or\ncould be used in monitoring and evaluating commu-\nnity capacity or readiness.4,5\nDisaster research suggests that there are several do-\nmains that capture aspects of community-level pre-\nparedness and serve as indicators of community\ncapacity.6 The ability of the community to collectively\nmarshal resources without external intervention is one\ncomponent (ie, self-sufficiency). Another is the com-\nmunity's ability to engage diverse stakeholder groups\nin meaningful ways across the disaster continuum (ie,\nstrong partnerships). Finally, recent disasters (eg, Hur-\nricane Sandy, Newtown) underscore the value of so-\ncial ties in supporting community recovery (ie, social\nconnectedness). In the following sections, we briefly\ndescribe the research in each core area.\nIndividuals on the scene are often the \"first respon-\nders\" to an incident and are capable of mobilizing\nquickly to prevent many negative impacts of disaster\n(eg, injury or death)7-9; thus, fostering individual and\ncommunity self-sufficiency is key to minimizing the\nAuthor Affiliation: RAND Corporation, Arlington, Virginia.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nCorrespondence: Lori Uscher-Pines, PhD, RAND Corporation, 1200 S Hayes\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Creating a more self-\nsufficient population can maximize a community's abil-\nity to leverage local resources and help minimize the\ndeployment of external aid, in many instances.10 Indi-\nvidual stockpiling and household emergency planning\nefforts are measures of self-sufficiency at the individual\nlevel, whereas postevent measures of requests for (and\ndeployment of) external assistance indicate whether a\ncommunity was self-sufficient. Current activities to in-\ncrease self-sufficiency can mitigate certain negative im-\npacts of disaster; therefore, measuring these activities\nand actions could help emergency planners gauge the\nlevel of resources that may be needed postdisaster and\nprioritize which behaviors and activities to further in-\ncentivize.\nEffective partnerships between and among govern-\nmental and nongovernmental organizations (eg, re-\ngional public health and health care coalitions) con-\ntribute to the overall preparedness of a community\nby maximizing participation in preparedness activities\nand increasing the volume and diversity of resources\n(by pooling them), including personnel, land resources,\nand in-kind assets.11 Effective partnerships can also\nhelp shore up critical infrastructure through memoran-\ndums of agreement prior to a disaster.10 The National\nHealth Security Strategy underscores the need for part-\nnerships in stating, \"The actions required to fully\nachieve community resilience are beyond the scope of a\nsingle department, policy, or level of government.\"3 In\naddition, the CDC's Public Health Cooperative Agree-\nment Performance Measures emphasize the impor-\ntance of partnerships with 2 performance measures that\ncapture the extent to which a diversity of organizations\nare involved in community preparedness and recovery\nefforts.12 Measures that assess both the diversity of par-\nticipation, such as the CDC measures, and the quality of\nthe partnership can suggest where additional partners\nneed to be engaged as well as where existing partner-\nships need to be strengthened.\nSocial connectedness, or the interconnectivity of indi-\nviduals and organizations in a community, contributes\nto a community's overall preparedness.10 These per-\nsonal and professional social networks can be ac-\ncessed by individuals in need of information and real\nor perceived social supports, as well as leveraged to\nquickly mobilize needed resources after a disaster.13-15\nLiving in a community with strong social connect-\nedness can improve survival chances and safety of\ncommunity residents during a disaster.16,17 Measur-\ning social connectedness could include assessments of\nneighbor-to-neighbor connections, connections of in-\ndividuals to organizations, or connections among key\nservice-providing organizations. Measuring both the\nabsence/presence of such networks as well as their\noverall structure (eg, where are the key communicators\nwithin these networks) can provide useful direction on\nwhere to broaden the reach of emergency communica-\ntions, how to leverage networks for information, and\nwho to engage in deeper partnership.\nDespite the recognition that these 3 core areas are\ncritical to evaluating the state of community prepared-\nness, to date, very little progress has been made on\nmeasurement. As with other areas of emergency pre-\nparedness research, the infrequency of disasters makes\nongoing measure development challenging (eg, creat-\ning robust predictive models and distinguish variables\nthat drive readiness).2\nFurthermore, inconsistent definitions of \"commu-\nnity\" have also contributed to a lack of clarity about\nhow to bound and assess community readiness or\npreparedness (eg, should measures be at the individ-\nual, household, organizational, or broader community\nlevel; should individual or household measures be ag-\ngregated to reflect resilience at the broader community\nlevel; and how do you define community [eg, by zip\ncode, county]?)18 Finally, there is growing recognition\nthat concepts such as engagement and social connect-\nedness are ambiguous and can be difficult to define and\noperationalize among practitioners, making measure-\nment challenging for researchers.\nTo help address these challenges in measurement\nand begin to set an agenda for future measure develop-\nment, this study aimed to identify existing measures of\npartnership, self-sufficiency, and social connectedness,\nas well as gaps and opportunities in the measurement\nof community preparedness and resilience. To accom-\nplish these aims, the study team conducted a broad en-\nvironmental scan to identify a list of possible measures\nin these areas and then assessed these measures using\na set of standard criteria and feedback from key infor-\nmants. A list of measures identified through the envi-\nronmental scan and an assessment of their strengths\nand weaknesses for use in planning and public report-\ning are described in the following text.\n Methods\nTo identify existing measures of partnership, self-\nsufficiency, and social connectedness, first, we con-\nducted a broad environmental scan to identify a list of\nall possible measures in these areas and then narrowed\nthe list of identified measures using a standard set of\nevaluative criteria and feedback from stakeholders.\nEnvironmental scan\nWe reviewed national survey instruments such as the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\nsurvey,19 the National Health Interview Survey,20\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nS72  Journal of Public Health Management and Practice\nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency's\n(FEMA's) Citizen Corps survey,21 grant program guid-\nance (eg, Hospital Preparedness Program and Pub-\nlic Health Emergency Program [PHEP] Cooperative\nreviewed and gray (organizational and practitioner)\nliterature, and Web sites of relevant agencies and orga-\nnizations such as the CDC, Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, and Red Cross. Published and\ngray literature databases that were searched included\nPubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, EMBASE, CINAHL,\nand the New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Liter-\nature Report. As a final step, we reviewed all survey\ninstruments and reports listed in the FEMA's Disas-\nter Preparedness Surveys Database,23 which compiles\nhousehold, business, and school surveys that explore\nindividual or organizational preparedness. We used\nthe following keywords to guide our searches of the\nliterature: \"(metric OR measure* OR instrument OR\nindicator) AND (resilience OR partnership OR engage-\nment OR self-suffic * OR preparedness OR connected-\nness). Whileweprioritizedthepreparednessandhealth\nliterature, we also looked more broadly to identify\nsources in other disciplines that may be applicable to\npreparedness.\nAlthough we mapped out 8 key domains of commu-\nnity resilience in our previous work,10 we focused our\nenvironmental scan on measures in the areas of self-\nsufficiency, partnership (including the engagement of\nindividuals and organizations), and social connected-\nness. We reasoned that these were focus areas of both\nthe National Health Security Strategy (objective 1)3\nand CDC's Community Preparedness Public Health\nEmergency Preparedness Capability.5 In addition, these\ndomains can be measured at various levels, including\nthe individual level, organizational level, and/or wider\ncommunity level, thus illustrating the complexities re-\ngarding the appropriate unit of analysis in community\nresilience. The domains of community resilience that\nwere not captured in this scan included population\nwellness/well-being, access to care, quality, and effi-\nciency. We excluded these because they have not been\nprioritized in recent policy documents. This may be the\ncase because these domains reflect even broader public\nhealth goals outside the scope of traditional emergency\npreparedness.\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we used the re-\nsearch described earlier to define self-sufficiency as the\nability of individuals and communities to assume re-\nsponsibility for their preparedness and limit requests\nfor outside assistance. Partnership refers to efforts both\nto promote partnerships within and between gov-\nernment and nongovernmental organizations and to\npromote civic engagement among individuals and or-\nganizations. Finally, social connectedness refers to the\nconnections between individuals and organizations\nwithin a community that ensure access to critical re-\nsources (eg, information, financial assistance) and pro-\nmote mental health. Our search revealed more than 3-\ndozen measures, many of which have not traditionally\nbeen applied in a preparedness context.\nNarrowing the list of measures\nIn the next phase of our scan, we sought to eliminate\nfrom the list of measures the measures that were of\nrelatively poor quality and retain those that were of\nthe highest to moderate quality. To accomplish this, the\nstudy team scored measures using 5 evaluative criteria:\n(1) validity (ie, does the measure what is intended?); (2)\nreliability (ie, are the data subjective or objective?); (3)\nutility (ie, is the measure useful to stakeholders?); (4)\nmaturity (ie, has the measure been piloted or fielded?\nIs it about to be retired?); and (5) feasibility (ie, does the\nmeasure pose a reasonable burden for collection and\nhave the support needed to sustain it?). We chose the\ntop 25% of measures on the basis of total score, which\nyielded a set of 8 measures across the 3 domains of\ninterest.\nNext, we vetted these 8 most highly rated measures\nwith a convenience sample of 9 informants represent-\ning local and state health departments and the US De-\npartment of Health and Human Services. These experts\nwere recruited from a group of the study team's profes-\nsional contacts who regularly engage on topics related\nto community resilience and preparedness. Informants\nwere invited to participate in 30-minute semistructured\ninterviews in which they were asked to review and\ncomment on the strengths and weaknesses of the mea-\nsures. We probed the 5 evaluative criteria. We also\nqueried these informants about other measures that\nmay be missing, including data sources that have not\nhistorically been considered for community prepared-\nness measurement but may, in fact, be relevant. We\nreviewed interview notes for comments and recom-\nmendations but did not apply traditional qualitative\ndata analysis techniques due to fact that exercise was\ndesigned to solicit informal input rather than develop\nor modify a theory or conceptual model.\n Results\nWe list and briefly describe the most robust measures\nof self-sufficiency, partnership, and social connected-\nness. We also highlight publicly available information\non these measures (eg, baseline status if available)\nas well as summarize informant comments regarding\ntheir strengths and weaknesses.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Two of the measures are from the FEMA's\nCitizen Corps survey21 (% with a plan and % with\nfirst aid training), and one is from the preparedness\nmodule of CDC's BRFSS survey (% stockpiling specific\nsupplies).19 Informants mentioned that a major strength\nof these measures is that they are pulled from national\nsurveys that have been fielded more than once in the\npast decade; thus, baseline data--and in some cases,\ndata on trends--are available (Table 1). As such, they\nare among the more mature, \"reportable\" indicators\nof community resilience. One major limitation of the\nBRFSS measure, however, is that the CDC no longer\nplans to sponsor the preparedness module, so this ques-\ntion will no longer be fielded by states in 2013. Thus,\nthis measure cannot be used to track progress toward\nindividual preparedness in coming years. In addition,\nfewer than 18 states have fielded it 1 or more times\nsince 2006. Thus, the extent to which these data can\nbe used to tell a story about \"national\" preparedness\nor preparedness at the community level is in ques-\ntion. With BRFSS, it is not always possible to drill\ndown to the county level among the few states that\nfielded the optional preparedness module at least once.\nAlso, community-level analyses are not even an op-\ntion for FEMA/Citizen Corps data because fewer than\n5000 people across the United States are surveyed each\ntime the instrument is fielded (3 separate times since\n2003). Another major limitation of these measures is\nthat all fall at the individual or household level and\ndo not consider the self-sufficiency of organizations or\nbroader systems. Because they do not inventory these\norganizational and system assets, these measures pro-\nvide limited information about whether the broader\ncommunity is self-sufficient (ie, limited reliance on out-\nside resources during and after a disaster).\nKey informants further explained that there is some\ncontroversy regarding survey questions on individu-\nals' stockpiling and planning behaviors. For example,\nsimply having a detailed plan does not necessarily in-\ndicate that household members have knowledge of the\nplan's content or could follow its instructions in an\nevent.\nPartnership\nIn the area of partnership and engagement, we identi-\nfied a total of 3 measures. All of the measures are from\nthe CDC/PHEP and capture the activities of health de-\npartments, rather than individuals or other govern-\nmental or nongovernmental organizations. A major\nstrength of these measures is that they are well specified\nin grant guidance, and they were vetted by numerous\nexperts. Also, data on performance will be provided by\nall PHEP grantees across the United States, thereby pro-\nviding a national snapshot. Nonetheless, because these\nmeasures are new for fiscal year 2012, we do not cur-\nrently have any data and cannot report baseline levels\nof performance (Table 2). As described by informants,\nanother drawback of these measures is that they focus\nexclusively on the activities of one major stakeholder\nwithin the community, the local health department.\nBecause community resilience emphasizes a whole-\ncommunity approach,2 these measures are somewhat\nlimited.\nSocial connectedness\nWe identified 2 measures of individuals' ties to other\nindividuals in their communities including percent-\nage of individuals who talk to their neighbors and\nTABLE 1  Top-Scoring Measures of Self-sufficiency\nq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q\nMeasure Source Baseline Data\nPercentage of citizens who have a household emergency plan\nthat includes instructions for household members about\nwhere to go and what to do in the event of a disaster\nPercentage of citizens/respondents with first aid training in past\nFEMA/Citizen Corps21 In 2009, 37% had received first aid training in the previous\nDoes your household have the following for everyone who lives\nthere:\n3-d supply of water\n3-d supply of nonperishable food\n3-d of prescription medication (if applicable)\nWorking battery-operated radio (for household)\nWorking flashlight (for household)\n42.4% of households had 4 preparedness items (food,\nwater, batteries, and flashlight); 87.4% of respondents\nlived in households in which each member requiring\nmedication had a 3-d supply\nAbbreviations: BRFSS, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; FEMA, Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Because neighbors are often called upon to\nsupport one another during an event (when exter-\nnal assistance is not yet available) and are the true\n\"first responders,\" communities with strong neighbor-\nto-neighbor connections will be more self-sufficient and\nthus more resilient.\nA major strength of both of these measures is that\nthey are from the US Census Bureau's Current Popu-\nlation Survey (Table 3), a national survey of approx-\nsample to conduct sophisticated statistical analyses, in\nsome cases at the local level.24\n Discussion\nOur results suggest that while there is great inter-\nest in quantifying community preparedness, exist-\ning data have major limitations. Robust indicators of\ncommunity preparedness are few in number, and even\nwhen data are collected, the information may not al-\nways be tracked systematically to allow for both a na-\ntional assessment and a localized picture to drive com-\nmunity planning.\nAt present, the strongest measures for the purposes\nof public reporting and planning are the CDC/PHEP\ncommunity partnership measures. Data on these spe-\ncific measures should be available in the next 12 to 18\nmonths, although future analysis should explore the\nassociation of these variables with real and exercised\nresponses. For many of the older measures, baseline\ndata are available; however, these measures are focused\nexclusively on the activities of individuals. It is unclear\nwhether rolling up these data to the community level\n(eg, % of individuals within a county) is a meaningful\npredictor of community response and recovery capac-\nity. Furthermore, the social connectedness items from\nthe Current Population Survey have not been used in\nthe emergency preparedness context.\nBy cataloging measures of self-sufficiency, partner-\nship, and social connectedness, we revealed important\ngaps, namely, the need for more measures of organiza-\ntional and network activity and measures in the area\nof community engagement and empowerment. There\nare also no true capability measures within this set;\nideally, we should have a mix of both capacity and ca-\npability measures.25 While the CDC/PHEP community\npartnership measures are strong because they capture\ninteractions that are occurring among numerous sec-\ntors in the community, they are only measures of \"who\nis at the table\" rather than measures of the strength,\neffectiveness, or quality of those relationships. Once\nthese measures are tested across the United States by\nPHEP awardees, the CDC should consider adding ad-\nditional measures that focus on how such relationships\nare being leveraged to achieve preparedness outcomes.\nOur results also suggest opportunities for how and\nwhen community preparedness data are collected. For\nexample, we do not have clear expectations for what\ncommunities can capture during a real-time event and\nwhat preevent information could be in place to aid\nthat analysis. In addition, there are currently no sys-\ntematic frameworks regarding how information on\ncommunity-level sufficiency, partnerships, and social\nconnectedness will guide intervention or trigger local\ndecisions about where to build community capacity.\nThe major limitations of our environmental scan in-\nclude (1) lack of a systematic approach to identifying\nnonhealth sources; (2) subjective approach to scoring\nidentified measures; and (3) use of a convenience sam-\nple of informants who represent only the health sector\nrather than the full range of sectors engaged in commu-\nnity preparedness efforts; however, to our knowledge,\nthis is the first study to undertake such an ambitious\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Ongoing\nmeasurement facilitates public reporting and account-\nability, as well as continuous quality improvement;\nhowever, these purposes cannot be achieved unless\nwe develop new measures in areas where there are\ngaps and test novel measures that have not historically\nbeen applied to the preparedness context.
