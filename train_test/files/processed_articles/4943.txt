Group I received normal diet; group II received 24 g high fat diet/100 g of daily diet; group\nIII received 24 g high fat diet/100 g daily diet and 200 ml of lycopene extract (twice a week) for 8 weeks; and group IV\nreceived 200 ml oral lycopene extract twice a week for 8 weeks.\nResults: A marked increase was observed in plasma urea and creatinine levels, serum C-reactive protein, kidney\nweight, tissue renal malonyldialdehyde level, ACE gene expression and serum level, while a decrease catalase level\namong hyperlipidaemic rats was observed. Histologically, interstitial inflammation and proliferation was seen. Lycopene\nsupplementation significantly decreased plasma urea and creatinine, serum ACE, renal tissue malonyldialdehyde level and\nC-reactive protein level, while it increased tissue antioxidant enzymes level and total protein. Tissue inflammation and\nproliferation was improved.\nConclusions: This finding suggests that supplementation of lycopene is effective for renal antioxidant enzymes, ACE\ngene expression and ACE serum level in hyperlipidaemic rats.\n",

Age, sex, genetic predis-\nposition are non-modifiable risk factors for CAD, while\ndiabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle,\nsmoking and dyslipidaemia are modifiable risk factors.4\nAngiotensin II is a biologically active product of the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS);5 it is a\npotent vasoconstrictor and regulates cerebral blood flow.\nThe RAAS has been recognised as the principal therapeu-\ntic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.6\nFerrario in 20067 found that kinase II peptide has an identi-\ncal structure to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\ninhibitor.

Since then many ACE inhibitors have been\nstudied for antihypertensive/cardiomodulatory therapies.7\nPharmacological therapies have been used to treat\nhyperlipidaemia but exert side effects. Therefore, the\nchoice of non-pharmacological therapies including diet\nplays an important role in alleviating the major cause of\ndeath all over the world including cardiac heart disease,\nstroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis.8\nPlants have a long history of medicinal usage to treat body\nailments. Antioxidants, flavonoids, polyphenols of food\nhave been studied to treat life-threatening diseases.\nLycopene is a most powerful antioxidant, which is natu-\nrally present in carrots, tomatoes, watermelons, papaya,\ncherries, strawberries, beans etc.9 Previous investigations\nreflect the cardioprotective,10 antineoplastic11 and nephro-\nprotective effects of lycopene in diabetes.12 Therefore, the\npurpose of the present study is to investigate the role of\nlycopene on the modulation of renal antioxidant enzymes,\nserum ACE and ACE gene expression in diet-induced\nhyperlipidaemia using an experimental rat model.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and diet\nweight) were purchased from the animal house of the\nInternational Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences,\nKarachi, Pakistan, for the study. Animals were kept in the\nlaboratory for one week before the start of the experiment\nand were caged in a temperature controlled room (23\u00b14\u00b0C).\nDrinking water, standard rat diet and high fat diet (HFD)\nfor the experiment were easily available to the rats. The\nexperiments were followed in accordance with the ethical\nguidelines of internationally accepted principles for labo-\nratory use and care in animal research (Health Research\nPreparation of HFD\nA HFD was prepared according to the method of Khalifa\ncose, 6 g common salt, 3% vitamin mixture and 40 g raw\nmelted beef fat separately. All ingredients were then mixed\nwith water and 12 g pellets were prepared. Almost 50.4%\nof the daily ingested calories through this diet were derived\nfrom its fat content.\nPreparation of lycopene extract\nThe lycopene extract was prepared according to the\nmethod of Lavecchia and Zuorro.15 Fresh tomatoes were\nwashed with tap water and an X cut was made at the small\nend, they were then immersed in boiling water for about\n1\u00ad2 minutes to remove the skin, and dried in an oven at\npeel was mixed with 3 ml of butylated hydroxytoluene in\nacetone (0.5% w/v), 3 ml of ethanol, 6 ml of hexane and\nincubated in a 25\u00b0C water bath with continuous stirring.\nAfter 2 hours, 2.5 ml of aqueous enzyme solution (pecti-\nnase 2% v/v in glycine buffer pH 10) was added and the\nmixture was then left for 20 hours; 7.5 ml of hexane was\nthen added with continuous stirring and allowed to stand\nfor a further 4 hours, so that the organic and aqueous phase\nwas separated and the upper most reddish coloured hexane\nlayer was extracted as lycopene. Spectrophotometrically\nthe lycopene concentration was determined as 503 nm\nwith absorbent coefficient 3120 for hexane as blank. The\nlycopene concentration obtained per litre was 0.437 mg.\nStudy design\nbodyweight) were randomly divided into four groups.\nEach group consisted of eight rats (n=8).\nGroup I: Control group (negative controls) received\nnormal rat diet.\nGroup II: Hyperlipidaemic positive controls received\nwere weighed before HFD and then every 7 days.\nGroup III: Hyperlipidaemic plus lycopene-treated\nml oral lycopene extract (twice a week) for 8 weeks.\nGroup IV: Lycopene-treated group received 200 ml of\nlycopene extract (87.4 \u00b5g of lycopene) orally twice a\nweek for 8 weeks.\nSample collection\nAfter 12 hours of fasting, the rats were dissected under\nanaesthesia. A 5 ml heparin-coated syringe with 25\u00ad30\ngauge size needle was inserted from behind the xiphoid\ncartilage into the heart, making an angle of 10\u00ad30\u00b0C from\nthe breast bone. About 10\u00ad20 ml of blood was collected\nthrough this procedure. The plasma was obtained by col-\nlecting blood in heparin-coated glass tubes and centrifug-\nbiochemical analysis.\nThe serum was obtained by collecting the blood in\nclean glass tubes and allowing it to stand for 1\u00ad2 hours\nundisturbed. It was then centrifuged at 3000 rmp for 5\nminutes and stored supernatant at -80\u00b0C for biochemical\nanalysis.\nAfter dissection, the kidneys were removed from the\nanimals, washed with ice cold saline (0.9% NaCl), adher-\nent fat and connective tissues were removed and kidneys\nwere blot dried over the filter paper. Both kidneys were\nKhan et al. 3\nweighed and one was stored at -80\u00b0C for preparing\nhomogenate, while the other kidney was used for histo-\npathological study. The kidney was immersed in 10% for-\nmalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at\n3 \u00b5m, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and evaluated\nby light microscopy.16\nFor homogenate preparation: Kidney tissues at a ratio\nride buffer of pH 7.0 and homogenised, then centrifuged\nrated and stored at -70\u00b0C for analysis of antioxidant\nacetonitrile) was added to prevent homogenate from oxi-\ndation and the homogenate was stored at -70\u00b0C until\nanalysis for malonyldialdehyde.\nBiochemical analysis\nFor the assessment of kidney function plasma samples\nwere assayed for urea18 and creatinine.19 Urea was esti-\nmated by an enzymatic method and creatinine by Jaffe's\nmethod.\nPlasma total protein was analysed by the Biuret\nmethod.20 Serum C-reactive protein was estimated by parti-\ncle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay using the Biolatex\nkit,21 nitrite by Griess' reaction.22 For electrolyte analysis\nthe end point method was used. Serum sodium and potas-\nsium were analysed by the method of Henry et al.,23 serum\ncalcium by the method of Moorehead and Biggs,24 and\nserum chloride by the method of Feldkamp et al.25\nFor serum ACE activity the colorimetric enzymatic\nassay by Studdy and Bird26 was used.\nAnalysis of ACE gene expression: ACE gene expres-\nsion was estimated by the method of Korstanje et al.27 A\ncentimetre of tissue was treated with 500 \u00b5l of digestion\nbuffer (1 mg/ml of proteinase K, 50 mM Tris-Cl of pH\nacid (EDTA) of pH 8.0 and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate\n(SDS)) at 55\u00b0C. Phenol, chloroform and isoamyl alcohol\nwas added to the mixture at a ratio of 25:24:1, centrifuged\nallowed to precipitate by adding 100% ethanol (2 vol-\numes). A dried pellet of DNA was suspended in 1 ml of\nTris EDTA buffer of pH 7.5\u00ad8.0. Quantitative reverse\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to assess\nACE gene expression.\nAnalysis of renal tissue oxidant status\nTissue catalase was estimated by the method of Sinha.28\nBriefly, tissue homogenate was mixed with phosphate\nbuffer of pH 7.0 and added to 1 ml of 0.2 M hydrogen\nperoxide solution. Then it was added to 2 ml of 5% dichro-\nmate acetic acid solution and boiled for 10 minutes, cooled\nwith tap water and absorbance was read at 570 nm on a\nSchimadzu spectrophotometer UV-120-01. The activity\nwas calculated as \u00b5m/g of tissue.\nTissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) was estimated by\nthe method of Kono.29 Briefly, the reaction mixture con-\n\u00b5m nitroblue tetrazolium solution (NBT), 0.1 ml of Triton\nhydroxylamine hydrochloride solution of pH 6.0. The rate\nof NBT reduction of the reaction mixture was recorded per\nminute on a Schimadzu UV spectrophotometer at 560 nm\nthen added to 0.1 ml of tissue homogenate. The percentage\ninhibition of NBT reduction rate was recorded at U/g of\ntissue.\nTissue glutathione was estimated by the method of\nCarlberg and Mannervik.30 Briefly, the reaction mixture\nbovine serum albumin, 1.5 ml 50 mM Potassium phosphate\nbuffer (KPO4\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)\nand 0.1 ml of 30 mM oxidised glutathione. Absorbance was\nrecorded on a kinetic spectrophotometer PRIM 500 for 5\nminutes at 25\u00b0C. The tissue glutathione level was estimated\nas U/g of tissue.\nTissue malonyldialdehyde was estimated by the method\nof Okhawa et al.31 Briefly, the reaction mixture consisted of\naqueous thiobarbituric acid and 0.2 ml of tissue homogen-\nate. Distilled water was added to make up the volume to\n4 ml, the mixture was then heated at 95\u00b0C for 60 minutes,\ncooled with tap water and centrifuged. Then 1 ml of distilled\nwater and 5 ml of n-butanol and pyridine (15:1 v/v) were\nadded. A pink coloured organic layer was read at 532 nm on\na Schimadzu UV spectrophotometer. The tissue malonyldi-\naldehyde concentration was measured as nmol/g of tissue.\nResults\nHistological examination of hyperlipidaemic rats showed\nproliferation with moderate interstitial inflammation.\nWhile lycopene-treated rats showed no such proliferation\nas shown in group III; however, mild interstitial inflam-\nmation was observed.

The measurement of differ-\nent parameters, their levels and their activities are used for\nthe diagnosis.32 Hypercholesterolaemia accelerates the\nprogression of kidney disease.33 Urea and creatinine levels\nare used as an indicator of nephrotoxicity as low clearance\nof these substances indicates diminished or impaired abil-\nity of the kidney to clear the body's waste products.34 We\nfound increased urea and creatinine levels in hyperlipidae-\nmic rats showing their nephrotoxic effect (Table 1,\nP<0.005). Treatment of hyperlipidaemic rats with lyco-\npene produced significantly decreased urea and creatinine\nlevels (P<0.05) suggesting its nephroprotective effect\nagainst hyperlipidaemia. Kidney tissues indicated from the\nhistological examination that lycopene antioxidant activity\nprotects the renal parenchyma from oxidative damage and\nthus modulates the endogenous cholesterol synthesis and\nmetabolism and reduces the intensity of hyperlipidaemia-\nbased nephrotoxicity (Figure 1).\nKhan et al. 5\nTable 2.

Histopathological examination of kidney tissue in groups I, II, III and IV.\nAmong the numerous markers for the detection of\nhyperlipidaemia, an imbalance in antioxidant status was\nobserved in diet-induced hyperlipidaemia. Increases in\nthe activity of lipid peroxidation and oxidant enzymes\nincluded NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase and xanthine\noxidase. NADPH oxidase has been recognised within\nthe vascular wall and has a great impact on reactive\noxygen species (ROS)-related decreased nitric oxide (NO)\nbioavailability.35 In the pathological condition overactivity\nof these enzymes leads to the overproduction of free radi-\ncals, leading to scavenging of the NO molecule, uncou-\npling endothelial NO synthase or/and formation of\nperoxynitrite.36 Uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase\nwith substrate reduction can transform into a superoxide\ngenerating enzyme, which in turn increases the production\nof oxidant radicals, hydrogen peroxide along with NO\nKhan et al. 7\nproduction.37 A range of antioxidant mechanisms balances\nthe effects of ROS including catalase, superoxide dismutase\nand glutathione. The present investigation indicated a high\nconcentration of malonyldialdehyde (P<0.01) with a low\ntissue catalase level (P<0.05) (Table 4). This result is\ncorroborated with previous investigators who found a\nsignificantly increased tissue malonyldialdehyde level in\nhyperlipidaemia, which was inversely proportional to anti-\noxidant enzymes.38 Lycopene has been shown to be one of\nthe best biological suppressants of free radicals, especially\nthose derived from oxygen. It has the highest singlet-\nquenching rate among all carotenoids in the biological sys-\ntem.12 The findings in the present study demonstrated the\nability of lycopene to protect the kidney tissue from cellular\ndamage through elevation of antioxidant enzymes.\nCRP is a marker of inflammation to predict cardiovascu-\nlar disease among healthy humans. It is also used clinically\nfor the assessment of low-grade cardiovascular inflamma-\ntion.39 We found a marked increased CRP level in hyper-\nlipidaemic rats (Table 2, P<0.005) and found a significant\neffect of lycopene on hyperlipidaemic rats. CRP promotes\nendothelial dysfunction and is responsible for atherosclero-\nsis.39 Rein et al. studied tomato flavanoids and showed\nthese substances to reduce the CRP level and fibrinogen in\ncontrast to increased vitamin E, selenium and serum high-\ndensity lipoprotein.40 Pasceri et al. hypothesised that CRP\nvia interleukin 6 stimulates vascular dysfunction by inhibit-\ning endothelial NO synthase, increases oxidative stress,\nvascular permeability, stimulates the adhesion molecules,\nchemokine production, and thrombus formation within the\nendothelial cells.41 No significant changes were observed\nin the total protein level in hyperlipidaemic rats as shown in\nTable 2. While lycopene treatment significantly increased\nthe total protein level, Ozturk et al.42 found in their study\nthat intoxication of carbon tetrachloride damaged the cell\nmembrane and their intracellular organelles and increased\nthe permeability of the basement membrane of the kidney\nthus increasing protein loss in the urine. Lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol is an important constituent of the plasma membrane\nthus a big change may increase the membrane permeability\nand cause lipid peroxidation.43\nThe significantly increased total protein level in group\nIII may suggest that preferential deposition of lycopene in\norgans such as the liver may be implicated.44\nHyperlipidaemia is characterised by hyponatraemia\nusually giving rise to derangements of homeostatic bal-\nance with respect to electrolytes.45 Although no changes\nwere observed in serum electrolytes, including sodium,\npotassium chloride on hyperlipidaemic-treated rats when\ncompared with negative controls, following treatment with\nlycopene the serum level of sodium, calcium chloride did\nnot differ with hyperlipidaemic rats when compared.\nWhereas the serum potassium level showed significant\nresults following treatment with lycopene when compared\nwith negative controls.\nRecent evidence indicates that major cardiovascular\nrisk factors influence the renin\u00adangiotensin system func-\ntion, including an increased synthesis of the angiotensin I\nconverting enzyme.46 The present investigation indicates\nthe increased ACE serum activity and gene expression\nin hyperlipidaemic rats. Niemiec et al. investigated hyper-\nlipidaemia, which is one of the major risk factors of\ncardiovascular arterial disease, increasing the plasma con-\ncentration of angiotensinogen and the angiotensin peptides\nand upregulating the expression of the angiotensin II type\n1 receptor (AT1R) gene.47 Suzuki et al. found strong cor-\nrelation between the DD genotype and the D allele with\nhyperlipidaemia.48 In smokers, the D allele has been asso-\nciated with endothelial dysfunction, resulting in increased\nlevels of angiotensin II, which has been shown to increase\nthe formation of SOD anions and the degradation of NO\ncausing endothelial dysfunction.49 Treatment of hyperlipi-\ndaemic rats with lycopene significantly reduced the serum\nACE level and gene expression, suggesting that lycopene\nhas strong anion quenching ability as compared to other\ncarotenoids and gives a protective effect.50\nConclusion\nThe results obtained from the present study demonstrated\nthat lycopene significantly attenuated the urea and creati-\nnine level and also improved the tissue kidney oxidant sta-\ntus. Lycopene treatment also regulated the serum ACE and\ngene expression. Thus our findings suggest the ability of\nlycopene to protect the kidney tissues dysregulated by\nHFD-induced hyperlipidaemia.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
