Hormone use was associated with lower BMI (M  26.5 vs 27.3). A comparison of effect\nsizes showed that menopausal status (F  13.1), followed by chronological age (F  24.0), were the least powerful predictors of\nBMI, whereas the more powerful predictors were physical activity level (F  1377.1) and ethnicity (F  400.5).\nCONCLUSIONS: The menopausal transition affects body mass index in mid-life, but the effect is small relative to other\nin\u00afuences. Interventions to increase physical activity are highly recommended to prevent increases in adiposity common in\nmid-life.\nKeywords: menopause; hormone replacement therapy; ethnicity; weight; obesity\nIntroduction\nBody weight and mortality from all causes are directly related\nin middle-aged US women.1,2 The lowest mortality rates are\nobtained among thin women who have had stable weight\nsince early adulthood.1 Excess body weight is associated with\nall-cause and cardiovascular mortality at all ages, except\nperhaps after 75 y.3 The relative risk associated with obesity\nis largest in women aged 45 \u00b1 54 at study entry and declines\nwith age thereafter.3\nIt appears that US women gain substantial weight in mid-\nlife.4 In the 10 y prospective study of the First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic\nFollow-up Study, the greatest proportion of newly over-\nweight (de\u00aened as ! 27.3 BMI) among initially normal\nweight women (`27.3 BMI) occurred in the age group of\nHowever, major weight gain (de\u00aened as 5 kgam2) occurred\namong those already overweight at baseline in both African-\nAmerican and Caucasian women. Among women not over-\nweight at baseline, African-American women were nearly\ntwice as likely as white women to become overweight\n*Correspondence: KA Matthews, 3811 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh,\nE-mail: matthewska@msx.upmc.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nduring the follow-up period. Furthermore, among women at\nstudy entry under the age4 of 45, African-American women\nwere more likely to become overweight than Caucasians.\nWomen's weight gain and increase in adiposity in mid-life\nare thought to occur through a number of mechanisms,\nincluding lowered physical activity and resting metabolic\nrate.5 \u00b1 7 It is less clear if changing reproductive hormone\nlevels associated with the perimenopausal transition affect\nweight gain. Although almost all the available longitudinal\nstudies of the perimenopausal transition show that the\nnatural menopause does not uniquely affect BMI when\ncontrolling for chronological age,8 \u00b1 10 these studies are not\nconclusive because the study designs typically compared pre-\nand post-menopausal levels of weight adjusted for height\nand did not report perimenopausal levels of weight. The\npopulations were almost exclusively white and the effects of\nthe perimenopause may vary by ethnicity. In addition,\nalmost all these studies recruited women who were still\nmenstruating and in their mid- to late forties. Thus, the\nmany women who had a surgical menopause (hysterectomy\nor oophorectomy) would have been excluded, as the peak\nage of hysterectomy is 35 \u00b1 44 y.11 In consequence, the effect\nof surgical menopause on weight is not as well established\nusing prospective designs, although cross-sectional data do\nsuggest that women who have had a hysterectomy are\nheavier.12 \u00b1 15 Finally, some of the postmenopausal women\nhave used hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Available\nclinical trials show that estrogen replacement therapy may\nslow weight gain in mid-life and the accompanying increase\nin central adiposity16 \u00b1 18 and longitudinal data suggest that\nwomen who choose to use HRT are thinner.19,20 Thus, it is\nimportant to separate the effects of menopausal status and\nthe use of HRT.\nAnother well-known determinant of obesity in women is\nlow social class.21 Low education and income is associated\nwith BMI in many studies. Some ethnic differences in BMI\nmay be due in part to the fact that some ethnic groups have\nmore members with lower education, income and occupa-\ntional prestige than do whites. In addition, some ethnic\ndifferences in BMI may be due in part to the greater pre-\nvalence of other risk factors for obesity, eg physical inactivity\nThe present report describes the prevalence of obesity in a\nlarge multi-ethnic sample of mid-life women residing in\nseven areas of the United States. It evaluates the associations\nof BMI (as a continuous variable) simultaneously with\nethnicity, menopausal status, use of HRT, educational\nattainment and age among Caucasians, African-Americans,\nHispanics, Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans.\nMethods\nStudy population\nSeven sites participating in the Study of Women's Health\nacross the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal study of mid-life\naging, invited women to complete a 15 min telephone inter-\nview if they met all the following criteria: age 40 \u00b1 55;\nCaucasian or self-identi\u00aeed primary or mixed ethnicity in\nthe site's targeted ethnic groups; ability to speak and read\nEnglish or a designated other language speci\u00aec to targeted\nethnic group; and willingness and ability to provide verbal\ninformed consent. The sites, their ethnic group in addition\nto Caucasian, and sampling methods are as follows:\nOakland, CA, Chinese, Chinese-American, sampling the\nmembership lists of a managed health care plan with\npreference for Chinese surnames; Los Angeles, Japanese,\nJapanese-American, random-digit telephone dialing,\nsampling of Japanese surnames from telephone directory\nand voter registration lists, sampling of ethnic organization\nmembers, and sampling the acquaintence network of those\nalready identi\u00aeed for study; Chicago, African-American,\nsampling from a householdacommunity complete census\nlist constructed for an earlier study; Boston, African-Amer-\nican, sampling from the Massachusetts state census list;\nDetroit, African-American, sampling from local electric\ncompany house-hold lists; Pittsburgh, African-American,\nrandom-digit telephone dialing, sampling from voter\nregistration lists; Newark, Hispanic-American, random-digit\ntelephone dialing, sampling from the acquaintence network\nof those already identi\u00aeed for study (the Hispanic-American\ncategory included Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central-\nAmerican, Cuban, Cuban American, South American,\nSpanish and very few Mexican Americans).\nAll sites used a standard set of codes to categorize the\noutcome of every potential interview. These codes were\nassigned to households for random digit dialing and electric\ncompany household lists, and otherwise assigned to indivi-\nduals. The 16 065 women who completed the telephone\nJapanese-Americans, 651 Chinese or Chinese-Americans,\nand 450 of mixed, unde\u00aened or unknown ethnicity, accord-\ning to their self-de\u00aenitions. They represent 82 \u00b1 99.7% of\nthose known to be eligible for the study at the various\nsites; the remaining eligible women were unwilling to be\ninterviewed fully. In addition to the eligible women who\ncould not or would not be interviewed fully, there were at\neach site women whose eligibility could not be ascertained,\nbecause they could not be contacted or they refused to\nanswer any questions at all. The fraction of these unascer-\ntained women who were eligible for the interview is\nunknown. If ascertained and unascertained women are\nequally likely to be eligible for the interview, then the\nwomen completing the interviews represent 24 \u00b1 94% of\nthe total women eligible in the target. Sampling methods\nand participation rates for each site are fully described\nthe basis of the present report. Data of women were excluded\nfrom the analysis as follows: 557 women with missing data\nneeded to compute BMI; nine women with BMI values out of\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nor mixedaother ethnicity; 316 women with missing meno-\npausal status; 53 women currently lactating or pregnant;\nand 542 women missing covariate information, eg smoking\nhistory. Women with missing or out of range BMI data were\nmore likely than other women to be Hispanic and less\nlikely to be Caucasian, Chinese or Japanese Americans, less\nlikely to have a high school education, and less likely\nto report using hormones in the last 3 months.\nSurvey method and variables\nThe study coordinating center trained all interviewers and\ncerti\u00aeed each based on recorded andaor monitored test\ninterviews with naive respondents. Interviewer performance\nwas then periodically monitored by the coordinating center\nand by senior staff at each site. All interviewers used stan-\ndardized scripts. Most interviews were computer-assisted,\nincluding automatic checks of data ranges at the time of\ncollection. Data recorded by hand were range-checked at the\ntime of subsequent computer entry. All data were transferred\nto a central computer at the study coordinating center, and\nthere tested for ranges and internal validity and assembled\ninto a SAS data set, which was distributed back to all sites for\nanalyses.\nThe telephone interview covered a broad range of sub-\njects, relevant to women's health in mid-life including qual-\nity of life, health status, medical history, lifestyle and\nsymptoms. We report here data on self-reported weight\n(with light clothing on) and height (with no shoes) in\nrelation to sociodemographic variables and reproductive\nhormone status. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms\ndivided by height in meters squared. Years of education were\ngrouped into less than high school, high school degree, some\ncollege, 4 y college degree, more than a 4 y college degree.\nDetermination of menopausal status was based on several\nquestions about recency of menses, regularity between men-\nstrual \u00afow and occurrence of hysterectomy. Women were\nclassi\u00aeed into \u00aeve groups: surgical menopause (having a\nhysterectomy or both ovaries removed); natural menopause\n(not menstruating within last 12 months not due to medica-\ntion, chemotherapy, pregnancy, breast-feeding or severe\nweight loss); late perimenopause (not menstruating for 3 \u00b1\n11 months); early perimenopause (menstruating in last 3\nmonths, with interval between menses reported as `less\npredictable'; and premenopause (menstruating in last 3\nmonths and interval between menses reported as predict-\nable). Extensive research shows that women can reliably and\nvalidly report menstrual history, age at menopause within\n1 y, and occurrence of hysterectomy and ovarian sur-\ngery.25 \u00b1 27 Women who indicated that they had taken `any\nfemale hormones, including birth control pills' in the last 3\nmonths were considered hormone users. Number of children\nwas recorded. Age was used as a continuous variable. Women\nwere asked if they were a current or past smoker and if their\nusual activity level was much less, somewhat less, about the\nsame, somewhat more, or much more than women of the\nsame age. This comparative self-rating of activity was used in\na number of previous population-based studies, includ-\ning the 1985 National Health Interview Survey Health Pro-\nmotionaDisease Prevention Supplement,28 and the CARDIA\nstudy of African American and Caucasian adults.29 In the\npresent sample, the associations between compara-\ntive physical activity rating and established correlates of\nactivity, such as overall health and employment status,\nwere obtained and were similar in each ethnic group.30\nValidity of self-reported height and weight\nOf the women who participated in the cross-sectional survey,\n2963 women who were eligible for and were enrolled in the\nSWAN longitudinal study had their height and weight mea-\nsured in a standardized fashion within 3 months of the\ntelephone interview and had BMI data within range. In the\nfull sample, the associations between self-reported and mea-\nsured height, weight and BMI were high and the median\ndifferences between self-reported and measured values were\nquite small (Table 1). An examination of the associations for\nBMI in each ethnic group taken separately showed that they\nwere slightly lower in the Hispanic sample due to lower\nheight associations and in the Japanese sample due to\nlower weight associations. Given the magnitude of the\nassociations and that weight can easily \u00afuctuate the magni-\ntude reported in Table 1 within a 3 month period of time,\nthese \u00aendings suggest that self-reported BMI is a reasonable\nproxy for measured BMI.\nData reduction and analysis\nThe percentage of women who were in the categories of\noverweight and obese was initially computed using the\nNHLBI standards for overweight and obese of BMI ! 25 \u00b1\nistics were summarized for the full analytic sample using\nproportions and by ethnicity using chi-square because of the\nsubstantial differences by ethnicity in the distributions of\nthe predictor variables.\nPredictors of BMI were identi\u00aeed using linear regression\nmodeling. The distribution of BMI was not normal\nnatural log for statistical analysis. This transformation\nimproved the residuals from the linear regression (see\nbelow), making the distribution of residuals closer to a\nnormal distribution. As all the linear univariate associations\nof the major independent predictors in this paper (ethnicity,\neducational attainment, menopausal status, hormone use\nand continuous age) were signi\u00aecant, a full multivariate\nmodel, which also included number of children, smoking\nstatus and physical activity as covariates, was calculated. To\nsimplify the interpretation of the coef\u00aecients from the linear\nregression model, adjusted subgroup means and standard\nerrors have been computed on the original scale for BMI,\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nusing a non-parametric technique that does not require\nnormally distributed residuals32 and are presented in \u00aegures\nbelow. The relative importance of sets of categorical vari-\nables, eg ethnicity or menopausal status, was assessed using\nF-statistics for removal from the model.33 Denoting the\nresidual sum of squares for the reduced model as RSSr and\nthe corresponding term for the full model as RSSf, the\nF-statistic was computed as follows: (RSSr 7 RSSfaq)a\n(RSSfa(n 7 k), where q is the number of variables removed\nfrom the full model, n is the same size, and k is the number of\nvariables in the full model. For a single predictor, such as\ncurrent smoking, the F-statistic is equivalent to the square to\nthe t-statistic, where the t-statistic is given by the coef\u00aecient\ndivided by its standard error. The increase in r2 from adding\nthe predictor (or set of categorical predictors) to the model\nincluding all other predictors also was computed as an\nadditional indicator of the strength of the relationship\nwith log BMI.\nCorresponding linear regression models were also esti-\nmated stratifying by ethnicity. The statistical signi\u00aecance\nof ethnic differences in the regression coef\u00aecients was\nestimated by adding appropriate interaction terms to the\nregression model estimated in the full sample and using the\nF-statistic for removal from the model. A Bonferroni correc-\ntion for multiple comparisons was applied to achieve a 0.05\nsigni\u00aecance level for each set of interactions with ethnicity,\neg educational level by ethnicity. It should be noted the\npower of the analysis to detect ethnic differences in predic-\ntors was affected by low numbers in some of the subgroups,\neg hormone users among the Chinese Americans.\nThe role of \u00aeeld site in predicting BMI was determined as\nfollows. First, site indicators were added as predictors to the\nmodel estimated in the full sample. Because three ethnic\ngroups were studied at only one site (Chinese at Oakland,\nJapanese at Los Angeles, Hispanics at Newark), site and\nethnicity were confounded for these ethnic groups. Thus,\nwe only computed between-site differences for Caucasians\nand African-Americans in separate models, after adjustment\nfor all covariates.\nResults\nThe number and percentages of women for the full sample and\nfor each targeted ethnic group are described according to\nmenopausal status, hormone use, educational attainment,\nage categories, number of children, smoking status and physi-\ncal activity in Table 2. By design, the sample contained about\n50% Caucasians, with 28% African-American. Smaller num-\nbers of the other ethnic groups were available because they\nwere recruited at only one site, with some differences in\nnumbers due to differences in ef\u00aeciencies of sampling frames\nat those sites.24 In this sample of women aged 40 \u00b1 55, almost\n36% were postmenopausal, 33% premenopausal, and the\nothers in varying stages of the perimenopausal transition.\nApproximately 19% of the women reporting using hormones\nin the last 3 months. Educational attainment varied substan-\ntially with nearly 35% of the sample having a high school\ndegree or less education and 33% having a college degree or\nmore. Almost a quarter of the women were current smokers\nand almost 40% considered themselves similar in activity level\nto other same-aged women.\nAll predictor variables varied by ethnicity, P`0.001, and\nare the subject of subsequent reports. In general, relative to\nother ethnic groups, African-American women were more\nlikely to be postmenopausal, particularly surgically post-\nmenopausal, Caucasian women to use hormones, Hispanic\nAmericans to have less than a high school education,\nAfrican-Americans and Caucasians to smoke cigarettes cur-\nrently, and African-Americans and Hispanics to report less\nphysical activity.\nTable 1 Self-reported height, weight and body mass in relation to corresponding measured values\nCaucasians African-Americans Hispanic Chinese Japanese Total\nHeight\nWeight\nBody mass index\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nAccording to NHLBI standards, 54% were overweight and\n26% were obese in the total sample. Ethnic differences in\nobesity were pronounced, with under 4% of Chinese and\nJapanese women and over 40% of African-American women\ncategorized as obese (Table 3). Prevalence of obesity was\nhighest among women with a surgical menopause and\nlowest among the premenopausal women. Hormone users\nwere less likely to be obese than non-users. There was a trend\nof decreasing obesity with increasing education, ranging\nfrom 34% for women without a high school degree to 19%\nfor women with post-graduate study. Past smokers were more\nlikely to be obese than never or current smokers; women\nwith 3  children were more likely to be obese than those\nwith less; and women who were less active relative to their\npeers were more likely to be obese than their more active\ncounterparts. Although the correlations between self-\nreported BMI and measured BMI is very high in this and\nother samples,34,35 the tendency to under-report BMI may\nhave resulted in a slight under-estimation of the prevalence\nof obesity in this sample.\nTable 4 shows the multivariate model testing the inde-\npendent in\u00afuence of the major sociodemographic character-\nistics of the study population, menopausal and hormonal\nstatus, and covariates, except for site. This model accounted\nfor 22.5% of the variance in log BMI. Relative to Caucasian\nwomen, African-American women had greater mean BMI\nTable 2 Sociodemographic characteristics and menopausal status in full sample and in ethnic groups\nn.(%)\nCaucasian African-American Hispanic Chinese Japanese Full sample\nMenopausal status\nEducation\nAge\nSmoking status\nPhysical activity\nNumber of children\nSite\nNote: ethnic groups differed on all variables, P`0.001.\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nand Asian Americans had smaller mean BMI. Hispanics and\nCaucasians were similar in BMI (Figure 1).\nCompared to premenopausal status, the effects of post-\nmenopausal status depended on whether menopause was\nnatural or due to hysterectomyaoophorectomy (Figure 2).\nAfter adjustment for all covariates, including chronological\nage, women with a surgical menopause had greater BMI,\nrelative to premenopausal women, whereas women with a\nnatural menopause had a similar BMI to premenopausal\nwomen. Women who had a bilateral oophorectomy had a\nsimilar BMI to women who had a hysterectomy and retained\nat least one ovary (data not shown). Women who were in the\nperimenopausal transition had elevated BMI, compared to\npremenopausal women. Length of time since last menses did\nnot account for the difference in mean BMI for surgical\nmenopausal versus natural menopausal women (data not\nshown).\nHormone use was an independent in\u00afuence on BMI in\nthis sample, with hormone users reporting lower BMI, even\nwhen adjustments were made for the well-known correlates\nof hormone use, ie educational attainment and menopausal\nCigarette smoking was an independent predictor of BMI,\nwith current smokers having a lower BMI than never smo-\nthan previous smokers (adjusted M  27.78). Educational\nattainment also predicted BMI, independently of the other\nfactors. Tests for interactions of ethnicity with age, educa-\ntional attainment, hormone use and menopausal status\nshowed that ethnicity \u00c2 educational attainment interaction\nwas signi\u00aecant, P`0.0001. This interaction shows that the\neducation gradient with BMI was smaller in all the minority\ngroups than the gradient in Caucasians (data not shown).\nIt is noteworthy that the largest effect in the multivariate\nmodel predicting BMI was for physical activity level (Figure\n3), followed by ethnicity and smoking status. The increase in\nr2 is slightly higher for the four ethnicity indicators than for\nphysical activity, but physical activity uses only a single\ndegree of freedom whereas ethnicity requires four degrees\nof freedom, one for each of the separate ethnicity indicator\npredictors. Furthermore, separate analyses by ethnic group\nshowed that physical activity level had the largest effect size\nin each ethnic speci\u00aec multivariate model, although the\neffect size was larger among Caucasians than other ethnic\ngroups (data not shown). Menopausal status, albeit statisti-\ncally signi\u00aecant, was the least powerful predictor in the\npresent sample.\nWhen site indicators were added to the model, the per-\ncentage of variance in BMI explained increased to 23.6%.\nWomen at Detroit had a signi\u00aecantly higher average\nadjusted BMI than did women at the other sites. The primary\neffect on the other coef\u00aecients was that the coef\u00aecient\ncomparing Japanese Americans to Caucasian women\ndecreased in magnitude (became less negative). This\noccurred because adding an indicator for the Los Angeles\nsite changed the comparison from Japanese women at Los\nAngeles vs all Caucasians to Japanese women at Los Angeles\nvs Caucasian women at Los Angeles. Because the Los Angeles\nCaucasians had lower BMI than Caucasians at other sites,\nthey were more similar to Japanese women than were\nCaucasians at other sites; consequently the coef\u00aecient for\nJapanese women was smaller in the model including site\nindicators. When site was included in the multivariate\nTable 3 Mean body mass index and percentage with BMI ! 30, by\nsubject characteristics\nMedian\nBMI\nMean\nBMI\nStandard\nerror\nPercentage with\nEthnicity\nMenopausal status\nCurrent hormone use\nEducation\nAge\nSmoking status\nPhysical activity\nNumber of children\nSite (Caucasians only)\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nmodel, the F-statistic to remove ethnicity declined to 147.65\nfrom 400.49 in the model without site. In the model includ-\ning site, the most important variables predicting BMI were\nphysical activity followed by ethnicity.\nThe analyses by site among Caucasians only showed that\nCaucasians at Detroit had higher BMI than those at all other\nsites, whereas those in Los Angeles had lower BMI than those\nat all other sites (Table 3). Tests for site effects among the four\nsites that recruited African-Americans showed no signi\u00aecant\nsite effects after adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nDiscussion\nIn this large multi-ethnic cohort of mid-life women, the\nprevalence of self-reported obesity was high. Using the\nNHLBI standards, 55% were overweight and 27% were\nobese. Ethnic differences in obesity were pronounced, with\nunder 4% of Chinese and Japanese women, 23% of Hispanic\nand Caucasian women, and 43% of African-American\nwomen obese. As in other studies,21 higher BMI was asso-\nciated with lower social class, in this study measured by\neducational attainment. After adjustment for educational\nattainment as well as other factors that covaried with ethni-\ncity (including physical activity, smoking status, use of HRT,\nmenopausal status, number of children, and age), the ethnic\ndifferences in BMI remained apparent.\nBoth hormone use and menopausal status were indepen-\ndently associated with women's BMI. Hormone users had\nlower BMI than had nonusers, an observation consistent\nwith other studies of both African-American and Caucasian\nwomen19,20 and with the results of clinical trials suggesting\nthat lower weight gain among women treated with estrogen\nhormone replacement.16 \u00b1 18 As in previous longitudinal stu-\ndies,8 \u00b1 10 BMI was similar for premenopausal and natural\npostmenopausal women, when statistical adjustments were\nmade for chronological age as well as other covariates.\nHowever, women who had entered the early or late peri-\nmenopausal had elevated BMI, relative to premenopausal\nwomen, a pattern obtained previously in an Italian sample.36\nThese \u00aendings suggest that changing hormone levels may\naccelerate weight gain early in the transition, even though\nweight gain by the time of the natural cessation of menses\nmay be no more than is apparent with usual mid-life aging.\nThis \u00aending bears resemblance to the results from PEPI:18\nwomen randomly assigned to use estrogen alone or with\nprogestins had a smaller weight gain during the \u00aerst year of\nTable 4 Multivariate linear regression model predicting (log transformed) body mass index in full sample; r2  22.45%\nVariable\nParameter\nestimate\ninterval t-Test\nF-Test\n(numerator df,a\ndenominator df)\nIncrease in\nCaucasian (referent) \u00d0 \u00d0 \u00d0\nPre (referent) \u00d0 \u00d0 \u00d0\nPost 4 y college degree (referent) \u00d0 \u00d0 \u00d0\nNever smoked (referent) \u00d0 \u00d0 \u00d0\nadf, degrees of freedom.\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nFigure 1 Mean BMI and standard errors for each ethnic group computed on the original BMI scale and adjusted for all other predictors in the model.\nFigure 2 Mean BMI and standard errors for each menopausal status group computed on the original BMI scale and adjusted for all other predictors in\nthe model.\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nhormone exposure and thereafter exhibited the same weight\ngain, relative to women assigned to placebo. Poehlman37\nobserved in a small study that women who became post-\nmenopausal lost more fat-free mass and gained more fat\nmass than did women who remained premenopausal, with\nno group differences in weight. Applying this observation to\nthe present results, the change in BMI due to natural meno-\npause may be nonsigni\u00aecant, even when there are signi\u00aecant\nchanges in more precise measures of adiposity.38\nAlthough women who had a natural menopause were\nsimilar in BMI to premenopausal women, women who\nreported a surgical menopause had elevated BMI. Surgical\nmenopause may cause accelerated weight gain, above and\nbeyond the effect of chronological aging or becoming post-\nmenopausal naturally, because the surgical menopausal\nwomen had their uterus andaor ovaries removed prior to\nthe SWAN survey and presumably had a long exposure to\ntheir absence. However, our analyses did not show an effect\nof age at menopause on BMI. Surgical menopause, even in\nthe absence of removal of ovaries, may lead to lower uterine\nblood \u00afow and to early ovarian failure.39 \u00b1 42 Surgical meno-\npause is usually preceded by a period of illness (and inactiv-\nity) that may contribute to both relative and absolute body\nfatness due to loss of muscle and bone. Surgical menopause\nalters total body fatness in several longitudinal studies16,43\nand weight in several cross-sectional studies.12 \u00b1 15 New\nweight gain was reported by a minority of women under-\ngoing surgical menopause in longitudinal studies.44 Reduced\nlevels of energy expenditure and muscle activity are the most\nlikely mechanisms to account for the results.\nIt is also possible that hysterectomy andaor oophorec-\ntomy are more often performed in obese women than in\nnormal weight women.45 Obese women are more likely to be\nat risk for the common indications for surgical menopause,\nie for endometriosis, \u00aebroids and dysfunctional uterine\nbleeding,46 which are estrogen-sensitive conditions. Obesity\nis associated with higher exposure to endogenous estrogens\nbecause of secondary conversion of androstenedione in fat\ntissue and lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin.46\nStudies are needed to sort out the nature of the relationship\nbetween obesity and hysterectomyaoophorectomy.\nAlthough the present study shows that menopausal status\nwas a signi\u00aecant predictor of BMI, it is important to note\nthat a comparison of the relative effect sizes of the variables\nindicates that menopausal status, hormone use and chrono-\nlogical age were of least importance. Physical activity was the\nmost important predictor in each ethnic group taken sepa-\nrately, and in the full sample along with ethnicity. This\nsuggests that interventions designed to increase physical\nactivity in mid-life women are likely to be bene\u00aecial.\nAnother contributor to the BMI of Caucasian women was\ngeographical variation. Women from the Detroit area had\ngreater BMI than those from other sites, whereas those from\nLos Angeles were lower than those at other sites. This effect\nFigure 3 Mean BMI and standard errors for level of physical activity relative to other same-aged women computed on the original BMI scale and\nadjusted for all other predictors in the model.\nBMI in mid-life women\nKA Matthews et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwas not due to regional differences in surgical menopause\nstatus, hormone use, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking,\nage or educational attainment, at least as measured in our\nsurvey. Geographic variation in obesity is well documented\nwith higher rates of obesity in the northeast and south and\nlower rates in the West.31 Among the unmeasured factors\nlikely to be important to the pattern of regional differences\nare diet, attitudes toward weight and environments conducive\nto lifetime exercise.\nStudy limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the\ndesign, which prevents drawing \u00aerm conclusions about\nantecedent and consequent events. For example, we know\nfrom other studies that hormone users, including African-\nAmerican women19,20 are thinner prior to the use of\nhormones, but women randomly assigned to estrogen\nreplacement therapy also experience smaller increases\nin weight and central adiposity than those assigned to\nplacebo.16 \u00b1 18,47 Our design cannot determine the direction\nof effect of the variables measured in the study and obesity.\nSecond, the multiethnic nature of the study population is\na positive feature, but it still lacked African-Americans from\nthe south and Mexican Americans. Third, although BMI com-\nparisons among women strati\u00aeed by ethnicity can be made\nin this study, further explorations of the interactions among\nethnic group, menopausal status, and hormone use are\ndif\u00aecult because of ethnic differences in hysterectomy\nrates, decision to take hormones etc, resulting in small cell\ncounts for some of the ethnic groups, eg Chinese Americans\nwho had a surgical menopause or used hormones. Fourth,\nweight adjusted for height is an often used, but crude\nmeasure of adiposity and was based on self-reports in the\npresent paper. Thus, the BMI was subject to the well known,\nbut small bias to minimize weight and elevate height. We do\nnot think this is a large problem because of the substantial\ncovariation between self-reported and measured height and\nweight in the present sample and in other studies.1,34,35\nFollow-up of a subset of women who participated in the\noriginal survey is now underway and will permit evaluation\nof the relationships among obesity, central adiposity,\nethnicity and menopause in a longitudinal design with\nveri\u00aecation of hormonal and surgical status.\nIn summary, in a large multi-ethnic sample of middle-\naged women, we found that elevated BMI was associated\nwith surgical and perimenopausal status, and not using\nhormones. Natural menopause, the cessation of menses for\n12 months or more, was unrelated to elevated BMI in the\nmultivariate model. Ethnicity, geographical area (only in\nCaucasians), and educational status were also related. A\npowerful predictor of elevated BMI in the total sample and\nwithin each ethnic group was physical inactivity, suggesting\nthat the most useful intervention for preventing weight gain\nin mid-life women is increasing physical activity level.\n"
