The areas under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve (AUROC) were compared across the five race/ethnic\ngroups using waist-to-height ratio to determine the likelihood of the four cardiometa-\nbolic conditions.\nResults: The performance of waist-to-height ratio to detect one or more cardiometa-\nbolic conditions was comparable among all race/ethnic groups (AUROC> 0.60,\np 5 0.252), and was good/fair (AUROC > 0.60) when hypertension, prediabetes/dia-\nbetes, dyslipidemia, or subclinical inflammation were analyzed separately. The\nperformance of waist-to-height ratio of 0.50 was skewed towards higher specificity\namong groups with low prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions and lower median\nwaist-to-height ratio, and towards higher sensitivity among groups with high preva-\nlence of cardiometabolic conditions and higher median waist-to-height ratio.\nConclusions: Waist-to-height ratio can be used for community-based screening of\nmid-life women who may need secondary prevention for cardiometabolic conditions.\nA simple public health message: \"Keep your waist to less than half of your height\"\napplies to midlife women.\nwaist circumference, metabolic syndrome, anthropometry, minority groups, middle-aged\nIndices of abdominal obesity, especially waist-to-height ratio\n(WHtR), appear to be superior to body mass index (BMI) to\nscreen individuals for cardiometabolic conditions (hyperten-\nsion, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes, and subclinical\ninflammation), cardiovascular disease, and years of life lost\n(Ashwell, Gunn, & Gibson, 2012; Ashwell, Mayhew,\nMoreover, WHtR has been advocated as a practical\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajhb V\nAmerican Journal of Human Biology\nscreening tool for cardiometabolic complications irrespective\nof age and sex (Ashwell et al., 2014). A universal boundary\nvalue aiming at WHtR < 0.5 has been proposed to simplify\npublic health messages for prevention of obesity-related mor-\nbidity (Browning, Hsieh, & Ashwell, 2010).\nAlthough the studies supporting WHtR use have included\nethnically diverse populations globally, most data are avail-\nable from cohorts of Asian-Pacific, African, and European\ndescent (Evans et al., 2011). More research is needed to\nexplore the associations of WHtR with the range of cardiome-\ntabolic conditions in American women of diverse race/ethnic\nbackgrounds (Harris, Stevens, Thomas, Schreiner, & Folsom,\nOur objective was to compare the WHtR as a screening\ntool for hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes,\nsubclinical inflammation among Hispanic, Chinese, Japa-\nnese, European-American, and African American mid-life\nwomen. Our secondary objective was to explore the perform-\nance of a screening-relevant WHtR > 0.5 boundary value to\nscreen for cardiometabolic outcomes across these 5 race/eth-\nnic groups.\nParticipants were enrolled in Study of Woman's Health\nAcross the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal, multiethnic/\nracial, seven-site cohort study of the health determinants\nacross the menopausal transition. SWAN's recruitment meth-\nods, eligibility criteria, and design have been published (Mat-\n42\u00ad52 years old, non-pregnant, not-lactating; reported a men-\nstrual period and no use of hormone therapy during the 3\nmonths preceding enrollment, and self-identified as one of\nthe five race/ethnic groups: African American (from Boston,\nChicago, Pittsburgh, and the Detroit area), Chinese (from\nOakland, CA), Hispanic (from Newark, NJ), Japanese (from\nLos Angeles, CA), and European-American (all sites). Each\nsite recruited community-based cohorts of European-\nAmerican women and women from one pre-specified minor-\nity group. This report includes study baseline data (1996\u00ad\nvariables to define WHtR and cardiometabolic conditions\n(hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes, and sub-\nclinical inflammation).\nA standardized SWAN protocol was used to measure\nanthropometric indicators (waist circumference and height),\nmedication use, diabetes history, and cardiometabolic risk\nindicators (blood pressure, fasting serum glucose and lipids),\nas previously described (Matthews et al., 2005; Sowers et al.,\n2000). Specifically, waist circumference was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 cm with a measuring tape placed horizontally\naround the narrowest part of the torso over undergarments or\nlight clothing at the end of a normal exhalation. WHtR was\ncalculated as waist circumference (cm)/height(cm). Three\nblood pressure measurements were taken with the participant\nseated after a minimum of 5 min of rest, and the last 2 values\nwere averaged. The technicians were certified for their per-\nformance and compliance with the standard SWAN protocol\nbefore collecting physical measures. The venous blood sam-\nples collected after an 8-hour fast were used for analysis of\nfasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol (HDL), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\n(hsCRP). If the participant admitted eating within 8 hours of\nblood collection, the non-fasting state was indicated (<5% of\nsamples across all race/ethnic groups). Medical history and\nprescription medication use was assessed using standard\nSWAN questionnaires.\nUsing the data collected in the SWAN study at baseline,\nhigh cardiometabolic risk was defined as having at least one\nof the FOUR cardiometabolic conditions:\n1 Prediabetes/diabetes, defined as a fasting blood glucose\nreported diagnosis of diabetes, or use of glucose-\nlowering medications (American Diabetes Association,\nHg, or use of prescription antihypertensive medications\n3 Dyslipidemia, defined as fasting triglyceride level 1.70\nmmol/L (or non-fasting 2.26 mmol/L), HDL-\ncholesterol< 1.29 mmol/L, or use of prescription lipid-\nlowering medications (Stone et al., 2014).\n4 Subclinical inflammation, defined as high-sensitivity C-\nreactive protein (hsCRP) level 2 mg/L (Blaha et al.,\nThree methods were used to compare the performance of\nthe WHtR as a screening marker for cardiometabolic condi-\ntions among race/ethnic groups. First, the Area Under the\nReceiver Operating Characteristic Curves (AUROC) was cal-\nculated with WHtR as a classification variable and each of\nthe cardiometabolic conditions as a reference variable.\nAUROCs for each race/ethnicity were compared using the\nmethod of DeLong (DeLong, DeLong, & Clarke-Pearson,\n1988). The discriminative performance was considered good\nSecond, we calculated the optimal WHtR boundary values\nfor each cardiometabolic condition in each race/ethnic group\nusing the maximum of the Youden index (J) based on the\nobserved data (Bantis, Nakas, & Reiser, 2014). Third,\nthe summary ROC curve were derived using the STATA\nmidas module (Dwamena, Sylvester, & Calrlos, 2010) for\n2 of 6 | American Journal of Human Biology KAZLAUSKAITE ET AL.\nWHtR 5 0.50 in each condition and within each race/ethnic\ngroup. All analyses were performed using STATA\u00ae, version\n14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nBy design, almost half of the cohort was non-Hispanic Euro-\npean-American, a quarter was African American, whereas\nHispanic, Chinese, and Japanese women represented 8.2,\n7.5, and 8.6%, respectively (Supporting Information Table\nrace/ethnic groups. Of note, African American and\nEuropean-American women were >6 cm taller on average\nthan Hispanic, Chinese, and Japanese women. More than\n57% of African American and Hispanic women had\nWHtR > 0.5, compared to less than one fifth of Chinese and\nJapanese women (Figure 1). The prevalence of high car-\ndiometabolic risk (1 cardiometabolic condition) ranged\n50-85% across race/ethnicities, with lowest prevalence in\nChinese and Japanese women (Supporting Information\nTable S2).\nThe association of WHtR with cardiometabolic condi-\ntions was good/fair in all 5 race/ethnic groups (Table 1).\nAlthough the discriminative performance was significantly\ndifferent among race/ethnic groups in models for individual\ncardiometabolic conditions (except for hypertension model),\nthe performance of WHtR was similar in high cardiometa-\nbolic risk (1 condition) models. This suggests a good/fair\nperformance of WHtR as a screening marker for cardiometa-\nbolic health in women of all 5 races/ethnicities.\nThe determination of optimal WHtR boundary value\nusing the maximum of the Youden index (J) suggests hetero-\ngeneity across race/ethnic groups (Figure 1). The heterogene-\nity of the optimal WHtR boundary values to predict each\ncardiometabolic condition was lower within the race/ethnic-\nity, perhaps due to overlap of cardiometabolic conditions\nwithin the groups.\nThe previously proposed \"WHtR global boundary value\nacross the 4 individual cardiometabolic conditions in 5 race/\nethnic groups (condition 3 group data points n 5 20) by\nconstructing a summary ROC curve (Figure 2).

The performance of WHtR global bound-\nary value of 0.50 was skewed towards higher specificity in\nChinese and Japanese women (with lower prevalence of car-\ndiometabolic conditions and lower median WHtR); skewed\ntowards higher sensitivity in African American and Hispanic\nwomen (with high prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions\nand high median WHtR); and clustered around the summary\nAmerican women. The performance characteristics of WHtR\nwere similar within each racial/ethnic group, perhaps due to\noverlap of cardiometabolic conditions. Yet, the analysis indi-\ncates residual variability in adiposity thresholds among race/\nethnic groups, possibly related to the spectrum of WHtR dis-\ntribution (Figure 1) and prevalence of cardiometabolic condi-\ntions (Supporting Information Table S2), both higher in\nFIGURE 1 The estimated boundary values (the maximum\nof Youden index) for waist-to-height ratio in each race/ethnic\ngroup to screen for subclinical inflammation, hypertension,\ndyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes, or any (1) of these cardio-\nmetabolic outcomes. The bar graphs present the frequencies of\nwaist-to-height ratios in each race/ethnic group. The dashed\nline denotes the waist-to-height ratio boundary value of 0.50.\nSubclinical inflammation was defined as high-sensitivity C-\nreactive protein 2 mg/L (Blaha et al., 2011). Hypertension\nwas defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, or use of pre-\nscription antihypertensive medications (Go et al., 2014). Dys-\nlipidemia was defined as fasting triglyceride level 1.70\nmmol/L (or non-fasting 2.26 mmol/L \u00ad less than 5% of sam-\nples were non-fasting), or HDL-cholesterol< 1.29 mmol/L or\nuse of any prescription lipid-lowering medications (Stone\net al., 2014). Prediabetes/diabetes was defined as fasting blood\nreported diagnosis of diabetes, or use of glucose-lowering med-\nications (American Diabetes Association, 2015)\nAmerican Journal of Human Biology\nAfrican American and Hispanic women and lower in Chi-\nnese and Japanese women.\nThis is the first study directly comparing the performance of\nWHtR as a screening marker for cardiometabolic conditions\namong mid-life women from 5 race/ethnic backgrounds\nresiding in the United States. The overall discriminative per-\nformance of WHtR was good to fair across all five race/\nethnic groups to screen for hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-\ndiabetes/diabetes, or subclinical inflammation. In general,\nour study supports the previously advocated public health\nmessage \"Keep your waist less than half of your height\" for\nadiposity-related primary prevention of non-communicable\nthe \"global WHtR boundary value of 0.50\" (Browning et al.,\n2010) has higher specificity in Chinese and Japanese women,\nand higher sensitivity in African American and Hispanic\nwomen. It is worth noting that our primary objective is to\nevaluate the WHtR as a screening test in the community-\nbased settings to identify whether one may need further diag-\nnostic testing for cardiometabolic conditions in a health care\nsetting. WHtR does not replace the standard testing to diag-\nnose individual cardiometabolic conditions. Abdominal obe-\nsity (with high WHtR) is one of the several related\nconditions contributing to cardiometabolic risk, and the other\nconditions (such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes,\nand subclinical inflammation) require more specific diagnos-\ntic testing.\nAdjustment for height intends to normalize WHtR for\nbody build, related to race/ethnicity (Katzmarzyk et al.,\n2011). However, residual race/ethnic variation in WHtR\nboundary values persists after adjustment for height, and cor-\nrelates with race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of cardiometa-\nbolic outcomes (Supporting Information Table S2) and the\nspectrum of WHtR (Figure 1), suggesting the influence of\nadipose tissue distribution, plasticity, expandability or other\nbiological processes in the common pathogenesis of cardio-\nThe principal strength of our study is the large and diverse\nsample of mid-life women which allows a 5-race/ethnic com-\nparison of WHtR in screening for 4 common cardiometabolic\nconditions. For the purpose of race/ethnic comparisons in our\nanalyses, the age homogeneity in our cohort offered an\nadvantage, as cardiometabolic conditions are also related to\naging.\nThe principal limitation of our study was the inability to\nassess the longitudinal relationship of WHtR with incident\nmortality and cardiovascular outcomes in this racially/ethni-\ncally diverse cohort. However, hypertension, dyslipidemia,\nprediabetes/diabetes, and subclinical inflammation are known\nto predict global cardiovascular risk regardless of race/eth-\nnicity. The narrow age range and only women participants\nlimit the generalizability of our findings to the other age\ngroups and to men.\nTABLE 1 The discriminative performance of weight-to-height ratio to screen for cardiometabolic conditions\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval)\nCardiometabolic\nconditions\nAfrican\nAmerican Hispanic\nEuropean\nAmerican Chinese Japanese\np-\nvaluee\nSubclinical\ninflammationa\nPrediabetes/\ndiabetesd\nOverall high risk\n(1 condition)\naSubclinical inflammation was defined as high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein 2 mg/L (Blaha et al., 2011).\nbHypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, or use of prescription antihypertensive medications (Go et al.,\ncDyslipidemia was defined as fasting triglyceride level 1.70 mmol/L (or non-fasting 2.26 mmol/L \u00ad less than 5% of samples\nwere non-fasting), or HDL-cholesterol < 1.29 mmol/L or use of any prescription lipid-lowering medications (Stone et al., 2014).\ndPrediabetes/diabetes (abnormal glucose metabolism) was defined as fasting blood glucose 5.56 mmol/L (or non-fasting 7.78\nmmol/L \u00ad less than 5% of samples were non-fasting), self-reported diagnosis of diabetes, or use of glucose-lowering medications\neTesting for an overall difference across ethnic groups (DeLong et al., 1988).\n4 of 6 | American Journal of Human Biology KAZLAUSKAITE ET AL.\nMidlife is a vulnerable period in women's life for pro-\ngression of abdominal adiposity and related cardiometabolic\nconditions.
