Breast-feeding also was assessed in a subsample of 850\nsibling pairs to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental\nfactors.\nResults: Among girls in the full cohort, the odds of being over-\nweight declined among those who had been breast-fed at least 9\nmonths; odds ratios ranged from 0.90 (95% confidence interval \n9 months. A similar effect was seen in boys, although these trends\nwere less consistent. In contrast, an analysis of sibling pairs pro-\nvided no evidence of breast-feeding effects on weight within dis-\ncordant trends.\nConclusion: Cohort data indicate that odds of being overweight\ndecrease as breast-feeding duration increases, at least among girls.\nHowever, sibling analyses suggest that this relationship may not be\ncausal but rather attributable to unmeasured confounding related to\nmothers' choice to breast-feed, or to other childhood risk factors for\noverweight. Our results illustrate the utility of sibling analyses in\nunderstanding the true effect of early life exposures (such as breast-\nfeeding) on health outcomes over time, independent of confounding\nfactors that may not be satisfactorily controlled using traditional\nprospective cohort methods.\nCauses of the obesity epidemic in the United States1,2 are\nnot fully understood. Cohort analyses suggest that\nbreast-feeding may reduce the risk of obesity in childhood\nand adolescence,3\u00ad9 with evidence of a dose\u00addependent re-\nlationship.9,10 Several biologic mechanisms support this ob-\nservation, including metabolic responses to bioactive sub-\nstances unique to breast milk, the effect of nutrient\ncomposition on insulin responses, and alterations in regula-\nhave fueled controversy in this area. Cohort studies have been\ncriticized for inadequate control of confounding factors as-\nsociated with the decision to initiate and/or continue breast-\nfeeding,8 such as maternal care-giving, mother\u00adchild inter-\nactions or other health-related behaviors. These factors are\ndifficult to measure in large cohorts, and they also affect\nobesity risk, leading to possible erroneous attribution of risk\nreduction to breast-feeding rather than other protective be-\nhaviors.\nOther factors commonly measured in cohort studies\n(eg, parental education) may be only theoretically important\nconfounders of the breast-feeding\u00adoverweight relationship.\nIn numerous studies reporting both crude and adjusted mod-\nels, inclusion of these potential confounders produced little\nthat these variables are intended to approximate may be\nimportant confounders, typically only crude proxies have\nbeen measured in large cohort studies.

Using one sibling as a control for\nanother accounts for multiple shared environmental and ge-\nnetic sources of variation that are not assessed in traditional\ncohort designs, and allows a more accurate description of the\ncausal breast-feeding\u00adweight relationship.\nOur objectives were to determine whether breast-feed-\ning exposure and duration are protective against adolescent\noverweight using traditional cohort analyses in a large, na-\ntionally representative sample with measured weight and\nheight, and then to explore how this effect varies within\nmatched full-sibling pairs that have been fed differently\n(compared with those fed similarly). We hypothesized that if\nbreast-feeding protects against being overweight, a breast-fed\nchild is less likely to become overweight compared with a\nsibling who was not breast-fed. However, sibling pairs fed\nsimilarly should have similar risks of being overweight.\nTherefore, the between-sibling difference in obesity risk\nshould be greater among sibling pairs fed differently com-\npared with those fed similarly.\nMETHODS\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\ncohort is a nationally representative school-based study of\nyouths (grades 7\u00ad12), augmented with selected subsamples\n(eg, sibling pairs). Survey procedures have been described\nelsewhere24 and were approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nadolescents and their parents. Wave II (1996) included\n14,738 wave I adolescents. Only school-aged adolescents\n(including dropouts) were followed in wave II; adolescents\nwho had graduated were not followed.\nThis analysis excluded participants who were severely\ndisabled (n  84), pregnant (n  214; because of the\nlikelihood of weight misclassification), Native Americans (n\n 125; because of small sample size), or missing data on\nThe sample for the cohort analyses totaled 11,998. Compar-\ning the participants included in our analysis with those who\nwere not, there were differences by ethnicity (57% vs. 37%\nwith less than a high school education; 26% vs. 30% parents\nwith a college degree or higher), but not by maternal obesity\nThe outcome measure of being overweight was based\non measured height and weight from wave II and defined\naccording to recommendations by expert panels.25,26 \"At risk\nfor overweight\" is defined as a body mass index (BMI) 85th\nand 95th percentile of age- and sex-specific National Center\nfor Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\n95th percentile. These 2 outcomes have been combined\naccording to convention (and hereafter referred to as \"over-\nweight\" for simplicity) as a BMI 85th percentile. Individ-\nuals who were older than 20 years of age (n  11) were\nconsidered 20 years of age for the purposes of overweight\nstatus assessment. Information on whether the adolescent had\nbeen breast-fed was obtained from in-home wave I parental\ninterviews. Breast-feeding refers to any breast-feeding, with\nor without complementary feeding; this exposure variable\nwas categorized as never breast-fed, or breast-fed: 3,\nates were measured by traditional survey methods and in-\ncluded parental self-reported maternal obesity status (yes/no);\nparental education, household income and ethnicity (by pa-\nrental and adolescent report); and current smoking habits\n(smoker vs. nonsmoker); and pubertal status (early, average,\nor late maturer)28 by adolescent self-report. Low birthweight\n(LBW) status was defined as less than 2500 g; information\nwas derived from parental report of adolescents' birthweight.\nFull Cohort Analyses\nStatistical analyses were conducted using STATA (Re-\nlease 7.0, Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Poststratification\nsample weights used in descriptive analyses allow these\nresults to be nationally representative. Survey design effects\nof multiple stages of cluster sampling were controlled using\nSVY commands.\nLogistic regression was used to estimate the effect of\nbreast-feeding on adolescent overweight. We collapsed cate-\ngories of breast-feeding duration because of small sample\nsizes at the longest durations. We conducted crude stratified\nanalyses to examine potential effect measure modification,\nand we identified confounding using causal diagrams.29 We\nfit a parsimonious logistic regression by specifying a model\nwith potential effect measure modification and confounding\nvariables.30,31 First, we removed potential effect measure\nmodifiers from the model if there was apparent homogeneity\nacross strata. Remaining effect measure modification terms\nwere then reduced using likelihood ratio tests, with   0.10\nto limit the likelihood of erroneously eliminating important\nvariables. Lastly, potential confounders were removed from\nthe model if their inclusion did not satisfy an a priori change-\nin-estimate criterion (a change in the odds ratio OR of\n10%). Of all covariates evaluated, only the ethnicity and\nincome variables resulted in changes in the OR that met our\na priori criteria for inclusion in the final model. Gender was\nidentified as an important effect measure modifier, and there-\nfore all models were stratified by gender. Logistic regressions\npredicting likelihood of overweight were repeated in the\nsibling sample to test whether a protective effect of breast-\nfeeding was present, without accounting for sibship.\nSibling Pair Subsample and Analyses\nTo expand the findings of traditional cohort analyses,\nwe selected a subsample of subjects matched with a full-\nsibling adolescent to control for shared genetic and environ-\nmental characteristics.32 Our analyses consisted of all full-\nsibling, nontwin pairs (n  850) identified in the full cohort,\nwith complete height, weight, and breast-feeding data for\nboth siblings. SVY commands were used to control for\nhousehold clustering. Statistical power for the multinomial\nlogistic regression was assessed using nQuery Advisor (Re-\nlease 5.0, Statistical Solutions; Saugus, MA). Our analytic\ndesign accounts for sibling pairs and tests whether differences\nin feeding practices influence weight outcomes of 2 siblings\nwith shared environmental exposures and genetic back-\nground. If breast-feeding protects against overweight, we\nwould expect differences in feeding practices to yield differ-\nences in weight status. This hypothesis was tested using\ncontinuous and categorical outcomes representing weight.\nSibling pairs were ordered by BMI-for-age Z-score,\nwith the heavier sibling identified as sibling 1. Linear regres-\nsion first was used to predict within-pair Z-score differences\nfrom indicator variables of breast-feeding status (ever versus\nnever breast-fed) for concordant and discordant breast-feed-\ning pairs (Eq 1).\nE (Z score difference)  \n \nLighter sib BF\n \nHeavier sibling BF  \nBoth sibs BF\n \ncovariate1\n  . . .\nk\ncovariatek\nWe hypothesized that among pairs that were discor-\ndantly fed, the breast-fed sibling would be lighter (ie, have a\nlower BMI-for-age Z-score) than the nonbreast-fed sibling.\nUsing linear regression to predict BMI-for-age Z-score dif-\nferences, we expected large, positive differences in Z-scores\nif the lighter sibling was breast-fed and the heavier sibling\nwas not breast-fed; therefore, if breast-feeding is protective\nagainst overweight, we expect the regression coefficient \nto\nbe greater than 0. Potential confounders were again identified\nby causal diagrams, and were evaluated by the a priori\nchange-in-estimate criterion.\nSecond, a separate analysis used multinomial (polyto-\nmous) logistic regression addressing the hypothesis that\namong discordantly fed sibling pairs, the breast-fed sibling is\nless likely to become overweight (compared with the non-\nbreast-fed sibling) and that these differences in risk are\ngreater than those among pairs who have been fed similarly.\nThese analyses result in ORs comparing several predicted\noutcomes (ie, the odds of both siblings becoming overweight\nversus that of only one sibling becoming overweight, and the\nodds of neither sibling becoming overweight versus that of\nonly one sibling becoming overweight).33 Dichotomous\nexposure variables were defined as: the heavier sibling not\nbreast-fed, the lighter sibling breast-fed; the heavier sibl-\ning breast-fed, the lighter sibling not breast-fed; both siblings\nbreast-fed; and neither sibling breast-fed (referent).\nThese modeling strategies included assessment of po-\ntential confounders (age, sex, birth order, and LBW status)\nthat differed between siblings. Family characteristics (such as\nparental education or household income) were not included in\nthe models since these are shared between siblings (which is\na strength of this analytic approach). As in previous analyses,\nsibling pairs are ordered by BMI-for-age Z-score. Thus in the\ndiscordant overweight group, sibling 1 is overweight, and\nsibling 2 is normal weight.\nRESULTS\nFull Sample Analyses\nCharacteristics of the nationally representative adoles-\ncent cohort are given by breast-feeding duration in Table 1.\nHalf (52%) were never breast-fed, whereas 15% were breast-\nfed for less than 3 months, and 33% were breast-fed for 3\nmonths or greater, with few differences by sex or maternal\nobesity.

In\ngeneral, ORs declined with increasing duration of breast-\nfeeding. We also assessed breast-feeding as a dichotomous\nvariable.

We expect the odds of discordance\nin overweight to be high among pairs in which only the\nlighter sibling was breast-fed, indicating that the nonbreast-\nfed sibling is overweight and the breast-fed sibling is normal\nweight.

In contrast, when compared with pairs in\nwhich both siblings were not breast-fed and both were over-\nweight, the odds that the lighter sibling of a discordant pair\nwas breast-fed were 0.52 and the odds that the heavier sibling\nwas breast-fed were 2.03, a result opposite to our original\nhypothesis.\nDISCUSSION\nThese analyses illustrate the difficulties of assessing the\ninfluence of breast-feeding on later weight, as well as the\npotential impact of unmeasured (or poorly measured) con-\nfounding in cohort analyses. The use of an alternative study\ndesign (ie, matched sibling analyses) helped to address these\nshortcomings. The findings from our traditional cohort anal-\nyses are similar to those previously cited in the literature,\nsuggesting a potentially protective effect of having been\nbreast-fed on overweight status.3\u00ad8 These results also support\nfindings of a strong effect with increasing duration of breast-\nfeeding,9,10 although previous research in this area is not\nconsistent.8,13\u00ad18 However, in the sibling subsample, discor-\ndant breast-feeding of sibling pairs did not predict BMI\nZ-score differences or discordant overweight status. These\nalternative results suggest that the effect of breast-feeding on\noverweight may be weak or absent. This relationship may be\ninduced by confounding because of environmental and ge-\nnetic factors, reflecting characteristics of mothers or families\nthat choose to breast-feed.\nThough the best method to establish a causal effect of\nbreast-feeding on overweight (independent of other factors) is\na randomized controlled trial, such trials randomizing breast-\nfeeding are unethical. Alternative data collection and analysis\nstrategies must be explored, such as the present analysis of\nsibling pairs exposed to differing feeding practices but shar-\ning physical and familial environments. By using matched\npairs and thereby controlling for a variety of unmeasured (or\npoorly measured) confounders, our results indicate the lack of\na positive effect of breast-feeding on overweight in this\nsample. Although the sibling sample size is smaller than\ntraditional epidemiologic cohorts, it is larger than other sib-\nling samples19\u00ad22 and allowed sufficient power to detect an\nTABLE 3.

Similar sibling study designs have been used to eval-\nuate relationships between intrauterine exposure to type II\ndiabetes and risk of adolescent/early adult overweight and\ndiabetes19,20; maternal feeding practices and preadolescent\noverweight21; extreme low birthweight and subsequent cog-\nnitive development22; and infant weight gain and childhood\nobesity.22 These results provide a unique perspective that\nadds to the current literature and allows for further hypothesis\ngeneration, and to our knowledge, this sibling analysis is the\nfirst study of its kind to assess this relationship.\nBreast-feeding could be linked to later becoming over-\nweight through numerous underlying processes, many of\nwhich are difficult to measure. Although much discussion has\nfocused on possible biologic mechanisms, there has been\nlittle research on other influential environmental and behav-\nioral factors that may confound this relationship. A mother's\ndecision to initiate and continue breast-feeding is highly\nself-selective and nonrandom in nature. Traditionally unmea-\nsured characteristics that may be associated with breast-\nfeeding, such as maternal care-giving, health behavior or\nphysical environment, likely also affect later risk of over-\nweight.\nCovariates measured in large cohort studies may not\nadequately capture the underlying factors that affect the\nbreast-feeding\u00adoverweight relationship, thereby limiting the\nability to statistically control for confounding. The analyses\ndemonstrate that many of these potential confounders result\nin minimal changes in the point estimate, indicating little or\nno actual confounding. Such comparisons highlight the short-\ncomings of traditional efforts to control for confounding,\neven with use of models adjusted for numerous survey-\nderived variables.\nThe sibling-pair study design can reduce important\nunmeasured confounding by maternal and household influ-\nences. Despite the strengths of this approach, however, these\nresults may be limited in generalizability, as sibling pairs who\nare discordantly breast-fed or discordantly overweight may\nnot be representative of all U.S. adolescents. Simply having\nanother adolescent sibling may be a factor that limits gener-\nalizability.\nIn addition, this study may also be limited by the\npotential residual confounding related to why a mother\nchooses to breast-feed one sibling and not another. We\nattempted to address this possible source of confounding by\ncontrolling for sibling LBW status in the models. Other\nspecific factors may confound our results if they influenced a\nmother to breast-feed one child and not another, and differ-\nentially affected risk of overweight later in life. For example,\nthese models may be confounded by neonatal complications\nin the birth of one of the siblings if the effect of these\ncomplications had a reduction in later odds of adolescent\noverweight (and was not reflected in birthweight status).\nThese types of confounders are not specific to sibling\nanalyses but rather are problematic in all observational epi-\ndemiologic methods, including traditional cohort analyses.\nSome previous studies have controlled for preterm birth3,10 or\ngestational age,18 or have excluded for abnormalities during\nbirth,4,6 but much of the existing literature has not taken these\nparent-recalled breast-feeding status. Although these types of\nrecalled measures are reasonable reproducible3,34 and valid,35\nthey may be less accurate than data collected prospectively.\nThe protective effect of breast-feeding on later over-\nweight status has been accepted in various clinical settings, as\nevidenced by its inclusion in a recent policy statement by the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics on the prevention of pedi-\natric overweight and obesity.36 Given the numerous benefits\nof breast-feeding,37 nearly all mothers should be advised to\nbreast-feed, and initiatives to increase breast-feeding should\nbe actively pursued. However, the etiology of obesity is\nmultidimensional, and our findings suggest that any potential\neffect of breast-feeding may be outweighed by the influences\nof other household characteristics.\nIn a broader context, our findings suggest the need to\nfind alternative means of testing exposures that cannot be\nmanipulated (eg, breast-feeding), and to explore other meth-\nods of observational study design to lend strength to observed\nassociations and enhance evidenced-based health beliefs,\npractices and recommendations. In addition to traditional\ncohort analyses, other approaches such as the sibling analyses\npresented here should continue to be vigorously explored to\ntease apart the underlying determinants of health and disease\nacross the life-course and address the issue of unmeasured\nconfounding related to a variety of influences related to the\nbiologic, social, cultural and/or physical environment.\n"
