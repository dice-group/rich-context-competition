Kozlov2, Robert Heimer1\n1 Yale School of Public Health, Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale University, New Haven,\nCorrespondence: Linda M. Niccolai, Yale School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT 06520 USA,\nBackground: Russia has one of the world's fastest growing HIV epidemics and it has been largely\nconcentrated among injection drug users (IDU). St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, is one of\nthe country's regions that has been most affected by the HIV epidemic. To monitor the current epidemic\nsituation, we sought to estimate recent HIV incidence among IDU in St Petersburg. Methods: In a\ncross-sectional study of 691 IDU recruited during 2005\u00ad08, HIV incidence was estimated by two\nmethods: a retrospective cohort analysis and BED capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) results.\nSocio-demographic and behavioural correlates of incident infections and spatial patterns were\nexamined. Results: In the retrospective cohort analysis, the incidence rate was estimated to be\nincluded current unemployment (P = 0.004) and not having injected drugs in the past 30 days\n(P = 0.03). HIV incident cases were detected in all but one district in the city, with focal areas of trans-\nmission observed to be expanding. Conclusions: High HIV incidence among IDU in St Petersburg attests\nto continued growth of the epidemic. The need for expansion of HIV prevention interventions targeted\nto vulnerable populations throughout the city is urgent. These results also suggest that the BED EIA\nmay over-estimate incidence even after correction for low specificity.\nKeywords: human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, incidence, injection drug users, Russia\n \nIntroduction\nThe Russian Federation has experienced one of the fastest\ngrowing HIV epidemics observed anywhere in the world.1\nThe number of officially registered people with HIV increased\nprevalence now exceeds 1%.3 The epidemic has been largely\nconcentrated among injection drug users (IDU) who comprise\n85% of the cumulative number of registered AIDS cases.1\nHIV prevalence among IDU now exceeds 30% in several\ncities in Russia.4\u00ad6 Currently, there is the potential for a\nmore generalized epidemic if transmission increases outside\nof high-risk core groups.4,5 With an estimated adult HIV\nprevalence now exceeding 1%, this seems increasingly\nplausible.3 This situation of high prevalence among core\ngroups and increasing prevalence throughout the general\npopulation indicates that monitoring the future course of the\nHIV epidemic in Russia is an important priority.\nEstimates of HIV incidence, the number of new infections\nthat occur during a specified time interval, are generally more\nuseful in monitoring epidemic trends than prevalence, though\nprevalence estimates are more readily available and thus\ncommonly used. We are aware of only one study of HIV\nand followed 520 IDU in St Petersburg in a cohort study;\nrelatively high incidence is supported by prevalence data\nshowing an increase among IDU in St Petersburg from <5%\nscarcity of HIV incidence estimates may be due to the\nlogistical and financial difficulties in following high-risk popu-\nlations for long periods of time, indeed a formidable task for\nvulnerable populations most affected by HIV.\nIn recent years, several laboratory assays for detecting\nincident HIV infections in cross-sectional samples have been\ndeveloped. One such assay is the BED capture enzyme im-\nmunoassay (EIA).11 By assessing antibody characteristics after\nseroconversion, recent infections can be distinguished from\nlong-standing infections. In this particular assay, the\nproportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibody in total IgG is\nmeasured with optical density (OD) readings. When used\non specimens confirmed to be HIV positive by other tests,\nlow OD readings tend to be found in people with recent\ninfections. It has been shown that false positive results occur\nfrequently with the BED EIA as some long-standing-infected\n\u00df The Author(s) 2010.

This low specificity of\nBED EIA produces over-estimates of HIV incidence and has\ncalled into question the utility of this assay for HIV incidence\nestimation.12,13 However, more recent work has produced\ncorrection formulas for use with BED EIA results that\nadjust estimates for misclassification due to sensitivity and\nspecificity characteristics of the test.14,15 It has more recent-\nly been recognized that specificity of BED EIA may also\ndepend on time since infection and thus can vary across\npopulations by place, time and age groups;16 thus collecting\ndata to estimate specificity in study populations may be\nuseful for interpreting incidence estimates derived from\nBED EIA results. The use of such tests and related for-\nmulas has been applied in Africa, Western Europe and\nNorth America,17\u00ad20 but to the best of our knowledge not\nin Russia.\nMonitoring trends in incidence among IDU in Russia is\nnecessary to understand the possible future course of the\nepidemic, to assess and target current prevention and care\nneeds, and to plan future prevention interventions including\nHIV vaccine research.21 The primary objective of the present\nanalysis was to provide an updated estimate of HIV incidence\namong IDU in St Petersburg, Russia. Our secondary objective\nwas to describe the epidemiology of HIV incident infections\naccording to socio-demographic and behavioural correlates\nand spatial patterns.\nMethods\nSetting and study population\nThis cross-sectional study recruited IDU in St Petersburg,\nof a multisite research project known as Sexual Acquisition and\nTransmission of HIV Cooperative Agreement Program\n(SATHCAP).22 Eligibility for inclusion in the present analysis\nincluded reporting a history of ever injecting drugs.\nParticipants were recruited into the study using respondent-\ndriven sampling, a chain referral sampling method that uses\ndual incentives and structured coupon disbursement\nprocedures for peer referrals. Participants provided oral\nconsent for participation in the study and written consent\nfor blood storage. All study procedures were approved by in-\nstitutional review boards at all participating sites.\nData collection and laboratory procedures\nParticipants completed structured interviews using computer\nassisted survey interviewing technology. The interview\nincluded questions about socio-demographic factors, injection\ndrug use histories and risk behaviours and HIV testing histories.\nParticipants provided blood specimens for HIV testing using\ncommercially licensed ELISA kits from Genscreen HIV\n1/2 (BioRad, France) and/or Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II\nplus 0 (Biomerieux, The Netherlands). Non-reactive\nspecimens were considered to be HIV negative. Specimens\nthat were reactive were confirmed with western blot assays\nusing New Lav Blot HIV-1 (BioRad, France).\nAll confirmed HIV-positive specimens with sufficient re-\nmaining sample were tested with Calypte HIV-1 BED\nIncidence EIA according to package insert instructions\n(Calypte\u00d5 Biomedical Corporation. Calypte\u00d5 HIV-1 BED\nfor OD of 0.8 was used to classify specimens as recent\ninfections.\nStatistical analyses\nRetrospective cohort\nFor our primary objective, HIV incidence was estimated using\ntwo methods. First, survey data including information about\ndates and results of past HIV tests were used to construct a\nretrospective cohort. To be included in this analysis, partici-\npants had to self-report that their last HIV test was negative so\nthat the retrospective cohort consisted of a population that was\nknown to be uninfected at baseline. Individuals in this group\nwho were confirmed HIV positive at the enrolment study visit\nwere considered new cases of HIV during the retrospective\nfollow-up period. Assuming that HIV infections occurred at\nrandom during the follow-up period, we used the mid-point\nbetween the date of last reported negative HIV test and date of\nenrolment to calculate follow-up time. For individuals who\nremained HIV negative, follow-up times were calculated as\nthe duration of time between the date of last reported\nnegative HIV test and date of enrolment. The usual formula\nfor incidence rates of the number of new cases divided by the\ntotal amount of person-time of follow-up was then applied to\nthese data. Similar methodology has been used to estimate HIV\nincidence among male drug users in northern Thailand.23\nBED EIA analysis\nThe second method for estimating incidence used the results of\nthe BED EIA. To be eligible for BED EIA testing, participants\nhad to test HIV positive on confirmatory western blot assay per\nthe testing protocol. Due to increasing recognition of the\nfrequency with which the BED EIA misclassifies long-standing\ninfections as recent (high frequency of false positive\nresults),12,13 corrected formulas for incidence estimation have\nbeen developed that adjust for misclassification due to sensi-\ntivity and specificity characteristics of the test.14,15 Spreadsheets\nthat facilitate computation of corrected HIV incidence\nestimates are readily available from the assay developers\n(B. Parekh, personal communication). In these corrected\nformulas, we used an estimated mean seroconversion interval\nof 155 days in accordance with package insert guidelines. We\nalso estimated specificity of the BED EIA for our study\npopulation by comparing BED EIA results with self-reported\ninformation about long-standing infections to determine a\nproportion in our sample that was misclassified. Among\nthose who were confirmed HIV positive at enrolment and\nreported past testing, those who reported an HIV-positive\ndiagnosis >155 days prior but were classified as recent\naccording to BED EIA results were considered false positive\nresults.\nCorrelates of incident infections\nTo address our second aim of describing the epidemiology of\nincident infections, we defined incident infections as those that\nwere classified as recent by both BED EIA and self-report\n(i.e. not reporting an HIV-positive diagnosis >155 days\nprior). We excluded individuals for whom we had conflicting\nor missing HIV incident results. The primary analysis of\ninterest was the comparison between HIV incident cases and\nparticipants who were HIV negative. Using logistic regression,\nwe examined socio-demographic characteristics and injection-\nrelated risks as possible correlates. Socio-demographic\nvariables included gender, age, education, employment,\nprimary mode of transportation and homelessness. Injection-\nrelated risks included duration of use, type of drug injected\n(assessed in the past 6 months to capture possible variation\nover time), recent use, frequency of recent use and receptive\nand distributive sharing of syringes and sharing of other drug\nequipment (assessed in the past 30 days to increase validity of\n614 European Journal of Public Health\nrecall). Covariates were dichotomized at a priori meaningful\ncut-points. All covariates that were associated with HIV\nincidence in univariate models using the P < 0.05 criterion\nwere then included in a multivariate model. Manual\nbackward selection was used to remove covariates that were\nno longer significant at P < 0.05 level to arrive at the final, most\nparsimonious model.\nSpatial patterns\nTo describe spatial patterns of HIV incidence, self-reported\nmetro stations closest to place of residence were aggregated\nto the district level for analysis. For each district, we mapped\nthe proportions of participants that were HIV negative, HIV\nincident and HIV prevalent. Maps were created using ArcGIS/\nArcMap 9.3.1 software (ESRI Corp, Redlands, CA, USA). Using\nlikelihood ratio chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, we\ncompared the proportion of incident cases in each district to\nthe proportion of incident cases in all other districts combined\n(e.g. the rest of the city). For this analysis, we excluded\nprevalent cases and the denominators included only HIV\nincident and negative cases.\nBecause we used RDS for recruitment of IDU, weighting\nprocedures may be used in analysis to adjust for recruitment\nprobabilities. Using a weighting procedure that took into\naccount our modified RDS methodology, we found that the\nweighted and unweighted proportions for sex, age and HIV\nstatus in this sample did not differ substantially: unweighted\nestimates for proportions male <25 years of age and HIV\nTherefore, we used unweighted estimates for all subsequent\nanalyses.\nResults\nA total of 691 IDU was enrolled in this study from November\nmedian duration of injection drug use was 8 years (range\n1\u00ad36), and most participants reported injecting heroin\n(90%).

At enrolment, 301 were confirmed to be HIV\npositive for a sample prevalence of 43.6%.\nRetrospective cohort\nAt the study visit, 540 (78%) individuals reported a previous\nHIV test date, of whom 322 reported their last test was negative\nand were thus eligible for inclusion in the retrospective cohort\nanalysis. Of the 322, 65 tested positive at the enrolment study\nvisit and the total amount of retrospective person-time since\ntheir last negative test and enrolment was 102.4 years. Using\nthe mid-point assumption, these individuals contributed\n51.2 person-years to follow-up for incidence estimation.\nAmong the 257 individuals who remained HIV negative, the\ntotal amount of person-time between date of last negative\ntest and enrolment was 408.7 years. HIV incidence was\nBED EIA analysis\nOf the 301 participants who were confirmed HIV positive at\nthe enrolment study visit, 297 had sufficient specimen available\nand thus were tested with BED EIA.

In the multivariate model, not currently being\nincidence. Because the association between not having injected\ndrugs in the past 30 days and incident infection was\nunexpected, post hoc analyses were conducted on the seven\nparticipants who were classified as recently infected and\nreported not injecting in the past 30 days. Of these, four\nwere male and three were female, five reported injection\ndrug use in the past 6 months, two reported having a sex\npartner who was an IDU (one male, one female), three\nreported non-injection drug use in the past 30 days and\nnone were MSM. One person reported being aware of\nHIV-positive serostatus due to a recent HIV test.\nSpatial patterns\nOf 677 participants with valid HIV status as described above,\n670 participants reported a valid metro stop closest to their\nplace of residence and were thus included in spatial mapping.\nParticipants were enrolled from 12 out of 15 city districts.\nIn these 12 districts, the mean (SD) and median number\nof participants were 52 (44) and 45, respectively; the range\nwas 14\u00ad155. Spatial mapping showed participants classified as\nrecently infected in 11 of these 12 city districts, with\nthe greatest proportions classified as recently infected in\nthe eastern (Krasnogvardeisky, 18.5%) and central\n(Vasilyostorvsky, 20.0% and Kirovsky, 18.5%) districts of the\ncity (figure 1). Only Kirovsky district had a significantly higher\nproportion of incident HIV cases compared to the rest of the\nDiscussion\nOur findings reveal a very high HIV incidence rate among IDU\nin St Petersburg Russia, indicating that this vulnerable\npopulation remains at the core of HIV acquisition and\nHIV incidence among IDU in Russia 615\ntransmission. Though our analysis revealed a range of possible\n(see below for discussion of this range), each of our estimates\nremain above acceptable standards in light of evidence that\nHIV prevention approaches for IDU have proven effective in\nreversing HIV epidemics in other parts of the world.24,25 This\nremarkably high estimate of HIV incidence is worrisome for\nthe future course of the epidemic among IDU in Russia.\nyears to the previous estimate of 4.5/100 person-years\nThough it is difficult to directly compare these estimates\nbecause of different study designs and estimation method-\nologies (the earlier lower incidence may have been influenced\nby prevention counselling provided to participants during the\nprospective cohort study), our estimates are evidence of\ncontinued HIV transmission during a time when other parts\nof the world have been able to contain the HIV epidemic among\nIDU. Thus, expansion of prevention efforts is urgently needed\nin St Petersburg. Our finding that participants who were\nunemployed were significantly more likely to be recently\ninfected suggests that economically marginalized IDU may be\nat greater risk for HIV; future studies should investigate the\ndegree to which economic vulnerability is associated with\nunsafe drug behaviours or being in a risky social network. In\nthe meantime, HIV prevention efforts should focus on this\nhighly vulnerable group. The only behavioural correlate we\nidentified was not having injected in the past 30 days. This\nfinding was unexpected and is not readily explainable. One\npossible explanation is that individuals may suspect their\ninfection in the absence of HIV testing and reduce risk\nbehaviours to prevent transmission. Another possible explan-\nation is that individuals who inject sporadically and have\nperiods of stopping and re-starting are at greater risk for\ninfection. This finding could also be the result of type I statis-\ntical error in which the null hypothesis of no association is\nincorrectly rejected. Future work should seek to confirm or\nrefute this finding.\nGeographic spread of HIV throughout the city is another\nTable 1 Characteristics of IDU recruited in St. Petersburg Russia, 2005\u00ad08, by HIV status, and comparison of HIV incident with HIV\nnegative and HIV longstanding participants\nCharacteristic Total\nHIV\nincident,\nn (%)\nHIV\nnegative,\nn (%)\nHIV prevalentc,\nn (%)\nP-value for\nHIV incident\nvs. negative\nP-value for\nHIV incident\nvs. prevalent\nGender\nAge, years\nEducation\nCurrently employed for pay\nPrimary mode of transport\nHomeless during past year\nDuration of injection drug use\nOpioid use in past 6 months\nStimulant use in past 6 months\nInjection drug use in past 30 days\nFrequency of use in past 30 days\nReceptive syringe sharingb\nDistributive syringe sharingb\nSharing of drug equipmentb\na: Totals may not add to 677 due to missing data\nb: In the past 30 days\nc: Excluding incident cases\n616 European Journal of Public Health\nsignificant clusters of incident cases in several central and\neastern districts of the city (in Petrogradsky and on the\nborder between Krasnogvardeisky and Nevsky, respectively).26\nOur analysis also revealed a high proportion of incident cases\nin these areas, but we further observed incident cases spread\nmore widely throughout the city in the vast majority of\ndistricts (11 of 12) from which we recruited participants, and\nnew clusters eastward and southward in the Vasilyostrovsky\nand Kirovsky districts. Taken together, these data suggest\nthat focal areas of HIV transmission are expanding\nthroughout the city.\nThis analysis served another important purpose: it allowed\nus to compare HIV estimates in a cross-sectional sample\nbetween traditional retrospective cohort methods and a more\nrecently developed serological assay. Even after adjusting for\ntest performance, our estimates derived from the BED EIA\nwere substantially higher (80%) than retrospective cohort\nestimation. This is likely due to high frequency of misclassifi-\ncation of the BED EIA of long-standing infections as recently\ninfected. High rates of false positive BED results have not been\nuncommon, and our estimated false positive rate of 17% fell\nwithin the range of estimates observed in other locations\nRwanda and Zambia17). The discrepancy in estimates derived\nfrom different methods could also be due to bias in the\nretrospective cohort estimate if, for example, recently\ninfected individuals were systematically excluded from that\nanalysis because they did not report a previous HIV test.\nWhile it is known that all three of these methods (two\ncorrection formulas and the cohort method) contain sources\nof error,27 a strength in using multiple methods as we have\ndone here is to produce a range of estimates that can achieve\nmore plausible results.\nThis study has several limitations that are important to\nconsider. First, the clade of HIV circulating among IDUs in\nSt Petersburg, subtype Afsu\n,28 is different from those used in\nthe development of BED. Although the assay was designed to\novercome problems associated with different subtypes,11 its\nsensitivity and specificity for subtype Afsu\nis unknown.\nSecond, our study is subject to limitations that are inherent\nin the use of self-reported information regarding HIV testing\nhistories including dates and results. In this setting where\nHIV testing coverage is sub-optimal and often not\nvoluntary,10 infrequent testing and inaccurate reporting\ncould influence our results. Our results could be biased if\nthose who had never had an HIV test (22% of the sample)\ndiffered systematically from those who had been previously\ntested with respect to HIV status and examine covariates.\nThird, our findings are limited by our relatively small\nsample size. Use of the BED EIA for incidence estimation is\nrecommended for use with large samples;12 thus our findings\nfrom a sample of 691 individuals produced a wide range of\nestimates for the false positive rate and did not permit\nestimation of how specificity varies for sub-populations16 or\ndirect estimation of the mean seroconversion period, another\nimportant parameter for incidence estimation using BED\nEIA.14 However, our calculation of 95% CI for incidence\nestimates account for the size of our sample and still reflect\nFigure 1 Map of HIV incident, HIV prevalent and HIV negative participants among 670 IDU recruited in St Petersburg Russia\n2005\u00ad08, by city district (size of circle proportionate to number of participants recruited from each district)\nHIV incidence among IDU in Russia 617\nhigh incidence estimates even at the lower bounds of\nconfidence. Given the limitations associated with each\nmethod, a major strength of this analysis was the use of\nmultiple methods to provide a range of estimates.\nWe conclude that the BED EIA may be a useful tool for\nestimating HIV incidence in cross-sectional studies when\nadditional information to calculate adjustment parameters\nand measures of test performance is available. Further\nresearch is needed to critically assess the utility of the BED\nEIA in Russia. Much more pressing, the high estimates of\nincidence by all methods underscore the urgent need for\nexpanded prevention efforts, both primary and secondary, to\nreduce the high HIV transmission in this setting, and\nprevention efforts will need to be widespread throughout the\ncity. Methods of harm reduction that have been shown to\nreduce HIV transmission in IDU populations include\nincreased syringe access, drug treatment and expanded\nanti-retroviral therapy. These programmes are not currently\nwidely available in Russia.29,30 We hope that our research\nfindings will be used to prompt prevention efforts on the\nscale needed to reverse one of the world's most rapidly\nescalating HIV epidemics.\n"
