    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Findings from the 1995 National Nursing Home Survey suggest\nthat elderly Americans are reducing their use of nursing home care. The num-\nbers reflect a change in the role of the nursing home, as defined in this survey.\nBy 1995 nursing facilities were increasingly focusing on patients with greater\ndisability and postacute care needs. Preferred alternatives, most notably home-\ndelivered care and assisted living, were likely filling the gap left by declining\nnursing home use. Better population-based studies are needed to track emerg-\ning trends and ascertain whether elders with disabilities are receiving the care\nthey need. Such data could inform development of better public and private\nfinancing strategies for long-term care.\nThe nursing home is a key provider of long-term care for\nelderly persons with functional disabilities. However, the\n1995 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) showed a de-\ncline in the rate of nursing home use for elderly Americans. Falling\nprevalence of disability may have been responsible for some of that\ndecline, but shifts to other types of care, notably home-delivered\ncare and assisted living, were likely more important in filling the gap\nleft by declining nursing home use.\nThese findings provide an opportunity to consider the demo-\ngraphic and policy forces that are reducing the prominence of the\nnursing home sector. These trends appear to have supported the\nnatural evolution of a long-term care continuum. Ongoing data col-\nlection across the breadth of the continuum would reveal whether\nelders who would have been in nursing homes in 1985 (the \"missing\nelders\") are receiving care in other settings or are going without\nneeded services. Such data could alert policymakers to the impacts\nof new policies and trends and could inform the development of\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nChristine Bishop is a research professor at the Heller Graduate School, Brandeis Univer-\nsity, and a staff member at Brandeis's Institute for Health Policy.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Sample persons are randomly selected from a list\nof residents in each facility on the survey date.1 Because the survey\nhas been conducted on the same basis at several points in time, it is\nused to track trends in the provision of nursing home care. Statistics\nfor 1995 that were not available in published sources were computed\nby the author using the NNHS public-use file for nursing home\nresidents age sixty-five and older at the time of the survey. Compari-\nsons for 1985 are from published NNHS statistics.2\nsamples suggests some unexpected shifts in the way elders are using\nthe nursing home. First, the proportion of persons age sixty-five and\nolder staying overnight in a nursing facility on the survey date fell\ndecline in only ten years.3 If 1985 rates of use by age and sex were\napplied to the 1995 elderly population, almost a quarter of a million\nmore elders would have been in nursing facilities on the survey date.\nThis decline was most striking (more than twenty per thousand) for\nthe oldest old (Exhibit 1). This portion of the elderly population, the\nmost rapidly growing segment, still makes up more than half of the\ntotal elderly nursing home population (Exhibit 2).\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

If the prevalence of\ndisability among the elderly were falling, we would expect fewer\nelders to seek nursing home care. The National Long-Term Care\nSurvey (NLTCS), which includes both community-resident and in-\nstitutionalized elders in its sample frame, indeed found that disabil-\nportion of elders experiencing at least one difficulty in performing\nan instrumental or physical activity of daily living (ADL) had fallen\nto 21.3 percent. Almost half of the 3.6-percentage-point decline in\nthe age-standardized rate of disability occurred between 1989 and\n1994.5 However, this promising trend cannot account for the full\ndrop in rates of nursing home use.\nAre nursing homes serving high-need patients at the expense\nof lower-need elders? The role of the nursing facility (as identified\nin the NNHS) is changing. Persons who were in a nursing home on\nthe survey date in 1995 were slightly more likely to have specific\ndisabilities than were their counterparts in 1985. Disability of nurs-\ning home residents can increase while disability rates in the popula-\ntion fall (or remain constant) only if nursing homes are being more\nselective and serving a more-disabled segment of the population.\nEvidence of this changing role is suggested by NNHS staffing data:\nNursing facilities offered more hours of care per patient day in 1995\nthan they did in 1985. Nursing home residents' higher disability level\nsuggests that some less-disabled elders who would have been in a\nthe question: Are the missing elders with (lower levels of) disabili-\nties receiving services, and if so, where?\nHas limited capacity kept elders out of nursing homes? In the\nabsence of sufficient nursing home beds, elders with disabilities\nmight have been stranded in community residences, unable to get\naccess to needed care. In fact, the supply of nursing facility care, as\nidentified by the NNHS sample frame, has not kept pace with the\ngrowth of the elderly population. To accommodate the age-specific\nhave been necessary to add 271,000 beds to the nation's supply of\nnursing facility beds, an increase of 17 percent. Between 1985 and\nencompassed by the NNHS sample frame--an increase of 9 per-\ncent--and many of these were in hospital-based facilities.\nFurthermore, in 1995 many more nursing home beds were filled\nby a group of patients who were barely in evidence in 1985: those\nreceiving Medicare-financed postacute care. The absolute increase\nin the number of Medicare patients observed in nursing facility beds\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

If we\nmeasure bed capacity excluding the beds taken up by Medicare\npatients in both years, we find a decrease of 11,000 beds in nursing\nfacility bed supply available for non-Medicare residents, a reduction\nof about 1 percent in total bed supply. In effect, all of the decade's\nincrease in nursing facility capacity was being devoted to the bur-\ngeoning Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF) population.\nHowever, the decline in effective capacity of nursing facilities did\nnot appear to be constraining use. In the aggregate, the occupancy\nrate of nursing home beds has been falling, from 92 percent in 1985\nempty beds are a natural adjunct to the increase in short-stay use:\nMedicare-oriented nursing facilities have unpredictable admissions\nand high turnover per bed and are almost guaranteed to have more\nempty beds than do facilities of similar size serving long-stay pa-\ntients and admitting new residents from community waiting lists.\nBut, taken at face value, the empty beds observed on the survey date\nwould have been sufficient to serve a great many of the \"missing\nelders.\" Lack of capacity was not forcing elders to remain in other\nsettings.\nCan more care at home account for lower use rates? By 1995\nmore elders with disabilities were receiving health and personal care\nat home than ever before, and this shift might account for the decline\nin nursing home use rates. Medicare home health use grew phe-\n9.6 percent of all aged Medicare beneficiaries used Medicare home\nnumber of visits per user shot up, from twenty-five to eighty. Elders\nwith disabilities as well as medical needs can receive Medicare-paid\nsupportive care from home health aides once they qualify. The clari-\nfied regulations made it possible for some beneficiaries to receive\nvery long and even indefinite home health episodes. Medicare bene-\nficiaries receiving more than 150 visits formed a small proportion of\nhome health users, but they numbered approximately 400,000 in\n1994--outnumbering our \"missing elders.\"9 Less in the national\nspotlight, Medicaid-funded home-delivered services increased at\nrates comparable to Medicare home health services over the same\nperiod, as Medicaid waiver programs were developed to counteract\nMedicaid's bias toward institutional care. At least some of these\nlong-stay home health patients might have entered a nursing facility\nif public sources had not supported their care.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J u l y / A u g u s t 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Some elders with disabilities who would have re-\nsided in nursing homes in 1985 may have sought other care settings\nin 1995, but lack of data makes this very difficult to assess.12 The U.S.\ncensus classifies persons as residing either in households or in group\nquarters, which include both institutions (most notably nursing\nfacilities) and other noninstitutional group quarters, such as room-\ning or boarding houses, group foster care, or board-and-care homes.13\nAlternatives to nursing home care are found in all of these residen-\ntial arrangements but are enumerated only infrequently, in the de-\ncennial census. The census classifies both small board-and-care ar-\nrangements and apartments in assisted-living facilities as\nhouseholds, not institutions.14 Long-term institutions for persons\nwith psychiatric and developmental disabilities are shrinking even\nas their populations are living longer. The growing population of\naging veterans has special access to some types of long-stay institu-\ntions and group quarters and may prefer them to conventional nurs-\ning homes. Because the census does not ask about disability of resi-\ndents or amount of care provided in any of these settings, it is not\npossible to say whether the \"missing elders\" have found quasi-insti-\ntutional arrangements that are meeting their needs.15\nHowever, a living arrangement that falls within the census's\n\"household\" category may be growing most rapidly beyond the pur-\nview of institutional surveys such as the NNHS. Assisted living,\nindependent housing that provides access to disability care, has\nbeen hailed as a \"new paradigm\" for elders with disabilities.16 Be-\ncause the market for such housing is aimed at elders who can pay for\ntheir care, growth in this market segment may explain the NNHS\nfinding noted above: the decline in the absolute number of elders\nsurvey dates. It is difficult to estimate how many older persons are\n\"Despite unfavorable demographic trends, informal, unpaid\nsupport continues to sustain care for older persons living at home.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 4\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Apartment-style housing designed for\nthe elderly, even when accompanied by group dining and access to\npersonal care, is included in the housing stock by census definition.\nThus, residents of assisted-living facilities, independent living units\nin continuing-care retirement communities, and supportive elderly\nhousing are considered members of households and are not counted\nas living in group quarters. In the absence of clear definitions of new\nresidential arrangements, only surveys that ask about disability and\ncare provision can capture trends in these special residences.17\nImplications For Policy\nBy 1995 developments in the Medicare postacute care benefit and\ntrends in the private long-term care market were perhaps beginning\nto accomplish what long-standing Medicaid cost containment ef-\nforts had not: They were reducing the preeminence of the nursing\nhome in the long-term care continuum. However, the policy devel-\nopments and secular trends responsible for a changing nursing\nhome role are not necessarily permanent. New developments may\nreinforce or reverse the positive trend observed for 1995.\nMost notably, policies set in motion by the Balanced Budget Act\n(BBA) of 1997 are unsettling the nursing home industry and other\nlong-term and postacute care providers. The BBA's Interim Payment\nSystem (IPS) for Medicare home health services is reducing access\nto home-delivered care, especially for beneficiaries with very long\nstays. At the same time, changes in Medicare and Medicaid nursing\nfacility payment policy enacted in the BBA are likely to reduce the\nflow of public resources to nursing homes, just as demand from\nprivate patients also is declining. State initiatives that combine\nMedicare and Medicaid funding streams for dual eligibles are likely\nto lead to still different patterns of use for nursing home and home-\ndelivered services. Also, more elders are using their own resources to\nexpress their preferences for noninstitutional care: Assisted living is\ngrowing, and more people are buying private long-term care insur-\nance that covers care at home as well as in institutions. These devel-\nopments are likely to lead to further \"downsizing\" of the nursing\nhome sector relative to the elderly population. As private and Medi-\ncare patients leave the nursing home market, Medicaid programs\nmay have to pay more to preserve adequate access for persons in the\ngreatest need of institutional long-term care.\nAs emerging BBA effects suggest, public policies and market\ntrends can have unforeseen effects on long-term care utilization\npatterns. These changes, especially those that increase unmet need,\ncan occur \"off the radar screen\" of established surveys.

Comparable data for home health\nproviders could track some providers' responses to BBA policy\nchanges. In the end, however, we need population-based surveys\nwith sound identification of care environments. Statistics centered\non persons with disabilities and their care, rather than on particular\ntraditional sites of care, can track how well disability needs are\nbeing met--for example, for Medicare home health recipients\nserved by agencies unable to survive under the IPS, or for beneficiar-\nies likely to have had very long or intensive home health stays prior\nto BBA payment changes. Public and private initiatives in the fi-\nnancing of long-term care then would have a better opportunity to\nfill gaps and continue the positive developments of the past decade.\nPreparation of this paper was supported by the Commonwealth Fund.
