    "abstract": "Abstract. The concept of well-being has become prominent within national policy goals in the UK\nsince the end of the 1990s. However, the concept of well-being remains ill defined, an instability that\nis increasingly understood as problematic to policy making. We engage with this terminological\ninstability through an exploration of how the concept of well-being is practised discursively in local\ngovernance and critically examine the place of the concept in local policy making. In contrast to the\ncurrent enthusiasm to define and measure well-being, we argue that the conceptual instability has\ninherent value for local governance. The concept of well-being is practised through a number of\npotentially conflicting discourses, but it is exactly this conceptual instability that enables a local\nnegotiation and combination of alternative policy frameworks for local place-shaping strategies. As\nsuch, well-being not only is an overarching goal of governance but also contributes to the dynamics\nof the policy process.\nWithin this a mainstream approach has emerged to operationalise well-being. First,\nresearch mostly takes a normative approach to definition and deals with the abstract\nnature of the concept by breaking it down into constitutive components (see, for\nexample, Stiglitz et al, 2009). Debates concern the identification of independent\ndimensions and the relative value of objective and subjective elements (Deneulin and\nSecond, these philosophical elaborations of the dimensions to well-being underpin\napplied, quantitative research on assessment and measurement and on the identifica-\ntion of associated variables (Clarke et al, 2006; Huppert et al, 2005; McGillivray and\nmon understanding of well-being as a quality that inheres to the individual. Well-being\nmay be influenced by factors and processes from the individual to the global in scale\nand reach; it may be an objective characteristic or a subjective assessment; it may refer\nto a current state or a projection into the future, but the concept of well-being itself\nis individual in scale.\nThis treatment of well-being as an individual attribute has not always been the\ncase. Sointu (2005) documents the changing dominance of different competing defini-\ntions of well-being since 1985 in the UK press. She identifies a clear shift in the term\nfrom a collective attribute, mostly associated with economic well-being, through to an\nindividual attribute, largely related to a positive mental state. Sointu interprets this\nshift in the dominant use of the term well-being as concurrent with changes to the\nmodes of governance and welfare provision grouped under the label of neoliberalism.\nThere is almost no analysis to date that explores how well-being is conceptualised\nin relation to different governance regimes. Dean (2003) builds a conceptual analysis\nof ``moral and political accounts\u00f6through which people in different social and cultural\ncontexts might understand and contend with ... threats to well-being'' (page 2). He\nmaps such potential discursive repertoires of well-being along two dimensions: first, a\nuniversal ^ local dimension which differentiates the systems and structures through which\nsocial, economic, and political resources are coordinated from a local agency through\nwhich meanings, behaviour, and feelings are constructed; second, a contractarian ^\nsolidaristic dimension of traditions of citizenship and policy which differentiates subjects\nas bargaining and competitive from subjects as attached or cooperative. Contemporary\nneoliberal governance maps high on the universal and contractarian dimensional poles.\nDean's conceptual framework centres on discourses. This reflects arguments that\nmuch of governing is about defining the situation through the discursive construction\nof frameworks within which problems and policy responses are defined and negotiated\n(Hajer and Laws, 2006). Within a neoliberal discursive repertoire the individual is\nreassigned as the primary unit of action and analysis, as the arbiter of policy options\nthrough consumer choice, and the site for self-management and self-actualisation\nbetween neoliberalism and well-being. Well-being, treated as an individual quality, is\nultimately the outcome of individual choices and actions for both self and closely\nconnected others. Writers drawing on Foucault's notion of governmentality (1991)\nexamine how this apparent space for self-actualisation is one in which choice is shaped\nand directed through a complex interplay of multiple rationalities and technologies\net al, 2006). Local government is thus tasked to enable social inclusion through\nan active, responsibilised engagement in their own well-being (Barnett, 2003). Systems\nof audit and accounting, monitoring and surveillance are central to a neoliberal\ngovernance regime, in which standardised indicators and performance targets for\nlocal government may effectively shape both goals and visions of local government\n(Miller and Rose, 2008; Rydin, 2007). Through a governmentality lens, well-being holds\npromise as both discursive rationality and calculative technology by which to promote\nand valorise self-actualisation and self-responsibilisation as part of a competent\ncitizenry. The concept can enable everyday individual behaviours to be connected\ninto wider rationalities of government through, on the one hand, a moral imperative\nfor self-management and, on the other, the external definition of responsible choices.\nHowever, realising this promise is still an emergent process. The imperative for better\nmeasurement of well-being and the dominant uses of the term in both academia and\nthe mass press can be seen as reflecting this process. To what extent, then, is this\nprocess evident in the mobilisation of the concept of well-being in local governance\nin the UK?\n2 National structuring of well-being\nCentral government in the UK positions well-being prominently in policy goals across\nvarious sectors, including children, health, and sustainable development. The Local\nGovernment Act, 2000, makes well-being key to the obligation of local government\nto elaborate a local Sustainable Community Strategy (DCLG, 2008b). Local govern-\nment is situated as a place-shaping agency informed and guided by the Local Strategic\nPartnership, a nonstatutory forum for voluntary involvement of local communities in\nlocal governance (DCLG, 2006). The Sustainable Community Strategy is operational-\nised and monitored through the local area agreement which is composed of a series\nof targets and monitoring tools to evaluate and assess progress (DCLG, 2008b). Local\nauthority targets are developed within The National Performance Framework designed\nto assess performance and legislated through the Local Government and Public\nInvolvement in Health Act, 2007.(1) This provides a national set of 198 standardised\nindicators from which each local authority selects 35 in agreement with central govern-\nment plus 17 statutory targets on early years and educational progress (DCLG, 2007).\nA governmentality approach expects the requirement for conceptual goals to\nbe translatable into defined and measurable objects to in turn structure vision so\nas to constrain local priority definition by specifying a set of standardised, universal\nmeasures (Enticott and Entwistle, 2007; Rydin, 2007). However, empirical studies of\nlocal governance demonstrate resistance to, or at least reconstruction of, the influence\nof both the discursive rationalities and such calculative technologies. Some local\ngovernment officers will have trained within or have political sympathies with alter-\nnative discursive repertoire of governance, particularly those that map onto Dean's\npoles of local and solidaristic (2003). Moreover, various policy issues and concepts\nare characterised by overt contestation which make resistance and reconstruction\nmore likely (Rydin, 2007). Operationalising well-being constitutes such a policy issue,\nrecognised as a challenge to define and measure (Allin, 2007; HM Government,\nThe influence of an imperative for measurement on conceptual definition is evident\nin examining how well-being is structured at national level. The 2006 government white\npaper, Strong and Prosperous Communities (DCLG, 2006) outlines national govern-\nment's priority challenges (see table 1). Despite the broad usage of the concept of\nwell-being in central government directives for Sustainable Community Strategies\n(DCLG, 2008a), sustainable development goals (HM Government, 2005), and national\npriorities for measurement and monitoring (Allin, 2007), here the term well-being\nis practised within only two of the national challenges: ``Health and Well-being'' where\n(2) See also The Office for National Statistics website at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/people-places/\ncommunities/societal-wellbeing.\nWell-being in local governance 135\nTable 1.

The National Performance\nFramework (DCLG, 2007) presents the national indicator set by themes (see table 1),\nand similarly places well-being in relation to health, this time adult health, and the\nEvery Child Matters goal of economic well-being. The national strategy and the related\nset of performance indicators thus resolve tensions between concept and indicator by\nstructuring the concept of well-being into two distinct and contained fields.\n3 Analysing local Sustainable Community Strategies\nWe take as our case material the Sustainable Community Strategies. Given that local\ngovernment is tasked with enabling self-responsibilisation and self-actualisation, the\nterm well-being may be mobilised to this end. But, given the contestation around\nthe definition of well-being, the term may also afford a conceptual tool for resistance\nat local level to neoliberal discursive regimes. We explore how well-being is practised at\ntwo levels within the strategy documents: first, the way local authorities frame their\nvision and priority themes, which we have called the structuring of well-being; second,\nthe discursive practices of the term well-being and the implicit constellations of themes\nand meanings.\nIn selecting a small number of case-study documents, we set two criteria: we excluded\nlarge local authorities likely to be more powerful in their dealings with central government;\nwe wanted the local authorities to share regional concerns and regionally defined priorities\nto better compare locally determined practices. Thus, we selected the Sustainable\nCommunity Strategies from three relatively small urban boroughs within the Tees Valley\nregion in the northeast of England: Darlington, Hartlepool, and Stockton which are\nadjacent along the north shore of the River Tees. The three Sustainable Community\nStrategies were all published towards the end of 2008, together with the Local Area\nAgreements (Darlington Partnership, 2008; Hartlepool Partnership, 2008; Stockton\nRenaissance, 2008). The documents are complemented by interviews with two key local\ngovernment officers in each borough, purposively selected as key in the production and\nsubsequent management of the documents. Semistructured interviews were undertaken\nbetween June 2008 and March 2009 on a one-to-one basis and lasted around an hour.\nAll interviews were recorded and transcribed before analysis. In line with assurances\nof confidentiality, informants are not identified by local authority when quoted.\nThe analysis proceeds in three stages. First, the local structures of well-being\u00f6that\nis, how well-being is placed within the overall visions and priority themes of the local\nstrategies\u00f6are described and compared with the national structures. Second, the discursive\npractices of well-being are mapped by the themes associated with the practice of the term\nand against a set of dimensions adapted from Ereaut and Whiting (2008), listed in table 2.\nTable 2. Dimensions to well-being (source: adapted from Ereaut and Whiting, 2008).\nDimension Description\nScale Individual or collective; human or other entities\nAuthority to define Subjective, self-defined or objective, expert defined\nValue An end in itself or as necessary to other ends\nUnified concept Reducible to elements or a holistic totality\nPermanent or transitory A stable state or a dynamic process\nCriteria Neutral, absence of something wrong, or better than neutral\nResponsibility Located within social and institutional structures or individual\nagency\nWell-being in local governance 137\nThird, local agency is explored through the meanings given to well-being by the key local\ngovernment officers interviewed. In the final section we draw on this three-step analysis to\nreflect on the place of well-being in local government policy making.\n4 Local structures of well-being\nThe Darlington and Hartlepool strategies are structured round a vision to improve\nlives and places and, whilst well-being is not explicitly used, both emphasise oppor-\ntunities for everyone to realise their potential. In Darlington the key concepts are\ninclusion\u00f6a Darlington whose benefits are for all people\u00f6and place, which has\nvarious aspects including environmental concerns. The economy is not positioned as\nan aim in itself, but as a means to the people and place-related goals:\n``we want to make the most of our potential for greater prosperity, and open up\naspiration and opportunity for everybody'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 7).\nHartlepool's vision is expressed through a list of desirable qualities for Hartlepool, itself\ndefined as community and physical environment. These community and environmental\nqualities will enable social inclusion and benefits for all.\n``Hartlepool will be an ambitious, healthy, respectful, inclusive, thriving and outward-\nlooking community, in an attractive and safe environment, where everyone is able\nto realise their potential'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 5).\nBy contrast, the Stockton vision echoes the well-being domains in the Local Government\nAct of 2000, being structured by economic, environmental, and social goals:\n``Stockton-on-Tees driving Economic Renaissance... .\nAn enhanced quality of place... .\nEnhanced well-being and achievement for local people'' (Stockton Renaissance,\nThe economy is placed at the forefront of the vision as an end in itself, with\nenvironmental and social ends taking an equal, parallel, and intersecting role. Only\nStockton uses the word well-being in the vision statement and, by placing it into the\nsocial strand, explicitly relates the concept to people and individuals.\nThe visions are developed through sets of themes which reflect closely, but not\nexactly, the indicative themes of national government (see table 1). All documents\nidentify a theme related to the economy, although this varies as to what is included\nbeyond commerce and jobs. They all also contain themes related to the safety of\ncommunities, health, and the environment. Hartlepool and Stockton echo the national\ntheme of stronger communities. Children and young people are high profile in all\ndocuments but there is variation in how this category is placed. Stockton alone\nspecifically identifies demographic groups\u00f6children and young people, and older\nadults\u00f6echoing the national performance framework. The other documents use cate-\ngories of aspiration and lifelong learning for the whole population, but within which\nchildren and young people are given a particular focus. Hartlepool and Stockton\nexpressly diverge from the national themes by placing leisure and the arts amongst\ntheir themes; these are embedded within other themes in the Darlington document.\nThe national government's theme of tackling exclusion and promoting equality has\nbeen incorporated into both vision and themes in all local authority strategies but\nnot positioned as a separate category.\nThus, whilst the national themes are mostly echoed through all the local Sustainable\nCommunity Strategies, there are important variations both from the national structure\nand between the adjacent local authorities in the framing and language of challenges.\n5 Mapping the discursive practices of well-being\n5.1 Themes of well-being\nThe term well-being is used least in Stockton where practice almost exclusively relates\nto individual health:\n``Our vision is for a healthier Stockton where all residents are able to take control of\ntheir own physical and mental health and well-being ...'' (Stockton Partnership,\nThe few occurrences in which well-being does not refer to health relate to children\ntogether with a connection between well-being and achievement, which can be traced\nthrough different demographic groups, individuals, and communities.\nSimilarly, in Hartlepool the term well-being most often relates to mental and\nphysical well-being and, again, the exceptions relate to children. However, since\nHartlepool's agenda for children and young people cuts across its eight themes, well-\nbeing is placed and practised not only under the theme health and well-being, but also\nunder the themes of jobs and the economy in relation to the Every Child Matters\ngoal of promoting economic well-being (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 31) and of\ncommunity safety:\n``where ... all adults take responsibility for their [children's] safety and well-being''\nAdult well-being also features under the jobs and the economy theme in an argument\nthat\n``residents enjoying better physical and mental well-being as a result of being in\nemployment'' (page 33).\nThe Darlington document expresses the most varied practice of the term well-\nbeing. Moreover, the expression beyond health does not exclusively relate to children.\nThe term well-being is placed under three of the five themes: healthier, aspiring, and\ngreener Darlington. The practice of the term well-being under the healthier theme\ncontrasts to the other documents by talking of fulfillment, as opposed to achievement:\n``happiness, fulfillment and well-being are central to the vision'' (Darlington Partnership,\nThe concept of emotional well-being is firmly embedded within a wide range of\nprocesses to:\n``enable people to be in control of their lives, have equality of opportunity and\naspiration, have access to the information and support they need to pursue\ntheir aspirations, to value their place in the community, and to treat one another\nwith respect and dignity\u00f6these objectives underpin emotional health and well-being''\nDarlington is also distinctive in an explicit reference to spiritual aspects of well-being:\n``[a] broader view of prosperity and aspiration as embracing spiritual and mental\nwell-being and the `social capital' of community involvement, as well as material\nWell-being is linked to community concerns of social relations, pleasant spaces, and\nequity:\n``Supporting informal leisure and health and well-being by reclaiming open space\nfor community use'' (page 35).\n``A philosophical forum for debate on issues of inclusion, equality and community\nwell-being'' (page 41).\n5.2 Conceptual dimensions of well-being\nThe detailed meanings implicit in the discursive practices of the term are mapped onto\na number of conceptual dimensions, listed in table 2.\nWell-being in local governance 139\nFirst, despite the dominance in current research of well-being as an individual\nattribute, several uses of the term reflect either collective or nonhuman scales, particularly\nin the Darlington strategy:\n``our focus on improvement, and particularly on tackling deprivation, should be\nmatched by care for the wellbeing of the whole community and the environment''\n``building the social inclusion and environmental well-being that are the desired\ncharacteristics of a sustainable community'' (page 5).\nHowever, the meaning of this collective use is uncertain. A connection to a notion of\nsustainability is implicit, as are attributes of inclusion, respect, and care.\nSecond, the majority of uses of the term well-being were in contexts where\nsome form of objective assessment of that well-being could be made by someone\nelse:\n``We will give priority to: improving sexual health, including a reduction in teenage\nconception rates; reducing levels of substance misuse; improving emotional\nand mental well-being including tackling bullying; halting the rise in obesity; and\nmaintaining low rates of infant mortality'' (Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 33).\nOnly a few cases indicated that people themselves might constitute the primary source\nof assessment: an unusual combination with spiritual well-being in Darlington; refer-\nences to happiness or fulfilment, also mostly in Darlington. By contrast, Hartlepool\nand Stockton eschew a subjective fulfilment in favour of `achievement' as amenable\nto objective measurement given its common association with children, education, and\nskills. However, the Stockton document does position perceptions of the local environ-\nment as a key influence on well-being\u00f6possibly a dimension to well-being, possibly\na factor affecting well-being, but certainly something to be assessed subjectively.\nThird, well-being was most often placed as an end in itself and never only as a\nmeans to another end:\n``Residents enjoying better physical and mental well-being as a result of being in\n``Recognising and accommodating the broader view of prosperity and aspiration as\nembracing spiritual and mental well-being and the `social capital' of community\ninvolvement, as well as material wealth'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 17).\nThus community well-being is valued for its own sake as well as for the well-being of\nthe individuals comprising it. Economic well-being is positioned as the means for\nbetter future well-being, in other senses, for children and adults; environmental well-\nbeing is positioned both as an important end in itself and as part of sustainable\nliving.\nFourth, despite claims that well-being captures a holistic experience of living, the\nmultiple dimensions comprising well-being are treated as different spheres of action\u00f6\nspheres which are both distinguishable components of well-being and distinguishable\ninfluences on well-being. This blurring enables a reduction of well-being to these\ncomponents for monitoring and policy evaluation:\n``Individuals need to be able to develop their own integrated package to improve\ntheir well-being, including for example: employment opportunities; health improve-\nment; social care; education and lifelong learning; leisure and cultural activities''\nFifth, this components approach and the need to measure well-being results in the\nconcept largely treated as a static state,\n``improving emotional and mental well-being including tackling bullying; halting the\nrise in obesity; and maintaining low rates of infant mortality... looked after children\nwill have similar levels of physical and mental health'' (page 33),\nalthough implicit reference to the life-course emerges occasionally:\n``good health and wellbeing for older people, rooted in healthy lifestyle choices\n``Enhancing well-being and achievement of children and adults will ensure ... life\nopportunities for all our residents'' (Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 9).\nSixth, there is confusion as to whether well-being is more than a neutral state.\nWell-being is often used rather rhetorically as a positive emotional state, but reverts\nin the detail to a biomedical absence of mental ill-health:\n``to promote mental well-being, to reduce suicide rates and support people with\nmental health problems'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 42).\nThis reduction to an absence of ill-health in part reflects the imperative to describe\nand monitor the pursuit of well-being through measurable indicators. However, positive\nmeanings to the term are evident in other contexts:\n``to support individuals to enjoy their lives and achieve wholeness and mental\n``To improve the health, emotional development and well-being of all children, young\npeople and their families'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 65).\nLastly, the documents combine different levels of responsibility. The local authority\nreasserts its traditional responsibilities for the provision of services but expands this\nwith a brief for improving the context in which others can make responsible choices.\nNonetheless, children are brought almost entirely under the ambit of national and local\ngovernment:\n``We will promote the health, wellbeing and achievement of children and young\nThe emphasis on individual responsibilities, especially for health and healthy lifestyles,\nis evident throughout:\n``where all residents are able to take control of their own physical and mental health\nand wellbeing, through living healthy and active lifestyles'' (page 36).\nMore interesting is the positioning of the community as taking responsibility for\nsubjective aspects of well-being:\n``Regarding the happiness, fulfillment and well-being of individuals as legitimate\nconcern for the community as a whole'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 12).\nThis exercise in mapping the place and practice of the term well-being within the\nSustainable Community Strategies indicates three concurrent discourses. The most\nfrequent use of the term through all three documents relates to health and well-being,\nconstructed as: individual in scale; defined objectively by others; a state with compo-\nnent elements, although reference to the life course is noted; expressing ambivalence\nas to whether well-being is a neutral state characterised by the absence of definable\nfeatures of ill-health or a positive state characterised by what remain ill-defined\ncriteria; strongly defined as ultimately the responsibility of the self. This practice is\nso ubiquitous it clearly constitutes the contemporary dominant discourse for well-\nbeing. In Hartlepool and Stockton any other conceptual associations beyond the\ndominant discourse of health and well-being mostly relate to children, and largely\nreflect achieving economic well-being, one of the goals of central government's\nEvery Child Matters policy. This then constitutes a secondary discourse of well-being\nspecifically in relation to children, also individual in scale, defined objectively by\nothers, a state with component elements although the dynamism of development is\nWell-being in local governance 141\nnoted, positive rather than neutral and with responsibility lying largely with the state\nand local government. These two primary discourses echo the national government\nmobilisations of well-being.\nHowever, two other well-being discourses emerge associated with concepts of com-\nmunity and environment. The meanings in relation to community involve desirable\nattributes such as inclusion, respect, and care whilst those in relation to environment\ninclude future prospects and sustainability. Similarly to the two more dominant\ndiscourses, these characteristics of well-being are mostly defined objectively by others.\nThe term well-being is used with positive rather than neutral connotations, as in the\nchildren and well-being discourse. The two discourses differ from the other two in\nthe focus on collective and nonhuman specific scales. They differ from each other\nin that the community discourse treats well-being as a state with component elements\nsuch as inclusion, respect, and care, whilst the environment discourse treats well-being\nas dynamic through the concerns with sustainability and future prospects.\nCommunity and inclusion and environment and sustainability are in themselves\nleading concepts and issues for contemporary governance and are prominent both\nin the name and throughout the Sustainable Community Strategies. Despite this, in\nrelation to well-being they emerge only as minor discourses, and significantly in only\none of the three strategies.\n6 Local agency and the place of well-being\nIn this section we examine the discursive practices of key local government officers in\nrelation to the four discourses of well-being identified from the Sustainable Community\nStrategies.\nIn line with the dominant discourse evident in both national and local government\ndocuments, the local government officers most often explicitly connected well-being to\nhealth:\n``it's interesting that you've picked it up and said well-being, rather than health and\nwell-being, because I think it's difficult to separate the two.''\nBut the connection reflects a social model of health in which multiple factors are\ninfluential:\n``It's more than the absence of ill-health, it's about access to wide variety of services,\nnot only just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life.''\n``Take the child protection agenda, child abuse, then that's actually about health\nand well-being ... about making sure that children and young people are safe ... if\nthey're not safe... they're not going to grow up, they'll have mental health problems\nand ... not get into work ... and the generations will carry on.''\nThinking about well-being through a social model of health requires consideration\nof the consequences of the actions of other sectors on health which thus broadens the\nscope of responsibility across government sectors:\n``colleagues in the Jobcentre Plus who look at well-being in terms of... financial and\neconomic well-being, but then actually acknowledging the knock-on effects that has\nin terms of health.''\n``It's the benefit of having a health and well-being group because ... it's that differ-\nent combination, so having someone from regeneration involved in that means that\nwhen we're looking at our new developments ... you think of the environment,\nwhat will it do ... . [In terms of] quality of life.''\nMoreover, this is an intersectoral responsibility that local government officers see\ntaken up:\n``Yes, it's in health and well-being but we've all got to contribute to this... there's real\nunderstanding that it involves all of us.''\nThe reduction of well-being to mental or emotional health found in the documents\nis echoed, but again draws on a broad social model of health:\n``I think prosperity is quite an important area that we need to push but not obviously\nto the detriment of well-being, prosperity at what cost, the pressure that prosperity\ncan bring on people and is the balance right, stresses and strains and balancing\nthat against well-being.''\nThe reduction to absence of ill-health is largely avoided by the local officers:\n``Well-being is, I would say is, a very generic title, you know. It is about what people\nactually think about their lives. So at the end of the day are they happy with their lives?''\nIn contrast to the extensive practice of a health and well-being discourse, inter-\nviewees draw little on the secondary discourse in which well-being is linked to economic\nwell-being of children. The presence in the documents reflects central government\nimperatives to include the Every Child Matters goals, but finds little engagement\nfrom local government officers beyond repetition of this agenda:\n``For children and young people, it isn't about well-being overall but it's about are\nthey a productive member of society?''\n``There's looking at economic well-being, that stems from the ECM [Every Child\nMatters] framework.''\nThe lack of attention to the children and well-being discourse indicates that,\nalthough national government rationalities may be operationalised in order to meet\nnational government requirements, they are not necessarily internalised. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence of a conscious resistance or conflict in the discursive practices\naround children and economic well-being.\nThe relationship with central government in setting indicators and targets shows\nmore explicit conflict:\n``There is always a worry that the central government drive is not always quite the\nsame as the local one.''\n``It's been quite testing particularly when we get down to targets. This is all about\ndelivering the community strategy but of course government have their priorities\nas well. So there was reconciliation to go on there.''\nThese comments belie any notion that the imposition of calculative regimes struc-\ntures local subjectivities into framing the practices of abstract concepts like well-being.\nMoreover, more detailed commentaries of how indicators relate to well-being show\nresistance to measurement as the final arbiter:\n``You can measure facets of it [well-being] ... but we have to be clear why we're\nmeasuring it and how we interpret it.''\n``I don't think you can measure well-being as such.''\nAssessment elicited not only evidence of resistance conceptually to national govern-\nment approaches, but also local conflicts. A number of local government officers\nstressed the importance of local negotiation in assessment:\n``a mix between the sort of lets count it, can we measure it, that performance\nmanagement ... it's just as really important that we care... there was the two camps\nand somewhere in the middle we managed to come together and say well actually\nas long as we can count some bits of it and have some subjective bits then that\nreally for us is well-being.''\nWell-being in local governance 143\n``but you can't escape politics, or can't come up with the perfect answer [about what\nwell-being is] so it's about discussion, negotiation, and reconciliation.''\nMost do propose that well-being needs breaking down into component elements for\nassessment. Nonetheless, several question whether this is enough to capture fully what\nwell-being is:\n``Whether in the end we measure well-being or measure strands within that holistic\nview. ... whether you can then bunch them all together and say, well, that's a picture\nof well-being, I don't even begin to know to be honest. I think the best measure\nis going out and talking to people and, you know, trying to synthesise the views as\nto the state of play.''\n``You can also think of the well-being of the community which has more factual\ncomponents like a strong economy and low unemployment, transport that works so\nyou can get to where you want to, low crime. So you've got all of these factual bases\nbut sitting on top of that or generated by it is well-being.''\nThere was also resistance to a solely objective assessment of well-being, equated\nwith indicators, viewed as missing important subjective accounts of well-being:\n``We need to measure a bit but also accept that a lot of it is subjective and somewhere\ntogether that will give us a well-being type approach.''\nNonetheless, whilst local accounts of measurement show a nuanced understanding\nof well-being, the concept is firmly treated as an attribute of individuals and an\nattribute that is shaped by individual choice and self-government:\n``It's more than the absence of ill-health, it's about access to wide variety of services,\nnot only just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life. In one word it's\nabout choice and creating opportunities for people to have choice and control over\ntheir own lives.''\nThe dominant discourse of health and well-being as individual health, as mental\nhealth, or emotional health or as a subjective state was at times explicitly challenged:\n``It's about how we live our daily lives, how we get on with our neighbours, how we\nmix in our communities, what events are going on in communities, how and where\nwe go shopping, how well we interact all of that stuff is much more important than\nthe NHS [National Health Service] and police are to the well-being agenda.''\nFurther challenges to the dominant discourse position well-being as dynamic within\na time-frame or a life-course approach, rather than as a static state:\n``It's very easy to say well-being is about mental health but actually aspirations are\nwell-being, or peace of mind is actually what it's about. Aspirations have got to be\nabout people tracking a course for themselves and saying they've achieved it and\nnot just accepting what they've got.''\nAlthough these framings of well-being largely operate at the individual scale, occa-\nsionally well-being is attributed to other scales of analysis. Whilst central government\ncharges local government with responsibility for telling the story of place and for a\nplace-shaping agenda, a few local actors explicitly link this to the concept of well-being:\n``So the sense of well-being through being ... as a community, we as a public have\na sense of well-being and confidence. The well-being of the borough is about the\nconfidence... that doesn't mean over-confidence or misplaced confidence.''\n``Something else that came through strongly... the need to build a much stronger,\nmore caring, cohesive community, recognition that we're getting to be a more diverse\ncommunity, so we get back to sort of core community values. They [the faith and\nvoluntary sectors] would ask really searching questions\u00f6why is prosperity so\nimportant, what do you mean by prosperity, what about spiritual prosperity?\nAnd then stuff about health, what's wrong with dying?''\nThis resonates with the alternative discourse of community and well-being identified\nfrom the Sustainable Community Strategies. The engagement of local government\nofficers with an alternative discourse of community and well-being, related to issues\nof care and inclusion, was provoked by central government's requirement that local\nauthorities work in partnership with other local agencies, particularly the voluntary\nand faith agencies:\n``Quite often when you produce these types of documents, the public sector dominates\nthe culture, but in ours the prevalent and dominant group is the voluntary and com-\nmunity sectors and we sat in the LSP [Local Strategic Partnership] with the voluntary\nsector saying, `this is our document, the voluntary sector wrote this you know.''\nThe wider prominence of environment and sustainability in UK governance is little\nreflected in relation to well-being. Moreover, the distinction between current and future\nwell-being, as expressed by the notion of sustainability, is explicitly understood as more\nthan environmental:\n``Well-being is about sustainability not only in environmental but economic and\nsocial terms. It's about creating economic, environmental and social circumstances\nwhich can be sustained into the future in ways that don't disadvantage particular\ngroups or particular areas.''\nThese explorations of the engagement of key local government officers with well-\nbeing in the production of the Sustainable Community Strategies show local agency\ncapacity to adopt central government framings without necessarily internalising these\nuncritically, to resist and adapt such framings for local purposes, and to go beyond\nsuch framings to reconcile them with alternative practices of the concept of well-being.\nIronically, perhaps, the mobilisation of alternative discourses in local governance is\nfacilitated exactly by some of the requirements placed upon local government by\nnational guidelines. The adherence to government directives to work in partnership\nwith other local actors generated a source of variation in conceptualising well-being.\nThe imperative to negotiate indicators and targets brought to the fore debates about\nwhat well-being really is, how it might be captured and assessed, and the role of\nmeasurement therein.\nThese negotiations around the meanings and practices of well-being do suggest that\nthe conceptual instability of well-being is problematic for the policy process (Ereaut\nand Whiting, 2008). But, whilst local government officers recognise the challenges of\na broad, abstract concept such as well-being in policy, they also stress its importance:\n``The sense of well-being is about having a vision for our communities, for our\nplaces. Place-shaping is effectively about the same, so sustainability, well-being,\nplace-shaping\u00f6they're all terms that don't easily define themselves and are open,\nof course, to being defined differently and exploited because of that. But I think\nwhen you're talking about what we're doing here, which is about defining a vision\nfor the future, then they are essential concepts.''\nIndeed, it may be that it is this very instability of the term well-being that infuses\nit with the potential to serve a creative function in locally negotiated priorities. This\nproposition is supported by local actors both in the quotations above relating to the\nmeasurement of well-being, and, here, explicitly positioning instability in the term\nwell-being as a provocation to creative discussion and thinking and the forging\nof partnerships:\n``I think that in a way because they [the terms well-being, sustainability, and place\nshaping] are not easily defined it is quite useful because it gives people a chance to\nsit down and thrash out what they, as a community, mean by that and that's more\nimportant than one person like me writing clever words in a document. It's actually\ngetting people together and agreeing what they are about.''\nWell-being in local governance 145\n7 Reflections on the place and practices of well-being in local governance\nThe copresence in the same documents of a mix of dominant and other more minor\ndiscourses of well-being supports the characterisation of the concept of well-being\nas confused and contradictory. However, we argue against those who position this\ninstability as problematic and of necessity indicating the need for more precise\ndefinition and measurement. Instead, we see the conceptual instability of well-being\nas enabling the local expression of voices contesting dominant ideologies of the self,\nresponsibility, and governance.\nThe mobilisation of well-being common in academia and in the mass press indi-\ncates how the concept might encapsulate the rationale for self-responsibilisation and\nself-actualisation within a neoliberal governance regime. However, for this to be\nrealised, the holistic resonance of well-being requires work on boundary setting to\ntranslate the concept into a measurable entity. The responsibilisation of the individual\nwithin neoliberalism makes it logical that well-being will be conceived of as an\nattribute of the individual. The need to translate any notion of well-being into perfor-\nmance indicators favours an approach that breaks the concept down into component\nparts. This is broadly consistent with much of the academic literature in which dimen-\nsions cover a wide range of facets of human life (Nussbaum, 2000; Stiglitz et al, 2009).\nHowever, the national and local policy vision documents, and often the key local\nactors, narrow the concept far more tightly through a dominant discourse of well-\nbeing as inseparably connected to health. This tightly bounded definition brings\nimportant losses in the potential value of the term. The cooption of well-being as an\nadjunct to health risks reducing the term to a mere synonym and the discursive\npractice of well-being in the national white paper does just this. In the local Sustain-\nable Community Strategies, further reductions are seen when the phrase indicates\nmental well-being, or even the absence of mental ill-health, and concentrates on\ndemographically defined and static categories such as children or the elderly rather\nthan on the continuous production of health throughout the life course. Even when well-\nbeing is framed into a social model of health, the dominance of health and well-being\nas a discourse undermines the potential for well-being to function as an intersectoral\nunifying concept.\nThe empirical mapping to identify different discourses of well-being by themes and\ndimensions complements Dean's (2003) conceptual matrix of potential negotiations\nof well-being by dimensions of welfare regime. The dominant discourses, and their\nassociated reductions, of health and well-being and of children and well-being, reso-\nnate with Dean's pole of contractarian welfare regimes. The alternative discourses of\ncommunity and well-being and of environment and well-being which involve collective\nand nonhuman scales\u00f6sustainability in relation to well-being, respect, and care\u00f6\nresonate with the opposite pole of solidaristic traditions. However, although Dean's\ndimensions were elaborated for ``different social and political contexts'' (page 2), the\nconfusion and contradiction within discursive practices across and within three similar\nlocal authorities demonstrates the coexistence of different `moral and political\naccounts' of well-being in the same social and political context. The local nongovern-\nmental and faith organisations had a key role in effecting the inclusion of elements of\nan alternative welfare regime into neoliberal framings. The particular significance here\nis that, first, the expression of this alternative framing is effected through the mobilisa-\ntion of distinct discourses of well-being and, second, that it is exactly the conceptual\nvagueness of the concept of well-being that enables potentially oppositional framings\nto coexist creatively within a single local authority strategy.\nAn open category of well-being provides an ideal conceptual tool through which\nto negotiate tensions between alternative political and moral accounts in relation to\nperformance and responsibility. We propose that conceptual complexity and instability\nhave inherent value for local governance; the danger lies in narrowing the scope of\nthe concept. Much research within the governmentality tradition has focused on local\nresistance to monitoring the calculative regimes of governance. But the key task for\nreleasing the potential of well-being as an emergent tool of neoliberal governance\nis boundary work to narrow the scope of how the concept is practised and this should\nbe the key arena for resistance. Already, the mobilisation of well-being other than as\nan outcome of self-management is practised only as minor discourses. Well-being needs\nto be seen not only as the final goal and outcome of government policy, requiring\nclosed definition and monitoring, but more importantly as part of the dynamics of the\npolicy process, a stimulus to critical debate about the nature of overarching policy\ngoals. The emergent and potential power of the term well-being is not as a calculative\nbut as a conceptual technology in which well-being is best comprehended as constella-\ntions of discursive practices through which place-shaping strategies may be negotiated\nand reconciled locally.\nReferences\nAllin P, 2007, ``Measuring societal wellbeing'' Economic and Labour Market Review 1 46 ^ 65\nBarnett N, 2003, ``Local government, New Labour and `Active Welfare': a case of `self\nresponsibilisation?'''

    "reduced_content": "1 Introduction\nIn the last twenty years high-income countries have witnessed an important move-\nment in the aspirations of public policy beyond meeting merely material goals towards\na range of outcomes captured through the use of the term well-being. In the United\nKingdom the concept of well-being is prominent as a goal of contemporary policy\nmaking: ``In order to get a better understanding and focus on wellbeing ... the govern-\nment will sponsor cross-disciplinary work ... to explore how policies might change\nGovernment Act obliges local government ``to set the overall strategic direction and\nlong-term vision for the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of a local area''\n(DCLG, 2008a, page 26). But the concept of well-being is itself ill defined, a term\nused in multiple different contexts with different meanings and policy implications.\nThis instability of meaning and the associated lack of shared understanding have\nbeen positioned as risks or barriers to communication and partnership in policy and\ngovernance (Ereaut and Whiting, 2008). There are currently major moves to define\nand measure well-being. The recent high-profile Commission on the Measurement of\nEconomic Performance and Social Progress was set up to explore relevant indicators\nof social progress beyond gross domestic product and includes well-being as a key\noutcome (Stiglitz et al, 2009). Developing societal measures of well-being is an analyt-\nical priority for the UK Office for National Statistics (Allin, 2007). We challenge this\npresumed need for precision in definition and measurement of well-being. First, we\nintroduce the dominant use of the concept of well-being as evident in academic studies\nand position this into Rose's (1996) theory of contemporary governance. We then\nexplore how the concept of well-being is practised discursively in local governance to\ncritically examine the presumed place of well-being as an overarching goal in local\npolicy making.\nAcademic knowledge and expertise contribute to framing and legitimating the\npractices of central concepts of governance such as well-being and there is a sub-\nstantial and growing body of work exploring the nature and definition of well-being.\nThe place and practices of well-being in local governance\nSarah Atkinson, Kerry E Joyce\nDepartment of Geography, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, England;\ne-mail: s.j.atkinson@durham.ac.uk, kerry.joyce@durham.ac.uk"
