    "abstract": "Abstract. Artists throughout the ages have discovered a number of techniques to depict trans-\nparency. With only a few exceptions, these techniques follow closely the properties of physical\ntransparency. The two best known properties are X-junctions and the luminance relations described\nby Metelli. X-junctions are seen where the contours of a transparent material cross contours of the\nsurface behind; Metelli's constraints on the luminance relations between the direct and filtered por-\ntions of the surface specify a range of luminance values that are consistent with transparency. These\nprinciples have been used by artists since the time of ancient Egypt. However, artists also discovered\nthat stimuli can be seen as transparent even when these physical constraints are not met. Ancient\nGreek artists, for example, were able to depict transparent materials in simple black-and-white line\ndrawings. Artists also learned how to represent transparency in cases where neither X-junctions nor\nMetelli's constraints could apply: for example, where no portions of the objects behind the transparent\nmaterial extend beyond it. Many painters convincingly portrayed transparency in these cases by\ndepicting the effects the transparent medium would have on material or object properties. Here,\nwe show how artists employed these and other techniques revealing their anticipation of current\nformalizations of perceived transparency, and we suggest new, as-yet-untested principles.\n",

The perception of the photograph corresponds closely to the perception of the\noriginal scene. This correspondence is not very surprising because the physical relations\nof the light coming from the scene are preserved in the photograph, at least for monocular\nviewing with no head motion (for the intricacies of picture perception see, eg, Gibson 1971;\nHecht et al 2003). However, the photograph in Figure 1b has been altered, removing the\nbreak in the brush due to the refraction of light rays by the water. Despite the violation of\nphysical laws, the perception of the scene does not change much, and the water still looks\ntransparent. Moreover, the violation would probably go unnoticed by most observers. Similar\nviolations of physics are frequently found in otherwise realistic paintings where improper\nperspective, object distortions, or impossible lighting or reflections often have little effect on\nthe perception of space and light in the scene.\nWhether violations are noticed by observers or not tells us about which violations are\nchecked by an observer's visual system and which are not. In this sense painters have\nfunctioned as early vision scientists, discovering techniques of depiction that work for the sets\nof laws the visual system actually uses and revealing rules that do not. For example, observers\nare insensitive to impossible reflections in mirrors (eg, Croucher et al 2002; Bertamini et al\nCavanagh 2005) and illumination inconsistencies (Ostrovsky et al 2005). These unnoticed\nerrors reveal the \"naive\" physics used by the visual brain to interpret scenes--a set of\nassumptions about the world that is in many cases quite different from real world physics. In\nthis paper we investigate what artists have discovered about transparency, which rules of\nFigure 1. (a) Photograph of a paintbrush in a transparent glass half filled with water. Refraction by\nthe water produces a discontinuity in the brush. (b) The photograph is altered to remove the effect of\nrefraction, but transparency is still perceived.\noptics are or are not respected, and whether artists have discovered principles of transparency\nthat scientist have yet to explore.\nA transparent material transmits light to some extent so that some of the light arriving\non one side of an object can be seen from the other side--the material is not totally opaque.\nThis property, however, is neither necessary nor sufficient for perceptual transparency\nand, of course, is not typically an option in a painting where the artist mimics the effects\nof transparency by manipulating the luminance and colors of pigments. So what are the\nnecessary features that trigger transparency percepts in the visual system, and do they exactly\nmodel the laws of physical transparency, or are there, again, some violations permitted (as\nsuggested by Figure 1)?\nWe first survey the scientific work on transparency and then the techniques of artists.\nWe find that in many paintings the basic local properties of transparency are rendered in\naccordance with transparency--that is, the adjacent luminance values are suitable to trigger\nthe perception of transparency. However, often these luminance relations are not indicative\nof the depth order of the corresponding surfaces, and hence, observers would be uncertain\nabout which surface is in front and which behind if only the local information was given.\nSuch uncertainty, however, is rarely experienced when looking at an entire painting where\nthe depth order of the different surfaces is usually clearly perceived. Interestingly, contrary to\nother scene properties like shadow and reflection which were degraded or omitted in the\nDark Ages (eg, Gombrich 1995; Casati 2004), the renditions of the luminance properties of\ntransparency seem not to vary strongly over different periods in art history, with similarly\naccurate depictions occurring in Ancient Egypt, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.\nHowever, properties of transparent materials due to refraction index or color filtering are\noften strongly violated in paintings and do not seem to be verified by the visual system. Finally,\nartists have also developed other principles of transparency based on longer-range relations\nand cognitive inference that have received little or no study in the scientific literature.\n2 Scientific studies of luminance properties of perceived transparency\nThe perception of transparency has been a topic of scientific research for almost 150\nto the study of transparency has been a set of luminance relations described by Fabio\nMetelli (1970; 1974). These are now called Metelli's Laws, referring to the luminance relations\nbetween parts of a surface viewed directly and those parts of the surface that are seen\nthrough a transparent layer. In addition to transmitting light, a transparent material may also\nreflect some light (a material that both reflects and transmits light is sometimes considered\ntranslucent; see below). Metelli's Laws yield precise quantitative descriptions of the physical\nrelations between the luminance of a surface and a transparent and reflective layer partly\ncovering the surface (see also Gerbino et al 1990). Reproducing these relations on a 2D\ndepiction reliably yields the perception of transparency (although lightness rather than\nluminance or reflectance seems to be the appropriate measure; Beck et al 1984; Metelli 1985).\nMoreover, very good predictions about perceived transparency can also be made based\non qualitative or ordinal approximations of Metelli's luminance constraints without taking\nmagnitudes into account (Adelson and Anandan 1990; see also Anderson 1997). As shown in\nFigure 2a, a transparent square appears in front of the background and in front of a darker\nsecond square with both background and dark square visible through the lighter transparent\nsquare. The regions where the back and front surfaces cross create X-junctions (one of the\ntwo X-junctions is indicated in red in Figure 2a). The luminance relations between the four\nparts making up the X-junction are closely linked to the perception of transparency and the\net al 2010; Koenderink et al 2010). In Figure 2a there is no ambiguity in regard to the depth\norder of the two squares--ie, the lighter square appears in front of the darker square. In\ncontrast, Figure 2b shows an example where again transparency is perceived, though with\nan ambiguous depth order: Either of the two light gray squares may be perceived in front of\nthe other. In Figure 2c no transparency is perceived. Instead, the shapes are seen as a light\nopaque square in front of two dark squares or two L-shapes on a uniform background. (Note\nthat in all three examples talented observers may also perceive one of the surfaces covering\nthe entire image with a hole through which the other is partially seen.)\nEach of the three categories--transparent-unambiguous, transparent-ambiguous, and\nopaque --has characteristic luminance relations across the two edges making up the X-\njunctions. These ordinal luminance relations are labeled single-, non-, or double-reversing\n(Adelson and Anandan 1990; see also Beck and Ivry 1988) and completely characterize the\nperceived transparency. Take, for example, the vertical edge of the X-junction in Figure 2a\n(marked with the red cross). In the upper as well as in the lower half the part to the left of\nthe vertical edge has higher luminance than the corresponding part to the right. In contrast,\nalong the horizontal edge the top half on the left has higher luminance than the half below,\nwhile the top half on the right has lower luminance than below. Hence, the direction of\nthe luminance difference across the border is preserved when comparing the left with the\nright half but not when comparing the upper with the lower half. Such a junction is called\na single-reversing junction (Adelson and Anandan 1990). Correspondingly, an X-junction\nwhere the direction of the luminance difference does not change along either edge is called\na non-reversing junction (Figure 2b); and an X-junction where it changes at both edges,\na double-reversing junction (Figure 2c)--the former yielding ambiguous transparency in\nregard to the depth order and the latter not yielding transparency perception.\nIn addition to these qualitative properties, the magnitude of the luminance differences\nalso plays an important role in the perception of transparency (Metelli 1970; 1974). In\nparticular, an intervening transparent layer reduces (or at least does not increase) the\nluminance differences between the surfaces behind it. This can be seen in Figure 2d where\nthe luminance difference between the black-and-white background is much larger than\nthe luminance difference between the same two background regions appearing behind the\ngray disc. In particular, the magnitude of luminance differences along a contour can reduce\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n<\n>\n>\n>\n>\n<\n<\n>\n<\n>\nFigure 2. (a) Single-reversing junction where the lower square is normally seen as transparent and\nin front of the darker square on the farther surface. The red cross indicates an X-junction. (b) Non-\nreversing junction where either square may be seen as transparent and in front of the other. (c)\nDouble-reversing junction where no transparency is seen. (d) The disc with X-junctions appears\ntransparent. (e) Shifting the halves of the disc removes the X-junctions and eliminates the perception\nof transparency. Inequality signs in panels (a) through (d) indicate the luminance relations between\nadjacent surfaces, oriented in accordance with the corresponding boundary.\nor resolve ambiguity by assigning transparency to the region with the lowest luminance\ndifferences (Anderson 1997; 2003). Magnitude constraints are especially efficient in resolving\nambiguity when the transparent region is almost opaque, strongly reducing the visible\nluminance difference compared with the difference between surfaces that are seen directly.\nNevertheless, across a broad range of luminance differences, the three qualitative ordinal\nrelationships (non-reversing, single-reversing, and double reversing junctions) are very good\npredictors for the perception of transparency and the depth order of the corresponding\nsurfaces. Because these three types of ordinal relations are very robust, we were able to\nclassify X-junctions in paintings without access to the original artwork. The effects of displays\n(photographs of originals, viewed on uncalibrated computer monitors) and measurement\nscales will shift the relative values but not their ordinal relations (see section 4 below).\nThe importance of X-junctions for transparency is well established, as can be seen, for\nexample, in Figures 2d and 2e, where removing the X-junctions by shifting the two halves\nof the circular layer eliminates the transparency percept. (However, explicit X-junctions are\nnot always necessary for the perception of transparency--eg, see Watanabe and Cavanagh\n1993). While the role of luminance properties of surfaces making up X-junctions has been\nextensively studied, there have been few studies of other properties of transparent materials\nsuch as refractive index (where errors are not readily apparent, Figure 1). The color constraints\nfor transparency have been examined (eg, D'Zmura et al 1997; Faul and Ekroll 2002; see also,\nFulvio et al 2006), as have those for superimposed textures (Watanabe and Cavanagh 1996).\nBeyond this there has been very little work. Artists, on the other hand, have been busy\nworking on transparency for more than 3,500 years. What have they discovered?\n3 Transparency in art\nTransparency was already depicted in paintings in Ancient Egypt around 1600 BC. The\nmotivation then was probably to capture the precious sheer materials, silk and cotton, worn\nby the pharaohs and members of their court. Over the centuries, a vast number of paintings\nhave portrayed transparent materials, and these works of art reveal the many principles\nrequired for the perception of transparency and those that are not. For example, following\ndan 1990) is typically sufficient to elicit the perception of transparency. In addition, artists\nhave used two high-level principles to trigger or modulate the perception of transparency:\nfirst, material constraints, and second, object constraints. We investigate how these two\nprinciples, along with luminance constraints, have been used by artists throughout the\ncenturies and how they effect the perception of transparency.\n4 Luminance constraints\nWe have seen that the luminance relations at X-junctions are predictive of the perception\nof transparency and the depth order of the corresponding surfaces. Do artists follow these\nconstraints when depicting transparency? Or can they violate the constraints and still evoke\nthe perception of transparency?\nWe used PhotoshopTM to estimate relative order of luminance across the borders of\nX-junctions in digital versions of artworks from across 3,500 years. There are, of course,\nmany factors that affect the luminance that we measured, including fading of pigments,\ninaccuracies of photography in the conversion to a digital version, and the use of the often\nsuspect \"Value\" scaling of PhotoshopTM. Nevertheless, even this long chain of distortions\nshould preserve ordinal relations, and that is all that we need to classify the luminance\nrelations. Unequal fading of pigments of different colors can affect the ordinal relations,\nand we tried to avoid artworks where this might be possible. Our analysis of the ordinal\nrelations at X-junctions shows many examples of appropriate luminance relations with very\nfew violations. The deviations lie at the margins of the categories of Figure 2 between the two\nappropriate cases--no-reversal and single- reversal--and the violation case with a double-\nreversal. Interestingly, we found no instances of the unambiguous single-reversal case of\ntransparency--perhaps artists did not feel it was necessary, even though it often occurs in\nnature.\nTake, for example, the Ancient Egyptian depiction of a number of dancers and musicians\n(Figure 3). The second character from the right wears a transparent dress. We can make out\nX-junctions, for example, between the outlines of the legs, the dress, and the background\n(see the highlighted circle in Figure 3). Unlike the examples in Figure 2, these X-junctions\nare not entirely due to luminance differences of the four corresponding quadrants, but\non one side established by depicting a contour (the outline of the dress). Measuring the\nluminance of the four quadrants verified that the luminance of the background and that of\nthose parts of the background that are covered by the dress do not differ, and therefore these\nX-junctions do not fall readily in any of the three luminance-relation categories, as they all\nrequire inequalities. However, if we take a contour as marking little or no difference, then\nat least the luminance direction does not reverse making this X-junction non-reversing so\nthat it supports transparency with an ambiguous depth order. Looking at the local detail in\nFigure 3 confirms this classification on a perceptual level: the perceived depth order of the\ncorresponding surfaces is ambiguous. However, the luminance difference between the two\nregions covered by the dress is markedly smaller than that of the parts in direct view, yielding a\nmagnitude cue for perceiving transparency and thereby reducing ambiguity. Later, we will see\nthat artists do not need to avoid the ambiguous transparency case (non-reversing junction),\nas the nature of the objects in the scene biases the perception of transparency--observers\nare much more likely to see a transparent material than a transparent body even though\neither case is consistent with the luminance relations.\noperators indicate the luminance relations between adjacent surfaces (inequality signs are oriented in\naccordance with the corresponding boundary).\nThis early depiction of transparency already mimicked physically correct transparency to\na reasonable extent. Did painters in later periods render transparency more appropriately?\nIndeed, the highly detailed paintings of the Flemish painters of the Early Renaissance (eg, Jan\nVan Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden) also displayed more realistic renderings of transparency.\nOn the other hand, if some physical violations of transparency are not picked up by the visual\nsystem, artists may not have needed to depict transparency so accurately.\nIn Figure 4, for example, we see a transparent veil covering parts of the body and face of\na woman (Portrait of a Lady by Rogier van der Weyden, 1460). We do not see a transparent\nperson in front of a veil background even though it is optically allowed. Specifically, the\nluminance directions have no reversals and so do not specify which surface is in front.\nMoreover, the luminance difference between parts covered by the veil and the difference\nbetween the directly seen surfaces is small, hardly helping to reduce ambiguity. This local\nambiguity is not reflected on a perceptual level, where it is clear that the veil is in front of the\nother surfaces.\nThese two examples do not perfectly reproduce what would be expected when following\nphysical luminance constraints for the depiction of transparency with an unambiguous\ndepth order. While there are other cues for transparency in these artworks (as discussed in\nsection 6), it might be expected that more abstract paintings with little realistic content would\nhave to rely on more accurately rendered luminance constraints when producing perceptual\ntransparency, and artists might in this case chose to depict unequivocal depth order (single-\nreversal case). In Wassily Kandinsky's Figure 5 in \"On White II\" (1923), for example, some of\nthe shapes clearly appear transparent, most prominently at the yellow-brownish trapezoid\njust below the center of the painting. While the preferred depth order of the trapezoid and\nthe large green shape may vary among observers, most observers can see either one in front\nor behind. As might be expected, ordinal luminance estimates at X-junctions revealed that\nFigure 4. Portrait of a Lady (c. 1460) by Rogier van der Weyden. Inequality signs indicate the luminance\nrelations between adjacent surfaces (oriented in accordance with the corresponding boundary).\nthe local information does not favor a particular depth order; the junctions have no reversals.\nHowever, the magnitude constraint favors seeing the green shape as transparent and lying in\nfront of the trapezoid (the smallest luminance difference is found between the green and\nbrown surfaces, ie, between the upper and left quadrant in the highlighted circle). In abstract\nartworks, there are no cues from familiar objects or layout to resolve ambiguous transparency\nand so ambiguous depth orders are more frequent here than in more figurative works.\nThe example from Egyptian art (Figure 3) with equal luminance on both sides of an\nX-junction edge shows that the luminance relations do not have to be exactly met to\nsupport transparency. However, this does not mean that artists are free from all constraints.\nWhen neither local (eg, luminance constraints) nor global (see section 6, object constraints)\nprinciples are followed, transparency is less successful. Figure 6 shows an example in which\nthe depiction of transparency failed. (As one can only speculate about the actual intentions of\nan artist, \"failed\" transparency only refers to the perception of a particular surface and not to\nwhat the artist actually wanted to display.) In Figure 6, although we can easily make out parts\nof objects that are seen directly and those that should be seen through a transparent surface\n(water), no transparent medium is perceived. Transparency failed because neither adequate\nX-junctions nor appropriate luminance and color values are depicted. Mere knowledge that\nwater should be transparent is not sufficient to trigger the corresponding percept.\nAll in all, in most of the paintings we measured, the luminance distribution at X-\njunctions did satisfy the luminance constraints for perceived transparency. However, the\nlocal information alone was not sufficient to determine which of the surfaces was in front of\nthe other. As the perception of the depth order is mostly unambiguous, especially in realistic\npaintings, it is clear that other cues must be used by the visual system to clarify the depth\norder.\nThis can be observed in Figure 7 (Greek red-figure pottery, c. 530\u00ad560), where transparency\nis perceived even though the luminance constraints do not apply. The artist successfully\nrendered transparency using only two distinct luminance values, with the body contours\nFigure 5. Some of the depicted forms appear transparent. Wassily Kandinsky's On White II (1923).\nInequality signs indicate the luminance relations between adjacent surfaces (oriented in accordance\nwith the corresponding boundary).\nFigure 6. An example of failed transparency, Mosaic of Nereis Riding Hippokampus, Imperial Roman\nperiod.\nappearing visible through a transparent dress. Note that locally only the X-junctions are\ninformative about the presence of more than one surface (the body and the transparent\ndress). However, X-junctions consisting of contours alone are not sufficient for triggering any\nkind of transparency, and this can be easily verified by isolating only a small region around\none of the X-junctions in Figure 7. Global features, as will be described in section 6, are\nessential for the perception of transparency under such highly impoverished conditions, in\nparticular, because any cues from material properties, as those discussed in the next section,\nare absent in these line drawings.\n5 Material constraints\nFigure 7. Transparency perception achieved without following luminance constraints. Greek red-figure\nCertain materials are more likely to be transparent than others. For example, most rocks\nare opaque (except some crystals), but water is often transparent. Observers could use such\nregularities to support perceptual decisions. However, transparency is not a unique feature\nof any material. In other words, the recognition of a material is not sufficient for making\ninferences about the presence or absence of transparency. Moreover, transparency may be\nan important feature for recognizing a certain material in the first place, for example, when\ndistinguishing glass from porcelain, and therefore the recognition of transparency would\nprecede the recognition of the material in this case. Could it, nevertheless, be possible that\nthe recognition of material properties other than transparency supports or counteracts the\nperception of transparency? Here, we distinguish two types of material properties related\nto physical transparency that may be depicted in works of art and potentially modulate the\nperception of transparency: reflectance properties and transmission properties.\n5.1 Reflectance properties\nTransparent materials often have characteristic surface reflectance properties like highlights\n(eg, Blake and B\u00fclthoff 1990), pearlescence, and glossiness (eg, Beck and Prazdny 1981;\nFleming et al 2003). Also transparent textiles, such as sheer curtains and lace materials,\nhave characteristic reflectance properties (anti-Lambertian reflectance function, see below).\nThese properties are shared with opaque materials but are more noticeable in transparent\nmaterials as they are the major source, and sometimes the only source, of light from the\nmaterial. In other words, the perception of these properties may be a cue for transparent\nmaterials; however, since these properties occur in both transparent and opaque materials,\nthey cannot be sufficient to depict transparency in paintings. Nevertheless, the depiction of\nthese properties often supports the perception of transparency. Here, we discuss some of\nthese properties in more detail.\nIn paintings, artists often depict at least some reflectance properties of the transparent\nsurface (eg, highlights) if they want to depict a highly transparent material and make it visible\nto the viewer. In Edward Hopper's Nighthawk (1942), for example, it is impossible to see\nwhether the front window contains glass or not (Figure 8). Only the relative opacity of the\nglass as it curves around the corner on the left physically reveals its presence (of course,\nthe restaurant probably protects its customers from the New York weather so some glass\nis expected). If Hopper had painted highlights on the window, this would have changed its\nappearance, leaving no doubt about the presence of glass in the window frame. This effect of\nhighlights can be observed in Figure 9, where the highlights are the main indicator of the\ntransparent material (Fresco, Pompeii). As in Hopper's painting, without these highlights,\nnot much of the material would be visible because of its high level of transparency.\nAlong with a number of other features, such as shadows (Casati 2004; Cavanagh 2005)\nor mirror reflections (Croucher et al 2002), highlights do not have to be accurately depicted\nto be seen as such (but see Blake and B\u00fclthoff 1990). The white areas indicating reflections\non the sphere in Figure 10 are not drawn correctly (eg, they are surrounded by lines), but\nthey still increase the perception of transparency rather than harm it. However, the main\nindicator of the presence of a transparent sphere is the visibility of its edges.\nFigure 8. It is perceptually unclear whether the front window contains glass or not. Nighthawk (1942)\nby Edward Hopper.\nFigure 9. Highlights are the main indicator for the presence of a transparent material covering the\nfruit. Roman Fresco, Pompeii.\nFigure 10. The visibility of the edge is the main indicator for the presence of a transparent sphere.\nAlthough physically incorrect, the reflections still support the perception of transparency. From The\nOne particular surface reflectance property of transparent materials, an \"anti-Lambertian\nreflectance function\" is more diagnostic than the others. Transparent materials have a greater\ninteraction with light when it strikes them at higher grazing angles as compared with straight\non (the reverse of Lambertian reflectance) because the light passes through and is absorbed\nor reflected by much more material at these grazing angles. A sheer curtain may be almost\ninvisible seen straight on, as the material blocks little light and its surface weave does not\nreflect much either. However, when the curtain is angled more steeply relative to the line\nof sight, it blocks more light from behind and it also reflects more light from the front. This\ngives the characteristic visibility of the sheer curtain in its folds more than in its flat sections.\nFigure 11 shows two paintings illustrating this property. Unlike the other material properties,\nthis one property alone may trigger the percept of transparency. In Figure 11a the transparent\nrobe completely covers the undergarment visible through it so there are no uncovered regions\nto compare with covered ones, and therefore Metelli's luminance constraints cannot apply.\nHowever, where the robe is folded, the extra material along the line of sight makes it relatively\nopaque, creating contours that make X-junctions with the contours of the undergarment,\nproviding evidence for transparency. Admittedly, it is not only the visible folds that determine\nthe transparency percept, but a second principle, object constraints--bodies are normally\nopaque--contributes as well (see, also, Figure 7 and section 6). Another example is seen in\nFigure 11b, where the woman holds an apparently transparent material with her left hand. We\nsee the material because of the visibility of its folds, and it appears transparent because the\nsurface seen within the region covered by the material is similar to that around it, suggesting\nthat we see the background through the material even though, in this case, there are no\nX-junctions, as the background has no sharp contours.\n5.2 Transmission properties\nTransparent materials have characteristic transmission properties that act on the light\narriving from behind the object including diffusion (translucency, eg, Fleming and B\u00fclthoff\n2005; Motoyoshi 2010) and refraction. In contrast to the material properties discussed\nabove, these properties have no equivalent in opaque materials. Light traveling through the\nFigure 11. Characteristic reflection patterns are often found in sheer materials, such as sheer curtains,\nwhere folds modulate how much light passes through or is reflected from the material. (a) An underskirt\ncan be seen through the sheer red robe. Hua Qing in Her Bath by Kang Tao (1723\u00ad1795). (b) The material\nthe woman holds in her hand appears transparent, although there are no X-junctions. Fresco, Pompeii.\ntransparent material undergoes diffusion (point spread function) and refraction (Figure 1).\nAs diffusion and refraction are indicative of many transparent materials, it seems reasonable\nthat artists would make use of these features and paint them when depicting transparency.\nHowever, diffusion and refraction are often depicted incorrectly or not at all, even when the\nphysical scene demands them. For example, while the scepter in Figure 12 clearly appears\ntransparent, its refraction is not accurate. As can be seen when looking through the scepter,\nthe visible contours of, for example, the hand do not show any sign of discontinuities.\nEven when put under scrutiny, this violation of physics does not reduce the perception of\ntransparency. There are countless other examples of paintings in which refraction, especially\nby water, is not depicted, and these violations are usually not noticed. This insensitivity of\nobservers to violations of refraction in paintings might be one of the reasons why artists do\nnot take great care of rendering refraction that accurately.\nFigure 12. Left panel: Central figure of Ghent Altar (1425) by Jan van Eyck. Right panel: Detail of the\ntransparent scepter.\nAlthough properties of reflectance and transmission contribute to transparency, they are\nnot required (eg, Figures 2, 3, and 7). However, when they are used, reflectance properties are\nmore accurately rendered (eg, Figures 9 and 11) than transmission properties (refraction and\ndiffusion, for example, Figure 1). This suggests that the visual system is not very sensitive to\nviolations of physical laws when depicting these transmission properties.\n6 Object constraints\nLuminance constraints and material properties are only two of the principles governing\nthe perception of transparency. We suggest that object-based principles, originating from\ngeneral knowledge about the properties of the world (\"objects of this kind often look like\nthis\") play a significant role for the perception of transparency. Importantly, transparency\nperception resulting from inferences based on world knowledge does not occur very often\nwithout any other principles being at least partly satisfied (but see Figure 7). An example\nillustrating this principle is shown in Figure 13 (Portrait of an Artist, (Pool with Two Figures) by\nDavid Hockney). The diver appears completely covered by water, that is, no parts belonging\nto the same object are seen directly as well as through the transparent material. Hence,\nthere are no corresponding X-junctions (the light caustics cross the body but do not carry\ntransparency information). However, as \"divers usually look like this when under water\", it\nseems a good inference to make despite the lack of X-junctions and the unrealistic depiction\nof properties of the water.\nFigure 13. Object-based inference: It looks like a person diving in a swimming pool. He must be seen\nthrough transparent water. Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) (1972) by David Hockney.\nObject-based inferences are a very strong principle for the perception of transparency;\nhowever, they are largely neglected in the scientific investigation of transparency. Artists, to\nthe contrary, rely strongly on object-based inferences for depicting transparency in paintings,\nespecially when other principles are not sufficient to trigger a transparency percept. In\nmost of the examples here object-based inferences apply and support the perception of\ntransparency. Usually, objects are perceived in front of or behind other objects and not just\nin front or behind decontextualized patches of differing luminance. Moreover, object-based\ninferences also yield very strong cues for the depth order of the comprised objects and\nsurfaces.\nIn the Ancient Egyptian painting in Figure 3, for example, local information alone does\nnot yield an unambiguous transparency percept. Recognizing the involved parts as belonging\nto the dress, the person, and the background, however, resolves the ambiguous transparency\npercept in favor of an unambiguous depth order: Contours surrounding a human body in the\ndepicted fashion are usually not accidental contours of the environment but rather belong\nto clothes covering the body. As luminance constraints are only partly satisfied and material\nproperties are not apparent, object-based inferences must play a major role in the perception\nof transparency in this painting. Object-based inferences play an even more important role\nin the Roman Fresco depicted in Figure 14. The bowl is perceived as transparent, and some\nof the fruit are seen through the bowl, although neither luminance constraints nor material\nproperties (essentially some highlights) contribute significantly to the effect. The blurred\nedges of the fruit seen through the glass give an additional cue for transparency. However,\nthis cue is not sufficient, as can be observed by covering the pieces of fruit that are seen\ndirectly on top of the bowl. This strongly reduces or even abolishes the transparency percept\nand lets the fruit seem like a property of the bowl painted on its surface. These examples of\nAncient Egyptian and Roman art show that transparency can be depicted by including only\nsome of the essential principles, one of them being object-based inferences.\nBut even when only the principle of object-based inference is satisfied, and the other\nprinciples do not apply, transparency may be perceived. In Figure 7 (Greek red-figure\npottery), for example, neither the luminance principle applies nor are any material properties\ndepicted. Nevertheless, contours of a body are clearly seen through a transparent dress. The\nobject-based inference that bodies behind clothes \"often look like this\" dominates possible\nalternative ways of seeing the figure. Hence, the perception of transparency may still be\nachieved without the aforementioned principles as long as other cues, here the contours of\nthe dress and the body, help to segment the scene into different parts and give rise to object-\nbased inferences. However, object knowledge can be overruled by other transparency cues\nwhen they strongly indicate conditions that contradict the effective object-based inference.\nIn Figure 15, for example, the man is perceived as transparent contradicting knowledge of\nthe opacity of human bodies (Teatro alla Scala by Liu Bolin). Color and texture cues as well\nas another object-based inference--namely that the red object seen at the position of the\nman among all the regularly arranged red seats must also be a seat--yield the perception of a\nbackground surface seen through a transparent body.\nFigure 14. Object-based inferences are key for perceiving the bowl as transparent. Fresco in the Villa\ndi Poppea in Oplontis (c. 70 AD).\nMost of the paintings discussed here have in common that object-based inferences\nsupport the perception of transparency. But what counts as an object? Is a certain level\nof realism necessary? A closer look at abstract art gives an opportunity to address this\nquestion. In the painting \"On White II\" (Figure 5), Wassily Kandinsky conveyed depth\nrelations, figure boundaries, surface properties, occlusions, and transparency, all the while\nevoking uncertainty about which parts of the depicted shapes belonged together. This piece\nFigure 15. Object knowledge can be overruled by other cues. Here, color, texture, and the object-based\ninference that the red object at the position of the man must be a seat like all the others overrules\nknowledge of the opaqueness of human bodies. Teatro alla Scala (2010) by Liu Bolin.\nsuggests that object-based inferences can also work on a very low level of abstract shapes\nwhere jumbled contours and forms are organized into, more or less stable, meaningful\nwholes.\nExamples,\nsee Figure\nReferences\nRatio\n- magnitude\ndifferences\nreduced luminance difference along a\ncontour supports transparency\n- non-reversing\ntransparency with ambiguous depth\norder\n- single-reversing\ntransparency with unambiguous depth\norder\n- double-reversing no transparency 2C\n- lines only\nusually no transparency (Fig. 6), but\ntransparency through object\nknowledge possible (Fig. 7)\n- isoluminant colors\ntransparency when color constraints\nare met\n- highlights can enhance transparency 9 & 10\n- anti-Lambertian\nRF\ncan trigger transparency (e.g., sheer\ncurtains)\n- translucency can enhance transparency\n- refraction\nunimportant for transparency (e.g.,\nviolated in Fig. 12)\nObject-\nbased\n- world knowledge can trigger and enhance transparency\nall\nTransmission Reflectance\nWithout X-junctions\nOrdinal luminance\ndifferences\nNo luminance\ndifferences\nWith X-junctions\nTable 1. Perceptual effects of transparency cues.\n7 Conclusion\nLuminance, material properties, and object properties are all essential aspects of our\nvisual world that have fascinated artists and scientists for many centuries and motivated\ncountless studies on canvas as well as in the laboratory. Here, we investigated how artists used\nthese properties to portray transparency in paintings. In addition to the classic luminance\nconstraints at X-junctions outlined by Metelli, we found that artists make wide use of two\nother principles--material properties and object-based inferences--that elicit and modulate\ntransparency perception and that have not as yet been a frequent subject of scientific\nstudies. Table 1 shows an overview of the principles and cues that govern the perception of\ntransparency in paintings and the real world, and the perceptual effects of the different cues.\nAll of these effects have been included in paintings long before they were studied by\nvision scientists. They are in an important sense discoveries of artists as they explore the\nability of pigments to mimic material properties like transparency. The possible exception\nthat have emerged first in the laboratory are the single reversing X-junctions, surprisingly\nabsent from paintings, though often present in natural transparency, and the transparency\neffects of equiluminous X-junctions, which being physically highly improbable, are virtually\nnever present in natural scenes. Moreover, we saw from artists' work that many transparency\ncues can be violated as long as a few are present. This gives us a rich source of data to explore\nthe transparency algorithms that must be in place in the visual system.\n"
