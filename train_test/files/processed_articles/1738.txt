Subsequently, we used hierarchical\nlinear modeling to examine the influence of organi-\nzational factors on DCW job satisfaction after\ncontrolling for significant individual-level DCW vari-\nables. Results: Components of the model explained\n51% of the variance in DCW job satisfaction. Back-\nground characteristics of DCWs were less important\nthan personal stressors (e.g., depression), job-related\nstressors (e.g., continuing education), and social\nsupport (e.g., interactions with others) in predicting\njob satisfaction.

These workers in the long-term care\n(LTC) industry help physically and cognitively\nimpaired individuals with tasks such as bathing,\ndressing, toileting, and feeding, thus making them the\nfoundation of the LTC workforce. However, turnover\ncosts the industry nearly $4.1 billion annually (Harris-\nKojetin, Lipson, Fielding, Kiefer, & Stone, 2004).\nTurnover among DCWs stems from a variety of\nfactors, key among which is job dissatisfaction\n(Capitman, Leutz, Bishop, & Casler, 2004; Castle,\nDegenholtz, & Rosen, 2006; Institute of Medicine,\n2001; National Commission on Nursing Workforce\nfor Long Term Care, 2005; Nursing workforce:\nRecruitment, 2001; Parsons, Simmons, Penn, &\nDCW turnover, gaining a better understanding of the\nfactors affecting job satisfaction is critical in order to\ndevelop and implement workplace interventions to\nenhance job satisfaction. Prior research studies on\nthe determinants of job satisfaction among DCWs\nare sparse. Furthermore, they are limited by the\ngeneral absence of a conceptual framework to guide\nthe research or one that is narrow in scope, a failure\nto consider both DCW-level and organizational-level\nfactors to simultaneously address the issue of nested\ndata, and the lack of inclusion of DCWs from\ndifferent types of LTC settings (Castle et al., 2006).\nWe designed this study to address these limitations.\nSupported by the Better Jobs Better Care initiative that was funded\nby the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Atlantic Philanthro-\npies and managed by the Institute for the Future of Aging Services,\nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. We would\nlike to thank Kathleen Fox, project coordinator; Dorothy Schur and Julie\nRentsch, research analysts; the participating sites and their liaisons; the\ninterviewers; and the direct care worker respondents.\nAddress correspondence to Farida K.

Furthermore, we\nused hierarchical linear modeling to identify organi-\nzational effects on the study outcome while control-\nling for data obtained at the individual level from\nConceptual Model\nThe study's conceptual framework was adapted\nfrom the stress process model, which examines the\ncommon sources of stress and its negative impact on\nfamily caregivers with impaired older relatives living\nin home- and community-based settings (Aneshensel,\nPearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995;\nPearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990; Zarit &\nWhitlatch, 1992). The sources of stress and support\nin that model were later adapted for use with DCWs\nin nursing homes (Cohen-Mansfield & Noelker, 2000;\nNoelker, Ejaz, Menne, & Jones, 2006) and then\nDCWs in assisted living facilities and home health\nagencies (Ejaz & Noelker, 2006). This adapted\nLTC stress and support model was developed based\non the similarities in caregiving tasks by family\nmembers and DCWs. Both provide the majority of\nhands-on care for elders either in the community or\nin LTC settings and perform tasks that involve\nintensive physical and emotional labor (Noelker,\n2001; Whitlatch, Schur, Noelker, Ejaz, & Looman,\n2001). An important adaptation of the LTC stress\nand support model is the inclusion of organizational\nvariables because, unlike family caregivers, DCWs\nare employed by organizations with differing char-\nacteristics and practices.\nWe did not use other conceptual models in the\nstudy because of their limitations. One study used\na conceptual framework organized around staff\ndemographic characteristics, job characteristics,\nand work environments to predict employee job\nsatisfaction, job commitment, and turnover intent in\na single type of LTC setting (Karsh, Booske, &\nSainfort, 2005). Another study on factors distinguish-\ning nursing home facilities with high and low DCW\nturnover used job, organizational, and environmen-\ntal factors at the organizational level but did not\ninclude any individual-level DCW characteristics\n(Brannon, Zinn, Mor, & Davis, 2002). Thus, the\nproposed research responded to the need for a more\ninclusive conceptual framework to empirically test\nhow individual-level DCW characteristics and stress-\nors as well as organizational characteristics and\nmanagement issues influence job satisfaction.\nElements of the Conceptual Model\nAt the DCW level, variables in the model (see\nFigure 1) include the background characteristics of\nthe DCWs (A), their personal and job-related sources\nof stress (B), and workplace support (C). At the\norganizational level (D), the model includes charac-\nteristics of the organizations (e.g., type of LTC\nsetting) and management issues (e.g., high DCW\nturnover). The various sources of stress and support\nat both the DCW and organizational levels influence\nthe study outcome (E), that is, DCW job satisfaction.\nDCW Individual-Level Predictors of\nJob Satisfaction\nBackground Characteristics.--Research on the\nstress process has indicated that background and\ncontextual features have an important bearing on\noutcomes (Aneshensel et al., 1995). A large portion\nof the DCW workforce is composed of low-income,\nunmarried minority women with dependent children\n(Yamada, 2002). Consequently, we included age,\nrace, and marital status in the model.\nPersonal Stressors.--Because DCWs are the\nlowest paid workers in the health care labor force,\nfinancial and family worries are likely to be personal\nsources of stress that can carry over to the work setting\n(Stone & Weiner, 2001; Tellis-Nayak & Tellis-\nNayak, 1989). In addition, because the care DCWs\ngive to the frail elderly is physically and emotionally\ndemanding, over time it is likely to negatively affect\ntheir physical and emotional health (Mutaner et al.,\nJob-Related Stressors.--Stressors on the job in-\nclude job design features such as the frequency of\nscheduling changes (e.g., coming in early, staying\nlate, being called to work on a day off) and lack of\npermanent assignments. Scheduling changes are\nlikely to disrupt the practice of permanent assign-\nment to residents or clients and are indicative of\nshort staffing and turnover problems, which in turn\nimpact overall job satisfaction. Another important\ncomponent of job-related stress is inadequate on-the-\njob training. Such training includes orientation to\nthe job, peer mentoring, and continuing education.\nOther job-related stressors investigated here are poor\npay and lack of benefits such as health insurance (U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2003,\nSupport in the Workplace.--Research has pro-\nvided evidence that positive support can attenuate\nthe negative effects of stress (Bass, Noelker, &\nRechlin, 1996), whereas negative support can exac-\nerbate stress (Krause, 1995). For example, DCWs\noften hear racist and ethnic remarks made about\nthem by clients, families, and other staff (Berdes &\nTellis-Nayak, 1989). Using the LTC stress and\nsupport model, we investigated the effects of DCW\nperceptions of workplace racism and other negative\nand positive interactions on job satisfaction.\nOrganizational-Level Predictors of DCW\nJob Satisfaction\nAt the organizational level, a key background\ncharacteristic is type of LTC setting. Examining\ndifferences by type of LTC setting is important\nbecause settings can significantly differ in their\nstructure and operation (Ejaz et al., 2006). For\nexample, DCWs in nursing homes work in a more\ninstitutional setting compared to home care aides,\nwho provide care in a client's home. Research has also\nshown that staffing patterns and working conditions\nin for-profit facilities place greater demands on\nnursing staff (Anderson, Issel, & McDaniel, 1997).\nOther organizational features have the potential to\ninfluence worker outcomes, including the availability\nof resources that are affected by reimbursement\nstreams (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, and private pay).\nA study by Mor, Zinn, Angelelli, Teno, and Miller\n(2004) indicated that organizations serving primarily\nMedicaid and minority residents have fewer resources\n(e.g., lower reimbursement rates under public pro-\ngrams), which can negatively impact staffing levels,\nrate of pay, amount of staff training, and availability\nof equipment and supplies. Another key organiza-\ntional characteristic is the difficulty an organization\nfaces because of high DCW turnover rates (Harris-\nKojetin et al., 2004). Based on these prior studies, the\nLTC stress and support model also included the\nfollowing organizational-level predictors: the percent-\nage of minority and nonminority clients served; the\npercentage of reimbursement under Medicare, Med-\nicaid, and private pay; and the difficulty the organi-\nzation reports with DCWs quitting or being fired.\nMethods\nResearch Questions\nThe research addressed the following questions:\n1. To what extent do DCW reports of personal and\njob-related stress and workplace support predict\ntheir job satisfaction?\nFigure 1. Long-term care (LTC) stress and support model predicting direct care worker (DCW) job satisfaction. Additional\nmeasures of components in the model can be found in the Measures section.\n62 The Gerontologist\n2. To what extent do organizational characteristics\nand management issues predict DCW job satis-\nfaction, after controlling for DCW individual-\nlevel variables?\nSite Selection\nWe developed a database of all nursing homes,\nassisted living facilities, and home health agencies in\na five-county area of northeast Ohio by obtaining\ninformation from various sources (e.g., the state's\nDepartment of Health, the local area agency on\naging, and the state's assisted living association). The\ncomprehensive list included 75 home health agencies,\nfor a total of 319 agencies. Because the list of LTC\nfacilities was obtained from state agencies, it excluded\norganizations that were not certified or licensed (e.g.,\nprivate home health agencies). Following the crea-\ntion of a database of the 319 facilities, we contacted\nthese organizations to determine if they met the\ncriteria for inclusion in the study: (a) facilities with\nmore than 10 DCWs and (b) facilities that employed\ntheir own DCWs and did not use only agency staff\nor outside contractors. Of the 319 agencies in the\nstudy area, we were able to obtain information from\n217 (68%). Based on the information supplied by the\nagencies, 40 assisted living facilities, and 92 nursing\nhomes) met the study criteria.\nWe determined that, in order to effectively address\nResearch Question 2, we would need a minimum of\n30 organizations to investigate the effects of\norganizational-level variables while controlling for\nDCW-level variables (Kraemer & Thiemann, 1988).\nWe used proportionate random sampling techniques\n(Cochran, 1977) to select a larger number of sites\nthan the minimum number required. This sampling\nstrategy allowed us to randomly select 8 home care\nagencies, 13 assisted living facilities, and 25 nursing\nhomes, for a total of 46 sites.\nIn view of the project's restricted time frame for\nsite and sample recruitment and data collection, we\nassumed a 100% refusal rate to ensure that the\nreplacement pool contained enough sites. Thus, we\ncontacted a total of 90 sites (see Table 1), and 41%\nof those refused to participate. Refusals included\nactive and passive refusals, the latter referring to\ncases in which facility administrators agreed to\nparticipate but did not follow up with the research\nteam. Refusal rates differed by type of LTC setting.\nAlmost half (49%) of the nursing homes contacted\nwere refusals, whereas only one third (33%) of home\ncare agencies were. In the end, 46 facilities partici-\npated in the study. Ultimately, we added three\nadditional sites to boost the overall number of\nDCWs in the sample (see ``Respondent Selection'').\nComparisons between participating and nonpartici-\npating sites revealed that sites did not differ on key\nvariables such as type of LTC setting, number of\nclients/residents served, or the number of DCWs that\nthey employed.\nRespondent Selection\nWe determined that, in order to have adequate\npower of .80 or greater, with an effect size of .05 and\napproximately 21 predictors in the model, we would\nneed a minimum sample size of 615 DCWs to\naddress Research Question 1 (Murphy & Myors,\n1998). We used proportionate random sampling tech-\nniques to recruit the required number of DCWs from\nthe respective sites.\nBecause of the limited time frame for data collec-\ntion and in anticipation of a high DCW refusal rate,\nOf these, 39% refused to participate. We completed\na total of 644 interviews, which was more than the\nminimum number of DCWs required to address\nResearch Question 1. Challenges encountered in\ncontacting and interviewing DCWs included discon-\nnected and wrong phone numbers and DCWs'\nfailure to keep interview appointments, despite the\nfact that interviewers were willing to conduct\ninterviews at odd hours and in any place and time\nconvenient to the DCW.\nData Collection Procedures.--We collected two\ntypes of data: (a) DCW-level data based on either\nin-person or telephone interviews with workers and\nTable 1. Response Rates\nHome Health Agencies Assisted Living Facilities Nursing Homes Total\nSite\nRespondent\n(b) organizational-level data based on a mailed\nsurvey completed by the site liaison (usually a human\nresources director or the administrator). In cases\nwhere the organizational survey was incomplete,\nwe contacted site liaisons to complete parts of the\ninstrument over the phone. All 49 organizations in\nthe study completed the survey.\nConsent Procedures.--Prior to starting the in-\nterview, we obtained informed consent from DCWs.\nThe institutional review board of the research\norganization approved the consent procedures. The\naverage amount of time taken to complete an\nMeasures\nOutcome Variable.--Job satisfaction was an\noverall measure of satisfaction with various aspects\nof a DCW job. The scale was originally developed\nfor use with DCWs in nursing homes (Kiefer et al.,\n2005). Items are scored using a 4-point Likert scale,\nwith higher scores indicating higher job satisfaction\nlevels. We assessed the psychometrics of the scale in\ntwo steps. First, we dropped 2 of the original 18\nitems because of insufficient variance in responses\n(i.e., the criterion for exclusion was having less than\n80%\u00ad20% response variance on an item). Second,\nwe entered the remaining 16 items into a factor\nanalysis using principal axis factoring and Varimax\nrotation. It revealed a one-factor solution. Thus, we\nthe scale (Cronbach's a=.94). (See the Appendix for\nthe scale items.)\nDCW Background Characteristics.--We used\nsingle-item measures for the three DCW background\ncharacteristics: age, race/ethnicity (nonminority = 0;\nminority = 1), and marital status (unmarried = 0;\nmarried = 1). We considered including the number\nof months that the DCW had worked at the facility;\nhowever, we excluded it from the analyses because\nof its high correlation with the outcome variable.\nDCW Personal Stressors.--We used five mea-\nsures to assess DCW personal stressors. One\nmeasure of perceived financial adequacy included\nsix items covering whether the DCW had sufficient\nmoney to meet regular and unexpected obligations\n(Cronbach's a = .81). The second measure is an\nadditive index of four items assessing worries about\nfamily while at work (Cronbach's a = .75). The\nhealth-related personal stressors included the Center\nfor Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression scale (CES-D;\nRadloff, 1977) and two single-item measures of\nperceived change in emotional health and physical\nhealth since becoming a DCW, scored as much\nworse (0), worse (1), about the same (2), better (3),\nor much better (4).\nDCW Job-Related Stressors.--We examined\nthree components of job-related stress: (a) job design\nfeatures, (b) training issues, and (c) pay and benefits.\nJob design features included a measure of scheduling\nchanges (how often in the past 2 months the DCW\nhad been asked to come in early, stay late, or work\non a scheduled day off) and a measure of the\nfrequency with which the DCW was permanently\nassigned to clients. Three single-item measures on\ntraining assessed perceived adequacy of job orienta-\ntion to the facility, perceived adequacy of continuing\neducation at the facility, and usefulness of having\na mentor at the time of hire. With respect to pay and\nbenefits, we included a one-item measure of being\nfairly compensated for the job along with four single-\nitem measures of whether the organization provided\nthe DCW with sick leave, paid holidays, a retirement\nor pension plan, and paid health insurance.\nDCW Job-Related Support.--We included three\nmeasures of job-related support in the analysis. We\nasked DCWs whether or not certain positive and\nnegative reactions were elicited when the DCW\ninteracted with other DCWs and with residents.\nPositive items focused on feelings of respect, affec-\ntion, and reassurance, whereas negative items queried\nabout feelings of anger, frustration, and guilt. How-\never, we did not use positive items in the analysis\nbecause of a lack of variance. We created one additive\nindex of total negative interactions on the job\n(regardless of with whom the negative interactions\noccurred) based on how many negative interactions\nwere reported. In addition, DCWs reported the\nfrequency of hearing racial or ethnic remarks made\nby residents or other staff members. We also used\nthese two items on the frequency of racial or ethnic\nremarks by residents or other staff as independent\nmeasures of negative support.\nOrganizational Variables\nBackground Characteristics.--We created several\ndescriptive organizational variables for use in the\nanalyses. The variables included type of LTC setting\n(assisted living/home health agency = 0; nursing\nhome = 1); profit status (not for profit = 0; for\nprofit = 1); percentage of minority residents/clients\nserved; and percentage of resident/client services\nreimbursed through (a) Medicaid, (b) Medicare, or\n(c) private pay.\nOrganizational Issues.--Based on the literature,\nwe included selected measures of organizational\nissues. For example, the organizational survey\nincluded information on the extent to which the\norganization faced difficulties with turnover (4-point\n64 The Gerontologist\nscale ranging from no difficulty to a great deal of\ndifficulty) because of DCWs quitting or being fired,\nand the minimum starting hourly rate of pay for\nData Analyses\nData analysis required several phases. In the first\nphase, we used a correlation matrix of all DCW\nindependent variables in the model and the de-\npendent variable to check for multicollinearity.\nAlthough an intercorrelation of .80 or higher is an\nexample of a cutoff value at which to begin\nexcluding predictors as being too similar (Stevens,\nbeing considered, we used a more conservative cutoff\nof .50 for deciding to keep or exclude variables. The\ncorrelation of the outcome with the predictors\nretained in the analyses are included in Table 2.\nIn the second phase, we analyzed Research\nQuestion 1 by using a hierarchical multiple linear\nregression to determine the extent to which DCW\nreports of personal stressors, job-related stressors,\nand workplace support predicted DCW job satisfac-\ntion. We entered DCW predictor variables in four\nsteps based on components of the LTC stress and\nsupport model: (a) background characteristics, (b)\npersonal stressors, (c) job-related stressors, and (d)\njob-related support variables.\nIn the third phase, we addressed Research\nQuestion 2. In this phase, we used a two-level\nhierarchical linear model (HLM) to determine the\nextent to which organizational factors could predict\nDCW job satisfaction after we controlled for the\neffects of individual-level DCW predictors. We\nconsidered HLM the most appropriate statistical\ntechnique to use because study data were nested, in\nthat a number of DCWs from each study site\nparticipated in the interviews.\nWe entered the significant predictor variables that\nwe had identified earlier (Research Question 1) in\nLevel 1 (individual- or DCW-level data) of the HLM\nanalyses. In Level 2 (organizational-level data), we\nentered key organizational characteristics and man-\nagement issues in the HLM analyses. We selected\norganizational variables based on their importance\nin the literature and used an iterative process to\nselect only those that emerged as consistently signifi-\ncant. Due to the relatively small number of organ-\nizations (49), we entered no more than four\norganizational characteristics and management issues\n(using a ratio of 1 variable to 10 cases/organizations)\nat any one time in Level 2 of the HLM analyses.\nResults\nBackground and Context\nTable 3 shows the DCW-level variables, scoring,\nranges, means, and standard deviations. Approxi-\nmately 6 out of 10 DCWs were minority, slightly\nmore than one third were married, and the average\nage was 39 years. Eighty percent of all DCWs were\nstate-test nursing assistants, indicating that even\nsome home care aides and resident assistants had\ncompleted nurse assistant training. The majority of\nDCWs worked full time (77%), and the remaining\n23% reported their work status as part time or ``as\nneeded.'' At the time of the interview, the mean\nlength of time that DCWs had been with their\nmonths), or almost 5 years.\nWorries about family while at work and partic-\nularly financial problems were widely reported by\nthe DCWs. The average score for perceived job-\nrelated emotional health change since becoming\na DCW was higher (2.26) than the mean score for\nphysical health changes (1.98). Conversely, DCWs\nhad relatively high CES-D scores: 26% scored at\n16 or above, which is indicative of clinical levels of\ndepressive symptoms.\nOn average, DCWs had been asked to make\nchanges to their work schedule five times within the\nTable 2.

Also, DCWs\ntended to perceive their job orientation and continu-\ning education as fairly useful. Almost 75% of DCWs\nreceived paid holidays off, but only 49% received\nfully paid health insurance. On average, a DCW\nexperienced one or two negative interactions with\nother staff or residents out of a possible three\nnegative interactions. DCWs reported hearing racial/\nethnic remarks more frequently from residents than\nfrom other staff.\nRegarding organizational characteristics, Table 4\nincludes descriptive data on the three types of facili-\nties. There was good representation of for-profit and\nnonprofit organizations (28 and 21, respectively).\nThe organizations served, on average, 21% minority\nclients, although they ranged from serving no\nminority clients/residents to more than 90% minor-\nity clients/residents. Reimbursement sources also\nvaried, with the average organization receiving about\n40% of its reimbursement from Medicaid.\nDCW Individual-Level Predictors of\nJob Satisfaction\nWe entered 21 predictors in the hierarchical\nmultiple linear regression (Research Question 1).\nThe final model identified 12 significant predictors\nof DCW job satisfaction with an adjusted R2 of .51\n(p , .001). We examined the tolerance and variance\ninflation factor (VIF) that focus on multicollinearity\namong the predictors and found that they were\nwithin acceptable limits (see Table 5). Background\ncharacteristics of DCWs were entered first and,\nalthough significant, they contributed little to the\nfinal outcome. The largest changes occurred with\nthe inclusion of personal stressors (R2 change = .25,\np .001), the job-related stressors ( R2 change =\nhierarchical regression analysis resulted in significant\nchanges in the R2 value.\nFor the final model, in terms of background\ncharacteristics that were entered first, only race of\nthe DCW predicted DCW job satisfaction, with\nnonminorities reporting higher levels of job satisfac-\ntion. Among the personal stressors that were entered\nnext, three variables were significant predictors of\nDCW job satisfaction: physical health change since\nbecoming a DCW, emotional health change, and\nCES-D score. DCWs who reported better physical\nand emotional health since working as a DCW and\nthose who had lower depression scores were more\nlikely to have higher job satisfaction.\nTable 3.

Specifically, DCWs who perceived they had\nbetter on-the-job training in terms of the usefulness\nof continuing education and job orientation had\nhigher job satisfaction. In terms of pay and benefits,\nDCWs who reported being fairly compensated for\ntheir job, having a retirement/pension plan, and\nhaving paid health insurance had higher job\nsatisfaction.\nWith respect to workplace support variables that\nwere entered last, racism and negative interactions\nwere significant predictors of DCW job satisfaction.\nWhen DCWs reported hearing fewer racial or ethnic\nremarks from other staff and experienced fewer\nnegative interactions at work, their job satisfaction\nwas higher.\nOrganizational-Level Variables\nWe included significant DCW-level predictors that\nwe identified in Phase 1 in Level 1 of the two-level\nHLM model. The y-intercept (b0j\n) estimated from\nthe Level 1 model represents the adjusted average job\nsatisfaction scores of the jth LTC facility. Because\nthe Level 1 predictors were group mean centered, the\nadjusted average represented the job satisfaction\nscore for a typical DCW in a specific facility. We\ntreated this index of job satisfaction as the outcome\nvariable in Level 2 of the HLM analysis.\nIn Level 1 of the HLM analyses, all of the\nindividual-level predictors identified in the multiple\nregression, except for race of DCW, emerged as\nsignificant predictors of the adjusted average job\nsatisfaction level in a facility. With respect to\norganizational factors identified in Level 2 of the\nHLM analyses, the following were significant: type\nof LTC facility (i.e., nursing home vs home health\nagency and assisted living facility), difficulty with\nturnover of DCWs, and minimum hourly rate of pay\nfor DCWs (see Table 6). Nursing homes had lower\nadjusted average job satisfaction scores compared to\nhome health agencies and assisted living facilities.\nGreater difficulty with DCWs quitting or being fired\nhad a negative relationship, whereas higher rates of\nstarting wages had a positive relationship with the\nLTC facility's adjusted average DCW job satisfac-\ntion score. The percentage of minority clients served\nwas not a significant predictor of the adjusted\naverage DCW job satisfaction score.\nDiscussion\nTheLTCstress andsupport model,testedwithdata\nfrom both DCWs and organizations, proved to be\na useful tool to explain DCW job satisfaction. Specific\ncomponents of the model had more explanatory\npower than others. For example, Step 1 of the multiple\nregression analysis identified only one background\ncharacteristic (i.e., nonminority race) as a significant\npredictor of DCW job satisfaction. However, because\nrace was not significant in the HLM analyses when we\nentered the organizational-level variables, it suggests\nthat race and other DCW background characteristics\nwere not as important in predicting job satisfaction as\nwere other variables. In fact, the most powerful\npredictors of DCW-level job dissatisfaction were the\npersonal and job-related stressors.\nAmong the personal stressors, physical and\nemotional health changes since working as a DCW\nand depression were significant. From a practice\nperspective, LTC organizations need to be sensitive\nto perceived changes in the health of DCWs.\nOffering workplace health screening, employee\nassistance, and health promotion programs may be\nefficacious in addressing DCWs' personal stress in\norder to enhance their job satisfaction.\nIn addition to personal stressors, a variety of job-\nrelated stressors were significant predictors of job\ndissatisfaction. They fell into the following catego-\nries: issues related to scheduling changes, training,\nand pay and benefits. Organizations can alleviate\nsome job-related stress by offering better job\norientation and continuing education programs. In\nfact, DCW-related findings from our study indicate\nthat DCWs want better training in specific content\nareas and in the methods for providing training\nAlthough LTC organizations are not always\namenable to offering better pay and benefits, it is\nclear that feeling fairly compensated for the job and\nTable 4.

Of all of the benefits included\nin our study, two were significant: health insurance\nand a retirement/pension plan. Other benefits such\nas paid holidays and paid sick leave did not emerge\nas significant. Because studies have suggested that\njob satisfaction is related to turnover (Castle et al.,\n2006), further research needs to be conducted\nexamining the business case for offering better wages\nand benefits in relation to the cost of turnover.\nIn addition to addressing sources of job-related\nstress, organizations can also focus on improving\ncommunication patterns and relationships in the\nworkplace. Our findings suggest that perceptions of\nracism by other staff and negative interactions with\nstaff and residents are likely to generate greater job\ndissatisfaction. With respect to racism, our findings\nsupport those of other studies in that DCWs were\nmore likely to condone racist remarks from residents\nand clients because they believed that the elders were\ntoo impaired to be maliciously racist (Berdes &\nEckert, 2001). Hence, racism from staff was a signif-\nicant predictor of job satisfaction but racism from\nresidents was not, even though 70% of the DCWs in\nour sample had heard residents and clients make\nracist remarks. Thus, having sensitivity training on\nracial and cultural differences; promoting effective\ncommunication between residents, families, and staff\nvia newsletters, brochures, and discussion groups;\nand having a no-tolerance policy on discrimination\nare likely to enhance workplace support.\nIn terms of differences between organizations, it is\ninteresting to find that nursing homes had lower\nTable 5.

Both tolerance levels and VIF examine whether there is a strong\nlinear relationship between a predictor and the remaining predictors in a model. They do not examine the relationship of the\npredictors with the outcome variable. Tolerance is the reciprocal of VIF (i.e., tolerance = 1 / VIF). VIF values that exceed 10 may\nbe a cause for concern with regard to multicollinearity (Stevens, 2002, p. 92). The rule of thumb with respect to tolerance is to\nTable 6.

Additionally,\norganizations providing a higher minimum starting\nrate of pay for DCWs and those not struggling with\nturnover issues were more likely to have higher levels\nof DCW job satisfaction. In a low-income population\nof working women, the issue of pay is likely to be\nlinked to the alarming rates of DCW turnover in the\nindustry (Harris-Kojetin et al., 2004; U.S. Department\nThe limitations of this study include the follow-\ning: (a) the inclusion of sites from a restricted\ngeographical area (five-county area in Ohio), (b) the\ninability to obtain a random sample of DCWs due to\nthe challenges involved in contacting and completing\ninterviews with DCWs who volunteered to partici-\npate, and (c) the lack of longitudinal data to examine\ncause and effect between variables in the model.\nThus, the findings from this study need to be viewed\nwith caution, particularly those regarding the differ-\nences between nursing homes and other LTC\norganizations. We could not conduct a more in-\ndepth examination of the differences between the\nthree types of LTC settings in our sample because\nthere were fewer home health agencies and assisted\nliving facilities than nursing homes due to the\nproportionate sampling techniques used in the study.\nTo examine the effect of organizational variables\nwhile controlling for DCW individual-level factors\nby type of LTC setting, HLM would require\na minimum of 30 organizations for each of the three\ntypes of settings. Thus, future studies using larger\nsamples of organizations are required to effectively\naddress differences by type of setting.\nSimilarly, although DCWs in Ohio are likely to\nhave characteristics similar to other samples of\nDCWs in terms of gender and income level, the\nstudy questions and the conceptual model need to be\ntested with larger, more generalizable samples.\nOne of the major strengths of the study lies in the\nuse of a conceptual model that supported using two\nlevels of data (i.e., DCW and organizational levels)\nto predict job satisfaction. Other strengths include\nthe preliminary examination of three types of LTC\nsettings and the large sample of 644 DCWs who\ncompleted in-depth interviews. Future research with\nlarger, more representative samples and a longitudi-\nnal design can lead to further refinements in the LTC\nstress and support model for examining the relation-\nship between job satisfaction and actual turnover\namong DCWs.\nReferences\nAnderson, R.
