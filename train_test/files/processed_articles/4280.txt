Histologically, acute pancreatitis (AP) con-\nsists of neutrophilic inflammation associated with inter-\nstitial oedema and necrosis of mesenteric fat. In the cat,\nthere is often some overlap between the acute and\nchronic forms of feline pancreatitis.1,2 In 115 cats pre-\nsented for necropsy, irrespective of the cause of death,1\nan overall prevalence of 67% of pancreatic changes was\nidentified (45% in clinically normal animals). CP was\nfound in 60% of the pancreases (50% CP only), with a\nsignificant correlation between age and occurrence of\nCP. AP was present in 16% (6% AP only).\nDiagnosing feline pancreatitis ante-mortem remains\na challenge for the clinician.2,4 This difficulty has multi-\nple origins, which include the undefined aetiology,\noften mild and non-specific clinical signs,1,5 poor sensi-\ntivity and specificity of most of the imaging or clinico-\npathological findings,6,7 frequent concomitant disorders\nand difficulty in obtaining or interpreting biopsy sam-\nples.2 In addition, sensitive and specific tests for the\ndiagnosis of feline pancreatitis were, until recently, not\navailable. Serum amylase and serum lipase activities\nhave been evaluated in both experimental and sponta-\nneous feline pancreatitis showing non-specific increases\nassociated with liver,8,9 renal or other gastrointestinal\ndiseases. Results of clinical studies suggest that these\ntwo traditional tests, which are not specific for pancreas,\nare of no clinical value in cats and should not be used\nfor the diagnosis of feline pancreatitis.3,6 However, mod-\nerate-to-good sensitivity and specificity of lipase has\nbeen reported for the diagnosis of feline pancreatitis\nusing the 1,2-o-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-(6'-\nmethylresorufin) ester (or DGGR-lipase) assay.10\nFeline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI) is a\nspecies-specific immunoassay that became available\nsome years ago.11 In contrast to the traditional catalytic\nassays for serum lipase activity, which indiscriminately\nmeasure the activity of lipases of any origin (eg, pancre-\natic, gastric, duodenal), fPLI specifically measures pan-\ncreatic lipase and thus it is specific for pancreatic disease.\nStudies in cats with spontaneous and experimental pan-\ncreatitis have shown that fPLI is very sensitive for mod-\nerate to severe pancreatitis,12,13 being superior to the\nsensitivities of feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity\n(fTLI) and abdominal ultrasound. IDEXX provides two\ndifferent tests to measure fPLI. Spec fPL is a quantitative\ntest performed in reference laboratories. Based on the\nsame concept, SNAP fPL is a semi-quantitative rapid in-\nhouse test available for practitioners and reveals a `nor-\nmal' (3.5 g/l) or `abnormal' (>3.5 \u00b5g/l) test result.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the rapid in-\nhouse test SNAP fPL with the standard test Spec fPL and\nto evaluate the use of the SNAP fPL to diagnose pancrea-\ntitis in an emergency setting.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nAll cats with a clinical suspicion of pancreatitis admitted to\ntheVeterinary Teaching HospitaloftheUniversity ofLeipzig\nprospective study protocol included signalment (sex, breed\nand age) as well as body weight at time of presentation, his-\ntory and physical examination, blood work, abdominal\nultrasound, SNAP fPL and Spec fPL, and follow-up.\nHistory and physical examination\nInvestigated clinical signs included diarrhoea, vomiting,\nreduced appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain, dehydra-\ntion, jaundice, fever or hypothermia and weight loss.\nFurthermore, historic or present co-occurring diseases\nwere evaluated.\nBlood work\nBlood samples were taken for all patients mostly at pres-\nentation, but always within 24 h. We would like to note\nthat data presentation and discussion is limited to cats\nwith diagnosed pancreatitis. A complete blood count\n(CBC) with differential was performed. The analysis\nincluded haematocrit, number of leukocytes, neutro-\nphilic granulocytes (with potential left shift), eosino-\nphilic granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and\nthrombocytes. The measurements were performed on\nthe following machines: ProCyte (IDEXX Vet Med\nLabor), pocH-100 iv Diff (Sysmex) or Vet abc (Scil), and\nwere manually checked in most cases.\nThe chemistry profile included the following param-\neters: total protein and albumin, glucose, urea, creati-\nnine, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT),\naspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin and electro-\nlytes (Na, K, Ca, P).

The following parameters were considered\nindicative for pancreatitis: enlargement of the pancreas,\nperipancreatic fluid accumulation, heterogenicity with\nincreased (fibrosis) or decreased (necrosis) echogenicity\nand increased echogenicity in the surrounding mesen-\ntery (adiponecrosis).\nRetrospective classification\nDepending on their history, physical examination, clini-\ncal signs, blood work, abdominal ultrasound and follow-\nup, the cats were retrospectively assigned to four different\ngroups with regard to the probability of having pancrea-\ntitis, as described previously.14 Group I included cats\nwith negative SNAP and Spec fPL results and no evi-\ndence for pancreatitis otherwise (eg, in abdominal ultra-\nsound). Group II included cats with clinical signs similar\nto pancreatitis, but suspicion was not confirmed by SNAP\nand/or Spec fPL, abdominal ultrasound and/or follow-\nup. Group III included cats with clinical signs fitting to\npancreatitis and confirmed by SNAP fPL and/or Spec\nfPL, abdominal ultrasound and/or follow-up (minimum\nthree points indicating pancreatitis). Group IV included\ncats with conflicting results, where diagnosis was unclear\n(eg, pancreatitis possible owing to clinical signs and/or\nultrasound, but SNAP and Spec fPL negative).\nStatistical analysis\nAgreement of SNAP fPL and Spec fPL was calculated\nwith Cohen's kappa ().\nResults\nAnimals\nA total of 111 cats with an initial suspicion of pancreatitis\nwere entered in the study.

Therefore, they were\nassigned to group IV with an unclear diagnosis. Owing\nto this, they were excluded from the study.\nDiscussion\nFeline pancreatitis is a common disorder with a rather\nnon-specific clinical, haematological and biochemical\nmanifestation. Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred\nimaging method to diagnose pancreatitis,3,11 although its\nsensitivity has been reported to be low in the range of\nNeither the traditional serum amylase/serum lipase\nsis of feline pancreatitis.

SNAP\nfPL and Spec fPL yielded discordant results in only\nwith Spec fPL when results were 3.5 g/l (97.5%) or\n5.4 g/l (90.0%). These findings correspond approxi-\nmately to statements of the IDEXX Vet Med Labor (92%\nSNAP fPL. Where Spec fPL was increased (3.6\u00ad5.3 g/l)\nand consequently pancreatitis was possible (but not\nabnormal. Feasible reasons are that SNAP fPL shows a\ndeficiency when measuring a slight increase or that the\ncolour change is subjectively misjudged. However, not\nevery cat with an increased Spec fPL concentration (3.6\u00ad\n5.3 g/l) had a strong suspicion of pancreatitis. With\nregard to the cases with a strong suspicion of pancreatitis\n(group III), only one cat (4.8%) had a false-negative\nSNAP fPL result (Spec fPL was 6.0 g/l). An abnormal\nwith pancreatitis. Therefore, although the Spec fPL\nresults in the range of 3.6\u00ad5.3 g/l cannot be used as a\nreliable indicator for pancreatitis, SNAP fPL meets the\ndemand for a reliable and easily performable in-house\ntest. SNAP fPLI revealed an abnormal test result in 100%\nof the cases with a Spec fPL 7.9 g/l. Furthermore, in\nthis study a single SNAP fPL Test was considered nor-\nmal with a Spec fP above the cut-off of 5.4 \u00b5g/l (7.4 \u00b5g/l).\nThis highlights the advantage of SNAP fPL in severe\ncases with high Spec fPL.\nFor the four cases with positive abdominal ultra-\nsound but double-negative SNAP fPL and Spec fPL\nresults (group IV), we were unable to determine whether\nboth fPLI tests were false negative or the ultrasound\nfalse positive without histological analysis. Reasons for\nthe mismatch of the commercial tests and ultrasono-\ngraphic statements can be an indisposition of the pan-\ncreas not involving an increase of fPLI (eg, neoplasia,\nhyperplastic nodules, oedema).3,13 Furthermore, a\ntrauma such as high-rise syndrome can cause ultrasono-\ngraphic alterations, which persist longer than an increase\nof the fPLI level.20 Additionally, other gastrointestinal\ndiseases can develop ultrasonographic evidence consist-\nent with pancreatitis.3,13 Moreover, ultrasonographic\naberrances can be a consequence of CP (eg, atrophy,\nfibrosis) without acute inflammation and release of fPLI\nat the time of taking blood samples. These deviations\nsupport the argument that the sensitivity of fPLI is lower\nfor CP.3 But even if these cats are considered false nega-\nsensitivity, which is higher than any other single test pub-\nlished to date.\nAccording to the manufacturer, the SNAP fPL is\ndesigned to rule out pancreatitis. In our study, 83/86\ncats (96.5%) allocated to groups I and II (no pancreatitis)\nin group II, Spec fPL results between 3.6 and 5.3 g/l\nwere recorded. According to the manufacturer, a slightly\nincreased Spec fPL simply indicates that pancreatitis is\npossible.21 Another potential explanation is that other\ndiseases cause clinical signs and a co-occurring mild\npancreatitis leading to a misclassification into group II.\nAdditionally, cats might have a naturally occurring\nTable 2 Clinical signs of 21 cats with a suspicion of\npancreatitis (group III)\nClinical signs Percentage (%)\n6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\ninter-individual variability of their normal fPLI concen-\ntration above the reference interval. However, there is\nstill the possibility of false-negative SNAP fPL results.\nFor the 86 cats within groups I and II (no pancreatitis),\nSNAP fPL was only false positive in three cats (3.5%).\nTwo of these results were negative in Spec fPL\n(3.5 g/l), whereas pancreatitis in one of these cats\ncould not be excluded by Spec fPL.\nThis cat (Spec fPL: 4.7 g/l; SNAP: abnormal) suffered\nfrom hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension,\nwhich was treated successfully. Subsequently, SNAP fPL\nand Spec fPL tests were repeated, later yielding normal\nresults. The cat with an abnormal Spec fpL (7.4 g/l;\nSNAP fPL normal) was euthanased at the owner's\nrequest. It was considered a false positive because nec-\nropsy revealed a normal pancreas but a perforated gut.\nTable 3 Changes in blood work and blood chemistry of 21 cats with a suspicion of pancreatitis (group III)\nRI Mean \u00b1 SD  Within RI (%) \nThe last three columns display the ratio of patients with decreased, normal and elevated parameters, with the respective range in absolute\nvalues displayed in brackets for the decreased and increased columns\nSchnau\u00df et al 7\nIf practitioners receive an unexpected SNAP fPL\nresult, it is recommended that this measurement is con-\nfirmed with Spec fPL and preferably backed up with\nabdominal ultrasound evaluation. This approach is sup-\nported by the data from group II, where three abnormal\nSNAP fPL test results were corrected by Spec fPL, as well\nas in group III, where the only SNAP-normal cat was\nproven to have a pancreatitis with a Spec fPL value 5.4\n\u00b5g/l. In emergency situations it is recommended that\ncats are treated symptomatically with infusion, antiemet-\nics and analgesics, etc, until the diagnosis is clear and the\ntreatment can be specifically adapted.\nThe major shortcoming of our study is that the diag-\nnosis of pancreatitis was almost exclusively based on\nnon-invasive methods and expert opinion.15 Histological\nbiopsies \u00ad the gold standard to diagnose pancreatitis \u00ad\nare needed to evaluate these tests with a higher cer-\ntainty, but would require extensive clinical studies and\nowners willing to take biopsies in an already diseased\nanimal. This is, at least in our environment, very diffi-\ncult to get.\nAs known from other studies, it is impossible to diag-\nnose feline pancreatitis on the basis of clinical signs, CBC\nand blood chemistry without any further investiga-\ntions,6,7,10 as they are very unspecific. The percentages of\nunspecific lethargy (95.2%) and reduced appetite and\nvomiting (90.5% each) are even higher than results from\nanother study.11 Furthermore, dehydration was seen reg-\nularly (81.0%) compared with other studies (eg, 92% and\nclinical signs, which has been shown in previous stud-\ncats \u00ad a value that is higher than in older studies but\nsimilar to newer ones.6,10,11 Nevertheless, cats either con-\nceal their pain or pancreatitis is less painful for cats than\nfor dogs and humans. Additionally, the detection of\nabdominal pain is not only subjective, but also variable\nowing to different veterinarians on emergency duty see-\ning the cats.\nSimilar to other surveys, predispositions concerning\nbreedandbodyweightwerenotperceived.1,6Additionally,\nthe average age of group III (9.4 years) was slightly higher\nthan in group II (7.7 years), which is compatible with\nolder animals that suffer more often from pancreatitis.20 A\nhigher ratio of males was noticed in the group of cats with\npancreatitis (81%); however, the proportion of males was\nhigher in the whole study population (64.7%).\nThe most common haematological changes associated\nwith pancreatitis were leucocytosis (61.9%) and lymphope-\nnia (57.1%). An increased incidence of hyperglycaemia and\nhyperbilirubinaemia (85.7% each) and an increase in hepatic\nenzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) were conspicu-\nous, as in previous studies.6,11 Only 19% of the cats had an\nincreased creatinine; therefore, it is unlikely that kidney dis-\nease had an influence on serum lipase level. Electrolyte\nimbalances (hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia, 57.1%\neach) were most likely induced by vomiting and anorexia.\nHowever, various instruments with various reference inter-\nvals were applied owing to cases coming in as emergencies\nor during day shifts. However, these parameters proved to\nbe rather unspecific to diagnose pancreatitis.\nConclusions\nAs there is no ante-mortem gold standard to diagnose\nfeline pancreatitis, a combination of history, clinical\nsigns, measurement of pancreatic lipase immunoreactiv-\nity and ultrasonography is the most reliable non-invasive\nprocedure to diagnose feline pancreatitis. Clinical signs,\nas well as routine blood-work changes, were non-spe-\ncific and thus proved to be insufficient to diagnose pan-\ncreatitis. SNAP fPL and Spec fPL have a good agreement,\nespecially when Spec fPL is 3.5 or 5.4 g/l. The com-\nbination of SNAP fPL and subsequent Spec fPL, if indi-\ncated, provided the opportunity to rule out or to diagnose\npancreatitis with a higher certainty than previously\nknown test methods. This study proved SNAP fPL to be\na reliable tool to exclude or include pancreatitis in an\nemergency setting in-house.\n"
