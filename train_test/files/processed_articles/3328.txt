Urban and regional\nplanning (\"planning\" in short) education plays a fundamen-\ntal role in training and forming planning practitioners to be\nable to tackle such problem. In the globalizing and rapidly\nchanging world, transcultural engagement has demonstrated\nits potentialities for planning education and practice to\nbecome more attentive to the diversity and change manage-\nment (Abramson, 2005). Along with this, the need to interna-\ntionalize planning education has been widely recognized by\nvarious associations such as the North American Association\nof Collegiate Schools of Planning, Association of European\nSchoolsofPlanning,AustralianandNewZealandAssociation\nof Planning Schools, and Planning Institute of Australia\nReid and Loxton (2004) stressed that from the student per-\nspective, internationalization can mean the experience of vis-\niting a different country, learning about contrasting ways of\nliving and thinking, and perhaps integrating these experiences\ninto their own value systems. This seems to reflect closely on\nthe wider strategies of many universities, which seek to pre-\npare students to live and work in a global and multicultural\nsociety, with cultural and environmental sensitivity, under-\nstanding, and communicative competencies (Reid & Loxton,\n2004). An international field trip can be defined as an educa-\ntional trip to an international destination for observing and/or\ntaking (non)experimental research relevant to the study/proj-\nect of involved students. In this perspective, these trips repre-\nsent a widely regarded and useful delivery mechanism for\nsuch enriching educational experience and competencies,\nwhere students can learn via firsthand experiences (Fuller,\nEdmonson, France, Higgitt, & Ratinen, 2006; Houser,\nBrannstrom, Quiring, & Lemmons, 2011). This makes the\ninternational field trip approach one of the \"optimal\" models\nfor positive learning outcomes as long as it is linked with the\nproject started in the classroom and continued after the return\nThis article aims to explore the role of international field\ntrips in cultivating the pedagogy of student experience in\nthe planning practice in the light of the literature and orga-\nnized field trip exercises.

These field trips took place as part of the regional\nplanning practice course of Queensland University of\nTechnology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia, where some of the\n4th-year undergraduate planning students attended.\nThe article is structured in five parts. Following this intro-\nduction, the section \"Internationalization of Education,\nInternational Field Trips, and Student Performance\" presents\nthe summary of the review of the literature on international-\nization of higher education, international field trips, and stu-\ndent performance, and highlights the benefits of expanding\nthe planning curriculum to incorporate international ele-\nments such as field trips. \"Evaluating the Learning Outcomes\nof International Field Trips\" section reports the purpose and\ntechnical details of the course and four international field\ntrips organized jointly by QUT and hosting universities of\n\"Method, Analysis, and Results\" discusses the field trip out-\ncomes in the light of information collected through student\ninterviews, surveys, and assignment performances along\nwith discussions with their professors. The last section con-\ncludes by highlighting the opportunities and constraints of\nexposure of students to regional planning practice beyond\nthe national (Australian) context.\nInternationalization of Education,\nInternational Field Trips,\nand Student Performance\nGlobalization and the ascendancy of the knowledge- and\nservice-based marketplace have had a profound impact on the\neconomic, sociocultural, political, and environmental con-\ntexts, and consequently resulted in a trend toward growing\nreflexivity within the higher education system (Yigitcanlar,\nglobalization requires interaction with different regions and\nvarious cultures and this is leading universities to redefine the\ndirection of their courses and the graduate attributes to be\npursued. Economic and cultural pressures associated with\nglobalization have created a concern for a workforce that is\nglobally aware and employable in cross-cultural settings . . . In\norder to remain competitive, universities feel the need to\ninternationalize their course content. (p. 1)\nAccording to Coates and Edwards (2009), graduates need\nto be conscious of increasing diversity in their social and\norganizational surroundings. They also need to obtain the\nskills and knowledge that will allow them to be better pre-\npared for local and global citizenship. J. Knight and de Wit\n(1997) defined internationalization of higher education as a\n\"proactive\" response to globalization. Writing from a North\nAmerican perspective,Ali and Doan (2006) referred to recent\nefforts to internationalize planning education to provide stu-\ndents with a fundamental multicultural understanding. They\nindicated that this emerging trend has led many universities\nto develop internationalization strategies, as part of an effort\nto recruit a greater proportion of international students and\nstaff. However, these approaches to internationalizing higher\neducation have been criticized by some who argue that such\na shift involves more than just marketing the university to\nattract foreign students and staff (Wende, 2001). According\nto J. Knight (2003), internationalizing the university system\nrequires \"integrating an international, intercultural or global\ndimension into the purpose, functions or delivery of post-\nsecondary education\" (p. 2), and therefore, recommends\nincreasing foreign research collaborations, establishing\ninternational didactic partnerships, and expanding the cur-\nriculum to incorporate international elements. While support\nfor the internationalization of the university curriculum has\nincreased significantly in recent years, the internationaliza-\ntion of higher education is arguably still in its infancy (Back,\nDavis, & Olsen, 1996). This, hence, invites a greater collab-\norative effort from academic communities.\nInternationalization, originating from within the planning\nacademy itself, is an expanding movement toward further\ndeveloping international research partnerships, enhancing the\ninternational perspectives of university programs, and even\nincorporating specialized international planning subjects into\nthe syllabus. The scholarly assumption appears to be that\ninternationalizing the planning curriculum provides an oppor-\ntunity to introduce diversity, multiculturalism, and cultural\ndifferentiation into education; processes that theorists such as\nFriedmann (1996) lamented to be understudied in planning.\nOther scholars, such as Goldstein, Bollens, Feser, and Silver\n(2006), contend that the internationalization of planning edu-\ncation strengthens the foundations of cross-cultural sensitiv-\nity in students, which not only ensures they are prepared to\nmeet the expectations of a diverse marketplace but also equips\nstudents with the skills of diversity management required by\nmodern organizations. Correspondingly, Alterman's (1992)\nempirical critique of planning practice and education imply\nthat failure to incorporate an international perspective into the\nuniversity program limits students understanding of the con-\ntexts in which planning practice and education occur cross-\nnationally, and he recommended educating students about\nother countries to enhance their appreciation of planning\nprocesses.\nIt is evident in the literature that students who receive an\ninternationally focused higher education are more responsive\nto global market forces, have enhanced social and cultural\nawareness, and are better prepared to cope with the ramifica-\ntions of significant political change (e.g., Coates & Edwards,\nnational immersion can expand horizons for students, aca-\ndemic researchers, and the broader university institution;\nachieved through facilitating cooperative working relation-\nships across partner universities and generating high-quality\nYigitcanlar 3\nresearch products that can be used to inform professional\npractice as well as contribute to the advancement of the\nexisting body of applied knowledge (P. Knight & Yorke,\nGoldstein et al., 2006) argue that international immersion\nprovides students with more marketable skills in the work-\nplace, in particular, the ability to apply cross-cultural knowl-\nedge, and highlight the value of international field trips in\nexpanding traditional pedagogy and practice to an interna-\ntional setting and understanding. Similarly, Afshar (2001)\nsupported the view that international pedagogical experi-\nences provide the participants with an opportunity to acquire\nknowledge through action across a broad range of institu-\ntional and cultural contexts; and is invaluable to the develop-\nment of a reflective planning practitioner.\nAbramson (2005) underlined the usefulness of a series of\nintense field trips integrated with a continuous relationship\nof academic exchange and ongoing research to engage stu-\ndents and academics from both countries as a means for dis-\ncovering the differences in planning culture that exist across\nnations. He predicts that in the foreseeable future, the effec-\ntiveness of planning professionals would largely depend on\nthe ability of their work to transcend international boundar-\nies, and stated \"as greater numbers of planning consultancies\npractice across national borders, the local embeddedness of\nactual planning conditions presents a major problem for the\ntraining of planning professionals\" (p. 101). On this point,\nTaylor and Finley (2011) highlighted the value addition of\ninternational field trips not only by enhancing teaching and\nlearning capabilities, developing research partnerships, and\nwidening organizational resources; but also by equipping\nstudents with the skills and knowledge to function profes-\nsionally across diverse cultures.\nSimilarly, Ali and Doan (2006) identified international\nfield trips to be one of the most innovative methods of\nenhancing student understanding of planning processes and\ncomplexities of diverse cultural, economic, and political\nsystems. They emphasized that this type of pedagogical\nexperience constitutes an effective application of integrating\nan international perspective into the curriculum, as it creates\ninternational research partnerships for the development of\nintercultural skills and understanding of global processes,\nrather than just marketing university's programs and stu-\ndents internationally.\nInternational field trips are widely claimed and regarded\nas an important part of the higher education experience that\nstudents have a firsthand, hands-on, and problem-based real-\nworld learning experience in a different setting from their\nown country (Hefferan, Heywood, & Ritter, 2002; Hovorka\nTo scientifically prove these claims, Houser et al. (2011)\nundertook an objective analysis of student comprehension\nand retention of course material through a comparison of test\nperformance between students who participated in an inter-\nnational field trip and their peers who did not. The findings\nof this study revealed that international field trips improve\ncognitive learning. They stated,\nthe key finding of this study is that fieldtrip students [received]\nsignificantly higher exam scores, as compared to their peers not\ninvolved in the study abroad fieldtrip . . . Fieldtrips have\nsignificant social and affective outcomes that contribute toward\nimproved learning outcomes and test performance. (p. 526)\nAccording to Dee, Tsui, Lee, and Yigitcanlar (2011),\nthe importance of international planning education in facilitating\na deeper understanding of cultural diversity and exposing\nstudents to new ways of thinking cannot be underestimated. In\nan era of globalization and wireless technology, international\ncollaborative planning projects can equip graduates with the\nskills necessary for professional practice in a national or\ninternational context. (p. 72)\nIn summary, while there are various means that are\nemployed by universities to internationalize their course con-\ntent, an increasingly popular means of internationalizing the\ncontent of education is the incorporation of field trips into the\ncurriculum. International field trips, thus, have the potential\nto play a significant role in helping universities to respond to\nthe demands of globalization and rapidly changing economic,\nsociocultural, political, and environmental conditions.\nDepending on how well they are organized, field trips can be\nacademically thorough and can create a cultural experience\nuseful in the globalizing world, and the exposure provides an\nopportunity for students to develop their intercultural compe-\ntence. As Khan (2009) stated, this is a valuable attribute for\nplanning professionals, making them job ready for an expand-\ning and increasingly international job market.\nEvaluating the Learning Outcomes of\nInternational Field Trips\nRegional planning practice course of the urban and regional\nplanning undergraduate program at QUT offers 4th-year\nplanning students an opportunity to develop their knowl-\nedge and skills for effective strategic planning and coordi-\nnation of a positive metropolitan regional change in an\ninternational context. Since 2008, each year, this course has\nbeen choosing a metropolitan region from abroad as a case\nstudy for students to (a) demonstrate an understanding and\ncapability to apply planning theories and principles, (b) review\nplanning methods critically, (c) create effective strategic\ndevelopment frameworks, and (d) integrate and apply the\npractice material taught. Although organizing an interna-\ntional field trip is not a requirement of the Planning Institute\nof Australia--professional course accreditation body in\nAustralia--this course includes an international field trip of\nabout 2 weeks to the metropolitan region under investiga-\ntion to improve student competency in addressing intercul-\ntural planning and development issues.\n4 SAGE Open\nThese international planning exercises were specifically\ndesigned to enhance teaching and learning capacities,\ndevelop teaching partnerships, and provide students with\nskills and competencies to function professionally in a mul-\nticultural context. As part of this course, between 2008 and\n2011, four international field trips were organized to Kuala\nLumpur (Malaysia), Daejeon (Korea), Gallipoli (Turkey),\nand Taipei (Taiwan) from Brisbane (Australia). As recom-\nmended by Edwards (2009), these international field trips\nwere planned as \"the optimal model\" for positive learning\noutcomes by being linked with the project started in the\nclassroom and continued after the return from the trip.\nFrom each year's regional planning practice class, where\nbased on first-come-first-served method, have been chosen\nto participate in the international field trips (for the enroll-\nment numbers, see Table 5). During the first three deliveries\nticipants' project focused on the international metropolitan\nregion they visited, a local project from the local metropoli-\ntan region (Brisbane) has been assigned to the rest of the\nclass as their study region. At the last delivery of the course\n(2011), the entire class took the same international metro-\npolitan region (Taipei) as the case study area.\nPlanning and preparation of field trip activities com-\nmenced about a year before the trip and continued in strong\ncollaboration with hosting universities. Several funding\nresources from QUT were channeled for these trips to\nbecome as affordable as possible for the participating stu-\ndents. In all four field trips, while students covered the cost\nof their own air travel, their accommodation, meals, travel\ninsurance, and field trip\u00adrelated technical expenses were\ncovered by QUT, and the hosting universities covered the\nlocal transportation, local seminar, and forum speakers'\nexpenses and venue hiring costs.\nThe field trip destinations were carefully selected consid-\nering the following key criteria: (a) study area providing a\nunique real-world planning problem that would help students\nto enrich their comprehension of planning issues beyond\nAustralia; (b) data and information availability of the case\nstudy region in English; (c) good ties with the hosting institu-\ntions, which secures the local delivery and quality of lec-\ntures, workshops, site visits, and surveys; (d) participation of\nlocal university professors and students in the activities; and\n(e) affordability of the field trip for students. Table 1 lists the\ndetails of the international field trips and participants.\nThese field trips were collaborative exercises organized\njointly by visiting (QUT) and hosting universities and\nscheduled for the first 2 weeks of the semester--at the last\nweek of July and first week of August every year between\ntotal 94 QUT students) worked with hosting university stu-\ndents (in total 78), under the supervision of professors (in\ntotal 15 from QUT, 16 from hosting universities) in collect-\ning the relevant information for preparing regional devel-\nopment plan proposals in the following 12 weeks after the\nfield trip. Regional planning practice course, in terms of\noutputs, consisted of a regional appraisal (field trip report),\nregional activity analysis report (expanded version of field\ntrip report including review of the relevant literature), and\nregional development plan proposal (plan and accompany-\ning report detailing vision, objectives, key development\nstrategies, and actions). During the field trips, students of\nvisiting and hosting universities worked in groups under\nthe supervision of their professors to prepare the first out-\nput of the course (i.e., field trip report) and participated in\nthe activities listed in Table 2.\nAfter the field trips, hosting university planning students\nkept in touch and supported QUT students with additional\ninformation and local knowledge. The regional planning\nTable 1.

However, due to time and\nfinancial constraints, attendance of the hosting university\nstudent and staff for the final event of the project in Brisbane\ncould not be materialized.\nThe following section reports the evaluation method,\nanalysis, and results of the learning outcomes from the four\ninternational field trip experiences, including assignment\nperformance differences between the student groups who\nparticipated and who did not participate in the international\nfield trips.\nMethod, Analysis, and Results\nFocus group discussions, interviews, and surveys are among\nthe commonly applied qualitative and quantitative methods\nin evaluating teaching and learning outcomes (e.g., Houser\nopportunities and constraints of exposure of students to\ninternational planning practice, the research methodology\nincludes semistructured interviews with student focus\ngroups and structured field trip evaluation surveys with stu-\ndents. These interviews and surveys (on top of QUT's stan-\ndard teaching and learning surveys) were conducted at the\nend of the semester (n = 24 and n = 77, respectively). The\npurpose of waiting about 3 months after each field trip was\nto get a much clearer and settled view from the students on\nwhat level the international collaboration improved their\nskills and competencies, and contributed to their profes-\nsional and personal development. In addition to the focus\ngroup interview and survey techniques, a validity check was\nconducted by involving professors, who attended these\ninternational field trips, through informal discussions on the\nresults of student interviews and surveys (n = 11). Finally, a\nperformance analysis has been undertaken to measure and\nshed light on the achievements of international field trip\nparticipants in three of the assessment items in comparison\nwith their peers who had not participated in international\nfield trips.\nStudent Focus Group Interviews\nThe first analysis of the research was conducting inter-\nviews with selected student participants of international\nfield trips. Semistructured interviews were undertaken for\neach field trip during the last week of the semester with\nrandomly selected six QUT students, forming a focus\ngroup, to reflect the outcomes of international field trip\nexperiences (n = 24).\nFrom these conversations, we found out that almost all\ninterviewed students view the international activity as an\nextremely positive contribution to their professional and per-\nsonal development. Interviewee S19 (Student Number 19)\nput forward,\n[field trip] was an amazing journey in my university education,\nit made me open my eyes to the issues beyond Australia . . . This\nis a perfect experience for engaging us with an overseas real-\nworld practice, while motivating and triggering our curiosity.\nTable 2.

Interviewee S13\nstated, \"I gained new insights, perspectives and technical\nskills from this international project, as we worked on an\ninternational real-world problem-based project . . . This proj-\nect broadened my vision and helped me to see the big\npicture.\"\nSome interviewees highlighted the contributions of the\ninternational social interaction on their technical abilities.\nInterviewee S10 stated,\nalthough the field trip was an innovative way of teaching and\nequipping us with technical experience, the most important\naspects of it were to provide us an opportunity of working in\ninternational teams, and increasing professional self-confidence\nlevels and developing cross-cultural social skills.\nBeyond this, especially networking and building new\nfriendships dimensions of the field trips were frequently\nvoiced as a positive method of encouraging student learning\nwhile having a good time and making new friends.\nThe comments of Interviewee S23 on his personal obser-\nvations and suggestions reflect most of the students' com-\nmon view on this international collaboration. As he said,\nthe overall field trip was an invaluable experience, I have\npersonally learned a lot from the joint work with my peers [in\nthe visited country]. The trip provided me with an insight into\ninternational planning issues, cultural complexities, and the\nimportance of governance within the planning framework. I\nwould recommend the trip to all planning students. This type\nof field trips and experiences broaden our perspectives and\ncreate a thirst for learning more about other countries' way of\nplanning.\nFinally, the use of new technology and techniques during\nthe project was also mentioned along with interviewees see-\ning themselves getting equipped with international knowl-\nedge in the discipline area, which may lead to overseas\nemployment opportunities.\nOn the downside, there were some concerns that were con-\nsidered as constructive comments for the future field trips.\nThere was a repeated comment on the length of the trip to be\nextended further as the field trip was found not having enough\ncontact time with local professionals to provide students with\nan opportunity to engage with a wide range of discussion and\nin-depth analysis. According to Interviewee S18,\nvisiting the local planning departments and learning about\nlocal planning practice within another country provides a new\nplatform from which I can now look at planning theories and\npractice in my area, and challenge the accepted norms.\nHowever, it would have been great to spend more time with\nthese experts to get a much more detail information on the case\nstudy area.\nAnother point was on the cultural and language differ-\nences not helping to follow and join discussions and com-\nmunicate with local people and local activist group\nrepresentatives. According to Interviewee S5, \"the level\nof detail we were able to obtain and evaluate didn't always\nflow down to local policies due to issues such as language\ndifferences.\" Interviewee S7 agrees on this view and adds\non, \"the workshop and lecture contents were very good,\nbut sometimes the language barrier was a problem for us\nto fully follow the lecture and join the discussion after-\nwards.\" Interviewee S2 said, \"the activities were good;\nhowever they were too focused on the government per-\nspective and needed more focus on community groups and\nactivists, and urban problems that need to be resolved\nimmediately.\"\nThe next key issue was related to the organization of the\nplanning practice and policy development collaboration\nthat provides enough time for students to get to know about\neach others' culture and planning systems. On that matter,\nInterviewee S12 stated, \"[we] probably need a session to\nexplain both universities' education in terms of planning\nand discussing planning processes in both countries in\nmore detail.\" On the very same subject, Interviewee S20\nunderlined the need for a denser collaboration by saying,\n\"more closeness required learning from each other. Thus,\nthis will break the cultural barriers between two university\nstudents . . . Perhaps home-stay during the field trip might\nbe useful.\"\nDifficulty of arranging regular weekly contact time with\nhosting university students to complete the project following\nthe field trip was raised as a concern. Interviewee S19\nmentioned,\ncooperating with [local] students was very helpful for us . . .\n[Case study area] is extremely sensitive region not only\nhistorically but also environmentally and an outside view on the\ndevelopment and protection strategies would make a great\ncontribution. Nevertheless, following this unique and different\nplanning experience it was quite challenging to keep regular\nonline meetings via emails, instant messengers or Skype to\nfurther develop the project.\nFinally, beyond aforementioned issues, logistic limita-\ntions (particularly in Western standards), field trips being\nphysically demanding for some, limited interpersonal skills\nof hosting university students (most likely due to cultural\ncharacteristics or shyness), involving rather a one-way\nknowledge transfer (concerning of hosting university stu-\ndents), and limited funding for students were mentioned as\nother key constraints of these field trips.\nThe following summary, listed in Table 3, was captured\nissues concerning opportunities and constraints of the field\ntrip experiences.\nYigitcanlar 7\nStudent Evaluation Surveys\nThe second analysis was conducting structured surveys with\nstudent participants of international field trips. Survey ques-\ntionnaires, consisting of 31 questions with five Likert-type\nscale response options, were sent to QUT students by email.\nGallipoli, and Taipei field trips, respectively. The 4-year\n4-year results of the student surveys, undertaken between\nPerfectly aligned with what McLean, Hurd, and Rogers\n(2007) put forward, Kuala Lumpur, Daejeon, Gallipoli, and\nTaipei field trips have been perceived as quite attractive,\nbecause students, particularly the \"Y generations,\" saw them\nas opportunities to combine leisure activity (e.g., traveling,\nseeing new places, and expanding social networks) with edu-\ncation (e.g., study away from university and home). The\nhighlights of these results are illustrated in Figure 1, and the\nmain issues from the conducted surveys between 2008 and\nIn terms of overall findings of the field trips, in total, 28%\nof respondents had \"strong agreement\" on the benefits of\nplanning field trips, whereas other 56% had \"agreement\"\n(total 84% satisfaction rate). The students almost had a con-\nsensus on (above 90% satisfaction rate) the following points:\n(Q1) Field trip was a valuable experience for my profes-\nsional growth and development;\n(Q2) Field trip was a valuable experience for my personal\ngrowth and development;\n(Q4) I highly recommend this field trip to other students\nand universities;\n(Q7) Field trip provided me an understanding of alterna-\ntive sets of planning objectives and processes;\n(Q18) Field trip enhanced my understanding of diversity\nin my social and organizational surroundings;\n(Q19) Field trip improved my ability to communicate in a\nmulticultural or foreign environment;\n(Q20) Field trip improved my ability to communicate\nwith people from different countries or cultures;\n(Q21) Field trip helped me build networks and cooperative\nwork with students and faculty from my university;\n(Q24) Field trip was valuable to my understanding of\ninternational planning issues;\n(Q27) Students contributed positively to the overall qual-\nity of the experience, and;\n(Q28) Professors contributed positively to the overall\nquality of the experience.\nThere was only in total 7% of combined \"disagreement\"\n(3%) and \"strong disagreement\" (4%) on some of the issues.\nThe main disagreements (above 10% dissatisfaction rate)\nwere the following (however, the satisfaction rates range\nbetween 63% and 78% for all of these issues):\n(Q5) Field trip enhanced my qualifications to pursue a\nprofessional career, domestically;\n(Q6) Field trip enhanced my qualifications to pursue a\nprofessional career, internationally;\n(Q12) Field trip equipped me with skills to respond effec-\ntively to unfamiliar problems in my professional career;\n(Q13) Field trip equipped me with skills to respond effec-\ntively to unfamiliar problems in my university\neducation;\n(Q17) Planning education in my university performs at\nhigh level, internationally;\nTable 3.

The survey\nresults backed up the interview findings indicating interna-\ntional field trips as a significant contribution to student learn-\ning, professional and personal growth, understanding\ndiversity and international issues, having a big picture per-\nspective and building networks of cooperative work with\nincreased student competency and communication abilities.\nThese outcomes perfectly fulfill the objective of the course\nand the planning program at QUT. On the downside, con-\nstraints raised at the interviews and surveys point out to first,\nroom for improvement in the organization of field trips, and\nsecond, insufficiency of just one international field trip in the\nentire undergraduate planning education to build student\nknowledge, skills, and confidence to the highest level on the\ninternational planning practice.\nProfessor Interviews\nThe third analysis of the research was conducted to capture\nthe views of participant professors on the international field\ntrips and at the same time check the validity of student\nresponses collected by focus group interviews and surveys\nwith their professors.

The follow-\ning views, on the contribution of international field trips to\nstudent learning outcomes, most adequately summarize the\nopinions of the professorial group who participated in the\ninformal discussions and provided their feedback.\nAccording to Interviewee P3 (Professor Number 3),\nplanning exercises jointly conducted with overseas universities\nare not only teaching our students the cross-cultural dimensions\nof the discipline, equipping them with techniques on how to\nbetter deal with the urbanization problems of the new century,\nand increasing their job readiness in the highly globalizing\nworld, but also significantly contributing to their personal\ndevelopment by giving them confidence they need when they\nface new [and unfamiliar] problems, helping them to think out\nof the box, increasing their curiosity to learn and research, and\nbecoming more open and respectful to the different cultures,\ntraditions, voices, and perspectives of others.\nInterviewee P8 stated,\n[i]n the world we live in today, taking students out of the country\nfor a problem-oriented fieldwork is the new fashion of taking\nstudents out of classrooms for learning by experience . . . This\nway, the interaction and learning increases exponentially as a\nresult of experience boosted and triggered by the new, foreign\nand challenging environment. And [as in this joint planning\nexercise] it leads to better learning outcomes than most of the\ntraditional classroom-based instruction.\nPerhaps, most remarkable comment was potentially these\ninternational collaboration to\ngenerate a new type of student/professional that not only\nconfident in the practice of the discipline as much as the\nconceptual dimensions of it, but also preparing themselves for\nbetter understanding and solving the problems of global\ncommunities of the world . . . and eventually contributing to the\nworld peace and sustainable development. (Interviewee P6)\nSome issues identified from the collaborative study\nrelated to the students having more information provided\nabout the host country prior to commencement of the trip and\nhaving some shorter days during the study tour so that stu-\ndents are not overwhelmed by the full trip itinerary. Another\nissue related to language and cultural barriers which at times\nprevented effective communication, however on reflection,\nmany students came to regard this as part of the experience\nand a way to develop intercultural communication skills.\nThe final issue raised in the interviews was the financial\nburden of these trips to the teaching staff.All professors were\nvolunteered to take part in these activities with no payment\nfor their time. Beyond this, almost all hosting and visiting\nprofessors spent a reasonable amount from their pocket in\nthese trips as the funding from their universities only covered\nparts of their basic expenses. This brings us to the conclusion\nof the necessity of these international field trips to be included\nin the curriculum with a significant amount of funding to\nsecure the sustainability of these international interactions.\nStudent Performance Analysis\nThe final analysis of the research was the performance analy-\nsis. This analysis was conducted to check whether the inter-\nnational field trip actually contributed positively to the\nlearning of the students. The research used the marks stu-\ndents received from their three assignments and the final\ngrade of the course as the metrics of learning (similar to\nHouser et al., 2011). The analysis, for determining the contri-\nbutions of the international field trips, compared the marks\nreceived between the students who participated in an interna-\ntional field trip and their peers who did not. As mentioned\nplanning practice course, local projects were assigned to the\npart of the class who did not participate in international field\ntrips. Only at the last delivery (2011) of the course, students\nwho did not attend the field trip were also asked to take the\nsame international project. In all four deliveries of the course,\nthe assessment criteria were kept exactly identical regardless\nof students' involvement in an international project.\nTable 5 depicts the student achievement differences, con-\ncerning three assignments and the final grades, between\nthose who attended (n = 94) and had not attended (n = 243)\nresults, for the 4-year average, indicate more than a 10%\n(10.34%) improved final grade for those who attended the\ninternational field trip. For the 4-year average, when each of\nthe three assignment results were put under microscope, the\nhighest mark increase was recorded in Assignment 1\n(17.93%) that is most likely due to the nature of the assess-\nment item (regional appraisal) being a field trip report and\nprepared with intense engagement of students with the case\nstudy region. The lowest increase was recorded for\nAssignment 2 (5.22%). This is again most likely due to the\nnature of assessment item (regional activity analysis report\nincluding a thorough review of the relevant literature) involv-\ning literature review that can be conducted equally as good\nby the students who did not participate in the international\nfield trip. The second highest performance increase was\nrecorded for Assignment 3 (10.60%). This also can be\nexplained due to the nature of the assessment item (regional\ndevelopment plan proposal) focusing on the preparation of a\ndevelopment plan for the case study area.\nDuring all four deliveries of the course, the analysis find-\nings point out to quite a high-level assignment score achieve-\nment of the students who participated to the international\nfield trip compared with their peers who did not (i.e., between\nin line with the empirical study findings (students partici-\npated in international field trip n = 20 and who did not n =\ntribution of international field trip to improving test perfor-\nmance through engagement and new social networks.\nConclusion\nThe experiences from the international field trips reported in\nthis article confirm, in line with the literature findings, that\ninternational study collaborations reinforce the realization of\nthe key objective of urban and regional planning courses--\nthat is, in the case of QUT: providing knowledge, skills, and\nhands-on experiences to students for them to be able to work\nunder diverse urban and regional contexts and be able to\nrespond and address complex urban and regional problems.\nInternational field trips set a new dimension in the way visit-\ning and hosting organizations run their degree in planning\nand conduct courses particularly that have global implica-\ntions. These international field trips exposed students to vari-\nous aspects of planning, their complexities, similarities, and\ndifferences in an international context that have contributed\nstudent learning, competency, skills, and capabilities.\nThe interview and survey results of participating students,\nperformance analysis of international field trip participants\nin comparison with their peers who did not participated in\nthese field trips, and informal discussions with professors\nfrom visiting and hosting universities highlight the benefits\nof such international field trips in terms of student learning\nexperience and exposure to different cultural contexts. From\nthe student perspective, the experience has proven invaluable\nin terms of cross-cultural engagement and developing inter-\nnational networks as for most of the students, being involved\nin an international exercise was a unique experience in their\neducation and professional career and beyond this in their\npersonal growth. From the professors' perspective, the expo-\nsure to different planning processes and practices gave stu-\ndents a new outlook on what they knew from their own\ncountry as well as some insights on international planning\nissues and cultural differences and barriers.\nThe analyses results revealed that, on one hand, exposure of\nstudents to international planning practice is a big opportunity\nand incorporating international field trips in the planning cur-\nriculum is an effective method for achieving a more holistic\neducational experience and cultivating the pedagogy of experi-\nence, while internationalizing the education. On the other hand,\nsome of the organization and logistics constraints and chal-\nlenges need attention to increase the student satisfaction and\nthe success level of prospective international field trips.\nIn line with the findings of Dee et al. (2011), the key inter-\nnational regional planning collaboration findings highlighted\nin this article indicate that (a) greater depth is added to the\nurban and regional planning course from international study\ncollaborations, (b) students developed intercultural skills\nthat are an asset in professional practice when faced with\ndiverse and complex planning issues, (c) professors extended\ntheir teaching (and also research) collaboration, and (d)\nStudents are exposed to different planning systems and pro-\ncesses, which challenge existing outlooks and encourage cre-\nativity and innovation.\nThe outcomes of the international field trip experiences\nhave potentials to shed some light on formulation of the 21st-\ncentury planning education considering the challenges of the\nrapidly changing and globalizing world. This article, besides,\nprovides useful insights on how to develop an international\nfield trip and combine activities mentioned earlier in the arti-\ncle with the trip. The evolution of the activities over time is\nalso a useful learning for other schools planning to conduct\nsuch international activities. Finally, perhaps as stated by a\nfield trip participant professor (Interviewee P1), such \"inter-\nnational collaboration experience may foster professionals\nthat contributes the world to become a better place by being\nopen and understanding the others.\"\nTable 5.
