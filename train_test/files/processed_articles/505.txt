The purpose of this article is to provide older adults' sex-and-age-\nspecific normative values for accelerometer-determined steps/day, adjusted to a pedometer-based scale.\nMethods.The data source was accelerometer data collected over multiple valid days (defined as  10 h/day;\nExamination Survey. Accelerometer data were adjusted to a pedometer scale using an established process of censoring\nsteps counted during those minutes where activity counts totaled <500. Quintile-defined categories of adjusted steps/day\nand 85+ years) were computed for the entire sample and separately for each sex. LMSChartmakerPro was used to create\nsmoothed percentile curves corresponding to the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles.\nResults. Men aged 65\u00ad69 years defined the highest single category (>9,126 steps/day) and women aged 85+ years of\nage defined the lowest single category (<276 steps/day). In general, steps/day tended to decrease within each quintile-\ndefined category as age increased. Similar patterns were apparent in the more detailed LMSChartmakerPro percentiles.\nConclusions.These data represent the first presentation of a detailed population distribution of normative acceler-\nometer-determined steps/day adjusted to pedometer scaling, an instrument more likely to be used in clinical and public\nhealth applications.\nKey Words: Exercise--Physical activity--Public health.\nDecision Editor: Stephen Kritchevsky, PhD\nPhysical activity is associated with numerous and\nprofound health benefits throughout the life span (1);\nhowever, practicing a physically active lifestyle is per-\nhaps even more critical for older adults as they age and\nare increasingly threatened with mobility disability (2).\nMaintaining and promoting ambulatory activity is of pri-\nmary importance (3), and objectively measuring and track-\ning such behavior (eg, as steps/day) is critical to identifying\nthose at risk, conveying precise and actionable goals, and\nevaluating the impact of interventions (4). Sharing objec-\ntively determined steps/day can facilitate these processes\nby illuminating a clear understanding of how many steps/\nday older adults typically accumulate (ie, expected values)\nExpected values for older adults' steps/day have been\npreviously assembled from 28 published studies; mean\npedometer-determined ambulatory activity ranged from\nmonitored older adult studies represents an important ini-\ntial attempt to provide the much needed data to facilitate\ninterpretation of researchers' and practitioners' own data\ncollections. However, this assemblage of existing published\nvalues can be criticized as a reference source because the\ndata were pooled from different studies representing differ-\nent populations, sample sizes, measurement protocols, and\ninstrumentation. True normative data characterize what is\nusual in a defined population at a specific point (or period)\nin time by employing standardized methods.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a preferred source for U.S. normative\ndata because it is nationally representative in design and\nsystematically implemented at frequent time intervals. In\nstep data as part of its objective physical activity monitoring\nstrategy. Although a number of articles (7) have been\npublished with these step data, none have presented a\nthorough collation of sex-and-age-specific normative values\nrepresentingthecompletedatadistribution.Asaccelerometers\nare known to be more sensitive to low force accelerations than\npedometers (8,9) (which are more likely to be used in clinical\nand practical applications), an adjustment is necessary to\nmake the accelerometer output more representative of what\npedometers are likely to detect. The purpose of this article is\nto provide older adults' sex-and-age-specific U.S. normative\nvalues for accelerometer-determined steps/day adjusted to a\npedometer-based scale.\nMethods\nNHANES Physical Activity Monitor\nNHANES physical activity monitor protocols are availa-\nble at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/\nBM.pdf and have been described in detail elsewhere (7).\nBriefly, the National Center for Health Statistics ethics\nreview board approved all NHANES protocols, and all\nparticipants were asked to provide informed consent. The\nNHANES is designed to assess the health and nutrition sta-\ntus of noninstitutionalized adults and children in the United\nmodel 7164 accelerometer was used (formerly the CSA/\nMTI AM-7164, manufactured by ActiGraph of Ft Walton\nBeach, Florida) to assess physical activity, which included\nan enumeration of steps taken in addition to the more con-\nventional activity count output. The ActiGraph 7164, which\nis no longer distributed by the manufacturer, has been well\ndescribed previously (10).\nData Treatment\nThe SAS macro supplied by the National Cancer Institute\n(http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) was used\nto determine nonwear time (defined as 60 minutes of con-\nsecutive zero activity counts per minute, allowing minimal\ninterruptions). Although we did consider using a longer\nmately chose to remain consistent with previous analyses of\nNHANES accelerometer data, which specifically combined\nthe 60 minutes nonwear definition with a requirement for\nat least 10 hours of accelerometer wear time to define a\nvalid day of data (7). Different wear time algorithms have\ntheir most direct impact on estimates of sedentary time\ners (11) clearly acknowledge that a longer time window\nfor detecting nonwear in the elderly adult is intended to\n\"prevent sedentary behaviors from being misclassified as\nnonwear\" (page 2014). As this analysis of the NHANES\nolder adults' data does not attempt to estimate sedentary\nbehavior, but is instead expressly focused on steps/day, the\nimpact of different wear time algorithms is much less of a\nconcern. Another, and perhaps more important, reason to\nkeep with the conventional approach to defining nonwear\nis to assure reasonable comparability with future similar\npresentations of these NHANES data from children, ado-\nlescents, and adults <60 years of age. Using different deci-\nsion rules to treat the data across the life span will introduce\nartifacts that will most likely impair, or at the very least,\ndistort interpretation.\nUsing previously published criteria (16), step counts\nwere adjusted to better match those that might be obtained\nfrom pedometers. Specifically, in those minutes where\nactivity counts totaled <500, the corresponding step count\nfor that minute was set to zero, effectively decreasing the\noverall number of steps accumulated each day. A sensitivity\nanalysis of the effects of using this activity count cut point,\nrelative to others, has been previously published (17).\nStatistical Analysis\nAnalytic sample.-- Of the 1,359 eligible men and women\n60 years of age with physical activity monitor data, we\nexcluded participants with NHANES-designated unreliable\ndata (n = 54) or with accelerometers found to be out of cali-\nbration upon return (n = 61). We also excluded individuals\nwho did not have at least one valid day of accelerometer\nwear time (n = 48; 10 monitored h/day). The justification\nfor using a single day as the minimum criteria for valid\nwear has been presented elsewhere (16). Thus, the follow-\ning analysis was based on data from 1,196 older adults or\n88% of the originally eligible older adult sample.\nDescriptive characteristics.--Descriptive characteristics\nwere calculated using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute LLC,\nand 80+ years) group-specific age, race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nor other), height (cm), body mass (kg), body mass index\n(BMI; kg/m2), and percent classified by BMI status as\nkg/m2), overweight\nWhen appropriate, survey procedures were used to account\nfor the complex, multistage probability design used in\nNHANES. Step count values were averaged across all\nvalid days of accelerometer wear time for each participant.\nPairwise comparisons of accelerometer wear time and\nsteps/day between sexes were conducted using two-sided\nt-tests with 15 df. The level of significance  was set to .05\nfor all inferential analyses. Quintile-defined categories of\nsteps/day (lowest, below average, average, above average,\nsample and separately for each sex.\nLMS curves.--LMSChartmakerPro (LMS Chartmaker\nversion 2.54) was used to create smoothed percentile curves\nbased on the LMS method (19). LMS smoothing is a stand-\nard analytical technique for presenting normative data by sex\nand across specific age ranges. It has been used to develop\nand present the well-known Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention growth charts (20). It has also been used to present\nnormative data for body fat percentiles (21), physical fitness\n(22), and bone densitometry (23). Without a smoothing pro-\ncess, the raw dependent variable data present a noisy or jagged\nline, with many ups and downs occurring along its age-defined\nlength. The smoothing process captures and presents the gen-\neralized line, more useful for clinical applications.\nThe LMS method utilizes a Box\u00adCox power transforma-\ntion, with parameters corresponding to the skewness (L:\nBox\u00adCox power, ), median (M), and coefficient of variation\n(S), to normalize the data at each year of age. L, M, and S\nare estimated at each age t, and then cubic splines are fitted\nby maximum penalized likelihood to create smoothed curves\n(L[t], M[t], and S[t]) for each of the parameters. Centile\ncurves are created using the values of L, M, and S at each age\nfrom the smoothed curves, along with the normal equivalent\ndeviate.The global fit of the smoothed curves was assessed by\nQ statistics for each of the curves (24), implemented within\nthe software. The extent of smoothing, and curve complex-\nity, increases with the equivalent degrees of freedom for L(t),\nM(t), and S(t). These degrees of freedom were chosen to be\nas small as possible, while still bringing the Q tests close to\nnormality, therefore creating a parsimonious model. In order\nto avoid artificially creating differences through modeling\nprocedures, the model was fitted for the entire sample, and\nthe L, M, and S values chosen for the entire sample were then\napplied to each sex separately. All LMS model fitting was\nconducted while accounting for NHANES sample weights.\nResults\nDescriptive characteristics of the analysis sample are dis-\nplayed in Table 1. Mean accelerometer wear time among\nthe analyzed sample was (M \u00b1 SE) 13.9\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n0.1 valid days. Men accumu-\nmin/day more accelerometer wear time than\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n4,548), with men accumulating significantly more steps/\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nTable 2 presents steps/day ranges across the five quintile-\ndefined categories by combined age groups for the entire\nsample and separately for each sex. Men aged 65\u00ad69 years\ndefined the highest single category (>9,126 steps/day) and\nwomen aged 85+ years of age defined the lowest single\ncategory (<276 steps/day). In general, steps/day tended\nto decrease within each quintile-defined category as age\nincreased. Notable exceptions were the above average and\nhighest categories, as the fourth quintile of steps/day was\nage group for the entire sample and for each sex separately.\nAlso, the second and fourth quintiles of steps/day were\nage group in men.\nLMS curves of steps/day for each sex are presented in\nFigure 1. Normative percentile values of steps/day by\neach single-age year for men and women are displayed in\nTables 3 and 4, respectively. LMS derived 20th percentiles\nfor steps/day were higher than the 1st quintile presented in\npercentiles for steps/day were higher than the fourth quin-\nand 80\u00ad84 year olds and among women in all cases except\nDiscussion\nAs noted earlier, the discrepancy between accelerometer\nand pedometer-determined steps/day is known (8,9).\nThe source of this discrepancy has been traced to a\nMen Women Men Women Men Women\nRace/ethnicity\nNotes: BMI = body mass index; NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Values presented as M (SE).\nbetween-instrument difference in sensitivity to low force\naccelerations, the accelerometer being more sensitive (25).\nFor example, the between-instrument difference in steps/\nday detected in free-living populations has averaged as\nto as high as ~8,100 steps/day (in an older adult sample)\nFigure 1. LMS curves of steps/day for each sex, 60+ years of age: 2005\u00ad2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nTable 2. Quintile-Defined Normative Categories of Steps/Day by Sex and Age Group: NHANES 2005\u00ad2006\nSteps/day\nLowest Below Average Average Above Average Highest\nNote: NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n(27), suggesting that between-instrument differences are\nindividualized and that a \"one-size-fits-all\" correction\nfactor is crude and therefore inappropriate. The process\nof censoring those steps taken at <500 activity counts/\nmin allows for an individualized adjustment because\neach individual will logically accrue a different number\nof minutes below this threshold and a variable number of\nsteps within these designated minutes. When applied to\nthe NHANES accelerometer data, the resulting average\nsteps/day estimates are compatible with other surveys\nconducted with pedometers (28\u00ad30). We have previously\nreported a sensitivity analysis of this cut point relative to\nother candidates (17). Due to their relative low cost and\ntechnological simplicity, pedometers are more likely than\naccelerometers to be used in walking interventions (31)\nand other practical applications, including wide spread\nadoption by lay people (32). Because the NHANES did not\nconcurrently collect data with a pedometer, for public health\npurposes, we are left to extrapolating normative pedometer-\ndetermined steps/day by systematically adjusting these\nnationally representative accelerometer data.\nThese data confirm the well-known sex- and age-related\ndifferences in steps/day, even in samples restricted to older\nadults (5). The data are also generally compatible with pre-\nviously published expected values for older adults' pedom-\neter-determined steps/day (5), however, and we do report\nlower extreme values. One explanation of this apparent\ndeparture is that none of the previously summarized studies\nwere based on population samples. Further, lower steps/day\nvalues have been reported for special populations includ-\ning older adults living with chronic disease and/or disability\nday (37). These normative data go beyond simple indicators\nof central tendency and instead portray values representing\nthe complete distribution of expected values.\nObviously, there is no \"average\" older adult, and so it\nis impossible to provide a single average steps/day value\nthat is fully representative, especially across sex and age\ngroups. The assembled quintile values (Table 2) and the\nmore detailed percentile values for steps/day presented in\nTables 3 (men) and 4 (women) by each single-age year\nrepresent the first truly comprehensive normative steps/\nday data for older adults. Organized by sex, age, and per-\ncentile rank, the steps/day values contained in these tables\ncan serve as important reference values for researchers and\npractitioners engaged in screening, surveillance, evaluation,\nplanning, and tracking activities. For example, researchers\nmay refer to these tables to identify specific percentile val-\nues that may be appropriate for intervention recruiting pur-\nposes. As another example of apparent utility, the Lifestyle\nInterventions For Elderly study is an important multicenter\nrandomized control trial designed to evaluate the impact of\nlong-term moderate intensity walking-based program on\nincident mobility disability (38). Accelerometry is one is\nTable 3. Normative Steps/Day Values for Men by Age in Years (LMS method): NHANES 2005\u00ad2006\nAge n\nPercentiles\nNote: NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nits planned outcome measures and steps/day can be ana-\nlyzed. The normative data presented here may be useful to\nLifestyle Interventions For Elderly researchers interested in\ncharacterizing their sample compared to this nationally rep-\nresentative sample. From a population level, characteristics\nof those averaging 75th percentile values or higher, obtained\nfrom Tables 3 and 4, might be described. Tracking activities\ncould be implemented to evaluate the relative impact (in\nterms of changes in quintile rankings assembled in Table 2)\nof program and policy interventions. These data could also\nbe directly accessed by clinicians and older adults them-\nselves to compare their personal data to that of similar aged\npeers' data contained in Tables 3 and 4.\nAlthough previous research has shown that pedom-\neters miss steps taken by nursing home residents, they are\nacceptably accurate in community-dwelling older adults\n(39). The NHANES data were collected from noninstitu-\ntionalized individuals, so the presented values that have\nbeen adjusted to a pedometer-based scale can only be gen-\neralized to similar populations. In addition, these data are\nU.S. centric and may not be generalizable to other world\npopulations. U.S. values for steps/day are among the low-\nest in comparable population surveys (40). The data are\ndescriptive and focused on relative peer-based rankings\nonly, so cannot be used to infer threshold values associ-\nated with any health outcome. As mentioned previously,\npedometers were not used to collect data in NHANES,\nand the process used to adjust these accelerometer data\nto a pedometer-based scale ultimately represents a \"best\nguess,\" yet rational approach given known discrepancies\nbetween these two types of instruments. No other nation-\nally representative data source can be used at this time to\nproduce better estimates.\nIn summary, these data fill a notable knowledge gap con-\ncerning objectively monitored ambulatory activity of older\nadults. They represent the first presentation of a detailed\npopulation distribution of accelerometer-determined steps/\nday adjusted to pedometer scaling, an instrument more\nlikely to be used in clinical and public health applications.\nThe percentiles presented herein will be useful to research-\ners and practitioners for multiple purposes.\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\nReferences\n1.
