Paul Silvian,\nRavi Shankar Reddy,\nVenkata Nagaraj Kakaraparthi, Irshad Ahmad\nand Mohammad Mahtab Alam\n Keywords\nHand grip strength, hand length, age, forearm circumference, healthy adult males, hand-held\ndynamometer, Saudi Arabia\nIntroduction\nHand grip strength estimation is imperative\nin determining the efficacy of treatment\nstrategies and hand rehabilitation. This\nstrength is the result of a maximum volun-\ntary forceful flexion of the fingers by an\nindividual under normal conditions.1 Grip\nstrength is crucial for the human body while\nperforming prehensile and precision hand\nfunctions. The human hand is a complex\nstructure tailored to the functions of\nmanipulation, and the hand conveys sensory\ninformation to brain about temperature,\nform and texture of the objects it controls.2\nGrip strength has been studied as a predictor\nof general health, heart disease,3 cerebro-\nvascular disease,4,5 disability,4,5 cognitive\ndecline,4,5 future fracture risks,6,7 and mor-\ntality.8,9 Many studies have correlated grip\nstrength with various physical variables like\nnutritional status, bone mineral content,\nand muscle strength.4,10 Research suggests\nthat there are strong correlations between\ngrip strength and various anthropometric\ntraits, such as age,11 hand length,12 body\nmass index (BMI),13 and upper arm circum-\nference.14 Such correlations have been found\nto exist in studies among children, adults\nPreviously published studies have used\nregression models to understand the role of\nanthropometric measures in determining\nhand grip strength. For example, hand\nlength and hand width were positively\nassociated with grip strength.16,17 It has\nalso been shown that the dominant hand\nhas approximately 10% stronger grip\nstrength than the non-dominant hand.18\nResearch suggests that forearm circumfer-\nence is predictive of grip strength in men but\nnot in women.19 A previous study proposed\nthat the hand circumference could be used\nfor predicting hand grip strength among\nundergraduate students.20 In a study of the\nrelationship between hand grip strength and\nstature, weight, arm circumferences and\nsubcutaneous skin folds, males attained\ngreater values for anthropometric variables\nand greater hand grip strength values than\ntheir female counterparts.21 Research has\nbeen undertaken to determine the relation-\nship between forearm circumference and\ngrip strength among athletes and basketball\nplayers.22,23 To date, there are mixed opin-\nions on whether anthropometric measures\ncan predict maximum hand grip strength.24\nHand grip strength measurement\nbecomes reliable only when standardized\nmethods and calibrated equipment are used,\neven when there are different assessors or\ndifferent brands of dynamometers.25 Hand-\nheld dynamometers have been used to meas-\nure muscle strength, especially muscles that\nare strong enough to exert force against\ngravity and tolerate resistance. The Jamar\u00d5\nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer (Patterson\nMedical [formerly Sammons Preston],\nWarrenville, IL, USA) was found to give\nthe most accurate and acceptable measures\nFrom a literature review, many studies\nmention various measurements such as hand\nbreadth, hand length, or circumferences of\nthe wrist and forearm as predictors of hand\ngrip strength, but the evidence remains\nscarce and varied. For example, some\nresearch has investigated hand grip strength\nin children and adolescents,28 while other\nstudies have considered differences between\nthe dominant and non-dominant hand.18,22\nData on healthy adults and hand grip\nstrength are scarce in the Middle East.\nA study that assessed the hand grip strength\nin healthy adults from 21 countries found\nthat men in the Middle East exhibited\nintermediate hand grip strength compared\nwith the highest levels of hand grip strength\nnoted among European and North\nAmerican populations.29 Other than this\nrecent study, there is still a dearth of avail-\nable literature on hand grip strength in the\nSaudi Arabian male population. Recent\nstudies have suggested that hand length\nand forearm circumference should be stu-\ndied as additional factors when measuring\nhand grip strength.28,30 Previous research\nusing predictive analyses have confirmed\nhand circumference to be the most signifi-\ncant predictor of grip strength.28 There are\nvery few studies that have compared a wide\nrange of age in terms of understanding the\nrelationship between age and hand grip\nstrength.4,31 There have been varied results\nin the understanding of the relationship\nbetween BMI and hand grip strength;1,10\nwith BMI being shown to be insignificant in\nsome studies of hand grip strength.12,32\nThis present study aimed to determine\nwhether age, BMI, hand length and forearm\ncircumference were predictive of hand grip\nstrength in healthy adult Saudi Arabian\nmales.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis cross-sectional descriptive study\nenrolled healthy male subjects who were\nrandomly recruited during the time of stu-\ndent admission to King Khalid University,\nAbha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study\nwas conducted by the Department of\nMedical Rehabilitation Sciences, College of\nApplied Medical Sciences, King Khalid\nUniversity, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi\nDepartment of Physical Therapy, King\nKhalid University. Inclusion criteria were\nas follows: (i) aged 20\u00ad74 years; (ii) in good\nhealth; (iii) willing to participate in the\nstudy. Exclusion criteria were as follows:\n(i) recent hand injury or surgery; (ii) hand\ndeformity: (iii) any oedematous, vascular, or\ninflammatory condition of the hand; (iv)\nneck problems.\nThe study received ethical approval from\nthe King Khalid University Ethical\nHealthy subjects gave written informed con-\nsent after being provided with a brief\ndescription of the study.\nAnthropometric measurements\nAge was recorded for each study subject.\nBMI was measured using a standard digital\nweighing scale and a standard height scale\nand was calculated using the formula:\nBMI \u00bc weight (kg)/height (m)2. The forearm\ngirth circumference of each study subject\nwas measured using a flexible measuring\ntape (cm) at a point 3 cm below the cubital\nfossa. The point to be measured was marked\nwith a marker pen. The hand length was\nmeasured from the distal crease of the wrist\nto the tip of the middle finger using a flexible\nmeasuring tape (cm).\nHand grip strength recording\nPrior to the commencement of data collec-\ntion, a practice trial was undertaken in order\nto familiarize the subjects with the Jamar\u00d5\nHydraulic Hand Dynamometer (Patterson\nMedical [formerly Sammons Preston],\nWarrenville, IL, USA). Before testing, the\nexaminer (V.N.K.) demonstrated how to\nhold the handle of the dynamometer.\nSubjects were asked to maximally squeeze\nthe handle of the dynamometer with their\ndominant hand for 3 s and this process was\nrepeated for all of the handle positions. For\nstandardization, the third handle position\nwas selected on the basis of comfort and\nmaximum voluntary contraction. The sub-\njects were asked to sit with their shoulders in\na neutral position and the dominant arm\nwas positioned at the side of the body with\nthe elbow flexed to 90 and the wrist in a\nmild ulnar deviated position. The same\ninstructions were given for each trial. After\nthe subject was positioned with the dyna-\nmometer, the examiner (V.N.K.) instructed\nthe subject to `squeeze as hard as possible \u00ad\nhard, harder and relax'. The subjects were\nprovided with a rest period of 2 min to\ncontrol for the effects of fatigue. Three trials\nwere performed and recorded for each sub-\nject and the maximum voluntary hand grip\nstrength was calculated as the mean of the\nthree trials of grip strength for the dominant\nhand.\nStatistical analyses\nlated using the following formula, where,\nportion of population picking a choice\nSS \u00bc\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. The mean of three consecutive\ntrials of hand grip strength for each subject\nwas used for the analyses. After establishing\nnormality of the data using the Shapiro\u00ad\nWilk parametric test, a stepwise multiple\nlinear regression analysis was used to deter-\nmine the influence of anthropometric data\non hand grip strength. Pearson correlation\ncoefficient was used to provide a better\nunderstanding of the relationship between\nfour anthropometric measures and hand\ngrip strength. The mean hand grip strength\nvalue of the dominant hand was used as the\ndependent variable hand grip strength\nfor the stepwise regression analyses. A\nP-value 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nA total of 125 healthy volunteers were\nscreened for inclusion in the study. Of\nthese, seven were excluded based on the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria and two\nrefused to participate.

The variables age,\nBMI, forearm circumference and hand\nlength were entered into the equation. This\nregression analysis was used to evaluate the\norder of importance of the four variables\nand to select the useful subset of variables in\nexplaining the dependent variable.33 The\nregression model selected only three vari-\nables, hand length, age and forearm circum-\nference to be the significant predictors of\nhand grip strength (Table 3). Hand length\nwas found to have a correlation with hand\ngrip strength indicated by R \u00bc 0.500 and\nthe variation in hand grip strength. Age was\nthe second variable selected into the regres-\nsion equation, with an inverse correlation\n(indicated by R \u00bc 0.611 and a negative t-\nvalue). Age accounted for an additional\n12.3% (R2 change) and together with hand\nlength accounted for 37.3% of the variation\nin hand grip strength among healthy males.\nForearm circumference accounted for an\nadditional 6.9% (R2 change) and together\nwith age and hand length accounted for\n44.2% of the variation in hand grip strength.\nThe three variables together predicted\nhand grip strength of healthy adult males\nin Saudi Arabia.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the present study show that a\nstronger hand grip strength is determined by\na longer hand length, a larger forearm\ncircumference and a younger age in Saudi\nTable 2.

To the best of our knowledge,\nthis present study is the only one to report\nthe predictive relationships between hand\ngrip strength and the anthropometric meas-\nures under study in a Saudi Arabian popu-\nlation of adult males. This present study\nprovides evidence that body dimensions can\ninfluence hand grip strength, which might\nhave an impact on rehabilitation. The hand\nlength of a patient can be measured easily\nand conveniently, and this can be a practical\nmeasure for predicting hand grip strength.\nThe wide variation in the age of the healthy\nparticipants in the present study provided a\nbetter understanding of the effect of age on\nhand grip strength.\nThe present study was designed to deter-\nmine the relationship between hand grip\nstrength and hand dimensions using a\nstandardized protocol so that the predictors\nof hand grip strength could be identified.\nThe study used the third handle position of\nthe Jamar\u00d5 Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer.\nGrip testing is usually undertaken using the\nsecond and third handle positions of the\nJamar\u00d5 Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer,34\nbut the participants in the present study\nexhibited comfort and maximum hand grip\nstrength when using the third handle pos-\nition. Because of the difference in hand size,\nwomen tend to exhibit their greatest grip\nstrengths with the handle in the second\nposition, whereas the third handle position\nis usually the most advantageous for men.35\nA Pearson correlation coefficient matrix\nfor age, BMI, hand length, forearm circum-\nference and hand grip strength demonstrated\nthat the five anthropometric measures had\ncorrelations with each other, except for age,\nwhich was not correlated with BMI and\nforearm circumference. All four anthropo-\nmetric measures had significant correlations\nwith hand grip strength. An earlier study\nfound that only hand circumference had a\nsignificant impact on hand grip strength.20\nAnother study conducted in Malaysia found\nthat forearm circumference and hand length\nwere systematically selected in a regression\nmodel predicting hand grip.24 Hand length\nwas found to be the most significant con-\ntributor to hand grip strength in the present\nstudy, accounting for 25% of the variation in\nthe hand grip strength. Previous research\ndemonstrated that hand length had a signifi-\ncant impact on the grip strength.29 Men are\nfound to have longer hands when compared\nwith women.7 Dominant right hand grip\nstrength was found to be strongly associated\nwith hand length, hand width, and forearm\ngirth, but was not associated with height,\nweight and BMI in healthy Indian collegiate\nlength measured in the present study also\nmeasured the middle finger length (distal\ncrease), the variable hand length could\nencompass a more predictive power when\nmeasuring hand grip strength.\nIn the present study, hand grip strength\nwas inversely associated with age and the\nrelationship was likely caused by a decline\nin musculoskeletal strength and muscle\nmass with increasing age. There might\nalso have been reduced steadiness of the\nhand among the older participants com-\npared with younger participants, which\ncould have led to reduced hand grip\nstrength in this present study. The mean\nage of the participants in this present study\nolder than 31 years (n \u00bc 91), which might\nexplain the inverse correlation with age.\nPrior research has demonstrated that hand\ngrip strength showed a significant correl-\nation with age when measured using a\nJamar\u00d5 Smart Hand Dynamometer.36\nForearm circumference provides the most\npractical index of hand grip strength related\nto muscle mass, and was the most significant\npredictor of hand grip strength in several\nstudies.20,25 In the stepwise multiple linear\nregression equation in the present study,\nforearm circumference was found to con-\ntribute only 6.9% to hand grip strength,\nmaking it the third and last predictor.\nThe muscles used to produce grip force are\npredominantly located in the forearm and\nwould be heavily influenced by the amount\nof fat.37 In this present study, there is a high\ncorrelation between BMI and forearm cir-\ncumference (r \u00bc 0.680), indicating that the\nhand size of the participants was higher.\nSince the majority of the population lies in\nthe overweight and obese categories,15 this\ncould be the reason why the forearm cir-\ncumference was found to have a lower\nregression value of 6.9% on hand grip\nstrength in this Saudi Arabian population.\nFat-free cross-sectional area is found to be\nhighly correlated with hand grip strength.20\nIn a recent study comparing the global hand\ngrip strength, the BMI of Middle Eastern\nthere was a higher number of overweight\nindividuals in the Middle East when com-\npared with Asian, Chinese and African male\nIn the present study, BMI demonstrated\na positive correlation with hand grip\nstrength, but it was excluded from the\nstepwise regression model. The reason for\nthe exclusion would be the lack of partici-\npants in the lowest BMI category (n \u00bc 0;\n<18.5 kg/m2). BMI and hand grip strength\nresearch has provided conflicting findings.\nFor example, elderly individuals with\nnormal BMI show positive correlations,\nwhereas in adults aged 25\u00ad70 years in the\noverweight and obese ranges, BMI was\ncorrelated with a lower hand grip\nstrength.10,32 This could also be the reason\nwhy in the Pearson correlation coefficient\nmatrix in the present study, age was not\nsignificantly correlated with BMI.\nIn the present study, hand length was\nfound to be the most significant variable in\npredicting hand grip strength among Saudi\nArabian men. Hand length, age and forearm\ngirth circumference predicted 44.2% of\nhand grip strength in the Saudi Arabian\nmen in this present study. This result concurs\nwith earlier studies, which demonstrated\nthat hand length and forearm circum-\nference contributed to 23% of hand grip\ncompared with previous research,24 but it\nwas still <50%, which reduced the predictive\ncapacity of the overall model.\nThe study had several limitations. First,\nthe small sample size, lack of female partici-\npants and the wide age range makes it\ndifficult to make generalizations based on\nthe findings. Secondly, a better prediction\nmodel could have been obtained if the study\nhad taken account of the dominant hand,\nphysical activity of the participant, hand\nproblems and muscle mass. Thirdly, the\ncross-sectional nature of this study cannot\ndetermine the longitudinal course of indi-\nvidual grip strengths. Future research could\nalso determine if palm width, middle finger\nlength, shoulder position, joint position,\nthumb position and body posture impact\non the hand grip strength.\nIn conclusion, the present study provides\na sample of healthy adult male data on hand\ngrip strength for clinical use and hand\nrehabilitation. It explored the relationship\nbetween grip strength and hand length, age\nand forearm circumference. Hand length\nand forearm circumference should be con-\nsidered for hand grip strength measurements\nin the older age group since these anthropo-\nmetric measures could impact on the results\nof therapy and influence hand function\ntraining.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nReferences\n1.
