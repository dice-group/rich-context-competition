Interactions with gender and race/ethnicity were also examined.\nMethods and Procedures: Participants were a subsample of individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of adolescents followed from 1995 to 2002. The\nsample analyzed included a subset of 1,584 unrelated individuals with genotype data. Multiple logistic regressions\nwere conducted to evaluate the associations between genotypes and obesity (BMI > 29.9) or overweight + obese\ncombined (BMI  25) with normal weight (BMI = 18.5\u00ad24.9) as a referent. Linear regression models were used to\nexamine change in BMI from adolescence to young adulthood.\nResults: Significant associations were found between SLC6A4 5HTTLPR and categories of BMI, and between MAOA\npromoter variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) among men and categories of BMI. Stratified analyses revealed that\nthe association between these two genes and excess BMI was significant for men overall and for white and Hispanic\nmen specifically. Linear regression models indicated a significant effect of SLC6A4 5HTTLPR on change in BMI from\nadolescence to young adulthood.\nDiscussion: Our findings lend further support to the involvement of genes implicated in dopamine and serotonin\nregulation on energy balance.\nINTRODUCTION\nObesity increases the risk for a number of serious health con-\nditions including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and\nsome cancers (1,2). Thus, the identification of biological, psy-\nchological,environmental,social,andgeneticfactorsthatinter-\nact to influence overweight and obesity is of high importance\n(3). Although the causes of obesity in society are numerous, at\nthe individual level, genetics is thought to play an important\nrole in regulating energy balance and in the development of\nobesity (4). Both twin and family studies suggest that obesity\nis influenced by genetic factors (5\u00ad7) and several candidate\ngenes have been associated with obesity-related phenotypes.\ndidate genes have been found to be significantly associated\nwith obesity-related phenotypes across 416 studies (8). Yet, the\nnumber of genes found to be consistently associated with obes-\nity-related phenotypes across these studies (n = 22) is much\nsmaller. An emerging area of research has begun to explore the\npotential association between specific candidate genes regulat-\ning brain serotonin and dopamine systems with obesity. These\nneurotransmitter systems are hypothesized to regulate behav-\nioral and metabolic responses associated with the development\nof obesity through feeding and satiety (9).\nConverging evidence suggests that dopaminergic neu-\nrotransmission regulates feeding behaviors in humans\ngene studies of dopamine-related genes have focused on the\ndopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), DRD4, and solute carrier\n1Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 2Health Promotion Research Branch, National Cancer\nInstitute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; 3Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 4Department of\nMedicine, Center for Human Genetics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 5Genetic Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,\nMaryland, USA; 6Center for Health Science, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA.

Findings from studies of DRD2 have\nbeen mixed with some studies detecting an association with\n\nobesity-related phenotypes (14\u00ad18), whereas others report no\nassociation (19\u00ad23). At least two studies of DRD4 have shown\nan association between higher BMI and carriers of the 7 repeat\nallele found in the third exon of the gene (24,25). One of these\nstudies suggested that the association was influenced by race,\nas it was presented among African Americans and Hispanics,\nbut not American whites (24). Finally, two studies of current\nsmokers have reported an association between SLC6A3 and\nthe phenotypes of obesity (20) and food reinforcement (26).\nThus, there is increasing evidence that the dopaminergic sys-\ntem may indeed be involved in obesity-related phenotypes.\nSerotonergic functioning has also been hypothesized to be\nimportant for regulating eating behaviors and body weight\n(27,28). For instance, administration of serotonergic agents\nhave been shown to suppress eating behaviors (29,30) and\nreduce craving for high carbohydrate foods (31). Candidate\ngene studies of the serotonergic system have examined the\namino acid transporter gene and the serotonin receptor and\ntransporter genes. At least two studies have indicated a rela-\ntionship between the SLC6A14 gene and obesity-related\n\nphenotypes (32,33). This gene is relevant to serotonin signal-\ning as it is associated with tryptophan availability for serotonin\nsynthesis. An association has been found between a polymor-\nand higher levels of abdominal obesity and BMI among adults\n(34,35) and increased energy and fat intake in children (36).\nThere is an additional support for this polymorphism being\ninvolved in energy balance in overweight adult subjects (37).\nHowever, one subsequent study failed to detect an associa-\ntion with this polymorphism and obesity in children, though\nthe study was underpowered (38). Fewer studies have exam-\nined serotonin transport gene with the exception of a recent\nstudy of Argentinean adolescents which found an association\nbetween a polymorphism of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4\nand overweight (39).\nThe monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene produces an\nenzyme that metabolizes dopamine and serotonin (in addition\nto noradrenaline) and it has also been examined for association\nwith obesity phenotypes. In a large UK cohort (n = 1,150) of\nwhite women, significant associations were detected between\nMAOA and BMI, with the low-activity genotype (3/3) being\nmore frequent among obese women (40). This finding sup-\nports a family-based study in which preferential transmission\nof the low activity\u00adrelated allele was observed among subjects\nAlthough the possible association between genes regu-\nlating dopamine and serotonin with obesity is promis-\ning, the relevance is uncertain with respect to population\nlevel effects. This is because many studies are derived from\n\nclinical or convenience samples making it difficult to extrapo-\nlate to general populations. Therefore, replication studies in\n\npopulation-based cohorts are clearly warranted (42). Using a\nlarge \npopulation-based cohort of young adults, we addressed\nthe hypothesis that variation in genes associated with dop-\namine function (SLC6A3, DRD2, DRD4), serotonin func-\ntion (SLC6A4), and regulation of monoamine levels (MAOA)\nmay be predictive of BMI categories (obese and overweight +\nobese) in young adulthood, as well as predictive of changes\nin BMI as adolescents transit into young adulthood. As stud-\nies have shown that gender can affect both feeding (43) and\naddictive behaviors (44) and allelic frequency of these genes\n(45) and expression (46) vary by ethnic/racial ancestry, we fur-\nther evaluated gene by gender and gene by race interactions.\nTo examine the factors driving interaction effects, we followed\nsignificant effects with stratified analyses when \nsample sizes\npermitted.\nMETHODS AND Procedures\nData source\nThe study population was 20,745 adolescents from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally\nrepresentative study of adolescents. The longitudinal cohort includes\n15,197 eligible respondents who completed in-home surveys on three\nIII were 18 years of age or older. By design, the Add Health survey\nincluded a sample stratified by region, urbanicity, school type, \nethnic\nmix, and size to garner a nationally representative sample. Precise\ndetails regarding the design and data collection have been described\nStudy sample\nAt Wave III, a subset of individuals identified to be full siblings or twins\nat earlier waves (n = 3,787) consented to provide a saliva sample for\nDNA analysis. The study conformed to local institutional review board\napproved procedures (further details can be obtained at www.cpc.unc.\nedu/projects/addhealth). For our analyses, we included only unre-\nlated individuals by randomly selecting one sibling from each sibship.\nParticipants who were pregnant were excluded from analysis (n = 51).\nFor the analyses comparing normal weight individuals (defined as BMI\nbetween 18.5 and 25) to obese individuals (BMI > 30), the total available\nsample included 1,133 individuals. For the analyses comparing normal\nweight individuals to overweight and obese individuals (BMI > 25), the\ntotal available sample included 1,584 individuals. Genotype was miss-\ning for one or more of the genetic markers for some individuals which\nresulted in variability in the total number of individuals available for\neach gene-specific analysis.\nGenotyping\nBuccal samples were collected on the participants and DNA extracted\nusing a modification of procedures described previously (49\u00ad52) (fur-\nther details at www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth). Six functional\npolymorphisms were genotyped within six candidate genes that had\nbeenpreviouslyassociatedwithbehavioralandpsychologicaloutcomes.\nThe following were genotyped according to procedures described pre-\nviously (53,54): a 40-basepair (bp) variable number tandem repeat\n(VNTR) polymorphism in the 3 untranslated region of the dopamine\ntransporter (SLC6A3), a 44-bp insertion/\ndeletion polymorphism\n(5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4),\nof the DRD4, and a 30-bp VNTR in the promoter of the MAOA gene.\nThe T479A substitution in the CYP2A6 gene, associated with nicotine\nmetabolism, was also genotyped in the same DNA samples, but this\ngenotype data were not used in this study.\narticles\ngenetics\nThe genotypes were tested for deviations from Hardy Weinberg Equi-\nlibrium (HWE). Deviations from HWE could indicate either a problem\nwith the genotyping assay or a true association with an outcome. To\nexamine the second hypothesis, we tested for deviations from HWE in\nthe overall data set, in the normal weight subset, the obese subset, and\nthe obese/overweight subset.\nBMI\nBMI was calculated based on height and weight (BMI = weight in\nkilograms/height in meters2) measured by Add Health staff during the\nin-home interviews at Wave II and Wave III. Height and weight were\nself-reported at Wave I and thus, analyses of BMI were restricted to\nWave II and III.\nSociodemographic variables\nCovariates included indicators of socioeconomic status (e.g., parental\nreported education reported by parents at Wave I), chronological age\nof participant at Wave III, and self-identified race/ethnicity. American\nIndians and Asians were excluded from the analyses because they were\nunderrepresented in the available data. Thus, our analyses only included\nAmerican whites, African Americans, and Hispanics.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (ver-\nsion 8.0) statistical software (55). SUDAAN allows for control of survey\ndesign effects of individuals clustered in sampling unit of school and\nstratification of geographic region. The specific genotypes were grouped\nfor analysis according to the extant literature with these candidate genes\nfied on gender. Two separate sets of multiple logistic regressions were\nconducted. In the first, regression was used to identify the variables\nwhich predicted obesity (BMI > 29.9) using normal weight (BMI =\n18.5\u00ad24.9) as a referent to identify genetic factors associated with the\nhighest level of risk. In the second, regression was used to predict over-\nweight + obese combined (BMI  25). This approach allowed for the\nidentification of any risk factors associated with above normal weight.\nParticipants who were underweight (<18.5; n = 47) were excluded. Each\npolymorphism was evaluated separately. Models included the interac-\ntion between the allele and either sex or race/ethnicity. Age, race, and\nparental education level were included as covariates. To clarify the\ninterpretation of significant interaction effects, stratified analyses were\nconducted and odds ratios were calculated when samples sizes permit-\nted. For stratified analyses where fewer than five individuals were repre-\nsented in a genotype category, the CLUMP program (58) was used with\n10,000 simulations to further verify a significant departure of observed\nvalues from expected values.\nLinear regression models were used to examine the change in BMI\nfrom Wave II to Wave III. Although Add Health did collect information\nregarding height and weight at Wave I (1 year before Wave II), the infor-\nmation was based on self-report. Thus, to reduce potential bias, a con-\nservative approach was taken by only looking at the change from Wave\nII to Wave III where height and weight were measured by study staff. The\noutcome measure for these analyses was based on a raw score change in\nBMI (as opposed to a z-score change) as has been recommended by Cole\net al. (59), and by Berkey and Colditz (60). Models included age, sex, self-\nreported race/ethnicity, and parental education as covariates.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays the overall socio-demographics by BMI cate-\ngory(normalweightvs.obesevs.overweight+obese).Bivariate\nchi square analyses revealed significant differences among BMI\ncategory for race/ethnicity, parental education and age (P <\n0.05), and a trend for gender (normal vs. overweight + obese,\nP = 0.07). Table 2 describes genotype frequencies overall and\nby BMI categories included in the analyses. Genotype distribu-\ntions in the normal weight BMI strata exhibited HWE (all Ps >\n0.05). However, the genotype distributions in the obese BMI\nstrata deviated from HWE for the SLC6A4 marker (P = 0.02).\nSimilarly, the genotype distributions in the overweight + obese\nBMI strata also deviated from HWE for the SLC6A4 marker\n(P = 0.009). As the genotype distributions in the larger, all\ninclusive data set generally met HWE, we do not believe that\ngenotyping errors contributed to the deviations from HWE\nthat we observed in the obese and overweight + obese strata.\nThe association between genotypes and obesity and over-\nweight + obese can be viewed in Table 3. No associations with\nobesityoroverweight+obesewerefoundforpolymorphismsin\nSLC6A3, DRD2, DRD4, or MAOA (women). Among men, the\nMAOA polymorphism was found to be associated with obesity\nand with overweight + obese. Among men, the prevalence of\nobesity and overweight + obese was significantly higher among\ncarriers of the low-activity variant of MAOA. Also among men\na significant gene by race/ethnicity interaction was observed\nfor MAOA for the normal vs. overweight + obese comparison\n(Table 4). The association between the low-activity variant and\nthe overweight + obese category was significant for whites and\nHispanics, but not for African Americans.\nA significant main effect for the 5HTTLPR polymorphism\nin the SLC6A4 gene was also observed (Table 3). The preva-\nlence of obesity and overweight + obese combined was sig-\nnificantly lower among carriers of the l variant compared with\nTable 1 Gender, ethnicity, parental education, and age by\nnormal weight, obese, and overweight + obese\nNormal\nweight Obese\nOverweight +\nobese\nN % N % N %\nGender\nEthnicity\nParental education level\n Less than high\n school\n High school or\n equivalent\naSignificant X2 comparison between obese vs. normal weight (P < 0.05).\n\nbSignificant X2 comparison between overweight + obese vs. normal weight\n(P < 0.05). cSignificant t-tests between obese vs. normal weight (P < 0.05).\n\ndSignificant t-tests between overweight + obese vs. normal weight (P < 0.05).\narticles\ngenetics\nindividuals homozygous for the s variant. Significant gene by\ngender interaction revealed that this pattern of greater obe\nsity and overweight + obesity among carriers of the s/s vari-\nant was significant for men, but not for women (see Table 4).\nSignificant gene by race/ethnicity interactions were also\nobserved for white men homozygotes of either allele of the\n5HTTLPR polymorphism, which were overrepresented in the\nobese and overweight + obese BMI categories (see Table 4).\nThe pattern was somewhat different for Hispanic men where\ns/s homozygotes or s/l heterozygotes were overrepresented\nin the obese and overweight + obese BMI categories (see\nTable 4). As can be seen in Table 4, the confidence intervals\nfor the association between the SLC6A4 gene and obesity and\noverweight + obesity are wide when the analysis is restricted\nto Hispanic men, indicating small cell counts for these com-\nparisons. To further verify a significant departure of observed\nvalues from expected values the CLUMP (58) program was\napplied to this subset. The permutation analyses indicated\nthat the genotype frequencies among obese and overweight\n+ obese combined differed significantly in comparison to\nthose in the normal weight group (Table 5). Also note that,\nas described above, the SLC6A4 polymorphism significantly\ndeviated from HWE in the obese and overweight + obese\nstrata, and this was confined to the non-Hispanic white ethnic\ngroup which was the largest ethnic sample.\nAnalyses also examined change in BMI from Wave II, when\nparticipants were on average 16.5 years of age, to Wave III,\nwhen participant were on average 22 years of age. The only\npolymorphism that was significantly associated with change\nin BMI was the 5HTTLPR polymorphism at the SLC6A4\nTable 2 Overall genotype frequencies and frequencies by\nnormal weight, obese, and overweight + obese\nTotal\nNormal\nweight Obese\nOverweight\n+ obese\nN f N f N f N f\nDAT\n At least one\nMAOA (men)\nMAOA (women)\nMAOA, monoamine oxidase A.\nTable 3 Odds ratio (OR),confidence interval (CI),and P values\nfor main effects modelsa and sex and ethnicity interactions\nNormal vs. obese\nNormal vs. overweight\n+ obese\nDAT\n DAT \u00d7 sex ns ns\n DAT \u00d7 ethnicity ns ns\n Any A1 vs.\n DRD2 \u00d7 sex ns ns\n ethnicity\nns ns\n DRD4 \u00d7 sex ns ns\n ethnicity\nns ns\nMAOA\n Women\n Low\n activity vs.\n both active\n ethnicity\nns ns\n Men\n Low activity\n vs. both\n active\n ethnicity\n Main effect\n of SLCA4b\n ethnicity\nMAOA, monoamine oxidase A; ns, non-significant.\naAll main effects models adjusted for sex, race, age, parental education level.\nbIndicates P value for main effect of gene in model not including interaction\nterms.\narticles\ngenetics\ngene (Table 6). 5HTTLPR s/s homozygotes demonstrated the\ngreatest change in BMI from Wave II to Wave III, an average\nincrease of 4.1 BMI units, compared to an increase of an aver-\nage 3.5 BMI units among l/l homozygotes and 3.4 BMI units\namong s/l heterozygotes (Table 6 and Figure 1).

Stratified analyses for MAOA among men indi-\ncated that the promoter VNTR was significantly associated with\noverweight + obese in white and in Hispanic men, as well.\nAuniquecontributionofthisstudyisapreviouslyun\nreported\nassociation between obesity and candidate gene SLC6A4 in a\nUS population-based sample. The findings of our study con-\nfirm findings from a recently published study demonstrating\nan association between the s allele of the SLC6A4 5HTTLPR\npolymorphism and overweight among a sample of Argentinean\nchildren and adolescents (61). They also extend these findings\nby providing evidence for association between overweight +\nobesity and the s allele 5HTTLPR homozygote in men of white\nrace and Hispanic ethnicity. The present findings regarding the\nassociation between SLC6A4 and BMI categories are consist-\nent with the putative role of serotonin on food craving and\nobesity (28,62) and the direction of the results are also consist-\nent with the hypothesized expression effects of the 5HTTLPR\npolymorphism. The s allele is believed to reduce the transcrip-\ntional activity of the promoter (63) and is associated with less\nserotonin transporter protein (63,64). An association between\nanxiety-related traits with a polymorphism in the serotonin\ntransporter gene regulatory region has been noted (63). Thus,\none potential hypothesis for the association between this gene\nand obesity may be a mediating effect of increased dietary\nintake as a means of affect regulation.\nFurther, the findings of this study regarding an association\nbetween MAOA and BMI are interesting in light of one family-\nbased study (41) and two recent large-scale association studies\n(40,65). Using the transmission disequilibrium test, evaluating\nthe degree to which parents transmit this gene to their obese\noffspring, Camarena et al. (41) found the low active variant to\nbe associated with obesity (41). Extending this in a large popu-\nlation-based study, Need et al. (40) found that European white\nwomen (Mean age = 47 years) carriers of the low active variant\nwere significantly more likely to be obese (BMI > 30). Ducci et al.\n(65) found a significant association between BMI and MAOA\ngenotype, with the low-activity allele associated with a higher\nBMI among a sample of primarily non-obese men participants\nwith and without a history of alcohol dependence (65).\nOur findings indicated some interesting potential gender\neffects. Gene by gender interactions indicated the relationship\nbetween gene (specifically, SLC6A4 and MAOA) and over-\nweight or overweight + obese were significant for men. Need\net al. observed an association between MAOA and categories\nof BMI among their women sample, whereas no association\nbetween MAOA and categories of BMI was noted in our sample\nof women. This may reflect an age related effect, as the mean age\nof women in our study was much younger (mean age of 22 years\nin our study vs. mean age of 48 in Need et al., study). Expression\nof MAOA is affected by ovarian hormones which can fluctu-\nate with age (66). It has been shown that ovarian steroids, par-\nticularly estrogen, can decrease MAOA expression, resulting\nin elevated serotonin levels (66,67). The degree to which these\npotential age-related effects represent a true effect will need to\nbe verified in other samples in a wider age range.\nDopamine has been associated with the reinforcement value\nof food (68,69) and variation in dopaminergic activity in the\nbrain has been associated with obesity (13). The association\nof the MAOA low activity VNTR variant and increased BMI\nfrom this study would be consistent, in part, with these obser-\nvations as MAOA is implicated in dopamine metabolism (40).\nHowever, we did not find that polymorphisms in the DRD2\nand DRD4 and the dopamine transporter were statistically sig-\nnificantly associated with BMI categories in this young adult\nsample. It is unlikely that these null results for the main effects\nmodels are a result of low statistical power, as many of the\ncell counts in these models for these dopamine-related genes\nwere of sufficient size and much larger than studies to date.\nNevertheless, there are several possible explanations. First, can-\ndidate gene studies of the TaqI A polymorphism at the DRD2\ngene have not been completely consistent, with some studies\nassociation (20\u00ad22,26). Second, the difference in samples with\nregard to age and country of origin also make it difficult to\ncompare our findings to other studies of dopamine candidate\ngenes. Finally, there was only a single polymorphism within\neach candidate gene which was available for analysis. The\nauthors only had access to the genotypes provided by the Add\nHealth study, and could not perform further genotyping on the\ndata set. It is possible that genetic variations in other parts of\nthese (or other) genes in the dopaminergic system are associ-\nated with obe\nsity in this population-based sample. However, it\nwill require future studies to further examine this hypothesis.\nThe trends observed between DRD4 presented in our study\nareconsistentwiththefindingsreportedbyGuoetal.(24)using\nthis same public-use data set. These investigators employed a\nsomewhat different analytic procedure using the complete\nsample of related and unrelated individuals and included data\nfrom the self-report of height and weight obtained through the\nAdd Health study at Wave I. These investigators found a signif-\nicant association between DRD4 and obesity among African\nAmericans and Hispanics. We chose to limit our analyses to\nunrelated individuals only, and we further limited our analy-\nsis using measured height and weight assessed during young\nadulthood to construct BMI categories. When we examined\nthe association between change in BMI and DRD4, we did find\nan association approaching significance (P = 0.07).\nWhile we are enthusiastic about the findings presented here,\ncaution is warranted in interpretation. Initial reports from\ncandidate gene studies, in general, may overestimate the effect\n(71) and modest yet significant effects are reported here. Also,\nwe did not apply a Bonferroni correction because many of the\nphenotypic tests were related and this would have resulted\nin an over-conservative correction. However, a large number\nof statistical comparisons were conducted which may have\npotentially inflated the risk of Type I error. Thus, replication\nis needed before definitive conclusions can be made about the\nrole of these genes on regulating weight and risk of obesity.\nAlso, future studies are planned to examine the interactions\narticles\ngenetics\nwith other psychological states and traits which may help to\nbetter explain these associations as some of the psychological\nstates overlap with risk of obesity. Of note, we did not find that\nthe associations that were present for Hispanics and American\nwhites were also present for African Americans in this sam-\nple. Furthermore, the association observed for whites between\nSLC6A4 and obesity did not exhibit the same pattern as it did\nfor Hispanics. These differences may represent the reduced\npower in the stratified model, genetic heterogeneity within the\nHispanic and African American groups, or both factors. This\nwill need to be further studied with larger sub-samples of non-\nwhite participants. Another limitation of the current study was\nthat other indicators of adiposity or body composition (e.g.,\nwaist circumference, skin fold measures) were not present in\nthe Add Health study. In general, BMI is a good proxy, but\nexamining the association between these candidate genes and\nother indicators of adiposity and body composition would\nstrengthen the findings. Also of note, these analyses did not\naccount for age of pubertal onset which is potentially impor-\ntant to the analyses of change in BMI; however, given that the\nmedian age at Wave II was 17 (Mean = 16.5), this may have\nhad little effect, as most participants would likely have been\npost-pubertal onset. Further, as described above, it would have\nbeen ideal to have additional candidate gene data available, and\nmultiple polymorphisms within the genes to test other hypoth-\nesis as well as evaluate the effects of population stratification.\nHowever, currently only a limited amount of genetic data are\navailable for analysis using this cohort.\nOur findings lend further support to the involvement of\ndopamine and serotonin regulation on energy balance (9). The\nresults underscore the need for additional research examining\nthe role of these systems on BMI and other energy-balance\nbehaviors (e.g., diet and physical activity). Additional work\nis needed to identify the potential complex gene by gene and\ngene by environment interactions that may further characte\nrize these main effects.\n"
