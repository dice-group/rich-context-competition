Studies have\nrevealed that women with endometriosis\nare at high risk for anxiety and depressive\nBecause the pathogenesis of DIE is still\nunclear10,11 and the European Society of\nHuman Reproduction and Embryology\nguidelines clearly state that no specific med-\nication with which to resolve the disease-\nrelated symptoms is available,12 complete\nlesion excision is usually performed and\nhas been shown to notably improve\npatients' quality of life.13,14 Thus, surgery\nis considered the first-line and gold stan-\ndard treatment for DIE.15,16 The surgical\nprocedure can be very complex because of\nthe high risk of bowel and urinary tract\ninvolvement in this disease.17 The most\nworrisome complication associated with\nthe surgical treatment of DIE is the devel-\nopment of a postoperative rectovaginal fis-\ntula (PRF), which is defined as an abnormal\nconnection between the rectum and\nvagina.18 The reported occurrence rate of\nPRF after surgical treatment of DIE\nwith PRF may require longer hospitaliza-\ntion, experience slower recovery to work,\nand have a higher risk of the need for mul-\ntiple surgical repairs.\nStudies of the risk factors for PRF have\nnot generated a consensus opinion to date,\nalthough it has been reported that a higher\nnumber of radical surgeries performed\nincreases the risk of PRF.2 However,\nwhich factors may truly contribute to\nPRF remains unclear.\nTherefore, the aim of the current study\nwas to explore the clinical characteristics of\nthis postoperative complication and analyze\nthe risk factors for PRF in patients with\nDIE in our single university-based tertiary\nhospital.\nMaterials and methods\nThis retrospective cohort study involved\n104 patients diagnosed with DIE from\nObstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of\nFudan University, Shanghai, China. This\nstudy was approved by the institutional\nethics board of our hospital. All patients\nwho participated in the study provided\nverbal informed consent.\nThe patients' medical records were\nreviewed to obtain data on their presurgical\ntreatments and surgical information, demo-\ngraphics, body mass index (BMI), preoper-\native and postoperative visual analogue\nscale (VAS) score, and recovery\ninformation.\nPreoperative assessment\nRecords of the patients' rectovaginal exam-\nination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and\npelvic magnetic resonance imaging findings\nwere collected to assess the extension of the\nDIE lesions. Colonoscopy was performed\nin selected patients with severe bowel symp-\ntoms such as cyclic constipation, dyschezia,\nor hematochezia.\nDecisions regarding operations were\nmade cautiously and involved the whole\nmedical team, including gynecologic, gas-\ntrointestinal, and urological surgeons.\nBecause no standard criteria have been\nestablished, the choice of the surgical tech-\nnique depended on the surgeons' experience\nand patients' preference. Generally, both\npatients and doctors preferred the least\naggressive surgery that might remove most\nof the lesion.\nSurgical procedure\nThe operative route was either laparoscopy\nor laparotomy according to the consensus of\nthe whole medical team. The different surgi-\ncal techniques used were as followings:20\n1. Simple lesion cut (SLC): superficial shav-\ning, excision, or shaving of serosal and\nsubserosal bowel endometriosis without\nopening of the bowel wall.\n2. Full-thickness disc excision (FDE): exci-\nsion of bowel endometriosis with a small\nopening followed by closure of the bowel\nwall.\n3. Bowel resection and anastomosis (BRA):\nresection of a bowel segment affected by\nendometriosis followed by stapling\ntogether of the two remaining ends.\n4. Ileostomy: resection of a bowel segment\nfollowed by attachment of the small\nintestine to the abdominal wall to\nbypass the large intestine.\nDiagnosis of DIE\nThe diagnosis of DIE was confirmed both\nclinically and pathologically based on the\nfollowing criteria: 1) typical symptoms\n(cyclic pelvic pain, infertility, etc.) and a\nsuspicious nodule with tenderness found\non physical examination, 2) a blue or\nbrown lesion infiltrating >5 mm beneath\nthe peritoneum as observed by at least\ntwo experienced surgeons during the sur-\ngery, and 3) confirmation of the diagnosis\nof endometriosis by two independent gyne-\ncological pathologists (N.Y. and Z.X.).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with\nSPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM Corp.,\nArmonk, NY, USA), and P value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nStudent's t test was performed for continu-\nous variables, and the chi-square test (or\nFisher's exact test when appropriate) was\nperformed for categorical variables.\nResults\nClinical characteristics\nThe demographic characteristics, symp-\ntoms, and presurgical treatment of the 104\npatients are summarized in Table 1.

Laparoscopic surgery was per-\nformed, and a 4-cm lesion was found at the\ncul-de-sac, which also infiltrated the ureter.\nlaparoscopic superficial excision was per-\nformed, and a 2- \u00c2 1- \u00c2 1-cm lesion was\nleft according to the patient's desire to pre-\nserve the integrity of the intestine.

Colonoscopy was performed before\nsurgery this time. A 5- \u00c2 6-cm mass with an\nanabrotic surface was identified 5 cm from\nthe anus. The pathologic examination con-\nfirmed chronic inflammation. Because of\ntechnical difficulties, laparoscopic surgery\nwas converted to open surgery. The lesion\nwas 7 cm in size, located at the cul-de-sac as\nwell as the bilateral ureterosacral ligaments,\nand infiltrated all layers of the sigmoid\ncolon. Thus, BRA was performed, and a\nscleroid drainage tube was placed in the\npelvic cavity. Five days postoperatively,\nthe patient felt feces partially exiting the\nvagina and developed a fever. A temporary\ncolostomy was established for 3 months,\nand the patient completely recovered.\nCase 4: A 47-year-old woman (gravidity\n3, parity 1) had a >10-year history of dys-\nmenorrhea and had experienced dyschezia\nfor most recent 6 months.

To obtain long-term outcomes\nof pain relief and fertility, surgery is still\nregarded as the first-choice treatment for\nDIE,22 especially for endometriosis that\nHowever, postoperative complications\nare a great challenge for surgeons and can\nbe divided into two categories: major and\nminor complications. The former include\nrectovaginal fistulas, bowel leakage, severe\ninfection, and large blood loss volumes,\nwhile the latter include temporary intestinal\nand urinary dysfunction and superficial\ninfection.25 Most patients with PRF experi-\nence malodorous vaginal discharge, fever,\nand lower abdominal pain, which slow\ntheir postoperative recovery while increas-\ning their costs and hospitalization dura-\ntion.26 The reported incidence of PRF\namong patients who have undergone DIE-\nrelated surgeries ranges from 2.9% to\ngical treatment of DIE in our single tertiary\nhospital developed PRF from 5 to 16 days\npostoperatively.\nBelghiti et al.29 found that DIE lesions\nmore commonly involved the vagina in\npatients with than without PRF [8/9\nP<0.001]. In the present study, all lesions\nwere located at least in the cul-de-sac. For\nthose who developed PRF, the rectum and/\nor ureter was also involved, while 72 of 99\n(72.7%) patients without PRF had lesions\nlocated only in the cul-de-sac (P \u00bc 0.004).\nNot enough evidence is yet available to con-\nclude that the location of DIE lesions is an\nindependent risk factor for PRF.\nTarjanne et al.30 found that among\npatients with DIE who underwent colorec-\ntal resection, more major complications\noccurred in patients with nodules of >4\nrespectively; P \u00bc 0.04].

Mohr et al.37\nreported that the complication rate of shav-\ning, disc excision, and segmental resection\nshowed similar results. However, Roman\net al.40 reported more postoperative compli-\ncations in the conservative than radical sur-\nsimilar findings for patients undergoing disc\nresection; they found that segmental resec-\ntion may not increase the risk of\n(17.2%), respectively]. In our cohort, the\nunivariate analysis revealed that conserva-\ntive surgery was associated with a lower risk\nBelghiti et al.28 reported that colpectomy\nmight increase the incidence of PRF\nbecause the proportion of patients who\nunderwent colpectomy was higher in the\nPRF group than in the control [8/9 (89%)\nthe present study, we found that 4 of 5\n(80.0%) patients with PRF had undergone\npatients without PRF had undergone this\nsurgery. Although the difference between\nthe two groups was not statistically signifi-\ncant, we still suggest that colpectomy\nshould be executed with great caution in\nhighly selected patients.\nwith DIE developed PRF and that both of\nthem had undergone concomitant vaginal\nand rectal resection without protective\nileostomy. Whether a protective ileostomy\ncan truly prevent PRF remains unclear.\nMoreover, a temporary colostomy would\nbe very invasive for patients with benign\ndisease.42 Milone et al.43 conducted a pro-\nspective multicenter case-control study\ninvolving 90 patients with bowel DIE.\nMore ileostomies were performed in\npatients without than with complications\nstudy, we found that only one of four\npatients who underwent BRA with prophy-\nlactic ileostomy developed PRF.\nSome scholars have mentioned that the\nsurgeon's experience may influence the\ndevelopment of complications both intrao-\nperatively and postoperatively. Dubernard\npatients developed postoperative complica-\ntions, which was a relatively higher rate\nthan in other studies. They considered\nthat a lack of experience in laparoscopic\ncolorectal resection for endometriosis was\na possible reason for this high rate.\nActually, when treating DIE, a multidisci-\nplinary team comprising gynecologists,\nurologists, and general surgeons should\nwork together in a specific center.44,45\nRadiological assessment is also quite\nimportant to assess the disease.46\nFortunately, all patients in our cohort\nunderwent their operations by the same sur-\ngical team, which might have reduced bias\nand allowed for consistency in the diagnosis\nand management of DIE.\nIn summary, we suggest great caution in\ntreating patients with large DIE lesions.\nBecause of its retrospective nature, this\nstudy has some inherent limitations such\nas recall bias, selection bias, and others. A\nprospective study with more patients will be\nnecessary to draw more solid conclusions.\nMoreover, specialized centers with multidis-\nciplinary collaboration involving radiolog-\nists and a surgical team with an experienced\nurological surgeon and/or gastrointestinal\nsurgeon would be quite essential in treating\npatients with DIE. Additionally, adequate\ncommunication before surgery should be\nensured, and patients should be fully\ninformed of the risk of potentially severe\ncomplications such as PRF.\nAuthors' note\nYunxi Zheng contributed to performance\nof the clinical study and participated in\nthe manuscript writing.
