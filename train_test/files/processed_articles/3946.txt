Classically, men attend most to cues associated\nwith fertility, whereas women, to a much greater degree than men, attend to cues associated\nwith resource accrual (Buss, 1994). Much behavioral data exist to provide support for these\nhypotheses. In a previous study (Melnyk and McCord, 2012) the authors examined hair\ncolor as a potential determinant of male judgments of female attractiveness, using eye-\ntracker technology to assess male gaze patterns. An unexpected finding was that men\ntended to differ notably from each other with regard to gaze pattern, although each\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nindividual male participant tended to utilize the same gaze pattern across different female\nimages. The present study was designed to investigate this serendipitous finding.\nAlthough a full review of the mate attraction literature is beyond the scope of the\ncurrent paper, key findings are relevant. Thornhill and Grammer (1999) credit\nWestermarck (1921) with first linking attractiveness determinants to evolutionary\nfunctionality. He proposed that judgments of sexual attraction are species typical and\nevolved by natural selection, as attractiveness gives visual cues to health and reproductive\nfitness. The same suggestion was proposed by Ellis (1926), focusing on the evolutionary\nfunction of the perception of attractiveness. Symons (1979) also stressed the association of\nhealth and fertility with cues that we find attractive. Symons documented that, as predicted\nby sexual selection theory, men pay more attention to physical attractiveness than do\nwomen. Buss's (1994) large cross-cultural studies of 37 countries assessing the importance\nplaced on the attractiveness of a partner is a landmark in this literature. In all cases men\nplaced more value on physical appearance in a potential mate than women did.\nTwo broad features that span much of this literature are youth and beauty. Both\nfunction as core aspects of female attractiveness, and both have been clearly linked to\nnumerous biological markers of health, fertility, and reproductive value. Cross-cultural\nstudies show that, to a near-universal degree, men prefer women who are younger than\nthemselves (e.g., Buss, 1994; Symons, 1995). A more precise evolutionary prediction is\nthat men prefer not just younger women, but women closer to the age of maximum fertility,\nthe early to mid-20's. Kenrick, Keefe, Gabrielidis, and Cornelius (1996) explored this\nconcept by gathering data from teenagers. Their data show that adolescent males actually\npreferred females in their 20s, who in some cases were up to seven years older than the\nmale participant.\nWith regard to beauty, many variables have been examined, including body size and\nshape, facial femininity and symmetry, skin tone and clarity, and length and quality of hair.\nAs noted above, a full review of all research in this very active field is beyond the scope of\nthis introduction, but key findings in areas most relevant to the current project will be\nsummarized below.\nDevendra Singh has contributed significantly to the evolutionary psychology\nliterature with a series of studies on women's waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (Singh, 1993;\nSingh and Randall, 2007; Singh and Young, 1995). Reproductively healthy women have a\nWHR between .67 and .80 (whereas healthy men have ratio in the range of .85 - .95).\nDiseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart-attack, stroke, and gallbladder disorders have\nbeen shown to have a link to fat distribution in regards to the WHR, more so than the actual\namount of fat, which may help to explain the signal value of this particular index. In\naddition to indicating possible health problems, WHR has also been empirically linked to\nfertility factors. In one study, researchers found that women with a low WHR (indicated by\na small waist) and relatively large breasts had 26 percent higher levels of estradiol, an\novarian hormone that is a good predictor of fertility (Jasienska, Ziomkiewicz, Ellison,\nLipson, and Thune, 2004). In another fascinating study, even blind men were able to\ndemonstrate a preference for lower WHR by feeling mannequins (Karremans, Frankenhuis,\nand Arons, 2010). Across studies, men rated women with an average WHR of .70 as more\nattractive than either smaller or larger values.\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nIn recent years researchers have begun to question the specificity of WHR as an\nindicator of attractiveness. A number of studies suggest Body Mass Index (BMI) may be a\ngreater predictor of attractiveness than WHR. Results have shown that WHR and BMI are\npositively correlated, as WHR goes up so does BMI; however, when statistically\ncontrolling for BMI, WHR was not a significant determinant of attractiveness (Cornelissen,\nTovee, and Bateson, 2009). These results suggest WHR is only important because it gives\ninformation about BMI. Similar results were found in an eye-tracking study that found gaze\npatterns fixated on the waist and breasts, but not on hips or pelvis (Cornelissen, Hancock, et\nal., 2009). Rilling et al. (2009) found that both BMI and WHR were significant predictors\nof attractiveness; however, waist circumference was an even greater predictor. There is still\nmuch research needed to distinguish which of these factors plays the bigger role or what\nother variables may be relevant.\nSkin quality is another important factor as it not only gives an indication towards\ncurrent health, but also acts as a part time record of previous health. (Sugiyama, 2005).\nSkin quality has been linked to facial attractiveness (Fink and Neave, 2005). Homogeneous\nskin is seen as younger and more attractive than splotchy skin (Fink, Grammer, and Matts,\n2006; Fink et al., 2008). Clear and unblemished skin shows the absence of parasites, skin\ndamaging diseases, and possibly good genes to heal without infection (Singh and Bronstad,\n1997). Faces figure prominently in attractiveness research. A more feminine face is seen as\nmore attractive, defined by features including full lips, relatively larger eyes, thinner jaws,\nsmall chin, high cheekbones, and a relatively short distance between mouth and jaw\n(Gangestad and Scheyd, 2005). Feminine faces are likely to be an attractiveness\ndeterminant for two reasons. First, as women age their facial features tend to become less\nfeminine; thus, facial femininity offers cues regarding youth. Second, facial femininity is\nalso linked to higher levels of estrogen, the ovarian hormone linked to fertility (Schaefer et\nal., 2006). Meta-analysis reveals that facial femininity is one of the most powerful cues to a\nwoman's attractiveness (Rhodes, 2006). Other cues offered by the face involve symmetry,\nhypothesized as an indicator of developmental stability, a signal of \"good genes\" and the\ncapacity to withstand environmental challenges. Symmetrical faces have been positively\ncorrelated with judgments of attractiveness compared to non-symmetrical faces (Fink,\nNot all researchers agree on the importance of facial symmetry. Derek Hodgson\n(2009) suggests that an attraction to symmetry is not a sexually driven desire, but a\nperceptual bias. He argues that while symmetrical faces are perceived as attractive, they are\nnot reliable cues to an individual's actual quality of health.\nThe length and quality of hair is yet another cue that can be read when assessing a\nwoman's attractiveness. A study was conducted interviewing 230 women at various public\nlocations about their age, subjective health, and relationship status. Researchers also\ncollected measures for hair length, and hair quality (Hinsz, Matz, and Patience, 2001). Hair\nlength and quality were strong cues to youth. Younger women tend to have longer hair than\nolder women; furthermore, observers' judgments of the quality of women's hair were also\npositively correlated with women's subjective judgments of their own health. Fink, Neuser,\nDeloux, Roeder, and Matts (2013) found that healthy hair was rated as younger, healthier,\nand more attractive than damaged hair. Hair can also significantly increase or alter female\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nfacial attractiveness.\nWith the increasingly widespread availability of eye-tracker technology, these\nevolutionary predictions may be tested in more precise ways and at a deeper level. Whereas\neye-tracking has existed in some form for more than 100 years, only within the past decade\nhas this technology been applied to evolutionary psychology and the study of determinants\nof attractiveness.\nRecent research has indicated that both men and women have a higher number of\nfixations and longer viewing times when viewing erotic versus non-erotic stimuli (Lykins,\nMeana, and Strauss, 2008). Similarly, heterosexual males pay more attention to adult\nfemales than to adult males or to children of either sex (Fromberger et al., 2011). Hall,\nHogue, and Guo (2011) had male participants view pictures of women ranging in age from\nbirth to 60. Men exhibited more fixations and longer overall gaze time when viewing 20-\nyear-old women as compared to any other age group, consistent with evolutionary\npredictions regarding peak fertility.\nA number of recent studies have used eye-tracking to explore more specific\ndeterminants of attractiveness. Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, and Miltner (2008) reported\nthat both male and female observers gazed primarily at people's faces. After initial scan of\nthe face, men then gazed longer at women's breasts, whereas women gazed at men's legs.\nSimilar results had been reported early by researchers using sexually explicit stimuli (Rupp\nAs noted above, female WHR has been associated frequently with attractiveness\nratings. Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater, and Dixson (2011) used eye-tracker technology to\nexplore this common finding. Men viewed frontal view images of the same woman,\ncomputer-morphed to vary her WHR (.7 or .9) and breast size (small, medium, large). Both\nbreasts and hips received more first-fixations than any other body region. Men gazed longer\nat breasts than at any other region, but, consistent with prevailing literature, they rated the\n.7 WHR as most attractive, independent of breast size. Cornelissen, Hancock et al. (2009)\nconducted an eye-tracker study to address the distinction between WHR and overall body\nfat (BMI) in attractiveness judgments. They used three different groups of raters: the first\nwas asked to judge attractiveness, the second to judge WHR, and the third to judge BMI.\nThe fixation patterns for the attractiveness group were very similar to those of the BMI\ngroup, and different from the WHR group. This finding adds to a growing literature that\nsuggests BMI, rather than WHR per se, is the key issue in rating female attractiveness. The\nCornelissen, Hancock et al. study also serves as a clear example of how eye-tracker\ntechnology can help to test competing hypotheses in evolutionary psychology.\nIn a previous study (Melnyk and McCord, 2012), the current authors explored the\nhypothesis that blonde hair was a signal of youth, predicting that heterosexual male\nparticipants would gaze at hair earlier, and for a higher proportion of total time, with\nblonde models, compared to brown-haired, black-haired, or red-haired models. However,\nno differences in predicted eye-tracking variables were found. Observation of participants\nduring the session, confirmed by subsequent data analysis, indicated that a high level of\nindividual variation occurred on each of the eye-tracker metrics. Statistically, then, the\nwithin-group variance overshadowed any mean differences between models that might\nhave been found. The present study was designed to follow up on this unexpected finding.\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nSpecifically, we re-examined our data with regard to the possibility that \"types\" of gaze\npatterns might exist in a group of male participants. Our informal observation was that each\nparticipant appeared to exhibit a consistent strategy of gaze across models, regardless of\nexperimental condition. We wondered if there might be systematic patterns shared by\nclusters of men.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nSixty male participants were recruited for this study from the Department of\nPsychology human subject pool at a regional comprehensive state university in the rural\nand 80% indicated their ethnicity as White (11.67% African American, 5% Multiracial,\n1.67% Native American, 1.67% Asian). The last item on the brief demographics\nquestionnaire asked if the participant was romantically attracted to women; this was\nintended as an exclusion criterion, but no participants answered negatively.\nMaterials and apparatus\nThe study was conducted using a Tobii TX 300 Eye Tracker to measure various\naspects of eye movement (300 Hz gaze capture frequency). The eye-tracking device looks\nvery similar to a large computer display screen, and therefore the eye-tracking hardware is\nnot readily apparent to participants. The device captures eye position remotely with\ncameras embedded in a module below the display screen, which is used to present\ndistance for the device was 66 cm. We used a velocity-threshold fixation identification\nalgorithm provided with the Tobii Studio software to classify eye gaze points as either\nbelonging to a fixation or a saccade (Komogortsev, Gobert, Jayarathna, Koh, and Gowda,\n2010; Salvucci and Goldberg, 2000). In our application of the algorithm, gaze samples\nwere classified as belonging to a fixation if the velocity of the movement to the gaze point\nwas less than or equal to 30 degrees/sec, a value that typically provides good results for\npsychological research (Olsen and Matos, 2012). The eye-tracking system provides a\nsoftware reading of the sampling accuracy rate for each participant (i.e., the percent of gaze\nsamples that provide adequate data to identify the position of left and right eye gaze\npoints). We used a threshold of 80% sampling accuracy to retain subject data for further\nanalysis, a standard setting for eye-tracker systems without head restraint (Poynter, Barber,\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited through the University's research pool. All students in\ngeneral psychology have the option of participating in experiments within the department\nor, alternatively, writing a research paper on a psychological topic of their choosing. Since\nthe paper is a viable option that some students do choose, no one was coerced to participate\nin this study.\nParticipants arrived for the study in groups and completed a brief demographic\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nquestionnaire. They were then tested individually in the eye-tracker lab. Once seated, the\neye-tracker was calibrated for the specific participant, who then viewed a series of\nphotographic images of female models (full body, fully dressed). The original study\nutilized four different females, with hair color systematically varied by computer-morphing\nacross models. The models were rated first for attractiveness and, in a second series of\nviewing, for estimated age. The present analysis utilized only the attractiveness data, and\nfor only the first model. Participants viewed all four models, each with a varying\nrandomized hair color, since the original study used hair color as a variable. Representation\nof hair color was also controlled for so at the end of the 60 participants each model had\nbeen shown an equal amount of times in each hair color.\nAnalyses\nOur general hypothesis was that male subjects may be meaningfully grouped into\ncategories based on eye-gaze patterns when viewing female models. This hypothesis was\ntested using latent class analysis (Mplus; Muthen and Muthen, 2010), with key \"areas of\ninterest\" (AOIs) serving as grouping variables. The eye-tracker device allows the\nresearcher to predefine specific AOIs on which eye-tracking variables are based. In this\nstudy, AOIs were: hair, face, breasts, waist, hips, and full picture acting as a total value.\nSpecifically, grouping variables for the latent class analyses were defined as the amount of\ngaze time spent on each of the first five AOIs expressed as a percentage of total time.\nResults\nWe ran 1-, 2-, and 3-class analyses and tested for best model fit (see Table 1). The\nstatistical indices clearly revealed that a 2-class solution fit the data best. Specifically, the\nLRT value for the 2-class solution indicated that it was statistically superior to a 1-class\nsolution, and the LRT for the 3-class solution was not significantly better than that for the\n2-class solution. The 2-class solution provided an excellent fit to the data with the entropy\nvalue being relatively close to 1.00 (entropy = .866) and all mean posterior probabilities\nbeing larger than .70 (see Table 2). Approximately 70% of respondents were in class 1 and\n30% in class 2. We then had Mplus calculate probable class membership for each\nparticipant, forming two groups. A MANOVA was conducted to examine group\ndifferences on all five dependent variables as a group, followed by univariate analyses for\neta square = .734), indicating that the five dependent variables differed overall between the\ntwo groups. Univariate tests indicated that the groups did not differ significantly with\nregard to the hair AOI, but they differed significantly on all of the other four dependent\nvariables (see Table 3 for means and mean-difference test results). Class 1 males exhibited\na strong orientation toward face, with only minimal gaze time at other AOIs, whereas Class\n2 males, while still spending the majority of gaze time on face, distributed time much more\nevenly among the other AOIs. Figures 1a and 1b provide examples of individual subjects'\ntracking data for each class.\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nTable 1.

Latent class analysis revealed that the data were best described by\ntwo classes of subjects. Class 1 subjects (\"face only\") focused almost exclusively on the\nfacial area when making attractiveness judgments, whereas Class 2 subjects also relied\nheavily on facial features, but to a lesser extent than Class 1 subjects, including other areas\nof interest as well. The overall dominance of facial gazing in both groups is consistent with\nthe body of literature on mate attraction (e. g., Rhodes, 2006). Despite the literature on hair\nlength and quality as a predictor of youth and attractiveness, hair was the only area of\ninterest on which the two latent classes did not predict youth and attractiveness. It is\npossible that tampering with the models' hair colors may have had an effect; however, in\ndebriefing, none of the participants indicated knowledge of tampering with the hair, and\nmost seemed rather surprised by the fact when told.\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nFigure 1. Typical gaze pattern for (a) Class 1: \"face only\" and (b) Class 2: \"face plus\"\na. b.\nThe systematic gaze pattern differences revealed in this analysis are highly relevant\nto evolutionary psychological research, and possibly to researchers in other areas who\nemploy eye-tracker technology. This source of individual differences raises the possibility\nof Type II error, failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The\nsystematic variation among subjects is treated statistically as error variance, lowering\nstatistical power. Isolating systematic individual differences in gaze pattern may allow\nresearchers to quantify it, and perhaps use pattern groupings as covariates, in order to\nincrease the statistical power of the design.\nLimitations of the current study include the low to modest sample size (60) and the\ngeneral homogeneity of the sample (all college males taking introductory psychology at a\nrural state university). Latent class analysis with larger and more diverse samples may well\nidentify more and/or different gaze patterns. Future research should, thus, include larger\nsamples, and perhaps utilize a larger number of AOIs.\nGaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness\nA key issue is the nature of the stimulus material. Assuming that our findings do, in\nfact, generalize meaningfully, to what extent would the identified gaze patterns emerge\nwith different stimuli? Using erotic stimuli, we would certainly expect variations in gaze\npatterns overall, but would latent classes of gaze pattern emerge? Similarly, using non-\nsexual stimuli, such as landscapes or other pictures, with tasks totally different from rating\nattractiveness (or age, etc.), would systematic clusters of individual differences in gaze\npattern occur?\nThe current findings should be seen as preliminary, but researchers working with\neye-tracker technology should certainly take note of the differential gaze patterns identified\nhere. These results are especially relevant with regard to evolutionary psychological\nresearch.\n"
