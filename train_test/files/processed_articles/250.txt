This article explores whether the formal home health care (HHC) market is equitable or manifests un-\nexplained racial disparities in use.\nMethods. The database is the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey. We estimate logit regression models with a race\ndummy variable, race interaction terms, and stratification by race. We apply the Oaxaca decomposition technique to\nquantify whether the observed racial gap in formal HHC use is explained by racial differences in predisposing, enabling,\nneed, and environmental characteristics.\nResults. We find numerous unique racial patterns in HHC use. Blacks with diabetes and low income have higher\nprobabilities of HHC use than their White counterparts. Black older persons have a 25% higher chance of using HHC than\nWhites. Our Oaxaca analysis indicates that racial differences in predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental\ncharacteristics account for the racial gap in use of HHC.\nDiscussion. We find that the HHC market is equitable, enhancing availability, aceptability, and accessibility of care for\nolder Black persons. Thus, the racial differences that we find are not racial disparities.\nDISTINCT racial patterns in older persons' use of both\ninstitutional and community-based health care services\nare well documented (Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kington, &\nAndersen, 1998). In this article, we explore whether formal\nhome health care (HHC) use among older persons varies by\nrace, and if so, then we seek to explain why this differential use\noccurs. We assess the use of HHC as an integral part of\ncommunity health care rather than as one component of the\nspectrum of long-term care, as is done by Wallace and\nthe context of the broader literature of racial differences in\ncommunity care to highlight that this market differs from other\nalternatives. Thus, discussion of racial patterns of use for\nalternative types of community health care provides important\ncontextual background for our focus on HHC.\nOwing partly to limited financial access to nursing homes\nand cultural preferences (Falcone & Broyles, 1994), older\nBlacks are less likely to use nursing homes and more likely to\nlive in the community with chronic conditions and disabilities\nthat exceed those of older Whites (Wallace et al., 1998; White-\nMeans, 2000). However, lower use of skilled nursing facilities\nby Blacks is not counterbalanced by higher use of HHC\nservices (Cagney & Agree, 1999). Further, noninstitutionalized\nolder disabled Blacks are less likely to use other community-\nbased services such physician services and prescription\nmedications (White-Means, 2000). Differential use of in-home\nassistive devices is also found, with Whites more likely to use\nhome modification devices and Blacks more likely to use\nportable devices (Rubin & White-Means, 2001).\nWhat explains these distinct racial patterns in health services\nuse? Racial differences in physician services use and prescription\nmedication are not fully explained by racial differences in average\nincome or socioeconomic or health characteristics (White-Means,\nMeans, 2000) note that racial differences are explained by three\nfactors: availability, accessibility, and acceptability. Problems of\navailability arise from the lack of close geographic proximity to\nservices and/or segregation in the use of services. Lack of\nknowledge about available services and limited referrals to\nauxiliary services lead to gaps in accessibility. Patient dissatis-\nfaction, culturally insensitive care, and unfavorable provider\u00ad\npatient interactions lead to problems of acceptability.\nThe Institute of Medicine (2002) distinguishes between racial\ndifferences and disparities. It reports that some racial differences\nin health care use can be expected and are acceptable, including\ndifferences due to clinical need, patient preferences, and the\nappropriateness of particular interventions. But if differences\nare due to characteristics of the health care system, provider\ndiscrimination, or incorrect or deficient patient information, then\nthese differences are considered racial disparities in care. Thus,\ndifferences in use, reflecting such factors as stereotyping, biases,\nand uncertainty regarding treatment efficacy by race, limited\nsupplies of racial/ethnic minority health care providers, and poor\npatient\u00adprovider communication and trust, are seen as dispar-\nities. We seek to determine whether the racial differences in HHC\nuse are acceptable differences (and thus equitable) or actually\nreflect disparities, as defined by the Institute of Medicine. If the\ndifferences found are disparities, then we would expect to find\ndivergences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability in\nHHC use. So, disparities are seen as differentials that are not\nexplained by either socioeconomic or health characteristics.\nWe define formal HHC as market-purchased services pro-\nvided in the patient's home, including both Medicare-financed\ncare associated with subacute care and community-based care\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nthat meets needs associated with activities of daily living (ADLs)\nand instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Our\ncomparison focuses on use versus nonuse of community-based\nHHC and whether the comparative use is equitable by race. The\ndichotomous dependent variable indicates whether an older\nBlack or White person who lives in the community uses HHC or\nnot. Nonusers of HHC may use informal care support or various\nalternate formal (purchased or market-supplied) health care\nservices or no care, as distinguished by Wallace et al. (1998),\nwho also explore nursing home users.\nWe hypothesize that HHC is an equitable market. If it\nachieves the three criteria of availability, accessibility, and\nacceptability, then this would suggest that HHC represents an\nequitable market. HHC is more available to the home bound\nthan other community-based care because it does not require\ntransportation (Rubin, White-Means, & Feagin, 2003). Acces-\nsibility is broadened by Medicare and by the relatively low\nprice of HHC. Medicare is the largest single HHC payer (about\ncovering HHC under Part A with no out-of-pocket charges and\nunder Part B with a $100 deductible. Other federal programs\nand Medicaid also pay for some HHC for the poor or medically\nculturally diverse workforce of HHC (35% are Black and\n10% Hispanic) may be more acceptable to diverse groups of\nolder persons than nonhome community-based care and may be\nperceived to be more culturally sensitive (Stone & Wiener,\n2001). As this low-paid workforce is economically disadvan-\ntaged, cultural and class barriers tend to be minimized.\nAdditionally, because of the relatively low start-up cost of\nagencies are owned by ethnic minorities and are more likely\nto serve communities where a higher proportion of ethnic\nData from national surveys tend to support the hypothesis of\nHHC as an equitable market. Indeed, Blacks are more likely to\nuse HHC than Whites (Mui & Burnette, 1994; Wallace et al.,\n1998). In contrast, regression analysis provides equivocal\nsupport for the role of race in increasing home health use.\nFreedman (1999) reports that non-Whites are significantly more\nlikely to use more HHC services and also to use them for longer\nterms. This higher intensity of use is associated with the greater\nlikelihood that Blacks postpone use and remain in the\ncommunity longer with chronic conditions (Cagney & Agree,\n1999). Although the coefficients are insignificant, Picone and\nWilson (1999) find higher Medicare home health agency use\nrates for Blacks, but they conclude that socioeconomic factors\nare not strong determinants compared to health status. Similarly,\nMiller and colleagues (1996), who do not find racial differences,\nfind that overall health and functional status, as well as\nMedicaid use, are primary predictors of service use. In contrast,\nWallace and colleagues (1998) note that African Americans are\nless likely than non-Latino Whites to use HHC, with HHC use\nmore likely for those of advanced age, women and single\nwomen, and those with more formal education, higher ADLs,\nstroke or heart conditions, low income, and Medicaid.\nResearch Questions\nThis study makes important contributions to a growing\nliterature on racial disparities in health care. The broad research\nobjective is to discover whether HHC provides an equitable\nhealth care market for Blacks. We determine empirically based\nanswers to two specific questions: (a) Are there distinct racial\npatterns in the use and determinants of use of HHC? (b) What is\nthe role of racial differences in need, predisposing conditions,\nenabling factors, and environmental factors in explaining\nobserved racial differences in HHC use?\nMETHODS\nData\nThe database is the 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS), a repeated panel survey designed to estimate chronic\ndisability status, functional problems, and institutionalization\nrates of older persons and their use of community-based\nin-home long-term care. The NLTCS provides nationally\nrepresentative data on the prevalence and patterns of functional\nlimitations, medical conditions, and recent medical problems\nfor Medicare-enrolled Americans aged 65 and older. It also\nincludes data on health services use, out-of-pocket expendi-\ntures, financial resources, and sociodemographic characteristics\nof older persons and their families. The 1994 NLTCS sample is\nthe fourth panel and includes living respondents from previous\npanels, despite constancy or changes in their disability level\nsupplemented with additional persons meeting the impaired\nstatus screening criteria from those who were previously\nscreened but not interviewed because at that time they did not\nmeet the impaired status criteria or reached age 65 after the\n1989 cutoff. The addition of an oversample of persons aged 95\nand older and a ``healthy'' sample not meeting the ``impaired''\nstatus criteria is unique to the 1994 NLTCS to enhance the\nnational representativeness of the data.\nDetailed questions are asked if persons meet screening\ncriteria for chronic ADL and IADL disability. However, many\ncarried over were previously chronically disabled but in 1994\nhad no ADL and/or IADL disabilities so that the sample shows\nmany people with no current ADLs or IADLs (Liu, Manton, &\nAragon, 2000). In contrast to some analyses (e.g., Liu et al.,\n2000), we include going outside as an ADL, because it is\ngrouped as an ADL in the NLTCS screener definitions. The\nNLTCS screener includes limitations in walking around inside\nand also going outside as ADLs; this ADL definition may result\nin relatively high prevalence of ADLs compared with IADLs.\nThe NLTCS includes 5,089 noninstitutionalized older per-\nsons in the detailed community interviews, of whom 4,740\nare non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks; our study\nsample includes 3,448 non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic\nBlack complete reporters (participants who provided data for all\nvariables). Similar to other survey research data, it has missing\ndata on family income (25%) and education (5%). Typically,\npersons at upper and lower incomes are least likely to report\nincome or education or both, resulting in patterns of data loss\nthat are nonrandom or systematic. Thus, the factors explaining\nthe likelihood of missing data are unrelated to the current\nstudy's exploration of the use of home care.\nWith a sample of complete reporters, we lose some statistical\npower, but this does not lead to inaccurate parameter estimates.\nFirst, statistical tests (Kromrey & Hines, 1994; Switzer, Roth,\n& Switzer, 1998) indicate that in cases where no more than\n30% of the data are missing (as is true for our sample), accurate\nparameter estimates are generated. Second, standard estimation\nprocedures restricted to the available observations yield valid\ninferences when the process that generates the missing data is\nindependent of the observed and unobserved data values\n(Rotnitzky & Wypij, 1994). As the data indicate that it is\nequally likely that Blacks and Whites have missing income data\nconfirmation of lack of bias in the parameter estimates using the\navailable observations. Thus, our analysis uses a sample of\nnon-Hispanic participants, as described in Table 1.\nAnalytic Design\nTo examine our first research question, we use three\nregression strategies: one with a race dummy variable, a second\nwith race interaction terms, and a third stratified by race. For the\nsecond research question, we apply the Oaxaca decomposition\ntechnique (Oaxaca, 1973), quantifying the percentage of the\nobserved racial gap in HHC use explained by racial differences.\nThis approach can contribute to our understanding because\nit questions whether an identified racial difference in home\nhealth use is what we should observe. As the health status of\ncommunity-residing older Blacks is significantly lower than that\nof Whites, the Oaxaca approach can help to answer whether we\nshould similarly find differences in home health use, with\nsignificantly higher use by Blacks, and if not, then why not?\nWe first estimate logistic regression models of HHC use, in-\ncluding a race dummy variable (Model I) and also race interaction\nterms (Model II). Next, we estimate logistic regressions of\nHHC use, stratified by race. The measure of HHC use is a\ndichtomous variable that equals 1 if paid home services are\nprovided by a helping organization (i.e., a home health agency or\nother business provider) and 0 otherwise. The NLTCS allows\nrespondents to define a helping organization as any organization\nthat provides in-home assistance, by describing their relationship\nto each in-home caregiver (or helper). If any caregiver was from\na helping organization, the respondent was coded as having\nOur choice of explanatory variables and conceptual frame-\nwork are guided by the Andersen model (1995) and previous\nresearch on HHC use. The Anderson model suggests that medical\nuse patterns are influenced by (a) predisposing conditions, (b)\nenabling factors, (c) environmental factors, and (d) need. Our\nmeasures of predisposing conditions are gender, age, marital\nstatus, education, and three quantifiable behavioral character-\nistics (whether the respondent currently smokes, exercises or\nplays sports regularly, and/or drinks alcoholic beverages one to\nthree times a month or less frequently; Cutler & Sheiner, 1994;\nOur measures of enabling factors are income, income squared,\nhealth insurance status (Medicare only, Medicare plus supple-\nments, or Medicare and Medicaid dual eligibility), number of\nadults living in the home, and use of home-delivered meals. We\nutilize income squared because previous research (White-\nMeans, 1997) documents a nonmonotonic relationship between\nhome health use and income. Home-delivered meals, part of\ncommunity-based nutrition programs in Title VII of the Older\nAmericans Act and part of community-based in-home care, may\nenhance nutrition and forestall institutionalization (Shi & Singh,\n1998). As home-delivered meals are not part of standard home\ncare and are not covered by Medicare, we view use of home-\ndelivered meals as an enabling factor that facilitates living in the\ncommunity.\nSimilar to previous research (Picone & Wilson, 1999), we\ninclude two proxy measures for geographic environment: urban\n(respondents living in cities of 50,000 or more residents or their\nsuburbs) and South. We also include measures of (a) whether\nthe state has a large Medicaid home- and community-based care\nwaiver program to reflect financial support for HHC services\n(Sloan, Picone, & Hoerger, 1997) and (b) the number of primary\ncare physicians per 1,000 residents by state to measure\nunderservice by physicians. State Medicaid waiver program\nfunding of HHC greater than the median of $142.4 million\nindicates a high level of funding, whereas funding less than or\nequal to $142.4 million indicates a low level of funding.\nWe examine HHC need with the five most prevalent chronic\nhealth conditions in the NLTCS and the ADLs and IADLs used\nas screening criteria in the NLTCS. The five chronic conditions\nare (a) joint diseases (rheumatism, paralysis, and arthritis),\n(b) diabetes, (c) heart conditions, (d) hypertension, and (e)\nbreathing disorders (bronchitis, pneumonia, flu, emphysema,\nand asthma). Although persons in the sample may have one or\nmore of these conditions, we enter each condition as a separate\nvariable in our regressions. The simultaneous impact of multiple\nconditions can be explored by summing the impacts of\nindividual conditions. We include the number of ADLs and\nIADLs as measures of disability (Cutler & Sheiner, 1994;\n1997). As data on severity of health conditions are unavailable\nin the NLTCS database, use of continuous measures of ADLs\nand IADLs provides an approach to a proxy for severity. The\nnine ADLs are limitations with eating, getting in and out of\nbed, getting in and out of chairs, walking around inside, going\noutside, dressing, bathing, toileting, and controlling bowel\nmovement/urination; and the seven IADLs are limitations with\nmeal preparation, laundry, light housework, grocery shopping,\nmanaging money, taking medicine, and making telephone calls.\nThe general form of our logit regression models is as follows:\nHHC \u00bc a \u00fe b1\nHS\nIADL \u00fe e \u00f01\u00de\nwhere DG \u00bc a vector of demograhic and sociostructural\nvariables (gender, age, marital status, education), PH \u00bc a vector\nof health behaviors (smoking, exercise, and alcohol consump-\ntion practices), EN \u00bc a vector of enabling factors (income,\nincome squared, health insurance status, number of potential\ncaregivers living in the home, and home-delivered meal use),\nEF \u00bc a vector of environmental factors (urban, South, under-\nservice by physicians, and residence in a state with high- or low-\nfunded Medicaid waiver programs), HS \u00bc a vector of chronic\nhealth conditions (joint diseases, diabetes, heart conditions,\nhypertension, and breathing disorders), ADL \u00bc number of\nADLs, IADL \u00bc number of IADLs, and e \u00bc error term.\nWe use three regression strategies to examine our first re-\nsearch question. We begin with regression models that include\nrace dummy variables (Model I) and race interaction terms\n(Model II), because they are most directly comparable with\nprevious research. If the race dummy variable is statistically\nsignificant, then race has a unique and independent influence on\nHHC use, given the role of other regression variables. The\ninteractive model explores whether the impact of other\nindependent variables on HHC use varies by race. Finally,\nusing models stratified by race, we explore differences in\nestimated b coefficients and marginals (to measure impact of\nchange in the independent variable on the probability of HHC\nuse) for Blacks and Whites. We seek to determine whether\nindependent variables impact HHC use differently for those of\ndifferent races. We explore whether factors found significant\nin the unstratified data are significant in the stratified\nmodels and whether they are significant for both Blacks and\nWhites.\nTable 1.

If the variables included in our\nmodel do not fully account for racial differences in HHC use,\nthen other nonmeasured factors are assumed to account for\nthese differences. A priori, we expect Blacks' relatively lower\nhealth levels to be associated with greater HHC use compared\nwith Whites. We also predict that the magnitude of the racial\ngap in HHC use directly corresponds with the size of the racial\ngap in variables included in the model.\nOur methodology for the second research question is\napplication of the Oaxaca decomposition technique. The\nOaxaca technique is used to quantify the percentage of the\nobserved racial gap in HHC use explained by racial differences\nin the predisposing, enabling, need, and measured environ-\nmental characteristics. This technique is a standard approach in\nlabor economics to determine the extent of wage discrimina-\ntion. It was originally applied to log-linear models of wage\ncompensation and later to nonlinear logit, probit, and bivariate\nprobit discrimination models (Hinks & Watson, 2001; Mo-\nhanty, 2002). With use of this technique, the total racial gap\nin HHC use is the difference in the probability that Whites\nand Blacks use HHC services: (PW\n). PW\nis equal\nto F(Xw, \u00dfw) \u00c0 F(Xb, \u00dfb), where \u00dfw and \u00dfb \u00bc regression\ncoefficients for Whites and Blacks, Xw and Xb \u00bc characteristics\nof Whites and Blacks, and F \u00bc the cumulative logistic prob-\nability function: 1/[1 \u00fe e\u00c0(a\u00febXi)]. The total gap emphasized in\nthe Oaxaca technique can also be expressed as\n\u00bdF\u00f0Xw; \u00dfw\u00de \u00c0 F\u00f0Xb; \u00dfw\u00de \u00fe \u00bdF\u00f0Xb; \u00dfw\u00de \u00c0 F\u00f0Xb; \u00dfb\u00de : \u00f02\u00de\nThe first term of the above equation measures the gap in the\nprobability of HHC use that is explained by racial differences in\ncharacteristics, that is, acceptable differences in use. The gap\nexplained by racial differences uses the regression coefficients\nfor Whites and examines how the probability of HHC use\nvaries when these regression coefficients are paired with the\ncharacteristics of Whites versus the characteristics of Blacks.\nThe unexplained gap (i.e., disparity) is the difference in the\nprobability of use of HHC by Blacks assuming their own\ncharacteristics (Xb) and using the regression coefficients of\nBlacks (\u00dfb) and the probability of use of HHC by Blacks\nassuming their own characteristics and the coefficients (\u00dfw) of\nWhites.\nIf unexplained differences in service use are found, they may\nbe due to either unmeasured demand side or supply side factors,\nincluding racial differences in the knowledge about or\npreferences for HHC use, barriers to formal medical care, or\npossibly discrimination in the provision of HHC (i.e., factors in\nthe health delivery system that influence accessibility, avail-\nability, and acceptablity of services). If the Oaxaca technique\nreveals unexplained differences in services use, then an\nimportant next step of investigation would be to seek data\nsources that allow identification of the causal factors among the\nunmeasured variables. However, if application of the Oaxaca\ntechnique reveals no unexplained differences in HHC service\nuse, then an equitable market with acceptable racial differences\nis indicated. An additional caveat in the use of the Oaxaca\ndecomposition approach is that measurement errors may also\ngenerate unexplained racial variation in the use of HHC. If\nregression variables are systematically measured with error by\nrace, for example, self-reported diseases, then the systematic\ndifferences would appear as components of the unexplained\ngap in service use.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nTable 1 presents the study sample characteristics by race.\nBlacks had a 25% greater chance of utilizing HHC. The sample\nincludes 91% non-Hispanic Whites and 9% non-Hispanic\nBlacks, with similar mean ages of 78 and gender distribution\n(63% female). Whereas 40% of Whites live in medium or large\ncities and 35% are in the South, more than half of Blacks live in\nmedium or large cities, and two thirds live in the South. Fully\n70% of Whites, but only 29% of Blacks, have Medicare\nplus supplemental health insurance coverage, a striking racial\ndifferential. Blacks are much more likely than Whites to have\nlikely than Whites to be dually eligible (36.7% vs 10.4%). These\nracial insurance status differences correspond to differences\nin education and income. The average income is slightly over\nWhites have at least a ninth grade education compared with 39%\nfor Blacks. Preferences for preventive health and wellness differ\nfor the two racial groups. Whites are more likely than Blacks to\nreport drinking one to two times a week (15% vs 5%) and also\ngetting exercise or playing sports regularly (23% vs 14%), but\nBlacks are slightly more likely to smoke (13% vs 10%).\nThe ability of older persons with chronic illnesses to remain\nin the community is affected by the availability of caregivers\n(measured by the number of other adults in the household) and\nnonhousehold support services (measured by use of home-\ndelivered meals). The number of other adults living in the home\ndiffers by race, with Blacks having an average of slightly over\ntwo, while Whites average only one and a half. The data indicate\ndifferences in the use of home-delivered meals (7.3% of Blacks\nvs 4.8% of Whites). Blacks are more likely than Whites to live in\nstates with high physician/population ratios (6.63 vs. 5.00), with\nhigh Medicaid waiver programs (25% vs 8%), and also with\nsmall Medicaid waiver programs (12% vs 3%).\nBlacks report the presence of chronic health conditions more\nfrequently than do Whites, with the exception of breathing\ndisorders. The presence of heart conditions is reported by\nBlacks and Whites with similar frequency (28%). However,\nBlacks report joint disease, diabetes, and hypertension more\nfrequently. Blacks average more ADLs than Whites (1.78 vs\n56% of Blacks report four or more ADLs (compared with 47%\nof Whites), and 29.4% report one or more IADLs (compared\nwith 26.5% of Whites). Note that for both Blacks and Whites,\nADL prevalence is higher than IADL prevalence. Based on the\nNLTCS screener criteria, this is not unexpected, as suggested in\nthe data description section above. The prevalence for difficulty\nin getting around inside is 33.1%, and the prevalence for\ndifficulty in getting around outside is only 3.9% (3.9% for\nWhites and 3.8% for Blacks). Thus, the results might be slightly\nskewed by including difficulty getting around outside as an\nADL rather than an IADL.\nRacial Patterns in Use of Formal HHC\nTable 2 reports two models analyzing the logistic regression\nresults for HHC use by Blacks and Whites. Model I includes\na race dummy variable, and Model II also includes race\ninteraction terms. Chronic medicial conditions, ADLs, IADLs,\nand enabling, environmental, and sociodemographic factors\ninfluence HHC use.\nIn both Model I and Model II, heart condition is the chronic\ncondition most likely to lead to HHC use. Older persons with\nmore ADLs and IADLs have greater HHC use, and both\nincome and income squared are statistically significant.\nInterestingly, there is a nonmonotonic relationship between\nincome and HHC use. First, HHC use decreases as income\nincreases; then, for those with higher incomes, increases in\nincome are associated with increases in the probability of HHC\nuse. It appears that HHC use is U-shaped with respect to\nincome, as has been found for nursing home care (Headen,\nmeals programs are more likely to use HHC. However, as\nthe number of persons living in the household increases, the\nprobability of HHC use decreases. Dual eligibility increases the\nlikelihood of HHC use, a likelihood that varies with the extent\nof state funding available for Medicaid community waiver\nprograms. Women and persons who are older and have more\nformal years of education are more likely to use HHC, but those\nwho are married are less likely to use HHC. The regression\nindicates that the variable of race is statistically insignificant in\ninfluencing HHC use.\nThe role of race is further explored in Model II with race\ninteraction terms. Each variable that was significant in Model\nI remains significant in the full interaction model, and the\nvariables interacting race and diabetes and race and income are\nalso significant. Thus, if Blacks have diabetes, they are more\nlikely to use HHC than White diabetic individuals and also more\nlikely than Blacks who have other major chronic conditions.\nFurther, when we examine Blacks and Whites who have the\nsame income, Blacks are more likely than Whites to use HHC.\nTable 3 presents the results of our stratified logistic regressions\nof the use of formal care by race and the marginals for signifi-\ncant coefficients. The influence of race on some independent\nvariables, as reported in Table 2, allows us to estimate the\nregressions separately, although a Chow test indicates that race\ndoes not affect the impact of all independent variables on the\ndependent variable. With the exception of the marginals for the\nincome and income-squared terms, in the reported logistic\nregressions, the marginal is exp(\u00c0a\u00c0bx)*bi\nwhere bi\n\u00bc the regression coefficient for the variable for which\na marginal is reported. Thus, Table 3 reports the marginal effects\nof the significant independent variables on the probabilities of\nHHC use, that is, the percentage point differences in the\nprobability of HHC use when the regression variable changes\nby 1 unit. For regression variables that are dichotomous, the\nmarginal is the percentage point difference in the probability of\nHHC use when the regression variable has a value of 1.\nComputing the marginals for the income and income-squared\nterms is complicated because we use an interactive term (in-\ncome squared) in a nonlinear regression model, that is, logistic\nThus, the marginal for income is (b2\n) * exp(\u00c0a \u00c0 bx)/\n\u00bc the estimated coefficient of the\nincome term, b4\n\u00bc the coefficient of the squared income term,\n\u00bc the mean of the income variable.\nMarginals are comparable with reporting odds ratios, but\nthey are more straightforwardly comprehended. Whereas odds\nratios provide data on the relative increased probability of use,\nmarginals provide data on the absolute increased probability of\nuse. Odds ratios indicate the effect of a unit increase of the\nindependent variable on the odds of an event [(probability of\nHHC use)/(1 \u00c0 probability of HHC use)], but marginals report\nthe effect of a unit increase in the independent variable on the\nprobability of HHC use.\nThe results in Table 3 indicate that despite the difference in\nsample size for the Black and White samples, there are unique\nracial patterns in HHC use. As suggested in the interactive\nmodel, among Blacks, diabetes increases the probability of\nusing HHC by 10%; among Whites, heart conditions are\nassociated with higher probabilities (4.5%) of HHC use. ADL\ndisability affects HHC use for both Blacks and Whites.\nThe direct effect of each additional ADL is to increase the\nprobability of HHC use by 4.3% for Whites and by 4.6% for\nBlacks. For both racial groups, participation in delivered meals\nprograms is associated with a greater likelihood of using HHC,\nwith greater probability of 24% for Blacks and 12% for Whites.\nSeveral impacts are unique among Whites. More IADLs are\nassociated with greater HHC use, with each additional IADL\nincreasing the probability of HHC use by slightly less than 1%;\neach year of age increases the probability of HHC use by 0.25%;\nwomen have a slightly (3%) higher probability of HHC use; more\neducation increases the likelihood of HHC use by 3%; and\nmarried status reduces the likelihood of HHC use by 6%. Three\nenabling/environmental characteristics also influence HHC use\namong Whites. Dual eligibility increases the probability of use by\n8% in states with high Medicaid community waiver programs\nand by 7% in states with low Medicaid community waiver\nprograms. There is a nonmonotonic relationship between income\nand HHC use. At lower income levels, each $1,000 increase in\nincome decreases the probability of HHC use by 1.7%, but higher\nincome (above $49,500) increases the probability of using HHC.\nFor each person living in the house, the probability of HHC use\nExplained and Unexplained Racial Patterns\nin the Use of HHC\nWe apply the Oaxaca technique to determine how much of\nthe racial differential in the probability of using HHC is\nexplained by racial differences in medical and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics. We calculate the difference between the\nprobability that Whites would use HHC assuming their own\nactual characteristics (0.1554) and the probability that Whites\nwould use HHC assuming they have the characteristics of\nBlacks (0.1984), as measured by [F(Xw, \u00dfw) \u00c0 F(Xb, \u00dfw)]. This\n\u00c00.0430, which is approximately the actual racial gap in HHC\nthat differences solely in the medical, socioeconomic, enabling,\nand environmental characteristics of Blacks and Whites\nshould lead to the observed racial gap in HHC use. Expressed\ndifferently, we find that HHC is indeed an equitable health care\nmarket.\nDISCUSSION\nConsistent with our prediction that HHC provides an\nequitable community-based health care market, the raw data\nindicate that in 1994, Blacks were more likely to use HHC than\nTable 2.

In this study, we find that predisposing, enabling,\nenvironmental, and need factors influence the use of HHC by\nboth Blacks and Whites. Blacks have a 25% higher probability\nof using HHC than Whites. We find that racial differences in\nchronic conditions and socioeconomic factors fully predict this\ngreater likelihood of HHC use among Blacks. This finding\nsupports our hypothesis that HHC use is equitable by race.\nOlder Black patients who live in the community with health\nconditions that are more extensive than those of White patients\n(possibly due to lower use of nursing home care and earlier-\nthan-average release from hospitals) are absorbed by the HHC\nmarket, which presents few barriers to access.\nWhat do these results mean when other research (e.g.,\nWallace and colleagues 1998) finds that racial differences\npersist? The highlight of our findings is that HHC provides\na uniquely equitable market. Similar to other research, our\ndescriptive statistics (see Table 1) note a racial difference in\nHHC use, with Blacks having greater use. However, using our\nregression model and an expanded set of variables relative to\nthose of Wallace and colleagues (1998), we find that racial\ndifferences in these sample characteristics explain racial\ndifferences in use of HHC among community-based older\npersons. Thus, the racial differences we identify in HHC are not\nracial disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2002) and do not reflect\ndivergences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability.\nAs described in previous research (Hodgson & Cohen, 1999;\nWallace et al., 1998), chronic conditions (e.g., need) signif-\nicantly influence HHC use, and those with the most impact vary\nby race. Diabetes is most reported by black HHC users,\nwhereas a heart condition is most reported by Whites. These\nfindings indicate that health policies or policy changes that\ndifferentially affect HHC use by chronic condition may also\nhave unintended differential racial impacts. For example, the\n1997 Balanced Budget Act, disallowing venipuncture as a sole\nqualifier for HHC coverage by Medicare, possibly imposed\na greater burden on Blacks than Whites, because venipuncture\npatients are primarily diabetic. Research indicates that loss of\nHHC among disqualified venipuncture patients reduced their\nbathing and dressing assistance, requiring them to do more for\nthemselves (Rubin et al., 2003). Thus, an unintended effect of\nthe Balanced Budget Act, decreasing access to a service more\nheavily used by Blacks, possibly reduced the racial differential\nin HHC use. This legislation may even have reversed the prior\ntrend of relatively higher HHC use among Blacks, and its\nimpact is worthy of further investigation.\nADL limitations increase HHC use for Blacks and Whites,\nalthough by different percentages, which is consistent with\nMeans, 1997) noting the central role of disability level in\naffecting HHC use. The unique role that meals programs play in\nincreasing use of HHC needs further exploration. A remaining\nquestion is why HHC differs from other health care services\nfor older persons. Examining the differential impacts of race\nand chronic conditions on older persons' use of assistive\nplained underuse gap for Blacks. White-Means (2000) finds\nTable 3.

For HHC, we find higher use\namong Blacks and no unexplained use differential.\nIt is important to note that whereas the NLTCS involves\na complex sampling method, it is nonetheless nationally rep-\nresentative. The NLTCS has only a minimal research design\neffect of sampling (maybe 10%). Therefore, use of SUDAAN\nin regression analysis to adjust standard errors for underesti-\nmation of the true variation is considered unnecessary. Further,\nputting the SUDAAN model on top of the regression would\npossibly portray an inaccurate degree of precision (K. Manton,\npersonal communication, 2004). This is in contrast to the\nprocedures necessary for numerous other complex survey\ndesign data sources where the sampling technique leads to\nsubstantive correlation among observations, necessitating the\nuse of weights.\nWe predict use of HHC at one point in time and show that this\ncross-sectional view of HHC use indicates equity. Analyzing\nHHC use within a dynamic modeling framework remains an\ninteresting area for future research. For example, it is unclear\nwhether Blacks are more likely than Whites to use HHC for\nextended periods or with more or less continuity than Whites.\nThese are also additional components of equity of care that are\nbeyond the scope of this article.\nAnother area for future research is the importance of\nincluding detailed measures of variation in support at the\ncommunity level, comparable with the enabling variables that\nBradley and colleagues (2002) label ``availability of support.''\nWe are unable to incorporate these variables analytically,\nbecause although we have individual data, the NLTCS lacks\ndetailed community-level variables, giving our research\nimperfect measures of the community variables of Bradley\nand colleagues. Inclusion of these community support variables\nwould address significant differences at the small area level.\nAlthough our data suggest there are not unexplained racial\ndifferences in HHC use, we are unable to determine whether there\nare racial differences in the types and quality of HHC received,\nbecause different types of HHC are not delineated in the data.\nThus, further research is still warranted to understand whether\nthere is equity in terms of quality of care provided by different\ntypes of helping organizations. In addition, questions of how\nracial differences in household and family formation affect HHC\nuse and whether the actual intrahousehold relationships are\nimportant deserve future investigation. Our results indicate that\nbeing married and also the number of other adults in the\nhousehold are significant for Whites but not for Blacks.\nThe relationship between HHC use and cultural differences is\nanother area for prospective research. Culture, expressed in\ngroup values and beliefs, may affect the selection among long-\nterm care options and between institutional and noninstitutional\nchoices (Thornton & White-Means, 2000; Wallace et. al.,\n1998). Thus, measured racial differences may embody cultural\ninfluences that are implicit rather than explicit. Explicit\nmeasures of knowledge and cultural preferences for receipt of\nHHC versus other health care services, personal experiences of\ndiscriminaton when interacting with the health care system or\nwith the HHC services market, and charactersistics of patients'\ncommunity health care systems are further issues needing\ninvestigation. These analyses would provide input for effective\npublic policy measures to address racial disparities in use of\nhealth care services and enable replication of the equity in use\nthat our data indicate is provided by the HHC market.\n"
