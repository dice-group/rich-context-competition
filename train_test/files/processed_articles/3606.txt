The paintings\nwere donated to the Tate Modern Gallery in London in 1968, which hung them for many\nyears with the stripes running horizontally. The paintings were then rotated so that they were\nhung with the stripes running vertically for a time, before being returned to the horizontal\norientation for an exhibition of Rothko's work. Controversy has surrounded the question\nof the correct orientation in which to hang the paintings. Rothko's signature indicates a\nhorizontal orientation (see Jamieson 2008), but the works are currently hung vertically. The\nartist himself may have been unsure; paint dribbles run in both directions on the canvas.\nArt historians have debated the relative aesthetic merits of the two orientations. There are\nanecdotal reports of other disputes about the correct orientation of other paintings, including\nwork by Matisse, Rauschenberg, van Gogh, and O'Keeffe. But does orientation really matter\nin an abstract or semiabstract painting, at least to the untrained eye?\nModern art often contains little or no recognisable representation of real-world objects\nor scenes. Abstraction allows the artist to focus on composition and medium rather than on\nsubject matter. In the process of creating a modern artwork, an artist may make an aesthetic\ndecision regarding the orientation at which the work should be hung, based on their intended\nmessage. The correct orientation is often specified on the back of the canvas. However, this\nintended orientation is not always obvious to others viewing the work, especially if there is\nno recognisable content at all, which raises questions about aesthetics. Is there sufficient\ninformation in a modern artwork for a na\u00efve viewer's judgement to align with the correct\nOrientation judgement in modern art 19\norientation? Is the impact or aesthetic value of a work diminished by viewing at an incorrect\norientation? Relatively few studies have addressed such questions, but answers to them\nshould throw some light on the cognitive processes underlying visual aesthetic judgement.\nLindauer (1969) asked participants to indicate their preferred orientation for 54 abstract\npaintings and found that half were in agreement with the artist's intended orientation. On\nthe other hand, Swartz and Hewitt (1970) showed their participants a series of abstract\npaintings, either in the original format or rotated or mirror-reversed, and asked participants\nto rate each image aesthetically. Aesthetic ratings were not affected by rotation or mirror\nreversal. Latto et al (2000) were primarily interested in preferences for vertical and horizontal\norientations over oblique orientations in Mondrian paintings, though they did report slightly\nhigher aesthetic ratings for paintings presented at the intended orientation. Plumhoff and\nSchirillo (2009) more recently found some evidence of higher aesthetic ratings for Mondrian's\npaintings presented at the correct orientation. In Johnson et al's (2010) study of the same\nMondrian paintings, pupil size was significantly higher for the correct orientation than for\nother orientations.\nThe present study aims to build on previous studies by (i) systematically investigating the\nrelevance of recognisable content in preferences for orientation (a potential confounding\nfactor in previous studies employing a range of abstract artworks) and (ii) assessing whether\na commonly used statistical measure of information content in images has any bearing\non orientation-dependent judgements. Recent work suggests that the Fourier amplitude\nspectrum slope plays a role in aesthetic judgements of art (Graham and Field 2008; Redies\nIn the first experiment, participants were shown four versions of each artwork, oriented\nat 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees clockwise with respect to the intended orientation, and asked\nto select the most pleasing or meaningful image. Was the correct orientation chosen more\noften than would be expected on the basis of chance?\nEighteen na\u00efve participants were recruited from the student body at Sussex University, none\nof whom had any previous formal training in art.\nForty modern artworks were selected from three art books (Gerhardus and Gerhardus 1979;\nGibson 1997; Hunter 1997), scanned electronically, and rescaled so that the longer dimension\nof each image was 300 pixels (to allow all four versions to be visible simultaneously on a\ncomputer monitor). Fifteen images had a vertical \"portrait\" aspect ratio, and twenty-two\nhad a horizontal \"landscape\" aspect ratio. The remaining three were square. The criteria for\ninclusion of paintings were that (i) there was a clear intended or \"correct\" orientation, (ii)\nthe work was produced by an artist of international renown, and therefore of high aesthetic\nquality, (iii) the set as a whole represented a sample of modern art from the early to mid\n20th century, and (iv) paintings varied in the extent to which they exhibited recognisably\nrepresentational content. Figure 1 shows three of the paintings in the set. A full list of artists\nand titles for all 40 paintings is available as supplementary material.\nFigure 1. Three of the paintings used in the experiments. (a) Kasimir Malevich (1878\u00ad1935) Suprematist\nYork/Scala, Florence.\nThe experiment was controlled by a Flash application running on a Dell desktop PC. Stimuli\nA single trial involved presentation of one of the 40 artworks (order randomised across\nclockwise with respect to the correct orientation as defined in the source book; oblique\nframe orientations were not used because they occur much less frequently in true artworks,\nand only a few orientations could be presented on the screen at an acceptable resolution).\nThe screen was divided virtually into four quarters, with one image in each quarter. The\non-screen ordering of the four orientations varied randomly from trial to trial and between\nparticipants. The centre-to-centre separation of the images was 17 deg horizontally and 12\ndeg vertically at the 57-cm viewing distance. The longer dimension of each image subtended\n10.3 deg. Images were presented against a uniform dark grey background (2.3 cd/m2); the\nmean image luminance varied from image to image between approximately 3.7 and 38\nParticipants were given an unrestricted time to view each set of four on-screen images\nand used a mouse to click an on-screen button next to each image according to the following\ninstruction: \"Select the orientation which is the most pleasing or meaningful.\" Given that\nparticipants may detect some meaningful content in a given painting (even if none was\nintended by the artist), this instruction acknowledged the possibility that they may use that\ninformation in their judgement. Successive trials were separated by a 0.5-s interval during\nOrientation judgement in modern art 21\nwhich the screen remained blank. Responses were recorded by the Flash application and\ntransferred to an Excel spreadsheet at the end of the session.\nThe amplitude spectrum slope was estimated for each image using a script written in\nMATLAB\u00ae as follows. Each image was converted to grey-scale using a standard YIQ transform\nwas performed on the largest central square section of the image. The slope of the best-\nfit line to the rotationally averaged amplitude spectrum (plotted on log\u00adlog coordinates)\nwas calculated. In order to avoid spatial frequency artefacts owing to image sampling and\nnonlinearities, line fitting was restricted to the middle range of frequencies between 0.25\u00d7\nand 0.5\u00d7 the maximum spatial frequency available in the Fourier transform (cf Redies et al\n2007). To assess possible orientational anisotropies in the images, the ratios of horizontal to\nvertical (H:V) power and oblique to cardinal power (O:C, where C = ([H + V] / 2)) were also\ncalculated.\n2.2 Results and discussion\nEach participant provided four scores that correspond to the proportion of responses at each\nshows the mean scores across the 18 participants (\u00b11 SE). Since there were four orientations,\nchance performance falls at 25%. Observers reliably selected the correct orientation over\nthe other three available orientations in almost 50% of trials, a figure which is close to\nthat reported by Lindauer (1969). One-factor ANOVA revealed a highly significant effect of\ncorrect orientation (0 deg) were significantly higher than responses at each other orientation.\nNotice that all the other available orientations were selected much less frequently and at\nabout the same rate of 16\u00ad18% or so each. This result indicates that participants were not\ngenerally prone to confuse upright with inverted versions of the images consistently; they\neither selected the correct orientation or chose one of the others equally often overall.\nFigure 2. Mean percentage responses at each orientation across the 18 participants (\u00b11 SE). The\ncorrect orientation corresponds to 0 deg; other orientations are expressed in degrees clockwise relative\nto this orientation. The dotted line corresponds to chance performance.\nin a previously published study of abstract art (\u00ad1.13; Graham and Field 2008). There was no\nsignificant correlation between image spectral slope and the percentage of correct orientation\njudgements (r = 0.0124, ns). Correlations of orientation judgements with measures of\nanisotropy were higher but nonsignificant: for O:C (oblique to cardinal power), r = 0.171; for\nH:V (horizontal to vertical power), r = \u00ad0.181.\nOn inspection of the data for individual images, it is clear that the correct orientation was\njudged quite consistently in some cases but not in others. For certain images, it is possible to\ndiscern a pictorial element in the image that may have facilitated a decision. For example,\na tree shape may be seen on careful viewing of Braque's House at Estague (88.9% correct).\nIn other cases, it is not clear how participants were able to infer the correct orientation.\nMiro's Birth of the World is quite abstract, as is von Wiegand's City Lights, but both supported\nResponses in Experiment 1 may have been influenced by detection of meaningful content\nin some paintings, rather than by aesthetic pleasure alone, and this factor may have masked\nany effect of spectral slope. A second experiment assessed the extent to which recognisable\ncontent in the form of a meaningful object or scene was detected in the experimental stimuli.\nEight na\u00efve participants were recruited from the student body at Sussex University, none of\nwhom had taken part in Experiment 1.\n3.1.2 Materials, apparatus, and procedure\nThe same 40 modern artworks were used as for Experiment 1. The equipment was identical to\nthat in Experiment 1. The experimental task was also almost identical to that in Experiment\n1; all four orientations were displayed for each painting, but in this experiment the on-screen\ninstruction read: \"Does each painting contain recognisable or meaningful content?\" Two on-\nscreen response buttons were available, labelled \"Abstract\" and \"Recognisable.\" Observers\nwere instructed to click on \"Recognisable\" if they saw any meaningful content in the painting,\notherwise to click on \"Abstract\". They were also instructed to base their answer on any of the\nfour orientations presented and were given an unlimited time to make a judgement.\n3.2 Results and discussion\nThe mean percentage of \"meaningful\" responses was calculated for each of the 40 paintings\nand ranged from 0% for seven paintings such as Kasimir Malevich's Suprematist Composition\nto 100% for five paintings such as Fernand Leger's Two Women with Still Life. Across the\n40 paintings, the correlation between correct orientation judgements in Experiment 1 and\n\"meaningful\" responses in Experiment 2 was 0.65 (p < .0001); thus, recognisable content\nclearly did have a significant relation to orientation judgements, though only 42% of the\nvariance in orientation judgements in Experiment 1 can be attributed to recognition of\nmeaningful content.\nA partial correlation was performed across the 40 paintings to assess whether spectral\nslope played a role in orientation judgements independently of \"meaningful\" judgements.\nThe correlation was 0.157 (ns), so across the full image set, orientation judgements were\ndominated by recognition of meaningful content. The seven paintings in which no partici-\npant reported any meaningful content at all had a mean spectral slope of \u00ad1.26, and a mean\nOrientation judgement in modern art 23\npercentage of correct orientation judgements of 23.02% (range 0\u00ad55.6%). In these purely\nabstract paintings the correlation between percentage correct and spectral slope was 0.64\n(r2 = 0.41), so there is a hint that purely abstract images with the shallowest spectral slope\nare easiest to judge, though the sample size is very small. One painting in this abstract set,\nJackson Pollock's One, was judged correctly in 55.6% of responses and has a spectral slope of\nThere are other intriguing variations between individual paintings. The three paintings\nin Figure 1 are particularly interesting. In the case of Kasimir Malevich's Suprematist\nComposition, 72% of responses selected an incorrect orientation rotated 90 deg anticlockwise\nfrom the correct orientation, and none of the 18 observers selected the correct orientation.\nNo observer discerned any meaningful content in this painting, which has a very steep\nspectral slope of \u00ad1.56. All observers also agreed that Piet Mondrian's Composition contained\nno meaningful content, and only 5.6% of them selected the correct orientation (the other\nthree orientations were chosen equally often by observers). The painting's spectral slope is\n\u00ad1.58. Only one participant saw anything meaningful in Joan Miro's The Birth of the World, yet\nover half of the participants in Experiment 1 selected the correct orientation. The painting's\nA limitation of the present study was that there was no systematic attempt to assess the\ndegree to which participants were familiar with any of the artworks, though participants\ndid not report any familiarity during informal debriefing. For example, Pollock's One (see\nFigure 1) is famous and should therefore arguably be quite familiar to some participants.\nHowever, given the abstract nature of the work, it seems unlikely that untrained participants\nwould have retained such detail in memory that they were able to judge its orientation\ncorrectly.\n4 Conclusions\nIn agreement with anecdotal reports from galleries, the judgements of nonexpert viewers\naccord with the intended orientation for abstract or semiabstract art at levels well above\nchance. However, performance is far from perfect, consistent with results in previous studies.\nThe most important new result is that orientation judgements are mediated at least in part by\nsome appreciation of meaningful content in the image. However, in a minority of paintings, a\nconsistent orientation effect was obtained, even when no meaningful content was apparent.\nThe origin of these orientation judgements remains to be identified conclusively, but image\nspectral slope may play a role.\n"
