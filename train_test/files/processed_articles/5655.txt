Clinical doctors and researchers share\na common goal of choosing a safe and\neffective treatment procedure for protecting\nthe femoral head of patients with ONFH.\nSeveral hip-preserving procedures have\nbeen developed to maintain or reconstruct\nthe mechanical environment and interrupt\nthe disease path of articular collapse. These\nprocedures include core decompression,\ntranstrochanteric rotational osteotomy,\nfree and non-vascularized fibular grafting,\nand fibular allografts. Total hip arthroplasty\n(THA) is considered as the standard\nand effective treatment option for patients\nwith femoral head collapse in terms of\npain relief and functional improvement.\nHowever, many authors have reported\nhigh rates of failure of THA in patients\nwith ONFH, especially in intermediate-\nto long-term results. For young patients\nwith THA, several surgical treatments\nare required. Therefore, the head-preserving\nprocedure is the first choice for young\npatients.\nThe hip joint is the largest weight-bearing\njoint of humans,1 whose pathological progres-\nsion is closely related to the biomechanics.2\nSeveral staging and classification criteria,3\u00ad6\nincluding the Japanese Investigation\nCommittee (JIC) classification, Association\nResearch Circulation Osseous system, and\nthe Ficat system, were developed and used\nto guide treatment of ONFH. However,\nnone of these disease evaluation criteria\ntake into account biomechanical basis\nlimits. Therefore, the situation where selec-\ntion of treatment is solely based on isolated\nobservation of images is in urgent need of\nimprovement.\nThis study used computational biomech-\nanical technology to investigate the damage\npatterns of different classifications of ONFH\nbased on the JIC classification. Our results\nprovide a specific biomechanical basis for\ntreatment decisions of each subtype.\nMethods\nJIC classification\ncriteria to clarify the definition of ONFH.\nAccording to the JIC classification criteria,\nONFH is classified into subtypes A, B, C1,\nand C2, which are based on the location\nof the lesion in the weight-bearing area\n(Figure 1 and Table 1).\nComputational models\nFive computational models were con-\nstructed according to the JIC classification.\nClinical data were used to stimulate\na healthy femoral head and create four\nclassifications of a necrotic femoral head in\na mid-stance gait cycle. Seven muscles were\nconsidered as axial connectors and muscle\nFigure 1. Diagram of the Japanese Investigation Committee classification system.7\nforces as previously reported.8 The endpoint\nof muscles and cortical bone was connected.\nThe assumed plane load was considered as a\nground reaction force that was equivalent to\nbody weight, with application to a rigid\nplate that was attached to the distal part of\nthe femur. All models are described as\nnonlinear isotropic elastic models and were\ninput to ABAQUS V6.13 (Simulia Co.,\nShanghai, China) to generate isotropic\n10-node tetrahedral elements. A single-\nlegged stance was considered as a represen-\ntative body position for the primary models.\nConstraints were applied to the pubic sym-\nphysis and sacroiliac joint. All six degrees of\nfreedom were constrained to zero.\nResults\nDamage patterns of the stress\ntransfer path\nIn this study, the damage pattern of the\nstress transfer path (STP) was an important\nindicator for evaluating the deterioration\nprocess of ONFH. The contours of the STP\nwere plotted from a coronal section view of\nthe femur during the gait cycle. As shown in\nFigure 1a, the STP of the physiological\nfemoral head was distributed along the\ndirection of the principal compressive tra-\nbeculae from the weight-bearing area to the\nfemoral calcar. The STP loads principal\ncompressive stress. The STP of type A\nshowed a strong similarity to the healthy\nlevel (Figure 1b, c). The damaged area of\nprincipal stress of type B was approximately\n25% of the healthy level. The STPs of types\nC1 and C2 were broken and the damaged\narea of principal stress was more than 50%\nof the healthy level (Figure 1d, e). The\nefficiency of stress transfer was reduced.\nStress distribution of the anterolateral\ncolumn\nPrevious research has shown that the risk of\ncollapse of the femoral head is highly\ncorrelated with the anterolateral column of\nthe femoral head.9\u00ad11 Therefore, we calcu-\nlated the average stress of the anterolateral\ncolumn from all anterolateral elements.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the relationship\nbetween average stresses of the anterolateral\ncolumn and the deterioration process of\nONFH. The average stress increased with\nan increase in necrotic region. In type A, the\naverage stress was similar to that measured\nat the healthy level. In type B, the average\nstress was approximately 4.5% higher than\nthat at the healthy level. The average stress\nhigher in type C2 than the healthy level.\nThese findings indicated that the risk of\ncollapse of the femoral head in type C was\nincreased.\nValidation of the models\nFor validation purposes, the model was\nsubjected to a reaction force that was equiva-\nlent to body weight. The principal STP of this\nmodel showed strong similarity to previous\nresults in the literature8 and to the bone\ndensity distribution in a cross-section of a\nTable 1.

The hip joint is the largest\nweight-bearing structure, in which patho-\nlogical progression is closely related to the\nbiomechanics. However, treatment options\nbased on isolated observation by images\nwithout biomechanical basis are required.\nWe postulate that bone necrotic deterior-\nation would destroy the STP and increas-\ningly reduce the stress transfer efficiency of\nprincipal compressive trabeculae. Because\nthe four types of ONFH have different\nbiomechanical characteristics, target treat-\nments of types may achieve better clinical\nefficacy. To test this hypothesis, we created\nfive necrotic damage models to examine the\ndamage patterns of the STP and the risk of\ncollapse of the anterolateral column.\nThe current study aimed to investigate the\ndamage pattern of the STP for JIC classifi-\ncation of pre-collapse ONFH to provide\nspecific biomechanical basis for treatment\ndecisions of each subtype. Many biomechan-\nResults from biomechanical models consider-\ning damage patterns of STP in different\nclassifications have not been previously pub-\nlished. Using five computational models, we\nfound qualitative damage patterns of the STP\nand a quantitative risk of collapse of the\nanterolateral column. There was a rise in\ndamage to the STP with increasing necrotic\ntrabecular region (Figure 2). These results\nindicate that when the femoral head with\nnecrotic lesions is more than two-thirds of the\nweight-bearing portion, the principal STP\nwill break off and the stress transfer efficiency\nmay be reduced by half. The risk of collapse\nof the anterolateral column increased by\nnearly four times higher when necrotic\nlesions did not extend to the acetabular\nedge laterally. The risk of collapse of the\nFigure 2. Stress transfer path of the femoral head.\nanterolateral column increased to more than\neight times higher when necrotic lesions\nextended to the acetabular edge laterally\n(Figure 3). These findings indicate that the\nfemoral head lost bearing capability. This\nmay have been caused by the necrotic region\nlosing the ability to load stress, while cortical\nbone must be overloaded with work to retain\nmorphology and function of the femoral\nhead. When necrotic lesions of the femoral\nhead were between one-third and two-thirds\nof the weight-bearing portion, the damaged\narea of the STP was less than 25%. The risk\nof collapse of the anterolateral column was\nonly increased by 4.5%. These findings indi-\ncate that the femoral head still has the\nfunction of bearing weight. When necrotic\nlesions of the femoral head were less than\none-third of the weight-bearing portion, the\nSTP was still in good condition. There was no\nrisk of collapse in the anterolateral column.\nConclusions\nThis study supports use of computational\nbiomechanical technology for investigating\nthe damage patterns of different classifica-\ntions of ONFH based on the JIC classifica-\ntion. Our study shows that damage patterns\nof the STP are closely related to classifica-\ntion of the necrotic femoral head. The\nefficiency of the STP is reduced with an\nincrease in necrotic region. In the early stage\nof ONFH, such as type A/B, biomechanical\nbehaviour shows little change compared\nwith the healthy femur, which indicates that\nconservative treatment may be used.\nHowever, the STP is broken and the risk of\ncollapse of the anterolateral column increases\nin the later stage of ONFH, such as type C1/\nC2. This finding indicates that surgical treat-\nment may be used in this situation.\nAuthors' Information\nYing Zhang and Kewei Tian: co-first authors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nIn support of the research for this manuscript,\nthe authors received grants from the National\nthe Natural Science Foundation of Henan\nChinese Medicine Research in Henan\nChinese Medicine Research in Henan Province\nReferences\n1.
