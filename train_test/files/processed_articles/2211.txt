We\nsought to provide insight into the drug use patterns of those reporting nonmedical use of\nprescription attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) stimulants in an attempt to dis-\ncern whether such use is a first step in a pattern of drug-abusing behavior or, conversely, is\na later development accompanied or preceded by a history of drug abuse. A cross-sectional,\npopulation-based survey of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 years\nand older was analyzed for lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants, life-\ntime nonmedical use of another prescription drug, illicit drug use, and drug use initiation\nUse and Health. Lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants was reported\nby 3.4% of those aged 12 years and older. Of these, 95.3% also reported use of an illicit\ndrug (i.e., marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants) or nonmedical use of\nanother prescription drug (i.e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, or sedatives), and such use pre-\nceded nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of cases. On average, 2.40\ndrugs were used prior to the first nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants. These\ndata suggest that nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants is not commonly an initi-\nating factor leading to the nonmedical use of other prescription medications or abuse of illicit\ndrugs.

For example, Herman-Stahl et al.11\nanalyzed young adult's responses (age range,\nDrug Use and Health (NSDUH) and found\nthat using marijuana and other illegal drugs in-\ncreased the odds of both methamphetamine\nand nonmedical prescription stimulant use.\nyear olds reporting prescription stimulant mis-\nuse (defined as nonmedical use, use that was\nnot prescribed, or use only for the experience\nor feeling it caused) were likely to report using\nthree or more illicit drugs at least once in their\nAlthough multi-drug use is well docu-\nmented among nonmedical users of prescrip-\ntion stimulants, research to date has typically\nbeen limited to young adults or college stu-\ndents. Furthermore, limited analyses have been\nperformed of drug use initiation patterns (i.e.,\nwhether the other drug use occurred before,\nduring, or after the same time period as the non-\nmedical prescription stimulant use). Using data\nexamined the order of first nonmedical use of\nprescription stimulants and other prescription\ndrugs and illicit drugs among lifetime users and\nfound that the age at initial nonmedical use of\nstimulants was more often earlier than initial use\nof several other drugs, including crack cocaine,\nheroin, ecstasy, cocaine, prescription tranquil-\nizers, PCP, and prescription pain relievers. Ini-\ntial use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and\ninhalants preceded initial misuse of stimulants\nfor most users of stimulants and other drugs.\nHowever, the broad category of stimulant med-\nications, as measured in the NSDUH and re-\nported by Colliver et al.,15 is composed of not\nonly ADHD medications, but also prescription\ndiet pills and methamphetamine. We sought to\nprovide insight into the drug use histories of\nthose specifically reporting nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants in an attempt to\ndiscern whether nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants was the first step in a pattern\nof abusing behavior or, conversely, whether it\nis a later development following a preexisting\nhistory of drug abuse. We also sought to ex-\namine and compare the demographic charac-\nteristics of those reporting nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants, those reporting\nother drug use, and those reporting no drug\nuse. This study examined the drug use patterns\nand correlates of those reporting nonmedical\nuse of prescription ADHD stimulants in a gen-\neral population sample, based on data from\nwhich were largely restricted to young adults,\nthe NSDUH affords an opportunity to exam-\nine nonmedical use in a broad U.S. population,\nincluding adolescents, young adults, and adults.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an analysis of the public use data\nfrom the NSDUH, an annual household-based\nsurvey sponsored by the U.S. Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration. The\nNSDUH collects information on the preva-\nlence, patterns, and consequences of drug and\nalcohol use and abuse via in-person, computer-\nassisted interviews from a representative sample\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. pop-\nulation aged 12 years and older. Specifically,\nNSDUH collects information from residents of\nhouseholds and noninstitutional group quarters\n(e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories) and\nfrom civilians living on military bases. The sur-\nvey excludes homeless individuals who do not\nuse shelters, military personnel on active duty,\nand residents of institutional group quarters,\nsuch as jails and hospitals. The data used in\nthis analysis are based on information obtained\nthrough 2009 surveys. Analysis weights were\ncreated so that estimates would be representa-\ntive of the target population.\nThe NSDUH solicits information about the\nnonmedical use of four broad categories of pre-\nscription medications: stimulants, pain reliev-\ners, tranquilizers, and sedatives. Nonmedical\nuse is defined in the NSDUH as use of these\nmedications without a prescription of the re-\nspondent's own or use simply for the expe-\nrience or feeling the drug caused. The sur-\nvey includes questions that allow for estimation\nof nonmedical use of these broad categories\nof prescription drugs in the participant's life-\ntime, the past year, and the past month. The\nNSDUH also contains detailed questions about\nthe nonmedical use of a large set of specific\nmedications. However, this information is gen-\nerally limited to use at any time in the indi-\nvidual's life (i.e., lifetime use). Additional infor-\nmation (e.g., age of first use) is generally only\nobtained for the broad drug categories, not for\nspecific medications.\nFor questions regarding nonmedical use of\nprescription stimulants, respondents are pre-\nsented with a single placard containing pictures\nof the common dosage forms of several dif-\nferent prescription stimulants and a listing of\nonly the names of some others. The stimulant\ncategory includes prescription-type metham-\nphetamine (e.g., Desoxyn), prescription diet\npills, and ADHD medications. Our focus was\non assessing the nonmedical use of stimulants\nwith specific indications for the treatment of\nADHD (Table 1).\nSeveral ADHD medications are pre-\nsented in one of three groups (Ritalin\nand Methylphenidate constitute one such\ngroup). The remaining medications (including\nDexedrine and dextroamphetamine) are pre-\nsented individually on the placard. Respon-\ndents are instructed to review the stimulant\nTABLE 1. Prescription Stimulants for ADHD Reported in the NSDUH and Used in the Calculation of Lifetime Nonmedical Use of\nPrescription ADHD Stimulants\nDrug-specific question and open-ended responses Open-ended responses onlya\n\u00b7 Dexedrine (drug-specific question, open-ended responses) \u00b7 Biphetamine\n\u00b7 Dextroamphetamine (drug-specific question, open-ended responses) \u00b7 Dextrostat\n\u00b7 Ritalin/methylphenidate (drug-specific question, open-ended responses) \u00b7 Concerta\n\u00b7 Metadate CD\n\u00b7 Dexmethylphenidate, Focalin\n\u00b7 Methylin\n\u00b7 Dexamyl\n\u00b7 Adderall XR\n\u00b7 ADHD/ADD medication; otherwise\nunspecified\nAbbreviations: ADHD = attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; NSDUH = National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\naTwo recently approved stimulants for the treatment of ADHD (Daytrana, approved in 2006, and Vyvanse, approved in 2007) were\nnot included in this analysis because they were not available throughout the entire time period of study. However, an examination\nof NSDUH data revealed no reports of nonmedical use of Daytrana in response to open-ended questions in 2006\u00ad2009; <0.01% of\nrespondents reported nonmedical use of Vyvanse in both 2009 and 2008 in response to open-ended questions, although there were no\nplacard and are asked the following for each\ngroup:\nHave you ever, even once, used [Ritalin or\nMethylphenidate] that was not prescribed\nfor you or that you took only for the expe-\nrience or feeling it caused?\nFor the medications presented individually on\nthe card (including Dexedrine and dextroam-\nphetamine), respondents are told to look at all\nof the pictured or listed medications and are\nasked:\nWhich of the stimulants shown below the\nred line on Card C have you used when\nthey were not prescribed for you or that\nyou took only for the experience or feeling\nthey caused?\nNonmedical use for the remaining ADHD stim-\nulants (e.g., Biphetamine, DextroStat, Con-\ncerta, Dexamyl, dexmethylphenidate/Focalin,\nMetadate, Methylin) was captured via the fol-\nlowing open-ended question:\nHave you ever, even once, used any other\nprescription stimulant, besides the ones\nshown on Card C when it was not pre-\nscribed for you or that you took only for\nthe experience or feeling it caused?\nIf the respondent answers \"yes\" to this question,\nthen he or she is asked to state which other pre-\nscription stimulant they used. The medications\nin the previously described questions could also\nbe captured in this open-ended question. Thus,\ninformation on the nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants is captured via responses\nto both close-ended questions that directly ask\nabout nonmedical use of specific ADHD med-\nications and open-ended questions that ask\nbroadly about any other prescription stimulant\nuse.\nPrior to 2006, information on nonmedical\nuse of Adderall (any formulation) was captured\nvia the open-ended question about some other\nstimulant. However, in 2006 a series of ques-\ntions specifically about Adderall were added\nto a section of the survey entitled \"Special\nDrugs\" in which respondents are asked the\nfollowing:\nAdderall is a prescription stimulant that\ncomes in tablet or capsule form. Adderall\ntablets and capsules are shown below. Have\nyou ever, even once, used Adderall that was\nnot prescribed for you or that you took only\nfor the experience or feeling it caused?\nThose who reported any nonmedical use\nof Adderall were further asked when they had\nlast used Adderall nonmedically (i.e., within the\npast 30 days, more than 30 days ago but within\nthe past 12 months, or more than 12 months\nago). For our purposes, a person was considered\nto have engaged in nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants if they reported any non-\nmedical use of a prescription stimulant specifi-\ncally indicated for the treatment of ADHD (i.e.,\nany of the medications listed in Table 1) during\ntheir lifetime, whether based on a drug-specific,\nclosed-ended question (including the Adderall-\nspecific questions added in 2006) or an open-\nended question.\nQuestions regarding nonmedical use of\nother prescription medications (i.e., prescrip-\ntion pain relievers, tranquilizers, and sedatives)\nare asked in a similar manner. Specifically, re-\nspondents are shown visual examples of brand\nname pills and asked:\nHave you ever, even once, used [any of the\nfollowing medications when they were] not\nprescribed for you or that you took only for\nthe experience or feeling they caused?\nRespondents are also asked a follow-up\nquestion to assess nonmedical use of other pre-\nscription medications:\nHave you ever, even once, used any other\n[prescription medication], besides the ones\nshown . . . when it was not prescribed for\nyou or that you took only for the experience\nor feeling it caused?\nRespondents who answer this question af-\nfirmatively are then asked to provide the names\nof other prescription medications used non-\nmedically. The names of up to five other pre-\nscription drugs may be provided for each cat-\negory (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,\nand sedatives).\nThe NSDUH also collects information on\nage at first nonmedical use for the four broad\ncategories of prescription drug type (How old\nwere you the first time you used any pre-\nscription [pain reliever/tranquilizer/stimulant/\nsedative] that was not prescribed for you or that\nyou took only for the experience or feeling it\ncaused?). This information is only collected at\nthe category level, and not for specific medica-\ntions within the broader class. Age at first use of\nillicit street drugs (e.g., cocaine/crack, inhalants,\nmarijuana/hashish, heroin, and hallucinogens)\nis also collected.\nANALYSIS\nWe calculated the percentage of those who\nreported ever having engaged in nonmedical\nuse of a prescription ADHD stimulant in the\nreported are unweighted; all percentages and\nmean ages that are reported are weighted.\nTable 1 includes the list of specific ADHD stim-\nulants that were incorporated in this measure.\nAmong those who reported ever having en-\ngaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD\nstimulants, we calculated the age at first non-\nmedical use for the broad category of prescrip-\ntion stimulants (because information on age at\nfirst use for specific stimulant medications, in-\ncluding ADHD medications, was not available).\nThus, for those who engaged in nonmedical\nuse of prescription ADHD stimulants only (and\ndid not report nonmedical use of any other\nprescription stimulant medication) the reported\nage at first use specifically represents the age at\nfirst nonmedical use for an ADHD medication.\nFor those who reported engaging in nonmedical\nuse of other stimulants, as well as nonmedical\nuse of prescription ADHD stimulants, it is not\npossible to determine whether the reported age\nat first use refers to nonmedical use of an ADHD\nmedication or another type of stimulant medi-\ncation. In this case, the reported age at first use\nis only a proxy for age at first nonmedical use\nof prescription ADHD stimulants.\nAmong those who reported ever having en-\ngaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD\nstimulants, the reported age at first nonmed-\nical use of any other prescription drug class\n(i.e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, and sedatives)\nand age at first use of any illicit drug use were\nalso calculated. The reported average age for\nfirst nonmedical stimulant use was compared\nwith the average age for first use of other\ndrugs to determine the proportion of those\nengaged in nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants for whom initial use of other\ndrugs (marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallu-\ncinogens, and nonmedical use of tranquilizers,\npain relievers, and sedatives) occurred prior\nto their initial nonmedical use of prescription\nstimulants.\nWe also examined the following poten-\ntial correlates of nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants: age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nmarital status, education, employment status,\nand population density. Chi-square statistics\nand corresponding P values were calculated\nto compare the demographic characteristics of\nthose reporting nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants with the following two\ngroups: those reporting other nonmedical use\nor illicit drug use (but no nonmedical use of pre-\nscription ADHD stimulants) and those report-\ning no drug use (meaning no nonmedical use\nof prescription ADHD stimulants and no non-\nmedical use of other pharmaceuticals or use of\nillicit drugs). These statistics were calculated us-\ning SUDDAAN version 10.0.1, which accounts\nfor the complex weighting scheme used by the\nRESULTS\nOver the study, 3.4% of Americans aged\n12 years and older reported ever having en-\ngaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD\nstimulants. Among those, 16.8% reported non-\nmedical use of ADHD stimulants exclusively,\nwhereas the remaining 83.2% reported non-\nmedical use of other stimulants in addition to\nADHD stimulants (e.g., prescription diet pills\nand methamphetamine). Table 2 compares the\ndemographic characteristics of (1) those re-\nporting any lifetime nonmedical use of pre-\nscription ADHD stimulants; (2) those report-\ning other nonmedical use or illicit drug use\n(including nonmedical use of non-ADHD pre-\nscription stimulants for those not reporting any\nTABLE 2.

Of those reporting nonmedical use of pre-\nscription ADHD stimulants, 87.0% were Cau-\ncasian, Non-Hispanic, versus 72.8% for those\nreporting other drug use and 64.5% for those\nreporting no drug use.

Such use preceded nonmedical use\nof prescription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of\ndrugs were used prior to nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants. Among those re-\nporting nonmedical use of prescription ADHD\nstimulants who also reported use of an illicit\ndrug or nonmedical use of another prescrip-\ntion drug, the most commonly reported other\ndrugs were marijuana (90.6%), hallucinogens\n(Table 3).

Considering those who\nonly reported nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants (i.e., those who did not re-\nport nonmedical use of any other stimulant\ntype aside from ADHD stimulants), the reported\nmean age at first nonmedical use of a pre-\nscription stimulant was 21.06 years. Consider-\ning those who reported nonmedical use of other\nprescription stimulants, in addition to nonmedi-\ncal use of ADHD stimulants, the reported mean\nage at first nonmedical use of a prescription\nstimulant was 19.38 years. Reported first use\nof marijuana (average age = 15.92 years), in-\nhalants (average age = 17.48 years), hallucino-\ngens (average age = 17.95 years), and nonmed-\nical use of prescription pain relievers (average\nage = 19.37 years) occurred at a younger age\ncompared with the first reported nonmedical\nuse of a prescription stimulant.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings suggest that nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants is not commonly\nthe initiating factor leading to the abuse of other\ndrugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants appears to be adopted by in-\ndividuals already engaged in broader patterns\nof drug abuse and nonmedical use.\nExtending previous research on the corre-\nlates of nonmedical use of prescription stim-\nulants among young adults and college stu-\ndents, we found in a general population sam-\nple that those who reported having engaged\nin nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stim-\nulants also reported having engaged in other\ndrug use. Among those reporting lifetime non-\nmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants\nin our study, 95.3% also reported use of an\nillicit drug or nonmedical use of another pre-\nscription drug class, with such use typically (in\n77.6% of cases) preceding nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants. This suggests a\nbroad trend of individuals already engaged in\ndrug abuse and misuse who seek out new drugs\nas they become available. It does not suggest\nthat prescription stimulants indicated for the\ntreatment of ADHD have any particular appeal\nfor first-time or na\u00a8\nive nonmedical users of drugs.\nIn fact, available research suggests that individu-\nals who are treated for ADHD are at a lower risk\nfor developing a subsequent substance abuse\ndisorder than those with untreated ADHD.16\nOur study also extends prior research by\nproviding some insight into the patterns of\ndrug use over a user's career. For those re-\nporting both nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants and other drug use, the other\ndrug use preceded nonmedical use of pre-\nscription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of cases,\nwith an average of 2.40 drugs reportedly used\nprior to the first nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants. Because the NSDUH\nquestion about age of first use pertains to all\nprescription stimulants (not ADHD stimulants\nspecifically), this indicates that nonmedical use\nof prescription ADHD stimulants first occurred\nafter at least 2.40 other drugs were used non-\nmedically or illicitly. It was not possible to\ntell how often nonmedical use of prescription\nADHD stimulants occurred only after nonmed-\nical use of other prescription stimulants had al-\nready been initiated because the NSDUH only\ncharacterizes initiation of nonmedical use of the\nprescription stimulant class, without regard to\nbrand. This likely results in under-counting of\ndrug use preceding nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants. For example, someone\nwho engaged in nonmedical use of prescription\ndiet pills prior to nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants would not be counted as\nhaving engaged in nonmedical use prior to non-\nmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants.\nConsequently, the data underestimate the ex-\ntent that drug use preceded nonmedical use of\nprescription ADHD stimulants.\nIt is unknown how many of those reporting\nnonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-\nlants in our study had also been prescribed the\ndrug legitimately; that is, the data are not able to\ndistinguish between the misuse of ADHD med-\nications by those for whom it is prescribed and\nnonmedical use by those without a prescrip-\ntion. However, prior research has found misuse\namong both groups to be associated with mul-\ntidrug use. For example, in a college sample,\nsimilar proportions of those with and without a\nprescription for stimulants (16%\u00ad18%) reported\nnonmedical use of stimulants (defined as use of\nany form of prescription stimulants that were\nnot prescribed for you or that you took only\nfor the experience or feeling they caused or\noveruse of a medically prescribed stimulant),\nand lifetime nonmedical use was independently\nand significantly associated with past year use\nof marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, hallucinogens,\nheroin, amphetamines or methamphetamine,\necstasy, prescription analgesics, and prescrip-\ntion tranquilizers.9\nThis study has several limitations. First, re-\nsults cannot be generalized to those population\ngroups excluded from the NSDUH sampling\nframe, including homeless individuals who do\nnot use shelters, active military personnel, and\nresidents of institutional group quarters, such\nas jails and hospitals. The NSDUH only obtains\ninformation on lifetime nonmedical use of spe-\ncific brands of prescription stimulants; it is not\ndesigned to estimate current use at the brand-\nspecific level. Because the NSDUH question\nabout age of first use pertains to all prescription\nstimulants (not ADHD stimulants specifically),\nit was not possible to tell how often nonmed-\nical use of prescription ADHD stimulants oc-\ncurred only after nonmedical use of other pre-\nscription stimulants had already been initiated.\nFurthermore, the information on age at first use\nis based on retrospective self-report, and there-\nfore is subject to recall bias. In addition, the cal-\nculated percentage of other drug use preceding\nnonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-\nlants could be affected by older adults who may\nhave used other substances in adolescence or\nearly adulthood before the prescribing of stimu-\nlants for the treatment of ADHD became more\nprevalent.\nThe specific survey question on which es-\ntimates of lifetime nonmedical use are based\ndoes not allow for differentiation between what\nmight typically be considered abuse of prescrip-\ntion stimulants (e.g., for psychotropic effect)\nand situations involving use by an individual\nfor whom the medication was not prescribed,\neven if it was taken only once and for a purpose\nconsistent with the therapeutic effect (e.g., an\nadult with suspected ADHD who took the med-\nication prescribed for their child, experienced\nthe medication benefits, and then went on to\nreceive a legitimate prescription after consult-\ning a physician). Finally, the NSDUH does not\ncollect information on motives for nonmedical\nuse, which would provide better understanding\nof the behavior.\nNonmedical use of prescription ADHD\nstimulants does not appear to be an initiat-\ning factor leading to the nonmedical use of\nother prescription medications or abuse of il-\nlicit drugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion ADHD stimulants appears to be adopted\nby individuals already engaged in broader pat-\nterns of drug abuse and misuse.\nNote\ni. The definition of nonmedical use can vary by study\nbut is defined by the SAMHSA and in this article as\n\"use that was not prescribed or that you took only\nfor the experience or feeling it caused.\"17 In cases where\nthe term is used in other published article, we specify\nthe exact definition of the term as used by the study\nauthors.\nREFERENCES\n1.
