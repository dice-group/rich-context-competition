Do you know where the shelter for homeless\npeople is in Farahzad?'2 It takes a few moments for her to register the question.\n`Do you mean the addicts' refuge [panahgah-e mo'tadan]? That one is at the very\nend of the road on your right-hand side, before the darre\u00b4 [valley]. Mind what you're\ndoing, it's not a place to go.' On my way I see several men, with worn-out clothes,\npicking up rubbish from the ground and stuffing it in huge fibre bags, which they\ncarry on their backs. They seem to me the urban equivalent of the nankhoshki, the\ndry bread collectors that up until recently animated the morning wake-up of many\nIranian towns. The men on this road do not use the rhythmic cry `nunkhoshke\u00b4,\nnunkhoshke\u00b4' of the bread collectors. They do not collect dry bread for husbandry\nbut the city's waste to sustain a chronic dependence on heroin or methampheta-\nmine (locally known as shisheh, `glass').\nThese garbage collectors walk around furtively; their presence evidently\nbothers the neighbourhood residents, who belong to the white-collar middle\nclass. Following this flow of collectors up the road, I end up in an open green\nspace which is just south of the Emamzadeh Davoud, an old shrine in North\nTehran. It is one of Tehran's ancient mahalle\u00b4, neighbourhoods, part of the\nShemiranat district. The shrine hosts one of the countless descendants of the\nShi'a Imams, who is thought to have arrived in the area with the Eighth Imam,\nImam Reza, whose mausoleum sits in Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan, in North-\nEastern Iran. So, on one side of the valley there is the shrine and on the other a\nshelter for homeless drug users. The body and the spirit of Tehranis find solace in\ntheir own ways.\nMost of those frequenting this patoq, `hangout', do not live in the neighbour-\nhood, although there are locals who spend their evenings there (Figure 3). Better\nprices, steady availability and less variable quality guarantee a better consumer\nexperience even in the face of the sheer degradation that the patoq's setting show-\ncases. The Farahzad Valley (darreh-ye Farahzad), where the shelter is located, has\nbecome a notorious site of drug use and open drug dealing in the last decade\nfollowing the arrests and clampdowns in other areas of Tehran. Journalists have\nnamed it `The Autonomous Area of Farahzad', while the police have attempted,\nfor some time, unsuccessfully to bust the drug lord of Farahzad, Said Sahne\n\u00b4 ,\nallegedly one of the biggest in town (Tabnak, 2013). Police operations, with the\nintention of clamping down on drug users' gatherings in more visible areas of the\ncity, drove flows of drug users to this traditional neighbourhood. In turn, the area\nbecame a successful market of narcotics and stimulant distributions, connecting the\ntraditional crime-ridden districts of the south \u00ad notorious for drug dealing (as I\ndescribe later) \u00ad with the westernised bourgeois north.\nPractically, Farahzad Valley's drug scene is made up of numerous patoqs\n(Figure 1\u00ad2). The one closest to the shrine is Chehel Pelleh, the `Forty Steps',\nwhich sits at the bottom of an old staircase \u00ad once made up of 40 steps, today\nmostly a remnant of bricks and clay. It is known as the biggest of all hotspots in the\narea. The bustling is continuous with some arriving from the main road from the\ncloser residential complex and others descending from the shrine's neighbourhood.\nStrategically located, the site remains insular from the main roads and, therefore,\nfrom the police. It operates in an economy of its own:\nOn flat ground surrounded by trees and streams of water lies the `high street' of\nthe patoq. A home-made wooden desk is placed on the muddy route, with a man\ndispensing different cuts of aluminium paper and various models of lighters.\nHe sells the paraphernalia necessary for heroin smoking, for the modest price of\none to two thousand tuman (ca. \u00a30.50).3 On the other side, there is the tarazudar,\nthe `weight-scaler man' who is the person in charge of drug dealing, especially\nquantities exceeding the single dose. The tarazudar dispenses heroin, a substance\n(shisheh), the stimulant drug which had become popular since the mid-2000s. The\nmain stash of drugs, I'm told, is secreted in several places by the local boss. In case\nof police raid, which is not an unforeseeable occurrence, the main dealer has the\noption of running away (e.g. motorbikes, hide-outs in the neighbourhood) or of\nhiding in the crowd of other drug users. In the latter scenario, he risks being\narrested but avoids being recognised as a dealer. He steers clear of the risk of\ndraconian penalties for dealing, which in Iran ultimately included execution up\nSecurity in the patoq is guaranteed by a number of gardan kolofts, `roughnecks'\nwho act as vigilantes in the drug hotspot. They consist of look-outs, informers, but\nalso enforcers of the local order. They carry clubs and knifes but no gun, at least\nFigure 1. Chehel Pelleh. Photo by author.\naccording to the widespread belief of those in the surroundings. The boss of the\npatoq pays them a daily wage for their services, mostly in the form of drugs, which\nthey re-sell, or limited monetary compensation, or a combination of both.\nStrangers are dissuaded from passing through the patoq for fear of being taken\nfor undercover cops or informants. This applies at times also to humanitarian\ngroups, such as outreach activists who provide clean needles, condoms and primary\nhealthcare to the people there. On one occasion, following an earlier police busting\noperation in the area, one of the vigilantes threw a heavy wooden club at me from\nuphill shouting `boro gomsho ****!', `get lost, ****!'. Suspicion and distrust\ntowards strangers is the rule, a fact that undermines also health initiatives\namong people using drugs, especially injectors and sex workers (Figure 2).\nThe reason why HIV prevention activities are often rejected was, in the words of\none of the bosses, `because here in Chehel Pelle\u00b4, we don't have them! Tazriqi\nnadarim, we don't have injecting drug users, we don't want them, they are dirty.\nWe are clean. Here is a clean space!' Perplexed about his statement, he added: `Go\nto the patoq Mohammad Deraz, you can give this stuff [clean needles, etc.] there,\nuna` tazrighian, they're injectors!' Yet HIV is rampant in these sites and mobility\nbetween different hotspots increases the chances of transmission of diseases,\nFigure 2. Harm reduction in Farahzad Valley. Photo by author.\nwhether through shared injecting paraphernalia or sexual encounters. Keeping a\nlow profile, many drug users would approach those distributing clean needles to be\ntested for HIV and hepatitis. They would usually walk away with half a dozen\nclean syringes and a few condoms.\nWithin the patoqs, there is a social/ethical stratification. About 20 minutes' walk\nfrom Chehel Pelle\u00b4, there is Mohammad Deraz patoq (Tall Mohammad), named\nafter a local dealer who, according to the local myth, was very tall. The atmosphere\nin this patoq is more relaxed compared to that of Chehel Pelleh; there is a combin-\nation of people from different social backgrounds, men and women, and in general\nyounger people. But not only young people frequent the enclave; it also functions\nas a tented encampment. It is there that I encountered Fereshteh and her boyfriend.\nA young couple covered in dirt, with soot-streaked faces, sat in front of a small\nblue tent. I met them around 10am while they were smoking heroin on a piece of\naluminium. `They had just woken up and were preparing their breakfast' explained\nHamid, the person who introduced me to them. Fereshteh welcomes me with a big\nsmile which reveals the poor state of her teeth. Her lips are dark of the smoke of the\nopiate and her face swollen. She must be no older than 25, I thought. After the\nmutual presentations she offers me an apple, as per courtesy in Iranian culture \u00ad\nand regardless of the destitution in which she and everyone there lived, insists that I\nmust have something while we sit together. So we split the apple in two and we eat\nit; her boyfriend declines to share it out of courtesy. `We have less than nothing and\nthat is all I can offer you', and taking up the aluminium Fereshteh says, `Not to be\nimpolite: befarma! Help yourself if you please!' I decline her kind offer of heroin,\nsaying that I'm OK with the apple. She asks me whether I am a recovered addict,\nbecause `you look good', `you're healthy' and `it's evident you're in a good state'.\nThen she adds, `Wow, I haven't talked to a non-addict for such a long time, it is so\nnice to speak to people who are not addicts. Here everyone is an addict; everyone\nuses drugs or is in recovery or has been addicted. All NGO workers, too, are\nformer addicts, they all hung out here with us up until recently [while nodding\ntowards Hamid, the NGO worker].' She chases the dragon, inhales it through\na tube and concludes, `It's been three years since I spoke to someone who is not\nan addict'.\nFereshteh has tried to `get clean' several times. Earlier that year, she signed up in\na methadone clinic, which happened to be near the shrine uphill, managed by a\nphilanthropic doctor who provides free-of-charge services. She had felt awful,\nthought of dying and that is, she continues, because her drug of choice is not\nheroin \u00ad and she says so while holding some in her hand \u00ad but shisheh (meth).\nMethadone, the legal substitute for opiates, does not work for her; `I need energy\nand speed, otherwise I starve'. Her heroin use is to relax and have a sound sleep:\n`mesl-e takh bekhabam', and take away her body pain: `dardam bicharam kard'. So\nshe does heroin when she wakes up and before going to sleep. Shisheh keeps her\ngoing while at work and hustling. And, `for pleasure'.4\nShe has lived in the tent with her boyfriend for more than a year. Her look is\nthat of a sick, dirty and dishevelled person. He sells `used' stuff and stolen goods\nwhile she collects garbage and recycles old clothes. They are not married but they\nlive together. Their existence parallels the `white marriages' of many young urban\ncouples who, not ready for the formalities and commitments (including financial\nand of housing) of de jure marriage, opt for informal arrangements, by living\nunder the same roof. This option, nonetheless, remains illegal and repressed \u00ad\nhaphazardly \u00ad by state authorities (The Guardian, 2015). For Fereshteh this is\nthe least of her troubles. Her boyfriend sells used mobile phones and does petty\ndrug dealing around town. He has been in and out of treatment centres, but with\nno success. Fereshteh collects garbage \u00ad one of the few female collectors I met \u00ad\nand, when desperate, she begs. `We want to get back our lives and return to society.\nPray for us! Three years ago I used to study and go to school and now I'm in\nthis. . .'. She is suddenly interrupted by her boyfriend, `Careful! You're on fire!'.\nFereshteh looks at me for a second or two, evidently on the heroin high, smiles and\nreplies, while taking off her hood, `puff, if I were at home I would be screaming like\ncrazy here and there. Here, it doesn't matter, it's like this, we live like this, it's\nnormal. We set ourselves on fire!'\nHer hood had caught fire while she was lighting up some heroin. A few metres\naway, later in the day, I encounter an old man \u00ad or perhaps a 40-year-old who\nlooks 70 \u00ad whose tent was burnt to ashes. His response, aware that all he had was\nnow up in smoke, is emblematic of lumpen life on drugs, `It doesn't matter, it's a\nsadagheye khoda, a charity for God, it saved my life, if only I were there asleep in\nthe tent now, I'd be dead.' The old man and Fereshteh don't care about burning\ntheir stuff to ashes, because, after all, life on the road is, to borrow from Jack\nVocabulary of Situations\nSuch is the situation at work in drug wars against the dangerous classes of the\naddicts. Drug wars, in the first place, take the form of powerful criminalisation of\nindividuals' drug consumption. Prohibition is the ideological frame that governs\ndrug wars and that, ultimately, produces spaces of repression and isolation, in the\nforms of prisons or under the bridges of drug ghettos. These spaces of destitution\nwith their local distinctions across the globe are bearers of similar semantic traits\nIn Iran, addiction defines the poor categorically. In Tehran alone there are\naround 15,000 homeless people, with the number changing according to the sea-\nsonal migration from the hinterland. This migration is driven partly by the search\nfor a living and the promise of higher revenues in the capital Tehran; but it is also\nthe result of seasonal climate. The southern hinterland has a climate that is hardly\ntolerable for homeless and vagrant people in the summer, whereas Tehran, situated\n1000m above sea level, has milder summer nights, which makes it ideal for open-air\nsleeping. This works also the other way round: Tehran's snowy and cold winters\ncompel large numbers of homeless vagrants to seek refuge in the milder climates of\nthe southern plateau. The migration to Tehran signifies the arrival of low-skilled\ncheap labour employed in desultory tasks, whereas in the south this prospect is\nabsent.\nOverall, the number of homeless people addicted to drugs reaches 42,000 nation-\nwide (ADNA, 2016), but this number is thought to be a conservative estimate. They\nare called kartonkhab, `the cardboard-box sleepers', velgard, `the vagrant', bikhane-\nman, `the homeless', but the category through which they are governed is what the\npolice has named mo`tadan-e porkhatar, `the dangerous addicts'. In fact, more than\n80 per cent of the homeless population is, according to official sources (Mehr,\n2016), addicted to illicit substances: heroin, meth, alcohol, morphine, methadone\nand so on. A high incidence of HIV/AIDS (a blood-borne disease easily spread by\nsharing injecting equipment) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) have also\nbeen revealed, despite this population remaining largely invisible or hidden in\nthe cityscape. Its ecology of existence is made up of the popular districts of the\nsouth, the valleys and caves in the north, the undeveloped lands under the highway\nbridges and, recently, the graveyards in the suburbs (Habibi and Ghiabi, 2017).\nFollowing the opening ethnographic scene, the article provides an ethnographic\naccount of the lives the `dangerous class' of street addicts based on fieldwork\ncarried out among different drug using `communities' in Tehran between 2012\nand 2016. It explores the themes highlighted in the opening ethnographic scene,\ni.e. the place of homeless (dangerous) drug users; the structural violence of their\nlives; and the political economy of lumpen existence. The primary objective is to\narticulate the presence of this category within modern urban life, its uses and its\nabuses in relation to power. What drives the narration is not only the account of\nthis lumpen, plebeian group vis-a\n` -vis the state, but also the way power has affected\ntheir agency, their capacity to be present in the city, and how capital/power and the\ndangerous/lumpen life come to terms, to conflict, and to the production of new\nsituations which affect urban life. The article also tackles the theoretical and his-\ntorical frame of reference upon which the narrative is built. This includes a glimpse\nat the history of drug prohibition, its rationale and its connection to the category of\nclass, especially to that of lumpenproletariat and the dangerous poor. In this\nattempt, one can bridge the hermeneutic gap in the study of the non-western\nworld, where the category of `dangerous class' was first enunciated. It connects\nthe lives of cities across the Global North and South, through in-depth description\nof lumpen situations the reader is invited to `see' how categories born out of socio-\nlogical analysis in other times and spaces can be at work, productively, in new\ncontexts. The intent is to add not simply to the knowledge of new historical, ethno-\ngraphic cases, but to enrich the understanding of the category of the `lumpen' and\ndangerous class.\nMy encounter with the individuals described in this article occurred during an\nextended fieldwork project carried out in the city of Tehran. Comprehensive and\nsynthetic elements of the experience of homeless drug users is narrated through\ndense ethnographic cases (Javad, Fereshteh, Mohsen, Hamid, Reza and Ali), built\non personal immersion in their life settings, including dozen visits to the patoqs,\n`deep hanging out' (Geertz, 1998) in the public and casual but sustained chats while\nstrolling in the city or sat in proximity of their `private' dwellings. Observation of\nthe setting landscapes and the way it was transformed in the passing of time (from\n2012 to 2016) also informed my ethnographic analysis. Although I am aware this is\nnot exhaustive \u00ad as all generalisation betrays ethnographic details \u00ad the description\nof events, settings and modes of existence mirror recurring traits in the drug-using\ncommunities I had the chance to study during my fieldwork. Contacts with\nindividuals occurred also while I volunteered with harm reduction outreach pro-\ngrammes in Tehran. Meetings occurred both during outreach programmes and\noutside those settings.5\nThe structural violence of lumpen life\nThe lives of lumpen drug users have become the object of structural violence\nproduced by capitalist forms of government and exploitation (Singer and Page,\nphysical and symbolic as it operates through mass incarceration of minorities and\nthe marginal, police killings and large-scale substance abuse as well as violence\nagainst these communities through the ideology of `individual achievement and free\nthe forms of prison or the poor people's ghetto, impedes human development\nthrough the exclusion of the working class and the undeserving poor \u00ad like home-\nless drug users \u00ad from the mainstream economy, ideological exclusion condemns\nthem to a virtual oblivion. Communities depleted by the addiction and anti-nar-\ncotic assemblage, the duo of chronic health shortcoming and selective judicial and\npolice targeting, go through a process of lumpenisation, which goes hand-in-hand\nwith the depoliticisation of unruly subjects in the city. Criminal records and spatial\nconfinement to urban neighbourhoods reputed as unhealthy and criminal become\nthus a structural obstacle for seeking employment; drug offences make that task a\nvirtually impossible mission. A general look at the scholarly literature cited above\nshows that this process is one of lumpenisation of plebeian classes and, from a\nstructural viewpoint, does not differ across the East and West, North and South\nOne cannot speak of `class' in reference to drug users. The category of drug user\nitself is an invention of a political machine which has listed certain substances and\nplants as exceptional (poppy/opium, coca/cocaine, cannabis/marijuana for\ninstance), but regulated others (tobacco, alcohol) in a flourishing capitalist\nmarket. This machine emerged in the first part of the 20th century concomitant\nwith state-led modernisation and through the influence of US anti-narcotic\ndiscourse \u00ad though countries in the Global South and, especially, in the Middle\nEast and North Africa (MENA) developed their own prohibitionist vision of the\nlexicon of 20th-century drug wars \u00ad is neither part of the economic system of\nproduction nor of its moral order. He or she is a parasite par excellence, because\nin the popular imagination he/she remains useless \u00ad of no use. He/she relies on\nillegal income or on charity and is therefore a liability in the political economy of\ndevelopment. Yet, chronic drug users \u00ad aka `addicts' \u00ad are also avid consumers, the\nnature of drug use being tied with chronic drug consumerism and the unending\nsearch for money/capital. This inescapable drive for consumption is what makes\nchronic drug users an essential identity/product of capitalist times. Therefore,\n`addicts' are not a class, but a category that cuts across social classes and is instru-\nmental in discriminating against the poor and the ethically underserving.\nThe experience of living under drug prohibition brings the wage labourers of\nfactories, farms and industries closer to the life of the wageless, the so-called people\nof the `informal economy'. That levels the ground between proletariat and lump-\nenproletariat. Michael Denning argues that `we must insist that ``proletarian'' is\nnot synonym for ``wage labourer'' but for dispossession, expropriation and radical\ndependence on the market' (Denning, 2010: 81), including the illegal drug market.\nDependence on the market defines the life of drug users in structural ways. The\nwage labourer, in parallel, under a system where those consuming certain sub-\nstances are objects of police repression, becomes what Marx called `a virtual\nwaiting, likely but not necessarily inescapable.\nUnder this rationale, the figure of the `addict' \u00ad its etymology reminding us of its\nLatin root, addicere, `to enslave', and particularly that of the homeless, street drug\nuser \u00ad establishes itself as a preeminent example of a class in dependency under\ncapitalist production; a class dangerous for its nature threatens bourgeois decorum\nand in danger because it is at the mercy of class-based subjugation. Hence comes\nthe making of poor drug users into a `dangerous class'. Programmatically perceived\nas a bearer of danger, disorder and irrational violence, its danger is manifested\nthrough different concerns, which encompass and enmesh criminality, health, mor-\nality and middle-class prosperity \u00ad elements that emerged in the opening ethno-\ngraphic description. The danger, however, is binary: seen as socially dangerous and\npolitical/ethical misfits, these are also categories in danger, because their life \u00ad\nqualifying as `bare life' (zoe\u00a8 as opposed to bios; Agamben, 2010) \u00ad is disposable,\nprecarious, wasteful, contaminated. Their death, too, is bare, as it does not leave\nThis overlapping of medical, sociological, criminologist and political concerns is\na side-effect of the medicalisation of politics vis-a\n` -vis the categories of the deviant.\nThis process had among its founders the Italian physician (and `physiognomist')\nCesare Lombroso, who first sought to preserve, on shaky medical grounds, the\nhealthy from the fool and the revolutionary (`i mattoidi e rivoluzionari') (Lombroso,\n1896), an expedient to preserve the status quo and middle-class decency amidst\nplebeian revolts of 19th-century Europe. Dismissed by scientific knowledge, his\ntheories confuted, their implication was maintained in the nexus between medicine\nand criminology of which drugs policy is an especial field (though I am not aware\nof Lombroso's direct influence on Iranian criminologists). In this medico-political\nframe, medical understanding enables a moral and political judgement, which\nbestows upon scientific definitions (such as mental disorder, addiction, etc.)\na clear classist character. The rigid categories of medical sciences enmesh with the\nmore ambiguous ones of human knowledge, in a classist plot clothed in a neutral,\ntechnical language. The excitement of criminological reactions from the state vis-\na\n` -vis the homeless drug users is, in the words of British psychiatrist R.D. Laing,\n`a social fact which in turn it is a political event' (cited in Basaglia, 1971: 168). I\nshall now dwell more closely on the structural violence which has as its object the\ndangerous class of drug addicts.\nOver the decades following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the authorities\nreferred to unruly members of the suburbs with the derogatory term arazel va\nowbash. Its meaning is vague, but anthropologist Shahram Khosravi suggests\nthat, since 2007, it has become a notion constructed in opposition to the romanti-\ncised image of the louti, the gallant delinquent of the traditional neighbourhoods\ncan be traced back to the Arabic root `R-DH-L', which indicates something `low',\n`abject'; awbash instead stands for `riffraff'. Both are of Koranic derivation and of\nutmost negative value. Updating the Marxist use in The Eighteenth Brumaire of\nLouis Napoleon (2007 [1982]), of `social scum', `rotting mass' and `disintegrated\nmass', arazel va awbash can be synthetically translated as `lumpen'.\nThe law enforcement and political cadres of the Islamic Republic remained\nvague on who exactly belonged to this multifarious group of dangerous individuals.\nThose arrested for being arazel va awbash were systematically accused also of being\ninvolved in drug dealing and/or being addicted. In the official discourse, being\nconnected to drugs triggered an association with a milieu of sexual depravity,\nmoral decadence, alcoholism, Satanism and zurguyi, `bullying'. The danger posed\nby them is that of destabilising the moral order on which the Islamic Republic rests\nits legitimacy. The lumpen people, unable to adapt to the engaged and moderniser\nmomentum of the post-war era (post-1989), risk contaminating its body politic.\nFrom within they contaminate through physical and psychological deviancy:\naddiction. From without, they contaminate as part of an `imperialist plot' (toute'\neste`mari) aimed at undermining the Islamic Revolution, through the diffusion of\nthe westernised decadent lifestyle.\nSince the early days of the 1979 revolution, addicted people have never been\nregarded as deserving the compassion of the Islamist state. Rather than a result of\nIslamic tenets and scriptures, the lack of compassion for drug `addicts' stemmed\nfrom secular moral considerations rooted in the anti-drug ideology of the early\n20th century. Indeed, large-scale criminalisation had already been operating under\nthe Pahlavi Monarchy (1925\u00ad79), justified by the need for social and cultural mod-\nernisation (Ghiabi, 2018e). With the Islamic Revolution, anti-drug campaigns\nacquired the terminology of anti-imperialism \u00ad drugs as an immoral western\nimport \u00ad and of moral cleansing of the newly revolutionary social body. Drug\nusers' psyche and body were deemed at odds with the moral purity praised by\nthe clergy. That is why, during the 1980s, treatment of drug abusers was not pub-\nlicly available, since the official state strategy on addiction called for forced detoxi-\nfication through incarceration and forced labour (Ghiabi, 2015).The targeting\nof plebeian classes is a development emerging out of the shift in governing cadres\nand their political economy after the end of the Iran-Iraq War (1980\u00ad88).\nDuring the first years of the revolution, when Ayatollah Khomeini's authority\nremained unchallenged, the mosta'zafin (the Koranic term indicating the\n`disinherited') was used in opposition to the capitalist, westernised class of the\nmostakbarin (`the arrogant'). Policies in favour of the poor and the urban prole-\ntariat were legitimised as part of the promise of social revolution to which many\nherited classes were directly inspired by Franz Fanon's incitement to the Les\nDamne\u00b4s de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth, 1961), mediated through the\nwork of Iranian revolutionary intellectual Ali Shariati, who supported a sui generis\nIslamic Liberation Theology. This legacy lasted up until the mid-1990s, when the\nnecessities of reconstruction implied shelving the populist love for the disinherited\nin favour of developmental goals through investment and capital accumulation.\nToday, governmental cadres are pledged to an implicit taboo on the use of populist\ncategories such as the mosta`zafin.\nLarge-scale developmental programmes turned the capital Tehran into the\ncentre of economic gravity, a process that speeded up the already mass urbanisa-\ntion caused by war displacement in the 1980s. The face of the drug phenomenon\nby rising heroin injection, had become a material threat to the general population\nbeen put in place for people seeking medical assistance in kicking their habit\n(Ghiabi, 2018e). This shift towards a medicalised and more tolerant policy vis-a-\nvis drug consumption and drug dependence has had ambivalent outcomes. Middle-\nclass drug users are provided with the choice of subsidised methadone treatment or\nan array of in-patient centres which differ in methods and philosophy with regard\nto `getting clean'. Drug users that have not the benefit of choice and, particularly,\nhomeless and vagrant drug users are situated in a zone in between punishment and\ncare (Ghiabi, 2018a), which highlights the structural violence which governs their\nexistences. Javad Sorkhe\u00b4's (Red Javad) tale is testimony to this condition in the\nIranian setting.\nA Javadi history of drugs6\nJavad is a 32-year-old man. Born in Islamshahr, on the outskirts of Tehran, his\nfamily left their village in the Central Region (Ostan-e Markazi) to move to Tehran\nin the early 1970s. He is the oldest of five brothers and two sisters. Dropping out of\nschool during his teens, he has worked as a taxi driver in Shahr-e Rey, bus driver\nassistant on the Tehran-Qom line, and petty drug dealer over the last 15 years.\nOpium was a formative element in his family life. His father and mother were both\nheavy opium users and by the age of 16 Javad himself had acquired a taste for\nopium, hashish and later, with his companions, heroin. His story is reminiscent of\nthat of many young men in the lumpen city. Unemployment, illegal employment,\nfamily crisis, prison, disease, violence and drug abuse. All of these, he reiterates,\nimpeded Javad's attempt to get married: `no girl wanted the son of an addict', `no\ngirl wants someone without a future', `all the girls look out for the rich kids', `if you\nmarry someone from here [the neighbourhood] it ought to be from a desperate\nfamily; I got enough desperation myself'. The death of his father put further pres-\nsure on him to sustain the family: `it was enough for our hand to reach our mouth,\nbut drugs need money and we, mashallah, are all [drug] consumers!'\nUnable to do so through the legal economy, which remained stagnant for\nunskilled manual labourers facing the cheaper labour of Afghan migrants who\narrived in the 1980s, he is thrown into the informal market of smuggled goods\nand petty dealing: `I had a job, it was working out, then I got in some troubles with\nthe man running the business and I was kicked out; then I got another job but\nhammash khomar budam, I was always high, couldn't get my shit together', `it was\ndangerous but I made enough to have my stuff and help my mom'. After a couple\nof years, `I got caught because some of the kids gave my name to get one year\ninstead of five, that's how it works'. On this line, he cites Hich Kas, the Iranian\nrapper he knows I listen to too, in the song Ekhtelaf [Difference/Disagreement/\nConflict]: `inja jangale\u00b4, bokhor ta khorde\u00b4 nashi' [Here is the jungle, eat not to be\neaten!]. His words triggered in my mind the song's following two lines, which I\nthought described the situation more closely: `Ekhtelaf-e tabaqati inja bi-dad\nmikone\u00b4, bu-ye mardom-e zakhmi adamo bimar mikone\u00b4' [Class difference oppresses\nthis place, the smell of wounded people sickens].\nFigure 3. Map of Tehran's drug hotspots.\nDuring the period I met Javad, he smoked heroin and shisheh. The first is a downer\n(opiate), the other a powerful stimulant, an upper. His meth habit produced great\nmobility in the city, new encounters, more efficient work/rest balance, but also\nincreased paranoia and volatile relationships. His reactions to ordinary events, he\nconfessed, had become more aggressive and he had lost the capacity `to wait' (cf.\nKhosravi, 2017). Javad would purchase a few suts (1/10 of a gramme) and smoke it\nwhile on a stroll around town. In his own way, Javad is a plebeian fla^neur of the modern\ncity, his existence being present in the city mass but differently from his 19th-century\nequivalents, the 21st-century fla^neur is speedy and is no gentleman.7 Unproductive,\nunemployed, he has nonetheless unparalleled knowledge of urban life and landscape,\nwhereas the flanerie of the wealthy rolls exclusively on the wheels of fancy cars. Moving\nfrom South to North, by collective taxis, scooters, metro and walking, the presence of\nplebeian fla^neurs is increasingly visible in modern Tehran (Figure 3).\nIt would not be unusual for Javad to stop on a pedestrian bridge overlooking\none of Tehran's highways. He would take out his glass pipe and torch lighter,\ninhale with a deep breath, holding in, blowing out, before putting everything\nback in his pocket. In one occasion, he confessed: `My body is used to morphine,\ntarkib-am morfini-e\u00b4, my structure is morphine-like but this [shisheh] turns on my\nbrain. Otherwise I'm lost'. With meth, he felt motivated to stroll across the city,\nbeyond his usual neighbourhood, wandering. On the back seat of his friends'\nmotorbikes, on public services, he and his friends reasserted their presence\nin areas of Tehran outside their class-based domain. The unremarkable heroin\nsmoker who moved his body only in order to hustle enough to keep his habit\ngoing had now become a remarkable urban presence. Accounts in the newspapers\nabout shisheh smokers acting volatilely across the capital mushroomed throughout\nJavad was sentenced to prison on several occasions. Twice for petty dealing,\nonce for thuggery. Meanwhile he developed a taste for heroin, which he smoked\nwith the kids (bacche-ha), while killing time in southern Tehran. In prison, he\nneeded heroin to avoid the heavy withdrawal symptoms, so he reverted to sharing\nheroin with other inmates through a self-made pump or in signing up on metha-\ndone substitution programmes. `Thank God, I did not get AIDS! But I had no\nother solution there', he confesses while we walk around Harandi Park. Once out\nof prison he failed to find a stable dwelling and spent time wandering from parks to\nfriends' flats to the compulsory treatment camps to public methadone clinics.\nTreatment came always against his will following police arrests in one of the\ncollection plans against drug addicts and the arazel.\nI ask: `Why did the police arrest you? They keep saying ``addiction is a medical\nissue'', ``the addict is a person with a disease'', ``we provide treatment for the\naddict'' and then someone like you gets caught every two months.' His response\nwas telling of lumpen awareness of structural drug violence:\nYou know how the police work. Every now and then, the commander of some police\nunit decides that the statistics of crime are low, so the police captain comes to the\noffice and says, `today I want 100 criminals'. So the easiest way to get this number is to\nraid a patoq and you can get as many as you like. They do you the [addiction] test and\nthen send you to a [treatment] camp for one, two, three months. . . The addict is easy\nto get, so you know it's convenient for them. Newspapers talk about us. The rich feel\nmore secure. The shop owners sell more. Treatment centres get their subsidies. Even\nthe dealers take a break so the price goes up. And us? Khob, well, we get fucked!\nClear evidence of the systematic use of the addicts as a useful expedient to increase\npolicing records are difficult to obtain. But a quick look at the number of people\nincarcerated or referred to state-run treatment centres (mandatory treatment) over\nthe last decades provides the reader with a telling picture. In 1989, the number of\nthe more efficient anti-narcotics enforcement of the police. Javad's arrest following\nhis last prison term did not entail a specific crime, except for being a `dangerous\naddict', i.e. living at street level. He wasn't arrested for dealing drugs or smuggling\nillicit goods. He recollects being taken to a mandatory treatment camp, the notori-\nously violent Shafaq camp (Ghiabi, 2018a), at least on four occasions. `You get\narrested together with a hundred other people and you end up in a place where you\n``detoxify'' for a few weeks. Some people are happy about this especially when it\ngets colder in December and January. A warm place to stay for a few weeks and\nthen you can get back at your place, in the park, anywhere, after Nouruz [the\nIranian new year on 21 March]', when the weather is milder. His account is not\nisolated and I had confirmation of this in the stories of other individuals.\nReports of homeless drug users \u00ad or simply vagrant paupers \u00ad freezing to death\nin Tehran's cold winters are not sporadic. While carrying out fieldwork in the\nFarahzad patoq, there were several reports of homeless users falling asleep in the\nvalley and freezing to death. Dying in a patoq does not carry a public signature \u00ad\nthe vagrant's death is an event with no sign \u00ad except for statistical data on drug\ndeaths. It is a circumstantial event accompanying the journey from the bare life of\nthe homeless addict to their bare death (Comaroff, 2007: 197), bare inasmuch it\ndoes not leave a trace \u00ad no signature \u00ad in public life. The overlapping of life and\ndeath in the existence of lumpen drug users is considered a consequence of the\nillegibility of this category: not fitting in the scheme of state-society life, their\nexistence and non-existence blur into each other. Many homeless drug users, espe-\ncially when belonging to far-away rural regions or to ethnic minorities including\nthat of Afghan undocumented migrants, lack proper identification. Inability to\nprovide the ID card means finding oneself in a limbo vis-a\n` -vis the most basic\nneeds, such as health, education, housing and welfare. It is the case of the children\nof many foreign fathers (especially Afghans), but also to many street drug users\nwho amidst the unsettledness of their existence have lost track of their papers. With\nno identification, treatment/incarceration can be extended for longer periods.\nThe homeless, bi-khaneh or kartonkhab, exemplifies a case of khanemansuzi, a\nPersian expression used to describe the impact of drugs on people's lives. It means\n`burning one's house down' and it captures the status of the homeless drug users\nbeyond the metaphor. It suggests the abandonment in which homeless users exist,\ndisconnected from family (which in the Iranian context is the foundational ethical\nsite for social integration). The drug user, who has lost his/her dwelling, is equiva-\nlent to a sans papiers, someone who cannot be recognised, whose identity is trou-\nbling. In order to exist, he/she must pursue a life outside formal order to avoid\nbeing incarcerated or deported. To follow on the metaphor of khanemansuzi, the\ndwellings of street addicts become the kharabat, the `ruins', the image used in\nPersian poetry to describe the wine tavern, the bandits' nest, the sacred refuge,\nthe utmost disrupted site of the soul.\nMetaphors are abundant in lumpen life and they often bear empirical value.\n`We are in Barzakh' Hamid tells me, another `experienced' (his word) drug user\nfrom Darvazeh Ghar. `They take us, set us free, re-take us, it's like a game'.\nBarzakh indicates the Islamic Limbo, the place where men and women wait at\nthe end of time before God's judgement. The Limbo, however, has its material\ngrounds or, to put it crudely, graves. In November 2016, a shocking report in\nShahrvand, showed groups of more than 50 homeless drug users living and sleeping\nin the graveyards of Nasirabad, on the Tehran-Saveh highway. Gathered in this\ncemetery, with piles of cartons, plastic bags and wood, they occupied around\n20 graves. Two to four people live in each of the sepulchres where they burn\nwood to warm up in the freezing temperatures of the Iranian plateau. Gurkhabi,\n`sleeping in graves', became the new public trope which caused the piety and com-\npassion of social media users. The Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi even\nwrote a letter to President Hassan Rouhani, demanding that the government inter-\nvene with urgency.\nLiving in graves is indeed a powerful image in the public eye (Figure 4).\nHomeless users turn sacred, spiritual places, such as the shrine in Farahzad\ndescribed in the opening section, into profane surroundings of human decadence.\nThe cemetery too is stripped of its quiet and meditative dimension where ordinary\npeople bring their sorrows. It is now a place of destitution of lumpen lives, the\ngraves of the dead inhabited by precarious addicts. Yet, graves are safer and\nwarmer places, `to avoid policing and the cold', as a man in treatment in Shahr-\ne Rey explained. This is not an Iranian oddity. In Cairo, for instance, the dwellers\nin the ashawiyyat, the informal residences in Cairo's huge cemetery, enjoy better\nconditions than those who live in the city's crowded suburbs. Access to facilities,\nbetter connection to the city and insularity from state encroachment guarantee a\nsafer existence (Bayat, 1997). Although the `gravesleepers of Nasirabad' did not\nestablish informal settlements like their Cairene equivalents, they too found them-\nselves in a precarious, but safer, condition than those other homeless users in the\nparks or under the bridges. Following the report of grave sleeping, the police\nintervened in the cemetery and rounded up all the homeless drug users residing\nthere. They were taken to a compulsory treatment camp. Once released, almost all\nof them continued using drugs. Their new residence, in many cases, became the\nsurrounding deserts of Nasirabad (Vaqaye` Ettefaqiyeh, 2017).\nStructure and agency in the lumpen economy\nObjects of a systemic violence that denies them a place to exist, homeless drug users\nlive in a political economy of their own, made up of charity, hustling and sharing.\nThe centre of gravity of philanthropic endeavours for the urban proletariat and\nhomeless drug users is Darvazeh Ghar. Its name \u00ad which in Persian has a mysteri-\nous allure: ghar means `cave' \u00ad is said to derive from an episode in which one of the\nsons of the Imam Musa al-Kazem, the seventh Shi'a Imam, while fleeing the\nofficials of the government, took refuge in a cave and, as is often the case with\nShi'a leaders, disappeared (Masjed Jamei, 2016). Over the 20th century, informal\nsettlements dug in the ground and called gowd represented the most populated\nquarters of the area. The gowds hosted mostly brick makers who, given the lack\nof housing land, created their homes by digging in the ground. By the 1990s, under\nthe Rafsanjani government, the gowds had disappeared, making way for a new\nurban project. The gowd-e ma`sumi became Harandi Park; gowd-e arab-ha,\nBaharan Garden; gowd-e anvari, Khajavi Kermani Park; and gowd-e Khalu\nQanbar was replaced by Haqqani Park.\nThe four parks together are the centre of gravity of lumpen drug use in Tehran\n(Figure 5, 6 and 7). The parks and green spaces, carefully promoted by the Tehran\nmunicipality, have become dwellings for homeless drug users \u00ad hence `no-go zones'\nfor children and families. Shops and trades in these areas protest against their\npresence, which transforms `decent neighbourhoods' into lumpen citadels. `We\nFigure 4. Front-page of Shahrvand: `Life in the Grave'.\ndon't sell anything except nakh `oqabi [one fag of Winston Red, popular brand for\nhomeless and hashish smokers]' laments a shop owner in Darvazeh Ghar. He adds\n`Even mothers who come here buy just half a kilo of lentils; no yogurt, no milk.\nHere, harf-e avvalo e`tiyad dare! [Here, addiction runs the place!]'.\nThe genealogic presence of lumpen life is a durable trait of the neighbourhood,\nwhich in recent years has also seen large philanthropic activities. The presence of\ncivil society groups had in fact become central in this area and public attention had\nreached its zenith when in autumn 2015 several groups of volunteers, humanitarian\ngroups and philanthropic citizens started to bring cooked meals and clothes to the\npark and distributed them among the drug users. I happened to be in the neigh-\nbourhood during a few of these instances. Well-dressed women who attended char-\nitable events taking place in the area would often take large pots of rice and stew\nand distribute them in the park. The courtesy, as it happened, provoked skirmishes\nand fights among the numerous homeless people in the park, who attempted to\nsecure a warm, often sophisticated, Persian dish. Some of the women remained\nbaffled by the violent scenes and would soon walk \u00ad if not run \u00ad out of the park.\nDespite the incident, the area witnessed a steady increase in charitable work. A few\nmonths later, a charity organisation started to paint across Iranian cities, starting\nfrom Tehran, `walls of kindness' (divar-e mehrabani), encouraging Tehranis \u00ad and\nFigure 5. `Marathon' in Harandi Park. Photo by author.\nlater all fellow Iranians \u00ad to bring warm clothes, food and other essential items for\nthose in need.\nThe provision of food and clothes had become also a matter of satire. Detractors\nhold that `the drug addicts are no longer satisfied by bread and egg or bread and\ncheese, but they expect sophisticated food and are spoiled for choice' (Sharq, 2015).\nOthers claimed that public attention is driven by a sentimental piety not grounded\nin a real understanding of the complex situation of drug addiction, especially in the\nHarandi area. In the words reported by a piece on Sharq (2015), this humanitarian\napproach was a type of `addict-nurturing [mo`tadparvari]'. Another public official\ncynically suggested that the provision of food might well be a stratagem used by\nproviders of addiction treatment centres to attract people to their facilities and,\nincidentally, attract public funding to their organisations.\nOn 9 October 2015 I was invited to attend the `First Marathon of Recovered\nFemale Drug Addicts' organised by the House of Sun (khaneh-ye khorshid),\nan event which took place across the four parks of Harandi, Razi, Baharan and\nShush (Figure 5 and 6). On the edge of Harandi Park's southern corner, the House\nof Sun has been active for over two decades in providing free-of-charge services and\nsupport to female drug users and those women seeking refuge. A large crowd of\nwomen (and some men) attended the opening ceremony of the marathon and\nwaited for the start of this seemingly sporting event. Two female players of the\nIranian national football team led a collective session of gymnastic activities, a way\nFigure 6. Left: football players from the Iranian National Team; right: a former homeless\naddict chanting at the marathon. Photo by author.\nto symbolically recover the body of the park from the sight of widespread drug use\nand destitution. Truth be told, the event revealed itself to be not a marathon \u00ad not\neven close \u00ad but rather a public demonstration that brought more than a thousand\nwomen and their sympathetic supporters (like myself) to march inside the park and\nin the middle of the gathering of drug users, among whom there were dozens of\nwomen. The term `marathon', I thought, was probably used to get around the\npoliticisation of the event in the eyes of the municipality, which could have\nregarded a women-led march against drugs as too sensitive a topic.\nLeila Arshad (aka Lily), the main organiser of the event and director of the\nHouse of Sun, had long been working in this neighbourhood. While those attend-\ning the marathon had gathered in the courtyard of the NGO, she held the micro-\nphone and said, `one of our objectives is to catch the attention of the public officials\nand people towards your problems: lack of employment, absent housing, insurance\nand treatment, respect and social inclusion'. A few weeks following the marathon,\na group of 40 men raided the informal camp in Harandi Park, set on fire several\ntents, and attacked a number of street drug users with sticks and clubs. The muni-\ncipality declared that the attack was perpetrated `by the people', denying any\nresponsibility. Others hinted at the lack of responsiveness of the police (Etemad-e\nMelli, 2015). Notwithstanding this occurrence, the attitude of Iranians towards\ncharity has changed significantly over the years. Mendicancy, begging and petty\nvending is accepted less for God's sake and more in exchange for merchandise or\nservices (Asfari, 2016). Philanthropy itself has transmuted and has lost its Islamic\nframework and become more market-oriented. The observation comes to mind of\nFigure 7. Harandi Park: street vendors, street addicts. Photo by author.\nItalian psychiatrist (and reformer) Franco Basaglia who, while visiting New York,\nnoticed on the metro line an advertisement: `Which of these human tragedies do\nyou prefer? Vietnam, Biafra, the Arab-Israeli controversy, the black ghettos,\nhunger in India . . .? Choose yours and help, helping the Red Cross' (Basaglia,\n1971: 71). Despite the rise of philanthropy in favour of homeless drug users, the\neconomy of lumpen drug users does not rely on charity exclusively. To get by, most\nstreet users find ways of making a living in creative and painful ways, as the case of\nReza epitomises.\nReza comes from a well-off family, but he was expelled from his wife's house\nbecause he was addicted to morphine. He now lives in a small room rented in the\nsouth of Tehran, where he carries on his morphine use, plus smoking meth.\nRecently he signed up to a methadone substitution programme and he is now\ntrying to get off both drugs. He speaks frankly with me (while I often found him\nlying to the NGO workers with whom he sometime volunteers): `I still do shisheh\nwhen I visit some old friends; now I'm selling some used stuff which I bartered\nwith a guy. It's a good deal, I'm happy'. Most of the time, he repairs old watches,\nlighters, mobile phones and resells them in the informal markets across Tehran or\nto other drug users he encounters along his path. The situations in which\nhe carries on his business comply with the ruthless rule of capital. `Hey dash\nReza! What's up? Did you make enough money from ripping me off the other\nday? You came and took my watch when I was lying on the ground half-dead,\ndidn't you?' shouts a man while we walk in one of the parks. Reza walks straight\npast without paying attention to the man and explains to me, `he begged me\nto buy it, now he regrets it? Be man che\u00b4, why should I care?' Drug users on a\nhigh or with heavy withdrawal symptoms can be good sellers out of euphoria or\nof desperate need. Reza's mind works quickly and he is always busy doing some-\nthing, whether handling some tech product he bought or calling people to set up\nmeetings, reunions and barter sessions. His economic existence as well as that of\nmany other pauperised drug users fits in the category of `jobs without definition'\n(Bhatt in Denning, 2010: 89). Yet it is about work that one is speaking and not\ncharity or theft, although stolen goods are just as good in this economy.\nChemical calibration was an expedient that Reza used to be more productive.\nMobility and focus helped him not to get lost in the dregs of narcotic dependence.\nThe practice, a leitmotif in my discussions with homeless users, is also common in\nother types of employment. Female drug users face a higher risk in the illegal\nmarket of drugs. Their bodies are an exchange product when monetary capital is\nabsent. Hence, many sex workers make use of methamphetamine (and to a lesser\nextent heroin) to provide better sexual experience to their clients. It is sometimes\nthe case that the client requires the sex worker to consume the drug in company\nbefore sexual intercourse. Meth is a powerful sexual inhibitor and it triggers sexual\nimpulse where desire is absent or recalcitrant. Drugs help to cope with the pain and\ndanger of sexual commerce and, in that way, sex working is likelier to pave the way\nto a strong addiction. Ali Cheraq-qovveh (Ali `Torch'), another young man with\nwhom I carried out my fieldwork, discussed drugs and sex with me, while telling me\nabout his attempts at recovery:\nI learnt a lot because of my drug use, I went to many places, I met many girls, who\notherwise I wouldn't have been able to meet. They didn't have money and were ready\nto give themselves in exchange for drugs, or did not have a place to use and since I had\na room, they would ask me to come there to use and spend time with me. Money,\nI didn't have much, but I had a place and the drugs. At the time, a lot of heroin passed\nthrough my hands and I got some cuts on it, posht-am garm bud, I was on the safe side.\nBut I never dared to take advantage of these girls, I used to tell them, `if you don't\nhave money come and use with me, but don't sell yourself, I can share it with you'.\nIt was nice to have some female company anyway so I didn't mind.\nMohsen's kindness was perhaps a way to keep his reputation clean with me. But his\nnarrative holds water:\nI always kept in consideration God, even during the period when I only used drugs,\nwhen I would beg to get the money, I would still share the drugs with those who\ncouldn't afford it. I was a boy, I could collect rubbish, I could beg, but a girl, can she\ncollect rubbish? Can she beg for money without risk? In these times of ours a girl who\nasks for money to anyone can be taken away, don't you know?\nThe gendered dimension of lumpen life puts female drug users from poor back-\ngrounds in the open market of sex and drugs. In this context, sharing is caring and\nmay imply sexual concessions or friendship, whether to avoid the risk of using in\npublic (when one's safe space is narrow) or to extract enough capital to sustain\none's drug consumption. Sharing, however, is part of the political economy of drug\nuse also in that it establishes lasting bonds of mutuality \u00ad at the risk of contagious\ndiseases such as hepatitis and HIV (Bourgois, 2009). Sharing one's drug with a\ncompanion who lacks the means to buy some or is physically impaired means that\nthe favour might be paid back one rainy day.\nThe economic life of lumpen drug users is made of daily expediencies, such as\nbarter, repairing, collecting abandoned objects, selling minimal items, begging and\nresorting to charity. It is a diverse ecosystem which changes according to personal\nand structural conditions. The use of drugs is not mechanically experienced and\ndriven by a deus ex machina called `addiction'. It is based on what I call `chemical\ncalibration', for instance in the use of shisheh as a productive drug to hustling and\nheroin as a tranquillizer and painkiller amid sheer destitution. Philanthropy is just\none side of the lumpen economy in the city.\nEpilogue\nIf you want to know what it means to be poor, you have to get involved and mix with\nthe poor, if you want to know what is an addict, you have to mix with them. One\ndoesn't know about drugs, take him for a month to the meetings of NA [Narcotic\nAnonymous], or to a treatment camp. Sir ta piazesho bebine\u00b4. Mazi, you've got this\nwork on the addicts, you come from Oxford, you're cool and know all the numbers.\nNow you want to understand how desperate people live? You need to get destroyed in\nit [khurd besham] to understand the life of a desperate addict.\nMohsen's incitement to immerse myself in the discourse of addiction, poverty and\ndangerous life was powerful methodological advice which seconded my theoretical\napproach `from below' and my decision to go ethnographic. This perspective\ndebunks knowledge gathered from elite interviews and epidemiological interpret-\nation of drug abuse, which represent a good deal of studies into drug phenomena,\nincluding in Iran where epidemiology is the standard approach in drug studies.\nTop-down approaches, albeit articulated and linear, eventually reproduce bour-\ngeois images and tropes, their panic, facing lumpen life. Lumpen life as seen from\nbelow reassesses the structural violence, classist xenophobia and everyday agency\nat work in the dangerous existences of people in danger.\nIn the first part of the article, I discussed how structural violence conditions and\nis conditioned by the everyday existence of homeless or precarious drug users. By\nletting the voice of people I carried out fieldwork with `speak' about their daily\noccurrences, desires and expedients, I portrayed an entryway into the addiction and\nanti-narcotic assemblage. Imprecise, messy and disorderly, lumpen narratives \u00ad I\nbelieve \u00ad fill in the gap, with some meaning, between the attempt at theory and the\nempirical existences as captured though the ethnographic gaze. By showing the\necologies in which this group lives and who is part of it, the argument lingered\non the structural violence of which this group is victim. This assemblage is made of\ntheir shanty dwellings \u00ad valleys, parks, graves \u00ad and the institutions of internment \u00ad\nprison, rehab, and morgue. Eventually, I described the economic activities that\nenable lumpen life by exploring the combination of agency and philanthropy. It\nis this panoramic view that invites the reader at an inductive approach to know-\nledge, which is in part a secondment of the ethnographic method that drives the\nanalysis. On this ground, the narrative of the lumpen drug users can be revelatory\nof the faultlines and rationales that, in praxis, govern `addiction' and the making of\nthe poor into a dangerous class. Their fantasises, desires and pain \u00ad and even lies \u00ad\nmay hold truths well beyond the word of the law and the statistical records of\npolitico-medical agents. It might be the case that, as Michael Taussig has sug-\ngested, `not the basic truths, not the Being nor the ideologies of the center, but\nthe fantasies of the marginalised concerning the secret of the center are what is\nmost politically important to the State idea and hence State fetishism.'
