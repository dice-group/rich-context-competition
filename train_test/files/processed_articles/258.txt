Most children re-\nceive at least 1 dose of the routinely rec-\nommended vaccines late, and only 42% of\nchildren complete a basic series of vacci-\nnations (4 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis\n[DTP], 3 polio, and 1 measles, mumps, and\nrubella [MMR] vaccinations) at the rec-\nommended ages.3 These delays are not\ntrivial; one third of all children are under-\nvaccinated for more than 6 months.4 Im-\nmunization delays increase the risk of dis-\nease outbreak and are markers for\ninadequate receipt of other preventive ser-\nvices.5 For these reasons, age-appropri-\nate immunization is a more accurate in-\ndicator of adequate immunization than\nwhether immunizations have been re-\nTimely immunization depends on both\nappropriate access to health care and the\nadministration of eligible doses at each\nvisit.

One prior\nstudy reported an association between parental satisfac-\ntion with pediatric care and up-to-date immunization at\n24 months independent of maternal age, race, and edu-\ncation12 but did not establish temporal ordering. It is also\nnot clear whether the potential relationship between pa-\nrental satisfaction and children's immunization is the re-\nsult of greater age-appropriate well-child care utiliza-\ntion or of some combination of parental and health care\nprovider vigilance. In addition to promoting appropri-\nate utilization, satisfaction may increase engagement in\nthe health care process. Research on parental health be-\nliefs and attitudes often assumes that parents decline im-\nmunization or are simply less knowledgeable and per-\nsistent in the health care setting without also examining\ntheir access and timely utilization of well-child care.24-26\nThe present study prospectively investigates the re-\nlationship between parental satisfaction with care and\ntimely childhood vaccination in a large and diverse sample.\nWe examine whether satisfaction with early pediatric care\nis related to timely and adequate immunization during the\nfirst 2 years of life, and if so, whether this relationship is\nmediated by greater utilization of age-appropriate well-\nchild care.\nThis study relies on prospective data collected as part\nof a national evaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Chil-\ndren--a pediatric practice\u00adbased intervention designed\nto promote developmentally appropriate parenting prac-\ntices by providing enhanced developmental services in\nthe first 3 years of life.27 The evaluation followed a co-\nacross the US from the child's birth to age 3 years.27-29 In\ncontrast to other national surveys, such as the National\nSurvey of Early Childhood Health or the Consumer As-\nsessment of Health Plan Satisfaction, this data set pro-\nvides a unique opportunity to longitudinally evaluate the\nrelationship between parental satisfaction with early pe-\ndiatric care and subsequent vaccination.\nMETHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nThe study sample included 4756 families who enrolled in\ncompleted an interview at 2 to 4 months, and had abstracted\nterviewed at 2 to 4 months (88%). Medical records were ab-\nstracted for 4756 (97%) of these families, yielding overall in-\nclusion of 85% of the initial cohort.\nInstitutional review board approval was obtained for this\nstudy from The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public\nHealth Committee on Human Research. Informed consent was\nobtained at the time of enrollment and reviewed prior to the\ninterview.\nThree data sources inform these analyses: an enrollment par-\nent questionnaire, a parent interview at 2 to 4 months, and medi-\ncal records. At enrollment (within 28 days of birth), a brief ques-\ntionnaire provided sociodemographic data about both parents\nand the infant. At 2 to 4 months, information was obtained\nthrough a telephone interview with parents, primarily the\nmother, regarding services received, satisfaction with ser-\nvices, and maternal health care utilization. The interviews were\nconducted in English or Spanish by trained interviewers. Medi-\ncal records were abstracted up to 32 months of age to obtain\ninformation on the frequency and timing of well-child visits\nand immunizations. A random sample of approximately 5% of\nrecords was reabstracted at each site with agreement of 87%\nor higher for visit type, 96% or higher for visit date, 99% or\nhigher for vaccine type, and 98% or higher for vaccine date.\nDichotomous age-appropriate immunization measures were con-\nstructed according to minimum age and spacing guidelines of\nthe 1997 American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book,30 the edi-\ntion in use when the majority of study children were eligible\nfor immunization (Table 1). Three age-appropriate measures--\nfirst dose of DTP (DTP1), third dose of DTP (DTP3), and\nMMR--and 1 up-to-date measure of 4 doses of DTP, 3 doses\nof polio, and 1 dose of MMR vaccination at 24 months were\nanalyzed. First dose DTP, DTP3, and MMR were chosen to rep-\nresent different ages at vaccination (2, 6, and 12 months, re-\nspectively).\nParental satisfaction with pediatric care was evaluated with\na global measure assessed when the child was 2 to 4 months\nold. Parents were asked to rate doctors and nurses at their site\nof care in \"providing good health care since [their baby] left\nthe hospital after birth,\" with responses grouped as excellent,\ngood, or fair/poor. This measure corresponds with the global\nmeasure included in Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Sat-\nisfaction and the National Survey of Early Childhood Health,\nwhich asks parents to rate their child's health care on a scale\nfrom 0 to 10 (10 indicating the best possible care). The corre-\nlation coefficients between the global satisfaction measure and\nother multiple-item scales of satisfaction with provider listen-\ning and time spent with the provider were high in our sample,\ndemonstrating construct validity.\nutilization variables15-19 related to immunization were exam-\nined as confounders. Maternal age, education, race/ethnicity,\nmarital status, and first-trimester prenatal care were obtained\nfrom the newborn questionnaire at enrollment. Home owner-\nship, the infant's health insurance and health status, house-\nhold income, number of siblings, and maternal postpartum visit\nwere reported by parents in an interview at 2 to 4 months. House-\nhold income was imputed for families with missing data (7%)\nby using monthly housing costs and a series of covariates. An-\nnual income was divided into earning tertiles: less than $20 000,\nThe main measures of age-appropriate well-child care uti-\nlization were the timely receipt of the 2-month visit and the\ntotal number of age-appropriate well-child visits completed by\n24 months, as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics\nschedule of preventive health care (Table 1).33 The receipt of\nearly age-appropriate care is strongly related to later up-to-\ndate immunization status.7 To control for age-appropriate well-\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nchild care utilization in regression models of immunization and\nsatisfaction, we used the number of age-appropriate well-\nchild care visits received by the last date possible to receive the\nimmunization age appropriately. Because a visit within the first\nmonth of life was nearly universal in our sample (97%), the\n1-month age-appropriate well-child care visit was excluded from\nthe total count of age-appropriate well-child care visits.\nDenominators for each vaccination and well-child care out-\ncome were determined by the children's time in practice--a mea-\nsure combining the age at last visit with information provided\nby parents at 30 to 33 months about their child's regular source\nof care and when they left the practice, if the Healthy Steps site\nwas no longer their regular source. Time in practice refers to\nthe length of time in days that children were active patients at\nthe Healthy Steps site. Analyses of the age-appropriate vacci-\nnation and well-child care\u00adutilization outcomes included chil-\ndren whose time in practice exceeded the oldest age allowable\nto receive the dose or visit within the recommended age win-\ndow. This resulted in analysis of children who could be con-\nsidered patients of the practice throughout the period neces-\nsary to receive the dose or visit.\nBivariate associations between reported satisfaction and im-\nmunization outcomes; satisfaction and the aforementioned co-\nvariates; and immunization and the covariates were examined\nwith 2 test statistics. Multivariate regression models were per-\nformed to explore the independent association between satis-\nfaction with care and each immunization outcome and media-\ntion by age-appropriate well-child care utilization. Following\ntests for mediation proposed by Baron and Kenny,34 we first\nevaluated whether parental satisfaction with care was indepen-\ndently related to the mediator of age-appropriate well-child care\nutilization using logistic (2-month visit) and Poisson (total num-\nber of age-appropriate visits by 24 months) regression analy-\nses. We next examined the relationship between satisfaction\nand immunization outcomes adjusting for associated sociode-\nmographic and maternal health care\u00adutilization variables (model\n1). We then added the number of age-appropriate well-child\nvisits received (model 2) to evaluate mediation of the relation-\nship between satisfaction and immunization by examining the\ncoefficient change. All models controlled for the receipt of the\nHealthy Steps intervention and the practice site. Fixed effects\nwere used to control for unobserved differences between sites.\nMissing data did not exceed 3% for any variable. Two di-\nchotomous variables were included in adjusted models to ac-\ncount for missing data: unknown prenatal care entry (3%) and\nunknown for other covariates with less than 1% data missing\n(2%). All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute Inc,\nCary, NC).\nRESULTS\nAmong study mothers, 13% were teenagers, 16% had not\ncompleted high school, and 66% were married (Table 2).\nEighty percent of mothers initiated prenatal care in the\nfirst trimester and almost 90% returned for a postpar-\ntum visit. Similarly, 88% of infants received the 2-month\nage-appropriate well-child visit.\nSatisfaction with care was high. Two thirds of moth-\ners reported their infant's health care as excellent, 27%\nas good, and only 4% as fair or poor (Table 2). Immu-\nnization levels ranged from more than 90% for age-\nappropriate initiation of the DTP series to 72% for\nage-appropriate DTP3 and up-to-date vaccination levels\nTable 1.

In addition,\nmothers who were less satisfied with their infant's health\ncare were less likely to use health care for themselves and\ntheir infant (Table 2). Children whose parents reported\nfair/poor care averaged 2 fewer age-appropriate well-\nchild visits in the first 2 years of life than children whose\nparents reported excellent care.\nSatisfaction with care was associated with all immu-\nnization measures examined, with much lower percent-\nages observed among children whose mothers reported\nfair/poor care relative to those reporting good or excel-\nlent care (Table 3). Only 58% of children whose parents\nwere dissatisfied with their children's health care were\nup to date at 24 months compared with 73% among those\nwhose parents reported excellent care.\nTable 2.

Compared with\nchildren of parents who reported excellent satisfaction\nwith care, children of parents reporting fair/poor satis-\nfaction were significantly less likely to have obtained the\nage-appropriate 2-month well-child visit and had sig-\nnificantly fewer total age-appropriate visits by 24 months\nof age. Children of parents who reported good satisfac-\ntion with care were not significantly different from chil-\ndren of parents reporting excellent satisfaction in their\nreceipt of age-appropriate well-child care.\nAdjusting for related sociodemographic characteristics and\nmaternal health care utilization, children whose parents\nreported fair/poor care had markedly lower odds of hav-\ning received all immunization outcomes relative to chil-\ndren whose mothers reported excellent care (odds ratios,\nnumber of age-appropriate well-child visits received, fair/\npoor satisfaction with care was no longer significantly re-\nlated to any of the immunization outcomes, indicating that\nthe effect of fair/poor satisfaction was mediated by re-\nduced age-appropriate well-child care utilization.\nCOMMENT\nThe findings of this analysis suggest that early satisfac-\ntion with care is independently related to both age-\nappropriate and up-to-date immunization, despite asso-\nciations with a variety of sociodemographic risk factors,\nreported infant health status, and maternal health care\u00ad\nTable 3.

The early nature of this effect is simi-\nlar to that observed for age-appropriate DTP1 vaccina-\ntion on later immunization7,36 and may be useful for the\nearly identification of children at greater risk of inad-\nequate immunization. Infants of parents who were less\nsatisfied with their pediatric care at 2 to 4 months of age\nhad significantly lower odds of immunization for all vac-\ncine outcomes examined through the first 2 years of life.\nThis relationship appeared to be mediated by reduced\nwell-child care utilization; parents who were less satis-\nfied with their children's health care were less likely to\nbring their children in for age-appropriate care. This find-\ning is consistent with results from the National Survey\nof Early Childhood Health, which demonstrate a strong\nnegative relationship between parental global satisfac-\ntion ratings and missed or delayed pediatric care.37\nDissatisfaction with care was strongly related to in-\nadequate immunization; the population of dissatisfied par-\nents may warrant greater attention. Understanding the\nsources of dissatisfaction and other barriers to utiliza-\ntion of this subgroup is critical for targeted interven-\ntions. Several studies, including our own, have shown\nthat parental global satisfaction is highly related to sat-\nisfaction with physician communication skills (eg, lis-\ntening and answering all questions) and the length of time\nspent during well-child visits.37,38 As the level and sources\nof dissatisfaction may vary according to provider and set-\nting, investigations should be context specific. A recent\nsurvey of personnel at a variety of pediatric settings found\nthat the most common quality improvement initiative in-\nvolved efforts to increase patient satisfaction through base-\nline surveys and tailored interventions.39 It is important\nto note that only inclusion of the total number of age-\nappropriate well-child visits received, rather than re-\nceipt of the 2-month age-appropriate well-child visit alone,\naccounted for the relationship between satisfaction and\nimmunization outcomes (data not shown). This sug-\ngests that interventions designed to improve the immu-\nnization of children whose parents are dissatisfied with\ntheir care must be sustained and not simply confined to\nan early period of several months.\nThe significance of these findings is tempered by the\nsmall percentage of parents who were dissatisfied with\ntheir child's care. Although the high level of satisfaction\nwith children's health care is consistent with other re-\nsentative of all pediatric practices. The level of dissatis-\nfaction varied considerably among the sites, ranging\nfrom 2% to 8%, suggesting that the relevance of quality\nimprovement initiatives and/or targeting dissatisfied\nparents may be site specific. Broader efforts to improve\nparent satisfaction may also enhance compliance with\nmedical regimens43 and reduce the risk of malpractice\nlitigation,44,45 in addition to improving preventive ser-\nvices utilization.\nThere are several limitations to this study. While we\nmade considerable efforts to establish the temporal se-\nquence between satisfaction and subsequent immuniza-\ntion and to control for predisposing maternal health care\u00ad\nseeking behavior, it is possible that the observed\nassociation is the result of other factors related to both\nsatisfaction appraisal and health care utilization. How-\never, the magnitude of the association amidst a range of\ncontrol variables highly associated with both satisfac-\ntion and immunization reduces the likelihood of this pos-\nsibility. Regardless of causality, parental dissatisfaction\nwith care identifies a group of children significantly less\nlikely to receive age-appropriate preventive care who war-\nrant greater attention and targeted intervention.\nThe inability to directly compare the level of satisfac-\ntion in our sample with others highlights another study\nlimitation. Our global measure of satisfaction is similar to\nthequestionsusedbyConsumerAssessmentofHealthPlan\nSatisfactionandNationalSurveyofEarlyChildhoodHealth\nbut has a more restricted response range--from 1 to 4, as\nopposed to from 0 to 10. The magnitude of the effect of\nfair/poorsatisfactionwithcareinrelationtoup-to-datevac-\ncination levels (4 DTP, 3 polio, and 1 MMR by 24 months),\nhowever, is similar to the effect of less satisfaction ob-\nserved by Bates and Wolinsky,12 supporting the reliabil-\nity of our results. We also examined other, more specific\nmeasures of satisfaction with care, including scales of\nsatisfaction with provider listening, time, help, and ad-\nvice, but the global measure of satisfaction was more\nstrongly and consistently related to immunization. Thus,\nuse of a global measure of satisfaction with care may be\nefficient and helpful in identifying children who are less\nlikely to receive preventive services.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study show that parents' satisfaction\nwith their child's health care at an early age is related to\nthe child's later immunization, independent of sociode-\nmographic characteristics, infant health status, and pat-\nterns of maternal health care utilization. The associa-\ntion between fair/poor satisfaction with care and reduced\nreceipt of timely and up-to-date immunization ap-\npeared to be mediated by reduced utilization of age-\nappropriate well-child care. Although dissatisfaction was\nrelatively uncommon among parents in this study, fu-\nture research might determine whether other widely used\nmeasures of satisfaction yield greater variability and pre-\ndictive value in relation to immunization. Our global mea-\nsure of satisfaction was more strongly related to immu-\nnization than other measures of satisfaction and is\nconducive to rapid assessment at clinical sites. Parental\nsatisfaction is frequently measured by providers in some\nform for quality assessment and may have unantici-\npated value in identifying children who are less likely to\nreceive age-appropriate preventive care.\nCorrespondence: Ashley H.
