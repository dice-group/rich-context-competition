This study has 2 ad-\nvantages: (1) a stratified, random sample, large enough\nto compare sex, racial/ethnic, and age groups; and (2) a\nstandardized measure of PTSD, the Diagnostic Inter-\nview Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV).\nMETHODS\nParticipants were part of the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a\nat the Cook County (Illinois) Juvenile Temporary Detention\nCenter (CCJTDC) in Chicago. The random sample was strati-\nfied by sex, race/ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic\nwhite, Hispanic), age (10-13 years or 14 years), and legal sta-\ntus (processed as a juvenile or as an adult) to obtain enough\nparticipants to examine key subgroups (eg, females, Hispan-\nics, and younger children).\nThe CCJTDC received approximately 8500 admissions each\nyear during the time data were collected (John Howard Asso-\nciation, unpublished data, 1992). The CCJTDC is used solely\nfor pretrial detention and for offenders sentenced for fewer than\n30 days. All detainees younger than 17 years are held at the\nCCJTDC, including youth processed as adults (automatic trans-\nfers to adult court). Youth up to the age of 21 years may be de-\ntained in the CCJTDC if they are being prosecuted for an ar-\nrest that occurred when they were younger than 17 years.\nLike juvenile detainees nationwide,25 approximately 90%\nof the CCJTDC detainees are male; most are racial/ethnic mi-\nnorities. The population of the CCJTDC is 77.9% African Ameri-\nracial/ethnic groups. The age and offense distributions of the\nCCJTDC detainees are also similar to detained juveniles na-\nWe chose the detention center in Cook County (which\nincludes Chicago and surrounding suburbs) for 3 reasons. First,\nnationwide, most juvenile detainees live in and are detained\nin urban areas.26 Second, Cook County is ethnically diverse and\nhas the third largest Hispanic population in the United States.27\nStudying Hispanics is important because they are the largest\nminority group in the United States28 and they are overrepre-\nsented in the justice systems.25 Third, the detention center's size\n(daily census of approximately 650 youth and intake of 20 youth\nper day) ensured that enough participants would be available.\nNo single site can represent the entire country because ju-\nrisdictions may have different options for diversion.29,30 Nev-\nertheless, Illinois' criteria for detaining juveniles are similar to\nother states'.29 All states allow pretrial detention if the juvenile\nneeds protection, is likely to flee, or is considered a danger to\nDetainees were eligible to be sampled, regardless of\ntheir psychiatric morbidity, state of drug or alcohol intoxica-\ntion, or fitness to stand trial. Within each stratum, we used a\nrandom numbers table to select names from the CCJTDC's\nintake log. Throughout the study, we tracked how many\nparticipants were still needed to fill each cell. Project staff\nsampled the rarest categories first. The final sampling frac-\non the sample is available from us.)\nStudying detained youth requires special procedures be-\ncause they are minors, because they are detained, and because\nmany do not have a parent or guardian who can provide appro-\npriate consent.31 Project staff approached participants on their\nunits, explained the project, and assured them that anything they\ntold us (except acute suicidal or homicidal risk) would be con-\nfidential. Participants signed either an assent form (if they were\n18 years) or a consent form (if they were 18 years). Federal\nregulations allow parental consent to be waived if the research\nstitutional Review Board, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention Institutional Review Board, and the US Office of Pro-\ntection from Research Risks waived parental consent. However,\nas ethicists recommend, we nevertheless tried to contact par-\nents to provide them an opportunity to decline participation and\nDespite repeated attempts to contact the parent or guardian, for\n43.8% of the participants, none could be found. In lieu of pa-\nrental consent, youth assent was overseen by an independent par-\nticipant advocate representing the interests of the participants.\nFederal regulations allow for a participant advocate if parental\nWe began collecting data on PTSD 13 months after the\nlarger study began. Of the 1148 names selected, 34 detainees\n(3.0%) refused to participate in the study. There were no sig-\nnificant differences in refusal rates by sex, race/ethnicity, or age.\nTwo youth were released before finishing the interview; 189\nyouth left the CCJTDC while we were locating their caretak-\ners for consent or before we could schedule an interview; 25\nyouth were released after consent was obtained but before the\ninterview commenced. The final sample size was 898 and com-\nHispanic (28.1%), and 2 others (0.2%). Participants ranged in\nParticipants were interviewed in a private area, almost al-\nways within 2 days of intake. Most interviews lasted 2 to 3 hours,\ndepending on how many symptoms were reported. We used both\nmale and female interviewers. Female participants were always\ninterviewed by female interviewers. Interviewers were trained for\nat least 1 month; most had a master's degree in psychology or an\nassociated field and experience interviewing high-risk youth. One\nthird of our interviewers were fluent in Spanish.

The DISC\nis the most widely used diagnostic instrument for child and ado-\nlescent research.38 It is especially useful for large-scale epide-\nmiologic studies because it is relatively brief; it can be adminis-\ntered by nonclinicians; it is designed to assess youth who have\nand have not been traumatized; and it generates DSM-IV disor-\nders using computerized scoring.\nThe PTSD module assesses whether youth have ever ex-\nperienced any of the 8 traumatic experiences listed in Table 1.\nParticipants then identify the event that was \"the most diffi-\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.

These estimates are lower\nthan those reported by Burton et al14 (24%, current dis-\nand Steiner et al13 (31.7% of males, current disorder), per-\nhaps because our instruments and methods are differ-\nent. Burton et al14 used a symptom checklist adminis-\ntered to small groups. Cauffman et al15 and Steiner et al13\nused the PTSD module of the Revised Psychiatric Diag-\nnostic Interview.50 The Revised Psychiatric Diagnostic In-\nterview assesses symptoms of PTSD independent of a par-\nticular trauma. In contrast, the DISC, like most\ninstruments, assesses PTSD based on the participant's per-\nceived worst trauma.\nThe prevalence of PTSD in our sample was higher\nthan reported by Garland et al20 (3.1%, past year) and\nWasserman et al4 (4.8%, males only, past month), who\nused the DISC, and Duclos et al19 (1.3%, past year), who\nused a modified version of the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI); the CIDI is similar in struc-\nture to the DISC. Our findings and those of prior stud-\nies may differ because of the point at which the sample\nwas drawn. We sampled youth right after they were de-\ntained, and before their adjudication hearings. Garland\net al20 and Wasserman et al4 sampled convicted juve-\nniles in secure placement. The findings of Duclos et al19\nmay be different from ours because their sample was com-\nposed only of American Indian detainees.\nThe prevalence of PTSD in our sample (during the\n12 months prior to the interview) exceeds lifetime esti-\nmates of PTSD reported in community samples of youth\nparticipants with PTSD had reported witnessing violence\nas the precipitant.

We do not know the conditional risk of\nspecific traumas in our sample because the DISC-IV, like\nmost instruments, assesses PTSD only for the worst\ntrauma.6 Second, traumatic experiences can precipitate\nother conditions besides PTSD, for example, disruptive\nbehavior disorders, other internalizing disorders, some\npersonality disorders, and physical illnesses.37 These dis-\norders are common in our sample.3,35 Third, prevalence\nof PTSD may have been higher had we asked about a wider\nrange of traumas, used more than 1 screen question to\nask about sexual abuse or other types of intimate vio-\nlence, or conducted interviews using techniques that al-\nMost demographic differences corroborated prior in-\nmale detainees were significantly more likely than fe-\nmale detainees to have experienced trauma, female de-\ntainees were as likely to have PTSD as were male detain-\nees. In community samples, females are twice as likely\nas males to develop PTSD following exposure to trauma.6\nLike prior studies in the community, we found few\nracial/ethnic differences in rates of trauma or PTSD.5,10\nThose few differences pertained to the type of trauma re-\nported most frequently. In our sample, African Ameri-\ncan males were more likely to have witnessed violence\nthan were non-Hispanic whites, consistent with the high\nlevels of violence exposure among inner-city, minority\nyouth.62 Non-Hispanic white males were more likely to\nhave experienced actual and threatened violence than\nother males. Among females, Hispanics were most likely\nto have experienced violent victimization.\nLIMITATIONS\nOur findings are drawn from 1 site and may pertain\nonly to youth in urban detention centers with similar\ndemographic composition. Moreover, our findings are\nbased on a sample of pretrial detainees and may not be\ngeneralizable to adjudicated juveniles serving sen-\ntences.\nBecause it was not feasible to interview caretakers,\nour data are subject to the reliability and validity of the\nyouths' self-report. However, youth and their caretak-\ners are comparable reporters of youths' anxiety disor-\nders.63 Recall of traumas may be affected by arrest and\ndetention; yet, recall of events by youth may be less sub-\nject to the distortions of time than recall by adults.5 More-\nover, the DISC--like most measures--probes for PTSD\nfor the single-worst trauma; hence, we are unable to es-\ntimate the age of onset of PTSD or the vulnerability to\nPTSD by type of trauma.6 Despite these limitations, our\nstudy has implications for research on PTSD and for men-\ntal health policy.\nWe suggest 3 directions for future research.\n1. Studies of vulnerability to PTSD in high-risk\nyouth. Although more than 90% of our sample were ex-\nposed to 1 or more traumas, only 11.2% of the sample\nmet criteria for PTSD in the past year. We need to de-\ntermine the relative risk of PTSD for types of trauma (eg,\nwitnessing murder, being shot, witnessing ongoing do-\nmestic violence, sudden loss of a loved one) among youth\nwho are frequently exposed to trauma and violence, such\nas our participants. Such studies could document fac-\ntors that increase resilience to PTSD among high-risk\nyouth and guide prevention strategies.64,65\n2. Studies of chronic community violence and its\nrelationship to PTSD. Community violence is epidemic\nin inner cities.62 Research suggests that chronic expo-\nsure to violence may have more deleterious effects on chil-\ndren than acute violence.62 We must study the effects of\nchronic community violence on high-risk youth as they\nbecome adults.17 Longitudinal studies should examine the\nrole that witnessing violence plays in perpetuating the\ncycle of violence.\n3. DefinitionoftraumaanddiagnosisofPTSD.There\nis a scarcity of research on the validity and reliability of di-\nagnostic measures of PTSD, in part because the diagnosis\nis relatively new.37 Moreover, the definitions of trauma in\nDSM-IV are somewhat ambiguous66; hence, there is little\nconsistency among diagnostic instruments that measure\ntraumas. For example, most measures assess violent vic-\ntimization (DISC-IV, CIDI 2.1)67; others also assess trauma\nfrom perpetration of violence (R. C. Kessler, PhD, Na-\ntional Comorbidity Study--Replication, unpublished data,\nanyperpetrator(DISC-IV,CIDI2.1);othersspecificallyask\nabout victimization by family members (DIS-IV,68 Na-\ntional Comorbidity Study--Replication). These differ-\nences reduce the validity and reliability of diagnoses. We\nneed a consensually understood and empirically vali-\ndated framework to define and measure traumatic\nThe mental health system must\n1. Improve services for victims of trauma. Expo-\nsure to trauma is a serious public health problem among\nhigh-risk youth. Yet, services are insufficient.43 Timely\ninterventions may avert subsequent and often chronic so-\ncial problems common among traumatized youth.8,16,62\nTo the extent that PTSD is correlated with subsequent\nviolent perpetration, effective treatment is also a matter\n2. ImprovethedetectionofPTSD.TheSurgeonGen-\neral'sreportonchildren'smentalhealthsuggeststhatemer-\ngency medical providers must address the mental health\nneeds of youth who have experienced trauma.74 Posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder is frequently overlooked even in the\nbest psychiatric settings.75,76 Because PTSD frequently co-\noccurs with other psychiatric disorders,10,16 it can be dif-\nficult to detect without systematic screening.\n3.

The conditions of\nconfinement often exacerbate symptoms of mental disor-\nder, including PTSD.77 Juvenile justice providers must also\nreduce the likelihood that youth will be retraumatized dur-\ning routine processing.
