Face-to-face interviews were carried out by\nprofessional interviewers from the Institute for Social Research\nattheUniversityofMichigan,AnnArbor,betweenFebruary2001\nadministered in two parts. Part I included a core diagnostic as-\nsessment of all respondents (n=9282) that took an average of\nabout 1 hour to administer. Part II included questions about risk\nfactors, consequences, other correlates, and additional disor-\nders. In an effort to reduce respondent burden and control study\nrespondents, including all part I respondents with a lifetime dis-\norder plus a probability subsample of other respondents. Inter-\nviewers explained the study and obtained verbal informed con-\nsent prior to beginning each interview. Recruitment and consent\nwere approved by the Human Subjects Committees of Harvard\nMedical School, Boston, Mass, and the University of Michigan.\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nThe NCS-R diagnoses are based on the World Mental Health\nSurvey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Com-\nposite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI),6 a fully\nstructured lay-administered diagnostic interview that gener-\nates both International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-\nsion,7 and DSM-IV8 diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria are used here.\nDiagnoses include anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agora-\nphobia without panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder), mood\ndisorders (major depressive disorder, dysthymia, bipolar I and\nII disorders), a series of four disorders that share a common\nfeature of difficulty with impulse control (intermittent explo-\nsive disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disor-\nder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and four sub-\nstance use disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, alcohol\ndependence, drug dependence). Posttraumatic stress disor-\nder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, drug abuse, and drug de-\npendence were included in part II because they all required ex-\ntensive introductory questions that precluded the quick skipout\nof noncases that we wanted in part I. The four disorders that\nrequire onset of symptoms in childhood (separation anxiety dis-\norder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and at-\ntention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) were also included in part\nII and limited to respondents in the age range of 18 to 44 years\nbecause of concerns about recall bias among older respon-\ndents. All other disorders were included in part I. Organic ex-\nclusion rules and hierarchy rules were used to make all diag-\nnoses other than the diagnoses of substance use disorders.\nSubstance use disorders were diagnosed without hierarchy in\nthe recognition that abuse often is a stage in the progression to\ndependence.BlindclinicalreinterviewswiththeStructuredClini-\ncal Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)9 (Table 1) generally were\nin good concordance with WMH-CIDI diagnoses for anxiety,\nmood, and substance use disorders. Impulse-control diag-\nnoses were not validated.\nRetrospective age-of-onset reports were obtained in the\nWMH-CIDI using a series of questions designed to avoid the\nimplausible response patterns obtained when using the stan-\ndard CIDI age-of-onset question.10 The sequence began with a\nquestion designed to emphasize the importance of accurate re-\nsponses: \"Can you remember your exact age the very first time\nyou (HAD THE SYNDROME)?\" Respondents who answered\n\"no\" were probed for a bound of uncertainty by moving up the\nage range incrementally (eg, \"Was it before you first started\nschool?\" \"Was it before you became a teenager?\"). Age of on-\nset was set at the upper end of the bound (eg, age 12 years for\nrespondents who reported that onset was before they became\nTable 1.

Experimental research has shown that this se-\nquence of questions yields responses with a much more plau-\nsible age-of-onset distribution than the standard CIDI age-of-\nonset question.11 Although age-of-onset questions were asked\nabout both important symptoms (eg, first panic attack) and full\nsyndromes, the ages used herein are for syndromes.\nPredictor Variables\nPredictor variables included cohort (defined by age at inter-\n(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other),\n16 years of education), and marital status (married/\ncohabitating, previously married, never married). Marital sta-\ntus was coded for each year of each respondent's life. Educa-\ntion was also coded as a time-varying predictor by assuming\nan orderly educational history, with 8 years of education cor-\nresponding to being a student up to age 14 years, and with other\ndurations based on this benchmark.\nThe data were weighted to adjust for differential probabilities\nof selection, differential nonresponse, and residual differences\nin sociodemographic variables between the sample and tract-\nlevel 2000 US Census population. An additional part II weight\nadjusted for oversampling of part I cases. Weighting is de-\nscribed in more detail elsewhere.1\nLifetime prevalence was estimated as the proportion of re-\nspondents who had ever had a given disorder up to their age at\ninterview. Age of onset and projected lifetime risk as of age 75\nyears were estimated using the two-part actuarial method imple-\nmented in SAS version 8.2.12 The actuarial method differs from\nthe more familiar Kaplan-Meier4 method in using a more ac-\ncurate way of estimating onset within a given year.5 This method\nassumes constant conditional risk of onset during a given year\nof life across cohorts.\nSociodemographic predictors were examined using dis-\ncrete-time survival analysis with person-years as the unit of\nanalysis.13 Sociodemographic variables that change over time\n(educational attainment, marital status) were treated as time-\nvarying predictors. Changes in the effects of predictors across\ncohort were evaluated by including interactions between pre-\ndictors and cohort.\nStandard errors of prevalence estimates and survival coef-\nficients were estimated using the Taylor series linearization\nmethod14 implemented in the SUDAAN software system.15 Mul-\ntivariate significance tests were made with Wald 2 tests using\nTaylor series design-based coefficient variance-covariance ma-\ntrices. Standard errors of lifetime risk estimates were esti-\nmated using the jackknife repeated replication method16 imple-\nmented in a SAS macro.12 All significance tests were evaluated\nat .05 with two-sided tests.\nRESULTS\nThe most prevalent lifetime disorders (Table 2) were\nety disorders were the most prevalent class of disorders\nmood disorders (20.8%), and substance use disorders\n(14.6%). The lifetime prevalence of any disorder was\ntime disorders and 17.3% had three or more.\nPrevalence estimates varied significantly with age for\nall but a handful of disorders. A monotonic increase in\nprevalence was generally found from the youngest (18-29\nyears) to a higher (for the most part, 30-44 years) age\ngroup and then a decline in the older age group(s). Preva-\nlence was always lowest, sometimes substantially so, in\nthe oldest age group (60 years). The most dramatic dif-\nferences of this sort were for drug abuse and drug de-\npendence, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bipolar I and\nIIdisorders.Prevalencedifferencesweremuchlessmarked\namong the other three age groups.\nThe distributions of cumulative lifetime risk estimates\nwere standardized and examined for fixed percentiles\n(Table 3). Two patterns emerged. First, the median age\nof onset (ie, 50th percentile on the age-of-onset distri-\nbution) was much earlier for anxiety disorders (age 11\nyears) and impulse-control disorders (age 11 years) than\nfor substance use disorders (age 20 years) and mood dis-\norders (age 30 years). Second, age of onset was concen-\ntrated in a very narrow age range for most disorders, with\ninterquartile ranges (IQRs) (ie, the number of years be-\ntween the 25th and 75th percentiles of the age-of-onset\ndistributions) of only 8 years (age 7-15 years) for impulse-\ncontrol disorders, 9 years (age 18-27 years) for sub-\nstance use disorders, and 15 years (age 6-2 years) for anxi-\nfor mood disorders.\nMostdisorder-specificage-of-onsetdistributionsshared\nimportant features with other disorders in their class. In\nparticular, the median age of onset was earlier for each\nimpulse-control disorder (age 7-15 years) than for any\ndisorder, while the IQR was consistently narrower for each\nof the impulse-control (1-6 years) and substance use (6-12\nyears) disorders than for any mood disorder (25-26 years).\nThe age-of-onset distributions of anxiety disorders were\nmore diverse, with specific phobia and separation anxi-\nety disorder having very early median ages of onset (age\n7 years) and very narrow IQRs (4-7 years), social pho-\nbia having a later median age of onset (age 13 years) and\na narrow IQR range (7 years), and other anxiety disor-\nders having much later median ages of onset (age 19-31\nyears) and much wider IQRs (16-27 years).\nProjected lifetime risk as of age 75 years based on the age-\nof-onset distributions (Table 3) was 9% higher than life-\ntime prevalence estimates reported in Table 2 for anxiety\ndisorders, 34% higher for mood disorders, 2% higher for\nimpulse-control disorders, 12% higher for substance use\ndisorders, and 9% higher for any disorder. Predictably, dis-\norders with the largest increases between prevalence and\nprojected risk were those with late age-of-onset distribu-\ntions: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety dis-\norder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Consistent with\nthe prevalence data, projected risk was highest for anxi-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

The odds ratios (ORs) were\nstatistically significant in the vast majority of compari-\nsons, with a consistent positive association between re-\ncency of cohort and OR of onset (Table 4). The largest\ncohort effects were associated with drug use disorders\nand the smallest with phobias and childhood-onset im-\npulse-control disorders.\nThe cohort model was elaborated to evaluate whether\nintercohort differences decreased significantly with in-\ncreasing age, a pattern that might be expected either if\nlifetime risk was actually constant across cohorts but ap-\npeared to vary with cohort because onsets occurred ear-\nlier in more recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts (due\nto either secular changes in environmental triggers or age-\nrelated differences in age-of-onset recall accuracy) or if\ndifferential mortality had an increasingly severe effect on\nsample selection bias with increasing age. Differences were\nexamined separately for first onsets in the age ranges 1\nthese age intervals being the upper end of the age distri-\nbution of the second-oldest cohort quartile, making it im-\npossible to study intercohort differences beyond this age.\nNo evidence of decreasing cohort effects with increas-\ning age was found for anxiety or mood disorders\n(Table 5).

Marital disruption was associated with 3 of\nthe 4 classes of disorder, the exception being impulse-\ncontrol disorder.\nTo determine whether increasing prevalence in more\nrecent cohorts was concentrated in certain population\nsegments, we also examined whether sociodemo-\ngraphic correlates varied by cohort. Although at least\none significant interaction was found for each sociode-\nmographic predictor, the pattern was not consistent\n(results available on request from the authors). The\nmost notable results were as follows: Sex differences in\nanxiety, mood, and impulse-control disorders did not\ndiffer across cohorts, but women were more similar to\nmen in substance use disorders in recent cohorts. The\nsignificant inverse associations with substance use dis-\norders of education and being married existed only in\nrecent cohorts.\nCOMMENT\nThe results reported herein are limited by four possible\nbiases, all of which make the prevalence and risk esti-\nmates conservative. First, people with a history of men-\ntal illness might have been less likely than others to par-\nticipate in the survey either because of sample frame\nexclusions (eg, excluding homeless people from the sam-\npling frame), differential mortality, or greater reluc-\ntance to participate. There is evidence that bias of the lat-\nter sort (reluctance to participate) exists in psychiatric\nepidemiological surveys,17 although no evidence of such\nTable 4.

Experimental studies to evaluate the effects of\nstrategies designed to decrease embarrassment and to in-\ncrease accurate reporting have consistently shown sig-\nnificant increases in reports of mental illness.20,21 As dis-\ncussed in more detail elsewhere,6 a number of these\nstrategies were used in the NCS-R, but it is unlikely that\nthey were completely successful.\nThird, the method used to estimate lifetime risk was\nbased on the assumption of constant conditional risk of\nfirst onset in a given year of life among people who dif-\nfer in age at interview. This assumption is almost cer-\ntainly incorrect in light of evidence for significant inter-\ncohort differences in lifetime prevalence. Because the\nestimated prevalence was higher in more recent co-\nhorts, lifetime risk in younger cohorts will be underes-\ntimated in models based on the assumption of constant\nintercohort conditional risk.\nFourth, age at onset can be recalled incorrectly, pos-\nsibly as a function of age at interview and in conjunc-\ntion with age-related failure to recall lifetime disorders.\nSimon and Von Korff10 reported evidence of this prob-\nlem in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, in which\nage-at-onset reports were a mean of approximately 10\nyears before the interview regardless of the respondent's\nage. This kind of age-related age-at-onset telescoping in\nconjunction with age-related failure to report past dis-\norders can create the false appearance of a cohort effect.22\nAlthough the NCS-R used a novel probing strategy to as-\nsess age at onset that was shown experimentally to cor-\nrect the biased data pattern found by Simon and Von\nKorff,11 it is unlikely that this strategy corrected com-\npletely for age-related recall bias.\nBased on these considerations of possible bias, the\nNCS-R estimates of lifetime prevalence and projected risk\nare likely to be conservative. The estimates of anxiety,\nmood, and substance use disorders are broadly consis-\ntent with those found in previous community surveys in\n(1) A high proportion of the population met the criteria\nfor one or more of these disorders at some time in their\nlife. (2) Major depressive disorder, specific phobia, so-\ncial phobia, and alcohol abuse were the most common\nindividual disorders. (3) Anxiety disorders were the most\ncommon class of disorders. The main inconsistency with\nprevious results is that the estimated prevalence of sub-\nstance use disorders was considerably lower in the NCS-R\nTable 5.

Total sample models evaluated the significance of interactions between\ncohort and person-years in the lives of respondents. This was not done for impulse-control disorders because the vast majority of such disorders have onsets in a\nvery narrow time window. Cohort  person-year interactions had significant predictive value for each of the 3 disorder groups. Based on these results, subsample\nmodels were estimated for the effects of cohort in each of the first 6 decades of life (including 11- and 12-year-olds in the earliest decade to distinguish teenagers\nfrom other parts of the life span). All analyses were carried out in the full part II sample.\nIn the analysis of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder was coded as absent among respondents who were not assessed for this disorder.\nSignificant interaction between cohort and person-years in the lives of respondents in the total sample.\n\u00a7Significant difference compared with the before-1940 cohorts (age 60 years) (P.05, 2-sided test).\nSignificant intercohort differences in the global test.\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

This is presumably because the DSM-IV\ncriteria are stricter than the DSM-III-R criteria (espe-\ncially in requiring criterion A symptoms to cluster in a\nsingle year of life).\nAlthough we know of no previous attempt to esti-\nmate the lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV oppositional-\ndefiant disorder, conduct disorder, or attention-deficit/\nhyperactivitydisorderinanationallyrepresentativesample\nof adults, the NCS-R estimates are in the range reported\nin epidemiological surveys of adolescents.26,27 The NCS-R\nprevalence estimate for intermittent explosive disorder\nis also consistent with the scant data on the prevalence\nof that disorder.28 Given that previous epidemiological\nsurveys excluded these impulse-control disorders, it is\nstriking that their combined lifetime prevalence is higher\nthan that for either mood disorders or substance use dis-\norders.\nHigh prevalence estimates in previous psychiatric epi-\ndemiological surveys have been a source of two con-\ncerns to mental health policy analysts. The first is that\nthe estimates are so high as to be scientifically implau-\nsible.29 We addressed this issue earlier when we noted\nthat concordance is generally good between WMH-\nCIDI and SCID diagnoses and that the WMH-CIDI is con-\nservative relative to the SCID. A critic might conclude\nthat the DSM-IV system itself is overly inclusive. How-\never, it is noteworthy that preliminary analyses of the 12-\nmonth NCS-R data show that even those 12-month WMH-\nCIDI disorders that were classified as mild were associated\nwith levels of impairment equivalent to those caused by\nclinically significant chronic physical disorders. Based on\nthis evidence, it would be difficult to make a principled\nargument for narrowing the diagnostic criteria in future\neditions of the DSM to raise the threshold for clinical sig-\nnificance.\nThe second concern about high prevalence estimates\nis that, even if accurate, they correspond to many more\npeople than can be helped by currently available treat-\nment resources30 and consequently have no practical short-\nterm implications other than perhaps reducing support for\nparity of treatment with physical disorders.31 In consid-\nering these issues it is important to note that mental dis-\norders, like physical disorders, differ widely both in se-\nverity and in need for treatment.32,33 The fact that nearly\nhalf the population will meet the criteria for a mental dis-\norder at some time in their life does not mean that they\nwill all need treatment. As shown in a separate NCS-R re-\nport,34 a substantial proportion of 12-month DSM-IV cases\nare mild. In addition, treatments with demonstrated cost-\neffectiveness are not available for all mental disorders. If\ncost-effective treatments were to become available, it is\nlikely that anticipated resource deficits would be coun-\nterbalanced at least in part by increased demand and will-\ningness to pay, consistent with reactions to recently pub-\nTable 6.

How-\never, we are aware of no previous attempt to examine the\ntemporal concentration of ages of onset or to highlight\nthe concentration of ages of onset for most disorders in\na very narrow time span. It is also striking that the up-\nper bounds of the age-of-onset IQRs for disorders with\nnarrow ranges are all quite young: age 15 years for im-\npulse-control disorders and anxiety disorders with nar-\nrow IQRs and age 27 years for substance use disorders.\nThese are opposite the patterns found for almost all\nchronic physical disorders, with conditional risk increas-\ning with age and the upper bound of the IQR in late middle\nage or old age.40 Whatever else we can say about mental\ndisorders, then, they are distinct from chronic physical\ndisorders because they have their strongest foothold in\nyouth, with substantially lower risk among people who\nhave matured out of the high-risk age range.\nAn important issue in assessing the societal burden\nof mental disorders is whether the evidence of increas-\ning prevalence in recent cohorts is real or a methodologi-\ncal artifact. The fact that NCS-R cohort effects vary in plau-\nsible ways (eg, the largest ORs are associated with drug\nuse disorders, which are known independently to have\nincreased among cohorts that went through adoles-\ncence beginning in the 1970s) and the fact that sociode-\nmographic correlates of cohort effects are substantively\nplausible (eg, the increasing similarity of women and men\nwith regard to substance use disorders in recent co-\nhorts) argue that the observed cohort effect is at least partly\ndue to substantive rather than methodological factors.\nIn addition, no evidence was found for the convergence\namong cohorts with increasing age that would be ex-\npected if methodological factors were responsible for in-\ntercohort variation in prevalence estimates. In addition,\nwe used a nonresponse survey, weighting to correct for\nnonresponse bias,18 and a special age-at-onset probing\nstrategy to reduce recall bias6 to minimize the effects of\nmethodological factors on the results. Nonetheless, re-\nsidual effects of methodological factors are likely, based\non the fact that longitudinal studies show that mental dis-\norders are associated with early mortality41 and the fact\nthat resolved mental disorders reported in baseline in-\nterviews often are not reported in follow-up inter-\nviews.42 To the extent that these biases are at work, the\nhigh prevalence found in the younger NCS-R cohorts\nmight also apply to older cohorts.\nBased on the considerations in the last paragraph, we\nsuspect that NCS-R intercohort differences in age of on-\nset are due to a combination of substantive and meth-\nodological factors. A more definitive evaluation will re-\nquire longitudinal trend comparisons. Even before such\ndata become available, though, the NCS-R results clearly\ndocument that mental disorders are highly prevalent, that\nlifetime prevalence is, if anything, underestimated, that\nage-of-onset distributions for most of the disorders con-\nsidered herein are concentrated in a relatively narrow age\nrange during the first two decades of life, and that later-\nonset disorders occur in large part as temporally second-\nary comorbid conditions. To the extent that cohort ef-\nfects in the data are due to methodological factors, similar\npatterns might have occurred in earlier cohorts. Given\nthe enormous personal and societal burdens of mental\ndisorders, these observations should lead us to direct a\ngreater part of our thinking about public health inter-\nventions to the child and adolescent years and, with ap-\npropriately balanced considerations of potential risks and\nbenefits, to focus on early interventions aimed at pre-\nventing the progression of primary disorders and the on-\nset of comorbid disorders.\nSubmitted for Publication: June 9, 2004; final revision\nCorrespondence: Ronald C.
