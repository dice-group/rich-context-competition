This is not just because of the subject matter, which\nby no means has to be \"realistic\" in the sense of depicting some actual or historical event in the wid-\nest sense. More importantly for this paper, pictorial material need not be in a photographic mode\n(Gombrich, 1960). Here \"photographic mode\" applies equally well to imaginary scenes (say, illustra-\ntions to a science fiction story) as to depictions of actual scenes. Although a watertight definition is\nnot possible, the photographic mode involves a commitment of the artist to at least natural perspective\nand emulation of generic materials in reasonable light fields. In a more restricted definition, this would\nimply linear perspective (e.g., use of a computer graphics package) and physical shading (e.g., use of\na ray tracing algorithm).\n\"Natural perspective\" roughly coincides with Euclid's optics and concerns such issues as the\ndecrease of apparent size with distance, occlusions, height in the visual field, and so forth, whereas\n\"linear perspective\" pertains to a formal projection of directions from a fixed point on a given plane.\nA formal projection permits one to draw quantitative inferences from a picture. Given some additional\nprior information, it may yield a veridical scale of range or distance differences up to some unknown\nambiguity. Examples of formal projections are common in architectural renderings, but very rare in the\nvisual arts. In this paper, we intentionally avoid such cases.\nA certain form of \"realism\" was aimed at by the classical Western art academies (e.g., the Paris\nAcad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts). They offered courses that trained artists to do manually what nowadays a\ncomputer graphics system might achieve. Realism is generally aimed for by modern computer graph-\nics. In the case of the visual arts, even in the best cases, this merely technical part was then used as a\nframework for an artistic achievement. It is seen full blown in the French \"Art pompiers\" (artists such\nas Jean-L\u00e9on Ger\u00f4me, William-Adolphe Bougereau, ...), to mention a familiar example (Harding,\nInteraction of depth probes and style of depiction\n1979). This is specific to a minor corner of Western art though. \"Photorealism\" is used mainly as a\ngimmick in the arts, and even soon after the introduction of linear perspective in the Renaissance,\npainters intentionally deviated from it. In generic works of arts there is no such a thing as \"veridical\ndepth\".\nIn this paper, we consider also art from other cultures and periods, cases where not even the\nnatural perspective constraint necessarily applies. Yet, such art may be perfectly \"representational\"\n(Gombrich, 1960). Think of the Altamira or Lascaux animal, for instance.\nWhen one considers an art work, one may either look at the work or into the work. The distinc-\ntion is categorical (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Wagemans, 2011). In looking at the work, one is aware\nof a planar surface (we restrict ourselves here to canvasses, panels, paper, and so forth) covered with\npigments in a certain arrangement. In looking into the work, one is aware of a pictorial world, not\nonly two-fold extended, but also articulated in depth. It is this latter mode we are interested in here. Of\ncourse, this does not imply that not both aspects are of importance in the aesthetic evaluation of the\nwork. They almost invariably are.\nWhen looking into a work, one becomes aware of a pictorial world. Its spatial (\"simultaneous\npresence\") aspect is \"pictorial space\". Pictorial space may be variously articulated. In highly articulate\ninstances, one has a feeling of \"depth\" at nearly every location in the picture plane. This depth is a sca-\nlar variable. Since the eye is generally not itself in pictorial space, there is no natural origin. Only depth\ndifferences are significant. Neither is there a natural unit of depth. Thus, the depth dimension is at best\nan affine line. In many cases, the depth dimension might be even less structured. (see Koenderink\net al., 2011 for an elaboration of these notions.) \"Pictorial depth\" is to a large extent idiosyncratic. In\nthe absence of a ground truth, it can only be operationally defined. Depending on the particular opera-\ntionalization, observer, viewing mode, and so forth, one is bound to find different results.\nWe have developed a number of methods (van Doorn, Wagemans, de Ridder, & Koenderink,\nthat allow one to determine depth differences between locations in pictorial space that correspond to\npoints in the picture plane. These values depend both on the picture and on the observer. They are to\nbe considered formal elements of a first person account. The depth differences are only operationally\ndefined, that is to say, they are created in the course of the measurement. Their values are to be consid-\nered indeterminate in the absence of an actual measurement. This distinction is key in understanding\nthe difference between physical measurements and measurements of phenomenological experiences.\nAll of these methods exploit the observer's sensitivities to certain classes of depth cues (Berkeley,\nand there is no reason to expect that different methods would yield similar values. The results depend\n(among other things) on the mix of depth cues intentionally introduced by the artist so as to evoke\na certain awareness in prospective observers. They also depend upon the abilities of the observer to\n\"read\" the artist's intentions. In this study, we use only persons of generic Western cultural background\nas observers, whereas we vary the \"style\" of the works, that is to say, the bouquet of cues intention-\nally used by the artists. This is partly due to obvious constraints. For instance, we cannot hope to be\nable to use eighteenth century Japanese connoisseurs as observers in the experiment, whereas modern\nJapanese are intimately familiar with linear perspective through the medium of photography.\nSo, here are the hypotheses that we put to the test in this study. Because the various methods ex-\nploit different depth cues, it is to be expected that they will give rise to different results for instances of\ndepiction that exploit or ignore specific depth cues. Specifically, in cases where the relative size cue is\nignored, as in the case of many depictions from the non-Western cultures, we predict that depth probes\nbased on the relative size cue will be preferentially affected. In this paper, we select methods of depth\nprobing and styles of depiction that will likely show up such effects. Specifically, we consider styles\nthat do or do not respect the immediate consequences of natural perspective. In doing this, we contrast\npaintings that lean somewhat towards photographic realism with depictions that have (at least partly)\ndifferent objectives.\n2 Design of the experiment\n2.1 Picture material\nWe selected two paintings from French nineteenth century art, though not from the mainstream aca-\ndemic tradition, but from the contemporary avant garde. One is a painting by Caillebotte, another a\npainting by Pisarro (Figure 1, top row). Both are easel paintings of considerable size. Both respect\nDepth probes and style of depiction 530\nnatural perspective or even a trace of linear perspective (Alberti, 1972; Gombrich, 1960; Pirenne,\n1970). One consequence of this is that the size of depiction of familiar objects (say humans) depends\nstrongly upon their intended distance from the viewer. (Just measure the size of the depicted persons in\npicture coordinates.) Apart from such \"familiar size\" cues, there are numerous additional cues to depth\nthat are used expertly by both painters. We refer to these pictures as Picture I [`La R\u00e9colte des Foins,\nEragny' by Camille Pisarro (1830\u00ad1903); Figure 1, top left] and Picture II [`Portraits \u00e0 la Campagne'\nby Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u00ad1994); Figure 1 top right]. Notice that the Pisarro painting can hardly be\nsaid to implement formal linear perspective, whereas the Caillebotte painting has the facade in fairly\nprecise linear perspective rendering. Even in the latter case, one hardly obtains anything like a \"ground\ntruth\" without many additional assumptions. Both paintings evidently respect natural perspective.\nWe also selected an example from eighteenth century Japan by Koryusai, and a miniature painting\nby Davron (Figure 1, bottom row). Both are rather smallish pictures, printed or painted on paper in wa-\nter media. In both cases, the artists to some extent ignore natural perspective, in that farther objects are\nnot depicted noticeably smaller than closer objects of the same type. (Again, the pictures contain nu-\nmerous humans.) Occlusion and height in the visual field are respected, though there is no implied eye\nheight. The artists expertly use a number of other cues. In the case of the Japanese picture, there exists\nan approximate framework that is different from linear perspective but likewise offers similar formal\nmethods of construction and measurement. The picture is constructed in an informal isometric projec-\ntion and contains numerous global straight lines and nominally right angles. We refer to these pictures\nas Picture III [the miniature by contemporary Davron Toshev (Bukhara, Uzbekistan); Figure 1, bottom\nleft] and Picture IV [`The tea ceremony' by Isoda Koryusai (1735\u00ad1790); Figure 1, bottom right].\nThe pictures have been selected in such a way that Pictures I (Pisarro) and III (Toshev) are com-\nparatively \"open\" (both are landscapes with a far view), whereas Pictures II (Caillebotte) and IV\n(Koryusai) are comparatively \"closed\" (each a group of people engaged in some social gathering, one\na garden terrace and the other a room interior). Moreover, the number and general spatial distribution\nof persons, vegetation, walls, furniture, and so forth, are pairwise comparable.\nFigure 1. The four pictures used in the study. Picture I `La R\u00e9colte des Foins, Eragny' by Camille Pisarro,\nPicture II `Portraits \u00e0 la Campagne' by Gustave Caillebotte, Picture III a miniature by Davron Toshev (Bukhara,\nUzbekistan), Picture IV `The tea ceremony' by Isoda Koryusai. The red dots are locations used in both Methods\nA (pointing) and B (relative size), the yellow dots only used in Method B (relative size).\nliquid crystal display (LCD) screen], each picture filling the screen as much as possible. Thus, they are\nseen in similar sizes, quite unlike their actual dimensions. The widths of the pictures on the screen are\n42 cm (Picture I), 38.5 cm (Picture II), 42 cm (Picture III) and 51.8 cm (Picture IV). In viewing the\npictures, the observers are positioned at a fixed distance (78 cm), centered with respect to the screen.\nThey view the screen monocularly with their dominant eye, the other eye being patched. Apart from\nthe screen, the room was in darkness.\nEight observers participated in the experiment. Four of these observers were paid to participate and\nwere na\u00efve regarding the aims of the project (BC, EL, MN, RL). The remaining four were the authors\n(AD, JK, JW, ML).\nWe selected two methods that each sampled the depth difference between a pair of points in the pic-\nture. The methods are very different. One method uses probes that directly exploit the relative size\ncue (Wagemans et al., 2011b), whereas the other method (Wagemans et al., 2011a) does not. Thus,\nwe expect the different styles to interact with the methods, as explained in the introduction. We refer\nto the methods as Method A (also referred to as \"pointing\") and B (also referred to as \"relative size\").\nIn Method A (pointing; see Appendix), the observer points from one point to another in pictorial\nspace (Wagemans et al., 2011a). This involves superimposing a pointer and a target on the picture.\nThe method does not depend explicitly on the relative size cue. We have extensive experience with\nthis method.\nIn Method B (relative size; see Appendix), the observer adjusts the relative size of a pair of marks,\nso as to experience them as equally large in pictorial space (Wagemans et al., 2011b). Thus, this meth-\nod depends crucially on the relative size cue. We also have extensive experience with this method.\nIn Method A (pointing), the obtained depth differences are proportional to the size of the image, in\nMethod B (relative size) they are not. In order to render the values from the two methods comparable,\nwe normalize the depths from Method A (pointing) by the diagonal of each image. This scaling is ir-\nrelevant for the final results.\nBoth methods are succinctly described in the Appendix. More extensive discussions of the meth-\n3Experiment\n3.1 Method A (pointing)\nWe defined five fiducial points in each picture (the red colored dots in Figure 1). These points have\nbeen chosen so as to cover the depth range. They are located so that they easily \"attach\" to objects in\npictorial space. This latter requirement is crucial. If one puts a mark on the picture plane, it appears\neither as a mark on the picture plane (say, a fly speck in the sky area of a photograph) or it immerses in\npictorial space and moves into depth until it attaches to the nearest (in depth) pictorial object. This hap-\npens quite naturally, as is evident from the mustaches and black teeth one often sees in poster boards\ndepicting politicians. It is closely related to the art of painting itself, for every brush stroke (with the\npossible exception of the painter's signature) behaves in precisely the same way. Painting would not\nexist were it not for this peculiar effect, for which no scientific explanation is readily available.\nUsing Method A (pointing), we determine the point configuration for these five fiducial points in\npictorial space. For any given picture, it turns out to be at least qualitatively similar for all observers.\nEach observer repeats the measurements, doing three sessions in total. From these repeated meas-\nurements, we obtain an estimate of the significance of each observer's data. This allows us to compare\nobservers. For any given picture, we find that although the depths for all observers correlate highly,\nthere exist very significant differences in the overall depth ranges. There also exist very significant\ndifferences in the overall depth ranges for different pictures.\nThe median depth over all sessions of all observers yields a convenient overview of the results\n(see Figure 2). In this figure, we have plotted \"ground plans\" of the point configurations in depth, thus\nthe horizontal axis is the horizontal location in the picture, whereas the vertical axis plots the depth val-\nues. We have normalized all ground plans to the same aspect ratio. A comparison of the ground plans\nwith the locations indicated in Figure 1 will most likely agree with the intuitions of the reader. All\nDepth probes and style of depiction 532\nobservers agreed closely on the shape (but not necessarily the magnitude) of the configuration. This\nis evident from the correlations of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the overall\ngrand median depth. The lowest coefficient of determination (R2) over all pictures is .94, whereas\ntypical values are .99. This indicates that all observers are aware of very similar pictorial spaces as\nmeasured by Method A (pointing).\nAlthough the shapes of the depth configurations are indeed very similar for all observers, their\ndepth ranges are quite different (see Figure 3). This is also evident from the slopes of the regression\nlines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths. We find that\nthe ratios of the largest to the smallest slopes are between 2.08 and 2.76, depending upon the picture.\nWhether these differences are typical of an observer may be judged by considering the profile of\nslope values for a given picture. When we correlate these profiles for different pairs of pictures, we\nfind coefficients of determination (R2) between .24 and .81 (see Table 1). Thus, observers are rather\nconsistent over (very) different pictures. The slopes are not random, but characteristic of an observer.\nFor a given style [Pictures I-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) or Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryusai)], the\ncorrelations are quite high, whereas this is perhaps less evident when different styles are compared.\nFor a given style, the profiles are very significantly correlated, which means that the differences are\nobserver-specific. This holds true even when different styles are compared, although to a lesser extent.\n3.2 Method B (relative size)\nWe defined ten fiducial points in each picture. Five of these are identical to the fiducial points used\nwith Method A (pointing; the red colored ones in Figure 1). The additional points are shown as yellow\ndots in Figure 1.\nThe reason for the different number of fiducial points is that Method B (relative size) yields results\nmuch quicker than Method A (pointing). We do not want sessions in excess of an hour (we typically\nFigure 2. Ground plans of the point configurations in depth for Method A (pointing), separately for each picture\n(I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai). The points correspond to the red points in Figure 1.\nThe horizontal axis is the horizontal location in the picture, whereas the vertical axis plots the median depth values\nover all sessions of all observers. Thus, the thin lines indicate pure depth variation. (Aspect ratios have been\nequalized for easy reference.)\nFigure 3. Depth ranges obtained with Method A (pointing) for the four pictures (I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte,\nIII 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai). For each picture, we show the variation of depth ranges over all observers. The\nwhisker box plots show the quartile ranges with the extreme values.\naim at half an hour), nor do we want to distribute a task over more than a single session. From earlier\nexperience, we have reasons to believe that the characteristics of a single observer may change over\nlonger time spans. These are important constraints that largely determine our choices.\nUsing Method B (relative size), we determine the point configuration for these ten fiducial points\nin pictorial space. For any given picture, it turns out to be at least qualitatively similar for all observ-\ners. Each observer repeats the measurements, performing three sessions in total. From these repeated\nmeasurements, we obtain an estimate of the significance of each observer's data. This again allows us\nto compare observers. First conclusions are much like in the previous task. For any given picture, we\nfind that although the depths for all observers correlate highly, there exist very significant differences\nin the overall depth ranges. There also exist very significant differences in the overall depth ranges for\ndifferent pictures.\nThe median depths over all sessions of all observers are shown in Figure 4. They are plotted in the\nsame format as Figure 2 (see legend of this figure). Again, a comparison of the ground plans with the\nlocations indicated in Figure 1 will most likely agree with the intuitions of the reader. All observers\nagreed closely on the shape (but not necessarily the depth range) of the configuration. This is evident\nfrom the correlations of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the overall grand me-\ndian depth. The lowest coefficient of determination (R2) over all pictures is .81, whereas typical values\nexceed .95. This indicates that all observers are aware of very similar pictorial spaces as measured with\nMethod B (relative size).\nAlthough the shapes of the depth configurations are indeed very similar for all observers, their\ndepth ranges are again quite different (see Figure 5). This is evident from the slopes of the regression\nlines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths. We find that\nthe ratios of the largest to the smallest slopes are between 1.70 and 3.48, depending upon the picture.\nWhether these differences are typical of an observer may be judged by considering the profile of slope\nvalues for a given picture. When we correlate these profiles for different pairs of pictures, we find coef-\nficients of determination (R2) that all vary between .01 and .73 (see Table 2). For a given style [Pictures\nTable 1. Coefficients of determination (R2) of the regressions of profiles over observers of slopes of the regres-\nsion lines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths separately for each\npicture (I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai)\nFigure 4. Ground plans of the point configurations in depth for Method B (relative size), separately for each\npicture (I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai). The colors of the points correspond to those\ndefined in Figure 1. The horizontal axis is the horizontal location in the picture, whereas the vertical axis plots the\nmedian depth values over all observers and all sessions. Thus, the thin lines indicate pure depth variation. (Aspect\nratios have been equalized for easy reference.)\nDepth probes and style of depiction 534\nI-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) or Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryushai)], the correlations are quite\nhigh, whereas this is not the case when different styles are compared. For a given style, the profiles\nare very significantly correlated, which means that the differences are observer-specific for that case.\nAn important question is whether the depth configurations obtained through the two mutually very dif-\nferent methods are similar. This can be approached directly through a correlation of the grand median\ndepths obtained through the two methods. Of course, we can only correlate the five points used in\nboth Methods A (pointing) and B (relative size). We find coefficients of determination (R2) of .91 for\nPicture I (Pisarro), .86 for Picture II (Caillebotte), .99 for Picture III (Toshev), and .98 for Picture IV\n(Koryushai). We conclude that the results of the two methods agree very well.\nAnother important question is whether the profiles of slopes over observers for a given picture\nare similar for the two methods. This can be approached through a correlation of the profiles obtained\nthrough the two methods. We find coefficients of determination (R2) of .08 for Picture I (Pisarro), .01\nfor Picture II (Caillebotte), .12 for Picture III (Toshev), and .16 for Picture IV (Koryushai). We con-\nclude that the idiosyncrasies found in either method agree hardly at all. Apparently, the differences\nbetween observers do not generalize both over pictures and over methods.\nStylistic differences might be expected when comparing Methods A (pointing) and B (relative\nsize) for Pictures I-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) versus Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryushai). This is\nborne out by the results. For instance, in Figure 6, we show a comparison for Pictures I (Pisarro) and\nIII (Toshev) for observer JW. It is evident that the slopes of the regression lines both exceed one [thus,\nthe depth range from Method B (relative size) exceeds that from Method A (pointing)] and that the\nslope of the regression line for Picture I (Pisarro) exceeds that for Picture III (Toshev). The fact that\nboth slopes exceed one is in itself not remarkable (after all, the methods are quite different), but the\nfact that the slopes are different for the two pictures is relevant. The ratio of the slopes is a measure of\nthe ratio of depth ranges obtained via the two methods.\nThe trend for observer JW (Figure 6) can be found in the results of all observers but one (JK). In\nFigure 7 we give whisker box plots over all observers. The ratios for Pictures I (Pisarro) and II (Cail-\nlebotte) exceed these for Pictures III (Toshev) and IV (Koryushai).\nTable 2. Coefficients of determination (R2) of the regressions of profiles over observers of slopes of the regres-\nsion lines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths, separately for each\npicture (I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai).\nFigure 5. Depth ranges obtained with Method B (relative size) for the four pictures. For each picture (I 5 Pisarro,\nII 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai), we show the variation of depth ranges over all observers. The\nwhisker box plots show the quartile ranges with the extreme values.\nThus, there is a distinction to be made for pictures that largely commit to the consequences of\nnatural perspective [especially the dependence of apparent size on depth, Pictures I (Pisarro) and II\n(Caillebotte)] and those who largely ignore the issue of the dependence of apparent size on depth [Pic-\ntures III (Toshev) and IV (Koryushai)]. This was expected, as explained in the Introduction.\n4Discussion\nOne major result of the experiment is clear-cut: We could differentiate certain styles on the basis of the\nmeasurement of pictorial depth differences. This result is interesting in its own right, since typically\nthe differentiation of style is left to \"expert opinion\" (Gombrich, 1960). It is not at all that easy to make\nthe distinction on the basis of image characteristics. Most \"obvious\" measures that one might suggest\nactually depend upon implicit assumptions of the \"expert opinion\" type.\nThat the methods and the pictures we selected yield this result is--of course--not entirely un-\nexpected, since we expressly selected them for this. When the interest is in a different set of stylistic\nelements, one would evidently select a different set of methods. Thus, we regard the present study as\nopening up a new realm of endeavor.\nWhat this result vividly illustrates is the fact that \"pictorial depth\" is not something that is deter-\nmined by the picture itself, in the sense that there would be a principled way to decide on the basis\nof the picture whether a set of depth assignments would be \"correct\". Pictorial depth as measured\n(otherwise it is a mere qualitative attribute someone ascribes to a picture) is necessarily operationally\ndefined. Any method has to address a certain bouquet of \"depth cues\", either very generally, or rather\nspecifically.\nA most useful consequence is that methods can be focused on certain aspects of picture construc-\ntion. This is the notion that we attempted to exploit in this study. We believe this concept to have\nnumerous different applications.\nWe find that observers are mutually very consistent over very different pictures and very different\nmethods in their awareness of the shape of depth configurations (Figures 2 and 4). This is encouraging\nFigure 6. Scatter plots of median depths obtained by Methods A (pointing) and B (relative size) for observer JW,\nPictures I (Pisarro) and III (Toshev).\nFigure 7. Ratios of depth ranges obtained with Method B (relative size) and Method A (pointing) for the four\npictures (I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai). For each picture, we show the variation\nof depth range ratios over all observers. The whisker box plots show the medians, interquartile ranges and the\nextreme values. The variation is dominated by a single outlier (observer JK).\nDepth probes and style of depiction 536\nto those who are interested in exploiting the \"one picture is worth more than a thousand words\" prov-\nerb. Pictures do convey largely unambiguous impressions, even when the style of depiction is not the\npreferred one in a person's cultural environment. Apparently, the visual awarenesses of our observers\nwhen looking into the pictures were very similar. Moreover, the depth configurations did hardly de-\npend upon the method to measure them.\nWe found the depth ranges to be very idiosyncratic though. Apparently, observers experience the\nsame pictorial space modulo some idiosyncratic depth scaling that evades our understanding. We sim-\nply have to accept that observers are different, we cannot account for it. This is essentially the message\nof the sculptor Hildebrand in his 1893 book Das Problem der Form (\"On the problem of form\"). Al-\nthough very basic and important, this is rarely recognized in the modern literature (Hildebrand, 1893).\nIn summary, this type of comparative study yields very rich information about how different styles\nof depiction yield different types of \"pictorial space\" as a function of different types of measurements.\nThere are numerous problems that might be immediately attacked by a similar approach.\n"
