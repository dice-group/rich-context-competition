Using secondary data, we will be statistically analyz-\ning the main effects and interaction effects of criminal record\nand substance use history indicators among probationers on\ntheir post-treatment employment and gross earnings out-\ncomes at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. The model\nthat we will be developing for predicting employment and\nearnings outcomes among probationers controls for social-\ndemographic and psychosocial indicators.\nThe extant literature on the theoretical labeling of individu-\nals with criminal records has demonstrated that entrenchment\nin the criminal justice system has a bifurcated impact on\nemployment opportunities, particularly, for those individuals\nwho have experienced incarceration (Pager, 2005). The pri-\nmary impact felt by those sentenced to jail or prison is their\nrelocation from their routine social and employment context in\nthe community to a highly regimented, supervised, and struc-\ntured environment with limited or no economic opportunities\nfor inmates (Rose & Clear, 1998). The secondary impact can\nbe observed during the reentry phase, post-incarceration,\nwhen the formerly incarcerated are attempting to resituate\nthemselves into the employment landscape from which they\nhave been suspended for varying periods of time. Frequently\ndiscussed observations in the extant literature describe the\nreentry phase as a form of extrajudicial punishment, where\nthe formerly incarcerated continue to be punished for their\ncriminal records by employers, in the competitive labor mar-\nket, who are searching for prospective hires with near flaw-\nhow criminal records serve as negative credentials that pre-\nmaturely signal to prospective employers that job applicants\nmay be unstable or unreliable, without further consideration\nfor the job applicants' skills, education, or employment his-\ntory. The rate of unemployment among ex-offenders search-\ning for jobs that pay a living wage ranges from 25% to 40%\n1California StateUniversity Stanislaus, Turlock, USA\n2City University of New York, Graduate Center, New York City, USA\n3Modesto Junior College, Modesto, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSriram Chintakrindi, California State University Stanislaus, 1 University\nEmail: schintakrindi@csustan.edu\nAn Examination of Employment and\nEarning Outcomes of Probationers With\nCriminal and Substance Use Histories\nSriram Chintakrindi1, Jeremy Porter2, Chunrye Kim2,\nand Suditi Gupta3\n Keywords\naddiction, criminal history, offender rehabilitation, employment, earnings\n2 SAGE Open\nprison annually, two thirds of whom reentering society hav-\ning histories of drug use (Friedmann et al., 2012). If drug\nproblems are left untreated or unmonitored, then this can\nresult in, with a high-likelihood, relapse or re-arrest of ex-\noffenders. It is reported that drug use results in reincarcera-\ntion of more than half of inmates within 3 years of their\nrelease (Friedmann et al., 2012). Research conducted on\nemployment outcomes of college educated drug users dem-\nonstrates that persistent drug users compared with non-drug\nusers have a higher likelihood of being unemployed (Arria\net al., 2013). Persistent drug users compared with non-drug\nusers were also found to have an increased likelihood of\nbeing employed part-time versus full-time. These findings\non the relationship between drug use and employment are\neven further exacerbated by criminal records as demon-\nstrated by Sung and Chu (2011) who found that offenders\nwho participated in substance use treatment interventions\nexperienced treatment schedules that conflicted with work\nschedules, making employment difficult during the treat-\nment process. The researchers found that treatment length,\ntreatment compliance, and self-efficacy were strong predic-\ntors of post-treatment employment (Sung & Chu, 2011).\nThose offenders who completed treatment had increased\nemployment prospects compared with offenders who failed\nto complete substance use treatment. Sung and Chu (2011)\ndiscuss how both pro-social personality and law-abiding\nbehavioral characteristics are required to complete substance\nuse treatment and to obtain employment. More specifically,\noffenders who demonstrate a strong sense of self-efficacy,\ngoal orientation, and motivation have increased odds of both\ncompleting substance use treatment and gaining employed\nwhen compared with offenders without those profile traits.\nAlthough, Sung and Chu found that completing substance\nuse treatment improved employment prospects, however, it\ndid not improve personal incomes.\nFor this study, we are interested in examining post-\ntreatment employment and gross income outcomes for pro-\nbationers. We hypothesize that probationers, who self-\nreported having a criminal or substance use history, will\nhave a decrease in odds of reporting employment at the 6-\nand 12-month follow-up periods compared with offenders\nwithout criminal or substance use histories. In addition, we\nhypothesize that probationers who reported having a crimi-\nnal or substance use history, will have a statistically signifi-\ncantly lower mean salary rate at the 6- and 12-month\nfollow-up periods compared with probationers without a\nhistory of substance use. Finally, we hypothesize that sub-\nstance use history moderates the relationship between\nhaving a criminal history and post-treatment employment\nand earnings outcomes. More specifically, the moderator\nhypothesis states that offenders with a substance use history\nwill have a strengthened relationship between their criminal\nhistory and decreased odds of employment and earnings\noutcomes.\nLiterature Review\nFor the past four decades, there has been an exponential\ngrowth in the population of inmates under the authority and\nsurveillance of the criminal justice system at both the state\nlar, African American communities that have historically\nexperienced high-rates of poverty and unemployment are\nnow routinely being targeted and blanketed by formal modes\nof social control through the active presence of law-enforce-\nment and community-correctional supervision (Garland,\nthat the one in seven Black men are entrenched in the crimi-\nnal justice system by 2004. It is reported that a third of young\nAfrican American men, who were non-college educated,\nwere being incarcerated at the beginning of the 21st century\n(Western & Wildeman, 2009). The enhanced surveillance\nand authority of the criminal justice system in low-income\nand minority communities has had socio-legal implications\nthat are pronounced, and difficult to mitigate and reverse\n(Rose & Clear, 1998). Criminal justice offenders that have\npassed through the corrections system are labeled criminal\nand disenfranchised from the formal economy due to dis-\ncriminatory hiring practices by employers.\nEmployers with entry-level openings that pay a living\nwage are typically risk-averse and have a surplus labor pool\nto draw from to fill their employment needs. The disenfran-\nchisement of the formerly incarcerated not only increases\ntheir risk for recidivism, as the formerly incarcerated lack the\nmeans to provide shelter and finances for supporting them-\nselves, but unemployment and low-incomes has had a large\nimpact on the public safety and health of communities with\nhigh concentrations of offenders. African American men liv-\ning in post-industrial communities with high unemployment\nrates have limited education and job skills, thus making them\nhighly susceptible to engaging in the drug-trade and using\nviolence to resolve drug-related disputes (Western &\nWildeman, 2009). By engaging in the drug-trade, Black men\nare not only engaging in criminal behavior, associated with\nmandatory minimum sentences, for economic gain, but also\nsimultaneously proliferating addiction and the mental and\nphysical health problems associated with addiction into their\ncommunities. Similarly, violence is now understood to not\nonly be a public safety issue for communities but is now also\nbeing viewed as a significant public health disaster as emer-\ngency rooms are flooded with an influx of victims of vio-\nlence suffering from both physical wounds and trauma. The\nhomicide epidemic among economically disadvantaged\nhigher compared with White men between the ages of 25 and\nThe negative social and health effects of incarceration are\nnot only found among African American men, but results\nfrom research demonstrate that experiencing incarceration\nChintakrindi et al. 3\nincreases the odds of premature adult mortality, particularly\namong women, even when statistical controls for socio-\ndemographic characteristics, education, drug use, and ciga-\nretteuseareapplied.Menwhohaveexperiencedincarceration\nhave an increased odds of premature adult mortality com-\npared with men who have not been incarcerated. Having a\nlower level of education and being Black were found to\nincrease the odds of premature mortality (Massoglia, Pare,\nThe reentry phase for the formerly incarcerated, released\nfrom prison or jail, presents numerous obstacles, which\ninclude but are not limited to, explaining to employers about\ngaps in employment, criminal records, and temporary resi-\ndential addresses. The overwhelming presence of law\nenforcement as the primary instrument for maintaining social\ncontrol of the formerly incarcerated, through the appendages\nof community corrections, has been linked to exacerbating\nthe social disorganization, within communities with high\nconcentrations of offenders, through the active removal and\nrelocation of ex-offenders who violate their parole or proba-\ntion mandates. Research illustrates that recidivism rates are\nhigh among the formerly incarcerated. An estimated two\nthirds of offenders released from prisoners are rearrested and\none-third are reincarcerated (Freeman, 2008). The revolving\ndoors of the criminal justice system diminishes or outright\neliminates offenders' capacity to assume multiple roles, such\nas, being guardians and financial providers for their families\nThe displacement of offenders through the process of\nremoving and criminally labeling existing and potential\nsocial capital and financial providers through differentially\nenforced law-enforcement policies that have disproportion-\nately targeted communities with high concentrations of\nAfrican American and Hispanic young men has had a pro-\nfound impact on their employability and income outcomes\n2009). Contemporary criminal justice policy serves as an\ninstrument of actuarial management of offenders to not only\nmitigate offender risk for recidivism but also enhance public\nsafety through intensive supervision and surveillance prac-\ntices, rather than emphasizing rehabilitation or treat offend-\ners for their underlying criminogenic risk factors, thus\nleaving offenders unprepared for the labor market and vul-\nnerable to law-enforcement practices (Andrews & Bonta,\nUnsuccessful reentry and reintegration of offenders\nwithin their respective communities has been linked to the\ninability to access employment training programs and to find\nmeaningful employment that provides living wages (Sung &\nrecords policies where employers have access to criminal\nhistory records over the Internet corresponded with lower\nwages and earnings when compared with states that provide\nclosed-record policies and restorative rights for former\noffenders. In addition to the structural barriers to entering the\nlabor market faced by those with criminal records, offenders\nreturning back to their communities, after a period of incar-\nceration, often lack employment and skills that correspond\nwith the volatile demands of the labor market.\nHowever, the results remain mixed when examining the\neffectiveness of community employment treatment programs\non reducing the risk of offender recidivism. Results from a\nmeta-analysis conducted by Visher, Winterfield, and\nCoggeshall (2005) suggest that non-custodial community\nemployment programs do not reduce the odds of re-arrest\namong ex-offenders. Furthermore, the researchers divided\nthe studies that they meta-analyzed into two groups, examin-\ning re-arrest rates among community employment program\nparticipants based on whether they either had a prior convic-\ntion or only a prior arrest. Similarly, they found that com-\nmunity employment programs did not reduce the odds of\nrecidivism for both groups (Visher et al., 2005).\nBushway and Apel (2012) report that at the national level,\n35% of incarcerated inmates have a high school diploma\ncompared with 82% of the general population. Furthermore,\nBushway and Apel state that the formerly incarcerated dem-\nonstrate characteristics that parallel other hard-to-employ\npopulations, such as welfare recipients and high school drop-\nouts. The limited emphasis placed on the rehabilitation of\noffenders through education and employment training within\nthe context of the criminal justice system has shaped the nar-\nrative surrounding reentry of offenders and their recidivism\nrates. Although routinely unsuccessful in reducing recidi-\nvism, evidence-based employment programs provide valu-\nable information on program participant demographics and\noutcomes tied to substance use treatment, emerging public\nhealth issues, and medical services utilization. In addition,\nreentry employment programs have been viewed as an alter-\nnative and less invasive state-sanctioned social control for\nsupervising inmates post-incarceration.\nIn particular, Bushway and Apel (2012) discuss how a\nlongitudinal research study conducted in New Jersey over an\n18-year period demonstrated that upwards of 25% of con-\nvicted felons desisted from offending during that time period.\nHowever, most evaluations of employment training pro-\ngrams for the formerly incarcerated remain shortsighted and\nexamine recidivism rates within a 2-year pre and post-\ntreatment period, which is problematic because they are\nunable to identify potential offenders who will desist for the\nlong term (Bushway & Apel, 2012). Therefore, according to\nBushway and Apel that desistance from future recidivism\neither aided or unaided through employment programs\nshould be perceived as a signal that offenders have the capac-\nity to become law-abiding when given the opportunity and in\nthe absence of official state-sanctioned social controls, such\nas probation or parole.\nResearchers, stakeholders, and criminal justice policy\nmakers continue to examine and promote interventions that\nfacilitate reductions in recidivism and yield high-quality data\nthat allow for the indirect surveillance of economic and\n4 SAGE Open\npublic health outcomes, associated with offenders, for the\npurposes of informing public policy (Bushway & Apel,\n2012). Other scholars suggest that reductions in recidivism\ncan be achieved by leveraging the authority of the criminal\njustice system to pressure offenders post-incarceration into\naftercare rehabilitation oriented programs, such as substance\nuse treatment, mental health treatment, employment readi-\nness, and job placement programs (Chintakrindi, Porter,\nMellow, & Sung, 2015; Chintakrindi, Upton, Louison, Case,\nPager (2005) provides an applied theoretical framework\nfor understanding how the labeling process is facilitated for\nthe disenfranchisement of offenders from the formal economy,\nthrough the institutionalized administration and bureaucratic\nmanagement of negative credentials, thus stratifying offenders\nand non-offenders in the competitive labor market. Sung and\nBelenko (2005) found that offenders participating in the Drug\nTreatment Alternative to Prison (DTAP) program who were\nunemployed had a higher likelihood of arrest compared with\nthose who were employed. More specifically, 45% of those\nwho indicated that they were unemployed were rearrested at\nthe 5-year follow-up period compared with 28% of those who\nindicated employment while participating in DTAP. The\nresearchers hypothesize that the lower odds of arrest among\nthe employed ex-offenders may perhaps be attributed to the\nimposition of discipline, generation of income, and increased\nself-esteem associated with a pro-social identity that is facili-\ntated by having stable employment.\nEmployers advertising entry-level positions with livable\nwages demand higher education, optimal physical and men-\ntal health, above-satisfactory credit histories, and no criminal\nrecords. The research conducted by Pager (2005) illustrates\nhow the interaction of race and criminal history in the con-\ntexts of searching for employment, for the formerly incarcer-\nated,isaformof\"doublejeopardy.\"Theformerlyincarcerated\nand those with criminal histories continue to be punished long\nafter having served their sentences, where they face discrimi-\nnation for not only their criminal records, but research dem-\nonstrates that their race may also factor into employability\n(Pager, 2005). From an experiment conducted by Pager on the\ncallback rates from employers for employees seeking jobs,\ndescriptive statistics illustrate that White individuals with\ncriminal records (17%) had slightly higher callback rates\ncompared with Blacks without criminal records (14%).\nAlong with race and criminal history, substance use his-\ntory appears to be a significant detriment to employability.\nHowever, previous research has not concretely identified\nwhich factor has the strongest main effect on ex-offenders\nseeking employment. Pager (2003) reviews how incarceration\nhistory alone does not fully explain poor post-incarceration\nemployment outcomes among offenders. In fact, the relation-\nship between incarceration history and employment out-\ncomes may be spurious. Instead, Pager illustrates that\npre-existing characteristics of offenders, such as substance\nuse dependence, behavioral problems, and poor interper-\nsonal skills have been found to be robust predictors of both\nrecidivism and poor-employment outcomes when compared\nwith the effects of incarceration history alone.\nAn examination of treatment outcomes from a study on\ndrug court participants revealed that participants who\nreported having employment at intake increased their odds\nof completing of drug court (Roll, Prendergast, Richardson,\n& Ramirez, 2005), whereas, participants who reported hav-\ning a history of injection drug use were less likely to com-\nplete drug court. Roll et al. (2005) speculates that indicators\nof employment and injection drug use history are proxies for\nmeasuring the severity of participants' substance use disor-\nders while being under the supervision of drug court.\nFurthermore, the researchers speculate that individuals who\nare able to maintain employment are not as impaired as those\nparticipants without employment and also have less severe\nhistories of substance use disorders and better prognosis for\nrecovery.\nSimilarly, research on employment and work outcomes\namong drug court participants conducted by Leukefeld,\nWebster, Staton-Tindall, and Duvall (2007) demonstrates that\nparticipants who received an employment/skills training inter-\nvention, while mandated to drug court, reported decreased\ndrug use and recidivism compared with the treatment as usual\ncontrol group in the study. More specifically, increased dosage\nand exposure to the employment intervention was associated\nwith decreased self-reported substance use and criminality\namong the drug court clients. Although findings from both the\nRoll et al. (2005) and Leukefeld et al. demonstrate a promising\nrelationship between being employed, receiving employment\ntraining, and decreased substance use and criminality, there\nstill remains a gap in knowledge regarding the extent to which\nhaving a substance use history affects the relationship between\ncriminal history and post-treatment employment and gross\nincome outcomes.\nSummary of the MaricopaCounty FTDO Program\nData for this study were taken from the Arizona,\nMaricopaCounty, FTDO Program. This study is a secondary\ndata analysis of the FTDO program participants'earnings and\nemployment outcomes. The researchers who collected the\ndata for the FTDO study were concerned with measuring the\ndrug usage and recidivism outcomes of probationers\n(Deschenes et al., 1996). Participants in the program were ran-\ndomly assigned to either standard probation with varying drug\ntesting and probation supervision schedules in the control\ngroup or they were assigned to drug court and intensive drug\ntreatment, which was the experimental group, for a 12-month\nperiod. The method for randomly assigning research partici-\npants into the control and experimental groups was managed\nby a computer program (Deschenes et al., 1996).\nWithin the control group, probationers were randomly\nassigned to three different tracks which differed in their\nChintakrindi et al. 5\nfrequency of urine-analysis testing and probation supervision\ndosage. All three tracks were assigned probation supervision\nwith varying schedules of supervision dosage. Probationers in\nTrack 1 did not receive any urine-analysis testing and the fre-\nquency of visits with the probation officers were determined\nby both scores from a risk and needs assessment. Probationers\nin Track 2 received low-frequency urine-analysis testing once\na month and visited once bimonthly with a probation officer.\nProbationers in Track 3 received high-frequency urine-analy-\nsis testing biweekly and visited with the probation officer\nonce bimonthly (Deschenes & Greenwood, 1994).\nThe intensive treatment program, for the experimental\ngroup, in Track 4, emphasized a biopsychosocial treatment\nmodel that sought to treat the whole individual, rather than\nfocus solely on drug use. An assumption of the biopsychoso-\ncial treatment model is that drug use is a symptom of other\nproblems that may include but is not limited to poor coping\nskills related to family dysfunction, anxiety, self-esteem,\nanger, or codependency (Deschenes & Greenwood, 1994).\nOffenders in the experimental group received the treatment\nintervention in three phases, each of which lasted 2 months.\nThe first phase, the orientation, provided weekly drug edu-\ncation, social skills training, and a 12-step meeting focused\non providing drug education and relapse prevention. The\nsecond phase, known as stabilization, focused primarily on\nrelapse prevention. The third and final phase, known as tran-\nsition, required probationers to attend one process group\nmeeting and one 12-step meeting once a week. The treatment\nprotocol and underlying theory guiding the experimental\nintervention has been exhaustively detailed by Deschenes\nResearch participants in the experimental group, Track 4,\nreceived probation supervision through a drug court program\nthat included random urine-analysis testing, probation super-\nvision, and intensive outpatient drug treatment that included\ncounseling, drug treatment, relapse prevention, social skills\ntraining, and group therapy. The drug court, provided offend-\ners with a contract, outlining expectations and the structure\nof the program. The judge in the program explained to the\noffenders how rewards and punishments are associated with\nurine-analysis outcomes. Probationers, who consistently had\nnegative urine-analysis outcomes, indicating no drug use,\nreceived reduced jail time and probation sentences. For pro-\nbationers with positive urine-analysis outcomes, indicating\ndrug use, the judge had the option of ordering probationers to\nrepeat phases of treatment, more drug testing, or jail time\nResearch Questions\nOur study seeks to understand the main effects of substance\nuse and criminal history on post-treatment employment and\nincome outcomes among probationers participating in the\nMaricopa County, Arizona, Experimental Drug Treatment\nStudy at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods (Deschenes\n& Greenwood, 1994). This study is interested in examining\nthe moderating effect that having a substance use history has\non the relationship between criminal history and employ-\nment outcomes at the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.\nMoreover, this study is interested in examining the moderat-\ning effect that having a substance use history has on the rela-\ntionship between criminal history and income outcomes at\nthe 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.\nHypotheses\nIn this study, we hypothesize that probationers with sub-\nstance use histories have an increased odds of reporting\nunemployment at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-\nods. Moreover, we hypothesize that probationers with crimi-\nnal histories have an increased likelihood of reporting\nunemployment at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-\nods. We hypothesize that having a substance use history has\na moderating effect on the relationship between having a\ncriminal history and decreased odds of unemployment at\nboth the 6- and 12-month follow-up period. More specifi-\ncally, we hypothesize that probationers reporting a substance\nuse history will strengthen the relationship between having a\ncriminal history and decreased odds of unemployment at\nboth the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.\nSimilarly, we hypothesize that probationers with sub-\nstance use histories compared with those without substance\nuse histories have decreased gross incomes at both the 6- and\n12-month follow-up periods. Moreover, we hypothesize that\nprobationers with criminal histories compared with those\nwithout criminal histories have decreased gross incomes at\nthe follow-up periods. We hypothesize that having a sub-\nstance use history has a moderating effect on the relationship\nbetween having a criminal history and decreased gross\nincome outcomes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-\nods. More specifically, we hypothesize that reporting a sub-\nstance use history will strengthen the relationship between\nhaving a criminal history and decreased gross income out-\ncomes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.\nMethod\nData\nFor this study, we conducted a secondary data analysis of the\nMaricopa County, Arizona, adult probation experimental\ndrug testing program data, which was collected between the\nwere accessed using the Interuniversity Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research (ICPSR) website.\nSample\nProbationers in this study were sentenced between 1992 and\n1993. The probationers agreed to participate in the Maricopa\n6 SAGE Open\nCounty Adult Probation Department (Arizona) drug court\nexperiment. The Maricopa County FTDO program is a post-\nadjudication drug treatment program for offenders sentenced\nto probation for a felony drug offense (Deschenes et al.,\n1996). Offenders who were eligible for the FTDO program\nhad first time convictions for possession of marijuana, dan-\ngerous drugs, narcotics, or drug paraphernalia (Deschenes &\nGreenwood, 1994). Offenders convicted of drug sales or traf-\nficking were not eligible to participate in the research study.\nMeasures\nIn this study, we use a retrospective case\u00adcontrol design, in\nwhich employment and earnings among probationers\nwere compared in terms of their expression by social-\ndemographic, psychosocial, and criminal and substance use\nhistory characteristics. The measures we will use for our\nfinal multivariate models were specified based on the extant\nliterature discussed in the literature review and through iden-\ntifying statistically significant indicators during our bivariate\nanalyses.\nOutcome variables.In this study, we will examine both\nemployment and gross earnings outcomes among probation-\ners, which include the employment status and gross earnings\nof probationers at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up peri-\nods. We dichotomously coded the employment status (0 =\nunemployed or had part-time/full-time employment = 1) at\nboth the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. The gross earn-\nings variable is a continuously coded, ratio level, measure\nthat is used to measure monetary earnings at both the 6- and\n12-month follow-up period.\nPredictor variables. For this study, we will be controlling for\nseven items that are indicators of the social-demographic\nbackground characteristics among the probationers. The\nstudy track variable was originally coded as the control\ngroup (Tracks 1-3) and treatment group (Track 4). The study\ntrack variable in this study will be recoded into a discrete\ndichotomously coded variable that will be operationalized as\n1 = treatment group and 0 = control group. The demographic\ndata that will be used in this study include the age of the\noffender entering the research study, gender of the offender\n(1 = male or 0 = female), race (1 = non-White or 0 = White),\neducation level of offender (1 = high graduate or 0 = not high\nschool graduate), relationship status (1 = has relationship or\n0 = single), and living status (1 = living alone or 0 = living\nwith at least one person).\nWe will be controlling for six items that are indicators of\npsychosocial characteristics. The psychosocial variables that\nwe will use in this study include data on the attitudes toward\ncomplying with the law (1 = not motivated to change, ratio-\nnalizes behavior or 0 = motivated or somewhat motivated to\nchange), marital and family relationships (1 = some or major\nfamily dysfunction or 0 = exceptionally or relatively stable\nfamily functioning), peer associations (1 = has occasional or\ncompletely negative relationships or 0 = good or no negative\nrelationships), physical health (1 = some or severe health\ndysfunction or 0 = sound health), emotional stability (1 =\nsome or severe limits to emotional functioning or 0 = excep-\ntionally or appropriately adjusted), and probation officer\nassessment of probationer needs (1 = probation officer\nassessment indicates moderate or high needs or 0 = probation\nofficer assessment indicates well-adjusted or no needs). The\npsychosocial variables were originally coded using multiple\nindicators. We collapsed the indicators into dichotomously\ncoded binary categories.\nWe will be examining seven items that are indicators of\ncriminal history. The variables we will include in this study\nwill be dichotomously coded variables including the number\nof prior arrests (1 = one or more prior arrests or 0 = no prior\narrests), number of prior misdemeanor convictions (one or\nmore prior misdemeanor convictions or 0 = no prior misde-\nmeanor convictions), number of prior felony convictions\n(one or more prior felony convictions or 0 = no prior felony\nconvictions), prior jail history (1 = yes has been to jail or 0 =\nno has never been to jail), prior prison history (1 = yes has\nbeen to prison or 0 = no has never been to prison), employed\nprior to arrest (1 = yes employed prior to arrest or 0 = not\nemployed prior to arrest), and history of drug dealing (1 =\nyes has dealt drugs or 0 = no has not dealt drugs).\nWe will be examining nine items that are indicators of\nsubstance use history. We will be dichotomously coding each\nof the specific drug use indicators (1 = used substance and 0\n= did not use substance). We will create an aggregate mea-\nsure using the data from the individual substance use history\nvariables to measure history of any drug use (1 = yes has\nhistory of any drug use or 0 = no does not have history of any\ndrug use). In addition, we will measure substance use treat-\nment prior to arrest using a dichotomously coded indicator\n(1 = yes has previously been enrolled in substance use treat-\nment or 0 = no has not been previously enrolled in substance\nuse treatment). Finally, we will use a dichotomously coded\nindicator of whether probations were enrolled in substance\nuse treatment at the time of their arrest (1 = yes enrolled in\nsubstance use treatment or 0 = no not enrolled in substance\nuse treatment).\nPlan of Analysis\nFor this study, we begin by providing descriptive statistics\nusing percentages and means for the outcome variables at the\n6- and 12-month follow-up periods. Moreover, we will pres-\nent descriptive statistics for the predictor variables: demo-\ngraphic characteristics, treatment condition, criminal history,\nand substance use history. Next, we will be conducting bivar-\niate statistical analysis of the employment and gross earnings\noutcomes with predictor variables for the purpose of identi-\nfying marginally or statistically significant relationships with\nan alpha value of less than .10. The employment outcome\nChintakrindi et al. 7\nvariable measured at the follow-up periods is discrete and\ndichotomously coded. Therefore, we will use a chi-square test\nto examine the relationship between employment outcomes\nand predictor variables. Using an independent sample t test,\nwe will examine the relationship between gross earnings and\npredictor variables. For continuously coded predictor vari-\nables, we will use a Pearson's r correlational test for examin-\ning their relationship to gross earnings. This will allow us to\nidentify the magnitude and direction of marginally or statisti-\ncally significant relationships between predictor and outcome\nvariables with an alpha value of less than .10.\nFinally, we will identify predictor variables that were\nfound to be theoretically important in the extant literature\nand statistically or marginally significantly during our\nexploratory bivariate analyses. These predictor variables will\nthen be used to specify our hierarchical logistic regression\nand hierarchical multiple regression models for predicting\nearnings and employment outcomes. Hierarchical regression\nis used when there is a lack of independence across levels of\nclustered data. Sung and Richter (2006) report that the hier-\narchical regression technique can control for temporal and\nspatial clustering of data when testing predictive models\nusing data with similar background characteristics. A lack of\nindependence across levels of clustered data can result in\nincorrect point estimates, confidence intervals, standard\nerrors, and p values, which are threats to both internal and\nexternal validity (Sung & Richter, 2006). We are attempting\nto determine which criminal history and substance use his-\ntory variables are robust for predicting employment out-\ncomes for probationers when controlling for background and\npsychosocial characteristics.\nThe output that will be reported and interpreted for the\nlogistic regression analysis includes the -2 log likelihood for\nthe fully reduced model and the related 2 for the full model\nand related significance levels to determine whether input-\nting independent variables improves the model fitness. The\nresults that are reported and interpreted include the odds\nratios and significance levels for each predictor variable. The\noutput that will be reported and interpreted for the multiple\nregression analysis include the R2, F-value, model signifi-\ncance, unstandardized regression coefficients, and signifi-\ncance of coefficients.\nWe hypothesize that indication of a prior criminal history\nseparately predicts a decrease in employment and earnings\noutcomes at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up periods.\nThe moderator hypothesis is that substance use will\nstrengthen the relationship between criminal history and\nemployment and earnings outcomes. The model diagrammed\nin Figure 1 has three causal paths that affect the post-treat-\nment employment and earnings outcomes. Path A examines\nthe main effect of the predictor, substance use history, on\npost-treatment employment and earnings outcomes. Path B\nexamines the \"impact of controllability as a moderator\"\n(Baron & Kenny, 1986). The moderator in Path B for this\nstudy is substance use history. Path C examines whether\nthere is a significant interaction between criminal history and\nsubstance use history when separately predicting both\nemployment and earnings outcomes.\nIf a significant interaction effect is observed, then we can\ninterpret our observation as a moderation effect. However, to\ndetermine whether our moderator hypothesis is supported, it\nis necessary to interpret the magnitude and direction of the\ninteraction effect. Baron and Kenny (1986) report that there\nmay be significant main effects for both the predictor and\nmoderator; however, the main effects are not conceptually\nrelevant to testing the moderator hypothesis. Baron and\nKenny also report that the moderator variable should be\nuncorrelated to both the predictor and outcome variable to\nclearly interpret the interaction term between the predictor\nand moderator (Path C). Moderators and predictors are both\nconsidered exogenous variables and are always considered\nindependent variables that are causally antecedent to the out-\nThe moderator hypothesis for our research question is\ntested by computing an interaction term between the predic-\ntor variable (criminal history) and the moderating variable\n(substance use history). To avoid issues with multi-collinearity,\nthe criminal history for each case was centered by subtracting\nthe overall mean from each individual case for the criminal\nhistory variable. Next, an interaction was computed between\nthe centered criminal history and the substance use history\nby multiplying the two variables. Finally, both of the main\neffects, the interaction term and control variables, will be\nentered into the model to predict the employment and earn-\nings outcome variables.\nMissing Data\nFor this study, we highlight the percentage of missing data in\nour descriptive statistics. Among predictor variables the per-\ncentage of missing data ranged from 0% to 10.4% missing.\nFor predictor variables, we observed a relatively low per-\ncentage of missing data, especially when compared with\nmissing data among our earnings and employment outcome\nvariables for this study. Among the outcome variables, we\nobserved that the percentage of missing data ranging from\nfollow-up periods. For this study, we listwise deleted cases\nFigure 1. Moderator hypothesis testing of criminal history and\nsubstance use history.\n8 SAGE Open\nwith missing predictor or outcome variable data. We did not\nattempt to impute missing outcome variable data because\nWood, White, and Thompson (2004) discuss that when a\nlarge percentage of outcome data is imputed this can lead to\nbias in statistical interpretation, particularly if it is missing\ndata for outcome variables.\nGiven the large percentage of missing outcome data and\nan analysis of missing data using the Missing Value Analysis\nmodule in IBM SPSS v.22, we find that our data is missing\ncompletely at random and is unrelated to baseline covariates.\nPorter and Ecklund (2012) provide an extensive discussion\non \"active nonresponders\" which are described as research\nparticipants that complete a portion of the study but refuse to\nor are unable to complete the rest of the survey for individ-\nual-level reasons.

Our specification of our theoretical\nconstructs for criminal history is the product of identifying\nthree separate items that are representative of criminal history\nin the extant literature. In our final model, we use the follow-\ning indicators for criminal history: prior arrests, previous jail\ncommitments, and employment prior to arrest. For represent-\ning an overarching construct of substance use history, we use\nany history of illegal substance use and history of using uppers.\nBoth substance use history indicators were found to be statisti-\ncally significant in our bivariate analysis.\nLogistic regression analysis for predicting employment status at\nthe 6- and 12-month follow-up. We observe a statistically sig-\nnificant model for predicting employment outcomes at the\n6-month follow-up when all of the control and predictor vari-\nables are inputted into the final model (Model 5) using hier-\narchical logistic regression (p< .05). In Table 2, we observe\nthat probationers who indicated having one or more prior\narrests decreased their odds of gaining employment by 0.133\ntimes at the 6-month follow-up compared with probationers\nwho did not have prior arrests (p< .05). Probationers who\nwere employed prior to their arrest increased their odds of\ngaining employment at the 6-month follow-up by 2.971 times\ncompared with probationers who were not employed prior to\narrest (p< .05). Probationers who indicated having used\nuppers at least one time had decreased their odds of gaining\nemployment by 0.405 times at the 6-month follow-up com-\npared with probationers who never tried uppers (p< .10). We\nfound no significant interaction to support our moderation\nhypothesis. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 demonstrates that our\nfinal model explains a moderate 20% of the variation in the\nemployment outcome at the 6-month follow-up.\nIn Table 3, we observe a statistically significant model for\npredicting employment outcomes at the 12-month follow-up\nChintakrindi et al. 11\nwhen all of the control and predictor variables are inputted into\nthe third model using hierarchical logistic regression (p< .05).\nWe will be interpreting the findings from Model 3. We observe\nthat probationers who indicated being assigned to the treatment\ngroup increased their odds of gaining employment by 3.411\ntimes at the 12-month follow-up compared with probationers\nwho were assigned to the control group (p< .05).

The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 demonstrates that\nour third model explains a moderate 19% of the variation in the\nemployment outcome at the 12-month follow-up. The subse-\nquent Models 4 and 5 were only marginally significant (p< .10).\nAdding the substance use history and interaction variables into\nthe final model did not statistically significantly improve the\nfinal models predictability of employment outcomes.\nMultiple regression analysis for predicting gross earnings at the\n6- and 12-month follow-up. We observe a statistically significant\nmodel for predicting gross earnings outcomes at the 6-month\nfollow-up when including all of the predictor and control vari-\nables into the final model (p< .01). In Table 4, we observe a\nstatistically significant finding that probationers who live alone\nmake 367.33 dollars more than probationers living with one or\nmore individuals (p< .01). We observe a marginally significant\nfinding that probationers with negative relationships make\n136.19 dollars less than probationers with positive relation-\nships (p< .10).

Probationers with a\nhigh school diploma or greater are predicted to make 200 dollars\nmore than probationers without a high school education. This\nfinding replicates the previous empirical literature that demon-\nstrates the pro-social and economic advantages of increased edu-\ncation on employment and earnings outcomes for offenders\nWhen examining employment outcomes, we controlled\nfor psychosocial indicators and found that those indicators\nwere not significantly predictive of employment at both the\n6- and 12-month follow-up periods. However, when examin-\ning gross earnings outcomes, we did find that reporting hav-\ning negative peer-relationships and poor health were\npredictive of decreased earnings at the 12-month follow-up.\nThese findings are important and problematic for our study.\nThey are important because they highlight that psychosocial\nindicators are important empirical correlates of socio-\neconomic performance, particularly for predicting gross\nearnings. However, these findings are problematic because\nthey are not a consistent set of indicators across our analysis\nof both earnings and employment outcomes. Therefore, we\nare unable to definitively conclude whether our psychosocial\nindicators may have a deeper and more meaningful signifi-\ncance for explaining substance use history, criminal history,\nemployment outcomes, and earnings outcomes.\nIt is possible that there is a latent or unobservable behav-\nioral, cognitive, or personality construct that may serve to min-\nimize spurious relationships between both our predictor and\noutcome variables in this study. Future studies of employment\nand earnings outcomes among offenders should consider mea-\nsuring the dimensionality of low self-control or social learning\nand its effects on offending and analogous behaviors (Akers,\ndemonstrates substance use and criminal history are viewed by\nemployers as negative credentials and barriers to employment,\nour primary concern is that substance use and criminal history\nmay be symptomatic of deeper psychopathological disposi-\nWhen examining the relationship between indicators of\ncriminal history and employment outcomes in our study, we\nfound that having one or more priors arrests significantly\ndecreased the odds of having employment at the 6-month\nTable 4.

Similarly, we found that having a history of hav-\ning been to jail significantly decreased the odds of employ-\nment at the 12-month follow-up. Although we did not\nobserve our indicators being consistently significant across\nour models, we do have strong empirical evidence to suggest\nthat criminal history indicators have a main effect on odds of\nemployment. When including commonly controlled for con-\ntextual factors into our model, such as, race and education\nlevel, our findings remain significant and robust. This find-\ning is important because it demonstrates that employability\namong probationers is significantly reduced by repeated con-\ntact with the criminal justice system. Our findings support\nPager's (2003) hypothesis that criminal records serve as\nnegative credentials by signaling to employers that the pro-\nspective employee is unreliable and a potential liability.\nLimitations\nThe primary limitation for our study is related to missing data.\nThe amount of missing data in this study may be resulting in\nType II errors, where we are failing to reject the null hypoth-\nesis as a result of unreliable and small coefficient estimates.\nWe acknowledge that missing data are problematic in our\nstudy; nevertheless, we observe that indicators of criminal\nhistory and substance use are marginally and statistically sig-\nnificant predictors of employment and earnings outcomes in a\nnumber of our models. We do not believe that data imputation\nwould be appropriate because it may result in manipulation\nof coefficient estimates and standard errors that do not val-\nidly reflect the true nature of our sample data. We want to\npreserve the integrity of the data and present it in its original\nA secondary limitation of our study is that we did not con-\nduct a factor analysis of possible latent constructs or theoreti-\ncal dimensions. We used dichotomously coded variables as\nindicators rather than creating composite indicators using fac-\ntor analysis or confirmatory factor analysis. We avoided creat-\ning composite measures for substance use and criminal history\nusing factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis because\nwe wanted to identify, isolate, and model individual variables\nand examine their relationships with post-treatment employ-\nment and gross earnings outcomes. We are interested in under-\nstanding the relationship between specific indicators of\nsubstance use and criminal history among probationers and to\nmeasure their effects on specific outcome variables. We\nbelieve that our use of concrete indicators will allow for more\nparsimonious interpretation and replication of our models.\nEthical Considerations\nThis study was designated as exempt by the Institutional\nReview Board at California State University, Stanislaus.\nThis study used secondary data that were publicly available\nfrom ICPSR (Deschenes, Turner, & Greenwood, 2013).\nTable 5.
