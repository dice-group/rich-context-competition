The\nmulti-national Health Behavior in School Aged Children Study shows that no fewer than\n9% and as many as 54% of school aged children from the 25 nations studied are involved\nin aggressive acts toward peers, are victimized by peers, or both (Nansel et al., 2004). The\napparent ubiquity of these behaviors in children and adolescents has made their study and\nprevention important educational and public health goals (Berger, 2007; Hawley, Little,\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nand educational psychologists have dominated the study and interpretation of these\nbehaviors, several researchers have proposed that these behaviors can and should be\nunderstood from the perspective of evolutionary theory (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002;\nTwo recent studies use evolutionary principles to link peer victimization in\nadolescence with mating and intrasexual competition. Leenaars, Dane, and Marini (2008)\nfound that female adolescents who considered themselves attractive were at higher risk for\nindirect victimization (e.g., hurtful rumor spreading) than their non-victimized peers. The\nauthors interpret these results as a form of intrasexual competition between female\nadolescents whereby attractive girls become targets of victimization by other girls who are\ncompeting for mating opportunities. This interpretation follows the logic that males favor\nattractive females (Buss, 1988, 1989) and females compete with each other for high quality,\nattractive mates (Buss, 1988; Buss and Dedden, 1990). Indirect aggression may become a\nbehavioral/functional tool to lower the competitive value of rival girls by signaling the\nvictim's promiscuity and possible infidelity to potential male mates (Buss and Dedden,\n1990). The indirect nature of the behavior reduces the chance of physical harm which is a\npredicted element of female aggressive competition (Campbell, 1999). Victimized females\nmay not suffer in number of available short-term sex partners, but may be hindered in their\ncompetition for genetically superior long-term mates due to reputational damage (Buss and\nGallup, O'Brien, White and Wilson (2009) found that 85% of victimization in\nadolescence is directed toward same-sex peers as predicted by results from large school\nshowed that female victims of indirect aggression started having sex at earlier ages and had\nmore lifetime sex partners in early adulthood than their peers who were either not\nvictimized or less victimized in adolescence. The opposite relationship was true for males,\nas victimization in adolescence was negatively correlated with lifetime number of sex\npartners and the rate of sex partners per year.\nIntrasexual aggression is one of many functional and potentially adaptive responses to\ncompetition with mating rivals and the retention of opposite-sex partners (Buss and\nShackelford, 1997). From a functional point of view, researchers have found that\naggressive behavior towards peers lowers self-esteem and self-regard in victimized children\nand adolescents (Egan and Perry, 1998; Salmivalli, Kaukiainen, Kaistaniemi, and\nLagerspetz, 1999; Rigby, 2002). In adolescent females, this reduction in self-esteem could\nlead to (1) reduced dating/mating opportunities due to marginalization and ostracism or (2)\nto increased short-term sexual encounters as these teens seek short-term affairs that boost\nself-esteem (Greiling and Buss, 2000). Numerous short-term mating opportunities favor\nmale reproductive strategies but may be costly to females who could be perceived as\npromiscuous or potentially unfaithful to males.\nOther researchers have shown that self-esteem is lower in children and adolescents who\nare (1) victimized, (2) aggressive toward peers, or (3) considered both bullies and victims\n(Rigby and Cox, 1996; O'Moore and Kirkham, 2001). High self-esteem appears to protect\nchildren and adolescents from both perpetrating and being victimized by these negative\nsocial interactions with peers (O'Moore and Kirkham, 2001). Adolescents with high self-\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nesteem may compete with peers using more prosocial behavior and may be better able to\navoid aggressive interactions. High self-esteem may play a role in the disparate\nreproductive strategies of males and females.\nIn adolescent males, aggressive behavior is employed to maintain status in the social\ndominance hierarchy (Hawley, 1999; Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002; Pellegrini and\nBartini, 2000). Those who are victimized descend in the hierarchy and have less access to\nresources including mating opportunities. Cross-culturally, females tend to prefer high\nstatus males who control or have the potential to control resources (Buss, 1988). In\nadolescent females, however, the reproductive value of social dominance is the ability to be\nchoosy about dating and mating partners and priority access to resources such as alliances,\nfriendships, and information (Hawley, 2007). In this study we examine the interaction\nbetween reproductive opportunities in adulthood and both indirect peer aggression and\nindirect peer victimization during adolescence. Previous work has shown that victimization\nand aggression in adolescence are not mutually exclusive and therefore need to be\nconsidered together. Survey data from young adults were collected to test three\nhypotheses.\nHypotheses\nHypothesis 1. Females who report higher than average indirect aggression towards\nsame-sex peers in adolescence will also report earlier ages at first sexual intercourse.\nRecent research has shown that mating motivates increased intrasexual indirect\naggression in young adult females (Griskevicius, Tybur, Gangestad, Perea, Shapiro, and\nKenrick, 2009). If indirect aggression toward same-sex peers has an adaptive evolutionary\norigin by increasing social dominance or by lowering a victim's self-esteem, we expect\nindirectly aggressive females to achieve a measure of reproductive benefit from these\nbehaviors. In fact, several researchers have found that girls who used indirect aggression\ntowards peers were more likely to be nominated as potential dating partners and were more\nlikely to begin dating at earlier ages (Connolly, Pepler, Craig, and Taradash, 2000;\nPellegrini and Long, 2003; Vaillancourt, 2005). In females, the initiation of dating and\nsexual intercourse at an early age increases the length of the reproductive window and may\nsubsequently increase total fertility (Wood, 1994). Therefore, we expect females who used\nindirect aggression during adolescence to report earlier ages at first sexual intercourse than\nless aggressive peers.\nHypothesis 2. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict fewer than average\nsex partners and later than average ages at first intercourse in males.\nWe expect that males who are victimized during adolescence will suffer damage to\ntheir standing in the social hierarchy and therefore find themselves selected less often by\nfemales for mating opportunities (Buss, 1988). If indirect victimization delays the onset of\nsexual relations and reduces the victim's desirability to the opposite sex, it becomes an\neffective evolutionary strategy for the aggressor (Buss and Dedden, 1990; Gallup et al.,\nHypothesis 3. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict higher than average\nsex partners and earlier than average ages at first intercourse in females.\nGallup et al. (2009) demonstrated that female victims in their sample entered into\nsexual relationships earlier and had higher than average numbers of sex partners than less\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nvictimized peers. This hypothesis appears counter-intuitive because it suggests that having\nmore reproductive opportunities is detrimental to reproductive fitness. However,\nreputational damage can occur when females are perceived by males to be promiscuous\nwhich ultimately leads to reduced opportunities for long-term, high quality male mates.\nOwens, Shute, and Slee (2000) have shown that girls denigrate victims with terms such as\n\"slut\" or \"whore\" and focus negative attention on physical appearance and dress. These\naggressive acts aim directly at the sources of male attraction; fidelity and physical\nattractiveness (Buss, 1989). Leenaar's et al. (2008) demonstrated that attractive girls report\nhigh levels of indirect victimization suggesting that female aggressors target rivals who are\nthe most attractive potential mates.\nIt is important to note that early experience with sexual behavior may also provide\nvictims with some evolutionary benefits by expanding the length of time that they may\nreproduce. However, these benefits need to be weighed in terms of the quality of mates\nand future resource allocations provided by what may be inferior or uncommitted male\npartners.\nSomewhat more straightforward is the alternate hypothesis which suggests that\nfemales victimized in adolescence are also marginalized from the mating pool, and thus\nwill have likely experienced a later onset of sexual activity and will have had fewer sexual\npartners in early adulthood. Since victimization in adolescence does not preclude\nperpetrating aggressive behavior as well, it is important to determine the effects of\nvictimization while controlling for aggression.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited from introductory level psychology classes at the\nUniversity at Albany. Students received class credit for their participation. The University\nInstitutional Review Board approved this research and all participants signed informed\nconsent agreements. Participants included 82 heterosexual males and 61 heterosexual\nIn preparation for statistical analyses, we eliminated outlying data points that\nexceeded three standard deviations below the mean for age at first sex and three standard\ndeviations above the mean for number of sex partners. We also included only sexually\nexperienced participants. Statistical analyses were ultimately conducted on 68 male and 51\nfemale participants.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mean ages at first\nyears respectively (Mosher, Chandra, and Jones, 2005). The participants retained in this\nstudy reported a mean age at first intercourse of M = 16.13, SD = 1.61 for males and M =\n16.75, SD = 1.45 for females. The median number of opposite-sex lifetime sexual partners\nof young adults slightly exceeds this national average with males M = 4.22, SD = 3.80 and\nfemales M = 3.41, SD = 3.14, however we only included sexual experienced individuals.\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nSurvey\nParticipants were asked to fill out an anonymous social experiences survey that\nincluded questions about how often they demeaned-diminished-embarrassed, teased,\nexcluded, or isolated peers in middle school and high school and how often they were the\nvictim of these behaviors during the same period. Although there is some debate about\nwhat these behaviors should be called, we recognize all of these behaviors as non-physical\nmeans of manipulating the social environment either through peers or other\nsocial/relational means (Bj\u00f6rkquist, 2001; Bj\u00f6rkqvist, Lagerspetz, Kaukainen, 1992;\nVaillancourt, 2005). Middle school was defined in the survey as grades six through eight\nand high school as grades nine through twelve. Survey questions were modified from\nNewman, Holden, and Delville (2005) and used previously in Gallup, White, and Gallup\n(2007) and Gallup et al. (2009). Participants were also asked if they had engaged in sexual\nintercourse, their age at first sexual intercourse, and their number of sexual partners.\nIn order to better understand the level of sexual experience in our sample we\ncalculated a ratio of partners per year of sexual activity by dividing the mean number of\nsexual partners by the years of sexual activity. This variable captures rate of sexual\nactivity, and thus provides a measure of relative promiscuity. The number of years of\nsexual activity was calculated by subtracting from the participant's age their age at first\nsexual intercourse.\nIndices were created using the variables above for high school and middle school\nindirect aggression and indirect victimization by adding the score for each of the four\nLikert scale responses (i.e. demeaned-diminished-embarrassed, teased, excluded, or\nisolated). The minimum score is four and the maximum score is 20. Pearson correlation\ncoefficients were calculated to probe the relationship between aggression, victimization,\nand the measures of reproductive behavior.\nWe also performed a principal components analysis (PCA) on the individual\naggression and victimization variables because the aggression and victimization index\nresults were significantly correlated. We chose to perform a PCA to produce uncorrelated\nfactors to use as independent variables. Sixteen questions in total were utilized in the PCA.\nMales and female PCA were performed separately based on theoretical evidence\nsuggesting that males and females have different sexual strategies and styles of aggressive\nmale and female sample can be supplied by the first author. Statistical analysis was\nconducted with R (R Development Core Team, 2008). R is a high level, freely available\nstatistical programming language and environment (Crawley, 2007).\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the dependent variables in this study.\nIndependent t-tests confirm that there were no statistically significant differences between\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nTable 1.

In males, high\nschool aggression is correlated with high school victimization, and middle school\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\naggression but not middle school victimization. These results add to the evidence for sex\ndifferences in indirect aggression during adolescence.\nTable 3. Pearson correlations of survey indices and reproductive behavior.\n1.

The first principal component\nexplains the overall level of involvement in peer aggression as either a victim or an\naggressor (Table 3). Forty-eight percent of male participants and 39% of female\nparticipants loaded negatively on PC1 which represents greater involvement in aggression,\nvictimization or both. This rate of involvement is higher than the 29.9% rate reported for\nU.S. school children by Nansel, Overpeck, Pilla, Ruan, Simons-Morton, and Scheidt (2001)\nin their analysis of the World Health Organization Health Behavior and School-aged\nChildren survey. However, this rate did not exceed the maximum level reported in the\ninternational study (Nansel et al., 2004) and is based on only non-virgins.\nThe second principal component explains the level of aggression and victimization\nreported by participants on a continuum from most victimized to most aggressive. The\nfactor loadings of the first and second principal components are listed in Table 4. Table 4\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nTable 4.

Factor loadings sorted on PC2 from most extreme to least extreme.\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nshows that both male and female indirect aggression loaded positively on PC2 while being\nvictimized loaded negatively on PC2. Figure 1A and 1B show male and female\nparticipants plotted on PC1 and PC2. The figures also demonstrate the relationship\nbetween age at onset of sexual intercourse and the first two principal components. We note\nthat 82% of the females in the top left quadrant in Figure 1B had sex at or earlier than age\n16 years. This quadrant represents active indirect aggression towards peers. The mean age\nat first sex in the active aggression quadrant (M = 16.318, SD = 1.46) is the lowest of all\nfour quadrants, however a one-way ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant\nAs expected, Figure 1 shows that the variance along PC2 is reduced for the portion\nof the sample that loads positively on PC1 (i.e., overall lack of involvement in indirect\naggression). That is, the sample of individuals who were actively involved in peer\naggression or victimization varies widely in the frequency of perpetrating or experiencing\nthe behaviors in our survey (e.g., teasing).\nThe factor loadings on PC2 indicate that there is an expected developmental\ndecrease in the importance of indirect aggression and victimization in females from middle\nschool to high school. The factors that load most highly in females are middle school\nexcluding, isolating and teasing on the aggression side and being demeaned, teased and\nFigure 1.

In males there was an unexpected\nreversal of the high school and middle school aggression variables indicating that high\nschool demeaning, teasing and excluding were the most influential variables. This may be\na product of the salience of mating related indirect aggression in older males. That is, older\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nmales are more likely to be competing for mating opportunities and using indirectly\naggressive tactics. The male victimization results show that middle school isolation,\nexclusion and teasing were the most influential variables.\nResults indicate that 93% of male participants who reported being indirectly\nvictimized by peers in high school or middle school were victimized by other boys.\nSimilarly, females reported being victimized by other girls 72% of the time. Participants\nwho were indirectly aggressive toward their peers indicated that the target of their\naggression was most often same-sex peers (males = 97%, females = 84%). These data\nsupport the hypothesis that peer aggression is a form of intrasexual competition (Pellegrini,\nHypothesis 1: Age at first intercourse and indirect aggression in females.\nIn order to test Hypothesis 1, we performed a multiple regression analysis on age at\nfirst sexual intercourse (dependent variable), and the first two principal components\n(independent variables) which are uncorrelated representations of the 16 aggression and\nvictimization variables. The results of the multiple regression analysis are depicted in\nTable 5. The multiple R2 of the model indicates that approximately 17% of the variance in\nage at first sexual intercourse in females can be explained by PC1 and PC2. The model can\nbe simplified even further to include age at first sexual intercourse and PC2 as depicted in\nFigure 2. The Pearson correlation coefficient between age at first sexual intercourse and\nsexual intercourse. In other words, the more indirect aggression a girl perpetrates the\nearlier she is likely to begin having sex. On the other hand, the more indirect victimization\ngirls experience (particularly in middle school) the older the girl is predicted to be at first\nsexual intercourse. Hypothesis 1 is therefore supported by these data.\nTable 5.

Multiple R-squared: 0.167, Adjusted R-squared:\nHypothesis 2. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict fewer than average\nsex partners and later than average ages at first intercourse in males.\nFor males, PC1 and PC2 did not predict the onset of sexual relations. The\ncorrelation between PC2 and age at first sexual intercourse was r = -.130, p = .315. The\nnegative slope indicates that male perpetrators of indirect aggression have slightly earlier\nages at first sexual intercourse and victims of indirect aggression have later ages at first\nsexual intercourse but the relationship is not statistically significant. Similarly, the\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nrelationship between number of sex partners and PC2 and partners per year and PC2 are in\nthe predicted direction but the relationships are not statistically significant (number of sex\nFigure 2. Scatter plot and regression line of female PC2 and age at first sexual intercourse.\nHypothesis 3. Indirect victimization in adolescence will predict higher than average\nsex partners and earlier than average ages at first intercourse in females.\nFor females, the correlation between number of sex partners and PC2 is r =.220, p =\npartners and PC2 is not in the predicted direction suggested by Gallup et al. (2009) but\nlarger sample sizes are needed to explore these relationships further.\nThese results suggest a weak relationship between male and female reproductive\nopportunities and indirect aggression/victimization but Hypotheses 2 and 3 are not\nsupported statistically.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we collected retrospective data on the level of aggression and\nvictimization experienced by young adults to see how well these data predict reproductive\nopportunity and how well they support an adaptive role for indirect aggression. The study\nparticipants were mainly young adults beginning their most fecund period. Completed\nfertility is unknown in this group and we estimated reproductive opportunity through\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nmeasures of sexual behavior such as number of sex partners and age at first sexual\nintercourse. The study design is limited by the participant's ability to remember past\nevents and their truthfulness in responding to questions, however, the majority of\nparticipants were only between one and ten years removed from the adolescent events we\ninvestigated. One further limitation is that we did not collect information about marital\nstatus and long-term relationship status. These questions will be added to future research\nprojects.\nThis study's major finding is the significant relationship between age at first sexual\nintercourse and PC2 which represents a continuum from indirect aggression to indirect\nvictimization in females. We show that indirect aggression is associated with earlier ages\nat first sexual intercourse, and thus victimization is associated with later ages at first sexual\nintercourse. In a natural fertility population, age at first sexual intercourse is a proximate\ndeterminant of total fertility and provides an important evolutionary advantage to females\nwho compete successfully for mating opportunities (Wood, 1994). In the absence of\ncontraceptive techniques, there appears to be adaptive value for indirect aggression in\nfemales during adolescence. In a population that uses contraception like the one we\nstudied, indirect aggression and the resultant social manipulation of peers may help to train\nadolescent girls to compete successfully for high quality long-term mates. Future work will\nneed to differentiate between competition for long-term and short-term mating\nopportunities and how these strategies relate to indirect aggression. We will also need to\ndifferentiate between high and low quality mates.\nThe adaptive advantage of indirect aggression may work through proximate\nmechanisms such as increased social dominance, attacks on self-esteem, and resource\ncontrol which ultimately influence reproductive opportunities and outcomes in both males\nand females (Hawley, 2007). Indirect intrasexual competition through social manipulation\nby excluding, teasing, demeaning and isolating appears to activate phylogenetically ancient\npain mechanisms in the brain (Eisenberger and Lieberman, 2004). If the pain of social\nexclusion is neurologically linked to the sensation of physical pain, one can easily see why\nindirect aggression is such a powerful and ubiquitous technique to manipulate the social\nenvironment (Masten, Eisenberger, Borofsky, Pfeifer, McNealy, Mazziotta, Dapretto,\nWe found that teasing and excluding were consistently among the top three loading\nscores on both aggression perpetrated and victimization experienced in male and female\nparticipants. Victims of adolescent aggression have been found to suffer anxiety,\ndepression, psychosocial dysfunction and psychosomatic illness (Rigby, 2002), the effects\nof which may ultimately lead to lifelong reproductive disadvantage (Brown and Taylor,\naggressive adolescents are often popular, sought after by peers, and rank high in social\nstatus (Hawley, 2007). Interestingly, these adolescents need not be well-liked to achieve\nthese important social gains (Cillessen and Mayeux, 2007).\nUnlike physical aggression, indirect aggression appears to increase from early to\nlate adolescence as social intelligence increases and overt strategies are replaced by covert\nVaillancourt, Brendgen, Boivin, Tremblay, 2003). Our results indicate that although\nindirect aggression may increase into late adolescence, middle school demeaning, teasing\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nand excluding has a particularly negative impact on victims as evidenced by the\nrelationship between age at first sexual intercourse and victimization. On the other hand,\nexcluding, isolating, and teasing others during middle school is associated with earlier\nonset of sexual intercourse. Although girls may improve their competitive techniques as\nthey grow older, the earlier that these skills are in place the more potential reproductive\nbenefits they may reap. Therefore, the timing of aggression is of critical importance if it is\nto have an influence on age at first sexual intercourse. In light of research that has linked\nearly sexual experiences with negative health outcomes such as sexually transmitted\ndiseases and teen pregnancy, this work suggests that indirect aggression early in\nadolescence, if not a trigger, is a clue to early involvement in sexual activity in\nheterosexuals (Coker, Richter, Valois, McKeown, Garrison, Vincent, 1994).\nAlthough the results of this work are in general agreement with those of Gallup et\nal. (2009) for males, we were not able to replicate their results for female victimization.\nGallup et al. (2009) showed that the lifetime number of sex partners and rate of partners per\nyear reported by females correlated positively with a middle school victimization index,\nhowever, their study did not include measures of active peer aggression. The correlation\nmatrix in Table 3 indicates that aggressive behavior is significantly correlated with the\nmeasures of victimization collected. That is, females in the current sample often reported\nboth victimization and aggression towards peers. In fact, Leenaar's et al. (2008)\ndemonstrated that aggression and indirect victimization are significantly correlated (r = .28,\np < .001) although this correlation was calculated with combined male and female results\n(see their Table 1). The PCA allowed us to analyze both victimization and aggression\nalong a continuum which resulted in a strong negative correlation between PC2 and age at\nfirst sexual intercourse. These results support previous work showing that indirect\naggression perpetrated and victimization experienced are not mutually exclusive and should\nThese results prompt the following questions about the relationship between (1)\nattractiveness and indirect victimization and (2) promiscuity and victimization. (1) Are\nattractive females who report high levels of indirect victimization also perpetrators of high\nlevels of indirect aggression? (2) Are promiscuous victims with earlier than average ages\nat first sexual intercourse also promiscuous aggressors with early ages at first sex? We\ncannot answer these questions directly with the current dataset, however our results reveal\nthe importance of dealing with the bully/victim phenomenon (Andreou, 2000; Juvonen,\nGraham, and Shuster, 2003; Olweus, 1993) as well as understanding the level at which any\nparticular individual participates in the social milieu. As an example of this issue, we note\nthat the correlation between age at first sexual intercourse and PC2 for the 16 females who\nscored below 0 on PC1 (i.e. active participation in victimization or aggression) is r = -.559,\np = .024 in comparison to r = -.395 including the less active participants. It is therefore\npossible that attractive victims are also attractive aggressors (Leenaar's et al., 2008) and\npromiscuous victims are also promiscuous aggressors (Gallup et al., 2009).\nConclusion\nEvolutionary theory is a particularly fruitful meta-theoretical framework from\nwhich to generate testable explanations for aggressive behavior in adolescence (Hawley,\n2007; Pellegrini, 2007). Competition for limited environmental resources, including mates,\nIndirect Aggression and Reproductive Behavior\nprovides a powerful explanation for what are seemingly antisocial and \"maladaptive,\"\nalthough ubiquitous, behaviors among adolescents (Pellegrini, 2007, Sutton et al., 1999).\nThis research demonstrates that indirect aggression towards peers by females may have\nlong lasting positive reproductive benefits in adulthood. Future work will need to include\nmeasures of both victimization and aggression as well as measures of long-term and short-\nterm mating strategies to better understand indirect aggression as a tool for intrasexual\ncompetition.\nThis work demonstrates that adolescents who are actively involved in aggressive\ninteractions with peers are most likely to be involved in sexual behaviors earlier than those\nwho avoid these negative interactions.\n"
