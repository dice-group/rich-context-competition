Many women of reproductive age in the United States are still at risk of primary CMV infection\nduring pregnancy. There is an urgent need for vaccine development and other interventions to prevent and treat\ncongenital CMV. The substantial disparities in CMV risk among seronegative women suggest that prevention\nstrategies should include an emphasis on reaching racial or ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic\nstatus.\nCytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the Herpesvir-\nidae family, is endemic throughout the world [1]. Most\nCMV infections are mild or asymptomatic; however,\nCMV can cause serious disease in immunocompro-\nmised individuals and fetuses.

Congenital CMV in-\nfection is the result of intrauterine transmission of\nCMV infection from mother to fetus. A fetus is at high-\nest risk of CMV infection when a mother has a primary\n(ie, first) infection during pregnancy [7, 8]. Compared\nwith a maternal nonprimary infection (ie, reinfection\nor reactivation), a maternal primary infection is more\nlikely to transmit CMV from mother to fetus (1% vs\n32%) and is also more likely to result in severe, long-\nterm sequelae in children born with congenital CMV\ninfection [6, 8, 9]. Women who are CMV seropositive before\npregnancy are 69% less likely to give birth to a CMV-infected\nThe best way to assess the prevalence of CMV infection is\nthrough seroprevalence studies of CMV-specific immunoglob-\nulin (Ig) G antibody.

National trends in CMV infection have not been examined\npreviously and can provide insight into the rate of change in\nCMV seroprevalence during the past decade as a function of\nsocioeconomic and demographic factors.\nMETHODS\nSurvey sample and design. NHANES is a series of cross-\nsectional surveys conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention (CDC) [14]. Data are collected through household in-\nterviews, physical examinations, and blood sampling [14]. To\nselect a nationally representative sample, NHANES uses a com-\nplex multistage probability cluster sample design, discussed in\ngreater detail elsewhere [15]. This study was approved by the\ninstitutional review board of the CDC, and participants pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nNHANES has been administered as a continuous annual sur-\noversampled certain population groups to increase the reliabil-\nity and precision of estimates for each of the groups [14, 16].\nIndividuals included in this study were those aged 6\u00ad49 years\nwho were interviewed and examined, consented to be a part of\nadditional testing, had serum samples available for testing, and\nhad a nonequivocal CMV test result. The final study sample\nfairly uniform across variable categories except for the 6- to 11-\nyear-old age group, in which greater percentages of persons were\nwithout available serum specimens. To address the impact of\nmissing CMV data on the generalizability of the study results,\nwe created adjusted weights by multiplying the original NCHS\nweights by the weighted proportion of available serum samples\nfor that participant's sex, age, and race/ethnicity [11]. Seroprev-\nalence analyses using the adjusted weights produced only slightly\ndifferent point estimates that were within 95% confidence in-\ntervals (CIs) of estimates computed with the original NCHS\nweights; therefore, NCHS weights were used for all subsequent\nanalyses.\nSerologic testing. Laboratory methods for detecting CMV\nsame procedures used previously for testing NHANES III sam-\nples [11]. To maximize testing sensitivity, specificity,andthrough-\nput, serum samples were screened for CMV-specific IgG antibody\nwith the SeraQuest enzyme immunoassay (Quest International)\nand the Triturus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay robot\n(Grifols USA). Then serum samples with reactivities within a\nnarrow range of the SeraQuest assay cutoff were tested using\nthe VIDAS test (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux Vitek). Discrepant results between\nthe SeraQuest and VIDAS tests were resolved with an immu-\nnofluorescence assay (Bion Enterprises). All testing was con-\nducted by laboratory personnel at the CDC.\nMeasures. Variables of interest included sex, age (6\u00ad11, 12\u00ad\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American), birthplace\n(born in the 50 states, born in Mexico, born elsewhere), house-\nhold income level (ratio of household income to the family's\nered by health insurance), household education level (less than\nhigh school, high school diploma including Graduate Educa-\ntional Development diploma, or more than high school), and\nhousehold crowding index (low [!0.5 person per room], average\n[0.5\u00ad1 person per room], or high [11 person per room]).

The circles representing the female and male prevalences are\ndistinguished by the female (&) and male (() icons. To better distinguish between females and males, the circles representing the prevalences in\nthe 6\u00ad11-year-old age groups are plotted slightly above and below their true values; true prevalences are shown in the text next to the circles.\nBecause of interactions, logistic models were created for each\nage, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroup, as well as for combined\nsubgroups for sex and race/ethnicity (eg, non-Hispanic white\nfemales) and sex and age (eg, 6- to 11-year-old girls). To aid\nthe interpretation of odds ratios (ORs), predictive margins were\ncomputed using the PREDMARG statement in SUDAAN. Pre-\ndictive margins are akin to adjusted seroprevalences; the pre-\ndictive margin for a group represents the average predicted\nresponse if all individuals in the sample had been in that group,\nwhile controlling for all other covariates [19, 20]. The 95% CIs\nof predictive margins were based on the actual degrees of free-\ndom for each level of each variable.\nexcept that a variable representing survey year (1 for NHANES\nmodel.

Because of numerous inter-\nactions with age, logistic models were performed for each age\ngroup. Additional stratifications were performed because of a\nsignificant 3-way interaction among age, race/ethnicity, and sex.\nRESULTS\nlence of CMV infection for individuals 6\u00ad49 years old was\n50.4% (Table 1).

Household crowding was significantly associated with\nCMV seropositivity only for Mexican American females (69.4%\nfor the low crowding group, 78.6% for the average crowding\ngroup, and 83.6% for the high crowding group) and for 1 of\nthe group comparisons for non-Hispanic white females (48.3%\nfor the average crowding group and 42.1% for the low crowding\ngroup). Nevertheless, for all sex and racial or ethnic groups,\nthe ORs were greater than 1 and increased as the level of crowd-\ning increased (Figure 2).

Thus, we can conclude that among\nthe substantial proportion of US women who are CMV sero-\nnegative as they enter their reproductive years, many experience\nseroconversion. For example, of the 45% of non-Hispanic\nblack women who are CMV seronegative during their teen\nyears, nearly all (8 of 9) seroconvert by the time they are in\ntheir 30s. Approximately one-half of CMV-seronegative Mex-\nican American women and one-fourth of CMV-seronegative\nnon-Hispanic white women also seroconvert during the same\nperiod. This means that many women are at risk of experiencing\na primary CMV infection during pregnancy, which is associated\nwith a higher risk of congenital infection [8] and permanent\ndamage to the child [21].\nSuch risk highlights the urgent need for interventions, such\nas a vaccine, which can reduce the likelihood of adverse out-\ncomes, such as maternal infection, congenital infection, or\nchildhood disability. Although no licensed vaccines are cur-\nrently available, a number are in various stages of develop-\nment, including a gB subunit vaccine that showed efficacy in\na recent phase 2 trial [22]. Several target populations have been\nproposed for future vaccines, including women of reproductive\nshows that all of these groups contain large proportions of\nCMV-seronegative individuals who could be protected from\nCMV infection by vaccination.\nSex, race or ethnicity, country of origin, and factors asso-\nciated with low socioeconomic status, such as crowding and\nlow household income, were all independently associated with\nand substantially affected CMV seropositivity. These multiple\nassociations are not surprising, given the multiple ways that\nCMV can be transmitted. The main transmission routes for\nCMV infection are breast-feeding [5, 25], close contact with\nyoung children [26\u00ad31], and intimate contact with adults (ie,\nkissing or sexual intercourse) [27, 32, 33]. The chance of be-\ncoming infected depends primarily on 2 factors: the frequency\nof these contacts and the likelihood that any given contact will\nbe with a person who is shedding CMV in their bodily fluids.\nThese factors differ for each of the main transmission routes\nand change during a lifetime, making it difficult to precisely\nexplain what drives CMV seroprevalence results and what ac-\ncounts for racial or ethnic differences. For instance, possible\nexplanations include breast-feeding rates, household demo-\ngraphic factors and child care arrangements, and sexual be-\nhaviors and networks, all of which differ substantially by race\nor ethnicity [34\u00ad39]. However, there is no clear correlation be-\ntween these racial/ethnic variations in exposure to prominent\nCMV transmission modes and the likelihood of being CMV\nseropositive. Thus, although this study is useful for identifying\nat-risk populations, it is less able to assess the relative impor-\ntance of different modes of CMV transmission.\nThe major strengths of this study are that it was nationally\nrepresentative, reported a current estimate of CMV seroprev-\nalence in the United States, and assessed time trends in the US\npopulation as a whole. The major limitation was its cross-\nwere cross-sectional samples), which does not allow for the\ndefinitive detection of a birth cohort effect. However, com-\nthat with the exception of some minor changes in CMV se-\nroprevalences in the oldest age group, CMV seroprevalences\nwere relatively constant between individuals of the same age\nwho were born 10 years apart, suggesting that any birth cohort\neffect was minimal and that incidence has not changed sub-\nstantially in the recent past. Also, a cross-sectional design does\nnot reveal when seropositive individuals became infected with\nCMV. Furthermore, the time-dependent variables, such as\ncrowding or household income level, were measured at only\none point in time (ie, the time of the NHANES survey). Thus,\nit was impossible to determine whether the exposures of inter-\nest occurred at a time that was relevant to the CMV infection.\nIn summary, many women of reproductive age in the United\nStates are still at risk of primary CMV infection during preg-\nnancy. As a result, there is an urgent need for vaccine devel-\nopment and other clinical and public health interventions that\ncan benefit children and their families. The substantial dispar-\nities in CMV risk among seronegative women suggest that pre-\nvention strategies should include an emphasis on reaching racial\nor ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status.\n"
