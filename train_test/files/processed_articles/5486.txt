Klokov 2 Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics,\nPushchino, Russia\n2 The percentage of cells with chromosome aberrations or micronuclei induced by low doses of acute\n(dose rate of 47 cGy/min) or chronic (dose rate of 0.01 cGy/min) gamma-irradiation was studied\nin vitro in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human lymphocytes, and Vicia faba seeds and seedlings.\nThe sensitivity of the indicated biological entities to low doses was greater than expected based on\nlinear extrapolation from higher doses. The dose-response curves for cytogenetic damage that were\nobtained were nonlinear when evaluated over the full range of the doses used. At very low doses,\nthe dose-response curves appeared linear, followed by a plateau region at intermediate doses. At high\ndoses the dose response curves again appeared linear with a slope different from that for the low-dose\nregion. There was no statistically significant difference between the yields of cells with micronuclei\ninduced by low doses of acute versus chronic irradiation. Similar data were obtained both for human\nlymphocyte culture and for roots and seeds of Vicia faba. Our experiments revealed that the dose\nrange over which the plateau occurs depends on the type of cells irradiated. We have also shown that\nthe modifying effects of the repair inhibitor caffeine and the radioprotector mercaptoethylenamine\n(MEA) are absent at low doses of gamma irradiation and that caffeine increased the number of cells\nwith cytogenetic damage when evaluated over the plateau region. In the presence of MEA, the upper\nend of the plateau region was extended from just above 1 Gy to about 2 Gy. We therefore provide\ndirect evidence that a plateau exists in the dose-response curve for the indicated radiation-induced\nstochastic effects. Furthermore, our results suggest that, for low linear energy transfer radiation, the\ninduction of DNA repair occurs only after a threshold level of cytogenetic damage and that the higher\nyield of cytogenetic damage per unit dose at low radiation doses is attributable to an insignificant\ncontribution or the absence of DNA repair processes.\nKeywords. nonlinear dose response, cytogenetic damage, ionizing radiation, low doses\nINTRODUCTION\nThe linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis is the basis for radiation pro-\ntection standards at low doses. However, questions about the validity of the\nLNT model remain. Validation of the LNT model is the most important is-\nsue related to radiation risk assessment. Studies of cytogenetic effects can\nprovide key information related to the validity of the LNT model. Cyto-\ngenetic effects of ionizing radiation have been studied in vitro in human\nAddress correspondence to Svetlana I.

With human lymphocyte cultures, a linear dose\u00adresponse re-\nlationship was found (Fenech and Morley, 1985), whereas in other studies\na departure from a linear relationship was reported (Mitchell and Norman,\n1987). In mice, a deviation from the linear dose-response curve was revealed\nfor in vivo exposure. Jagetia and Ganapathi (1994) used the micronucleus\nassay in mice and showed that the dose-response curve had a linear-quadratic\nform. However, a linear dose-response curve was also obtained by others us-\nyears ago it was shown by Russel (1965) that the mutation yield per unit\ndose was higher at low doses of radiation than at high doses. Similar results\nwere obtained by studying radiation-induced cytogenetic damage (Luchnik\nJoiner et al., 1996). Joiner et al. (2001) showed that most cell lines have hyper-\nradiosensitivity to very low radiation doses, which is not predicted by back-\nextrapolation of the cell survival curve from higher doses. Such nonlinear\ndata have led to the recent view that biological effects of ionizing radia-\ntion should not be extrapolated from high to low doses based on the LNT\nmodel.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the shape of the dose-\nresponse relationship for specific cytogenetic effects after low doses of low-\nlinear-energy-transfer (LET) ionizing radiation using mammalian and plant\ncells.\nIn our previous studies, we initiated investigations of biological responses\nto ionizing radiation exposure using the occurrence of chromosomal rear-\nrangements as the endpoint scored (Zaichkina and Ganassi, 1984; Zaichkina\nused different radiation dose ranges for the different bioassays associated\nwith our studies of radiation-induced stochastic effects.\nIn our present study, Chinese hamster fibroblasts (clone 431) were culti-\nvated at 37C, in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2. Cell culture was\ngrown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% calf serum and\nantibiotics. The cells were irradiated with acute doses of 0.05\u00ad2 Gy of 60Co\nLow Doses of Gamma Radiation in Mammalian and Plant Cells 215\ngamma-rays at a dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h. The chronic gamma-irradiation was\ncarried out for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days at room temperature at a dose rate\nrespectively. The technique for preparation of samples for the micronucleus\ntest has been previously described (Zaichkina and Ganassi, 1984).\nWhen the cells were fixed immediately after chronic irradiation, no dam-\nage was observed. To detect cytogenetic damage, the irradiated and control\ncells kept at room temperature were stored for 24 h at 37C before fixation.\nSeveral experiments were performed for each radiation dose. About 10,000\ncells were analyzed for each radiation dose point.\nWhole human blood from ten essentially healthy males was irradiated\nwith acute doses of 0.1\u00ad0.5 Gy at a dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h. Other blood\nsamples were also chronically irradiated at a dose rate of 0.0061 Gy/h at a 37C\n0.27 Gy, respectively. Whole blood (0.2 ml) was cultivated by the micromethod\nmetaphase cells scored from each blood sample. All structural chromosome-\ntype and chromatid-type changes were recorded. Preliminary experiments\nshowed that the conditions of blood-sample irradiation affected neither the\nbackground level of chromosomal damage nor radiosensitivity (Zaichkina\nAir-dried seeds of Vicia faba were soaked and germinated at 21C during\n36\u00ad48 h until the roots reached 1\u00ad1.5 cm in length. The roots of Vicia faba\nwere irradiated with doses of 0.1\u00ad2.5 Gy of acute gamma irradiation at a\nirradiation and stained by the Fulgen method; 50\u00ad100 plants were used for\neach variant, and 1000 cells from each plant were analyzed.\nAir-dried seeds of Vicia faba were also irradiated with doses of 2\u00ad40 Gy at a\ndose rate of 1.4 Gy/min, soaked, germinated, and processed for cytogenetic\nanalysis as described earlier.\nAll cytological slides were coded blind and analyzed by the investigators\nindependently. Experiments were repeated at least three times. In the figures,\nresults are presented as means +/- standard error.\nThe dose dependence of the yield of cytogenetic damage in Chinese\nhamster cells after acute and chronic gamma-irradiation is presented in\nFigure 1. The dose\u00adresponse curve used is discontinuous. At very low doses,\nthe dependence of cytogenetic damage on dose was fitted by a linear re-\ngression with a zero intercept. In the dose range of about 0.5\u00ad1 Gy, there\nis a plateau, and above this range the curve again appears linear but with a\ndifferent slope. There was no statistically significant difference between the\nFIGURE 1 Dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in Chinese hamster fibroblasts by acute\n(28.2 Gy/h) and chronic (0.0061 Gy/h) gamma-irradiation. Results (means \u00b1 standard errors) of six\nexperiments with acute and four experiments with chronic exposure are shown.\nresults for the low doses of chronic and acute irradiation for the investigated\ndose range.\nSimilar results were obtained for human lymphocyte culture. The dose\ndependence of the yield of chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes\ninduced by acute and chronic gamma-irradiation is presented in Figure 2.\nIt can be seen that the obtained high- and low dose rate data for chromo-\nsome aberrations were adequately described by single, discontinuous dose-\nresponse relationships with an initial linear increase followed by a plateau.\nThus, as was the case with Chinese hamster fibroblasts, for the low-dose re-\ngion, no influence of dose rate was found.\nThe dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in root cells of Vicia\nfaba by gamma-ray exposure can also be described using a similar discon-\ntinuous function, but the plateau spans a different dose range, 0.5\u00ad1 Gy\n(Figure 3), than in Figure 1. Using the radioresistant model of Vicia faba dry\nseeds, we found that the dose-response curve for micronuclei induction is\nsimilar to the dose-response curves in Figure 3, except that the plateau was\nobserved in the dose range of about 8\u00ad32 Gy (data not shown). Thus, our ex-\nperiments revealed that the dose range over which the plateau occurs differs\nfor the different biological systems. For radiosensitive systems, the plateau\noccurs at lower doses than for radioresistant systems.\nLow Doses of Gamma Radiation in Mammalian and Plant Cells 217\nFIGURE 2 Dose-response curve for chromosomal aberration induction in human lymphocytes.

The\nexperiment was repeated at least three times.\nFIGURE 3 Dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in root cells of Vicia faba by acute (28.2 Gy/h)\ngamma-irradiation. Results (means \u00b1 standard errors) are based on at least three experiments.\nOur data demonstrate that the dose-response curves for micronuclei in-\nduction in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human lymphocytes, and root cells\nand dry seeds of Vicia faba exposed to acute and chronic gamma-radiation\ncan all be described by a discontinuous function comprising three parts:\n(1) a low-dose linear segment (linear segment 1); (2) a plateau at interme-\ndiate doses; and (3) a high-dose linear segment (linear segment 2).\nWe hypothesized that the indicated complex shape of the dose-response\ncurves relates to the status of DNA repair processes. Previously we have shown\nthat caffeine, an inhibitor of DNA repair, increases the number of cells with\nsumption that low doses of gamma-radiation do not induce repair processes,\nwe studied the influence of the DNA repair inhibitor caffeine on the dose de-\npendence of the induction of chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster\nfibroblast cultures. Figure 4 shows the dose-response curves for micronuclei\ninduction in fibroblasts irradiated with low doses of gamma-radiation in the\npresence of caffeine and without caffeine. Caffeine was added to the culture\nmedium (final concentration 0.08 M, pH 6.5\u00ad6.8) prior to irradiation. The\ncells were kept in the medium with caffeine after irradiation up to fixation.\nFIGURE 4 Dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in Chinese hamster fibroblasts by acute\n(28.2 Gy/h) gamma-irradiation with and without caffeine treatment. Caffeine was added to culture\nmedium prior to irradiation at a final concentration of 0.08 M, pH 6.5\u00ad6.8. Results (means \u00b1 standard\nerrors) of six experiments without caffeine and three experiments with caffeine treatment are shown.\nLow Doses of Gamma Radiation in Mammalian and Plant Cells 219\nThere was no modifying effect of caffeine for linear segment 1; however,\nfor the plateau region and for linear segment 2, caffeine caused significant\nchanges in the dose-response curve. More specifically, caffeine treatment led\nto the disappearance of the plateau (effectively extending linear segment 1).\nAnother approach for validating our hypothesis was to investigate the\naction of low doses of secondary radiation from 70 GeV protons and neu-\ntrons (90%) and of chronic monoenergetic neutrons generated by the\nSerpukhov charged particle accelerator on cytogenetic damage in mam-\nmalian cells. Using inhibitors of DNA repair we have shown that high doses\nof gamma-radiation induced repair, in contrast to neutrons which inhibit\nrepair of cytogenetic damage (Zaichkina et al., 1995). It was found that, in\ncontrast to the gamma-irradiation, the dose-response curves after exposure\nto high-LET neutrons for all the cytogenetic endpoints were linear; that is,\nthe plateau was absent (Rozanova et al., 2000). These results suggest that\nthe induction by gamma-rays of DNA repair processes occurs in the dose\nrange corresponding to the plateau. Thus, it can be assumed that the in-\nduction of repair by low-LET radiation occurs only after a threshold level\nof cytogenetic damage and that the increased yield of cytogenetic damage\nper unit dose at low radiation doses is attributable to an insignificant con-\ntribution or the absence of DNA repair. Recently, Rothkamm and Lobrich\n(2003) have shown a lack of DNA double-strand-break repair in primary hu-\nman fibroblasts exposed to very low doses (approximately 1 mGy) of ionizing\nradiation.\nFigure 5 shows the dose-response curves for micronuclei induction in the\nculture of Chinese hamster fibroblasts irradiated in the presence and with-\nout b-mercaptoethylenamine (MEA), a well-known radioprotector. MEA was\nadded (final concentration 0.1 mM) to the culture medium 15 min before\nirradiation and the cells were kept in the medium with MEA for 2 h after\nirradiation. As with caffeine, no modifying effect of MEA in linear segment\n1 was observed but the plateau region was extended from just above 1 Gy to\nabout 2 Gy. This is direct evidence that a plateau exists and that our interpre-\ntation of the experimental results are plausible.\nRecently in our study involving irradiated mice, we showed that the in vivo\ndose-response curve for micronuclei induction in bone marrow cells is also\nnonlinear and also consists of the three indicated segments (linear segment\nThe results we have presented indicate that dose-response curves both in\nmammalian and plant cells are nonlinear and reflect hypersensitivity of cells\nto low radiation doses that is not predicted by back-extrapolation of cytoge-\nnetic response from higher doses. Although further studies are required to\nreveal the molecular mechanisms associated with the observed dose-response\nrelationships, our results suggest that the hypersensitivity may be attributed\nto a lack of induced DNA repair at very low radiation doses. Altogether, our\nFIGURE 5 Dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in Chinese hamster fibroblasts by acute\n(28.2 Gy/h) gamma-irradiation with and without MEA treatment.
