Carib-\nbean immigrants have higher levels of income18,19 and\nlower rates of adult20,21 and infant22 mortality than native-\nborn blacks, which might lead one to expect lower rates\nof MDD. However, 2 studies23,24 of Caribbean blacks\nfound that they had higher levels of depressive symp-\ntoms than black Americans, whereas a recent study25\nfound that Caribbean-born poor black women had lower\nrates of probable depression than US-born poor black\nwomen. Results of studies of Caribbean immigrants in\nthe United Kingdom have also been inconclusive. In con-\ntrast to a consistent finding of elevated risk of schizo-\nphrenia,26-28 studies have found comparable, higher, and\nlower risk of depression or depressive symptoms for Ca-\nribbean blacks29-33 compared with the rest of the British\npopulation.\nOne of the major limitations of previous research on\nAfrican American mental health has been the small sample\nsizes that have precluded detailed analyses of how the\nrisk of MDD varies for ethnic subgroups of the black popu-\nlation. This article presents results from the recently com-\npleted National Study of American Life (NSAL), the larg-\nest study of mental health in the black population ever\nconducted in the United States.34 The purpose of this study\nis to systematically explore the prevalence and persis-\ntence levels, sociodemographic correlates, impairment,\nand treatment of MDD in African Americans, Caribbean\nblacks, and non-Hispanic whites.\nTable 1.

The term African American is used to de-\nscribe persons who self-identified as black but did not identify\nancestral ties to the Caribbean. Fifty respondents in the Afri-\ncan American sample were born in Africa. Caribbean blacks are\npersons who self-identified as black and indicated that they were\nof West Indian or Caribbean descent, that they were from a coun-\ntry included on a list of Caribbean countries presented by the\ninterviewers, or that their parents or grandparents were born\nin a Caribbean country. The Caribbean black sample was se-\nlected from the core sampling areas of the NSAL (n=265) and\nfrom additional metropolitan segments (n=1356) that were\nsampled based on the concentration of blacks of Caribbean de-\nscent (10%). The non-Hispanic white sample was a stratified,\ndisproportionate sample of non-Hispanic white adults resid-\ning in households located in census tracts and blocks that have\na 10% or greater African American population. These whites\nrepresent 14% of the white population in the United States. The\nsample design and analysis weights for this sample were de-\nsigned to be optimal for comparative analyses in which resi-\ndential, environmental, and socioeconomic characteristics are\ncontrolled in the black-white statistical contrasts. For all 3 race/\nethnic samples, the NSAL weights were designed to correct for\ndisproportionate sampling, nonresponse, and population rep-\nresentation across various sociodemographic characteristics.\nTable 1 provides the weighted sociodemographic character-\nistics of the sample.\nMost interviews (86%) were completed face to face using a\ncomputer-assisted instrument and lasted an average of 2 hours\nand 20 minutes. The remaining interviews were either par-\ntially or entirely conducted by telephone. All the interviews were\nperformed in English, but the Caribbean sample included per-\nsons from English-, French-, Spanish-, and Dutch-speaking Ca-\nribbean countries. Data collection was completed between Feb-\nbean blacks, and 69.7% for non-Hispanic whites. Recruitment\nand consent procedures were approved by the human sub-\njects committee of the University of Michigan.\nA sample of 644 NSAL respondents completed a clinical re-\nappraisal interview to evaluate 12-month diagnoses. The sample\nwas selected to ensure representation of respondents across each\nof the racial/ethnic categories who had and had not met the di-\nagnostic criteria for specific disorders. Whites, Caribbean blacks,\nand Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) cases\nwere oversampled. The data are weighted to adjust for over-\nsampling so that the CIDI test characteristics estimates (sensi-\ntivity, specificity, and total classification accuracy) are unbiased.\nMEASURES\nThe World Mental Health CIDI, a fully structured diagnostic\ninterview, was used to evaluate a wide range of DSM-IV men-\ntal disorders. The psychiatric disorders assessed in the NSAL,\nwhich included MDD, are slightly modified versions of those\ndeveloped for the World Mental Health project initiated in 200037\nand used in the NCS-R.38 The algorithm for MDD is the same\nas that for major depressive episode (MDE): criteria C, the pres-\nence or absence of a manic episode, is not considered. The Struc-\ntured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID),39 a diagnostic in-\nterview that requires administration by a clinician, was used\nin the reappraisal study to generate the diagnosis of MDE. A\ncomparison of the CIDI and the SCID for MDE for respon-\ndents in the clinical reappraisal sample indicates fair concor-\ndance for African Americans (=0.43; 95% confidence inter-\nval [CI], 0.26 to 0.59) but much lower concordance for whites\n12-month prevalence of MDE from the CIDI is markedly higher\nthan that from the SCID.\nMultipleindicatorsofimpairmentwereused.Respondentswho\nmet the 12-month criteria for MDD were administered the Shee-\nhan Disability Scale40 and were asked to rate how much their de-\npressioninterferedwithfunctioninginhomemanagement,work,\nrelationships with others, and social life. The scale was divided\ninto 5 categories of severity: none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-\n6), severe (7-9), and very severe (10). Days out of role was as-\nsessed by a single item about the number of days in the past 365\ndays, when respondents with 12-month MDD were totally un-\nable to carry out their daily activities because of their depression.\nThe World Health Organization's Disability Assessment\nSchedule II (WHO-DAS-II) was an additional measure of im-\nTable 2.

The WHO-DAS-II is based on the In-\nternational Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health\nand is cross-culturally applicable. It assesses functioning and\ndisability at the individual level instead of the disorder-\nspecific level. Thirty-day functional impairment in 7 WHO-\nDAS-II domains was assessed: days out of role, self-care (wash-\ning, dressing, etc), mobility (standing, moving, etc), cognition\n(concentration, memory, etc), social (conversing, maintain-\ning friendships, etc), productivity (quality and quantity of nor-\nmal daily activities at home and at work), and family burden\n(frequency with which respondents' health interfered with the\nlife and activities of their close friends and family). Respon-\ndents who were not asked these questions owing to excellent\nhealth were given a score of 0. For days out of role, the out-\ncome is the count of the number of days in the past 30 days\npreceding the time of interview that respondents were unable\nto carry out their normal activities. For the other domains, the\nimpairment measure is the number of days (in the past 30 days)\nthat the respondents' symptoms caused difficulty in the given\narea of functioning weighted by the level of difficulty. Very se-\nvere, severe, moderate, mild, and no difficulty were weighted\nLevels of depression-specific symptom severity were as-\nsessed using a subset of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-\ntomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR),42 which measures symp-\ntom severity during the worst 2-week period of the past year.\nSix domains were assessed: sleep problems, depressed mood,\ncognitive functioning (ie, concentration and decision mak-\ning), negative personal outlook, diminished interest, and an-\nergia. Respondent scores were summed across all domains and\nwere mapped onto the framework of the full Inventory of De-\npressive Symptomatology scale43 using conversion algorithms\ndeveloped for the QIDS-SR.44 The final converted score was di-\nvided into 4 levels of depressive symptom severity: mild, mod-\nerate, severe, and very severe.\nAfrican Americans and Caribbean blacks were asked if they\nsaw any of an extensive list of providers for problems with their\nemotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs.\nHealth care treatment providers were categorized into mental\nhealth specialty (psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and\nsocial workers seen in mental health settings, other mental health\nprofessionals, and mental health hotlines) and general medi-\ncal (general practitioners, family physicians, nurses, occupa-\ntional therapists, and other health professionals). Non\u00adhealth\ncare providers were human services providers (religious and\nspiritual advisors and counselors and social workers in non\u00ad\nmental health settings) and complementary and alternative medi-\ncine providers (herbalists, chiropractors, spiritualists, self-\nhelp groups, and Internet support groups). Twelve-month\nservice use was defined as making at least 1 visit to a service\nprovider in the past 12 months.\nIn addition, respondents were asked whether they had taken\nany medications in the past 12 months for problems with emo-\ntions, nerves, mental health, substance use, energy, concentra-\ntion, sleep, or ability to cope with stress. A medicine chest in-\nventory of respondents' medication bottles was conducted by\ninterviewerstomaximizeaccuraterecordingofmedicationnames\nand dosages. Further questions asked about duration and source\n(eg, psychiatrist or general practitioner) of treatment. Respon-\ndents were also considered to have received treatment from the\nhealth care sector if they reported taking antidepressant agents\nfor at least 30 days during the past 12 months, even if they had\nnot visited a health care provider during that time.\nSociodemographic correlates include race (African Ameri-\ncan, Caribbean black, or white), age, sex, employment status,\nyears of education completed, household income (divided ap-\nproximately into quartiles), marital status, country of birth, re-\ngion,45 and urbanicity (major metropolitan areas, suburbs with\nBecause the NSAL used a multistage sample design involving\nclustering and stratification, specialized statistical techniques\nto account for the complexity of the design and its associated\nstandard errors were used. In the NSAL the Caribbean black\nsample is more clustered than the African American sample,\nand the relatively small white sample represents a large popu-\nlation of whites. Thus, the corrected standard errors for these\n2 groups will usually be larger than those for the African Ameri-\ncan sample.\nCross-tabulations are given to show race and ethnic differ-\nences on prevalence of disorders and the severity of mental ill-\nness. The percentages represent weighted proportions based\non the sample's race-adjusted weight measure; the standard er-\nrors reflect the recalculation of variance using the study's com-\nplex design; and the Rao-Scott 2 represents a complex design\u00ad\ncorrected measure of association. Logistic regression analysis\nwas used to examine the demographic correlates of the preva-\nlence of disorders.

All analyses were conducted using a software program\n(SAS 9.12; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) that uses the Taylor\nexpansion approximation technique for calculating the com-\nplex design\u00adbased estimates of variance.47\nRESULTS\nThe lifetime prevalence estimate of CIDI/DSM-IV MDD\nis higher for whites (17.9%) than for African Americans\nlevels of MDD for the 12 months before the interview were\nmore similar for the 3 groups, with prevalence esti-\nmates of 5.9% for African Americans, 7.2% for Carib-\nbean blacks, and 6.9% for whites. Whites (3.1%) have\nslightly higher 30-day prevalence of MDD than African\nAmericans and Caribbean blacks (2.2% each). Regard-\ning the course and persistence of MDD, considering the\nratio of individuals with 12-month MDD in the sample\nof lifetime MDD cases indicates that MDD is a chronic\ndisorder for most blacks. This measure of persistence is\nhigher for African Americans (56.5%) and Caribbean\n12-month prevalence ratios indicate that MDD is inter-\nmittent in its course, with whites having a higher ratio\nhave a higher 30-day to lifetime prevalence ratio than Ca-\nAfricanAmericansandwhites60yearsandolderhavelower\nrates of lifetime MDD than their younger counterparts\n(Table 4). A similar pattern is found for Caribbean blacks,\nbut it is not significant. African American females have al-\nmost twice the rate of MDD as their male peers, but, among\nCaribbean blacks, women have a lifetime rate of MDD that\nis comparable with that of men. Among African Ameri-\ncans, employed persons have lower rates of MDD than the\nunemployed, but this pattern is reversed for Caribbean\nblacks. Education and income are unrelated to MDD risk\nfor all 3 race/ethnic groups. Across the 3 groups, married\npersons tend to report lower rates of MDD than the un-\nmarried, although this pattern is not significant for whites.\nCaribbean immigrants have lower lifetime rates of MDD\nthan persons of Caribbean ancestry born in the United\nStates. There is a tendency, especially for African Ameri-\ncans, toward regional variations in MDD, with residents\nof the South and West having lower prevalence of MDD\nthan residents of the Northeast and Midwest. For African\nAmericans and whites, rural residence is associated with a\nreduced rate of MDD. The elevated prevalence of MDD\nlinked tourbanicityis especiallymarked for AfricanAmeri-\ncans and whites residing in major metropolitan areas.\nSimilar analyses (data not shown) were performed for\n12-month disorders. The patterns were similar to those\nfor lifetime disorders. Two patterns for Caribbean blacks,\nalthough not significant owing to low statistical power,\nare worthy of note. The prevalence of 12-month MDD\nwas 8.5% for Caribbean men and 5.8% for Caribbean\nwomen. Also, the 12-month rate of MDD was 10.9% for\nTable 4.

In addition, 93.3%\nof African Americans, 95.1% of Caribbean blacks, and\n92.5% of whites rated their impairment to be at least mod-\nerate in severity. Mean differences in impairment be-\ntween African Americans and Caribbean blacks were not\nsignificant. Accordingly, the 2 black groups were com-\nbined and the impairment categories were collapsed into\nnone/mild/moderate and severe/very severe because of\nthe small number of cases in each impairment level. Three\nof 4 blacks and almost 2 of 3 whites viewed their impair-\nment as severe or very severe in at least 1 domain\n(Table 5). The level of impairment is greatest in the so-\ncial role domain, and blacks report higher levels of this\nwhites indicated that social impairment is severe or very\nsevere. The lowest level of impairment is in the work do-\ning this impairment as severe or very severe.\nRespondents with 12-month MDD whose depres-\nsion is rated as severe or very severe report more days\nout of role in the past year (totally unable to work or carry\nout their normal activities because of their depression),\nand blacks report more days out of role than whites.\nAmong persons with severe or very severe impairment,\nthe average number of days out of role is 71 for blacks\nLevels of impairment on the 6 dimensions of the WHO-\nDAS-II were also compared for persons with MDD with\nthose with no lifetime MDD. Preliminary analyses of func-\ntional impairment for African Americans compared with\nCaribbean blacks revealed only 1 significant difference,\nwith African Americans reporting higher levels of im-\npairmentinmobility.Accordingly,the2blackgroupswere\ncombined. Results of statistical tests (data not shown)\nalso indicated that the levels of functional impairment\nfor each domain were significantly different across the\n4 MDD recency groups, with respondents with MDD re-\nporting higher levels of impairment on all 6 of the WHO-\nDAS-II domains compared with those with no history of\nMDD. In general, blacks with MDD report higher levels\nof functional impairment than whites (Table 6).\nThe mean score on the QIDS-SR measure of severity was\nsignificantly higher (P.05) for African Americans (15.6)\nthan for Caribbean blacks (13.8) but did not differ for\nribbean blacks, and 96.2% of whites with 12-month CIDI-\ndefined MDD had their depressive symptoms indepen-\ndently classified by the QIDS-SR as moderate, severe, or\nvery severe during their worst month of the year. The\nmild and moderate severity categories were collapsed and\ncontrasted with the severe and very severe categories due\nto the small number of cases. Although the mean sever-\nity scores for all of the correlates of symptom severity tend\nto be higher for African Americans than Caribbean blacks,\nthey are not significantly different, probably owing to low\nstatistical power. Accordingly, the 2 black groups were\ncombined for the analyses in Table 7. Cases rated as mild\nor moderate in severity do not differ from those rated se-\nvere or very severe for the number of weeks depressed\nin the past year, the level of comorbidity of MDD with\nanother disorder, and role impairment (the percentage\nof respondents who were rated as severe or very severe\non at least 1 dimension of the Sheehan Disability Scale).\nCases of MDD rated as mild or moderate, however, had\nfewer days out of role (7.6 days) than those rated as se-\nvere or very severe (78.6) for whites. Two significant ra-\ncial differences were also evident. Among MDD cases rated\non the QIDS-SR as mild or moderate, blacks reported more\ndays out of role and higher comorbidity than whites.\nTable 5.

Only 45.0% of African Americans and\n24.3% of Caribbean blacks received treatment of any type.\nFor both black groups, except for treatment from non\u00ad\nhealth care professionals for African Americans, the re-\nceipt of all treatment types did not significantly increase\nas symptom severity increased. Only 48.5% of African\nAmericans and 21.9% of Caribbean blacks with severe\nor very severe symptoms received any treatment. In the\nNSAL, data on treatment were not collected for whites.\nFor each sector of treatment, African Americans with a\n12-month MDD were more likely to receive treatment\nthan Caribbean blacks, but these differences were sig-\nnificant only for non\u00adhealth care, human services. Among\npersons with 12-month MDD, 16.7% of African Ameri-\ncans but only 2.8% of Caribbean blacks were receiving\ntreatment from the human services sector. Most visits to\nhuman service providers for both groups were to the\nclergy. Similarly, 20.4% of African Americans compared\nwith 3.6% of Caribbean blacks received services from non\u00ad\nhealth care professionals. Among persons with a 12-\nmonth MDD whose symptoms were rated as severe or\nvery severe, African Americans were more likely than Ca-\nribbean blacks to receive most types of treatment. For\nthose with mild or moderate severity, African Ameri-\ncans were more likely to receive services from non\u00ad\nhealth care, human services, and complementary and al-\nternative medicine providers.\nCOMMENT\nThese analyses reveal that the risk of MDD is similar for\nAfrican Americans and Caribbean blacks; however, com-\npared with whites in the NSAL, both black groups have\na lower lifetime prevalence but a higher risk of the per-\nsistence of MDD. These findings come from the largest\npsychiatric epidemiologic study of blacks in the United\nTable 6.

They provide a previously un-\navailable picture of mental health of the US black popu-\nlation. Whites in the NSAL are not representative of whites\nnationally, but the prevalence of MDD for whites is al-\nmost identical to that of whites in the NCS-R.9,48 More-\nover, the elevated rates and lower persistence of MDD\nfor whites in the NSAL compared with blacks is consis-\ntent with the NCS2,8 and the NCS-R9,48 and highlight the\nneed for renewed attention to identifying the factors re-\nsponsible for the lower prevalence of MDD for blacks.\nFuture research should explore the extent to which so-\ncial support systems, including religious participation and\npsychological resources, such as high levels of self-\nesteem, can provide some protection to the black popu-\nlation from exposure to adverse social conditions.49\nThere were marked differences in concordance in the\nclinical reappraisal analyses for African Americans\nAfrican Americans was comparable with that obtained\nin the NCS-R (=0.40).9 We do not understand why the\nCaribbean sample had a much higher MDE prevalence\nusing the CIDI than the SCID. Additional analyses re-\nvealed that the  value for Caribbean immigrants was\nhigher than that of US-born blacks of Caribbean ances-\ntry, suggesting that differences in acculturation is an un-\nlikely explanation. Furthermore, the  value for blacks\nfrom the Spanish- and French-speaking Caribbean was\nslightly higher than the  value for those from the English-\nspeaking Caribbean, suggesting that primary language dif-\nferences did not drive these patterns. It is possible that\nthe differences reflect the context of the interviews. The\nCIDI was administered in an in-person interview in which\nCaribbean respondents were typically matched to Ca-\nribbean interviewers. The SCID was a telephone inter-\nview with no ethnic matching. It is possible that a tele-\nphone interview, without ethnic matching, shortly after\nthe initial CIDI, may have raised suspicions that led to\nunderreporting. Some evidence suggests that ethnic mi-\nnorities are more likely to underreport sensitive infor-\nmation in a telephone interview than in an in-person one.50\nAlternatively, despite many efforts to make the CIDI and\nSCID cross-culturally relevant and extensive use of these\ninstruments internationally,2 1 or both of these instru-\nments may not be appropriately calibrated for Carib-\nbean blacks. There is an ongoing need to identify the op-\ntimal methods for assessing depression across ethnic\ngroups.\nThe present findings also shed light on the burden of\nMDD for blacks. We found that both black populations\nwith MDD were overrepresented among persons with very\nsevere impairment, with African Americans having higher\nlevels than Caribbean blacks on some indicators of im-\npairment. Blacks with severe impairment, irrespective of\nethnicity, reported substantially more days out of role than\nthe national average for persons with MDD.9 These data\nsuggest that when blacks develop MDD, it is likely de-\nbilitating in impact and persistent in its course. It is im-\nportant to find out why blacks who develop this illness\nhave a poorer prognosis than their white counterparts.\nThese findings also emphasize the need for the treat-\nment of blacks with MDD. In the United States, 57% of\nadults with MDD receive treatment,9 but we found that\nmost blacks with MDD, irrespective of ethnicity, do not\nreceive treatment. Only 48% of African Americans and\n22% of Caribbean blacks with severe symptoms re-\nceived treatment. It has not been previously recognized\nthat Caribbean blacks, a group with higher income and\neducation than African Americans, have such marked lev-\nels of underutilization of mental health services. Other\nevidence indicates that blacks who do access mental health\ncare services receive poorer quality care than whites.51\nThese findings underscore the pressing need to under-\nstand the factors underlying racial differences in access\nand quality of mental health care and the urgency of imple-\nmenting interventions to eliminate these disparities.\nThere were sociodemographic factors that predicted\nvariations in MDD that point to potential differences in\nthe social context between Caribbean blacks and Afri-\ncan Americans. First, consistent with previous research\non other immigrant groups,52 Caribbean immigrants had\nlower rates of MDD than US-born individuals of Carib-\nbean ancestry. Future research needs to understand the\ncontribution of selection factors, acculturation pro-\ncesses, cultural values, and social networks to the men-\ntal health of black immigrants.52 Second, although it is\nalmost universally found that women have higher rates\nTable 7.

It is not clear whether\nthis pattern reflects the selective sex composition of the\nimmigrant pool or processes of advantage and disadvan-\ntage linked to mental health risk and sex for Caribbean\nployment and educational opportunities that migration\nto the United States provides for Caribbean women en-\nhance their personal and financial autonomy and pro-\nvide increased power in the family. These new freedoms\nfor women could be stressful for Caribbean men who were\nsocialized in a culture that is more patriarchal than in\nthe United States.57\nThere are several limitations to the analyses reported\nherein. First, the data are cross-sectional, and it is not\npossible to identify causal associations among the fac-\ntors examined. Second, we cannot distinguish the asso-\nciation of factors related to the onset of MDD from those\nrelated to its course. Third, the assessment of depres-\nsive symptoms was based on self-report. We do not know\nthe extent to which cultural factors could affect the will-\ningness of respondents to either admit or recall the pres-\nence of symptoms during their lifetime or whether the\nmore generic problem of impaired memory recall could\naffect subgroups of the sample differentially. Finally, the\nsample of Caribbean blacks includes immigrants who vary\nin time in the United States and US-born persons with\nvarying strength of ties to Caribbean culture. Future re-\nsearch on this sample and, with larger samples of per-\nsons of Caribbean ancestry, needs to examine the ways\nin which the distribution of MDD varies by nativity sta-\ntus, length of stay in the United States, and ancestry and\ngenerational status. Nonetheless, the findings of this study\nhighlight the importance of identifying high-risk sub-\ngroups in racial populations and the continuing need to\ntarget cost-effective interventions to them.\nSubmitted for Publication: November 3, 2005; final re-\nAuthor Affiliations: Departments of Sociology\n(Dr Williams), Epidemiology (Dr Williams), Psychiatry\n(Dr Nesse), and Psychology (Dr Jackson), Institute for\nSocial Research (Drs Williams and Jackson and Mss\nTable 8.
