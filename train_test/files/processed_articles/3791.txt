PVAT-\nderived adiponectin has been shown to have a vasoprotec-\ntive impact through its vasodilatory properties and\nstimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).4,5\nHowever, a contrary role for PVAT as atherogenic is sup-\nported by studies in obese humans and mice, where hyper-\ntrophy of adipocytes result in the migration of monocytes\nvia the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1\n(MCP-1).2,6\u00ad9 Subsequently, the production of proinflam-\nmatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)\nThe relationship of perivascular adipose\ntissue and atherosclerosis in the aorta and\ncarotid arteries, determined by magnetic\nresonance imaging\nMohammad Alkhalil1,2 , Evan Edmond1, Laurienne Edgar1,\nJanet E Digby1, Omar Omar3, Matthew D Robson1\nand Robin P Choudhury1,2\n Keywords\nPerivascular adipose tissue, magnetic resonance imaging, atherosclerosis, carotid arteries, aorta\nDivision of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of\nMedicine, University of Oxford and John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford,\nUK\nAcute Vascular Imaging Centre, Radcliffe Department of Medicine,\nUniversity of Oxford and John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK\n3Centre for Statistics in Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK\nCorresponding author:\nRobin P Choudhury, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Oxford and John Radcliffe\nHospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.\nEmail: robin.choudhury@cardiov.ox.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\nin differentiated monocytes leads to direct inhibition of\ninsulin signalling in adipocytes.2,6\u00ad9\nWhile there is a lack of consensus on whether PVAT has\na protective or pro-atherosclerotic role, there is more evi-\ndence to suggest that PVAT is locally regulated and exerts\nits effect via paracrine adipokine signalling.10,11 The ana-\ntomical proximity of PVAT and vessel wall and the evi-\ndence of their connectivity through microvessels have\nfuelled the arguments of potential cross-talk and possibil-\nity that PVAT may be involved in the initiation and pro-\ngression of atherosclerosis.12 The direct interaction\nbetween PVAT with the outer adventitia has suggested the\nability to convey adipokines to vessel wall via the vasa\nvasorum.13,14 Moreover, the absence of atherosclerosis in\nsegments of `myocardial bridging' where heart muscle\ninsulates a coronary artery from any adipose tissue has\nalso favoured the argument for PVAT role in the develop-\nment of vascular disease.12\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to\ngreat effect for the high-resolution characterisation of\ncarotid arteries and aorta.15\u00ad17 Differential suppression\ntechniques can be used to isolate signals from fat or water,\nwhich separates PVAT (by suppressing water signal) and\nvessel wall (by suppressing fat signal) accurately, thus\novercoming the difficulty of the anatomical proximity.\nAccordingly, we reasoned that systematic evaluation of the\nspatial relationships between arterial wall thickening/ath-\nerosclerosis and adjacent PVAT with MRI may inform the\ncontentious issue of whether PVAT has an atheroprotective\nor atherogenic role.\nThe aims of this study were to use vascular MRI (1) to\nstudy the distribution of PVAT in relation to the carotid\narteries and aorta and (2) to establish whether there is a\nrelationship between the distribution of PVAT and wall\nthickening/atherosclerosis.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nPatients scheduled for invasive coronary angiogram at\nOxford University Hospitals NHS Trust were recruited\nand scanned at the University of Oxford Centre for Clinical\nMagnetic Resonance Research (OCMR). Patients were\nadult (>18years) and were scheduled either (1) electively\nfor assessment of symptoms suggestive of coronary artery\ndisease and/or valvular heart disease or (2) urgent admis-\nsion with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS was\ndefined as chest discomfort associated with electrocardio-\ngram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac biomarkers.\nPatients with known chronic inflammatory conditions,\ninfections, malignancies or contraindications to MRI were\nexcluded. All included patients in this study provided writ-\nten informed consent. The study protocol conformed to the\nethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was\napproved by the National Research Ethics Services\n(NRES) and local R&D committee prior to commence-\nment of the study.\nMRI protocol\nPatients were imaged on a Siemens Sonata 1.5-T scanner\n(Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A black-blood\nturbo spin echo (TSE), fat suppressed sequence was\nacquired to localise carotid bifurcation, which was used as\na landmark to obtain carotid images. T1-weighted TSE\n[repetition time (TR):echo time (TE) 700:12ms] spanned\nthe carotid bifurcation with 13 slices of 3\nmm thickness.\nSlices were centralised on the identified carotid bifurca-\ntion and used to measure vessel wall thickness. Fat satura-\ntion sequence (field of view 150\nms, in-plane spatial resolution 0.39\nwater suppression) was acquired to match the obtained\nT1-weighted slices and suppressing signal from vessel\nwall producing a separated and enhanced fat image.\nSimilarly, the descending aorta was imaged with a black-\nblood TSE, fat suppressed sequence to identify pulmonary\nbifurcation as a landmark, with 11 slices of 5mm thickness\nwere acquired downwards. T1-weighted TSE (TR:TE 750:\nmm thickness of the descending\nthoracic aorta, with matching fat saturated slices, were\nobtained.\nData analysis\nBoth PVAT and vessel wall images were analysed using\nmeasurements along the radii of the vessel passing through\ncords on the vessel circumference. These cords were at\nevenly spaced out angles of 5\u00b0 (starting from 0\u00b0 to 355\u00b0;\ni.e. 72 cords per vessel image). All images were analysed\nby an experienced observer blinded to patient identity and\nbackground (E.E.). Analyses were performed separately\nfor the aorta and for the carotid arteries. This process\nwas executed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media\nCybernetics, Rockville, MD).\nPVAT image segmentation.Segmentation was based on a\nthreshold intensity method, set at 2 standard deviations\ngreater than the mean pixel intensity in the whole image\n(Figure 1). The user-interface requirements were to\nexclude the background and the very bright superficial\nsubcutaneous tissue and to identify the centre of the vessel\nfrom where the measurements of PVAT will be obtained.\nMeasurement.There is a little consensus in the literature\nas to the anatomical classification of PVAT. Lehman et al.18\nused an arbitrary box to identify PVAT when studying\nPVAT of the thoracic aorta. Borders of this box were the\nanterior border of the vertebral body, the left costoverte-\nbral joint and the oesophagus. In another study by the same\ngroup,19 a threshold for PVAT surrounding the abdominal\naorta was set at 5\nmm away from the vessel wall. In this\nstudy, we set up a distance from the outer boundary of the\nvessel wall to standardise our approach from patient to\npatient. The distance used here was derived using 2 stand-\nard deviations of the mean in measurement of PVAT made\nfrom sample images (n=15) and resulting in a threshold at\n20mm in the aorta and 9mm in the carotid. The intention\nof this method was to include the full physiological range\nof normal PVAT distribution, which may have been over-\nlooked with smaller, arbitrary thresholds.\nUsing the Line Profile tool, the thickness measurements\nof both PVAT and vessel wall were made along the 72\ncords around the circumference of the vessel. The centre\nfrom which these measurements were taken was defined\nusing a software-defined best-fit circle of the vessel wall.\nIn the carotid arteries' slices, the zero angle position was\ndefined as the anterior direction, and the angle was\nincreased in a clockwise rotation. The position of the aorta\nrelative to the spinal column varied between patients;\ntherefore, the line drawn between the centre of the verte-\nbral body and the centre of the aorta was used as the zero\nposition. In order to facilitate rapid measurement, macro\nscripts for Image-Pro Plus were developed and used to\nautomate part of the process.\nDefining `normal' and `abnormal' vessel walls\nFor this analysis, individual slices were categorised into\n`abnormal' and `normal' groups to allow those slices with\nplaque formation to be considered separately and to inves-\ntigate the association of atherosclerotic plaque with PVAT.\nWe identified a subsample of patients for both carotid and\naortic wall with no eccentric or focal thickening using a\nmodified American Heart Association (AHA) classifica-\ntion of vascular wall.20 Maximal vessel wall thickening\nacross all angles was measured in normal subjects and a\nthreshold value for segregating `normal' from `abnormal'\nslice was set at 3 standard deviations away from mean of\nmaximal wall thickness. This threshold was used to ensure\nthat only slices with evident atherosclerosis are grouped\ntogether and to avoid any observer bias in defining normal\nversus abnormal slices when applied to the whole cohort.\nStatistical analysis\nData were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro\u00ad\nWilk test. Data were expressed as frequencies and percent-\nages for categorical variables, mean and (\u00b1)standard\ndeviation for continuous variables or as median accompa-\nnied by interquartile range (IQR) for skewed continuous\nvariables, as appropriate. A test for autocorrelation was\nperformed on all available measurements included in the\nanalysis, which were taken at 5\u00b0 angles and showed strong\nautocorrelation. Measurements at angles just 5\u00b0 apart con-\ntain too much similar information to measurements taken\nat neighbouring angles, so inclusion of them all would\ninappropriately inflate the apparent significance of the\nresults. Autocorrelation was overcome by including only\nangles 20\u00b0 apart in the analysis. Wall thickness was\nregressed on PVAT thickness using hierarchical regression\nanalysis, with random components for between-person\nvariance, angle variance and slice variance. In addition,\nangle and slice were fitted as categorical predictor varia-\nbles to take account of any systematic patterns in these\nvariables across individuals. The modelled association\nbetween wall thickness and PVAT thickness is, therefore,\nin person-specific variance over and above the component\nof the pattern by angle and slice that are common across all\npeople. Analyses were then repeated, with normal and\nabnormal slices analysed separately, to find the associa-\ntions in the presence and in the absence of atherosclerosis.\nResults were reported in terms of regression coefficients,\nwith confidence intervals (CIs), which were derived from\nFigure 1.

The variations of adipocyte composition, stage\nof differentiation and morphology with subsequent different\nlocal effect add to the discrepancy in the role of PVAT.10,24\nMoreover, the anatomical regional vascular differences have\nbeen reported to influence the role of PVAT.10,24 Therefore,\nany broad statement on the selective and predefined role of\nPVAT, whether it is pro-atherogenic or vascular protective, is\nlikely to be overly simplistic.\nImaging has added insights into the atherosclerotic role\nof PVAT.18,25 The increase in PVAT measured on computed\ntomography (CT), using a distance-based method of the\nsum of volume of Hounsfield unit-defined adipose tissue\nin a 5-mm increments along the coronary artery, was asso-\nciated with the severity of coronary artery disease and fea-\nstudy, using MRI-driven methodology, the distribution and\nassociation between PVAT and vessel wall thickness\nwere investigated. We used wall thickness to reflect the\nFigure 2. Spatial and circumferential distribution of PVAT and vessel wall thickness of aorta: (a) the individual variation of vessel\nwall thickness of all recruited patients, assigning every patient into different colour and/or different pattern, (b) the individual\ndistribution of PVAT with the `double peaks' phenomenon appears consistent across most patients, (c) the changes in average\nmean aortic wall thickness with standard deviations of all patients across different angles and (d) the average PVAT thickness of all\natherosclerosis burden, where thick segments represented\nmore advanced disease. We demonstrated that PVAT dis-\ntribution is widely irregular in comparison to vessel wall\nthickness irrespective of the degree of wall thickening. We\nalso showed that aortic PVAT followed a characteristic\npattern with two prominent peaks within the posterior\nregion of the aortic wall. A similar pattern was not identi-\nfied in the carotid artery, but PVAT tended to be thicker\non the anterior surface (angle 325\u00b0\u00ad25\u00b0) compared to\nother angles. We detected very weak correlation between\nPVAT and adjacent wall thickness in both aorta and carotid\narteries and irrespective of the plaque burden. The correla-\ntion coefficient across all groups was very close to 0 (rang-\nstrongly determinant inter-relationship. The p-value in the\n`abnormal' aortic slices group did not reach statistical sig-\nnificance and is probably a reflective of smaller sample\nsize compared to other categories. These findings do not\nsupport the hypothesis of the atherosclerotic role of PVAT\nvia paracrine local effect. Nonetheless, it is important to\nhighlight that the current analysis did not investigate the\nfunctional properties of PVAT nor its possible impact on\nvessel wall composition.\nIn vitro experiments using human periaortic adipocytes\nhave shown their ability to stimulate migration of inflamma-\ntory cells. In addition, in apolipoprotein E knock-out mice,\nthere was an increase in infiltrating macrophage within\nPVAT and similarly an increase in PVAT release of proin-\nflammatory cytokines.28,29 Similarly, in humans, mac-\nrophage infiltration and adipokines production were\ndifferent comparing PVAT near stenotic and non-stenotic\ncoronary artery segments.30 Furthermore, imaging studies\nhave demonstrated an association between the burden of\nFigure 3.

We did not\nidentify any relationship between the spatial distribution of\nPVAT and atherosclerosis measured as vessel wall thick-\nness; however, few points need to be highlighted. First, the\nsimultaneous measurements of PVAT and vessel wall thick-\nness may be challenged given the snapshot analysis of a het-\nerogonous population. Second, while there may still be an\ninfluence of PVAT on atherosclerosis, its impact may not be\nsufficient to show anatomical changes on the vascular wall\nas we examined here. Third, the influence of PVAT may be\nsubtle, for example, on plaque composition or inflammatory\ncell infiltrate. Finally, it is arguable that quantification of\nPVAT may not play a significant role but rather the change\nin its adipocytes character, structure and morphology is\nmore biologically important. In a post mortem study of 16\npatients, coronary atherosclerotic burden expressed as\nplaque/media ratio was related to PVAT area and degree of\nmacrophage infiltration within PVAT.26 In addition, PVAT\nwas correlated to the presence of lipid core.26 This assess-\nment was made again based on a measured area of 3-mm\ncircle around the studied coronary vessel.26\nThis study adds to the body of evidence examining the\npossible role of PVAT in atherogenesis. Most reported\nstudies have focused on coronary arteries and to less extent\naorta. Our study provides for the first time a systematic\ndetailed description of PVAT of the carotid arteries in addi-\ntion to the aorta. While others have used CT to study PVAT,\nwe have demonstrated the utility of MRI as an alternative\nmodality. We demonstrated lack of relationship between\nthe angular distribution of PVAT and arterial wall thick-\nness in the aorta and carotid arteries. Such dissociation\ndoes not support the concept that PVAT has a causal role in\npromoting atherosclerosis.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThisworkwassupportedbytheNIHROxfordBiomedicalResearch\nCentre and the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research\nExcellence, Oxford, and by the Tripartite Immunometabolism\nConsortium\u00adNovo Nordisk Foundation; grant number NNF15-\nReferences\n1.
