The increased asthma risk remained for African Americans when models included\ncommunity violence and all other individual-level covariates, but attenuated to borderline\nnonsignificance when further adjusting for collective efficacy.\nCommunity violence is associated with asthma risk when controlling for individual- and\nneighborhood-level confounders. Neither community violence, nor the other individual-level\nfactors, fully accounted for the excess asthma burden among African Americans.

Wright#,1\n KEYWORDS: Asthma, collective efficacy, community violence, multilevel analyses,\nneighbourhood disadvantage, social disorder\nIn the USA, those living in impoverished\nurban neighbourhoods have the highest\nasthma rates and associated morbidity rela-\ntive to their higher socioeconomic status (SES)\nand nonurban counterparts [1]. Such disparities\nare not adequately explained by physical envir-\nonmental factors [2]. The recognised importance\nof the social environment in child health, coupled\nwith knowledge of the mechanisms linking\npsychological stress and asthma [2, 3] indicate\nthat children may be raised in social contexts\npotentially as detrimental to their development\nand health as physical toxins [4].\nChronic community violence has been identified\nas a prevalent and extreme stressor confronting\nmany urban poor communities [5, 6]. In one\ninner-city cohort in Chicago, IL, USA, 42% of\nchildren aged 7\u00ad13 yrs had seen someone shot\nand 37% had seen someone stabbed [6].\nMoreover, community violence contributes signifi-\ncantly to urban childhood morbidity [5]. Witnessing\nor being a victim of community violence adversely\naffects a child's cognitive, emotional and social\nfunctioning [7, 8]. Research links community\nviolence exposure to alterations in the physiological\nstress response, including increased blood pressure\nand heart rate, and disrupted cortisol expression [8,\n9]. Such biobehavioural and physiological sequelae\nmay lead to broader health effects. Accumulating\nevidence suggests that community violence may\ncontribute to the burden of asthma in urban\npopulations [5]. Increased exposure is associated\nwith more symptom days [10], higher hospitalisa-\ntion rates [11], increased asthma prevalence among\nchildren in communities with both elevated crime/\nviolence and other environmental hazards (i.e.\nambient air pollutants) [12], and increased risk of\nWhile evidence suggests that community vio-\nlence may contribute to asthma expression, there\nare methodological limitations.

Secondly, none of the existing studies consider neigh-\nbourhood structural measures. This is problematic because\ncommunity violence clusters in areas characterised by other\ncommunity-level social stressors that also tax individuals\nliving in these neighbourhoods. These include constructs of\nneighbourhood disadvantage, social disorder and low collec-\ntive efficacy [5, 15]. For example, the real or perceived threat of\ncrime, and the broader construct of social disorder, fosters a\ndistrust of others, disrupted collective efficacy and social\nisolation [15], which, in turn have been linked to asthma\noutcomes in low-income families [16]. Moreover, those\nexperiencing greater community violence may also be exposed\nto physical toxins linked to asthma expression (air pollution\nand indoor allergens) [17]. Thirdly, studies to date have been\ncross-sectional or retrospective, preventing demonstration of a\ntemporal relationship between community violence exposure\nand asthma development.\nWe address some of these limitations by examining whether\nhigher level exposure to community violence is associated with\nan increased risk of asthma in a prospective study of urban\nchildren, after controlling for individual-level sociodemo-\ngraphics, behaviour (smoking or breastfeeding), family vio-\nlence and neighbourhood-level measures of disadvantage,\nsocial disorder and collective efficacy.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and analytic sample\nData are from the Project on Human Development in Chicago\nNeighborhoods (PHDCN), a multilevel, multimethod, long-\nitudinal study of contextual factors and individual develop-\nment [18]. Figure 1 illustrates the data collection schema and\ncurrent analytic sample. Briefly, 343 Chicago neighbourhood\nclusters (NCs) were identified using 1990 US Census data. In\n1995, an interview-administered community survey (CS) was\nconducted with a representative sample of adults within each\nof the NCs (n58,782) to derive neighbourhood-level constructs\n(i.e. social disorder and collective efficacy detailed below)\nindependent of the sample from which individual-level data\nwere ascertained.\nFor the longitudinal study, a stratified probability sample of 80\nneighbourhoods was selected from the 343 NCs. Conceived\nusing an accelerated cohort design, English- and Spanish-\nspeaking households were screened for eligible children\nwithin 6 months of seven target cohort ages (0 (in utero to\nhousehold, all eligible children were invited to participate,\nalong with the primary caregiver for those ,18 yrs of age.\nParticipants were enrolled in 1995 and followed in three waves\nIndividual-level variables\nNeighbourhood-level variables\nLongitudinal data collection\nCurrent analytic sample\n_ Caregivers and children\ncohorts with complete\ndata on violence exposure,\nrace/ethnicity, and asthma\noutcome\n_ Stratified based on\nrace/ethnicity and\nSES\nclusters\nLongitudinal cohort study\n_ Stratified probability sample of 80\nneighbourhood clusters\n_ Households enumerated with\nchildren in target cohort age (0, 3,\n_ Sociodemographics\n_ Community violence exposure\n_ Intrafamilial violence in home\n_ Asthma outcome\n_ Maternal behaviours (smoking,\nbreastfeeding)\n_ Child's age\nSocial disorder\nCollective efficacy\nNeighbourhood disadvantage index\n_ % below poverty, unemployed, on\npublic assistance, female-headed\nhouseholds, home ownership\nall 343 neighbourhood clusters\n_ Independent of longitudinal\ncohort study sample\nFIGURE 1.

SES: socioeconomic status.\nc\nHarvard School of Public Health (Boston, MA, USA) approved\nsecondary analyses using the public database.\nCommunity violence exposure\nAt wave 2, primary caregivers completed the My Exposure to\nViolence (ETV) survey, a structured, interviewer-administered\nmeasure ascertaining the child's lifetime exposure to violent\nevents in their neighbourhood [19, 20]. Internal consistency,\ntest\u00adretest reliability and validity have been established,\nincluding the Spanish translation [21]. For endorsed items,\nfollow-up questions inquire about factors known to influence\nthe impact of violence, including familiarity with the perpe-\ntrator or victim, events occurring more than once and whether\nevents occurred outside the home. For the main exposure, we\nconsidered only events witnessed and/or experienced outside\nthe home (i.e. neighbourhood violence) in the child's lifetime\nprior to asthma diagnosis.\nRasch modelling was used to summarise the multi-item\nresponses (table 1) into a continuous ETV composite variable\n[7]. Models were fitted using logistic, nonlinear, mixed models\n(NLMIXED) in SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)\nspecifying a binary distribution and a random effect, defined\nto have mean of 0 and a variance estimated by the model-\nfitting process. Higher scores indicate greater exposure. ETV\nwas examined as a continuous indicator and divided into\ntertiles to test for an exposure\u00adresponse relationship.\nAsthma outcome\nIn wave 3, standardised questions adapted from the American\nThoracic Society Division of Lung Diseases (ATS-DLD-78)\nquestionnaire [22] were administered to the primary caregivers\nof children from the age cohorts who were 0\u00ad9 yrs of age at\nenrolment. The analytic sample included everyone in these age\ngroups who completed the survey (n52,228) (response rate\nmunity violence exposure and five missing information on\nrace/ethnicity, to give a total of n52,071. The primary outcome\nwas defined as having ever been diagnosed with asthma or\nhaving ever taken prescription asthma medicine.\nWe considered alternative definitions in sensitivity analyses.\nBecause having a current diagnosis of wheeze is associated\nwith more objective measures, including airway responsive-\nness [23], we alternatively examined current asthma, which\nwas defined as having both a diagnosis and reporting\nsymptoms or medication use indicative of asthma (i.e.\nwheezing or using prescription medication for wheezing) in\nthe past year. We also considered the potential for uncon-\nfirmed possible asthma, defined as never having been\ndiagnosed with asthma but reporting symptoms (ever wheez-\ning) or prescription medication use for wheezing illnesses. The\nlatter definition was considered to address concerns about\nunderdiagnosis of asthma potentially attributable to racial or\nethnic disparities in access to healthcare [24] or cultural\ndifferences in acceptability of a diagnosis of asthma [25].\nCovariates\nVariables previously related to community violence exposure\nand childhood asthma were examined as summarised in\nIndividual-level confounders\nSociodemographics\nVariables ascertained in wave 1 included maternal education,\nchild's race/ethnicity and sex. Child's age at wave 3 was also\nused. Equivalised income was calculated by dividing house-\nhold income by the square root of the number of household\nMaternal asthma\nMaternal asthma, ascertained at wave 3, was defined as having\never been diagnosed with asthma by a physician asthma [22].\nFamily violence in the home\nMaternal report of the child's exposure to family violence was\nobtained in wave 2 using the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) Form R\nassessing the extent to which she and her partner psychologi-\ncally and physically attacked one another in the past year [29].\nReliability and validity data are available, including the Spanish\ntranslation [30]. Items assessed psychological aggression (e.g.\ninsulting/swearing and threatening violence) and physical\nviolence (e.g. pushing or slapping; kicking, hitting, or beating;\nor using a weapon). Participants rated whether items occurred\nboth victim and perpetrator. Summed scores were included as a\nthree-level categorical indicator representing none (score of 0),\nTABLE 1 Exposure to community violence items\nsummarised using Rasch modelling\nHas the child ever seen or been present when someone was\nshoved/kicked/punched?\nIf so\nDid that happen outside the home?\nDid she/he know the person or people who this happened to?\nWas she/he the person who this happened to?\nDid she/he know the person or people who did this?\nHas she/he seen this more than once?\nHas the child ever seen or been present when someone was\nattacked with a knife?\nIf so\nDid that happen outside the home?\nDid she/he know the person or people who this happened to?\nWas she/he the person who this happened to?\nDid she/he know the person or people who did this?\nHas the child ever seen or been present when someone\nwas shot?\nIf so\nDid that happen outside the home?\nDid she/he know the person or people who this happened to?\nHas she/he ever heard a gun shot?\nIf so\nHas she/he heard a gun shot outside the home?\nHas she/he heard a gun shot more than once?\nHave any of your family members or close friends been\nhurt by a violent act?\nHave any of your family members or close friends been\nkilled by a violent act?\nAll responses were either ``yes'' or ``no''.\nlow (less than the median value, range 1\u00ad25) and high (above the\nNeighbourhood-level confounders\nNeighbourhood disadvantage\nNeighbourhood disadvantage, characterised by community-\nlevel stressors beyond violence (e.g. concentrated poverty,\nunemployment and segregation) may also be a surrogate\nmarker of increased exposure to other environmental expo-\nsures not directly assessed in this study (e.g. ambient\npollutants and indoor allergens) [17]. A disadvantage index\nwas derived for each NC using aggregated data from the 1990\nUS Census (independent of the PHDCN-CS) based on an\naverage z-score for: 1) percentage living below poverty, 2)\npercentage unemployed, 3) percentage on public assistance, 4)\npercentage female-headed households, 5) percentage youth,\nand 6) percentage African Americans [31].\nSocial disorder\nResearch links social disorder to crime and poor health [32].\nSocial disorder itself, or increased crime in this context (i.e. crime\nthat subjects are aware of but have not personally experienced)\nmay independently affect health, including asthma [11]. The\nthree-item scale asked how much of a neighbourhood problem\n(ranging from 0 (``no problem'') to 2 (``serious problem'')) are:\ndrinking in public, selling or using drugs, and teenagers or\nadults loitering and causing trouble. Items were summed, with\nhigher scores indicating greater disorder.\nCollective efficacy\nCollective efficacy measures the level of trust among residents\nand their perceived willingness to engage in collective action\n[18]. Conversely, increased disorder fosters mistrust, isolation\nand a perception of community indifference to individuals in\nneed [15]. Neighbourhoods with high collective efficacy often\nreport less crime [31] and better health [33]. Collective efficacy\nwas derived using a composite measure based on the PHDCN-\nCS social cohesion and informal social control scales [18]. The\nsocial control measure asked whether neighbours would take\naction (from 1 ``strongly agree'' to 4 ``strongly disagree'') if:\nchildren were skipping school or loitering, spray-painting\ngraffiti on a building, or showing disrespect to an adult; or if a\nfight broke out in front of their house, or the fire station closest\nto home was threatened by budget cuts. Social cohesion\nassessed respondents' level of agreement (from 1 ``strongly\nagree'' to 4 ``strongly disagree'') that people in their neighbor-\nhood generally don't get along, do not share the same values,\ncan be trusted, are willing to help their neighbours, or are\nclose-knit (last three items reverse coded). Items were summed\nwith higher scores indicating greater collective efficacy.\nPathway variables\nMaternal health behaviours\nMaternal smoking and breastfeeding behaviours were\nobtained in wave 3.

The correlation between continuous\nvariables was examined, given the concern for collinearity.\nThese multilevel data included individuals at level 1 nested\nwithin 80 NCs at level 2. To account for potential neighbour-\nhood variation in asthma, we used multilevel logistic regres-\nsion models [34], estimated using MLwiN, version 2.10\n(University of Bristol, Bristol, UK), building models in a\nstepwise fashion [35].\nAs represented in figure 2, we examined potential pathways\nlinking community violence, as well as confounders of these\nassociations. First, we modelled the log odds of asthma as a\nfunction of neighbourhood violence, adjusting for the child's\nage, sex, race/ethnicity and maternal asthma, conditional on\nthe random effect for neighbourhoods. We then introduced\nindividual-level confounders: socioeconomic covariates (care-\ngiver's education and equivalised household income) (model\n2); family violence exposure in the home (model 3); mother's\nsmoking status and breastfeeding history (model 4). The final\nmodel (model 5) adjusted for neighbourhood-level confound-\ning (concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy, and social\ndisorder at level 2).\nSensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analyses considered alternative asthma indicators\n(current asthma and unconfirmed possible asthma).\nRESULTS\nSample characteristics are summarised in table 2. Overall, 19%\nof the children had diagnosed asthma. A greater proportion of\nthose exposed to medium (35.2%) or high (43%) community\nviolence had asthma, compared with those with low ETV\n(21.8%) (p,0.01 for both). More African Americans, relative to\nof mothers with asthma were more likely to have asthma\ncompared to those without a maternal history (43.1 versus\nviolence, compared with no family violence (13.2%). Asthma\nwas increased in areas of high concentrated disadvantage\nExperiencing violence in the neighbourhood was significantly\nrelated to family violence in the home, the child's age,\nequivalised income and the neighbourhood constructs,\nalthough the correlations were weak, minimising concerns\nfor collinearity (table 3). Equivalised income, neighbourhood\ndisadvantage, social disorder and collective efficacy were more\nmoderately correlated. However, adding these covariates to\nthe models in various combinations did not significantly\ninfluence the b estimates or standard errors, again lessening\nconcern for collinearity (data not shown) [36].\nIn hierarchical models, community violence, when measured\ncontinuously, was significantly associated with elevated\nasthma risk. Unadjusted analyses revealed an almost 50%\nincreased risk in asthma for every unit increase in the ETV\nadjusting for all individual- and neighbourhood-level covari-\nalternative asthma definitions (current asthma and uncon-\nfirmed possible asthma) (data not shown).\nThe odds ratio for asthma by exposure to community violence\n(measured in tertiles) is presented in table 4. Model 1 is\nadjusted for maternal asthma, child race and sex. In this model,\nassociated with a similarly elevated risk of asthma compared\nto those with low exposure. The effects for community violence\nwere essentially unchanged after further adjusting for all other\nindividual- and neighbourhood-level confounders (model 5).\nIn the fully adjusted model 5, male sex and maternal asthma\nwere independently associated with increased asthma risk.\nNeighbourhood-level constructs were not significantly related\nto asthma.\nNotably, African American race remained independently\nassociated with increased asthma risk in models including\ncommunity violence and all other individual-level covariates\n(model 4). Further adjusting for all three neighbourhood\nconstructs simultaneously attenuated this effect (model 5). In\norder to ascertain which construct was responsible for the\nattenuation we added variables one at a time. Further\nadjustment for concentrated disadvantage and social disorder\nadded to Model 4 (one at a time) did not significantly change\nthe observed relationship with African American race (OR\nrespectively). Upon further adjusting model 4 for collective\nefficacy, the elevated risk in African Americans remained,\nsimilar to the effect estimate in model 5 (including all three\nneighbourhood constructs). This suggested that reduced levels\nof collective efficacy, in part, explains the persistent increased\nrisk for asthma seen in these African American children.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal, multilevel\nstudy to demonstrate a significant association between com-\nmunity violence exposure and increased risk for asthma\ndevelopment in urban children. This association was robust\nto controlling for important individual-level factors (race/\nethnicity, SES, maternal health behaviours and family vio-\nlence), and neighbourhood-level confounders (concentrated\ndisadvantage, social disorder and collective efficacy), and was\nconsistent across alternative outcomes (e.g. current asthma or\nundiagnosed possible asthma).\nOur findings contribute to a growing body of evidence linking\nnumber of mechanisms underlying this association have been\nproposed. Violence exposure has been conceptualised as a\npsychological and environmental stress that taxes both\nindividuals and communities [5]. At the individual level,\nincreased stress may lead to the dysregulation of the\nTABLE 2 Distribution of covariates across the primary asthma outcome#\nAll Asthma No asthma p-value\"\nExposure to family violence 0.07\nData are presented as n, n (%) or mean\u00a1SD, unless otherwise stated. #: childhood asthma outcome is defined as having ever been diagnosed with asthma or ever taking\nprescription asthma medicine; \": for differences between nonmissing multigroup comparisons using Chi-squared distribution.\nc\nhypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal (HPA) and sympathetic\u00adadre-\nnal\u00admedullary (SAM) axes, disrupting immune and respira-\ntory processes, and producing an increased risk of\ninflammatory diseases, such as asthma [3, 5]. Indeed, we\npreviously documented psychopathology and cortisol dysre-\ngulation in school-aged children exposed to higher levels of\ncommunity violence in neighbourhoods in Boston, MA, USA\n[8]. The child's primary caregiver (primarily the mother)\nobviously share the violent environment, and thus violence\nmay operate through influencing behaviours and functioning\nin the mother that then impact asthma expression in the child.\nFor example, violence exposure may result in increased\nsmoking in mothers, thus increasing the child's exposure\n[26]. Similarly, low-income females living with violence may\nbe less likely to breastfeed [27], which may enhance asthma\nrisk. However, adjusting for maternal smoking and breastfeed-\ning behaviours did not reduce the observed effect. Community\nviolence exposure may also result in poor psychological\nfunctioning in mothers (e.g. anxiety and depression) [37] that\nmay, in turn, disrupt parenting behaviours and lead to greater\nstress for the child and altered emotional development [38].\nOther studies show that children exposed to violence tend to\nexpress higher levels of negative emotion (e.g. anxiety and\ndepression). More harmful stress reactivity and negative\nemotion, in turn, have been linked to asthma [38].\nAdditionally, concern about safety may cause parents to\nrestrict their children's outdoor activity and close windows,\npotentially increasing exposure to indoor pollutants. Children\nkept indoors are also more likely to be sedentary; this, in turn,\nmay be linked to obesity, another risk factor for asthma [5].\nFinally, violence-induced stress may potentiate asthma-indu-\ncing effects of other environmental pollutants (e.g. air pollu-\ntion) [3, 12]. Future work should examine these potential\npathways more directly.\nIn models including community violence, concentrated dis-\nadvantage and social disorder, as well as individual-level\ncovariates, an increased risk of asthma in African American\nchildren remained. Notably, when accounting for collective\nefficacy at the neighbourhood level, the elevated risk in\nAfrican Americans was no longer significant. This finding is\ncorroborated by a Chicago study showing lower prevalence of\na composite of respiratory problems (e.g. asthma, emphysema\nand other breathing problems) in association with increased\ncollective efficacy in adults [39]. As pointed out by CAGNEY and\nBROWNING [39], mechanisms may include: 1) social control of\nadverse health behaviours (e.g. smoking); 2) access to high-\nquality healthcare promoting advantageous health practices\n(e.g. breastfeeding); 3) empowerment to act collectively to\naddress adverse environmental factors (e.g. polluting traffic\nsources, housing conditions); and 4) less social isolation\n[40, 41]. These pathways should be examined empirically in\nfuture work.\nStrengths and limitations\nStrengths of the study include the use of longitudinal data, a\nlarge urban sample, application of item response theory to\nsummarise community violence exposure, control for other\nforms of violence (i.e. family violence) as well as other\nimportant confounders, and the employment of multilevel\nanalyses to, at least in part, control for unmeasured neighbour-\nhood factors. Moreover, findings were robust to alternative\nspecifications of the asthma/wheeze outcome. Results should\nalso be interpreted in light of study limitations. We cannot rule\nout some unmeasured confounding factor that is correlated\nboth with community violence and with asthma risk. Exposure\nto community violence is just one type of stressor experienced\nby children, particularly those living in lower-income urban\nenvironments. While we adjust for other forms of violence (i.e.\nfamily violence in the home), we did not have information on\nother stressors (e.g. other negative life events, racism and\nhousing stress) in this dataset. Violence exposure was\nascertained through questionnaires only; there were no\navailable biomarkers of potential stress pathways operating\nbetween community violence and asthma (e.g. cortisol disrup-\ntion) in the PHDCN sample. Those experiencing higher levels\nof community violence may also be exposed to poorer quality\nhousing and greater traffic, or other polluting sources.\nAlthough we considered neighborhood disadvantage to partly\naccount for this, the study did not include questions on\nhousehold characteristics (e.g. allergens and housing quality)\nor more direct measures of the physical toxins that may also\ndisproportionately burden residents in more disadvantaged\ncommunities [17]. We do have an ongoing birth cohort study\nexamining risks for childhood asthma in Boston that is directly\nmeasuring indoor allergens and indoor/outdoor air pollution,\nviolence exposure measures and other relevant stressors, as\nwell as biomarkers, that will be able to address these\nlimitations in the future [42]. Finally, the analysis was limited\nto Chicago and may not be generalisable beyond this region.\nTABLE 3 Correlations between continuous neighborhood constructs and individual-level measures\nPearson correlation (p-value)\nTABLE 4 Associations between community violence exposure and childhood asthma: hierarchical logistic regression#\nCommunity violence\nChild's Age\nSex\nChild's race/ethnicity\nMaternal asthma\nHousehold income\" US$\nMaternal Education\nFamily violence (CTS)\nMaternal smoking\nBreastfeeding\nConcentrated disadvantage\nCollective efficacy\nSocial disorder\nData are presented as odds ratio (95% confidence interval).

From a\npolicy perspective, our findings suggest that public health\ninterventions outside of the biomedical model (e.g. neighbour-\nhood safety programmes) may be advantageous in reducing\nthe asthma burden in disadvantaged populations. Research to\nmore fully elucidate the excess asthma burden among African\nAmerican children, and the potential role of collective efficacy\nin reducing that burden, is also warranted.
