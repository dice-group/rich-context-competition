Much of\nour society has become more knowledgeable about identify-\ning symptoms and more willing to seek help from mental\nhealth professionals; we are gradually becoming more sensi-\ntive to the fact that mental health and mental illness can be\neveryday family issues. At the same time, however, the way\nin which individual families experience and cope with men-\ntally unhealthy members can vary greatly based on family\ndemographic variables. That is, ethnicity can have a signifi-\ncant impact on how families perceive and treat mental ill-\nnesses, and there is a need to increase our limited\nunderstanding of mental health/illness issues among ethnic\nand immigrant families (Takeuchi, Alegria, Jackson, & Wil-\nliams, 2007). Some work has been done to identify links\nbetween research variables among ethnic samples in the\nUnited States (Mossakowski, 2007; Perez, Fortuna, &\nexplanations for existing findings and/or theoretical models\nhave yet to be presented. The purpose of this article will be\nto discuss research findings using theABC-X Model of Fam-\nily Stress to highlight unique stressors, resources, and per-\nceptions that should be considered when studying how ethnic\nfamilies understand and seek treatment for mental health\nissues. Future areas of research, and ideas for programmatic\nand policy initiatives will also be presented.\nThe ABC-X Model of Family Stress\nand Ethnic Families\nFamily stress research has a history dating back nearly a\ncentury (Hill, 1949), and current family scholars continue to\nrefine the family stress model (Boss, 2002) and expand the\napplication of the theoretical perspective to a variety of fam-\nily transitions and circumstances (Price, Price, & McKenry,\nA (the provoking or stressor event of sufficient magni-\ntude to result in chance in a family)-interacting with B\n(the family's resources or strengths)-interacting with C\n(the definition or meaning attached to the event by the\nfamily)-produces X (stress or crisis).

Therefore, they apply\nthe family stress theory and the ABC-X Model to review the\nmost recent research on the epidemiology and etiology of\nmental illness, as well as the assessment of family resources\nand community-based resources. However, these authors\nnote that there is far less information regarding ethnic indi-\nviduals and their families, and that\nresearch is needed to identify reasons for lower mental\nillness rates among non-Caucasians in the United\nStates and what role certain protective factors such as\nethnic identity, religiosity, lifestyle choices and cul-\ntural values might have in contributing to mental\nHow can theABC-X Model of Family Stress (Boss, 2002)\nbe used to frame the discussion of ethnic families' experi-\nences of mental illness? By applying this useful theoretical\nmodel, \"A\" refers to the stressor event, which would be the\nfamily member's mental illness. Thus, it will be relevant to\ndiscuss the number of ethnic families in the United States\nwho are affected by mental illness, as well as research related\nto the causes of mental illness that might be unique to many\nnon-Caucasian families. The \"B\" factor represents available\nresources that can exist within the individual, within the\nfamily system, and within the community. Hence, it will be\nvaluable to identify family strengths that are characteristic of\nethnic families that can aid in the treatment of mental ill-\nnesses. Also, community resources that exist for families\ncoping with mental illness, such as treatment programs,\ncommunity-based organizations, web-based support sys-\ntems, and social policy efforts must be evaluated in consider-\nation of particular barriers that might exist for ethnic families.\nThe \"C\" element in the family stress theory model refers to\nthe family's perceptions of mental illness, recognizing that\nthe family members' views of mental illness translate into\nbehaviors and attitudes that have a direct impact on the well-\nbeing of mentally ill family members. For instance, the\nstigma that is attached to mental illness can be strongly\ninfluenced by cultural and family belief systems, and these\nviews affect the manner in which family members show sup-\nport to the mentally ill family member and display flexibility\nin seeking nonfamilial treatment for the mental illness.\nA: Mental Illnesses in Ethnic Families\nThe \"A\" element in the ABC-X Model represents the\nstressor. According to the ABC-X Model, and borrowing\nfrom family systems theory (Smith, Hamon, Ingoldsby, &\nonly affect an individual, but it will also have an impact on\nhis or her family members. What do we know about the\noverall occurrence of mental illness in this country? Current\npatterns of mental illness in the U.S. population can be esti-\nmated by using available information about the incidence\nand prevalence of various disorders. Several large-scale\nstudies have been conducted in the United States to provide\nestimations of the most current mental illness rates, such as\nthe National Institute of Mental Health's Epidemiological\nCatchment Area Study (Regier, Burke, & Burke, 1990) and\nthe National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R;\nmated that nearly 56 million people in the United States will\nexperience a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year\n(National Institute of Mental Health, 2008).\nHowever, there have only been a few recent large-scale\nstudies that have focused on collecting ethnic data; hence,\nthe limited information that is available concerning mental\nillness rates among various ethnic groups in the United\nStates is based on very few national epidemiological studies.\nFor instance, the NCS-R collected data from Latinos and\nAfrican Americans, but the sample was limited to English-\nspeaking Latinos and did not disaggregate data among\nLatinos based on important factors such as immigration sta-\ntus or country of origin (Alegria et al., 2008). The National\nLatino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) gathered data\nrelated to prevalence of mental illness disorders and mental\nhealth treatment/service usage in the United States. The sam-\nple was stratified into ethnic subgroup categories (e.g.,\nPuerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Other Latinos, Chinese,\nVietnamese, Filipino, and Other Asians) to allow for within-\nethnic-group comparisons (Center for Multicultural Mental\nHealth Research, 2008). Data from these recent studies sug-\ngest that many mental disorder rates are lower for most eth-\nnic groups compared with Caucasians (Alegria et al., 2008;\nLatinos and African Americans had lower rates of internal-\nizing disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder, depression, social\nphobia) and some externalizing disorders (e.g., oppositional-\ndefiant disorder, impulse control disorders) than did\nData on mental illness rates for Asian Americans, how-\never, appear to be inconsistent and complex, and depend on\nSchock-Giordano 3\nfactors such as gender, nativity, generation status, and\nEnglish-language proficiency (Takeuchi, Zane, et al., 2007).\nFurthermore, among Latinos, mental illness rates have been\nfound to be lower for non-U.S. born Latinos versus those\nborn in the United States (Grant et al., 2004; Takeuchi,\nAlegria, et al., 2007). These findings suggest that, in some\nway, immigrants' assimilation into American culture may\nhave a deleterious effect on mental health, although exactly\nhow so remains unclear. In addition, when within group\ncomparisons among Latinos were investigated, differences\nemerged based on country of origin, such that Mexicans\nwere at higher risk for anxiety and depressive disorder com-\npared with Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latinos (Alegria\net al., 2008). Thus, it will be imperative to consider impor-\ntant ethnic group variables, such as generation status and\nbirth country, when conducting studies of immigrants who\nhave and have not been born and raised in the United States.\nIn addition, although these current rates present a positive\noutlook for many ethnic families, it still will be valuable to\nfurther understand potential causes of mental illness that\nmay be uniquely related to ethnicity, such as economic hard-\nship, assimilation challenges, and social injustices (Grant et\nB: Resources\nAccording to the Model of Family Stress, resources can\nexist at the individual, family, and community levels\n(McCubbin & Patterson, 1985). Resources will contribute to\nthe \"X\" or outcome in the ABC-X Model, such that the exis-\ntence and utilization of resources at multiple levels will\nalways relate to how families experience a stressor. Thus, to\nfurther examine the possible reasons for lower mental illness\nrates among non-Caucasians in the United States, future\nresearch should consider the way in which these variables,\nsuch as factors related to immigration, act as resources or\nprotective factors that might contribute to the mental health\nof ethnic families. For instance, some findings have shown\nthat ethnic identity (e.g., sense of ethnic pride, cultural com-\nmitment to an ethnic group, involvement in ethnic practices)\nhasbeenrelatedtofewerdepressedsymptoms(Mossakowski,\n2003). Similarly, several studies involving foreign-born and\nFilipinos (Mossakowski, 2007) have found that foreign-born\nethnic members have a lower risk of mental illness than\nU.S.-born ethnicities. Based on these findings, it appears\nthat adhering to one's traditional family culture and having\na strong sense of personal ethnic identity serve as protective\nfactors against mental illness.\nProtective factors can also be available through many\ntypes of formal and informal social networks. In fact, in a\nsample of Mexican migrant farmers, high levels of reported\ninstrumental support (e.g., financial and transportation assis-\ntance) and emotional social support (providing comfort\nwhen needed) were related to lower rates of depressive\nsymptoms (Alderete, Vega, Kolody, & Aguilar-Gaxiola,\n1999). Research has also shown that residing in an ethnically\nalike community can also serve as a protective factor, in that\nliving in a neighborhood that is populated with those who\nshare one's cultural background may translate into a greater\nnumber of local social networks (Eschbach, Ostir, Patel,\nClearly, there is a need to specifically investigate the way\nin which some protective factors, which are common among\nmany ethnic families, are related to rates of mental illness.\nFor instance, how influential is the strong emotional, psy-\nchological, and financial support from immediate and\nextended family members that is characteristic of many eth-\nnic and immigrant families' cultural value systems in main-\ntaining mental health? What role do factors such as\nsocioeconomic status, location of residence, age at immigra-\ntion, and community support play in mediating the relation-\nship between ethnicity and mental health?\nC: Family Perceptions\nIn the ABC-X Model of Family Stress, perceptions are criti-\ncal in determining the eventual impact of the stressor on the\nfamily because they are important in understanding how a\nfamily assesses the magnitude of a stressor, and also how the\nfamily assesses the availability and utility of internal and\nexternal resources. When focusing on non-White families in\nthe United States, there may be some particular types of\nperceptions that are more common among ethnic families\nand that are also related to how the family copes with\nstressor events, such as perceived discrimination and the\nstigma associated with mental illness.\nIt has been estimated that prevalence rates of discrimina-\ntion experiences among Latinos and African Americans are\nat 38% and 53%, respectively (Stuber, Galea, Ahern, Blaney,\n& Fuller, 2003), and findings have shown that perceived dis-\ncrimination (e.g., self-reported experiences of everyday\nunfair treatment) has been linked to the mental health of eth-\nnic families living in the United States. Specifically, discrim-\ninatory practices, in the form of job inequalities, inadequate\nmental health, and lack of community supports have been\nrelated to elevated depression rates in a sample of Mexican-\norigin adults (Finch, Hummer, Kol, & Vega, 2009), and an\nincrease in perceived discrimination over time was related to\nhigher rates of depressive symptoms and poorer general\nhealth among African American females compared with\nCaucasian women (Schulz et al., 2000). Research also shows\nthat ethnic identification is related to less perceived discrimi-\nnation, suggesting that \"people with high levels of ethnic\nidentity may be more likely to associate with people of their\nown ethnicity and therefore be less exposed to discrimina-\ntion between perceptions of self, perceptions of stressors\n(e.g., discrimination), and mental health will be a valuable\ndirection for further research.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe perceived stigma of mental illness that families\nexperience can have negative psychological consequences\nfor the mentally unhealthy individual, such as lower self-\nesteem levels, reduced social contacts, job loss, and family\nrelationship difficulties (Mittleman, 1985; Wahl & Harman,\n1989). Research shows that ethnic families may be more\nconcerned about stigma related to mental illness than Whites\n(Cooper-Patrick et al., 1997). For instance, in a qualitative\nstudy in which participants responded to vignettes about\nmentally ill (i.e., schizophrenia) persons, non-Caucasians\nwere more likely to report less pity for the individual's\nhealth condition and also perceive the condition of mental\nillness to be more dangerous than did Caucasians (Corrigan\n& Watson, 2007). Also, a sample of depressed African\nAmericans and Latinos were significantly more likely to\nsite social barriers (e.g., embarrassment of disclosing the\nmental health problem and worry that one's employer would\nfind out) as reasons to not seek treatment when compared\nwith Caucasians (Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Other similar\nfindings have shown that in a sample of Asian American\ncollege students, the less acculturated students were more\nlikely to exhibit more stigmatized attitudes toward seeking\nprofessional psychological assistance (Atkinson & Gim,\n1989); again, it will be important to examine the relative\nimpact that level of acculturation has on ethnic families and\ntheir mental health.\nWhy Does the Stigma of Mental\nIllness Seem to Have a Greater\nImpact on Ethnic Families?\nReflecting on their findings involving Asian American col-\nlege students, Atkinson and Gim (1989) proposed,\nIt may be that some of the values common across these\nethnicities (e.g., fear of bringing shame to the family,\nsubmergence of individuality, somatization of symp-\ntoms, self control to resolve problems, restraint of\nstrong feelings, and respect for authority) account for\nthe similar pattern across ethnicities of attitudes\ntoward professional psychological help. (p. 211)\nIn other words, a high value for self-reliance, a trait that is\ncharacteristic of many ethnic families, actually contributes to\na negative view of mental illness by implying a weakness;\nthus, individuals in the family do not want to admit to having\nmental health problems, and the family does not allow for\nnonfamilial persons to become aware of or help with any\nmental illnesses that may exist within the family system\n(Ortega & Alegria, 2002). In addition, a negative perception\ncould exist because ethnic families, especially new immi-\ngrants who may have difficulty with English-language profi-\nciency, do not understand or feel comfortable accessing\nservices in the U.S. mental health system. These possible\nconsiderations can be especially helpful in proposing future\ncommunity and policy initiatives.\nReligion\nAffiliation with a particular religion is a common character-\nistic of many ethnicities in the United States: \"Religious\ninvolvement is a vital factor in some ethnic minority groups\nthat enables people to retain cultural roots in a dominant\nsociety that holds different values\" (King, Weich, Nazroo, &\nreligion can aid ethnic families in coping with stress, such as\na mental illness, some researchers have posited that a multi-\ndimensional conceptualization of religion must be used\nbecause religion can be helpful in a variety of ways.\nSpecifically, religion can manifest as (a) religious/spiritual\nbeliefs and faith in a higher power, (b) religious affiliation\nand membership in religious communities, and (c) increased\nsocial relationships and interactions through church atten-\ndance (van Olphen et al., 2003). Interestingly, then, in the\ncontext of the ABC-X Model, religion can be viewed as both\na resource (social supports, personal relationships) and a\nperception (faith, a sense of belonging to a group and/or\npurpose).\nReligious beliefs and experiencing faith in a higher power\nthrough prayer can serve as a barrier to mental illness among\nethnic families. For example, findings have shown that\nMexican families are more likely to use religion, faith, and\nreframing as a coping mechanism compared with Caucasians\n(Farley, Galves, Dickinson, & Perez, 2005), and frequency\nof prayer has been linked to fewer self-reported depressive\nsymptoms in a sample of African American women (van\nOlphen et al., 2003). Furthermore, in the same study of\nAfrican American women, frequency of church attendance\nand reported feelings of social support from within the\nchurch were also related to fewer self-reported depressive\nsymptoms. Ellison, Boardman, Williams, and Jackson (2001)\nfound mixed support for several theoretical models that were\ntested in their study that linked ethnicity, religion, stress, and\nmental health; hence, the authors conclude that future studies\nshould identify which types of religious involvement are\nrelated to particular mental health outcomes. Further research\nmust provide a more clear understanding of the mechanisms\nby which ethnicity, religion, and mental health are related.\nX: Outcome and Implications\nAccording to the family stress model, when families are\nexperiencing mental health problems, the result, which will\nbe a function of the stressor, resources, and perceptions, can\nend in numerous positive and negative outcomes. For\ninstance, negative outcomes that families may experience\ncould include dealing with objective burdens (e.g., cost of\nproviding medical care, housing, insurance) and subjective\nburdens (e.g., exhaustion, reduced social contacts, family\nSchock-Giordano 5\nstigma), whereas positive outcomes may involve enhanced\nfamily relationships, caregiver satisfaction, and advocacy\nefforts (Schock-Giordano & Gavazzi, 2010).\nAdditional positive outcomes that the mentally ill indi-\nvidual might experience, such as adaptive coping strategies\nand symptom management, certainly could be facilitated\nthrough service use and treatment adherence, yet research\nhas shown that some ethnic groups report lower rates of\nutilization of mental health services than do Caucasians\nestimated that \"among Latinos with a diagnosable mental\nhealth disorder, fewer than one in eleven contact a health\nprofessional for treatment, compared with one of every three\nnon-Hispanic whites\" and \"the percentage of African\nAmericans receiving mental health services is only half that\ntrend might be explained by inadequate family resources in\nthe form of financial issues (e.g., cost of care, poor insurance\ncoverage, loss of pay from work) and social issues (e.g., dis-\ncomfort with English-language fluency) that serve as signifi-\ncant barriers to accessing mental health services for ethnic\nfamilies (Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Another practical obsta-\ncle to seeking services for ethnic families may be geographic\naccessibility. In fact, in their study of mental health outpa-\ntient recipients, Kouzumi, Rothbard, and Kuno (2009) found\nthat Latino and African American clients were not as likely\nas Caucasians to travel a large distance for treatment, sug-\ngesting that geographic proximity to care will be an impor-\ntant issue to consider in ethnic communities. Furthermore,\nthe authors note that \"variation in provider quality by geo-\ngraphic location appears to be one of the mechanisms that\nmay generate racial disparities in quality of care, given the\nprevious finding that poorer quality programs were found in\nhigh minority, low income neighborhoods\" (Kouzumi,\nTo better understand the many different barriers that exist\nfor ethnic families coping with mental illness, it also will be\nnecessary to study the important links between ethnic fami-\nlies' perceptions of mental illness as a condition, such as\nwhether the issue will resolve on its own and expectations\nabout the effectiveness of treatment (Anglin, Alberti, Link, &\nPhelan, 2008), especially since many ethnic families may seek\nout and rely on nonprofessional help (e.g., extended family\nmembers, religious leaders) to ameliorate their mental health\nissues (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002). In addi-\ntion, it will be helpful to further investigate the preferred\nmethod of treatment for various mental illnesses among ethnic\nfamilies (Givens, Houston, Van Voorhees, Ford, & Cooper,\n2007) and these families' satisfaction with received services.\nWhen ethnic families do seek mental health care, how\nwell do existing interventions translate among and resonate\nwith families' various culturally specific values, needs, and\nperspectives? In their comprehensive review of existing\nmental health treatments, Miranda et al. (2005) examined the\nefficacy of evidence-based treatments when serving ethnic\nfamilies to determine whether culturally enhanced treat-\nments should be developed. Their review suggested that\nexisting treatments are effective with ethnic individuals, yet\nthe authors contend that \"protocols or guidelines that con-\nsider culture and context with evidence-based care is likely\nto facilitate engagement in treatment and probably to enhance\npropose two important areas for future research for clinicians\nand professionals working with culturally diverse popula-\ntions; that is, researches need to (a) develop a method for\nensuring that interventions include the unique concerns and\nneeds of ethnic families and (b) develop strategies to encour-\nage ethnicities to engage in available mental health care\noptions.\nMajor mental health system and public policy efforts are\nneeded to improve service delivery to ethnic families. For\ninstance, initiatives could include a more comprehensive\npublic awareness educational campaign that addresses symp-\ntoms, course, and treatment plans related to mental illnesses;\ngreater variety in available services, including where and\nwhen appointments are offered and languages used by pro-\nfessionals; enhancing workplace tolerance for mental health\nleave; and improvements with insurance coverage and use\n(Ojeda & McGuire, 2006). Based on previously sited\nresearch, expanding mental health locations within the eth-\nnic communities for easier accessibility and perhaps the use\nof religious places of worship as potential liaisons to link\nmental health services with ethnic families might be poten-\ntial avenues to explore. Educating extended family members\nabout mental illness etiology and treatment, especially those\nwho might adhere to negative stigmas toward mental illness,\nwill be an effective way to foster supportive family environ-\nments. Furthermore, larger scale social policy concerns that\nexist for many ethnic families, such as income, housing, and\neducation inequalities, have an impact on mental health and\nshould be addressed as well (Alegria et al., 2003). Future\nresearch and policy efforts that aim to better understand how\nethnic families approach factors related to elements in the\nABC-X Model will be valuable in identifying the most effec-\ntive way to address their mental health issues and result in\npositive outcomes for families and individuals.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n6 SAGE Open\nReferences\nAbe-Kim, J., Takeuchi, D.
