    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite our extensive knowledge of the structure of negatively charged cell surface proteoglycans and sialoglycoconjugates in\nthe brain, we have little understanding of how their negative charge contributes to brain function. We have previously shown\nthat intensely photoluminescent 9-nm diameter quantum dots (QDs) with a CdSe core, a ZnS shell, and a negatively charged\ncompact molecular ligand coating (CL4) selectively target neurons rather than glia. We now provide an explanation for this\nselective neuronal delivery. In this study, we compared three zwitterionic QD coatings differing only in their regions of\npositive or negative charge, as well as a positively charged (NH2\n) polyethylene glycol (PEG) coat, for their ability to deliver\nthe cell-membrane-penetrating chaperone lipopeptide JB577 (WG(Palmitoyl)VKIKKP9\n) to individual cells in neonatal\nrat hippocampal slices. We confirm both that preferential uptake in neurons, and the lack of uptake in glia, is strongly\nassociated with having a region of greater negative charge on the QD coating. In addition, the role of negatively charged\nchondroitin sulfate of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in restricting uptake was further suggested by digesting neonatal rat\nhippocampal slices with chondroitinase ABC and showing increased uptake of QDs by oligodendrocytes. Treatment still did\nnot affect uptake in astrocytes or microglia. Finally, the future potential of using QDs as vehicles for trafficking proteins into\ncells continues to show promise, as we show that by administering a histidine-tagged green fluorescent protein (eGFP-His6\n)\nto hippocampal slices, we can observe neuronal uptake of GFP.\n",

Peptides alone, with or without\ntargeting signals conjugated to them, will rarely pass the\nblood\u00adbrain barrier, and not in any concentration that\nwould be efficacious (Carman et al., 2011). The use of\nsemiconductor QDs provides a potential vehicle for deliv-\nery, bioactivity testing, and visualization of attached\ncargos due to their robust fluorescence, resistance to\nphotobleaching, and ease of peptide attachment via uti-\nlizing a simple polyhistidine-Zn interaction (Medintz\net al., 2005). Native QDs such as those synthesized with\na CdSe/ZnS core/shell structure need to be surface func-\ntionalized to make them colloidally stable and reduce\nresearchers to append peptides to the QD surface to\nassist in trafficking or peptide ligation. In this study, we\nhave used several modified compact ligand (CL) coatings\n(Figure 1) that show greater cell-type specificity of uptake\nthan those displaying neutral or unmodified polyethylene\nglycol (PEG). We have previously shown that zinc on the\nsurface of the QD can bind histidine-tagged peptides and\nproteins such as maltose-binding protein (Boeneman\net al., 2013), and that by using the QD as a delivery\nvehicle, we can attach signaling peptides to the surface\nto further specify the target location. We previously\nshowed that a QD with a negative coat (CL4) facilitated\nthe delivery of a cargo (Palm-1/JB577) to neurons rather\nthan astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia (Walters\net al., 2012) and now report that the surface charge is\ncritical for this cell-specific uptake.\nIn the current study, we expand our QD investigation\nto include three different CL coats with modified struc-\ntures and resultant regions of charge and found that the\ncoats varied dramatically in their targeting behavior. In\naddition, we utilize a positively charged PEG coating and\nshow uptake in oligodendrocytes. Finally, we modified\nthe charge of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of two\nin vitro systems and found that this can also contribute\nto QD targeting (Soleman et al., 2013). These results con-\nfirm that both the charge of the QD, as well as the charge\nof the target cell, strongly influences the trafficking and\nfate of the QD in the CNS and by inference the intercel-\nlular trafficking of proteins.\nMaterials and Methods\nQuantum Dots\nCdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs with an emission maxima cen-\ntered at $625 nm were made hydrophilic by exchanging\nthe native hydrophobic ligands with dihydrolipoic acid\n(DHLA)-based CLs shown in Figure 1, see also\nSusumu et al.

All peptides were\nsynthesized using Boc (t-butoxycarbonyl)-solid phase\npeptide synthesis, purified by high-performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC), and purity verified by electro-\nspray ionization-MS (ESI-MS; Dawson et al., 2010).

The peptides were purified,\ndesalted, and quantitated before being lyophilized and\nstored at \u00c020C until used as described (Sapsford et al.,\nMicroscopy and Image Analysis\nThe intracellular distribution of QDs was analyzed by\nfluorescence microscopy using a Marianas fully auto-\nmated Yokogawa-type spinning disc confocal microscope\nequipped with 40 \u00c2 and 100 \u00c2 oil-immersion lenses.\nQuantification of fluorescence via pixel intensity was\nmeasured through ImageJ and graphically represented\nthrough Microsoft Excel.

Briefly, Wistar rat pups (P9\u00adP10,\nwhere P is postnatal day) were anesthetized with a pro-\nand decapitated, the\nbrains removed and placed into Hanks balanced salt\nsolution (HBSS; 3C) supplemented with D-glucose\n(6.5 mg/ml). Hippocampi were then isolated and sec-\ntioned (350-mm thick) perpendicular to their septotem-\nporal axis. Slices displaying an intact pyramidal neuron\ncell layer and dentate gyrus were transferred to uncoated\n30-mm Millicell-CMTM tissue culture inserts (Millipore,\nEMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in six-well culture\ndishes. Cultures were initially maintained in medium con-\nDiv. of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY,\nUSA) for 18 days in vitro before being transferred\nto serum-free media for an additional 3 days in vitro\nbefore experimentation (Mitchell et al., 2010).

The astrocytes\nwill form a bed layer upon the flask, while the oligo-\ndendrocytes and remnant microglia will attach to that.\nThe oligodendrocytes can then be separated from the\nastrocytes by a series of shakes. The first shake is carried\nout at 7 days and subsequently at 1-week intervals with\nshakes 2, 3, and 4 giving the highest yield of 98% pure\nastrocytes and microglia-free neonatal rat oligodendro-\ncytes.

For oligodendrocytes, we used a\nmouse monoclonal antibody to myelin basic protein\n(MAB1580, Millipore), which has been shown to specif-\nically stain both early and mature oligodendrocytes and\nmyelin (Friedman et al., 1989).

All three were designed\nto be a more compact version of DHLA-PEG ligands\npreviously used for coating QDs (Susumu et al., 2007).\nWe have previously shown that neutral PEG-methoxy\ncapped QDs do not give appreciable neuronal uptake,\nwhile CL4-displaying QDs show robust neuronal target-\ning (Walters et al., 2012). We wished to extend our pre-\nvious study to include similar QDs to investigate whether\ncharge is mediating neuronal targeting. CL1 contains a\npiperidine ring and only one carboxyl group, giving a\nregion of stronger positive charge than the single nitrogen\nfound in CL4 and CL2. CL2 could be considered neutral\nby virtue of the tertiary amine and the single carboxyl\ngroup, whereas CL4 has a more negatively charged\nregion by virtue of its two carboxyl groups. We show\nthat replacement of one carboxyl group in CL4 still\nallowed neuronal-specific uptake in rat hippocampal cul-\ntures (Figure 2(b) and (c)), while removing a carboxyl\ngroup and adding a piperazine ring (CL1) leads to mark-\nedly less neuronal specificity (while still maintaining some\ntargeting), approximating what was seen with PEG\n(Figure 3(a)) with respect to diffuse extracellular labeling\ninstead of strong intracellular puncta. Finally, we include\na positively charged PEG QD (DHLA-PEG600-NH2\n),\nwhich exhibits similar distribution to CL1 as well as\nbeing the only QD we have tested that traffics to oligo-\ndendrocytes without treatment (Figure 3).\nTo determine whether the behavior of the different\ncoats was dependent upon the milieu charge of the neur-\nonal cultures more than the charge of the coat peptides\nthemselves, we attempted to remove negatively charged\nproteoglycans (Maroto et al., 2013), expressed more\nheavily by glial than neuronal cells (Schwartz and\nDomowicz, 2014), by treating rat hippocampal slices\nwith chondroitinase ABC. The digestion with chondroi-\ntinase ABC cleaves disaccharide units, leaving an oligo-\nsaccharide stub on the proteoglycan core protein that is\nrecognized by a specific antibody MAB2030. This CS\nmonoclonal antibody only reacts with digested cartilage\nproteoglycans, not with native proteoglycans (Takeuchi\net al., 2013).

Second, to confirm\nthe idea that charge was critical to trafficking, we show\nthat degrading the ECM with chondroitinase ABC (an\nenzyme that digests negatively charged CS, a major com-\nponent of the glial ECM) increased trafficking and uptake\nof QDs into oligodendrocytes but had no effect on astro-\ncytes or microglia. The role of cell surface charge in cell\nuptake (endocytosis) has not been previously studied and\nrepresents a new concept in facilitating translational\nefforts in the CNS such as enzyme replacement therapy.\nFinally, we show that the CL4 QDs can be used to traffic\nproteins, in this case GFP, into the cell bodies of neurons\nin culture. These novel results suggest a method for dir-\necting the targeting and fate of clinically relevant cargo in\nthe brain through the manipulation of both the vehicle's\ncharge as well as the charge of the target location.\nPreviously, we have investigated the trafficking of\nthe novel cell-penetrating peptide WG(Pal)DapVKI\nQDs were chosen instead of a traditional tag due to\ntheir robust and stable fluorescence, in addition to afford-\ning stable attachment of the His6-terminated peptide to\nthe zinc surface of the CdSe/ZnS QD.

The lipopeptide is a nonhydrolysable analog of the\npalmitoylated K-Ras4A (CVKIKK) structure in which\nthe thiol group of cysteine was replaced by a diaminopro-\npanol (Dap) and the remaining sequence (VKIKK) func-\ntions as a chaperone and a cell-penetrating peptide\nWe demonstrated that such a lipopeptide complex can\nbe taken up into cells by endocytosis and released from\nthe endosome over a 72-hr period (Boeneman et al.,\n2013). This was demonstrated in cultured cell lines by\nusing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nanalysis, which showed that the peptide initially stays\nassociated with the QDs for at least 72 hr (Delehanty\net al., 2010). Commercially available QDs are typically\ncoated with an amphiphilic copolymer that may have\nadditional PEG groups displayed on it to decrease tox-\nicity as well as increase nanoparticle stability (Algar et al.,\nQDs instead of PEG with the JB577 peptide, we found\nthat the QD preferentially trafficked to neurons in both\nrat hippocampal cultures as well as human fibroblasts\n(Walters et al., 2012).

CL4 is a dipolar\nmolecule, containing two negatively charged carboxyl\ngroups on one end. We now report that when the QD\ncore is coated with a DHLA-based ligand containing at\nleast one carboxyl group as well as a tertiary amine (as in\nCL2), the QD can be delivered to neurons in rat hippo-\ncampal slices as efficiently as with CL4. However, a coat\ncontaining only one carboxyl group and a piperazine ring\n(CL1) leads to noticeably reduced neuronal specificity\nand a mostly extracellular distribution as we reported\npreviously for PEG (Figure 2). Interestingly, positively\ncharged PEG shows similar distribution as CL1 in CA3\nregion of the hippocampus but strikingly shows uptake in\noligodendrocytes as well (Figure 3). These data indicate\nthat charge is playing a role in the targeting of QDs into\nneuronal cell bodies. Such phenomena would require that\ncharge surrounding the cells should also play a role, so we\ndecided to investigate whether digesting negatively\ncharged extracellular polymers such as CSs could\nmodify the trafficking of QDs.\nExtracellular factors have been shown to affect axonal\nregeneration, which is essential for recovery from spinal\nTakeuchi et al., 2013). CSs are produced mainly by astro-\ncytes and oligodendrocytes in which uronic acid, plus\nextensive sulfation, results in a negatively charged glyco-\ncalyx (Schwartz and Domowicz, 2014). Bacterially\nderived enzymatic digestion of this matrix with chondroi-\ntinase ABC has been shown to increase axonal regener-\nation following injury and upregulation of glial-derived\nchondroitin sulfates proteoglycans (CSPGs) that create a\n(a) (b)\nChondroi\nnase\n(+)\nControl\nPixel Intensity\nAstrocytes\nAverage Red\nChannel\nChondroi\nnase\n(+)\nControl\nPixel Intensity\nMicroglia\nAverage Red\nChannel\n(c)\n(d) (e) (f)\nFigure 6.

Such a treatment or deletion does not\naffect heparan sulfate synthesis (in fact, it has been\nshown to increase it), and this proteoglycan is typically\nfound on the surface of neurons, being important for\nactivation of many growth factor receptors. Because\nendosomal uptake of CL4-QDs was observed in hippo-\ncampal neurons but not in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,\nand microglia present in the same hippocampal slice, we\ntested the hypothesis that glial-derived, negatively\ncharged ECM molecules such as CSs could be preventing\nendocytosis of QDs into nonneuronal cell types.\nChondroitinase ABC cleaves a particularly broad\nrange of galactosaminoglycan (GalAG) substrates,\nincluding CS, dermatin sulfate (DS) and, to a much\nlesser extent, hyaluronic acid. Neuronal galactosamino-\nglycans are composed of disaccharide repeat units of\nuronic acid [IduA (a-L-iduronic acid) or GlcA (b-D-glu-\ncuronic acid)] (1!3) linked to GalNAc (N-acetyl-D-\ngalactosamine). These basic disaccharide units are lin-\nearly associated via b-(1!4) linkages to form mostly\npolymers of CS attached at multiple points along a core\nprotein. Biosynthesis of CS involves sulfation of the sugar\nbackbone at various positions, which generates diversity\nin their oligosaccharide sequences. CS is commonly O-\nsulfated at the C-4 of the N-acetylgalactosamine [C4S\n(chondroitin-4-sulfate) or CSA], the C-6 of the N-acetyl-\ngalactosamine [C6S (chondroitin-6-sulfate) or CSC], or\niduronic acid and C4 of GalNAc (CSB; Schwartz and\nDomowicz, 2014). Other rare modifications in CS, such\nas 2-O-or 3-O-sulfation of the GlcA moieties, have also\nbeen reported (Prabhakar et al., 2005). Treatment with\nchondroitinase ABC has been shown to cause changes in\nthe ECM through digestion of CS and, to a much lesser\n*\nCL4 QD-GFP Control\nPixel Intensity\nAverage Green Channel Fluorescence\nAverage Green Channel\nPixel Intensity\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nFigure 7. GFP can be trafficked into neurons with CL4. GFP with a histidine tag (His6\n) can be conjugated to CL4 dots and trafficked into\nneurons. (a) GFP-His6\nCL4 dots were applied for 24 hr and show similar distribution in CA3 region of hippocampus as previously described\nwithout CL4 shows very little uptake in the same slices when applied for the same\ntime period. This shows that CL4 QDs can be used to traffic large proteins (32.7 kDa) such as GFP. (c) Quantification of green channel\nfluorescence around the CA3 region of the hippocampus following application of GFP shows that cells treated with GFP conjugated to CL4\nthrough His6\nshow significantly increased trafficking into neurons compared with GFP alone (Student's independent t test: p <.005).

Chondroitinase\nABC digests CS-GAG chains into soluble sulfated disac-\ncharides by beta-elimination, leaving the core protein\nintact (detectable by antibodies such as BE-123 to the\nchondroitin-4-sulfate stub). This prevents the CSPG-\nmatrix glycoprotein interactions, which inhibit axonal\napproach is further supported by the observation that\nscar formation following injury to the CNS is strongly\nassociated with negatively charged CSs of the ECM, and\ntreatment with chondroitinase ABC has been shown to\nreduce the thickness of the glial zone surrounding a cere-\nbral artery (Hill et al., 2012). Therefore, we attempted to\nreduce the amount of negative charge in the ECM sur-\nrounding other cell types present in hippocampal slices\nthrough digestion of CS by chondroitinase ABC in an\neffort to increase uptake of CL4 QDs in these cell types.\nTreatment with chondroitinase ABC for 6 hr and\nlonger showed increased CL4 QD uptake in oligodendro-\ncytes, both in hippocampal slice cultures and oligo-\ndendrocyte monocultures. This suggests that negative\ncharge is a contributing factor to neuronal targeting of\nCL4 QDs. This argument is in agreement with our CL2\ndata showing similar neuronal specificity with slightly\nreduced uptake, and with our CL1 coat data, which\nshows a decrease in neuronal specificity with the removal\nof one of the carboxyl groups and the addition of a\npiperazine with two positive charges. This indicates that\nthe areas of negative charge on the CL4 or CL2 coat\nconvey neuronal specificity in a way that is not possible\nwith a more positively charged coat like CL1. Together,\nthese data show that at least one negatively charged carb-\noxyl on the QD coat (CL2/4) is sufficient to target the QD\nto the neuronal cell body with little to no uptake in other\ncell types. By changing the charge of the coat protein\nfrom negative to positive (dipolar), however, the QD\nexhibits a distribution similar to what we observed\nusing PEG QDs. Furthermore, by removal of negatively\ncharged proteoglycans in cell culture, it is possible to\nincrease CL4 trafficking to oligodendrocytes in both hip-\npocampal and monoculture systems, suggesting that\nneuronal targeting is significantly influenced by charge.\nWe have previously only tested neutrally charged PEG\nbut not positively charged nanoparticles (Walters et al.,\n2012). In this study, we include a positively charged vari-\n) and show that it behaves as\none would predict from our previous data with the add-\nition that it appears to traffic nicely into oligodendrocytes\nin culture, something we have yet to see with the other\nQDs without chondroitinase treatment. Other investiga-\ntors have used positively charged nanoparticles such as\ndimercaptosuccinate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (D-\nIONPs) containing the fluorescent dye BODIPY (BP) in\ntheir coat (BP-D-IONPs). These have an overall positive\ncharge and were shown to be preferentially taken up by\noligodendroglial OLN-93 cells and not by neurons\n(Adams et al., 2013). Fluorescent BP-D-IONPs and non-\nfluorescent D-IONPs had similar hydrodynamic diam-\neters and showed identical colloidal stability in\nphysiological media with increasing particle size and posi-\ntivation of the z-potential in presence of serum. Exposure\nof oligodendroglial OLN-93 cells to BP-D-IONPs or D-\nIONPs in the absence of serum increased the cellular iron\ncontent to around 1800 nmol/mg. This was reduced to\nin presence of 10% serum. The accumulation of both D-\nIONPs and BP-D-IONPs in the absence of serum was not\naffected by an endocytosis inhibitor. However, in the\npresence of serum, inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endo-\ncytosis lowered the particle accumulation by around\n50%. Colocalization studies with lysotracker revealed\nthat BP-D-IONP-containing vesicles were directed in\nthe cells to the lysosomal pathway (Luther et al., 2013).\nThe neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the\nslices used in our study were cultured in a synthetic\nserum-free medium, and cell cultures of differentiating\noligodendrocytes were maintained in serum-free\nBottensteins medium so the role of serum was not an\nissue.\nAdams et al. (2013) have also shown that positively\ncharged BP-D-IONP nanoparticles are taken up prefer-\nentially by glia. They used mouse subventricular zone-\nderived neural stem cells (maintained as neurospheres)\nfor magnetofection transfection of proteins at 24 hr\nafter plating. Transfection with Pmax-Green\nFluorescent Protein:magnetic nanoparticle complexes\n(or pmaxGFP only for controls) was performed under\nfour magnetic field conditions (no field, static field and\noscillating fields (1 and 4 Hz)). Transfection efficiency was\nenhanced over twofold by 4 Hz oscillating magnetic fields\nand had no effect on cell viability, cell number, stem cell\nmarker expression, or the differentiation profiles of these\nmagnetofected cultures. However, only transfection of\nthese positively charged particles into glial cells was\nobserved, never neurons.\nWe therefore conclude that the surface charge on cells\nis another critical determinant as to whether endocytosis\nof QDs can take place, in addition to the charge of the\nQD coat. Negatively dipolar CL4 or zwitterionic CL2 will\npreferentially target neurons in culture, whereas neutral\nPEG or positively dipolar CL1 shows a much more dis-\nperse distribution. A positive QD has the inverse affect\nand traffics to oligodendrocytes while showing similar\ndifficulty in associating with neurons.\nA major problem in the treatment of neurodegenera-\ntive diseases is the lack of noninvasive methods of traf-\nficking drugs to the brain. Nanoparticulate drug delivery\noffers the possibility of overcoming this problem through\ncombination with a cell-penetrating peptide, better drug\ntargeting, reduced toxicity, and improved therapeutic\nefficacy. The tight junctions of the blood\u00adbrain barrier\ncause a much higher transendothelial electrical resistance\nthan those of other tissues, which makes intercellular\nspace tighter and less permeable for aqueous-based para-\ncellular transport. However, the barrier also contains spe-\ncific enzyme systems, transporters, and protein receptors,\nwhich may turn out to be the key to bypassing it.\n"
