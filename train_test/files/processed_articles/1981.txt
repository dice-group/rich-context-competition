Higher prevalence ratios for these complications at lower eGFR levels were also present at\nyounger ages.

In the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\n(1). Importantly, for older adults, reduced eGFR has\nbeen shown to be associated with higher rates of\nmortality, cardiovascular disease, and geriatric con-\nditions such as functional decline, frailty, and cog-\nnitive impairment (2\u00ad6).\nDespite these data, some have suggested that re-\nduced eGFR levels among older adults may not reflect\nthe presence of kidney disease, but instead may be a\nnormal age-related decline in GFR (7). Along these\nlines, age-specific cut points for staging CKD in the\nNational Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Qual-\nity Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines have been pro-\nposed (8). However, the use of age-specific cut points\nfor staging CKD remains controversial.\nIn the general population, eGFR levels 60 ml/min\nper 1.73 m2 are associated with a higher prevalence of\nconcurrent CKD-related complications including ane-\nmia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia,\nhyperparathyroidism, and hypertension (9\u00ad12). Deter-\nmining whether an increased prevalence of these com-\nplications is present with reduced eGFR among older\nadults may help define the need for clinical evaluation\nof CKD-related complications in this population (13).\nAccordingly, we evaluated the age-specific association\nbetween eGFR levels with six concurrent complications\nof CKD among participants in the US National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) con-\nStudy Population and Methods\nStudy Participants\nThe NHANES was conducted by the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics and includes cross-sectional,\n*Birmingham/Atlanta\nGeriatric Research,\nEducation, and Clinical\nCenter, Department of\nVeterans Affairs Medical\nCenter, Birmingham,\nAlabama; Division of\nGerontology, Geriatrics\nand Palliative Care,\nDepartment of Medicine,\n\u00a7Division of Nephrology,\nDepartment of Medicine,\nand Department of\nEpidemiology, School of\nPublic Health, University\nof Alabama at\nBirmingham,\nBirmingham, Alabama;\nDivision of Nephrology,\nDepartment of Medicine,\nTufts Medical Center,\nBoston, Massachusetts;\nand \u00b6Departments of\nMedicine and\nEpidemiology, Emory\nUniversity, Atlanta,\nGeorgia\nCorrespondence: Dr. C.\nBarrett Bowling, VAMC\nStreet S, Birmingham,\nbbowling@uab.edu\nArticle\nmultistage, stratified clustered probability samples of the\nUS civilian noninstitutionalized population.

Participants who reported having smoked 100 or\nmore cigarettes during their lifetime were classified as\ncurrent smokers if they reported current smoking in\nNHANES III or smoking \"some days\" or \"most days\" in\nmidway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest with the\nparticipant standing. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a\nprior diagnosis, excluding during pregnancy, use of insu-\nlin or oral hypoglycemic medication, fasting glucose 126\nmg/dl or nonfasting glucose 200 mg/dl. C-reactive pro-\ntein (CRP) was measured using a low-sensitivity assay in\nNHANES III, whereas a high-sensitivity assay was used in\nMeasures of Kidney Function\nAfter recalibration of serum creatinine to standardized\nmeasurements obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Re-\nsearch Laboratory (15), eGFR was estimated using the\nChronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration\n(ACR) was calculated from spot urine albumin and creat-\ninine samples obtained during the medical examination.\nAssessment of Concurrent CKD Complications\nSix concurrent complications of CKD were studied. He-\nmoglobin was measured by Coulter Splus Jr. in NHANES\nAnemia was defined using National Kidney Foundation\nguidelines as hemoglobin 12 g/dl for women and 13.5\ng/dl for men (17). Bicarbonate, phosphate, and serum al-\nbumin were assayed using Hitachi 737 in NHANES III,\ndefined as serum bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Hyperphos-\nphatemia was defined as serum phosphate 4.5 mg/dl.\nHypoalbuminemia was defined as serum albumin 3.5\ng/dl. Serum iPTH was measured at the University of\nWashington, in Seattle, Washington, on an Elecsys 1010\nautoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany),\nusing an electrochemiluminescent process. Hyperparathy-\nroidism was defined as iPTH levels 70 pg/ml. To stan-\ndardize the laboratory values across all of the phases of\nNHANES, the age, gender, and race/ethnicity adjusted\nmean level for hemoglobin, bicarbonate, phosphate, serum\nalbumin, and iPTH for participants 20 to 39 years old\nwithout diabetes and hypertension, eGFR  60 ml/min\ncalculated. Differences from the value for NHANES 2005\nto 2006 were then added to or subtracted from values for\nthe other NHANES phases. Standardized laboratory val-\nues were used for the main analyses, whereas nonstan-\ndardized values were used in a sensitivity analysis. BP was\nmeasured six times in NHANES III and three times in\nBP measurements, hypertension was defined as a systolic\nBP 140 mmHg, diastolic BP 90 mmHg, or self-reported\nuse of antihypertensive medication.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe NHANES study population characteristics and\nprevalence of concurrent CKD complications were cal-\nyears of age). The crude prevalence of concurrent com-\nplications was calculated by eGFR category (60, 45 to\nseparately. Prevalence ratios for concurrent CKD com-\nplications were calculated, adjusting for age, gender,\nrace/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, waist circumference,\ndiabetes mellitus, hypertension (except for the model\nwith hypertension as the outcome), ACR, and CRP. We\nused prevalence ratios to determine the associations be-\ntween eGFR level and concurrent CKD complications\ngiven the cross-sectional data and high frequency of\nevents (18,19). Prevalence ratios are interpreted simi-\nlarly to odds ratios and relative risks. Formal tests for\nmultiplicative interactions were conducted by compar-\ning 2 [astctr] log likelihood in regression models in-\ncluding the full population with and without interaction\nterms (age group [astctr]level of eGFR). Analyses were\nrepeated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\n(MDRD) Study equation to calculate eGFR and using\nnonstandardized laboratory values.\nWithin age grouping, multivariable adjusted prevalence\nratios for each complication were calculated by eGFR mod-\neled as a continuous variable, using restricted quadratic\nm2. Analyses were performed incorporating the NHANES\nsampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates using\nSUDAAN version 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina) and R version 2.9.2 (R\nFoundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\nSampling weights were combined across all survey phases\nobtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method\naccounting for the complex, multistage recruitment of\nNHANES participants.\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nCompared with individuals included in the present analyses,\nthose excluded were more likely to be women (63.5% versus\n50.8% of those included) and non-Hispanic black (17.1% versus\n10.2% of those included) and less likely to be non-Hispanic\nwhite (66.1% versus 74.7% of those included). Differences be-\ntween those excluded versus included were small with respect to\nage (45.7 versus 45.5 years, respectively) and Mexican-American\nOf those included in the current analysis, participants 80\nyears and older were more likely than their counterparts in\nthe younger age groups to be women, non-Hispanic white,\nand nonsmokers (Table 1). Additionally, systolic BP and\nACR levels were higher and eGFR levels were lower in the\nolder age groupings. Older age was also associated with a\nhigher prevalence of anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hy-\npoalbuminemia, and hypertension. The prevalence of aci-\ndosis and hyperphosphatemia was lower at older age.\nAge-Specific Association of eGFR Categories and CKD\nComplications\nThe unadjusted age-specific prevalence of concurrent\nCKD complications by eGFR categories is displayed in\nFigure 1. Among participants 80 years of age the preva-\nlence of anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperpara-\nthyroidism, and hypertension increased progressively at\nlower eGFR categories (Figure 1). The prevalence of hy-\npoalbuminemia increased at lower eGFR categories only\namong participants 70 years old. For participants 70\nyears of age, the unadjusted prevalence of hypoalbumine-\nmia was lower among individuals with an eGFR 45 to 59\nm2 and was highest among those with eGFR 45 ml/min\nAmong participants 80 years of age, compared with\nable adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval\n[CI]) associated with eGFR levels of 45 to 59 ml/min per\nrespectively (Table 2).

In con-\nlower prevalence of hypoalbuminemia than among partic-\nticipants 80 years old, the prevalence ratios for hyperten-\nsion were smaller when compared with younger\nparticipants. Results were similar when analyses were re-\npeated using the MDRD study equation and when non-\nstandardized laboratory values were used (data not\nshown).\nAge-Specific Association of eGFR Modeled as a\nContinuous Variable and CKD Complications\nWith the exception of hypertension for adults 60 to 69\nyears of age, within each age group, increased multivari-\nable adjusted prevalence ratios for each complication were\npresent at lower eGFR modeled as a continuous variable\n(Supplemental Figures 1 to 6). A trend toward higher\nprevalence ratios for anemia and hypoalbuminemia were\nseen at higher eGFR. However, the confidence intervals for\nthese estimates were wide in the older age groupings.\nDiscussion\nIn the current analysis of a large US national cross-\nsectional sample, reduced eGFR was associated with a\nhigher prevalence of several concurrent CKD complica-\ntions regardless of age. When compared with individuals\nlence of concurrent CKD complications at eGFR 45 ml/\nmin per 1.73 m2 was present for anemia, acidosis, hyper-\nphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension.\nAlso, a higher prevalence of these complications was pres-\nadults 80 years of age. Although previous studies have\nestablished the associations of GFR level and the concur-\nrent CKD complications studied herein, the current study\nextends these findings to older adults.\nPrior studies have reported a higher prevalence of ane-\nmia, higher basal PTH levels, as well as a higher preva-\nlence of hyperparathyroidism and hypertension among\nolder adults irrespective of kidney function (20\u00ad23). The\nprevalence of hyperphosphatemia has been reported to be\nless common at older ages (24,25). Similar to these reports,\nin the current study a higher prevalence of anemia, hyper-\nparathyroidism, and hypertension and a lower prevalence\nof hyperphosphatemia was present in the older age\ngroups. Population-based data on chronic metabolic acido-\nsis are limited. In contrast to one previous report (26), in\nthe current study, the prevalence of acidosis decreased\nwith age. Although this could potentially be explained by\nthe more common use of thiazide-type diuretics among\nolder adults, further research into the age-specific preva-\nlence of chronic metabolic acidosis may be warranted.\nDespite overall age-related changes in the prevalence of\nthese complications, at eGFR levels 45 ml/min per 1.73\nm2, a higher prevalence of anemia, hyperphosphatemia,\nacidosis, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension was con-\nsistently present for all age groups. These findings were\nrobust even after age-stratification and multivariable ad-\njustment and thus are unlikely to be explained by the effect\nof age alone. Furthermore, among participants 80 years\nFigure 1. | Unadjusted age-specific prevalence of concurrent complications of chronic kidney disease by estimated GFR (eGFR, ml/min per\nwith a higher prevalence of anemia, hyperparathyroidism,\nand hypertension. Although not statistically significant,\nsimilar trends were seen for acidosis and hyperphos-\nphatemia among participants 80 years. When eGFR was\nmodeled as a continuous variable, with the exception of\nhypertension among participants 60 to 69 years, similar\npatterns of increased prevalence ratios for each complica-\ntion were present at lower eGFR within each age group.\nFor participants 70 years of age there appeared to be a\nstable prevalence of hyperphosphatemia at eGFR levels\nIn the current study, the overall prevalence of hypoalbu-\nminemia was higher in the older age groups, but the asso-\nciation between reduced eGFR and hypoalbuminemia was\nonly seen among participants 70 years. Although serum\nalbumin is an indicator of visceral protein, serum concen-\ntrations are affected by other factors including rate of\nsynthesis, catabolism, and inflammation and may vary by\netiology of kidney disease and severity of proteinuria (27).\nThus, among older participants other factors such as sub-\nclinical inflammation may be more strongly associated\nwith hypoalbuminemia than reduced eGFR (28). In addi-\ntion, individuals with lower levels of creatinine produc-\ntion, and thus higher eGFR, may also have lower serum\nalbumin. This may also explain the high prevalence of\nhypoalbuminemia and anemia at higher eGFR levels when\nmodeled as a continuous variable (29). Prior studies have\nshown adverse outcomes associated with high eGFR levels\nand may reflect low muscle mass (30).\nThe importance of reduced eGFR, especially in the 45 to\ntroversial (7). Prior studies have shown weaker associa-\ntions between eGFR and adverse events and a lower cor-\nrelation between kidney function and evidence of\nnephrosclerosis on renal biopsy among older adults\n(31,32). However, more recent studies clearly demonstrate\nthat moderate reductions in eGFR are associated with ad-\nverse outcomes and a disproportionately higher preva-\nlence of frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional de-\ncline (3,5,6). In meta-analyses conducted by the Chronic\nKidney Disease Prognosis Consortium of general popula-\nwas associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular\nmortality among adults 65 years of age as well as their\npopulation-based Reasons for Geographic and Racial Dif-\nferences in Stroke study, the association between reduced\neGFR and all-cause mortality was evaluated across narrow\n(4). Higher rates of all-cause mortality at eGFR levels of 45\nTable 2.

First, our findings,\ntogether with previous reports of increased mortality and\nother adverse outcomes, do not support using age-specific\ncut points for CKD diagnosis and staging. Second, the\ncurrent findings suggest that clinical evaluation of concur-\nrent CKD complications should be considered for all pa-\ntients with reduced eGFR, regardless of their age. Recog-\nnition of concurrent complications may be especially\nimportant in older adults. Although CKD management in\ngeneral prioritizes slowing the progression of kidney dis-\nease to prevent ESRD, many older adults are unlikely to\nhave progressive disease (35). Among older adults with\nreduced eGFR, the risk of ESRD may be less of a concern\nthan the risk of a hip fracture with subsequent functional\ndecline and nursing home placement. In addition to the\nincreased risk of fracture associated with reduced eGFR,\nrenal osteodystrophy, and acidosis-related bone turnover\n(36), several concurrent CKD complications have been\nshown to be associated with fall risk (37). Although an\nassociation between acidosis and falls has not been directly\nreported, uremic acidosis has also been shown to cause\nmuscle wasting, and muscle weakness predicts falls (38).\nWhether or not treatment of these complications reduces\nfalls remains unknown. Further research is needed to bet-\nter determine how to prioritize outcomes among older\nadults with reduced eGFR. Subsequent clinical trials that\ninclude outcomes other than mortality and ESRD may be\nnecessary.\nThe findings from the present analyses should be inter-\npreted within the context of known and potential limita-\ntions. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow for\nevaluation of temporal associations between reduced\neGFR and CKD complications. Among older adults, it is\npossible that the complications studied may have preceded\nkidney dysfunction and a causal relationship between re-\nduced eGFR and CKD complications cannot be inferred\n(39,40). Data on kidney function were available from a\none-time blood draw and misclassification is possible.\nHowever, misclassification of those with normal kidney\nfunction into the reduced GFR group would likely have\nbiased the results toward the null. There is also a possibil-\nity of survivor bias as reduced eGFR has been shown to be\nassociated with increased mortality (30). The current anal-\nysis was limited to community-dwelling adults and may\nnot reflect the experience of older adults residing in nurs-\ning homes. Associations of eGFR and some concurrent\ncomplications, as well as interactions may not have been\nstatistically significant because of the low numbers of cases\nin certain age strata, rather than the absence of true asso-\nciations. Despite this limitation, the patterns between\nlower eGFR and a higher prevalence of CKD complications\nwere similar in magnitude within each age strata. Further-\nmore, the low numbers did not allow us to use a more\nrestricted reference group, which may be more appropriate\nwhen examining associations with estimated GFR from\ncreatinine, especially in the elderly.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, in a large, nationally representative sam-\nple of US adults, reduced eGFR was associated with a\nhigher prevalence of anemia, acidosis, hyperphos-\nphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension at all\nages, even among participants 80 years of age. These\nfindings suggest that clinical evaluation of concurrent CKD\ncomplications should be considered for all patients with\nreduced eGFR, regardless of age.\n"
