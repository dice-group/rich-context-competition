Major depression is a complex and heterogeneous disorder\nwith a highly variable course. Lifetime prevalence rates vary significantly by age and sex, with\nyoung adults and females having higher rates of depression than males and older adults [2\u00ad4].\nStressful life events (SLE) are one of the most consistently documented exposures among\nthose with depression [5\u00ad8]. Stressful events can include, but are not limited to, unemploy-\nment, acute or significant health problems, unexpected or persistent financial hardship, and\nrelationship problems. While these are common experiences, not everyone who experiences\nthem becomes depressed. Although the nature, kind, and timing of stressful life events have\nbeen implicated as sources of variability in the relationship between depression and SLEs, so\ntoo have biological factors such as serotonergic functioning [9, 10].\nThe neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized in the brain by a small number of\nneuronal fibers with profuse projections throughout the brain, spinal cord and nervous system\n[10]. Because of this wide distribution, it has been implicated in a variety of mental and physi-\ncal disorders [11\u00ad13]. Through removal of the 5-HT molecule at the synapse, the serotonin\ntransporter (5-HTT) plays an important role in determining the extent and duration of seroto-\nnergic signaling. An insertion/deletion polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter region of\nthe 5-HTT gene has been implicated as a source of variation in 5-HTT gene transcription rates\nsuch that the short (S) allele is less transcriptionally efficient than the long (L) allele [14, 15]. In\n2003, Caspi et al [16] examined the role that 5HTTLPR polymorphism has in the relationship\nbetween SLEs and depression finding that carriers of one or more S-alleles were more likely to\ndevelop depression in the context of more SLE's than those with two L-alleles.\nSince that landmark study [16], there have been numerous replication attempts and three\nmeta-analyses [17\u00ad24]. Differences in the conceptualization of stressful life events, depression,\nand their quantification have likely contributed to a literature that has not provided any defini-\ntive evidence for or against the original hypothesis. Small sample sizes, low statistical power,\nand an inconsistent preferred mode of examining the hypothesized interaction have also con-\ntributed to mixed findings [25], leaving some to contend that there have been few direct repli-\ncation attempts of the original hypothesis [20, 21]. Here, we report findings from a study of the\n5HTTLPR, stressful life events, and depression using an approach as close to an a priori direct\nreplication as we could achieve in a large prospective nationally representative sample. Our\nfirst test examined the hypothesis that carriers of one or more S-alleles would be more sensitive\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\nCompeting Interests: Redford Williams holds a U.S.\npatent on 5HTTLPR L allele as a risk marker for CVD\nin persons exposed to chronic stress.

In a post-hoc manner and similar to Caspi et al\n[16], we examined the role of the 5HTTLPR in moderating the impact of stressful life events on\nsuicide ideation and moderating the impact of childhood maltreatment on self-reported diag-\nnosed depression. Based on prior published findings since Caspi et al [16] showing that the\nstress-moderating effects of the 5HTTLPR may differ between males and females [21, 26\u00ad31],\nwe also examined sex as a moderator of stressful life events x 5HTTLPR effects on depression\nand suicidal ideation in post-hoc analyses.\nMethods\nSubjects\nAdd Health is a nationally representative, probability-based survey of adolescents in the United\ndetailed description of the study design and the sampling strategy utilized in Add Health is\navailable elsewhere [32,33]. At Wave III, 52.8% of the sample was male and the mean age was\nreported Black, and 9.9% either Asian or Native American. The participation rate was 77%\n[32]. Our analysis sample for the current study included only White males and females between\ndata to replicate Caspi et al [16] and avoid population stratification (n = 4724). Written\ninformed consent was obtained at Wave III and protocols approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Institutional Review Board at\nthe University of Colorado Boulder approved the current study.\nAssessment\nStressful life events. Life events captured five domains of experiences: health, housing,\nemployment, finance and relationships. Health-related events included hospitalization, violent\ninjuries, frequency of emergency room visits, and being diagnosed with cancer. Housing-\nrelated events included residency changes (local, national), homelessness, shelter use, and\nwhether the respondent had been evicted. Employment-related events included being unem-\nployed, seeking job assistance, or receiving supplemental income. Finance-related events\nincluded being unable to pay for utilities, rent or mortgage; needing medical or dental help but\nbeing unable to pay for it, or having utility service cutoff. Relationship-related events included\nhaving experienced a violent relationship, divorce, or the breakup of a cohabitation living\narrangement. A total of 21 items was used to create our stressful life events scale (SLE). For\nthese five domains, 22.2% of the analysis sample reported having health related problems and\n39.3% reported having employment related problems. A total of 34.4% reported having finan-\ncial difficulties, 35.3% reported having housing problems, and 35.4% reported having problems\nin a significant relationship. S1 Table provides a comparison of the measured stressful life\nevents in the current study and those by Caspi et al [16].\nFollowing the original report by Caspi et al [16], if any item was endorsed within a domain,\nthe respondent was given a score of 1 for that domain. Scores were then summed across all\ndomains to produce a total number of stressful life events. Scores on this summed scale could\nDepression, suicide ideation, and childhood maltreatment. For our primary analysis,\ndepression was assessed using responses from two questions. First, respondents were asked if\nthey \"have been diagnosed with depression.\" Second, whether they \"have taken prescription\nmedication for depression or stress.\" Responses were coded as yes or no (1/0) and yielded a cate-\ngorical measure of depression. We felt this measure came closer to the clinical indicator of\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\ndepression Caspi and colleagues [16] used. However, we also created a depressive symptom\nscale for post-hoc analysis using past-seven day depression symptoms, as assessed on the nine-\nitem revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [34]. Symptom\nendorsements were summed into a quantitative scale and ranged between 0 and 27.\nSuicide ideation was assessed using two questions. First, \"during the past 12 months, had\nyou ever seriously thought about committing suicide\" and \"during the past 12 months, how\nmany times have you actually attempted suicide.\" Among respondents, 259 [5.5%] reported\nthey had thought about committing suicide during the past year and 20.8% (n = 66) of those\nreported having attempted suicide. Rates of suicide ideation did not differ between males and\nMaltreatment prior to the age of 12 was assessed using six questions. During the Wave III\ninterview, participants were asked \"how often had your parents or other adult-caregivers left\nyou home alone\", \"how often had your parents or other adult care-givers not taken care of your\nbasic needs\", \"how often had your parent or other adult care-givers slapped, hit, or kicked you\",\n\"how often had one of your parents or other adult care-givers touched you in a sexual way, forced\nyou to touch him or her in a sexual way\", \"how often had Social Services investigated how you\nwere taken care of or tried to take you out of your living situation\". Affirmative responses were\ncoded as `1' and `0' otherwise. Responses were summed across all items and resulted in a scale\nthat ranged from 0 to 6. Similar to Caspi et al (16) scores of 2 or more were collapsed and indi-\ncated `severe maltreatment.'\nGenotyping. The 43 base-pair insertion/deletion polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the 5' reg-\nulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; 5HTT) and the A/G single nucleo-\ntide polymorphism (SNP) rs25331 in the long repeat unit of the 5HTTLPR was characterized\nfrom genomic DNA collected and isolated using the Oragene system (DNAgenotek, Kanata,\ninformation is provided in S1 Text.\nStatistical analysis. Logistic regression models predicting depression and suicidality were\nas follows: depression = b0 + b1(sex) + b2(5HTTLPR) + b3(SLE) + b4(5HTTLPRxSLE), where b0\nis the intercept, b1 is the regression coefficient associated with the effect of sex (coded as\n0 = male, 1 = female), b2 is the regression coefficient associated with the influence of serotonin\ntransporter genotype status (coded as 0 = s/s, 1 = s/l, 2 = l/l in order to reflect the number of\n\"long\" alleles), b3 is the regression coefficient associated with the influence of stressful life events\nassociated with the interaction effect and is the product of 5HTTLPR genotype status and SLE.\nA p-value of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance for b4 in our primary analysis.\nAnalyses were run for two genotype classifications: 5HTTLPR and 5HTTLPR + rs25531.\nBecause the study results did not differ between the two genotype classifications, we present\nfindings from the analyses using the 5HTTLPR + rs25531 SNP classification (designated as:\n5HTTLPR'). All analyses were conducted using the survey command in STATA (Version 12)\nand took into account the sampling design of Add Health. The independent (stressful life\nevents, childhood maltreatment, 5HTTLPR genotype) and dependent (depression, suicide ide-\nation) variables were developed independently, and the analyses were planned and reviewed by\na panel of six investigators prior to testing in order to eliminate the possibility of `fishing expe-\nditions' in the data. For quantitative outcomes (CES-D depression symptomology scale), we\nused linear regression. Because our study was designed to test the gene-environment interac-\ntion hypothesis by Caspi et al [16], we corrected the statistical significance of all interaction\nanalyses following our primary test using the conservative Bonferroni method. This resulted in\na significance value for post-hoc tests of p = 0.005.\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\nResults\nWe examined the gene-environment hypothesis in a sample of white young adult males and\nof the short allele (l/l genotype).

There were no significant differences in\n5HTTLPR polymorphism was not associated with exposure to stressful life events.\nThirteen percent (n = 626) of our analysis sample self-reported being diagnosed with depres-\nsion between 22 and 26 years of age.

Sample sizes for our primary and post-hoc analyses are provided in S2 Table. For both\nmales and females, as the number of life events increased the risk for depression also increased.\nPrevalence estimates for depression were similar across 5HTTLPR genotype status, though\ndepression risk appeared to increase more steeply for males who have one or more of the short\nalleles (Fig 1a and 1b, S3 Table). We interpreted this pattern of results as providing preliminary\nsupport for the originally hypothesized gene-environment interaction [16]. Formal tests of this\npossibility, accounting for the sampling design of Add Health, revealed a main effect for SLEs\ntion finding revealed that while stressful life events were a risk factor for depression for both\nsexes, the role of the 5HTTLPR and its interaction with stressful life events approached signifi-\nof whether the interaction terms differed between the sexes revealed a non-significant sex-\nPost-hoc analyses\nFollowing on the primary hypothesis that the 5HTTLPR moderated the relationship between\nstressful life events and depression, Caspi et al [16] investigated similar interaction hypotheses\nfor depression related dependent and independent variables (suicide ideation and childhood\nmaltreatment, respectively). In our sample of males and females, prevalence rates of suicidal\nideation were highest among those who had experienced greater numbers of stressful life events\n(S4 Table) regardless of sex. Across 5HTTLPR genotype, however, the effect of stressful life\nevents differed as a function of sex. For females carrying one or more of the S-alleles, preva-\nlence of suicide ideation increased with an increasing number of stressful life events whereas\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\nFig 1.

For\nboth sexes, neither 5HTTLPR genotype, nor its interaction with stressful life events was signifi-\ncantly associated with suicidal ideation (Table 1, Fig 1c and 1d), although this relationship\napproached significance for females (S5 Table). A formal test of whether the interaction terms\ndiffered between the sexes revealed a non-significant sex-5HTTLPR-stressful life events inter-\nlarly, a test of the differential effect of the 5HTTLPR as a function of sex that also controlled for\ncorrecting for multiple testing. For childhood maltreatment, neither the 5HTTLPR genotype\nnor its interaction with maltreatment significantly predicted depression in this young adult\nsample (Table 1, Fig 1e and 1f, S6 Table).\nFinally, we examined a quantitative depression score based on CES-D symptom counts (z-\nscored). Although stressful life events predicted CES-D depression symptoms [b = 0.18,\nDiscussion\nIn the current report we examined the hypothesis that 5HTTLPR genotype moderated the rela-\ntionship between experiences of stressful life events and depression during young adulthood.\nWe sought to test this hypothesis by adopting a direct replication strategy that included an\nTable 1.

Results supported the hypothesis that the 5HTTLPR plays\na role in moderating the impact of SLEs on depression status, though at a statistically signifi-\ncant level only in males and using a self-reported `ever' diagnosis of depression. We did not\nfind support for a similar role of the 5HTTLPR in the relationship between stressful life events\nand suicide ideation; however, post-hoc analyses were suggestive of a stress-moderating effect\nof the 5HTTLPR on suicide ideation that differed between males and females. Further, while\nhaving experienced maltreatment as a child was a significant risk for depression, we did not\ndetect a significant maltreatment-5HTTLPR interaction in these data as had been reported pre-\nviously [16]. Post-hoc considerations revealed, that in the context of increasing numbers of\nstressful life events, common variation in 5HTTLPR genotype could contribute to differences\nin mental health problems between the sexes.\nIn the absence of stressful life events, we found rates of depression that were similar across\ngenotype status. This indicated that at low levels of stress, 5HTTLPR genotype was not related\nto the risk for depression. As the number of stressful life events increased, the prevalence of\ndepression also increased among those carrying one or more copies of the short allele. This\nrelationship between stressful life events and depression was most evident at the extremes of\nthe distribution where sample sizes were smaller, though still larger than the original study\n[16]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of depression among those with many stressful life\nevents was significant only for males. Finally, as new genetic variation in the 5HTTLPR had\nbeen identified since the original study [16] we included SNP rs25531 in our analyses. Doing\nso negligibly changed the observed relationships as compared with results including just the\n5HTTLPR. This is consistent for a SNP with a low minor allele frequency (MAF) among Cau-\ncasians [> 5%; 35] such that the number of participants reclassified on the basis of functional\nbinning of the 5HTTLPR was limited. This, however, would not be the expectation in geneti-\ncally diverse samples with greater MAFs.\nGene-environment interaction studies offer an opportunity to understand biological mecha-\nnisms important for predicting risk and evaluating changes in modifiable environments [37\u00ad\n39]. Further, these kinds of studies can help to identify environmental effects that act primarily\nin genetically susceptible individuals. There have been many attempts at replicating the obser-\nvation that the 5HTTLPR S-allele moderates the relationship between depression and stressful\nlife events [16\u00ad20, 25], often with conflicting results. Similarly, findings from meta-analyses\n[20\u00ad22] have also been inconclusive, with some reporting no effect and others full support for\nthe original hypothesis. Against this literature, our results agree with the notion that the inter-\naction effect of 5HTTLPR genotype and stressful life events on depression is marginal and that\nthe effect size is smaller than that originally reported. Further, similar to one prior study [19],\nour results suggest that it is important to capture the specific forms of life stress originally set\nforth in Caspi and colleagues [16] original report [40, 41].\nSuicide ideation is often reported among patients with depression and those experiencing\nacute stress [42]. Because of the magnitude of impact suicide has on society there is a great\ninterest in understanding its biological and social causes. To this end, our results suggest the\npossibility that in the presence of an increasing number of stressful life events different\n5HTTLPR alleles may confer a susceptibility to suicide ideation that differs between males and\nfemales. If true, this finding would extend Caspi et al [16] and support previous studies show-\ning sex moderation of the 5HTTLPR effects on depression [28, 30, 31] and negative affect [43],\nand may offer one explanation for the heterogeneity in association tests of the 5HTTLPR and\nsuicide behaviors that implicate both the L-allele and S-allele [44, 45]. If replicated, these results\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\nwould aid efforts to better identify those at risk for suicide and implicate environments and\nsocial experiences that may be modified to reduce such risk.\nSimilar to other replication attempts, our study is not without limitations. First, we were\nunable to establish a temporal relationship between the experience of a stressful life event and\nthe onset or occurrence of depression. As such, some of the measured stressful life events may\nhave occurred after the onset of depression, which may have the effect of biasing our interac-\ntion parameter [46]. Similarly, stressful life events examined here were retrospectively reported\nas having occurred sometime within the preceding five-years while depression diagnosis could\nhave occurred at any point before the Wave III interview. Stressors most salient to depression\nare those which are acute, major, occurred within the previous six-months, and are participant\nfocused [40, 41]. Although our stressful life events measure was very similar to that specified by\nCaspi and colleagues (16), we were not able to include each of its aspects. Second, our coding of\nSLEs, though exactly the same as Caspi et al [16], limits the potential importance of experienc-\ning multiple types of SLE's within one domain or multiple occurrences of the same event within\na domain. This has, for example, the consequence of scoring someone who has experienced\nmultiple forms of violence over years in an intimate relationship but no other SLE the same as\na person who moved states for a job and no other SLE's. Said differently, scoring SLE domains\nas we have limits the impact of the severity of an experience. A coding scheme that accounts\nfor this by possibly weighting subsequent experiences may provide a better allocation of sub-\njects to SLE groups and reduce sample heterogeneity among those experiencing fewer SLE's.\nThird, though we were able to detect a significant interaction between the 5HTTLPR and\nstressful life events in a much larger sample than examined by Caspi and colleagues [16], the\neffect size was less robust. One potential reason for this could be differences between interview\nand self-reported adversity. Previous meta-analyses [45] and systematic reviews [39] have sug-\ngested that the use of interviews and/or multiple informants may afford better sensitivity for\nthe detection of gene-environment (GxE) interactions. Fourth, reports of childhood maltreat-\nment were retrospective and therefore may have been influenced by distorted memories or\nrecall bias [47\u00ad50]. Lastly, for replication purposes [16] we restricted our sample to include\nonly Caucasians and as such are unable to establish the extent to which findings would be simi-\nlar in other race/ethnic populations. Given race differences in the prevalence of depression [4,\ndiverse ethnic samples should be a priority for future research.\nIn conclusion, by committee, we set out to examine the hypothesis that SLEs moderated the\nimpact of the 5HTTLPR S-allele on depression among young adults. To do so, we attempted to\napproximate as closely as possible the measures originally examined by Caspi et al [16] in a\nlarge well-characterized sample followed longitudinally since adolescence. Towards this end, a\nnotable advantage of the Add Health sample is the extensive environmental measures com-\nbined with the unique availability of simple sequence data [34]; in particular rs25531 and the\n5HTTLPR. Although these types of samples provide strong statistical power for hypothesis\ntesting, they may not always assess each phenotype of interest in as an extensive of a manner as\nsmaller samples designed to test circumscribed hypotheses. As noted above, we could not\napproximate every phenotype as originally [16] put forward. Despite this, our results utilizing a\nhighly similar measure of SLEs, a clinically orientated depression measure, a more transcrip-\ntionally accurate genotype classification, and the same analytic approach, we obtained evi-\ndence, albeit not unequivocal, that supported the original finding reported by Caspi et al [16].\nSpecially, young adults with lower 5HTT transcription and greater numbers of SLEs reported\nhigher rates of depression as compared with those carrying the L-allele and experiencing fewer\nSLEs. Although larger sample sizes are desirable to further explore the questions asked here, it\nis important to do so in samples with extensive environmental characterization using\nDepression, Stressful Life Events, and the Impact of Variation\nalternative methodologies and strategies that elucidate the connections between sequence vari-\nation, gene regulation, and depression related neural pathophysiology. In this way we can real-\nize the identification of environmental effects that act in susceptible individuals.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
