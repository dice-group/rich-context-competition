That is, they assure the reader that they will not\ncommit what Moore (1903) called the \"naturalistic fallacy\" by jumping from \"is\" to\n\"ought\". They accept the premise, which they believe was advanced by Hume (1739;\n1752), that statements concerning facts and statements concerning values are two\ndifferent types of statement, and that these cannot be related in a meaningful way\nbecause moral values and natural facts are of a different kind.\nPhilosophers in the British analytic tradition such as Flew (1967) have long\nacted as the guardians of this dogma, but more recently philosophers of biology have\nraised their voices in assent. In their Sex and Death: An Introduction to Philosophy\nof Biology, Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) announce on page 4 that the naturalistic\nfallacy is valid and congratulate Kitcher (1994) for demonstrating it decisively.\nMention of the fact/value distinction does not appear again in the book until page 317\nwhere a \"Keep Out!\" sign is draped across it. Generally, philosophers of biology\nevolutionary scientists to do except wisely concur? Examples of concurrence in the\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nscientific literature, popular and not so popular, are ubiquitous and include works as\nPinker (1997), and Ridley (1996). As one might expect, assertion of the fact/value\ndistinction also appears in the work of biologists who are opposed to sociobiology\nsuch as Gould (1999). It is odd that Gould is perfectly willing to hand ethics over to a\nreligious tradition that he rejects in all other contexts of biological inquiry.\nDoes anyone, in fact, disagree with the fact/value distinction? Has anyone\nproposed a philosophically interesting challenge to the received view on the\ncommitting the naturalistic fallacy in the infamous last chapter of Sociobiology: the\nNew Synthesis, in a co-authored paper Ruse and Wilson (1986) proposed to treat the\nstudy of ethics as an applied science and they cast the naturalistic fallacy aside\nwithout further ado. The question is why have the majority of philosophers and\nscientists continued to follow the status quo instead of the Ruse-Wilson lead? I think\npart of the answer is because not much of a philosophical argument was constructed\nin defense of the move from ethical objectivism to naturalism. Most of the article is\ndevoted to describing advances in behavioral biology and psychology and arguing\nthat moral psychology was now ripe for treatment. We might expect someone like\nWilson to forge ahead beyond the fact/value \"Keep Out!\" sign, but why would Ruse\ncross that prohibited Rubicon with him? I think part of the answer is that Ruse, even\nin his 1979 book, correctly understood that Hume's intent was to argue in favor of a\nnaturalistic moral psychology. What was different in the 1986 paper with Wilson\nwas that Ruse now understood that the fact/value distinction was not valid and that it\nis possible to treat moral values as natural facts. But in 1999, Ruse once again\ncriticized Wilson (1992) for committing the `naturalistic fallacy' (Ruse, 1999, p.\nTeehan and DiCarlo (2004) advance the curious thesis that there are also\nmetaphysical facts but that Moore also raised a fundamental objection to treating\nthese as identifiable with the `good', and they thus propose to recognize an additional\nfallacy that they call the `metaphysical fallacy'. After accepting the existence of both\nnatural and metaphysical fallacies, Teehan and DiCarlo go on with the project of\ndeveloping a scientific approach to ethics. I intend to argue, that even if Moore\nbelieves there exist metaphysical entities that are not identifiable with the `good', it is\nnevertheless the case that Moore believes there is one metaphysical entity that does\nqualify as the `good'. The issue then is that Moore conceives of the `good' as a non-\nnatural, hence metaphysical object. I believe that once evolutionists understand that\nproponents of the naturalistic fallacy are committed to ethical objectivism \u00ad which\nentails that values are supernatural facts, they will have no more fear of the ethical\nrelevance of brute facts than they fear that creationists will successfully argue that the\nuniverse was created by divine providence.\nIn this paper, I intend to defend the existence of what Casebeer (2003) has\npreviously referred to as `The anti-naturalistic fallacy'.1 Stated simply, we must\nrecognize that while not all natural facts are relevant to ethical or moral discourse, all\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nfacts that are relevant to ethical and moral discourse will nonetheless be natural facts.\nTo hold that values are non-natural facts is to commit the anti-naturalistic fallacy.\nThe relevance of this to the scientific and philosophical analysis of the evolutionary\nfoundation of moral psychology will be that people can stop contradicting\nthemselves. Although it is standard to state that one is not going to commit the\nnaturalistic fallacy, it is also standard to turn right around and commit it \u00ad that is, if\nyou accept the terms we've been offered at face value. For example, having stated\nthat he will not commit the naturalistic fallacy, Ridley (1996) concludes his book\n(rashly he admits) by arguing for the dismantling of the British welfare state because\nit promotes free-riding among the populace. He argues that virtuous behavior will be\nelicited by following free market principles. Similarly, Singer (2002) based on\nacceptance of the same biological and psychological facts argues a contrary position\nthat entreats us to treat the whole wide world, that is to say those individuals beyond\nour immediate kin--whom he grants us some measure of favoritism, to full reciprocal\naltruism. On the premises that they explicitly accept regarding the fact/value\ndistinction, they ought not to have done that. Instead, even though I think that both\npositions might be wanting, the point is not to chastise them for going beyond facts\nto values, but to realize that moral discourse cannot and should not avoid taking into\naccount relevant facts of nature despite the fact that the `facts' can be interpreted in\nmultiple or contradictory ways\nThe first step towards realizing a fearless evolutionary moral psychology is to\nreturn to Hume and reconsider his stratagem for deriving \"ought\" from \"is\".\nFrom Hume's `Law' to Hume's Stratagem\nThe passage in Hume that is typically cited to validate the fact/value\ndisjunction is to be found in the first chapter of the third volume of his work, A\nTreatise on Human Nature. It is sometimes referred to as Hume's \"Law\" (e.g.\nI am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of\npropositions, is and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not\nconnected with an ought or ought not . . . . For as this ought or ought\nnot expresses some new relation of affirmation, it is necessary that it\nshould be observed and explained; at the same time a reason should be\ngiven, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation\ncan be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it\n(Hume quoted in Flew, p. 38).\nHume is not saying here that \"ought\" cannot be derived from \"is\"; rather, he is\nsaying that an argument needs to be given that would justify the connection.\nMoreover, the task that Hume sets himself is to show exactly how this can be done.\nHume's stratagem is to develop a science of morals that unequivocally grounds moral\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nvalues in the facts of human nature. Hume holds that standards of morality are not\nabstract in the sense that they could exist independently of the facts of human nature.\nIndeed, such standards are wholly dependent upon it.\nEven in his own day, Hume was frustrated that people misunderstood his\nintent, and in 1752 he published an additional work entitled, An Enquiry Concerning\nthe Principles of Morals, in which he attempted to clarify his purpose.\nThe hypothesis that we embrace is plain. It maintains that morality is\ndetermined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental\naction or quality give to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of\nThus, Hume argues that moral values do not exist objectively, as things in\nthemselves, but are instead a projection of subjective psychological standards. By\n\"subjective\", Hume means that they are features, or \"facts\" if you will, of human\npsychology.\nIt was with this aim in mind that Hume and his close friend Adam Smith set\nout to develop a theory of moral sentiments. And it was Smith's treatise on the\nsubject that Darwin specifically consulted when he addressed his attention to\nexplaining the evolution of the moral sense. The rudiments of the Hume-Smith\ntheory devolve on the crucial role of sympathy. Sympathy is defined as the fellow-\nfeeling we have with any passion we encounter in others (Smith, p. 49). We either\napprove or disapprove of another person's conduct depending on whether or not we\nfind ourselves in sympathy with his or her motives. We judge the merit of an action\nin accordance with whether or not we, as the recipient of the action, would likely feel\ngratitude or resentment were we in that person's place. Smith and Hume both argue\nthat we have within us an impartial spectator whose sympathies or antipathies are\naroused in accordance with what the appropriate and natural response to a given\nsituation would be. Thus, we are endowed with internal and innate moral\nsensibilities.\nAlthough Hume's intent with respect to the is/ought issue is well understood\nby some contemporary moral philosophers, among them ethical naturalists such as\nphilosophers that remain confused about the issue, including some that believe ethics\nexample, Casebeer claims that Hume prohibited any and all derivations of `ought'\nlines. Casebeer believes that Hume specifically designed the `Law' to counter those\nwho assume that it is valid to move deductively from `is' to `ought'. Casebeer argues\nthat Hume's `emotivist' position leads him to view morals as passions, rather than\nreasons, and that since reasons have no explanatory power in themselves, no rational\ndeductions are possible. Thus, any and all derivations of `ought' from `is' are invalid.\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nIn order to naturalize ethics, Casebeer relies on Quine's (1953) critique of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction. In `Two dogmas of Empiricism', Quine strove to\ndemonstrate that all analytic definitions are factual at base, including the laws of logic\nitself, and that scientific theories formulated as deductive laws were really just well\nsupported generalizations from facts. Although, it is true that Quine's argument can\nbe interpreted to support the view that ethical facts are facts like any other natural\nfact, it is unlikely that Hume's `law' was designed to preserve the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction. If anything, Hume's commitment to the factual nature of moral facts as\npsychological facts about our species, demonstrates that he anticipated the hard-nosed\nempiricism that Quine championed several hundred years later. Based on the clearly\nstated aims of his Enquiry I would argue that Hume believed that `oughts' were\nnothing but well supported psychological generalizations based on the sort of `ises'\ndescribed above.\nIf ethical facts are facts about human nature, how did they get there? Were\nthey provided by Divine Providence or did they evolve through natural selection?\nMackie (1977) suggests that if we reject the former, then the best candidate that\nremains is the latter. Towards this goal, Casebeer himself enlists the evolutionary\nethics of John Dewey (1922) to argue the same position. What did Casebeer find in\nDewey that points us in the right direction? This:\na morals based on study of human nature instead of upon disregard for\nit would find the facts of man continuous with those of the rest of\nnature and would thereby ally ethics with physics and biology (Dewey\nIt is Darwin's theory of evolution that Casebeer claims inspired Dewey's\nattempt to create a system of evolutionary ethics (Casebeer, p. 29). Before we\nattempt to evaluate how an evolutionist might commit the naturalistic fallacy, let us\nbriefly survey Darwin's account of the evolution of ethical behavior.\nDarwin's Evolutionary Moral Psychology\nDarwin addressed the evolution of the moral sense in the last three chapters of\nThe Descent of Man (1871). Darwin explicitly discusses Smith's `laws of\nsympathy', the moral sentiments of approbation and disapprobation, and Smith's\n`impartial spectator' which Darwin refers to as an `internal monitor' (pp. 478-481).\nDarwin set himself the task of explaining how these phenomena could evolve by the\nmechanism of natural selection. Let's briefly recapitulate his argument in order to\nensure that we understand how far Darwin thought we could go towards `ought' from\n`is\", and to see whether or not Hume would raise any objections.\nFor Darwin, of central importance in the successful adaptation of any social\nspecies are the `social instincts'.\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nWe can perceive that an instinctive impulse, if it be in any way more\nbeneficial to a species than some other or opposed instinct, would be\nrendered the more potent of the two through natural selection; for the\nindividuals which had it most strongly developed would survive in\nDarwin here slides between the species and the individual as the unit of\nselection. It might be argued that Darwin endorsed what is sometimes referred to as a\n`common fate\" form of group selection. He believed that in many species, including\nours, individual survival depends upon group survival.\nA tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high\ndegree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage and\nsympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice\nthemselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other\ntribes, and this would be natural selection (p. 500).\nDarwin goes on to assert \"that members of the tribe would approve of conduct\nwhich appeared to them to be for the general good, and would reprobate that which\nappeared to be evil\" (p. 500). Hence, Darwin believed that instinctive sympathy and\nthe moral sentiments are evolved behavioral dispositions that help ensure the survival\nof the individual and the group to which the individual belongs. He further speculates\nthat these adaptations date to the early prehistory of our species and apply to modern\nman as well. \"The virtues which must be practiced, at least generally, by rude men, as\nthey may associate in a body, are those which are still recognized as the most\nHume and Smith both concur that human moral sentiments are designed to\nensure the cohesion of society, although Hume places more weight than does Smith\non the role that the sentiment of `benevolence' plays in ensuring the well-being of the\ncommunity (Hume, 1953, p. 14). Smith adduces an additional moral sentiment that\nhe calls `resentment'. Resentment serves the purpose of defending the community\nagainst antisocial acts. Smith claims that unjust (i.e. antisocial) acts inspire the\nsentiments of resentment and disapproval in the `impartial spectator'.\nIn order to enforce the observation of justice, therefore, nature has\nimplanted in the human breast that consciousness of ill desert, those\nterrors of merited punishment, which attend upon its violation, as the\ngreatest safeguards of the association of mankind, to protect the weak,\nto curb the violent, and to chastise the guilty\" (Smith, p. 167).\nThis passage reveals Smith's firm commitment to placing ethics within the\ndomain of human nature theory. What Darwin brings to the table that was\nunavailable to either Smith or Hume, of course, is a theory that can explain the\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nmechanism that made human nature what it is. I would also submit that not only are\nHume, Smith and Darwin describing what humans believe to be good, but that they\nalso believe that the moral sentiments are in fact `good'. If contemporary\nevolutionary scholars are hesitant to take that last step, they obviously cannot cite\nHume's `law' as the obstacle. Perhaps there is some other obstacle to deriving\n`ought\" from \"is\" or that would prevent us from treating values as facts.\nG. E. Moore and the Naturalistic Fallacy\nThe term, \"the Naturalistic Fallacy\", was itself coined by the philosopher G.\nE. Moore in his famous work, Principia Ethica (1903). Although frequently linked to\nHume's injunction about not deriving \"ought\" from \"is\", Moore does not mention\nHume once in that work. What sort of argument then does Moore advance, and does\nit proscribe the sorts of analysis we evolutionists strive to offer?\nMoore argues that \"good\" is \"good\" and not anything else \u00ad just as the color\nyellow is the color yellow and not a desktop or the color red (Moore, pp. 8-10). The\nessential point for Moore is that for \"good\" to be a meaningful expression, the objects\nthat we designate as having the property of \"goodness\" have to be themselves\nseparate from the predicate of goodness. Thus, for example, for \"pleasure\" to be\n\"good\" it is necessary that \"pleasure\" be distinct from \"good\", otherwise the copula\nwould be a meaningless tautology. Moore has no objection to \"saying that `pleasure\nis good' and yet not meaning that `pleasure' is the same thing as `good', that\n`pleasure' means `good' and `good' means `pleasure'\" (Moore, p. 13). In fact, his\npurpose in adducing the `naturalistic fallacy' is simply to prevent this type of\nconflation of two different things into one.\nFar too many philosophers have thought that when they named those\nother properties they were actually defining good; that these\nproperties, in fact, were simply not `other', but absolutely and entirely\nthe same with goodness. This view I propose to call the naturalistic\nfallacy. . . (Moore, p. 10).\nIf that is all Moore is out to demonstrate, then we evolutionists are free to\nhead back to our desks to pursue development of a science of moral psychology. But\ndangers lie just around the corner. Moore does, in fact, make prohibitions against\nethical naturalism that might impede the project of a science of ethics.\nWhat sort of moves is Moore interested in barring? Moore reveals that the\nprincipal target of his criticism is the `evolutionistic ethics' of Herbert Spencer whom\nhe accuses of making two mistakes. First, he claims that Spencer argued that\nsomething was better \u00ad in an ethical sense--simply because it was more evolved.\nAll that the Evolution-Hypothesis tells us is that certain kinds of\nconduct are more evolved than others; and this is, in fact, all that Mr.\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nSpencer has attempted to prove . . . Yet he tells us that one of the\nthings it has proved is that conduct gains ethical sanction in proportion\nas it displays certain characteristics (i.e. as it is more or less evolved). .\n.. It is plain, then, that Mr. Spencer identifies the gaining of ethical\nsanction with the being more evolved (Moore, p. 49).\nNow, this objection devolves on Spencer's mistaken commitment to\nprogressivism. That it is a problem to guard against is a genuine possibility. Ruse\n(1999) argues that Julian Huxley was guilty of it when he suggested that the human\nspecies had evolved to the point where it could exert control over and independence\nfrom nature and that the existence of this accomplishment was in itself good. It was\nthe move from `control and independence exists' to `control and independence is\ngood' that involves Huxley in the Spencerian version of the naturalistic fallacy\naccording to Ruse. Similarly, it is over this type of claim that Ruse felt compelled to\nagain criticize E. O. Wilson. Wilson (1992) argued the biodiversity was itself `good'.\nRuse claims the identification of one with the other here commits the `naturalistic\nOne route out of this apparent difficulty has been proposed by Simon\nBlackburn (1998). Blackburn draws a distinction between `concepts' and\n`properties'. Extending the philosophical insights of Putnam (1983) from\nepistemology to ethics, he argues that two different concepts, say `good' and\n`happiness' might possess identical properties, and if they do, then it would be no\nfallacy to claim that the concept `good' is identical to the concept `happiness'\nindependence' or `biodiversity' as long as one took care to distinguish the properties\nfrom the concepts and as long as one could establish an identity of the properties of\nthe two concepts.\nMoore thus criticizes the idea that because something is natural that it by that\nvery reason, and for that reason alone, is \"good\".\nIt is obvious . . . that we cannot say that everything natural is good . . .\nIf everything natural is equally good, then certainly ethics, as it is\nordinarily understood, disappears: for nothing is more certain, from an\nethical point of view, than that some things are bad and others good. . .\nMoore then goes on a tirade against those who would have us imitate beasts\nand savages or to get down on all fours and run around if it was our natural\ninclination do to so.\nWhat then can evolution tell us in connection with ethics? Moore grants three\nways in which evolutionary analysis might contribute to the understanding of ethics.\nFirst, it might turn out to be the case that the \"more evolved\" trait actually is better in\na moral sense. The criterion of goodness, however, is independent of the\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nevolutionary fact of being more evolved. Second, Moore grants that although being\nmore evolved is not the same thing as being good, being more evolved might be\nconcomitant with that which is good, and therefore being more evolved can be useful\nas a guide by which we can identify that which is good. Third, although evolution\ncannot determine what is good, it might still be useful in determining how much is\npossible for humans to attain and the means by which they can best go about attaining\nit (Moore, p. 55-56). On all three of these possible scenarios, the \"goodness\" of a\nthing is kept separate from any of its other properties.\nEven if we accept the usefulness of Blackburn's referential innovation, I\nwould still locate a second problem that stems from Moore's anti-naturalism. To\nkeep properties of a concept distinct is one thing, but to place the concept itself\noutside the realm of nature is another. Moore characterizes \"good\" as an indefinable,\nnon-natural property that objects possess that is independent of the natural properties\nthat they possess (Moore, pp. 8-10). The soft underbelly of his larger metaphysical\nposition is exposed. He here commits the anti-naturalistic fallacy. Although we can\nreadily agree that not all behavior is good simply because it has evolved, it would be\na mistake to assume that because some behavior is behavior that we deem \"good\",\nthat it is therefore not natural (i.e. not a product or property of the evolution of our\nspecies). By placing the \"good\" in the realm of the non-natural, Moore demonstrates\nhis commitment to the supernatural realm.3 Moore's perspective can be characterized\nas a variant of ethical objectivism. This is the view that ethical objects are real things\nin and of themselves, separate from things that exist in nature. Although, this type of\nmetaphysical commitment will appeal to those who believe in divine providence,\nevolutionary biologists might be expected to reject it out of hand with no further\nconsideration \u00ad just as they would reject creationist \"science\".\nAlternatives to Ethical Objectivism\nTwo highly promising alternatives of ethical objectivism are moral realism\nand moral skepticism. Although proponents of both schools frequently claim Hume\nas an ancestor, and both usually claim to be hospitable to ethical naturalism, one\nschool argues that moral facts are real while the other argues that moral facts are not.\nLet's begin with moral realism and the prospect that moral facts really do exist. (It\nshould be noted at the outset that different kinds of moral realist exist and they differ\nconsiderably as to what they regard as a real moral fact.) David Brink offers a quick\nsynopsis of the realist position:\nMoral realism is roughly the view that there are moral facts and true\nmoral claims whose existence and nature are independent of our\nbeliefs about what is right and wrong.(1989. p. 7)\nAlthough Brink believes that ethical naturalism is one of the possible forms\nthat moral realism can take \u00ad and although he suggests that it is the most plausible\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\none, he makes it clear that it is not the only one. In fact the other versions of possible\nrealism turn out to be Moore's type of non-natural ethical objectivism and outright\nreligious/ supernatural views (Brink, 1989, p. 22). Hence the emphasis is on the\nclaim that moral facts are real more than on their natural status. Brink opposes\nrealism of any sort to the skeptical position that doubts the true existence of real\nmoral facts. This position places the sort of realist Brink is between a rock and a hard\nplace. On the one hand, he holds that being committed to metaphysical, or scientific,\nrealism entails that you be committed to moral realism because moral facts are part of\nthe same universe as non-moral facts. On the other hand, Brink admits that even if\nmoral realism is inconsistent with physical realism, it should be retained because it is\n\"a small price to pay to preserve our existing normative practices and beliefs\" (p.\nBrink, 1989, p.173). This easy capitulation to the violation of nature's laws makes it\nclear that Brink holds an a priori view of the moral universe and is a super-naturalist\n(i.e. an ethical objectivist) in disguise.\nEthical objectivism has been criticized by moral skeptics such Mackie (1977)\non two grounds. The first is called the argument from relativity; the second is called\nthe argument from queerness (Mackie, pp. 32-42). Although the multiplicity of\nmoral systems found around the world presents a challenge to evolutionary\napproaches as well, the second argument is more pertinent to our purposes here, and\nthe evolutionist wins a decisive victory. To put the point in a nutshell: If ethical\nvalues are not part of nature, then they are queer things understood by very queer\nmeans, including the queerest of non-natural sensibilities. Although Brink supplies\nan argument against Mackie's argument from queerness, the argument is flawed by\nBrink's attempt to accommodate supernatural reality within metaphysical (i.e.\nscientific) realism. What Brink actually does is to erase the distinction between the\ntwo. The result is Brink informs us that we can use our natural sensibilities to\nperceive both natural facts and non-natural, but nonetheless real, moral facts.4 We\nshould ask what happens, however, when the moral universe and the physical\nuniverse do not agree within the sphere of one's cognitive system? One does not\nhave to be a moral skeptic to wonder if violations of physical realism by instances of\nnon-compliant moral realism are highly suspect. Moreover, when push comes to\nshove, non-compliant moral cognition is likely to do some special metaphysical\npleading to retain the status of its moral claims \u00ad a move Brink indicates he would\nIf we reject the view that ethical values are objective non-natural facts\nexisting in a transcendental realm, the alternative is to view them as subjective facts\nof our evolved psychology. One view that operates from this premise is called moral\nskepticism but is also sometimes referred to as subjectivism (Mackie, 1977, pp. 15-\n17.) As noted above, Mackie reminds us that the most likely candidate to explain our\nmoral sensibilities once we have discarded non-natural or supernatural alternatives is\nDarwinism. Thus, the skeptic accepts the proposition that the moral sense is evolved.\nIt is a part of nature, but moral `facts' are facts of human nature. And as such, there is\nno real (i.e. external objective) foundation for normative ethics (cf. Ruse, 1999, p.\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\n217). In this later paper, Ruse here clarifies his position on Hume and the `is/ought'\nproblem. Ruse reveals that he believes Hume denied that `ought' could be derived\nfrom `is' because no `ought' is possible. He states that what he said in 1986 was true,\nskeptical view, the objective reality of meta-ethics is obviated once moral facts have\nbeen turned into facts of psychology. This subjectivist stance also enables Ruse to\nclarify his position on the naturalistic fallacy. Although he castigates Huxley for\ncommitting the naturalistic fallacy by arguing from `is' to ought' (see page 13 above),\nhe absolves Gaylord Simpson because the latter approached ethics from an acceptable\npsychological stance.\nThe undermining of the meta-ethical foundation is unacceptable to realists of\nthe Brink sort because Brink commits moral realism to the view that moral facts exist\nindependently of our beliefs and other psychological states (Brink, 1989, p. 7). Are\nthere forms of moral realism that comply with the stricture that moral facts be limited\nto facts about the nature of the human species?4 I have previously noted that Gibbard\nmoral facts are nothing but facts about the sentiments expressed by human beings in\nregard to the conduct of other people. Blackburn identifies himself as an ethical, or\nCornell, realist whom he defines as believing that \"ethical predicates refer to real\nnatural properties of things\" (Blackburn 1998, p. 119). The first thing one should\nnote is that he did not include supernatural properties or non-natural properties on his\nlist of moral realities as distinct from Brink.\nInitially, Blackburn had defined his position as being `projectivist' but he later\nadopted Gibbard's `expressivist' nomenclature as being better suited to describe their\nform of ethical realism. The `expressivist' views ethical knowledge more as a matter\nof knowing how to behave rather than knowing that something x is good or bad\n(Blackburn, 1998, p. 149). The goal of `expressivism' is distinctly anthropological in\nthat it is descriptive and not prescriptive:\nSo the expressivist thinks we can say interestingly what is involved for\na subject S to think that X is good. It is for S to value it, and this can\nThe aim of ethics should be \"to express and systematize our actual values\"\n(Blackburn 1998, p. 50). Blackburn takes care to emphasize the pragmatic rather\nthan cognitive nature of ethical discourse. He states that `expressivism' does not look\nfor the actual state of mind involved in making an ethical evaluation but rather\ntowards determining the goals and aims of those that place ethical demands on others.\nBlackburn argues that moral rules are justified by their impact on general, i.e. social,\nhappiness. This makes his type of realism a form of Utilitarian realism, and he claims\nthat Hume himself was an indirect Utilitarian. Ethical structures are created for the\npurpose of encouraging social cooperation because social cooperation is necessary for\nthe protection of the `good of society\" (Blackburn, 2001, p. 91). These concerns are\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nthe same ones that underlie Darwin's account of the evolution of our moral sense.\nRealism, Skepticism and Evolutionary Moral Psychology\nMoral skepticism and (some) forms of moral realism refocus our attention as\nto what is the proper object of ethics. Both traditions recognize that moral facts are\npsychological facts of human nature and conduct and are not an external\ntranscendental or supernatural objectivity. What appears to distinguish the two is that\nfor the skeptic, placing moral facts on a psychological or biological basis undermines\nthe claim to any real foundation for ethics, while for the utilitarian (or Cornell) realist\nthere is a foundation that can be located in optimizing the `good' of society. I don't\nthink these two positions are very far apart in terms of their practical consequences\nfor the study of ethics.\nThe skeptic proposes that a practical morality must be one that is negotiated\nbetween the members of a polity or between members of different polities (Mackie,\n1977, p. 170). That is, we must recognize and accept that egoistic self-interest exists\nand that people can be expected to pursue their own self-interests and that as a result,\nindividuals or groups will possibly compete with one another and that conflicts are\nlikely to arise. The purpose of ethical discourse is to ameliorate these conflicts by\nlimiting selfish behavior for the good of the larger group or community. The `ethical\nrealist' Blackburn advocates very much the same directives about the purposes of\nethics.\nAmongst the activities involved in ethics are these: valuing, grading,\nforbidding, permitting, forming resolves, backing off, communicating\nemotion such as anger or resentment, embarrassment or shame,\nvoicing attitudes such as admiration, or disdain or contempt, or even\ndisgust, querying conduct, pressing attack, warding it off (Blackburn,\nSimilarly, Mackie refers to Hume's notion of \"confined generosity\" to\nillustrate the centrality of the task of constraining selfish acts for the common good\nAlthough the subtitle of Mackie's book is \"Inventing Right and Wrong\", a\nbetter subtitle might have been \"Negotiating Right and Wrong\". Given the large\nnumber of considerations that need to be taken into account in any given case, the\ndevelopment of ethical strictures is inevitably dependent on contextual or situational\nfactors with considerable individual and/or group variation. Dennett lists a number of\nprinciples and maxims, which, on a unitary approach to the construction of moral\nsystems, would put contradictory items into the same toolbox (Dennett, 1996, p. 507).\nBut that is Dennett's point: the various maxims simply are practical tools that might\ncome in handy in achieving moral decisions. Although Dennett regards them\nprimarily as short-cuts, the moral skeptic would regard them as required negotiating\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\ntools. If you want a formal moniker, Mackie refers to the position as \"rule-right-\nduty-disposition egoism/utilitarianism\" to try to encompass the full range of tools in\nthe moral psychologist's toolbox (Mackie, 1977, p. 200). At base, Mackie's approach\nis pragmatically indistinguishable from the Utilitarian realism offered by Blackburn\nBoth approaches have the virtue of being consistent with the multiplicity of\nmoral systems found around the planet and hence does not encounter a problem with\nthe `argument from relativism' that undermines the objectivist position. The\nevolutionary moral psychologist, of course, is interested in describing a limit to moral\nrelativism and searches for this in the evolved facts of human nature. Have we found\nanything that could serve as ethical home base? Is there anything that is universal to\nvarious different moral systems that can be traced to species psychology? A good\ncandidate, according to Mackie, might be Kant's central focus on the fundamental\nrole that goes into our ability or disposition to make and keep promises. We might\nalso include the control of violations of promises, and the disposition to punish those\nwho fail to punish violations as interesting and highly relevant natural facts of moral\npsychology. Research on reciprocal altruism, especially the game theoretic\nexperiments with prisoner's dilemmas and commons exploitation have provided a\nsolid foundation for the evolutionary analysis of moral psychology (e.g., Skyrms,\nFinally, let us consider what, if any, constraints might be placed on the aims\nand objectives of evolutionary moral psychology. In 1985, Philip Kitcher criticized\nthe \"vaulting ambition\" of E. O. Wilson's (1975) sociobiology program on grounds\nthat it committed the naturalistic fallacy. Although, it might be possible to commit\nthat fallacy, placing ethics beyond the realm of natural facts is certain to commit the\nanti-naturalistic fallacy. Despite his misgivings about the prospects for an\nevolutionary science of ethics, Kitcher made four assertions as to what he thought an\nevolutionary account might legitimately be able to accomplish (Kitcher, 1985, pp.\nthe one before it. The first of these possibilities was purely descriptive: it gave the\nscientist license only to investigate how people came to acquire ethical concepts or\nhow they make ethical judgments the make and how they construct ethical systems.\nThese aims are easily attainable within the stated province of both moral realism and\nmoral skepticism as presented above. The second possibility granted that we might\nbe able to derive new ethical principles from a combination of newly discovered facts\nand already accepted normative principles. The third possibility is that evolutionary\ntheory might be able to explain meta-ethics, i.e. provide the foundation that underlies\nour ethical beliefs and behavior. The fourth possibility was that evolutionary theory\nmight justify new and different ethical norms. Perhaps as Arnhart (1998a) has argued\nit might be possible, by happy coincidence, that new facts and old principles might\nconverge, but it would be a mistake to stipulate that already existing moral principles\nmust be true because they privilege the possibility of a sacrosanct non-natural basis.5\nMoral realism of a non-natural sort (e.g. Brink, 1989) leaves us open to making this\nThe Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\nmistake. If the moral skeptic is right, then possibility three is impossible because\nthere is no legitimate foundation for meta-ethics. If, on the other hand, we wish to\nform a foundation for meta-ethics at the level of the social `good', then Utilitarian\nrealism might be preferable, but it should be remembered that this is not the sort of\nfoundation that the skeptic is interested in denying. The most far reaching possibility\nis that the science of evolutionary moral psychology might invent new unforeseen\nethical principles. Although expressivists such as Gibbard and Blackburn restrict\nthemselves to a descriptive approach to ethics, if the members of society were to\nutilize scientific facts in constructing novel ethical principles, they would not and\ncould not disapprove. Thus, there is nothing in either the skeptical view or the ethical\nrealist view that would deny the possibility of the invention of new ethical principles\nto replace old ones. Therefore, let it be said that evolutionary moral psychology has\nnothing to fear and much to gain from the investigation of brute facts.\nNotes\n1. David Buss (1994, p. 14) also refers in passing to the `antinaturalistic fallacy',\nbut the nature of the fallacy is not formulated.\n2. Blackburn also credits Saul Kripke as one of the innovators but does not\nsupply a citation. The relevant text might be Naming and Necessity (1980).\n3. Brink draws a distinction between supernatural and non-natural moral entities,\nclaiming that Moore was committed to the latter but not the former (Brink,\n1989, p. 22). I see no useful distinction between the two since both lie outside\nnature. Casebeer (2003, p. 21) discovered a passage in a posthumous text\nauthored by Moore that indicated that he might be willing to assimilate the\nnon-natural nature of the `good' to either a natural or a supernatural property.\nDespite Casebeer's equivocation as to which of the two Moore had in mind, I\nthink it is likely, given the definitive critique of one option, that he had the\nsupernatural one in mind.\n4. The author is grateful to one of the anonymous reviewers for clarifying the\ncentral importance of this issue.\n5. Arnhart (1998a, p. 274) finds that the facts of ethical naturalism coincide with\nthe moral teachings of the Judeo-Christian tradition.\nReferences\nAlcock, J. (2001). The Triumph of Sociobiology.
