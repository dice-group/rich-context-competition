The participants included 63 parents of children suffering from cancer, epilepsy, and asthma. The\nparents rated their children's behavioral and emotional problems and provided information on the frequency of hospitalization,\nonset, and duration of the illness and the age of the child at the disease onset. The Child Behavior Checklist was used.\nMultiple-regression analysis and correlations were computed to determine the relationship of disease-related variables to the\npsychological problems of the children. One-way, between-subject ANOVA was used to analyze the psychological problems\nof children of different age groups. The results showed positive relationships between the frequency of hospitalization and\nthe later onset of the illness and the psychological problems among children. It also showed that children in the age group of\n7 to 11 years had the highest number of problems compared with other age groups. The psychological healing aspects of the\nfamily and the culture on the children's illnesses in the collectivist societies have been discussed.\n",

A chronic illness inca-\npacitates or significantly impairs a child's sensory, physical,\nand mental aspects, interferes with his or her daily function-\ning, and is only manageable but seldom curable. Studies sug-\ngest that the family of a chronically ill child experiences\ndenial, disbelief, distress, depression, guilt, \"burden of\nresponsibility,\" a \"changed identity,\" family conflict and\nresentment in response to the child's illness (Coffey, 2006;\nPrevalence studies suggest that 15% to 18% of all children\nin the United States suffer from a chronic health condition\nhave a chronic health condition (Heflinger & Saunders, 2005).\nSurvey studies conducted in Malaysia indicate that approxi-\nmately one child below 12 years is diagnosed with cancer per\nweek(MoreChildrenStrickenbyCancer,2002)andtheNational\nCancer Registry records about 42,985 new cancer entries each\nyear (Chye & Yahaya, 2004).

These broad findings\nshow that chronic illnesses negatively affect the physical and\npsychological well-being of children. In addition, many \"dis-\nease-related\" variables related to the life circumstances of\nchronically ill children may also affect their psychological\nwell-being.\nDisease-related variables may include the frequency of\nhospitalization, the duration of illness, the age of the child at\nthe onset of illness, the child's age and the gender. Research\nshows that frequent hospital admissions, at least in the short\nterm, cause adverse effects on the child's well-being, and\nexpose him or her to a number of stressors, which include\nstress of separation from the family, school and friends, pain\nof treatment, unfamiliarity of the surroundings, and fear of\nthe unknown (Pao, Ballard, & Rosenstein, 2007). Studies\nalso suggest that physical stressors experienced during the\nhospital stay are related to psychological distress among\nchronically ill children (Saylor et al., 1987). Other adverse\nhospitalization-related effects include trouble sleeping at\nnight, bad food, lack of privacy, and experiencing medical\nprocedures as more disturbing than the illness itself or the\npain (Spirito, Stark, & Tyc, 1994). Recurrent hospitalization\nof chronically ill children is also associated with physical\ndysfunctions (Kelly & Hewson, 2001), and an increase in\nbehavioral problems after being discharged from the hospi-\ntal, regardless of age or medical condition (Thompson &\nAnother factor related to the psychological problems\namong chronically ill children is the duration of disease. A\nnumber of studies of chronically ill children indicate severe\nadjustment problems with extended illness into adolescence\n(Jacobson et al., 1997; Tebbi, Bromberg, Sills, Cukierman, &\nThe onset of illness at a specific age may also affect the\nphysical, social, and cognitive development of a child and\nher or his well-being. Different studies show that children\nwith later onset of illness compared with earlier onset show\ngreater psychological problems (Johnson & Meltzer, 2002),\nhave more difficulties in adjusting to their disease (Brown,\nKaslow, Sansbury, Meacham, & Culler, 1991), and exhibit\ngreater internalizing and externalizing problems (Schoenherr,\nOur study examined the impact of three factors, namely,\nthe frequency of hospitalization, the duration of illness, and\nthe age of the child at the onset of illness on the psychologi-\ncal problems among chronically ill children. We selected\nthree medical categories of oncology, neurology, and respira-\ntory problems because they differ on disease-related dimen-\nsions, including age of child at the onset of the disease,\nduration and severity of illness, perceived prognosis, course,\nand degree of interference with the daily living (Kelly &\nHowever, examining the impact of these factors separately\non the three categories of disease was not possible because of\nsmall sample sizes in each category.\nCulture plays a significant role in psychopathology; how-\never, the research differs in describing its role. The cultural\nrelativism perspective views culture and psychopathology as\ninterlinked; a psychological problem can be understood\nwithin the framework of its culture. The opposing view\nacknowledges the impact of culture on psychological disor-\nders but looks at the cross-cultural similarities in the psycho-\nlogical underpinnings and subjective experiences of these\nThe issue is rather complex when it comes to the defini-\ntion and the measurement of psychological problems across\ndifferent cultures, especially, in the case of children. Children\nare more under the dictates of the cultural influences through\ntheir parents and other social institutions. Generally,\nresearchers define and describe a disorder in a specific cul-\nture and then export their notions to the other cultures\n(Kirmayer, 2007). The opponents of this approach empha-\nsize the cultural specificity of psychological problems\n(Marsella & Yamada, 2007), especially the problems with\nthe reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories across\ndifferent cultures. Some argue that even translation of some\nitems of an assessment instrument to another culture might\nnot make any sense as the language may be very culture spe-\ncific (Kleinman, 1995). This suggests the complexity of the\npsychometric issues related to the assessment of psychopa-\nThere is ample evidence that sociocultural factors play a\nsignificant role in health and disease processes (Ahmad,\n2000; Cheung, Nelson, Advincula, Cureton, & Canham,\n& Brashears, 2006). Cross-cultural studies show that family\nand social support in collectivist culture buffer many types of\nstresses (Matsumoto & Fletcher, 1996; McPherson et al.,\nStudies also show that cultural beliefs (Gone, 2010) and reli-\ngious and spiritual values and practices (Abu Raiya &\nPargament, 2010) may be mitigating forces in illnesses and\npsychopathology to reckon with (Sue, Zane, Hall, & Berger,\nIn contrast to the Western studies, we believe that the fam-\nily and the parent\u00adchild relationship in the Malaysian col-\nlectivist culture may, to some extent, mitigate the negative\nimpact of disease-related variables (Berry & Hardman,\n1998). However, we also feel that as the parent\u00adchild rela-\ntionship and parental support in a collectivist culture is deep\n1988), any short- or long-term separation of children from\ntheir families may negatively impact the physical and psy-\nchological health of the child. This may be, especially, appli-\ncable in the case of hospitalization of the child. The first\nhypothesis tested was that a greater frequency of hospitaliza-\ntions is associated with more psychological problems.\nSocial contact and participation are part of the life of a\nchild in Malaysia. Any inability of a child to participate in\neveryday social activities may affect the well-being of the\nchild. The second hypothesis of the study postulates that the\nlonger the duration of the illness, the children will face more\npsychological problems.\nA child who has been healthy and enjoyed a carefree life\nfor most of his or her childhood may react with utter disbelief\nand denial when diagnosed with a chronic illness compared\nwith a child in his or her early childhood. The diagnosis of\nchronic illness in the later life compared with the earlier\nyears of life may have more negative consequences for a\nchild. The third hypothesis predicts that the later the onset of\nthe illness, more psychological problems will be experienced\nby chronically ill children.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 63 parents of chronically ill children\nincluding 51 mothers and 12 fathers in the age range of 20 to\n51 years. Majority of the parents were housewives, others\nwere working in the government or private sector. The par-\nents were recruited from the outdoor pediatric clinics and\nwards of Kuala Lumpur General Hospital (GHKL) after they\nagreed to participate in the study.\nThe children were 39 males and 24 females in the age\nrange of 4 to 17 years. There were 22 children suffering from\ncancer, 21 from epilepsy, and 20 from asthma. Twenty-nine\nchildren were the middle child, 15 were the eldest, 17 were\nthe youngest, and 2 were the only child in the family. As\nregard their schooling, 25 children attended school for 1 to 3\nyears, 15 attended school for 4 to 6 years, 16 attended school\nand 2 children did not yet attend any school. Thirty-four chil-\ndren came to the clinic for the follow-up while 29 were hos-\npitalized for the treatment. There were 7 outpatient and 15\nhospitalized cancer children. Among epilepsy children, 20\nwere outpatient and 1 was hospitalized. In the case of asthma\nchildren, 7 were outpatient and 13 were hospitalized.\nDetailed demographic characteristics of the respondents and\nthe children are presented in Table 1.\nMeasures\nA demographic questionnaire and the Child Behavior\nChecklist (CBCL) for the age range of 4 to 18 (Achenbach,\nassess the psychological problems of chronically ill children.\nThe CBCL is a widely used measure to assess behavioral,\nemotional, and social problems of children cross-culturally.\nThe checklist has 118 items and is used to obtain information\nabout children's competencies and problems from their par-\nents or surrogate parents. Responses are scored on a 3-point\nrating scale ranging from \"0\" through \"2\" (0 = not true of the\nchild; 1 = sometimes true of the child; and 2 = very true or\noften true of the child) during the past 6 months.\nThe profile of CBCL displays eight syndromes derived\nfrom the statistical analyses of the problems of 4,455 chil-\ndren referred to mental health services, such as withdrawn,\nsomatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems,\nthought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviors,\nTable 1.

The eight syndromes are catego-\nrized into two major groups of disorders, internalizing and\nexternalizing problems. The externalizing problems involve\nchildren's conflicts with others and comprise of aggressive\nand delinquent behavior syndromes. The internalizing\nproblems consist of disorders of emotion and subjective\ninner distress among children such as anxiety and depres-\nsion, withdrawn, and somatic complaints (Achenbach,\nThe internal consistency of subscales of CBCL ranges\nCBCL is demonstrated by the ability of nearly all of its items\nto discriminate significantly between demographically\nmatched referred and nonreferred children. Construct valid-\nity is supported by numerous correlates of CBCL scales,\nincluding significant associations with analogous scales on\nthe Conner's (1996) Parents Questionnaires and the Quay-\nPeterson (1983) Revised Behavior Problem Checklist.\nCriterion validity is supported by the ability of the CBCL's\nquantitative scale scores to discriminate between referred\nand nonreferred children after demographic effects were par-\ntialled out. Clinical cutoff points on the scale were also\nshown to discriminate significantly between demographi-\ncally matched referred and nonreferred children (Achenbach,\nThe major issues in the use of CBCL in other cultures\npertain to its construct validity, in particular the wording and\nMarsella, 2009). However, some major reviews of the use of\nCBCL in different cultures show its reliability and validity\n(Crijnen, Achenbach, & Verhulst, 1999) but on the other\nhand, they also show the variability of its cutoff scores in\ndifferent cultures.\nSome large-scale studies conducted across 23 cultures\nhave replicated the factor structure of CBCL (Ivanova et al.,\n2010); however, other studies suggest that the factors of\nCBCL may not be able to assess some culture-specific\nproblematic behaviors (Weisz, Weisz, Suwanlert, & Chaiyasit,\n2006), a fact which led to the inclusion of culture-specific\nbehaviors on CBCL (Achenbach et al., 2008). Our earlier\nstudies using more culture-specific scales to measure the\npsychological problem of individuals in the Asian countries\nshow quite encouraging results (Siddiqi & Shah, 1997;\nMalik & Shah, 2007), however, to test the cultural suitabil-\nity of CBCL for the Malaysian population was beyond the\nscope of this study. As we used the total scores on CBCL in\nour analyses, we did not replicate the factor structure for\nour sample. We only computed the internal consistency\nindex of CBCL as the measure of its reliability for our\nsample.\nCoefficient alpha was computed to determine the internal\nconsistency reliability of CBCL for our sample after remov-\ning the following items that had zero variance: behave oppo-\nsite sex (C5), sexual problem (C73), think about sex (C96),\ninternal consistency was .94. Interestingly, the authors of\nCBCL recommend removing these items when the study is\nconducted in Muslim respondents. Another Malaysian study\nobtained an average test\u00adretest reliability of .95 after remov-\ning the sexual problem items (Teoh, 2010) from CBCL.\nDemographic questionnaire.A demographic questionnaire\nwas constructed to collect personal and clinical back-\nground data of children and their parents. Information\nobtained included children's age, gender, number of sib-\nlings, years of schooling, diagnosis of disease, age at the\nonset of illness, duration of illness, frequency of hospital-\nization, and current treatment. Demographic parental\ninformation obtained was the gender, age, occupation, and\nrelationship with the child.\nProcedure\nPrior to conducting the study, the research proposal was\nreviewed and approved by International Islamic University\nMalaysia Postgraduate Research and Ethics Committee and\nDirector of GHKL. The data were collected at the Paediatric\nDepartment, GHKL, which has five pediatric wards and\nthree outpatient pediatric clinics for children suffering from\nmedical illnesses. The researcher approached the parents\nwhose children were either suffering from cancer, epilepsy,\nor asthma during their visits to the outpatient clinic or while\naccompanying their children in the wards. If both the parents\nwere present, the mother was requested to fill out the\nquestionnaire.\nFirst, the researcher explained to the parents the purpose\nof the study, which was to know about the psychological and\nother problems of chronically ill children. Then, their con-\nsent to participate in the study was obtained. They were\nassured of the confidentiality of information and about the\nleast likelihood of adverse effects on them as respondents\nand their children following research participation. The\nrespondents were administered the CBCL and then the\ndemographic questionnaire. Most of the parents preferred to\nbe interviewed rather than completing the questionnaires\nthemselves. The researcher administered the questionnaires\nindividually. Each interview took 25 to 40 min. After the\ninterview the researcher thanked the parents and briefed\nthem on the purpose of the study.\nStatistical Analyses\nA multiple-regression analysis was used to assess the impact\nof disease-related variables (duration of illness, the fre-\nquency of hospitalization, and the age of the children at the\nonset of the illness) to the psychological problems of\nchildren.\nThe design also includes a one-way ANOVA on the psy-\nchological problems of children for the age of the children at\nthe onset of the disease.\nResults\nPreliminary Analyses\nA t test for independent samples performed on the psycho-\nlogical problem scores of outpatient and the hospitalized\nchildren showed a nonsignificant effect. The mean CBCL\nscore of the outpatients was 59.8 (SD = 23.3) and the hospi-\nmeans that the outpatient and the hospitalized children do not\ndiffer on the psychological problems.\nTo examine the hospitalization effect for the similarity\nvis-\u00e0-vis differences in the behavioral problems for the three\ndisease categories was not possible because of the consider-\nable asymmetry in the number of hospitalized cancer, asthma,\nand epilepsy children.\nHypothesis Testing\nA multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the\nsignificance of disease-related variables to the psychological\nproblems of children. The duration of illness, the frequency\nof hospitalization, and the age of the children at the onset of\nthe illness were entered as the predictors and the psychologi-\ncal problems as the criterion variables in the equation.\nOne-way, between-subject ANOVA was performed on the\npsychological problem scores of children in different age\ngroups to analyze the differences in their psychological\nproblems.\nTable 2 shows a highly significant effect of multiple-\nshow that the predictors significantly contribute toward the\npsychological problems of the chronically ill children, the\ncriterion. The multiple correlation (R) was .89, the R2 was\nvariance of the criterion (psychological problems) was\naccounted by the predictors, namely frequency of hospital-\nization, age of the children at the onset of illness, and the\nduration of illness.\nResults in Table 3 show a highly significant relationship\nbetween the frequency of hospitalization and the psychologi-\ncant relationship between the age at the onset of illness and\n.001), and a nonsignificant relationship between the duration\nof illness and the psychological problems of chronically ill\nchildren. These results indicate that more frequently the chil-\ndren were hospitalized, and the older the children were when\nafflicted by the illness, the more psychological problems\nthey experienced.\nThe beta coefficients in Table 3 show highest -weight for\nthe frequency of hospitalization followed by the age of the\nchildren at the onset of illness. This means that frequency of\nhospitalization was the most important predictor of the psy-\nchological problems among chronically ill children.\nOne-way, between-subject ANOVA on the psychological\nproblem scores of the children for their age in Table 4 shows\na significant difference in the psychological problems of\nThe mean psychological problem score of children in the age\ncate that children in the middle age range suffered from more\npsychological problems as compared with the children in the\nlower and upper age ranges. An effect size of 2 = .299 (.3)\nor 30% shows that the independent variable of age explains a\nsubstantial portion of variance of the dependent variable.\nThis means that the children's age at the onset of the disease\nplays a crucial role in their psychological problems later.\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the relationship of three disease-related\nvariables, namely, frequency of hospitalization, duration of\nillness, and age of the children at the onset of illness to the\npsychological problems among chronically ill children. The\nresults supported the first hypothesis of the study that postu-\nlated a relationship between the frequency of hospitalization\nand psychological problems of chronically ill children. This\nimplies that frequency of hospital admission is strongly asso-\nciated with the psychological problems among chronically ill\nchildren. Other studies show that frequent hospitalization of\nsick children causes psychological dysfunctions (Kelly &\nemotional difficulties, anxiety, behavioral disturbances, and\nor prolonged hospitalization may put excessive demands on\nthe children because of separation from the family and\nfriends and restricting their participation in social activities\n(Haslum, 1988). This sense of deprivation may make the\nchildren feel inadequate, handicapped, inferior, and\ndepressed.\nA hospitalized child may face the dilemma of adjusting to\nan unfamiliar, regimented hospital environment, and painful\nmedical procedures (Jones, Fiser, & Livingston, 1992).\nExposure to unfamiliar nursing care in a hospital instead of\ncaring by the parents may cause feelings of helplessness,\nTable 2.

A study of Malaysian mothers of chil-\ndren with cerebral palsy found that repeated or lengthy hos-\npitalization put great demands on the child and the family,\nled to the deterioration of caregiver's health and morale, and,\nin few cases, to family disintegration (Ong, Afifah, Safiah, &\nAs mentioned earlier, we could not examine the hospital-\nization effects on the behavioral problems of children\nbetween the three disease categories. However, it is possible\nthat the hospitalization effects might be very different for the\nthree disease categories if a bigger sample was studied.\nSimilarly, big differences in the number of children in dif-\nferent categories of the variables on the \"number of siblings\"\nand the \"year of schooling\" was an obstacle to performing\nmeaningful analyses to see their impact on the psychological\nproblems of children suffering from chronic diseases. We\nassume that the number of siblings as well as the years of\nschooling might have some mitigating effect on the psycho-\nlogical problem of these children.\nMalaysian children live in a diverse social circle as they\nsocialize with their relatives and neighbors and visit their\nfriends after the school. Hospitalization may make sick chil-\ndren feel lonely, bored, and predispose them to emotional\nand behavioral problems.\nFurthermore, a positive relationship between the age of\nthe children at the onset of illness and the psychological\nproblems support our second hypothesis. A comparison of\ndifferent age groups showed that children in the age of 7 to\n11 years had the most psychological problems, followed by\nthe children in the age ranges of 11 to 17 and 4 to 7 years. A\nchild who had been healthy for quite some time, the diagno-\nsis of chronic illness may devastate the child and force her or\nhim to adapt to this new unwelcome and unpleasant reality.\nThus, the feelings of anxiety and aggression may be height-\nened during this particular time.\nThe results of a national survey of psychiatric morbidity\namong Malaysian children and adolescents indicated the\nhighest number of mental health and psychological problems\nOther findings also suggest that children in the middle\nchildhood stage experience more problems in dealing with\ntheir illness because they are in the developmental stage\nof an increasing need for autonomy, initiative, and mas-\ntery of new skills (Garrison & McQuiston, 1989; Witt,\nRiley, & Coiro, 2003). Chronic illnesses that impose limi-\ntations on physical activity and social interaction restrict\nthe children's freedom, deprive them of the experiences\ncrucial to their development of self-esteem, sense of mas-\ntery and control over their environment (Meijer et al.,\nmal life to illness in the middle and later childhood takes\nits toll in the form of behavioral and emotional problems\n2008); however, children may adjust to and overcome\nthese difficulties, especially the feelings of depression and\nanxiety over time (Jusiene & Kuchinskas, 2004), if family\nsupport and good nurturing is available (Berge & Patterson,\nOur study found no relationship between the duration of\nillness and the psychological problems of children in con-\ntrast to some Western studies (Jacobson et al., 1997;\net al., 1990). We believe that the collectivist Malaysian soci-\nety with its well-established social support mechanism\n(Gone, 2010) may be a mitigating force on the long-term\neffects of a chronic illness as it provides opportunities to the\nsick children to participate in everyday activities and to be\npart of the main stream society (Matsumoto & Fletcher,\n1996). The opportunities of social contact and interaction in\nextended families and participation in the religious and spiri-\ntual practices in the collectivist cultures may alleviate the\nTable 3.

Our study shows that recurrent hospitalization\nand the onset of disease in the middle childhood are the two\nfactors contributing toward the psychological problems\namong chronically ill children. Obviously efforts need to be\nmade to avoid repeated or prolonged hospitalization of\nchildren.\nOn the bases of the outcome of our research, especially\nthe impact of hospitalization on the psychological well-being\nof the sick children, we would like to recommend to the\nMinistry of Health to develop a comprehensive and sustain-\nable training program for the nurses, social workers, psychia-\ntrists, clinical psychologists, child psychologists, and\ncounselors to deliver mental health services to the chroni-\ncally ill children and adolescents.\nChildhood is a vital stage in human development.\nChronically ill children, in particular, demand special care\nand attention, to ensure their well-being. Mental and psycho-\nlogical problems in childhood tend to continue into adult-\nhood; hence, they require attention and management at the\nearlier stages of sickness.\nLimitations\nOur study has some limitations because of a small sample\nsize and a lack of a thorough test of psychometric properties\nof CBCL for the Malaysian culture. The scope of the study\ndid not permit gathering a larger sample size as it was time-\nconsuming and costly. It took a couple of months to recruit a\nsample of 63 parents of chronically sick children as these\nchildhood illnesses are not common.\nAs mentioned earlier, we did not test the factor structure\nof CBCL as we used only total scores on the scale and did not\nanalyze differences between different disease categories on\nthe internalizing and externalizing problems, and so on.\nSome disease-specific analyses on some demographic\nvariables could not be performed because of insufficient\nnumber of subjects in different categories of these variables\nsuch as the differences in the hospitalization effects for the\nthree disease categories, the years of schooling, and the num-\nber of siblings.\nIt would be difficult to generalize our findings because of\nthe small sample and the limited focus of the study; however,\nthe outcome of this study could provide some useful direc-\ntions for future research.\nSuggestions for Future Research\nThe research in the future may focus on contributions of the\nMalaysian joint family system as a viable alternative to pro-\nviding care to the sick children at home to avoid the adverse\neffects of hospitalization for the children. The grandparents\nand other family members can take care of sick children.\nFuture research can also examine if the family members\nwere trained to take care of a chronically ill child, whether\nthey do it with more care, involvement, and passion and\nwhether all this has a positive impact on the well-being of a\nchild.\nThe future research may also focus on suggesting certain\nmeasures to lessen the impersonal impact of the hospital on\nthe sick child if hospitalization were indispensable. The mea-\nsure may include provision such as \"live in\" pediatric wards,\nthat is, admitting the mother and the child, allowing visits at\nall times, and promoting home atmosphere in the ward\nthrough ingenious decoration, lively wall colors, toys, and\nAnother future research focus may be on the role of con-\ntinuation of education by sick children irrespective of their\ninpatient status. Any impediment of a child's education\nbecause of hospitalization and its relation to the psychologi-\ncal problems of the children may suggest the positive impact\nof education on the children despite their sickness and hos-\npitalization. Such findings serve as a catalyst for promoting\nan education friendly hospitalization atmosphere where the\nsick children have the opportunity to learn and to interact\nwith their teachers and the class mates to enhance their\ndevelopment.\nFuture research may also examine the impact of improved\nmental health care facilities on the psychological and overall\nwell-being of sick children. In this regard, it may be impor-\ntant to focus on increasing the awareness of the parents, fam-\nily members, and the health care providers about the social\nimpact of chronic illness on the family system. This will help\nthe health caregivers to provide effective services and will\nempower families to increase their resources, coping behav-\niors, and problem-solving skills to deal with the stressors\ninvolved in caring for a family member with chronic illness\nAuthors' Note\nThe first author was working at the Department of Psychology,\nInternational Islamic University, Malaysia, when the study was\nconducted.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nReferences\nAbu Raiya, H., & Pargament, K.
