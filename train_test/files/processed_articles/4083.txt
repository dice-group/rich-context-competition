Social\nentrepreneurship is becoming an important business model, while the concept of accountability is prevalent in today's\nenvironment. The scoping review is a type of literature search with certain important distinctions from a literature review.\nSystematically, the scoping review explores the literature from a relevance viewpoint rather than by evaluating the quality\nof the research. Then the data are mapped or charted to identify key themes and gaps in the literature. We observe that\naccountability in social entrepreneurship is viewed and studied in three different ways: as a relationship between parties,\nas an outcome, or as a predictor variable. We also observe that most of the research is done in the United States, Europe,\nand Australia. Finally we observe that research methodologies utilized are primarily based around qualitative methods or\nconceptual descriptions.\n",

As a dynamic business model incor-\nporating elements of commercialism, social involvement,\nand innovation, tensions inevitably result from conflicting or\nunclear objectives and responsibilities (Dey & Steyaert,\nstanding accountability relationships is likely to be a chal-\nDescribing Accountability\nAccountability is ambiguous as a term, complex and context\ndependent (A. P. Williams & Taylor, 2013). From the descrip-\ntive sense, it is possible to view accountability in a social\ncontext as a holistic framework in the not-for-profit sector,\nthe public sector, or private sector (A. P. Williams & Taylor,\n2013). Accountability can also be viewed in a legal, adminis-\ntrative, professional, or social framework (Bovens, 2007).\nThe academic literature proposes various definitions based\non the broader environment in which accountability functions.\nFor example, there are different models of accountability\ndepending on the political, bureaucratic, legal, and business\nperspectives and along dimensions of vertical, lateral, and\ndiagonal orientations (Bovens, 2007). Accountability has also\nbeen defined for individuals as well as for organizations where\noften the proxy of an individual is used to define the account-\nability of the organization (Bovens, 2007).\nAccountability has been defined as being responsible to\nan audience with reward or punishment power (Brandsma &\nand justify conduct\" (Bovens, 2007, p. 9). It often involves a\nrelationship between parties, groups, or individuals and is a\nmechanism for guiding the behavior of people involved.\nOne of the ways that accountability is modeled in the lit-\nerature is from the viewpoint of relationships (Laughlin,\n(2000) have described a \"web of accountability relationships\"\n(p. 241) that may create inter-party conflicts and non-optimal\nsolutions. The relationships can be cast in a matrix of four\nquadrants describing hierarchical, legal, professional, and\npolitical relationships classified according to levels of auton-\nomy and positioning of control or expectations (p. 242).\nized accountability as a relationship issue between an account-\nability holder and an accountability holdee.\n1University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nRuben Burga, Department of Management, College of Business and\nEconomics, University of Guelph, 50 Stone Road East, Guelph, Ontario,\nEmail: rburga@uoguelph.ca\nA Scoping Review of Accountability\nin Social Entrepreneurship\nRuben Burga1 and Davar Rezania1\n Keywords\nsocial entrepreneurship, accountability, scoping review, literature review\n2 SAGE Open\nBrandsma and Schillemans (2013) view the accountabil-\nity process in terms of outcomes by quantifying the transfer\nof information, the concentration of bilateral discussions,\nand the use of power to enforce accountability. They attempt\nto map \"the intensity of all three phases\" (p. 960) and create\na three dimensional model of accountability within a public\ninstitution.\nHowever, Koppell (2005) views accountability as an inde-\npendent variable that is a predictor of dysfunction in an orga-\nnization. He defines a typology that includes \"transparency,\nliability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness\"\n(p. 94) as elements of accountability. The problem of meeting\n\"conflicting expectations,\" according to Koppell (2005),\ndetermines the efficiency and effectiveness of problem reso-\nlution at an organizational level.\nObtaining a general sense of how accountability is described\nin the literature is not straightforward. However, from the\naccountability literature discussed here, three themes seem to\nbe predominant. Accountability can be framed from the view-\npoint of relationships, in terms of outcomes, and as predictors\nof dysfunction.\nDescribing SE\nSE is a recent business construct where the typical entrepre-\nneurship drive for profit is also complemented by an active\nconcern for the environment and social issues (Austin,\nStevenson, & Wei-Skillern, 2006). The formation of SE has\nbeen described as achieving both financial gain and providing\nsocial benefits (Battilana, Lee, Walker, & Dorsey, 2012).\nRoper and Cheney (2005) have discussed that SE is a \"hybrid\nbetween private, non-profit and public sectors\" (Roper &\nfirms are shaped by the environment in which they are\nlaunched which is reflected in their definition and the ambig-\nuous terminology that is used around this definition (Dhesi,\n2010). In North American society, SE firms generate revenue\nbut yet have a primary drive for social and environmental\nconcerns (Kerlin, 2006). The distinctions between profit-\noriented and non-profit SE firms in North America relates to\nlegislative nomenclature that determine a firm's taxation sta-\ntus (Kerlin, 2006). From the SE field, whether they are con-\nsidered for profit-oriented or non-profit has been defined by\nthe allocation of those profits or re-investing of those profits\ninto the social venture (Lepoutre, Justo, Terjesen, & Bosma,\n2013). In Europe, the business model has traditionally been\noriented around community-oriented firms with less concern\nabout the generation of revenue for profit purposes (Kerlin,\n2006). In developing countries, SE firms are agents of change\nthat \"allows the impoverished . . . to enter the circle of eco-\nTheir institutional impact from the viewpoint of profit orien-\ntation has not been extensively studied (Mair & Marti, 2007).\nGlobally across the academic literature, profit-oriented and\nnon-profit firms are currently accepted as models of the spec-\ntrum of SE firms (Battilana et al., 2012).\nThe terminology describing SE is also multi-faceted.\nLight (2008) examines various components of SE and\nfocuses on the entrepreneurial component of these ventures.\nSimilar definitions are found in research articles by Dees\nHowever, there are also researchers who equate social entre-\npreneurial firms with social ventures (Dees & Anderson,\nNicholls, 2009), and other similar terms linked to socially\nresponsible businesses (Yunus, Moingeon, & Lehmann-\nOrtega, 2010). Consequently, a scoping review within the\ncontext of SE will also need to consider some of the possible\nvariations of SE terminology such as social enterprise and\nsocial ventures for completeness in the review process.\nThe Research Problem\nThe problem of accountability in the SE model is both theo-\nretical and practical. From the theoretical standpoint, the\nconcept underlies the models for governance of a firm.\nFrom a practical standpoint, as concerns for environmental\nand social sustainability increases, improved accountability\nto the public gains practical relevance. The objective of this\nstudy and its research question is to provide an overview or\nscoping of the type, extent, and quantity of research avail-\nable in the current accountability literature related to SE.\nThis scoping review will examine the academic literature\nas it relates to accountability and SE and tease out themes\nand common ideas. As part of the scoping study methodol-\nogy, there will not be an exclusive focus on entrepreneur-\nship or entrepreneurs but instead the scoping survey will\nreview articles exploring the SE concept. Exploration of\nthis kind may help to surface gaps in the literature that\nwould need addressing and where no gaps are clearly iden-\ntified, common trends can be described (Arksey &\nMethodology\nThe scoping review is a type of literature review but with\ncertain important distinctions. Systematically, the scoping\nreview looks at the literature from a relevance viewpoint\nrather than by evaluating the quality of the research. This\naddresses the exploratory nature of a scoping review. Then\nthe data are mapped or charted to identify key themes, and\npotential gaps in the literature. Finally, a consultation process\nwith subject matter or contextual experts can be optionally\nused to validate the findings (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005).\nArksey and O'Malley (2005) specify five stages to the scop-\ning review. These stages will be integrated throughout this\narticle: \"identifying the research question\" (p. 23), \"study\nselection\" (p. 25), \"charting the data\" (p. 26), collating and\nreporting on the results (p. 27). There is a final and optional\nstep of consulting a subject matter expert that may be used if\nthe remaining themes and issues do not identify a gap in the\nBurga and Rezania 3\nWe started the scoping review with a literature search\nwhich was conducted to identify peer-reviewed, English lan-\nguage, academic literature that was relevant to this article's\nquestion. Boolean search expressions, as shown in Figure 1,\nwere used to narrow the search results.\nThe initial search used terms that were used to represent\nSE with the \"AND\" Boolean operator to capture all of the\navailable literature within the searched databases. Using the\nterm \"accountability\" focused on articles that were more\nconcerned on accountability rather than accounting-related\npapers. From the initial results, a different Boolean operator\nwas used to ensure that both terms were within 10 words of\neach other. In the ABI-INFORM database search, we used\n\"NEAR/10\" and in the EBSCO database search we used\n\"N10.\" We stayed with the search results from the WEB OF\nSCIENCE search. Focusing on the full text forABI-INFORM\nand the full text for EBSCO, and using the WEB OF\nSCIENCE search engines ensured that papers focused on\nboth issues of accountability and SE could be selected.\nSubsequently the papers were reviewed for duplication\nand for papers that considered accountability rather than sim-\nply mentioned it. The main research questions of the relevant\narticles were paraphrased or extracted. Their research\nmethodology and the way that \"accountability\" was used\nwithin the paper were listed. Similarities and themes from\nthe theoretical viewpoint were teased out and reviewed.\nAccountability articles were grouped according to the\nthree principal themes that were described in the introduc-\ntion: accountability relationships in SE (Romzek & Ingraham,\n2000), accountability as dependent variables or outcomes in\nSE (Brandsma & Schillemans, 2013), and accountability as\nindependent variables or predictor elements in SE (Koppell,\n2005). The themes as listed in Table 1 were determined from\nreading the articles. The research methodology defined by\nthe content of the articles is listed in the second major col-\numn of Table 1 summarized from the detailed listings in the\nappendix.\nResults\nThe results described in Table 1 show three main account-\nability groupings and the methodology used by the research-\ners. Research questions were listed and whether the articles\nreferred to non-profit/not-for-profit or for-profit firms was\nreviewed and listed in the appendix. As suggested by scop-\ning review methodology, the articles were not analyzed in\nFigure 1. Scoping review search methodology.\n4 SAGE Open\ndepth aside from their initial categorizations (Arksey &\nOur first observation is that there are almost an equal\nnumber of articles for each accountability theme, indicating\na variety of opinions of how accountability is considered.\nThis is in line with general accountability literature where\naccountability is modeled as predictors, outcomes, or as the\nrelationship between parties.\nOur second observation is that the research methodology\nutilized in this field is primarily based around qualitative\nmethodology with one article using quantitative methodol-\nogy and the remaining articles of a conceptual nature. Most\nof the articles used case study methodology to describe or\nexplore issues related to accountability. This type of qualita-\ntive methodology is expected around emerging issues and\ntheories (Yin, 1981) and where \"descriptive inferences\" with\nincomplete data need to be made (Gerring, 2004). Given that\nseveral of the reviewed papers have focused on accountabil-\nity as dependent variables or independent variables (out-\ncomes or predictors), one would expect more quantitative\nstudies of accountability in SE.\nAnother observation is that most of the research is based\nin the United States, Europe, and Australia with one article's\nresearch originating in Jamaica and another in India. The\naccountability context is primarily oriented around social\nand administrative categories rather than political or legal\ncategories (Bovens, 2007). This makes logical sense as this\nliterature deals with the scope of SE activities that tend to be\nrelated to small firms involved in social activities (Battilana\nIn the next stage, an iterative process as described in scop-\ning review methodology (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005) was\napplied to the research results to view the results through the\nlens of different management theories. The results shown in\nTable 2 indicate the main management theories discussed in\nthe articles as detailed in the appendix. The earliest published\nresearch area. Based on Table 2, certain theoretical areas are\nrepresented more frequently: stakeholder theory, social capi-\ntal theory, entrepreneurial theory, ethical responsibility the-\nory, critical theory, and economic responsibility theory.\nMainstream theories such as agency theory, stewardship\ntheory, and institutional theory have previously been advanced\nas important theories to consider in the consideration of\naccountability (Mansouri & Rowney, 2014). Interestingly,\nneither stewardship theory nor agency theory were mentioned\nin any of the 27 articles. This could indicate the potential for\nadditional research on accountability in SE using other theo-\nretical perspectives.\nDiscussion\nThe objective of this study was to provide an overview of\nthe type, extent, and quantity of research available on cur-\nrent accountability literature related to SE through a rapid\ngathering of literature and a mapping of the results. Arksey\nand O'Malley (2005) identify this technique as one that\nidentifies research gaps without necessarily commenting\non the quality of the extant research. Davis, Drey, and\nGould (2009) suggest that the limits of the technique be\nclearly specified to improve the usefulness and applicabil-\nity of the results. In the following discussion, the results\nwill be analyzed and the limitations of the analysis will be\npresented.\nThis scoping review looked at accountability in social\nentrepreneurial settings and determined that this field of\nstudy has not been extensively researched. Of the 890 peer-\nreviewed articles dealing with accountability and some ver-\nsion of SE terminology, only 27 relevant articles were found\nfrom a search of the EBSCO, Proquest ABI-INFORM, and\nWEB OF SCIENCE databases that integrated both concepts.\nOur search methodology could have missed papers that did\nnot describe accountability and SE within the number of\nwords and with the terminology for SE that were defined in\nour search algorithm.\nOur search methodology also included a manual revision\nof the 65 articles that were generated prior to narrowing the\nrelevant articles to 27 (shown in Figure 1). During this revi-\nsion, we were subjective in our interpretation of both the\ncontext of SE and how accountability was described within\nthis context. As a limitation of this review, it is possible that\nwe may have excluded some of the articles because of their\nmarginal inclusion of accountability or marginal context of\nSE according to our interpretation of the concepts.\nTable 1.

In particular, we could not find\ndiscussions of agency theory or stewardship theory. Agency\ntheory has been described as driving accountability relation-\nStewardship theory, institutional theory, and agency theory\nare also described within the context of accountability\n(Mansouri & Rowney, 2014). From the results of the scoping\nsurvey, accountability in a SE setting may derive more of its\nwork from theories related to social dimensions such as\nstakeholder theory, social capital theory, and ethical respon-\nsibility theory among the others shown in Table 2.\nThis scoping review reveals that the literature on account-\nability of SE is still scarce. Dees (1998) in describing one of\nthe five main roles of a SE firm discussed that they should be\n\"exhibiting a heightened sense of accountability to the con-\nstituencies served and for the outcomes created\" (Dees,\n1998, p. 4). The different ways of defining accountability\nwithin the SE context shows that researchers are examining\nvarious facets of this variable using qualitative and concep-\ntual articles. Accountability can be viewed as a predictor, as\nan outcome, or as the context or relationships in which SE\noperates.\nWe found that the articles selected did not specifically\nfocus on defining accountability except for the article by\nAchleitner, Lutz, Mayer, and Spiess-Knafl (2013) who\ndefined \"voluntary accountability\" (p. 105). We found that\nthe other articles focused on the application of accountability\npractices in the SE context rather than focus on the concep-\ntual definition of accountability.\nAcademic researchers continue to debate accountability\nin SE. There are ample opportunities to continue researching\nthis area and contribute further to SE literature. We highlight\nsome of the potential research areas.\nFurther research is needed to examine accountability in\nrelation to the governance of the SE. Like any other corpora-\ntions, social entrepreneurial firms need to be transparent in\nall aspects of their governance. They need to demonstrate\naccountability to their shareholders, as well as to stakehold-\ners within and outside the firm. They need to deal with issues\nsuch as conflicting expectations and multiple accountabili-\nties through proper governance structures. Good governance\nrequires proper provision of information, proper debate of\nissues, and proper decision-making structures and processes.\nEven though governance of firms have been the subject of\nseveral studies, the specific characteristics of SE in relation\nto multiple expectation and accountabilities justify further\nstudies of governance in the context of SE.\nFrom the firm's perspective, it is important to understand\nhow accountability issues are raised, challenged, and resolved.\nWhen is accountability a predictor, an outcome, or a nexus of\nrelationships? Further studies of how accountability is enacted\nin the context of SE are necessary to help practitioners design\nand implement proper governance structures.\nFrom the social perspective, accountability in the context\nof SE implies multiple accountability scenarios. We expect\nthat these relationships may be fluid in the context of a\ndynamic SE model and that they will impact the SE firm.\nWhat theory can be used to model multiple accountability\nscenarios and how can this be empirically described and\nmeasured?\nFrom the critical perspective, accountability and SE can be\nresearched from the viewpoint of whether SE should even be\nconsidered a business model as it is mostly assumed in the\ncurrent literature search. Some critical perspectives discuss\nTable 2.

Behavior takes\nplace in a social context and is influenced by mutual excep-\ntions, norms, and mutual patterns of behavior. More research is\nneeded to understand the relationship between accountability\nand decision-making, how accountability guides behavior of a\nsocial entrepreneur, and what processes are implemented\nwithin a SE to enable accountability.\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this scoping review was to identify gaps with-\nout doing an exhaustive review of the literature. One of the\ngaps identified related to a lack of homogeneity in the theo-\nries used. The other main gap that was identified related to a\nlack of empirical and more specifically quantitative research\non accountability in the social entrepreneurial sector.\nThrough this scoping review, we also identified mul-\ntiple definitions of accountability in the context of SE.\nThe lack of agreement in defining accountability as a\ntheoretical construct and the lack of homogeneity in its\noperationalization in the research papers that were identi-\nfied show both an opportunity and a challenge. The\nopportunity is to identify the specific SE context where\naccountability is most important. The challenge lies in\nthat accountability as a construct may require anchoring\nto a particular theory to be able to define its relationship\nin the SE context.\nSE continues to be a vibrant field and mapping account-\nability within this field is unexplored. This scoping study\nprovides a launching pad for further conceptual and empiri-\ncal research of accountability within SE.\nAppendix\nList of 27 Research Articles on Accountability Within the Field of Social Entrepreneurship/Enterprises/Ventures.\nAuthors Research question/objective Type of research Accountability as\nEl Abboubi and\nNicolopoulou\n\"With our research question, we aim to understand the\nstakeholder-involvement process in certification projects.\nWe are not testing a pre-conceived hypothesis but rather\nenabling enrichment of the theoretical framework from\nthe data.
