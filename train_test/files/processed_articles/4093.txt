There were significant positive correlations between PON1\nlactonase activity and MPO\nactivity and HbA1c level, and plasma MPO and HbA1c. There were significant negative correlations\nbetween PON1\nlactonase activity and TEAC, and MPO activity and TEAC.\nConclusions: Increased lactonase activity may inefficiently compensate for the high level of\nchronic inflammation and low antioxidant capacity in the plasma of patients with type 1 diabetes\nmellitus.\n",

Exclusion criteria for all study\nparticipants were: acute hyperglycemia\ncrisis; inflammatory or infectious disease;\nactive liver disease; acute vascular disease;\ncurrent immunosuppressive therapy; and\nvitamin C or E supplementation. All\npatients were receiving subcutaneous insulin\nfor glycaemic control, with a target glyco-\nsylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of <7%.\nHealthy staff members were recruited as\nvolunteers and included as control subjects.\nNo attempt was made to age- or sex-match\nthe control population.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of the NC Paulescu National\nInstitute of Diabetes, Nutrition and\nMetabolic Diseases, Bucharest, Romania.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all study participants.\nPlasma preparation\nAll participants provided peripheral blood\nsamples after an overnight fast. Blood (5 ml)\nwas collected into sterile tubes containing\n34 IU lithium heparin and centrifuged at\nplasma was placed on ice prior to storage at\n\u00c080C until further analysis. Plasma was\nused for the assay of PON1\n, MPO and total\nantioxidant activity. HbA1c was quantified\nin whole blood (2 ml) collected into\nsterile tubes containing potassium\u00adEDTA\nSample analysis\nAll assays were performed on a Perkin-\nElmer Lambda EZ 210 spectrophotometer\n(Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA), and\nwere carried out on duplicate samples.\nTotal protein was assayed via the\nBradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nHercules, CA, USA). Optical density was\nmeasured at 595 nm against a bovine serum\nalbumin standard curve.\nPlasma PON1\nlactonase activity was\ndetermined using dihydrocoumarin\n(DEPCyMC; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie,\nSteinheim, Germany), as described previ-\nously,19 with absorbance measured at\n270 nm. Enzymatic activity was expressed\nas U/ml.\nMPO activity was determined with the\no-dianisidine\u00adhydrogen peroxide method.20\nThe change in absorbance was measured at\nResults were expressed as units of MPO/\nmg protein, with 1 unit of MPO defined as\nthe quantity of enzyme degrading 1 nmol\nhydrogen peroxide/min at 25C.\nTotal antioxidant activity was deter-\nmethylchroman-2 carboxylic acid (Trolox)\nequivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)\nassay developed by Miller et al,21 with\nmodifications.22 Optical density (absorb-\nance) was read at 734 nm against 5 mmol/l\nphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The\npercentage inhibition of absorbance (dir-\nectly proportional to antioxidant activity)\nwas calculated. The assay was calibrated\nagainst a Trolox standard curve. Plasma\nTEAC was expressed as mmol of Trolox\nequivalent per litre of plasma.\nWhole blood HbA1c was quantified by\nstandardized immunoturbidimetry (Cobas\nIntegra\u00d5; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,\nGermany) in accordance with the manufac-\nturer's instructions.23\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as adjusted predictive\nvalues based on a linear regression model,\nusing age as the independent variable. No\ndata imputations were performed. The data\nwere, therefore, corrected for age as a\npotential confounder. Between-group differ-\nences were determined using parametric\n(two-tailed Student's t-test) or nonpara-\nmetric (two-tailed Wilcoxon) tests. The\nstrength of association between pairs of\nvariables was assessed using Spearman\nrank correlation analysis. Data analyses\nwere performed using InStat version 3\n(GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA, USA).\nP-values <0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe study included 18 patients with diabetes\ncontrol subjects (13 male/7 female; mean age\ndemographic and clinical characteristics of\nthe participants are shown in Table 1.\nPatients were significantly older and had\nsignificantly higher HbA1c than controls\nData regarding plasma antioxidant cap-\nacity and enzyme activities are shown in\nlactonase and MPO activities\nwere significantly higher and plasma TEAC\nwas significantly lower in patients than in\ncontrols (P < 0.001 for each comparison).\nIn the patient group, there were signifi-\ncant positive correlations between PON1\nlactonase activity and MPO activity\nwere significant negative correlations\nbetween PON1\nlactonase activity and\nDiscussion\nThe present study identified increased levels\nlactonase activity and decreased\ntotal antioxidant capacity in the plasma of\npatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus com-\npared with healthy control subjects. The\nTEAC assay is a validated, standardized\nmethod for determining total antioxidant\ncapacity of a biological sample.24 Our data,\ntherefore, suggest defective antioxidant\nfunction in type 1 diabetes despite apparent\nupregulation of PON1\nlactonase. It is pos-\nsible that this may be due to the known\ndecrease in activity of PON1\nwhen disso-\nciated from high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\nto the lipoprotein-free serum fraction under\ndiabetic conditions.25 It has been shown that\nthe higher the concentration of glucose in\nplasma from patients with diabetes, the\nhigher the rate of PON1\ndissociation from\nIn vitro studies have found that that\nvarious oxidative stress systems differen-\ntially impair PON1\nactivities,27 and that\nHDL-bound PON1\nlactonase is less sensitive\nthan HDL-bound PON1\narylesterase in the\nsame specific oxidative environment.27\nSimilar data have been found in patients\nlactonase\nactivity has also been shown to decrease\nwith higher carotid intima\u00admedia thickness,\nsuggesting that this enzyme is an independ-\nent risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients\nwith diabetes.28 Substrate availability may\nTable 1.

This suggests that\ndiabetes is characterized by chronic inflam-\nmation, in accordance with data showing the\nimportance of plasma MPO concentration\nand chronic inflammation as predictors for\natherosclerosis progression in coronary dis-\nactivity is a source of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS),36 amplifying the ROS-induced\nimpairment of endothelium-dependent\nrelaxation via reduction of nitric oxide bio-\navailability.37 Furthermore, MPO is a well\nestablished inflammatory marker related to\nendothelial dysfunction and coronary dis-\nease,10 and ROS are considered to be medi-\nators of chronic inflammation in diabetes.38\nlactonase reduces lipid peroxides\nand exhibits peroxidase-like activity.39 The\npositive correlation between PON1\nlacto-\nnase activity, MPO activity and HbA1c in\nour patients with type 1 diabetes therefore\nsuggests a protective role of PON1\nin the\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis, in accord-\nance with data indicating a role for PON1\nin\nthe prevention of atherosclerosis and car-\ndiovascular disease.40 It could be speculated\nthat the increased peroxidase-like activity of\nlactonase may reflect a compensatory\nresponse against ROS overproduction gen-\nerated by MPO activity.\nThere are several limitations of our study.\nThe incomplete evaluation of all activities of\nresults in limited characterization of\nfunction in type 1 diabetes. The\nquantification of homocysteine or homo-\ncysteine\u00adthiolactone would allow better\ncharacterization of PON1\nlactonase activity\nor other activities, such as arylesterase.\nIsolation of serum lipoproteins would\npermit analysis of serum PON1\ndistribution\nbetween HDL and lipoprotein-deficient\nserum, and the comparison of PON1\nbio-\nlogical functions in these fractions. This\nstudy was also limited by its small sample\nsize, although this is more likely to bias the\nresults toward a negative finding (due to\ninsufficient statistical power) than a false-\npositive result.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that\nincreased lactonase activity may inefficiently\ncompensate for the high level of chronic\ninflammation and low antioxidant capacity\nin the plasma of patients with type 1\ndiabetes mellitus. This observation underlies\nthe antioxidant properties described previ-\nously in relation to the lactonase activity of\n.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
