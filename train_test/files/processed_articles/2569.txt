We\nsought to evaluate the association of health insurance status with mortality among working-age participants with\nalbuminuria in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994 (NHANES III).\nrepresentative study of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, who provided information on insurance and\nwho had albuminuria, defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]  30 mg/g and their subsequent\nmortality to December 31, 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between\ninsurance status and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD while adjusting in a\nstepwise fashion for sociodemographic factors, co-morbidities, and co-morbidity severity/control covariates.\nResults: In our sample of individuals with albuminuria (n = 903), mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\nhad public insurance and 67 % had private insurance. Compared to individuals with private insurance, those\nwith public insurance or no insurance were significantly more likely to be a racial or ethnic minority, to have\nincome <200 % below the federal poverty level, to have less than high school education; and they were less likely\nto be married and to report good or excellent health, all p < 0.05. Being uninsured or having public insurance was\nassociated with increased all-cause mortality in the fully adjusted model (HR 2.97 and 3.65, respectively, p < 0.05).\nThere was no significant relationship between insurance status and cardiovascular mortality.\nConclusions: In a nationally representative sample of individuals with albuminuria, uninsurance and public\ninsurance were associated with increased mortality compared to the private insurance even after controlling for\nsociodemographic, health status, and health care variables. Improving access to care and the quality of care\nreceived may potentially reduce mortality in individuals with evidence of early CKD.\n",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the\nassociation of insurance status with all-cause and cardio-\nvascular mortality among working-age adults with albu-\nminuria in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nMethods\nStudy population\nNHANES III, conducted by the National Center for\nnationally representative study based on a stratified,\nclustered, multistage probability sample survey of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population in the US. All\nparticipants provided informed consent. Participants\nunderwent a home interview followed by an extensive\nphysical examination and blood and urine sampling at a\nmobile examination center. Blood and urine samples\nand blood pressure were obtained during the physical\nexamination. Self-reported information on sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and presence of medical condi-\ntions was collected during the home interview [15]. The\nsurvey protocol was approved by the NCHS institutional\nreview board. Participants 65 years of age and older were\nexcluded due to their low rates of uninsurance due to\nMedicare eligibility. Our sample included all NHANES\nIII respondents aged 18\u00ad64 years with albuminuria who\nprovided information on insurance.\nOf the 33,356 NHANES III participants examined, we\nexcluded 19,313 individuals who were pregnant, older\nand non-pregnant women between 18 and 65 years, we\nexcluded 2804 individuals due to missing information on\nUACR, serum creatinine, or insurance status. We ex-\ncluded 10,298 individuals without albuminuria and seven\nCompared to individuals in the final cohort, individuals\nwho were excluded due to missing UACR were more\ncohort, individuals who were excluded because of miss-\ning insurance were more likely to be younger (35.2 vs\nDefinition of variables\nAlbuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio [UACR]  30 mg/g. Estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the 2012\nCKD Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation\n[16]. We used the formula for correction of serum\ncreatinine recommended in the NHANES III Data\nFile Documentation [17]. Hypertension was defined as\npertensive medications. Diabetes was defined as a history\nof diabetes, use of insulin or other medication to treat dia-\nbetes, a fasting blood glucose level 126 mg/dl, or a ran-\ndom blood glucose level 200 mg/dl. Hypercholesterolemia\nwas a total cholesterol concentration 200 mg/dL. History\nof cardiovascular disease was defined by an affirma-\ntive answer to at least one of the following: history of\nheart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke. Insur-\nance status was obtained by patient self-report. At the\ntime of interview patients were asked if they were\ncovered by Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS/VA/mili-\ntary insurance or private insurance in the last month.\nThe answers were categorized as uninsured (none of\nthe above), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid),\nor private (all other) insurance.\nOutcome ascertainment\nMortality follow-up\nVital status was established using the NHANES III Linked\nMortality File which provided follow-up for mortality\nFig. 1 Study population and exclusions\nused to link NHANES III participants with the National\nDeath Index (NDI) to ascertain vital status. Matching was\nbased on 12 identifiers for each participant (e.g., Social Se-\ncurity number, sex, and date of birth). Participants who\nwere not matched with any death records were considered\nto be alive through the follow-up period. Cause of death\nwas assigned by the NCHS based on the International\nClassification of Diseases, 10th Revision [18]. For this\nstudy, cardiovascular mortality was defined as death due\nto diseases of the heart, essential hypertension and hyper-\ntensive kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, athero-\nsclerosis, and other diseases/disorders of the circulatory\nStatistical analysis\nNCHS recommendations were followed to account for\nstratification and clustering in the survey design, as well\nas oversampling of ethnic minorities and elderly persons\n[17]. Continuous variables were expressed as weighted\nmeans (standard error) and categorical variables as\nweighted percentage. Baseline characteristics were com-\npared across insurance status using analysis of variance\nfor continuous variables and chi square for categorical\nvariables.\nWeighted age-adjusted all-cause and cardiovascular\nmortality rates were calculated by 1000 person/year. Cox\nproportional hazards models were used to determine the\nassociation of insurance status with all-cause and cardio-\nvascular mortality in patients with albuminuria adjusting\nfor important covariates in a hierarchical fashion: 1)\nModel 1: sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race/eth-\nnicity, income, education, and marital status); 2) Model\n2: Variables included in Model 1 plus co-morbidities\n(diabetes mellitus status, cardiovascular disease, smok-\ning, body mass index, and cancer); 3) Model 3: Variables\nincluded in Model 2 plus co-morbidity severity (eGFR,\nsystolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and hemoglobin\nA1C); and 4) Model 4: Variables included in Model 3 plus\nco-morbidity management (use of statin, use of ACEi). In\naddition, we evaluated for the presence of interaction be-\ntween insurance status and age, gender, and race/ethnicity\non all-cause mortality by adding interaction terms in\nthe fully adjusted models. The proportional hazards\nassumption of the Cox models was examined using\nSchoenfeld residuals.\nResults\nIn our study population (Table 1), the mean age at the\ntime of the interview was 42 years, 63 % of participants\nwere women, 67 % were non-Hispanic White, 16 % were\nnon-Hispanic Black, 6 % were Mexican American and\n11 % were of other racial/ethnic background. In\naddition, approximately 37 % had income less than\n200 % FPL, 74 % had less than high school education\nand 64 % were married. In this sample of NHANES par-\nticipants, 40 % of participants reported excellent or very\ngood health, 36 % had hypertension, 24 % had diabetes,\n44 % had hypercholesterolemia, and 6 % reported car-\ndiovascular disease. The mean eGFR was 102 mL/min/\nThe weighted prevalence of uninsured, public insur-\nively. Compared to individuals with private insurance,\nthose with public insurance or no insurance were signifi-\ncantly more likely to belong to a racial/ethnic minority\ngroup, to have income <200 % FPL, and to have less\nthan high school education (p < 0.05 for each compari-\nson). Uninsured individuals were younger and less likely\nto report a usual source of care than their insured coun-\nterparts (private or public), all p < 0.05. Individuals with\npublic insurance differed from their privately (and non-\ninsured counterparts) in that they were more likely to be\nnon-Hispanic Black, to report fair/poor health, to be\npreviously married, and to have hypertension, diabetes\nor cardiovascular disease, all p < 0.05. There were no sig-\nnificant differences in mean eGFR, UACR, statin use, or\nACE-i use by insurance status.\nAll-cause and cardiovascular mortality by insurance status\nand access to care for individuals with albuminuria\nThe age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate for individuals\nCrude rates of all-cause mortality were higher in in the\nuninsured and individuals with public insurance than in\nspectively).

Uninsured individuals with albumin-\nuria had nearly a three-fold higher risk for all-cause\nmortality than their privately insured counterparts after\ncontrolling for socioeconomic and clinical characteristic.\nSimilar to our findings, the Kidney Early Evaluation Pro-\ngram (KEEP), a community-based health screening pro-\ngram, found an increased risk for death in uninsured\nparticipants with CKD stages 1\u00ad2 as compared to those\nwith private insurance [20]. Our study provides corrob-\norative evidence in a sample representative of the US\npopulation.\nWe found that in a working age, US population with\nalbuminuria, 15 % were uninsured, 18 % had public in-\nsurance, and 67 % had private insurance. Uninsurance\nwas higher than a previous examination of uninsured\nadults with CKD because we looked only at individuals\nyounger than 65 whom comprise over 90 % of the unin-\nsured with CKD [21]. Our uninsurance rate was closer\nto Wilper et al. who also used NHANES to examine\nuninsurance in working age adults [5, 22].\nIn the general population, the association of uninsur-\nance with increased risk for mortality is well established\n[5, 23, 24]. However, the relationship between insurance\nstatus and outcomes has not been as well studied in the\nCKD population. In a cross-sectional analysis of data\nfrom NHANES, uninsured individuals with CKD were\nless likely to have controlled hypertension or to receive\nan angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) than\nthose with insurance [21, 25]. At the time of our study,\nrates of both ACEi and statin use were low in the gen-\neral population [26, 27]. Although we did not find a sig-\nnificant difference in rates of ACEi use across insurance\ncategories, adding ACEi and statin to our final model in-\ncreased both the magnitude and significance of the asso-\nciation between uninsurance and mortality. These\nfindings suggest that ACE/statin are important media-\ntors of the association or that they are potentially in the\ncausal pathway.\nPublicly insured individuals with albuminuria also had\na significantly higher all-cause mortality rate than their\nprivately insured counterparts. This finding was true\nboth in the crude model and after adjusting for socio-\neconomic and clinical characteristics. For most working-\nage adults, eligibility for public insurance is dependent\non income and poor health [28]. In a national survey\ndata study, Sorlie et al. also reported increased mortal-\nity in individuals with public insurance as compared to\nthose with employer provided insurance [29]. Sorlie\nalso found that in certain groups, public insurance was\nassociated with increased mortality compared to unin-\nOur findings that health insurance is an important\npredictor of mortality in individuals with kidney disease,\nmany of whom had early signs of kidney disease, has im-\nportant implications in the current climate of healthcare\nreform.

The uninsurance rate\nfor working age adults, 18\u00ad64 years old, was estimated\npoor working adults saw the largest gains in insurance\ncoverage, particularly in Medicaid expansion states [1].\nHowever, the uninsured have gained coverage through a\ncombination of expansion of employer-based coverage,\nhealth insurance exchanges, extended parental coverage,\nand Medicaid expansion [30]. More individuals may\npotentially benefit given the current eligibility, and re-\nquirement, for nearly all working age adults to obtain in-\nsurance. In addition, the association of public insurance\nwith increased mortality will likely be reduced as eligibil-\nity is based on income rather than health status.\nTable 1 Characteristics of individuals with albuminuria (age < 65) overall and stratified by insurance status (Continued)\nUACR\nNote: History of CVD is defined as has history of heart failure or stroke\nTable 2 Mortality rate by insurance status for individuals with\nalbuminuria\nVariable (N = 915) Age-adjusted mortality\nperson-year\nAge-adjusted mortality\nperson-year\nInsurance status\n(ref: Private)\nWe found a less convincing relationship between in-\nsurance status and cardiovascular mortality. The unin-\nsured did not have a significantly different CV mortality\nthan their privately insured counterparts. This finding\nseems surprising given the importance of medical care\nin managing cardiovascular risk factors and intervening\non cardiovascular events. One possible explanation is\nthat uninsured individuals with CKD and CV disease\nmay remain uninsured for less time than their healthier\ncounterparts. Due either to the number or severity of\nCV risk factors, they are more likely to meet criteria for\npublic insurance. One final explanation is that since\neveryone regardless of insurance status is eligible for\nmedical care during a cardiovascular emergency, the ef-\nfect of insurance status on access to life-saving CV care\nis less important.\nOur study had several limitations. Because of the\ndesign of NHANES, we only had access to a single\nUACR and eGFR determination, rather than the mul-\ntiple measures. However, prior studies have used this\nmethod to ascertain CKD [21, 26]. In addition, we\nwere able to determine insurance status only at a sin-\ngle point in time. Patients may have had only a lim-\nited period of uninsurance or insured patients may\nhave subsequently lost their insurance. Nonetheless,\nour classification of insurance status based on a single\nassessment was associated with significant differences\nin long-term outcomes.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, in a nationally representative sample of\nindividuals with albuminuria and preserved eGFR, both\nuninsurance and public insurance were associated with\nincreased mortality compared to private insurance, even\nafter controlling for sociodemographic, health status,\nand health care variables. Given the burdens of kidney\ndisease both to the affected individuals, families, and the\nhealth care system, we must wait to see if efforts to pro-\nvide comprehensive health care--by improving access to\ncare and the quality of care received--will be able to\nhelp to reduce costs, morbidity and mortality for those\nwith early evidence of CKD.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are\navailable in the National Center for Health Statistics data\nrepository.
