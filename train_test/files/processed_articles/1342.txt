Elevated CRP and low serum bicarbonate are\nindependently associated with hypoalbuminemia, explaining\nmuch of the high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in chronic\nkidney disease.\nKey words: nutrition, GFR, bicarbonate, CRP.\nC 2004 by the International Society of Nephrology\nHypoalbuminemia predicts long-term outcomes for\nboth hospitalized [1, 2] and apparently healthy individu-\nals [3, 4], and is the strongest widely available predictor of\nsurvival in patients treated with maintenance dialysis [5\u00ad\n7]. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\nstudy demonstrated a strong cross-sectional association\nbetween hypoalbuminemia and lower glomerular filtra-\ntion rate (GFR) among patients with moderate to ad-\nvanced kidney dysfunction [8]. Similar results have been\nfound in several, though not all, smaller studies that ex-\namined this relationship [9]. Two potentially important\nconfounders of this association, which to date have not\nbeen quantitated, are the effect of acidosis and inflam-\nmation, neither of which were examined in relation to\nserum albumin in the MDRD study. The potential role\nof acidosis may be especially important because hypobi-\ncarbonatonemia can be readily and safely corrected with\noral alkali supplementation [10].\nHypoalbuminemiaistypicallypresentatthetimeofini-\ntiatingdialysis[11,12],anditstronglypredictssubsequent\nhospitalization rates [13], as well as the adjusted annual\nmortality rate, which, within the United States, continues\nto exceed 22% [14]. This poor survival rate has persisted\ndespite multiple interventions aimed at the dialysis pop-\nulation, and has recently focused attention on strategies\naimed at maintaining the health of patients during the pe-\nriod of progressive kidney dysfunction, as distinct from\nwaiting until the patient requires dialysis and then try-\ning to reverse established deficits [15]. In recognition of\nthis need, the United States Congress has recently leg-\nislated the extension of nutritional supervision to Medi-\ncare recipients with moderate or severe kidney disease;\nhowever, to date there is almost no population-based evi-\ndence as to what the optimal targets should be for several\nkey nutritional parameters, including serum bicarbonate.\nThis issue is one of major public health importance be-\ncause over 5.6 million subjects within the United States\nalone are estimated to have moderate-to-severe chronic\n1032 Eustace et al: Hypoalbuminemia in moderate CKD\nkidney disease [16], while the number of patients devel-\noping end-stage renal disease is increasing in a exponen-\ntial fashion, with rapidly escalating health care costs [14].\nKnowledge of the relationship of acidosis and inflam-\nmation with hypoalbuminemia at different levels of GFR\nis, thus, essential if the results of nutritional screening\nprograms are to be appropriately interpreted, and if the\npotential health and financial benefits of the nutritional\nscreeningofpatientswith chronic kidney disease are to be\nrealized. We therefore performed the following analysis\nusing data from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey III (NHANES III), a large, cross-sectional\nstudy that is representative of the non-institutionalized\nUnited States population, with the purpose of examin-\ning the relationship of acidosis and inflammation with\nreduced GFR and, specifically, to examine the con-\nfounding effect that these factors exert of the observed\nassociation of moderate-severe reductions in GFR and\nhypoalbuminemia.\nMETHODS\nand older who participated in NHANES III, a cross-\nNational Center for Health Statistics, which used a com-\nplex, multistage, clustered sampling design to provide\nnationally representative data on the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized United States population [17]. Non-\nHispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans, and the elderly\nwere deliberately over-sampled to allow more precise es-\ntimates of effects within these subgroups.\nLaboratory methods\nAlbumin was measured using the bromocresol purple\nmethod, with a coefficient of variation that ranged be-\ntween 0.5% to 3.4% during the six years of study. C-\nreactive protein (CRP) was measured by latex-enhanced\nnephelometry (Behring Diagnostics, Inc., Somerville, NJ,\nUSA),withthelowerlimitofdetectionof0.22mg/dL,and\na coefficient of variation between 3.3% and 16.1%.\nSerum bicarbonate was measured on Hitachi model\n737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Di-\nagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Specimens were han-\ndled anerobically and frozen at \u00ad70C. Before analysis,\nthe specimens were gradually thawed over 1 hour, then\nimmediately upon opening the storage vial they were\nmanually sampled, thereby avoiding any loss of CO2\nwith\nan associated spurious decrease in the measured total\n[18]. Samples were analyzed using the phosphe-\nnolpyruvate method, which measures serum bicarbon-\nate level as well as the much smaller (<0.1%) carbonate\nand carbamino factions. The normal reference range for\nthe method is 23\u00ad29 mmol/L, and over the course of the\nstudy the median (range) coefficient of variation was 2.5\ndietary recalls, collected by a trained dietary interviewer\nusing an automated, computer-based interview and\ncoding system.

Although\nthe effect size of this relationship is modest, this must be\nseen within the context of the very strong relationship\nbetween hypoalbuminemia and poor patient outcomes\n[6]. This observation is especially important because hy-\npobicarbonatemia may be readily and inexpensively cor-\nrected in an outpatient setting by the use of oral alkali,\nand we believe that the potential benefit of such ther-\napy in chronic kidney disease needs to be evaluated in an\nappropriate clinical trial.\nInflammation by up-regulating proteolysis [31] and by\nincreasing anorexia [32] would be expected to exacer-\nbate hypoalbuminemia. Inflammation is an established\nrisk factor for dialysis-associated hypoalbuminemia [33,\n34], where it is usually attributed to blood-dialyzer inter-\nactions, to impurities within the dialysate, or to coexisting\ndisease. We show that the presence of elevated levels of\nacute-phase reactants occurs in a substantial percentage\nof subjects in association with moderate reductions in\nGFR, and long before the need of requiring dialysis. This\nobservation is supported by the results of several recent\nThe reason for this elevation in CRP with azotemia is\nunclear. There is no significant net excretion of CRP by\nthe kidney [38].

Re-\ngardless of its cause, the proposed association between\nprogressive azotemia and up-regulated inflammation is\nespecially important, as several studies have implicated\neven low levels of inflammation with the development\nof atherosclerotic disease, both in the general population\ntionship may provide an important link explaining the\nobserved association of malnutrition with cardiovascular\nLimitations of our study include its cross-sectional\ndesign, which allows us to identify associations, but\nwhich cannot establish causation.

However, the direction of such a bias would sug-\ngest that the prospective association between decreasing\nGFR and these variables may be stronger that the ob-\nserved cross-sectional associations.

More-\nover, because of the limited number of subjects within the\nGFR of 15\u00ad29 mL/min category and within the albumin\nto creatinine ratio >1.0 category, the precision of these\nestimates is particularly limited.\nWe chose to use estimated GFR in the above analy-\nses due to the non-linear relationship of serum creatinine\nwith GFR and we opted for the modified MDRD equa-\ntion as it does not incorporate serum albumin, which was\nour primary outcome variable. The validity of this equa-\ntion in patients with very low serum creatinine and a re-\nsulting elevated estimated GFR is uncertain. Our analysis\nfound a GFR greater than 150 to be independently asso-\nciated with hypoalbuminemia, a finding which was not\nexplained by the prevalence of either diabetes or preg-\nnancy within the study population. Instead, we suspect\nthat a subset of individuals in the highest GFR category\nmay, in fact, have had a lower true GFR but were misclas-\nsified by the MDRD equation due to decreased muscle\nmass, and consequently, low serum creatinine level in the\nsetting of malnutrition.

On univariate analysis, GFR and dietary intake\nwere associated with hypoalbuminemia, but on multivari-\nate analysis these effects were markedly attenuated. The\nfinding of a high prevalence of inflammatory changes,\nand the strong association of elevated levels of inflam-\nmation with diminished kidney function, needs careful\nprospective confirmation, but may provide a marker for\npatients at high risk of malnutrition and serve to explain\nsome of the greatly accelerated cardiovascular risk seen\nwith malnourished patients which is evident from the\ntime that they first initiate dialysis. The observed as-\nsociation between acidosis and hypoalbuminemia may\npresent an important and currently underutilized oppor-\ntunity for the optimization of nutrition in patients with\nchronic kidney disease. In total, these results support the\nneed for early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, and\nfor prospective studies to identify the optimal manage-\nment of patients with progressive kidney dysfunction, if\nthe long-term health of such patients is to be successfully\nprotected.\nEustace et al: Hypoalbuminemia in moderate CKD 1039\n"
