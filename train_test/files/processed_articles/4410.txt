This study aimed to\nexplore a rapid IFX-quantification test from a clinical perspective.\nMethods: This manuscript describes a prospective cohort study involving 110 ulcerative colitis\n(UC) patients on the maintenance phase of IFX. IFX trough levels were quantified using a rapid\nquantification assay and a commonly-used reference kit.\nResults: Irrespective of the assay used to measure IFX, its through levels were statistically\ndifferent between patients with and without endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic score\n= 0), as well as between patients stratified by their faecal calprotectin (FC) levels. Despite\nthe fact that the two methods correlated well with each other [Spearman's rank correlation\ninterval (CI): 0.791\u00ad0.903], there was a discernible systematic variation; values obtained with\nthe reference kit were on average 2.62 units higher than those obtained with the rapid assay.\nNotwithstanding, 3 \u00b5g/ml was shown to be an acceptable cut-off to assess endoscopic status\nand inflammatory burden levels using both assays. The percentage of patients that had a\npositive outcome when the IFX concentration measured by the rapid assay ranked above 3 \u00b5g/\nml was 88% both for a Mayo endoscopic score  1 and for an FC concentration <250 \u00b5g/g.\nConclusions: Based on this study, we concluded that using the rapid IFX assessment system\nwith a 3 \u00b5g/ml threshold is a reliable alternative to the time-consuming enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assays in patients on the maintenance phase of IFX.\n",

In the case of inflammatory bowel\ndiseases [IBDs, which include Crohn's disease\n(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)], the use of\nanti-TNF agents has led to a decrease in\nhospitalization rates, risk of surgery and health-\nrelated costs.1\nHowever, and despite the anti-TNF success in the\ntreatment of many IBD patients, some of them do\nnot respond to the drug during the induction phase,\nwhereas others experience a loss of response later\nduring treatment.2 Accumulating evidence from the\nliterature suggests that the outcomes of CD and UC\npatients on infliximab (IFX) are strongly related\nClinical performance of an infliximab rapid\nquantification assay\nFernando Magro, Joana Afonso, Susana Lopes, Rosa Coelho, Raquel Gon\u00e7alves,\nPaulo Caldeira, Paula Lago, Helena Tavares de Sousa, Jaime Ramos,\nAna Rita Gon\u00e7alves, Paula Ministro, Isadora Rosa, T\u00e2nia Meira,\nPatr\u00edcia Andrade, Jo\u00e3o-Bruno Soares, Diana Carvalho, Paula Sousa,\nAna Isabel Vieira, Joanne Lopes, Cl\u00e1udia Camila Dias, Karel Geboes\nand F\u00e1tima Carneiro, on behalf of the Portuguese IBD Study Group (GEDII)\n Keywords: infliximab, ulcerative colitis, therapeutic window\nCorrespondence to:\nFernando Magro\nDepartment of\nBiomedicine, Unity\nof Pharmacology and\nTherapeutics, Faculty of\nMedicine, University of\nPorto, Porto, Portugal\nfm@med.up.pt\nJoana Afonso\nDepartment of\nBiomedicine, Unity\nof Pharmacology and\nTherapeutics, Faculty of\nMedicine, University of\nPorto, Porto, Portugal\nMedInUP, Centre for Drug\nDiscovery and Innovative\nMedicines, University of\nPorto, Porto, Portugal\nSusana Lopes\nRosa Coelho\nPatr\u00edcia Andrade\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o,\nPorto, Portugal\nRaquel Gon\u00e7alves\nJo\u00e3o-Bruno Soares\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Hospital de\nBraga, Braga, Portugal\nPaulo Caldeira\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar do Algarve,\nFaro, Portugal\nPaula Lago\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar do Porto, Porto,\nPortugal\nHelena Tavares de Sousa\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar do Algarve,\nPortim\u00e3o, Portugal\nDepartment of Medical\nBiosciences and Medicine,\nUniversity of Algarve, Faro,\nPortugal\nAlgarve Biomedical\nCentre (ABC), University of\nAlgarve, Portugal\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(9)\n652 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nwith the levels of the drug found in the organism.3\u00ad10\nFrom a physician's perspective, understanding the\nreasons that lead to unresponsiveness is key to delin-\neate future therapeutic strategies, which can include\na dose intensification, a switch to another anti-\nTNF agent, or adding immunosuppressive drugs\nor steroids. In this context, the precise and accurate\nmeasurement of the circulating drug levels, known\nas therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), has a key\nrole. Several TDM-based algorithms and dash-\nboards are being developed to assist the physician in\nMoreover, TDM may also be useful to identify\ncases with supra-therapeutic drug levels (which can\nbe de-escalated to prevent the appearance of adverse\neffects), and has been proven as a cost-effective\nstrategy when compared with the traditional empir-\nical-based adjustment of drug dosage.14,15\nGiven the importance of TDM in patients on IFX,\none can easily find a number of different commer-\ncial kits that can measure the concentration of this\nagent from the patient's serum, most of them rely-\ning on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) approach. However, these kits have a turn-\naround time of approximately 8 h, delaying the IFX\ndose adjustment to the following infusion (usually\n6\u00ad8 weeks later). A rapid IFX-quantification sys-\ntem, which allows a fast (15 min) assessment of IFX\nfrom a patient's serum, has been recently launched\nin the market by the B\u00fchlmann\u00ae company\n(Sch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland). Not only does this\nsystem allows an immediate adjustment of the IFX\ndosage, but it also has the advantage of being a user-\nfriendly desktop device, which can be easily oper-\nated by any nurse, technician or physician without\nthe requirement of specific laboratory facilities.\nWe have recently validated the utilisation of the\nB\u00fchlmann\u00ae rapid assay in a laboratorial context,\nand concluded that this kit constitutes a reliable\nand fast alternative to the traditional ELISA\nkits.16 In this study we aimed to take a step further\nand to assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity\nof this rapid assay, by addressing the existence\nand interpretability of IFX cut-off values able to\nguide the therapeutic decision-making process.\nMaterial and methods\nCohort\nUC patients on the maintenance phase of IFX\ntherapy were prospectively and consecutively\nrecruited from 10 different university and commu-\nnity hospitals. Only patients older than 18 years\nand with at least 14 weeks of IFX treatment were\ninvited to participate. Exclusion criteria included\nhistory of malignancy in the previous 5 years,\nopportunistic infections or demyelinating diseases;\nexistence of adenomatous polyps or known viral\ninfections; and pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nThis study was approved by the ethic committee\nof all hospitals involved and by the Portuguese\nData Protection Authority. All patients enrolled\nsigned an informed written consent.\nIFX-quantification assays\nA total of 110 samples collected from the same\nnumber of patients were assayed to determine their\nserum trough IFX levels using two different com-\nmercial kits: Quantum Blue\u00ae Infliximab:\nQuantitative Lateral Flow Assay (B\u00fchlmann,\nSch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland), hereafter referred to\nas QB, and Level Infliximab M2920 kit (Sanquin,\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands), hereafter referred to\nas Sanquin. Both kits were used strictly following\nmanufacturers' instructions. The lower and upper\nlimits of quantification were 0.4 \u00b5g/ml and 20 \u00b5g/ml\n\u00b5g/ml (1:1500) for the Sanquin assay, respectively.\nWhenever the results obtained were below or above\nthese limits of quantification, they were considered\nto be at those same limits. Sanquin was chosen as\nthe reference test as it is a widely used kit in both\nlaboratorial and clinical contexts. All measure-\nments were carried out by the same researcher.\nAssessment of disease outcomes\nDisease status, including clinical evaluation,\nendoscopic and histological activity, and quantifi-\ncation of faecal calprotectin (FC), was assessed at\nthe same time as the IFX concentration (i.e.\nimmediately before an IFX infusion).\nClinical evaluation.Clinical remission was evalu-\nated according to the global Mayo score. Patients\nwere considered to be in clinical remission if their\nglobal Mayo score was 2 and no individual sub-\nscore was above 1.\nEndoscopic evaluation.Endoscopic activity was\nevaluated using the Mayo endoscopic subscore:17\nmucosal healing was defined as a Mayo endo-\nscopic subscore equal to 0 or 1.\nJaime Ramos\nDiana Carvalho\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar de Lisboa,\nLisboa, Portugal\nAna Rita Gon\u00e7alves\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Centro\nHospitalar Lisboa Norte,\nLisboa, Portugal\nPaula Ministro\nPaula Sousa\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Hospital de S.\nTeot\u00f3nio, Viseu, Portugal\nIsadora Rosa\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Instituto\nPortugu\u00eas de Oncologia de\nLisboa, Lisboa, Portugal\nT\u00e2nia Meira\nAna Isabel Vieira\nGastroenterology\nDepartment, Hospital\nGarcia de Orta, Almada,\nPortugal\nJoanne Lopes\nDepartment of Pathology,\nCentro Hospitalar S\u00e3o\nJo\u00e3o, Porto, Portugal\nCl\u00e1udia Camila Dias\nDepartment of Community\nMedicine, Information and\nHealth Decision Sciences,\nFaculty of Medicine of\nthe University of Porto,\nPortugal\nCINTESIS, Centre for\nHealth Technology and\nServices Research, Porto,\nPortugal\nKarel Geboes\nDepartment of Pathology,\nUniversity Hospital of\nKU Leuven and UZ Gent,\nLeuven, Belgium\nF\u00e1tima Carneiro\nDepartment of Pathology,\nCentro Hospitalar S\u00e3o\nJo\u00e3o, Porto, Portugal\nInstitute of Molecular\nPathology and Immunology\nof the University of Porto\n[Ipatimup], Porto, Portugal\nF Magro, J Afonso et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 653\nHistological evaluation.The presence of histologi-\ncal inflammation was evaluated through the anal-\nysis of an average of two biopsy samples from the\nsigmoid and the rectum.

All the\nreported p-values were two-sided, and p-values\n<0.05 were considered to be statistically signifi-\ncant. The ability of the measured IFX concentra-\ntions to assess the various disease outcomes was\nevaluated by plotting Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic curves and computing the Area\nUnder the Curve.

The results show that IFX\ntrough levels were higher in patients who had\npositive outcomes irrespective of the assay used,\nand these results were significant for endoscopic\nremission (using endoscopic Mayo score = 0 as\nthe criterion for remission) and FC.\nWe then applied different IFX cut-offs (from\n1\u00ad10) to the results obtained from each kit, and\nassessed their ability to predict patient outcomes.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive\nvalue (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),\naccuracy and Kappa for each case are depicted\nin Supplementary Table 1. A positive test was\ndefined as having an IFX level below the cut-off,\nwhereas the disease status was defined as having\na negative outcome (not being in clinical remis-\nsion, having an endoscopic Mayo score >0 or\n>1, or having an FC level >250 \u00b5g/g). NPV rep-\nresents the percentage of patients who have a\npositive outcome (no disease) among those who\nhave an IFX above the defined cut-off (negative\ntest result), whereas PPV represents the percent-\nage of patients who have a negative outcome\n(disease) among those that have an IFX below\nthe defined cut-off (positive test result).\nPerceptively, the performance values vary widely\nwith the cut-off chosen and the outcome evaluated,\nbut are considerably similar for both kits when the\nconditions mentioned are kept stable (i.e. same\ncut-off and outcome). Figure 2 represents the accu-\nracy (i.e. the sum of true positives and negatives) of\nthe results obtained with either QB or Sanquin in\nterms of clinical status, endoscopic score and FC\nlevel using different cut-offs. The results show that\nSanquin and QB have a very similar variation of the\naccuracy along the different cut-offs. Overall, a\nvalue of 3 \u00b5g/ml seems to be an acceptable cut-off\nfor QB, although lower values could be considered\nin a few situations.\nNPV has an important role in this context, as it\nrepresents the percentage of patients who have an\nIFX concentration above the cut-off and would\nnot benefit from a drug adjustment.

This study aimed to assess\nthe clinical sensitivity and specificity of this rapid\nassay, by using it to measure samples from 110\npatients, fully characterized regarding their clini-\ncal, endoscopic and inflammatory burden status.\nFigure 2.

The Sanquin\nkit's bias towards measuring higher values when\ncompared with other kits has been noticed\nbefore.16,19 Overall, other methodological com-\nparisons involving two or more IFX-quantification\nassays show that, most of the times, the assays\ncompare quite well against each other (even when\nthey are not ELISA-based), but systematic devia-\ntions are rather common and are likely to result\nfrom the fact that different assays use different\nantibodies with varying IFX affinities.19\u00ad25\nThe association of IFX serum levels with disease\noutcomes or inflammatory markers such as clinical\nresponse, clinical remission, mucosal healing, endo-\nscopic improvement and C-reactive protein levels\nour results show that IFX trough levels were signifi-\ncantly lower when patients had an endoscopic Mayo\nscore 1 or an FC concentration 250 \u00b5g/g. A\nsimilar pattern was found for clinical remission and\nfor an endoscopic Mayo score >0 (i.e. patients who\nhave a negative outcome had lower IFX trough lev-\nels), although in this case the results were not sig-\nnificant. This might be due to the small size of the\ncohort, or to the fact that the patients analysed were\nvery stable, most of them (80%) in clinical remis-\nsion according to the Montreal classification and\nwith over 14 weeks of IFX therapy (primary nonre-\nsponders were excluded).\nGiven the systematic differences encountered in\nthe quantification, one would expect the two dif-\nferent methods to have different clinical cut-offs.\nHowever, that is not the case: 3 \u00b5g/ml is an accept-\nable threshold for both assays particularly in what\nconcerns assessment of endoscopic status and\ninflammatory burden (measured by the FC lev-\nels). Regarding clinical status, although 3 \u00b5g/ml\nmay be a satisfactory cut-off, values of 1 and 2 \u00b5g/\nml can be considered for the Sanquin and QB\nassays, respectively. These cut-offs have a margin-\nally better accuracy and smaller NPV when com-\npared with 3 \u00b5g/ml. The same holds true for IFX\ncut-offs of 1 and 2 \u00b5g/ml when addressing endo-\nscopic activity using an endoscopic Mayo score\n1 as criterion for remission: the accuracy raises\nand the NPV drops when compared with those of\na cut-off of 3 \u00b5g/ml. Concerning deep remission,\nhowever, the different cut-offs seem to behave\nsimilarly and it is not easy to choose a single value.\nThis is likely related to the fact that deep remis-\nsion is a composite endpoint, and therefore reflects\nthe different behaviours of its components.\nThe lack of impact of the systematic bias observed\nin the optimal clinical cut-off is easily explained\nby observing the Bland\u00adAltman plot: in fact, this\nplot shows that the differences encountered in the\nvalues measured by both methods are particularly\nclose to 0 for IFX levels <5 \u00b5g/ml. In other words,\nat levels as low as those considered for the clinical\nthreshold, the assays seem to behave in a similar\nfashion. This is supported by the comparative\nanalysis of the assay's results, which shows that\nfor a threshold of 3 \u00b5g/ml, 88% of the patients fall\nequally above or below the cut-off irrespective of\nthe method used.\nTable 3.

A cut-off of 3 \u00b5g/ml\nhas considerably high NPVs, which means that it\ncan exclude patients from benefiting of an IFX\ndose adjustment with a considerable degree of cer-\ntainty. Conversely, the PPVs are rather low, which\nmeans that having an IFX trough concentration\nbelow the defined cut-off does not necessarily\nimply having clinical activity, endoscopic lesions\nor a high inflammatory burden. In other words,\nnot all patients with IFX levels below the cut-off\nwill benefit from a dose intensification, and such a\ndecision must be contextualized with other indica-\ntors (such as symptomatology, presence of anti-\nbodies to IFX and biomarkers).\nThe 3 \u00b5g/ml (or closer) cut-off has been often\ncut-offs are deeply related to the method used\nand outcome being assessed, and studies such as\nthese are absolutely necessary to validate thresh-\nolds and explore their interpretability.

On the other hand, and as a limitation,\none should point out that the sample size was\nrelatively small, although similar to that used in\nrence and amount of anti-IFX in the clinical sam-\nples was not taken into consideration.\nIn conclusion, we have explored the applicability\nof IFX trough level cut-offs using a recently\nlaunched rapid QB test and comparing it with a\nwidely used ELISA kit. Overall, both assays have\na good quantitative and qualitative agreement,\nand a cut-off of 3 \u00b5g/ml seems to be appropriate,\nnamely when one is assessing the endoscopic sta-\ntus (using an endoscopic Mayo score = 0 as the\ncriterion for remission) or the inflammatory\nburden. Different cut-offs can be considered for\nspecific situations, and this ultimately depends on\nwhether the user wants to optimize the accuracy\nor the NPV of the results.\n"
