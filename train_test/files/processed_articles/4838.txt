Research shows that individ-\nuals differ widely in their answers to these questions and,\nconsequently, whether they endorse an idealist or a cynical\nview of human nature (Bond et al., 2004; Cook & Medley,\ndefine cynical beliefs about human nature (briefly referred to as\ncynicism) as a dispositional construct reflecting individual dif-\nferences in core evaluations of human nature as good or evil.\nCynical beliefs involve a negative appraisal of other people's\nintentions and motives and a tendency to view most people\nwith suspicion and distrust.\nCynical beliefs about human nature have been shown to\nhave negative consequences for a wide range of individuals'\nlife outcomes. Cynicism has been found to be one of the most\nimportant predictors of bad health, including increased likeli-\nhood of coronary heart disease, dementia, depression, and risk\nSmith, 1992). Negative consequences of holding cynical\nbeliefs extend to interpersonal relationships (Baron et al.,\ntive well-being (Chen et al., 2015), job satisfaction (Leung, Ip,\n& Leung, 2010), and career success (Stavrova & Ehlebracht,\n2016). Cynicism is also thought of as a source of negative\noutcomes for whole societies, hindering national economic\ngrowth, undermining democracy and civic engagement, and\nproviding fertile soil for crime and corruption (Knack & Kee-\nDespite cynicism's deleterious consequences, very little is\nknown about factors that prevent its development. Herein, we\nexplore the role of educational attainment as an antidote to\ncynicism. Existing literature has promoted the idea of educa-\ntion as a means against close-mindedness, intolerance, and dis-\ntrust of the differently minded (Coenders & Scheepers, 2003;\nOsborne & Sibley, 2015). In particular, education endows indi-\nviduals with a sense of personal control (Lewis, Ross, & Mir-\nowsky, 1999) and therefore might help them overcome\nfeelings of vulnerability and suspiciousness. Although a mod-\nerate negative correlation between cynicism and education has\nbeen repeatedly reported in the literature (Carroll, Smith, Shef-\nStavrova & Ehlebracht, 2016), it remains to be investigated\n1 Department of Social Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the\nNetherlands\n2 University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nOlga Stavrova, Department of Social Psychology, Tilburg University, PO Box\nEmail: o.stavrova@uvt.nl\nSocial Psychological and\nPersonality Science\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/spp\nwhether education is related to the development of cynical\nbeliefs in the long run.\nTheoretical Background\nEducation is often seen as an important factor promoting open-\nmindedness and tolerance. Highly educated individuals tend to\nscore higher on measures of openness to experience (O'Con-\nlikely to support minorities' rights, and are less likely to\nendorse prejudice and out-group stereotypes (Coenders &\nOsborne & Sibley, 2015). Education provides individuals with\nbetter access to status and power and thus might diminish the\nperception of vulnerability to others' potentially malicious\nintentions. In addition, by developing cognitive skills, educa-\ntion can help individuals build a stronger sense of mastery and\ncontrol over their lives (Schneeweis, Skirbekk, & Winter-\nEbmer, 2014). Indeed, an increased perception of personal con-\ntrol represents one of the most important psychological\nconsequences of education reported in the literature (Eshbaugh,\nPersonal control is widely recognized as a valuable personal\nresource, strengthening individuals' coping ability, subjective\nChapman, Agrigoroaei, Infurna, & Lachman, 2014). Individu-\nals with a strong sense of control tend to believe that they hold\npower over what happens to them and how their life unfolds,\nwhereas individuals with a weak sense of control tend to feel\npowerless and believe that their life depends much on factors\nbeyond their control, such as chance, fate, or other people (Ross\nis believed to include two facets--mastery and perceived con-\nstraints (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Mastery refers to a belief\nin one's ability to achieve the desired outcomes, whereas per-\nceived constraints describe a belief in one's dependence on\nfactors beyond one's control (e.g., other people) in achieving\nthe desired outcomes. In existing research, these facets of\npersonal control are often combined into one scale, although\nin a couple of recent studies, they were analyzed separately\nthat a stronger sense of control (higher mastery and/or lower\nconstraints) might help overcome feelings of vulnerability\nand thus reduce the use of self-protective strategies, such as\nsuspiciousness, hostility, and distrust, which are central to\ncynicism (Pope, Smith, & Rhodewalt, 1990; Vranceanu,\nGallo, & Bogart, 2006). Indeed, prior research has shown that\nfeeling powerless and at others' mercy amplifies suspicion\nIn the present research, we propose that educational attain-\nment endows individuals with a stronger sense of personal con-\ntrol and therefore represents an antidote to the development of\ncynicism. We also investigate whether obtaining a higher level\nof education is associated with less cynicism even if one got off\nto a bad start in life. Existing research suggests that economic\nhardship in childhood promotes the development of cynicism\nin adulthood (Lynch, Kaplan, & Shema, 1997). In fact, individ-\nuals raised in low socioeconomic status (SES) households are\nless likely to show high educational attainment. Therefore,\nwe investigated whether obtaining a high level of education\nis associated with less cynicism in adulthood regardless of\none's starting conditions.\nWe explored these questions using a longitudinal methodol-\nogy. In Study 1, we examined the role of individual differences\nin educational attainment in the endorsement of cynical beliefs\nusing a two-wave longitudinal study of the American popula-\ntion. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in another long-\nitudinal sample and explored the role of personal control as a\npotential mediator of the education effect. As differences in\neducation are related to sociodemographic and economic char-\nacteristics, such as race or income, we included these variables\nas well as basic sociodemographic controls (gender and age) in\nthe analyses in both studies.\nMethod\nWe used the data from the American Changing Lives Study\n(House, 2014), a longitudinal study of the American population\nand 5 (2011) only, we included only the data from these two\nwaves.

However, experiencing economic hardship\nalready in childhood might be more important for the develop-\nment of cynicism than economic conditions later in adulthood\n(Lynch et al., 1997). Growing up in a financially disadvantaged\nhousehold, in an underprivileged, dangerous environment might\nevoke a mind-set of suspiciousness and feelings of vulnerability\nand have a formative influence on individuals' psychological\ndevelopment. Importantly, as childhood economic hardship is\nassociated with lower educational attainment (Breen & Jonsson,\n2005), it might represent a potential confounding in our analyses.\nIn other words, could the negative effect of education demon-\nstrated in Study 1 be explained by a confounding with childhood\neconomic disadvantage? Or might obtaining a higher level of\neducation inhibit the development of cynicism even if one got\noff to a bad start in life? To shed light on this question, in Study\n2, we additionally took into account individual differences in\nchildhood SES.\nImportantly, we examined the proposed psychological\nmechanism of the education effect.

Participants have been surveyed\nevery 2 years since 1992. A measure of cynicism was first\nadded to the survey in 2006 (for one half of the sample) and\nin 2008 (for the other half).

Responses were given on a 6-point agree\u00addisagree\nscale. The two-factorial structure was confirmed in a confirma-\ntory factor analysis that modeled mastery and constraints at t1\nParticipants provided information on the level of their\nfather's and mother's education (number of years in education,\nranging from 0 to 17) and their family's financial situation\nduring their childhood (between birth and age 16; 1 \u00bc poor,\n2 \u00bc about average, 3 \u00bc pretty well off financially). Partici-\npants' responses to these questions were standardized and com-\nbined into a measure of childhood SES (Cronbach's a \u00bc .68).\nAs in Study1, the analyses included participants' age, gen-\nder (1 \u00bc male, 0 \u00bc female), race (1 \u00bc Caucasian, 0 \u00bc Other),\nand log-transformed income at t1 (total annual household\nincome in dollars).\nResults and Discussion\nAs this study included four latent constructs (cynicism, mas-\ntery, constraints, and childhood SES), we started by examining\na measurement model in which manifest variables were\nallowed to load on their respective latent factors and the latent\nfactors were allowed to correlate with each other (Cole &\nMaxwell, 2003). This model reached an acceptable fit,\nSRMR \u00bc .04, suggesting that the manifest variables reflect the\nunderlying constructs they are supposed to measure.\nWe then proceeded to testing measurement invariance of\ncynicism, mastery, and constraints over time. We used the\nsame procedure as in Study 1. Models with free and constrained\nloadings showed good fit (see Supplemental Table S1). A look\nat incremental fit indices shows that putting constraints on fac-\ntor loadings did not deteriorate model fit.4 Therefore, we con-\ncluded that cynicism, mastery, and constraints items reached\nthe level of metric invariance between t1 and t2.\nMeans, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations\namong the variables are shown in Table 3.

In addition, it\nextended the results of Study 1 in two important ways.

We detected this effect in two different\nlarge adult samples that were followed over 9 (Study 1) and\n4 (Study 2) years. High educational attainment was associated\nwith less cynicism regardless of individuals' sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, including income, as well as their childhood\nSES. That is, obtaining a higher level of education acted as\nan antidote to cynical beliefs about human nature even among\nindividuals who had a difficult start in life.\nHow exactly can education contribute to less cynicism?\nDrawing on existing literature on the link between education\nand personal control and the potential of personal control to\ndampen unwarranted suspiciousness and feelings of vulnerabil-\nity, we proposed that a sense of control can represent the psy-\nchological mechanism underlying the education effect.\nFollowing prior research (Lachman & Weaver, 1998), we dif-\nferentiated between mastery, a belief in one's ability to achieve\nthe desired outcomes, and perceived constraints, a belief that\nexternal factors, such as other people or just bad luck interfere\nwith achieving the desired outcomes. The results of the longi-\ntudinal mediation analyses (Study 2) indicated that only per-\nceived constraints (but not mastery) acted as a mediator of\nthe effect of education on cynicism. While higher education\nwas associated with both a stronger perception of mastery and\na weaker perception of constraints, only the latter was related to\nless cynicism. Perception of constraints involves a belief that\none's life is determined by external factors, including other\npeople, and may thus give rise to a feeling of vulnerability.\nIn turn, feeling vulnerable and at other people's mercy are cen-\ntral to suspiciousness and cynical distrust (Pope et al., 1990;\nally consistent with recent research showing that mastery and\nconstraints might have different associations with life out-\nTable 5.

For\nexample, highly educated individuals might have different\nsocial experiences compared to their less educated counter-\nparts. High educational attainment might reduce the likeli-\nhood of becoming victim to deception and exploitation and\nconsequently counteract the perception of the social world\nas a hostile place. In fact, existing research suggests that a\nhostile childhood environment contributes to cynicism devel-\nopment (Meesters, Muris, & Esselink, 1995). Hence, one\npotentially interesting avenue for future research is to exam-\nine to what extent the education effect demonstrated here rests\non individual differences in the exposure to others' malevo-\nlence or kindness.\nOn a related note, education might provide individuals not\nonly with a higher perceived control of their own lives but also\nwith more power over others (e.g., as it can provide access to\nhigh-power positions). While we showed that perceived control\nover one's own life is associated with less cynicism, power\n(i.e., control over others) might have the opposite effect. Stud-\nies have shown power to undermine perspective taking,\nincrease social distance (Blader et al., 2016; Lammers,\nGalinsky, Gordijn, & Otten, 2012), and render individuals\nmore sensitive to unfairness against the self (Sawaoka, Hughes,\n& Ambady, 2015). Most importantly, power gives one reason\nto doubt the purity of the intentions behind others' kindness and\nthus facilitates cynical attributions for others' generous beha-\nvior (Inesi, Gruenfeld, & Galinsky, 2012). It might be interest-\ning to future studies to explore whether holding a position of\npower can fuel the development of cynicism.\nThe present research is not without limitations. We\nacknowledge that both studies are based on only two waves\nof data, which limits our ability to examine individual trajec-\ntories of cynicism development over time as a function of\ntheir education (Singer & Willett, 2003). Another design lim-\nitation is that the information about participants' education\nwas collected years before their cynicism was measured for\nthe first time. Yet, given that we were interested in formal\neducation which is typically completed by the age of 25\u00ad30\n(National Center of Education Statistics, 2016) and both our\nsamples were rather old (mean age over 50), we believe\npotential unrecorded changes in formal education throughout\nthis time to be rather unlikely. At the same time, besides for-\nmal education, individuals might educate themselves inde-\npendently of any formal institution (and highly educated\nindividuals might be more likely to commit to lifelong learn-\ning). Such individual efforts might serve as a more proximal\nmechanism of the effect of formal education reported here and\nis worth further investigations.\nDespite the longitudinal design of the current studies, sug-\ngesting that education leads to less cynicism, the reverse path\nof causality is possible as well. Dispositional cynicism might\nmake one suspicious not only regarding strangers' intentions,\nit might also impair one's openness to new experiences, includ-\ning willingness to absorb new information, openness to new\nideas, and divergent thinking, which might undermine one's\nacademic achievement. We could not explore this possibility\nin the present study, as the majority of respondents were in late\nadulthood and the studies included a measure of education at\njust one time point. We encourage future studies to use samples\nof children and adolescents to examine the potential effect of\ncynical worldviews on educational attainment.\nIn a similar vein, although the longitudinal mediation used\nhere represents a methodological improvement over widely\nused cross-sectional mediation designs (Cole & Maxwell,\n2003), it does not allow making strong causal inferences either\n(Bullock, Green, & Ha, 2010) and might be even confused with\nmathematically equivalent phenomena, such as confounding\n(MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000). Although causal\ninferences regarding the effect of education are difficult,\nresearchers can still explore the causal assumptions behind the\nrole of control in cynicism development. For example, manip-\nulating perceived constraints (e.g., see Stavrova & Meckel,\n2017) to examine their effect on cynical beliefs might be the\nfirst step on this way.\nOverall, as Western societies are increasingly plagued with\nsuspiciousness and cynical distrust (Eisinger, 1999; Twenge,\nCampbell, & Carter, 2014), understanding sources of cynicism\nand factors undermining its development represents an impor-\ntant research endeavor. The present research has contributed to\nthis by uncovering one of the antidotes to cynicism--educa-\ntion. Importantly, as cynicism not only is connected to multiple\nnegative outcomes for individuals but also represents a threat\nfor the functioning of democratic and economic institutions\nfostering investment in education may pave the way for a less\ncynical, more open and, ultimately, successful society.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplemental Material\nThe supplemental material is available in the online version of the\narticle.\nNotes\n1.
