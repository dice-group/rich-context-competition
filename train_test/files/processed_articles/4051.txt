As many scholars\n2007), early studies of pornography tended either to frame\npornography in terms of an effects tradition or a feminist tra-\ndition that has focused on articulation of personal \"affect\"\n(e.g., Allen, d'Alessio, & Brezgel, 1995; Fisher & Grenier,\ncated\" (Juffer, 1998, p. 8) from the production, circulation,\nand consumption of pornography. The academic dislocation\nfrom pornography consumption is particularly salient\nbecause, as Alan McKee (2005) points out, while consumers\nof pornography are often objects of research, they are \"rarely\npresented as subjects in the sense of being the thinking agents\nwho could offer an insight into the reasons for consuming\npornography and the effects it could have on them\" (p. 71).\nSuch an absence of consumers' voices is filled by a col-\nlection of work that explores specifically either the gender\ndifferences in pornography use (Brown & L'Engle, 2009; S.\n2006; Janghorbani, Lam, & The Youth Sexuality Study Task\nromantic partners' use of pornography on women (Bergner\n& Bridges, 2002; Bridges, Bergner, & Hesson-Micnnis,\nimportant observation: Men and women differ greatly in the\nuse of, and taste for, pornography.\nInformative as they might be, these studies however fail\nto explore the more fundamental issue as to how and why\nthese gender differences in pornography use and consump-\ntion pattern come about. We do not mean to deny other stud-\nies on pornography use that took a broader view rather than\njust focused on gender, but the failure of the abovementioned\nstudies to explore the issue suggests that porn studies as a\n1The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n2University of Tsukuba, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nHoi-yan Yau, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Humanities and\nSocial Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba City,\nEmail: yau.hoi-yan.ga@u.tsukuba.ac.jp\n\"I Don't Like Watching Japanese Adult\nVideos Because You Like It\": The Politics\nof Pornography Consumption in Taiwan\nHeung-wah Wong1 and Hoi-yan Yau2\n Keywords\nwomen's pornography preference, Taiwanese women, local gender norms, sexual script, and configuration of sexual being\n2 SAGE Open\nfield is still generally underlined by a general tendency that\nsees gender as universal, essentialized, primordial, bounded,\nunchanging, and homogeneous. The universal gender in turn\nis used to explain away the reasons that men and women will\ndiffer in pornography use and perhaps sex. In the event, spe-\ncific, concrete gender norms that gave rise to the differences\nin pornography use in different cultures are dismissed as just\nmanifestations of their genders. Sartre's criticism of the\nMarxist views on class seems point-for-point appropriate to\nthe essentializing use of gender in the studies of pornography\nuse:\nMarxists formalism is a project of elimination. The method is\nidentical with the Terror in its inflexible refusal to differentiate;\nits goal is total assimilation at the least possible effort. The aim\nis not to integrate what is different as such, while preserving for\nit a relative autonomy, but rather to suppress it . . . The Marxist\nwould believe that he was wasting his time if, for example, he\ntried to understand the originality of a bourgeois thought. In his\neyes the only thing that matters is to show that the thought is a\nmode of idealism . . . The Marxist is therefore impelled to take\nas an appearance the real content of behaviour or of a thought;\nwhen he dissolves the particular in the Universal, he has the\nsatisfaction of believing that he is reducing appearance to truth.\nIn the same way, the abovementioned studies of pornog-\nraphy use dissolve the particular content in the universal con-\ncept of gender. The usage of gender as a universal concept is\nthus no different from what Sartre called \"the Terror,\" which\n\"purged cultural forms of their specific properties by dissolv-\ning them in generic inclinations of class standing and class\nis to recover the specific gender norms and politics in Taiwan\nthat are often lumped together and explained away as gender\ninclinations and see how these specific contents gave rise to\ngender differences in pornography use.\nOur data for this article are culled from the anthropologi-\ncal fieldwork one of the authors conducted in Taipei between\nstudy exploring Asian sexualities, 22 Taiwanese female\ninformants ranging in age between 21 and 52 were\napproached for in-depth interviews. These informants were\nrecruited through snowballing with socioeconomic and edu-\ncational backgrounds as diverse as possible. During the\ninterviews, we invited them to talk about their ideas and per-\nceptions of sex and sexual behaviors as women in Taiwan. In\naddition, we asked them to describe extensively their use of,\nand preference for, pornography over the years.\nThree important discoveries are identified. Out of our 22\nfemale informants, 18 of them expressed patent distaste for\npornography. As we pushed them further, these female infor-\nmants elaborated the reasons for their \"disinterest\" in por-\nnography. Some women explained that they have never had\na chance to watch pornography; some others confessed that\nthey were curious about pornography but they dared not\nwatch it by themselves. There were also female informants\nwho had watched pornography but could not find it interest-\ning because they could not find the female and male charac-\nters portrayed \"real.\" Still others lamented that they could\nnot enjoy watching pornography because they were usually\ninterrupted and therefore could not even finish watching the\nwhole movie.\nSecond, despite their relative disinterest in pornography,\nmost of them tended to have experiences with pornography\nespecially within their dating and marital relationships. They\nreported that they watched pornography mainly because of\nthe request of their husbands or boyfriends. Finally, despite\ntheir overt distaste for pornography, they tended to choose\n\"American\" rather than \"Japanese\" pornography when we\nfurther asked them which type of pornography they preferred\nmore. We do not mean that there is a monolithic notion of\nAmerican pornography or Japanese pornography. As is\nwidely known, Japanese adult video (AV) is renowned for its\nwide array of genres and styles (Wong & Yau, 2014), and so\nis the American pornography, not to mention the fact that the\ncontent of the genres has undergone numerous changes over\nthe years. On the other hand, Taiwanese people must essen-\ntialize both types of pornography to make sense and integrate\nthem into their sexual lives. Within the Taiwanese porn mar-\nket, one should not be surprised to find out that Japanese\npornography, as well as American pornography, is often seen\nas monolithic with all the styles and genres being lumped\ntogether. Elsewhere, we showed that Taiwanese men had\ntended to conflate all Japanese AVs as bishjo (beautiful\nyoung women) AVs, the prototypical genre of Japanese AVs\n(Wong & Yau, 2014). Similarly, American pornography is\ntypically seen as brutal, physical, vulgar, and perhaps\nmechanical vis-\u00e0-vis the mosaicked (i.e., pixelated) Japanese\nAV because it is by and large hard core. More importantly,\nalthough Taiwanese, men and women alike, acknowledge the\nexistence of American pornography wherein the female\ncharacters portrayed are as sexually innocent as those in\nJapanese AVs, the idea that American porn actresses are sex-\nually autonomous and thus aggressive is so established and\ntaken-for-granted in Taiwan so much so that no one would\nchallenge. It must be clear that essentialization of pornogra-\nphy is not only unproblematic to the Taiwanese users but also\nessential for them to make sense and understand it.\nAs such, the objective of this article is to explore why\nTaiwanese female informants lacked interest in pornogra-\nphy; why they would view pornography despite lacking\ninterest in it and why such access was often mediated by their\nmale partners; and ultimately why they would \"claim\" that\nthey preferred American pornography to Japanese AVs, if\nthey were asked to choose.\nWe shall begin by exploring why women lacked interest\nin pornography. We argue that women's lack of interest in\npornography is due to their failures to appreciate it, to find\nthe female/male characters \"real,\" and to enjoy it. As we\nshall try to show, all these have to be understood in terms of\nWong and Yau 3\nthe local gender norms and the local configuration of sexual\nbeings. The same gender norms, however, require Taiwanese\nwomen to watch pornography with their men. Yet women are\noften unable to enjoy pornography in such joint viewing\nbecause under the norms they are supposed to accompany\ntheir men watching rather than watch with them. The frustra-\ntions arising from their simultaneous failure to reject such\npornography viewing and failure to enjoy pornography made\nthem see American pornography as a weapon to express their\nresentment toward the male domination in sex.\nA Brief History of Pornography in\nPostwar Taiwan\nThe history of pornography in postwar Taiwan is underlined\nby three important changes: a change in the types of pornog-\nraphy available in Taiwan, a change in the media of pornog-\nraphy, and a change in the meaning of pornography.\nDespite the severe regulation of pornography under the\nauthoritarian Kuomintang (KMT) rule in postwar Taiwan\n(Wong & Yau, 2010), it does not mean that pornography\nDanish and Dutch pornographies were the box office guaran-\ntee of cinemas in Taiwan (Yeh, 1997). This was followed by\nAmerican pornography which made its inroads into Taiwan\nin the early 1970s, and soon it became the dominant form of\npornography there. However, it lost its momentum when\nJapaneseAVs began to take root in Taiwan in the early 1980s.\nIn contrast to the early Euro-American pornographies that\nhave clearly showed genitalia, Japanese AVs are instead\nunderstood as \"softcore\" because their portrayal of the whole\ngenital region including pubic hair and acts of sexual pene-\ntration is airbrushed and hidden behind a so-called `mosaic'\n(a form of pixelization). More importantly, Japanese AVs are\nrenowned for their sophisticated presentations of female\nfacial expression and their different genres satisfying a wide\nlate 1980s, Japanese AVs have gained a strong foothold in\nTaiwan, finding favor mainly with the younger generation.\nAlthough less popular than before, American pornography\nremains the dominant \"Other\" in modern Taiwan.\nA Change in the Cultural Meaning of\nPornography\nAs Liechty (2001) perceptively points out, the meaning of\npornography is immensely unstable, often depending on the\nsociopolitical context of a given society. In the 1980s, por-\nnography was seen as a symbolic protest against martial law\nimposed by the KMT regime under which freedom of expres-\nsion was strictly prohibited (Yeh, 1997). However, the mean-\ning of pornography underwent changes as Taiwan was\ntransformed into a democratic state in the 1990s. A group of\nfemale students from the Feminist Club of National Taiwan\nUniversity, for example, attempted to challenge male domi-\nnation and patriarchy through hosting a 3-day public pornog-\nraphy screening at a female dormitory in 1995 (T.-y. Luo,\n1997). The screening, which aimed to \"provide young\nwomen sexual imaginations that are different from the tradi-\ntional romantic love,\" \"help women understand male gaze\nand attitudes,\" and \"stimulate the dialogue of women's sex-\nsensation in Taiwan. While the members of Feminist Club\nbecame target of criticism for holding the screening, their\nscreening came as a wake-up call to the issue of gender\ninequality among the public. As a matter of fact, feminism\ngained wider currency in Taiwan than it was in other parts of\nAsia, which can be seen through the large number of aca-\ndemic departments, both undegraduate and postgraduate,\ndevoted to women's/gender studies in Taiwan. One might\nsay that pornography has now become one of the very means\nfor Taiwanese women to resist patriarchy.\nA Change in the Form of Media Technology\nPornographies have been available to Taiwanese customers\nat cinemas since the 1950s. Yet pornographies only became\npopular in the 1980s when they emerged as illegal \"pro-\ngrams\" screened on cable TV. In the early years, subscribers\nof illegal adult programs could watch pornographies espe-\ncially Japanese AVs once they turned on their TV sets. With\nno encryption, pornographies were made accessible to any-\none insofar as they subscribed to the relevant illegal cable\noperators.\nIn 1993, the KMT government passed the Cable Radio\nand Television Law that officially legalized both the broad-\ncast and use of pornography in Taiwan (H.-w. Luo, 1996).\nCable TV became the prime means through which pornogra-\nphies were obtained in the 1990s. However, pornography use\nover the cable TV soon lost its momentum as the state\nannounced in 1999 that the traditional encryption would be\nreplaced with the \"addresssable encryption\" that greatly\nincreased the cost of accessing to adult channels on cable TV.\nBy the early 2000s, many pornography users switched to\npornographic VCD as an alternative.\nIn Taiwan, pirated pornographic VCDs are mainly sold\nthrough VCD retailers. However, VCD retailers are suscep-\ntible to state prosecution precisely because they are fixed in\nlocation. Moreover, VCDs are by and large to be obtained\nthrough physical buying. The problems and inconvenience\ncaused by state prosecution and physical buying soon made\nmany Taiwanese users, especially young men, turn to the\nInternet.\nBy the early 2000s, pornographic VCDs had given way to\nan even newer form of pornography: Internet pornography,\nwhose popularity can be attributed to its \"accessibility,\"\nThe two major ways through which Taiwanese users obtain\nfree pornographies over the Internet are FTP technology\n4 SAGE Open\n(File Transfer Protocol) and P2P technology (Peer to Peer).\nAlthough the exact operations of these technologies are dif-\nferent, both require a high level of technological skills: to set\nup the software, configure the system, optimize the port\nnumber, and solve various problems one might encounter\nduring file transfers.\nThree points can be identified in light of the above brief\nhistory of pornography in postwar Taiwan. First, although\nJapanese AVs are recognized as the most popular type of por-\nnography among Taiwanese men (Bih & Hong, 2006; Chang,\n2004), it will be incorrect to ignore the presence of American\npornography that remains as the dominant \"Other\" in post-\nwar Taiwan. As we shall see, our women informants pre-\ncisely \"claimed\" to prefer American pornography, which is\noften seen as more respectful to women because the female\ncharacters portrayed are sexually autonomous.\nSecond, the cultural meaning of pornography has changed\nfrom a sign of democracy to a way of challenging gender\ninequality in Taiwan. Since the late 1980s when Taiwan has\nbeen transformed into a democratic state, pornography\nbecomes to be seen as a weapon to challenge male domina-\ntion in sex in Taiwan. Our women informants, as we shall see\nshortly, precisely manipulated pornography to express their\nfrustration about men's sexual domination in Taiwan.\nFinally and more importantly, technological advances\nsubstantially affected the way Taiwanese obtained pornogra-\nphy. Pornography was first viewed as movies at cinemas.\nThen, it emerged as cable program and finally became por-\nnographic VCD and Internet file. It must be stressed that\ntechnological changes had profound impact on women's\naccess to pornography. While most of our female informants\nwere frequent computer users, not many of them were famil-\niar with FTP and P2P applications. In fact, none of our female\ninformants used either FTP or P2P to download pornogra-\nphies over the Internet. If they do need material or informa-\ntion via FTP or P2P, they would likely ask their boyfriends or\nbrothers to do so for them. One can see that Internet use in\nTaiwan remains rather gendered; it is by and large dominated\nby men. However, the problem is even if Taiwanese women\nare technologically equipped, they will still encounter prob-\nlems instigated by the local gender norms and the local con-\nfigurations of sexual beings.\nThe Six Binary Pairs of Sex in Taiwan\nIn our recent joint-article (Wong & Yau, 2012), we applied\nSimon Hardy's (2009) notion of \"pornographic realism\" to\nexplore the preference of Taiwanese men for Japanese AV,\nespecially its prototypical genre of bishjo. Hardy argues\nthat pornographic realism is the defining characteristic of\npornography as a representational genre. The smaller the gap\nbetween pornographic representations of sexuality and real\nsex, the more attractive the pornographic movie is. We\nshowed that Taiwanese men would prefer Japanese bishjo\nAVs to American variety because the narrative structure of\nthe former resembles their \"real\" sex more than the latter.\nWe first demonstrated that the so-called \"real\" sex is cul-\nturally constituted. Taiwanese, men and women alike, tended\nto talk about sex in terms of six binaries, and most crucially\nparalleled the binaries with gender contrasts such that the\nmale sexual being is considered as biological, physical, ordi-\nnary, necessary, uncontrollable, and thus \"animal-like\";\nwhereas the female sexual being is seen as cultural, spiritual,\nnon-ordinary, unnecessary, controllable, and finally \"human-\nlike\" (Table 1).\nSexual Being and Sexual Script\nWe then moved to examine how the \"proper\" sex act of\nTaiwanese men and women is discursively constituted\nthrough Simon and Gagnon's (1986) notion of \"sexual\nscript.\" We demonstrated that the sexual script of Taiwanese\nmen is made up of five imperatives: to initiate sex, lead\nwomen throughout sex, use several positions in sex, perform\nsex for a period of time, and most importantly bring the\nwoman to orgasm. The sexual script of Taiwanese women is\nalso made up of five imperatives: to be initiated, led, pene-\ntrated, caressed, and brought to orgasm.\nTaking closer look at these scripts, one can immediately\nrealize that although initial female sexual passivity is cultur-\nally correct and vital to the male sexual pleasure because it\nenables men to assume initiative in sex, what men ultimately\nwant is not female unresponsiveness but sexual engagement\nas exemplified by the imperative of bringing women to\norgasm. The crucial point here lies in the male tiaojiao (train)\nthrough which man transforms his woman from being sexu-\nally passive to active. Putting this back into the binary oppo-\nsitions outlined above, one can at once realize that the sexual\npleasure of Taiwanese men is meant to \"transcend\" the binary\noppositions between the male sex and the female sex by\ntransforming the \"human\"-woman into an \"animal\"-man so\nthat she will desire and enjoy sex as much as a man will. We\nconcluded that Taiwanese men preferred Japanese AV\nbecause its narrative structure was precisely made up of an\n\"animal\"-like male character attempting to transform a\n\"human\"-like female character into \"animal\"-like and that\nthey could not identify with American pornography because\nTable 1. The Six Binary Pairs of Sex in Taiwan.\nBiological vs. Cultural\nPhysical vs. Spiritual\nOrdinary vs. Non-\nordinary\nNecessary vs. Unnecessary\nUncontrollable vs. Controllable\nAnimal vs. Human\nMen vs. Women\nWong and Yau 5\nits narrative structure was made up of an \"animal\"-like male\ncharacter and an \"animal\"-like female character, leaving no\nroom for men to assume sexual initiative. Of course,\nTaiwanese men would identify more with Japanese AV rather\nthan American variety also because of the unique historical\nbackgrounds. Elsewhere, we showed that the 50 years of\nJapanese colonialism cultivated among the older generation\nof Taiwanese a form of Japanese subjectivity (Wong & Yau,\n2014). This made them develop a specific desire for, and a\ncomplex attachment to, things from Japan including AVs,\neven though they were prohibited by the KMT government\nover the past century. The strong attachment of the older gen-\neration to Japanese AVs in turn made the latter the dominant\ntype of pornography in modern Taiwan. The younger genera-\ntion of Taiwanese also embraced Japanese AVs. But they did\nso not because they were historically attached to things from\nJapan, but because they grew up watching Japanese AVs,\nwhich had been habitualized as part of their daily life.\nBut still, this habitualized viewing of Japanese AVs could\nnot explain why our young Taiwanese male informants\nwould opt for the bishjo, the sweet and languid beautiful\nyoung women. It is here where the configuration of \"animal\"-\nman became an important conceptual tool to make sense\ntheir choice of bishjo AVs over other genres or styles.\nWomen's Hesitation to Watch Pornography\nAs we can see, central to the women's script is female pas-\nsivity in sex. As passive recipients of sex, women do not\nneed to consume pornography because doing so must mean\nthat they actively desire sex. The sexual script of woman in\nTaiwan thus serves to prescribe women's use of pornography\nthrough immense social stigma attached to a woman who\nactively desires, and luxuriates in, pornography. The embar-\nrassment and shame evoked by the social stigma make\nwomen reluctant to access pornography by themselves.\nAll this, coupled by their lack of technological skills, sug-\ngests that Taiwanese women are often deprived of opportu-\nnity to develop an interest, let alone the relevant literacy, in\nconsuming pornography. They therefore will have difficulty\nin appreciating pornography.\nUnreal Female and Male Characters\nThe way Taiwanese women understand their own sexual\nbeings has profound impact on their pornography use. Recall\nthat the discursively constituted female sexual being is\n\"human\"-like, whereas the sexual script of women in Taiwan\nemphasized female passivity. The sexual script of Taiwanese\nwomen is not the logical consequence of the female sexual\nbeing; and the female sexual being is not the premise of the\nTaiwanese women's sexual script either. To say that the\nfemale sexual being is \"human\"-like does not necessarily\nimply female passivity in sex. Equally, to say that women\nshould be passive in sex does not necessarily mean that their\nsexual being has to be \"human\"-like. There is an\nepistemological break between female sexual being and the\nTaiwanese women's sexual script. This epistemological\nbreak, we argue, further leads to an ontological break because\nif Taiwanese women perceive their sexual being and sexual\nscript differently, they tend to believe that they are two dif-\nferent things. The female sexual being here appears to\nTaiwanese women as their \"real\" sex, while the sexual script\nrepresents the sexual norms imposed by the society; the for-\nmer is what Taiwanese women's sex is, whereas the latter is\nwhat their sexual behaviours should be. That is to say,\nTaiwanese women do not see sexual passivity as their \"real\"\nsex. They therefore tend not to be able to identify with the\nsexually passive female character in Japanese AVs in general\nand bishjo AVs in particular.\nTaiwanese women do not find a sexually aggressive\nwoman \"real\" to them either. Taiwanese female informants\noften described the American actresses as fake and unreal.\nInasmuch as their sexual being is neither sexually passive\nnor aggressive but \"human\"-like, which is cultural, spiritual,\nextraordinary, unnecessary, and controllable. They will not\nfind the sexually aggressive female character in American\npornographic movies attractive because this type of female\ncharacter simply does not appear to be \"real\" to them.\nNeither could Taiwanese women identify with the male\ncharacter portrayed in American and Japanese pornogra-\nphies. Because Taiwanese women perceive their sexual\nbeing as cultural, spiritual, extraordinary, unnecessary, con-\ntrollable, and thus \"human\"-like, it follows that they dislike,\nif not detest, male advances with clear sexual implications.\nNor do women like straightforward sex. Overwhelmed by\nthe spirituality of sex, they instead emphasize mood and\natmosphere, enjoy flirting and romance, and would love to\nbe sweet-talked to. Sex can only come after all these \"spiri-\ntual\" things, but still it is unnecessary and containable. That\nis to say, they tend to prefer a male partner with the same\nsexual being with her. The \"real\" and \"ideal\" sexual partner\nfor Taiwanese women is a man whose sexual being is also\n\"human\"-like (Table 2).\nThe Sexual Pleasure for Taiwanese\nWomen\nIf the sexual pleasure of Taiwanese women is derived from\ndating and having sex with a \"human\"-like partner, it follows\nthat they could not find both Japanese AVs and American\nTable 2. The Sexual Pleasure for Taiwanese Women.\nBiological  Cultural = Cultural\nPhysical  Spiritual = Spiritual\nOrdinary  Non-ordinary = Non-ordinary\nNecessary  Non-necessary = Non-necessary\nUncontainable  Containable = Containable\nAnimal  Human = Human\nMen : Women\n6 SAGE Open\npornography sexually pleasurable because the male charac-\nter portrayed in both types of pornography is not \"human\"-\nlike but \"animal\"-like. It should be clear by now that\nTaiwanese women could not identify with the female and\nmale characters portrayed in pornography, both Japanese\nAVs and American pornography alike, because they could\nnot find them \"real.\" This explains why some of our other\nfemale informants told us that despite having ample oppor-\ntunty to view pornography by themselves, they still could not\nfind it interesting, either.\nPornography Viewing With Men\nNothwithstanding their lack of interest in pornography, many\nof our female informants reported that as they entered into\nromance or marriage, they were often asked by their male\npartners to watch pornography together as a kind of foreplay\nand accommodate the sexual needs of the latter afterward. In\nwhat follows, we shall focus on the stories of Wen-chien,\nLittle Yun, and Mei-fung to see how they accommodate the\nsexual requests made by their men. We do not mean that\nthese three women can represent the Taiwanese women. But\nwe would like to focus intensively on them so that we can\n\" . . . pick up on the complexity of meanings that sexuality\nhas for individuals and groups, and on the importance of con-\ntext in the construction of these meanings\" (Attwood, 2005,\nWen-chien was 37 years old when we first met her in\n2002. She held no interest in pornography. However, she\ncame across pornography throughout her past two marriages.\nMarried in 1989, her first husband offered to watch pornog-\nraphy together during their brief marriage. However, Wen-\nchien could not recall any detail of the movies she had\nwatched as their marriage began to have problem. In 1990,\nthe couple divorced after an incident of physical abuse. In\n1991, Wen-chien married her second husband, with whom\nshe had been married for 10 years. During her 10-year mar-\nriage with him, Wen-chien often came across pornography\nbecause her husband held a strong taste for it. As indifferent\nto pornography as Wen-chien might be, she often accompa-\nnied her husband in watching pornography. As our conversa-\ntion goes,\nResearcher: Would you watch pornography with your\n[second ex] husband?\nWen-chien: Yes, we did . . .\nResearcher: Did he invite you to watch or was it a sort of\nmutual understanding?\nWen-chien: Um . . . he wouldn't ask me directly . . . We\nwere married for 10 years. Everything came very natu-\nral. Usually, he would watch it by himself first during\nthe time I was taking a shower or doing skincare. Then\nI would join him to watch together. We usually had sex\nafterwards . . .\nResearcher: So you mean he would come to you for sex\nafter watching?\nWen-chien: Yes . . . he would come to touch me, kiss me,\nand caress me in the midst of viewing pornography . . .\nbecause he got excited . . . haha . . .\nResearcher: So you were not really watching the movie,\nright?\nWen-chien: No I don't. As I said, I don't like\npornography.\nResearcher: How often did you watch pornography with\nhim then?\nWen-chien: It depended on situations . . . but maybe once\na week or so . . .\nResearcher: I see.\nOne can observe that pornography viewing appeared to be\npart of Wen-chien's marital life even though she found it\nunattractive. This is also the case in Mei-fung's life. Mei-\nfung was a 27-year-old working mother of two daughters\nfamily pressure, Mei-fung gave birth to a son and thereafter\nshe quit her job and became a full-time housewife. Mei-fung\ndescribed her husband as a very \"conservative\" person who\nnever talked about sex but would make her watch porno-\ngraphic VCDs with him at home.\nResearcher: Have you ever watched pornography?\nMei-fung: Yes . . . recently . . . with my husband . . .\nResearcher: So you are suggesting that you did not watch\npornography on cableTVor pornographicVCDs before?\nMei-fung: No . . .\nResearcher: How could it be possible? Given that adult\nchannels on cable TV were so popular and porno-\ngraphic VCDs are just about everywhere in Taiwan . . .\nMei-fung: Um . . . my [natal] family did not subscribe to\nadult channels. My family is quite strict on sex matters.\nIf a bedroom scene came up on the TV, my mother and\nlater I myself would switch channels . . . And we did\nnot buy VCDs . . .\nResearcher: I see . . . so you watched with your husband?\nUnder what situations?\nMei-fung: In fact, my husband intentionally brought home\nsome Japanese pornographic VCDs, because he thought\nthat I was getting more and more disinterested in sex\n. . . I think he has uncontainably strong sexual desires,\nbecause he often woke up with an \"erected\" penis and\nattempted to have sex with me, though our children were\nby the side. But, I rarely have the desire, so sometimes I\neven escape from his amorous advances. Well\n...theseVCDswereexpectedtoarousemysexualdesires.\nBut I did not find those VCDs sexually rewarding . . .\nOne can observe from the cases of Wen-chien and Mei-\nfung that while Taiwanese women were by and large not\ninterested in pornography, many of them were made to watch\npornography by their men in the course of their lives. None\nof our female informants told us that they were \"forced\" by\ntheir men to watch pornography, but some reported that they\nWong and Yau 7\nfelt obliged to do so and some others said that they did it out\nof the fear that their men would be angry or unhappy. An\nobvious case in point is Little Yun.\nLittle Yun was a 26-year-old single woman when we first\nmet her in late 2002. Little Yun came from an extremely\ntroubled family where her birth parents were not married to\neach other but others. Her birth father finally deserted the\nfamily for another woman when she was 3. Traumatized by\nthis, she embarked her life project by finding fatherly love in\nromance. She had been dating since 16. Her first lover was\nher senior by 7 years. If she could sacrifice her own health by\nundergoing four abortions at a backstreet hospital just\nbecause she felt awkward to ask her first boyfriend to wear a\ncondom in the first place, perhaps we should be not surprised\nthat Little Yun would accompany him to watch pornography\neven though she was not interested in it. As our conversation\ngoes,\nResearcher: So you were always watching Japanese AVs\non cable TV with your first boyfriend?\nLittle Yun: Yes . . .\nResearchers: But you said you were not really interested in\npornography, right? Then why watching it with him?\nLittle Yun: Yes, I am not interested in pornography. But he\nwanted to watch . . .\nResearcher: But you could always refuse to do so, right?\nLittle Yun: No . . . I won't refuse . . . umm . . .\nResearcher: You won't refuse? Why was that?\nLittle Yun: Um . . . you would worry that he might be\nupset or angry if I refused . . .\nResearcher: So you mean that you ultimately fear that he\nwould dump you . . .\nLittle Yun: Um . . . right . . . you might say so.\nIndifferent to pornography as Little Yun might be, she felt\nobliged to accompany her man to watch pornography. For\nshe was afraid that her boyfriend would be displeased with\nher, if she refused to do so.\nFour points can be made in light of the above stories con-\ncerning Taiwanese women's experiences of pornography\nviewing. First of all, these women could not refuse men's\ndemand of viewing pornography together as they felt obliged\nto do so. Second, as these women were supposed to accom-\npany their men to watch pornography rather than to watch\npornography with men, they had no choice on the content of\nthe movies they watched. Equally and third, these women\nhad no say as to when to start and when to finish, let alone\nwhere to start and where to finish. Recall that Mei-fung's\nhusband brought home some pornographic VCDs for her to\nwatch so that she might be \"more\" interested in sex. However,\nthese pornographic VCDs were brought home and played by\nher husband at his own will. Mei-fung was never consulted\nabout the content of the VCDs, not to mention whether she\nreally liked to watch pornography, or when to do so. In other\nwords, Mei-fung was deprived of a say on either the content\nor the timing in her viewing of pornography.\nFinally, just when these women might have been starting\nto \"get into\" the movies, more often than not their viewing\nwould be interrupted as their men began to approach their\nbodies for sex. Recall that Wen-chien would only join her\nhusband's viewing after doing her skincare or taking a\nshower. In the course of watching pornography with her hus-\nband, he might approach her body for sex. No wonder Wen-\nchiensaidthatshehadneverfinishedwatchingapornographic\nmovie.\nCentral to these four points is that women have no say in\ntheir use of pornography with men. Women are never equal\npartners in such joint viewing of pornography. Their role is\nsimply to accompany men to watch pornography and subse-\nquently accommodate their sexual needs when arise. In other\nwords, men dominate the whole process of joint viewing of\npornography, whereas women are at best sexual subordinate.\nClaimed Preference to American\nPornography: Taiwanese Women's\nProtest\nWhen we pushed further and asked our Taiwanese female\ninformants if they had to choose between American and\nJapanese pornographies, which one they would prefer, sur-\nprisingly almost all of them claimed that they preferred the\nformer to the latter. Mei-fung, for example, was not inter-\nested in watching pornography, but she claimed that she pre-\nferred American to Japanese pornographies when she was\npushed to choose between them. In the following excerpts\nfrom our interview with her, we shall see how she compared\nJapanese AVs with the American variety.\nResearcher: So those you guys watched are American? Or\nJapanese?\nMei-fung: Might be both . . . I just watched a few only. I\nthink for the American movies, it seemed they were\ndoing exercise! Like they were dancing! Then, I think\nI don't like watching Japanese AVs, it made me feel . .\n. a bit deviant. It made me feel that it looked down\nupon women! It made me feel that it didn't respect\nwomen. For the American ones, the way they took the\nfilm is that they took the film, per se. Then, you dis-\ncovered that they treated sex the same way as sports or\nexercise. You know, like they are running or playing\nbadminton. Since sexual scenes are displayed for quite\nlong . . . and then, they are less disrespectful to women.\nBut they are rather boring and unarousing, anyway.\nResearcher: Why do you think that Japanese AVs are\nsexist?\nMei-fung: Cause they always focus on the faces of the\nactresses, who look painful and . . . Or else, there will\nbe several men coming to couple with the actress.\nThen, the lens stays still on her face while she looks in\ngreat pain. And in the interview setting, is that called\n\"interview\" . . . the woman is often asked how many\n8 SAGE Open\nsexual partners she ever has. She is then forced to\nadmit that she is very lascivious, just like a nympho-\nmaniac. My feeling is that we women are renjin kefu\n(any man can be her husband)! More importantly, I\nwas always wondering if the Japanese AV actresses\nwere also under sexual or physical exploitation!\nTo Mei-fung, American pornography appears to be a por-\nnographic film \"taken for the sake of taking,\" in that sex has\nbecome a form of \"exercise\" or \"dancing.\" When asked to\nelaborate what she meant by exercise or dancing, she\nexplained that the actor and actress were just machines\n\"operating\" over there. In a sense, what she has described\nsuggests that American lovemaking is not sexual at all, but\ndesexualized to become a sport activity or an exercise. By\ncontrast, Japanese AVs left her an uneasy feeling that the sto-\nryline is deviant and women portrayed in the movies are\ndenigrated and looked down on. In addition, Mei-fung\nthought that Japanese AV girls are always left as pained, in\nsuffering or exhausted as a result of the physical sex in the\nmovie. In essence, she found JapaneseAVs remarkably chau-\nvinist not only in that they disrespect women in general but\nalso in that there is sexual and physical abuse for the women\nin the movies.\nGiven her rather negative comments on Japanese AVs, we\ncould not but ask her whether she implied that American por-\nnography was better than Japanese AVs. Mei-fung replied\nthat she disliked both in general but she would suggest that\nAmerican pornography was much less disgusting and giving\nmore respect and care to women. She added that perhaps it is\nexactly this equal treatment of women that made Taiwanese\nmen including her husband unable to identify with American\npornography. She concluded that she would go for American\npornography rather than Japanese AVs.\nUnlike Mei-fung, Little Yun actively reported that she\npreferred American to Japanese pornographies. The reason\ncited is common: Japanese AVs are deviant because they\ntend to employ a lot of props, such as vibrators, dildos, chain\nof pearls, liquid, and so on. But, most crucially, they give her\nthe feelings of \"sensually violence\" (ganguan baoli) and\n\"superior man-inferior woman\" (nanzun nvbei).As she noted\nin our interview,\nThe Japanese actresses are always almost forced to have sex.\nEven though they did not want sex in the beginning, the men\nwould use a lot of props to stimulate her body, her breast, her\nvagina, her clitoris, only to make her sexually excited. I think\nthese are always done violently as if women are second-class.\nThey do not respect women at all. Japanese are like this!\nAs we can see, she detests Japanese AVs on account of\ntheir sex discrimination and their violence directed at women.\nBy contrast, she thought that the American variety is more\n\"natural,\" or \"shenghuohua\" (sort of daily life). She added\nthat women in American movies are positioned as \"equal\"\npartners who are free to express their sexual desires and\nenjoy sex. Her positioning of the American variety as equali-\ntarian and thus liberal was by no means novel among our\ninformants, as Wen-chien also had similar ideas.\nWell, Japanese AV is sick and misogynous; I don't like it . . .\nsame old plots, small room, and ugly actors. American\npornography is much much better, with handsome actors,\nbeautiful actresses and more interesting stories. Most\nimportantly, it treats women as equal partners. Women are not\nthere to serve the men! Sex is not one-way, but mutual!\nWhat puzzles us most was that despite their patent dis-\ntaste for pornography and critical attitude toward Japanese\nAVs, our Taiwanese female informants tended to be fairly\nlenient toward American pornography. We cannot figure\nout in the first place why Taiwanese women especially\nthose like Mei-fung, Little Yun, and Wen-chien, as we have\nseen above, did not even have a chance to finish watching a\npiece of pornographic movie when they were requested to\nwatch pornography with their men could have such a vivid\nimage of American and Japanese pornographies. Obviously,\nthe \"vivid\" image these women had about American and\nJapanese pornographies comes from their impression rather\nthan actual experience of pornography viewing. Their\nimpression of American pornography as equalitarian and\nthus liberal and that of Japanese AV as sexist can partially\nbe attributed to Taiwanese women's stereotypical image of\nthe gender relation in the two countries. But more impor-\ntantly, these Taiwanese women, we argue, have tended to\nproject their personal and unhappy experience of sexual\ncoercion by their men in the joint viewing of pornography\nonto the actresses of Japanese AVs, which further shapes\ntheir perceptions of porn actresses in Japanese AVs as vic-\ntims of male sexual domination and coercion, even though\nthey may not have much experience in watching Japanese\nAV. Taiwanese women's perceptions of Japanese porn\nactresses as victims in turn affect the way they respond to\nJapanese AVs: They cannot find Japanese AVs interesting.\nThe arguments with which we conclude is that as Taiwanese\nwomen experience suffering from male domination in the\njoint viewing of pornography with their male partners, they\nproject such suffering onto the porn actresses in Japanese\nAVs; and as they perceive Japanese AV actresses as victims\nof male sexual domination and coercion, they reject\nJapanese AVs. We take several sentences from Fareen\nIndeed, authenticity is necessary to their [women's] enjoyment\n[of pornography]. But what the women perceive as authentic\ndepends in part on their own experiences. Specifically, I showed\nhow experiences with sexual violence and economic struggle\nled many of the women I interviewed to perceive porn acting as\nself-destructive and in some cases coercive. As a result, these\nwomen sometimes found pornography emotionally upsetting\ndespite the arousal they generally obtained from it. Stated\ndifferently, they experienced emotional dissonance, as they\nperceive such dissonance in the porn actresses. (p. 625)\nWong and Yau 9\nOur Taiwanese women, however, tried to do more than\ntheir American counterparts who participated in Fareen\nParvez's research did. They rejected Japanese AVs also to\nundermine, though symbolically, the male sexual domination\nand coercion. As we have seen, these women vehemently\ndetested Japanese AVs, which were their men's favorite, on\ngrounds of their sexual discrimination against women. Here,\none should grasp the operation of equivalence that links\n\"Japanese AVs\" with their male partners. As women detested\ntheir male partners forcing them to watch Japanese AVs, they\nnaturally detested Japanese AVs, the kind of pornography\nwith which their men identified. The equivalence between\nJapanese AVs and Taiwanese men is reinforced at the experi-\nential level. As Japanese AVs are the kind of pornography\nwomen were required by their men to watch and follow,\nJapanese AVs are simply their men--Japanese AVs for their\nmen. To these Taiwanese women then, Japanese AVs in gen-\neral have metaphorically become the symbol of their domi-\nnating male partners who forced pornography alongside sex\nupon them. If women vehemently detested Japanese AVs\neven though they had very thin idea about it, it is not unrea-\nsonable to say that they actually detested their male partners,\nat least, for their domination in sex.\nIf Taiwanese women detested male domination through\nvehemently denying JapaneseAVs, perhaps we should not be\nsurprised that they resisted male domination through a\nclaimed preference with American pornography. Recall that\nmost of their men preferred Japanese to American pornogra-\nphies. Taiwanese women's totally opposite, though claimed,\npreference for pornography, we argue, can be seen as their\nattempt to undermine Taiwanese men's sexual hegemony.\nStated differently, women's claimed preference points\nexactly to their attempt to undermine patriarchy. As noted,\nmost Taiwanese men regarded American porn actresses as\nsexually aggressive and thus emasculating. However,\nTaiwanese women we interviewed tended to think that the\nAmerican variety is more \"natural,\" \"artless,\" \"shenghuohua\n(sort of daily life),\" \"less misogynistic,\" \"more liberal,\" and\nthus better than Japanese AVs. By claiming that they pre-\nferredAmerican pornography with which they were unfamil-\niar and to which their male partners showed disdain, our\nwomen informants expressed their frustration and distaste as\na woman in the male-dominant Taiwanese society. Just like\ntheir predecessors in using pornography screening to launch\na public protest to the patriarchy, these women likewise\nmanipulated their \"claimed\" preference for American por-\nnography to launch a protest against male domination in sex.\nConclusion\nThis article examined the pornography use of Taiwanese\nwomen and especially their \"claimed\" preference for\nAmerican pornography. It started with the premise that\nalthough the lack of technological skills barred\nTaiwanese women from accessing pornography, what seem\nmore crucial are the local gender norms and configurations\nof sexual beings. We showed that under the sexual script\nwomen showing an interest in pornography still carried a\nstigma that worked very well to stop women from accessing\npornography. Taken together, their lack of technological\nskill and hesitation to access pornography explain why\nTaiwanese women rarely came into contact with pornogra-\nphy and thus deprived of the interest in appreciating\npornography.\nWomen's unique understanding of their sexual being as\n\"human\"-like departed tremendously from the images of the\nfemale characters portrayed in pornographies. They thus\ncould not identify with the female characters portrayed in\neither Japanese AVs or American pornography. Likewise,\ntheir understanding of their sexual being as \"human\"-like\nalso constrained the kind of men with whom they could sex-\nually identify: must also be \"human\"-like. As the male char-\nacters in both Japanese AVs and American pornography were\nnot \"human\"-like, but \"animal\"-like, both types of pornogra-\nphy could not find favor with women.\nHowever, many of the Taiwanese women we interviewed\nwatched pornography with their male partners. They were\noften demanded by their men to watch pornography and sub-\nmitted to the demands under the intense social pressure gen-\nerated by sexual script. Under the same script, women were\nsupposed to accompany their men to watch pornography\nrather than watch pornography with men. These women\nlacked any sense of autonomy with regard to pornography\nviewing.\nOf course that women did not refuse pornography view-\ning initiated by their male partners does not necessarily mean\nthat they were happy to do. Their frustrations arising from\ntheir simultaneous failures to reject such pornography view-\ning and to enjoy pornography made them detest Japanese\nAVs.As women detested their male partners forcing Japanese\npornographies upon them, they could not but transpose this\nsense of hatred onto Japanese AVs with which their men\nidentified. Japanese AVs and Taiwanese men were rendered\nequivalent to each other. That is to say, Taiwanese women\ndetested Japanese AVs as detest for male domination in sex.\nIf these women detested male domination through vehe-\nmently denying Japanese AVs, perhaps we should not be sur-\nprised that they resisted male domination through claiming\nto prefer American pornography. It is especially true if we\ntake into account of the fact that Taiwanese men disliked\nAmerican pornography. By claiming that they preferred\nAmerican pornography to which their men showed disdain,\nthese women expressed their frustrations as a woman in the\nmale-dominant society.\nAuthor's Note\nThe authors contributed equally to the article and therefore their\nnames are arranged in an alphabetical order.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllen, M., d'Alessio, D., & Brezgel, L.
