    "abstract": "Abstract. Research on visualization during participatory planning workshops is\nwidespread, but there are hardly any studies comparing workshops with and without\nvisualization. We conducted four workshops with local stakeholders to develop landscape\nvisions for the year 2030. In three workshops we used different techniques to support\nthe visioning process with real-time visualization: drawings by hand, a town planning\ncomputer-aided design software, and a combination of GIS, Google Earth, and SketchUp\nwith Cinema 4D. In the fourth workshop the participants developed their visions without\nany visualization. In all cases the participants evaluated the workshops expost by means\nof a standardized questionnaire.The comparative analysis of the data revealed that\nvisualization supports the participants consistently but only moderately in imagining\nfuture landscape conditions. In particular, visualization provided a better common basis\nfor communication, whereas it only marginally inspired the viewers to develop new\nideas. The main trade-off of using visualizations that we found was that the participants\nassessed their influence on the discussion as too strong as they focused the discussion on\nvisual aspects. Among the visualization techniques tested, drawings by hand appeared to\nbe particularly useful for creating long-term (more than fifteen years) landscape visions.\nFuture research on the use of visualization during workshops should concentrate on the\nperceptions and requirements of the viewers.\n",

Introduction\nHumans perceive landscapes first and foremost in a visual way (Ribeiro et al, 2013).\nConsequently, any changes in a place's landscape scenery will affect its touristic and\nresidential quality (Buchecker, 2009; Hunziker et al, 2008) and should be taken into account\nin spatial planning projects. Local stakeholders have, therefore, been increasingly involved\nin landscape planning processes. Practical experience has, however, shown that it is very\ndifficult for both residents and tourists to imagine future changes in a given landscape and to\nanticipate possible impacts on their well-being (Buchecker et al, 2003; Soliva and Hunziker,\n2009). For this reason visualization is being used increasingly in landscape planning, as it\nis thought to support the viewer in imagining future landscape conditions, particularly lay\npeople who may not be familiar with maps and other two-dimensional planning documents,\nand help them to understand complex planning issues more intuitively. Recently, a variety\nof visualization techniques have been developed and implemented in participatory planning\nprocesses. Photorealistic visualizations, artistic renderings, and three-dimensional (3D)\nsimulations on the basis of geographical information systems (GIS), and computer-aided\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 185\ndesign (CAD) software have become rather popular among landscape planners and they\nSander and Manson, 2007). Currently, the emphasis is on visualization tools that allow images\nto be created and changed immediately according to the viewers' wishes so the users can\nquickly obtain a visual impression of the potential consequences of their planning decisions.\nThere is a substantial body of literature on the way participatory processes can foster\nsustainable landscape development (Buchecker et al, 2010; Garmendia and Stagl, 2010;\nhave also explored the effects of visualizations during landscape planning workshops with\nwhat extent different forms of visualization can support local stakeholders in discussions on\nlong-term landscape developments.\nMost studies on the effects of visualizations have focused on 3D visualizations with\nGIS and CAD. Salter et al (2009) conducted an explorative case study with real-time 3D\nvisualizations at two workshops. They combined GIS, CAD, and a digital terrain model\nto visualise potential densification of residential areas on Bowen Island in the suburbs\nof Vancouver (Canada). Schroth et al (2011) used the method of cross-case synthesis to\nanalyse three workshops on possible future landscape development in a pre-alpine region in\nSwitzerland, and Wissen Hayek (2011) analysed five workshops on landscape development\nin another region in Switzerland. The workshops differed not only in the topics discussed\n(tourism, agriculture, or forestry), but also in the levels of realism and interactivity of\nthe visualizations. Both Swiss studies emphasized the positive effect of visualizations on\npeople's motivation to participate in a planning workshop. They also found visualization\nuseful to give information about the problem to be discussed and to make the participants\nmore familiar with the problem context. Further, they pointed out that visualization provides\na common basis for communication and thus supports consensus building among workshop\nparticipants.\nMore recent studies have evaluated different visualization tools in terms of the users'\nquality requirements. Lewis (2012) investigated the effects of artistic renderings in terms\nof how realistic and credible the viewers considered the images to be, and which kind of\nrendering they preferred. He created different renderings for specific features in an urban\npark (eg, park entrance, restaurant, and art gallery) and presented the pictures to members\nof the park's masterplan task force and students of environmental science. The informants\nviewed and assessed the images on a computer screen in single sessions. Similarly, Pettit\net al (2011) ascertained the requirements of different user groups in terms of the design\nof 3D visualizations representing different future landscape conditions. They used different\nvisualization software packages available online and presented the images to professional\nplanners (as examples of current users) and to students (as examples of future users) during\nsemistructured or online interviews, respectively. These studies recommend photorealistic\nrepresentations because their content is assumed to be understood the best and they look the\nmost objective. The viewers reported that they did not feel manipulated or disturbed while\nmaking their decisions.\nIn most cases, visualization is used to evaluate given alternatives in the context of\nadvanced planning projects, and not to substantiate new ideas or visions that the participants\ndevelop immediately during the workshops. So far, only a few researchers have studied the\nperformance of visualizations for specific planning purposes. Al-Kodmany (1999) applied\ndifferent visualization techniques in a participatory neighbourhood planning process in the\ncity of Chicago, and investigated their suitability for different planning phases. While the\nstudies considered above exclusively employed digital visualization techniques, he included\n186 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\nnot only GIS maps and computer photomanipulations, but also sketches made by an artist.\nAbstract GIS and draft-like drawings by hand turned out to be best suited for brainstorming\nand visioning phases, whereas photomanipulations and photorealistic 3D visualizations\nappeared to work better in the more concrete projecting and planning phases. It is still,\nhowever, unclear if real-time visualization supports the actual decision-making process by\nmotivating the participants to be creative and to develop new ideas mutually. Further research\non users' perceptions of visualizations is needed (Lewis et al, 2012). Systematic, quasi-\nexperimental evaluations of the effects of visualizations are rare because most research on\nreal-time visualization has been case-study research on workshops in real-world situations,\nwhere real stakeholders discuss real planning problems in their regions. In these studies, the\nresearchers have very few opportunities to influence the goals and processes of the workshops.\nIn addition, they are usually unable to repeat their experiments under similar conditions: that\nis, with similar stakeholder groups and similar planning questions. In particular, research\ncomparing workshops with and without visualization seems to be lacking.\nOur study addresses these gaps by systematically evaluating the contributions of different\nvisualization techniques, including the variant of no visualization, to stimulate discussion on\nfuture landscape developments among local stakeholders. In particular, we aimed to answer\nthe following research questions: (1) Does real-time visualization support the participants\nin imagining future landscape conditions? (2) Does real-time visualization stimulate the\nparticipants to develop new ideas? (3) Does real-time visualization provide a common basis\nfor communication? (4) Is real-time visualization only a fun factor? )5) Are the individual\nvisualization techniques perceived differently by the participants? Our study differs from\nmost previous research in three ways: (i) it focuses on participants' visions and new ideas\ninstead of their assessment of previously given planning alternatives; (ii) it integrates a\ncontrol group who did not experience real-time visualization; and (iii) it compared different\nvisualization approaches.\n2 Materials and methods\nOur case study is part of the comprehensive transdisciplinary research program Room for\nPeople and Nature (http://www.wsl.ch/raumanspruch), which aims to develop scenarios\nof future landscape development in four different periurban regions near the metropolitan\nregion of Zurich (Switzerland). As it is part of a scientific research program, our study was\nindependent of any political processes such as the revision of zoning plans. Thus, we had\nmore leeway in designing the workshops. Nevertheless, the participants still benefited from\nthe workshops because they had the opportunity to discuss an issue that they considered to be\nhighly relevant but neglected in the daily business of local politics.\nIn each of the four case-study regions, we conducted a workshop with local stakeholders\nto develop a common vision about the future development of their particular region. The\nworkshop topics were about quality of life and rather long-term visions concerning potential\nsituations in 2030: that is, seventeen years into the future. Thus,the discussions focused mostly\non socioeconomic and environmental aspects, and spatial accuracy was less important than\nit would be in actual spatial planning workshops. The principal question addressed in our\nworkshopswas:\"whatwillyourregionlooklikeintheyear2030ifitfeaturesanextraordinarily\nhigh quality of life?\" Our intention was to make the participants express their actual wishes\nabout the future landscape development regardless of any political constraints. Therefore,\nwe did not include local zoning plans or similar official documents in the visualizations or\ndiscussions. However, we did consider some statements in informal documents about long-\nterm regional development concepts and mission statements in preparing the visualization\nand moderation of the workshops. Both the stakeholder groups and the workshop structures\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 187\nwere very similar in all four regions. Three workshops used real-time visualization, and one\nwas carried out without visualization. At the workshops with visualization, we applied three\ndifferent visualization techniques in order to assess their potential to support the stakeholders\nin developing visions of future landscape states.All four workshops took place betweenApril\n2.2 Case study regions\nOur case study regions were: the Linth plain region in Canton St Gallen; the municipality of\nGlarus Nord in Canton Glarus; the Seetal region in Canton Lucerne; and the Obere Freiamt\nin Canton Aargau. These are four typical periurban regions in Switzerland, all in the vicinity\nof the city-region of Zurich, which is the largest conurbation in Switzerland, and allless\nthan one hour by car or public transport from the centre of Zurich. The Seetal and the Obere\nFreiamt are also within 20 minutes of the urban centres of Lucerne and Zug. This easy\naccessibility makes these regions attractive living areas for residents who commute to the\nlarger cities, with the additional attraction of being in the countryside with rural landscape\nscenery and sunny and quiet residential areas. They all still dispose of free building lots,\nparticularly for single-family houses. From 2000 to 2012, the four regions experienced\npopulation increases of 9% (Glarus Nord), 11% (Seetal), 16% (Oberes Freiamt), and 18%\n(Linth plain), because they still offer much more affordable housing than the conurbations\nof the big cities. The municipal councils in the case-study regions expect similar population\ngrowth up to 2030. They view this development ambivalently. On the one hand, resulting\nnew taxpayers and particularly young families make the villages more lively and dynamic.\nOn the other hand, the landscape may be affected by even more sprawl than has occurred in\nthe recent past.\n2.3 Workshop participants\nOur goal was to find approximately 10 participants for each workshop. We kept the groups\nrather small so that they could work together on one picture at the same time, but large\nenough to represent a wide spectrum of interests. We looked for people very familiar with\nthe everyday life in the particular region and strongly involved in its future development. We\ncontacted the planning authorities of each canton, our funding partners, to suggest people we\ncould invite to our workshops.\nWe ended up with eight to fourteen participants at the workshops. Most of them live in\nthe respective region and many are involved in local politics. The workshop participants\nconsisted of members of the municipal council, representatives of the municipal and\nCantonal authorities, and members of local nongovernmental organization, such asnature and\nlandscape protection associations or ornithological associations.The participants'background\nknowledge ranged from farming, nature protection, landscape design, spatial planning, and\nplace branding, to local politics. The individual workshop participants had very specific\ninterests in matters such as agriculture, nature protection, and the regional economy and we\naimed to reconcile these different interests in one common vision of the future landscape.\n2.4 Workshop structure\nAll four workshops had principally the same structure. In the first ice-breaking step, the\nparticipants introduced themselves with their names, their connections to the region (eg,\nrsident in the region, on the municipal council), and named their favourite place in the\nregion. In the second step, each participant wrote on index cards the three most important\nstrengths and weaknesses of the region considering quality of life. They then presented these\nindividually and the moderator pinned and grouped the cards on a pinboard. In the third step\nthe participants elaborated their visions for the region's future development. We chose an\nopen discussion for the workshops with visualization and group discussions for the workshop\n188 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\nwithout visualization. In all four cases we asked the participants to say what they thought\nthe region would look like in 2030, if its weaknesses would have been overcome and its\nstrengths made even stronger. In three workshops we moderated the discussion using real-\ntime visualization. We asked the participants if the pictures shown corresponded to their\nvisions, and what they wanted to have changed. The pictures were changed immediately, at\nleast in a draft version. Each change was recorded either as a separate file on the computer or\nas a digital photograph. In this way, we documented how the discussion progressed.\nThe control workshop was without visualization. As there was no tangible picture for\nthe fourteen participants to focus on in their discussions, they developed their visions for the\nfuture in small groups of three to four. We asked them to write on index cards what should\nchange in the future and what should remain the same. They were also asked to express what\nthe region could look like in the future after a positive evolution. In the following plenary\nsession the group speakers presented the results of their group discussions and we recorded\nkey words, particularly about what can make the positive trends visible, on a flipchart.\nThe workshop team consisted of the workshop leader, the moderator, one operator for\neach visualization technique, and a photographer taking pictures of the workshop procedures.\nWith the drawings by hand (see also section 2.5) an additional photographer took photographs\nof the drawings at different stages to document the changes discussed. The workshop leader\nsupported the moderator by recording keywords in the discussions on a flipchart and by giving\nadvice on the visualizations. In the workshop without visualization, there was no visualization\noperator. Each team member participated in at least one workshop. The workshop leader and\nthe moderator were the same in all four workshops.\n2.5 Visualization techniques\nWe chose two perspectives for the visualizations: `bird's-eye-view' perspectives from well-\nknown viewpoints to obtain overview images over large parts of the case-study regions, and\n`street-view' perspectives for pictures of typical, well-known places in the regions. Since the\nworkshopswerenotactualplanningworkshopsbutfocusedonqualityoflife,thevisualizations\ndid not need to be georeferenced pictures but rather they conveyed the atmosphere of a\nparticular place. This was very important for the street-view pictures, which is why they often\nshowed everyday scenes containing people. We chose different visualization techniques\nthat might be used in planning workshops, including computer-aided georeferenced 3D\nvisualization techniques, GIS, Google Earth, and a specific town-planning CAD software. In\ncontrast, we also used artistic visualizations, such as Cinema 4D renderings in photographs\nand drawings by hand. The advantage of the georeferenced visualization techniques is that\nthe resulting pictures can provide an immediate basis for drafting concrete spatial plans such\nas zoning plans. This may make the workshop participants more aware that they are actually\ntalking about a real-world problem requiring decisions than the other artistic approaches\nused. Conversely, the drawings by hand and the Cinema 4D renderings may be better for\nreflecting the uncertainty of future visions about potential landscape development.\nFor Glarus Nord we produced the bird's\u00adeye-view pictures with a combination of the\nGIS software ArcGIS, GoogleEarth, and SketchUp (http://www.sketchup.com). The basis of\nthe street-view pictures was photographs, to which we added further objects using the CAD\nsoftware Cinema 4D (http://www.maxon.net). While Google Earth and the photographs\nshowed realistic images of the current landscape, the features inserted using SketchUp and\nCinema 4D (buildings, crop fields, vehicles, or people) were rather abstract. With this contrast\nwe intended to stress that the workshop was about visions and potential developments, and not\nabout tangible details of current projects. Prior to the workshop, the operators had prepared\nnot only the images of the initial situation but also different layers of possible landscape\nchanges. This helped to save time when adjusting the screen layout during the workshop. The\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 189\noperators could, however, still modify the pictures by adding or removing single buildings.\nThe preliminary results of the discussions were saved as screenshots. After the workshop, the\noperators developed the images in more detail, particularly the renderings from the bird's-eye\nperspective.\nIn Lucerne's Seetal, a scientific illustrator drew pictures of potential future landscape\nstates according to the inputs of the workshop participants. She used pastel chalks, which she\napplied with various paintbrushes. In this way, she could easily paint over certain objects or\nerase them. She used a sketching technique that allowed her to draw very quickly, drawing\nsilhouettes only, leaving out details, or drawing only the main characteristics of certain\nfeatures. Before the workshop she painted the initial pictures from photographs. She was\nalso able to test how best to display possible landscape changes in a pilot run at our research\ninstitute, and to develop more routine in the drawing technique. During the workshop in\nthe case study region, a second operator took photographs of the preliminary results of the\ndiscussion. We also had the possibility of projecting the photographs onto a screen.\nIn the Linth plain we used the UrbanRoiDesigner (URD), which is a CAD software\ndeveloped specifically for town planning (http://www.urbanroidesigner.com). Prior to the\nworkshop, the operator produced a georeferenced terrain model of the region, which could be\nviewed either from a bird's-eye or street-view perspective at any user-defined place. In addition,\nthe operator had prepared stencils of possible landscape changes. In contrast to the digital\nvisualization techniques used in Glarus Nord (GIS, Google Earth, SketchUp, photographs,\nand Cinema 4D), the URD landscape model showed a very rough picture of the natural\nenvironment, but buildings were displayed in much more detail. This was due partly to the\nfact that URD is a town-planning software. Moreover, URD's screen layout was much quicker\nat generating the landscape picture the smaller the amount of information given. During the\nworkshop, the images were modified immediately. The participants told the operator how they\nwished the landscape to be designed and the operator implemented their ideas in the pictures.\nThe preliminary results of the discussions were again saved as screenshots.\nExamples of the visualizations are presented in figure 1.\n2.6 Workshop evaluation\nAfter the workshops we asked the participants at the workshop without visualization to fill in\na questionnaire with eight standardized questions about the workshop, and at the workshops\nwith visualization to fill in a questionnaire with twelve questions. All questions were written\nas statements and the participants had to indicate their agreement on a five-point scale (5 =\nfully agree,...,1 = fully disagree). In all four workshops, we presented the same statements:\nhow well the visualizations, or the workshop design generally, had supported the participants\nin imagining future landscape states, how well they had served as a common basis for\ncommunication, and how well they had helped the group to develop new ideas.The last question\nin all four workshops asked the participants how much fun they had during the workshop. The\nquestionnaires for the workshops with visualization contained four additional questions about\nhow well the participants could understand the contents of the images. In the questionnaire for\nthe workshop without visualizations, we asked them participants if it mattered that there were\nnovisualizations. As the number of participants was rather small, we refrained from conducting\na detailed statistical analysis of the results and focused on the distribution of the answers as\nshown in bar charts in section 3and in the medians for the responses.\nWe also assessed the workshops qualitatively. The photographers of the workshop\nprocess had the additional task of observing the participants' reactions to the visualizations\nand their behaviour in the group work at the workshop without any visualization. After the\nfinal workshop, the whole research team met to exchange their impressions of the workshops.\nNo video records were made in order to ensure privacy protection.\n190 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\n3.1 Summary of the questionnaire results\nFigures 2 and 3 present the distributions of the ratings for each statement in the questionnaire.\nWe grouped the statements according to the research questions presented in the introduction.\nAfter each workshop, all participants returned their questionnaires. As not everybody\ncompleted all statements, the number of answers to the single statements was between 7 and\n13. The distributions of the ratings differed for the statements and for the different workshops\n3.2 Imagining future landscape conditions\nThree statements in the questionnaire considered the first research question: (1)Does real-\ntime visualization support the participants in imagining future landscape conditions? Only\nthe workshop with the drawings by hand achieved high ratings for all statements in question\n1 [see figure 2(a) \u00ad (c)], with narrow distributions around the highest scores, showing that the\nparticipants agreed fully (score 5) or rather (score 4) with all three statements. This indicates\nthat the visualizations had helped them better understand the problem discussed, and helped\nthem more than the workshop without visualization. This suggests that visualization in the\nform of hand sketches really supported the participants in imagining future landscape states.\nResponses to the same statements on the digital visualization techniques indicate these\nwere less helpful in supporting participants in imagining future landscape states. When the\nparticipants at the workshops with visualization were asked directly, they all agreed that the\nvisualizations were helpful for developing spatial scenarios [figure 2(c)]. However, after the\nFigure 1. [In colour online.] Examples of the visualizations: (a) combination ofArcGIS, Google Earth,\nand SketchUp (CAD software); (b) photo-manipulation with Cinema 4D; (c) and (d) drawings by hand\nwith pastel chalk on paper; (e) and (f) UrbanRoiDesigner URD (CAD software).\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 191\nFigure 2. [In colour online.] Distribution of the answers to the questionnaire. Numerals (1) to (4)\ncorrespond to the research questions explored in the statements in the questionnaire: (a) (I) Does\nreal-time visualization support the participants in imagining future landscape conditions? (b) (2)\nDoes real-time visualization stimulate the participants to develop new ideas? (c) (3) Does real-time\nvisualization provide a common basis for communication? (d) (4) Is real-time visualization only a fun\nfactor? X-axis: 5 = fully agree; 4 = rather agree; 3 = partly agree; 2 = rather disagree; 1= fully disagree.\nThe colours of the bars indicate the different visualization techniques: blue = GIS, SketchUp, Cinema\n4D; violet = drawings by hand; green = URD (CAD); red = no visualization.\n192 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\nworkshop without visualization, the participants differed in how much they reported missing\nthe presence of visualizations during the workshop.\n3.3 Inspiring new ideas\nOur second research question (2) explored whether real-time visualization helped the\nparticipants to develop new ideas. Statements were included to determine (1) how much\nthe visualization used supported the participants in decision making [figure 2(d)], , and (2)\nhow much it enhanced their creativity [figure 2(e)] . The distributions in figure 2(d) suggest\nthat, surprisingly, the participants at the workshop without visualization felt better supported\nin making up their minds than those at the workshops with visualization. The median\nfor this workshop is 4, whereas for all workshops with visualization it is 3. Considering\nfigure 2(e), the participants' ratings of the workshop without visualization are much more\nconcentrated (on the neutral value) than the ones from the other workshops . The opinions\nfrom the workshops with visualization show extremely even distributions, irrespective of\nthe visualization techniques. This means that the participants' opinions differed greatly, so\nwhether real-time visualization has a stimulating effect seems to depend on the individual\npreferences of the participants.\n3.4 Common basis for communication\nThe third research question (3) raises the issue of whether real-time visualizations provide\na common basis for communication? As the distributions in figure 2(f) suggest, at least in\nterms of the drawings by hand (median = 4.5) and the combination of GIS, CAD, and Cinema\n4D (median = 4), the visualization did seem to provide a common basis for discussion.\nFigure 3. [In colour online.] Distribution of the answers to the statements in the questionnaire that\nconsidered the participants'perception of the different visualization techniques. The colours of the bars\nindicate the different visualization techniques: blue = GIS, SketchUp, Cinema 4D; violet = drawings\nby hand; green = URD (CAD).\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 193\nHowever, the participants' ratings of the workshop without visualization also indicate that\nthe participants rather agreed with the statement. Hence, visualization is not a prerequisite\nfor establishing a common basis for communication at participatory workshops. Considering\nfigure 2(g), the distributions of the ratings are particularly interesting. The participants at\nthe workshop with the URD software reported feeling most influenced in their discussion\nby the visualization. There the participants were directly involved in the image creation and\nmay have felt limited by the software. As one participant said after the workshop: \"I think\nin this case the visualization even impeded the participants in developing visionary ideas.\"\nThe participants at the workshop with the drawings by hand were also involved in creating\nthe pictures, and their ratings in figure 2(g) were divided . Half felt too strongly influenced\nby the visualization, while the others did not. Participants at the workshop with GIS, CAD\nand Cinema 4D, where most pictures had been prepared in advance, reported feeling less\ninfluenced in their discussions, as did those at the workshop without any visualization. To\nconclude, in our case study, visualization revealed not only having advantages but also\ndrawbacks for guiding the discussion at a participatory workshop, depending on the main\npurpose of the workshop.\nIs real-time visualization only a fun factor? Our fourth research question (4) referred to the\nfrequently made conclusion that visualization enhances participants' motivation to become\ninvolved in landscape-planning decisions (eg, Al-Kodmany, 1999; Wissen Hayek, 2011).\nFrom the ratings in figure 2(h) , we cannot conclude that participants at the workshops with\nvisualization had more fun than those at the workshop without visualization. During the\npreparation for the workshops, the participants were equally spontaneous in accepting our\ninvitation to attend regardless of whether there was or was not visualization. Our participants\nmight have signed up, because they wanted to get involved in the future development of their\nregions anyway. Hence, the motivation to attend a workshop does not depend on the fact that\nthere will or will not be visualization. Moreover, real-time visualization does not necessarily\nimprove the atmosphere at a workshop.\n3.6 Perception of visualizations\nOur last research question (5) explored whether the different visualization techniques are\nperceived differently using four statements in figures 3(a) \u00ad 3(d) . The distributions of the\nparticipants' ratings are given in figure 3. The drawings by hand achieved the best ratings\nthroughout. The participants reported understanding the information presented in these\nvisualizations most easily [figure 3(a)] and also found they had the best degree of detail and\nlevel of abstraction of information [figure 3(b) \u00ad 3(d)] . The URD pictures appeared to be\nleast understandable since they were rated as not sufficiently tangible, too abstract, and too\nlittle detailed. The combination images produced with GIS, CAD, and Cinema 4D appeared\nto be rather easily understood but participants rated their detailed qualities similarly to those\nin the URD pictures, that is, not tangible enough, too abstract, and not detailed enough. The\ndrawings by hand were richer in detail than the digital visualizations, but their information\nwas actually very fuzzy and many details, such as storks in a fen or a child's push chair, were\nonly marked with tokens. As the participants had to develop visions of the landscape more\nthan fifteen years in the future, the rather fuzzy drawings by hand may have been best suited\nfor this task, which, in itself, includes a high degree of uncertainty.\n3.7 Lessons learned from observations\nAfter the last workshop, the members of the research team shared their impressions of the\nworkshops in a separate meeting. Most felt that the pictures had focused the discussions on the\nspecific locations or subjects they represented. At the workshops with real-time visualization\n194 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\nthe discussions concentrated on visual aspects, whereas at the workshop without visualization\nthe discussions emphasized social and cultural topics. Considering creativity, visualization\nmay even have hindered the participants in developing innovative and visionary ideas. Not\nonly did the researchers observing the workshops come to this conclusion, but also one\nparticipant at the workshop with the URD visualization, who also criticised the visualization\ntool (see also subsection3.4). In contrast, we observed that the participants at the workshop\nwithout visualization expressed rather innovative thoughts in the group discussions, but for\nsome reason failed to present these ideas in the plenary discussion afterwards.\nThe visualizations supported the discussions to different extents. Particularly in the\nworkshop with drawings by hand, participants repeatedly left their seats to explain what\nthey meant by pointing at the pictures to indicate how they could be developed further. The\nworkshop using drawings by hand was most successful in developing a shared picture of\nfuture landscape states. The digital visualizations also motivated the participants to comment\non the pictures and state their wishes and ideas for change. However, during the screen layout\nof the revised pictures, the discussions tended to move on to other topics (irrespective of\nthe pictures) much more than in the hand sketch workshop. The reason for this may be that\nthe visualization interventions can be followed much better with drawings by hand than\nwith CAD. The moments with frozen screens seemed to irritate the workshop participants.\nThe screen froze several times during the visualization with the URD software because the\nimages were produced directly according to the participants' instructions. The moments of\nuntraceable image processing were fewer for the visualizations with the combination of GIS,\nCAD, and Cinema 4D because a variety of possible scenes had been produced in advance in\nspecific layers.\n4 Discussion\nWe wanted to determine the contribution of different visualization techniques to developing\nlong-term landscape visions in small stakeholder workshops. Our study differs from other\nstudies of real-time visualization in that the focus was on visioning and on comparing the\nworkshopswithandthosewithoutvisualization,andthedifferentvisualizationtechniques.Our\nresearch design was useful for exploring the limitations of visualization during participatory\nworkshops, and for highlighting the advantages of manual visualization techniques.\nFirst, our findings show that real-time visualization may be helpful, but is not a necessary\nprerequisite for a successful landscape planning workshop.At first glance, our results support\nthe findings of other authors that visualization during workshops helps participants to imagine\nthe potential development of their home regions (e.g. Salter et al, 2009; Schroth et al, 2011;\nWissen Hayek, 2011). However, when compared with the results of our workshop without\nvisualization this effect appears to be rather moderate, especially as in the workshop without\nvisualization the participants said they did not miss it. In addition, visualization appears to\nfocus the discussion very much on visible aspects only, and participants tended to ignore\nsocial and other nonvisible topics. Therefore, issues involving such aspects may overstretch\nthe capabilities of visualization.\nOur findings do not, in spite of the enhanced research design, support clearly the claim\nthat real-time visualization helps participants to develop ideas and visions. The respective\neffect of group work in the workshop without visualization was rather similar to the effect of\nthe visualizations in the workshops. Wissen Hayek (2011) also queries whether visualization\ncan inspire the generation of new ideas. This requirement may also go beyond the potential\nof visualization.\nReal-time visualization was found to influence the discussions on landscape visions by\neither supporting or manipulating them. Our results support the view that visualization can\nReal-time visualization for landscape visioning 195\nprovide a common basis for communication. This, however, only holds true if the participants\nare able to follow the screen layout; otherwise the discussion runs the risk of digressing from\nthe subject illustrated. Furthermore, it has to be noted that the participants may also feel\nrestricted in their creativity due to the limitations of the visualization techniques, or because\nthe visualization focuses the discussion on visible aspects. This may explain why half the\nparticipants in the hand-sketch workshop felt too strongly influenced by the visualization,\nalthough they could follow the screen layout very easily. Only in the workshop without\nvisualization did the participants discuss social and cultural topics (see also subsection3.7).\nThus, our results support both types of studies: those that recommend visualization as a way\nto provide a common basis for discussion (eg, Schroth et al, 2011; Wissen Hayek, 2011), and\nthose that warn that visualization may restrict discussion (eg,. Lewis et al, 2012; Salter et al,\nOur main finding in terms of visualization techniques was that drawings by hand were\nvery useful for creating visions and scenarios. More sophisticated digital 3D visualization\ntechniques are not necessary for this purpose. The URD software was developed for\narchitecture and town planning and is not very suitable for modelling landscapes in its current\nstage of development. The other digital 3D visualization techniques have similar limitations.\nAl-Kodmany (1999) also recommends sketches and drawings by hand for the visioning\nphase of a workshop. Thus, it is important for workshop moderators to choose carefully the\nvisualization technique best suited to the problem to be discussed. The visualization technique\nmust be able to present the issues in a sufficiently tangible and detailed way.At the same time,\nthe picture's degree of accuracy or fuzziness must be appropriate for the planning phase.\nTherefore, we recommend that research should not focus on technical improvements only,\nbut should also consider using manual visualization techniques during the different planning\nstages. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Al-Kodmany (1999), Salter et al (2009),\nand Lewis et al (2012). Studies recommending the development of more photorealistic 3D\n2011) may refer to applications for short-term and advanced planning projects.\n5 Conclusions\nOur findings show that real-time visualization can be advantageous for the participatory\ndevelopment of landscape visions. However, we recommend paying attention to whether\nvisualization is actually suitable for representing the topic of the workshop. Visualization\nproved to be most useful where visual aspects are decisive but is not indispensable for\ngenerating visions about the future quality of life in a region. Moreover, visualization is\nnot essential for stimulating new ideas at a workshop, as we found at our workshop without\nvisualization.\nThe particular strength of real-time visualization is in providing a common basis for the\ndiscussion. On the other hand, if the pictures are created according to their wishes, participants\nmay feel overly influenced in their discussion. Therefore, we recommend choosing carefully\nthe technique that corresponds best to the planning phase and the accuracy or fuzziness of the\nproblem to be discussed. Sophisticated 3D simulations are by no means always necessary.\nDrawings by hand may be very suitable for fuzzy visioning or brainstorming. In addition, this\ntechnique can make a workshop very lively because the drawing process is easily traceable\nand familiar to everybody. In particular, where local authorities do not have powerful\nfinancial and IT resources, drawings by hand offer attractive options to implement real-time\nvisualization in planning workshops.\nWe, like many other researchers, also recommend continuing research on visualization\nduring participatory workshops. The emphasis of this research should, however, be more\n196 S Tobias, T Buser, M Buchecker\non participants' perceptions of the visualizations and their requirements, rather than on\ndeveloping technical simulation tools.\n"
