The\npresent study assesses the distribution of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the United States across the 5\ngroups of CHD risk as defined in the updated guidelines.\nand Nutrition Examination Survey representing 171 million individuals in the United States. CHD risk, LDL-C\nlevels, and goal achievement were determined per Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. CHD risk assessment\nincorporated a medical condition review, risk factor summation, and Framingham Risk Score calculation.\nPercentages were weighted to represent population estimates, and SEs were adjusted for the survey design. The\ndistribution of individuals by CHD risk included 61.1% at lower risk, 10.6% at high risk, and 5.7% at very high\nrisk. From Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, only 5.4% of the population was at \"intermediate\" risk. Two thirds\n(66.3%) met their Adult Treatment Panel III\u00addefined LDL-C goal. Of those at high and very high risk, 23% and\n(or non\u00adhigh-density lipoprotein C 100 mg/dL).\nConclusions--Most adult US residents are at lower 10-year CHD risk and meet risk-adjusted LDL-C goals. However, large\nportions of the high-risk population are undertreated. The commonly described population at intermediate risk is small.\nA novel method of identifying patients who might benefit from additional testing to determine their treatment strategy\nKey Words: cardiovascular diseases  cholesterol  guidelines  lipids  risk factors\nThe National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-\nment Panel (ATP III) guidelines provided a detailed\nprocess for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment\nbased on the presence of high-risk medical conditions, the\npresence or absence of 5 risk factors (RFs), and the Framing-\nham Risk Score (FRS).1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(LDL-C) goals and appropriate therapy were individualized\nfor each of 4 risk groups. A recent update added a fifth \"very\nhigh-risk\" group, decreased the LDL-C goal for the 3 highest-\nrisk groups, and increased its complexity.2 Previous studies\nused older data and/or older guidelines to estimate the\ndistribution of cardiac risk3 and lipid levels in the United\nA recent study focused on the sizes of CHD risk groups and\nachievement of LDL-C goals; however, it did not address an\nimportant group of patients, those considered at \"intermedi-\nate\" risk.6 The size of this group is a matter of clinical and\neconomic importance. Without an accurate understanding of\nthe numbers of individuals in the United States at intermedi-\nate risk, policies for additional screening with new imaging or\nblood tests7 cannot be assessed for their impact on clinical\npractice and healthcare costs.\nExamination Survey (NHANES) data set to evaluate the US\nContinuing medical education (CME) credit is available for this article.

We evaluated the clinical\nimpact of each step in the risk assessment algorithm by\nestimating the number of individuals for whom that step\ndefined a CHD risk level. We then substratified the 5 risk\ngroups by 6 LDL-C levels to create a 30-cell matrix. This\nmatrix allowed visual integration of cardiac risk and LDL-C\nlevels to identify the population most in need of further\nevaluation for best treatment decisions.\nMethods\nParticipants and Exclusions\nNHANES is conducted in 2-year phases of health interviews,\nphysical examinations, and laboratory testing at a mobile exam-\nination center. Through the use of demographic and geographical\ndata, weights are assigned to each subject so that their sum\nrepresents the entire civilian noninstitutionalized US population.\nThe present study uses data from all subjects 20 to 79 years of age\npublished a detailed account of its methods and protocols\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\nSubjects were excluded if they currently were pregnant, received\ncancer chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the examination, or lacked\ncholesterol or blood pressure data to allow risk assessment and\nLDL-C stratification (Table 1).\nHigh-Risk Diagnosis and RF Definitions\nFor the purposes of the present study, definitions of risk diagnoses\nand RFs use available NHANES data fields (see the Appendix in the\nonline Data Supplement) and are described below. The 4 diagnoses\nthat classify a subject as high risk include the following:\n CHD: Subjects who reported being told by a healthcare profes-\nsional that they had a myocardial infarction, heart attack, coronary\nartery disease, or angina pectoris. Subjects were considered to\nhave \"hard\" CHD if they had CHD defined by a condition other\nthan angina pectoris alone.\n Diabetes mellitus (DM): Subjects who reported being told by a\nhealthcare professional that they had DM, reported taking insulin\nor oral hypoglycemic medications, had a random blood glucose\n200 mg/dL, or had a fasting (8 hours before venipuncture)\n Peripheral vascular disease: Ankle brachial index 0.9 in either\nleg.\n Cerebrovascular disease: Subjects who reported history of a\nstroke.\nThe 5 standard ATP III RFs used to risk stratify subjects include\nthe following:\n Advanced age: Men 45 years; women 55 years.\n Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): 40 mg/dL\n(60 mg/dL counts as a negative RF).\n Hypertension: Systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, diastolic\nblood pressure 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive\nmedication.\n Cigarette smoking: Currently smoking every day or some days and\nreported having smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.5\n Family history: NHANES variable MCQ250G, family history of\npremature CHD in subjects reporting a heart attack or angina in\ngrandparents, parents, or siblings 50 years of age.\nMetabolic syndrome is used to subclassify those at very high risk\nand was present if a subject met at least 3 of the following 5 criteria:\n Waist circumference 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women. If\nwaist circumference was not available, body mass index 30\nkg/m2 was substituted for this diagnostic criterion.9,10\n Fasting triglycerides 150 mg/dL or random triglycerides 400\nmg/dL.\n HDL-C 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women.\n Blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive\nmedication.\nFramingham Risk Score\nThe FRS is a standard method to assess cardiovascular risk.1,12 Seven\ncomponents are used to estimate the 10-year risk of CHD events\n(heart attack or CHD death).

This group excludes those with the combi-\nnations above defined as very high risk.\n Moderately high risk: Subjects with no high-risk diagnoses, 2\nATP III RFs, and FRS of 10% to 20%.

Subjects were\nstratified into the same 6 groups by the use of thresholds correspond-\ning to the respective ATP III goals for non\u00adHDL-C (30 mg/dL higher\nthan LDL-C goals).2\nThe ATP III update uses the risk levels to define LDL-C (or\nnon\u00adHDL-C) values for use as goals and thresholds for initiating\ntherapy.2 These goals and thresholds match the cut points for the 6\nLDL-C (or non\u00adHDL-C) groups (Figure 1 and Table 2).\nBecause LDL-C levels are associated with some variation or\nuncertainty in treatment recommendations, we developed a novel\nmethod to clarify risk based on need for treatment change, For\nexample, among patients with CHD with LDL-C between 70 and 99\nmg/dL, therapy is described as \"optional\"2 or \"reasonable.\"15 To\naddress this ambiguity, for each risk level, LDL-C (and non\u00adHDL-C)\nlevels are defined as \"change unnecessary\" if below the range of\nrecommendations, \"change necessary\" if above levels requiring drug\ntherapy, and \"consider change\" when between these 2 levels.\nCategory assignment for this method of stratification is denoted by\ncell color in Figures 1 and 2.\nStatistical Analysis\nSubject data were downloaded from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm and imported into Microsoft Excel (version 11.2 for\nMacintosh, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash). Separate fields were\ndeveloped for each data point and clinical decision to model a virtual\nprevention clinic addressing each individual subject. Subjects were\nstratified by risk level and substratified by LDL-C or non\u00adHDL-C\nlevels, and total individuals were computed in each category.\nPopulation totals and percentages were calculated from the full-\nsample 4-year mobile-examination-center weight for each subject,\nwhich represents unbiased population estimates.16\ndata set includes 19 759 subjects with a combined weight represent-\ning 278.7 million individuals.

The matrix in Figure 1 provides several\ninsights into the risk assessment process.\nHigh- and Very High-Risk Individuals\nThere are 18.1 million individuals at high risk and 9.8 million\nat very high risk.2 Restricting to those with known CHD\n(including angina) identifies only 35% (9.7 million) of the 2\nhighest-risk groups. Hard CHD alone would identify only\nATP III expanded the definition of high risk to include\n\"CHD-equivalent\" conditions, nearly tripling its size. The\ndiagnosis of DM is made in 13.5 million, 34% of whom are\nat high risk by this diagnosis alone. High risk is uniquely\ndefined in 3.4 million because of 2 RFs and an FRS 20%,\n2.0 million because of a low ankle brachial index, and 1.4\nmillion because of stroke history. These findings have im-\nportant implications for clinics that assess cardiac risk.\nFailure to routinely measure ankle brachial indices, calculate\nFRS, or recognize patients in the very high-risk category may\nlead clinicians to underestimate cardiac risk in up to 11.1 of\n28.0 million high- and very high-risk individuals.\nCurrent cholesterol treatment guidelines maintain the\nas optional2 or reasonable,15 with particular emphasis on\nthose at very high risk. Only 4.6% of very high-risk and 3.1%\nof high-risk individuals have LDL-C 70 mg/dL. For these 2\nare not meeting the more conservative cholesterol goals\nNot all authors or groups define the very high-risk group\nsimilarly. A recent national survey observed that 75% of\npatients with cardiovascular disease were at very high risk.17\nThey defined \"multiple major RFs\" as 2 compared with 3\nin the present study. Repeating their analysis with a 3-RF\nthreshold, we find that 67.3% of US residents with known\ncardiovascular disease are at very high risk. Defining \"mul-\ntiple RFs\" as 2 RFs increases the same measure to 82.4%.\nBetter clarity of very high risk definition may be needed to\nimprove the utility of such comparisons.\nLower Risk\nThe next step in ATP III risk assessment is counting RFs and\nassigning those with 2 to the lower-risk category. We found\nWhen the RF count establishes lower-risk status, clinicians\nmust not reflexively assume that lipid treatment remains\nunnecessary. Of US residents, 4.10.8 million lower-risk\nmg/dL) for whom guidelines recommend medical therapy.\nAn additional 10.11.7 million are above the LDL-C goal of\n160 mg/dL and are candidates for lifestyle modifications and\nconsideration of medical therapy. This combined group is\nlarger than the moderately high- or very high-risk groups.\nOmitting HDL-C 60 mg/dL as a negative RF moves\nbecome moderately high risk on the basis of the FRS.\nrisk group) receive a new LDL-C goal with this omission.\nA broader question about the lower-risk group is how to\nassess the relative importance of RF counting versus the FRS.\nAlthough ATP III does not require it, assessing the FRS in all\n104.5 million individuals at lower risk by RFs identifies\n9.41.6 million with an FRS 6% (a threshold some suggest\nshould trigger additional testing).7 A previous analysis dem-\nonstrated that calculating the FRS before RF evaluation (an\noption in ATP III) reclassified the risk of 6 million\nindividuals in the lower-risk group.18\nIntermediate Risk and Use of the FRS\nWithout updated numbers that carefully apply guideline-\nbased risk stratification criteria, there have been widely\nvarying and potentially misleading estimates of the number of\nindividuals at intermediate risk, and guidelines recommend-\ning additional tests to assist with risk assessment have\nincorporated these estimates. The ATP III guidelines do not\ndefine an intermediate-risk group,1,2 but some have defined it\nas subjects without high-risk conditions but with 2 RFs and\nmoderately high-risk group.2 Although 1 report20 estimated\nthat this group was 40% of the US population and others have\nquoted this estimate,7 our study found just 5.4% at moder-\nately high risk. This finding suggests that previous reports\noverestimated the number of patients considered to be at\nintermediate risk. Low-risk patients were defined in 1 article\nas having \"a low-risk FRS [6%] and no major RFs outside\nthe desirable range.\"20 These authors estimated this group to\nbe 35% of the population. We applied these criteria to our\ndata set and found only 11.8 million subjects (6.9%) at low\nrisk by this definition.20 Subtracting the 17.9% of individuals\nat high or very high risk would imply that the remaining\n75.2% are at intermediate risk, 10-fold the size of the\nmoderately high-risk group in our analysis. Thus, the size of\nthis group is very sensitive to RF number and definitions.\nFor the purpose of considering additional testing, a recent\nconsensus conference expanded the definition of intermediate\nrisk to include an FRS of 6% to 20%.7 This definition change\nalone approximately doubled the size of the intermediate-risk\nprevious estimates.\nKeevil et al NHANES Distribution of LDL Cholesterol 1367\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nAfter high-risk subjects have been assigned by medical\nconditions and lower-risk subjects by RFs, ATP III recom-\nmends assessment by the FRS. Although some recent re-\nports19,21 equate the entire risk assessment process with the\nFRS by linking risk categories to the FRS, they are not the\nsame. In our study, after separating subjects with high-risk\nconditions and those at lower risk by RFs, only 24.51.6%\n(41.94.6 million) required FRS to determine their risk\nstatus. Only 15.02.3% of the high-risk group and none of\nthe very high-risk group use the FRS for risk assignment.\nThis suggests that the FRS alone should not be considered a\nsubstitute for the other components of the risk assessment\nprocess.\nFinding a Focused Group for Consideration of\nAdditional Testing\nA growing body of literature addresses how new imaging and\nblood tests may improve risk prediction.7,22,23 Subjects at\nmoderately high (intermediate) risk often are described as\nthose in greatest need of additional testing.7,22,23 However,\nmany in this risk group need no further evaluation to make\nclear decisions about LDL-C treatment (Figure 1). Subjects\nhigh-risk group) exceed thresholds for both lifestyle changes\nmoderately high group) are below the more aggressive\nthreshold of 100 mg/dL and thus do not require further\nmoderately high-risk group, 1.20.3% of the population)\nbenefit from further diagnostic information, it is small.\nOthers who may benefit from additional evaluation include\nhigh-risk patients with LDL-C 70 to 99 mg/dL who do not\nreceive clear treatment recommendations from the guidelines.\nIn addition, some lower- and moderate-risk patients have\nthresholds for initiating drug therapy that are 30 mg/dL\nhigher than their LDL-C goals, creating a clinical scenario in\nwhich the goal is not met but medications may not be clearly\nindicated. For example, a 60-year-old woman with no other\nRFs and an LDL-C of 185 mg/dL may pose a difficult\ndecision for the clinician because she is estimated to be at\nlower risk but with a high LDL-C. This may not be a rare\nclinical scenario because 10.11.7 million US residents fit\nthis narrow definition.\nFor additional testing, we suggest a novel method of\nselection based on the following 3 categories:\n Change unnecessary: For these 107.7 million individuals\n(63.2%), additional testing is unlikely to change treatment\nrecommendations (green in Figures 1 and 2).\nmost likely to benefit from additional testing that might\nreassign subjects into other risk groups (yellow in Figures\nshould initiate therapeutic interventions without additional\ntesting (red in Figures 1 and 2). There may be situations in\nwhich the initial therapy brings subjects into the \"consider\nchange\" level.\nThis categorization scheme combines the full risk assess-\nment process (medical condition review, RF summation, and\nFRS calculation) with LDL-C levels and may provide better\nguidance for individualized treatment and need for additional\ntesting.\nStudy Limitations\nNHANES data are collected by examination, laboratory\ntesting, and interview and therefore are subject to sampling\nand nonsampling errors. Interview data based on self-report\nare subject to recall bias and misunderstanding of questions.\nAdditionally, NHANES does not include the incarcerated or\ninstitutionalized populations of the United States.24\nSome of the NHANES variables do not precisely match\nthose in the ATP III guidelines or clinical practice. For\ninstance, NHANES reports family history of CHD as a parent\nor grandparent 50 years of age without gender distinction,\nwhereas ATP III recognizes family history as an RF if CHD\nafflicts a male first-degree relative 55 years of age or a\nfemale first-degree relative 65 years of age.1 We diagnosed\nDM from a single glucose sample with different thresholds\nbased on the fasting time. A second sample and/or a glucose\ntolerance test were not available. We included stroke as a\nCHD risk equivalent. Some subjects with stroke match the\nATP III criteria of \"symptomatic carotid disease,\" but others\nlikely experienced hemorrhagic or cardioembolic stokes with\nless well-defined correlation to future cardiac risk. Thus, the\nnated high on the basis of a history of a stroke alone may be\noverestimated. No test for aortic aneurysm or history of aortic\nsurgery is included in NHANES, so some CHD risk\u00adequiva-\nlent subjects may be unrecognized. Our definition of CHD\nincluded 48 subjects representing 1.00.4 million individuals\n(0.60.2%) for whom angina was the only high-risk diagno-\nsis. Risk in this small subset may be overestimated by this\nsofter end point.\nNo data identifying recent acute coronary syndrome are\npresent, likely resulting in some subjects being classified as\nhigh risk instead of very high risk. Furthermore, the definition\nof the very high-risk group in ATP III is vague because it\nincludes, for example, \"multiple\" and \"severe\" RFs without\nexplicitly defining these terms.2\nFor subjects with short fasting times or triglycerides 400\nmg/dL, we calculated non\u00adHDL-C. Subjects then were as-\nsigned to the LDL-C level associated with the corresponding\nnon\u00adHDL-C goal (30 mg/dL higher). This approach follows\nthe ATP III recommendation of using the non\u00adHDL-C goal in\nthis situation.1 The NHANES data set does not provide\ninformation on fibrate or niacin use, so some subjects might\nnot qualify for the latest metabolic syndrome criteria.25\nFinally, the present study includes 4 years from NHANES,\nwhich represent a sample of the country from a fixed range in\ntime. More recent data may be slightly different.\nDespite these limitations, the estimates provided here are\nsimilar to those independently published by a research group\nfrom another institution.6 In addition to providing signifi-\ncantly more detail on the number of Americans in the\ndifferent cardiovascular risk groups and their treatment status\nby LDL-C goals, the present study adds unique information\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ndescribing how patients at high and very high risk qualified\nfor these designations. In addition, this discussion focuses\nspecifically on the number of patients at intermediate risk, the\nimplications of this designation for additional testing, and the\nimplications of errors in risk stratification.\nConclusions\nThe present study offers important information to policy\nmakers and those needing estimates of the size of the at-risk\npopulation based on the presence of CHD, RFs, and LDL-C\nlevels. This study also provides 3 additions to the understand-\ning of cardiovascular risk assessment: (1) assessment of CHD\nrisk in the entire US population, (2) substratification of CHD\nrisk by levels of LDL-C, and (3) identification of clinical\ngroups oriented around the necessity of reducing LDL-C.\nThis study underscores the importance of a complete clinical\nevaluation to accurately identify high-risk subjects rather than\nusing only the FRS.\nThe majority of the population (61%) is at lower risk as\ndefined by current guidelines. A significant percentage (34%)\nof individuals from all risk levels has not met LDL-C goals.\nThe commonly described group of patients at intermediate\nrisk (5.4%) is much smaller than previously estimated and\ncontains few subjects for whom treatment recommendations\nare not clear. A novel strategy for identifying patients who\nmay benefit most from additional testing is provided.\n"
