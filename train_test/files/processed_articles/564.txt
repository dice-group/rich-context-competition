The astonishing projected\ngrowth in the number and proportion of the older\nadult population worldwide requires an equally\nextraordinary policy response \u00ad one that should be\ninformed by ageing research. To this end, given the\npopular media excitement about the new research\nfrontiers presented by \"Big Data\", one might think\nthe issue of limited data to inform health policy and\nprepare for an ageing world mooted (Borgman 2015).\nYet the limits to currently available data become ever\nmore evident when examining two ongoing scientific\ndebates about our ageing world: whether or not limits\nto human life span exist, and whether healthy life\nexpectancy will keep pace with increasing average\nlife expectancy (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002; Olshansky\nWhile the demographic data are robust, the lack of\nepidemiological data to resolve crucial ageing-related\nquestions is profound. These fundamental unknowns\nabout the health of ageing populations have practical\nimplications, as poor health among the growing\nnumber of older adults will reduce their social and\neconomic participation, and have real and significant\ncosts for health and pension systems.\nIn today's currency, demographic change is\ninexorably linked to development, bolstering the case\nthat people do matter to economics (Schumacher 1973;\nSachs 2015). And the economics of an ageing world\ncontinues to evolve as this unprecedented population\nhorizon forces shifts in thinking about existing social\npacts. This new social settlement needs to take on\nwell-being, health and social justice for all (Stiglitz et\nin health can have widespread and equitable social\nreturns (Suhrcke et al., 2006; Fried & Paccaud\ncontinuing to make considerable social, economic,\nand cultural contributions to society, this is somewhat\ndependent on how well we age.

Ageing is a major driver in the leading\ncauses of NCD burden, even while the majority of\ncommunity dwelling older adults are likely to age\nwithout considerable disease or disability, and remain\neconomically and socially active. Large variations exist\nwithinandacrosscountries,atalllevelsofdevelopment,\nbut universally, individuals at the lower income levels\nare at higher risk of disease and disability, with greater\nneed for health care, long-term care, social care and\npensions. Global NCD burden is increasing, with\nrapid rise in incidence and prevalence in lower middle\nincome countries (LMICs), and particularly among the\npoorest people (Hotez & Peiperl 2015). The prevention\nof NCDs is therefore a global priority, with needs for\nbetter understanding of the patterns and determinants\nof health and well-being, effective prevention\nstrategies, and evolution of evidence-based policies\nto ensure the extra years lived are quality years. Even\nwith major improvements in the prevention of common\nchronic conditions, the increase in the numbers of\nolder people will likely result in greater disease burden.\nWithout concerted efforts to decrease the incidence of\nthese conditions, at current health levels or worsening\nhealth in successive cohorts of ageing adults, the\nburden will be even greater. Moreover, given that the\nlargest proportion (66%) of older persons reside in\nlow and middle income countries (LMICs), the largest\nproportion of NCD deaths and burden are in LMICs (UN\nThis paper will highlight current evidence about\nhealthandwell-beingthatcouldencourageinvestment\nin health for older populations. The paper uses the\nexample of hypertension throughout to illustrate\nhow data collection efforts are translating research\nto policy.

Although\nit is easily diagnosed and can be effectively treated\nthe burden of hypertension continues to grow as\nawareness,preventionandtreatmentlags,particularly\nfor the poor and old (Olsen & Spencer 2015). The focus\nis brought back to how current research can inform\npolicy for ageing populations in the final section,\nusing Ireland's experience to demonstrate how to\nlegislate the good life for older adults (Seaford 2011).\nResearch and policy to address\na silent killer\nHypertension is only second to diet as a leading\nfactor in death and morbidity worldwide, and\ntoo often provides no warning signs or symptoms\nHypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure\n140mg Hg or above and/or diastolic blood pressure\nand is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease,\nstroke, renal failure and congestive heart failure,\nwith significant impacts on premature mortality and\ndisability. Around 54% of stroke and 47% of ischaemic\nheart disease can be attributed to hypertension as the\nmajor risk factor (Lawes 2008). The burden of these\nconditions is greater in LMICs than in higher income\nsettings, and continues to increase largely due to\nundetected and uncontrolled hypertension. (World\nThe risk of hypertension increases with age, and\nis associated with lifestyle factors such as unhealthy\ndiet, harmful use of alcohol, lack of physical activity,\nexcess weight and exposure to persistent stress.\nHypertension also frequently co-exists with other risk\nfactors such as smoking, obesity, high cholesterol and\ndiabeteswhichalsoincreasetherisksofcardiovascular\ndisease and other poor health outcomes for older\npeople (Fan et al., 2015). The risk of hypertension and\nthese other risk factors is also highest among people\nwith the lowest socio-economic status, even in high\nHypertension is one of the most common risk\nfactors affecting older people, with prevalence\nestimates ranging from 46% of adults aged 25 years\nand over in Africa, to 35% in the Americas and 40%\nin the rest of the world (Lozano et al 2011). High\nsystolic blood pressure was found to be the sixth\nleading risk factor for morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa\n(Forouzanfar, et al., 2015), and the African Union,\nrecently released the \"Status Report on Hypertension\nin Africa\" acknowledging the need to share best\npractices and policies, and for coordinated research\nResults from the multi-country WHO Study on\nglobal AGEing and adult health (SAGE) also showed\nhigh rates of hypertension in adults aged 50 years\nand older ranging from 78% in South Africa to 32% in\nIndia, and with consistently higher levels for women\nthan for men (Kowal et al., 2012; Lloyd-Sherlock et al.,\nPaul Kowal, Julie E. Byles: 900 million and counting. Epidemiologic data for demographic and policy transitions.\n2014). The proportion of hypertensive individuals who\nwere aware of their diagnosis ranged from a high of\n72% in Russia to less than 45% in all other countries.\nMoreover the proportion of people with hypertension\nwhose condition was effectively controlled was very\nsmall, ranging from 4% in Ghana to 14% in India\nThese striking numbers can excite media\nattention, spur impetus for action, and bolster\npolitical will. Yet the reality of addressing the problem\nis rather mundane, requiring difficult, multi-sectoral,\nmulti-pronged, coordinated approaches that must\ngo well beyond the ephemera of news headlines\nand political slogans. In one example of a concerted\nmove to prevention, the South African government\nhas embarked on a strategy to reduce hypertension\nthrough salt reduction legislation, and early detection\nand treatment (Mail and Guardian 2014; Business\nDay 2014). The South African Department of Health\nis responsible for operationalising the framework\nto address NCDs, including a reduction in the mean\npopulation intake of salt to less than 5g per day by\n2020, and a reduction in the prevalence of people\nlifestyle and medication (Department of Health 2013).\nTo meet these health outcomes, South Africa opted for\na strategy that involves a combination of legislation\nand public education, partnering with the Heart\nand Stroke Foundation South Africa (Charlton et al.,\ntake effect in 2016, with WHO SAGE in South Africa\n(and Ghana for comparison) providing required data\nto measure changes in hypertension and salt intake\n(through interviews, measurements and 24 hour urine\nIn China, which is a very large and rapidly ageing\ncountry, hypertension prevalence in SAGE was 60%\nin adults aged 50 years and older, with just 43%\naware they have high blood pressure (Lloyd-Sherlock\net al., 2014). Likewise among people in the Trial on\nCommunity-based Screening in Beijing, 53% of people\naged 50 years and over had high blood pressure, and\n30% of these people were not previously aware of\ntheir condition (Jiang et al., 2014). In the China Health\nand Retirement Longitudinal Study of adults aged 45\nyears or older, 38.6% had hypertension, more than\n40% of these people were unaware they had high\nblood pressure, and more than half of these were not\nreceiving treatment (Feng et al., 2014).\nThe World Health Organization is currently\nworking to support the Chinese government to reduce\nthe premature burden of NCDs and to address other\nchallenges of population ageing by taking a life-\ncourse approach to health. The strategic approach is\nto promote advocacy and multi-sectoral approaches to\naddress the social and lifestyle determinants of poor\nhealth, and to provide technical and policy support\nfor an integrated package of health services for the\nprevention and control of NCDs (China Ministry of\nData from another large country, Indonesia, also\nidentify hypertension as a major problem confronting\nageing population.

This increase in hypertension\noccurs in the context of rapid economic development,\nurbanization and increased rates of poverty, and\nwidening inequity. In the Indonesian Family Life\nStudy, the prevalence of hypertension varied greatly\nacross geographical areas and socioeconomic strata.\nThe age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was\n28.9% in the less socioeconomically advantaged group\nand24.7%in the moreadvantagedgroup, with muchof\nthis inequality accounted for by different distributions\nof body mass index (BMI) and education. Higher BMI\namong the more advantaged group increased the\nprevalence of hypertension in this group and reduced\nthe inequality (accounting for 18% of inequality),\nwhereas lower education among the less advantaged\ngroup increased hypertension inequality (accounting\nAs in other countries, Indonesia has many\nopportunities to improve the health of its ageing\npopulation through control of NCDs and risk factors.\nHowever effective health policy must necessarily\nintersect with the policy and actions from other\ngovernment sectors, local governance structures,\nand the influence of industry. The government has\nintroduced programs for universal access to health\nservices (Sparrow et al., 2013), and runs community-\nbased integrated health services for older people\n(Pertiwi 2013). However, there is scope for expansion\nof these programs and to increase their focus on NCD\nrisk factors (Christiani et al., paper accepted 2015).\nJust next door to Indonesia, hypertension is one\nof the most common chronic conditions affecting\nolder people in Australia. Figure 1 shows data from\nthe Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health\n(ALSWH) and demonstrates the increase in prevalence\nof hypertension with age and across successive\nPaul Kowal, Julie E.

Risk of hypertension\namong these women was strongly associated with\noverweight and obesity, with greater physical activity\npartially mitigating against effects of weight (Jackson\net al., 2014). The odds of developing hypertension\nalmost doubled among overweight women and more\nthan tripled among obese women compared to women\nin the healthy weight range. However, the probability\nof hypertension increases across the entire BMI\ndistribution, with increased risk not exclusive to the\noverweight or obese group. A hypothetical one unit\nchange in the entire BMI distribution, where every\nwoman loses weight, was estimated to result in a\n10.3% reduction in the proportion of women with\nhypertension. In contrast, if BMI reduced by three\nunits in the top 20% of the distribution (BMI > 29) (that\nis, only very overweight or obese women lose weight),\nthe corresponding reduction in incidence would be\nonly 7.3%. This analysis demonstrates the importance\nof a whole-population strategy to disease prevention,\nrather only attempting to achieve greater weight loss\namong the most overweight (Brown et al., 2007). Of\nconcern, ALSWH shows a large increase in BMI across\nsuccessive generations suggesting large increases\nin prevalence of hypertension, as well as significant\nreduction in physical function due to disability\nassociated with obesity and related conditions such\nas diabetes. To illustrate these effects, Figure 2 shows\nthe changes in physical functioning among three\nALSWH cohorts for women with diabetes, and the\nsignificant reduction in their physical function scores.\nAs identified in the World Ageing Report 2015 (Beard\net al., 2015, p.7), public-health policy must be framed\nto enable positive trajectories of ageing. Reducing risk\nfactors for NCD such as hypertension and diabetes\nis critical to ensure optimal functional capacity and\nwell-being for older populations.\nApproaches to management of\nhypertension\nScreening for high blood pressure is universally\nrecommended starting at age 18 years.

Even\nwith the current recommendation alignment issues,\nvery high level evidence exists indicating that treatment\nof hypertension reduces the risk of adverse health\noutcomes(WorldHealthOrganizationandInternational\nSociety of Hypertension Writing Group 2003 (WHO/\nISH 2003)). However, despite clear evidence of the\nprevalence and impact of hypertension, and evidence\nin support of screening and effective treatment, many\nstudies show that hypertension is underdiagnosed\nand poorly treated in many populations around the\nworld. On World Health Day 2013, WHO called for all\nadults around the world to have their blood pressure\nmeasured (World Health Organization 2013). WHO has\nalso provided a number of evidence-based guidelines\non management of patients with hypertension through\nintegrated programmes even in resource-constrained\nsettings (World Health Organization 2007, World Health\nThese guidelines recognise that not all people with\nhigh blood pressure require medications and some\nmay achieve sufficient reduction in blood pressure\nfrom lifestyle changes, including improved diet and\nexercise, and reduced alcohol intake as recommended\nfor all patients with hypertension (WHO/ISH 2003).\nWeight loss and physical activity will also reduce risk\nof diabetes, and cessation of smoking will reduce risk\nof cardiovascular disease. For people who require\nadditional treatment to control blood pressure,\nrecommendations are available for medications.\nMedical management of hypertension does not\nnormally require specialist medical care. A review\nand meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness\nof community interventions for hypertension\nmanagement in China indicated that community-\nbased care for hypertension care is very effective.\nInterventions were provided by primary care workers\n(general practitioners, village doctors, or nurses), and\nincluded education directed toward patients, training\nof care providers, organizational changes, frequent\nmonitoring, patient self-management, and family\nsupport (Lu et al., 2012).

Many\nolder people will have multiple risk factors, multiple\nconditions and functional limitations. Effective\nhealth care therefore requires integration of health\ncare and social services to meet the multiple needs of\nthe older person and their carers, within their social\ncontext. There is a large body of evidence in support\nof integrated care programs to improve the quality\nof care and achieve better patient satisfaction and\nclinical outcomes (Nolte & Pitchforth 2014). This\nperson-centred approach to care typically features\na non-specialist case manager who coordinates care\nwith primary care physicians and specialists (Patel &\nChatterji 2015). This team approach also maximizes\nsystem efficiencies and dovetails with universal health\ncoverage for noncommunicable diseases. While a\nnumber of research gaps remain, sufficient evidence\nexists for policy makers to immediately implement\nblood pressure screening and control across all\nprimary care platforms.\nPolicy development for\nmanagement of hypertension\n\u00ad examples from Ghana and\nASEAN\nFifty-seven percent of older adults in Ghana were\nfound by objective measurement to have high blood\nthe respondents were aware of their condition and\n4% were effectively treated (Lloyd-Sherlock et al.,\n2014). These figures opened the door for negotiations\nwith the Ministry of Health and hypertension was\nidentified as a key priority for multi-sector ageing\npolicy development in Ghana (de Carvalho et al.,\n2015). This problem exists despite the establishment\nof the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda\nof hypertension by local health services (National\nDevelopment Planning Commission, Republic of\nGhana 2010), suggesting other barriers such as low\nlevels of health insurance and poor access to health\ncare may exacerbate the problem of underdiagnosis\nand undertreatment (Bosu 2010). These access\nproblems exist despite the introduction of the Ghana\nNational Health Insurance Scheme in 2006 that should\nreduce financial barriers to treatment, with insurance\ncoverage rates for this age group remaining below 50%\n(World Health Organization 2014a). Having health\ninsurance was positively associated with awareness in\nthree countries, but the strength of this effect varied\nfrom very strong in the Russian Federation to more\nmarginal in Ghana (Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2014). Other\nstudies also suggest that the low insurance coverage\nand poor control of this highly prevalent condition\nmay be at least partly explained by a lack of awareness\nof the nature of chronic disease and the need for long-\nterm treatment that may have no impact on symptoms\n(Addo et al., 2010). The problem of hypertension\nin Ghana is potentially not only a consequence of\nlimited access to services and drugs, but also heavily\ninfluenced by older people's limited understanding\nof the nature of chronic disease, risk factors, and the\nneed for ongoing use of preventive medications. In\nother words, the challenge may be as much related to\ndemand as supply, and any policy response needed to\ntake this into account.\nIn response to these needs, the government of\nGhana determined to increase community awareness\nof the health needs of older adults, integrate ageing\nand health into the community health workers\nprogramme, and improve insurance coverage and\nuptake of services. These recommendations have been\ntaken up in Ghana's Medium Term Health Strategy for\ngaps in access to health services, and to intensify\nprevention and control of NCDs (Ministry of Health,\nMoving from individual countries, to regions and\nthe benefits gained from cross-country comparisons,\nmember countries of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) have initiated a range of\nresponses to NCD management and control. A review\nof these responses found that there is a need to\nre-examine the fundamental nature of health services,\nand to create innovative solutions to considerable\nchallenges, including a lack of skilled staff, scarcity of\nequipment and medicines, and difficulties with access\nto facilities (Lim et al., 2014). Twelve case studies\nillustrate a variety of approaches, including a focus on\nlifestyle changes in Thailand, to enactment of a \"sin\ntax\" in the Philippines. This same review included\na description of a community-based hypertension\nmanagement programme in Viet Nam, which based\nits success on engagement of the whole community,\nsupport from local authorities, strategic utilization of\nmedical expertise, and the commitment of health care\nworkers.

In all cases, a solid research base\nis required as basic minimum input for policy and\nplanning reformation: the ongoing challenge is to\nprovide data that feeds into the policy process. A\npositive example from a high income country is\nprovided by Ireland, where the high prevalence\nof hypertension (64%) and relatively low levels of\nawareness (55%) in Irish adults aged 50 years and\nolder poses a major public health challenge (Murphy et\nal., 2014). The Irish National Positive Ageing Strategy\nwas developed with broad domestic input and\nembedded within the Government's Healthy Ireland\nframework, under the responsibility of the Minister\nof State (Department of Health 2013). This strategy\nwas informed by policy efforts from no less than eight\ncountries as well as their own previous work on policy\ndevelopment (Department of Health 2014). Data\nfrom The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)\nhas been a crucial element to the ongoing policy\ndevelopments and monitoring through the Annual\nPositive Ageing Forum convened by the Department of\nThis illustrates how research can be readily translated\ninto policy, given the political commitment to do so.\nNeed for ongoing monitoring\nand evaluation platforms\nPopulation ageing brings new challenges to health\npolicy and health systems to help people maintain\ntheir health as they age, to improve their quality of life\nand their opportunities to participate in their societies,\nand to reduce burdens on health and welfare systems.\nTheavailability of data to inform the responses to these\nchallenges is of fundamental importance, and this\nreview has provided examples where the availability\npopulation data on hypertension has elevated the\nimportance of this problem and driven changes to\npolicy.

WHO's Study on global AGEing and\nadult health (www.who.int/healthinfo/sage; Kowal et\nal., 2012) is proving to be a valuable tool for research\nand policy in a number of countries, although more\nfunding and a wider range of countries are needed to\nensure more proactive and timely inputs into policy\nand practice. Considerable investment is needed to\nmanage and exploit data now and in the future, so\nthat policy makers informed by an evidence base can\nact proactively to promote well-being in 900 million\nolder adults and counting.\nReferences\nAddo, J., Smeeth, L., Leon, D.A.
