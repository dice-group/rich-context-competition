It is, for example,\nfrequently used in studies on men and masculinities, there\ndefined as a mechanism and social dynamic that explains the\nmaintenance of hegemonic masculinity. A popular use of\nthe concept is found in studies on male friendship, male\nbonding, and fraternity orders. It is also frequently applied to\nexplain how men, through their friendships and intimate col-\nlaborations with other men, maintain and defend the gender\nHowever, this common and somewhat overexploited use of\nthe concept referring to how men, through their relations to\nother men, uphold patriarchy tends to simplify and reduce\nhomosociality to an almost descriptive term that is used to\nshow how men bond, build closed teams, and defend their\nprivileges and positions.\nA more complex, refined and dynamic view on homoso-\nciality is found in Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's (1985) classic\nstudy Between men. Instead of using the concept merely as a\ntool to analyze social bonds and power relations between\nmen, Sedgwick discusses the relation between different types\nof desire and intimate relationships between men.\nTo draw the \"homosocial\" back into the orbit of \"desire,\" of the\npotentially erotic, then, is to hypothesize the potential\nunbrokeness of a continuum between homosocial and\nhomosexual \u00ad a continuum whose visibility, for men, in our\nThrough her analysis of the complex relationship between\nhomosociality, homosexuality, and homophobia, Sedgwick\ndevelops an interesting and useful theory of gender and mas-\nculinity. Her main thesis is that a continuous relation is radi-\ncally disrupted and gradually turned into a discontinuous\nrelation of male homosocial and homosexual bonds, whereas\nthere is a much more continuous relation between female\nhomosocial and homosexual bonds.\nFor instance, the diacritical opposition between the \"homosocial\"\nand the \"homosexual\" seems to be much less thorough and\ndichotomous for women, in our society, than for men.

(Sedgwick,\nThe discontinuity between male homosociality and homo-\nsexuality results in male homosocial relationships being a\nform of \"male bonding\", which is characterized by homoso-\ncial desire and intimacy, as well as homosexual panic.\nHomosocial desire refers to men turning their attention to\nother men, and homosexual panic refers to the fear of this\nattention gliding over into homosexual desire. In an attempt\nto emphasize heterosexuality, fear or hatred of homosexuals\nand misogynist language are developed.\nIn many ways, Sedgwick has set the agenda for studies on\nhomosociality. At least three different types of readings and\ninterpretations of the concept have evolved. First, as pointed\nout above, the concept is often used to analyze how men,\nthrough their relationships and social bonds with other men,\nconstruct power blocs and protect male territory and privi-\nlege. Second, there is a whole body of literature that pursues\nqueer readings of homosociality and explores the underlying\ncontinuum of desires and relations. Finally, there is a grow-\ning body of literature on female homosociality that presents\na somewhat different picture of the phenomenon in question.\nThis literature connects in part to Sedgwick's arguments, but\nthere are also some significant developments, for example,\nthe questioning of Sedgwick's thesis on the asymmetry\nbetween male and female homosociality. There are, obvi-\nously, no absolute boundaries between these three different\napproaches to homosociality, but discussing them separately\nmakes it easier to analyze different aspects of the concept.\nThe purpose of the present article is to investigate,\nexplore, and discuss the concept of homosociality, especially\nmale homosocial relations. Through a reading of contempo-\nrary and significant Anglo-Saxon and European literature, in\nparticular, cultural studies, that use the concept to analyze\ndifferent textual and social phenomena, our ambition is to\nexplore and problematize the use of homosociality in studies\nof gender and masculinity. We will highlight different empir-\nical examples of homosocial relations, in the research and\npopular culture, and will explore different aspects of homo-\nsociality, looking at how these characteristics relate to each\nother and what implications they might have for gender\nissues.\nWe are especially interested in developing and emphasiz-\ning the contradictory and ambivalent aspects of the concept,\npointing both toward a defense of hegemonic masculinity and\ntoward a silent and slow process that might undermine or\nreconstruct this power structure, as it appears today in many\nWestern countries. In our view, the concept of homosociality\nis often defined as a mechanism and social dynamic that\nexplains the maintenance of hegemonic masculinity, situating\ngender relations within a reasonably stable power structure.\nHowever, by relating homosociality to the concept of hege-\nmony deployed by poststructuralist scholars Ernesto Laclau\nand Chantal Mouffe, our aim is to discuss and reconstruct a\nstructuralist and sometimes unproblematized relation between\nhegemonic masculinity and homosociality, thus developing a\nmore dynamic view on homosocial relations.\nHomosociality and Hegemonic\nMasculinity\nWe must recognize, then, a continuum of homoerotic experience\namong working-class men in a number of social settings. At the\nsame time we must acknowledge that this experience is silenced,\nthat the public language of the peer group and the workplace is\nheterosexual. Moreover, it is often seriously homophobic.\n\"Poofters\" are an object of derision, sometimes hatred. (Connell,\nThere is a massive body of literature on the homosocial\nordering of men's relations, and all the different strategies\nmen use to maintain the gender order and uphold male privi-\nMessner, 2001). In this category of research, we have a num-\nber of classic studies, for example, Paul Willis's study\nLearning to Labour (1977) about a group of working-class\nboys (the lads) who, in their informal group, make not behav-\ning well, that is, not behaving according to middle-class ide-\nology, is the honorable thing to do. The lads oppose all\nauthorities related to the middle class, while they respect\nworking-class authorities. As a system of socialization and\nreproduction, the school is dominated by middle-class values\nand the lads put up hard resistance to people who respect this\nideology of conformity and theoretical knowledge, that is,\nthe teachers and the pupils who like doing their homework\n(the ear `oles). This struggle also leads to the construction of\na tight and close male order that excludes and oppresses\nyoung women, immigrants, and other men. Willis' study on\nmen and homosociality has in many ways become iconic and\nvery influential in sociology and educational research.\nAnother example of and angle on these male-to-male rela-\ntions can be found in Michael Flood's (2008) article on how\nbonds between young men also shape their relations with\nwomen and form their sexual attitudes and behavior. In his\ninterviews with young men at a military university, there\nwere many examples of how friendship between men builds\non and involves fantasies and experiences of having sex with\nwomen, as well as sharing memories of collective sexual\nharassments and sexual encounters. Women become a kind\nof currency men use to improve their ranking on the mascu-\nline social scale. According to Flood, homosociality refers\nfirst and foremost to nonsexual and same-sex bonds, involv-\ning quite high degrees of homophobia. However, it is also\npossible to read and understand this externalized homopho-\nbia as a sign of underlying homoerotic desires. Flood (2008)\nconcludes,\nMale-male relations organize and give meaning to the social and\nsexual involvements of young heterosexual men in powerful\nHammar\u00e9n and Johansson 3\nways. Homosocial bonds are policed against the feminizing and\nhomosexualizing influences of excessive heterosociality,\nachieving sex with women is a means to status among men, sex\nwith women is a direct medium of male bonding, and men's\nnarratives of their sexual and gender relations are offered to\nmale audiences in storytelling cultures generated in part by\nAnother much discussed issue in relation to homosocial-\nity is the proposed lack of intimacy in men's friendship rela-\ntions. Homosociality is often seen as being based on and\nformed through competition and exclusion. Recent research\nhas put forward another and more complex image of mascu-\nlinity and friendship. In an article exploring the \"stag night\",\nthe premarital ritual involving a man who is soon to be mar-\nried and his friends celebrating the coming wedding, there is\nevidence for certain changes in men's relationships. Thomas\nThurnell-Read (2012) conducted participant observations\nwith eight separate stag-tour groups. The observations con-\nfirmed a picture of male participants actively working to\nmaintain and develop their friendship bonds. These groups\nof men were striving for group cohesion, togetherness, and\nintimacy, rather than interpersonal competition and the cre-\nation of male hierarchies. Even though this phenomenon can\nbe seen as a part of hegemonic masculinity, there are also\ntraces of changes and redefinitions of masculinity. In con-\ntrast to Willis' study, for example, the focus here is on the\ncreation of a more sensitive and intimate masculinity.\nAlthough there is a growing body of literature that brings\nforward more nuanced images of masculinity, thus stretching\nand extending the concept of homosociality to investigate\npotential changes in or redefinitions of hegemonic masculin-\nbody of work that reproduces the image of homosociality as\na mechanism that supports and reinforces hegemony and\nrather stereotypic images of masculinity (Bird, 1996;\narguing that these authors are unaware of the complexity of\nthe concept, but their findings and conclusions clearly pro-\nmote the notion that homosociality evidently is a part and\nextension of hegemonic masculinity.\nAccording to Connell (1995), hegemonic masculinity\nrefers to \"the configuration of gender practice which embodies\nthe currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy\nof patriarchy\", and which results in the dominant position of\nmen and the subordination of women (p. 77). The concept is\noften used to analyze a historically changing and mobile\npower structure and a hierarchical relation between different\ngroups of men and women. Hegemonic masculinity is con-\nstructed in relation to subordinated and marginalized mascu-\nlinities as well as in relation to femininities. However,\nhegemony does not imply total power and domination but\ninstead is focused on a balance of forces and an ongoing strug-\ngle for power. When historical conditions and social patterns\nin society change, the hegemonic position can also be con-\nfronted and questioned, meaning that hegemony is never\nabsolute or fixed. The concept thus points to possible changes\nin and transformations of masculinity. Yet, Connell uses the\nterm complicity to theorize how men relate to power and to the\nhegemonic structures of masculinity. According to Connell,\nmost men have a complicated, dependant, and ambivalent\nrelation to power. In Connell's definition of hegemonic mas-\nculinity, patriarchy is changing, albeit slowly, but it is still\nquite a stable power structure. The organization of gender on a\nlarger scale is centered on a single fact: \"the global dominance\nThe theory of hegemonic masculinity has had a great\nimpact on gender studies, has become a key concept, and\ncould be interpreted as more dynamic and flexible than, for\nexample, the notion of patriarchy. However, a number of\nscholars have stressed a criticism of the concept (e.g.,\nsome critical problems with the concept of hegemonic mas-\nculinity, especially the lack of a discussion of resistance and\nthe problems of adapting it to analyses of specific and local\nmasculinities. He argues for the study of multiple forms of\nhegemony in the gender order and for a concept that focuses\non stable and changing structures and gender identities. In a\nlithic and unchanging use of the concept, calling for a subtler\nand more usable concept that allows analysis of particular\nforms of masculinity and men and masculinities at different\nlevels of abstraction.\nWhen the concept of hegemonic masculinity is chal-\nlenged, redefined, and expanded, how can we then compre-\nhend, interpret, and conceptualize homosociality in relation\nto the gender order? We will return to this question a number\nof times, especially in the section titled \"Reconstructing\nHegemonic Masculinity and Homosociality\".\nHomosociality and Homoeroticism\nIn November 1994, the metrosexual male was identified and\ndescribed by the cultural critic Mark Simpson (Coad, 2008).\nThis market segment consisted of young, urban, White, mid-\ndle-class men \u00ad consumers and young narcissistic men pre-\noccupied with looks, style, and image. In the 1990s, these\nmen and this phenomenon indicated a crisis in masculinity, a\ncloser relation between homo and hetero men, and a general\nmovement toward a new masculinity. Coad (2008) writes,\nMetrosexual males may look prettier and more beautiful than\ntheir nonmetrosexual brothers, but metrosexuality is the motor\nbehind more decisive changes in the realm of sexual politics; it\ninfluences how heterosexual males interact with homosexual\nmales and it is in the process of replacing traditional categories\nof sexual orientation. (p. 197)\nHowever, the views on and interpretations of this phe-\nnomenon vary. Shugart (2008) argues that metrosexual mas-\nculinity defines and casts homosociality as a kind of universal\n4 SAGE Open\nmale solidarity. Instead of pointing toward a new masculin-\nity, and a more sensitive and inclusive masculinity, metro-\nsexuality reorganized homosociality to define homosexual\nmen as different from women and heterosexual men.\nAccording to Shugart (2008), the main result of this move-\nment is a highly commercialized masculinity and a strength-\nening of normative masculinity.\nTo understand and position the whole discussion of a new\nmasculinity, and the potential erasure of the boundaries\nbetween heterosexuality and homosexuality, we have to\nreturn to Sedgwick. Her definition of homosociality is char-\nacterized by a triangular structure in which men have bonds\nwith other men and women serve as the conduits through\nwhich these bonds are expressed. However, this triangle may\nportray as rivalry what is actually an attraction between men.\nThe argument and the idea that there is an underlying con-\ntinuum between different kinds of male homosocial desires\nopen up a potential arena for research on the fragile boundar-\nies and lines between different masculinities and hetero-/\nhomosexuality. This is apparent, for example, in Eric\nAnderson's study Inclusive Masculinity (2009). Anderson's\nthesis is that we are today witnessing a considerable change\nin masculinity. The lessening of homophobia gradually leads\nto a widening of the range of masculine identities and posi-\ntions that are possible to embody and perform. Anderson\nnurtures an optimistic view on gender and changes in gender\nstructures. However, he is at the same time fully aware that\nthese changes are uneven, and that in many masculine con-\ntexts and milieus, masculinity is still defined as the opposite\nof femininity and homosexuality. However, this said, he is\nobviously describing and putting forward a scenario in which\nmasculinity is becoming gradually more inclusive and per-\nIn a culture of diminished homohysteria, boys and men will be\nfree to express emotional intimacy and physical expressions of\nthat relationship with one another. Accordingly, this culture\npermits an ever greater expansion of acceptable heteromasculine\nbehaviours, which results in a further blurring of masculine and\nfeminine behaviours and terrains. The differences between\nmasculinity and femininity, men and women, gay and straight,\nwill be harder to distinguish, and masculinity will no longer\nserve as the primary method of stratifying men. (Anderson,\nIn his influential study on homosexuality and modernity,\nHenning Bech's (1997) ideas fit into this way of approaching\nhomosociality. He identifies something he calls absent\nhomosexuality. He writes, \"The mode of being of absent\nhomosexuality can only be comprehended in its relation to\nthe other pole in the modern form of male-male eroticism,\ni.e. the homosexuals, in its simultaneous connection to and\nabsent homosexuality as a ghost-like character, present but\nabsent, desired and denied, known and unknown. This idea\nof an absent homosexuality that structures society and men's\nlifestyles and desires has certain similarities with Judith\nButler's idea of melancholia and identity. In The Psychic Life\nof Power, Butler (1997) starts from Freud's theory of melan-\ncholia and uses this description of clinical depression as an\ninspiration for analyzing the construction of a heterosexual\norder. According to Butler, heterosexuality naturalizes itself\nby insisting on the Otherness of homosexuality. Then the het-\nerosexual identity is based and sculptured on a melancholic\nincorporation of the love that it disavows. According to\nButler, the man who \"insists upon the coherence of his het-\nerosexuality will claim that he never loved another man, and\nThe idea of a homoerotic continuum has inspired several\ncultural analyses. What is often found is a blurred boundary\nand distinction between homosociality and homoeroticism.\nThere is a complex and dynamic relation between, for exam-\nple, legitimate culture and underground print culture. Janes\n(2012) studied a leading British educational magazine for\nfold of expressions of homoerotic desire in these magazines.\nJanes argues that it is not surprising to find a homoerotic\nspace in writings produced by men for boys. The interplay\nbetween homophobia and close homosocial and homoerotic\nbonds between men created in fiction, but also, for example,\nin schools and in the military, can be seen as evidence for the\nthesis of a continuum of desires.\nCultural analysis shows how fragile and anxiety-ridden\nthe indistinctness that marks homosociality is and points\ntoward the continuous boundary work being done to uphold\nand defend the heterosexual order (Brady, 2012). Thus, even\nthough we have an underlying stream of homosocial desire,\nthere are also constant attempts to suppress and rein in these\nstreams in the heterosexual and normative order. J. Jack\nHalberstam (2002) describes one such cultural mechanism in\nthe neohomosocial triangles. In these triangles, a new con-\nstellation of one heterosexual man, one overtly gay man in\nthe position as a rival for the woman's affections replaces the\nordinary constellation of two men and a woman.\nBy studying films, such as As Good as it Gets (1997) and\nChasing Amy (1997), Halberstam dissects and analyses how\nthe straight homophobic man enters a learning process and\nlearns how to accept a fully human and more gender-equal\nmodel of manhood. However, this narrative usually ends up\nin a reinforcement of the heterosexual order, although with\nsome new nuances.\nAt the end of As Good, Jack Nicholson gets the girl, the girl's\nson gets better, the girl gets laid, the black guy gets lost, the gay\nman gets his dog back, and that's as good as it gets. It can get\nmuch better. I would contend, but only when we find productive\nways as feminists to theorize minority forms of masculinity.\nAlthough the idea and theory of a continuum of homoso-\ncial desires and erotic expressions have greatly influenced\nthinking in the field of gender and queer analysis, it seems\nHammar\u00e9n and Johansson 5\nthat there is no easy escape from the patriarchal system and\nhegemonic masculinity. The subversive forces point toward\nbreaches and leakages in the gender system, but in the end,\nthere is a strong tendency to subordinate and neutralize resis-\ntance and utopian forms of thinking about gender and\nsexuality.\nFemale Homosociality and the Gender\nConundrum\nThe suggested continuum between female friendship, feminist\nsolidarity, and same-sex desire has great support in the litera-\nture. However, there is also a growing critique of this way of\napproaching female homosociality. Sedgwick put forward a\nthesis on the asymmetry between male and female homoso-\nciality. She argues that male homosociality is first and fore-\nmost fashioned through the exchange of women and the\nconsolidation of men's power in society, whereas for women,\nthis sharp cleavage between homosociality and homosexuality\nis not that distinct, clear, and stable. According to Binhammer\n(2006), this is a somewhat idyllic and perhaps even naive\nimage of women's relationships. She argues that women in\nmany ways circulate in and are permeated by the same capital-\nist economy and system as men are. Women's bonds are not\ncreated outside the dominant sexual economy but as a part of\nit. Women's relations are therefore not by definition and auto-\nmatically a challenge to hegemonic masculinity.\nIn an interesting article, Henriette Gunkel (2009) dis-\ncusses and analyzes the \"mummy-baby\" relationship in the\nSouth African schools. Briefly, this is a culturally specific\nform of female same-sex intimacy, although similar forms\nare found in, for example, British boarding schools. An older\ngirl at the school helps the newcomers, the younger girls, and\nprovides them with emotional support. Sometimes, this rela-\ntion develops into sexual encounters and relationships.\nAlthough this is taking place in a highly policed and homo-\nphobic environment, this particular form of relationship\nseems to exist alongside the sexuality apparatus and to be\naccepted. The point here is that homosociality needs to be\ntheorized and understood in different ways depending on the\nnational and socio-cultural context.\nIn contrast to this study of accepted, but highly policed\nsexual relations between women, Christine Griffin (2000)\nargues that all young women in the West have to deal with the\naccusation of being a lesbian. This accusation also affects all\nwomen, albeit in different ways, and with different effects.\nGriffin calls for research that is open to aspects of female\nfriendship that are colored and permeated by desire, fantasies,\nand a passion for same-sex relationships. This type of friend-\nship is immediately drawn into the naturalized model of com-\npulsory heterosexual relationships and the pressure of \"getting\na man\". According to Hammar\u00e9n (2008), concepts of love\nand intimacy have become feminized. In his study on identity\nconstructions among young men in multicultural suburbs,\nfemale intimate relationships are understood as expressions\nof friendship and heterosexuality. Young women who kiss,\nhold hands with, and hug each other are not considered lesbi-\nans, but rather women involved in normalized feminine het-\nerosexual behavior. Lesbians are therefore made invisible and\nare ignored. According to a heteronormative order and male\ngaze, women's intimate relations are understood as friendship\nor a sexual display aimed at heterosexual men.\nThere is clearly a lack of research exploring female friend-\nships as something other than desexualized relations.\nTherefore, sexual minority women's relations are not\nexplored and researched (Arseneau & Fassinger, 2006).\nThere is also a paucity of literature on friendships between\nBlack and White women, for example (Granger, 2002), or\ncross-racial friendships in general. There is obviously a need\nto study and problematize the idea of a continuous relation\nbetween female homosocial and homosexual bonds and\nfriendships (see, for example, Marcus, 2007). The whole\nidea of a sharp contrast between how this works in a male\nversus a female spectrum of desire and relations would seem\nto be the result of a polarized view on gender and identity\nToward a Theory of Homosociality\nThe three different focuses on homosociality are, of course,\npartly overlapping. In the literature, this concept is mainly\nused as a tool to understand and dissect male friendships and\nmen's collective attempts to uphold and maintain power and\nhegemony. The most common use of the concept is inspired\nby Sedgwick's approach, and the whole discussion and idea\nof a homoerotic continuum. However, most authors also\nstress and focus on the radical disruption of this continuum\nand the consequences of this disruption for homophobia, and\na fragile but power-seeking masculinity. In contrast, female\nhomosociality is described as something completely differ-\nent, and more in terms of a closer relation between sociality\nand sexuality. As we have discussed, this way of framing and\nanalyzing homosociality is in need of reinterpretation.\nWe will now introduce the distinction between vertical/\nhierarchical and horizontal homosociality. Hierarchical\nhomosociality is similar to and has already been described as\na means of strengthening power and of creating close homo-\nsocial bonds to maintain and defend hegemony. Although\nthis description is primarily used to talk about men's friend-\nships and exchange of means and valuable cultural and social\ncapital, it is also possible to frame and investigate women's\nrelations using this concept. However, we will not argue that\nthis concept and the idea of a vertical and hierarchical homo-\nsociality are totally gender neutral. Horizontal homosociality\nis similar to what was earlier described as female homoso-\nciality. This concept is used to point toward relations\nbetween, for example, men \u00ad relations that are based on emo-\ntional closeness, intimacy, and a nonprofitable form of\nfriendship. There are, clearly, no absolute boundaries\nbetween these two approaches to homosociality. Aspects of\n6 SAGE Open\nhierarchical homosociality in horizontal relations and vice\nversa might be present, but making a distinction between\nthem and discussing them separately make it easier to ana-\nlyze different aspects of the concept and highlight different\nimplications.\nBird (1996) argues that homosociality maintains hege-\nmonic masculinity and patriarchy, acting to institutionally\nand interpersonally segregate men and women, and to sup-\npress nonhegemonic masculinities. However, this common\nuse of the concept \u00ad which refers to how men, through their\nrelations to other men, uphold and maintain patriarchy, in\nterms of emotional detachment, competitiveness, homopho-\nbia, and sexual objectification of women \u00ad tends to reduce\nhomosociality exclusively to a heteronormative, androcen-\ntric, and hierarchical term used to show how heterosexual\nmen bond and defend their privileges and positions. Is it not\npossible to discuss, for example, male homosocial relation-\nships in terms of intimacy, gender equality, and nonhomo-\nphobia without disregarding the possible advances of\nmaleness?\nIn popular culture, the concept of bromance (which com-\nbines the words brother and romance) and womance (com-\nbining woman and romance) has been introduced, discussed,\nand debated. Bromance and womance refer to close and inti-\nmate nonsexual and homosocial relationships between two\n(or more) men or women. Womance is similar to the above-\nmentioned concept of female homosociality; bromance,\nhowever, differs from traditional understandings of male\nhomosocial relations and does not necessarily fit within the\nconstruct of masculinity found in some masculinity theories\nfocusing on competition and hierarchies. Bromance empha-\nsizes love, exclusive friendship, and intimacy that are not\npremised on competition and the often described \"shoulder-\nto-shoulder\" friendship, for example, watching football,\nplaying golf, or training for a marathon together. Bromances\nprovide a space for intimate male friendship (Chen, 2012),\neven though studies also show that male friendships might\ninclude utilitarian aspects, desire, rivalry, and self-interest\npointing toward a less idealized picture contrary to bromance\nThe concept is barely discussed by academic scholars but\nreturns regularly in media portrayals in movies, on TV, in\ngossip magazines, and in more or less obscure blogs and\nwebsites. According to, for example, Wikipedia, the free\nencyclopedia (2012), a number of celebrities have engaged\nin close bromances with associated celebrities, for example,\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon, and George Clooney and Brad\nPitt. Fictional bromances on television have also become\nmore commonplace and shows and dramas such as Scrubs,\nBoston Legal, and Boy Meets World have had lead characters\nwith bromantic relationships including long-lasting friend-\nships and love. The same applies to different boy bands such\nas One Direction, or films such as The King's Speech.\nExamples of womances in popular culture seem to be more\nexceptional, although the film Thelma and Louise is\nsometimes said to be one. The terms bromance and womance\nare often used to refer to two heterosexual partners, although\nthere have been celebrity male gay\u00adstraight bromances (also\ncalled homomances or hobromances). We are not suggesting\nthat bromances and womances are similar. The popular con-\ncept of bromance, unlike the concept of womance, is perhaps\na reflection of the different values assigned to male and\nfemale friendships. In addition, while, for example, Thelma\nand Louise is about fighting misogyny and male abuse, many\nbromances are about how men make highly enjoyable friend-\nships and focus on each other. Consequently, there would\nseem to be an underlying power relation between the\nconcepts.\nAccording to Chen (2012), bromances comprise three\ngeneral constitutive elements: They are restricted to men, are\nasexual, and are locations for intimacy, love, and affection\nbetween men. They are also described as a complicated love\nand affection shared by straight males. The \"bro\" aspect of\nbromance may perhaps emphasize heteronormativity, as well\nas homophobia, indicating that it is not gay because it is\nbetween men. The focus on heterosexual men, however,\nseems to differ. Bromances or homosocial relations between\ngay men or between a straight man and a gay man are quite\nrare, but do exist (Nardi, 2001). Bromances imply intimacy\nthat slips between the boundaries of sexual and nonsexual\nrelationships.\nBromances notably provide a space for male intimacy, in sharp\ncontrast to the general types of friendship that society permits\nmen to have. They recognize intimacy without sex, in contrast\nIn one Swedish daily newspaper, we can read about male\nintimacy and bromance (Svenska Dagbladet, 2011). The arti-\ncle discusses men's friendships as still being defined by\nhomophobia and distant relationships; however, these rela-\ntionships are loosening up. Today, we can witness men hav-\ning close and intimate relationships with their friends, not the\nleast as represented in media and films. The article highlights\nthe concept of bromance and how some men's friendships\nare like a kind of love relation \u00ad guys who hang out all the\ntime, talking about everything, and who like to hug each\nother. Bromance is described as a nonsexual love affair\nbetween men, which has been made possible through the\nundermining of a traditional gender order (Svenska\nDagbladet, 2011). These kinds of relations are similar to\nwhat we call horizontal homosociality, also described earlier\nas female homosociality.\nIn constructions of homosocial relations, some differ-\nences between people are marked and some may be obscured.\nFor example, the assertion of gender may overlook sexuali-\nties, age, or local differences. Often, the literature on homo-\nsociality has a quite one-dimensional focus. Theories of the\nintersections between sexuality, class, ethnicity, age, and\ngender are seldom used to elaborate critical perspectives on\nHammar\u00e9n and Johansson 7\nTayler, Hines, & Casey, 2010). These variables influence the\nindividual at the same time and constitute flexible and often\ncomplex processes of belongings and power relations.\nAccording to this view, power relations and social positions\nare by necessity connected to a plurality of categories. An\nintersectional framework acknowledges the multidimension-\nality of societal factors, identities, and power (as opposed to\nfocusing on class or gender individually). It also attempts to\ncapture how social factors influence one another. For exam-\nple, being male, heterosexual, middle class, and of the major-\nity ethnic population can be considered occupying a\nhegemonic position, in contrast to being a female, working-\nclass lesbian. However, these positions are very much con-\ntextual and situated, resulting in complex and, sometimes,\nambiguous social relations. Consequently, an intersectional\napproach involves locating individuals within these dynam-\nics and examining how people become subjected to a plural-\nity of changing variables.\nHomosocial relations are often described in relation to\nmen, heterosexuality, and shared activities, such as games,\nplaying musical instruments, watching movies, sport activi-\nties, and drinking (Messner, 2001). However, relating to the\nabove description of intersectionality, homosociality does\nnot necessarily imply either heterosexuality or homosexual-\nity, and these relations might also entail emotional sharing.\nWhile the concept of homosociality (and bromance) has\noften been applied to relations between straight men, mixed\ngay\u00adstraight or gay\u00adgay nonsexual relationships between\nmen or women could just as well be defined as homosocial\n(Nardi, 2001). Bromances are said to maintain heteronorma-\ntive hierarchies, as only heterosexuals can have a bromance\n(Chen, 2012). This particular boundary reflects the phenom-\nenon of \"straight panic\" in which individuals experience\nanxiety about how others perceive their sexuality and, thus,\nfeel a need to confirm their heterosexuality. However,\nbecause men in bromances are often identified in society as\nheterosexuals, they can have intimate friendships, without\nrisking being misperceived as gay. At the same time, bro-\nmances are a source of subordination, encouraging men to\nstay within rigid boundaries of sexuality norms. Bromances\nare also described as restraining the pool of intimate friends\nmen may have--gay men are excluded, and consequently,\nthe culture reinforces homophobia and subordination of the\nYet, friendships between gay men and the development of\nnetworks and neighborhoods legitimize alternative forms of\nmasculinity, thereby challenging hegemonic masculinities.\nIn his study on the politics of friendship in the gay social\nmovement, Nardi (2001) claims that gay friendships have the\npotential to produce communities, reinforce gay identity, and\neffect socio-political change on a larger scale. The gay com-\nmunity helps members to find meaning and dignity in a soci-\nety that is trying to impose a hegemonic male order. The\nfriendships of gay men serve to create a sense of belonging\nand thus help sustain a sense of \"gay identity\". Obviously,\ngay men do not automatically pose a challenge to male hege-\nmony. They do not necessarily resist notions that, for exam-\nple, men are superior to and should dominate women.\nHowever, they may undermine traditional aspects of hege-\nmonic masculinity in that heteronormativity is questioned\nand homosexuality is made visible (Mills, 2001).\nEven though Chen (2012) characterizes bromances as\nmaintaining heteronormativity, she concludes her article by\nclaiming that bromances are a starting point for deconstruct-\ning homophobia and represent a queering of heterosexual\nmale friendship. Consequently, they open up space for men\nto experience intimacy outside the heterosexual pairings,\nwhich may also lead to a dismantling of compulsory hetero-\nsexuality. Furthermore, and contrary to Chen, situating bro-\nmances in mixed gay\u00adstraight or gay\u00adgay nonsexual\nrelationships might deconstruct homophobia and contest het-\nerosexist norms even more (Rumens, 2011).\nReconstructing Hegemonic Masculinity\nand Homosociality\nAlthough there have been some efforts to transcend and\nredefine the concept of homosociality, pointing toward\npotential changes in and redefinitions of hegemonic mascu-\nhomosociality is often, as previously mentioned, defined as a\nmechanism and social dynamic that explains the mainte-\nnance of hegemonic masculinity (Gilmartin, 2007, Snyder,\n2007). There is a clear and growing body of literature that\nbrings forward more nuanced images of masculinity, thus\nstretching and extending the concept of homosociality to\ninvestigate possible reconstructions of hegemonic masculin-\nresearch, however, promotes the notion that homosociality\nclearly is a part and extension of hegemony, thus serving to\nalways reconstruct and safeguard male interests and power.\nThe growing body of poststructuralist literature on mas-\nculinity and queer theory, which has resulted in theoretical\ndevelopments and a critique of structuralism, has led to a\nquestioning of certain categories, definitions and ways of\napproaching gender, power, and power relations (Whitehead,\n2002). These theoretical redefinitions and descriptions of\ngender and power are perhaps utopian, but they also point to\ncertain changes in contemporary masculinities. In a critical\ninvestigation of the concept of hegemonic masculinity,\n[T]he different positions or relations described entail either\ncontrol, power and domination, or loss of control, powerlessness\nand subordination. The only relation/position that allows us to\nthink beyond this polarized relational drama is complicity.\nHowever, this position does not allow for much resistance or\nchange, because it is first and foremost described as a support\nact for hegemony. (p. 4)\n8 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, Johansson and Ottemo (2013) argue that\nConnell stays firmly within structuralism and that it is diffi-\ncult to discern any differences between theories of patriarchy\nand those of hegemonic masculinity.Although the concept of\nhegemonic masculinity implies a certain flexibility, suggest-\ning that manifestations of hegemonic masculinity can and\nwill change, the theory often ends up within a structuralist\nframework according to which, these manifestations will\nwork to secure patriarchy (Johansson & Ottemo, 2013).\nFrom this point of view, situating homosociality within a\nstructuralist framework of hegemonic masculinity will auto-\nmatically locate homosocial relations within a stable power\nstructure.\nWhitehead (2002) criticizes the concept of hegemonic\nmasculinity along similar lines. He argues that the concept\nupholds an unreservedly structuralist position, marginalizing\nthe subject and acts of resistance that are exercised by, for\nexample, women or men not acting in accordance with nor-\nmative gender ideals. In this view, the individual is lost\nwithin, or subjected to, an ideological apparatus and innate\ndrive for power.\nAlthough offering a more nuanced interpretation of male\ndominance than patriarchy, hegemonic masculinity ultimately\nsuffers from the same deficits, for it posits an intentionality\nbehind heterosexual men's practices (a \"will to power\" if you\nlike) while suggesting that women and gay men are somehow\nexcluded from this otherwise innate desire to dominate and\nThe fact that the concept of hegemonic masculinity has\nhad a great impact on gender studies, and has become a key\nconcept in studies on masculinities, has obviously influenced\nhow we comprehend issues such as resistance, agency, and\nsubjectivity, and hence, how we understand and interpret gen-\nder relations, constructions of masculinities, certain catego-\nries, and definitions.According toWhitehead (2002), theorists\nusing this concept are excused from having to engage in any\ndeep analysis of the actual practices of men, taking it as a\ngiven that these practices always are representations of domi-\nnant patterns of masculinity. Consequently, the concept of\nhegemonic masculinity is a useful descriptor of dominant\nmasculinities, but its overuse results in the conflation of fluid\nmasculinities with an overarching structure. In an attempt to\nresolve the inconsistency between a deterministic model of\n(male) power and the multiplicity of masculinity that widens\nthe range of masculine positions that can be embodied and\nperformed (as exemplified by certain forms of homosocial\nrelations), Whitehead calls for hegemonic masculinity to use\nan understanding of the social as a contested arena. Instead of\nleaving room for ambiguity, Whitehead claims that the con-\ncept of hegemonic masculinity is often used as a \"blanket\nTo achieve this ambiguity, without leaving us with a the-\nory free from power relations, we will turn to Ernesto Laclau\nand Chantal Mouffe's notion of hegemony. Using their defi-\nnition, we believe that it is possible to develop a dynamic\nunderstanding of the relation between hegemonic masculin-\nity and homosociality, detaching the discussion from its\nstructuralist legacy.According to Laclau and Mouffe (Laclau,\nare a symptom of the always displaced nature of society, con-\ntingency, and the gaps different groups try to cover. Any ulti-\nmately fixed meaning or completely centered structures are\nimpossible, and we are instead offered partial fixations and\nattempts at transcending difference and constructing a center.\nHence, the subject \u00ad constructed in relation to the open char-\nacter of every discourse \u00ad can never be totally fixed and sta-\nble, but is changeable and transitional. Subjectivity and\nagency should be understood as being rooted neither in\nsomething external to the structure nor in something com-\npletely internal to it, instead the structure itself is undecid-\nable and nonrepetitive.\nLaclau and Mouffe offer us a more open field of dis-\ncourses and language games, leading to a dynamic view on\nhegemonic articulations and struggles. Hegemony is never\nfully accomplished but is in motion, and because it is onto-\nlogically conditioned by an omnipresent contingency, we\nwill never be able to go \"beyond hegemony\". Yet, Laclau and\nMouffe do not suggest that we will never be \"free\" in a dys-\ntopian sense, rather, this can be interpreted as a call to strug-\ngle against repressive structures \u00ad to redefine and rearticulate\nthe current hegemony and construct a more desirable (tem-\nporary) hegemonic order. Consequently, hegemony is some-\nthing to struggle for; the main question is in what ways we\nshould hegemonize the social. Relating this post-Marxian\nconcept of hegemony to hegemonic masculinity would allow\nus to analyze potential transitions and changes, for example,\narticulations of potentially radical strategies for changing the\ngender order. Social change is not primarily based on destroy-\ning a certain order but instead, on redefining this order.\nAlthough the ambition of the concept of hegemonic mas-\nculinity has been to create a flexible tool for investigating a\nmobile power structure, discussions on hegemonic masculin-\nity as well as on homosociality often end up in an analysis\nthat solely fixates and upholds the contemporary and oppres-\nsive gender order. Using a poststructuralist approach to hege-\nmony, we are not suggesting that we would replace these\nkinds of analyses with naive and optimistic conceptualiza-\ntions of society. Instead, if we accept that the social is open\nfor redefinitions and transitions, leading to the possibility of\ndifferent subject positions, a poststructuralist approach could\nhelp us to analyze how potential hegemonic rearticulations\nnot only lead to the reinforcement of a given gender order but\nalso to the formation of a possibly redefined and perhaps\nmore \"desirable\" order.\nChanges in masculinity, for example, the construction of\nhorizontal homosociality, in which emotional closeness, inti-\nmacy, and a nonprofitable form of friendship are developed,\nare not necessarily a sign of a strengthening of patriarchy as\nHammar\u00e9n and Johansson 9\nmany discussions on hegemonic masculinity suggest. The\nsame applies to bromances, which description sometimes\ndiffer from traditional understandings of male homosocial\nrelations and do not always fit within the construct of mascu-\nlinity found in some masculinity theories focusing on com-\npetition and hierarchies. In accordance with a poststructuralist\nreading, our proposal is that we not predetermine the agents\nof change and instead, remain open to the possibility of dis-\ncovering potential movements toward a redefined hegemony\nthat contains the seeds of utopian visions of the gender order\nsuggests that it is not necessary to offer a general descriptor\nof hegemonic masculinity but instead, posits that a hege-\nmonic form of masculinity is the form that is the most desired\nin a particular context. Consequently, different contexts can\ninhabit different hegemonic ideals.\nWe believe that it is important for gender research to\ndevelop a theoretical model that emphasizes the dynamic\nqualities of Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity. By\nexploring different masculine positions and carefully investi-\ngating contradictory aspects of hegemonic masculinity, it is\npossible to discern different patterns of power in everyday\nlife \u00ad for example, feminist movements and alternative mas-\nculinities \u00ad and possibilities for subverting gender. At the\nsame time, it is obviously important to discover new forms of\nnostalgic and conservative masculinities that are struggling\nto protect men's privileges and power positions in society.\nWe are not suggesting that, for example, metrosexuality or\nbromances aren't shifts in acceptable forms of masculine\nperformances. The idea that male friendships defined by\nhomophobia and distance seems to loosen up, resulting in\nclose and intimate friendship relations, can still be inter-\npreted in an accepted but still reformulated framework of\nhegemonic masculinity, although perhaps a more desirable\none. It does not follow from Laclau and Mouffe (Mouffe,\n2005), and their suggestion that there is no \"beyond hege-\nmony\", that there is no \"beyond patriarchy\" and that mascu-\nlinity will always be hegemonic in relation to femininity.\nConsequently, for a rearticulation of hegemony to be desir-\nable, we obviously have to break with Connell's notion that\nhegemonic masculinity is always defined as being opposed\nto and privileged over femininity (Connell & Messerschmidt,\n2005). We also have to question the notion that all hegemo-\nnies are equally bad and try to discern whether different\nhegemonies are specific to different forms of masculinity.\nPart of such a struggle could involve articulating elements\nhistorically related to women and men as well. And this is\nperhaps what happens when male performances and friend-\nships might be associated with intimacy, love, and affection\n(Johansson & Klinth, 2008). However, articulating intimacy\nand emotional closeness to men may not lead to a complete\ndisruption of masculinity but perhaps to a potential recon-\nfiguration of hegemonic masculinity that is not a priori and\nnecessarily privileged in relation to femininity.\nConclusion\nAlthough the concept of homosociality may uphold and\nmaintain homogeneous gender categorizations, focusing on\nsingle-sex groups and often referring to hierarchical gender\nrelations in which men strengthen certain hegemonic gen-\nder ideals, applying a poststructuralist understanding of the\nconcept helps us to problematize a common structuralist\nunderstanding of the relation between hegemonic mascu-\nlinity and homosociality. Moreover, by making a distinc-\ntion between the vertical and horizontal practice of\nhomosociality, we can develop a more dynamic view on\nhomosociality. Taking a vertical/horizontal view on homo-\nsociality emphasizes its relation to a structuralist hege-\nmonic gender order, that is, to what degree homosocial\nrelations uphold and maintain \"traditional\" hegemonic\nmale and female social positions. A poststructuralist read-\ning of hegemony makes it possible to interpret potential\nrearticulations of hegemony as part of the struggle for gen-\nder equality and a more just society. Perhaps the develop-\nment and conceptualization of bromances and horizontal\nhomosociality point toward variation and transition and,\nconsequently, to a reconfiguration of hegemony, including\ntendencies toward an eventual transformation of intimacy,\ngender, and power relations. However, we acknowledge\nthat we are only touching on potential and partial redefini-\ntions of hegemony, also those often closely connected to\nthe middle class, and, thus, we need to analyze the gender\norder more thoroughly by taking an intersectional approach\nto examining how these performances may affect more\ngeneral gender relations in society.\nIn addition, there is a clear need to study and problematize\nthe idea of a continuous relation between female homosocial\nand homosexual bonds and friendships. The whole idea of\nthere being a sharp contrast between how this works in a\nmale versus a female spectrum of desire and relations seems\nto be the result of a polarized view on gender and identity,\nnot the least related to the notion that hegemonic masculinity\nis defined as opposed to and privileged over femininity. It is\nlikely that the more polarized the gender order and the more\nheteronormative the sexual codes are the more traditional\nforms of homosociality one expects to find in society. As this\norder slowly changes and loosens up, thus rearticulating\nhegemony, homosociality may take other forms, and friend-\nships may relate not only to same-sex relations but also to\nheterosocial forms of friendship and intimate nonsexual rela-\nsocietal policing of gender and sexual orientation, men\nwould be able to have friendships with other men regardless\nof sexual orientation (Chen, 2012). Sexual orientation would\nnot be the basic principle for friendship. Rigid boundaries\nbetween friendships and romantic relationships would not be\nnecessary, and the potential for fluidity in relationships\nwould increase.\nMen would not need to categorize people in terms of \"friend\" or\n\"potential lover,\" but would instead have a singular category of\nrelationship in which they could both provide and receive\nintimacy and care. This proposition would also undermine\nsexual fluidity as a woman-specific construct, and permit men to\nexperience more fluidity in both relationship forms and sexual\nAdding age/generation to this analysis, some Swedish\nstudies have shown that recent generations of men raised by\nfeminist mothers and fathers in the 1970s and afterward are\nmore emotionally open and more expressive (Johansson,\n2007). There is also less concern among contemporary young\nmen about the notion of being identified as gay, and, thus,\nthey are more comfortable with exploring deeper friendships\nwith other men (Johansson, 2007). Finally, relating to Chen\nand her vision presented above, situating homosociality in an\nintersectional framework develops, emphasizes, and makes\nvisible the inconsistent and ambiguous aspects of homoso-\nciality, focusing not only, as in the case of Chen, on straight\nmen but also on women and different sexual positions and\ngenerations. Using this approach further allows us to point\ntoward a defense of a structuralist framing of hegemonic\nmasculinity by referring to vertical/hierarchical homosocial-\nity and toward a potential and slow process of rearticulating\nhegemony by referring to horizontal homosociality.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, E.
