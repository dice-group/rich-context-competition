The aim of\nthis study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from\nthe WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each\nprofile.\nPrincipal Findings: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using\nWorld Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to\ncalculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four\ncountry economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low\nincome economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust;\nII. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic\narea as a means to put the health results into perspective.\nConclusions: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components\nwhich can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of\nhealth and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a\nuseable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can\nbe targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for\nhealth care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-\nmaking and resource allocations.\nCitation: Andreotti A, Minicuci N, Kowal P, Chatterji S (2009) Multidimensional Profiles of Health Status: An Application of the Grade of Membership Model to the\nEditor: Beverley J.

Taking this perspective, one moves beyond disease absence as\ndefining health status to one that incorporates the complex\nperceptions about health and health conditions. Measuring the\nmultidimensional character of perceived health status, and then\nusing the results meaningfully, remains a challenge for policy and\nresearch purposes. Many of the available analytical techniques used\nto reduce variables, make assumptions about distributions or use\nsummary variables in the calculations. The alternative technique,\nGrade of Membership (GoM) model, is presented in this paper.\nGoM is a non-parametric method that identifies latent health\nprofiles and the degree to which an individual fits these profiles.\nThe GoM method has been applied in previous studies for\ndepressive symptoms and personality disorders [2,3,4], older adult\nmethod that helps to define and predict transitions from robust\nhealth to frailty or the reverse, as well as identify pre-disability\nstates would be helpful in planning for an ageing population\nThe WHO's World Health Survey (WHS) gather data to\nquantify population health status in 70 countries based on WHO's\ndefinition of health. The main aim of this study was to summarize,\nusing the Grade of Membership model, the full set of health and\nhealth-related variables included in the WHS into a smaller set of\nmeaningful health profiles [16]. In order to make these derived\nhealth profiles useful in helping to inform health policy, WHS data\nhave been grouped in four economic areas according to the World\nBank economic categories [17].\nThis paper is organized into three sections. First, a description\nof the data set is provided, which includes details of the survey\ndesign, socio-demographic characteristics of the sample and health\ndata. Then the GoM procedure and results of the GoM analysis\nare described for each economic category. The final section\nsummarizes the results.\nMaterials and Methods\nData\ncountries to establish levels of health and to develop methods to\nimprove data comparability within and across countries [18,19].\nThe principal aim of the WHS was to provide valid, reliable and\ncomparable information about population health status. It used a\ncommon survey instrument in nationally representative popula-\ntions for assessing, amongst other issues, the health of individuals\nin eight of the 22 explicit health domains, health system\nresponsiveness and household health care expenditures.\nA probability sampling design was employed in each country\nusing multi-stage, stratified, random cluster samples. The\npopulation included all selected persons aged 18 years and older\nwho lived in selected households. Most of the countries had\nnationally representative survey samples and each country decided\nwhich interview method to use: face-to-face interview, computer-\nassisted telephone interview (CATI) and/or computer-assisted\npersonal interview (CAPI).\nThe WHS utilized two types of questionnaires: the Household\nQuestionnaire (to describe the health, economic physical character-\nistics at the household level) and the Individual questionnaire (to\ndescribe the individual health status and well-being characteris-\ntics). In order to construct the final dataset, data was extracted\nfrom the WHS Individual Questionnaire. The overall dataset was\nthen divided into four economic areas for the analyses based on\nthe World Bank categories: high income, upper middle income,\nlower middle income and low income (Table 1).\nThe World Bank's uses gross national income (GNI) per capita\nas its main criterion for classifying economies. Based on its 2006\nGNI per capita, every country's economy was classified as low\nincome, middle income (subdivided into lower middle and upper\nmiddle), or high income. The four groups are defined as: low\nmore.\nPhysical and mental health\nThe dataset included self-reported diagnosis of three physical\nand one mental health condition (arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma\nand depression), self-reported difficulties in functioning in eight\nhealth domains (mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cogni-\ntion, interpersonal relationships, vision, sleep and energy, and\naffect) plus one self-reported overall health question. Presence or\nabsence of a diagnosed condition was based on self-report.\nGrade of Membership method\nGrade of Membership (GoM) model [20] is a flexible, non-\nparametric, multivariate method, designed to identify health\nprofiles. In our work we used the self-reported health state and\nhealth conditions in order to determine the latent profiles (pure\nTable 1.

The\nstudy population consists of I individuals with J categorical\nvariables, where the jth variable has Lj\nresponse levels. Each Lj\nresponse is encoded as a binary variable xijl\n, so that if xijl\nthe ith individual has the lth response to the jth variable. A first\ncoefficient, lkjl\n, concerns the likelihood of a response l to the jth\nquestion by an individual belonging to the kth health pure type;\nthe second entity, gik\n, represents weights quantifying the grade of\nsimilarity of the health features of the ith individual with the\ncharacteristics of each K pure types, with the following constraints:\nX\nlkjl\nX\nk\ngik\nBy summing over all potential GoM health pure types:\nP xijl\n~\nX\nk\ngiklkjl\nwe obtain the probability that the ith individual responds l to\nquestion j.\nAssuming independence of individual observations, the likeli-\nhood function for the GoM model is:\nL~ P\ni\nP\nj\nP\nl\nX\nk\ngik\nlkjl\n!\nxijl\n,\nsubject to: 0#gik\nX\nk\ngik\nX\nlkjl\nWe used the DSIGoM software [21] to estimate the GoM\nparameters. In particular the modified Newton-Raphson algo-\nrithm was employed, where the coefficients gik\nand lkjl\nare\nestimated simultaneously to maximize the likelihood function L.\nThe parameters are estimated iteratively: the L function is\nmaximized first with lkjl\nfixed, producing an initial estimate of\nall gik\n; then using the obtained gik\nthe L function is maximized to\nupdate the lkjl\n, This process is repeated until convergence, where\nthe parameters are such that within-group homogeneity is\nmaximized and between-group homogeneity is minimized [20].\nThe optimal number of profiles is established by performing a\nlikelihood ratio test on the change in explanatory power between K\nand K+1 model. This ratio is x2 distributed, with degrees of\nfreedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters to be\nestimated between models [10].\nGrade of Membership application\nPrior to analyzing data, it was necessary to define the external\nand the internal variables [10]. External variables do not affect the\ndefinitions of the pure types and included five socio-demographic\nvariables (age, sex, marital status, education and employment);\nhowever, the association between the pure types and the external\nvariables provides valuable information about the relationship\nbetween empirically-derived pure types and demographic charac-\nteristics. Turkey was not included in the dataset because the\nexternal variable marital status was not available.\nThe continuous age variable was recoded into three categories:\n(60 years and older). Marital status was recoded into four\ncategories: never married, currently married/cohabiting, separat-\ned/divorced and widowed. Sex, education levels (highest level\ncompleted) and sector of current employment (governmental, non-\ngovernmental, self-employed, employer, homemaker, unem-\nployed, student, retired and other) were the remaining external\nvariables.\nInternal variables included self-reported overall health (based on\na five point scale: very good, good, moderate, bad or very bad),\nscores from the eight health domains (none, mild, moderate,\nsevere or extreme/cannot do), and the set of four reported\nconditions (yes, no).\nFor each of the four country categories, the GoM analysis was\napplied with 2, 3 and 4 pure types to test for the optimal number\nof pure types. The GoM parameters estimation was derived using\nthe DSIGoM software. Log likelihood ratio test indicated that\nthree pure types provided the best description of the structure of\nthe variables included in this analysis for each economic area.\nEach pure type was described by the values obtained for the l\ncoefficients. In general, lkjl\n.0.50 was considered to be character-\nistic of a pure type being endorsed by more than 50% of\nindividuals in that pure type. The lambda coefficients were\nproduced for each of the external and internal variables.\nAdditionally, the distribution of respondents' GoM scores (gik\n)\nwas generated for each pure type and country category. The crude\nprevalence estimates refer to the sum of individual membership in\nthe kth pure type, divided by the total number of respondents,\nPrevalence~\nN\n:\nX\nN\ngik\n,\nwhere N is the total number of respondents, and gik\nis the GoM\ncoefficient for the ith individual's degree of membership in the kth\npure type [4].\nIn order to compare the prevalence rates across the four groups,\nage-standardized prevalence estimates were calculated. For each\npure type and economic category, age-specific (younger adult 18\u00ad\ncomputed. To calculate adjusted age-specific prevalence rates we\nused the direct standardization method with the WHO world\nstandard population table [22].\nResults\nSocio-demographic characteristics\ncountries. These countries were grouped into the four World Bank\nincome categories for analysis. The socio-demographic character-\nistics of the respondents are provided in Table 2.\nThree country categories (high, upper-middle and lower-middle\nincome) had more women than the other group (low income),\nalthough the subdivision between males and females is almost\nsymmetric for every region. More young respondents (aged 20\u00ad29\nyears) were noted in the upper-middle, lower-middle and low\nincome categories. The higher income categories had more old\nrespondents than the other groups. The low income category had\na higher percentage (8.1%) of the youngest respondents (aged 18\u00ad\n19 years), while the high income category had the highest\npercentage of older adults with 14.2% of individuals aged 70+\nyears. Respondents in the low income category were more likely to\nbe currently married (70%) and had the highest levels of\nrespondents with no formal education (40.1%). The high income\ncategory had the highest education rate. Current employment\nsector/issues differed by category: the two highest income\ncategories (high and upper-middle income) had more respondents\nemployed in the private sector (39.9% and 23.6% respectively).\nThe lower-middle income category had more homemakers and\nself-employed (20.8% and 19.5%) while low income countries had\nGoM Profiles of Health Status\nhigher levels of self-employed (45.8%). The category with the most\nretired respondents was the high income (13.8%). An association\nbetween all socio-demographic characteristics and the four\nPhysical and mental health data\nThe internal variables in the GoM analysis included self-\nreported physical and mental health data. Descriptive statistics of\nthese variables for the four economic categories were provided in\nThe majority of the respondents reported good or very good\nhealth status for the self-reported overall general health question,\nwith the lower-middle income category having the highest\npercentage of respondents reporting a bad or very bad health\nstatus. In all the eight health domains (mobility, self-care, pain and\ndiscomfort, cognition, interpersonal relationships, vision, sleep and\nenergy, and affect), the prevalence rates followed a positive trend.\nThe majority of the respondents (more than 50%) reported no\ndifficulties on any of the physical or mental health issues, with the\nexception of the domain ``pain and discomfort'', where prevalence\nrates ranged from 44.6% of lower-middle income category to\n52.1% of high income group. Finally, over 85% of respondents\nreported no diagnosed health conditions (arthritis, angina pectoris,\nasthma and depression). Among these conditions, it was noted that\nTable 2.

The components of pure types I (ROBUST)\nand II (INTERMEDIATE) are very similar across all the\ncategories. Moving from type I to type II resulted in increasing\ndifficulty in some health domains, with respondents more likely\nreporting ``moderate difficulty'' (INTERMEDIATE) instead of\n``no difficulty'' (ROBUST) for the given health domain. The third\nhealth profile, FRAIL, was again a distinctly lower level of health\nbased on difficulties with the health domains and presence of one\nor more of the health conditions.\nSimilarly, the lambda probability variables for each of the\nexternal variables by country category show discernable patterns\nfor each of the health profiles (Table 5).\nHigh income economies\nTable 6 shows the distribution of individual GoM coefficients\n(gik\n) for the 26,358 high income respondents.

The GoM model provided a\nmeaningful method to reduce and summarize health variables\nfrom health surveys.\nA number of techniques have previously been applied to WHS\ndata to summarize and report on health status [18]. Comparing\nhealth results using Ustun's method to the GoM results indicated\ngood face validity, with similar response patterns. Establishing\ncomparable levels of health for different populations is extremely\nuseful, but in addition to this, GoM provides a discrete set of\nprofiles which are possibly easier to interpret and use for decision-\nmaking. The three health profiles for higher to lower income\ncountries are digestible and realistic groupings of functioning and\nwell-being. If universal health coverage were to be rolled out or\nexpanded for the older population in a country, a policy maker\nmight choose a stepped strategy starting with characteristics\ncommon in the frail profile. For example, this might include\nimproving identification and treatments for selected comorbidities\nlike depression and arthritis, along with items that have potential\nto improve functioning (like addressing pain or sleep problems) to\nallow for ageing (well) in place.\nThe GoM procedure differs from other classification methods,\nlike Factor Analysis, which use indicators to calculate latent\ncontinuous variables that represent one-dimensional constructs.\nFactor Analysis results derive the parameter values from normally\ndistributed data, whereas, the GoM model is a non-parametric\nmethod where identification of parameters does not rely on any\ndistributional assumptions. Estimation of factor scores in Factor\nAnalysis supports on distributional assumptions relating to the\nfactor loadings [7]. GoM parameters are estimated in an iterative\nmethod: firstly, the likelihood function is maximized with lkjl\nfixed,\ngiving a first estimate of all gik\n, then, fixing gik\n, the likelihood is\nmaximized to update the lkjl\n, which is repeated until convergence.\nGrade of Membership modelling shares similarities with other\ndata reduction methods, such as Factor Analysis, Principal\nComponent Analysis and Cluster Analysis. However, in the\nGoM model, all parameters are simultaneously identified, while,\nindividual parameters in Factor Analysis and Principal Compo-\nnents methods are usually calculated using summary variables\nderived from within the dataset [7].\nTable 12.

Unlike other classification\nmethodologies (such as Cluster Analysis), GoM does not generate\ngroups of similar entities but considers individual heterogeneity\n[7]. GoM was, therefore, well suited for the planned analysis.\nGrade of Membership analysis has been previously used to\nsummarize health data from surveys for depressive symptoms and\npersonality disorders, older people health status and genetic studies\nof health. Woodbury et al. [11] employed GoM analysis in a\nclinical setting to determine if the DSM-III-R personality disorder\ndiagnostic criteria cluster into recognizable disorders. Four pure\ntypes provided the most satisfactory solution to the data. Portrait et\nal. [7] analyzed Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam data and\nidentified six profiles to characterize health. Finally, Manton et al.\n[10] identified five profiles within the 1999 National Long Term\nCare Survey data, a national longitudinal survey based upon a list\nsample of US Medicare enrollers aged 65 years and above, which\nwas used to demonstrate the compression of morbidity in the\nUnited States.\nIn this study, the GOM model produced three pure types\n(health profiles) for each economic category. Each health profile\ndescribed unique facets of physical and mental health (internal\nGoM model variables) plus differences in socio-demographic\ncharacteristics (external GoM model variables) with a clear\neconomic gradient (lower education and employment sector)\nwhen moving from high to low economic categories within each\nprofile. Type I (ROBUST) and Type II (INTERMEDIATE)\nhealth profiles were more similar in both external and internal\nvariables, as well as World Bank economic category, when\ncompared to the Type III (FRAIL) profile.\nN The robust profile respondents reported good health, none of\nthe four health conditions and no difficulties with any of the\nphysical and mental issues comprising the eight health\ndomains.\nN The intermediate profile respondents reported good or moderate\nhealth with increasing difficulties with some health domains\nbut no reported health conditions.\nN The frail profile clearly differed by external variables (older,\nmore widowed, more retired or homemakers), internal\nvariables (more difficulties with more of the eight health\ndomains plus more likely to have a diagnosis of at least one of\nthe health conditions) and economic category (the two lower\neconomic categories had significantly higher rates of member-\nship in the frail profile).\nAll four economic categories had somewhat similar robust and\nintermediate health profiles (pure types I and II). The two higher\neconomic categories had more respondents in the robust pure type\n(greater than 64%) than the lower economic categories (less than\n59%). Likewise, the two lower economic categories had more\nrespectively), with similar rates of membership in the intermediate\nprofile across all four economic categories. The frail profile types\nmay provide a logical focus for attention at all levels of country\nwealth, with policies targeted, for example, at older widowed\nwomen with mobility, sleep and cognition problems.\nThese analyses have provided a robust method to better\nunderstand health status and the components which can help to\nidentify healthy and non-healthy individuals. Three profiles, robust,\nintermediate and frail, were obtained for respondents in each of the\nfour economic categories. These profiles have described concrete\nFreq (%) I II III\nPain and discomfort\nDifficulty in concentration\nDifficulty in personal relationships\nDifficulty in seeing and recognizing persons\nSleeping disorders\nFeeling sad or depressed\nDiagnosis of Arthritis\nDiagnosis of Angina Pectoris\nDiagnosis of Asthma\nDiagnosis of Depression\nGoM Profiles of Health Status\nlevels of health as well as clearly delineating characteristics of\nhealthy and non-healthy respondents. Areas for specific consider-\nation include difficulties with sleep, mobility and depression,\nlargely regardless of presence of specific health conditions or\ncountry of residence. The GoM results provided both a useable\nsummary health measure and a selection of intermediate\ndeterminants which can be targeted for interventions to improve\nhealth. With limited health budgets, these results can help to make\ndecisions about where health gains can be achieved. GoM would\nhelp to define specific characteristics within groups of individuals\nthat can be targeted by health promotion efforts. As an example,\nspecific health policy targets could address unmet need in a sub-\npopulation that encompass components of the frail profile. This\ncould include a public health education campaign for health care\nprofessionals to look more closely at older married women\nreporting moderate health and problems with pain, sleep. It's\nmore likely that they would also have comorbidities, such as\narthritis and depression, to treat and may be undertreated.\nTreatment of these types of individuals could be part of a more\ncomprehensive package to address well-being at older ages.\nIn future, we plan to investigate the transitions between health\nprofiles, both improving and declining health, as well as the impact\nof the health-wealth relationship on shifts between profiles. We will\nadditionally, look at the use of frailty definitions and profiles across\ndifferent settings and the impact on disability assessments. These\nwill provide the basis to inform policy about aging populations and\nmeasures to redress the determinants of more vulnerable health\nprofiles. With a view to make results more cross-nationally\ncomparable, vignette adjustments would improve ability to\ndifferentiate and correct for any reporting bias across countries\nand categories. This adjustment would also likely show more\ndramatic differences in health for respondents in lower income\ncountries.\n"
