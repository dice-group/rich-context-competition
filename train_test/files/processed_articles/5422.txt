The assur-\nance and steady development of quality of care is a nation-\nwide aim of national funded and voluntary initiatives in many\ncountries and health care systems around the world.2-5 For\nseveral years, these efforts have been complemented by vari-\nous research activities in the fields of health services and\nimplementation research.6 With regard to high-quality care,\ngreat importance was ascribed to clinical guidelines (CGs).7\nCGs provide a widespread and well-established method to\ndisseminate systematic and structured recommendations for\npatient care.8 The recipients of the recommendations com-\nprise outpatient, inpatient, and rehabilitative care and there-\nfore a large proportion of medical care providers. The\nrecommendations are based on the best available evidence at\nthe time of creation. The responsibility for and applied meth-\nods of CG development differ internationally. Germany and\nthe United Kingdom constitute 2 examples for the develop-\nment of CGs. The classification of German CGs is divided\naccording to the approach to their development and contains\n3 grades: S1, S2 (separated in S2e [evidence] or S2k [consen-\nsus]), and S3 (systematic evidence synthesis and consecutive\nstructured consensus).9 The development of CGs is carried\nout through voluntary initiatives of medical societies or in\nfunded structured CG programs (Disease Management\n1Centre for Evidence-based Healthcare, Technical University Dresden,\nGermany\n2MRC North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research, Institute of\nTranslational Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJochen Schmitt, Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare, University\nHospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Technical University Dresden,\nEmail: Jochen.Schmitt@mdk-sachsen.de\nGuidelines and German Guideline Program in Oncology).\nBoth are hosted by the Association of the Scientific Medical\nSocieties in Germany (AWMF). In the United Kingdom, CGs\nare developed and disseminated in 3 different frameworks\nthrough the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n(NICE) for England and Wales, the Scottish Intercollegiate\nGuidelines Network (SIGN) for Scotland, and the Guidelines\nand Audit Implementation Network (GAIN) for Northern\nIreland. We only include CGs of NICE because of their wide-\nspread dissemination. NICE was established in 1999 by the\ngovernment to \"reduce variation in the availability and qual-\nity of National Health Service treatments and care.\"10\nDifferent approaches and tools are used in routine prac-\ntice to measure the quality of medical care. Quality indica-\ntors are most commonly used to determine the quality of\ncare.11,12 Defined reference intervals distinguish between dif-\nferent levels of health care quality. Data to define reference\nintervals may be derived from the literature, expert opinions,\nor statistical specifications.13 Quality indicators are instru-\nments to measure structural, processual, and outcome quality\nin routine care.14 They are thus measurement instruments\nthat can be expressed as definitions, single-item instruments,\nor multi-item instruments. They must meet specific require-\nments, such as clear definitions, rationale for use, and a\ntransparent definition process to achieve conclusive results.\nFor process and outcome quality indicators that are measured\nby measurement instruments, those requirements include cri-\nteria of methodology and feasibility.15 Methodological crite-\nria are clinimetric properties, that is, content validity,\nconstruct validity, internal consistency, interobserver reli-\nability, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to change/\nresponsiveness.16,17 Feasibility/acceptability criteria include\nthe level of implementation of procedures or the sustainabil-\nity of treatment recommendations for the quality of care.15\nThe rigorous and transparent development of meaningful\nquality indicators with high validity, reliability, and feasibility is a\nprerequisite for an evidence-driven development of health care\nsystems toward medical care that is safer, more effective, and\nmore efficient.18,19 Ideally, processual and outcome quality indi-\ncators for the same medical problem should be comparable across\nhealthcaresystemstoallowinternationalcomparisonsasanaddi-\ntional source of evidence for health care system research and\ndevelopment. Quality indicators for structural quality can differ\naccording to the economic or health care system environment.\nThe aims of the present study were (1) the systematic analysis and\ncomparison of the methodological approaches in the develop-\nment of quality indicator recommendations relevant to CGs in\nGermany and NICE and (2) the critical appraisal of the content,\nvalidity, and reliability of CG-recommended quality indicators\nbetween the 2 countries with a specific focus on quality indicators\nfrom pairs of guidelines on the same medical problem.\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review on all German S3 guide-\n(effective April 1, 2014). The relevant literature was inde-\npendently searched and assessed by 2 reviewers, and relevant\ninformation concerning quality indicators was extracted in a\nstandardized manner. We analyzed the publicly available CG\ndatabases of the AWMF and NICE. Following an a priori\ndefined protocol, we extracted the following information\nfrom each available, valid and published CG identified: cor-\nresponding, leading, or first author; year published; number\nof defined quality indicators; and quality dimensions accord-\ning to Donabedian,14 that is, indicator for structure, process,\nor patient outcome quality. The extracted data were summa-\nrized on CG level, for German CG on the level of the meth-\nodological approaches and for NICE CG on the level of the\ntitle of the related quality standard and the year of whose\npublication. If the independent reviewers (T.P., S.D.)\nextracted different information, a third reviewer (J.S.) was\nconsulted and the information was discussed.\nFurther analyses were conducted for pairs of CG. Analyses\nof quality indicators of pairs of CG focusing on identical medi-\ncal problems were compared according to the content of the\nquality indicators, the methodology used to define quality indi-\ncators, data sources of quality indicators, the rationale and CG\nrecommendation of the quality indicators, and their clinimetric\nproperties. For NICE quality indicators, also the information of\nthe quality standard was extracted and analyzed. Quality stan-\ndards are used to develop outcome measures which represent\nthe quality of care for a specific medical problem.5 The rele-\nvance of the different clinimetric properties differs between\nquality indicators which are based either on definitions or on\n(latent) constructs. Thus, the relevant clinimetric properties for\nquality indicators were categorized as shown in Figure 1.\nIn addition, the methodology manuals of the German and\nNICE CG developers were analyzed to identify instruments\nfor measuring the feasibility of guidelines concerning the\nassessments of the quality indicator recommendations.\nThe execution of a risk of bias assessment was not possi-\nble due to the research question and the information sources.\nResults\nMethodology of Quality Indicator Derivation in CGs\nThe definition and dissemination of quality indicators rele-\nvant to CGs occurs both in Germany and NICE.20-24 The rec-\nommended methodology of the derivation of quality\nindicators differed between Germany and NICE.\nIn Germany, 3 groups developed CGs with different\nmethodological approaches:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Voluntary initiatives of medical societies (VIMS)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Disease Management Guidelines (DMG)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO).\nIn DMG und GGPO, quality indicators are derived from CG\nrecommendations graded \"A\" or with the syntax/modality\n\"shall.\" In voluntary CG initiatives of medical societies, the\nPetzold et al 3\nprocess of quality indicator derivation is not described. In the\nfunded structured German CG programs DMG und GGPO,\nquality indicators were derived from CG recommendations\n(Figure 2). Existing quality indicators pertaining to specific\nmedical issues were identified by a systematic literature search\nand evaluated by experts with the help of the QUALIFY\ninstrument.25 The QUALIFY instrument provides guidance\nfor the structured assessment of quality indicator development\nand validation. Selected experts are asked for each quality\nindicator to assess the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Relevance: importance of the quality characteristic\ncaptured by the quality indicator for patients and the\nhealth care system, benefit, consideration of potential\nrisks/side effects\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scientific soundness/indicator evidence: clarity of\ndefinition, reliability, ability of statistical differentia-\ntion, risk adjustment, sensitivity, specificity, validity;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Feasibility: interpretability for patients and the inter-\nested public; interpretability for physicians and\nnurses; indicator expression can be influenced by pro-\nviders; data availability; data collection effort; barri-\ners for implementation considered; correctness of data\ncan be verified; completeness of data can be verified;\ncomplete count of data sets can be verified.25\nAccording to the QUALIFY instrument,25 positively rated quality\nindicators shall be linked to guideline recommendations.21\nThere is no standard specifying at what stage in the pro-\ncess of the guideline work quality indicators are to be selected\nfor recommendation. The definition of quality indicators in\nvoluntary initiatives of medical societies is optional. In DMG\nand GGPO, a systematic approach is pursued,21,22 which is\nbased on a systematic review of existing and used quality\nindicators. The detected quality indicators are derived only\nfor strong CG recommendations or with the syntax/modality\n\"shall\" and evaluated by an expert committee applying the\nQUALIFY instrument (Figure 2).\nIn England and Wales, the NICE will be mandated to\ndevelop CGs together with medical societies and organiza-\ntions. Out of these CGs, quality standards were derived in\nwhich quality statements are described. The quality state-\nments are based on CG recommendations from NICE and\nother organisations.24 Quality standards are associated with\nthe CG and a concise set of measurable quality statements to\nimprove the quality of care in a particular area of health care.\nQuality statements are composed of quality indicators to\nmeasure specific structures, processes, or outcomes in health\ncare.26 Quality indicators are clearly defined27 and critically\nappraised and evaluated by experts with regard to their utility\nfor the sustainable CG implementation. For new quality stan-\ndards in new settings or services, a field testing in the form of\nconsultation is recommended. The consultation includes\nexamining the relevance, utility, clarity, potential impact,\nand the acceptability of the quality standards with providers,\npayers, and patients.28 The comments of providers, payers,\nand patients as results of the field testing are discussed by the\nQuality Standard Advisory Committee (QSAC). The quality\nstandard is refined with the input from providers, payers, and\npatients and the QSAC members. This is followed by the\nprocess of internal quality assurance, consistency checking,\nand approval by an associate director in the NICE quality\nFigure 1. Categorization of quality indicators by their measurement basis.\nstandard team. This is to ensure the validity of the content\nprior to the publication of the quality standards (Figure 2).\nThe Department of Health determines new relevant public\nhealth topics and requests NICE to develop quality standards.\nNew topics for CGs and quality standard development are\nderived through new government or commissioner priorities.28\nQuality Indicator Recommendations\nwere identified. Eighty-seven of 183 S3 CGs are available\nand published. The remaining 96 S3 CGs were preliminarily\nregistered or under revision and therefore not included in fur-\nther analyses.\nhave been defined (Figure 3), with a total of 394 quality indi-\ncators being recommended (2-52 per CG).

Fifty-eight quality indicators (15%) are\nbased on an underlying construct (single- or multi-item\ninstrument) as measurement basis.

Statements regarding data source and\nclinimetric properties of quality indicators were reported for\nnone of the 394 quality indicators. Twenty-one (5%)\nrecommended quality indicators measure structural quality,\n(Online Supplemental Table 3).\nFrom NICE CGs, a total of 133 CGs and 58 quality stan-\ndards were available (effective April 1, 2014), all of which\nrecommended quality indicators relevant to CG (Figure 3).\nincluded in the 58 identified quality standards. All quality\nindicators out of quality standards that are relevant to CG\nwere derived from CG recommendations.24,29 For all qual-\nity indicators, information on numerator, denominator, data\nsource, rationale, and CG recommendation of the quality\nindicators was provided.

Thirteen of these 41 pairs of CGs include\nquality indicators (Table 1). In these 13 pairs, a total of 128\nquality indicators were defined in German CGs. A total 468\nquality indicators were defined in NICE CGs. Four (3%) of\nthe 128 quality indicators of German CG embrace structural\nquality. One hundred seventy-two (37%) indicators relevant\nto NICE CGs capture structural quality, 232 (50%) process\nIn the 13 pairs of CGs related to identical medical prob-\nlems, 34 quality indicators refer to the same aspect of the\nity indicators. Ten of 13 German CGs are exclusively process\nindicators compared with 0 of 13 for NICE. The rationales\nfor quality indicator recommendation also differed substan-\ntially. Twenty-three of 34 rationales refer to the same aspect\nof quality of care. German and NICE quality indicators differ\nin 11 rationales. Rationale is a statement in which the spe-\ncific aspect of health care is described, assessed by the qual-\nity indicator.30 In the following CGs, there was a similar\nalignment of quality indicators: depression in adults. In this\npair of CGs,31,32 the severity of symptoms was considered as\na measurable outcome in Germany and by NICE. In other\nCGs such as those for psoriasis,33 no common objectives of\nquality indicators in NICE and German CGs were identified.\nIn the German CGs, the average Psoriasis Area Severity\nIndex (PASI),34 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),35\nand the inability to work are measured as the defined quality\nindicators.33 In the corresponding NICE CG \"Psoriasis,\"36 15\nquality indicators were recommended to measure disease\nseverity at diagnosis; the impact of the disease on physical,\npsychological, and social well-being at diagnosis; and the\nreceipt of diagnostic measures.36\nTable 2.

While in\nGermany 3 different methodological approaches are applied,\none common approach is applied in NICE. Quality indicators\nfrom NICE CGs have the advantage that unambiguous defini-\ntions, data sources, and information on pilot tests are available.\nSuch information would be helpful for quality indicators in\nGerman CGs as well to sustainably improve quality measure-\nment according to CGs. Therefore, CG developers in Germany\nwould benefit from a standardized methodology for the deriva-\ntion of quality indicators relevant to CGs. Quality indicators\nare measureable indicators of CG implementation to ascertain\nthe improvement of structures, processes, and outcomes in\nhealth care. This is why the methodology of quality indicator\nderivation has to meet standards as high as those for the devel-\nopment of CG recommendations. Other studies37,38 that exam-\nined quality indicators in CG focused also on sophisticated,\nevidence-driven methodology of measureable endpoints.\nThe developmental process and the evaluation of quality\nindicators in routine care are important steps of quality measure-\nment and improvement. The methodological approaches of the\nGerman DMG, GGPO, and NICE represent a structured and\ntransparent approach to the development of quality indicators in\nCGs. Voluntary CG initiatives of medical societies, which\ndevelop the vast majority of S3 CGs in Germany (82%), have\ncurrently no clear methodological guidance on how to derive\nquality indicators based on CG recommendations. As 2 similar\nmethodological approaches (DMG and GGPO) already exist in\nGermany, a corresponding methodology should be developed\nand published to support medical societies. There is no defined\nprocedure in all 4 methodological approaches (3 from Germany,\n1 from NICE) for the evaluation of quality indicators. In the\nNICE CG manual, a collection of feedback is reported, which\ninfluences the updating process of the quality indicators.Aclini-\nmetric testing of the quality indicators in routine care is not pro-\nvided in any methodology. As a consequence, no statements on\nthe quality of the quality indicators are available. This is an\nimportant limitation as we know from evidence-based medicine\nthat measurement instruments of unclear quality overestimate,\nunderestimate, or misjudge quality effects of interventions.12\nThree hundred ninety-four quality indicators were found in\nGerman CGs and 1795 in CGs of NICE. The majority of these\nquality indicators (86% in Germany and 40% of NICE) are\nused to measure process quality. Only 8% in German CGs and\n21% of NICE CGs of the defined quality indicators measure\noutcome quality. The measurement of health care outcomes is\nof great interest, especially for patients and their relatives.\nAlso health insurance funds need data on outcome quality to\nsupport their assured when choosing a service provider or\nsingle treatment options. Quality indicators should be based\non health care data to derive realistic treatment options. The\nmajority of quality indicators (85% in German CGs and 77%\nin NICE CGs) are based on definitions of experts or develop-\ners. The use of single- or multi-item instruments would be\nhelpful to prove the goodness of quality indicators.\nThis systematic analysis of CGs identified pairs of German\nand British CGs focusing on the same medical issue. However,\nthe quality indicators recommended in these pairs of CGs dif-\nfer in their quantity, definition, and rationale. The rationale\nand CG recommendations are relevant for the derivation of\nquality indicators. In Germany, it is unclear which guideline\nrecommendations are used to derivate quality indicators.\nThe missing objectives for health care performance and\noutcomes in Germany are a possible reason for the develop-\nment and implementation different quality measures. Only\nwith distinct objectives for health care can measurable, rele-\nvant and sustainable endpoints of health care be developed\nand implemented. In the United Kingdom, health care objec-\ntives exist to improve the patient safety and quality of health\nand health care, whereas no common health care objectives\nBoth in CGs from NICE and from Germany, information\non clinimetric properties of the quality indicators recom-\nmended, that is, information on their validity and reliability, is\nmissing. However, such information on quality indicators is\ncrucial for their implementation in routine care and a neces-\nsary prerequisite to obtain resilient and convincing results.20,40\nTherefore, a standardized method appears necessary in both\ncountries for the implementation of these requirements.\nCore Outcome Sets (COS) could be a possibility to derive\nquality indicators related to CG. COS represent the mini-\nmum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported\nin investigations or analyses of a specific medical issue. This\nis a necessary prerequisite to compare results of studies and\nto optimize the use of research evidence for clinical decision\nmaking. COS are being increasingly developed for clinical\ntrials and effectiveness studies, on the basis of a systematic\nappraisal of research evidence and consensus by an (interna-\ntional) multidisciplinary expert panel.41 The COMET (Core\nOutcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials; www.comet-ini-\ntiative.org) Initiative provides an overview of existing\nCOS.42,43 Core outcome domains should be assessed with\nadequate measurement instruments, that is, instruments with\nhigh validity, reliability, and responsiveness.44,45 A roadmap\nfor the systematic development and implementation of\nCOS46,47 hasbeensuggestedbytheinternationalHarmonizing\nOutcomes for Eczema (HOME) initiative.48 Currently, the\ndevelopment of quality indicators from German CGs does\nnot include the review of an existing COS for the clinical\nproblem. This might be an effective strategy to translate clin-\nical outcomes into patient-relevant quality indicators to be\nused in routine care, as done in NICE CG program.\nWe furthermore suggest to apply the COS principle in the\nfield of quality assurance. National Core Indicator Sets applied\nin different settings and fields might help set the agenda for\nprocess development in health care. An international COS of\nquality indicators would allow comparisons between different\nhealth care systems.Afirst comparison of the overlap between\nCOS and the quality indicators defined in pairs of CG from\nGermany and NICE concerning the same medical condition\nidentified 3 areas in which a COS as well as quality indicators\nfrom German and NICE guidelines exist (effective December\nmedical fields might be a good starting point for a comprehen-\nsive international process to bridge the assessment of effec-\ntiveness in trials with quality assurance in routine care and\nthus to help overcome the evidence-practice gap.\nThe Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE) instrument was developed for the methodical evalu-\nation of CG and is internationally applied.53 A translation for\nGerman guidelines exists Deutsches Leitlinien-Bewertungs-\nInstrument (DELBI).54 These 2 checklists determine the qual-\nity of CG. Both instruments contain criteria for the evaluation\nof CG recommendations. These criteria do not refer to quality\nindicators related to CG. The sustainability of the treatment\nrecommendations in CG is not guaranteed and does not appear\nin the form of quality indicators in AGREE or DELBI.\nEvaluated and sustainable CG recommendations are necessary\nfor the methodological quality of CG and their implementation\nin routine care. Quality indicators could be a suitable method to\nattest the sustainability in routine care.\nStrengths and Limitations of This Study\nWe applied systematic review methodology to guarantee\ncompleteness and validity of the information extracted from\nCG. The study was conducted based on a priori defined inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria. A systematic literature search in\nrelevant CGs was independently assessed by 2 reviewers, and\nrelevant information concerning quality indicators was\nextracted in a standardized manner. After comparing the data\nextraction and consensus discussion, the evidence synthesis\ntook place. A limitation of the work is possibly the restriction\nin German guidelines on the group of the S3 CGs. These are\nevidence- and consensus-based and currently represent the\ngold standard for CG in Germany. Therefore, a transfer of the\nresults of our work to other German guidelines may be lim-\nited, and the proportion of guidelines with formulated quality\nindicators in S1 and S2 CGs may be different. The systematic\nSince that period, the NICE quality standard program has\nbeen advanced with 115 published NICE quality standards.\nWe did not extend our data set because in-depth analyses of\nCG-recommended quality indicators are highly time-con-\nsuming. Furthermore, adding further quality standards is not\nlikely to contribute more substantial insights.\nImplications for Future Research\nThe comparison of quality indicators in German and NICE\nCGs emphasized that different quality indicators are defined\nand used in Germany and NICE for similar medical conditions.\nOne possible reason could be the different structures of the\nunderlying health care systems. The different methodologies\nused to derive quality indicators related to CGs may represent\nanother issue. To enable a learning system of quality measure-\nment with the help of CGs, an international forum should be\nestablished. The Guidelines International Network (GIN;\nwww.g-i-n.net) could serve as a suitable organization for pro-\nmoting the issue of quality measurement in international CGs.\nA uniform and internationally accepted methodology for the\nderivation of quality indicators in CGs should be a major aim.\nThis approach would allow a first international comparison of\nthe quality of care in different health care systems.\nConclusion\nIn Germany and the NICE, almost the same diseases are rep-\nresented in the guideline framework. In these CGs, similar\nCG recommendations are derived. However, the efficacy of\nthose recommendations is evaluated with different quality\nindicators in Germany and the NICE coverage. A possible\nexplanation of different quality indicators could be the dif-\nferent approaches are their development. To prove the effi-\ncacy of CG recommendations, quality indicators should be\nof sophisticated methodological goodness. The clinimetric\nproperties of all quality indicators recommended in CGs of\nNICE and in Germany are unclear. This constitutes a major\nrisk for inadequate conclusions concerning the quality of\ncare. The measurement of quality of care for specific medical\nconditions requires quality indicators of a high methodologi-\ncal quality. An internationally accepted methodological\napproach does not exist at present but is necessary for the\nderivation of internationally comparable quality indicators in\nhealth care. The idea of Core Quality Indicator Sets could\nsupport quality measurement as it represents an opportunity\nto consistently measure relevant indicators of quality of care.\n"
