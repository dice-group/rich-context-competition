However, existing models of emergent literacy focus on discrete skills and\nmiss the perspective of the surrounding environment. Early literacy skills, including their relationship to one another,\nand the substantial impact of the setting and context, are critical in ensuring that children gain all of the preliminary skills and\nawareness they will need to become successful readers and writers. Research findings over the last few decades have led\nto a fuller understanding of all that emergent literacy includes, resulting in a need for a new, more comprehensive model.\nA new model, described in this article, strives to explain how emergent literacy can be viewed as an interactive process of\nskills and context rather than a linear series of individual components. Early literacy learning opportunities are more likely\nto happen when teachers have a solid knowledge base of emergent literacy and child development. Research has shown that\npreschool teachers with limited knowledge about literacy development are significantly less able to provide such experiences\nfor children. Teachers will be better able to facilitate all of the components of emergent literacy if they have access to, and\nunderstanding of, a model that describes the components, their interactions, and the importance of environmental factors\nin supporting children.\n",

Starting children on the path\nto reading begins early. Children learn about the function and\nprocess of reading long before they pick up a book and\ndecode the text. These early skills, known as Emergent\nLiteracy (EL), include the knowledge and abilities related to\nthe alphabet, phonological awareness, symbolic representa-\ntion, and communication. The comprehension of these con-\ncepts builds over time beginning when children are very\nyoung, typically between birth and age 5. The idea of EL was\nfurther in the 1980s to challenge the then-current notion that\nchildren were not ready to become literate until reaching a\nspecific point in time, determined by the child's age and\nRowe, & MacGillivray, 2000). Since then, EL has been rec-\nognized as a vital content area in preschool curriculum, with\na strong research base supporting its use (Blank, 2012;\nConnor, Morrison, & Slominsk, 2006; Watson & Wildy,\nExisting models of EL tell only part of the story; they\nfocus on discrete skills but without a perspective of the envi-\nronment surrounding them. Yet, understanding these skills of\nEL--along with how they relate to one another--and recog-\nnizing the importance of the setting and context, is critical in\nensuring that children gain all of the preliminary skills and\nawareness they will need to become successful readers and\nwriters. Research findings since the development of early\nmodels of EL have led to a fuller appreciation of the com-\nplexities of EL, resulting in a need for the new, more compre-\nhensive model introduced here. The new model, described in\nthis article strives to explain how EL can be viewed as an\ninteractive process rather than simply a series of individual\nand is now recognized as a combination of developmentally\nappropriate practice (DAP; Copple & Bredekamp, 2009)\nwith an intentional focus on providing opportunities for chil-\ndren to learn about literacy (International Reading\nAssociation & The National Association for the Education of\n1Salem State University, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLeigh Rohde, School of Education, Salem State University, 352 Lafayette\nEmail: lrohde@salemstate.edu\nThe Comprehensive Emergent Literacy\nModel: Early Literacy in Context\nLeigh Rohde1\n Keywords\neducation, social sciences, curriculum, literacy, education theory and practice, early childhood, educational psychology and\ncounseling, educational research, teacher education, students, teaching\n2 SAGE Open\nYoung Children, 1998). DAP is a research-based framework\nof practices used to design educational experiences for young\nchildren. It serves as a foundation for the work of the National\nAssociation for the Education of Young Children (Copple &\nBredekamp, 2009). However, research has shown that\nalthough there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of EL\nsupport and instruction, it is rarely practiced in early child-\nhood programs (Powell, Diamond, & Koehler, 2009). In\naddition, research has shown that some Early Childhood\nEducation (ECE) professionals are limited in their awareness\nand knowledge of EL (LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2007; Powell,\nDiamond, Bojczyk, & Gerde, 2008) and that little instruction\nin EL, or any of the individual components of EL, is happen-\ning in preschool classrooms (Justice, Mashburn, Hamre, &\nPianta, 2008). There is clearly a gap between research and\npractice of EL in ECE programs. This disparity may be due\nto a lack of resources or knowledge in providing high-quality\nEL learning opportunities in ECE classrooms.\nMany early childhood educators have recognized the\nimportance of providing more explicit instruction for their\nstudents asking for training and support (Dickinson &\ncate tension between teaching EL, using DAP, and address-\ning the new curriculum standards. These challenges may, at\nleast in part, be attributed to a lack of educators' understand-\ning of how these factors can work in harmony. Early literacy\nlearning opportunities are more likely to happen when teach-\ners have a solid knowledge base of EL and child develop-\nment. Conversely, preschool teachers with limited knowledge\nabout literacy development are significantly less able to pro-\nvide such experiences for children (Burgess et al., 2001;\nTeachers will be better able to facilitate all of the components\nof EL if they have access to--and comprehension of--a\nmodel that describes the components, the interaction between\nthe components, and the importance of environmental fac-\ntors in supporting children. This article describes such a\nmodel.\nThis article will first review the history and current mod-\nels of EL. Next, the comprehensive emergent literacy model\n(CELM) will be introduced and described, illustrating the\nimportant interactions between these components. The con-\ntext of EL learning will be explained and its importance to\nlearning will be considered. Finally, potential uses of the\nmodel, both in professional development and the lives of\nyoung children, will be discussed.\nEarly Research in EL\nMuch of the early research in EL provided support for the\nproposition that \"growth in writing and reading comes from\nwithin the child as a result of environmental stimulation . . .\nthe growth that has been observed occurs without the neces-\nsity for formal teaching\" (Teale & Sulzby, 1986, p. xx). Yet,\na close look at this research reveals that children's ability to\ndevelop EL skills depends on their access to rich literacy\nexperiences and expert partners from whom they can learn\ncentered on how children build knowledge and skills about\nliteracy starting very early in life. EL is founded on the the-\nory that literacy emerges from children before they are for-\nmally taught to read. In addition, its definition goes beyond\ndecoding--encompasses the processes of reading, writing,\nspeaking, and listening. The child's point of view and active\ninvolvement with literacy constructs are highlighted during\nEL learning; similarly, the social setting in which children\nare learning about literacy is addressed (Mason & Sinha,\nThe initial work on the social implications of communica-\ntion and literacy was built on the conceptual framework of\nEL. During the first half of the 1980s, EL researchers joined\ntogether to challenge the traditional way of thinking about\nthe way children gain literacy skills (Teale & Sulzby, 1987).\nResearch emphasized two basic trends: first, a focus on the\ncognitive processes that influence learning; and second, a\nrenewed research interest in the sequencing of children's\nful examination of young children and their development led\nthese researchers to a new way of thinking about children\nlearning literacy.\nEarly research resulted in a pendulum shift away from a\nmaturationist view of \"attaining literacy\" as a construct and\ntoward a more \"academic\" approach to early literacy (Gesell,\nSome educators and others claimed that the naturalistic and\nmaturational view of EL--in which the teaching approach\nwas to wait for children to develop--resulted in a delay or\nlack of direct instruction. The outcome was many children\nfailing to learn to read, or at least failing to gain the necessary\nearly literacy knowledge to be successful in early elementary\nThis realization by researchers and early childhood educa-\ntors acknowledged a need for a different approach to literacy\nlearning for young children.\nEarly Models of EL\nTwo models are found in the research literature that concep-\ntualize the common skills related to early perceptions of lit-\neracy prior to conventional literacy and their relationship to\none another (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, LeFevre, Smith-Chant, & Colton,\n2001). The two, the outside-in, inside-out model and the\nfour-component model, include language development as\npart of EL and are described in detail below.\nOutside-In, Inside-Out Model\nWhitehurst and Lonigan's (1998) model of EL describes two\ninterdependent domains (\"Outside-In\" and \"Inside-out\") of\nprocesses and skills. It is represented as a continuum with the\nknowledge of context at one end and understanding of rules\nof letters and their sounds at the other. The term Outside-In\nprocesses is used to describe conceptual knowledge, such as\nthe function of print, particularly in the context of narrative.\nChildren's processing of the overall text, according to the\nauthors, is where the \"understanding of the context in which\nthey are trying to read (or write) occurs\" (p. 854). Whitehurst\nand Lonigan recognized that \"comprehension of all but the\nsimplest of writing depends on knowledge that cannot be\nfound in the word or sentence itself\" (p. 854). The outside-in\nend of the literacy continuum recognizes that reading is inef-\nfective without comprehension strategies, including the use\nof background knowledge, to decipher the message of the\nwriter to the reader.\nThe term Inside-Out processes describes procedural\nknowledge related to skills of literacy. This includes under-\nstanding how to match the smallest components of literacy,\nsounds, and print units (e.g., letters) together, moving toward\nlarger units of words (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal et al., 2001).\nThe outside-in, inside-out model is a continuum of skills\nand concepts. In the middle of the model are \"language\nunits\" (e.g., words) that demonstrate the merger of skills\n(e.g., putting letters and sounds together into words) and\nconceptual knowledge (e.g., inferring meaning from text).\nWhitehurst and Lonigan (1998) posited that to successfully\ntransition into conventional reading, children must have both\nprocedural and conceptual skills of literacy.\nFour-Component Model\nA second model, developed by Mason and Stewart (1990),\nalso includes both conceptual and procedural knowledge of\nEL learning. The four-component model consists of four\nblocks: (a) concepts and functions of literacy, (b) writing and\ncomposing, (c) knowledge about letters and words, and (d) lis-\ntening comprehension and word understanding (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal et\nal., 2001). Concepts and functions of literacy are the broad\nunderstandings and behaviors related to reading and writing.\nThese do not include specific skills but rather an overarching\nperception of literacy. For instance, children understand that\nprint is static and remains consistent over time. The writing\nand composing component focuses on words and sentences in\nterms of composition, but not specific letter formation or\n\"drawing.\" Knowledge about letters and words includes\nalphabet knowledge and phonological awareness, including\nletter\u00adsound relationships. This component comprises much\nmore specific knowledge and skills than the first two compo-\nnents. Last, listening comprehension and word understanding\nrelates to language, specifically narrative knowledge and\nvocabulary.\nThe four-component model contains the broad, overarch-\ning concepts of literacy (e.g., that print carries meaning), as\nthey are interpreted by young children. It also includes spe-\ncific skills that young children learn about text, language,\nand the intricacies of literacy (i.e., the shapes of letters).\nHowever, each of the four blocks is presented individually\nwith little mention by the author of how the components\ninteract with one another.\nBoth models have similar EL components although they\nare presented in different orientations. They both include\nconceptual knowledge about the function of reading and\nwriting, beginning procedural knowledge of how literacy\nworks, oral language skills, including vocabulary, and meta-\nlinguistic skills such as phonological awareness (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal et\nal., 2001). In addition, both models include the importance of\nconsidering knowledge beyond EL skills, for instance, back-\nground knowledge and awareness of semantics (e.g., the\nmeanings of language) and pragmatics (e.g., the situational\ncontext of language).\nThe Development of EL Skills\nEach individual component of EL is comprised of complex\ndevelopmental sequences. EL has been referred to as a devel-\nopmental continuum (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal et al., 2001; Teale & Sulzby,\nthat, additionally, each component of EL is on its own trajec-\ntory of development and the components are not strictly\nrelated to one another as part of a consecutive sequence\nlong recognized and documented that young children develop\noral language skills using consistent patterns and sequences\n(von Tetzchner, Merete Brekke, Sjothun, & Grindheim,\n2005). Phonological awareness skill development follows a\nsequence as well, with rhyming and alliteration as the begin-\nning and segmenting and blending phonemes later on\n(Goswami, 2001). Similarly, children's emergent writing\ndevelops through a series of stages from scribbling to pseu-\ndoletters to inventive spelling (Sulzby, 1989). There is not\none clear path of EL development but rather a series of asso-\nciated and concurrent experiences that result in the building\nof knowledge and skills related to the literacy process. For\ninstance, a child's emergent writing development may be\nenhanced by, though not necessarily dependent on, his or her\nlevel of phonological awareness. Recognizing these stages of\ndevelopment within each component of EL is important in\nproviding appropriate learning opportunities and scaffolded\nsupport.\nThe two recognized models (Mason & Stewart, 1990;\nWhitehurst & Lonigan, 1998), described above, do not\naddress the complexities of EL. Based on new research, a\n4 SAGE Open\ncomprehensive model of EL is proposed. It describes each of\nthe components of EL, the interrelationships between the\ncomponents, and the importance of culture and community.\nA New Model of EL\nThe CELM goes beyond a set of skills to bring four addi-\ntional considerations to these existing models: (a) Each EL\ncomponent has its own developmental sequence; (b) each\ncomponent supports the development of other components\nas part of a holistic appreciation, rather than in a linear way\nas found in early models; (c) the importance of recognizing\nthe environment in which children and their families live;\nand (d) this model connects EL components with the recom-\nmendations of three national authorities on ECE and EL\nlearning. These distinctive aspects of CELM provide clarity\nto the value of each EL component as well as the interactive\nnature of the components.\nThree national organizations have provided published\nguidelines and recommendations of strategies to promote EL\nlearning in preschoolers that were used in the development\nof the CELM. In 1998, the International Reading Association\nand the National Association for the Education of Young\nChildren produced a joint position statement on EL\n(International Reading Association & The National\nAssociation for the Education of Young Children, 1998).\nThisdocument,LearningtoReadandWrite:Developmentally\nAppropriate Practices for Young Children, is still dissemi-\nnated widely as a reputable source of recommended prac-\ntices. The third organization, Head Start, released their Child\nOutcomes framework containing recommendations for all\nareas of child development, including EL learning\n(Administration on Children, Youth and Families/Head Start\nBureau, 2001). Each of these organizations' guidelines was\nused as a means to evaluate the soundness of this new model\nof EL.\nThe CELM represents all of the components of EL in a\nVenn diagram of circles (see the appendix) set in a context of\nenvironmental indicators. The intersections and overlaps of\nthe model demonstrate the holistic nature of EL learning for\nyoung children. As is true for all children's learning, EL is\nbest learned, and understood, as knowledge that affects all\nparts of a young child's life. The CELM illustrates a different\nway of looking at the contexts children live in, and the skills\nand understandings they gain as they move toward conven-\ntional literacy.\nThe CELM model is loosely based on the work of James\nCunningham (1993) and his Whole-to-Part Literacy\nAssessment. This assessment focuses on three components of\nreading. Each component is a distinct and separate ability that\nis necessary for successful reading; each component is also\nmade up of parts that can be assessed to determine why chil-\ndren may be struggling to learn to read. The three components\nare (a) Word Identification, (b) Listening Comprehension,\nand (c) Silent Reading Comprehension. Each component\nconsists of specific skills that emergent readers must learn\nand understand before they can acquire conventional\nliteracy.\nThe CELM model contains three similar components,\neach a precursor to the components listed above. First, print\nawareness leads to word identification. Print awareness\nincludes alphabet knowledge and concepts of print (e.g.,\nbook handling skills). Second, phonological awareness is\nclosely related to listening comprehension. Phonological\nawareness includes skills like rhyming and segmenting\nsounds. The third component, oral language, leads to silent\nreading comprehension. Oral language includes under-\nstanding and using vocabulary, background knowledge,\nand semantics. There are also skills that overlap these com-\nponents. Print awareness and phonological awareness over-\nlap with skills such as understanding the relationship\nbetween letters and sounds and inventive spelling. The\noverlap between oral language and print awareness includes\nskills like using grammar and understanding syntax. The\noverlap between oral language and phonological awareness\nincludes skills related to lexical restructuring, a mental\norganization of words using sounds rather than the meaning\nof words.\nIn addition, the CELM recognizes and emphasizes the\nrelationship and the overlap of skills and knowledge between\nthe major components.Afourth component, writing, includes\nall of the pieces of the model. Writing has a strong reciprocal\nrelationship with the other three components (Teale &\nSulzby, 1987). The skills of composition and the mechanics\nof writing support the skills of language development, print\nawareness, and phonological awareness. These components\nare also critical in supporting the development of the skills\nand conventions related to the writing process.\nWriting is situated in the center of the model as it is where\nchildren can often demonstrate their knowledge of literacy\nconcepts. Through emergent writing, children can manipu-\nlate alphabet letters, word choice, and letter/sound relation-\nship in authentic and purposeful ways. Creating their own\nmessages and stories, children can create deeper awareness\nof the components more closely related to reading. Writing is\nwhere all the pieces come together and are used to produce a\nnew message--The children are now the initiators of literacy\nrather than the receivers.\nThe components of EL include the skills that children\ndevelop prior to conventional reading and writing as well as\nthe conceptual knowledge of print and how it functions.\nThere is some debate as to the specific skills to be included\nin EL (S\u00e9n\u00e9chal et al., 2001). It is universally understood that\nthe theory of EL promotes learning literacy as a process\n(Guo, Justice, Kaderavek, & McGinty, 2012; Helland, Tjus,\nHovden, Ofte, & Heimann, 2011; Lanter, Watson, Erickson,\n& Freeman, 2012; Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj-\nIn the next section, the four specific components of EL are\ndescribed, as illustrated in the CELM, and cited by the major\ndocuments described above.\nLanguage Development\nOral language development is a critical aspect of literacy\nlearning (Roskos, Tabors, & Lenhart, 2004; Whitehurst\n&Lonigan, 2001). Children depend on language for social\ninteraction and communication, demonstration of ability and\nknowledge, and acquiring new concepts (McGee & Richgels,\n2003). A child's familiarity with language and vocabulary is\nstrongly linked to his or her later literacy success (Lane &\nWright, 2007). Despite the recognized importance, opportu-\nnities for children to develop oral language skills can be lim-\nited in preschool (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998; Tabors, &\nSnow, 2001). This may be due to curriculum or instructional\ndecisions made by educators, such as requiring children to\nraise their hands before speaking or teachers primarily ask-\ning yes/no questions of their students.\nResearchers have suggested that there is a need to con-\nsider a wider range of oral language skills, beyond vocabu-\nlary and phonological awareness, to better understand the\nconnection between oral language and literacy (Roth, Speece,\n(2002) concluded that the variables associated with early oral\nlanguage development provided an initial advantage in gain-\ning conventional literacy skills. However, much of that\nadvantage could be mediated by effective instruction in both\noral language development and early literacy skills.\nPhonological Awareness\nPhonological awareness is the ability to detect, identify, and\nmanipulate the sound structure of language, along with being\none of the strongest predictors of later reading success\n(DeBaryshe & Gorecki, 2007; Dickinson, McCabe,\nAnastasopoulos, Peisner-Feinberg, & Poe, 2003; Ehri et al.,\n2001). The importance of acquiring phonological awareness\ncannot be overstated. It is closely linked with most specific\nlearning disabilities in reading (Brady & Shankweiler, 2013;\nMelby-Lerv\u00e5g, Lyster, & Hulme, 2012). There is great sig-\nnificance in a child's awareness of the relationship between\nletters and sounds; according to Adams, it has very strong\n\"predictive power\" to identify students who may struggle\nwith learning to read (Adams, 1998, p. 2). As Goswami\n(2001) determined, awareness of phonemes may need to be\ndirectly taught to some children as they may not develop that\nskill on their own.\nDemonstrating the concept of rhyme is seen as the first\nindicator of phonological awareness in young children\n(Justice & Pullen, 2003). Rhyming, for many children, is the\nfirst time they shift their focus from the meaning of words to\nthe sounds of language (Goswami, 2001). This may be dif-\nficult for some children as \"this sensitivity to the sounds of\nthe phonemes and the differences between them is not con-\nscious. It is deeply imbedded in the subattentional machin-\nery of the language system\" (Adams, 1998, p. 3). It is not\nautomatic for some children to discriminate between the\nsound of language from the meanings of words (Goswami,\n2001), perhaps because most children learn language as\ncommunication first and only later learn to attend to the\nsounds.\nLexical Restructuring--Overlap Between Oral\nLanguage and Phonological Awareness\nThe reorganization of language by sound rather than by defi-\nnition requires children to know about oral language as well\nas phonological awareness. This new type of organization\nhas been referred to as \"lexical restructuring\" in the research\n(Stadler, Watson, & Skahan, 2007; Walley, Metsala, &\nGarlock, 2003). Lexical restructuring \"is based on the prem-\nise that in the normal course of development, children's pho-\nnological representations become increasingly segmental\nand distinctly specified in terms of phonetic features with\ngraphic as the overlap between the language and phonologi-\ncal awareness components.\nThere is great interest in determining why some children\nhave difficulty gaining phonological awareness, primarily\nbecause it relates so closely to later reading success (Anthony,\nbe argued that children with speech and language disabilities\nstruggle because of limited vocabulary rather than an inabil-\nity to learn to distinguish between the sounds of language. If\na major premise of the theory of lexical restructuring is that\nchildren's ability to build this organizational structure\ndepends on the size of their vocabulary, particularly spoken\nwords, it follows that children with limited vocabularies,\nbecause of oral language disabilities, will have further diffi-\nculty building a system of phonemes and morphemes.\nFurther research in examining the phonological awareness\nskills of children with oral language disabilities who have\naccess to high levels of receptive and expressive vocabulary\ncould provide insight to this query.\nPrint Awareness\nPrint Awareness is typically divided into the two primary cat-\negories of alphabet knowledge and concepts of print. Both\ncategories contribute to awareness of how written language\nis constructed and used.\nAlphabet knowledge.Becoming literate depends both on\nknowledge of language and an understanding of text systems\n6 SAGE Open\nand symbols. In the English language, the foundation of text is\nbased on the 26 letters of the alphabet. Alphabet knowledge\nconsists of being able to recognize and name letters (Foulin,\n2005), identify the sounds of letters (Invernizzi & Purcell,\nletters with their sounds (Invernizzi & Purcell, 2003; Juel,\nGriffith, & Gough, 1986). Specifically, the alphabetic princi-\nple, \"the basic concept that letters represent segments of their\nown speech\" (Moats, 2000, p. 10), refers to written letters and\ntheir corresponding phonemes. Letter name knowledge has\nalso been shown to be a strong predictor of later reading suc-\ncess in multiple studies over the past two decades (Foulin,\n2005). It is a critical skill in acquiring the alphabetic princi-\nConcepts of print.The term \"Concepts of Print\" refers to a\nknowledge base about print and how it works (Strickland &\nSchickedanz, 2004). These concepts range from appreciating\nthat print has different functions and that print carries a mes-\nsage to knowing the differences between words and letters.\nAs with phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge,\nconcepts of print comprehension follow a basic developmen-\ntal continuum. Acquiring the concepts of words involves\nbeginning phonological awareness along with alphabet\nknowledge by learning to separate speech into words and to\nmatch sounds with letters (Mason & Allen, 1986).\nComprehension Strategies--Overlap Between\nOral Language and Print Awareness\nPrint awareness relates to oral language learning with regard\nto syntax, grammar, and the similarities and differences\nbetween the spoken and written word. Comprehension strat-\negies of predicting, inferring, and reasoning are used both\nwhen listening and reading. Children learn that the setting\nand context matters when they are speaking and reading.\nCode-Based Knowledge--Overlap Between\nPhonological Awareness and Print Awareness\nPhonological awareness and alphabet knowledge are both\nused in code-based knowledge (Connor et al., 2006). Phonics,\nthe later developing skill of matching letters with their\nsounds, is the first step in learning to decode text. Decoding\nrequires knowledge of the alphabet and the sounds of\nlanguage.\nWriting\nEmergent writing, or a child's first attempt to put marks on\npaper to create a message, begins long before any recogni-\ntion of letters or words may be seen. At first, children are\nsimply realizing that making marks can create meaning.\nEmergent writing is a process that requires the integration of\nphonological awareness (being able to hear and isolate the\nsounds of \"bat\" to /b/-/a/-/t/), print awareness (being aware\nthat text carries the message), and language (being aware\nthat the meanings of words portray a message). The seminal\nwork of Elizabeth Sulzby (1986) first illustrated that children\nacquired many early writing skills and developed knowledge\nabout the process of writing long before they were conven-\ntional readers. This was in direct opposition to how many\nchildren were learning to write in the early elementary\ngrades. It is now understood that children can express their\nawareness of EL through writing.\nEmergent writing is supported by all the other compo-\nnents of EL--language, print awareness, and phonological\nawareness. Children move from writing primarily through\ndrawing and illustration, often accompanied by a spoken\ndescription of their work, to the inclusion of letters (or pseu-\ndoletters) as they gain alphabet skills. These letters will\nmore closely represent words as children gain phonological\nawareness and knowledge of letter\u00adsound relationships.\nResearch has indicated that children who spend time writ-\ning, or in \"code-focused activities,\" have higher levels of\nalphabet knowledge and word recognition than children\nwho spent more time in \"meaning focused activities\"\n(Connor et al., 2006). Other studies point out the literacy\nskills children gain from writing activities during dramatic\nplay as a way to learn about the functions of print\n(Einarsdottir, 1996). Through their grasp of early writing,\nchildren deepen their awareness of the other components of\nEL too.\nImpact of Context on EL\nThe three, interlinked components are situated in the context\nof culture, community, and demographics. A child's ability\nto gain EL skills is influenced by these environmental fac-\ntors as they dictate access to EL opportunities, the impor-\ntance associated with EL, and the support children will\nreceive from people around them to learn about reading and\nwriting.\nThe previously described models (Mason & Stewart,\na combination of conceptual knowledge (e.g., understanding\nthe functions of print and text and emerging [or \"pretend\"]\nreading and writing), and procedural knowledge (e.g., match-\ning alphabet letters and their sounds and book handling\nskills). However, recognition of the role of the environment,\nand in particular social and cultural experiences, were not\nwell captured in the earlier models. Educators in the early\n2000s realized the importance of the environment in ensur-\ning children had sufficient opportunities to interact with lit-\neracy. The learning environment could \"support and extend\nliteracy\" by providing activities as well as materials beyond\njust providing a place for this learning to occur (Roskos &\nIn examining environmental factors on literacy skill\ndevelopment, the role of culture and community must be\nconsidered. There is a strong body of evidence describing the\ncorrelations between social and cultural experiences and suc-\ncess in school and learning to read and write (McLachlan,\n(2001) argued that the role of social contexts, in particular\nthrough relationships, is critical in developing \"literate lan-\nguage\" in young children (p. 59). The seminal study of Hart\nand Risley (1995) clearly demonstrated the effect of environ-\nment, particularly the impact of poverty, on language acqui-\nsition and learning. Through these studies and others, the\nrole that the environment plays on EL is now recognized as\ncritical in supporting literacy growth in young children\nEL is learned within a context of culture, community,\nand demographics. As indicated in the CELM model, these\nthree constructs are important to consider as supports or\nbarriers to young children's access to EL learning experi-\nences. How early learning of literacy is viewed within the\nculture of a child will have an impact on the availability\nand acceptance of EL in that community. For instance, cul-\ntures in which children are \"seen and not heard,\" are likely\nto provide fewer opportunities that encourage expressive\nlanguage skills. Similarly, a family that does not prioritize\nreading, for any number of reasons, is less likely to have a\nwide variety of children's books in the home. Outside the\nchild's immediate home, the community also influences\nEL growth. Community refers to the surrounding neigh-\nborhoods and the decisions made by local boards and orga-\nnizations, such as the provision of toddler story hours at\nthe library or access to high-quality ECE programs.\nDemographics reflect the background experiences and\nlifestyles of both the children and their teachers. Each of\nthese constructs has an impact on children's abilities to\ngain EL.\nPractical Implications of the CELM\nThe CELM presented here provides a framework for teach-\ners, researchers, and other professionals to understand and\nexplore the components and contexts of EL in a comprehen-\nsive and organized way. There are four practical uses for the\nCELM model in ECE settings, two related to working with\nyoung children, one for professional development, and one\nfor further research.\nFirst, the CELM may be used as a way to structure ECE\ncurriculum and instruction. Consistent with recommended\npractice in ECE, the CELM portrays a holistic view of how\nchildren learn about the many parts of EL, including the\ndevelopment of each part, which must be addressed.\nBecause the CELM sets the learning of EL skills and\nknowledge in a culture and a community, it provides a con-\ntext to the learning. Second, it may be used in determining\nareas of strength and need, through assessment of chil-\ndren's use and recognition of EL skills. Students can be\nassessed on individual components of EL to determine\nwhere they may need additional support or experience. On\na larger scale, the CELM can be used to evaluate if the\nchild's home context is likely to support EL learning by\nproviding learning experiences in all areas of EL indicated\nby the model.\nThird, the CELM can serve as a format for providing\nprofessional development to ECE teachers who need a\ndeeper knowledge of EL. Learning can focus on particular\ncomponents of EL or on the entire model depending on the\nneeds of the audience. Beyond the EL components, the\nmodel provides a structure to help teachers learn how\nto support students' learning in the classroom and\ncommunity.\nFourth, the model may also be used in guiding research\nof not only the components of EL but also the relationship\nbetween the components and how best to support young\nchildren's learning. Because it describes each component,\nthe components' interaction with one another, and the set-\ntings that impact learning, the CELM can provide a frame-\nwork to design research not only on how children learn\nabout EL but how that learning impacts their later school\nsuccess. It can also be used in research examining how a\nteacher can best support children's learning. For example,\nthe structure of the model can help to examine the relation-\nship between teachers' efficacy and confidence in providing\nEL learning opportunities and children's success in gaining\nEL skills.\nThe CELM provides the fields of ECE and Literacy with\na new, evidence-based understanding of how young children\nbecome literate. It incorporates not only the skills and under-\nstanding of the individual components of EL but also the\ncontext in which children come to this knowledge. By pro-\nviding ECE teachers with a clearer picture of EL, they will\nbe better able to provide learning opportunities that engage\nchildren in gaining that emergent knowledge of letters,\nwords, and sounds. In turn, children will become successful\nreaders, writers, and learners.\n8 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, M.
