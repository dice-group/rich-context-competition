Introduction\nInjuries and violence among young people continue to have a substantial emotional, physical,\nand economic toll on society. On average, a child dies every hour in the United States from an injury or\nviolent act, and over 30% of all deaths among children age 1\u00ad19 years are from injuries or violence [1,2].\nAnother 22,200 children on average are seen every day in U.S. emergency departments (ED) seeking\ntreatment for nonfatal injuries [1,2]. Injuries can be intentional, such as from an assault, homicide,\nor suicide/self-harm, or they can be unintentional, such as from motor vehicle crashes, drowning,\npoisoning, fires/burns, falls, or suffocation. Injuries can have lasting consequences and result in\na substantial economic burden on society. Each year, injuries to U.S. children 0\u00ad19 years of age result\nin an estimated $94 billion in lifetime medical and work-loss costs [1].\nUnderstanding epidemiology is critical to injury control as it can provide a picture of the public\nhealth and economic burdens that can guide prevention efforts, help identify and reduce risk factors,\nand increase protective factors. The purpose of this study is to use recent U.S. data to examine in detail\nthe epidemiology of injuries among children ages 0\u00ad19 years by age, sex, race/ethnicity, rural/urban\nstatus, and injury mechanism. We specifically focus on trends and differences by injury intent and age\ngroup for both fatal and non-fatal injury rates.\n2. Methods\nWe examined data on fatal and non-fatal injuries among children and teens aged 0\u00ad19 years\nusing two large data systems. All data were accessed using the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's (CDC) Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), which is a\nfree, interactive, online database that provides information on fatal and nonfatal injuries and cost of\ninjuries from a variety of trusted sources [1,3]. Data are publically available and provide no personal\nidentifiable information. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was not needed for this study.\nData on deaths due to injuries and violence came from 1999\u00ad2015 WISQARS fatal reports,\nwhich uses the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). NVSS receives death certificate data from\n50 states and the District of Columbia. Injury deaths were defined as those with an underlying cause\nof death classified by external cause of injury codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision\nICD-10; https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_help/data_sources.html). Unintentional injury\nand suicide deaths included codes X60\u00adX84, Y87.0, or *U03 (terrorism). Unintentional injury did\nnot include iatrogenic injuries (Y40\u00adY84) and intentional injury did not include operations of war\n(Y36). The number of suicide deaths and rates were calculated only for youth 10 years of age and\nolder. Children aged <10 years were excluded because suicidal intent is often not attributed to young\nchildren. These detailed codes for injury deaths are expressed in mechanism (cause) groupings in\nWISQARS (e.g., motor vehicle traffic (MV) occupants, poisonings, fires/burns, falls, and suffocations)\nusing the external cause-of-injury mortality matrix [4]. Deaths for individuals coded as unspecified\nMV traffic road users were included with MV occupant deaths [5]. While the mechanism of homicide\nand suicide deaths (e.g., firearm, poisoning) can be determined on WISQARS, they are combined in\nthis analysis because of low counts in some data cells.\nMetropolitan (`metro') or non-metropolitan (`non-metro') categories were assigned to deaths based\non the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) six-level county-based urbanization classifications\nfor 2013 [6]. The `metro' classification was defined by collapsing urbanization codes for large central\nmetro, large fringe metro, medium metro, and small metro counties; and the `non-metro' classification\nincluded micropolitan and non-core counties. This paper highlights results from the collapsed\ntwo-level metro/non-metro classification based on the 2013 urbanization classification scheme that\nwas applied to the 1999\u00ad2015 data. We examined death rates by age group, sex, race/ethnicity,\ninjury mechanism, metro/non-metro status, state, and year.\nData on individuals treated in U.S. EDs for non-fatal injuries came from the 2001\u00ad2015 National\nElectronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). The NEISS is an ongoing\nsurveillance system that monitors consumer product-related injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs.\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission maintains and operates NEISS, which currently\nincludes 100 hospital emergency departments (ED) that represent a stratified probability sample of all\nU.S. and U.S. territory hospitals that have at least six beds and provide 24-hour emergency services.\nNEISS-AIP is a subsample of 66 of the 100 NEISS hospitals. NEISS-AIP tracks all injuries seen in\nEDs, whether or not they are associated with consumer products. Data from these cases are weighted\nby the inverse of the probability of selection to provide national estimates. Non-fatal injuries were\nexamined by manner (unintentional, intentionally inflicted by another--including sexual assault and\nlegal intervention--hereafter `assault'--and self-harm), age group and mechanism. All definitions\nof causes are provided on the WISQARS website [1], but note that \"struck by/against or crushed\"\nis defined as an injury resulting from being struck by (hit) or crushed by a human, animal, or inanimate\nobject or force other than a vehicle or machinery.\nFatal and non-fatal rates were calculated using the U.S. Census population totals with bridged\nrace categories [7].\n3. Results\n61% of deaths were unintentional, 20% were homicides, and 19% were suicides. Males accounted for\n69% of the deaths and had an overall crude death rate over two times greater than females (21.3 versus\ncrude death rates (Table 1).\nTable 1. Fatal and non-fatal injuries among youth aged 0\u00ad19 years by intent, sex, and age group,\nNational Vital Statistics System and National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program,\nDeaths Non-Fatal\nNumber % Rate Number 95% CI % Rate\nIntent\nSex\nAge Group\n* includes legal intervention and terrorism, but excludes operations of war.\nAdditionally, in 2015, we estimate there were over 8.1 million children 0\u00ad19 years of age treated\nin a U.S. ED for a non-fatal injury (versus over 10.3 million in 1999), with 95% of these visits for\nunintentional injuries compared with 4% for assaults and 2% for self-harm injuries. The highest\n57% of the non-fatally injured patients (Table 1).\n3.1. Leading Causes of Injury Mortality and Morbidity\nFor infants under the age of one, unintentional suffocation was the leading cause of injury death,\nwith over four times the number of deaths as the second leading cause of injury death, homicide\n(Table 2). Unintentional drowning was the leading cause of injury death for children 1\u00ad4 years\nold, and motor vehicle traffic death was the leading cause of injury death for children 5 years and\nolder. Homicides were either the second or the third leading cause of injury death in all age groups,\nwhile suicides ranked second for those 10\u00ad14 and 15\u00ad19 years old. For all age groups, the leading injury\nmechanisms for homicide were firearm, cut/pierce, and suffocation; and the leading mechanisms for\nsuicide were suffocation, firearm, and poisoning (data not shown).\nAmong children younger than 15 years, unintentional falls were the leading cause of ED visits for\ninjury (Table 3). Unintentionally being struck by/against was the leading cause of ED visits for those\n15\u00ad19 years, and the second leading cause for all other age groups. We estimate almost 250,000 youth\n10\u00ad19 years of age were seen in an ED for an assault (the most common injury mechanism being struck\nby/against, sexual assault, cut/pierce, and firearm); almost 130,000 in the same age group were seen\nfor self-harm injuries (poisoning, cut/pierce, and other specified mechanisms).\nTable 2.

Trends in Mortality and Morbidity\nIndividuals younger than 1 and 15\u00ad19 years of age had the highest unintentional injury death rates\nbetween 1999 and 2015 (Figure 1) with the unintentional injury death rate among infants increasing\nThe lowest death rates were found among children aged 5\u00ad9 years, ranging from 3.56 to 7.08 over this\ntime period. Notably, the death rates of infants (31.0) surpassed that of adolescents aged 15\u00ad19 years\nover the 17-year study period for all age groups. Suicide deaths were reported only for the two older age\ngroups. Suicide death rates increased for both age groups between 2007 and 2015, with the increases from\nFigure 1. Injury and violence-related death rates (per 100,000 population) among youth aged 0\u00ad19 years\nby intent and age group, National Vital Statistics System, United States, 1999\u00ad2015.\nIndividuals aged 1\u00ad4 and 15\u00ad19 years had the highest non-fatal unintentional injury rates\n(Figure 2). The non-fatal unintentional injury rates decreased in all age groups, with the age-adjusted\n2015) were over twice the rates of the other age groups.

Injury Mortality by States and Urban Status\nAge-adjusted death rates (2009\u00ad2015 combined) by intent varied greatly across states and regions\nof the United States (Figure 3). Unintentional injury death rates generally were high in the southeast\nand low in New England and the Mideast. States with rates in the highest quartile included AL, AK,\nAR, KY, LA, MO, MS, MT, ND, OK, SC, SD, and WY. Homicide death rates were lowest in New England\nand states along the western northern border (e.g., ID, MN, MT, ND, OR) of the United States and\nhighest in the middle of the country (e.g., AL, IL, OK, LA, MI, MO, MS, NM, TN). Suicide death\nrates were high in the Rocky Mountains (e.g., CO, ID, MT, UT, WY) and lower in the Southeast\n(e.g., GA, FL, MS).\nFigure 3. Cont.\nFigure 3. Injury and violence related death rates (per 100,000 population) among youth aged 0\u00ad19 years\nby intent and state, National Vital Statistics System, United States, 2009\u00ad2015. Note: data for Suicides is\nrate increases over this time period of 25.8% in metro areas and 39.3% in non-metro areas.\nUnintentional injury death rates from 2013\u00ad2015 were highest among American Indian and\nAlaskan Native peoples (AI/AN), with the highest rates among AI/AN (63.6) and Black (66.8) infants,\nand AI/AN 15\u00ad19 year olds (32.5) (Figure 4). Overall, homicide rates were highest among Blacks\n(10.1 for all ages combined), with Blacks 15\u00ad19 years old having homicide rates over twice (28.8) any\nother age and race category. Suicide rates were highest among AI/AN (5.7 for all ages combined) in\nour study population, with AI/AN 15\u00ad19 year olds (27.3) having the highest death rates.\nFigure 4. Injury and violence related death rates (per 100,000 population) among youth aged 0\u00ad19 years\n3.4. Injury Death Rates by Sex, Single Year of Age, Intent, and Mechanism\nThe patterns of death rates widely varied when looking at specific injury intents, mechanisms, sex,\nand year of age as seen in Figure 5 (note that the scales for the vertical axes are different for each intent\nand mechanism). For example, MV occupant death rates were essentially equal for males and females\nthrough the age when adolescents begin to drive on their own; then the male rate is higher than the\nfemale rate; unintentional poisonings, homicides, and suicides had a similar age/gender patterns with\nthe divergence between males and females widening with age. For some mechanisms, death rates\nsubstantially varied by age. For example, unintentional suffocation death rates were essentially zero\nfor individuals older than 12 months, unintentional drowning and fire/burn death rates peaked\nfor children at 1\u00ad4 years old. Some death rates for specific mechanisms and intents were very low,\nincluding unintentional poisonings among those less than 15, unintentional falls among 7\u00ad12 year olds,\nunintentional suffocations for all older than 12 months, and homicides among 7\u00ad13 year olds.\nFigure 5.

Discussion\nSeveral published studies have examined the epidemiology of fatal and non-fatal injuries among\nU.S. children and adolescents [2,8\u00ad12]. Our study complements previous work by using the more recent\ndata, and presenting information on injuries from all intents (i.e., unintentional, homicide/assaults,\nand suicide/self-harm). The results indicate several major areas of concern, most notably the rising\ndeath rates among certain age groups for unintentional injuries and for suicide.\nAs expected, the most common causes of injury death varied by age group. Infants were at\nmost risk for suffocations, while those 1\u00ad4 years of age were at highest risk for drowning, homicides,\nand MV traffic. The top three leading causes of death by age group are: ages 5\u00ad9 years, MV traffic,\nhomicide, and drowning; ages 10\u00ad14 years, MV traffic, suicide, and homicide; and ages 15\u00ad19 years,\nMV traffic, suicide, and homicide. Our findings are consistent with other studies that suggest there is a\nrelationship between the developmental stage of children and the injuries they sustain [13,14]. To be\nmost effective, prevention strategies and programs should be appropriate for the developmental stage\nof their target audience [15].\nInjuries by race/ethnicity showed important disparities, with all unintentional injuries ages\n0\u00ad19 years showing the lowest rates among Asian/Pacific Islander and the highest rates among\nBlacks. These rates from 2013\u00ad2015 were patterned similarly when viewed by five-year age groups.\nThe striking deaths rates for Blacks under age 1 and 15\u00ad19-year old AI/AN youth may be related to\nthe contexts in which these children live, including limited access to resources, environmental factors,\ndisparities in mental and physical health care access and utilization, and high rates of poverty [16].\nHigh rates of homicide among Black youth ages 0\u00ad19 years old may reflect disproportionate exposure\nto social and environmental risk factors for violence--such as poverty, racism, and neighborhood\ncrime--as well as limited educational and occupational opportunities [17\u00ad19]. High suicide rates\namong AI/AN may reflect social and environmental circumstances, including discrimination and\nhistorical trauma, exposure to suicides of others, and limited access to health and mental health\nIn addition to differences by age and race/ethnicity, we found that the leading causes of injury\nmorbidity and mortality also greatly differed by sex. These results are consistent with previous child\ninjury epidemiology conducted by the CDC [21]. Some of these differences can be attributed to\nsocietal expectations, exposure to risks, and behavioral risk factors of the injured child. Injury risk is\ninfluenced by a child's temperament (i.e., activity level, impulsivity, and inhibitory control), personality\n(i.e., sensation seeking), psychosocial and cognitive development (e.g., ability to appraise the risk of\na situation, estimation of one's own physical ability) [22]. Additionally, research suggests that for\nyoung children, supervision by parents and caregivers can also affect risk for unintentional injury [23].\nSupervision can be a powerful protective factor to prevent unintentional injuries, especially for infants\nand toddlers. Dimensions of supervision include attention (e.g., engagement and interaction with\nchild), proximity (e.g., physical closeness, touching, within reach), and continuity (e.g., continuous,\nintermittent, or absent) [24].\nThe field of violence prevention has learned a great deal about which programs, policies,\nand practices are effective at reducing violence or key risk factors for violence. To help states and\ncommunities make decisions about prevention options, the CDC has released a series of technical\npackages that describe the best available evidence. The technical packages cover suicide, child abuse\nand neglect (data not specifically presented in this analysis), youth violence, sexual violence, teen dating\nviolence, and intimate partner violence prevention [25\u00ad29]. The strategies span the social ecology to\nreduce risk and enhance protection at the individual, relationship, community, and societal levels.\nStrategies aim to support safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments by ensuring a strong\nstart through early childhood education, teaching problem solving and relationship skills, promoting\nsocial norms that protect against violence, engaging influential adults and peers, creating protective\nenvironments, strengthening economic and other supports to families, and providing support to lessen\nharms and prevent future risk.\nIn unintentional injury prevention, implementing effective prevention strategies, such as using\nseat belts and child safety seats; disposing of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription drugs; wearing\nbicycle and motorcycle helmets; installing residential smoke alarms; reducing the use of alcohol\n(data not specifically presented in this analysis); using life jackets; installing four-sided self-latching\npool fencing; strengthening graduated driver licensing laws; using safety equipment and implementing\ninjury prevention strategies in sports (data not specifically presented in this analysis); and protecting\nyoung workers from injuries on the job will all contribute to reducing unintentional injuries. The CDC\nNational Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention, developed by CDC and more than 60 stakeholder\norganizations to spark coordinated action to prevent unintentional injuries to children and youth [30],\nprovides a roadmap for strengthening the collection and interpretation of data and surveillance,\npromoting research, enhancing communications, improving education and training, advancing health\nsystems and health care, and strengthening policy.\nTo address the prevention of motor vehicle crash injuries, the leading cause of unintentional injury\ndeaths among those aged 5\u00ad19 years, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with global\npartners including CDC, has produced a technical package on traffic injury prevention. The Save\nLIVES: A Road Safety Technical Package [31] is an evidence-based inventory of priority interventions\nwith a focus on speed management, leadership, infrastructure design and improvement, vehicle safety\nstandards, enforcement of traffic laws, and post-crash survival. The package prioritizes these\n6 strategies and details 22 interventions addressing key risk factors, as well as providing guidance\non their implementation to save lives on the road. This road safety policy package can help guide\ndecision makers on reducing motor vehicle injuries among children and youth. WHO also produced\na World Report on Child Injury Prevention [32], which is a roadmap to keep kids safe by promoting\nevidence-based injury prevention interventions across all unintentional injury types, with a focus\non the five most important causes of unintentional injury--road traffic injuries, drowning, burns,\nfalls, and poisoning--and includes seven recommendations for action. This analysis presents the U.S.\nburden for these main causes.\nOur study is subject to several limitations. First, it was not possible to examine injury deaths by\nstate and by year, because the low number of deaths in some states would have resulted the need to\nsuppress results to protect the privacy of decedents. Therefore, we used the most recent seven-year\ndata window to show some state differences. Examining deaths at the county-level, which could\nbetter inform local decisions on prevention, would pose similar challenges. Second, some death rates\npresented in this paper are considered unstable because based on a small number of deaths. Third,\nNEISS-AIP data only include individuals who are seen in an emergency department, so injuries treated\nin doctors' office, in urgent care centers, or left untreated are not included. For example, many young\npeople are victims of violence, but are not treated in emergency departments. Injury is one aspect\nof the burden of violence, but it is important to remember that many incidents of violence, such as\nbullying, neglect, and dating violence or sexual abuse may not result in physical injuries, but can\nhave significant and lasting negative consequences for victims. Fourth, NEISS-AIP is designed to\ngive only national estimates, so state-level analyses were not possible. Fourth, information on race\nand ethnicity are not collected consistently in the NEISS-AIP because data are from medical records\nfrom emergency departments. Fifth, we did not present national estimates using the NEISS-AIP by\ninjury cause, intent, and single year of age, because most of these rates were unstable due to small case\ncounts. Lastly, the data used here may underreport races other than white and black, and underreport\nHispanic origin [33].\n5. Conclusions\nAlmost 13,000 children and adolescents died in 2015 from unintentional or violence-related injury.\nviolence, an indication that childhood injury prevention efforts are succeeding; however, the rising\ndeath rates among certain age groups, races, and in specific geographical locations for unintentional\ninjuries, homicide, and suicide is a concern.\nOur results indicate that, in an effort to reduce violence and unintentional injuries to children, it is\nimportant to consider cause, intent, age, gender, race, and regional factors to assure that prevention\nresources are directed to those at greatest risk. Prevention opportunities extend beyond addressing\nindividual risk behaviors to include programs, policies, and strategies that enhance protective factors\nwithin the family, schools, neighborhood, and community. The frequency, severity, and potential\nfor death and disability of these injuries together with the high success potential for prevention,\nmake injury prevention a key public health goal to improve child and adolescent health in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Michael F.
