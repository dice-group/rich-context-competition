In particular, mother\u00adfather relationship\naggression--that is, mothers' and fathers' hos-\ntile and controlling behavior toward each other,\nverbal aggression, physical aggression, or both\n(Cui, Durtschi, Donnellan, Lorenz, & Con-\nrelated to more parenting stress, defined as gen-\neral feelings of difficulty in the parenting role\n(Levendosky, Leahy, Bogat, Davidson, & von\nRenner, 2009; Taylor, Lee, Guterman, & Rice,\n2010), and more ineffective parenting practices,\nsuch as less engagement with children, more\nlax control, and greater harshness toward chil-\nRitchie & Holden, 1998; Taylor, Guterman, Lee,\nDespite a large volume of studies examining\nthe association between relationship aggres-\nsion and parenting, three limitations cloud\nthe understanding of this association. First,\ninadequate attention has been paid to possible\nselection effects. That is, characteristics that\nselect parents into relationship aggression--for\nexample, mothers' and fathers' sociodemo-\ngraphic or personality characteristics--can also\nshape parenting stress and practices. Without\neliminating such unobserved characteristics that\nare related to both relationship aggression and\nparenting stress and practices, prior research\n162 Journal of Marriage and Family\nmight have overestimated the degree to which\nmother\u00adfather relationship aggression per se is\nrelated to parenting stress and practices. Sec-\nond, recent studies largely focused on fathers'\naggression and its consequences for mothers'\nparenting stress and practices (e.g., Gustafs-\nson & Cox, 2012). This focus on the male\nperpetration\u00adfemale victimization pattern over-\nlooks the findings from survey-based studies that\nwomen are as likely as men to be perpetrators\nof relationship aggression (Johnson, Giordano,\nManning, & Longmore, 2015) and that close to\nhalf of relationship aggression involves mutual\naggression where both partners are perpetrators\n(Renner & Whitney, 2010). A third related lim-\nitation is that gender differences in these asso-\nciations remain unclear. Because the dynamics\nin relationships among different-sex couples\ncontinue to be gendered (Anderson, 2010; Eng-\nland, 2010), it is possible that consequences of\nrelationship aggression for parenting stress and\npractices may differ for women and men.\nIn this article, we address these limitations\nusing longitudinal data of married or cohabit-\ning mothers and fathers from Waves 3 and 4\nin the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing\nStudy (FFCWS). To eliminate the influences of\nunobserved between-person selection factors,\nwe used fixed effects models, which control\nfor unmeasured time-invariant characteristics\nand estimate within-person differences (Allison,\n2009). We examined the associations between\nmothers' and fathers' frequency of relation-\nship aggression and three aspects of parenting\nof mothers and fathers, including parenting\nstress, frequency of engagement with children,\nand frequency of spanking. In addition, we\nassessed perpetration\u00advictimization type--\nmutual, mother-only aggression, father-only\naggression, and no aggression--to better under-\nstand whose aggression matters for whose\nparenting. The findings of the present analysis\ncontribute to the literature by investigating\nmen's and women's aggression, as well as\nmutual aggression, and by examining their links\nto parenting stress and practices.\nPrior Research\nFamily systems theory (Cox & Paley, 1997)\nposits that mother\u00adfather relationships and\nparent\u00adchild relationships are interdependent.\nUsing this broader framework, family scholars\nhave examined the link between mother\u00adfather\nrelationship aggression and parenting stress\nand practices (Cummings & Watson O'Reilly,\nBuehler, 2000). Recently, research has focused\nspecifically on intimate partner violence (IPV)\nand its consequences for victims' parenting\nstress and practices (e.g., Postmus, Huang, &\nMathisen-Stylianous, 2012; Taylor, Guterman,\nLee, & Rathouz, 2009). Both lines of research\nhave conceptualized the association into two\ncontrasting hypotheses. The first perspective\nis the spillover perspective, which posits that\nhigher levels of relationship aggression lead\nto more parenting stress and poorer parenting\npractices (Erel & Burman, 1995). Negativity,\nhostility, or frustration in the mother\u00adfather\nrelationship may be carried over into mothers'\nand fathers' mood and interactions with their\nchildren (Holden & Ritchie, 1991; Murray,\nBair-Merritt, Roche, & Cheng, 2012; Palazzolo,\net al., 2010). The second perspective is the\ncompensatory perspective, which contends that\nmother\u00adfather relationship aggression could\nresult in less parenting stress and better parent-\ning practices such as more engagement and less\nharshness. Parents whose intimate partnerships\nare hostile and antagonistic may try to invest\nmore in their relationships with children to\nobtain affection and warmth (Brody, Pillegrini,\nEmpirical studies generally have supported\nthe spillover perspective, showing a positive\nassociation between relationship aggression and\nparenting stress or ineffective parenting (for\nreviews and meta-analyses, see Erel & Burman,\na few studies found support for the compen-\nsatory perspective. Using a small sample of\nracially diverse mothers with preschool chil-\ndren, Levendosky, Huth-Bocks, Shapiro, and\nSemel (2003) found that IPV victimization was\npositively related to mothers' warm, responsive\nparenting practices. DeVoe and Smith's (2002)\nqualitative study of mothers who had been in an\nabusive relationship reported that some mothers\nconsciously avoid using physical punishment to\nteach their children not to use physical force.\nFurthermore, other studies showed that the link\nmay depend on the aspect of parenting. Lev-\nthat IPV victimization was negatively related to\nmothers' warmth toward children, but was not\nrelated to their discipline of their children.\n  163\nThree Limitations in Prior Research\nIn this article, we address three limitations in\nprior research to advance our understanding\nof the link between mother\u00adfather relationship\naggression and parenting. First, more attention\nshould be paid to a third perspective, which\nwe call the selection perspective. Theoretical\nperspectives that emphasize contextual influ-\nences on marriage and parenting (e.g., Conger,\nGe, Elder, Lorenz, & Simons, 1994; Simons\net al., 2002) suggest that mothers' and fathers'\nexperiences in marital and parenting domains\nare largely shaped by social and life contexts\nin which they are embedded. Indeed, prior\nresearch has shown that there are a number\nof characteristics that are related to both rela-\ntionship aggression and parenting experience\n(Slep & O'Leary, 2001). These include par-\nents' demographic and socioeconomic (SES)\ncharacteristics, such as poverty, unemployment,\nincarceration, and relationship status (Anderson,\ncharacteristics, such as the number of children\nand child health (Caetano, Cunradi, Schafer\nand parents' personality characteristics, such\nas antisocial personality, poor interpersonal\nskills, or unrealistic expectations for others'\nbehaviors (Simmons, Lehmann, & Dia, 2010).\nAfter these selection factors are controlled\nfor, there may be little association between\nrelationship aggression and parenting stress or\npractices.\nAlthough some studies have controlled for\nthese background characteristics, it is impossible\nto measure and control for all the variables that\nare related to both relationship aggression and\nparenting outcomes in random-effects models,\nwhich are standard regression models typically\nused in prior research. In random-effects mod-\nels, unobserved (i.e., uncontrolled) variables are\nregarded as random variables that are not cor-\nrelated with the observed variables. We suspect\nthat may not be the case in the present analysis,\nas we just explained. Fixed effects models are\nuseful to eliminate unmeasured time-invariant\ndifferences between those who are involved\nin relationship aggression and those who are\nnot, such as parents' and children's sociodemo-\ngraphic and personality characteristics, although\nthey do not control for unobserved time-varying\nfactors and do not establish a causal direction\n(Allison, 2009). Fixed effects models require\nlongitudinal data to examine how difference\nscores in relationship aggression correspond to\ndifference scores in parenting stress and prac-\ntices over two or more assessment periods. Much\nof the prior research has relied on cross-sectional\ndata. Even recent studies that used longitudi-\nnal data did not control for parenting stress\nor practices in an earlier time period (Gewirtz,\nPostmus et al., 2012). For example, Huang et al.\n(2010), using FFCWS, examined relationship\naggression at Wave 2 and parenting practices at\nined the associations between changes in IPV\nfrom Wave 2 to Wave 3 and parenting stress\nand practices in Wave 4, not changes in parent-\ning stress and practices. These research designs\ndo not address potential selection processes. To\neliminate possible selection biases, the present\nanalysis used fixed effects models.\nSecond, recent studies have largely focused\non the association between fathers' relationship\naggression and mothers' parenting stress and\npractices (Gustafsson & Cox, 2012; Huang\n2009). Three other possible combinations of\nthe association--that is, mothers' aggression\nand fathers' parenting, mothers' aggression and\nmothers' parenting, and fathers' aggression and\nfathers' parenting--have been rarely examined.\nGiven that women are as likely as men to use\nverbal and physical aggression toward their\nintimate partner (Johnson et al., 2015) and\nfathers' parenting is related to child outcomes\n(Pleck & Masciadrelli, 2004), it is important\nto examine how mothers' aggression relates to\nfathers' parenting. In addition, although prior\nwork largely focused on victims' parenting, it is\npossible that aggressive mood and behavior of\nperpetrators may spill over into the perpetrators'\nown parenting stress and practices. Some earlier\nstudies examined both mothers' and fathers'\nperpetration of relationship aggression and its\nlink to mothers' as well as fathers' parenting.\nFor example, Holden and Ritchie (1991) found\nthat fathers' relationship aggression was pos-\nitively related to their irritability toward their\nchildren. Fathers' irritability toward children\nwas, however, measured using the mothers'\nreport, instead of the fathers' own reports.\nThe current study examined how mothers' and\n164 Journal of Marriage and Family\nfathers' relationship aggression are related to\ntheir own as well as their partner's parenting\nstress and practices. Furthermore, using data\nfrom the National Survey of Adolescent Health,\nRenner and Whitney (2010) found that about\nhalf of those reporting relationship aggression\nreported mutual aggression. Thus, in addition to\nthe frequency of mothers' and fathers' perpetra-\ntion of aggression, we also used a four-category\nmeasure of perpetration\u00advictimization type--no\naggression, mutual aggression, mother-only\nperpetration, father-only perpetration--to better\nunderstand the role of relationship aggres-\nsion perpetration and victimization in shaping\nparenting stress and practices.\nThird, related to the second limitation, gender\ndifferences in the consequences of relationship\naggression for parenting are unclear (Ander-\nson, 2002). Prior research provides two contrast-\ning predictions. One is the gendered parenting\nperspective. Research has shown that mothers\noften play the primary role in parenting, whereas\nfathers tend to be mothers' helpers (Fox, 2009).\nThus, fathers' participation in parenting tends\nto be affected by mothers' encouragement or\ngatekeeping (Fagan & Barnett, 2003). This idea\nsuggests that men's parenting is more vulner-\nable to relationship aggression enacted by the\nmother of their children (Erel & Burman, 1995).\nIn contrast, the gendered intimate relationship\nperspective contends that women are more likely\nthan men to pay attention to the well-being of\ntheir romantic relationship and are more likely\nto be distressed by poor relationship quality\n(Kessler & McLeod, 1984). This idea suggests\nthat mothers' parenting may be more affected\nthan fathers' parenting by relationship aggres-\nsion. Empirical findings, mostly from earlier\nstudies, are inconsistent. Erel and Burman's\n(1995) meta-analysis reported that there was lit-\ntle gender difference in the magnitude of the\nassociation between relationship quality and par-\nenting. In contrast, Krishnakumar and Buehler\n(2000), also using a meta-analysis, reported that\nfathers' parenting is more strongly influenced\nby the quality of the mother\u00adfather relation-\nship than mothers' parenting. Past research is\nlimited in that most studies relied on one per-\nson's report, usually the mother's. The present\nanalysis examines gender differences in the link\nbetween relationship aggression and parenting\nstress and practices using reports from both\nparents.\nThe Present Study\nThis study examined how mothers' and fathers'\nrelationship aggression was related to their own\nand their partner's parenting using a sample of\nmarried or cohabiting couples drawn from the\nFFCWS. Of the various aspects of parenting,\nwe focused on parenting stress, frequency of\nengagement in activities with children, and\nfrequency of spanking children, indicators that\nwere commonly used in prior research (Gustafs-\nparenting stress and parenting practices as\nseparate outcomes because some research has\nshown that parenting stress has a direct effect\non children's behaviors (Huth-Bocks & Hughes,\nTaylor et al., 2009), although others suggest that\nparenting stress could be a mediator (Postmus\nOn the basis of the selection perspective,\nwe expected that the association between rela-\ntionship aggression and parenting stress and\npractices observed in prior research--mostly\nfocused on fathers' aggression and mothers'\nparenting--were in part because of background\ncharacteristics that were related to both rela-\ntionship aggression and parenting stress and\npractices, and thus the association would be\nless pronounced or would not be found in the\nfixed effects models. Alternatively, on the basis\nof the spillover perspective, we expected that\nrelationship aggression would be positively\nrelated to parenting stress, negatively related\nto engagement with children, and positively\nrelated to spanking frequency for both moth-\ners and fathers and for both perpetrators and\nvictims, even after controlling for background\ncharacteristics. To explore possible differ-\nences between perpetration and victimization\nin its link to parenting, we used a measure of\nperpetration\u00advictimization type in addition to a\nmeasure of frequency of relationship aggression.\nWe did not state particular hypotheses regarding\ndifferences across mutual, perpetration-only,\nand victimization-only aggression in its associ-\nation with parenting stress and practices. With\nregard to gender differences, we discussed two\ncontrasting hypotheses. First, on the basis of the\ngendered parenting perspective, we expected\nthat the association between relationship aggres-\nsion and parenting would be stronger for fathers\nthan mothers. Second, on the basis of the gen-\ndered intimate relationship perspective, we\n  165\nexpected that the association would be stronger\nfor mothers than fathers.\nMultivariate analyses controlled for fathers'\nand mothers' time-varying characteristics\nthat prior research has suggested are related\nto parenting and parenting stress as well\nas relationship aggression. These included\nemployment characteristics such as moth-\ners' and fathers' unemployment, work hours,\nnonstandard work schedules, and multiple\njobs (e.g., Conger et al., 1994; Nomaguchi &\nJohnson, 2016), fathers' incarceration history\n(Turney & Wildeman, 2013), and family charac-\nteristics such as the number of children, marital\nversus cohabitation status, family income, and\nNomaguchi & Brown, 2011; Postmus et al.,\nMethod\nData\nData for the present analysis were drawn from\nWaves 3 and 4 of the FFCWS (http://www\n.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/). The FFCWS\nis a stratified, multistage, probability sample\n(Reichman, Teitler, Garfinkel, & McLanahan,\n2001). The baseline interviews were conducted\nin the hospital soon after the child's birth (W1).\nand Wave 5 (W5) interviews were conducted\nby telephone when the child was 1, 3, 5, and\n9 years old, respectively. We focused on data\nfrom W3 and W4, because W1 did not include\nany questions on relationship aggression, W2\ndid not include questions asking fathers about\nmothers' physical aggression, and W5 did not\nask all parents about parenting stress and had\nquestion items different from previous waves\nto measure parental engagement with children.\nWe used national weights, which made the\ndata collected from the 16 randomly selected\ncities representative of births that occurred in\nthe 77 U.S. cities with populations of more\nChild Wellbeing Study, 2008; e.g., Lundberg,\nMcLanahan, & Rose, 2007). For the present\nanalysis, we first selected cases where the focal\nchild's mother and father both participated in\nlimited the sample to those coresiding (cohab-\niting or married) in both waves (n = 973). The\nW3 and W4 data were pooled into one data set\n(N = 1,946 observations). Missing cases were\nimputed using multiple imputations in SAS with\nfive iterations (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC;\nThe average age for fathers at the birth of\nthe focal child in the sample was 31.3 years\n(Appendix Table A1). Fathers' racial or ethnic\n9.1% of couples were interracial or intereth-\nnic. Of the fathers, 17% did not complete a\nhigh school degree, 19.2% had a high school\ndiploma, 34.1% had some college education, and\n29.4% had a bachelor's degree or more. We com-\npared means for demographic and SES variables\nbetween those who were retained in the sample\nand those who were dropped. White mothers and\nfathers were more likely to be retained at W3, as\nwere those with higher education and those who\nreported being married at W1. We also compared\nmean scores of relationship aggression at W2\nbetween those who were included in the sample\nand those who were dropped. The mean scores\nwere slightly higher for those who dropped out\nof the sample. Thus, mothers and fathers in\nthe analytical sample were more advantaged in\nsociodemographic characteristics and less likely\nto be involved in relationship aggression than\nthose in urban areas in the general population.\nMeasures\nThree aspects of parenting were examined.\nFathers' and mothers' parenting stress was mea-\nsured as the average of four questions ( = .63\nW3 and W4 for mothers), (a) \"Being a parent\nis harder than I thought it would be,\" (b) \"I\nfeel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent,\"\n(c) \"I find that taking care of my child(ren) is\nmuch more work than pleasure,\" (d) \"I often\nfeel tired, worn out, exhausted from raising a\nfamily\" (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree,\n3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree). These four items\nwere derived from the JOBS Child Outcome\nSurvey conducted by Child Trends and Abidin's\nParent Stress Inventory (Abidin, 1995; Hofferth,\nDavis-Kean, Davis, & Finkelstein, 1997). Our\nalpha reliability coefficients were comparable\nwith those obtained by Abidin (1995) and\nFathers' and mothers' engagement with chil-\ndren (W3 and W4) was measured as the average\n166 Journal of Marriage and Family\nof four questions ( = .84 in both W3 and W4\nfor mothers) that asked fathers and mothers\nhow many days a week they would (a) \"sing\nsongs or nursery rhymes,\" (b) \"read stories,\"\n(c) \"tell stories,\" or (d) \"play inside with the\nchild.\" Responses ranged from 0 to 7 days per\nweek. Fathers and mothers who did not see the\nchild in the past month were coded as 0. This\nmeasure has been used in other studies (Carl-\nson, McLanahan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2008; Ryan,\nFathers' and mothers' frequency of spanking\nwas measured using two questions. Fathers and\nmothers were asked whether they spanked their\nchild in the previous month because their child\nwas misbehaving or acting up. If they answered\n\"yes,\" they were asked how often they spanked\ntheir child. A measure of frequency of spank-\ning was created for fathers and mothers, respec-\ntively, where 0 = none, 1 = only once or twice,\n2 = a few times in this past month, 3 = a few times\na week, and 4 = every day or nearly every day.\nBecause very few parents reported \"every day,\"\nwe combined them with \"a few times a week,\"\nresulting in a scale that ranged from 0 to 3.\nRelationship aggression was assessed by\ntwo measures: frequency and perpetration\u00ad\nvictimization type. Fathers' and mothers' fre-\nquency of relationship aggression (W3 and\nW4) was measured as a mean scale of seven\nquestions that were reported by the other parent\nin W3 and .71 in W4 for mothers): (a) \"S/he\ninsults or criticizes you or your ideas\"; (b) \"S/he\ntries to keep you from seeing or talking with\nyour friends or family\"; (c) \"S/he tries to prevent\nyou from going to work or school\"; (d) \"S/he\nwithholds money, makes you ask for money,\nor takes your money\"; (e) \"S/he slaps or kicks\nyou\"; (f) \"S/he hits you with a fist or an object\nthat could hurt you\"; and (g) \"S/he tries to make\nyou have sex or do sexual things you don't want\nto do\" (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often).\nPast research has used the same items in the\nFFCWS to measure relationship aggression or\nIPV (e.g., Postmus et al., 2012; Taylor et al.,\nwas measured as four dummy variables created\nby using fathers' and mothers' frequency of\nrelationship aggression scales: no aggression\n(couples in which both the father's and the\nmother's frequency of relationship aggression\nscales were 1), father-only aggression (couples\nin which the father's frequency of relationship\naggression scale was greater than 1 and the\nmother's frequency of relationship aggression\nscale was 1), mother-only aggression (couples\nin which the father's frequency of relationship\naggression scale was 1 and the mother's fre-\nquency of relationship aggression scale was\ngreater than 1), and mutual aggression (cou-\nples where both the father's and the mother's\nfrequency of relationship aggression scales\nwere greater than 1). In supplemental analyses,\nwe examined measures of relationship aggres-\nsion excluding physical aggression as well as\nthose including physical aggression only (i.e.,\nquestions e, f, g in the previous list) to assess\nwhether the association between relationship\naggression and parenting stress and practices\nvaried by intensity of relationship aggression.\nThe patterns of the findings were substantively\nsimilar to those using the measures that included\nall items.\nSeveral control variables, all of which were\nmeasured as time-varying variables, were\nincluded. Fathers' and mothers' employment\nstatus (W3 and W4) was measured as dummy\nvariables, including not employed, employed\npart-time (<35 hours per week), and employed\nfull-time (35 hours per week and more; refer-\nence). Fathers' and mothers' nonstandard work\nschedule (W3 and W4) was a dichotomous\nvariable where parents who reported being\nemployed were asked whether they worked\nevenings, nights, rotating shifts, or weekends\n(1 = yes, 0 = no). Fathers' and mothers' multiple\njob holding (W3 and W4) was a dichotomous\nvariable where parents who reported working\nmore than one job at a time during the past\n12 months were coded as 1 and 0 otherwise.\nThe income-to-poverty ratio (W3 and W4)\nwas a FFCWS-constructed variable using the\nfather's report. Father's incarceration history\n(W3 and W4) was a dichotomous variable\nin which couples where the father had been\nincarcerated were assigned 1, and others were\nassigned 0. Cohabitation (W3 and W4) was a\ndummy variable in which couples who were\ncohabiting were assigned 1, and those who\nwere married were assigned 0. The number of\nchildren younger than age 18 in the household\n(W3 and W4) was measured using the mother's\nreport as a continuous variable. Child's health\n(W3 and W4) was an ordered variable ranging\nfrom 1 = poor to 5 = excellent as reported by\nmothers.\n  167\nAnalytical Plan\nTo examine the association between relationship\naggression and parenting stress and practices,\nwe used the pooled data set to estimate fixed\neffects regression models (Allison, 2009; John-\nson, 1995). A random-effects model, which is\na standard regression model typically used in\nprior research, examines variations across indi-\nviduals in the sample. In contrast, a fixed effects\nmodel focuses on the within-person variation\nwhile controlling for time-invariant unmeasured\ncharacteristics--that is, selection factors--that\nare related to both relationship aggression and\nparenting outcomes (Allison, 2009). We tested\nthe serial correlation of errors for the same case\nacross different times, a necessary condition for\nfixed effects models (Wooldridge, 2002). The\ncorrelations were significant at p < .001 levels\nfor all models (data not shown). This means that\nthere were unobserved differences that distin-\nguished between those who were involved in\nrelationship aggression and those who were not.\nIn addition, we used Hausman tests to determine\nwhether the estimates for all combinations of the\nassociations between mothers' and fathers' rela-\ntionship aggression and mothers' and fathers'\nparenting stress or practices in random versus\nfixed effects were significantly different (Alli-\nson, 2009). The Hausman tests of differences\nin the coefficients between random-effects and\nfixed effects models were significant for all mod-\nels (data not shown). Collectively, these results\nsupport the selection hypothesis and the need for\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for vari-\nables in the analyses. The mean for frequency\nof relationship aggression was 1.13 for moth-\nreported no relationship aggression, whereas\n27% reported mutual aggression, 26% reported\nmother-only aggression, and 15% reported\nfather-only aggression. Consistent with findings\nof studies using survey-based studies (e.g., Ren-\nner & Whitney, 2010), mothers were as likely as\nfathers, or even more likely than fathers, to be\nperpetrators of relationship aggression.\nThe first aspect of parenting we examined\nwas parenting stress. Table 2 shows the results\nfrom fixed effects models for the associa-\ntions between fathers' or mothers' relationship\nTable 1.

Models 1 and 2 used fathers'\nand mothers' frequencies of relationship aggres-\nsion. The correlation between fathers' and\nmothers' relationship aggression was modest\nand mothers' relationship aggression in the\nsame models. Model 1 included fathers' and\nmothers' relationship aggression frequencies\nonly, whereas Model 2 included the control\nvariables (i.e., time-varying demographic, SES,\nand child characteristics).

Mothers'\nfrequency of relationship aggression was also\nnot related to mothers' parenting stress with\nor without control variables. Models 3 and 4\nexamined whether the four types of relation-\nship aggression--that is, mutual, father-only,\nmother-only, and no aggression--were related\n  169\nto mothers' parenting stress without or with\ncontrol variables, respectively. Controlling\nfor background characteristics (Model 4),\nfather-only aggression and mutual aggression,\nbut not mother-only aggression, were positively\nrelated to mothers' parenting stress. We tested\ndifferences in the coefficient across the four\ntypes of relationship aggression by running the\nsame models but switching the reference group\n(data not shown). Differences in coefficients\nbetween mutual and father-only aggression\nwere not significant, whereas differences in\ncoefficients between mutual and mother-only\naggression as well as those between father-only\nand mother-only aggression were significant.\nAltogether, these results suggest that the pres-\nence of fathers' aggression, either father-only\nor mutual aggression, was positively related to\nmothers' parenting stress, whereas mother-only\naggression did not seem to be related to mothers'\nparenting stress.\nTurning to fathers' parenting stress, fathers'\nfrequency of relationship aggression was posi-\ntively related to fathers' parenting stress, albeit\nonly when demographic and SES characteristics\nwere controlled for (Model 2, in Table 2). A sup-\nplemental analysis (data not shown) indicated\nthat fathers' and mothers' employment status\nsuppressed the association between fathers'\naggression and fathers' parenting stress (e.g.,\nmothers' part-time job was positively related\nto fathers' aggression but negatively related to\nfathers' parenting stress). Models 3 and 4 show\nthat the presence of father-only aggression was\npositively related to fathers' parenting stress,\nwhereas mutual aggression was not related.\nInterestingly, the presence of mother-only\naggression was also positively related to fathers'\nparenting stress. Differences in coefficients\nacross mother-only, father-only, and mutual\naggression were not statistically significant.\nThe second aspect of parenting that was\nexamined in the present analysis was moth-\ners' and fathers' engagement with children\n(Table 3). Again, we examined mothers'\nengagement first. Neither fathers' nor mothers'\nfrequency of aggression were related to mothers'\nengagement with or without control variables\n(Models 1 and 2). Yet, when we used the four\nperpetration\u00advictimization types, we found that\nmother-only aggression was negatively related\nto mothers' engagement with children, whereas\nmutual or father-only aggression was not related\nafter controlling for background characteristics\n(Model 4). Differences in coefficients across\nthe three groups were not significant, however.\nTurning to fathers' engagement with children,\nfathers' relationship aggression was negatively\nrelated to their own engagement with children\nwithout control variables in the model (Model\n1). Yet, when demographic and SES charac-\nteristics were controlled for, the association\nwas no longer significant (Model 2). This\nwas because fathers' and mothers' employ-\nment status explained the association between\nfathers' aggression and fathers' engagement\nwith children (e.g., mothers' part-time job was\npositively related to fathers' aggression and\nnegatively related to fathers' engagement with\nchildren; fathers' unemployment was negatively\nrelated to fathers' aggression and positively\nrelated to fathers' engagement). Similar patterns\nwere found for mothers' aggression, which\nwas negatively related to fathers' engagement\nwith their children without control variables\n(Model 1), but the association disappeared\nwhen control variables were included in the\nmodels (Model 2). When we used the four\nperpetration\u00advictimization types, we found\nthat, after controlling for demographic and\nSES variables (Model 4), father-only or mutual\naggression was negatively related to fathers'\nengagement with children compared to no\naggression present. Differences in coefficients\nbetween mutual and father-only aggression were\nnot significant, whereas those between mutual\nor father-only aggression and mother-only\naggression were significant.\nThe third aspect of parenting that the present\nanalysis examined was frequency of spanking\n(Table 4). Fathers' frequency of relationship\naggression was not related to mothers' spank-\ning frequency (Models 1 and 2). This was\ninconsistent with findings in prior research\nUnexpectedly, mothers' frequency of rela-\ntionship aggression was negatively related to\nfrequency of spanking with or without control\nvariables. Note that the association was positive\nin zero-order correlations (r = .06, p < .01).\nBecause fixed effects models are equivalent\nto first-differences models when there are\ntwo waves, as in our case (Allison, 2009),\ncoefficients in fixed effects models indicate\nchanges in the frequency of spanking. Analyses\nusing the four perpetration\u00advictimization types\nshowed that mutual or mother-only aggression\nwas negatively related to mothers' spanking,\n170 Journal of Marriage and Family\nTable 3.

The negative association between\nmothers' aggression--mutual or alone--and\nmothers' spanking was inconsistent with the\nspillover hypothesis.

Differences in coefficients across mutual,\nmother-only, and father-only aggression were\nnot significant, however.\nTable 5 presents a summary of the findings\nfrom the fixed effects models. In the case of\nparenting stress, it appears that, for mothers, the\npresence of partners' aggression was related to\nmore parenting stress whether aggression was\nmutual or father only. In contrast, for fathers,\nrelationship aggression was related to more par-\nenting stress if the aggression was not mutual.\nThese results suggest gender differences in the\nassociation between relationship aggression and\nparenting stress. To test whether these gender\ndifferences were significant, we performed\nsupplemental analyses. For these supplemental\nanalyses, we first transformed the couple-level\ndata into individual-level data. (Details about\nthis procedure are available on request.) To avoid\nintraclass correlation, we randomly selected one\npartner per couple. (Note that we repeated the\nanalyses using five different randomly selected\none partner per couple and found similar\nresults.) With the individual-level data, we con-\nducted fixed-effect regression models that were\nsimilar to those presented in Tables 2 to 4 except\nthat they included interaction terms between\ngender and each of the four dummy variables of\nperpetration\u00advictimization types (Gender \u00d7 No\naggression was omitted as the reference group).\nThe results showed that gender differences in the\npatterns of the association between relationship\naggression and parenting stress found in Table 3\nwere statistically significant (Appendix Table\nA2). For engagement with children, mothers\nand fathers showed similar patterns: Their own\nperpetration--for fathers, including mutual\naggression--was negatively related to their own\nengagement with children. Supplemental anal-\nyses, similar to those that were conducted for\nparenting stress, suggest that gender differences\nwere not statistically significant. For spanking,\nmothers' aggression was negatively related to\nmothers' spanking and positively related to\nfathers' spanking. Gender differences in these\npatterns were statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nThe link between relationship aggression and\nparenting has long been of interest to fam-\nily scholars. Findings of the present analyses\nstimulate future research in this area in several\nways. First, we used fixed effects models to\neliminate selection factors--the role of pre-\nexisting differences between those who are\ninvolved in relationship aggression and those\nwho are not in shaping differences in parenting\nstress and practices between the two groups.\nSecond, in addition to the association between\nfathers' aggression and mothers' parenting, we\nexamined the association between mothers'\naggression and fathers' parenting, a neglected\nbut important question. We also examined the\n  173\nassociations between fathers' and mothers' rela-\ntionship aggression and their own (i.e., perpetra-\ntors') parenting stress and practices, which have\nbeen rarely investigated in recent studies. By\nusing a measure of perpetration\u00advictimization\ntype, which distinguishes mutual aggression\nfrom mother-only or father-only aggression, in\naddition to a measure of frequency of aggres-\nsion, we were able to better illustrate the patterns\nof association between relationship aggression\nand parenting. Finally, we found both gender\nsimilarities and differences. Next we discuss our\nkey findings in more detail.\nWith regard to the association between\nfathers' relationship aggression and moth-\ners' parenting, our findings from fixed effects\nregression models show that fathers' rela-\ntionship aggression is related to mothers'\nparenting stress. These findings support the\nprior research findings that showed that rela-\ntionship aggression victimization is related to\nmore parenting stress among mothers (e.g.,\n2009). For mothers' parenting practices, how-\never, we found that fathers' aggression was\nnot related to mothers' engagement with their\nchildren or their spanking frequency, which is\ninconsistent with prior research (e.g., Postmus\net al., 2012). These findings suggest a possible\nmerit of using fixed effects models to eliminate\nthe influences of background characteristics\nthat are related to both fathers' aggression\nperpetration and mothers' parenting practices.\nResearchers have emphasized the co-occurrence\nof relationship aggression and poorer parenting\npractices (e.g., Taylor et al., 2009). As Slep and\nO'Leary (2001) noted, it is critical to identify\nbackground characteristics that contribute to\nboth forms of parents' behaviors--that is, rela-\ntionship aggression and poor parenting--that\nmay be harmful to their children's well-being.\nWith regard to mothers' aggression, our find-\nings show that, as found in prior research using\nsurvey-based studies, mothers were as likely as,\nor even more likely than, fathers to be a per-\npetrator of relationship aggression. We found\nthat mothers' aggression is positively related to\nfathers' parenting stress and fathers' frequency\nof spanking when fathers are victims only (i.e.,\nwhen fathers are not aggressors as well). These\npatterns of findings support the idea that a part-\nner's relationship aggression is related to the\nvictim's parenting stress and harsh parenting\nAlthough prior research tends to focus on moth-\ners, our findings suggest that this idea may apply\nfor fathers as well. Future research is needed\nto investigate the process through which moth-\ners' relationship aggression is linked to fathers'\nincreased spanking frequency.\nOur findings underscore the importance of\nexamining perpetrators' parenting. We found\nthat fathers' aggression is related to fathers'\nown parenting stress and engagement, although\nnot spanking frequency. It could be that, per\nthe spillover hypothesis, fathers carry over their\nnegative mood toward mothers into their mood\nin their parenting role and are withdrawn from\ninteractions with their children. Several other\nexplanations are possible. The association could\nbe mediated by maternal gatekeeping--mothers\nmay try to shield their children from harsh, con-\ntrolling fathers (Levendosky et al., 2003), which\nmakes it more difficult for fathers to partici-\npate in parenting, a factor that is related to more\nparenting stress (Nomaguchi & Johnson, 2016).\nIt could be that her partner's increased anger\ntoward her might have led a mother to discourage\nher children from spending time with him. Alter-\nnatively, it is possible that the causal direction\nis opposite: Fathers' parenting stress spills over\ninto their interaction with their spouse. Because\nour analysis does not allow us to determine the\ncausal direction, we are unable to make a conclu-\nsion among these possible interpretations of the\nfinding.\nSimilarly, we found that mothers' aggression\nis negatively related to mothers' engagement\nand spanking frequencies. Less engagement\nwith children may mean a decline in attention\nto their children. Research has suggested that\nwomen's perpetration of relationship aggression\ntypically reflects their frustrated attempt to\ncontrol some issues in their marriage or part-\nnership, such as financial strain, infidelity, or\narguments over the division of labor (DeMaris,\nBenson, Fox, Hill, & Van Wyk, 2003). Mothers\nmay be preoccupied with the issues they face\nin their marriage or partnership, which may\ndistract them from parenting. With regard to\nlower spanking frequency, two different inter-\npretations are possible. First, this result could\nbe interpreted as supporting the compensatory\nhypothesis, which explains that mothers try\nto seek a warmer, close relationship in their\nparenting role when they are unable to have it\nin their marriage or romantic partnership. Alter-\nnatively, as shown in prior research (McLoyd &\n174 Journal of Marriage and Family\nis a primary tool of discipline, a decline in the\nfrequency of spanking could mean an increase\nin lax parenting. In the present sample, close\nto half of the mothers (46.2%) reported having\nspanked the focal child at least once during the\nprevious month. Frequency of spanking was\npositively, not negatively, related to engagement\nin the Pearson correlation test). These findings\nmay suggest that spanking could be a primary\nmethod of discipline among many parents in\nthe present sample. Thus, it may be possible to\ninterpret our findings that mothers provide their\nchildren with less discipline when they grow\nincreasingly harsh or more controlling of their\npartners. More research that examines the asso-\nciation between relationship quality and various\naspects of parenting practices is warranted.\nWe found both similarities and differences\nbetween mothers and fathers in the association\nbetween relationship aggression and parent-\ning. Mothers and fathers are similar in that\ntheir relationship aggression was related to\nless engagement with children. Mothers and\nfathers differ in the association between rela-\ntionship aggression and parenting stress or the\nfrequency of spanking. Specifically, mothers'\nparenting stress is more vulnerable to their part-\nners' aggression, including mutual aggression,\nwhereas fathers' parenting stress is more vul-\nnerable to their own or partners' but not mutual\naggression. Mothers' spanking is influenced by\ntheir own aggression, whereas fathers' spanking\nis influenced by their partners' aggression,\nincluding mutual aggression. Although we\nconsidered two alternative hypotheses, one pre-\ndicting that mothers' parenting would be more\naffected than fathers' parenting by relationship\naggression and the other predicting that fathers'\nparenting would be more affected, we find that\nboth mothers' and fathers' parenting is affected\nbut in different ways. Research on gender differ-\nences in implications of relationship aggression\nhas been inconclusive except that many\nresearchers agree that women are more vulnera-\nble to severe forms of IPV, including injury (e.g.,\nWarner, 2010). For example, some research has\nfound that consequences of relationship aggres-\nsion for mental health are greater for women\nthan for men (Anderson, 2002), whereas other\nresearch has shown that IPV is related to more\ndepression for both men and women (John-\nson, Giordano, Longmore, & Manning, 2014).\nMore research is needed to understand gender\ndifferences in the consequences of relationship\naggression for various aspects of outcomes.\nThe present analysis has limitations that\nfuture research should address. First, measures\nof parenting practices are limited. Inconsistency\nin discipline and monitoring, such as television\nor bedtime rules, may be better measures of\nparenting practices that could be affected by\nmother\u00adfather relationship aggression and have\ndirect influences on child outcomes (Krishnaku-\nmar & Buehler, 2000). Second, the reliability of\nthe independent variable, relationship aggres-\nsion, may be somewhat low, which could have\nresulted in biased coefficients (Wooldridge,\n2002), although it was equivalent to that used\nin prior research (e.g., Postmus et al., 2012).\nThird, as mentioned earlier, the present analysis\nshowed associations but did not permit us to\ndraw conclusions about the causal direction of\nthe association between relationship aggression\nand parenting. Finally, the FFCWS focused on\nan urban population, and it is possible results\ncould vary across suburban and rural locations.\nWe also focused on married or cohabiting cou-\nples who stayed together at least up to when the\nfocal child was 5 years old. Thus future research\nusing a nationally representative sample of U.S.\nparents is warranted.\nTo conclude, the present analysis suggests\nthat future research should make further efforts\nto eliminate background factors that are com-\npounded in the association between relationship\naggression and parenting. In addition, our study\nsuggests the importance of investigating the\ninfluences of relationship aggression perpe-\ntration on parenting stress and practices for\nboth mothers and fathers, separating mutual\naggression from perpetration-only aggression,\nand looking at perpetrators' as well as victims'\nparenting. Future research may benefit from\ncouple-level analyses that explore dyadic inter-\nactions that can facilitate or buffer the processes\nin which different perpetration\u00advictimization\ntypes lead to mothers' and fathers' parenting\nstress and practices.\nNote\nThis research is supported by the Center for Family and\nDemographic Research, Bowling Green State University,\nwhich has core funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-\nthis article was presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the\n  175\nAmerican Sociological Association in Chicago, Illinois.
