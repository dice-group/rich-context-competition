Yet, the\nprocesses through which this association occurs are still not well\nunderstood. This paper seeks to advance such understanding in\ntwo ways: (1) by attending to the distinction between the\nonset of health problems and their course or progression; (2) by\naddressing whether and how education and income\ndifferentially affect indicators of health.\nAlthough it is well known that characteristics such as age,\ngender, and socioeconomic status influence the probability of\nhaving functional disorders, surprisingly little attention has\nbeen paid to the degree to which these attributes relate to\nfunctional problems as process. This is due in part to the relative\nlack of panel data on representative population samples that\nspan sufficient years to allow for analyses of changes in cap-\nacity. Further, although education and income are both valued\nresources that are distributed differentially, and causally con-\nnected over the life course, rather than just being indicators of\na single underlying dimension of `status', each is distinctive,\nhaving unique causes and consequences as well as common\nones.\nEducation, income, and functional limitation\ntransitions among American adults:\ncontrasting onset and progression\nZachary Zimmer1 and James S House2\nBackground Although a robust association between socioeconomic status and health has been\nshown in past research, the processes that explain the connection are not well\nunderstood. This paper seeks to advance such understanding in two ways, first by\nattending to the distinction between onset of a functional health problem and its\nprogression, and second by addressing whether and how education and income\nrelate differently to the onset versus progression of functional health problems.\nMethods Data come from the Americans' Changing Lives survey (n = 3617). The baseline\nare categorized into none, mild, moderate, severe. Onset is defined as having no\nlimitation at origin and a limitation at outcome. Progression is defined as limitation\nof a particular severity at origin and improving, staying the same, or getting\nworse with respect to the severity. Multinomial regressions determine transition\nprobabilities related to onset and progression.\nResults Those with higher income and education are less likely to experience an onset.\nOnly income associates with progression. Those with the highest income are most\nlikely to improve and least likely to get worse in comparison to those with the\nlowest income.\nConclusions Education, being determined early in life and influencing psychosocial mech-\nanisms throughout life, may have a greater impact on prevention of activity and\nfunctional disorders. Income's role may be both as a prevention factor and as a\nmechanism for management of health problems.\nKeywords Social class, activities of daily living, limitation of activity, adults, ageing\n1 Policy Research Division, The Population Council, One Dag Hammarskjold\nPlaza, New York, NY 10017, USA.

This\nexpectation begins from the recognition that most health prob-\nlems of adulthood are chronic in both aetiology and course, and\nare the outcome of a long process of development as a function\nof exposure to a wide range of social, psychological, behavioural,\nand biomedical risk factors.25 Education indexes both the socio-\neconomic position of individuals early in adulthood and a stock\nof human capital available to them from that time on, both of\nwhich influence long-term patterns of exposure to and experience\nof major psychosocial and biomedical risk factors, including:\n(1) preventive and therapeutic medical care; (2) deleterious\nhealth behaviours such as smoking and lack of exercise;\n(3) chronic and acute stress; (4) lack of social relationships and\nsupports; (5) exposure to physical hazards in home, neighbour-\nhood, and work environment, such as pollution and dangerous\nwork conditions; and (6) psychological orientations or dis-\npositions inimical to health such as anger/hostility or lack of\nIn contrast, income, as usually measured in terms of the past\nyear, reflects socioeconomic position and resources closer to the\ntime of assessment of a health problem, thus being not only a\nmore proximate influence on the onset of a health problem but,\nalso a determinant of the course of that problem. That is, income\ninfluences not only the exposure to or experience of aetiological\nrisk factors for health, but also, and probably more strongly than\neducation, the resources available for the treatment or man-\nagement of disease or for modifying life circumstances to reduce\nthe factors (e.g. stress) producing or maintaining the disease.\nPast studies have shown both shared influences and notable\ndifferences in education and income influences on health.27,28\nNon-US evidence suggests that education more strongly relates\nto the existence of a functional health problem while income\nmore relates to the severity of the problem.29 Other research\nhas distinguished between prevention and management of a\nhealth disorder,30 and shown education to differentially predict\nincidence, recovery, severity, and mortality. Where onset and\nprogression have been examined, the focus has been on older\nadults,31\u00ad33 and these studies showed that most sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics influence both onset and progression, but\neducation influences onset only. These past studies are beginning\nto suggest that the psychosocial and biomedical mechanisms\nthrough which socioeconomic factors influence health could\ndiffer depending upon the stage of disorder. Mediating factors\nsuch as exercise and avoidance of risky behaviour may act upon\nprevention, while the availability of medical and rehabilitative\nprogrammes, which itself is differentially determined across\nsocioeconomic characteristics, may better relate to management\nafter an onset.\nPrior prospective analyses on the US national sample\nconsidered here have found that income is a stronger predictor\nof mortality than education, while education has little effect on\nmortality net of income.34 However, education is as strong or a\nstronger predictor of changes in health.7 This research has failed\nto carefully distinguish between the onset of health problems\namong those free of such problems, and the course among those\nwith such pre-existing problems. In the present study, we focus\non how education and income differentially associate with\nthe probability that a functionally healthy person at one point\nin time contracts a functional health problem over time, and\nthe probability that a person who has functional limitations\nimproves or gets worse over time. Specifically, using a sample of\nAmerican adults aged 25, we ask the question, is it the case\nthat education is more related to onset and income to progres-\nsion of functional limitation?\nMethods\nData\nChanging Lives survey (ACL), a longitudinal probability sample\ncontiguous US. Respondents were first interviewed in 1986,\n542 deaths, and 513 were lost to follow-up. Blacks and those\naged 60 were over-sampled, and weights are used to adjust for\nthis and non-response. More detail on the study can be found\nin several other publications resulting from these data.7,34\u00ad36\nMeasures\nActivity limitation is defined as an individual's reported belief\nthat their health hampers their ability to conduct basic daily\nactivities. The ACL study did not include a extensive battery of\nActivities of Daily Living37 and Instrumental Activities of Daily\nLiving.38 It did include individual items on ability walking,\nclimbing stairs, and getting in/out of a chair, and also asked,\n`(H)ow much are your daily activities limited in any way by\nyour health or health-related problems?' This study uses the\nlatter question, which may be thought of as a one-question\nsubstitute for a battery of items. Responses allowed were not at\nall, a little, some, quite a bit, and a great deal. A little and some\nare combined into one category called mild activity limitation.\nQuite a bit is considered as a moderate limitation and a great\ndeal is considered as severe level activity limitation.\nRespondents initially reported education as years of formal\nschooling. Although we tested for single years, and measured\ndiscretely in various schemes, we found the most parsimonious\nand useful coding to be a three-category measure, with categories\nfor less than high school, completed high school, and more than\nhigh school education. It should be noted that other coding\nschemes do not alter substantive findings. For income, a ques-\ntion asked respondents to list combined self and spouse yearly\nincome from all sources before taxes. Those not responding\nwere led through income brackets. This allows those not\nresponding to the open-ended question to be categorized into\nbroad groups. The remaining refusals were given income levels\nimputed on the basis of regression procedures including income\nin other waves of the ACL as predictors. A four-category income\nMultivariate models adjust for several covariates that are\nimportant determinants of health outcomes. These are age, sex\n(male or female) race (white, black and other), and marital status\n(married and unmarried). All covariates are measured at base-\nline. Table 1 provides the number of cases and per cent distribu-\ntion for the originating and outcome status, and all explanatory\nmeasures. For ease of presentation in this Table, age is cat-\negorized here into five categories, but is treated as a continuous\nvariable in multivariate models.\nConceptualization and modelling\nThe originating status is activity limitation measured in 1986\nand the outcome status is measured in 1994. Onset refers to\nhaving no limitation at origin and having a limitation of any\nseverity at outcome. Progression refers to the movement from a\nparticular severity of limitation at origin (mild, moderate, or\nsevere) to a particular status at outcome. Progression can refer\nto staying the same as well as changing status. A transition\nprobability is the probability that an individual with a particular\nlimitation status at origin has a particular outcome status. The\nsum of transition probabilities from any originating status is 1.0.\nThe aim of the analysis is to determine whether education and\nincome are associated with these activity limitation transition\nprobabilities.\nIt is understood that any one individual who reports no\nlimitations at origin and outcome may have experienced limita-\ntions during the inter-survey period. It is also understood that\nan individual who has a particular severity at origin may have\ngone through several different transitions over the inter-survey\nperiod. Although this is true, we can also assume that the\ncharacteristics that relate to onset and progression will relate to\nthe chance of experiencing limitations or limitations of a par-\nticular severity at any point in time. For instance, if older adults\nare more likely than are younger adults to have functional\nlimitations, then the probability that an individual who does not\nhave a limitation at origin will subsequently report a limitation\nat outcome will be related to age. In this way, we assume\nthat onset and progression, defined by using two stationary\npoints in time, relates to onset and progression measures using\ncontinuous time.\nIf onset and progression are a function of different sets of\ndeterminants, then transitions need to consider two discrete\ngroups. Those reporting no limitation at origin are within the\nfirst group. For this group, we monitor the probability of an\nonset. The second consists of those who report limitations at\ntime of origin. For these individuals we determine probabilities\nrelated to progression. We categorize progression as remaining\nthe same severity, improving, or getting worse.\nWe consider two additional transitions for each group. First,\nwe consider not surviving the inter-survey period. Second,\nwe consider not responding to the follow-up. About 13% of\nthe original sample were non-respondents at outcome and it is\npossible that they have different education, income, and other\ncharacteristics than those who do respond to the follow-up.\nThese additional two outcomes need to be considered in order\nto assure that our models are not biased due to selectivity.\nAlthough we are mostly interested in education and income,\nonset and progression are also considered to be a function of\nage, sex, marital status, and race. In addition, progression may\nbe a function of severity of limitations at time of origin. Grudy\nand Glaser27 for instance, showed that improvement in status is\nmore likely for those with higher levels of severity. Survival\nshould also be related to severity of activity limitation at origin.\nSince the outcomes for both onset and progression are non-\nordered categorical responses, we utilize multinomial logistic\nregression equations procedures to estimate probabilities. The\nmodel estimates a set of coefficients that correspond to each\npossible outcome category. For example, given four outcomes,\nthe probability of outcome 1 is:\nPr (Y = 1) = (exp x(1))/(exp x(1) + exp x(2) +\nexp x(3) + exp x(4))\nwhere x represent a vector of coefficients and set of charac-\nteristics. To identify this model, it is necessary to set one x = 0.\nThus, if x(1) = 0, the remaining coefficients measure the change\nin probability relative to x(1). Setting a different contrast\ncategory changes coefficients, but predicted probabilities for\ngroups remain the same. Unless the contrast category chosen is\nthe one of ultimate interest, it is often more intuitive to exam-\nine predicted probabilities with multinomial response categories\nthan coefficients estimated from the model. We examine both\ncoefficients and predicted probabilities.\nOur models presented below include both education and\nincome. Analyses entering education and income separately\ndiffer little from those shown below. All procedures were con-\nducted using the Stata Version 7.0 statistical software. Weight-\ning for multivariable procedures is conducted using sampling\nor `probability' weights, as they are called in Stata, meaning that\nTable 1 Descriptive information on study variables (weighted sample,\nNo. of cases Per cent\nOriginating status\nOutcome status\nExplanatory variables\nIncome\nAge (years)\nGender\nRace\nMarital status\nweights are treated as the inverse of the probability that the\nobservation is included due to the sampling design.39\nResults\nOriginating and outcome status\nTable 2 shows survival to be strongly dependent upon originating\nstatus. The proportion not surviving the inter-survey period is\nabout 5% for those originating without any activity limitation,\n16% for those with mild, 33% for those with moderate, and\n44% for those with severe limitation. In contrast, non-response\nvaries only modestly and non-monotonically by originating\nstatus, with a tendency for non-response to be highest among\nthose without limitations. This suggests that the selection in\nterms of non-response is not substantially determined by\nfunctioning.\nFor those who do survive, outcomes are dependent upon\noriginating status. About 58% of those without limitations at\ntime of origin are limitation free at outcome compared with 25%,\n9%, and 7% of those with mild, moderate, and severe limitations.\nThere is also a fair amount of movement in and out of states of\nlimitation and around levels of severity. Complete recovery is\nleast likely for those originating with severe limitation and most\nlikely for those originating with mild limitation, but the chance\nof some improvement is substantial for all.\nDeterminants of onset\nTable 3 presents the model predicting transition probabilities for\nthe group originating without limitations (n = 2556). Results\npresented are odds ratios (OR). Remaining without limitation\nis the contrast and outcomes of onset, not surviving, and not\nresponding, are viewed relative to remaining without. OR of\ngreater than 1.00 indicate a higher probability of an onset, dying,\nor not responding, while OR of less than 1.00 indicate a greater\nprobability of remaining without limitation. The 95% CI around\nthe OR are shown in parentheses.\nBoth education and income are significant determinants of\nonset. Those completing high school or with more than high\nschool education are less likely to experience an onset, and the\nsame can be said for those with higher levels of income. Education\nand income relate strongly to survival as well, with those with\nhigh school or more education and those with higher levels of\nincome being less likely to die relative to remaining without\nlimitations. (Further analyses not shown here suggest small but\ninsignificant additional gains after high school and US$40 000.)\nThose with higher education, and those with higher income, are\nTable 2 Outcome activity limitation status by originating status\nOriginating status\nOutcome status No limitations Mild limitations Moderate limitations Severe limitations\nActivity\nTable 3 Multinomial regression odds ratios (OR) for onset of functional limitations (95% CI in parentheses)\nHas an onset Does not survive Does not respond\nversus versus versus\nRemains without limitations Remains without limitations Remains without limitations\nLess than high school education \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nWhite (comparison) \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nless likely to respond to the follow-up relative to remaining with-\nout limitations. Associations with other covariates are generally\nas would be expected. For instance, higher age is associated\nwith a greater probability of having an onset and not surviving.\nDeterminants of progression\nTable 4 displays results for those originating with limitations.\nSince these are individuals who have limitation, staying the\nsame is not necessarily a favourable outcome, although it is\nmore favourable than getting worse. Improvement of status is\nthe comparison. OR greater than 1.00 indicate a higher prob-\nability of remaining the same, getting worse, not surviving, or\nnot responding. Ratios less than 1.00 indicate a higher prob-\nability of improving. Those beginning with severe limitations\ncannot get worse, and this coefficient is omitted (it is statistically\nzero). Again, 95% CI are shown in parentheses.\nThe principal difference between this model and the previous\none is that education generally ceases to be predictive with the\nonly significant coefficient indicating, contrary to expectations,\nthat people in the highest educational category are more likely\nto stay the same relative to improving. (We find this also in\nmodels considering education without income, therefore the\nresult is not a function of shared variance.) In contrast, those in\nthe highest income category, when compared with the lowest\ncategory, are less likely to stay the same relative to improve, and\nless likely to get worse relative to improve. In other words,\nthose in the highest income category are more likely to improve\nin status. Those in the highest two income brackets are less\nlikely to die relative to improving. The relationship between\neducation and survival is also not generally significant, though\nany relationship that does exist is in the opposite direction\nof expectations. As for the other covariates, it appears as if\nonly age continues to have a strong influence on transition\nprobabilities. Results also show strong associations with the\noriginating status. Those who originate with moderate or severe\nactivity limitations are more likely to improve than are those who\noriginate with mild limitations. For both Tables 3 and 4, inter-\nactions between education and income on the one hand and\nfunctional status at origin on the other were tested (results not\nshown) but they did not significantly improve the models.\nPredicted probabilities\nGiven that multinomial regression must, by definition, define a\ncontrast outcome, the direction and magnitude of relationships\nthat do not involve the contrast are difficult to determine just by\nlooking at the coefficients. Figure 1 presents a series of predicted\nprobability plots to clarify associations. The plots show transition\nprobabilities derived by using coefficients from the previous\nTable 4 Multinomial regressions odds ratios (OR) for progression of functional limitations (95% CI in parentheses)\nStays the same Gets worse Does not survive Does not respond\nversus versus versus versus\nImproves Improves Improves Improves\nFunctioning difficulties\nat start of period mild (comparison) \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nLess than high school education \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nWhite (comparison) \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nmodels. Non-response is omitted as an outcome, so the sum of\nprobabilities is not 1.0. The probabilities hold other variables\nconstant such that they are averages for the sample.\nFigure 1(a and b) shows probabilities associated with onset;\n(a) shows these probabilities for the three categories of edu-\ncation and (b) by the four income categories. Figure 1(a) shows\neducation to be strongly associated with onset of activity limita-\ntion. The probability that someone without a limitation at time\nof origin remains limitation free by outcome increases from\nabout 0.35 for those with without completed high school, to\nabout 0.45 for those completing high school, and then levels off\nfor those with more than high school education. At the same\ntime, the probability of having an onset decreases from about\n0.32 to about 0.25. The probability of dying remains fairly flat.\nThe probability of remaining without limitations also increases\nwith increasing income. The chances of dying decrease with\nincreasing income from about 0.20 for those in the lowest income\ncategory to about 0.08 for those in the highest.\nFigure 1(c and d) shows probabilities associated with\nprogression. We examine probabilities only for those originating\nwith moderate limitations, so `improves' means having an out-\ncome of no or mild limitations and `gets worse' means having\nan outcome of severe limitations. Associations between edu-\ncation and progression are flat. For instance, the probability of\nFigure 1 Estimated probabilities of selected transitions by education and income\nimproving is about 0.50 regardless of level of education. The\nprobability of improving, however, increases substantially with\nhighest income levels. There is also a decrease in the probability\nof not surviving by income.\nFurther tests\nIn order to further test the robustness of our findings, we\nconducted other procedures and sensitivity tests. Already men-\ntioned were tests for associations considering education and\nincome separately, tests for education measured continuously\nand using various categorizations, and various interactions. We\nnoted some additional beneficial effect of education on onset at\nthe very upper levels, for instance, among those with 17 years\nof formal schooling, although the additional benefit is generally\nnot significant. We also examined various measures of func-\ntional status using different survey items, and results did not\ndiffer substantially from those reported here.\nSince most `events', for instance deaths, will occur to those\nat older ages, we examined equations that stratified by age and\ninteractions of socioeconomic status by age. Also, because of\npotential differences in effects across gender, we examined our\nresults for men and women separately. At times these results\nare not very meaningful because of small cell sizes resulting\nfrom dividing the sample further, particularly when examining\nprogression, since fewer originate with limitations. Nonetheless,\nthe results are worth reporting since they not only serve to\naffix some additional perspective to the analyses but suggest\ndirection for further research. For the most part, results were\nconsistent across ages and sex. Interactions showed that income\neffects were a little less important as age increased, which makes\nsome sense since current income should be a less distinguishing\nindicator of status once people begin to retire. Education had\na somewhat greater influence on the chances of improving\nstatus among those originating with limitations at younger ages.\nAlthough this was not consistent across the transitions, it is a\nreasonable finding if it is assumed that limitations at younger\nages tend to be more acute and subject to fluctuation rather\nthan the chronic types of limitations that are more characteristic\nat older ages.\nFinally, disadvantages inherent in separating the sample\ninto smaller sizes include making estimates less stable and not\nallowing for determination of whether differences in effects are\nstatistically significant. We addressed this by pooling samples\nand examining equations that predicted outcomes (no limita-\ntions, mild, moderate, severe, did not survive, did not respond)\nusing interaction terms for education and income by originating\nstatus. The results are consistent with those shown above. There\nare significant interactions between education and originating\nstatus. These interaction effects serve to lessen the effect of\neducation on outcome status for those who originate with lim-\nitations. There are no significant interactions with income, suggest-\ning that income operates more consistently across originating\nstatuses.\nConclusion\nIn order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms\nthrough which socioeconomic status factors relate to health,\nthe current study examined transition models for onset and\nprogression of functional limitation. Education was strongly\nassociated with onset, while income was found to have asso-\nciations with both onset and progression. We conclude that\neducation and income have varying effects and that onset and\nprogression are a function of different sets of predictors. This is\ngenerally consistent with our expectations, suggesting the neces-\nsity of attending increasingly to the different ways in which\nsocioeconomic variables relate to health outcomes. Education,\nwhich is largely completed and fixed by early adulthood, exerts\na pervasive effect on trajectories of experience in early and\nmiddle adulthood, has strong effects on the onset of functional\nhealth problems (or the avoidance thereof), but little or no\neffect on the progression of such problems among those who\nalready manifest them at baseline. Income affects the onset of\nfunctional health problems, and equally affects the course of\nsuch problems, especially the chances of improvement and\navoidance of further decline.\nWe also saw that mortality is differentially influenced by edu-\ncation and income. Both appear to improve survival chances\namong those who originate healthy. Education has less influ-\nence among those who originate with limitations. This finding\nis in contrast to earlier studies that do not examine survival\nseparately among those originating in different states of health.\nIt may be that those with higher education are better able to\nward off health disorders that threaten survival. But, when\nproblems do arise to those with high levels of education, they\nmay be of equal or greater seriousness in comparison to the health\nproblems that arise for those with lower levels of education.\nSome of the current findings are consistent with the results\nof other recent studies, some of which also use the ACL data.\nLantz et al.34 find that income is better able to predict mortality,\nwhich is normally the outcome of the progression of disease. In\ncontrast, Lantz et al.7 find that education is as or more predictive\nthan income of changes in functional self-rated health, these\nchanges reflecting not only the course of existing health prob-\nlems but also the onset of new problems, with the present study\nisolating this onset. Education is more predictive of risky health\nbehaviours which contribute to onset of health problems with a\nlong latency (i.e. smoking, drinking, and eating patterns), while\nincome is more predictive of a health behaviour (physical\nexercise) with more immediate effects on health, even among\nthose with disease.34 Examining physical functioning among\nolder adults, Zimmer et al.24 in Taiwan, and Grundy and Glaser33\nin Britain, find education to be predictive of the incidence or\nonset of a functional problem among those beginning an obser-\nvation period in a healthy state, but not predictive of changes in\nfunction among those originating with problems. Together, these\nstudies are beginning to suggest the need to separate out socio-\neconomic influences according to specific stages of the disease\nand disability to further understand the processes involved.\nThere are limitations to the current study. First, loss to\nfollow-up tends to be a problem in most panel research. To the\nextent that the predictors operate the same way in the non-\nrespondent group as in the respondent group, modelling the\nloss to follow-up as a transition adjusted for some of this in the\ncurrent analysis. Those lost to follow-up tend to have higher\nlevels of education and income than respondents, and they are\nmore likely white and married (Tables 3 and 4). Individuals\nwith these types of characteristics tend to be in the function-\nally healthier group. If their transitions follow the patterns\nfound, then participation of those that were lost would have\nstrengthened significance of associations. However, there is also\nthe possibility that those lost are a unique group. Since we\ncannot be certain about their health transitions, loss to follow-\nup remains a limitation.\nSecond, our outcome measure of functional limitation is\nsomewhat limited, being based on responses from a single item.\nThe ACL questionnaire included other functional items, like\nability walking, climbing stairs, and getting out of a chair. We\nexamined these individually and together as an index, and\nthe results do not vary substantially from those reported herein.\nOther analyses of this data show that the single item measure\nwe used behaves similarly to other indices of self-assessed and\nchronic health conditions7,35 However, it would be informative\nif the current methodology were expanded to analyses of the\nonset and progression of other types of health problems, includ-\ning clinical measures of health.\nThird, the number of cases does not allow us to confidently\nstratify to assess whether associations are similar across age and\nsex groups. This is particularly true for the group that originates\nwith limitations. However, as noted above, initial indications\nare that there may be at least some moderate differences in\neffects for the younger versus older groups, while the effects of\nincome may be stronger for men than for women. We suggest\nfuture study would do well to examine interactions more\ncarefully.\nDespite these limitations, the results have implications for\nour understanding of functional health and socioeconomic\ndisparities therein, and for the potential application of such\nunderstanding. Education is an early life experience, but has\nimplications for later life health. We interpret our results to\nsuggest that education is associated with the prevention of func-\ntional health disorder. This works through better understanding\nof the nature of disease and how to avoid illness, for instance, a\nhistory of not smoking, healthy diet, and other factors that have\nlong-term impact on prevention. Hence, those with higher edu-\ncation will witness a delay or compression of morbidity. Income\nis also important with respect to prevention, likely for similar\nreasons, but income is even more important in terms of facil-\nitating improvement and recovery from problems once they\narise. We suggest that this may be a function of the greater\nability to treat and manage disease among those with higher\nincome. Higher current income, for instance, may allow indi-\nviduals to purchase quality health care and other amenities that\ncan assist in recovery. A reverse causal connection with income\nis also possible since those who become ill are more likely to\nreduce their employment as a result, leading to declining\nincome. Yet, the current study did examine effects of baseline\nincome on changes in health over time, enhancing the confid-\nence of the causal connection. Further research that uncovers\nthe distinct pathways through which education and income\ninfluence the onset and progression of health disorders would\nassist in further elucidating the distinct processes involved.\n"
