The second and third rounds of the survey\nincluded physicians sampled in the previous round, as well as new physicians.\nParticipants Primary care and specialist physicians who spent at least 20 hours per\nweek in direct patient care activities.\nMain Outcome Measures Changes in physicians' overall satisfaction with their\ncareer and the proportion of dissatisfied physicians in particular sites.\nResults Physician satisfaction levels declined marginally between 1997 and 2001, with\nmost of the decline occurring between 1997 and 1999. Among primary care physicians,\nand 41.4%, respectively, in 2001. There were nearly equal increases in those who re-\nported that they were somewhat satisfied. Overall means mask significant differences\nacross the 60 sites. Among 12 sites randomly selected for more intensive study, the pro-\nportion of respondents who were somewhat or very dissatisfied ranged from 8.8% of\nported improved satisfaction, while approximately equal percentages reported increased\nfor specialist physicians. In multivariable models, the strongest and most consistent pre-\ndictors of change in satisfaction were changes in measures of clinical autonomy, includ-\ning increases in hours worked and physicians' ability to obtain services for their patients.\nChanges in exposure to managed care were weakly related to changes in satisfaction.\nConclusions Our findings demonstrate that overall physician satisfaction levels over\nthis time period did not change dramatically. In addition, satisfaction and changes in\nsatisfaction vary greatly among sites. Rather than declining income, threats to physi-\ncians' autonomy, to their ability to manage their day-to-day patient interactions and\ntheir time, and to their ability to provide high-quality care are most strongly associ-\nated with changes in satisfaction.\noverall quality of care if potentially out-\nstanding physicians are dissuaded from\nchoosing this career.12 Finally, career\ndissatisfaction might be one manifes-\ntation of physicians' perceptions of\nproblems in delivering high-quality care\nto their patients.13\nTo examine trends in career satisfac-\ntion, we administered surveys 2 years\napart to a nationally representative\nsample of primary care physicians\n(PCPs) and specialist physicians drawn\nfrom local health care markets through-\nrepresentative sites include both large\nand small metropolitan areas, rural\ncounties, and areas with both high and\nlow penetration of managed care. In ad-\ndition, we also used a longitudinal ap-\nproach that overcomes some inherent\nlimitationsofcross-sectionalstudies.We\nhad 3 primary questions. First, is over-\nall career satisfaction changing over\ntime? Second, how do changes in phy-\nsician satisfaction vary by market and by\nspecialty? Third, to what extent are\nchanges in physicians' practice environ-\nments and local markets associated with\nchanges in their satisfaction?\nMETHODS\nData Source\nData for this study are from the first 3\nrounds of the Community Tracking\nStudy (CTS) Physician Survey, a se-\nries of 3 nationally representative tele-\nphone surveys of physicians con-\nsponse rate) for the Center for Study-\ning Health System Change.14 The sur-\nvey samples were designed to be\nrepresentative of physicians directly\nproviding patient care in the continen-\ntal United States, as well as in selected\ncommunities. Each survey round used\na complex sample clustered in 60 ran-\ndomly selected sites and a small, inde-\npendently drawn, unclustered na-\ntional sample comprising about 10% of\nall interviews used to increase the pre-\ncision of national estimates.15\nIn each site, we sampled physicians\nfrom the master files of the American\nMedical Association and the American\nOsteopathic Association. The sample\nincluded active nonfederal office- and\nhospital-based physicians who spent at\nleast20hoursperweekindirectpatient\ncare, but excluded specialties such as\nradiology, pathology, and anesthesiol-\nogy. We oversampled PCPs, including\nthose in family practice, general prac-\ntice, general internal medicine, inter-\nnal medicine/pediatrics, pediatrics, and\ngeriatricmedicine.Thesecondandthird\nrounds of the survey included por-\ntions of physicians sampled in the pre-\nvious round, as well as new physi-\ncians. This approach created 2 panels\nof physicians, the first interviewed in\nbothrounds1and2andtheotherinter-\nviewed in both rounds 2 and 3.\nTo create the first panel (round\ndents (76%) to the first round were con-\ntacted in the second round. Of these, a\ntotal of 915 had become ineligible be-\ncause they had retired, worked fewer\nthan 20 hours per week, or were unlo-\nreceived 6569 responses, for a panel re-\neliminated because they changed sites\nor PCP status between rounds or were\nnot practicing in the 60 sites, leaving a\nround survey were contacted in the\nthird round. Of these, a total of 671 had\nbecome ineligible. From the remain-\nsponses, for a panel response rate of\ncause they changed sites or PCP sta-\ntus between rounds or were not prac-\nticing in the 60 sites, leaving a final\nspecialists). Some physicians were\nsampled in both panels. Item nonre-\nsponse for both rounds of the survey\nwas very low, typically less than 3%, and\nless than 0.5% for the dependent vari-\nables. A few independent variables were\nimputed using hot-deck procedures.16\nGreater detail about the surveys is avail-\nAssessing Physician\nCareer Satisfaction\nIn the first section of the survey, physi-\ncians were asked: \"Thinking very gen-\nerally about your satisfaction with your\noverallcareerinmedicine,wouldyousay\nthat you are currently very satisfied,\nsomewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatis-\nfied, very dissatisfied, or neither satis-\nfied nor dissatisfied.\" These responses\nwere coded on a scale from 5 to 1 with\n\"neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\" being\ncodedas3.Inadditiontoreportingover-\nall satisfaction levels, we also report sat-\nisfaction levels by market for 12 of the\nmarkets that were selected randomly for\nmoreintensivestudy.Thesesiteshadsur-\nvey samples large enough (approxi-\nmately 500 physicians per round) to\ndraw conclusions about changes over\ntimeandwerethesubjectofin-depthsite\nvisits that were conducted concur-\nrently with each round of the survey.\nWe determined changes in satisfac-\ntion for the panel respondents by cal-\nculating the differences in reported\nsatisfaction for participants in consecu-\ntive rounds of the survey, with the re-\nsulting variable ranging from +4 to -4.\nIndependent Variables Affecting\nChanges in Physician Satisfaction\nThe literature suggests that changes in\nphysician career satisfaction may be in-\nfluenced by 3 general factors: changes\nin the physician's practice environ-\nment, including the income they de-\nrive from practice and hours worked;\nchanges in physicians' autonomy as\nmeasured by perceptions of their abil-\nity to provide high-quality care to their\npatients and to obtain needed medical\nservices for them; and changes in the\nthe local market.\nIndependent variables used to as-\nsess changes in physician satisfaction\nfor the panel respondents were gener-\nally constructed either as changes in a\ncontinuous variable or as sets of cat-\negorical variables. For continuous vari-\nables, the preceding value (from ei-\nther round 1 or round 2) was subtracted\nfrom the later value (from either round\n2 or round 3). For categorical vari-\nables, dummy variables were con-\nstructed indicating an increase or de-\ncrease in the variable, with those\nphysicians with no (or small) change\nserving as the reference group.\nPractice Environment\nWe measured changes in several at-\ntributes of physicians' practice envi-\nronments, including practice size, own-\nership, and involvement with managed\ncare. The survey assessed size (dichoto-\ntype of practice (physician group, staff/\ngroup model health maintenance or-\nganization [HMO], medical school\u00ad\nbased practice, hospital-owned practice,\nor another setting). After exploring al-\nternative specifications, we created\ndummy variables indicating whether\nphysicians changed from a larger to\nsmaller practice setting or vice versa.\nChanges in ownership were cap-\ntured by 2 dummy variables indicat-\ning whether the physician was a full or\npartial owner who became a non-\nowner or vice versa. A dichotomous\nvariable indicated whether the physi-\ncian's practice had been acquired in the\npreceeding 2 years.\nChanges in the physicians' patient\npopulation were assessed with 2 con-\ntinuous variables measuring changes in\nthe percentage of practice revenue from\nMedicaid and Medicare.\nChanges in the practice's overall ex-\nposure to financial influences of man-\naged care were examined using con-\ntinuous variables measuring changes in\nthe proportion of total practice rev-\nenue derived from managed care and\nchanges in the proportion of managed\ncare revenues received in the form of\ncapitation.\nTo measure effects of various admin-\nistrative care management strategies,\nphysicians were asked, on a 6-point\nscale ranging from \"very large\" to \"no\neffect,\" the extent to which practice pro-\nfiling, patient satisfaction surveys, and\nguidelines affected their practice of\nmedicine. Because responses to these\nquestions varied little over time, and be-\ncause these variables were not signifi-\ncant in preliminary analyses, they were\nnot included in the final analysis.\nChanges in work effort were as-\nsessed by categorical variables, indicat-\ning whether the number of hours\nworkedthepreviousweekchangedfrom\nhours, or vice versa. Change in income\nwas included as a categorical variable in-\ndicating that income increased or de-\ncreased by at least 5% after accounting\nfor inflation. A measure of income per\nwork effort based on hours worked in\nthe prior week was correlated with the\nincome measure, and was therefore not\nincluded in final analyses.\nProfessional Autonomy\nProfessional autonomy refers to indi-\nviduals' ability to control the terms and\ncontentoftheirwork.Basedonthework\nof the Society of General Internal Medi-\ncine Task Force on Physician Satisfac-\ntion, we identified 2 general influences\non clinical autonomy: control over work\nand ability to provide needed ser-\ntonomy, we created a summary score\nbased on responses to a set of 5 ques-\ntions assessing these factors. Respon-\ndentsfirstwereaskedtheirlevelofagree-\nment with a general statement regarding\nthe ability to provide high-quality care\nand with 3 statements related to as-\npects of the process of care delivery:\nwhether they had adequate time with\npatients, freedom to make clinical de-\ncisions, and the ability to form continu-\ning relationships with patients over time\nthat promote the delivery of high-\nquality care. Response categories in-\ncluded agree strongly, agree some-\nwhat,neitheragreenordisagree,disagree\nsomewhat,anddisagreestrongly.Anex-\nploratory factor analysis indicated that\nthere was a single underlying con-\nstruct to the questions. Since the factor\nloadings were almost equal, we created\nthe index by summing up the re-\nsponses. The resulting index was highly\ninternally consistent (Cronbach , .82).\nPrimary care physicians and special-\nists were also asked to rate the appro-\npriateness of the level of patient com-\nplexity that they were expected to\naddress prior to or at the time of refer-\nral, respectively.20 We constructed cat-\negorical variables indicating increases\nor decreases in each of these variables\nbetween the 2 rounds of the survey.\nWe measured ability to provide\nneeded services with a series of 5-point\nquestions that were combined to con-\nstruct 3 indices by averaging compo-\nnent variables: ability to obtain outpa-\ntient services (\"index 1,\" including 3\nitems related to obtaining referrals to\nspecialists, ancillary services, and di-\nagnostic imaging), ability to obtain hos-\npitalizations (\"index 2,\" including 2\nitems related to obtaining hospitaliza-\ntions and length of stay), and ability to\nobtain mental health services (\"index\n3,\" including 2 items related to obtain-\ning outpatient mental health treat-\nment and inpatient mental health\nhospitalizations). The mental health\nquestions were only asked of PCPs, psy-\nchiatrists, and obstetricians/gynecolo-\ngists. Change scores were then calcu-\nlated for each index. A dummy variable\nwas created to account for physicians\nwho did not routinely need the appli-\ncable services (eg, some specialists\nrarely hospitalize patients).\nMarket-Level Changes\nTo assess changes in measures of man-\naged care penetration, we created vari-\nables by subtracting site-level aver-\nages of the percentage of physician\nrevenue from managed care, and also\nthe percentage of physician revenue that\nwas capitated.\nCross-sectional Analyses\nFor descriptive analyses, we used t tests\nto examine changes in continuous vari-\nables and the 2 test for dichotomous\nand categorical variables. We com-\nputed descriptive information on over-\nall satisfaction using the cross-\nsectional information from the 3 rounds\nof the survey. Because the characteris-\ntics of the sample changed somewhat\nover time, we computed regression-\nadjusted mean satisfaction levels for\nrounds 2 and 3 based on the composi-\ntion of the first round of the survey.\nLongitudinal Analyses. We investi-\ngated determinants of career satisfac-\ntion by evaluating changes in satisfac-\ntion for the longitudinal panels of\nphysicians. Cross-sectional studies of\nphysician career satisfaction can be bi-\nased because unobserved physician\npreferences may affect their practice\nchoices (eg, involvement with man-\naged care, size of practice) as well as\ntheir career satisfaction. In a longitu-\ndinal first-differences model, in which\nthe dependent and independent vari-\nables are mostly expressed in terms of\ntheir changes over time, unobserved\nphysician preferences, as well as ob-\nservable physician characteristics, are\nheld constant because we are only look-\ning at changes affecting a given physi-\ncian over time. The inclusion of base-\nline career satisfaction in the regression\nmodels also allows us to control for\npossible bias due to floor and ceiling\neffects as well as for the tendency of\nindividual physicians to rate their\nsatisfaction more or less highly.\nWe used ordinary least-squares re-\ngressions to investigate multivariable re-\nlationships. For these models, we com-\nbined both panels into a single data set\nbecause our model suggests that the de-\nterminants of satisfaction would not\nchange appreciably over time. We es-\ntimated separate models for PCPs and\nspecialist physicians because we\nthought that changes in the practice en-\nvironment and autonomy might be ex-\npected to affect generalists and special-\nists differently. We first examined\nbivariate relationships. Variables that\nwere not significantly related to changes\nin satisfaction at P.10 in either bivar-\niate or multivariable models were elimi-\nnated from the models. This did not re-\nsult in significant changes for any of the\nremaining coefficients. Because they\nwere a primary interest of this study,\nvariables related to exposure to man-\naged care at both the individual and\nmarket level were also included in the\nfinal model. All analyses were done us-\ning SUDAAN v8.01 (RTI Interna-\ntional, Research Triangle Park, NC) to\ncontrol for the complex sample de-\nsign and use weights created for the\npanel.14 The SUDAAN software also ac-\ncounts for the nonindependence of ob-\nservations when the same physician is\nincluded in both panels.\nEach category of characteristics (for\ninstance, changes in practice environ-\nment or changes in physician au-\ntonomy) was entered individually and\nthen in combination to examine both\ndirect and indirect effects. For in-\nstance, we speculated that changes in\nsatisfaction related to managed care ex-\nposure might be mediated by changes\nin professional autonomy, so we ex-\namined these groups of variables indi-\nvidually and in combination. For each\nsubgroup, variables were first exam-\nined for collinearity. Correlations were\nbelow levels at which multicollinear-\nitywouldbeconsideredlikely(r0.30).\nWe report results from the model in-\ncluding all categories of independent\nvariables because individual coeffi-\ncients remained robust when alterna-\ntive specifications were tested.\nWe also performed additional ex-\nploratory multivariable analyses at the\nsite level, using the combined panel data\nsets. For these analyses, we created site-\nlevel means of physician satisfaction as\nwell as independent variables related to\nmanaged care exposure and distribu-\ntion of patients across public and pri-\nvate payers. We also used information\nfrom Interstudy21 and the Bureau of\nHealth Professions Area Resource File22\nto examine physician, hospital, and\nhealth plan concentration.\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of the respondents\nacross the 3 rounds of the survey are\npresented in TABLE 1.

Income was not related to\nchanges in specialist satisfaction, but\nchanges in satisfaction among PCPs\nwere significantly related to income\n(P.01). Changes in exposure to man-\naged care were generally not related to\nchanges in satisfaction.\nChanges in Professional Autonomy.\nThe most consistent predictors of\nchanges in both PCP and specialist ca-\nreer satisfaction were changes in mea-\nsures related to clinical autonomy. Pri-\nmary care physicians who reported\nincreasesinthelevelofpatientcomplex-\nity that they were expected to address\nwithout referral were more likely to re-\nport decreased satisfaction (P.01).\nSimilarly,bothPCPsandspecialistswho\nreported more difficulty obtaining high-\nquality outpatient services (P.01) and\ninpatient services (P.05) were also\nmore likely to be report decreased sat-\nisfaction with their careers. Finally,\nchanges in the clinical autonomy scale,\nwhich measures physicians' ability to\nprovide high-quality care, maintain con-\ntinuing patient relationships, adequacy\nof time with patients, and freedom to\nmakeclinicaldecisions,werestronglyre-\nlated to changes in satisfaction for both\nPCPs and specialists (P.001 for both).\nChanges in Market-Level Charac-\nteristics. Primary care physicians in\nmarkets with increased proportions of\nmanaged care revenue in the form of\ncapitation were significantly less satis-\nfied (P.01), while specialists' satis-\nfaction was not related to changes in the\nmarket-level measures of managed care.\nLastly, we also examined predictors of\nchanges in satisfaction at the market\nlevel. Both increased market-level man-\naged care penetration and higher pro-\nportions of capitated managed care rev-\nenue were associated with decreases in\nmarket-level physician satisfaction.\nCOMMENT\nDespite a lack of systematic data, many\nobservers perceived a decline in phy-\nsician career satisfaction. As physi-\ncian practice continues to evolve, it be-\ncomes increasingly important to\nunderstand how satisfaction is chang-\ning and whether managers and policy\nmakers at the local or national level can\ninfluence these changes.\nIn this national study of satisfaction\namong a large representative sample of\nphysicians, we find several notable re-\nsults.First,ourfindingsdemonstratethat\noveralllevelsofcareersatisfactionamong\nphysicians over this time period did not\nchange dramatically, although there ap-\npeared to be a slight decline between\ndata mask significant variation in local\nmarkets. These findings suggest that\nchanges in physician satisfaction may be\nsignificantly influenced by local phe-\nnomena. Third, we found that changes\ninphysicians'clinicalautonomy,includ-\ning their ability to obtain needed out-\npatient and inpatient services, were the\nmost consistent and powerful predic-\ntors of changes in their levels of satis-\nfactionovertime.Changeinincomewas\nasignificantpredictoronlyforPCPs,and\nchange in practice ownership was sig-\nnificant for both PCPs and specialists.\nA number of other possible influences,\nsuchasmanagedcarepenetrationwithin\nphysicians' practices, had little appar-\nent effect.\nChanges in autonomy cannot be at-\ntributed simply to the spread of man-\naged care, since managed care vari-\nables generally were not important\npredictors of change in satisfaction,\neven in models that did not include the\nchange in autonomy measures.23 In-\nstead, more subtle factors seem to be\nat work. These may be related to un-\nmeasured differences in managed care\norganizations in different communi-\nties, or in how physicians' organiza-\ntions respond to managed care. In ad-\ndition, it could also reflect changes in\nthe intensity of managed care prac-\ntices over the time period, such as those\nrelated to increasing use of certain types\nof capitation, which we were unable to\nmeasure.\nPrevious studies of the trends in and\ndeterminantsofphysiciansatisfactionre-\ncused on selected markets or special-\nties,26,27 orfailedtoidentifythefullrange\nof influences on satisfaction.
