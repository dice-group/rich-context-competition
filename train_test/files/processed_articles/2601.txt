Also, the female advantage in overall LEB masks the disadvan-\ntage spread across ages: Indian females are still subject to feticide and excess mortality [3\u00ad5].\nFurther, even in the most recent periods, there is rampant gender discrimination in nutrition,\nimmunization, treatment-seeking behavior, and living arrangements for both young and\nA great deal of research has been conducted to understand gender discrimination in health-\ncare utilization in India. Invariably, these studies document that men and women have unequal\naccess to health care at various stages of the life cycle. For example, girl children are less immu-\nnized than boy children [9, 14]; have less access to hospital treatment; and are subject to fewer\nhospitalizations before death [15]. Also, girls' access to health care depends heavily on the sex\ncomposition of siblings [9]. At old age, Indian women report worse self-rated health and dis-\nabilities, despite utilizing health-care facilities less [16, 17]. Also, untreated morbidity rates are\nhigher among women than men, and a strong class gradient by gender is found for in-patient\nIs gender discrimination in health-care expenditure (HCE) in India as evident as in health\noutcomes? A survey of the literature suggests that gender difference in HCE has not received\nadequate attention in studies on India. A study of strategies used by Indian parents to finance\nHCE reveals that the chance of hospitalization among girls is lower than among boys; also, if\nboys are hospitalized, parents are substantially more likely to borrow, sell assets, or take help\nfrom friends to pay the expenses [19]. Parents consult qualified health professionals more\noften and sooner for boys than girls, and spend more money on boys than on girls [20]. A\nsmall study conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh showed that among households with male chil-\ndren, the average expenditure on health care during the neonatal period was nearly fourfold\nthat of households with females [21]. Further, households with female newborns used cheaper\npublic care providers, whereas households with male newborns preferred private providers\n(although unqualified) as these were perceived to deliver satisfactory care [21]. A study by\nMaharana and Ladusingh [22] reports that gender disparity among the elderly in health and\nfood expenditure has been narrowing over time, and that the compositional shift of gender in\nhouseholds (from male-dominated to female-dominated) leads to the reduction of household\nexpenditure on health and food. A longitudinal survey was conducted on rural cancer patients\nin a public tertiary health center in Odisha; a study based on it showed that expenditures on\nfemale adults were significantly less than those on male adults, and that about one-third of the\ndifference can be attributed to gender discrimination [23]. However, while these studies docu-\nment the nature and extent of gender discrimination in access to and expenditure on health\ncare, these do not attempt to understand the socio-economic factors underlying the gender gap\nin HCE.\nUsing the most recent available nationally representative panel data, we examine whether\nthe gender disparity in HCE continues over time. Unlike many earlier studies, we include both\nyoung and old populations, to understand gender discrimination in health overall. We then\nGender Difference in Health-Care Expenditure\nassess whether the gender gap in HCEs is explained by the differences in underlying demo-\ngraphic and socio-economic factors and, if so, to what extent demographic and socio-economic\nfactors explain this gap.\nData and Methods\nData\nWe used two rounds of the longitudinal, nationally representative survey known as the India\nHuman Development Survey (IHDS), conducted by researchers from the University of Mary-\nland, USA and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), New Delhi,\nwere added to maintain a representative sample. Both the data sets are publicly available\nthrough the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The IHDS\nconducted two one-hour interviews in each household, on topics such as caste, consumption,\nincome, agriculture, education, health, employment, gender relations, etc. Children aged 8\u00ad11\nyears completed short reading, writing, and arithmetic tests. Additional village, school, and\nmedical facility interviews are also available.\nFor both rounds of data, we used information available through the household question-\nnaire. Information on occurrence and duration of short-term morbidity, hospitalization, and\nrelated cost was collected for each member of household suffering from short-term morbidities.\nSimilarly, information on diagnosis of major morbidities treatment, hospitalization, and\nrelated cost was collected through household questionnaire.\nMeasures\nIf a household member had suffered fever, cough, or diarrhea in the 30 days preceding the sur-\nvey, the household is described as having experienced a short-term morbidity. The question\nasked was \". . . Has anybody been ill with any of these (fever/cough/diarrhea) illness in [the]\nlast 30 days?\" Thus, short-term morbidity is a reported morbidity by the respondent on behalf\nof his family members. Treatment cost for short-term morbidity includes expenses for medical\nconsultations, tests, medicines, transportation to the hospital, hospitalization, and surgery.\nMorbidities diagnosed by doctors are characterized as major. The question asked was \"Has a\ndoctor ever diagnosed any member of the household as having . . . cataracts, tuberculosis,\nhypertension, heart disease . . .?\" The major morbidities listed in the questionnaires by the\nIHDs are cataracts, tuberculosis, high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, leprosy, cancer,\nasthma, polio, paralysis, epilepsy, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and\naccidents. Further, IHDS collected information on type of treatment (public/private/tradi-\ntional); hospitalization (yes/no); and cost due to doctor, hospital, surgery, test, medicines, and\ntransportation to the hospital.\nWe analyzed the gender differential in HCE by\n\u00b7 place of residence (rural/urban)\n\u00b7 education of the individual (illiterate, up to primary, primary to secondary, higher secondary,\nand above)\n\u00b7 religion (Hindu, Muslim, others)\nGender Difference in Health-Care Expenditure\n\u00b7 caste (others, Other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes)\n\u00b7 wealth quintile (poorest, poor, middle, rich, richest)\n\u00b7 in-patient care (no, yes); and\n\u00b7 type of health facility (public, private, traditional healer).\nStatistical Methods\nWe conducted the analysis in STATA (version 13.1). We calculated the prevalence of short-\nterm morbidity (major morbidity) by dividing the number of persons suffered from short-term\nmorbidity (major morbidity) by the total number of persons in the sample. We did the chi-\nsquared test to assess statistically significant difference in morbidity prevalence/ duration of\nsufferings by gender.\nTo examine the gender difference in health expenditure, we calculated mean health expen-\nditure (MHE) by gender among various demographic and socio-economic subgroups. We\nadjusted the HCE figures to account for the inflation rates using the wholesale price index (as\nWe carried out two-part model (2PM) in pooled data (IHDS I and IHDS II) to assess the\nadjusted effect of gender on major morbidity HCEs. The 2PM is one of the most popular mod-\nels for analyzing HCE data [25]. Typically, the distribution of HCE has a mass of observations\nat one or more specific values--say, at zero--and is skewed on the right. Therefore, application\nof OLS linear regression models may yield biased and less precise estimates of means and mar-\nginal effect. The 2PM is a popular alternative in cases of probit (or logit) and OLS models. The\nfirst part (probit) estimates the probability that an individual will spend on health; the second\npart (generalized linear model (GLM), Gamma family, log link function) estimates the corre-\nlates of the positive level of expenditure [26]. Since medical expenditure is typically right-\nskewed, the log of the expenditure is modeled in GLM part. Also, two-part models are appro-\npriate when the participation (visiting health facility) and consumption decisions (health\nexpenditure) are chronologically sequential [27].\nTo examine the role of demographic and socio-economic factors in the gender gap in health\nexpenditure, we used the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method [25,28,29]. The outcome var-\niable is HCE in major morbidity. Therefore, the gap between mean outcome, Y male and Y female,\nis equal to\nYmale \u00c0 Yfemale\n\u00bc bmaleXmale \u00c0 bfemaleXfemale\n\u00bc bfemaleXmale \u00c0 bfemaleXfemale \u00fe bmaleXfemale \u00c0 bfemaleXfemale \u00fe \u00f0bmaleXmale \u00c0 bfemaleXmale\n\u00c0bmaleXfemale \u00fe bfemaleXfemale\u00de\n\u00bc bfemale\u00f0Xmale \u00c0 Xfemale\u00de \u00fe Xfemale\u00f0bmale \u00c0 bfemale\u00de \u00fe \u00f0Xmale \u00c0 Xfemale\u00de\u00f0bmale \u00c0 bfemale\u00de\n\u00bc bfemaleDX \u00fe XfemaleDb \u00fe DXDb\n\u00bc E \u00fe C \u00fe CE\nIn the above equation, xmale and x female are the vectors of explanatory variables evaluated at\nthe means for male, and females, respectively. Thus, the gap between male and female HCEs is\ndue to (a) a gap in endowments (or due to the distribution of Xs) (E) or (b) a gap in coefficients\n(C) or (c) a gap arising from interaction of endowment and coefficients (CE) (for a detailed\ndescription of this method, see O'Donnell et al. [25]).\nGender Difference in Health-Care Expenditure\nResults\nSample description of the population suffering from short-term and major\nmorbidity\nTable 1 presents the sample description of people suffering from short-term and major mor-\nbidity in both rounds of the IHDS. Substantially more people suffer from short-term morbidity\n2011\u00ad2012). In both rounds, the age composition of both types of morbidity is similar overall,\nbut varies from one type of morbidity to another. In the case of major morbidities, a significant\nfrom IHDS I to IHDS II. The share of males in short-term and major morbidities is slightly\nlower than that of females.\nTable 1 also shows that a majority of the people belong to rural areas (over 60%); are illiter-\nate or have completed primary school (varies between 60% and 70%); and are Hindu (over\n80% and belong to any type of caste (OBC/SC/ST). A clear positive pattern is seen in the case\nof major morbidity by wealth quintile. As wealth quintile increases from poorest to richest, the\nshare of the sample in major morbidity also increases.\nGender differential in the prevalence of short-term and major morbidity\nTable 2 shows the prevalence of short-term and major morbidity by gender in both rounds of\nthe IHDS. The morbidity prevalence rate is consistently higher for females in both short-term\n93.91 vs. female 119.86. A chi square test shows that the difference in prevalence rate by gender\nis statistically significant (p = 0.000).\nGender difference in health care expenditure\nThe mean health expenditure expressed in Indian rupees (INR) by gender is shown in Fig 1\nand Table 3. Mean health expenditure for women is always lower than that of men irrespective\nof type of morbidity and survey rounds. Table 3 also reports the gender difference in mean\nhealth expenditure (MHE) (= health expenditure of male--health expenditure of female)\nexpressed in INR ($1 is approximately INR 65) by various factors. A negative value in this table\nindicates female HCE is higher than male HCE; a positive value indicates that the converse is\ntrue. Overall, a discernible difference in HCE was observed by gender. Male HCE was higher\nthan that of female HCE irrespective of IHDS round and type of morbidity. After adjusting the\n2012. A Chi square test shows that the increase in the difference in HCEs is statistically signifi-\ncant. Further, a vivid divide in HCEs by gender is visible across most demographic and socio-\neconomic groups. An apparent class gradient is also revealed in the HCE on major morbidity\nin IHDS II. The gender gap in HCE among people in the richest wealth quintile is seven times\nTable 4 demonstrates the results of the 2PM that examines the adjusted effect of gender on\nHCE in India in IHDS 2011\u00ad2012 data.

It is clear that the net effect of gen-\nCI (-0.206, -0.091)]; that is, spending on major morbidity is less likely for females than for\nmales. Similarly, spending on major morbidity is less likely for people living in urban areas, not\ncurrently married, illiterate, or of deprived castes. On the contrary, HCE increases with\nincrease in wealth quintile, in-patient care seekers, and patients using private health facilities.\nDecomposition of gender in health care expenditure in major morbidity\nTable 5 presents the results of Oaxaca decomposition to quantify the contribution of selected\npredictors in explaining the male-female difference in health care expenditure. The male-\nfemale difference in HCE is decomposed into three parts: the first part is known as endowment\neffect, which indicates the gap due to differences in the distribution of determinants between\nmale and female; the second part is the coefficient effect, which indicates the gap due to the dif-\nferences in the effect of determinants between the male and female; and the third is the interac-\ntion between both endowment effect and coefficient effect (interaction effect).\nThe decomposition analysis reveals that about 48.77% of the male\u00adfemale gap in HCE is\nexplained by the differential distribution of demographic and socio-economic factors\n(Table 5). While education, religion, caste, and type of health facility contributed significantly\ntowards reducing the male\u00adfemale gap in HCE, place of residence, marital status, wealth index,\nin-patient care seeking, morbidity type and duration of stay in hospital contributed towards\nTable 1.

The contribution of in-patient care towards widening the gap was the high-\nest (about 64.71%); it indicates that the distribution of in-patient care is more favorable to\nmales than females. Next was duration of stay in hospital (19.33%). The highest contribution\ntowards reducing the gap is by level of education (about 16.81%). About 50% of the difference\nwas accounted by effects of determinants (coefficients). The positive contribution by marital\nstatus, caste, wealth quintile etc. indicates that effects of theses factors are responsible for wider\ngender gap in HCE. More precisely, the positive contribution of marital status (about 76.23%\nof total coefficient effects) suggests that effect of being married (or being widowed) is more\nfavorable to male than females on HCE. There are a few offsetting factors such as place of resi-\ndence, type of health facility and type of morbidity indicating the favorable effects of these vari-\nables to reduce the male-female gap in HCE. Since the contribution of interaction effect is\nmarginal (about 1.23%), we did not present those results in detail.\nDiscussion\nThe recognition of gender discrimination in health-care practices goes back to the early twenti-\neth century.\n\"There is no doubt that, as a rule, she [a girl] receives less attention than would be bestowed\nupon a son. She is less warmly clad, . . . . . .. She is probably not so well fed as a boy would be,\nand when ill, her parents are not likely to make the same strenuous efforts to ensure her recov-\nYet, the recent literature focuses more on gender differentials in health outcomes, such as\nmortality and nutrition among children and, to a certain extent, among women in reproductive\nage groups. The importance of examining gender difference in the cost of chronic diseases\ngrows tremendously due to the emergence of these diseases and its impact on disability status,\nparticularly in adult and old ages. Using a recently available nationally representative data, this\nstudy attempted to answer three questions: Using a recently available nationally representative\ndata, this study attempted to answer three questions: a) what is the nature and extent of gender\ndiscrimination in HCE in India in recent years? b) How much of this discrimination is due to\nthe distribution of demographic and socio-economic factors and their effects? c) What are the\nfactors of widening or reducing the gender gap in HCE?\nThis study puts forward two major findings. First, although both short-term and major\nmorbidity are significantly higher among females than among males, average HCE is signifi-\ncantly lower among women. The disadvantage is more pronounced in the case of major mor-\nbidity since it incurs relatively higher costs. Further, except for a few cases of short-term\nFig 1.

Contrary to common belief,\ngender discrimination in HCE is more severe in adult or old age than in young age. A strong\ngradient in gender discrimination is observed by household wealth quintile. These results hold\ntrue even after controlling the role of demographic, socio-economic, and health care-related\nfactors.\nThe second important result is that less than half of the gender difference in HCE is due to\nmale\u00adfemale differences in demographic, socio-economic, and health care-related factors; the\nrest is due to the effects of these factors on HCE. Thus, the contribution by coefficients repre-\nsents the genuine role of gender in HCE, i.e., less is spent on female health because of the\nnotion that female health is not as important as male health.\nThe findings of this study are consistent with those of studies conducted in India and in\nconducted in many developed and developing countries [33\u00ad35]. In general, women in devel-\noped countries are more aware about their health [36,37]; use more health-care facilities and\nBut in countries like India and China, where a complex web of poverty, social hierarchy,\nand deep-rooted patriarchal structure eliminates women's health from the household priority\nlist, women often invest more of their time in household activities or work that is not directly\nlinked to economic outcomes [31, 40, 41]. Therefore, they may postpone meeting their own\nhealth needs to meet those of male family members directly involved in earning income [31,\n42, 43] and prioritize the health of male members over their own [31, 44]. This is still an exam-\nple of gender discrimination rather than gender equity since women's indirect contribution to\nhousehold income through household chores and care giving remains unaccounted. Secondly,\nin the absence of robust social protection schemes, poor families often mitigate health-related\nout-of-pocket expenditure by compromising on the health needs of female family members\n[15, 19, 44]. On the other hand, in non-poor families, women have less power to bargain on\ntheir needs due to lack of property ownership, lack of income earning means, lack of commu-\nnity support, and ongoing social norms and perceptions [45]. Thus, the gender differential in\nHCE in India is perhaps the result of powerful synergies between socio-economic status and\npatriarchal values.\nThis study has a few limitations. First, women respondents provided data on health-care\nexpenditure incurred for all household members in the twelve months preceding the survey;\ntherefore, there is a chance of recall bias of the expenditure data. However, this recall bias\nshould be affected to both male and female health expenditure data and hence our results on\nTable 3.

Secondly, by analyzing gender disparity\nin morbidity related expenditure, we are documenting only one part of discrimination that\nwomen may face in the process of health-seeking behavior. In reality, women may face sequen-\ntial discrimination at the stage of health care i.e., in receiving out-patient care, in in-patient\ncare, in major morbidity diagnosis and finally in arranging the health finance from various\nsources. This can be analyzed in future studies.\nTable 4. (Continued)\nProbit model (First part) General linearized model (Second part)\nFactors Coef. P>z 95% CI Coef.

To achieve these goals, it is crucial to identify the disadvantaged\nand excluded through the lens of gender. Previous studies show that although women in India\nlive longer than men, they have poorer health outcomes, such as excess mortality in young\nages, poor nutrition in young and adult ages, and higher rate of disability in old age [5, 17, 42].\nThe corollary of these findings is that women need better health-care support for India to\nreach gender equity in health. Unfortunately, the present analysis of HCE in India too reveals\nthat gender equity in health care is a distant dream. To tackle gender-related discrimination in\nHCE and bring about equity, it is essential not only to introduce a social protection scheme but\nalso to guarantee gender equitability in those schemes. Although the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima\nYojana (RSBY), India's social protection scheme, is a remarkable step towards addressing the\nhealth needs of disadvantaged groups, special emphasis should be given to foster health care\nutilization among women. At the same time, women empowerment and their involvement in\ndecision-making powers is essential, since these are the vehicles of possible equity in health\ncare services in India. Also, a deeper analysis of gender needs and gender barriers linking to\nsocial structure and health.\n"
