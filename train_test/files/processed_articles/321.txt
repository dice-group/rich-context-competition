In addition, C-reactive protein concentration was\nassociated with future adverse events among people\nwith angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (Liuzzo et al,\nThe realization that inflammation may play an important\nrole in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis suggests new\nopportunities for the prevention and treatment of athero-\nsclerosis.

However,\nlittle is known about how nutritional status is associated\nwith concentrations of inflammatory markers. A number of\nstudies, which generally included either small numbers of\nparticipants or were conducted in special populations, have\ndescribed inverse relationships between C-reactive protein\nconcentration and circulating concentrations of antioxi-\n2000). In addition, inverse associations were shown between\nC-reactive protein concentration and concentrations of\ncarotenoids and serum retinol using NHANES III data\nSince the associations between C-reactive protein concen-\ntration and circulating concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin\nE, and selenium have not been well described in population-\nbased samples, we examined these associations using\nNHANES III data. To facilitate comparisons among the\nassociations of the antioxidants and because previous\nNHANES III findings about the associations between serum\ncarotenoid concentrations and C-reactive protein concentra-\ntion were limited to younger participants, we also present\nthe results of our analyses of circulating concentrations of\nserum carotenoids and C-reactive protein for the entire set of\nparticipants. In addition, we explored several possible\nsources of effect modification including age, sex, smoking\nstatus, and body mass index.\nSubjects and methods\nStatistics conducting the Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III) collected data from a\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US\npopulation by using a multistage, stratified sampling design.\nSurvey participants were interviewed and invited for a\nclinical examination. For most participants, blood was\ndrawn at the examination clinic, but for some who were\nunable to attend the examination because of health reasons,\na blood sample was obtained during the home interview.\nPeople aged Z60 y, and African Americans and Mexican\nAmericans were oversampled. Details about the survey and\nits methods have been previously published (Centers for\nNHANES III participants attended one of three examina-\ntion sessions: morning, afternoon, or evening. Those\nattending the morning sessions were asked to fast for 10\u00ad\n16 h. Those attending the afternoon and evening sessions\nwere asked to fast for at least 6 h. C\u00adreactive protein was\nmeasured at the University of Washington Department of\nLaboratory Medicine by using latex\u00adenhanced nephelome-\ntry, a low-sensitivity assay (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 1996). Details about the laboratory procedures\nand quality control have been previously published (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). The intra- and\ninterassay coefficients of variation for participants' C-\nreactive protein concentrations were 3.2 and 16.1%, respec-\ntively (Visser et al, 1999). The lower detection limit was\n3.0 mg/l. We defined an elevated C-reactive protein concen-\ntration as the 85th percentile of the sex-specific distribution\nused in a previous analysis: Z4.4 mg/dl for men and Z7.0 for\nConcentrations of the following analytes were measured at\nthe NHANES Central Laboratory at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention: retinol and retinyl esters, vitamin E,\nand five carotenoids (alpha- and beta-carotene, B-cryptox-\nanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene) were measured in\nserum with an isocratic reverse-phase high-performance\nliquid chromatography method, with detection at 325,\nblood cell folates were measured by radioassay using\nQuantaphase I & II assay kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,\nCA, USA) (Federation of American Societies for Experimental\nBiology, 1995; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n1996). Selenium concentration was measured in serum using\ngraphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). Detailed proce-\ndures for these assays were published in the NHANES III\nThe analyses included the following variables: age, sex,\nrace or ethnicity, education, serum cotinine concentration,\nbody mass index, leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin\nuse. In addition to these, we stratified the analyses by\ncigarette smoking and vitamin or mineral supplement use.\nSerum cotinine concentration was determined by using\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography atmospheric-pres-\nsure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Body\nmass index was calculated from measured weight and height\n(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).\nWe defined four levels of physical activity: vigorously active,\nmoderately active, lightly active, and sedentary. Vigorously\nactive was defined as participating three or more times per\nweek in an activity with a metabolic equivalent (MET) level\nof 6 or greater for participants who were 60 y or older and 7\nor greater for participants who were younger than 60 y. One\nMET is the energy expenditure of approximately 3.5 ml\noxygen/kg body weight/min or 1 kcal/kg body weight/h.\nModerately active was defined as participating five or more\ntimes per week in activities of which no more than two could\nbe considered vigorous. Lightly active was defined as\nparticipation that was not vigorous or moderate. Sedentary\nwas defined as engaging in no leisure-time physical activity.\nAspirin use was estimated from the following question: \"In\nthe past month, have you taken any aspirin, Anacin,\nBufferin, Ecotrin, Ascriptin, or Midol?\" Participants were\nC-reactive protein concentration\nES Ford et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nthen asked how often they used these products in the past\nmonth. We created three levels of smoking status: partici-\npants who currently smoked (had smoked 100 cigarettes and\nwere currently smoking), participants who had quit smoking\n(had smoked 100 cigarettes and were not currently smoking),\nand participants who had never smoked (had never smoked\nWe limited our analyses to participants who were 20 y or\nolder. When age-adjusted was performed, the data were\ndirect method. To compare categorical and continuous\nvariables of participants with C-reactive protein concentra-\ntions Z85th percentile with those of participants with C-\nreactive protein concentrations o85th percentile, we used w2\ntests and t-tests, respectively. In addition, the associations\nbetween the dichotomized C-reactive protein concentrations\nand the independent variables were examined by using\nlogistic regression analysis. To account for the complex\nsurvey design, we used SUDAAN and the medical examina-\ntion clinic sampling weights to produce our weighted\nestimates and standard errors (Shah et al, 1997).\nResults\nmedical examination. Of these, 15 604 had a C-reactive\nreactive protein concentrations ranged from o3.0 to\no3.0 mg/l and were assigned a value of o3.0 mg/l.\nParticipants with an elevated C-reactive protein concen-\ntration were older, and after age-adjustment they were less\nlikely to be white, had fewer years of education, had a higher\nserum cotinine concentration, were heavier, were less likely\nto be moderately or vigorously active, and were somewhat\nless likely to be taking aspirin than participants with a lower\nC-reactive protein concentration (Table 1). Furthermore, age-\nadjusted concentrations of retinol, serum retinyl esters,\nvitamin C, serum folate, carotenoids, and selenium were\nsignificantly and inversely associated with C-reactive protein\nconcentration.\nThese findings persisted after further adjustment for race\nor ethnicity, education, cotinine concentration, body mass\nindex, leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin use in\nlogistic regression models (Table 2). Comparing the highest\nwith the lowest quartiles, inverse associations were noted\nbetween C-reactive protein concentration and retinol\nTable 1 Age-adjusted means or percentages (s.e.) for selected baseline characteristics and concentrations of blood vitamins, carotenoids, and selenium\nof participants aged Z20 y by C-reactive protein concentration status, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988\u00ad1994\nC-reactive protein concentration\nN N P-value\n% Taking aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin, Ecotrin, Ascriptin,\nor Midol in the last month\nC-reactive protein concentration\nES Ford et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nP-values for the tests for linear trend for all these analytes\nwere significant. Additional adjustment for serum total\ncholesterol concentration had a minimal effect on the odds\nratios.\nWe further examined the associations between C-reactive\nprotein concentration and concentrations of carotenoids,\nvitamins, and selenium by age, sex, race or ethnicity, body\nmass index, and vitamin or supplement use. No evidence\nwas found that the relationships between C-reactive protein\nstatus and the exposure variables differed among vitamin or\nmineral users or nonusers. The interaction terms between\nage and b-cryptoxanthin concentration (P \u00bc 0.015) and age\nand lutein/zeaxanthin concentration (P \u00bc 0.047) were sig-\nnificant. An inverse association between b-cryptoxanthin\nconcentration and C-reactive protein concentration was\nbut the association for the youngest age group was more like\na threshold response in contrast to clear dose\u00adresponse\nassociations in the other two age groups. Lutein/zeaxanthin\nconcentration was significantly and inversely associated\nwith C-reactive protein concentration among participants\naged Z65 y only. Only a single significant interaction for\nrace or ethnicity was noted for b-carotene concentration\n(P \u00bc 0.016). However, among all three groups a significant\ninverse association was observed.\nWith the exception of vitamin E, inverse associations\nbetween C-reactive protein concentration and concentra-\ntions of retinol, retinyl esters, a-, b-carotene, lycopene, and\nselenium were noted for men and for women. Differences in\nthe strength of the dose\u00adresponse of the inverse associations\naccounted for the significant interactions. For men, the\nrelationships between C-reactive protein concentration and\nconcentrations of retinol and retinyl esters were somewhat\nmore prominent than the relationships among women.\nVitamin E concentration was inversely associated with C-\nreactive protein concentration in men (P \u00bc 0.004) and\npositively associated with C-reactive protein concentration\nin women (P \u00bc 0.002). The inverse relationships between C-\nreactive protein concentration and a-, b-carotene, and\nlycopene concentrations appeared to be stronger among\nwomen than men.\nBody mass index was a significant modifier of the\nrelationship between C-reactive protein status and concen-\ntrations of retinol, vitamin C, serum folate, a-carotene, and\nb-cryptoxanthin. Although inverse relationships were noted\nTable 2 Associations between elevated C-reactive protein concentration (Z85th percentile) and concentrations of blood vitamins, carotenoids, and\nOdds ratio* (95% CI)\nN Quartile 1w Quartile 2 Quartile 3 Quartile 4 P for linear trend Continuous\nSerum retinyl esters\n(mmol/l)\nRed blood cell folate\n(nmol/l)\nb-Cryptoxanthin\n(mmol/l)\nLutein/zeaxanthin\n(mmol/l)\n*Adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, cotinine concentration, body mass index, leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin use.\nC-reactive protein concentration\nES Ford et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nat each level of body mass index (o25 and Z25 kg/m2), the\nshape of these associations tended to exhibit more of a dose\u00ad\nresponse effect among overweight or obese participants than\nparticipants with a normal body mass index.\nVitamin C concentration was inversely related to C-\nreactive protein status for each level of smoking status, but\nappeared to be more pronounced among smokers (Table 3).\nVitamin E concentration showed more of a threshold\nrelationship with C-reactive protein status among smokers\nand was not related to C-reactive protein status among\nformer smokers or participants who had never smoked. b-\nCryptoxanthin concentration showed a threshold response\nto C-reactive protein status among smokers and dose\u00ad\nresponse relationships among former smokers and partici-\npants who never smoked. Selenium was inversely related to\nC-reactive protein status among smokers but not among the\nother two groups.\nFruit and vegetable consumption, estimated from the\nfood-frequency questionnaire, was not significantly related\nto C-reactive protein status in multiple logistic regression\nDiscussion\nUsing data from a large cross-sectional survey of US adults,\nwe found that C-reactive protein concentration was inver-\nsely associated with concentrations of several vitamins,\ncarotenoids, and selenium, independent of age, sex, race or\nethnicity. These findings are generally consistent with and\nextend the results from previously published studies that\nhave examined the associations between C-reactive protein\nconcentration and various blood concentrations of carote-\nnoids and vitamins in small and special samples of\nparticipants. Because fruits and vegetables are rich sources\nof vitamins and carotenoids, any favorable effect of these\nphytonutrients on C-reactive protein concentration would\nmake for an attractive hypothesis in partially explaining the\nbenefits of adequate consumption of these foods in prevent-\ning coronary heart disease. However, we were unable to\ndemonstrate a significant inverse association between fruit\nand vegetable intake and C-reactive protein concentration.\nAlthough the two may be unrelated, the fruit and vegetable\nmeasure that we used may have been too inexact to detect\nany significant association. Since so little is known about\nassociations between fruit and vegetable intake and inflam-\nmatory markers, additional studies are needed.\nWe found a number of significant interactions, which is\npartially due to the large sample size. However, inverse\nassociations between blood analytes and C-reactive protein\nconcentration were present for most of the sex, body mass\nindex, and smoking strata. The significant interactions\nappeared to be driven mostly by differences in the slopes\nor the shapes of the associations. However, the associations\nbetween vitamin E concentration and C-reactive protein\nconcentration differed among men (inverse) and women\n(positive). The reason for these different associations is not\nTable 3 Associations between elevated C-reactive protein concentration (Z85th percentile) and concentrations of blood vitamins, carotenoids, and\nselenium among adults aged Z20 y, stratified by smoking status, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988\u00ad1994\nN Quartile 1 Quartile 2 Quartile 3 Quartile 4 P-value for interaction term\nVitamin C (mmol/l)\nVitamin E (mmol/l)\nRed blood cell folate (nmol/l)\nb-Cryptoxanthin (mmol/L)\nSelenium (nmol/l)\nC-reactive protein concentration\nES Ford et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nimmediately apparent and, given the number of interactions\nthat we tested, may have been due to chance.\nIn previous studies, researchers have examined some of\nthese relationships in patients with various conditions or\nother select populations. In a study of nuns aged 77\u00ad99 y, C-\nreactive protein concentration was inversely related to\nplasma concentrations of a-, b-carotene, lycopene, and total\ncarotenoids (Boosalis et al, 1996). Among Chinese women,\nplasma retinol concentration was inversely related to C-\nreactive protein concentration (Root et al, 1999). Among\npatients with type II diabetes mellitus, vitamin E supple-\nmentation of 800 U/day resulted in decreases of C-reactive\nprotein concentrations (Upritchard et al, 2000). Inverse\nrelations between C-reactive protein concentrations and\nconcentrations of retinol, vitamin C, tocopherol, and lutein\nhave been noted among patients with lung cancer (Talwar\namong those undergoing orthopedic surgery (Louw et al,\n1992). Furthermore, vitamins A, C, and E decrease transi-\nently during the course of an acute myocardial infarction\n(Labadarios et al, 1987). Among patients with gastrointest-\ninal cancer, those with an elevated C-reactive protein\nconcentration had lower concentrations of vitamins and\nminerals than patients with a normal C-reactive protein\nconcentration (McMillan et al, 2000). Similarly, among\npatients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, those with an\nelevated C-reactive protein concentration had lower con-\ncentrations of selenium than those with a normal C-reactive\nprotein concentration (Sattar et al, 1997).\nRecently, the relationships between C-reactive protein\nconcentration and concentrations of carotenoids were\nexamined using NHANES III data (Kritchevsky et al, 2000).\nThe authors limited their analysis to participants aged 25\u00ad\n55 y. The inverse association between b-carotene concentra-\ntion and C-reactive protein concentration in NHANES III\ndata was subsequently the focus of another report (Erlinger\net al, 2001). Our analysis of the entire NHANES III extends\nthese findings to a broader set of participants. In addition,\nwe explored several possible sources of effect modification\nincluding age, sex, smoking status, and body mass index.\nFurthermore, results of a recent analysis of NHANES III data\nalso demonstrated an inverse association between concen-\ntrations of serum retinol and C-reactive protein in children\nand adults (Stephensen & Gildengorin, 2000).\nThe method used to measure C-reactive protein concen-\ntration in NHANES III is not a sensitive one, and, therefore, a\nlarge number of participants had concentrations below the\ndetection limit of 3.0 mg/l. This limited our ability to explore\nthe full range of the associations of C-reactive protein\nconcentrations and circulating concentrations of vitamins,\ncarotenoids, and selenium.\nSince this is a cross-sectional study, the directionality of\nthe associations is uncertain. Thus, inflammation could\ndepress concentrations of some vitamins, carotenoids, and\nselenium. Both endogenous and exogenous sources of\nantioxidants serve to counteract the reactive oxygen species,\nproduced during the inflammatory process, limiting or\npreventing cellular or subcellular damage. Unless the pools\nof antioxidants are augmented by increased intake or\nproduction, the increase in reactive oxygen species from\ninflammation may deplete these pools resulting in lower\nconcentrations of antioxidants. Findings of a study of\npatients with type II diabetes mellitus which showed no\nchange in C-reactive protein concentration after supplemen-\ntation with tomato juice, a rich source of lycopene, support\nthis explanation (Upritchard et al, 2000). It would be of\ninterest to know whether trials of antioxidant supplementa-\ntion were more effective among those with an elevated C-\nreactive protein concentration. Triggers of the acute-phase\nresponse result in transient decreases of serum retinol\nconcentration and retinol binding protein (Filteau, 1999;\nThe alternative explanation that higher antioxidant con-\ncentrations could reduce inflammation deserves considera-\ntion. Sufficient supplies of antioxidants could conceivably\nmitigate the inflammatory process. Reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) and lipid peroxidation can promote the production of\nproinflammatory cytokines. By neutralizing excess concen-\ntrations of ROS, increased concentrations of antioxidants\ncould directly reduce one stimulus for increases in proin-\nflammatory cytokines and indirectly reduce a second\nstimulus by reducing lipid peroxidation. For example,\noxidized LDL cholesterol is a stimulus of inflammation\nprevent or reduce the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, some of\nthe inflammatory stimulus could be reduced. In addition,\nantioxidants may prevent the activation of the transcription\nfactor nuclear factor-kB, which has been shown to affect the\nexpression of genes that promote inflammation (Valen et al,\n2001). Thus, adequate antioxidant concentration may be\nespecially critical early in people's lives when atherosclerosis\nis initiated.\nAdditional studies are needed to examine the relationships\nbetween concentrations of inflammatory markers and anti-\noxidants and to determine the causal relationships under-\nlying these associations. For example, supplementation\nstudies among people with elevated C-reactive protein\nconcentrations may reveal whether antioxidants have an\neffect on the inflammatory process and if they do, which\nones are more likely to be effective. Dietary studies may also\nprovide valuable insights into how dietary factors may\ndirectly affect the inflammatory process or limit the damage\nit causes. Data showing that antioxidants and foods rich in\nantioxidants limit the inflammatory process or its secondary\neffects would provide additional support for current recom-\nmendations regarding fruit and vegetable intake.\nReferences\nBerliner JA, Navab M, Fogelman AM, Frank JS, Demer LL, Edwards\nPA, Watson AD & Lusis AJ (1995): Atherosclerosis: basic\nC-reactive protein concentration\nES Ford et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nmechanisms Oxidation, inflammation, and genetics.
