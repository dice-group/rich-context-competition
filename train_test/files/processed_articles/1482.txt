    "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Objective. To determine gun storage\npractices in gun-owning households with children.\nDesign. National random digit-dial telephone survey\nwith children <18 years old in which a respondent re-\nported either: 1) personally owning a gun, or 2) living in\na gun-owning household but not owning a gun them-\nselves. Respondents were asked whether any household\ngun was currently stored loaded, and, if yes, whether any\ngun was currently stored loaded and unlocked.\nResults. Twenty-one percent of gun owners com-\npared with 7% of nonowners reported that a household\ngun was stored loaded, while 9% and 2%, respectively,\nreported that a household gun was stored loaded and\nunlocked. Nongun owners were significantly more likely\nthan were gun owners to be female (87% vs 22%) and to\nreport that they lived in a house with only 1 gun (70% vs\nports of actual gun owners (n  252), households with\nchildren <13 years old were significantly less likely to\nstore a gun loaded and unlocked (multivariate odds ratio:\n.1; 95% confidence interval: .0,.4) than were households\nwith teenagers only.\nConclusions. We find that among gun-owning house-\nholds with children, nongun owners report significantly\nlower rates of guns stored loaded and unlocked than do\ngun owners. These findings are consistent with recent\nstudies that have found that married men are far more\nlikely to report household gun ownership than are mar-\nried women, and that gun users are far more likely to\nreport that a gun is stored loaded or loaded and unlocked\nthan are never users. Our findings suggest that nongun\nowners, the vast majority of whom are women (87%),\nmay be unaware that guns in their homes are stored in a\nmanner that experts agree is unsafe.\nOur findings reinforce the importance of many pedia-\ntricians' current efforts to offer anticipatory guidance\nabout firearms to gun-owning families, and, in addition,\nsuggest that this guidance can be adapted depending on\nwhether the physician is speaking with a gun-owning or\nnongun-owning parent. In particular, because gun own-\ners (mostly fathers) are less likely to bring children to the\npediatrician's office than are nonowners (mostly moth-\ners), physicians should take advantage of any opportuni-\nties that they have to address gun-related issues with\nparents who personally own guns. More commonly, phy-\nsicians can encourage nongun owners to participate more\nfully in household decision-making about gun storage\nby letting them know not only about recommended stor-\nage practices, but also that many nonowners may not\nknow how guns are actually stored in their own homes.\ncgi/content/full/106/3/e31; firearm, storage, children, sur-\nvey.\nABBREVIATIONS.

In each of those same\nthemselves with guns and another 290 died acciden-\ntally. Including deaths from homicide, firearms were\nthe second leading cause of death (behind motor\nyears old1 over these years.\nRecent evidence suggests that 75% of the fire-\narms used in childhood and adolescent suicide at-\ntempts and accidental shootings are stored in the\nhome of the victim or in the home of a relative or\nfriend.2 In the one study to address the issue directly,\nthe most common scenario for the fatal accidental\nshooting of a child was the child playing with a\nloaded and unlocked firearm.3 Even among adoles-\ncents with no apparent psychiatric disorder, loaded\nhousehold firearms seem to be associated with a\nhigher risk for suicide.4 Implementation of laws de-\nsigned to encourage safe storage by holding gun\nowners responsible for how their guns are stored in\nthe event a child is injured with a gun are associated\nwith decreases in rates of accidental firearm deaths.5\nExperts from the National Rifle Association to the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics agree that guns\nshould be stored in a way that limits access by chil-\nTo understand and respond to the problem of\nchildhood firearm injury--especially suicides and\naccidents--it is important to have good estimates of\nchildren's exposure to firearms. This requires infor-\nmation on, among other things, the number of gun-\nowning households with children and how those\nguns are stored. Unfortunately, traditional means of\nascertaining household exposure to firearms through\ntelephone surveys may be inadequate if some house-\nhold adults have incomplete or inaccurate informa-\ntion regarding household guns. Recent studies have\nfound that when a single member of a multiadult\nhousehold is interviewed: 1) married men are far\nFrom Harvard Injury Control Research Center, Harvard School of Public\nHealth, Boston, Massachusetts.\nReprint requests to (D.A.)

Of the\n10 774 telephone numbers that were randomly selected, calls to\n2588 yielded contact with households that were determined to be\neligible (E) for the survey. Sixty-seven of these households (3%)\ndeclined to participate, yielding 2521 households that completed\nthe survey (C). Two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine num-\nbers were ineligible (I), because they were not working or were not\nresidential, and the eligibility of 5397 was not known (U, eg,\nbecause there was no answer). Using a Council of the American\nSurvey Research Organization formula [C/(E  (E/E  I)*U)], we\ncalculated a response rate for our survey of 49%.12 This response\nrate is comparable to that of other national surveys on firearm\nownership9 and falls within the response rates for most Behavioral\nRisk Factor Survey firearm modules.13\nUsing techniques developed by Waksberg,14 telephone num-\nbers were randomly generated to include households with listed\nand unlisted numbers. The random digit-dial technique is de-\nsigned to ensure an equal, unbiased probability of inclusion in the\nsample of all households with a single telephone line. Once a\ntelephone number had been randomly selected for inclusion in the\nsurvey sample, as many as 10 repeat phone calls were made to\nscreen the selected household. Respondents were told that all their\nanswers were completely confidential, and neither names nor\naddresses were recorded.\nNo 1 adult from each household was interviewed. As a result,\nan adult in a single adult household was more likely to be inter-\nviewed than was an adult in a household with 1 adult. Thus, the\nsample is a representative sample of households, not of individ-\nuals. Instead of interviewing the adult who answered the phone or\nwho happened to be home at the time of the call, the study was\ndesigned to select a household adult chosen at random. In prac-\ntice, this meant alternately asking to speak with a man or woman\nliving in the household. If there was no person of the requested\ngender living in the household, the initial respondent was inter-\nviewed.\nThe demographic composition of the sample is fairly similar to\nthat of the adult population described by the 1990 US Census,\nalthough our survey contains fewer poor people (11% vs 20%)\nattributable in part to the requirement that respondents have\ntelephones, more women (58% vs 51%), and not surprisingly given\nour oversampling of women, more households with children 18\nyears old (40% vs 33%). Because the noninstitutionalized popula-\ntion of women is greater than that of men (and single adult\nhouseholds headed by women outnumber those headed by men),\nsampling of women is increased when randomization takes place\nat the household level. Given our sampling technique, men and\nwomen in typical 2-adult households were equally likely to be\nasked to participate; among the excess of single adult households\nheaded by women, however, only women were eligible.\nThis study concerns gun storage among people living with\nchildren 18 years old, so the sample was limited to individuals\nwith children who reported that they or someone else in their\nhousehold currently owned a gun (n  434). The gun ownership\nquestion (\"Do you or does anyone else in your household cur-\nrently own any type of gun?\") was the 11th question of the survey,\nafter questions about the respondent's feelings of personal safety\nand whether they had ever been shot. This household gun own-\nership question was followed by a question about how many guns\nwere owned by household members, and then by \"Do you per-\nsonally own a gun?\" The dependent variable in our analyses is the\nrespondent's answer to 2 questions about household gun storage\npractices: 1) whether any gun in the household was currently\nstored loaded, and, if the respondent answered in the affirmative,\n2) whether any gun was stored both loaded and unlocked.\nIndependent variables include respondent demographics as\nwell as variables reflecting respondents' firearm-related experi-\nence and behavior. Demographic variables include: respondent\nage (50 and 50), gender, race (white or other), community\n(urban, suburban, or rural), region (South or other), education\nand in these households with children 18 years old, an indicator\nfor whether there was any child 13 years old in the household.\nFirearm-related variables include: whether any household gun\nwas a handgun; the total number of guns in the house; whether\nthe respondent had ever received formal firearm training; and for\nrespondents who reported that they personally owned a gun,\nwhether one reason for owning a gun was protection. Additional\nindependent variables are whether the respondent felt safe alone\nin his or her neighborhood at night (very or somewhat safe;\nsomewhat or very unsafe), thought gun injury was a problem in\ntheir community (major problem; minor or no problem), and had\nbeen the victim of a hostile gun display in the past 5 years\n(answered yes to the question: \"In the past 5 years has anyone\nused, displayed or brought out a gun against you in a hostile\nmanner, even if this event did not take place during commission\nof a crime?\" and was not a police officer). The South is defined as\nAlabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Loui-\nsiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South\nCarolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Forty\npeople (9%) did not reveal their income and 31 (7%) declined to\nreport how many guns were in the household. Dummy variables\nfor missing income and missing number of guns were created for\nindividuals with missing responses.\nBivariate analysis is used initially to explore the relationship\nbetween dependent and independent variables, using the 2 test\nfor significant differences in discrete independent variables. In\nmultivariate analyses, logistic regression is used to determine\npotential correlates of gun storage practices, while taking into\naccount potential confounders.\nWe calculate national estimates of household gun storage prac-\ntices by applying survey estimates to the 33 million US house-\nholds with children 18 years old reported in the 1990 Census.\nRESULTS\nhouseholds (n  1053) reported currently owning a\ngun. Of these, 41% (n  434) reported that there were\none or more children 18 years old living in the\nhousehold. Results come from this subsample of 434\nhouseholds (Table 1). Approximately 60% of these\nrespondents reported that a gun in the household\nreported that they did not personally own a gun (n \n182). Individuals who personally owned a gun were\nsignificantly more likely than were nonowners to be\ntrend, P  .05), but otherwise possessed similar de-\nmographic characteristics.\nCompared with gun owners, nonowners were\nmore likely to report that there was only 1 gun in the\n21% of gun owners said that there was currently a\nhousehold gun stored loaded and 9% said that a gun\nwas stored both loaded and unlocked, only 7% of\nnongun owners reported that there was a loaded gun\nin the home and 2% reported that there was a loaded\nand unlocked one (P  .001 and P  .01, respectively;\nBecause we expect that gun owners will have bet-\nter information about their firearms and how they\nare stored than will nongun-owning adults in the\nsame household, we analyze gun storage practices\namong actual gun owners only (n  252; Table 3).\nand those who lived in the South (31% vs 15%; P \n.01) were significantly more likely to store a gun\nloaded, as were those who reported owning a gun\nwhose households contained 1 gun (24% vs 8%;\nCorrelates of keeping a gun loaded and unlocked\nincluded living in a rural community (14% vs 5%;\nP  .001), and reporting that there was a handgun in\nwith children 13 years old were less likely than\nthose with teen-aged children to store a gun loaded\nIn the multivariate analyses, among gun owners,\nwhites (odds ratio [OR: 3.5; 95% confidence interval\n[CI]: 1.1,11.3), and those who lived in the South (OR:\na gun loaded, as were those who reported a house-\nwho reported owning a gun for protection (OR: 3.6;\nysis, those who reported owning a gun for protection\nwere significantly more likely to store a gun loaded\nwith children 13 years old were significantly less\nlikely to store a gun in this fashion (OR: .1; 95% CI:\nDISCUSSION\nThis survey provides current, nationally represen-\ntative data suggesting that in gun-owning house-\nholds with children there is a significant reporting\ngap between those who actually own a gun and\nthose who do not regarding the type, number, and\nstorage status of guns in the home.\nTogether with previous work that found that mar-\nried women underreport household gun owner-\nship,9,10 and that those who do not use guns are more\nlikely than gun users to report that firearms are\nstored securely,11 our findings suggest that surveys\nthat rely on the reporting of a household member\nchosen at random may generate underestimates of\nboth firearm ownership and the prevalence of fire-\narms stored loaded or loaded and unlocked.\nAssuming that respondents are answering honestly,\nour findings suggest that a troubling information gap\nlies behind the reporting gap. Nongun owners (87% of\nwhom are women) may be unaware that there is a gun\nin the house at all; even if they know a gun is present,\nthey may be unaware that it is stored in a manner that\nexperts agree is unsafe. Without good information re-\ngarding household firearms, the ability of these non-\nowners to participate in decision-making regarding\nhousehold guns, to take reasonable precautions regard-\ning those guns, or to safeguard their children from\nthem may be compromised.\nGiven the reporting gap, our analysis of the corre-\nlates of various gun storage practices relies on the\nreports of actual gun owners only (n  252). In our\nsample of gun-owning households with children,\n21% of gun owners reported that a firearm in the\nhouse was stored loaded and 9% that it was stored\nloaded and unlocked. These estimates are compara-\nble to those from other surveys that interviewed gun\nowners only.15 The estimates are generally higher\nthan those from surveys in which a household mem-\nber who may not have personally owned a gun was\nOur study is consistent with others that have\nfound that among gun owners those who own hand-\nTABLE 1.

We also\nfound that individuals living in the South and whites\nwere more likely to store a gun loaded.\nAlthough the risk of firearm death is far greater\namong older children, having younger children at\nhome was associated with safer gun storage practices\namong gun owners no matter how we defined\nyounger (from age 8 years and under to age 14 years\nand under; data not shown). Compared with house-\nholds with teenagers only, for example, gun owners\nin households with younger children were signifi-\ncantly less likely to store a gun loaded and unlocked,\nperhaps because they believe that younger children\nare more susceptible to firearm accidents or do not\nbelieve that gun storage effectively limits access to\nfirearms for older children.\nConsistent with some studies,20,21 but not with\nothers,22\u00ad24 in our larger sample of gun owners with\nTABLE 3.

In contrast, and consistent with an in-\nformation gap rather than reporting bias, the gun\nstorage practices reported by nongun owners in\nhouseholds with guns seem to be largely insensitive\nto the presence of children, despite the fact that the\nmajority of nonowners are women (8% without chil-\ndren reported storing a gun loaded, while 7% with\nchildren did; 3% without children reported storing a\ngun loaded and unlocked, while 2% with children\ndid; data not shown).\nSurveys have various limitations. Telephone sur-\nveys are subject to both random and systematic er-\nror.25 For example, there is random sampling error\nassociated with all population estimates (eg, 6% for\na population proportion of 50% in a sample of 252)\nand systematic error associated with the fact that\nindividuals without telephones are underrepre-\nsented.26 In addition, self-report data are subject to\npotential inaccuracies attributable to social desirabil-\nity responses, recall bias, intentional distortions, or\nnoncandid responses.27\nIt is possible that among adults in households with\nguns, nongun-owning men have more accurate in-\nformation about guns than do nongun-owning\nwomen. Because of the small number of male non-\nowners in our sample (n  23), however, we lack the\nstatistical power to disentangle the relationship be-\ntween gender and ownership in the reports of non-\ngun owners about gun storage.\nIn our sample, it is possible that some respondents\nmay have intentionally misreported the storage sta-\ntus of guns in their households. If the propensity to\nmisreport affects gun owners and nongun owners\ndifferently, some part of the large difference in re-\nported gun storage may reflect this reporting bias.\nIn addition, the survey did not ask how many\nadults lived in each interviewed household. There-\nfore, it is possible that some of what we attribute to\nan information gap between nongun owners (who\nwe assume live with at least 1 other adult) and gun\nowners (who may or may not live with another\nadult) is instead attributable to different storage pat-\nterns among adults in single versus multiple adult\nhouseholds. To assess the sensitivity of our results to\nthis possibility, we used household composition data\nfrom the US Census that indicate that 95% of men\nand 80% of women in households with children live\nwith a spouse. If, for example, we assume that all 5%\nand all 20% of single adult gun-owning households\nstore their guns loaded (biasing our results strongly\ntoward the null), and remove these households from\nour analyses of reporting differences, the reporting\ngap persists, with 13% of gun owners but only 7% of\nnonowners reporting that a household gun is stored\nloaded.\nAn ideal study might have interviewed all house-\nhold members--when the others were not present--\nallowing for the comparison of reporting of gun-\nowning and nongun-owning adults in the same\nhousehold. On all reported demographics except\ngender and age, nongun owners and gun owners in\nour survey seem similar, however, suggesting that\ncomparisons between them are reasonable.\nOf the 1000 households with children in our\nlarger survey, 43% contained guns. Applying this\n43% figure to the 33 million households with chil-\ndren 18 years old in the United States, 14 million\nof these households contain guns. Based on the re-\nports of respondents who personally own a gun, 21%\n(or 3 million) of these households contain a gun that\nis stored loaded and 9% (or 1.3 million) a gun that is\nstored loaded and unlocked.\nOther studies have found a large reporting differ-\nential between men and women concerning whether\nthere is a gun in the household. We find a large\nreporting differential between gun owners (generally\nmen) and nongun owners (overwhelmingly women)\nconcerning how the firearm is stored. Assuming that\nrespondents are trying to answer honestly, the re-\nsults indicate that nongun owners (87% women) in\n2-adult households often do not know that there is a\ngun in their home, and when they do know, they\nbelieve--incorrectly--that it is stored safely. This can\nbe a particular problem when, as for our respon-\ndents, there are children in the home. Gun storage\npractices in the United States may be one reason that,\nfor 5- to 14-year-olds, our unintentional firearm\ndeath rate is 9 times and our firearm suicide rate 10\ntimes higher than those of other developed coun-\nOur findings reinforce the importance of many\npediatricians' current efforts to offer anticipatory\nguidance about firearms to gun-owning families,\nand, in addition, suggest that this guidance can be\nadapted depending on whether the physician is\nspeaking with a gun-owning or nongun-owning par-\nent. In particular, because gun owners (mostly fa-\nthers) are less likely to bring children to the pedia-\ntrician's office than are nonowners (mostly mothers),\nphysicians should take advantage of any opportuni-\nties that they have to address gun-related issues with\nparents who personally own guns. More commonly,\nphysicians can encourage nongun owners to partic-\nipate more fully in household decision-making about\ngun storage by letting them know not only about\nrecommended storage practices, but also that many\nnonowners may not know how guns are actually\nstored in their own homes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported in part by the Harvard University\nPhD Program in Health Policy, the Department of Health Policy\nand Management of the Harvard School of Public Health, and by\ngrants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the\nNational Institute of Justice, the Joyce Foundation, the Soros Foun-\ndation, the Packard Foundation, the Annie E.
