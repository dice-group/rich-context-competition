Indeed, ambivalence, the simultaneous experience of\npositive and negative feelings, is common in the parent\u00ad\nchild tie due to conflicting desires for independence and\nmidlife and older parents report some ambivalence toward\ntheir grown children (Fingerman, Hay, & Birditt, 2004;\nPillemer & Suitor, 2002). Although middle-aged and older\nparents report greater ambivalence toward offspring who\nhave not achieved adult milestones (e.g., marriage) and\nolder mothers report more ambivalence regarding problem-\natic children (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz,\nnot explicitly examined whether children's problems and\nachievements help explain midlife men's and women's feel-\nings of ambivalence toward those children. Parents may feel\ngreater ambivalence regarding problematic children (e.g.,\ntrouble with the law and illness) and less successful chil-\ndren (e.g., career success) due to their continuing depen-\ndence and violation of adult status attainment norms\n(Aldous,Klaus,&Klein,1985;Pillemer,Sechrist,Steinhour,\n& Suitor, 2007). Problematic children provide less care\nto parents (Cicirelli, 1983), they cause parental distress\ntend to drain parents' resources (Aldous et al.), and they\nare parents' least preferred support providers (Pillemer &\nSuitor, 2002). In contrast, successful children (e.g., doing\nwell in their relationships and career) may increase\nparents' well-being and provide more support to parents\n(Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009; Ryff, Lee, Essex,\nAmbivalence theory provides a useful framework for un-\nderstanding the complexity of the parent\u00adchild relationship\nand adult children's problems and successes. Ambivalence\nrefers to the simultaneous experience of positive and nega-\ntive sentiments about the same relationship (Luescher &\nPillemer, 1998). The present study defines ambivalence as\nreporting positive and negative relationship quality regard-\ning the same child. Individuals experience ambivalence\nwhen there are incompatible norms or expectations that\ncause contradictory emotions or beliefs (Merton & Barber,\n1963). Parents experience ambivalence due to competing\ndesires to launch their children into adulthood and to sup-\nport to children in need (e.g., children with problems).\nIt is particularly important to identify predictors of am-\nbivalence because ambivalence is associated with greater\ndepression, lower quality of life, and poorer health among\nparents (Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,\nin this area has examined older mother's reports and often\nreports of only one child. This study seeks to understand\nwhether middle-aged women and men differentiate among\ntheir children in terms of their successes and problems and\nwhether these differentiations are associated with ambiva-\nlence. This study examines (a) within-individual variations\nin reports of adult children's problems, successes, and am-\nbivalence among middle-aged women and men and (b) im-\nplications of problems and successes for intergenerational\nambivalence among middle-aged women and men. This re-\nsearch has practical implications because it may provide\ninsights into how to improve the parent\u00adchild relationship\nas parents grow older and in greater need of support from\nthese ties.\nAdult Children's Problems and Successes: Implications\nfor Intergenerational Ambivalence\nKira S. Birditt,1 Karen L. Fingerman,2 and Steven H. Zarit3\n1Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan.\n2Child Development & Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\n3Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennyslvania.\nAmbivalence theory suggests that parents experience ambivalence due to conflicting desires to help children in\nneed and to launch children into adulthood. This study examined parents' reports of their adult children's prob-\nlems and successes and implications for ambivalence. Participants aged 40\u00ad60 years (302 men and 331 women\nfrom different families) reported on up to 3 of their adult children (N = 1,251). Men and women differentiated\namong children in ratings of problems, successes, and ambivalence. Men and not women reported greater\nambivalence regarding children with more physical\u00ademotional problems and less career success. Men and women\nreported greater ambivalence regarding children with less relationship success. Consistent with ambivalence the-\nory, individuals feel more ambivalent regarding problematic and less successful children but men's ambivalence\nappears to be more sensitive to their children's problems and successes than women's ambivalence.\nKey Words: Ambivalence--Gender--Intergenerational relations--Problems--Successes.\nBirditt et al.\nProblems and successes defined\nIdentifying problems among children often involves distin-\nguishing between less controllable physical\u00ademotional prob-\nlems and more controllable lifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems\nPhysical\u00ademotional problems include health problems, devel-\nopmental disabilities, and mental health issues. In contrast,\nlifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems include financial trouble, drug\nand alcohol abuse, and trouble with the law. Research sug-\ngests that mothers evaluate grown children with physical\u00ad\nemotional problems more favorably, whereas they view\nchildren with lifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems with greater am-\nTo assess children's successes, researchers have typically\nexamined social roles, such as whether children are married\nor employed full time. The importance parents place on dif-\nferent roles varies as a function of their own values (Ryff\net al., 1994) and the child's age. Thus, in the present study,\nrather than examining the presence or absence of roles, we\nexamined middle-aged parents' ratings of how successful\nthey believed their children were in their careers and rela-\ntionships compared with other children of their age.\nThis study examines parents' ratings of their children's\nproblems and successes simultaneously because parents\nmay hold complex and orthogonal beliefs about each of\ntheir children's successes and problems in a family. For ex-\nample, a child with problems may experience success in\nsome areas and less successful children do not necessarily\nhave problems.\nDifferentiations among children\nPrior work on child problems and ambivalence has fo-\ncused mostly on older mothers and often reports of one child\nOlder mothers differentiate among their children in ratings\nof emotional closeness, the types of support they prefer to\nreceive, and the support they provide to children (Suitor,\nent study, we examine whether middle-aged men and women\ndifferentiate among their children in ratings of problems,\nsuccesses, and ambivalence. Examining within-parent dif-\nferentiations allows us to assess whether characteristics of\nthe children contribute to parents' ratings of problems and\nsuccesses rather than only parent characteristics.\nWe also consider whether women and men vary in the ex-\ntent to which they differentiate among their children. Because\nmothers' relationships with children are often closer and in-\nvolve more contact, women may differentiate more among\nImplications of problems and successes for\nambivalence\nParents may feel more ambivalent regarding problematic\nchildren and less successful children due to their lack of in-\ndependence, needs for support, violation of normative expec-\ntations, and elicitation of embarrassment (Pillemer & Suitor,\n1991). In contrast, more successful children may provide a\nsource of pride, well-being, and reduced ambivalence.\nSome studies report no associations between problems\nand ambivalence (Pillemer & Suitor, 2002), and others\nshow that problems predict greater ambivalence. Pillemer,\nSuitor, and colleagues (2007) found that mothers report\ngreater ambivalence regarding children with more lifestyle\u00ad\nbehavioral and physical\u00ademotional problems. However,\nother studies suggest that parents differentiate between\nproblems; mothers report feeling closest to children who\nhave physical\u00ademotional problems but the least close to\nchildren who have lifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems (e.g., sub-\nstance abuse and trouble with the law; Suitor & Pillemer,\n2000). It is not clear whether these findings regarding close-\nness also apply to feelings of ambivalence.\nFurthermore, women and men may experience children's\nproblems and successes differently. Women's feelings of\nambivalence may be more highly associated with children's\nproblems and successes than mens' feelings of ambivalence\n(Nelson et al., 2007). Mothers of young adult children with\nmental illness experience more emotional distress than do\nfathers (Cook, 1988). Similarly, older mothers experience\nmore stress related to their children's problems compared\nwith fathers (Greenberg & Becker, 1988). Women may pos-\nsess more of a success orientation to children and experi-\nence greater impact of children's issues than men who\nblame children for problems (McBride & Black, 1984).\nMothers may also experience a more detrimental impact\ndue to their greater investment in the tie (Rossi & Rossi,\n1990). Other studies, however, reveal no gender differences\nin associations between child problems and parental rela-\ntionship perceptions (Greenfield & Marks, 2006).\nOther factors influencing the parent\u00adchild tie\nOther child characteristics may influence parents' per-\nceptions of their children. Ambivalence theory suggests\nthat parents feel more ambivalent about children who have\nnot reached adult roles indicative of independence, such as\nemployment, education, and marriage (Fingerman et al.,\nWickrama, 2006). For example, mothers feel greater am-\nbivalence regarding children who are not married (Pillemer,\nSuitor et al., 2007) or who have lower education (Pillemer\n& Suitor, 2005). Individuals also make differentiations\namong their children based on children's gender, age, em-\nployment status, and parental status (Suitor et al., 2006).\nParent characteristics including race, marital status,\nnumber of living children, socioeconomic status (SES)\n(education and income), neuroticism, and self-rated health\nmay differentially influence the parent\u00adchild relationship\n2006). For example, being African American, having more\neducation, scoring higher in neuroticism, and having\nlower self-rated health are associated with greater ambiv-\nalence (Birditt, Rott, & Fingerman, in press; Connidis &\nRelationship characteristics including contact frequency\nand financial dependence also differentially predict ambiva-\nlence. Parents who report greater contact frequency and\ngreater financial support to children often report greater am-\nThe present study included covariates for child, parent,\nand relationship characteristics potentially associated with\nambivalence.\nStudy goals\nThis study addressed the following two questions:\n1.Do women and men differentiate among their children in\ntheir reports of problems, successes, and ambivalence?\nWe predict that individuals make differentiations among\ntheir children in ratings of their problems, successes, and\ngreater variation within individuals regarding each of\ntheir children rather than between individuals. Because\nmothers are often closer to children, we predict that\nwomen differentiate among children more than men.\n2. Are women's and men's reports of problems and suc-\ncesses associated with ambivalence? We predict that indi-\nviduals will report greater ambivalence regarding children\nwith more problems (lifestyle\u00adbehavioral and physical\u00ad\nemotional). We also predict that lifestyle\u00adbehavioral\nproblems and ambivalence are more highly associated\nthan physical\u00ademotional problems and ambivalence\n(Pillemer & Suitor, 2002). We hypothesize that individu-\nals feel less ambivalent about children they rate as more\nsuccessful. We expect that the associations are stronger\namong women than men (Greenberg & Becker, 1988).\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe Family Exchanges Study included 633 individuals\nfamilies) who had at least 1 child aged 18 years or older. We\nrandomly selected participants from phone lists obtained\nthrough Genesys Corporation as well as through random\ndigit dialing from the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (five counties in southeastern Pennsylvania\nand four counties in New Jersey) and stratified by gender\nCenter, 2001).

See Table 1 for a sam-\nple description.\nMeasures\nProblems.--Individuals reported whether their children\nexperienced a series of problems, which we grouped into\ntwo scales: physical\u00ademotional problems and lifestyle\u00ad\nbehavioral problems (Pillemer, Suitor, et al., 2007).\nPhysical\u00ademotional problems included two lifelong prob-\nlems (having a developmental delay or disability and a\nphysical disability) and two problems in the past 2 years\n(a serious health problem or injury and a serious emotional\nor psychological problem). Lifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems\nincluded four problems in the past 2 years: a drinking or\ndrug problem, financial problems, trouble with the law or\npolice, and divorce or other serious relationship problems.\nWe adapted this measure from the National Survey of\nMidlife Development in the United States (MIDUS;\nGreenfield & Marks, 2006). Due to skew in distribution,\nwe summed the number of problems and truncated both\nscores into 0, 1, and 2 or more problems. Each child re-\nceived a score for both types of problems.\nSuccesses.--We adapted items from previous work (Ryff\net al., 1994) to assess parents' perceptions of children's suc-\ncesses with two items (Fingerman et al., 2009). Respon-\ndents indicated how successful they believed that each child\nis compared with others of the same age in two domains,\ncareer (education, work, and career) and relationships\n(romantic relationships and family life), on a 5-point scale\n(1 = less successful, 2 = somewhat less successful, 3 = about\nthe same as other people of his/her age, 4 = somewhat more\nsuccessful, and 5 = more successful than other people of\nhis/her age). Because participants were asked across the\ndomains with only two items rather than each domain sepa-\nrately, there were little missing data on these items.\nChild characteristics.--Individuals reported their child's\ndemographics and social roles. Demographics included\ngender (0 = daughter and 1 = son) and years of education\n(highest grade in school or year of college completed). We\ndichotomized age to distinguish the period of emerging\nadulthood (0 = ages 18\u00ad29) from young to middle adult-\nthe child's marital status (0 = not married and 1 = married\nor remarried), parental status (0 = no children and 1 = one\nor more children), and work status (0 = not employed full\ntime and 1 = employed full time).\nParticipant characteristics.--Participant characteristics\nincluded demographics, health, and neuroticism. Demo-\ngraphics incorporated gender (0 = women and 1 = men),\nrace (0 = non-White and 1 = White), marital status (0 = not\nmarried and 1 = married or remarried), number of living\nchildren, education (highest grade or year of college com-\n(excellent) to 5 (poor). We reverse coded the item so that\nhigher scores represent better health.\nNeuroticism included four items from the MIDUS. Par-\nents indicated how well each of four adjectives (moody,\nworrying, nervous, and calm) described themselves from 1\n(a lot) to 4 (not at all). We reverse coded all items, with the\nexception of calm, so that higher scores represent greater\nneuroticism.\nRelationship characteristics.--We also considered par-\nticipant reports of contact frequency and the financial de-\npendence of the child. Participants rated how often they had\nseen each child in the past 12 months from 1 (daily) to 8\n(less than once a year or never). We reverse coded the item\nso that higher scores represent greater contact. Participants\nreported how often they provided financial support to each\nchild (e.g., giving or loaning money, helping the child pur-\nchase goods, services, insurance, and education) from 1\n(daily) to 8 (less than once a year or never). We reverse\ncoded the item so that higher scores represent greater\nfinancial support.\nAmbivalence.--We combined assessments of positive\nand negative perceptions of the relationship to generate am-\nbivalence scores for each child (Fingerman et al., 2006;\nWillson, Shuey, & Elder, 2003). This indirect approach is\nassociated with other measures of ambivalence (Willson\net al., 2003) and may be more effective than directly asking\nparticipants about their mixed feelings (Pillemer & Suitor,\n2002). Participants may have difficulty directly reporting\ntheir mixed feelings (Luescher & Pillemer, 1998). Thus,\nthis measure reflects ambivalent (mixed) relationship qual-\nity rather than ambivalent (mixed) emotions. The positive\ncomponent included the mean of two items (\"How much\ndoes he/she make you feel loved and cared for\" and \"How\nmuch does he/she understand you\"). The negative compo-\nnent included the mean of two items (\"How much does he/\nshe criticize you\" and \"How much does he/she make de-\nmands on you\"). Participants rated items from 1 (not at all)\nto 5 (a great deal). As in other studies of ambivalence\nGriffin's Similarity and Intensity of Components formula to\ncalculate ambivalence scores: [(positive + negative)/2 -\n|positive - negative|] + 1.5 (Thompson, Zanna, & Griffin,\n1995). Higher scores reflect greater ambivalence.\nAnalysis strategy.--Analyses involved descriptive statis-\ntics and multilevel models. We calculated means and cor-\nrelations among the variables to describe women's and\nmen's reports. Because the data included individual's re-\nports regarding multiple children, we used multilevel mod-\neling to address the issue of dependencies in the data (SAS\nPROC MIXED; Littell, Milliken, Stroup, & Wolfinger,\nindividuals differentiated among their children and whether\nproblems and successes predicted ambivalence. Models in-\ncluded a random effect allowing for correlated errors within\nparticipants. Models included two levels: higher level par-\nticipant characteristics (e.g., gender and race) and lower\nlevel child characteristics (e.g., problems and successes).\nBlank multilevel models without predictors assessed\nhow much of the variance in individuals' ratings of their\nchildren's problems, successes, and feelings of ambiva-\nlence was due to between-person variance versus within-\nperson variance (Singer & Willett, 2003). We estimated\nmodels for each outcome (physical\u00ademotional problems,\nlifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems, career success, relationship\nsuccess, and ambivalence). We then calculated intraclass\ncorrelations by dividing each covariance parameter by the\ntotal variance. To test whether women and men varied in\nhow much they differentiated among children, we com-\npared models in which there were separate between-person\nvariance components estimated for women and men with\nthose in which one variance component was estimated\nacross women and men. We then examined whether there\nwas a significant difference between the fit of the models by\nsubtracting the -2 log likelihood estimations of two models\nand examining the difference on a chi-square distribution\nwith a degree of freedom equaling the change in number of\nparameters (df = 1).\nNext, we estimated multilevel models to examine whether\nambivalence varied by parents' reports of their children's\nproblems and successes. We estimated two models predict-\ning ambivalence for women and men separately. Predictors\nincluded physical\u00ademotional problems, lifestyle\u00adbehavioral\nproblems, career success, and relationship success. Covari-\nates included child characteristics, participant characteris-\ntics, and relationship characteristics.\nTo examine whether models that included problems and\nsuccesses provided improved fit over models with only the\ncovariates, we statistically compared the goodness of fit of\nthe models (Singer & Willett, 2003). The goodness-of-fit\ncomparison involves subtracting the -2 log likelihood esti-\nmations of two models and examining the difference on a\nchi-square distribution with a degree of freedom equaling\nthe change in number of parameters (df = 4).\nResults\nWe present the results in three sections. First, we provide a\ndescription of individuals' reports of their children's prob-\nlems, successes, and ambivalence. Next, we examine be-\ntween- and within-person reports of children's problems,\nsuccesses, and ambivalence. Finally, we examine associations\namong children's problems, successes, and ambivalence.\nDescription of Individual's Reports Regarding Children\nIndividuals reported that each child experienced an aver-\nlems. In other words, middle-aged parents reported that ap-\nproximately 18.5% of offspring had physical or emotional\nproblems and 35.2% had one or more lifestyle-behavioral\nproblems. Physical\u00ademotional problems and lifestyle\u00ad\n\nbehavioral problems were positively correlated (r = .21).\nThe most frequently reported problems within each cate-\ngory included mental health problems (8%) and financial\ntrouble (26%). On average, parents rated their children as\nslightly above their age-mates in career success (M = 3.50,\nSD = 1.17) and as similar to peers in relationship success (M\nratings of success and problems.

Problems, career success, and ambiva-\nlence did not vary by parental gender.\nBetween- and Within-Person Reports of Problems\nand Successes\nThe next analyses tested the extent to which individuals\ndifferentiated among their children and whether women\nmade greater differentiations among children than men.\nTable 2 includes the intraclass correlations representing the\nproportion of variance between and within women and men.\nConsistent with the first hypothesis, we found greater with-\nin-person variance in how parents viewed their children\nthan between-person variance. Inconsistent with the second\nhypothesis, women and men made similar differentiations\namong their children. There were no significant differences\nin the fit of models in which separate between-person vari-\nance components were estimated for women and men and\nBirditt et al.\nthe models in which only one between-person variance\ncomponent was estimated (Table 2).\nAssociations Among Problems, Successes, and\nAmbivalence\nTable 3 includes the multilevel models predicting am-\nbivalence as a function of the covariates in the first column,\nfollowed by a multilevel model predicting ambivalence as a\nfunction of problems, successes, and covariates in the sec-\nond column. The models with problems and successes as\npredictors of ambivalence provided a significantly better fit\nthan those with only the covariates as predictors of ambiva-\nlence (Table 3).\nAs we hypothesized, children's problems were associated\nwith greater ambivalence. Men reported greater ambivalence\nregarding children with more physical\u00ademotional problems.\nSomewhat surprisingly, there were no associations between\nlifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems and ambivalence and no as-\nsociations between problems and ambivalence among\nwomen. As expected, women and men reported greater am-\nbivalence regarding children with less relationship success.\nHowever, only men and not women reported greater ambiv-\nalence about children with less career success.\nAmbivalence also varied by participant, child, and rela-\ntionship characteristics. Participants reported greater am-\nbivalence when they had higher levels of neuroticism and\nmore education and gave more financial support to off-\nspring. Participants also reported greater ambivalence re-\ngarding daughters than sons. Women who reported more\ncontact frequency with children reported greater ambiva-\nlence, and men reported greater ambivalence regarding\nyounger offspring. Because individuals' opinions of chil-\ndren may vary depending on children's age, we also exam-\nined interactions among age of child, problems, and\nsuccesses as predictors of ambivalence and found no sig-\nnificant interactions.\nAs an alternative way of examining the implications of\nchild problems and successes for ambivalence, we explored\nwhether children's problems and successes were differen-\ntially associated with the positive and negative components\nof ambivalence. According to ambivalence theory, parents\nmay perceive problematic and less successful children as\nmore positive and more negative. We estimated multilevel\nmodels with problems, successes, and covariates as the pre-\ndictors and positive and negative components of ambiva-\nlence as the outcomes. Women reported greater negative\nperceptions of children with lifestyle\u00adbehavioral problems\native perceptions of children with physical\u00ademotional prob-\nreported more positive perceptions regarding children with\nSE = 0.03, p < .01, respectively) and relationship success\nrespectively).\nDiscussion\nThe present study examined men's and women's reports\nof their children's problems and successes and whether\nproblems and successes predict ambivalence. This study\nshowed, not unexpectedly, that parents differentiated among\ntheir children in their ratings of problems, successes, and\nambivalence. We also build on and extend findings of previ-\nous studies that either only examined older women's per-\nceptions of ambivalence or examined ambivalence toward a\nsingle child. Including parents' opinions of up to three chil-\ndren, we found that parents' perceptions of a child's prob-\nlems and successes were related to ambivalent feelings and\nthat the specific patterns of associations differed between\nmen and women. Thus, ambivalence toward grown children\nis a common experience for men and women, and these\nfeelings reflect in varying degrees children's lack of success\nand/or problems due to more controllable and less control-\nlable factors.\nDo Women and Men Differentiate Among Children?\nWe found greater variation in parents' ratings of their dif-\nferent children's problems, successes, and ambivalence than\nTable 2.

We reiterate that our sample did not in-\nclude mothers and fathers from the same family, but rather\nthe men and women were not related. Given this sampling\napproach, the findings show that there is greater variation\nwithin a parent regarding each of his or her own children than\nbetween different unrelated parents regarding their children.\nWomen and men made similar differentiations in their\nratings of children. We had hypothesized that women would\nmake greater differentiations among children than men due\nto their greater emotional closeness and emotional intensity\nwith children (Rossi & Rossi, 1990). More recent literature\nhas found a lack of variation between mothers and fathers\nwithin the same families in several key variables, including\nambivalence and tensions (Birditt, Miller, Fingerman, &\nfewer gender differences in more recent cohorts as women\nand men take on more similar roles. The issues in adulthood\nmay be more gender neutral (as compared with adoles-\ncence) and may elicit fewer gender differences. For exam-\nple, gender intensification theory suggests that children\nexperience an intensification of gender roles during adoles-\ncence, which coincides with greater sex-typed parental so-\nDo Children's Problems and Successes Relate to\nPerceptions of Ambivalence?\nAmbivalence theory suggests that parents experience\ncompeting desires to launch their children into an indepen-\ndent adulthood, yet conversely to help children in need of\nsupport (e.g., children with problems). Thus, we predicted\nthat women and men would feel more ambivalent about\nchildren with more problems but found only partial support\nfor this hypothesis. Ambivalence did not vary by lifestyle\u00ad\nbehavioral problems, and men (but not women) reported\ngreater ambivalence regarding children who had physical\u00ad\nemotional problems. Fathers may have a more difficult time\naccepting children with developmental delays, which may\nmanifest as ambivalence regarding young adult children\n(Price-Bonham & Addison, 1978). It is possible that men\nexperience more long-term ambivalence about children\nwith disabilities than do women.\nWe were somewhat surprised that children's problems did\nnot predict greater ambivalence among women given past\nresearch. Pillemer, Suitor, and colleagues (2007) found that\nmothers rated children with more problems with more am-\nbivalence. There were several variations between our stud-\nies. Pillemer, Suitor, and colleagues examined mothers aged\n65\u00ad75 years and four types of problems (serious illness or\ninjury, serious mental or emotional problem, problems with\ndrinking or drugs, and problems with the law) and used a\ndirect assessment of ambivalence. Older mother's feelings\nof ambivalence may be more highly associated with their\noffspring's problems than younger mother's feelings. In-\ndeed, as mothers age, they may become more ambivalent\nabout problematic children due to their own age-related in-\ncreased needs for support. We examined problems ranging\nTable 3.

Finally, direct assessments of ambivalence may re-\nflect more negative sentiments because participants report\nhow torn they feel rather than both positive and negative\nqualities separately. These studies also vary in their geo-\ngraphic locations; however, there is little variation in the\nparent\u00adchild tie between U.S. regions (Sechrist, Suitor,\nWe also found support for the hypothesis that individuals\nfeel more ambivalent about less successful children. Women\nand men reported more ambivalence about children with less\nrelationship success. Similarly, parents favor unmarried chil-\ndren less than those who are married (Brackbill, Kitch, &\nNoffsinger, 1988). Relationship success also involved the\nparent's rating of children's success in romantic relationships\nand family life, which may subsume the parent\u00adchild tie and\nhave direct links with ambivalence. Men reported more am-\nbivalence about children who were less successful in their\ncareers. Men may experience higher expectations for their\nchildren's career success than do women. Men may have had\nchildren who were less successful than women; however,\nmen and women reported similar levels of career success.\nThe examination of the positive and negative components\nof ambivalence allowed for a nuanced examination of par-\nents' perceptions. Parents perceived children with problems\nmore negatively but no less positively. In contrast, parents\nperceived their more successful children as more positive\nbut not necessarily as less negative. These findings reveal\nambivalence by showing that positive and negative percep-\ntions of relationships are not mutually exclusive.\nFuture Directions\nThere are several future research directions to consider.\nBecause of the cross-sectional design, the direction of the\nlinks among ambivalence, problems, and successes is un-\nclear and most likely bidirectional. Future research should\nexamine these linkages over time. Future studies should ex-\namine mothers' and fathers' reports of problems and suc-\ncesses in the same families as well as the offspring's\nperspective. Indeed, parents underestimate children's prob-\nlems (Suitor & Pillemer, 2000). Children's problems may\ncontribute to lower parental well-being because of the over-\nall strain of those problems on the relationship, and future\nstudies should consider these links (Greenfield & Marks,\n2006). Despite few regional differences in the parent\u00adchild\ntie (e.g., Sechrist et al., 2007), future work should consider\nthese associations nationally.\nThis study has clinical and gerontological implications.\nAmbivalence predicts lower quality of life, more depressive\nsymptoms, and lower self-rated health (Fingerman et al.,\nfactors associated with greater ambivalence and the gender\ndifferences. Indeed, men with problematic and less suc-\ncessful children may be particularly vulnerable. Clinicians\nshould consider the social context of adults as they age and\nhow their family members may have positive as well as\nnegative influences. In addition, parents and children who\napproach problems with constructive rather than avoidant\nor destructive strategies report lower ambivalence (Birditt\net al., in press). Thus, considering how parents and children\ncope with children's problems, and lack of successes may\nhelp reduce the impact of problems and successes on am-\nbivalence. As parents grow older and are more in need of\nsupport, problematic and less successful children may be-\ncome even more detrimental to parents.\nBecause men and women reported on multiple children,\nthis study allowed for an examination of parental percep-\ntions as a function of children's characteristics over and\nabove parent characteristics. Including men in the study re-\nvealed that men's feelings of ambivalence were more sensi-\ntive to their young adult's problems and successes than\nwomen. Middle-aged men may have higher expectations for\ntheir adult children than women. This study also revealed\nthat although parents may feel more negative about children\nwith problems, they feel no less positive regarding those\nchildren. Likewise, parents generally reported feeling more\npositive and no less negative regarding their successful chil-\ndren. Parents' feelings about their children are multifaceted\nand may have important implications for well-being and\nsupport exchange across adulthood, especially among men.\nFunding\nIntergenerational Transfers\" from the National Institute of Aging.
