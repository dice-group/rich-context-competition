Face-to-face interviews and biomeasure col-\nlection took place in respondents' homes. Data collection\nelicited (a) demographic characteristics, (b) social networks,\n(c) social and cultural activity, (d) physical and mental\nhealth including cognition, (e) well-being, (f) illness, (g)\nmedications and alternative therapies, (h) history of sexual\nand intimate partnerships, and (i) patient\u00adphysician com-\nmunication. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging\nProject (NSHAP) also collected important health informa-\ntion in the home, prioritizing noninvasive collection tech-\nniques and cutting edge technology that minimizes\nrespondent burden. The NSHAP interview included the col-\nlection of 13 biomeasures: weight, waist circumference,\nheight, blood pressure, smell, saliva collection, taste, a self-\nadministered vaginal swab for female respondents, \"Get Up\nand Go,\" distance vision, touch, oral mucosal transudate\n(OMT; Orasure Technologies/Inc, Bethlehem, PA) test for\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and blood spots.\nNSHAP grew from a history of survey research in health\nand aging. Prior to NSHAP, data documenting the sexual prac-\ntices of persons older than 57 years, using representative sam-\nples of the United States, were limited. The National Health\nand Social Life Survey (NHSLS; Laumann, Gagnon, Michael,\ncago Health and Social Life Survey (CHSLS; Laumann, El-\nlingson, Mahay, Paik, & Youm, 2004) gathered data from\nprobability-based representative samples of adult households,\nsurveys laid the methodological groundwork for NSHAP.\nBuilding on methodology and lessons learned from the\nNHSLS and the CHSLS, this article describes how the com-\nplex design described in the article by O'Muircheartaigh in\nthis issue was operationalized with the development of the\nNSHAP Wave I instruments, protocols, and the administra-\ntion of field operations. Table 1 highlights the important\nmilestone field dates from the start of the project through to\nthe end of data collection.\nMethods\nThe NSHAP team faced considerable challenges in de-\nveloping the instruments and protocols required for the col-\nlection of questionnaire and biomeasure data. This section\nof the article describes how the team successfully integrated\neach of these components so that the data were collected\nefficiently, cost-effectively, and with appropriate quality.\nInstrument and Biomeasure Protocol Development\nNSHAP Wave I administration consisted of an in-home\nquestionnaire, biomeasure collection, and a self-adminis-\ntered postinterview or \"leave-behind\" questionnaire. All\nquestionnaires and survey materials were developed in Eng-\nlish and translated into Spanish.\nDevelopment process for the questionnaire.--The re-\nsearch staff met regularly over the course of several months\nInstrument Development, Study Design Implementation,\nand Survey Conduct for the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project\nStephen Smith,1 Angela Jaszczak,1 Jessica Graber,3 Katie Lundeen,1 Sara Leitsch,1 Erin Wargo,1\nand Colm O'Muircheartaigh1,2\n1National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, Illinois.\n2The Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago, Illinois.\n3Formerly with NORC, now with National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland.\nThe National Opinion Research Center, led by a team of investigators at the University of Chicago, conducted more\nthan 3,000 in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of adults aged 57\u00ad85 years. Data collection\nincluded in-person questionnaire items, an extensive array of biomeasures, and a postinterview self-administered\nquestionnaire. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) interview included the collection of 13\nbiomeasures: weight, waist circumference, height, blood pressure, smell, saliva collection, taste, a self-administered\nvaginal swab for female respondents, \"Get Up and Go,\" distance vision, touch, oral mucosal transudate (Orasure\u00ae)\nhuman immunodeficiency virus test, and blood spots. This article discusses the development of NSHAP's instruments\nand implementation of the study design. Measures, such as response and cooperation rates, are also provided to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the design and implementation.\nKey Words: NSHAP--Survey--Aging--Health--Biomeasures.\nto determine the measurement domains necessary to ad-\ndress the specific aims of the project. Once measurement\ndomains were chosen, research staff conducted thorough\nreviews of relevant literature and contacted substantive ex-\nperts to determine if existing instruments could be used,\nhow much time the instrument took to administer, and va-\nlidity and reliability of the instrument. If no existing instru-\nment could be found, questions were developed specifically\nfor the project.\nA small pretest of the questionnaire and biomeasures\nprocedures was conducted from July to September 2004\nwith 53 respondents. Unfortunately, the results of the pre-\ntest indicated that the in-home administration was taking\nsignificantly longer time to complete than the planned 2 hr.\nThere were anecdotal reports of some interviews taking in\nexcess of 4 hr to complete. Consequently, the questionnaire\nwas subjected to a series of cuts, and the remaining ques-\ntionnaire domains were prioritized according to the specific\naims of the project. Any domain that was considered not\nessential to these aims was either cut completely or modu-\nlarized (details of this modularization are provided subse-\nquently). The questionnaire sections and domains for the\nin-home interview are shown in Table 2.\nAlthough most of the in-person questionnaire sections were\nadministered by the field interviewer, a small subset of ques-\ntions was determined to be sensitive enough to warrant self-\nadministration (fifth section in Table 2). These questions\nincluded the number of lifetime sexual partners (both male and\nfemale), lifetime use of prostitutes, frequency of masturbation,\nfrequency of urinary problems, and stool incontinence.\nDevelopment process for the biomeasures.--The integra-\ntion of biomeasures into the NSHAP study design enhanced\nthe study's scientific objectives in three major ways. First,\nbiomeasures permit estimation of the incidence and preva-\nlence among older adults of certain diseases (e.g., bacterial\nvaginosis [BV], human papilloma virus [HPV]). Second,\nthey permit the detection of undiagnosed or subclinical con-\nditions such as hypertension and diabetes that may have a\npotent effect on sexual function and/or overall well-being.\nThird, they provide objective measures of health status (e.g.,\nheight, weight, vision) for use in conjunction with self-\nreported measures.\nBiomeasure collection and shipping procedures were col-\nlaboratively developed over several years as part of a unique\ninterdisciplinary NSHAP biomeasure working group.

Primary considerations\nincluded (a) adaptability to in-home collection and ship-\nping, (b) adaptability to lay administration, (c) adaptability\nto the target population, (d) choosing portable, reliable,\nvalid, and economical equipment, and (e) evaluating the im-\npact of interviewer and respondent burden (for each mea-\nsure and the sum of all measures in the interview).\nThe range of biomeasures collected in NSHAP represents\na balance between the scientific value of the data, minimally\ninvasive techniques accepted by respondents, practical con-\nsiderations of implementation, and budget constraints. The\npretest provided invaluable data and experience that showed\nthat the collection of high-quality biomeasure data was pos-\nsible using nonmedically trained interviewers; but it also\nshowed that some of the protocols required streamlining or\nexclusion from the main data collection to improve admin-\nistration efficiency and reduce respondent burden. Weigh-\ning the main aims of the study with the target time of around\n2 hr spent in the home conducting the interview, the NS-\nHAP research team agreed that the assessments of hearing,\nlung function (peak flow), mobility (chair stand), glucose\ntest and toxicology (urine collection) should be dropped\nfrom Wave I administration.\nA total of 13 biomeasures were collected for the first\nwave of the study:\nWeight\n\u00b7\nWaist circumference\n\u00b7\nHeight\n\u00b7\nBlood pressure/pulse\n\u00b7\nSmell\n\u00b7\nSaliva collection (for cotinine, dehydroepiandrosterone\n\u00b7\n[DHEA], testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol)\nTaste\n\u00b7\nGet Up and Go test of mobility\n\u00b7\nDistance vision\n\u00b7\nTouch\n\u00b7\nOMT test for HIV (using Orasure\n\u00b7 \u00ae)\nBlood spots (for C-reactive protein [CRP], Epstein\u00ad\n\u00b7\nBarr virus [EBV], hemoglobin, and hemoglobin A1c)\nVaginal swab (self-administered) for female respon-\n\u00b7\ndents (for BV, yeast vaginitis, and HPV)\nModularization of the Questionnaire and Biomeasures\nAs discussed, the pretest had shown that although the col-\nlection of comprehensive questionnaire items and an exten-\nsive range of biomeasures was feasible, the respondent\nburden and potential financial costs of the fieldwork were\nconsidered unacceptable. To decrease respondent burden\nand minimize in-home interview time while maximizing\nthe analytic content of the interview, the NSHAP interview\nwas modularized. All respondents received a set of core\ninterview and biomeasure items. Five modules were devel-\noped: Two modules contained survey questions and three\nmodules included the collection of biomeasures. Respon-\ndents were randomly assigned to one of six paths containing\na set of these modules. Respondents assigned to paths where\nmodularized interview questions were not asked were in-\nstead given a mail-in self-administered questionnaire that\nincluded these items. Figure 1 depicts the content of each\nrandomly assigned path (note that this figure does not repre-\nsent the order in which the questions were asked).\nThe modularized questions were asked based on which\none of the six paths the interview had been randomly\nassigned. Modules A and B were questionnaire modules.\nModule A contained items on support from family and\nfriends, elder mistreatment, and nonsexual physical contact.\nModule B contained items on children and grandchildren,\nsexual interest, health care utilization, sexually transmitted\ninfections, and medical decision makers. If a respondent did\nnot receive Module A or B during the in-person interview,\nhe or she received these items in the self-administered,\npostinterview questionnaire. Modules C, D, and E were\nbiomeasure modules: Module C contained blood spot col-\nlection; Module D contained the Orasure\u00ae test (for HIV);\nand Module E contained the vision, touch assessments, and\nthe Get Up and Go test of mobility and balance. Question-\nnaire items on perceived taste, touch, and smell were asked\nof respondents in Module E during the in-person interview\nbut were omitted erroneously from the postinterview ques-\ntionnaire provided to others.\nQuestionnaire Administration and Management\nThe main portion of the in-home NSHAP interview was\nconducted in English or Spanish using a Computer-Assisted\nPersonal Interview (CAPI) questionnaire developed using\nSPSS' mrInterview (Version 2.2). The software accommo-\ndated the complexity of the questionnaire but remained user-\nfriendly. The CAPI program controlled which questionnaire\nand biomeasure modules were to be administered and which\nof the postinterview questionnaires was to be given to the\nrespondent, so that the whole interview appeared to the in-\nterviewer and the respondent as one continuous smooth pro-\ncess. As described earlier, there were several questions that\nwere considered particularly sensitive, so respondents were\noffered the choice of completing this series in one of two\nways: reading the question text on the laptop computer and\nentering responses directly into the CAPI program or read-\ning and answering the sensitive questions on a separate pa-\nper-and-pencil questionnaire. To further maintain privacy,\nthese paper questionnaires were immediately sealed by the\ninterviewer in a separate envelope and returned (still sealed)\nto NORC's production center for processing.\nTo decrease the occurrence of interviewer data entry errors,\nboth soft and hard range checks were programmed into the\nCAPI instrument. CAPI-programmed range checks alert the\ninterviewer that an unlikely (soft check) or impossible (hard\ncheck) response was entered. An impossible response, such\nas entering a weight that is higher than the scale's maximum\nmeasurable weight, cannot be entered into the CAPI, whereas\nan unlikely response can be entered into CAPI once the inter-\nviewer confirms it is correct. The interviewer instructions and\nthe data fields for collecting the in-home biomeasure re-\nsponses were also incorporated into the CAPI interview.\nData Collection\nProcedures were carefully designed for all aspects of the\nNSHAP data collection including the sample frame and se-\nlection, field staff preparations, informed consent, processes\nto conduct the in-home interviews including the collection\nof biomeasures, and the postinterview questionnaire. The\ncomplexity of the interview required comprehensive and ef-\nficient protocols for all data collection tasks.\nField interviewer recruitment.--Running parallel to the\nsample frame preparation and instrument development, the\nfield staff was planning for data collection. As is the case in\nmost field or telephone surveys, interviewers are often\nthe \"face\" of the project to respondents and are therefore\ncritical to its ultimate success. Consequently, NORC field\nFigure 1. Overview of random path assignment and content in each path. FI = field interviewer.\ninterviewers completed a rigorous recruitment process be-\nfore being staffed on NSHAP. Recruitment began several\nmonths prior to the start of data collection. All NORC field\ninterviewers were sent a letter explaining the details of NS-\nHAP in order to let them know when the project would be\nin the field. This letter helped to build enthusiasm for the\nproject as well as creating a list of interviewers who were\ninterested in working on NSHAP. Experienced interviewers\nwere staffed wherever possible and were evaluated on their\nprevious work and feedback from the field management\nstaff. Experienced interviewers also participated in a proj-\nect-based telephone interview. It was necessary to hire a\nhandful of new-to-NORC interviewers in areas where the\nsampled areas did not overlap with areas in which NORC\nhad existing field staff. New hires completed in-person\nmock interviews with field managers to evaluate their inter-\nviewing skills and proficiency with computers.\nAll interviewers were evaluated to ensure that they were\ncomfortable asking questions about the sensitive issues ad-\ndressed in the NSHAP interview. Because of the biomea-\nsures included in the NSHAP study, the recruitment process\nalso focused on the ability and willingness of interviewers\nto learn new skills. Potential interviewers were given fact\nsheets about the biomeasures that they would be collecting\nas well as information about storing and shipping biological\nsamples. In addition, they were also shown pictures of the\nbiomeasure collection techniques and when possible shown\nthe actual equipment used to collect the biomeasures. The\nNSHAP project team wanted to make sure that interviewers\nwere comfortable with all the tasks they would be asked to\ncomplete.\nNSHAP hired both male and female interviewers, al-\nthough the majority of the field interviewing staff were fe-\nmale. Due to some sensitive questionnaire items and\nbiomeasures (e.g., self-administered vaginal swabs), only\nfemale interviewers were allowed to interview female re-\nspondents. Field management staff selected the most capa-\nble interviewers in their areas to comprise a national field\ninterviewing staff.\nField interviewer training.--Interviewer training included\nthe completion of a home study packet, a four-day in-person\ntraining in Chicago, and booster trainings throughout data\ncollection. Over the summer of 2005, NORC conducted\nthree in-person trainings to prepare field interviewers to\nadminister the NSHAP questionnaire and biomeasures.\nHaving three training sessions allowed for smaller groups\nand more interaction between interviewers and the trainers\nin each of the training rooms. In total, 130 field interviewers\nand 12 field managers completed the NSHAP training.\nPrior to the in-person training, interviewers were required\nto complete a home study packet that included reviewing\nthe training manual, watching a video demonstrating\nbiomeasure collection, and answering questions about the\nproject. Interviewers then attended an in-person training\nthat consisted of two project training days, a self-study day,\nand a certification day. The two project trainings days were\ntaught through a series of brief lectures, hands-on practice\ndrills and mocks, and individual instruction.\nProject training focused on (a) field operations and ad-\nministering the questionnaire and (b) collecting the biomea-\nsures (Jaszczak, Lundeen, & Smith, 2009). Field operations\nand questionnaire administration training included several\nmock interviews to give the interviewers in-depth experi-\nence with the questionnaire. Interviewers also completed\nmodules addressing confidentiality, case management, gain-\ning cooperation, and refusal aversion. For biomeasure train-\ning, a standardized technique was used for each of the 13\nmeasures: The trainer first would explain the collection pro-\ncedure; the trainer would then demonstrate the collection\nprocedure with a \"respondent\"; and finally, the interviewer\nwould practice the collection procedure. The interviewer\npractice step was an essential aspect of the training, and it\nwas repeated at multiple times during the in-person training\nto enable the interviewer to become familiar and comfort-\nable with the collection procedures. Individual and small\ngroup feedback was integrated into this training process to\nensure correct collection techniques.\nDuring the self-study day, interviewers rotated through a\nseries of modules that provided individual instruction from\ntrainers on such topics as blood spot collection and the ship-\nping of biological samples. The final day of training re-\nquired interviewers to pass a certification interview. NSHAP\ninterviewers also had to complete at least one practice inter-\nview after returning home before entering the field. Addi-\ntionally, booster trainings were held by phone during data\ncollection to provide help with field efficiency and gaining\ncooperation for the biomeasures. Selected field interviewers\nparticipated in conference calls to address these issues.\nThe data collection began in a staggered format due to the\ntimings of the three training sessions. Once all three train-\ning sessions had been completed, the entire interviewing\nstaff was out in the field by mid-August 2005.\nGaining cooperation.--In an effort to show that the\nproject was a serious and scholarly undertaking, a conscious\ndecision was made to devote resources to developing a com-\nprehensive set of high-quality project materials that had a\nproject logo and a consistent layout and color scheme. All\nmaterials were tailored to meet the unique aspects of NS-\nHAP. A series of respondent materials were developed to\nintroduce the project to the respondent and aid the inter-\nviewers with gaining cooperation. Following standard prac-\ntice in field studies, an advance letter was sent to the\nrespondent's home before the interviewer made the first\ncontact. The NSHAP pretest protocol included a very de-\ntailed and informative advance letter. However, too much\ninformation seemed to overwhelm the respondents, making\nthem less likely to participate. So a brief letter with limited\ndetail to introduce NSHAP was developed that allowed the\ninterviewer to explain the project in detail and provide ad-\nditional materials at the door.\nAt the first contact, interviewers were provided with an\narray of tailored project materials to use as necessary to\naddress respondents' questions and concerns. Depending\non the respondent's questions or concerns, the interviewer\ncould provide any of the following materials: an NSHAP\nbrochure, examples of questions asked in NSHAP, a letter\nto community authorities, a dossier that contained letters\nof support and articles about the investigators' research,\na legitimacy handout, or the health information booklet\nthat showed the results they would receive from the\nbiomeasures.\nIf respondents were hesitant or initially refused, tailored\nadvance letters were mailed to them to address their con-\ncerns. NSHAP created letters to address concerns for those\nwho were too busy, not interested, did not like surveys, were\nworried about their privacy, did not like the government, did\nnot want to participate in the biomeasures, or their child/\nspouse did not want them to participate. The $100 incentive\nto participate in the study was also very beneficial in\ngaining the cooperation of many respondents; although in\nthe following, we discuss that the incentive was increased\nin the closing stages of the fieldwork to help boost the re-\nsponse rate. Interviewers also had great success in using\nsmall \"in-kind\" gifts such as small potted plants, a pumpkin\n(at Halloween), or gift cards.\nField managers worked very closely with the interview-\ners to help develop strategies for each individual case. The\nnumber and type of contact an interviewer made with a re-\nspondent varied greatly depending on the case. Interviewers\nand field management staff read through call notes from\nprevious attempts to determine the best time of day to con-\ntact the respondent, what concerns they had, and any other\nrelevant information that would help them make a connec-\ntion with the respondent. Sometimes it helped to send an-\nother interviewer who had more similarities (e.g., race or\nage) with the respondent. Having interviewers travel from\nother regions to attempt the interview also proved to be very\nsuccessful. Respondents were sometimes more willing to\nparticipate if the interviewer had a different accent or was\nunique in some way.\nRespondents had the right to refuse any of the biomea-\nsures at any time during the interview process. Conse-\nquently, gaining cooperation for each biomeasure was an\nimportant part of the interviewer's job. The interviewers\nused several gaining cooperation techniques to increase\nbiomeasure participation. Interviewers were thoroughly\ntrained to explain each biomeasure, address concerns, and\nobtain consent throughout the interview. In addition,\nbiomeasures were completed during the latter half of the\ninterview when most respondents were engaged in the inter-\nview, had already built a strong rapport with their field\ninterviewer, and recognized the importance of the data being\ncollected. In the final months of data collection, fieldwork\nlargely focused on refusal conversion. To increase the prob-\nability of converting these refusal cases and reach the goal of\ncompleting 3,000 interviews, the following steps were taken:\n(a) extend the end of the field period from December 2005\nto March 2006, (b) mail a refusal conversion packet, (c)\nform a refusal conversion team, (d) increase interviewer\ntraveling, and (e) increase the monetary incentive.\nIn December 2005, a refusal conversion packet was\nmailed to potential respondents who had not completed\nthe interview. Anecdotally, the biggest concern respon-\ndents were reporting was a need to verify the legitimacy of\nthe study. A one-page handout was developed addressing\nissues of legitimacy and sent via FedEx with a letter signed\nby the principal investigators and an NSHAP pen. It was\nhoped that respondents would be more likely to open the\nenvelope by sending it FedEx and with a small trinket that\nthey could feel through the packaging. At the same time, a\ngroup of talented NSHAP interviewers was also assem-\nbled to become part of a national refusal conversion team.\nTeam members would contact respondents by telephone\nand use their finely tuned gaining cooperation skills to at-\ntempt to schedule interviews for local field interviewers to\ncomplete.\nThe last refusal conversion effort was focused around in-\ncreasing the incentive amount offered to the respondent. To\nensure that the optimal incentive was offered that would fa-\ncilitate participation in NSHAP, a split-ballot incentive ex-\nperiment was conducted (Wargo, Jaszczak, Smith, &\nO'Muircheartaigh, 2007). A letter was sent via FedEx to a\nrandom sample of finalized refusal cases offering either a\n$200 or a $400 incentive. The letter also explained that the\nrespondents would not be contacted again; instead respon-\ndents were provided with a toll-free number to schedule an\ninterview. The $200 incentive resulted in an approximately\n2% conversion rate (i.e., approximately 2% of those offered\nincentive resulted in an approximately 9% conversion rate.\nBased on the results of the experiment, the $400 incentive\nwas offered to all remaining pending (i.e., in-scope but not\ninterviewed) cases. Ultimately, 221 respondents (7% of\nthose interviewed) received an increased incentive.\nResults Notification for the Biomeasures\nIn addition to the monetary incentive, it was hoped that\nthe in-home collection of the biomeasures and being pro-\nvided with the results would be viewed by the respondent as\nan added benefit to participating in the study. Respondents\nreceived results in two phases: (a) immediately following\nthe interview and (b) three weeks postinterview on a toll-\nfree, anonymous call-in system. The biomeasures that were\neither experimental or not clinically validated (e.g., coti-\nnine, DHEA, testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol from\nsaliva, and CRP, EBV, hemoglobin, and hemoglobin A1c\nfrom blood spots) were not reported to respondents.\nAt the end of the interview, interviewers provided re-\nspondents with their height; weight; waist circumference;\nblood pressure; pulse; and ratings for smell, taste, mobility,\nvision, and touch. To provide these results, the interviewer\nwas instructed to copy the results from the CAPI screen to a\nhealth information booklet that was left with the respon-\ndent. Interviewers were told not to comment on these results\nbecause they were not medically qualified to do so, but the\nbooklet did provide guidance on several measures, such as\nwhether their weight (using their body mass index) was be-\nlow, within, or above a healthy weight, and whether their\nblood pressure was normal, prehypertension, or high.\nThe interviewers also provided respondents with infor-\nmation on how to obtain results from the anonymous coun-\nseling service for biomeasures that required additional\nprocessing at a laboratory. Specifically, respondents were\ngiven an identification number to access their results. To en-\nsure anonymity and security, respondents were asked to cre-\nate a unique password and answer a verification question to\nbe used if they forgot their password. This call-in informa-\ntion was provided only to individuals who were eligible to\nreceive laboratory results. To remind respondents to call for\ntheir results, NORC sent respondents letters to inform them\nthat their results were ready.\nNSHAP contracted with the American Social Health As-\nsociation (ASHA) to provide anonymous counseling ser-\nvices.ASHA provided respondents with test results for HIV,\nBV, HPV, and yeast vaginitis; pretest and posttest result\ncounseling; materials; and referrals via a toll-free number.\nThe NSHAP call protocols used by ASHA counselors were\ncollaboratively created by ASHA and NSHAP researchers.\nThese protocols served as important tools and guidelines for\nhotline staff to use during NSHAP calls. To protect the con-\nfidentiality of the respondents, laboratory results were com-\nmunicated to ASHA using de-identified respondent\nidentification numbers. A reconciliation system was devel-\noped to ensure that respondents' identification numbers and\nlaboratory results were received and matched accurately.\nShipping of the Biomeasure Specimens\nBlood spots, OMT, vaginal swab, and saliva samples col-\nlected for NSHAP were analyzed by several outside labora-\ntories: Magee Women's Health Corporation, Northwestern\nUniversity's Department of Anthropology, Salimetrics, and\nthe University of Chicago's Institute of Mind and Biology.\nInterviewers were responsible for storing, packing, and\nshipping the samples to the respective laboratories. Each\ninterviewer was provided with detailed instructions on stor-\nage and shipping requirements, which existed both for the\ninterviewers' safety and to maintain the integrity of the\nsample. In particular, many samples had specific tempera-\nture requirements that had to be followed to ensure sample\nquality; for example, to limit bacterial growth, the saliva\nsamples needed to be frozen as soon as possible after the\ninterview and needed to be shipped on dry ice to avoid them\nthawing. All shipping protocols adhered to federal shipping\nguidelines for the proper packing of diagnostic samples.\nQuality Control of the Biomeasure Specimens\nCareful monitoring of the biomeasures was performed to\nensure the quality of the data collected. Specifically, the\nquality control measures included:\n\u00b7 Reconciliation. Throughout the data collection period,\nNORC performed weekly reconciliation tasks to com-\npare laboratory data with questionnaire data indicating\nwhether or not a sample was collected. Tracking was\nperformed with an interactive reconciliation system that\nallowed for the remote tracking of biological specimens\nfrom the point of in-home collection through the deliv-\nery in the final data set. Anomalies were investigated\nand resolved with the assistance of the field and labo-\nratory staff, field notes, laboratory sample requisition\nforms, and FedEx tracking numbers.\n\u00b7 Laboratory sample quality. The quality of the samples\ncollected and delivered to outside laboratories for anal-\nysis was monitored throughout the data collection pe-\nriod. NSHAP's laboratory subcontracting partners pro-\nvided ongoing feedback on the quality of the specimens\nreceived, including how they were collected, stored,\nand shipped, as well as if the results of the analyses\nfell within expected ranges. All four of the laboratories\nthat processed NSHAP specimens reported receiving\nhigh-quality samples that were similar in quality and\noutcomes to other studies.\nPostinterview Questionnaire\nAt the end of the in-person interview, respondents were\ngiven a paper-and-pencil postinterview questionnaire. Re-\nspondents were asked to complete this questionnaire and\nreturn it via U.S. mail in a provided postage-paid envelope.\nThe interviewers were instructed to not stay in the home\nwhile the respondents completed this portion of the inter-\nview. The self-administered questionnaires were designed\nwith simple instructions and few skip patterns and took ap-\nproximately 30 min or less to complete. To encourage\ncompletion, respondents were told that a portion of their\nincentive payment (25%) was for completing and returning\nthe postinterview questionnaire. However, the full incentive\nwas paid at the time of the in-person interview, with written\ndocumentation itemized to note this \"prepayment.\"\nAfter completing the in-person interview, most respon-\ndents were fully engaged in NSHAP and were willing to\ncomplete and mail in the postinterview questionnaire. Re-\nspondents who had not returned their questionnaire within\nthree weeks of the in-person interview received a telephone\ncall from a member of the NSHAP field staff. These calls\nserved multiple functions including (a) thanking respondents\nfor their participation in NSHAP, (b) inquiring if the postint-\nerview questionnaire had been returned, and (c) offering to\nsend a new version of the questionnaire if the original had\nbeen misplaced.\nThe postinterview questionnaires were mailed to NORC's\nproduction center where they were receipted and data cap-\ntured. The receipt control process was specifically designed\nto enable NORC staff to track the receipt of paper docu-\nments on a flow basis. Detailed specifications for computer-\nassisted data entry were developed to ensure proper range\nedits, skip patterns, and missing data flags, which all served\nto prevent errors and promote data integrity. Ten percent of\nthe cases were reentered for verification and quality control\npurposes.\nInstitutional Review Board Approval and Informed\nConsent Procedures\nGiven the age of the study population, the collection of\nbiomeasure data, and the sensitive or personal nature of\nsome elements of the questionnaire, it was critical that pro-\ntocols be developed to adequately protect the rights and\nwelfare of human subjects in the study.\nInstitutional review board approval.--Full approval was\ngranted for NSHAP from two institutional review boards\n(IRBs): the Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Re-\nview Board at the University of Chicago (the Federal Wide\nNational Institutes of Health Certificate of\nconfidentiality.--The NSHAP in-home interview included\nsensitive information about physical and mental health, his-\ntory of sexual and intimate partnerships, patient\u00adphysician\ncommunication regarding intimacy and sexuality, sexual\nfunction, behavior, desire, opportunity, and attitudes about\nsexuality. Additionally, disease status was verified during\nthe biomeasure collection. For these reasons, the research-\ners obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Na-\ntional Institute on Aging to further protect the privacy of the\nrespondents (National Institutes of Health, 2003). With this\ncertificate, researchers cannot be forced to disclose infor-\nmation that may identify respondents, even by a court sub-\npoena, in any federal; state; or local civil, criminal,\nadministrative, legislative, or other proceedings.\nUnique human subjects considerations.--The NSHAP\ninterview included components that made IRB approval dif-\nferent compared with most face-to-face interviews. Most\nnotably, the integration of biomeasures into the in-home in-\nterview presented the researchers with unique human sub-\njects considerations.\nBefore the NSHAP interview could be conducted, it was\nnecessary for the interviewer to obtain informed consent\nfrom the respondent. To reduce any real or perceived re-\nspondent burden as well as to make the information con-\ntained in the consent documents more salient to the different\nquestionnaire paths, the consent documentation process was\nstructured to reflect a continuous approach to informed con-\nsent. The specific steps in the consent documentation pro-\ncess were as follows:\nVerification to read consent. At the beginning of the\ninterview, respondents were asked whether they would like\nto read the Questionnaire and Physical Measures Consent\nForm or have the interviewer read the form to them. To en-\nsure that respondents did not receive information that did\nnot apply to them, separate male and female versions of the\nconsent form were used. The respondent was asked to sign\nthe consent form (a copy of the form was given to respon-\ndents for their records).\nBlood spot storage. During the results notification, re-\nspondents who had provided a blood spot were given this\nparticular form indicating whether they consented to the\nstorage of their blood spots and, if so, whether or not they\nwould like to be contacted before any potential future anal-\nysis is conducted. The decision to offer respondents a choice\nas to whether or not they would like to be notified before\nbeginning analysis on stored blood specimens was based\non our interpretation of the guidelines published by the\nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission's (1999) Research\nInvolving Human Biological Materials: Ethical Issues and\nPolicy Guidance, Vol. 1.\nCall-in information. The final step of consent documen-\ntation also occurred during results notification and applied\nto respondents who provided an OMT and/or vaginal swab\nsample during the interview. The purpose of the form was to\nprovide respondents with information about calling the toll-\nfree number to access their results. In addition, respondents\nwere asked to sign the form if they wanted to receive a re-\nsults reminder letter.\nThe process of verbal consent continued throughout the\ninterview, and the interviewer always confirmed willingness\nto participate in biomeasure collection prior to each assess-\nment. At any time, the respondent was able to seek and ob-\ntain additional information regarding the questions or\nmeasures or withdraw their consent.\nTo maintain respondent and data confidentiality after the\ninterview, the researchers instituted the use of an \"honest bro-\nker\" when dealing with the transmission of biological results.\nSpecifically, the honest broker was one individual and a small\nnumber of directly supervised, trained assistants within\nNORC who functioned to protect respondent confidentiality.\nThese specially designated individuals de-identified all data\nprior to transferring them to the investigator team.\nTo further protect respondent confidentiality, steps were\ntaken to maintain the anonymity of the results from biologi-\ncal assays. During the NSHAP interview, blood spots,\nsaliva, OMT, and vaginal swab samples collected from con-\nsenting respondents were labeled with unique identification\nnumbers. These numbers provided no individually identifi-\nable information to the laboratories. Samples were mailed\nby interviewers directly to the appropriate laboratories and\nlabeled only with the unique identification number. Once\nanalysis of a specimen was completed, laboratories sent re-\nsults with the unique identification number to NORC.\nAt the completion of the interview, NORC transmitted\nthe respondent's unique identification number, password,\nand verification question to the results notification service\n(ASHA). One laboratory sent HIV, HPV, yeast, and BV test\nresults with the unique identification number to the results\nservice. No personally identifying information was con-\ntained in any transmittals. These results were then available\nto the respondents on the anonymous call-in system two to\nthree weeks after the completion of the interview.\nResults\nThe Wave I data collection began on July 6, 2005, and was\nwere sampled for the study, of which 383 were classified af-\nter extensive field or central office enquiry as out of scope\n(i.e., they did not meet the eligibility requirements for the\nstudy). The two largest single categories for ineligibility were\ndeceased (which was 35% of all out-of-scope cases) and that\nthe sampled respondent was found to not be within the age\nrange for the study (15% of the out-of-scope cases). Of the\nweighted response rate of 75.5% (using the American Asso-\nciation of Public Opinion Research [AAPOR], 2006, RR2\ndefinition for calculating response rates). Field production\nwas strong at the start of data collection, and the refusal con-\nversion efforts implemented toward the end of data collec-\ntion provided the final increase needed to surpass the original\nresponse rate goal of 70%. Almost one quarter (24.0%\nweighted) of the eligible cases were ultimately classified as\nfinal refusals. Identifying the real reason for someone refus-\ning is sometimes difficult and often based on subjective as-\nsessments by field staff, but the reported reasons for NSHAP\nincluded that they were not interested in the study, or a gate-\nkeeper was blocking access on behalf of the respondent. The\nremainder of the eligible cases (0.5%) had no contact (i.e.,\nthe field staff were confident that the respondent still resided\nat the known address but were never able to talk with him/\nher), had moved and field staff were unable to interview him/\nher, or some other reason (e.g., the respondent's health was\ntoo poor to complete the interview).\nIn addition to monitoring NSHAP's overall response rate\nand focusing on refusal conversion, biomeasure coopera-\ntion rates were monitored continuously during the field\nperiod. As shown in Table 4, the cooperation rates (using\nof the 13 measures achieving cooperation rates in excess of\ningly, given the more invasive nature of the vaginal swab\nand the physical challenge for some women to perform the\ntest, the request for self-administered vaginal swabs had the\nlowest but still very respectable cooperation rate of 67.5%.\nThe other component of the data collection was the\npostinterview paper questionnaire that was left with the re-\nspondent to complete after the interviewer had completed\nthe in-home interview. Tracking the returns of these ques-\ntionnaires showed that 64% were being returned. To help\nboost the number of returned questionnaires, the field inter-\nviewers were instructed to prompt respondents by telephone.\nThe telephone prompting increased the return rate by 20 per-\ncentage points so that the final response rate for the postint-\nerview questionnaire was approximately 84%.\nTable 3.

A further challenge was a survey sample aged\n57\u00ad85 years that encompassed a wide spectrum of individu-\nals: those actively employed through to those who had been\nretired for many years, and healthy individuals through to\nthose in poor health. The combination of these and other\nfactors presented many operational and methodological\nchallenges. To help ensure successful data outcomes, sig-\nnificant attention was given to all study design elements in-\ncluding human subjects considerations, questionnaire\ndesign and programming, interviewer recruitment and train-\ning, and the development of all survey materials. The survey\nresponse rate, biomeasure cooperation rates, and the postint-\nerview questionnaire return rate appear to suggest that these\nefforts were successful.\nAdditionally, NSHAP presented unique field challenges.\nAlthough the project was challenging for field staff, it also\nproved to be a satisfying experience. In particular, the inclu-\nsion of the biomeasures added a new set of tasks that re-\nquired field staff to learn and master different skills.\nFeedback received from the interviewers immediately after\nthey completed training, from team calls throughout the\nfield period, and in debriefing sessions after the fieldwork\nended indicated that they enjoyed the project. Many of the\ninterviewers have requested that they would like to be\nstaffed on subsequent waves of the study.\nAdditional waves of the study (if funded) will be subject\nto the same careful review and implementation of methods\ndeveloped for Wave I. For example, as the sample ages, the\nresearchers will consider the impact of attrition between\nwaves and options for supplementing the Wave I cohort with\nnew sample. Similarly, as advances in technology make the\ncollection of once complicated biomeasures suddenly fea-\nsible for in-home collection, there will be a need to balance\ncomparability of measures and protocols across waves with\nthe implementation of newly available technology.\nNSHAP data and documentation are available to regis-\ntered users through the National Archive of Computerized\nData on Aging, within the Interuniversity Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research.
