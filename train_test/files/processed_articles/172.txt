    "abstract": "Abstract A dramatic rise in homicide in the latter half of the 1980s peaked during\nthe 1990s and then declined at an equally dramatic rate. Such trends in homicide rates\ncan be understood only by examining rates in specific age, sex, and racial groups. The\nincrease primarily involved young males, especially black males, occurred first in the\nbig cities, and was related to the sudden appearance of crack cocaine in the drug markets\nof the big cities around 1985. This development led to an increased need for and use of\nguns and was accompanied by a general diffusion of guns into the larger community.\nThe decline in homicide since the early 1990s has been caused by changes in the drug\nmarkets, police response to gun carrying by young males, especially those under 18\nyears old, the economic expansion, and efforts to decrease general access to guns, as\nwell as an increase in the prison population and a continued decline in homicide among\nthose over age 24. The lessons learned from the recent homicide trends and the factors\nassociated with them have important implications for public health and the criminal\njustice system.\n",

Injury research as a\ndiscipline is based on the public health model of surveillance: problem identifica-\ntion, understanding of risk and protective factors, development of interventions,\nand evaluation of their effectiveness. Injury research has traditionally relied on\nthe basic science of epidemiology to elucidate the etiology of injury and evaluate\nthe effectiveness of interventions. A 1985 report from the Institute of Medicine\npromoted the premier public health agency in the United States, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, as the lead agency for a national injury research\nand control agenda (19).\n?\nSoon after the publication of this report, the nation began to experience a dra-\nmatic rise in violent crime and its resultant injuries and deaths. Crime has tradition-\nally been considered the bailiwick of the criminal justice system, backed primarily\nby the research expertise of the disciplines of criminology and sociology. The\ncriminal justice system typically focused on the perpetrators of crime. However,\nthe sheer magnitude of the rise in violent injuries and deaths in the 1980s caused\nviolence to be viewed as a public health problem as well. Homicide became the\nthird leading cause of trauma death and the leading cause among 18- to 14-year-old\nAfrican-American males. It was projected that, without a change in the trends,\nfirearms would overtake motor vehicles as the leading cause of injury and death\nThe reasons for the rise in homicide in the latter half of the 1980s, peaking in\nthe early 1990s, and the subsequent equally dramatic decline span both criminol-\nogy and public health (10). In this review, we first describe trends in homicide\nvictimization and offenses over the last 20 years and then explore the reasons for\nthe increase in the late 1980s and the subsequent decrease in the 1990s. We limit\nour attention to homicide because more detailed and reliable data are available\nfor this offense than for other violent crimes and because, as a cause of death,\nhomicide is more in the purview of public health than crimes such as robbery.\nNonetheless, with few exceptions, the patterns we observe for homicide also char-\nacterize robbery and serious assault (11). We hope that the lessons learned from\nthis review will lead to an integration of public health and criminal justice in-\nterventions that further decreases violent injuries and death in the United States\nDespite many indications of a growing fear and concern over the possibility of\nvictimization, the trend in the U.S. homicide rate for the past 25 years has been\nthan double those that prevailed in the 1950s and early 1960s. The homicide rate\nbeen seen since the late 1960s. [Data are from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) (27).]\nAlthough these aggregate rates and their trends are certainly encouraging, it is\nimportant to disaggregate them to be able to identify how each population group\nhas been involved. In particular, we find that the trends are very different for\nyounger compared to older victims and offenders (victims and offenders are very\nsimilar in terms of age and other demographic features), and those differences have\nstimulated the search for influences on these different age groups. In pursuing\nthese issues, we first examine trends in victimization, followed by examination of\noffender patterns as reflected in arrests.\n?\nFigure 1 U.S. homicide victimization rates reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's\nVictimization Trends\nAge Factors Sharp age differences characterize the trends in homicide victim-\nization since 1980. All of the increase in U.S. homicide rates that began in the\nmid-1980s resulted from large upswings in the victimization rates of those <25\nyears old. The victimization trends for younger children <12 years old and for\nadults 25 years old have been flat or have shown modest declines for nearly\n20 years. We document these victimization trends with data from the FBI's Sup-\nplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Those reports, filed by individual police\ndepartments, provide considerable detail on individual homicide incidents. Each\nreport contains information on victim and (when known) offender characteristics\nand their relationship, the weapon involved, and the circumstances leading up to\nthe homicide. Unfortunately, only a single circumstance may be designated, and\nso trends in the ways police designate these single circumstances may limit the\nreliability of that aspect. (The number of incidents reported by an agency to the\nFBI's SHR is close but often not identical to those reported via the FBI's UCR.\nThe variations can result from differences in reporting procedures when different\nsegments of the police department handle the two reporting tasks.)\n?\nFigure 2 U.S. homicide victimization rates for five age groups, from the Federal Bureau of\nboxes), between ages 18 and 24 (closed boxes), between ages 25 and 49 (+'s), and\nat or above age 50 (x's) (changes for more recent years continue the trends shown\nin the figure). The SHR data are from Snyder & Finnegan (54). The population\ndata are from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (12). After decreasing somewhat\nduring the first half of the 1980s, the victimization rates for juveniles ages 12\u00ad17\nand young adults ages 18\u00ad24 began a steep increase, which lasted until the early\n1990s. The juvenile rate roughly doubled, and the rate for young adults increased\nby two-thirds over that period. By 1993, the homicide rate for young adults was\n2.5-fold that for the population as a whole (cf. Figures 1 and 2). Since the early\n1990s, the victimization rates for both juveniles and young adults have declined,\nalthough not to the levels of the early 1980s (29). Meanwhile, we observe no\ncomparable rise in the rates for children under 12 and adults over 25 (Figure 2).\nWhatever factors are responsible for the increase in the nation's homicide rate\nin the late 1980s, then, clearly had a disproportionate influence on teenagers and\nyoung adults. Older adults and children <12 were either shielded from those\ninfluences, or other factors were operating in those groups that diminished their\nrisk. A similar story can be told about racial differences in homicide victimization\nrates and trends.\nRacial Factors African Americans are exposed to a risk of homicide many times\n?\nFigure 3 U.S. homicide victimization rates by race from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's\nSupplementary Homicide Reports, 1980\u00ad1995. Note that the white rate (open boxes) has been\nmultiplied by 6 for comparison with the black rate ( filled boxes).\nvictimization also show some notable differences by race. Figure 3 presents the\nPeople of other races have been excluded from this comparison. The SHR recorded\n21,597 victims). Hispanics are not separately identified in this analysis and may\nbe of any race. To analyze trends, the large difference in homicide rates between\nwhites and African Americans was made more comparable in the graph by first\nmultiplying the white rate by six.\nAlthough we observe a rough correspondence between the race-specific trends,\nwith homicide rates for both blacks and whites declining during the first half of the\n1980s and rising to a peak in the early 1990s, the rise for blacks began earlier and\nwas considerably sharper than that for whites, as shown in Figure 3. The black rate\nin 1991. The rate for whites did not begin to rise until 1989 and increased only\nwas observed in the 1990s was correspondingly sharper for African Americans. It\nappears that the factors responsible for the trends in homicide victimization rates in\nrecent decades have exerted a stronger influence on African Americans than whites.\nGender Factors Without displaying the trends, we observe that sex differences\nin the aggregate rates of homicide victimization have not changed appreciably\n?\nsince 1980. With some year-to-year fluctuation, women have composed about\none-quarter of all homicide victims over the last 2 decades in the United States.\nHowever, an important interaction between the age, race, and sex of victims char-\nacterized the period of increased homicide rates during the late 1980s and early\n1990s; the increased levels of risk were concentrated disproportionately among\nyoung black men (28, 29) and were strongly associated with firearms.\nWeapons Factors The role of weapons must figure centrally in any credible\nexplanation of U.S. homicide trends over the past 2 decades. All of the increase\nin the aggregate rate of victimization occurred in the category of homicides by\nfirearms. The number of persons killed with other weapons or no weapons has\nactually dropped somewhat since 1980. The number of whites killed with firearms\nThe number of African-American firearm homicide victims, meanwhile, nearly\nAlthough these common increases do not reveal the precise role of guns in\nthe so-called homicide epidemic of the late 1980s, they do suggest that factors\naffecting access to and carrying of guns very likely contributed to the increase\nin risk. We explore these factors in some detail in the following discussion of\noffending patterns.\nFigure 4 Trends in weapons [firearms (closed boxes) and weapons other than firearms (open\nboxes)] involved in homicides of white victims. (Source: Supplementary Homicide Reports data.)\n?\nFigure 5 Trends in weapons [firearms (closed boxes) and weapons other than firearms (open\nboxes)] involved in the homicides of black victims. (Source: Supplementary Homicide Reports\ndata.)\nRelationship Factors A final component of homicide with important implica-\ntions for our assessment of the factors responsible for recent trends in risk is the\nrelationship between the victim and suspected offender. Because the SHR data\ndo not contain information about the legal disposition of homicide cases, the \"of-\nfenders\" in the cases are technically \"suspects.\" The same is true of the arrest data\nused to examine offending patterns below. The great majority of persons arrested\nfor murder are eventually convicted in court (13).\nFigure 6 displays the percentages of victims killed by family members, other\ntrend for incidents in which the relationship between the victim and offender was\nunknown. The percentage of people killed by family members decreased steadily\nmid-1990s. Most of this decrease is attributable to a sizeable decline in \"intimate-\npartner\" homicides involving spouses and ex-spouses. (We explore this trend in\nmore detail in the following discussion of offending patterns.) Between 35% and\n40% of homicide victims are killed by nonfamily acquaintances, and another 15%\nare killed by strangers.\nIn the remaining incidents, the victim's relationship to the offender is \"un-\nknown.\" The fraction of such incidents increased from about one-quarter of all\n?\nFigure 6 Trends in the percent distribution of homicide victim-offender relationships.

The FBI lent official\ncredence to such concerns by announcing in its 1993 UCR: \"Every American now\nhas a realistic chance of murder victimization in view of the random nature the\nThe FBI's striking characterization of the upturn in homicides in which the\nrelationship between the victim and offender is \"unknown\" implies that they are\nstrangersandnotsimplyunknowntothepolice. Althoughitisdifficulttodetermine\nprecisely whether the fraction of homicides involving victims and offenders who\nare strangers has risen over the past 20 years, two facts are reasonably certain. First,\nthe SHR under counts homicides by strangers, which probably account for nearly\na quarter of all homicides rather than the 15% recorded in the SHR during the\n1980s (58). Second, it is incorrect to assume that all of the incidents in which the\nrelationship between the victim and offender is unknown involve strangers. Many\nof them very likely are acquaintance cases, such as drug-related killings, in which\nthe police are unable to secure cooperation from witnesses to make an arrest (47).\nCertainly, from what we have observed about the nature of criminal homicide in\nthe United States, a statement that suggests a uniform risk of victimization across\nsex, race, and age groups seems far-fetched at the very least.\n?\nOffender Trends\nOne of the striking features of the rise in homicide victimization between 1985 and\nthe early 1990s was the bifurcation in trends by age, with a sharp rise for teenagers\nand young adults at the same time that there was a decline for those aged 25 and\nabove. We observe the same difference in the age-specific trends for homicide\noffenses. We examine offender patterns by examining arrest rates based on arrest\ndata from the FBI's annual UCRs (27).\nFigure 7a presents the age-specific arrest rate (the ratio of arrests of any age\nto the base population of that age, known as the \"age-crime curve\") for murder in\n1985, which was the last year of a 15-year period of very stable age-specific rates,\nand in 1993, which was the peak year of juvenile age-specific rates. The pattern in\n1985 was fairly typical, with a rather flat peak for offenders between the ages of 18\nand 24 and steadily lower rates for offenders under age 18 and over age 24. Figure\n7a illustrates that there was a dramatic change by 1993, with a very sharp increase\nat the younger ages and a very sharp peak at age 18. We also note that the rates\nfor those over 30 had indeed declined. Figure 7b depicts the same 1993 age-crime\ncurve along with its counterpart for 1997. Here we see that the rates for all ages\nIt is instructive to look at the trends for individual ages. Figure 8a depicts the\ntrend for the traditional peak homicide arrest rate, ages 18 through 24. Those rates\nThe rate for the 18 year olds more than doubled by 1991 (for an annual growth\nand then continued down for the next 3 years. The pattern is similar for the other\nages depicted in Figure 8a, although the steepness of the rise in the late 1980s\ndecreases with increasing age, and the decline after 1993 is correspondingly less\nfor the older ages.\nFor offenders 18 and under, depicted in Figure 8b, the pattern is very similar to\nIn all of the under-18 groups, the rate more than doubled by 1993.

In contrast, for ages 30 and above, the 1993 rates were\ngreatest decline occurred in the teenage years. It is clear that the teenage rates are\nconsiderable room for improvement to get back down to the 1985 rates.\nAlso, we note the continuing decline in the homicide rates for older ages. By\nthe rates among older groups had declined by 40%.\nThese figures underscore the central importance of examining the factors asso-\nciated with the different age groups to explain the trends in the aggregate homicide\nbecause the rates for people <25 years old were increasing faster than the rates for\nple were generally flat (as reflected in the pattern for 18 year olds in Figure 8a),\nand so the decline by those in the older age groups dominated the aggregate,\nleading to the downturn that began in 1992. Because the rates for both young\nand old age groups were decreasing after 1993, the aggregate rate continued to\nfall.\n?\nIn summary, all of the increase in the aggregate level of homicide in the United\nStates during the growth period of the late 1980s and early 1990s can be traced to\ntrends in the younger age groups <25 years, because homicide rates for those 25\nyears old did not increase. However, the aggregate decrease since 1993 is a product\nof both the recent sharp drop in offending among young people and the continuing\ndecline in offending among older persons. Even though they commit homicides\nat much lower rates, the contribution of people 25 years old to the recent decline\nin the aggregate homicide rate may be appreciable, given their large numbers.\nAn important contributor to the long-term drop in adult homicide is the dec-\nline in homicides involving spouses, ex-spouses, and other intimate partners. There\nare notable sex and race differences in that decline. The rate at which husbands are\nkilled by their wives has decreased more sharply than the rate at which wives are\nkilled by their husbands (24, 33), and the decrease in rates for blacks has been\ngreater than that for whites.\nFigure 10 displays the sex- and race-specific trends in intimate-partner homicide\nscaled up by a factor of 10 to align them with the black rates. Even though the\nrates for all of the age groups have fallen over the past 20 years, the reduction in\nFigure 10 Trends in the rate of intimate-partner homicide victimization by race and gender,\n1976\u00ad1996.

By contrast, the rate for white females exhibited a more modest de-\nand white males are 63% and 60%, respectively). By any reckoning, these adult\nmortality trends, especially for black males, must be seen as good news, but the\nsocial changes responsible for them remain poorly understood. We offer some\nspeculation below about these changes in our discussion of the factors associated\nwith the rise and fall in U.S. homicide rates.\nChanging Demographic Composition\nMuch of the speculation about the recent decline in homicide rates attributes the\ndecline to changing demographics. For example, writing in the New York Times,\nDavid Kocieniewski (41) states that \". . . some (unnamed) criminologists attribute\nthe decline to demographic factors like a smaller number of teenagers.\" In an\narticle on the \"mystery\" of the drop in crime, David Anderson (4) notes that some\n(also unnamed) analysts explain the drop as resulting from \"random demographic\nchanges\" (p. 49). This opinion may be a holdover from the realization that much of\nthe decline that began in 1980 was attributable to a demographic shift, as the baby\nboom generation matured out of the high-crime ages. But those same demographic\neffects are no longer at work in the early 1990s, because demographic effects do\nnot always have to work in the same direction.\nThe decline after 1980 was significantly affected by the shrinking size of the\ncohorts in the high-crime ages, but the United States in the 1990s is in a period of\ngrowing cohort sizes in the late-teens and early-20s age groups. Figure 11 depicts\nthe age distribution of the U.S. population in 1999. It is evident that the smallest\nlarger than its predecessor until the peak at about age 7. Thus, if teenager-specific\ncrime rates were to remain constant, then the aggregate crime rate would increase\nas a result of the larger cohort sizes. This possibility spurred the warnings of a\ndemographic \"crime bomb\" set to go off during the 1990s (23).\nYet, itisimportanttorecognizethattheseagecompositionchangesarerelatively\nsmall, with cohort sizes growing at 1%/year. In the face of much larger swings\nin demographic composition is a minor effect.\nIt is possible, finally, that changes in relative cohort size could alter the age-\nspecific rates through mechanisms described by Easterlin (25) and Smith (53).\nHowever, the evidence suggests that, if changes in the relative size of age cohorts\n?\nFigure 11 Age composition of the U.S. population in 1999 in number of persons of each age.\n(Source: Census population data smoothed by 3-point smoothing.)\ninfluence homicide rates, the cohort effects are minor compared with age and\nThe Changing Role of Handguns, Especially Among Juveniles\nand Young Adults <25\nThere is widespread recognition of the changing role of weaponry in young peo-\nple's hands (34). Over the last decade the weapons involved in settling juveniles'\ndisputes have changed dramatically from fists or knives to handguns, with their\nmuch greater lethality. That growth in lethal weaponry is reflected in the changes\nin the weapons involved in homicides in different race and age groups. Blumstein\n& Cork (9) examined those changes in mortality statistics and found a striking\ndivergence in the trends for gun and nongun homicides, with some significant\ndifferences based on age and race.\nAs seen in Figures 4 and 5, African-American homicide victimization rates\nwith guns declined to a trough in 1984, followed by a rather sharp increase into\nthe early 1990s. The rate of increase is largest for the youngest age group. The\nsituation for whites is very similar (9), except that the trough occurred somewhat\n?\nlater (about 1988); the growth rate after the trough was strongest in the youngest\ngroup, with no growth in ages >25. In stark contrast, there were no comparable\nturning points in the nongun homicide victimization rates, which have been flat or\nThe pattern in gun suicide rates was very similar to that for homicide rates for\nAfrican Americans--a decline through the early 1980s and an increase that varied\ninversely with age after a turning point in about 1985. There was no such consistent\npattern for whites. Again, there was no meaningful change in nongun suicides over\nthis period. The consistency between the suicide and homicide patterns, at least\nfor young African Americans who normally have a lower suicide rate than do\nwhites, certainly suggests an important role of the increased availability of guns.\nThe availability of guns after 1985 converted attempts that might not have been\nfatal into fatalities.\nWe can examine similar issues regarding the weaponry used by offenders in\nhomicides, with data from the SHR (54). Figures 12a, b, and c illustrate the trends\nin weaponry used in homicides by offenders in three age categories: older adults,\nand adolescents, 17 and under (Figure 12c). The weapons are classified into three\nFigure 12 (a) Trend in types of weapons used by adults (ages 25\u00ad45) in homicides. (b) Trends\nin types of weapons used by youths (ages 18\u00ad24) in homicides. (c) Trends in types of weapons\nused by children and adolescents (under 18) in homicides. (Source: Supplementary Homicide\nReports data.)\n?\nFigure 12 (Continued)\n?\ngroups: handguns, other guns, and nonguns (which includes no weapon). We can\nof handguns by older adults. The situation for young adults and for children and\nadolscents is quite different, however. For both of these groups, there was no clear\ntrend until 1986, and then a significant growth in handgun use began. With 1985 as\nthe base year, handgun homicide among young adults increased >100% by 1994,\nand use of handguns by those <18 years old increased >300%. In both of these\ngroups, there is a leveling out from 1993 to 1994, and then we see a sharp decline\nin 1995 in these groups as well as in older adults. There should be similarly sharp\nshown in Figure 9a. Even the use of handguns in homicides by older adults shows\nIn all of these figures, no appreciable increase has occurred in either the long-\ngun or the nongun categories. There has been some decline in the nongun category\ncompared with the >100% growth in their use of handguns. Thus, we observe\nthat the growth in homicides by juveniles and young adults, which accounted for\nall of the growth in homicides in the post-1985 period, was driven totally by the\ngrowth in homicides committed with handguns. Clearly, the sharply increasing\npresence of handguns in young-adult and juvenile homicides must be considered\nof fundamental importance in any explanation of the homicide increase of the late\nWe also observe some important racial differences in the growth of handgun\nhomicides, with the dominant growth being among African-American juveniles\nand young adults, both as offenders and as victims. Figure 13 presents the number\nof homicides committed by blacks, ages 18\u00ad24, by type of weapon involved. Here\nwe see an even sharper growth in handgun use than for young adults generally\n(Figure 12b); the number of handgun homicides by young black adults more than\ngrowth in the role of the other weapon types.\nAlthough some growth also occurred in handgun homicides by white young\nadults 18\u00ad24 years old, that growth was far less than among black youths. The\ndifference is depicted in Figure 14, which compares the two racial groups. This\nfigure focuses on all cities of >100,000 population. Here we see the strong growth\nin handgun prevalence for black young adults 18\u00ad24 years old, from a low in 1984\nto a tripling by 1993. The rise for whites does not start until 1989, but does display\nblack young adults than white young adults. These patterns parallel closely those\nobserved for the victimization trends observed earlier.\nHow Did the Young People Get the Guns:\nLinks to Illicit-Drug Markets\nIt is widely recognized that an important feature of the late 1980s was that drugs,\nand especially crack cocaine, became an important part of life in many American\n?\nFigure 13 Trends in types of weapons used by black youths (ages 18\u00ad24) in homicides. (Source:\nSupplementary Homicide Reports data.)\ninner cities. This trend is reflected in the drug arrest rates displayed in Figure 15a\n(for adults aged 18 and older) and Figure 15b for juveniles (under 18). For non-\nwhite adults, there was a rise that began in the early 1980s and accelerated after\n1985. For juveniles of both racial groups, there was a clear upward trend from a\nnegligible level of arrests in 1965 to a peak in 1974, representing predominantly\narrests for marijuana. The peak in 1974 was very likely a result of widespread\ndecriminalization of marijuana, which led to a decline in drug arrests for both\nwhites and nonwhites. For whites, that decline continued until the early 1990s,\nwhen there was a new rise in marijuana use and arrests. For nonwhite juveniles,\nthe decline was somewhat slower, leveling off in the early 1980s (while the non-\nwhite adult rate increased) and then increasing very sharply, more than doubling\nWe have thus identified three major changes that have occurred in the short\nthan doubled, whereas there was a decline in homicide rates for adults 30\n(Figure 9); (b) the number of homicides with guns committed by juveniles more\nthan quadrupled, whereas there was no change in nongun homicides (Figure 12c);\nand (c) the arrest rate of nonwhite juveniles on drug charges more than dou-\nbled, whereas there has been no growth in the drug arrest rate for white juveniles\n?\nFigure 14 Trend in number of handgun homicides in cities with populations over 100,000,\nby race of offenders ages 18\u00ad24 (black and combined white and Hispanic). (Source: Sup-\nplementary Homicide Reports data.)\nThe important feature of these rapid changes is that they occurred after a prior\n15-year period of relative stability, and so we need some explanation of what\nchanges brought about those sharp transitions from a stable pre-1985 period to a\nOne possible explanation (6) for this array of changes derives from examining\nthe changes in the illegal-drug markets associated with the introduction of crack\ncocaine. That introduction occurred at different times in different parts of the\ncountry, but the leading edge occurred in about 1985, at least in larger cities like\nNew York and Los Angeles. An important feature of crack is its low price, and\nthat brought into the cocaine market many low-income people who could only buy\nit one \"hit\" at a time. The number of transactions in those markets significantly\nincreased, owing both to the numbers of new buyers brought in and the number of\ntransactions each buyer engaged in per week.1\n1Contrast this with the more typical middle-class consumers of powder cocaine. Those\nbuyers had an interest in minimizing the number of illegal transactions they engaged in, and\nthey had the assets to buy a reasonable supply in any transaction and the storage space in\nwhich they could keep their drugs safely. (We thank Jonathan Caulkins for calling attention\nto this feature of the emerging crack markets.)\n?\nFigure 15 Trends in arrest rates for drug offenses. (a) Trend in arrest rate of adults (ages 18\nand above) for drug offenses by race. (b) Trend in arrest rate of juveniles (under age 18) for drug\noffenses by race. (Sources: Uniform Crime Report and census population data.)\n?\nTo accommodate that increased demand, the drug dealers had to recruit a large\nnumbers of new sellers. Juveniles were the natural source of supply for that labor\nmarket. They were probably willing to work more cheaply than adults, partly\nbecause they are less vulnerable to the punishments imposed by the adult criminal\njustice system. But also they tend to be daring and willing to take risks that more\nmature adults would eschew. The economic plight of young urban black juveniles\nat the time, many of whom saw no other comparably satisfactory route to economic\nsuccess or even sustenance, made them particularly amenable to the lure of the\ndrug markets.\nThese juveniles, like many other participants in the illicit-drug industry, are\nlikely to carry guns for self-protection, largely because that industry uses guns\nas an important instrument for dispute resolution. Also, the participants in the\nindustry are likely to be carrying a considerable amount of valuable product--\ndrugs or money derived from selling drugs--and are not likely to be able to call\non the police if someone tries to rob them. Thus, they are forced to provide their\nown defense, and a gun is a natural instrument for use in that function (38).\nBecause the drug markets are pervasive in many inner-city neighborhoods and\nthe young people recruited into them are fairly tightly networked with other young\npeople in their neighborhoods, it has become easy for the guns to be \"diffused\" to\nother teenagers who go to the same school or who walk the same streets. These\nother young people are also likely to arm themselves, primarily for their own pro-\ntection, but also because possession of a weapon may become a part of status seek-\ning in the community. This initiates an escalating process: as more guns appear\nin the community, the incentive for any single individual to be armed increases.\nThen, given this availability of guns, the recklessness and bravado that are\noften characteristic of teenagers, as well as their lower levels of skill in settling\ndisputes other than by physical force, many fights that would otherwise have\nresulted in nothing more than a bloody nose turn into shootings.2 This can be\nexacerbated by the problems of socialization associated with high levels of poverty,\nhighratesofsingle-parenthouseholds, educationalfailures, andawidespreadsense\nof economic hopelessness. But those factors have been changing gradually over\nthe years, and so they cannot readily provide the explanation for the very sharp\nchanges that began to take place in the mid-1980s.\nBy the time people mature beyond their early 20s, it appears that they do\ndevelop some prudence, are more cautious even if they are armed, and display\ngreater restraint in the use of guns. (That inference seems reasonable, given\nevidence of the decline in homicide rates among people in their mid-20s and\n2Tarr has called our attention to a passage in Jane Addams' The Spirit of Youth and City\nStreets (1), in which some 13-year-old boys were taunting each other, and one of them went\ninto the house to get a gun and shot the taunter through the head and killed him. Addams\nnotes that \"This tale could be duplicated almost every morning; what might be merely a\nboyish scrap is turned into a tragedy because some boy has a revolver.\" The original edition\n?\nbeyond.) Also, because adults in their mid-20s are not as tightly networked as\nyounger people, the gun diffusion process is likely to be much slower and less\nwidespread. Alternatively, we might be witnessing a cohort effect, and the 18 year\nolds involved in the higher homicide rates may possibly continue their recklessness\nas they mature. That issue still needs to be watched and explored.\nThe validity of these hypothesized processes can be tested with city-level data\non drugs, guns, and homicides. Such an analysis would take advantage of the\nfact that drug markets flourished at different times in different cities, for example,\nreportedly earlier in New York and Los Angeles but later in Washington and\nPittsburgh. Thus, the sharp change that took place in the national statistics in\nabout 1985 should have been displayed in the city-level data shortly after the crack\nmarkets began functioning in these cities, with the change occurring earlier in\nsome cities than in others. But if the above hypothesized process is correct, that\nwould suggest a relationship between the rise in drug arrests and youth homicides\nin the same city, with the rise in homicides presumably coming after a rise in drug\narrests.\nCork (22) has used a diffusion model to examine city-level patterns in arrests\nof juveniles for drug offenses and for homicide. He finds that the crack arrests\nrose sharply beginning in about 1984 in cities in the Northeast and the West and in\nabout 1987 in the center of the country. He also finds a similar geographic pattern\nin the rapid rise in juvenile homicide arrests, but with a median lag of 2 years\nafter the rise in crack arrests. These observations are consistent with the diffusion\nhypothesis.\nThere is some further evidence that supports the hypothesis of the diffusion\nof guns from drug markets throughout the larger community of juveniles. Figures\n16a and 16b present the arrest rates for murder among adults and juveniles by race.\nWe see from Figure 16a that, since 1980, both white and nonwhite adults have\nfollowed the same negative trend, even though there has been a large difference in\ntheir involvement in drug markets (see Figures 15a and b). In contrast, the arrest\nrates for juveniles--whites and nonwhites--have grown markedly since 1985,\nwhen the drug arrest rate for nonwhites began to climb. The murder arrest rate\n1992. The rate for whites also increased markedly, but by a lesser amount--80%,\nrate began in 1985, whereas the first rise in the white juvenile rate did not occur\nuntil 1988, a 3-year lag that is consistent with the diffusion hypothesis that the\nmajor arrival of handguns began in the African-American community and then\ntook 3 years to diffuse to the white community. The fact that there seems to have\nbeen no significant involvement of white juveniles in the drug markets during\nthis time (Figure 15b) has not insulated them from the growth in involvement in\nhomicide, and one possibility for that growth is through the hypothesized gun\ndiffusion process.\nThis hypothesis of the diffusion of guns into the community is the contagion\nmodel, familiar to most workers in public health. As applied to firearms, the\n?\nFigure 16 Trends in arrest rates for homicide. (a) Trend in arrest rate of adults (ages 18 and\nabove) for homicide by race. (b) Trend in arrest rate of juveniles (under age 18) for homicide by\nrace. (Sources: Uniform Crime Report and census population data.)\n?\npresence of an armed group in the population increases the likelihood that others\nwill become armed to protect themselves (43). Surveys among teens lend some\ncredence to the contagion model. Many inner-city teenagers and young adults in\nthe late 1980s had guns or had easy access to guns. For example, 25% of junior\nhigh school males in Washington, DC, reported carrying a gun (57). The 1993\nYouth Risk Behavior Survey found that 14% of males in grades 9\u00ad12 reported\ncarrying a gun in the previous 30 days (18). In Seattle, 40% of male 11th graders\nhad easy access to a gun, and 11% owned guns (16). A survey in four inner-city\nareas with high rates of gun violence found that 86% of incarcerated youths and\n37% of male high school students owned guns (51).\nMost adolescents feel less safe as their classmates acquire guns (35). Likewise,\nliving in a community with frequent shootings increases the likelihood of youths\ncarrying guns. Among those who have carried a gun in the past, 34% are more\nlikely to bring a gun to school if others do (35). Sheley & Wright (51) report that\ntwo-thirds of the inner-city high school students they surveyed who carried guns\ncited self-protection as the main reason for gun ownership.\nThe largest cities contribute disproportionately to patterns of serious violence for\nthe nation as a whole. The prominent role of the large cities is clearly evident in the\ntrends in homicide. Based on UCR data for 1991, for example, the United States\nof the total). Because New York City's homicide rate has declined faster than the\nnational rate, its percentage contribution to the total has dropped to <5%.\nAlthough no other city has as large an effect as New York, the importance\nof the large cities is reflected in the relative contribution they make to the total\nhomicide picture. In 1996, ten cities (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit,\nPhiladelphia, Washington, New Orleans, Baltimore, Houston, and Dallas, in de-\ncreasing order of numbers of homicides) accounted for fully one-quarter of all of\nthe nation's homicides. In contrast, in 1991, when New York alone accounted for\n9% of all U.S. homicides, only seven cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago,\nDetroit, Houston, Dallas, and Washington) were needed to account for a quarter\nNew York City has been a major contributor to the national decline since the\nhomicides), New York City's drop of 384 accounted for 22% of the total decrease.\nNew York City's contribution to the drop since 1995 has been closer to 10%, still\nvery large, but smaller than in the earlier years, in part because the smaller cities\nare beginning to catch up. It is thus clear that what goes on in New York City or the\nlargest cities more generally can have a very powerful effect on national statistics.\n?\nExamination of the trends over time offers a compelling picture of the saliency\nof the large cities, both in the rise of homicide in the 1980s and the decline during\nhomicides with handguns) use SHR data to estimate the number of homicides in\neach of four groups of cities by population (those of 1 million and those in the\nThe numbers of homicides associated with each of the city-sized groups other\nthan the largest are roughly the same in each year (partly because, as the popu-\nlation size approximately halves between groups, the number of cities approxi-\nmately doubles, thereby keeping the number of homicides roughly stable); there-\nfore, we can contrast the larger and smaller cities. There were six cities in the\nmillion-plus group: New York, Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Diego,\nand Dallas (some cities, including Chicago and Houston, were not included here\nbecause their reporting to the SHR was sporadic, and we did not want to at-\ntribute these fluctuations in reporting to changes in the homicide patterns being\nobserved).\nFigure 17a shows the limited variation associated with the nonhandgun homi-\ncides. There was very little change in the smaller cities and a rather gradual decline\nthe handgun homicides. Figure 17b shows that the large cities had major growth\ndeclining 37% to the low in 1995, with indications that that decline will continue,\nat least for some years.\nWe note that the smaller cities also had a distinct upturn in handgun homicides,\nbut not until 1988, 2 years later than in the large cities. That upturn was even larger\nin percentage terms, collectively increasing 116% from the trough in 1987 to the\npeak in 1993. The more recent downturn also began later than in the large cities,\nThe differences in the timing of the increase in handgun homicides for the large\nand smaller cities could be associated with crack markets. Crack markets generally\nemerged first in the largest cities and may have diffused to smaller cities at a later\ntime, which could possibly account for these lag effects.\nIt is also true that the peak occurred later in smaller cities. Although peak\nhomicide rates were reached in 1991 in the largest cities, the lags before peak rates\nin smaller cities were progressively larger as the city sizes decreased. We also note\nthat the decline in the largest cities was quite sharp after the flat 1991\u00ad1993 peak.\nIn the smaller cities, however, a comparable sharp decline was not yet observed.\nIndeed, recent news reports chronicle the escalating homicide rates in some mid-\nsized cities and speculate that these increases could be associated with the later\nemergence of crack markets and associated drug-related violence (39).\nTo the extent that both the increase and downturn in handgun homicides in the\nlargest cities were associated with corresponding changes in crack markets, we\n?\nFigure 17 Trends in weapons used for homicides in cities with populations >100,000. (a) Trend\nin homicides with weapons other than handguns. (b) Trend in homicide with handguns. (Source:\nSupplementary Homicide Reports data.)\n?\nwould anticipate that homicide rates in the smaller cities should be reaching a peak\nand in some instances beginning to decline. The timing of these changes should\ncorrespond to city size; the declines should begin first in larger cities and later in\nsmaller cities. SHR data beyond 1995 will be needed to confirm these speculations\nabout the role of drug markets in the increase and the decline of U.S. homicide rates\nand in the differences in timing of these changes observed across cities of different\nsizes. However, the observed patterns are highly consistent with explanations of\nhomicide trends that assign central importance to the rise and decline of crack in\nthe United States.\nThe sharp rise in violence by young people during the late 1980s and the corre-\nspondingly sharp decline in the 1990s are striking. The increase in the aggregate\nhomicide rate was caused by escalating rates among juveniles and young adults,\npredominantly (although not exclusively) by and against black males, particularly\nin the larger cities and predominantly involving handguns. Until 1997, the de-\ncline among those <20 years old was still less than halfway to the stable rate that\nat the end of the downturn; there is some reason to expect that the decline will\ncontinue, at least until it reaches the 1985 level and perhaps even beyond.\nOne aspect of that continued decline in homicide rates could be that smaller\ncities lag behind larger cities by 1\u00ad3 years. Subsequent data from the smaller cities\nwill become available over the next few years to test this speculation. If this specu-\nlation is in fact confirmed, that opens the questions, first, of what forces are driving\nthis process, both up and down, and, second, what factors are contributing to the\nlag between the larger and smaller cities. The evidence available so far, although\nshort of providing unambiguous confirmation, is largely consistent with the earlier\nhypothesis of the sequence that created the rise phase: introduction of crack in\nthe mid-1980s; recruitment of young minority males to sell the drugs; arming of\nthe drug sellers with handguns; diffusion of guns to peers; and irresponsible and\nexcessively casual use of guns by young people, leading to a \"contagious\" growth\nThe subsequent decline is undoubtedly caused by a much more complex pro-\ncess. Some of the drop is attributable to reactions, primarily by police and by\nother groups in the community, to the factors that contributed to the rise--most\nimportantly focused on efforts to remove guns from the possession of young peo-\nple who were carrying them illegally. There are also various independent circum-\nstances that have contributed to the great reduction in violence by young people,\nparticularly changes in crack markets; the strength of the economy, providing op-\nportunities in the legitimate labor market; and general efforts to control guns that\nalso contribute to reduced access to handguns. The steady declines among older\n?\npopulations undoubtedly were assisted by some of these same factors, but also had\nsome of their own distinctive aspects, most particularly reductions in intimate-\npartner violence and increased incarceration. These aspects are addressed in the\nnext sections.\nReactive Response to Factors Contributing to the Rise\nin Violence Among Juveniles and Young Adults\nPolice Response to Gun Carrying by Juveniles Notable among the reactive\nforces are police efforts to remove guns from juveniles. These tactics include a\nmixture of aggressive stop-and-frisk methods, especially in high-violence neigh-\nborhoods (reputed to have been an important part of the response in New York\nCity), introduction of programs offering a bounty to confidential informants for\nreports of illegal guns that lead to confiscation (undertaken in Charleston, SC,\nwith apparent success), and \"voluntary\" searches of homes with suspected illegal\nweapons (with an agreement to confiscate the weapons but with a commitment not\nto press criminal charges for the possession) carried out in St. Louis (50).\nThe theory behind the confiscation strategies lies not only in the benefits of\nthe confiscation itself, but also in the broader deterrent effect that the risk of\nconfiscation has on carrying weapons or even brandishing a gun; these are the\nbehaviors that contribute to the diffusion of guns, especially among young people.\nTo the extent that gun carrying is reduced, the concern over self-protection will\nalso be reduced, which will diminish the incentive for others to carry their own\nguns. Thus, the contagious escalation characteristic of the rise period can display\na similar contagion process of disarmament during the decline period.\nSome of the policing efforts to crack down on juvenile weapon carrying seem\nto have had dramatic impacts. In Boston, a program to decrease gang use of\nguns has nearly eliminated youth gun homicide (40). This project involved a clear\nmessage to gangs to control their level of violence or else face extremely tight\npolice surveillance and control.\nThe Kansas City Weed and Seed program demonstrates the effect of concerted\nefforts by police to get guns out of the hands of juveniles. Police used every\nencounter with youth to search for illegal weapons. In a high-risk neighborhood\nwith a homicide rate 20-fold the national average, the program reduced crime\nby 50% during a 6-month period, without displacement to other neighborhoods\nEnforcement activity and related community-based reactive forces almost cer-\ntainly have contributed to the drop in violence in specific localities. However, the\nmagnitude of this effect is difficult to gauge, largely because levels of violence\nhave also decreased in places with no discernible change in enforcement and be-\ncause the effects of enforcement tend to interact with other influences over which\nthe police and community leaders have little control.\nThe patterns of growth and decline in handgun use at various ages are reflected\nin Figures 18a and 18b, which depict the trends in rates of weapons arrests at\n?\nFigure 18 Trends in arrest rate for weapons offenses by age. (a) Arrests for weapons offenses\n(Sources: Uniform Crime Report and census population data.)\n?\nvarious ages. The pattern is very similar to the homicide patterns depicted in\nFigures 8a and 8b, but there is a much more distinct peaking in 1993, with a clear\ndecline thereafter. Changes in the rate of weapons arrests result from a combina-\ntion of changes in the presence of weapons in the population and changes in police\naggressiveness in pursuing illegal weapons. It is clear from other data (e.g. Figures\n12b and 12c) that there was considerable growth in weapon prevalence during the\nlate 1980s and also that police became more concerned about weapons, especially\nin the hands of young people. That combination is reflected in the rise in weapons\narrests until the peak in 1993. There is no indication that there was any abatement\nby police in their concern about young people's guns after 1993, and so it seems\nlikely that the decline after 1993 owes much more to a reduction in the carrying\nof guns than to a slackening of police efforts to capture the guns. The reduction\nin carrying seems to have contributed to the decrease in homicide after 1993 and\nIndependent Effects Especially on Juveniles and Young Adults\nChanging Drug Markets The independent forces affecting homicide rates are\nof many forms. One involves changes in the nature of the demand for drugs, as\nidentified by Golub & Johnson (32). The decline in the number of new crack users\nin the early 1990s could well have brought some stability to drug markets, allow-\ning them to function in a more secretive and surreptitious manner off the streets\nand reducing the need to keep recruiting young people who are irresponsible in\ntheir use of violence. Those alterations could well have been amplified by the\nmaturity of those managing the supply side of the market, many of whom were the\nsurvivors of the earlier violent period and had opportunity and growing incentives\nto develop dispute resolution mechanisms other than violence, much as their Mafia\npredecessors had done a generation earlier.\nExplanations of the homicide decline that emphasize the central role of changes\nin drug markets are a promising point of departure for subsequent research. For\none thing, they are causally symmetrical; the drug markets were associated with\nboth the increase and the decline in violence. Rates of serious violence, including\nhomicide and robbery, went up during the rise of the crack epidemic and have been\nThe focus on changes in drug markets also helps to account for the variable\ntiming of the peaks and declines in violence across cities. A large coastal city\nsuch as New York, for example, where crack took hold earlier and where it peaked\nsooner than in other cities (22, 32), should have experienced a drop in its rate\nof homicide sooner than in other cities--and it did. An additional advantage of\nthe drug market hypothesis is that it directs attention to the population groups in\nwhich the changes in homicide were concentrated: youths, not necessarily as drug\nusers but as attractive sellers because of their reduced legal liability, and African-\nAmerican youths in particular, who disproportionately participated as sellers in\ninner-city crack markets.\n?\nFinally, the focus on the changing dynamics of the inner-city drug markets\nhelps to explain recent trends in other predatory crimes and the risks associated\nwith them. The decline in the drug markets contributed to the decline in robbery\nrates in a very direct way. Robberies by drug users had to be an important part\nof the growth in robbery rates in the late 1980s. Indeed, it has been suggested by\nBaumer et al (5) that the simultaneous decline in burglaries was associated with the\nsubstitution of robberies for burglaries by drug users in a hurry to get the money to\nbuy more drugs. As the number of drug users declined, the demand for robberies\nto feed drug habits diminished. Also, as the carrying of guns by younger people\ndiminished, casual robberies that capitalized on their newfound power could well\nhave diminished.\nEconomic Expansion Some of the recent decline in homicide rates is almost\ncertainly related to the economic expansion of the past 6 years. Unemployment\nrates have dropped to levels not seen since the early 1970s, and consumer confi-\ndence is higher than in nearly 3 decades (36, 37, 56). It is important that economic\ngains have been shared by racial minorities, teenagers, and high school dropouts,\ngroups at disproportionate risk for serious criminal violence (46).\nThe role of opportunities in the legitimate labor market interacts in complex\nways with changes in the illicit-opportunity structure of distressed urban com-\nmunities. The availability of low-wage jobs in the secondary labor market is\nparticularly relevant when illicit markets and the employment opportunities they\noffer are shrinking. The conventional view of the connection between employment\nand crime portrays individuals, especially teenagers and young adults, as turning\nto criminal activity when their legitimate employment opportunities are restricted.\nThe relationship is likely to operate in the other direction also. Young people can\nalso turn to legitimate jobs in response to dwindling opportunities for illegitimate\nwork. Evidence from Freeman (30, 31) suggests that low-income teenagers will\nsubstitute illegitimate for legitimate work when the perceived rewards of doing so\noutweigh the costs and that a sizable fraction of inner-city young men engage in\nboth legal and illegal activity at the same time, moving from one to the other as\nopportunity permits: \"Someone may need help selling stolen goods; a car with a\nstereo may be parked on a deserted street; the local fast food franchise or super-\nmarket may be hiring. If the opportunity is there, and if the likely gain exceeds\nthe reservation wage, someone will act on it\" (31:17).\nThese observations imply that the effects on criminal involvement of legitimate\nand illegitimate opportunities are fundamentally interactive; when the supply of\nillegitimate opportunities drops, the demand for legitimate work increases. If\nthe assessments of the decline in crack markets in large cities in recent years are\ncorrect, then the movement to legitimate employment should have a particularly\npronounced effect on the level of criminal involvement of low-skilled teenagers\nand especially on their willingness to risk the serious violence associated with\ndrug markets. There may be much to criticize about the low-end \"go nowhere\"\njobs produced during the economic expansion of the 1990s, but they do employ\nteenagers--they are the only kind of jobs for which the great majority of teenagers\n?\nare qualified--and these jobs do reduce the risk of teenagers becoming victims or\noffenders.\nWhatever the other drawbacks of such work, juveniles are far less likely to kill or\nbe killed when working in a fast-food restaurant or supermarket than when selling\ncrack on the street corner outside. These effects, however, are inherently short run,\nnot only because of the cyclical character of legitimate employment opportunities,\nbut also because jobs in the secondary labor market are not, by themselves, a strong\nfoundation for the kind of long-term integration into the mainstream economic and\nsocial life of a community that is necessary to reduce the economic attractions of\ncrime in a permanent way.\nGeneral Decrease in Access to Guns It is clear from the earlier analyses, par-\nticularly those shown in Figures 12b and 12c, that the post-1993 decline in homi-\ncides was associated with a major reduction in the use of handguns in homicides,\neven among adults (Figure 12a). The general efforts to limit the opportunity for\nhigh-risk individuals to purchase handguns, exemplified by the Brady Bill and\nimplemented in 1994, could well have contributed to those effects. The decline\nin weapons arrests for both young adults (Figure 18a) and juveniles (Figure 18b)\nbegan in 1994, the first year the Brady Bill was in effect. The Brady Bill required a\n5-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns from licensed dealers, thereby\ndiscouraging buying by felons. A recent study in California found that individuals\nwith misdemeanor records who were able to buy handguns were more than seven\ntimes as likely to be charged with new offenses as those who had no prior criminal\nrecord (59). A recent study found that denial of handgun purchase to high-risk\nindividuals reduces the subsequent risk of criminal activity (60).\nA Federal Firearm License(FFL)hasbeentraditionallyeasytogetandallowsan\nindividual to purchase guns directly from a wholesaler. FFLs are rarely inspected\nand operate virtually without scrutiny (21). The Brady Bill raised the dealer license\nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) to be more vigorous in its\nregulation of FFLs and guns. As a result, the number of federal firearm dealers\nThe ATF has increased its effort to trace guns and made this information avail-\nable to local jurisdictions. The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative provided\ntrace requests from 27 cities in 1998 (2, 3). Of all illegal-gun-trafficking investig-\nrecovered in 27 cities were from juveniles and 32.4% were from young adults (2, 3).\nJuvenile and young-adult offenders are obtaining both new and used guns through\nthe illegal-gun market. Most guns used by juveniles in crime have been recently\nacquired (51), and over three-fourths of the gun traces involved new guns (2, 3). In\nBoston, 26% of all traceable firearms and >40% of semiautomatic weapons recov-\nered from youths had been involved in crime within 2 years of their first legal sale.\nThis has important implications for the potential effectiveness of interventions. In\n12 of the 17 cities in the 1997 study, the majority of the traced guns originated in\n?\nthe state itself. Thus, efforts to intervene on illegal-firearm traffickers, especially\nwhen combined with aggressive confiscation efforts, can have a potential effect on\njuvenile and youth violence.\nFactors Affecting Older Populations\nIncrease in Prison Population and Incapacitation Effects The incarceration\nrate has increased steeply in the last 25 years. Since the early 1970s, the incar-\npounded growth rate of about 6.5% annually (7). Drug offenses alone account for\nAlthough in one sense changes in sentencing policy and resulting changes in the\nlevels of imprisonment are clearly \"reactive\" concerning the problem of criminal\nviolence, we include them as independent factors in our discussion because the\ndramatic growth in incarceration began a decade before violence rates went up\nin the mid-1980s. Incarceration effects are undoubtedly important contributors\nto the continuing decline of homicide rates among older people, especially for\n(see Figure 9). This connection is particularly close because the median age of\nIncarceration effects are far less likely to have been a significant factor in the\nmore recent decline in violence rates among teenagers and youth, because so few\nof them are incarcerated. In addition, levels of violence have fallen in the younger\nage groups in recent years, even as their incarceration risk has increased. It is\npossible, of course, that the decline might have been less steep in the absence of\nthe \"get tough on kids\" sentencing policies enacted in recent years.\nDeclining Domesticity and Intimate-Partner Violence In addition to the inca-\npacitation effects of increasing incarceration on adults, we have noted a marked\ndrop in homicides involving spouses, ex-spouses, and other \"intimate partners\"\nover the past 2 decades. This decrease, which is especially pronounced among\nAfrican-American adults, results in part from a corresponding drop in \"domestic-\nity,\" that is, declining marriage rates, increasing age at marriage, and high divorce\nrates (48). Some preliminary evidence suggests that the increasing availability of\nlegal advocacy and other domestic-violence services also may have played a role\nCONCLUSIONS\nViolence is both a public health and a criminal justice problem. Neither dis-\ncipline has exclusive jurisdiction; both are necessary to address the continuing\nproblem of violent injuries in our society. Public health and criminal justice can\n?\nbe complementary and integrated into an overall program that will be more effec-\ntive than many efforts in the past (49). Primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies\naimed at the human, environmental, and instrumental elements of violence will\nultimately be necessary. The experience of the last decade and the available evi-\ndence indicate that a number of interventions are necessary and can be successful\nin further decreasing violent crime. Future interventions should focus on the high-\nrisk groups (i.e. juveniles and young adults) and be guided by the success of the\nlast 5 years.\nFinally, the current downturn in rates of violent offenses by and victimization\nof juveniles and young adults, although these rates are still higher than those in the\nearly 1980s, provides an opportunity to consider long-term prevention strategies.\nWhen crime and violence rates are very high, the public demands and the criminal\njustice system provides immediate short-term interventions to reduce violence.\nHowever, when rates are lower, attention may be more properly focused on devel-\noping longer-term interventions, particularly primary prevention, and in providing\nthe chance to develop and evaluate new programs. This may involve changes in\nthe approach to gun ownership, such as registration and licensing, development of\nbetter surveillance and data systems, and early childhood interventions to allow\nchildren to grow up to be healthy, successful, and contributing members of society.\nVisit the Annual Reviews home page at www.AnnualReviews.org\nCity Streets.
