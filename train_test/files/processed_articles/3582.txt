Luke is, therefore, thinking\nsimultaneously about food and people. So, reversing the interpretation of the images, we can read\nthe whole story in terms of food, its consumption, and how the table manners of those who follow\nJesus can be, in this story, a guide to Christian action.\nThe scene is set in 10: 1\u00ad9 when a Roman soldier \u00ad who is neither a Jew nor a gentile follower\nof Jesus \u00ad is praying at the ninth hour and is told by an angel that because of his righteous human\nbehaviour (10: 4) his path and that of Simon Peter would encounter one another. This means that\nhe will be brought within the new covenant community (Lk 22: 20) through an apostle: Peter (Acts\n1: 2). The `back-story' complete, Luke now tells the main story beginning with a hungry Peter.\nPeter is at the sixth hour praying, and becomes hungry and so wants something cooked for\nhim and for this he has to wait. Luke just takes it for granted that we understand that when an\napostle wants food there is some sort of provisioning service available to him \u00ad and we must\nrecall that Peter is not in his own home but a guest lodging with Simon the tanner in Joppa (Acts\n10: 6). However, the guidance offered on how followers of The Way are to receive visiting `apos-\ntles and prophets' in the Didache illumines the situation. Normally, the guests are not to stay\nmore than one or two days (Acts 9: 43 tells us Peter had stayed there some time \u00ad no doubt due\nto his special position as a leader among the apostles), but any apostle or prophet is to be wel-\ncomed `as if they were the Lord'. Clearly, these guests often asked their hosts to provide them\nwith food, because the Didache reminds communities that they are to be given just enough food\nwhen they leave to sustain them until their next lodging, and communities are to be suspicious\nof those who order a banquet for themselves `in the spirit'.6 It was, therefore, taken for granted\nthat Peter, an apostle, would be provided with the food he needed while a guest, and indeed that\nhe had simply to ask for it from their hospitality! It is also clear that other apostles \u00ad a much\nlarger group than `the twelve'7 \u00ad were abusing the customs that we see taken for granted here in\nActs \u00ad and hence the Didache has to offer warning advice to communities.8 One other point\nneeds to be noted: this household in which Peter is lodging is a Jewish household (as we should\nexpect given that this tanner is named `Simon'), and the food that would be provided would be\nlawful in accordance with purity and food customs that claimed their basic authority from Lev\nand the expected customs: `situation normal'.\nWhile Peter awaits his hosts' provision of food, something happens. Luke wants us to imagine\nthis as explicitly out of the ordinary for he tells us that Peter fell into an ecstasy (ekstasis) and so\nthis does not belong to the world of rational discourse or the cultural world of Joppa. A great square\nsheet full of impure animals is lowered down before him; and all these animals are offered to Peter\nas a divine gift of food. The four-cornered sheet is meant to bring to our minds a table cloth and all\nthat is akin to a banquet of many meats suitable for a feast,9 and it can be taken as implying the\nwhole living world as created.10 Peter is to kill and eat, but refuses for he rejects \u00ad and always has\nuntil this moment in his life \u00ad that which is common (koinos) and unclean. Now the voice tells him\nthat God makes all clean, so to call any food `common' is to be untrue to reality \u00ad even if (we are\nto infer) such a statement would be true to the law. Just so that we know this is a serious message\nwe are then told it happened three times \u00ad in the narrative world of the early Christians important\nmoments need to be produced in triplicate.11 But despite the repetition, the significance of the\nvision of all this food offered from heaven for his hunger was not immediately apparent to Peter\nfor, fully awake and back in the world of Joppa, he was `greatly perplexed' (10: 17).\nAt this point the three people sent by Cornelius appear outside and Peter is told by the Spirit that\nhe is to go with them without hesitation \u00ad but before they went anywhere, Peter (a lodger himself\nin Simon's house) `invited them in12 and he received them as guests (exenisen)' (10: 23).13 Peter\nthe guest has now turned into the host, and is extending a welcome to others. This shift in status to\nmake Peter the primary agent of what is happening is demanded by the nature of Luke's message:\nPeter is taking a decisive step and he is fully responsible for it. But what is this step \u00ad surely `giving\nthem lodging' (a common translation) is no more than practical hospitality \u00ad in our parlance `put-\nting them up for the night' \u00ad in view of the fact that they have a long journey to Caesarea to make\nthe next day. It would be quite unreasonable to imagine that a journey of approximately 30 miles\ncould be embarked on immediately by those who had just come from there.14 But this is far more\nthan just `finding them a bed'. What is implicit in welcoming them as guests \u00ad sharing not only the\nhouse space but the table in the house \u00ad is spelled out a little later: Peter will be criticized for having\ndealings with the uncircumcised and for eating with them (11: 3) and will say that at the very\nmoment he met these messengers that `the Spirit told [him] to go with them and not to make a\ndistinction between them and us'(11: 12). In effect, in welcoming these messengers as guests Peter\nhas recognized that one can eat \u00ad precisely because the Spirit has revealed it \u00ad with any of God's\ncreatures because this too has been revealed: no one is common or unclean (10: 28). It is with these\nthree anonymous messengers \u00ad two slaves and a pious soldier \u00ad that Luke imagines The Way mov-\ning beyond the confines of the People of Israel and the boundaries of the Torah. And that boundary\nis transgressed in an act of welcoming and table sharing. Thus Peter \u00ad and so all apostles \u00ad are\nexpected to continue the boundary breaking commensality that was an important theme in Luke's\nportrayal of Jesus: `This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them' (Lk 15: 2).15\nTwo days later, Peter and Cornelius meet in Caesarea, and began to talk. Lest the significance\nof what had already happened in Joppa (when Peter entertained the Gentile messengers) and of\nwhat was now happening in Caesarea be lost on his audience, Luke spells out the settled position\nof the Jerusalem church explicitly. Peter speaks to the assembled Gentile household \u00ad a group that\nalready looks like `a church'16 because they are said to be `in the presence of God' (10: 33) \u00ad thus:\n`You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God\nhas shown me that I should not call any common or unclean' (10: 28). Peter is now formally\nacknowledging what those who were attentive in the audience have already realized: since he wel-\ncomed those messengers as guests, Peter has been living in a new cosmos where nothing can be\ncalled common because all is made good by God.\nCornelius then tells his part of the story (10: 30\u00ad33) and Peter replies with a `history of salva-\ntion'sermon (10: 34\u00ad43) such as Luke places in his mouth on several occasions in Acts.17 But there\nare two variants. First, previous speeches have been addressed to people of Israel, this is addressed\nto the righteous in every nation \u00ad because he now recognizes that God does not have favourites (10:\n35). Second, for the first time the appearance of the risen Jesus contains a reference to the theme of\nthe post-resurrection meals:18 the witnesses to the resurrection are those who ate and drank with\nJesus then (10: 41). Encountering the risen Lord is a meal-sharing experience \u00ad which would have\nbeen heard by Luke's audience in terms of their own Eucharistic meal-sharing.19 Moreover, eating\nis not simply a matter of nourishment or a matter of law keeping: eating and drinking together\nidentify people (in this case as specially chosen witnesses; 10: 41), and is a means of establishing\nthe eschatological community. Sharing food and drink is a serious religious engagement: it can join\nJew with Jew, Jew with Gentile, and the disciple with the Lord.\nWhen Peter had finished his speech, the Holy Spirit fell on the group \u00ad much to the surprise of\nthe six Jewish-Christians (11: 12) that had travelled with Peter \u00ad and so it was evident that `the\nHoly Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles' (10: 44\u00ad45). Then the household was bap-\ntized, and Peter and the other Jewish Christians live as guests in that Gentile household (10: 48).\nBut such radical action demands a reckoning and so the story now moved back to Jerusalem\n(11: 1) where Peter gives an account of what has happened by retelling the vision of the sheet full\nof animals offered him as food (11: 5\u00ad10). This retelling repeats the message that all is created\nclean and so should not be called common (11: 9) and so there is no basis for the objection made\nagainst him that he should not have eaten with the uncircumcised (11: 3). Eating together is seen\nas responding to the divine initiative and to establish a bond that is more profound than circumci-\nsion: indeed, eating ordinary food \u00ad for no food is common or unclean \u00ad together forms the actual\nbond of the ecumenical community of the risen Christ.\nTrances, Voices, and Angels\nOne of the most significant features of the whole story is the density of divine interventions \u00ad in\none form or another \u00ad that characterize the story. It might be objected that such miraculous ele-\nments are found throughout Acts \u00ad the ascension of Jesus into the clouds (1: 9), the destruction of\n12) \u00ad but not with such connected frequency. Indeed, the web of references to `other worldly', and\nthe repetition of these references, suggest that Luke wants us to be more aware here than elsewhere\nof the `other worldly' nature of the task of the apostles and the churches.\nThe first `event' is the vision of `an angel of God' \u00ad as `a man in dazzling clothes' standing\n`before him' `in his house' given to the Gentile, Cornelius. This `holy angel' (10: 22) then\nspeaks to him with his message that God has seen his righteousness. We are told this in Luke's\nvoice from his perfect knowledge as the all-seeing narrator (10: 3\u00ad7); then it is repeated by the\nmessengers, as a report of an event, for Peter's benefit by the messengers (10: 22); then it is\nrepeated by Cornelius himself in oratio recta which re-affirms it and shows that he has under-\nstood its full import (10: 30\u00ad32); and then we hear it a fourth time: when Peter in his own voice\nrepeats Cornelius's account (11: 13\u00ad14), and thus affirms to `his' narrative audience that this\nvision has divine credentials. This angelic visitation is thus one of the most attested events in\nthe whole story of Acts.\nThe second `event' is the trance and vision of Peter where he hears a voice that comes from\nheaven (10: 10\u00ad6).20 Having been given the story in Luke's voice as narrator, it is repeated for us,\nalmost verbatim, as Peter's own experiences (11: 5\u00ad10). From the audience's perspective this not\nonly allows Luke to repeat the key message, but within the logic of the narrative allows him to\npresent Peter `owning this vision' and so all that is implied in it and all that Peter will infer from it.\nMoreover, we the audience have already been given an advantage in understanding in comparison\nwith the disciples in Jerusalem in that Peter has already narrated this as an action of God in his\nspeech to Cornelius's household when he said that `but God has shown me that I should not call\nThe third `event' is when the Spirit speaks to Peter about the messengers and how he is to react\nto them. This is told to us, first, in Luke's voice (10: 19) and then we hear Peter's recollection of\nthis (11: 12) which makes explicit what is implied in the Spirit's message when it is told to us by\nLuke. Through this rhetorical device we do not merely have to take the divine decision on Luke's\nauthority, but we have Peter openly declaring that the Spirit told him that he was not to make a\ndistinction between Jew and Gentile. And practically, this meant that he was not to make such a\ndistinction at table \u00ad which is the very action that has prompted an accusation against him (11: 3)\nand this defence.\nThe fourth `event' is that `the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word' (10: 44). This is\nthen acknowledged \u00ad and so repeated \u00ad as a fact by Peter (10: 47), then recalled in Jerusalem (11:\n15); and repeated yet again as part of the overall conclusion of the story (11:17-8). We, the\naudience, can be under no doubt that this whole sequence of events begins with God, and not\nwith a human situation (contrast Mark 7: 24\u00ad30), is made explicit in its significance by prophetic\nmeans, and that it is to be considered significant in memory through its multiple iterations in the\nnarrative.\nSo why has Luke used so much repetition? This pattern of repetition allows his audience to hear\nthe story at three levels. Most simply we have the account of the narrator, Luke, coming directly to\nus as a series of connected details set in a temporal sequence over a matter of days that we are\nsimply expected to appreciate as historical facts. Within this narrator's level, the repetitions are set\nmerely as recollections, at specific points, of earlier events in the sequence. Then, secondly, we\nhave the direct testimony of the characters in their own voices as they declare the `other worldly'\nacts of which they are witnesses. This is their declaration of the works of God, and on the basis of\ntheir witness we, the audience, are expected to affirm the veracity of the details of the story. The\nthird level is the act of repetition itself, which takes historical form in the recollection by Peter\nwhen he has returned to Jerusalem, and this is presented as being `read into the record'of the whole\nchurch. Thus the repetition, most significantly in Peter's `orderly [kathex\u00e9s] account' (11: 4) as we\nfind it in 11: 5\u00ad17, is the formal ecclesial memory of an event of revelation. Once this `orderly\naccount' is received, it is accepted by the church as the will of God made manifest (11: 18).\nMeanwhile, the audience hearing this are expected to realize that they too must acknowledge the\nstory and hold it as part of their own memory as disciples.\nCustomary Background\nLuke's story presupposes that the issue of how disciples eat with one another is one that he\nconsiders of importance. Apart from what he tells us in the story about hesitations among\nJewish followers of The Way about eating with Gentiles, we have some other hints that throw\nlight on the story.21 The Didache assumes that Gentiles can become part of The Way of Life,\nand also that with regard to food regulations people should do what they are able to do (6: 3),\nand so, by implication, everything less than the Torah is to be seen as a concession. As such, it\ncan be seen as an expression of Jewish Christianity,22 such as we see in Peter at the time he went\ninto the ecstasy (Acts 10: 14), his somewhat startled companions (10: 45), and, more explicitly,\nhis Jerusalem accusers (11: 3). That such a customary background as we find in the Didache is\nthe setting for Luke's story is made more plausible, not only because of the way Peter behaves\nin Simon the Tanner's house, as noted above, but also in the fact that Peter is praying at the\nsixth hour, while Cornelius is praying at the ninth hour \u00ad such a pattern is consistent with that\nprescribed in Didache 8: 3.23 However, there is a hesitation in the Didache in that it assumes\nthat only those who are already baptised can join in the meals of the community (9: 5), and it\nwould be anachronistic to think of these meals as distinct `eucharistic meals' separate from\nother community meals.24 Moreover, the boundary between those with whom one could and\ncould not eat are well patrolled in that the next comment in the Didache is: `Remember what\nthe Lord has said about this: \"do not give to the dogs what is holy\"' (9:5).25 This implies a world\nof holy and common, clean and unclean, insiders and outsiders.26 This is the precise set of\nassumptions among disciples of Jesus such as Peter and his Jerusalem accusers which the story\nin Acts 10\u00ad11 is meant to undermine as baseless. To many early communities \u00ad such as those\nrepresented by the Didache \u00ad eating with outsiders was still problematic, and something that\ncould only take place after their repentance and baptism. Within the Lukan story we have the\npossibility that righteousness and the Spirit are there already, that God shows not partiality, and\nthat no one is to be called unclean \u00ad and so, presumably not referred to as a `dog' \u00ad and so the\nfinal community is established in the act of communal eating.\nContemporary Implications?\nOne of the most bitter27 divisions in Christianity today also concerns with whom one can eat one\nmeal in particular: that of the Eucharist. This prohibition on shared eating and drinking does not \u00ad\nand this would shock both the formulators of the Didache and Luke \u00ad concern non-Christians but\nthose who are Christians (their baptism is not in doubt) but not `with us' in some shape or other.\nThe usual justification for this refusal to make `others' welcome at `our' table (recall Acts 10: 23)\nis that one cannot eat together at the Eucharist as part of a process toward unity, but only after some\njuridically-perfect unity has been achieved. This position \u00ad which de facto then perpetuates senses\nof exclusion, reinforces division, and sets a premium on discovering further elements of disagree-\nment \u00ad is seen as based in the divine nature of the commensality involved, and the detailed ration-\nale to support it varies little whether it emerges from Roman Catholic28 or Orthodox sources.29 But\nbefore proceeding further along this line of thought, there are two preliminary questions needing\nattention. First, to what extent can we see a real connection between the meals being mentioned in\nActs and Eucharistic eating (then or now)? If it is the case that the meals inActs a simple an expres-\nsion of general hospitality \u00ad and for all concerned the Eucharist was something distinct \u00ad then\nseeking to any implication from Acts for Eucharistic practice would be little more than drawing a\npious moral, however apposite, rather than arguing a case from relevant precedents. The second\nissue is that of the significance of any one historical situation to inform us in another, contemporary\nsituation. For many, this second issue hardly arises: if the first issue can be answered satisfactorily,\nthen Scripture qua Scripture can be seen as normative practice; but such an appeal, if made, still\nleaves many questions unanswered and so an attempt to sketch another hermeneutic is in order.\nSo, addressing the first issue, what possible connection has the shared meals described in Acts\nwith the ritual event in contemporary Christianity variously labelled `the Eucharist', `the Lord's\nSupper', `Mass', `Holy Communion', or whatever? Until quite recently \u00ad the late 1970s \u00ad such a\nquestion would have had a definite answer: ordinary eating, even though it might be an expression\nof fellowship and have a `blessing' at its start, was one thing; the `Lord's Supper' as a deliberate\nfulfilment of a dominical command30 was quite another. Ordinary meals were meals, whereas the\nLord's Supper was a theological event utilizing the form of a meal. This interpretation was, in\neffect, little more than the retrojection of much later church practice into the earliest period: just as\ntheir meals and a church-based ritual were quite distinct so too was the practice of the earliest\nChristians, and evidence that seemed to challenge that neat distinction between community meals\nand celebration of the Eucharist such as references to `the Agape' in Jude 12 or the fact that the\nblessings over loaf and cup in the Didache were clearly for use at a real meal were either sidelined\nas irrelevant31 or deviant.32 However, one of the most radical developments in the study of early\nChristian practice in the last few decades has been with regard to their meal practice and its central-\nity in their community life.33 The result of this scholarship \u00ad and it forms the paradigm within\nwhich this article is written \u00ad is that we cannot imagine `meals' and `Eucharists' and then think of\nthem being somehow `combined' or `blended' in early practice,34 but rather must look on such\ndistinctions as later historical developments. Thus the task is to appreciate the meal practices (in all\ntheir diversity) of the Jesus movement, knowing that this was a significant part of their discipleship\n(as witness for example in the number of meal stories about Jesus that they recalled) and something\nthey held to be distinctive about them as a community (as witness Paul's concerns about the meal\npractices in Corinth).35 In these meals the celebrated who they were, they recalled their memo-\nries,36, the heard the kerugma,37 and offered Jesus'blessing of the Father over a loaf of bread which\nwas broken and shared and over cup of some liquid \u00ad we have evidence for the use of water as well\nas of wine38 \u00ad which was then shared. It is against such a view that we have to read all the refer-\nences to meals from early Christianity and so the radical distinction between `the Last Supper'\n(itself a later construct which was read in particular accounts) and the other meals of Jesus, the\nmiraculous feedings, and references to food as in the Bread of Life material in John's gospel \u00ad\nabout which there was endless debate in other exegesis as to whether it was relevant to the Eucharist\nor not \u00ad disappears. All these memories have to be read in the context of the meal experience of\nthose who recalled, valued, and transmitted those stories.39 From this perspective, the meals being\ndiscussed \u00ad and the boundaries they imply \u00ad in Acts 10 have to be seen as part of his contemporar-\nies' concern with meal-sharing as part of their discipleship. Since it is a legacy of that concern that\nproduced the specifically ritual meals, with their token sharing of food, that is called the Eucharist,\nif early practice has any relevance to the practice of modern Christians, then those meals are\nEucharistically relevant. So now we must turn to the second hermeneutical questions.\nTo suggest that practices of the early churches are a norma normans for all subsequent Christian\npractice \u00ad despite the fact that this is a claim that most churches have frequently invoked in the past\n\u00ad is neither practical (for we cannot recreate the social world of the first centuries) nor theologi-\ncally justified (for it would be tantamount to a biblical fundamentalism with all its problems and\nfaults). On the other hand, given that Christians today continue to read texts such as Acts and to\nvalue them as their precious common memories means that we do not simply consign them to the\npast as prologue. In this case I would propose a rather simple hermeneutic: given that we make\nsense of our present in retrospection and recollection, we look to the past as a kind of wondrous\n`mirror' \u00ad one where we sometimes find a reflection in concerns and patterns of behaviour and\nsometimes we find a distinct lack of reflection. In each case, the action of approaching the mirror\nis important in that it allows us to evaluate our own discipleship within our own situation. It could\nbe that we are acting in virtually the same way as those we read about in the past; and this very lack\nof difference is the problem because the external situation has changed; or it could be that we are\nstruck by the differences and these call us to question again our own assumptions even when we\nhave set great value on them.40 It is in this latter manner that I suggest that contemporary concerns\nabout sharing the Eucharistic meal, and the boundaries that are so often applied to its sharing, may\ngain insight from looking at an earlier set of concerns about meal sharing (and as we have seen, this\ninvolved what we would call Eucharistic meal-sharing) and boundaries. The earlier practice is not\nbeing presented as `this is what is should be' but rather as posing a set of important questions for\ntoday which have a right to be considered in both theology and practice precisely because these\nmemories, contained in Acts, are part of the formal memory of churches today in that they hold\nthem as part of their canon and read them at their gatherings. Hence that memory of meal sharing\nand boundaries can be a meaningful part of any contemporary discussion of Eucharistic sharing\nand boundaries.\nSo it is possible look at meal practice in the churches then and today and see how they relate and\nreflect one another; and that is the process that beckons us now if the case of Acts 10\u00ad11 is seen\nwithin this then \u00ad now process of reflection. Whatever way one responds to that reflection, it is\nalways interesting to bring to attention alterative ancient views of matters that concern us espe-\ncially when they come from such figures of authority as an evangelist or from a text that is claimed\nunambiguously as part of the canon or from a memory that is directly linked to no less a figure than\nthe apostle Peter. At the very least, to those who hold that their position is unalterable because of\nits grounding in tradition, history can provide a counter-indicative fact that undermines any claim\nto doctrinal unanimity on a matter! So what do we see in Acts 10\u00ad11? Simply this: eating together\nat a common table is basic not only to the baptized but to all humans who fear God (10: 2). Eating\ntogether cannot just be seen as celebrating the bonds of the ecumenical \u00ad in both senses of the term\n\u00ad community of the risen Christ, but is part of the process by which this community is bought into\nbeing in the actual historical situations in which disciples find themselves. Moreover, the welcome\nto outsiders to come and share our table is part of the invitation that the disciples of The Way offer\nto all human beings who seek God and act uprightly. And, as part of our Christian memory, this\nstory does not claim `apostolic authority'but as Luke relates it with visions and voices: it claims to\nbe part of a specific revelation of God to the church so that it could fulfil its mission of witnessing\nout to the end of the earth (Acts 1: 8 and 13: 47). In sum, it serves as a call to churches that do not\npractice inter-Christian commensality to ask themselves whether they need to rethink in the light\nof the gospel \u00ad that is, the revealed good news which we proclaim \u00ad what is the fuller significance\nof Christian sharing at table.41\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit\nsectors.\nNotes\n 1.

We must avoid thinking that there was some formal distinction (a retrojection of\nlater liturgical experience in the churches) between `feasts', `community meals', and specifically `reli-\ngious' gatherings for `the Eucharist': the core eucharistic activity \u00ad blessing the Father for his goodness\nin Christ \u00ad was part of the communities regular gathering to eat, and this feast was seen in continuity with\nall the meals of Jesus.\nplace in mentioning a) four-footed animals, b) reptiles and c) birds; Paul gives a similar list in Rom 1: 23.\n12. The participle eiskalesamenos indicates that Peter is recalled as taking the initiative \u00ad the messengers are\nnot `barging in' nor `gate crashing' Simon the tanner's hospitality; we are only told what Peter is doing\nand we assume that the messengers are responding to Peter.\n13. This is the third person singular, aorist active indicative of xeniz\u00f3: one cannot make an act deliberately\ndone any clearer.\n14. Luke does not need to tell his audience such details as they all knew the extent that people could travel\nin a day. Given that he knows that Joppa and Caesarea are both on the coast, he probably knew (or knew\npeople who knew) how long it would take to get from one place to another: this knowledge is demon-\nstrated in the time allowed for Peter to travel north to Caesarea with the messengers. Since this is about\n30 miles, and in narrative time they have made it less than a day (21 hours which included a night \u00ad when\nno one travelled except in emergencies) we can assume his audience imagined that the trip was made in\ngreat haste \u00ad it would take them longer than a day to make the return journey with Peter (10: 23b and\n24). As late as 1914, the rule of thumb for the distance that could be marched on a road in one day by fit,\ntrained, infantry was approximately 15 miles.\n15. One can find the theme of Jesus' open commensality throughout Luke's gospel, see Smith DE (1987)\nTable Fellowship as a Literary Motif in the Gospel of Luke. Journal of Biblical Literature 106: 613\u00ad638;\nSmith DE (1989) The Historical Jesus at Table. In: Lull DJ (ed) Society of Biblical Literature: 1989\n16. See TrebilcoP (2011) Why Did the Early Christians Call Themselves he ekklesia? New Testament Studies\n17. Acts 2: 14\u00ad40 is the most exemplary of these `history of salvation' speeches.\n18.

Luke Emmaus story (Lk 24) being his paradigm for the presence of the risen Lord in the churches' meal\nsharing.\n20. Luke does not present it with the exact form he uses in Lk 3: 32, but the sheet comes from an opened\nheaven and then a voice is heard. On such phenomena, see Rowland C (1982) The Open Heaven. New\nYork, NY: SPCK; and also Boring ME (1992) Prophecy (Early Christian). In: Freedman DN (ed) The\n21. This is not to assert that Luke knew the Didache in the form we have it \u00ad though there is nothing which\nrenders that either impossible or unlikely \u00ad but merely to point out that the practices which Luke's story\nassumes as `commonplace' in early communities have marked similarities to those evidenced in the\nDidache.\n22. See Draper JA(2007) The Holy Vine of David Made Known to the Gentiles through God's Servant Jesus:\n`Christian Judaism' in the Didache.

On this pattern of thrice-daily prayer, see O'Loughlin T (2010) The Didache: A Window on the Earliest\nChristians. Grand Rapids, MI: SPCK and Hendrickson, pp. 66\u00ad84; that Peter's prayer at the sixth hour\nmay correspond to the horarium of the Didache was first suggested by K Lake and HJ Cadbury in their\ncommentary on Acts in Foakes Jackson FJ and Lake K (eds) (1933) The Beginnings of Christianity: Part\n1, The Acts of the Apostles. London: Macmillan, pp. 4, 114.\n24. See McGowan AB (1997) Naming the feast: The agape and the diversity of early Christian meals.\nChristian Ritual Meals. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n25. One might point to Mt 7: 6 as `the basis' of the Didache's statement, but this would be to conclude too\nhastily \u00ad all we can say is that the Didache and Mt reflect a common tradition: see Garrow AJP (2004)\nThe Gospel of Matthew's Dependence on the Didache. London: T. and T. Clark; and, for an alternative\nview, see Tuckett CM (2005) The Didache and the Synoptics Once More: A Response to Aaron Milavec.\n26. To see the force of the image of `dogs'one needs to look at this catena of texts: Didache 9: 5; Mk 7: 27\u00ad8\nthose who are wicked, those who are not part of God's first choice, and outsiders.\n28. Catholic Bishops Conferences of England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland (1998) One Bread One Body.\nLondon: Catholic Truth Society \u00ad this is typical of many such statements that reiterate the impossibility\nof intercommunion (except in individual and extra-ordinary circumstances) prior to external canonical\nunion between the Catholic Church and other `ecclesial communities'.\n\u00ad again this is cited as a typical example of the position of those ancient churches who do not see them-\nselves in formal communion with either the Church of Rome or the churches of the Reformation.\n31. See McGowan AB (1997) Naming the feast: The agape and the diversity of early Christian meals.\nChristian Ritual Meals. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21\u00ad22; where he notes that in much schol-\narship the agape became a `convenient dumping ground for all the unwanted meal evidence of the first\nfew centuries'.\n32. Gregory Dix, one of the most influential writers on liturgy in English in the 20th century, sidelined the\nDidache (and so all other evidence relating to any continuity between ordinary meals and the Eucharist\nin a single footnote in his greatest work; Dix G (1948) The Shape of the Liturgy. London: Dacre Press, p.\n48, note 2). On the background to why there was such resistance from many churches \u00ad of all theologi-\ncal shades \u00ad to the notion that the Eucharistic activity of early Christians took place at their ordinary\nmeal gatherings, see O'Loughlin T (2013) Reactions to the Didache in Early Twentieth-century Britain:\nA Dispute over the Relationship of History and Doctrine?

The literature is too vast to list here but four works from different perspectives illustrate the new\napproach: Smith DE and Taussig H (1990) Many Tables: The Eucharist in the New Testament and\nLiturgy Today. London: SCM Press; Smith DE (2003) From Symposium to Eucharist: The Banquet in\nthe Early Christian World. Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press; Witherington III B (2007) Making a Meal\nof it: Rethinking the Theology of the Lord's Supper. Waco, TX: Baylor University Press; Bradshaw P\nand Johnson ME (2011) The Origins of Feasts, Fasts and Seasons in Early Christianity. London: Alcuin\nClub / SPCK.\n34. This would be a `theology of development' (designed as a tool of apologetics by systematicians) been\n`back engineered' to produce a hypothetical history (a process I would consider invalid as part of an\nhistorian's methodology and confusing when used by theologians); on this method and the obfuscation\nit caused in theological debate, see O'Loughlin T (2012) Divisions in Christianity: The Contribution of\n`Appeals to Antiquity'. In: Oliver S, Kilby K and O'Loughlin T (eds) Faithful Reading: New Essays in\nTheology and Philosophy in Honour of Fergus Kerr OP. London: T. & T. Clark, 221\u00ad241.\n37. We see this in the way that Luke presents his story of Paul speaking at a meal (`when we met to break the\nloaf' [arton]) in Troas in Acts 20: 7\u00ad12; on the rendering as `loaf,' see O'Loughlin T (2004) Translating\nPanis in a Eucharistic Context: A Problem of Language and Theology. Worship 78: 226\u00ad235.\n38. See McGowan AB (1999) Ascetic Eucharists: Food and Drink in Early Christian Ritual Meals. Oxford:\nOxford University Press.\n39. This continuity is implicit in most contemporary writing on early Christian meal practice, but it is made\nexplicit in Smith DE (1987) Table Fellowship as a Literary Motif in the Gospel of Luke. Journal of\nSociety of Biblical Literature: 1989 Seminar Papers. Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, pp. 466\u00ad486; and in\nWitherington III B (2007) Making a Meal of it: Rethinking the Theology of the Lord's Supper. Waco, TX:\nBaylor University Press.\n40.

On the significance attached to the table in early Christians' gatherings, see O'Loughlin T (2010) The\nDidache: A Window on the Earliest Christians.
