    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn women with lightly pigmented skin in particular, facial skin color homogeneity decreases with age, primarily due to chronic\nexposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), leading to a decrease in perceived health and attractiveness. Perception of female\nskin may be influenced by continuous exposure to, and thus familiarity with, age-related changes in visible skin condition in a given\nsociety. Men and women of two traditional societies, the Maasai (Tanzania) and the Tsimane' (Bolivia), unfamiliar with lighter\ncolored skin, judged images of British women's facial skin for age, health, and attractiveness. In both samples, images with\nhomogeneous skin color (from the cheeks of younger women) were judged to be younger and healthier and received a stronger\npreference than corresponding images with heterogeneous skin color (from older women). We suggest that (i) human sensitivity\nfor quality-related information from facial skin color distribution is universal and independent of any known age-dependent\nvariation in skin in a given population and (ii) skin discoloration is universally associated with less positive judgment.\n",

Matts7\n Keywords\nskin, women, perception, Maasai, Tsimane'\nEvidence suggests strongly that visible skin color distribution\n(i.e., the homogeneity of the skin chromophores melanin and\nhemoglobin), in addition to skin topography information and\nfacial shape characteristics, has an effect on perception of\nfacial age, health, and attractiveness. For example, visible\nfacial color distribution in shape- and topography-\nstandardized faces of females can account for up to 20 years\nof apparent age (Fink, Grammer, & Matts, 2006), and homo-\ngeneous skin coloration selectively increases visual attention\ntoward female faces, resulting in more positive statements\nabout a woman's face (Fink et al., 2008). Moreover, age,\nhealth, and attractiveness assessments of skin images, isolated\ndigitally the left cheeks of British women, correlate with an\nobjective, quantitative measure of homogeneity (Matts, Fink,\nGrammer, & Burquest, 2007)--skin images with homogeneous\nskin coloration are perceived to be younger, healthier, and\nmore attractive compared with their counterparts displaying\nmore heterogeneous skin color distribution.\nStudies that have manipulated skin color distribution and\nskin surface topography in female faces reported that both\nmales and females are remarkably sensitive to even small\nchanges in these features. Faces with skin surface topography\ncues removed are judged significantly younger and more\nattractive than their original (unmodified) counterparts (Samson,\nFink, Matts, Dawes, & Weitz, 2010).

Similar\neffects have been reported for the manipulation of skin color\ndistribution, showing that a smoothing of facial skin color dis-\ntribution of approximately 25% has a significant effect on\nhealth perception (Samson, Fink, & Matts, 2011).\nThis evidence of the impact of visible skin color distribution\non perception of age, health, and attractiveness has been\nderived almost exclusively from investigations performed by\nindigenous members of Western societies. A common concern\nis that perception may be influenced by numerous (nonbiolo-\ngical) factors, including a general familiarity with age-related\nchanges in skin condition, and ubiquitous images representing\na supposed \"ideal\" of youth, health, and beauty, created and\npropagated by various sectors of industry and media. Because\nthis influence is virtually impossible to control for in an experi-\nmental study, conclusions about possible hardwired mechan-\nisms in deciphering age and health cues from visible skin\ncoloration, in addition to questions about the universality of\nsuch a mechanism, remain speculative.\nIn this present study, we investigated perception of age,\nhealth, and attractiveness of cropped skin images (obtained\nfrom the cheeks of British women) in two nonindustrialized\nsocieties, that is, the Maasai of Ngorongoro, Tanzania, and the\nTsimane' of lowland Bolivia. Should skin discoloration be a\nuniversal concern, independent from familiarity with age-\nrelated changes of that skin, we expected to observe similar\nassessments to those reported in studies using indigenous mem-\nbers of Western, industrialized society. That is, we expected\nskin images obtained from younger women, showing less dis-\ncoloration than those of older women, to be judged as younger,\nhealthier, and more attractive than their older counterparts.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nParticipants comprised 90 individuals (49 men, 41 women) of the\nMaasai, seminomadic pastoralists, of Endulen in the Ngorongoro\nwomen) of the Tsimane', small-scale forager-horticulturalists,\nin the area of Beni in northern Bolivia. Both societies have little\nor no access to Western media (e.g., magazines or newspapers),\nand electricity is unavailable. The study sites are not located near\ntourist destinations. The age of Maasai participants ranged from\nEthical approval of the study protocol and consent proce-\ndures was obtained from local ethical committees at Moscow\nthe University of Wroclaw, and the Great Tsimane' Council.\nStimulus Material\nOur stimuli were 18 color images, isolated digitally from\nphotographs of left profiles of female faces. These women were\nphotographed in the Reading area (United Kingdom) as part of\na larger scale project on perception of female skin (see Matts &\nBritish women and girls from the ages of 11 to 76 years\na custom digital imaging rig comprising a 6.2-megapixel digi-\ntal single-lens reflex camera fitted with a 45 mm f/2.8 P lens\n(Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan), a fully cross-polarized multiple\nflash lighting system, and a chin rest to ensure accurate, repro-\nducible positioning of individuals and overall component sta-\nbility. This setup effectively eliminated visible high-frequency/\nlow-amplitude skin surface topography (microtexture). Images\nwere captured and stored in uncompressed format at a resolu-\nfiltering was applied to these images.\nThe cropped skin image samples from the left hemifaces had\na size of 500 \u00c2 500 pixels and were taken from the same region\nof each face (Figure 1). The cheek area sampled was chosen as\nit was generally devoid of high-amplitude, low-frequency fea-\ntures (e.g., lines, wrinkles, furrows) that would have otherwise\ncontributed significantly to visible contrast. Although the\nextraction of image samples was done automatically, some had\nto be adjusted slightly (i.e., moved to the left or right along the\nx-axis) when the selected region was partly covered by hair or\nincluded facial topography cues. Information on an objective\nmeasure of skin image homogeneity (Haralick's homogeneity\nmeasure; Haralick, 1979) was available from analysis per-\nformed in a previous study (Matts et al., 2007).\nOf the entire set of skin images, one to two images of each\n5-year age cohort (using information on chronological age\nprovided by female participants) were selected randomly (by\ncomputer) for inclusion in the stimulus set for the present study.\nThus, we obtained a set of 18 images that were then printed on\nA6-sized glossy paper at a resolution of 133 dpi. The printouts\nwere laminated and labeled (on the rear of each) with the\nfemale participants' three-digit ID. This set was produced in\nduplicate, one set for presentation with the Tsimane' (Bolivia)\nand another for presentation with the Maasai (Tanzania).\nFigure 1. Skin images isolated digitally from the left hemiface of\nBritish women. Image \"a\" is chosen from the \"young skin\" set (little to\nno skin discoloration), and image \"b\" is from the \"old skin\" set (pro-\nnounced skin discoloration). The actual chronological age of the\nwomen who were imaged was 40 years (image \"a\") and 74 years\n(image \"b\").\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nProcedure\nIn both societies, each participant viewed all 18 cards, one after\nthe other, and was asked to assess them (in blocks) for age,\nhealth, and attractiveness. The order of blocks was randomized\nacross participants, as was the order of images within each\nblock (i.e., the investigator shuffled the cards before the start\nof each block). Participants were requested to estimate the age\nof the person the skin image corresponded to, judge the skin\nimage for health, and provide a statement with regard to attrac-\ntiveness. Participants received verbal instructions and their\nresponses were recorded on paper by the investigators. They\nwere allowed to look at the images for their decision as long as\nthey wished. Responses were recorded as follows: Maasai: age,\n0 \u00bc old, 1 \u00bc young; health, 0 \u00bc unhealthy, 1 \u00bc healthy;\nattractiveness, 0 \u00bc dislike, 1 \u00bc like; Tsimane': age, 0 \u00bc old,\n1 \u00bc adult, 2 \u00bc young, 3 \u00bc baby; health, 1 \u00bc ill, 2 \u00bc average, 3\n\u00bc healthy; attractiveness, 1 \u00bc unattractive, 2 \u00bc average, 3 \u00bc\nattractive. Thus, in both samples, higher scores indicate that the\nrespective skin image was perceived as younger, healthier, and\nmore attractive by the participants compared with those receiv-\ning lower scores.\nResults\nFor the analysis, the images were categorized into two sets\n(\"young skin\" vs. \"old skin\"), based on the chronological age\nof the person whom the image was taken from. The age range\ntive analysis of skin image homogeneity revealed a significant\ndifference between the two sets, with young skin being more\nDescriptive statistics of perceived age, health, and attrac-\ntiveness scores of young skin and old skin images in the Maasai\nand Tsimane' are reported in Table 1. To test for differences in\nage, health, and attractiveness, perceptions of young skin ver-\nsus old skin and a possible effect of participants gender on\nperceptions, mixed-model analyses of variance were performed\nwith skin age-group as within-subject factor and gender as\nbetween-subjects factor, separately for the Maasai and the Tsi-\nmane'. In the Maasai, there was a significant main effect of\np\np\np\np\np\np\nage-group and gender had a significant interaction effect on age\np\np\n\u00bc :14, but not on attrac-\np\n\u00bc :03. Thus, skin images\nobtained from young women were perceived as younger and\nreceived higher health and attractiveness ratings compared\nwith those obtained from older women. Men provided more\npositive ratings than women, and this discrepancy in assess-\nments was particularly evident for age and health assessments\nof young skin (Tukey's test, young skin vs. old skin: men, p <\nIn the Tsimane', there was a significant main effect of skin\np\np\np\np\np\np\nsignificant interaction effects of skin age and gender were\np\nmen and women judged skin images of younger women as\nyounger, healthier, and more attractive. Women's age judg-\nments were higher than men's assessments, although, unlike\nthe Maasai, no significant interaction effects of skin age-group\nand gender could be detected for the three attributes.\nDiscussion\nPrevious studies in Western samples showed that female skin\ncoloration has a significant effect on visual perception of age,\nhealth, and attractiveness, both within whole faces and cropped\nskin images, and that this effect is independent of face shape and\nskin surface topography information (Fink, Matts, & Grammer,\n2006). Moreover, the objective assessment of female skin col-\noration has revealed that the evenness of melanin and hemoglo-\nbin concentrations in skin correlates significantly and positively\nwith assessments of youth, health, and attractiveness (Matts\net al., 2007). The present study shows that these visual assess-\nments of skin quality are not limited to Western observers but\nextend even to societies unfamiliar with lighter colored skin.\nTo date, it has been unclear if and to what extent perception\nof age, health, and attractiveness of facial skin might be driven\nby the observer's familiarity with age- and health-related\nchange within their own skin type. Since we are exposed con-\nstantly to significant individual variation within our own skin\ntype, it is, therefore, possible that responses to age-/health-\nTable 1.

Indeed, the majority of studies on skin-derived\ncues of quality have been conducted in Western, educated,\nindustrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies (Hen-\nrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010) and extrapolated to universal\nhuman behavior.\nOur directly observed data suggest strongly that perception\nof skin color evenness transcends WEIRD societies. Given the\nsimilarities of age, health, and attractiveness perception in the\nMaasai and Tsimane' with that previously reported from indus-\ntrialized societies, and the lack of evidence for cross-cultural\ntransmission effects on quality assessments of lightly pigmen-\nted skin in these societies, we conclude that human sensitivity\nto variation in facial skin color distribution is a universal fea-\nture. The ability to perceive age- and health-related variation in\nfacial skin contrast may have evolved to identify features that\nare particularly relevant in the assessment of female quality in\nthe selection of mating partners. We do not propose that\nhumans have been adapted to skin evenness per se but suggest\nthat sensitivity to derive age- and health-related information\nfrom facial skin color distribution may have developed in con-\nsequence of selection pressures to identify young and healthy\npartners, and this sensitivity may be universal.\nOne may speculate that such selection pressure has acted\nmore strongly on men than on women (which may explain\nhigher male assessments of young skin in the Maasai). How-\never, it is known from investigation of Western samples that\nfacial skin color distribution plays a role in both men and\nwomen, in terms of age, health, and attractiveness perceptions\npreindustrialized societies are sensitive to variation in male\nfacial skin color distribution needs to be tested. We consider\nthis plausible, given the skin images we used in the present\nstudy were independent of facial context. Likewise, future\nstudies should also investigate whether indigenous members\nof Western societies can discern age- and health-related skin\nquality cues of members of preindustrialized societies such as\nthe Maasai and the Tsimane'. We consider this likely, as the\nhuman eye is highly sensitive to visual contrast and as age,\nhealth, and attractiveness assessments of facial skin are prob-\nably based on detecting contrast cues. However, we also expect\nown population skin characteristics to be more nuanced than\nthat of other populations.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that human sensitivity for quality-\nrelated information from facial skin color distribution may be\nuniversal and independent of any known age-dependent varia-\ntion in skin in a given population, as age, health, and attrac-\ntiveness assessments of facial skin are driven by the assessment\nof skin contrast. Cross-cultural comparison of visual skin color\ndistribution perception in relation to skin type (lighter vs. dar-\nker pigmentation), however, may reveal variation in people's\nsensitivity to skin contrast cues and related assessments of skin\nquality.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding\nwas provided by the German Science Foundation (FI 1450/7-2), the\nReferences\nFink, B., Grammer, K., & Matts, P.
