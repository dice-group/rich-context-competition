Prior studies show a decline in sexual activity with age, but\nthese studies often fail to consider the role of sexual satisfaction. The aim of this\nstudy is to give updated prevalence estimates of sexual activity among women\nand to elucidate factors associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.\nMETHODS We report a cross-sectional analysis of the second wave of a nationally\nrepresentative sample of US adults aged 28 to 84 years, the Survey of Midlife\nDevelopment in the United States. The survey used self-administered question-\nnaires to assess demographic data, self-rated physical and mental health, medi-\ncal problems and medication use, relationship factors, and sexual activity and\nsatisfaction.\n(61.8%) women were sexually active in the previous 6 months. The proportion\nof women who were sexually active decreased with advancing age. Women who\nwere married or cohabitating had approximately 8 times higher odds of being\nsexually active (odds ratio\n=\naged 60 years and older who were married or cohabitating, most (59.0%) were\nsexually active. Among women who were sexually active, higher relationship satis-\nfaction (P <.001), better communication (P\n=\n.011), and higher importance of sex\nP\n=\n.040) were related to higher sexual satisfaction, but age was not (P=.79).\nCONCLUSIONS A considerable proportion of midlife and older women remain\nsexually active if they have a partner available. Psychosocial factors (relationship\nsatisfaction, communication with romantic partner, and importance of sex) mat-\nter more to sexual satisfaction than aging among midlife and older women.\nINTRODUCTION\nindividuals aged 65 years and older in the United States, represent-\nyears old. As this unique population moves through midlife and into older\nage, there is an increased interest in how sexuality changes with aging.\nThere is a strong link between a healthy sex life and higher quality of\nlife as individuals age.2-7 Prior studies on the relationship between sexu-\nality and aging in women have shown a decrease in sexual activity and\nsexual function with time.5,8-13 These studies, however, have limitations:\n(1) small sample sizes; (2) a focus only frequency of sexual activity and\ninclude no information on sexual satisfaction, despite sexual satisfaction\nalso being important to women14,15; and (3) the use of clinical practice\u00ad\nbased samples, which may include more women with sexual function com-\nplaints or medical problems than the general population.\nIn this study, we used the second wave of a nationally representative\nsample (the Study of Midlife Development in the United States, MIDUS\nII) of women aged 28 to 84 years to examine the prevalence of sexual\nactivity by age. We identified the correlates of both sexual activity and\nHolly N. Thomas, MD, MS1\nRachel Hess, MD, MS2\nRebecca C.

For each house-\nhold contacted, 1 respondent between the ages of 25\nand 74 years was randomly selected. Older people and\nmen were oversampled. Non\u00adEnglish-speaking and\ninstitutionalized individuals were excluded. Of the\ninterviewed in MIDUS II (mortality-adjusted response\nrate 75%).16 Only women were included in the current\nanalysis. All participants provided informed consent,\nand the Institutional Review Board at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison approved the study.\nMeasures\nParticipants completed a telephone interview and self-\nadministered questionnaires regarding demographics,\nphysical and mental health, and sexuality. Women were\nasked how many sexual partners they had in the previ-\nous 12 months. If they answered any number greater\nthan 0, they were asked, \"Over the past 6 months, on\naverage, how often have you had sex with someone?\"\nA specific definition of sex was not given in the survey,\nand so interpretation was up to the individual. Individu-\nals who answered never or not at all were considered\nsexually inactive; all others were considered sexually\nactive, unless they did not answer the question.\nSexual satisfaction was assessed by the question,\n\"How would you rate the sexual aspect of your life\nthese days?\" Responses were rated using a scale of 0 to\n10, where 0=worst to 10=best. Prior sexual satisfac-\ntion was assessed by the question, \"Looking back 10\nyears ago, how would you rate the sexual aspect of\nyour life at that time?\" using the same 0-to-10 scale.\nImportance of sex was assessed by the question, \"To\nwhat extent would you say that sexual expression is an\nimportant part of your relationships?\" Responses were\nrated using a Likert scale ranging from a lot to some to\na little to not at all. Women who were married or living\nwith someone in a marriage-like relationship were con-\nsidered romantically partnered. Menopausal status was\nassigned based on self-reported bleeding status using\na modification of the Stages of Reproductive Aging\nWorkshop classification.17 Women who had a hysterec-\ntomy but still had 1 or 2 ovaries and women who had\nbilateral oophorectomy were considered as separate\ngroups. Medication use and pain with intercourse in\nthe prior 30 days was evaluated by self-report. Depres-\nsion status was assessed using a validated self-report\nscale based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, 4th Revision diagnosis of depression.18,19\nCommunication was evaluated by the question, \"How\nmuch can you open up to your spouse or partner if you\nneed to talk about your worries?\" with a 4-point Likert\nscale ranging from a lot to not at all.\nStatistical Analyses\nMeans, medians, standard deviations, and percentages,\nas appropriate, were used to describe sexually inactive\nand sexually active women. Poststratification weights\nbased on race, age, and education status provided by\nthe MIDUS II study group20 were used to present\nmeans and percentages for the general population.\nBecause no sampling was conducted for the second\nwave follow-up study, only population-based adjust-\nment weights were created for MIDUS II. Sexual\nactivity was considered as a dichotomous variable (any/\nnone). The sexual satisfaction variable was divided into\nwas used to examine factors that may be related to\nsexual activity based on published literature. Factors\nrelated to the outcome at P <.10 were entered into a\nmultivariate model. Romantic partner factors, such as\npartner age and health status, were highly collinear\nwith whether the respondent was married or cohabitat-\ning and were not included in the multivariate model\nof sexual activity. Univariate ordinal logistic regres-\nsion was used to examine factors that may be related\nto sexual satisfaction. Factors related to the outcome\nat P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate model.\nThe final model met the proportional odds assump-\ntion. Analyses of sexual satisfaction were restricted to\nwomen who were sexually active in the prior 6 months.\nSampling weights were not significantly related to\neither sexual activity or sexual satisfaction and were\nnot used in the regression models. All statistical analy-\nses were conducted with StataSE 13.0 (StataCorp).\nRESULTS\nDemographics\nOf 2,647 women in MIDUS II, more than one-half,\nthe past year, 116 (4.4%) refused to answer the ques-\nrefused to answer the question were older (P <.001),\nmore likely to be postmenopausal (P=.005), less likely\nto be romantically partnered (P <.001), and had lower\nand poorer health (P=.023) than those who answered.\nWomen for whom data were missing were younger\nand had poorer physical (P=.003) and mental health\n(P=.007) than those who responded.\nOf 1,799 romantically partnered women in MIDUS\nwere not romantically partnered, 135 were sexually\nactive. Of all women who responded to the questions\nure 1). Characteristics of sexually inactive and active\nwomen are summarized in Table 1. The mean ages of\nsexually inactive women and sexually active women\n(SD=10.9 years), respectively. Most respondents were\nwhite, and approximately one-half the sample either\nnaturally or surgically postmenopausal.\nThe proportion of women who were sexually active\ndecreased with older age (Table 2). Most (61.2%)\nromantically partnered women were sexually active,\nFrequency of sexual activity differed by age, with older\nwomen reporting less frequent sexual activity than\nyounger women (Figure 2). Overall, 51.9% of the sexu-\nally active women had sex at least once a week, and\n84.7% had sex at least once a month.\nFactors Associated With Sexual Activity\nIn multivariate models, women who were married or\ncohabitating had approximately 8 times the odds of\nwas also strongly related to sexual activity (P <.001);\nwomen who rated sex as more important were more\nlikely to be sexually active. Other factors associated\nwith being sexually active were lack of depression,\nhigher prior sexual satisfaction, younger age, and lower\nbody mass index.\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis for missing\ndata regarding sexual activity. We repeated the analy-\nsis assuming all women who had missing data regard-\ning sexual activity were sexually active, and then\nrepeated the analysis assuming all women who had\nmissing data regarding sexual activity were not sexu-\nally active. Results, including which variables were\nsignificant at the P <.05 level, were similar to those of\nthe primary analysis.\nFactors Associated With Sexual Satisfaction\nMean sexual satisfaction was much higher among\nsexually active women than among sexually inactive\nwomen (Figure 1). Weighted mean satisfaction for\nsexually active and inactive women (including women\nboth with and without romantic partners) was 6.2 vs\n2.3, respectively. Factors associated with higher sexual\nsatisfaction among sexually active women in the multi-\nvariate model included higher relationship satisfaction,\nbetter communication, higher ratings of the impor-\ntance of sex, more frequent sex, higher prior sexual\nFigure 1.

Romantic partner status was the\nfactor most strongly related to whether\na woman was sexually active or not.\nAmong the women who were sexually\nactive, psychosocial factors (such as\nrelationship satisfaction, communica-\ntion with her romantic partner, and\nimportance of sex) were significantly\nrelated to sexual satisfaction, whereas\nage and menopausal status were not.\nOur estimates regarding preva-\nlence of sexual activity in midlife and\nolder women are similar to reported\nestimates, which range from 53% to\n79% depending on the population\nromantically partnered, the prevalence\nof sexual activity was high, even for\nies have suggested that lack of a roman-\ntic partner is one of the most common\nreasons sexual inactivity in this popu-\nrelationship. As women move through\nmidlife and older age, they may lose\nromantic partners to death, divorce, or\nseparation, and become sexually inac-\ntive. Some women, however, may still\nparticipate in sexual activity outside\na cohabitating romantic relationship;\nabout 13% of sexually active women\nin MIDUS II were not married or\ncohabitating.\nLoss of a partner is only one rea-\nson why women may be less likely to\nengage in sexual activity as they age.\nAdvancing age may bring new health\nconcerns in the woman or her partner,\nor menopausal changes, such as vaginal\ndryness, could affect sexual activity. In\nthis analysis, the relationship between\nincreasing age and decreasing sexual\nactivity persisted, even when control-\nling for these factors and others. One\nreason may be a birth cohort effect--\nattitudes towards female sexuality have\nbecome more progressive during the\npast 5 decades,25 and women born in\nlater decades may be more likely to\nparticipate in sexual activity at every\nage or more likely to report being sexu-\nally active on a survey.

Women may adapt\nto these physical changes by changing their sexual\nbehavior. For example, women who develop vaginal\ndryness may incorporate types of sexual activity\nother than penile-vaginal intercourse or incorporate\ntherapeutic aids, such as lubricants. Women may also\nplace more emphasis on other aspects of sex, such as\nemotional closeness, and less emphasis on physical\nsensations.26,27 These recalibrations in expectations sur-\nrounding sex may allow older women to feel sexually\nsatisfied even if their sex lives are different from those\nof their younger years.\nIn contrast to age, psychosocial factors (relation-\nship satisfaction, quality of communica-\ntion with one's romantic partner, and\nimportance of sex) are highly related to\nsexual satisfaction. Prior studies have\nalso shown a close connection between\nrelationship satisfaction and sexual sat-\nexamined communication in particu-\nnication between romantic partners in\ngeneral, not just in relation to sex, was\nassociated with higher sexual satisfaction.\nSexual satisfaction was lower among\nwomen who were not sexually active in\nthe previous 6 months. It may be that\nthese women would prefer to be active\nbut lack a partner or have other interfer-\ning factors. It is also possible that low\nsexual satisfaction led to sexual inactiv-\nity, or that sexually inactive women are\nunsure how to respond to the question\nand mark \"0\" even if they are not sexually\ndissatisfied.\nOur study has several limitations. This\nstudy is cross-sectional, so causality can-\nnot be determined. Second, a validated\nmeasure of sexual satisfaction was not\nused. Third, MIDUS II had limited num-\nbers of racial, ethnic, and sexual minori-\nties. Finally, about 20% women did not\nrespond to the questions regarding sexual\nactivity, which may result in bias.\nHealth care professionals should be\naware that many women maintain or\nwant to maintain a satisfying sex life into\nmiddle age and beyond. Clinicians should\nask women about sexual activity and\nsexual satisfaction and work with women\nto develop strategies to maintain a satisfy-\ning sex life with aging, including ways to\nimprove relationship satisfaction and com-\nmunication, such as relationship therapy.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this\narticle, see it online at http://www.annfammed.\nTable 4.
