Homeownership was\ntraditionally used to stabilize the economy and promote growth. More recently, in some countries,\nCorresponding author:\nSt\u00e9fanie Andr\u00e9, Department of Sociology, Tilburg University, PO Box 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands.\nEmail: s.andre@tilburguniversity.edu\nArticle\nit was believed to function as a private safety net through its association with wealth accumulation\nas part of a so-called `asset-based welfare' strategy aimed at empowering low-income households\n(Sherraden and McBride, 2010). A social goal of homeownership policy is to rejuvenate deterio-\nrated neighborhoods and quell social tensions. Homeownership is also supposed to encourage\nhome maintenance and neighborhood involvement and improvement. With regard to the political\nconsequences, it is argued that there is an association between housing tenure (homeownership,\nsocial, or private renting) and political behavior. Homeownership, by giving people a stake in soci-\nety, would promote confidence in government and empower citizens, which, in turn, induces politi-\ncal participation and enhances democratic legitimacy (McCabe, 2013).\nRecently, several studies addressed the impact of homeownership \u00ad or rather the potential\nto accumulate housing wealth under different housing regimes \u00ad on welfare attitudes. Andr\u00e9\nand Dewilde (2016) found homeowners to be less supportive of government redistribution\nthan tenants. They also found that for homeowners increased financialization of homeowner-\nship was associated with even lower support for redistribution. Ansell (2014) demonstrated\nthat housing wealth seems to work as a self-supplied insurance against life-course risks, with\nowners experiencing house price appreciation becoming less supportive of government redis-\ntribution. He, furthermore, showed that right-wing parties respond to changes in voter prefer-\nences based on house price change by cutting down on redistributive spending during housing\nbooms. While electoral outcomes and policy change are influenced by altered preferences of\nvoters, these may also derive from changes in voter turnout. Such a tenure gap in electoral\nparticipation is particularly relevant when housing tenure is associated with political cleav-\nages and divergent preferences between owners and tenants on social issues (see Barreto et al.,\nRecent electoral participation research focused on explaining differences in turnout between\nsocial groups across countries, for example, the gender gap (Beauregard, 2014), the class gap\n(Anderson and Beramendi, 2012), the educational gap (Armingeon and Sch\u00e4del, 2014), and the\ngenerational gap (G\u00f3recki, 2013). In this article, we research the potential difference in turnout\nbetween homeowners and tenants, that is, the tenure gap in electoral participation.1 To this end, we\nintegrate the `consequences' of housing tenure into Instrumental Motivation Theory (Franklin,\n2001). This theory predicts a higher turnout for those wishing to influence the course of public\npolicy more because (1) they have more resources that enable them to vote, (2) they are more\ninvolved in politics, (3) they have a higher stake in the outcomes of an election and are mobilized\nas such, and (4) institutional arrangements render their vote more consequential, increasing the\nlikelihood of policy change through electoral dynamics. In this article, we argue that housing ten-\nure may influence instrumental motivation to vote in several different ways.\nIn general, a positive association between homeownership and voting in local and national\nelections is found for the United States, where part of this association is mediated by residential\nstability (how long one lives in and is invested in the house and the neighborhood) and financial\ninvestment considerations (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999; McCabe, 2013; Rossi and Weber,\n1996). Engelhardt et al. (2010), however, found no effect for low-income homeowners.\nHowever, comparative research on the presumed political consequences of homeownership is\nscarce.\nA major disadvantage of most studies relates to their weak designs, as it is difficult to disen-\ntangle causation from selection with cross-sectional observational data (Zavisca and Gerber,\n2016). It is unclear whether the homeownership effect on political behavior is causal or (partly)\ndue to selection bias (i.e. the endogeneity problem). The latter implies that higher electoral\nparticipation of homeowners versus tenants may simply arise from `common causes' of both\nhomeownership and voter turnout, such as more socio-economic resources and higher residential\nstability.\nWe improve upon earlier research in several ways. First, we incorporate homeownership as\na potential determinant of voter turnout into Instrumental Motivation Theory. This means that\nwe move beyond purely economic models of voting, since Instrumental Motivation Theory\nincludes mobilization and institutions, besides resources. Second, we elaborate on previous\nUS-focused research on electoral participation by including 18 European countries and the\nUnited States, using more recent data. This enables us to research contextual differences in the\nhomeownership effect. Third, we take better account of methodological issues with regard to\nselection into homeownership (e.g. Engelhardt et al., 2010; Haurin et al., 2003). Social corre-\nlates of homeownership versus renting can largely be attributed to the fact that `different' peo-\nple select into homeownership. Mortgaged homeownership requires a stable income and\nemployment position and is therefore more common among people in a better socio-economic\nposition; these characteristics co-vary with electoral participation. Such observable socio-eco-\nnomic differences can be controlled for within a multivariate analysis framework. However,\nunobserved latent characteristics of people which determine their decision to become a home-\nowner (e.g. trust, lifestyle preferences, and psychological traits) may also influence their pro-\npensity to vote (e.g. Dietz and Haurin, 2003; Zavisca and Gerber, 2016). Although potential\nselection arising from such omitted variable bias is difficult to tackle with cross-sectional data,\nwe improve upon earlier research by preprocessing the data using coarsened exact matching\nWhile we assume that the latent characteristics of individuals potentially increasing their\nlikelihood of both homeownership and higher electoral participation are similar across countries,\nthe institutional context (e.g. tax benefits, rent regulation, and social housing) renders it more\nlikely for some individuals to accumulate savings and to enter homeownership than others. Who\nis selected into homeownership is thus conditional on these contextual arrangements and will\ndiffer between countries. Housing regimes \u00ad defined as the social, political, and economic\norganization of the provision, allocation, and consumption of housing (e.g. Kemeny, 1981) \u00ad\ninfluence the costs and benefits of housing tenures, as well as the average length of residence of\nowners versus tenants. We therefore take into account housing regimes, the likely selection of\ndifferent `types' of people into homeownership by these regimes, as well as their impact on resi-\ndential stability of owners versus tenants and on the other mechanisms influencing people's\ninstrumental motivation to vote.\nTo summarize, our main research questions read as follows: do homeowners and tenants differ\nin their national electoral participation (i.e. tenure gap in turnout)? How does such a tenure gap\nvary by housing regime, and how can we explain such variation? We use data from the second\nwave of the European Social Survey (ESS) (Jowell and The Central Coordinating Team, 2005) and\nonly one where housing tenure is recorded.\nWhy would homeowners have a higher likelihood to vote than\ntenants?\nWe start this section with a brief literature review on the assumed positive relationship between\nhomeownership and turnout. Then, we integrate housing tenure as a potential determinant of voter\nturnout in Instrumental Motivation Theory.\nThe homeownership\u00advoting relationship in earlier research\nPolitical science studies addressing the relationship between homeownership and electoral partici-\npation distinguished between two explanations: residential mobility and economic interest\nmore residentially stable, which provides the opportunity to build a larger social network. These\nextra ties are assumed to encourage electoral participation. Residential mobility in the United\nStates furthermore implies electoral re-registration, which additionally leads to lower turnout.\nSquire et al. (1987), for instance, showed just-moved homeowners to have a lower likelihood to\nvote than residentially stable homeowners. Just-moved homeowners have a similar likelihood to\nvote than tenants with 7\u00ad9years of residential stability. These findings indicate that homeowner-\nship as such and residential stability have separate, independent, effects on voting. In particular,\nhomeowners are assumed to be more involved in their neighborhood because they want to safe-\nguard emotional and financial investments in their property.\nThe positive association found between homeownership and voting in local and national\nelections in the United States was explained by both factors discussed above: residential stabil-\nity and financial investment considerations (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999; McCabe, 2013;\nRossi and Weber, 1996). Other studies used homeownership as a control variable and showed\nMore recently, McCabe (2013) found a positive effect of homeownership on local and national\nvoting in the United States. There are hardly any comparative turnout studies taking homeown-\nership into account. Glaeser and Sacerdote (2000) found no effect in Germany on local and\nnational voting, while DiPasquale and Glaeser (1999) found a positive effect of homeowner-\nship on local voting in Germany, and both found an effect of homeownership on local and\nnational voting in the United States. In the next section, we elaborate on arguments for a posi-\ntive effect of homeownership on electoral participation by integrating them into Instrumental\nMotivation Theory.\nInstrumental motivation theory\nMost studies on voting focus on the (class-based) economic explanation of voting (Lewis-Beck\nand Stegmaier, 2007). British voter studies, however, show homeownership to cut across traditional\nerty ownership to be important for political alignment and related the decreased impact of occupa-\ntional class on party choice to increased homeownership. We therefore incorporate homeownership\ninto the broader theoretical framework of Instrumental Motivation Theory. This theory predicts a\nhigher turnout for those groups that wish to influence the course of public policy more. Such instru-\nmental motivation is promoted by resources, interest in politics, mobilization around specific inter-\nests, and institutional arrangements, for example, the extent to which votes translate into seats\nFirst, individuals with more resources (knowledge, wealth, time, income, and education) are\nmore likely to vote because they can more easily overcome the costs of voting (Verba and Nie,\n1972). Homeowners by definition own housing wealth (and housing debt) in their primary resi-\ndence, while tenants do not. On average, they also hold more financial resources, which made them\nable to enter homeownership in the first place (Di, 2005). These resources may thus be endogenous\nto the tenure-voting association. We expect differences in voter turnout between homeowners and\ntenants across countries to be explained at least partly by such socio-economic differences, that is,\nselection into different tenures.\nA second theoretical mechanism explaining a potential tenure gap in voter turnout relates to\ninterest-based mobilization of homeowners versus tenants. Although the presumed positive\nassociation between homeownership and political participation regularly resurfaces in research\n(e.g. Mau, 2015) and policy (e.g. Dutch Government, 2012), this relationship is not easily\nexplained. The `stake in the system' argument, for instance, implies that homeownership ties\nworkers to the economic system and the local job market through mortgages (Castells, 1977;\nEngels, 1887 [1975]). These are assumed to encourage homeowners to vote for the powers-that-\nbe in order to ensure stability and protect their housing investment. The interests of owners,\nhowever, often stand in opposition to the interests of tenants. Assuming that political parties will\ntailor their programs to different parts of the electorate, both owners and tenants can easily find\na party that suits their needs and interests.2 National debates on the `fairness' of mortgage inter-\nest deduction (MID) or on the frustration of tenants who `miss out' on the gains created through\nhouse price inflation (e.g. `generation rent' in the United Kingdom) may thus mobilize both\nowners and tenants. The stake-in-the-system argument therefore potentially applies to party\nchoice, but not to electoral turnout.\nWe can nevertheless formulate a number of arguments in favor of a positive homeownership\neffect on voter turnout. First, as also suggested by Mau (2015), political or economic interests\naround homeownership derive from its status as a special kind of resource/asset, related to\n\"the stability and concreteness of a home, the long-term nature of the investment, the expected asset\nappreciation and potential capital gain that could be achieved by selling, the emotional connection\nestablished while inhabiting it and the easy (and often tax-favored) transfer of a home to one's children.\"\nIt is no surprise that in economically precarious times where privatized assets (and debts) comple-\nment labor market incomes and social protection (see also Crouch, 2009), (mortgaged) homeown-\ners are mobilized around policies that favor housing wealth accumulation. Although tenants also\nhave housing-related interests, the latter revolve mainly around housing services (cost and quality)\nand do not represent a private asset, as is the case for homeowners. Second, as a `special' kind of\nresource, homeownership positively impacts perceived social status and acts as a symbol of suc-\ncess and middle-class achievement. Owned houses are often larger, of better quality, and situated\nin better neighborhoods (Rohe and Stegman, 1994). Middle-class aspirations toward `increased\nprosperity, security and participation' (Mau, 2015: xi) may encourage homeowners to vote through\nsocial pressure and social control (Feddersen, 2004). Third, individuals who are mobilized by\npolitical parties, unions, and other groups, or are more informed by the media and watch political\nnews, are expected to have a higher propensity to vote (Rosenstone and Hansen, 1993; Verba et al.,\n1995). Such mobilization is easier through existing social networks, and homeowners are, on aver-\nage, more residentially stable than tenants. Residential stability provides the opportunity to build\nsocial networks in the neighborhood (McCabe, 2013) and increases civic engagement, while resi-\ndential mobility, according to Putnam's (1995) re-potting hypothesis, decreases civic engagement.\nUsing German panel data, Lancee and Radl (2014), for instance, found that becoming a home-\nowner incentivizes engagement in the local community as individuals start volunteering more.\nThis homeownership effect may arise from a stakeholder effect partly related to the prospect of\nresidential stability, from social expectations associated with the status of `being a homeowner' or\nfrom increased mobilization through social networks.\nHomeownership may thus reinforce the instrumental motivation to vote through various mech-\nanisms. While some of these mechanisms are linked to residential stability, others are not.\nTherefore (and although previous research mainly looked at local voting), we argue that\nhomeownership may also influence national voting. Policy outcomes at the national level are\nfurthermore seen as important drivers of electoral participation (Franklin, 2001). Housing policy\nis mainly developed at the national level. For example, housing allowances, MID and property\ntaxation are national regulations. Debates on the size of the social rental sector, right-to-buy\nschemes, and MID are covered by national media (Andr\u00e9 et al., in press). National parties profile\nthemselves on their homeownership position. For example, in the United Kingdom, the\nConservative Party presents itself as a homeowners'party (Hamnett, 1999), and in the Netherlands\nhousing became an important electoral issue for all political parties after the global financial crisis\n(GFC) (Andr\u00e9 et al., in press). Finally, politicians taking part in national elections are often cho-\nsen by a local electorate (Gallagher et al., 2006).\nFrom the literature, we can now formulate the following micro-level hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1a. Homeowners have a higher propensity to vote in national elections than tenants\nbecause they have a higher instrumental motivation to do so. Such motivation is derived from\ntheir higher level of resources and from a number of mechanisms enhancing homeownership-\nrelated interests or the perceived social status of homeowners.\nHypothesis 1b. The higher propensity of homeowners to vote in national elections compared\nwith tenants is partly explained by general differences in socio-economic characteristics that\nco-vary with homeownership (selection into homeownership), that is, age, education, income,\npolitical interest, and ideology, as well as by residential stability.\nHousing regimes and the tenure gap in voter turnout\nWhile homeownership became the majority tenure in most European countries, this happened in\ndifferent time periods and for different reasons, which might further influence the tenure gap in\nvoting. Tenure structures and housing outcomes result from ideologically driven power relations\nunderlying qualitatively different institutional arrangements between states, markets, and families.\nIn comparative research, the social production of housing is captured with the term `housing\ninstrumental motivation to vote derived from homeownership to influence the tenure gap in voting.\nVarious factors play a role in this tenure gap, which are described below.\nFirst, housing regimes `cause' selection because they influence the costs and benefits of differ-\nent tenures, rendering them more or less attainable and attractive for different groups of citizens.\nGovernments can, for example, broaden or narrow the conditions of access to social housing or\nspend public resources on MID, the latter making homeownership more economically beneficial.\nOften governments promote homeownership at the expense of renting (Kemeny, 1981; Ronald,\n2008). A second impact of housing regimes arises from tenure differences in residential stability.\nHomeowners are consistently found to be more residentially stable than tenants (i.e. McCabe,\n2013). Reasons for such an effect are financial and emotional investment in the house and neigh-\nborhood, integration in the local job market, and higher costs associated with residential mobility.\nHowever, tenants may be more inclined to stay put when protected by stricter rental regulations\n(OECD, 2011). Tenure security, in combination with high-quality and affordable rental housing\nsubject to some form of rent control, encourages tenants to be invested in their house and neighbor-\nhood, which, in turn increases the costs of residential mobility. We expect housing regimes, by\ncausing systematic differences in residential stability between homeowners and tenants, to moder-\nate the relationship between homeownership and voter turnout.\nWe distinguish between four regimes: market-based homeownership, family-based homeown-\nership, the unitary rental market regime and post-socialist homeownership. For each regime, we\nlay out our expectations pertaining to the instrumental motivation to vote for owners and tenants,\nwhich is derived from (1) selection into homeownership, (2) tenure differences in residential stabil-\nity, and (3) institutional and ideological arrangements around housing influencing social status and\nhomeownership-related interests. We expect the tenure gap in voter turnout to be larger in regimes\nwhere (a) homeownership is the ideologically preferred tenure and thus more associated with per-\nceived social status and moral expectations; (b) the tenure gap in residential stability is higher; (c)\nrental market regulation is less favorable for tenants; and (d) homeownership became more finan-\ncialized (as investment motives influence the instrumental motivation to vote).\nHousing markets became `financialized' when deregulated mortgage securitization in the\n1980s integrated local housing markets into global capital, although this is a geographically une-\nven process. Demand for mortgage lending and credit as well as rising house prices led to specu-\nlative bubbles in the United States, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. In this\nprocess, households became more strongly exposed to house price booms and busts, with poten-\ntially not only higher rewards (capital gains) but also higher risks, such as indebtedness, interest\nrate fluctuations, capital losses, and unaffordability of homeownership for young people (Ronald\nWhile the countries are classified into housing regimes based on characteristics discussed in the\nindicators taken from several macro-level sources. The data are from or closest to 2004, given that\nour survey data are from this year. The table shows, among others, indicators of residential stability\nof homeowners and social tenants (expressed as percentage difference compared to a private rental\ntenant), strictness of rental regulation in the private rental sector (in terms of the rent control score),\nand the extent of housing market financialization (mortgage debt to gross domestic product (GDP)\nratio). The exact sources for Table 1 can be found in the OnlineAppendix (TableA1).Aproblem that\nalways arises with regime classifications is that selected indicators do not capture the full picture;\nthe indicators in Table 1 should thus be seen as a means to describe, rather than classify, countries.\nThe market-based homeownership regime\nCountries that are historically characterized by an active pro-homeownership policy, reflecting an\nideological preference for the provision of state-supported mortgaged-based homeownership\n(Ronald, 2008), are considered part of the market-based homeownership regime. Homeownership\nis seen as the `better' and `natural' tenure, conveying an `adult status' (Colic-Peisker et al., 2015;\nGurney, 1999). Homeownership may thus, more than in other regimes, add to perceived social\nstatus. Since housing is more likely perceived of as a tradable asset, housing wealth expectations\nor risks reinforce investment-related interests. Examples of homeownership policies, varying over\ntime and across countries (Wind et al., 2016), are MID, right-to-buy of council housing, tax exemp-\ntions, and high loan-to-value ratios. These countries tend to have a dual rental market (Kemeny,\n1995). The young and households with limited income are more often found in the (private) rental\nsector, which is lightly regulated. Social housing is shielded from the market, targeted at the poor\nand residual \u00ad and therefore more stigmatized (Kurz and Blossfeld, 2004). The social groups that\nare selected into homeownership are also those that are expected to vote more often in elections\n(higher incomes, higher education, and older age groups). We include France, Ireland, Iceland,\nNorway, the United Kingdom, and the United States in this regime. Table 1 illustrates some char-\nacteristics of the countries in each regime. For example, the difference in residential stability\nbetween homeowners and private tenants is largest in the market-based homeownership regime,\nTable 1.

Tenure residential stability: difference in probability to stay put compared to a private rental tenant.\nand rent control in the private sector is limited. Except for France, countries in this regime have\nhighly financialized mortgage markets (based on mortgage debt to GDP ratio).\nThe family-based homeownership regime\nIn the family-based homeownership regime, homeownership is outright and mainly acquired through\nself-provision by the extended family, pooling resources across generations to overcome credit con-\nstraints (Allen et al., 2004). Since housing is a family asset and housing markets are less financialized,\nhousing is much less tradable and capital gains expectations will affect investment-related interests of\nhomeowners less.Although the government hardly intervenes in the homeownership market, the hous-\ning trajectory is strongly focused on homeownership and is a prerequisite for family formation (Poggio,\n2013). We therefore assume homeownership in this regime to be more strongly associated with social\nstatus. The social rental sector is shielded from the market, but small (dual rental market) and most\nlow-income households live in family-owned housing (Allen et al., 2004). Compared to the market-\nbased homeownership regime, we expect that the private rental sector mostly caters for young house-\nholds that did not make the transition to homeownership yet and for poor households (who are less\npolitically active than the young). We include Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in this regime. Table\n1 shows that the housing market in the family-based regime is less financialized (although housing\nmarket opportunities and risks may play a role in Spain and Portugal), rent control in the private rental\nsector is slightly stricter, and differences in residential stability between tenures are more moderate.\nThe unitary rental market regime\nThe unitary rental market regime is found in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and\nSwitzerland. A unitary rental market is characterized by relatively small differences between the\nlandlords were allowed to enter a state-managed market in exchange for state subsidies. Rent con-\ntrol (as a proxy for strictness of rental regulation) is thus highest in this regime (see Table 1). The\nensuing competition between public and private housing providers results in good-quality and\naffordable housing across rental tenures and income groups (Dewilde, 2017). In Germany, strong\nincreases in the private rental stock since the 1990s arose from the privatization of public housing\nassociated with the termination of subsidy arrangements. Both rental sectors, however, remain\nfairly strictly regulated. The level of social housing is thus only of secondary importance for the\nclassification of Germany into the unitary rental regime.\nIn this regime, all tenures are more or less state-supported. Lower income groups have access to\nbetter-quality rental housing, while the middle-income groups can choose between homeownership\nand renting. Higher income groups are generally in homeownership. We expect the perceived social\nstatus effect to be smaller in this regime, although selection bias is more likely. As the social rental\nsector is not marginalized, residential stability is higher compared to homeowners (OECD, 2011).\nHomeowners are more residentially stable than private tenants (see Table 1) at rates comparable to\nthe family-based homeownership regime. In recent decades, housing markets became strongly\nfinancialized in a subgroup of countries, that is, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Homeownership-\nrelated economic interests thus provide a possible instrumental motivation to vote.\nThe post-socialist homeownership regime\nHomeownership is extremely high and mostly non-mortgaged in the post-socialist regime, compa-\nrable to the family-based regime. This is the outcome of privatization, that is, the sale of\nstate-owned rental housing to tenants for below-market prices and the restitution of property to\npre-communist owners. Houses are, however, often unfit and in bad condition while shared by\ngenerations (Lux et al., 2013; Mandic and Clapham, 1996). This means that the benefits normally\nassociated with homeownership compared to renting are less evident. The lack of development in\nhousing finance following privatization of state-provided housing furthermore implies that invest-\nment-related considerations do not play a role. The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia\nbelong to this regime. Differences in residential stability between owners and private tenants are\nlowest in this regime, as evident from Table 1. Renting is a transitional tenure consisting of residu-\nalized social housing and illegal private renting (Lux et al., 2016).\nWe formulate the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 2a. A larger tenure gap in voter turnout in the market-based homeownership regime\nis likely to arise from several different sources: selection bias, tenure differences in residential\nstability, perceived social status of homeownership, and (mobilization around) homeownership-\nrelated interests in a financialized housing market.\nHypothesis 2b. Compared with the market-based homeownership regime, the tenure gap in\nvoter turnout is smaller in the family-based homeownership regime (less likely selection bias\nand less mobilization around housing-related interests) and in the unitary rental market regime\n(less tenure differences in residential stability) \u00ad although some of these differences are partially\ncontrolled for in the micro-models.\nHypothesis 2c. The tenure gap in voter turnout in the post-socialist homeownership regime will\nbe non-significant, as potential selection bias is minimal and all tenures have high residential\nstability. Housing tenure is far less associated with the mechanisms predicting a positive remain-\ning homeownership effect derived from the instrumental motivation to vote, that is, perceived\nsocial status and homeownership-related economic interests.\nData and methods\nWe use data for 18 European countries from the 2004 ESS (Jowell and The Central Coordinating\n2004, as this is the only round of the ESS which contains high-quality data on both tenure and politi-\ncal behavior for all European countries. This may be a distinctive year since it is in the middle of the\nhousing boom. However, following the economic and housing crisis of 2007\u00ad2008, governments\ndid not fundamentally change their policies toward homeownership; they rather protected housing\nmarkets and (mortgaged) homeowners. Unfortunately, there are no comparative datasets in which\ninformation on housing tenure, political participation, and residential stability are included at the\nsame time. We therefore combine data from different sources and approximate length of residence.\nVariables\nWe coded whether people voted in the last national election (1) or not (0) and excluded those not\neligible to vote. We coded whether any member of the household owned the dwelling (yes (1)/no\n(0)), excluding young adults and students living at home. We unfortunately have no information on\nthe type of rental housing (public/private/rent-free).\nControl variables. Control variables are included in order to minimize the possibility that `common\ncauses' of both homeownership and voting are confounding a potential tenure effect on\nvoter turnout. To control for individual-level differences in political resources and engagement\nwith politics, control variables often used in research on electoral participation (Beauregard, 2014;\nFranklin, 2004) are included. Age is calculated from the year of birth and centered. Gender is\nrecoded into female (1). Education is measured as (1) primary education and not-completed sec-\nondary education; (2) secondary education completed; (3) post-secondary/tertiary, bachelor, mas-\nter completed; and (4) education missing. Income is measured as the country-specific relative\nhousehold income percentile. Marital status is measured with four dummies as `married or living\ntogether', `single', `divorced', and `widowed'. Urban/rural living is measured as `big city', `sub-\nurbs', `small city', and `rural area'. Occupational status is operationalized by means of the Inter-\nnational Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), indicating the cultural and economic\nresources typical for different occupations (Ganzeboom and Treiman, 2014). For those who did not\nhave a valid score, because they were housewives, long-term unemployed, or did not answer the\nquestion, the mean score was imputed and a dummy variable flags this imputation. Internal politi-\ncal efficacy is measured as low (1)/middle (2)/high (3) based on the average on the items `politics\nis too complicated to understand' and `making my mind up on political issues is hard' for ESS\ncountries and with the question `most people in America are better informed about politics than I\nam' for the United States. Political ideology is measured as left/democrat (1) versus middle/inde-\npendent (2) versus right/republican (3), using the left\u00adright self-placement scale of ESS and the\n`feel closer to party' variable from GSS. Political interest is measured as interested (1) versus not\ninterested (0). Political trust is operationalized as the mean score on the partisan trust items in the\nsurvey, because only trust in partisan institutions would enhance voter turnout (Rothstein and\nLength of residence. Length of residence refers to the number of years a respondent lived in the cur-\nrent house based on the date of purchase or of the first lease. Unfortunately, this information was\nnot available in the 2004 waves of ESS and GSS. Therefore, we used other data sources and\nimputed a proxy for length of residence. Length of residence was calculated from European Union\nStatistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC, 2005) for all countries, except Norway\n(EU-SILC 2006) and Switzerland (EU-SILC 2011).4 We made the sample selection comparable to\nESS and GSS, randomly selected one person per household, and measured the length of residence\nbased on the date of purchase or of installment of the rental contract. We calculated the average\nmarried or not, education (low, middle, and high), and tenure (homeowner and tenant). We calcu-\nlated the length of residence for the United States with the 2002 GSS and for the Netherlands with\nthe 2006 wave of the LISS panel.5 Since older people are more likely to have lived longer in their\nhouse, there is a high correlation between length of residence and age (r=0.70).6 We matched\nrespondents (see the next section) on both variables. This also implies that we cannot test specific\nhypotheses on the length of residence effect. We do, however, control for length of residence in the\nbest possible way, given the data at hand. Descriptive statistics of all variables used in the analyses\ncan be found in Table 2.\nAnalytical strategy\nEarlier studies on the relationship between homeownership and electoral participation used multi-\nvariate (and sometimes multilevel) logistic regression analysis with various approaches to the endo-\ngeneity problem (i.e. selection bias). In observational data, the treatment assignment (in our case\nhomeownership) is not controlled by the investigator; this compromises causal inference. Put differ-\nently, selection into homeownership makes it difficult to assess whether a positive association\nbetween homeownership and turnout is explained by instrumental motivations to vote or by charac-\nteristics of people that make them more likely to both vote and be a homeowner. McCabe (2013)\nused placebo measures to control for selection into homeownership, while others used instrumental\nvariable modeling (Aaronson, 2000; DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999). We tackled this issue in two\nways. First, as discussed above and based on the political science and housing literature, we selected\nappropriate control variables that potentially confound the voting\u00adtenure relationship. Second, for a\nbetter and stricter test, we preprocessed our data by means of CEM (Blackwell et al., 2009).\nCEM is a straightforward way to improve causal inference from survey data through matching.\nMatching is a non-parametric data preprocessing approach to control for the confounding influence\nof pretreatment variables and to reduce statistical bias and model dependence (Ho et al., 2007). As\nthe matching procedure balances out owners and tenants in terms of their observed covariates, this\nmethod mainly does a better job of controlling for observables. However, to the extent that the\nobserved variables are correlated with unobservable characteristics associated with tenure out-\ncomes, the likelihood that the latter are balanced out is higher as well (Iacus et al., 2012). In par-\nticular, we argue that by matching on political trust \u00ad a variable which is arguably correlated with\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics of individual-level variables (N=31,176).\nMin Max Mean/% SD\nSource: ESS (Jowell and The Central Coordinating Team, 2004) and GSS (Davis and Smith, 2004), own computations.\nESS: European Social Survey; EU-SILC: EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions; GSS: General Social Survey;\nISEI: International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status; LISS: Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sci-\nences; SD: standard deviation.\na number of unobservable traits, for example, general social trust \u00ad we are able to better control for\nfactors endogenous to the tenure\u00advoting association and are therefore also better equipped to eval-\nuate a potential tenure effect on voting.\nTraditionally, exact matching (one-to-one) would be used and yield a limited number of matches\nby pairing treated units to control units with the same values on covariates. Including continuous\nvariables would almost automatically imply no matches. CEM provides a solution to this problem\nby temporarily coarsening (categorizing) continuous variables into meaningful groups, which\nmakes the likelihood of a match higher and prunes less cases. By subsequently including the origi-\nnal uncoarsened variables in the models and performing statistical estimations, we end up with a\nbetter balanced dataset without losing too many observations. Concretely, we categorized all inde-\npendent variables (including imputed length of residence and political characteristics)7 and\nmatched, per country, each tenant with these specific characteristics to a homeowner with the same\ncharacteristics. Applying CEM reduced the global imbalance of our dataset from 1.0 (total imbal-\nance) to 0 (complete balance), which means that we have complete balance on the (coarsened)\ncovariates (for more information on CEM, see Iacus et al., 2012). The number of respondents\nalso included the original uncoarsened variables that we matched on because these have more vari-\nation than the dummies used in the matching process (Blackwell et al., 2009).\nThe matching procedure also provides a solution for the high correlation between age and length\nof residence (r=0.77). This correlation is high by default. Since we have no direct measurement of\nlength of residence and imputed a proxy from other data sources (based on age, education, gender,\ntenure, and marital status), these were all correlated. Since all of these variables were used in the\nCEM, we are able to bypass this multicollinearity problem. This, however, also implies that we\ncannot attach any meaning, except for `controlled for', to our length of residence measure.\nNormally, when analyzing multiple countries, multilevel analysis is applied to account for the\nclustering of individuals in countries. However, because our intra-class correlation is low (0.08),\nwe use linear regression analysis with the clustered standard errors option in STATA. We also pro-\nvide the results of identical models controlling for country fixed effects in the Online Appendix\n(results are robust).8\nMood (2010) showed that odds ratios cannot be interpreted as effect measures because they also\nreflect the unobserved heterogeneity in the model, which can differ between models or groups. To\ntest mediation and interaction models, it is better to use linear probability models (LPMs), which\nyield unbiased and consistent estimates of a variable's average effect on the chance that the event\noccurs. This means that we will run linear regression models although having a binary dependent\nvariable. The b-coefficients in LPM can be read as average marginal effects on the likelihood of\nvoting (Matter and Stutzer, 2014). We present the individual-level models in Table 3 and the coun-\ntry-level models in Table 4.\nResults\nOur general micro-level hypothesis (Hypothesis 1a) predicted homeowners to have a higher\npropensity to vote in national elections compared with tenants because of their higher instrumen-\ntal motivation derived from more `enabling' resources and from a number of social mechanisms\nwhich enhance perceived social status and homeownership-related considerations. Table 3 shows\nthe individual-level results of the LPMs with country-clustered standard errors. Model 1 (uncon-\ntrolled estimates) confirms our hypothesis as homeowners are 13percentage points more likely\nto vote in national elections than tenants. We assumed this association to be (partly) explained\nby general differences in socio-economic characteristics that co-vary with homeownership\n(`selection into homeownership'), as well as by residential stability differences between owners\nand tenants. Therefore, we control for these characteristics in Model 2a. The estimate for `home-\nownership' becomes smaller (10 percentage points) but remains significant. Since we control\nfor, among others, age, income, and education, we can safely set aside the argument that resources\nalone are responsible for the association between tenure and voter turnout. In Model 2b, we use\nour preprocessed dataset, which has a better balance of homeowners and tenants and potentially\nprovides more certainty as to whether the `treatment' effect of homeownership is `real', rather\nthan arising from pretreatment confounders which remained unmeasured, such as, for example,\ntrust, lifestyle preferences, and personality traits. Model 2b is thus the strictest test possible with\nthe data at hand. We find that the `homeowner' estimate is reduced from 13 to 7\npercentage\nTable 3.

Coef-\nficients are given with robust SEs between brackets.\nHypothesis 2 predicted the tenure gap in voter turnout to be largest in the market-based home-\nownership regime, followed by the family-based homeownership regime and unitary rental mar-\nket regime (the latter regimes having more or less comparable tenure gaps). We expected a\nnon-significant tenure gap in the post-socialist homeownership regime. Figure 1 shows the esti-\nmate for the effect of `homeownership' on voter turnout for each regime and country separately\n(before matching). The first bar is the uncontrolled estimate and the second bar is the `controlled'\nestimate, including a control for our proxy of length of residence. When the tenure gap is statisti-\ncally significant, the bar is dark gray; when it is not significant the bar is light gray.9 For example,\nin the United Kingdom the controlled probability of a homeowner to vote in national elections is\n8 percentage points higher than for a tenant, and this difference is significant. We indeed find the\ntenure gap in voting to be largest in the market-based homeownership regime (in line with\nHypothesis 2a), while the gap is smaller in \u00ad but does not differ between \u00ad the family-based home-\nownership regime and the unitary rental market regime (in line with Hypotheses 2b). In line with\nHypothesis 2c, the homeownership estimate is no longer significant for the post-socialist home-\nownership regime when controlling for measured socio-economic resources and for our proxy for\nresidential stability.\nIn the market-based homeownership regime, we find large and significant estimates for `being\na homeowner' for all countries, except Iceland. In the family-based homeownership regime, esti-\nmates are only significant for Spain and Greece. A possible explanation is that house prices\nincreased more in Spain and Greece between 2001 and 2004 than in Italy and Portugal (European\nMortgage Federation (EMF), 2009), making investment-related considerations a possible driver of\nelectoral participation for homeowners. The differences between the controlled and uncontrolled\ntenure gaps in Greece and Spain are rather small, indicating that resource-based selection into\nhomeownership matters less. In the unitary rental market regime, estimates are, on average, half of\nthose for the market-based homeownership regime.\nAdditional information on Hypotheses 2a\u00adc is provided in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 shows results\nfrom LPMs with country-clustered standard errors. The tenure gap in voting for each regime can\nbe calculated from the interaction estimate for the regime and the main effect of `homeownership'\n(which refers to the tenure gap in the market-based homeownership regime). These tenure gaps are\npresented separately in Table 5. Model 1 presents the uncontrolled tenure gap in each regime,\nModel 2a shows the tenure gap controlled for measured socio-economic differences, length of resi-\ndence, and political variables, and Model 2b shows the controlled tenure gap using CEM, with\ncontrols for the coarsened variables. In part A of Table 5, the tenure gap (i.e. the `homeownership'\neffect) is shown, as well as an indication of its level of statistical significance. In part B, the\ndecrease in the tenure gap compared to Model 1 is shown, alongside an indication of the level of\nstatistical significance of this decrease, based on a 2 test.\nTable 5 shows the extent to which the tenure gap for each regime is reduced after including\ncontrol variables (M2a). The tenure gap is reduced further when in Model 2b we control, as far as\npossible with cross-sectional data (through matching), for selection bias not captured by observed\ndifferences in socio-economic resources. The absolute decreases in the market-based homeowner-\nship regime (11percentage points), the family-based homeownership regime (8percentage points),\nand the unitary rental market regime (7\npercentage points) are larger than in the post-socialist\nhomeownership regime (5percentage points), where less selection was expected. The `remaining'\neffect is, as hypothesized, largest in the market-based homeownership regime, followed by the\nunitary rental market regime and the family-based homeownership regime (which do not signifi-\ncantly differ from each other), while it is no longer significant in the post-socialist homeownership\nregime. These findings are in line with Hypotheses 2a\u00adc.10\nFigure 1. The tenure gap in voting in four housing regimes.\nSource: ESS (Jowell and The Central Coordinating Team, 2004) and GSS (Davis and Smith, 2004), own computations.\nNote: Left bar is the uncontrolled tenure gap, dark striped is significant, and light gray striped is not significant. Right bar is controlled tenure gap, dark means significant\ntenure gap, and light gray means non-significant tenure gap. The right bar is controlled for length of residence, age, gender, marital status, education, income, urban/rural\nstatus, occupational status and political trust, political interest, political efficacy, and political ideology. For comparability, no clustering was applied to calculate the regime\ntenure gaps, and therefore, the numbers slightly differ from Table 4.\nWhen controlling for differences in socio-economic resources as well as tenure-differences\nin residential stability and likely selection, differences between housing regimes diminish con-\nsiderably. However, the tenure gap in voter turnout \u00ad be it of a smaller size \u00ad still remains sig-\nnificant in all regimes, except the post-socialist homeownership regime. Other explanations are\nthus needed in order to explain the higher turnout of homeowners versus tenants. Put differ-\nently, we cannot rule out that homeowners are encouraged to vote through instrumental motiva-\ntions related to perceived social status or homeownership-related (investment) considerations.\nThis is supported by our finding that the tenure gap is highest in countries characterized by a\nstrong pro-homeownership ideology and/or where the financialization of housing markets\nturned owned homes into assets.\nConclusion and discussion\nWhile policymakers and politicians in Europe and the United States justify pro-homeownership\npolicies by referring to its presumed economic, social, and political benefits, we researched whether\nsuch a tenure effect can be established with regard to electoral participation for 19 countries.\nExpansion of homeownership was promoted to include and empower low-income households,\nalthough the (financial) limitations of these strategies became painfully clear after the GFC\n(Schwartz, 2012). Nevertheless, as housing and housing wealth are central to the welfare provision\nof households and to the overall political economy, and will remain so in the foreseeable future, it\nis relevant to research whether the presumed positive effect of homeownership on political partici-\npation is causal or rather due to selection into different housing tenures.\nWe integrated housing tenure in Instrumental Motivation Theory and expected a higher turnout\nof homeowners versus tenants based on perceived social status and economic considerations. In\nTable 5. Tenure gap and decrease in the tenure gap per regime based on Table 4.\n All data All data CEM\nPart A: tenure gap\nPart B: tenure gap decrease\n2 test compared to model 1\nTenure gap decrease in market-based HO\nregime\nTenure gap decrease in family-based HO\nregime\nSource: ESS (Jowell and The Central Coordinating Team, 2004) and GSS (Davis and Smith, 2004), own computations\nCEM: coarsened exact matching; HO: homeownership.\nNote: Part A shows the linear probability model of the tenure gap with robust standard errors within brackets. Part B\nshows the change in the tenure gap compared to Model 1a and significance based on 2 test.\norder to tackle \u00ad to the best of our abilities \u00ad issues with regard to selection bias, potential effects\narising from tenure differences in residential stability, and general data limitations, a variety of\nmethodological tools were used, such as matching (CEM) and the use of an imputed measure for\nresidential stability. The latter means that we have to be cautious with our measure of residential\nstability. We furthermore `approximated' different explanations for the tenure gap in voting by\nexploiting cross-country differences in contextual arrangements.\nWe indeed found a tenure gap in national election participation, and the positive estimate of\n`homeownership' on voting varied in a systematic way across countries and housing regimes. At\nthe micro-level, we found the tenure gap to be partly explained by differences in socio-economic\nresources (although a significant effect remained), tenure differences in residential stability, and\n`additional' selection bias potentially captured through matching. At the macro-level, we showed\nthe tenure effect to be largest in the market-based homeownership regime and smaller in the fam-\nily-based homeownership regime and the unitary rental market regime. In the post-socialist home-\nownership regime, homeowners are no more likely to vote than tenants after controlling for likely\nconfounders. We therefore cannot rule out that homeowners are encouraged to vote through instru-\nmental motivations related to perceived social status or homeownership-related (investment) con-\nsiderations. This is supported by our finding that the tenure gap is highest in countries characterized\nby a strong pro-homeownership ideology, and/or where the financialization of housing markets\nturned owned homes into assets. A limitation of this study is that with the data at hand, we cannot\ndistinguish between these different motives. This should be addressed in future data collection and\nresearch projects.\nPart of the difference in the tenure gap in voting between countries might be attributed to regis-\ntration differences, which may somehow co-vary with housing regimes. When tenants move more\noften than homeowners, this may compromise electoral registration, which would in turn lower\nelectoral participation (Kemp and Kofner, 2010). Although this is a possibility, we still find similar\nestimates in the country fixed-effects models,11 in which all unobserved heterogeneity between\ncountries is controlled for, for example, aspects of the electoral system (Franklin, 2004).\nFuture research should address two other limitations of our study: causality and a measure for\nresidential stability. Although we controlled for the possibility that people who are more likely to\nvote are also more likely to buy a house in the strictest way possible with the cross-sectional data\nat hand, we cannot be sure that we captured all possible confounders. If there are `omitted varia-\nbles' that confound the association between housing tenure and voting but are not related to the\nones we included, CEM will not be a fix to the causality issue. Furthermore, we only approximated\nresidential stability at the micro-level and can therefore not explicitly test for this mechanism.\nFuture research would thus be advised to use panel data (and therefore probably focus on one or\nseveral countries) to overcome these limitations.\nSince we only researched voter turnout, we cannot comment on the association between home-\nownership and other forms of political participation. Although voting is the key political act in all\ncountries under study, other indicators (e.g. membership of political parties) vary more strongly or\nhave different meanings across countries. It would be interesting to replicate this research with\nmore recent data, as the GFC has placed housing at the core of economic and public policy debates\n(Andr\u00e9 et al., in press), and recent housing market dynamics and trends affect outcomes for and\ninterests of homeowners and tenants in several different ways.\nFinally, the hypothesized (positive) homeownership effect on voting in national elections is\npresent, but part of this effect is caused by selection into homeownership. There is no significant\ntenure gap in the post-socialist countries, as well as in five other countries. Better measurements\npotentially would allow for a `complete' explanation of the tenure gap in more countries. Finally,\nhousing regime differences in the tenure gap point at motivations related to both perceived social\nstatus and self-interested investment-related concerns around homeownership as an asset and wel-\nfare resource. Policy-makers should therefore be more cautious when promoting homeownership\nbased on the argument that it turns people into `better citizens' (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999).\nHomeownership may affect one's interests, but it does not change one's character.\n"
