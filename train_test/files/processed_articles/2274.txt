Associations between adult BMI and\ndiabetes, hypertension, and inflammation risk are well established\n(3-5); however, BMI trajectories from adolescence into adulthood\nmay differentially associate with cardiovascular disease (CVD)\nrisk. Studies relating past and current BMI to CVD risk have gener-\nally been conducted in small samples (6), in one sex or ethnic group\nured anthropometry or examined discrete obesity rather than BMI\ntrajectories. Thus, there is a need to investigate relationships\nbetween BMI trajectories and later CVD risk using measured\nanthropometry in large, population-based samples with adequate var-\niation in magnitude and timing of BMI changes.\nIt is also unknown whether weight gain during specific periods in the\nadolescence to young adulthood transition or current weight is most\nrelevant for adult CVD risk. While overweight duration and CVD risk\nhas been addressed in older adult populations (10,11), we know little\nabout the specific periods within the high risk transition from adoles-\ncence to adulthood, when precursors of CVD rapidly develop (16-20).\nWe have shown that diabetes risk is particularly high in individuals\nwho were obese as adolescents relative to those with adult-onset\nobesity (1), but we do not know about the effects of differential BMI\ngain trajectories on diabetes, inflammation, and hypertension, which\ncan inform targeted disease prevention and lifestyle intervention\nefforts.\nTo address whether BMI trajectories across 12 years from adoles-\ncence into adulthood are associated with differential CVD risk, we\ncapitalize on a nationally representative, prospective cohort of\n1 Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health and School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 123 West Franklin\nStreet, Chapel Hill, North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.

We\nhypothesize that at the same age and BMI, adults have differential\ndiabetes, hypertension, and inflammation risk depending upon their\nBMI trajectory from adolescence to adulthood, and, specifically, that\nweight gain in late teen years is more strongly associated with com-\nparatively higher risk than weight gain in the third decade of life.\nMethods\nData source\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is\na longitudinal cohort representative of US middle and high school stu-\nyears). Participants were surveyed a maximum of four times over a 12-\nyear period, with measured anthropometry collected at waves II, III,\nand IV and blood pressure and biomarkers collected at wave IV. Data\nhave been described elsewhere (21) and were approved by the institu-\ntional review board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nInclusion criteria\nThe primary inclusion criteria for this study were that respondents:\nsure, or CRP measured at wave IV (excluded n 5 150), and were\nnot pregnant at time of measurement (excluded n 5 529), resulting\nwere excluded due to small sample size as were 27 individuals with\nmissing race/ethnicity information, resulting in a final analytic sam-\nDependent variable measurement\nBlood pressure (BP) was collected at wave IV using standardized\nprocedures. Systolic and diastolic BP were measured on the right\narm three times (average of second and third used for analysis) at\n30-s intervals after 5-min seated rest using the appropriate cuff size\nand a Microlife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillometric BP monitor (Micro-\nLife USA; Dunedin, FL). Hypertension was defined as systolic/dia-\nstolic BP  140/90 mmHg (3), self-reported doctor diagnosis of\nhypertension, or use of BP-lowering medication.\nHbA1c was measured using colorimetric assays from whole-blood\nspot assays collected from finger pricks (22). Diabetes was defined\nas HbA1c  6.5% (23), self-reported doctor diagnosis of diabetes,\nor indicating the use of diabetes medication.\nCRP was measured using the sandwich ELISA method from whole-\nblood spot assays collected from finger pricks (24). Following\npreviously established recommendations, individuals with CRP  10\nmg/L were excluded due to likely acute infection, which obscures\nCRP as a marker for elevated CVD risk. Inflammation was defined\nIndependent variable measurement\nMain exposure. Height and weight were measured during in-\nhome surveys in waves II, III, and IV using standardized procedures.\nBMI was calculated as weight(kg)/height(m)2 and annualized change\nbetween each measurement wave (BMITime 2\n-BMITime 1\n/year).\nControl variables. Age, sex, current smoking status, and race/\nethnicity were collected using traditional survey methods. Individu-\nals reported medication use in the last 4 weeks, including diabetes,\nhypertension, or anti-inflammatory medication. Additional controls\nwere: parental history of diabetes (diabetes model) and use of\ninflammatory medication, presence of subclinical infection markers,\nand reported current infection/inflammatory disease (inflammation\nmodel).\nStatistical methods\nCVD risk factor models. All analyses were conducted in Stata\n12 (Stata, College Station, TX). In separate logistic regression mod-\nels, we estimated odds of having diabetes, hypertension, or inflam-\nmation at wave IV. Main exposure variables were a series of BMI\nvalues [wave II BMI (adolescence) and annualized BMI change\nbetween waves II-III and III-IV], which allowed us to assess associ-\nations of CVD risk factors with: (1) wave II BMI and (2) BMI\nchanges between waves II, III, and IV while controlling for wave II\nBMI. We used post hoc tests of group differences to test differences\nacross the BMI trajectories. We allowed associations to vary by sex\nby including interaction terms between sex and main BMI exposure\nvariables. Other covariates included sex, race (white, black, His-\npanic, Asian), smoking status (yes/no current smoker waves II, III,\nand IV), wave II age, region of residence (West, Northeast, South,\nMidwest), parental history of diabetes (yes/no) [diabetes model] and\nanti-inflammatory medication use (yes/no), presence of subclinical\ninfection markers (0, 1, 2, or 3 markers), current infections/infla-\nmatory disease (0, 1, 2, or 3 infections/inflammatory diseases at\nsurvey) [inflammation model]. We used Wald tests with significance\nvalue set at P 5 0.1 to test inclusion of specific interaction terms in\nthe models.

Diabetes, hypertension, and\ninflammation were included in the imputation model for BMI and\nsmoking to preserve outcome-predictor associations appropriately\n(29).

We examined differences between the sam-\nple with any missing data (n 5 6,008) versus complete information\n(n 5 7,976) to assess our imputation model assumptions using chi-\nsquared tests (categorical variables) and t tests (continuous varia-\nbles) at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.006 (type 1\nerror rate 5 0.05, nine comparisons). Sensitivity analyses were used\nto examine differences in the imputed and nonimputed data (pre-\nsented in results).\nPresentation of results. We examined differential associations\nin diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation at wave IV (mean age:\n28.8 years) as a function of wave II BMI (mean age: 16.9 years)\ncoefficients are presented in tabular form. We derived BMI trajecto-\nries based on a priori research interests in baseline weight (wave\nII), timing of weight gain between waves, and adult weight (wave\nIV) at wave IV in relation to cardiometabolic risk in adulthood.\nFrom our multivariate model, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diabetes, hypertension, or inflam-\nmation for these a priori BMI trajectories relative to a \"healthy\"\nreferent (stable BMI 5 23 kg/m2 at all waves) and then used post-\nhoc tests to examine trajectory group differences across the BMI\ntrajectories.\nResults\nOur ethnically diverse sample had a baseline mean age of 16.9 years\n(Table 1). Average BMI increased over time. At wave IV, hyperten-\nsion and inflammation were prevalent in under a third of the cohort\nand 6% had diabetes.\nMean BMI and BMI change are presented across diabetes, hyperten-\nsion and inflammation status in Table 2, with significantly higher\nmean values in individuals with (versus without) diabetes, hyperten-\nsion, or inflammation.\nIn general, in adjusted models (Table 3) wave II BMI and BMI\nchange from waves II-III and from III-IV were significantly and\npositively associated with the three CVD risk factors. In model test-\ning, we additionally included interaction terms to test whether wave\nII BMI modified associations between BMI change from waves II-\nIII and III-IV with CVD risk factors, and whether these interactions\nwere also modified by sex. Wald tests for inclusion of all interac-\ntions terms between wave II BMI and the BMI change variables\nwere not significant at a priori-determined 0.1 level for diabetes (P\nthese terms were not retained in the models.\nWe derived 10 BMI trajectories (Figure 1) based on: (1) a priori\nresearch interests regarding baseline weight, timing of weight gain,\nand adult weight in association with future cardiometabolic risk; and\n(2) distributions of BMI and BMI change in our nationally represen-\ntative sample, ensuring that the 10 selected BMI trajectories were\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of the analytic sample, from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health waves II\nCharacteristic Mean or % (SE)\nRace\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)a\nSmoking statusb\nWave IV biomarkers\nWave IV CVD risk factors\naMeasured height and weight were used to calculate BMI (wave II: 10,124 observa-\ncDiabetes defined as HbA1c  6.5%, doctor diagnosis, or self-report of diabetes\nmedication.\ndHypertension defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure  140/90 mmHg, doctor\ndiagnosis, or self-report of antihypertensive medication.\neInflammation defined as high-sensitive C-reactive protein 3-10 mg/L.

Weight gain\nbetween ages 15-20 years was associated with comparatively higher\nodds of diabetes and hypertension than weight gain from ages 20-27\nyears.

Our finding\nthat BMI and BMI change between waves II-IV (mean ages: 17-29\nyears) was strongly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and\ninflammation at wave IV (mean age: 29 years), suggests that this\ntime period is a crucial window during which clinicians can impact\nfuture cardiometabolic health.

For women in our sample,\neven at lower age 27 years BMI, medium/large BMI gain (versus\nstable BMI) between ages 15-27 years was associated with higher\nodds of inflammation. In general, studies suggest comparatively\nstronger associations between BMI gain or loss with CRP increase\n(34) or decline (35) than current BMI (12). Yet the published\nresearch has not addressed the transition from adolescence to young\nadulthood in an ethnically diverse, prospective cohort. Current\ndebate concerning the direction of association between CRP and\nBMI (36) suggests that this association might capture respondents\nmost likely to continue gaining weight, rather than reflecting\nincreased risk from past weight gain.\nOur study is not without limitations. Given that we do not have ear-\nlier measures of BP, HbA1c, and CRP or a history of date of diag-\nnoses, it is possible that our trajectories include time before and\nafter CVD risk factor onset, and thus intentional weight loss after\ndiagnosis may have resulted in weakened observed associations,\neven in our relatively young sample (mean ages: 17-29 years).

A\ngrowing literature suggests differential associations between BMI\nand CVD risk factors by race/ethnicity (37), thus our findings may\nnot be generalizable beyond the US, though national representation\nFIGURE 1 Constructed BMI trajectories used to examine differential odds of diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation in par-\nticipants aged 15 years at wave II, from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.a. aWe derived 10 BMI trajecto-\nries (Figure 1) based on: (1) a priori research interests regarding baseline weight, timing of weight gain, and adult weight in\nassociation with future cardiometabolic risk; and (2) distributions of BMI and BMI change in our nationally representative\nsample, ensuring that the 10 selected BMI trajectories were well represented in the sample (and thus in the United States).\nWe chose the following distributions of BMI and BMI change to construct our trajectories: wave II BMI (23, 30, and 36 kg/\nm2 representing the 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles, respectively), BMI change between waves (1, 4, or 8 BMI unit\nincrease between waves II-III or III-IV representing the 20th, 60th, or 90th percentiles of BMI change, respectively), and\njectories, we then tested hypotheses regarding differential associations between BMI trajectories and CVD risk factors.

Because of survey design and\nloss to follow up across the study period, we imputed missing BMI\ndata for 25% of our observations using state-of-the-art, well-vali-\ndated statistical techniques in an imputation model that included\ncovariates associated with missingness and corrected for survey\ndesign. Given that our largest source of missingness was related to\nstudy design and because the Add Health cross-sectional survey\nweights account for non-response bias (25), we had justification to\nimpute these missing values. We present detailed sensitivity analyses\nto examine model differences using imputed versus nonmissing data.\nOur findings suggest that use of imputed data does not alter our con-\nclusions from the central analyses.\nDespite these limitations, our study makes several contributions to\nthe literature. The age span of our sample is a strength of our study.\nIndeed, it is quite interesting that in this short span of time and at\nthese young ages, BMI and BMI change related differentially to dia-\nbetes, hypertension, and inflammation. Our derived BMI trajectories\nwere well-represented in our nationally-representative sample.\nIndeed our sample provides the only nationally representative, longi-\ntudinal sample with measured height and weight that spans the late\nteen and early adult years. With innovative modeling strategies, we\nestimated contributions of BMI trajectories during the adolescence\nto adulthood transition relative to attained BMI on diabetes, hyper-\ntension, and inflammation risk; this modeling approach can now be\nadapted for use in other ethnicities and during other life cycle peri-\nods to better understand associations between BMI trajectories and\nCVD risk factors as well as high-impact periods for CVD prevention\nand intervention efforts.\nIn this nationally representative, ethnically diverse, prospective\ncohort, diabetes risk in adulthood was strongly related to BMI dur-\ning adolescence and BMI gain between the \"school years\" (teen\nyears) and \"college years\" (early 20s). In contrast, hypertension risk\nin adulthood was strongly related to current BMI, whereas inflam-\nmation risk was positively associated with BMI gain, rather than\ncurrent BMI. Our findings suggest that for given adult BMI, varying\nBMI trajectories from adolescence to adulthood are associated with\ndifferential CVD risk, and that there is utility in targeted counseling\non weight and CVD prevention during these periods. Given increas-\ning prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity, as well as\npotential for large weight gain in the teens and 20s, there is need for\nfurther inquiry into mechanistic links between BMI trajectories and\nCVD risk at different periods of the lifecycle.
