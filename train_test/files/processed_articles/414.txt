The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship\nbetween MSAs and insulin sensitivity among American adults.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data on 4,504 adults without\ndiabetes, aged 20\u00ad79 years, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey 1999\u00ad2004 and had information on MSAs. Self-reported frequency (times/week) of\nMSAs was grouped as low (1), moderate (1\u00ad2.9), or high (3). Insulin sensitivity was mea-\nsured by the fasting quantitative insulin sensitivity check index  100 (QUICKI).\nRESULTS -- After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, physical activity other than MSAs,\nBMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and daily total caloric intake, the mean values for\nfor women.

There were no significant differences across MSA\ngroups for fasting glucose among men or women.\nCONCLUSIONS -- MSA is independently associated with higher insulin sensitivity among\nU.S. adults. Efforts to increase MSA may be a realistic, feasible, and effective method of reducing\ninsulin resistance among the U.S. population.\nStudies (1,2) have demonstrated the\nassociation of muscle-strengthening\nactivities (MSAs) with improved in-\nsulin sensitivity and enhanced glycemic\ncontrol among people with type 2 diabe-\ntes. These observations, along with the\nrecognized benefits of MSA in terms of\nmaintaining functional status and reduc-\ning the odds for other risk factors for\nchronic disease, have led several organi-\nzations to recommend MSAs at the level\nof two or three times per week (3,4).\nDespite this general agreement about\nthe value of strength training, experimen-\ntal interventions have largely lasted only\n3\u00ad6 months (3). Such interventions may\nnot reflect the patterns of MSAs typically\nperformed in the real world, and they may\nnot reveal its natural impact on risk of\ndiabetes or long-term outcomes, as would\nbe available from a population-based,\ncross-sectional study in which partici-\npants report on their customary use of\nIn these analyses, we examine whether\nMSAs and other lifestyle factors are inde-\npendently associated with insulin sensitiv-\nity among U.S. adults by using the U.S.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\nMETHODS\nStudy population and data sources\nThe NHANES, which is conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, is an ongoing representative survey\ndesigned to measure the health and nutri-\ntion status of the civilian noninstitution-\nprobability sample.

The higher the QUICKI value\nthe higher the predicted insulin sensitivity.\nPhysical activity\nHistory of physical activity was obtained\nby a questionnaire administered during\nthe home interview. The MSA level was\nevaluated by asking, \"Over the past 30\ndays, how often did you do any physical\nactivities designed to strengthen your\nmuscles such as lifting weights, push-ups,\nor sit-ups? Include all such activities even\nif you have mentioned them before.\"\nThe American Heart Association (3)\nhas recommended that resistance exercise\nbe done at least twice per week, and Sigal\net al. (4) recommend that resistance train-\ning be performed three times a week. Ac-\ncordingly, we divided self-reported MSA\n(times/week) into three groups: low (1),\nassociated medians were 0, 2, and 5\ntimes/week, respectively.\nParticipants were also asked to report\nthe frequency and duration of moderate\nand vigorous physical activity during the\npast month, allowing for 51 anticipated\nactivities and other reported activities that\nwere not anticipated (9). MSAs such as\npush-ups, sit-ups, weight lifting, and\nwrestling were excluded from the list for\ncalculating physical activities other than\nMSAs (non-MSAs) levels. Non-MSAs es-\ntimated metabolic cost in metabolic\nequivalents (METs) were assigned ac-\ncording to a standardized coding system\ndeveloped by Ainsworth et al. (10) and\nwas defined as the ratio of work metabolic\nrate to standard resting metabolic rate.\nWe assigned MET codes of 4.5 and 7.0 for\nmoderate and vigorous activity, respec-\ntively. One MET is equivalent to the oxy-\ngen consumed during seated rest (3.5\nml of oxygen  kg1  min1. Individuals\nwho did not report any activity lasting at\nleast 10 min were classified as sedentary.\nIn those who reported any physical activ-\nity lasting at least 10 min, physical activity\nwas categorized into two groups based on\nthe median of the MET distribution: mod-\nerate (14.4 MET  h/week) and high\nOther variables\nExposure to tobacco smoke increases the\nconcentration of nicotine in the blood,\nand nicotine is highly specific for such\nexposure.

BMI was\nstrongly and negatively associated with\nQUICKI and positively associated with\nfasting insulin and fasting glucose. In\nmen, age and daily total caloric intake\nwere significantly and negatively associ-\nated with insulin sensitivity. The associa-\ntion of smoking with insulin sensitivity\nwas still present in men in this multivari-\nate model.\nIn additional multivariate analyses,\nwe adjusted for waist circumference ex-\npressed as sex-specific tertiles along with\nnon-MSA, age-group, race/ethnicity,\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption,\nand daily total caloric intake. The result-\ning adjusted means of QUICKI for low,\nmoderate, and high MSA groups were\namong women.\nCONCLUSIONS -- MSAs have im-\nportant implications for health. Resis-\ntance training, which is the most effective\nmethod for developing musculoskeletal\nstrength (13), is correlated with an indi-\nvidual's physical function (14) and is par-\nticularly appropriate among older adults\nwith low cardiorespiratory function\n(15,16). Given the safety and acceptabil-\nity of MSAs, it is disappointing that we\nhave confirmed a low prevalence of MSA\nwith our nationally representative sample\nyears (17). We found that MSAs were as-\nsociated with higher insulin sensitivity as\nevaluated by QUICKI and lower fasting\ninsulin among U.S. adults in the age range\nwe analyzed. Moreover, this association\nwas independent of non-MSAs and actu-\nally stronger in magnitude than the asso-\nciation between non-MSAs and insulin\nsensitivity.\nMost of the previously reported stud-\nies of MSAs and insulin sensitivity were\nperformed among selected subpopula-\ntions evaluated after a few months of\nstructured training (18,19). In these stud-\nies, the benefits of MSA plateau during\nsubsequent months, particularly if the ex-\nercise training program did not contain\nadequate variation (20). In contrast, our\npopulation-based study provides a per-\nspective on the role of habitual resistance\nexercise in natural settings.\nThere have been reports that suggest\npotential physiologic mechanisms by\nwhich MSAs are related to high insulin\nsensitivity (3). In an early report, Miller et\nal. (18) showed that the increased muscle\nmass resulting from strength training was\nresponsible for the attenuated insulin re-\nsponse to a standard 100-g oral glucose\nchallenge in men. Others, however, have\nsuggested that the effect of training is not\ncaused solely by an increase in muscle\nmass and is likely also influenced by ef-\nfects on peak aerobic and maximal work-\ning capacity (e.g., VO2max\npopulation of older men, 9 weeks of high-\nintensity resistance training of the legs fol-\nlowed by 9 weeks of aerobic training on a\ncycle ergometer resulted in changes in\nboth the VO2max\nand the size of the capil-\nlary-fiber interface that were similar to\nthose obtained from 18 weeks of aerobic\ntraining on the ergometer. In another\nstudy, the number of capillaries per\nlength of fiber perimeter was increased\nafter both resistance and aerobic training\nin men aged 65\u00ad74 years, paralleling the\nchanges in VO2max\n, and there was a signif-\nicant positive correlation between the\nchange in capillary supply and VO2max\n(22). In brief, the mechanisms behind the\neffect of strength training seem similar to\nthose seen with aerobic training, even\nthough MSAs mainly recruit type II mus-\ncle (fast-twitch fibers), especially type IIb\nfibers, that are less sensitive to insulin\nthan type I muscle (slow-twitch fibers)\nOther studies, however, have demon-\nstrated that without altering VO2max\n, resis-\ntance training improves insulin sensitivity\nin patients with diabetes (24) and can re-\nduce risk factors for cardiovascular dis-\nease (25). After 6 weeks of one-legged\nresistance training performed three times\nper week, 10 men with diabetes and 7\nmen without diabetes had produced (in-\ndependent of increased muscle mass) in-\ncreased protein content of GLUT4,\ninsulin receptor, protein kinase B-/,\nglycogen synthase, and glycogen synthase\ntotal activity (26).\nTable 3--Multivariate adjusted means (95% CI) for QUICKI, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose, by sex*\nVariable QUICKI P Fasting insulin (pmol/l) P Fasting glucose (mmol/l) P\nMen\nMSA (times/week)\nWomen\nMSA (times/week)\n*Logistic regression adjusted for non-MSA, age-group, race/ethnicity, BMI group, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and daily total caloric intake. Ref., reference\ngroup.\nMuscle-strengthening activity and insulin sensitivity\nIn our study, the relation of MSAs and\nQUICKI among men was attenuated after\nadjusting for tertiles of waist circumfer-\nence but did not change significantly after\nadjustment for BMI. This finding sup-\nports previous research (27) that waist\ncircumference may account for 40% of\nthe variance in insulin action. Hence, we\npropose that MSAs may be a potentially\nbeneficial health behavior for which the\nrelationship with insulin sensitivity may\nbe reflected through reductions in waist\ncircumference. We also propose that\nidentifying the precise mechanism of\nMSA's influence on insulin sensitivity is\nworthy of further exploration.\nStructured aerobic training has been\nrelated to the treatment and prevention of\ninsulin resistance (28). We found initially\nthat non-MSA was associated with higher\ninsulin sensitivity and with lower concen-\ntrations of fasting insulin and fasting glu-\ncose, especially among women (Table 2).\nFor both sexes, however, these statistical\nassociations disappeared following ad-\njustment for MSA levels. In this study,\nnon-MSA is not equal to aerobic physical\nactivity. The lack of an association may\nalso be related to the use of absolute MET\nvalues for categorizing activity into mod-\nerate or vigorous activity.\nFindings on the relationship between\nsmoking and insulin sensitivity and dia-\nbetes are controversial (29,30). Our re-\nsults showed that the relation of smoking\nto insulin sensitivity tends to be J shaped\n(Table 2). However, it is possible that\nsmoking may damage not only pulmo-\nnary cells but also pancreatic cells (31),\nwhich will give the incorrect estimation of\ninsulin sensitivity by using QUICKI.\nOverweight and obesity, as measured\nby BMI, were negatively related to insulin\nsensitivity, a relationship that has been\nwell defined by many studies (32).\nWeight loss reduces the lipid content of\nskeletal muscle in morbidly obese indi-\nviduals, which may contribute to the im-\nprovement of insulin action (33). Our\nstudy supports the notion that physical\nactivity and body weight are indepen-\ndently related to insulin sensitivity (34).\nRegarding consumption of alcohol, as did\nwe found that moderate drinking was re-\nlated to higher insulin sensitivity and\nlower concentrations of insulin. In addi-\ntion, our cross-sectional study found a\nstatistically significant association in men\nbetween lower intake of energy and\nhigher insulin sensitivity (after adjusting\nfor other variables, P  0.024); this asso-\nciation was attenuated among women.\nThese findings were consistent with those\nof Weiss et al. (36), who found that ca-\nloric restriction improved glucose toler-\nance and insulin action among nonobese,\nyears in a 12-month randomized trial. In\ncontrast, Joseph et al. (37) found that 4\nweeks of energy restriction did not im-\nprove insulin sensitivity among women\nThis is the first large study to examine\nhow insulin sensitivity is associated with\nlevels of MSAs as they are performed\namong the U.S. public. While our study\nhad good data quality, was well designed,\nand was intensively controlled and evalu-\nated, it still had a few limitations. With the\ndata available, we were able to perform\nonly a cross-sectional analysis of the pop-\nulation, which limits our understanding\nof the cause-and-effect relationship be-\ntween the variables we evaluated. In ad-\ndition, we lacked direct measurements of\nperipheral insulin sensitivity. We thus re-\nlied on QUICKI, which is derived from\nfasting glucose and insulin concentra-\ntions and reflects primarily hepatic insu-\nlin sensitivity and basal hepatic glucose\nproduction (7,8). Hepatic insulin resis-\ntance, however, correlates strongly with\nperipheral (muscle) insulin resistance\n(38). Although the NHANES computer-\nized interview used the multipass\nmethod, the reliability and validity of self-\nreported physical activity and daily total\ncaloric intake in NHANES have not been\nreported. The physical activity question-\nnaire covered the previous month, and\nthe nutrition questionnaire only covered\nthe previous 24 h. The information pro-\nvided by these questionnaires, therefore,\nmight not represent the participants' rou-\ntine lifestyle over a longer time interval.\nWe lacked information on the intensity\nand duration of MSAs. The intensity with\nwhich the general population exercises\nmay be lower than that prescribed in trials\nof muscular training, and therefore our\nanalysis might underestimate the rela-\ntionship between MSAs and insulin sen-\nsitivity. The use of medications such as\ninsulin, metformin, or thiazolidinediones\nmight modify the associations between\nMSAs and body composition or insulin\nsensitivity, but our analytical sample is\nunlikely to include participants using\nthese drugs because we excluded people\nwith diabetes. In an extra analysis, adjust-\ning for estrogen and progestin use among\nnonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women,\nthe average QUICKI values were 34.1,\nfasting glucose (in mmol/l) were 5.20,\nate, and high MSA, respectively. Regard-\nless, most studies of MSAs and insulin\nsensitivity have been based on small clin-\nical trials and involved small samples of\npeople with diabetes. We have not found\nany such studies on general populations\nwithout diabetes.\nIn summary, this cross-sectional\nstudy found that MSAs are related to\nhigher insulin sensitivity among U.S.\nadults in a manner that is independent of\nage, race/ethnicity, non-MSA, BMI,\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, and total\nenergy intake. MSAs may be a realistic\nand effective way to prevent diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease.\n"
