The aim of the present study was to examine whether\naccelerated atherosclerosis in E0 mice fed a LSD is mediated by aldosterone, using the mineralocorticoid receptor\nblocker, eplerenone (Epl).\nMethods and Results: Mice were divided into three groups: normal diet (ND), LSD and LSD treated with Epl at 100 mg/\nkg per day (LSD+Epl) for 10 weeks. LSD significantly enhanced plasma renin and aldosterone levels, which were further\nincreased in mice fed LSD+Epl. The aortic lesion area increased three-fold with LSD, while LSD+Epl significantly reduced\nthe lesion area to values similar to ND. Serum and peritoneal macrophages obtained from LSD-fed mice exhibited pro-\natherogenic properties including increased inflammation, oxidation and cholesterol accumulation, which were inhibited\nin mice fed LSD+Epl. In a J774A.1 macrophage-like cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, Epl was shown to have a\ndirect anti-inflammatory effect.\nConclusion: In E0 mice, Epl inhibited LSD-accelerated atherosclerosis, despite the elevation of renin and aldosterone lev-\nels. It is therefore suggested that the atherogenic action of LSD could be mediated, at least in part, by activation of the\nmineralocorticoid receptor. In addition, eplerenone may have direct anti-inflammatory actions.\n",

In addition, aldosterone is con-\nsidered to play an important role in the homeostasis of\nblood pressure.1\nA high dietary sodium intake is positively correlated with\nhypertension, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular\ndisease.2 However, restricted dietary sodium intake, although\nit reduces blood pressure, is associated with activation of the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS), and with an\nincreased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).3\nDietary sodium restriction has previously been shown to\naccelerate atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient\n(E0) mice, which was correlated with an increase in angio-\ntensin II (AngII) and plasma cholesterol levels.4 We have\nrecently shown5 that a low-salt diet (LSD) increased serum\naldosterone levels, macrophages inflammation and lesion\nsize in E0 mice. LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor\nknockout mice subjected to a LSD were also shown to have\nincreased plasma renin concentrations and renal expres-\nsion.6 Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\nwas recently shown to reduce serum aldosterone levels, and\nattenuate aortic inflammatory gene expression and athero-\nsclerotic plaque accumulation in E0 mice fed a LSD.7\nMineralocorticoid receptor blockade\ninhibits accelerated atherosclerosis\ninduced by a low sodium diet in\napolipoprotein E-deficient mice\nAyelet Raz-Pasteur1,2, Aviva Gamliel-Lazarovich1, Anna\nGantman1, Raymond Coleman3 and Shlomo Keidar1,2\n Keywords\nAldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptor, eplerenone, low-salt diet, atherosclerosis, inflammation, macrophages\nLipid Research Laboratory,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,\nHaifa, Israel\n2Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel\nDepartment of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Rappaport Faculty of\nMedicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel\nCorresponding author:\nShlomo Keidar, The Lipid Research Laboratory, Rambam Medical\nEmail: skeidar@rambam.health.gov.il\nArticle\nHigh aldosterone levels have been reported to be asso-\nciated with increased rates of CVD.8,9 The adverse effects\nof dietary sodium restriction on the cardiovascular func-\ntion could be attributed to aldosterone, via the mineralo-\ncorticoid receptor (MR). The MR blockers spironolactone,\nand the more specific eplerenone, were shown to improve\ncardiovascular function and enhance survival in patients\nwith CVD. 10,11 In animals with normal serum aldosterone\nlevels, eplerenone has also been shown to inhibit athero-\nsclerosis12 and reduce oxidative stress.13 However, the\nbeneficial effects of MR blockers on oxidative stress in\nmacrophages were only partial when mice were adminis-\ntered high levels of exogenous aldosterone.14 As a sodium-\nrestricted diet was shown to increase both AngII and\naldosterone, the accelerated atherosclerosis induced by a\nLSD could result from the direct effect of AngII or could\nbe due to the effect of aldosterone, which is downstream\nto AngII on the RAAS axis. Thus, the aim of the present\nstudy was to examine the role of aldosterone and/or MR\nactivation in LSD-induced accelerated atherosclerosis by\nantagonizing aldosterone using the MR blocker eplerenone\nin E0 mice.\nMethods\nMice\nThree-month-old E0 mice were randomly divided into\nthree groups (n=6 per group). One group received regu-\nlar chow diet and served as control (ND). The other two\ngroups received a low-salt chow diet (LSD) containing\nIndianapolis, IN, USA); one of these two groups also\nreceived 100 mg/kg per day eplerenone in the drinking\nwater (LSD+Epl). Mice were treated for 12 weeks. Three\nweeks before the end of the experiment, mice were put in\nmetabolic cages for two consecutive days for urine col-\nlection. Blood, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM),\nkidneys, adrenal glands and aortas were harvested at the\nend of the experiment.\nThe animal study protocol was approved by the\nCommittee for the Supervision of Animal Experiments of\nthe Technion - Israel Institute of Technology and was\nconducted in accordance with the Israeli law regulating\nanimal care.\nHistopathology of aortic atherosclerotic\nlesions\nThe heart and entire aorta were rapidly dissected out and\nimmersion-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L\nsodium cacodylate buffer with 0.01% calcium chloride,\npH 7.4 at room temperature. Preparation of the lesion sec-\ntions and histomorphometric analysis have been described\nSerum and urine analyses\nSerum electrolytes and lipids were determined using com-\nmercial kits (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nAldosterone levels were determined using a commercial radi-\noimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Coat-a-count aldosterone; DPC,\nLos Angeles, CA, USA). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was\ndetermined using a commercial RIAkit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,\nMN, USA). Renal function was assessed by measuring urine\nand plasma creatinine and calculating the glomerular filtra-\ntion rate (GFR) according to the following formula: urine\nconcentration \u00d7 urine volume \u00d7 plasma concentration-1.\nBlood pressure (BP) measurement\nBP was measured in conscious mice with a tail-cuff (five\nmeasurements per mouse) linked to an IITC-229 NIBP\nSystem and computer software IITC-31 (Life Science\nInstruments, Woodland Hills, CA, USA).\nSerum lipid peroxidation\nTo determine serum lipid peroxidation, serum samples\nwere incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C in the absence or pres-\nride (AAPH; Wako Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for\n2 hours. AAPH is a water-soluble azo compound that ther-\nmally decomposes to produce peroxyl radicals at a constant\nrate.

Mice were injected with 3 ml phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally. MPMs were har-\nvested from the peritoneal fluid, washed three times with\nPBS and resuspended to 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated\ncin, and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were plated on 1.5 mm\ncoverslips pre-coated with fetal calf serum. Cells were\nincubated in a humidified incubator (5% CO2\n2 hours then washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle\nmedium to remove non-adherent cells.

Mouse macrophage-like\ncell line, J774A.1, purchased from American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA, USA), was plated on 1.5 mm\ncoverslips pre-coated with fetal calf serum. Cells were\neither untreated (control) or activated with 1 \u00b5g/ml lipo-\npolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA), either alone or with the addition of 50 nM eplere-\nnone (LPS+Epl) for 24 hours. Cells were then processed for\nimmunocytochemistry.\n230 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(3)\nImmunohistochemistry of macrophage\ninflammatory markers\nMacrophages grown on coverslips were washed twice\nwith PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min on\nice. Following blocking of non-specific binding sites with\nT-TBS containing 5% BSA, coverslips were stained with\nthe following primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in block-\ning solution: goat anti-mouse C-reactive protein (CRP;\nR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), rat anti-mouse\nIL-6, Armenian hamster anti-mouse MCP-1, rat anti-\nmouse CD54 (ICAM1; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA)\nand rabbit anti-mouse Nf-Kb p65 (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. USA). Following three\nwashes with blocking solution, the respective fluorescein-\nconjugatedsecondaryantibody(JacksonImmunoResearch,\nWest Grove, PA, USA) was applied. Negative controls\nconsisted of slides in which only the second antibody was\nadded. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Slides were exam-\nined in a Nikon E600 upright microscope with Plan Apo\nimaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and visu-\nlaser diode. Image Pro Plus\u00ae 5.0 software (Media\nCybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used for intensity\nanalysis.\nLDL and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) uptake by\nMPM\nLDL was separated from human serum by sequential ultra-\ncentrifugation.16 oxLDL was prepared by incubation of\nfor 2 hours\nat 37\u00b0C. FITC-conjugated lipoproteins were prepared as\ndescribed by Smythe et al.17 MPMs were incubated at\n37\u00b0C for 3 hours with FITC-conjugated native LDL or ox-\nLDL at a final concentration of 25 \u00b5g protein/ml.

Serum\naldosterone levels were 2.5-fold higher in LSD compared\nwith ND mice. Treatment with eplerenone further doubled\nserum levels of aldosterone in mice fed a LSD (Figure\n1A). Adrenal expression of aldosterone synthase was sim-\nilarly enhanced (Figure 1B). Compared to ND, plasma\nrenin levels were significantly increased, by 20% and\n69% for LSD and LSD+Epl mice, respectively (Figure\n1C). Expression of renin in the kidneys of LSD mice was\n2-fold higher than that measured in ND mice, and\nLSD+Epl further enhanced expression of renin by 2.6-\nfold (Figure 1D). Both sodium and potassium secretion\nwere significantly reduced in LSD mice, as expected.\nUrine volumes were not significantly different between\nND and LSD mice. Although eplerenone significantly\nincreased urine volume, the calculated GFR was not sig-\nnificantly different between all groups (Table 1). LSD\nmice had a significantly reduced systolic blood pressure\nEffects of LSD and LSD+Epl on aortic\natherosclerotic lesions\nIn this model, where RAAS is activated by a LSD, ath-\nerosclerosis is indeed accelerated, with aortic lesion\nsize 3-fold larger in LSD compared with ND mice.\nEplerenone significantly inhibited development of ath-\nerosclerotic lesion size in LSD mice, and the size of the\naortic lesions did not significantly differ from those in\nND mice (Figure 2).\nEffects of LSD and LSD+Epl on serum and\nMPM atherogenic properties\nThe anti-atherosclerotic effect of eplerenone could be\nmediated by its action on one or more of the major deter-\nminants of atherosclerotic plaque development: oxida-\ntion, inflammation and cholesterol accumulation. Serum\ntotal cholesterol did not significantly differ between the\ngroups (data not shown). However, high-density lipopro-\ntein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly reduced in LSD\nmice, to 50% of that measured in ND mice. Eplerenone\nattenuated the reduction in HDL in LSD mice, such that\nserum HDL was 28% higher in LSD+Epl mice than LSD\nmice (Figure 3A). As HDL is known to protect serum\nfrom oxidation, we measured the oxidation of sera\nobtained from these mice. Serum oxidation mirrored the\nchanges in serum HDL with increases of 77% serum per-\noxidation in LSD mice compared with only 23% in\nLSD+Epl mice (Figure 3B). The hallmark of atheroscle-\nrotic lesion development is the accumulation of oxidized\nLDL in macrophages. Eplerenone significantly reduced\noxidized LDL uptake by peritoneal macrophages as com-\npared to LSD alone (Figure 3C). However, peritoneal\nmacrophages obtained from all treatment groups did not\nsignificantly differ in their ability to uptake LDL (data not\nshown).\nEffects of eplerenone on macrophage\ninflammation\nEplerenone also had an anti-inflammatory effect as deter-\nmined by CRP expression in peritoneal macrophages\nobtained from treated mice. LSD alone induced 9-fold\nincrease in CRP expression in MPMs compared with ND.\nEplerenone treatment in LSD mice reduced CRP in MPM\nby 69% compared with LSD alone (Figure 3D). The anti-\ninflammatory effect of eplerenone was also observed in\nvitro. The mouse macrophage-like cell line J774A.1, acti-\nvated by LPS, exhibited a marked increase in expression of\ninflammatory markers, which was significantly attenuated\nby 50 nM eplerenone (Figure 4). These results suggest that\nFigure 1. A low-salt diet (LSD) increased renin and aldosterone levels, which were further increased by eplerenone treatment in\nE0 mice.

Renin\nlevels (A) and kidney expression (B), aldosterone circulating levels (C) and adrenal mRNA expression (D) were determined. Results\nTable 1.

The mineralo-\ncorticoid blocker eplerenone was shown to counteract the\nLSD-induced atherosclerosis through effects on reducing\noxidation, cholesterol accumulation, and inflammation.\nHigh dietary salt intake is known to be correlated with\nhigh BP and an increased risk for CVD.2 However, the pre-\nsent study and previous reports6,7 demonstrate that, although\nLSD is associated with lower SBP, LSD is paradoxically\nlinked with an increase in atherosclerosis. Hence, factors\nother than BP per se could be related to the development of\natherosclerosis. The results of the present study, showing\nthat eplerenone reduced LSD-induced atherosclerosis, sug-\ngest that aldosterone may mediate the acceleration of ath-\nerosclerosis, independent of its effects on BP. This is\nsupported by a recently published study, showing that the\nelevation of plasma aldosterone, but not other `classical'\nvariables such as blood pressure, is significantly associated\nwith the progression of atherosclerosis in human.18 The\nresults of the present study are also in line with those of a\nstudy showing that the effect of eplerenone on the develop-\nment of atherosclerosis in monkeys fed a high-cholesterol\ndiet is independent of its blood-pressure lowering effects.19\nPlasma AngII was previously reported to be signifi-\ncantly correlated with aortic atherosclerotic lesion area in\nE0 mice fed a LSD.4 ACE inhibition was shown to prevent\nthe effect of LSD on atherosclerosis,7 while reducing circu-\nlating aldosterone levels. In genetically modified mice,\nwhere RAAS is constitutively activated, atherosclerosis is\naccelerated to a similar extent in LSD and ND mice.7\nConsistent with these reports, our results demonstrate acti-\nvation of RAAS and accelerated atherosclerosis in E0 mice\nfed a LSD. Our results also demonstrate that blockade of\nthe RAAS downstream to AngII in the RAAS axis, using\nspecific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, prevented the\neffects of a LSD on atherosclerosis. Moreover, eplerenone\nsuccessfully reduced lesion size in LSD-fed mice, despite\nadditional increases in renin and aldosterone.\nThe protective effects of eplerenone shown in the pre-\nsent study could contribute to our understanding of LSD-\ninduced atherosclerosis in a number of different ways.\nFirst, as MR is blocked by eplerenone, and as the rate-lim-\niting enzyme for the formation of RAAS up-stream to\naldosterone, i.e. renin, is further elevated in LSD+Epl mice,\nwe would have expected that the extent of atherosclerosis\nwould have been at least similar to that observed in mice\nFigure 2. Eplerenone reduced LSD-accelerated atherosclerosis in E0 mice. The aortic arches from E0 mice treated for 10 weeks\nwith a normal diet (ND), low-salt diet (LSD), or LSD+100 mg/kg per day eplerenone (LSD+Epl), were analyzed for their lesion size\nusing histomorphometric techniques.

However, as feeding LSD+Epl resulted in a com-\nplete prevention of atherosclerosis, it is less likely that\nAngII is the principal mediator of the adverse effects of\nLSD in accelerating atherosclerosis. Second, activation of\nMR was previously suggested, in in vivo and in vitro stud-\nies, to mediate both aldosterone and AngII-induced gene\ntranscription related to cardiovascular injury, fibrosis and\ninflammation.20,21 Thus, even in the presence of elevated\nAngII, the results of the present study may point to a pos-\nsible key role for aldosterone and MR activation, rather\nthan AngII, in the adverse effects of LSD. Third, the `clas-\nsical' effects of aldosterone are mediated by the MR, but\naldosterone also has non-MR effects.22 As we have shown\nprotective effects of eplerenone despite the elevated circu-\nlating aldosterone levels in LSD+Epl, it is suggested that\nMR-mediated, rather non-MR actions of aldosterone, con-\ntribute to the effects of LSD on atherosclerosis.\nAn excess of aldosterone was previously shown to be\nassociated with increased inflammatory status23 and\neplerenone attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory\nmarkers.24 In the present study where endogenous aldoster-\none levels are increased by a LSD, CRP expression is sig-\nnificantly enhanced in MPMs obtained from LSD-fed mice.\nAs the expression of this LSD-induced marker of inflamma-\ntion was attenuated by eplerenone in these mice, we could\nconclude that the anti-inflammatory action of eplerenone is\nrelated to aldosterone antagonism. In this regard, it is inter-\nesting to note that deletion of MR from macrophages has\nSerum\noxidation, nmol\nSerum HDL, mg/dL\nA\n*\n*\nB\n*\n*\nC\n*\n*\nD\n*\nMPM oxLDLuptake, AU\nFigure 3.

Results are expressed\n234 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(3)\npreviously been shown to be protective against macrophage\nactivation and inflammatory response.25,26 However, we\nhave also shown that eplerenone reduced expression of\ninflammatory markers in macrophage-like cells, which were\nactivated by LPS, independent of aldosterone. This result is\nin line with previously reported independent anti-inflamma-\ntory effects of another MR blocker, spironolactone, in mon-\nonuclear cells activated by LPS in vitro27. It is important to\nnote that, although the affinity of spironolactone for the\nreceptor is 10\u00ad20-fold higher than that of eplerenone, the\ndirect anti-inflammatory effects in vitro observed in our\nstudy were achieved at concentrations three orders of mag-\nnitude lower than those of spironolactone in previous stud-\nies.28 Given the high selectivity and the low concentration\nrequired for the direct anti-inflammatory effects of\neplerenone in our study, it is suggested that the MR block-\nade is involved. However, the inflammation signaling path-\nways induced by LPS and inhibited by MR antagonism\nneeds to be elucidated.\nIn addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of eplerenone\nin LSD-fed mice, we have observed other serum and mac-\nrophage anti-atherogenic effects, such as reduced oxLDL\nuptake by macrophages, which was also observed at nor-\nmal RAAS activity in our previous study.14 In agreement\ncholesterol levels in E0 mice. However, LSD reduced\nserum HDL cholesterol in the present study, and eplerenone\nrestored HDL levels in LSD-fed mice. The effect of\neplerenone on serum HDL levels, which is considered to be\nanti-atherogenic,30 together with its effects on oxidation\nand oxidized cholesterol uptake by macrophages, make this\ndrug efficient in limiting plaque accumulation under condi-\ntions of activated RAAS.\nIn conclusion, eplerenone, a selective MR blocker,\ninhibits the acceleration of atherosclerosis associated with\nAngII /aldosterone activation in LSD-fed mice. Our study\nsuggests a key role for MR in mediating the pro-athero-\ngenic effects of a LSD through regulation of macrophage\ninflammation, cholesterol accumulation and oxidation.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
