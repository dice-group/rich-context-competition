Advertising increased\nthe likelihood of youth initiating smoking, price in-\ncreased the likelihood of smoking at most levels of up-\ntake, and availability of promotions increased the like-\nlihood that youth will move from experimentation to\nregular smoking.\nConclusions: Cigarette retail marketing practices in-\ncrease the likelihood of smoking uptake. These findings\nsuggest that specific restrictions on retail cigarette mar-\nketing may reduce youth smoking.\ntion with cigarettes and\nprogression to regular use\nremains a public health\nconcern. Research1 shows\nthat initiating smoking at a younger age\nis associated with eventually smoking more\ncigarettes per day than initiating smok-\ning at an older age, suggesting that delay-\ning the onset of smoking may affect the\nlikelihood of becoming addicted to ciga-\nrettes or becoming a heavy smoker. It is\nalso estimated that adolescents who started\nsmoke for at least 16 years if male and 20\nyears if female.2 Thus, smoking will be a\nlong-term addiction for many current ado-\nlescent smokers. Furthermore, youth who\ninitiate smoking at an early age are at an\nincreased risk for developing long-term\nhealth consequences.3 Because increas-\ning levels of smoking experience in-\ncrease the likelihood of future smoking,3\nmany researchers4-7 have begun to use\nstages of smoking experience to predict the\ntransition to future established smoking.\nInanattempttodeterminewhatiscaus-\ningadolescentstoprogresstowardregular\nsmoking,severalstudieshavelinkedtobacco\nindustrymarketingpracticestoadolescent\nsusceptibilitytosmoke8-10 andprogression\ntoward established smoking.11-19 Existing\nevidenceshowsthatinitiationofdailysmok-\ningamongyouthseemstoincreaseduring\nperiodsofhighpromotionalactivitybythe\ntobaccoindustry.16 Furthermore,asimilar\nstudy13 examiningsmokinginitiationtrends\nwithtrendsincigarettepricingandtobacco\nmarketing expenditures, shows that al-\nthoughcigarettepricesincreasedduringthe\nstudy'stimeperiod,sodidtobaccomarket-\ningexpendituresforcoupons,value-added\nitems, and promotional allowances.

To our knowledge, this is the first study\nto examine the differential effects of these retail market-\ning strategies on smoking uptake at the national level. The\nstrengths of this study are that most of the data were col-\nlected after the implementation of the MSA provisions,\nallowing for an examination of the post-MSA retail ciga-\nrette environment; and its ability to simultaneously ex-\namine the impact that objectively collected measures of\nthe cigarette retail environment have on youth smoking\nuptake.\nMETHODS\nCross-sectional data were collected from February 1999 through\ntheir second year of the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey,\nfunded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The MTF sur-\nvey uses a multistage sampling design to obtain nationally rep-\nresentative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students, with\nboundaries were defined as the area from which each MTF school\ndrew at least 80% of its student population. Community data\ncollection activities, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation as part of the Bridging the Gap Initiative: Research In-\nforming Practice and Policy for Healthy Youth Behavior, oc-\ncurred in approximately 200 MTF communities each year\nThe uptake measure, which is described in detail elsewhere,6\nhas been validated to show that current smoking status and in-\ntentionstosmokearereliablepredictorsoffuturesmoking.Briefly,\nthis measure includes stages that identify the process by which\nadolescents begin smoking. Three MTF questions were used to\ncreate the uptake measure: (1) ever smoking, (2) smoking in the\npast 30 days, and (3) intention to smoke in the next 5 years. The\nuptake measure included the following categories: (1) never\nsmoker, (2) puffer, (3) nonrecent experimenter, (4) former es-\ntablished smoker, (5) recent experimenter, and (6) current es-\ntablished smoker. A puffer was defined as someone who has\nsmoked once or twice. A nonrecent experimenter was defined as a\nstudent who smoked occasionally, but not in the past 30 days. A\nformer established smoker was defined as a student who smoked\nregularly in the past (not the past 30 days). A recent experimenter\nwas defined as someone who smoked occasionally, but not regu-\nlarly, in the past 30 days. A current established smoker was de-\nfined as someone who smoked regularly at the time of the sur-\nvey, or smoked regularly in the past and smoked in the past 30\ndays. Because some of the MTF questions used to create this mea-\nsure are asked of a subset of students, this study is limited to this\nsubsample of respondents.\nObservational data collection occurred annually in retail stores\nin the communities around the approximately 200 schools par-\nticipatingintheirsecondyearofMTFsurveys.Communitybound-\naries were defined as the area from which each school drew most\nof its student population. Using the census TIGER (Topologi-\ncally Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system;\na Web mapping application, sponsored by the US Census Bu-\nreau, for the United States) files, maps of each community were\ncreated and a list of potential tobacco retailers located within each\ncommunity was generated based on retailer-reported standard in-\ndustry classification codes. Screener calls were conducted by tele-\nphone to identify which of these stores sold tobacco products. If\nthe total number of outlets selling tobacco in a community was\n30 or fewer, all outlets were observed; this was the case in 82.0%\nof communities. If more than 30 outlets sold tobacco products, a\nrandom sample of 30 stores was selected, along with a random\nsample of replacement stores (for use if a store on the primary\nlist was closed, was determined to be unsafe, could not be lo-\ncated, or did not sell tobacco or alcohol). If the list of retail stores\nwas fewer than 30 in a given community, field staff were in-\nstructed to add any additional stores selling tobacco products that\nthey identified in the field. Field staff also added the store near-\nest the index school if it was not included in the sample. There\n9.9) stores per community.\nObservations were conducted in each retail outlet using\ntrained field staff teams composed of a lead and an assistant\nobserver. The 2-person teams served as a reliability check for\neach site observation. If there was disagreement on any mea-\nsure, field staff would return to the store to verify the measure\nprior to leaving the community. The purpose of the retail ob-\nservations was to unobtrusively collect information on to-\nbacco product placement, the extent of related advertising and\npromotions, and tobacco prices. Advertising included parking\nlot, other exterior (eg, store window), and interior advertis-\ning, while promotions included special price offers, on-pack\ncoupons, and retail value-added promotions (eg, buy 1 get 1\nfree or gift with purchase). Observers collected these data dur-\ning an approximately 10-minute visit to each selected store. Field\nstaff were instructed to alternate collecting information on posted\nnominal prices (including excise taxes, but excluding sales tax)\nand price-based promotional offers for Marlboro (Philip Mor-\nris USA, Richmond, Va) and Newport (Lorilland Tobacco Com-\npany, Greensboro, NC) cigarettes from store to store to yield\napproximately equal numbers of stores for each brand. If a store\ndid not sell one of the brands, then the other was substituted.\nMarlboro and Newport were selected because they are the brands\nmost widely used by teenagers, accounting for approximately\n78% of the usual brand smoked.23 Information was also col-\nlected on low-height advertisements (105 cm from the ground)\nand functional objects (branded objects that have some use,\nsuch as clocks, trash cans, and grocery baskets).\nTwo of the cigarette marketing variables are defined as the\nproportion of stores in each community that had a given type\nof marketing. For example, the promotions variable reflects the\nproportion of stores in the community that offered some type\nof promotion for Marlboro or Newport. Similarly, the place-\nment variable reflects the proportion of the stores with clerk\nassist\u00adonly cigarette placement.\nFor advertising, a scale (Cronbach =0.70) was constructed,\nwhich equals the sum of 5 separate variables representing the\nproportion of stores in a site having any (1) property, (2) exte-\nrior, (3) interior, (4) functional object, or (5) low-height adver-\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted by testing alterna-\ntive constructs, including a measure representing the proportion\nof stores in a site having increasing levels of advertising. Results\nwere consistent across measures. Therefore, we present the most\nstraightforward advertising construct.\nThe measure of price is the average price of premium-\nbrand cigarettes (Marlboro and Newport) across all stores in a\ncommunity. To account for changes in the relative price of ciga-\nrettes over time, our price measure is deflated by the national\nConsumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Sta-\ntistics (2003). Methods for the youth surveys and the commu-\nnity data collection were reviewed and approved by an appro-\npriate institutional review board.\nKey state tobacco control policies were controlled for in the\nmodels. These include an index reflecting the comprehensive-\nness and extent of state restrictions on smoking, adjusted for\npreemption; an index of state policies banning minors' pur-\nchase, use, or possession of tobacco products; and an index of\nstate policies restricting youth access to tobacco products. The\nsmoke-free air index is the sum of restrictions on smoking in\n9 different indoor locations, with each taking a value between\n0 and 5 depending on the extent of the restriction, with points\nsubtracted if there is statewide preemption of stronger local poli-\ncies. The purchase, use, or possession index includes 3 di-\nchotomous variables (1 indicates law present; and 0, no law),\nrepresenting the count of state policies prohibiting minors'\npossession, use, and purchase, respectively. The youth access\nindex was constructed using the rating system developed by\nAlciati et al,24 and includes information on 9 dimensions of youth\naccess\u00adrelated policies rated from 0 to 5 depending on the strin-\ngency of relevant provisions. The state-level tobacco-related poli-\ncies were obtained from a tobacco database (ImpacTeen; avail-\nable at: http://www.impacteen.org).\nIn addition, several variables were used to control for youth\nand community factors likely to affect smoking behavior, in-\ncluding grade (8, 10, and 12), sex, race/ethnicity (black or Afri-\ncan American, white or Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and other),\nlives with both parents, student income from a job or other\nsources, indicators of parental educational level (some college\nor more), year of data collection, and urbanization of the com-\nmunity. Urbanization level was obtained from the National Cen-\nter for Education Statistics for each school. Other data are taken\nfrom the MTF surveys. Cases with missing data on any vari-\nable were eliminated from analyses.\nANALYSIS\nAnalyses were run using computer software (Stata, version 9.2;\nStataCorp, College Station, Tex). Generalized ordered logit mod-\nels were run using gologit25 procedures in the software (Stata),\nrequesting Wald tests to determine if the coefficients between\nthresholds were significantly different for the gologit models and\nusing the lincom statement for requested contrasts. We used a\ngeneralized ordered logit model to capture the differential ef-\nfects of cigarette marketing on our varying thresholds of smok-\ning uptake. A standard ordered logit model, also called a propor-\ntionaloddsmodel,assumestheeffectoftheindependentvariables\nis the same for all categories of the dependent variable. The gen-\neralized ordered logit model relaxes the proportional odds as-\nsumption and allows the effects of the explanatory variables to\nhave varying effects on different levels of smoking uptake. We\ndefined 6 levels of smoking uptake; thus, there are 5 thresholds\nto separate these stages. The complex sample design was ac-\ncounted for by using sampling weights to adjust for differential\nselection probabilities, and adjusting for clustering by site--\ndefined as school enrollment zone--to compute robust stan-\ndard errors. All analyses controlled for student grade, sex, race/\nethnicity, whether the student lives with both parents, student's\nincome from work and other sources, father's and mother's level\nof education (college or more), urbanization, state-level tobacco\ncontrol policies, and year of data collection.\nRESULTS\n(Table 1).

Thresholds 1 through 5 refer to the 6 different levels\nof smoking uptake reported in Table 2. For example,\nthreshold 1 refers to a movement from \"never smoker\"\nto \"puffer,\" and so on. Results for threshold 1 showed\nthat an increase in moving up a level on the advertising\nscale (the proportion of stores in a community having\nan additional type of advertising) will increase the odds\nof an adolescent moving from the nonsmoking to the ini-\ntiation (puffer) stage of uptake by a factor of 1.08, or a\nrelative increase of 8%. We did test for interaction ef-\nfects between grade and advertising (results not shown).\nResults showed a significant interaction effect for 8th grad-\ners and advertising. All other results remained un-\nchanged. Beginning at threshold 2, advertising was no\nlonger significant; price had a strong significant nega-\ntive effect on smoking uptake. In fact, results suggest that\nfor every dollar increase in price, the odds that an ado-\nlescent will move on to the next level of smoking de-\ncrease by 24%. The magnitude of the effect of higher ciga-\nrette prices on smoking uptake varies slightly by threshold;\nbut overall, this finding was consistent across the re-\nmaining thresholds (3-5). Beginning at threshold 3, the\npresence of promotions had a positive significant effect\non moving youth along the smoking uptake con-\ntinuum. Results of thresholds 4 and 5 also showed that\nthe proportion of stores having any promotions signifi-\ncantly increased the odds of youth moving to higher lev-\nels of smoking uptake.\nThe results of the pairwise Wald tests showed signifi-\ncant differences in moving from threshold 1 to 2 for price\n(P =.03), while the effects of price are equal across the\nremaining stages of uptake. For promotions, we found\nsignificant differences in moving from threshold 3 to 5\nand from threshold 4 to 5 (P =.05 for both).\nTo better assess the magnitude of the association be-\ntween cigarette marketing and youth smoking uptake,\nwe conducted a series of simulations to produce esti-\nmates of how cigarette marketing influences the differ-\nent thresholds of smoking uptake for varying levels of\navailability for advertising and promotions. Specifically,\nthe predicted probabilities were calculated for the model\nestimated in Table 3 by separately setting the advertis-\ning and promotion variables to their minimum and maxi-\nmum values found in the sample, holding all other in-\ndependent variables at their mean. Simulations were\nperformed using the prvalue option in the computer soft-\nware used (Stata, version 9.2) to assess the impact of these\nvarious changes in marketing measures on youth smok-\ning uptake.\nWe used the estimates from our model to predict\nchanges in uptake if stores went from having approxi-\nmately 21/2 different types of advertising to having no ad-\nvertising or if stores had all 5 types of advertising. If stores\nhad no advertising, there would be a relative 11.25% de-\ncline in puffers, while increasing the types of advertis-\ning in stores to include the 5 captured in our scale would\nFor promotions, we examined changes in smoking up-\ntake if they went from being available in just less than\nhalf of stores to being available in either all stores (100%)\nor no stores. If all stores had some type of promotions,\ncurrent established smokers would experience a rela-\ntive increase of 16.58%. On the other hand, completely\neliminating promotions would result in a 13.39% rela-\ntive decline in current established smokers.\nCOMMENT\nThe results of this study show cigarette marketing strat-\negies have differential effects on the progression from ini-\ntiation and experimentation with cigarettes to regular\nsmoking.

This pervasiveness of adver-\ntising may influence youth initiation of smoking by cre-\nating the belief that smoking is a normative behavior.3\nAs previously mentioned, we also tested for interactions\nbetween grade and advertising, which did not substan-\ntively alter our results or the implications of this study.\nResults did show that 8th graders are more influenced\nby advertising than 10th and 12th graders. This rein-\nforces our overall finding that advertising impacts the early\nstages of smoking, which is where we would expect to\nfind the younger students.\nOur findings are consistent with previous litera-\ning and promotions and encouraging adolescents to ini-\ntiate smoking. There is also evidence that point-of-sale\nadvertising influences youths' intentions to smoke in the\nship between receptivity to tobacco \"advertising\" and pro-\ngressing to established smoking. We did not find any evi-\ndence of point-of-sale advertising influencing current\nmeasures that captured youths' receptivity to cigarette\nadvertisements and tobacco promotional items (ie, a\nT-shirt or a hat). This study disentangled these market-\ning strategies to look at point-of-sale advertising and pro-\nmotions separately. Thus, although our results show ad-\nvertising has no influence on established smokers, our\nfindings are consistent with previous studies given that\nour results show promotions are important in the later\nstages of uptake.\nFurthermore, these findings support previous re-\nsearch30,31 that shows price-based promotional offers are\nparticularly appealing to young price-sensitive smok-\ners. Thus, the beneficial effects of higher cigarette prices\nare undermined when youth are able to take advantage\nof cigarette promotions. In addition, our results suggest\nhigher cigarette prices are associated with discouraging\nyouth from progressing to established smoking at most\nlevels of smoking uptake. Price was only insignificant at\nthreshold 1, possibly because youth who first initiate to-\nbacco use are more likely to obtain cigarettes from a source\nother than a store.32 This finding is particularly signifi-\ncant because the latest Federal Trade Commission Ciga-\nrette Report21 shows a substantial increase in price dis-\nto retailers in 2003 to reduce the price of cigarettes to\nconsumers. Beginning in 2002, there was a definite shift\naway from retail value-added promotions toward price\ndiscounts,21 which would be reflected in the recorded ciga-\nrette price rather than through the presence of a promo-\ntional offer. This shift toward price discounts is re-\nflected in the data used for this study, which can be seen\nin Table 4. After steady increases, there was no change\ncrease in the presence of promotions occurred in the cat-\negory of cents off/special advertised price.\nThere are some limitations in our marketing data: (1)\nthe lack of information on the content of the point-of-sale\nadvertising, (2) the promotions variable does not capture\nthe full extent of promotions that may have been available\nin the stores during data collection, and (3) our price mea-\nsure is an average of prices collected across stores in the\ncommunity and is unweighted because we have no infor-\nmation regarding each store's share of cigarette sales. Yet,\nthese measures are still more local and, for promotions and\nprice, more specific to the brands youth smoke than any-\nthing that has been used in previous studies.\nSince the implementation of the MSA, the cigarette in-\ndustry has shifted its marketing efforts away from more\ntraditional media, such as print advertising, toward re-\ntail marketing efforts.20 Our findings provide evidence\nthat the retail environment is associated with youth smok-\ning uptake. Therefore, although the MSA restricted the\ncigarette industry's advertising and promotional activi-\nties, and the industry itself has restricted its advertising\nin magazines, the increase in cigarette retail marketing\nis, at least partly, offsetting any benefits of other MSA-\nrelated marketing reductions.\nThese results are of particular significance because, to\nour knowledge, no previous study has examined the dif-\nferential impact of objectively collected measures of ciga-\nrette marketing strategies on smoking uptake. Overall, our\nresults provide evidence that restricting point-of-sale ad-\nvertising will discourage youth from trying smoking, and\npolicies that increase cigarette prices and/or restrict price-\nTable 4.
