Such processing enables\nwhat is commonly called colour perception (e.g. Hurvich & Jameson, 1957). As will be made\nclear in this review, the ability to detect, process, and act in response to colour information\nmay be a direct consequence of evolutionary pressure (e.g. Mollon & Jordan, 1988). It is\nargued that such ability has evolved to a greater or lesser extent indifferent species and is\ndetermined by the functional anatomy and epigenetic development of their visual systems. At\nleast 40 different types of visual system exist in the animal world. The simplest is found in\naplysiae (e.g., Goelet, Castellucci, Schacher, & Kandel, 1986), a species that has been\nextensively studied by Eric R. Kandel and his team and only seems able to differentiate\nlight from dark. The visual brains of higher order species are able to discriminate not only\nlight intensities but also shape and colour. An enormous diversity in animal retinal structures\nand visual neuronal mechanisms is found, with a corresponding diversity in the functional\nrole of species specific colour vision, perception, and behaviour (e.g., Land, Horwood, Lim,\nthat separate evolutionary processes have acted on the different species. We will first start out\nwith a brief overview of how anatomically and functionally different visual systems have\nenabled colour vision in different species.\nA living organism possessing a single retinal pigment would most likely see the world in\nmonochrome, as we do at night when only our rod photoreceptors are active. In addition to\nrods, most species have cones, the photoreceptors that provide colour perception during\nthe day. We can define the input to these photoreceptors in physical terms as the overall\nlevel of light provided by the sun or moon (Osorio & Vorobyev, 2005) between about\n360 nm and 700 nm and colour as the distribution of wavelengths within this range (e.g.,\nMcLeod & Boynton, 1979). The number of retinal pigments in many animal species is not,\nthree (V. C. Smith & Pokorny, 1977). Of vertebrate species studied so far, the most developed\nability to discriminate stimuli on the basis of their colour is found in birds (S. Andersson &\nAmundsen, 1997). Birds vary according to species in their capacity to discriminate colour.\nDiurnal birds tend to have increased ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, either UVA or UVB (S.\nand have more cones, while nocturnal species have a much higher proportion of rods (Ruggeri\net al., 2010). UV wavelength sensitivity improves the temporal resolution of the avian visual\nsystem by enabling the detection of rapid flicker movements (Rubene, Hastad, Tauson, Wall,\n& Odeen, 2010), which may be critically important to ensure their behavioural adjustment\nwhen they fly, or have to catch prey. Microspectrophotometry has been employed to test the\nspectral sensitivity properties of animal retinas (Bowmaker, Dartnall, & Mollon, 1980). With\nthis technique and through behavioural studies, it has been deduced that four cone classes\nexist in approximately 30 species of birds. Some even have five types of photoreceptors: four\nsingle cone classes and, for about half of all cones, a double cone class with two different\nphotopigments (Bowmaker, Heath, Wilkie, & Hunt, 1997). In addition, the spectral\nsensitivities of certain cones are narrowed by a coloured oil droplet filtering light signals\n(Bowmaker et al., 1997; Partridge, 1989), with the double cone class having a different oil\ndroplet filter and broader spectral tuning (Bowmaker et al., 1997). By sequencing the part of\nthe gene coding for avian retinal opsins, Odeen and Hastad (2003) have shown that the\nevolution of avian colour vision is more complex than had previously been thought. Their\ndata support the theory that sensitivity biases toward violet (short wavelengths) has evolved\nindependently at least four times, which may explain why some species such as the chicken\n(Osorio, Miklosi, & Gonda, 1999) process colour inputs with at least three opponent\nmechanisms: one comparing the outputs of UV- and short-wavelength-sensitive receptors,\none comparing the outputs of medium- and long-wavelength receptors, and a third\ncomparing outputs of short- and long- or medium-wavelength receptors. Diurnal birds tend\nto be tetrachromatic rather than trichromatic and are able to detect chromatic variations in\nskylight that are invisible to us (as we are insensitive to UV) and provide information about\nupdrafts or other atmospheric conditions that are critical to their survival. Another advantage\nis related to sexual selection, as colour discrimination is enhanced by seeing UV reflections\nfrom the wings of potential mates in many birds (e.g., Boulcott, Walton, & Braithwaite, 2005;\nE. J. Smith et al., 2002), and in particular starlings and zebra finches (Bennett, Cuthill,\nRetinas with four classes of cones involved in colour discrimination (tetrachromatic\nvision) have also been reported in fish. Most of the latter have photoreceptors with peak\nsensitivities in the UV range; 95% of all known fish species seem to discriminate red, yellow\nor green or blue, violet, and UV up to 365 nm. However, since sea water selectively absorbs\nlonger wavelengths, that is, red light, many fish living below 10 m detect poorly in the red\nregion. Nevertheless, many reef fish species living at this depth emit red fluorescence, the\norigin of which are guanine crystals, and seem able to detect this colour. Fluorescence is\nwidespread in marine organisms and was recently also discovered in some terrestrial\nchameleon species, which have evolved fluorescing bony tubercles protruding from their\nskull. The fluorescence becomes visible in males only, shining through their scales under\n\u00a8 tzel et al., 2018). The fluorescent signal is likely to play a role in\nsexual selection by helping to attract females.\nPoralla and Neumeyer (2006) showed in behavioural experiments that there is no abrupt\ntransition between green and red but that there is yellow in-between. Kelber, Vorobyev, and\nOsorio (2003) more recently have discussed how photoreceptor signals are combined and\ncompared to allow for the discrimination of biologically relevant stimuli. Five retinal\npigments have been found in butterflies and many more in sea organisms such as the mantis\nshrimp and the sea manta, a giant ray (Cronin, Caldwell, & Marshall, 2001). While the human\neye cannot detect all of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the sun and UV being in any\ncase absorbed by the human lens and cornea, lobsters, shrimp, goldfish, trout, bees, and lizards\nseem to be able to detect light in the UV region (e.g., Brink, van der Berg, & Botha, 2002; Cronin\net al., 2001; Fleishman, Loew, & Leal, 1993). Comparative psychophysics have shown that the\ngoldfish displays the phenomenon of colour constancy, previously found only in primates and\navian species.\nResearch data from genetics suggest that the variations in colour vision across species may\nresult from the fact that the capacity to detect colour has evolved more than once, with gene\nduplication for visual opsin pigments (Bowmaker, 1998). In addition, probably because of\ntheir nocturnal behaviour, certain mammals have rod-dominated retinas (see e.g., Ruggeri\net al., 2010) and many selectively lack cones with the red-sensitive pigment and, therefore,\ndisplay only dichromatic colour vision. The dichromate cat is incapable of discriminating red,\nwith cones only sensitive to blue or indigo and to yellow or green, as found in the ferret\n(Calderone & Jacobs, 2003). Horses also have only dichromatic vision detecting long\nwavelengths and the colours based on them (Carroll, Murphy, Neitz, Ver Hoeve, & Neitz,\n2001). A different system has evolved in rats and mice which have excellent night vision, due\nto a higher number of rods than cones but see poorly in colour although both are\ndichromatic. Both rat and mouse cones coexpress two photopigments, one sensitive to\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 3\nwavelengths around 510 nm and another sensitive to UV, and their visual systems exploit\nthese differences to enable them to discriminate certain colours (Jacobs, Fenwick, &\nrodents and rodents which live in almost lightless conditions have been found to have\nsimilar colour vision (Jacobs, Calderone, Fenwick, Krogh, & Williams, 2003; Williams,\nCalderone, & Jacobs, 2005). Genetic data have also confirmed the long-held suspicion that\ncolour vision in primates including humans, apes, and Old World monkeys is better\ndeveloped than in other mammals (Jacobs, 1993). Despite data lacking on many species,\nprimates are largely considered to be trichromatic, although variations exist (Jacobs, 1993,\n1996; Jacobs & Deegan, 1999). Variations amongst New World monkeys are even greater,\nsome species being trichromatic while others are only dichromatic (Jacobs & Williams, 2006).\nIn addition, evidence predicts that all male New World monkeys are dichromatic while,\ndepending on their opsin gene arrays, individual females can be either dichromatic or\nnocturnal species appear to be monochromatic (Jacobs, 1996). The situation for aquatic\nmammals is quite different as many species, and in particular mammals that live in deep\nwater, are monochromatic and tend to have blue shifted vision compared with that of many\nterrestrial mammals (Fasick, Cronin, Hunt, & Robinson, 1998). This is considered to result\nfrom the absence of evolutionary pressure to maintain colour in a dark monochromatic\noceanic environment (Newman & Robinson, 2005). On the other hand, behavioural data\non the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops Truncatus), which loves to stick their head out of the\nwater and seems to enjoy daylight, suggest some colour vision based on rods and a single\nclass of cones (Griebel & Schmid, 2002).\nAccording to Darwin (1871), the choice of a sexual partner represents an important step\ntoward the most successful propagation of a given species by a sexual process. Partner choice\nin animals for sexual selection is therefore a major factor in the survival of the species (M.\nAndersson, 1994; Houde, 2001). The choice of a sexual partner in the animal kingdom is\ndetermined in one of three distinct ways. In polygamous animals, the male usually eliminates\npotential rivals by chasing them away aggressively. After elimination of competitors, the\nfemale, and often a harem of females, is left with one alpha male as sexual partner by\ndefault. In addition to leaving little freedom of choice to the female of the species, the\nsuccessful aggressive displays can be viewed by the female as a reflection of the most\nsuccessful genes (Darwin, 1871). Alternatively, a male seduces a potential female by\nparading his colourful attributes as ornaments, which correspond to his secondary sexual\ncharacteristics. Such nuptial behaviour frequently leads to exaggerated display of the\nornaments, which include shimmering of peacock feathers or lifting the bright blue\nwebbed feet of the blue-footed boobies of the Galapagos archipelago, well known for\nhaving inspired Darwin's theory of evolution during his studies there in 1835. The female\nthus has a selective choice, based on her estimation of the best genes, which may be\nconsidered to reflect how impressive her potential partner's ornaments are in terms of size\nand colour intensity (Price, 2006), signalling the physical condition and immune competence\nof the male. This process is frequently employed in monogamous animals and in particular in\nmonogamous birds. The female preference to mate with males with exaggerated external\nornaments may have arisen from evolutionary pressure (Cornwallis & Uller, 2010;\nQvarnstrom, Brommer, & Gustafsson, 2006), when a female preference for some aspect of\nmale morphology provoked selection for males with the appropriate ornament, a possibility\ngenerally known as the sexy son hypothesis (Weatherhead & Robertson, 1979). Plasticity\n(Danielson-Francois, Kelly, & Greenfield, 2006) in sexual mate choice behaviour has been\nobserved in birds during the course of the breeding season, which is accompanied by a\nreduced variation in the size and brilliance (brightness) of colourful ornaments. Later in the\nseason, the choice based on male ornaments is replaced by a choice based on genetic\ncomplementation (Badyaev, Hill, Dunn, & Glen, 2001). Although most studies have\nfocused exclusively on the role of female mate preferences in maintaining or promoting\ncolour variation, a recent study (Pryke & Griffith, 2007) highlights that both female and\nmale components of mate choice should be taken into account. Females showed a strong\npreference for mates with the most elaborate sexually dimorphic traits, while males were\nparticularly choosy, associating and pairing only with females of their own morph-type.\nSometimes, even in highly coloured male and female fish (Sko\nrather than the females make the choice of a sexual partner (Houde & Endler, 1990),\nwhich suggests that female ornamentation male also be sexually selected (Amundsen &\nIn vertebrates such as birds, the success of sexual selection is critically determined by both\nthe successful production of colour traits (G. E. Hill & McGraw, 2006) and by their\nsuccessful visual detection and perceptual processing (Cuthill et al., 1999). Successful\nreproductive sex in animals constitutes a process of combining and mixing genetic traits,\noften resulting in the specialization of organisms and to form offspring that inherit traits from\nboth parents (M. Andersson, 1994). Genetic traits, contained within the DNA of\nchromosomes, are passed on from one parent to another in this process. Because of their\nmotility, animals often engage in coercive sex. In a large number of essentially monogamous\nspecies, which include humans, the selection of a sexual partner is most often mutual. In\nspecies which are not monogamous, such as lions for example, male domination is often\ndeterminant. Since certain inherited characteristics may be linked to specifically sex-\nassociated chromosomes, physical differences are frequently observed between the different\nsexes of an organism. These have been particularly well studied in birds, where major\ndifferences in feather colours of males and females may be observed (Brush & Seyfried,\nhas shown that these differences play a significant role in mate determination, with males\nfrequently displaying these attributes with the aim of attracting a female partner (G. E. Hill &\nMcGraw, 2006, for review). Ornamental colours are critical secondary traits in this context,\nas secondary sexual traits are classically considered to be derived by sexual selection for traits\nwhich give an individual an advantage over rivals in courtship or aggressive interactions (M.\nAndersson, 1994; Darwin, 1871). The evolution of secondary sexual traits is not a recent\nphenomenon in evolution (Tomkins, LeBas, Witton, Martill, & Humphries, 2010) but harks\nback to Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, the earliest examples of sexual dimorphism known in\nthe animal kingdom.\nBoth pigment-based colourations and UV reflectance, which is structural colour and not\nperceptible by humans, play an important role in communicating critical information to\npotential mates. The biological significance of structural colour was first investigated\nmainly in birds (for reviews, see Auber, 1957; Dyck, 1976). More recent reports have\nemphasized the potential biological role of pigment-based colour, structural colour\n(Vukusic & Sambles, 2003) including UV reflectance, and fluorescence in avian\ncommunication (S. Andersson & Amundsen, 1997; Hunt, Cuthill, Bennett, Church, &\n\u00a8 rnborg, Andersson, Griffiths, & Sheldon, 2002; Siitari, Honhavaara,\nHuhta, & Viitala, 2002; for recent reviews, see G. E. Hill & McGraw, 2006). There is\nagreement that multilayer reflectors (Ghiradella, 1994; Ghiradella, Aneshansley, Eisner,\nSilberglied, & Hinton, 1972) at the origin of structural colourations in butterflies (Ve\n\u00b4 rtesy\net al., 2006) are found in other species (Parker, 2000). They were present early in evolution\nand have even been found in beetle fossils, for example (Parker, 1998; Parker & McKenzie,\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 5\n2003). Coherent scattering is the optical mechanism that explains colour production in all\nstructurally coloured butterfly scales (Prum, Quinn, & Torres, 2006). Male individuals of\nvarious avian species exhibit conspicuous colours on their feathers evolved by sexual selection\ndriven by mating preferences (M. Andersson, 1994; Darwin, 1871; Solis, Aviles, de la Cruz,\nValencia, & Sorci, 2008), such as the males of the cooperative breeding azure-winged magpies\n(Cyanopica cyanus), where only a fraction access the breeding status. These birds display\nconspicuous blue plumage colourations, and all males that become breeders have a more\nbrilliant and more saturated blue colouration, with a more intense violet hue compared with\nthe nonbreeders (Solis et al., 2008). The additional capacity of avian ornaments to reflect UV\nplays an important role during sexual displays (S. Andersson & Amundsen, 1997; Bennett\nExperimental alterations of the UV component in plumage have been shown to\nsignificantly affect sexual signals in many bird species (S. Andersson & Amundsen 1997;\nKing Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) display highly coloured ornaments, notably\nyellow or orange breast and auricular feathers and the two orange or pink UV reflecting\nbeak horns (Dresp, Jouventin, & Langley, 2005; Dresp & Langley, 2006; Dresp-Langley &\nLangley, 2010) on each side of the beak. These colourations have been suggested to signal the\nhealth status and immunocompetence of individuals, seem to be detected by individuals of\nboth sexes (Nolan, Dobson, Dresp, & Jouventin, 2006), and are therefore likely to ensure the\nsuccessful mating of the fittest individuals. During courtship, King Penguins flaunt their beak\nornaments by raising their heads high in the air when calling out for a potential partner.\nThe iridescence of their beaks is reminiscent of the shimmering iridescence of peacock\nfeathers, which may explain why the King Penguin is also quite often perceived as a rather\nsexy beast by our own species (Carmichael, 2007). The fact that the beak horn also displays\nan orange-to-pink colour tone increases the signal function, as more than a single type of\nphotoreceptor in the observing individual would be activated. The perception of this colour\nsignal may also be enhanced by a contrast effect, since the tissue surrounding the beak horn is\ndeep black. In addition, the multiplicity of microstructures with slightly different orientations\nproducing the UV reflectance, which was found to obey Braggs law (Bragg & Bragg, 1915;\nDresp & Langley, 2006) spreads both the wavelength and also the angle over which it is\nreflected, thereby producing a more easily perceptible signal. Such UV reflecting ornaments\nare absent in sexually immature individuals (Massaro, Lloyd, & Darby, 2003). Apart from\nthe function of visually attracting potential mates, ornamental colours communicate\ninformation about the general fitness of individuals, in particular whether an individual is\nwell nourished and healthy, providing additional criteria particularly for males in attracting\nfemale partners. In addition to pure survival, mate selection, breeding performance,\nfecundity, and growth, colour traits appear to be associated in various ways with\nimmunity (Blount, Metcalfe, Birkhead, & Surai, 2003; Hamilton & Zuk, 1982; G. E. Hill,\nSvensson, Raberg, Koch, & Hasselquist, 1998).\nAnother important step in ensuring the survival of a species is foraging (Dall & Johnstone,\n2002). After mating and reproductive sex, it becomes necessary to find food sources to ensure\nthe survival of the offspring, and learning to discriminate between the colours of fruits and\nfoliage acquires is a critical function to successful foraging behaviour, especially in birds.\nForage success is determined by whether a food source is recognized at the right time by\nindividuals of a species or not. Under conditions of abundance, this does not represent a\nproblem, but in natural environments, food sources are often scarce or irregularly\ndistributed, and their availability varies over time. Thus, the foragers need to identify\nprofitable food sources and to retain information relative to their spatial location (Lehrer,\n1994) to be able to return to them for meeting nutritional requirements. One and the same\nfood source rarely produces the sought after nutrient all year long, and foraging in a dynamic\nenvironment therefore requires a balance between exploitation of known resources and the\nexploratory sampling of new resources (e.g., Dall & Johnstone, 2002; A. T. Hurly, 1996), two\ntypes of foraging behaviours referred to as win-stay and win-shift strategies (Sulikowski &\nBurke, 2011). Associating a visual cue such as colour with a given food reward increases the\nrate of discovery of further food sources and thereby helps individuals of a species cope with\nthe spatial heterogeneity of food resource distribution in a natural environment (Edwards,\nNewman, Parsons, & Krebs, 1996). Examples of increased foraging efficiency brought about\nby visual cues such as colour in a variety of species, including vertebrates (Durier & Rivault,\nanimals learn to identify food sources on the basis of such cues. Colour is one of these,\nand combinations of cues include other visual, olfactory, auditory, tactile, and gustatory ones\n(Arenas & Farina, 2012; Croney, Adams, Washington, & Stricklin, 2003; Goyret & Raguso,\nWeatherhead, 1997). The use of colour cues for successful foraging may be particularly\nimportant under conditions of temporal and spatial variation in food availability.\nPollinators forage on irregularly distributed plants and flowers, and fruit or nectar\navailability varies over time depending on flowering times. The availability as well as the\nquality of a given food reward varies between flowers on the same plant, depending on the\nage of the flowers, the time of day, and other environmental conditions (Corbet, Unwin, &\nPrys-Jones, 1979). To locate and remember high-quality food sources, birds often use colour\ncues to direct and to optimize their foraging (Gill & Wolf, 1977). Bird-pollinated flowers\n(Castellanos, Wilson, & Thomson, 2002) are precious food sources for bees. They commonly\ndisplay bright yellow or red colourations (Rodri\u00b4guez-Girone\nis evidence that angiosperm flowers have evolved chromatic cues that suit the colour\ndiscrimination abilities of their pollinators, most likely to reinforce visits by the most\nefficient of them (Shrestha, Dyer, Boyd-Gerny, Wong, & Burd, 2013).\nMany animals can form associations between colour and reward (Kelber et al., 2003;\nof free-living rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) have shown that these birds retain\ninformation relative to high-quality food sources on the basis of learnt colour cues (Healy &\nThey predominantly use spatial information when returning to repeatedly sampled flowers\n(T. A. Hurly & Healy, 1996; Marshall, Hurly, & Healy, 2012) and rely on learnt colour cues\nfor foraging in unfamiliar places and the exploratory sampling of new flowers. Goldsmith\nand Goldsmith (1979) found that hummingbirds could learn to associate colour with nectar\nreward within less than 20 visits to the food source. They learn rapidly to associate colour\nwith the presence or absence of reward (Goldsmith & Goldsmith, 1979; T. A. Hurly & Healy,\n\u00b4 ndez-Ackerman, Campbell, & Waser, 1997), or to associate colour with either\nfood volume or concentration (Bacon, Hurly, & Healy, 2010; Bateson, Healy, & Hurly,\n2003). Colour cues also enhance their ability to return to target flowers in the presence of\ndistracting flowers (T. A. Hurly & Healy, 1996). Coexisting species of hummingbirds were\nfound to forage on the basis of learnt colour cues, selecting almost exclusively high-quality\nfood sources and ignoring poor-quality ones (Sandlin, 2000). Other avian species learn to\ncombine spatial cues and colour to detect and recognize rewarding flowers or feeders as, for\nexample, rainbow lorikeets (Sulikowski & Burke, 2011). Although the nomadic lifestyle of\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 7\nsunbirds does not facilitate studying their perceptual abilities in the wild, a recent study in\nseminatural enclosures (Whitfield, Ko\n\u00a8 hler, & Nicolson, 2014) has shown colour-learning and\ncolour-cue-use abilities in the captive amethyst sunbird (C. amethystina). Following training\nto colour cues, amethyst sunbirds more effectively selected high-quality food sources at the\nfirst attempt and throughout the feeding period, thereby decreasing the total time spent on\nfeeding and the number of visits to the food source while increasing the rate of energy gain\nper meal. These findings are in agreement with earlier studies on foraging behaviour of\nsunbird species in natural environments (Gill & Wolf, 1977). A higher number of visits to\nabundant food sources in the presence of colour would lead to suggest that the colour cues\nfacilitate the return of sunbirds to rich food sources (Scoble & Clarke, 2006) in the natural\nenvironment. Sunbirds forage over large distances, on plant species with characteristically red\nor orange flowers (S. D. Johnson & Nicolson, 2008) with variable nectar concentrations. The\nbirds rapidly adjust their feeding patterns to maintain an energy balance (Ko\n\u00a8 hler, Verburgt,\nFleming, & Nicolson, 2008). Sunbirds foraging without colour cues are likely to sample more\nfrequently from a larger number of poor feeders compared with birds that have learnt to use\ncolour cues. As a consequence, the latter return to the food source less frequently and display\nshorter times spent there (Whitfield et al., 2014).\nIt takes a giant leap up the phylogenetic scale, from the avian species to the human primate,\nto unravel the functional role of colour in the behavioural success of our own species. In\nhumans, the colour quality of hair and skin may to a given extent contribute to whether a first\ndate between individuals will be successful or not. Similarly, the colour of a meat, fruit, or\nvegetable displayed in a supermarket may influence humans when choosing from several\navailable options, and recent research data have revealed that goods with fully saturated\ncolours are instantly perceived as larger in size than poorly saturated equivalents (Hagtvedt\n& Brasel, 2017). However, the functional significance of colour for man (Dresp-Langley &\nLangley, 2010; Pinna & Reeves, 2013) has shifted toward other, more sophisticated aspects of\na far more complex process of visual communication. Pinna and Reeves suggest that, in\naddition to the discrimination of light and surface chromaticity, the visual purpose of color\nin humans is threefold to interrelate each chromatic component of an object, thus favoring the\nemergence of the whole, to support a part\u00adwhole organization in which components\nreciprocally enhance each other by amodal completion, and, paradoxically, to reveal\nfragments and hide the whole, as in camouflage--in sum, there is a chromatic parceling-out\nprocess of separation, division, and fragmentation of the whole in order to best specify the\nimportant figure-ground relations in the scene. The evidence they provide is psychophysical,\nprincipally based on illusions such as the watercolor effect, and it remains to be seen to what\nextent these different facets of colour perception can be verified in animals. Although these\naspects may seem remote from what we call evolutionary pressure they are, based on what has\nbeen discussed earlier, likely grounded in evolution. In fact, colour plays a critical role in the\ncultural development of human society, and well before the effects of the colour of objects on\nour perception were investigated more or less systematically by the French philosopher Michel\nEuge\n` ne Chevreul (1839), artists had already begun to use colour selectively and effectively to\ncreate novel visual sensations in order to refine their techniques and promote the success of\ntheir work. In modern art and design, colour not only plays a critical role in generating moods\nand emotions but also communicates information relative to what is supposed to be seen as\nfigure and what as ground in complex planar creations. Finally, colour provides visual cues to\nobject qualities that have the power to directly guide human decision-making and action, as\nwill be illustrated here on the example of image-guided surgical planning and intervention.\nThe Renaissance painters had preferentially resorted to chiaroscuro and geometric cues to\naerial perspective, using a very limited chromatic range, to create landscape depth and figure-\nground effects in their works. In the 19th century, at the dawn of abstract expressionism,\npainters such as Turner, especially in his later work, effectively used a larger variety\nof colours in combination with aerial perspective to suggest what should be seen as nearer\nand what as further away to the observer in a painting. He also most successfully combined\nchromatic brightness and saturation to express and balance figure and ground, and to\nvisually communicate specific moods, and other qualia. Later in the evolution of the visual\narts and design, architects and designers like Vasare\n\u00b4 ly most effectively manipulated colour\nbrightness and saturation in combination with planar shape geometry, playing with\nforeground and background effects to generate powerful and complex three-dimensional\n(3D) shape effects in highly abstract configurations which he baptized with strange names.\nHis work as a visual artist is probably among the most relevant for perceptual science,\nillustrating how colour, luminance, saturation, and shape can be combined with local\nvariations in two-dimensional (2D) geometry to elicit powerful visual effects and\nsensations of 3D structure in the plane. For some time, chromatic and achromatic\npathways in the visual brain were considered independent by the visual neurosciences,\nmostly on the basis of partial evidence from functional neuronal anatomy (e.g., Page &\nCrognale, 2005). Yet, Leonardo da Vinci in his Trattato della Pittura (1651), and\nsubsequently also Chevreul (1839), had already discussed contrast and colour\ncombinations as powerful cues to pictorial depth and how contextual variations may\ninfluence such perceptions. More recently, visual science has confirmed that contrast,\ncolour, and shape effects, together or independently, can determine what will be seen as\nnearer or further away in planar image configurations (Dresp & Fischer, 2001; Dresp-\nunder which surrounding light, contrasts, shadows, and nearby objects can determine how\nwe perceive the given colour as a function of the context (Devinck, Delahunt, Hardy,\nartists probably would readily agree that, in addition to planar geometry, colour can be a\npowerful and potentially self-sufficient medium for creating structural effects. Science has\nonly just begun to unravel some of functional contribution of colour to the wider\ndevelopment of human cultural activities as well as modern technology, as in the health-\ncare domain, where colour is exploited by imaging techniques as a powerful tool for guiding,\nand thereby promoting the success of complex human interventions.\nThe use of colour cues has become an important strategy in recent advances in visual\ninterface technology for image-guided surgical planning and intervention. Image-guided\nsurgery uses images taken before or during the procedure to help the surgeon navigate.\nThe goal is to augment the surgeon's capacity for decision-making and action during the\nprocedure (see Dresp-Langley, 2015; Perrin et al., 2009 for reviews). Colour is strategically\nadded to images at various stages of the process. In this kind of augmented reality by colour,\nguidance is provided directly on the surgeon's view of the patient by mixing real and virtual\nproperties of human tissue and organs. The perceptual quality of the colour tone, brightness,\nor saturation in the rendered image is essential for making specific regions of interest to the\nsurgeon optimally perceptible. This includes the visual traceability of devices relative to the\npatient, the registration, and alignment of the preoperative model and optimized rendering\nand visualization of preoperative data. Visualization by colour in this context means\ntranslating image data into a graphic representation that is understandable by the user\n(the surgeon) and to convey important information for assessing structure and function. In\nother words, colour is exploited in this context to ``make the invisible visible,'' and for helping\nmake critical decisions as swift and as safe as possible during interventions. Although the\nfield has evolved dramatically in recent years, the most critical problem is still the one of task-\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 9\ncentred user interface design, where the timing of the generation of image data is critical,\nand to facilitate navigation through large cavities with multiple potential obstacles, such as\nwithin the human abdomen or the brain. Complex displays designed to provide navigational\naids benefit from additional colour cues to visual field depth and tool-alignment.\nInterventional navigation techniques use surface renderings of anatomy from preoperative\nimaging with intraoperative visualization techniques, where colour is a highly effective tool\nfor making the invisible visible to the human operator or surgeon. A common strategy here is\nrepresenting volumetric data as 2D surfaces in colours of varying opacity. The efficiency of\nrenderings in facilitating human perception-based decisions can be evaluated in terms of the\nperceptual salience of the surfaces that represent the most critical regions of interest for\neffective and safe human intervention. Intraoperative imaging often provides further\ndiagnostic information and permits assessing risks as well as perspectives of repair.\nImage-guided instrument tracking is a major challenge for image-guided surgery\ntechnology (West & Maurer, 2004). In image-guided interventions, the critical problem for\nthe surgeon is eye-hand coordination, which involves keeping track of the relative positions\nof the surgical tool(s) and of the direction of the tool-movements (e.g., Jiang, Zheng, &\nAtkins, 2014). The effectiveness of visual displays for tracking tooltips in simulator\ntraining is an important factor to skill evolution in trainees (Batmaz, de Mathelin, &\nstudy image conditions likely to facilitate simulator training for optimally precise and swift\nmanual gestures with a tool of novice surgeon, we have included the strategic use of a colour\ncue to test whether it would help novice surgeons to become more precise more rapidly in a\ncomputer-controlled simulator task guides by a surgical fisheye camera image.\nMaterial and Methods\nThe experiments were run on a computer-controlled perception-action platform\n(EXCALIBUR) for image-based analysis of data relative to the time (in milliseconds) and\nprecision (in pixels) of manual operations with a tool in a pick-and-place task. Hard and\nsoftware components of the simulator platform are described in detail elsewhere (Batmaz\nEthics\nThe study was conducted in conformity with the Helsinki Declaration relative to scientific\nexperiments on human individuals with the full approval of the ethics board of the\ncorresponding author's host institution (CNRS). All participants were volunteers and had\nprovided written informed consent.\nSubjects\nSix surgeons with minimal experience in image-guided interventions, ranging in age between\n25 and 35 years, participated in this study. They were all right handed.\nObjects Displayed on the 2D Monitor\nVideo input received from an HD USB fisheye camera was processed by a DELL Precision\nmemory (RAM) capacity at 16 bits and an NVidia GForce GTX980 graphics card.\nExperiments were programmed in Python 2.7 using the Open CV computer vision software\nlibrary. The computer was connected to a high-resolution color monitor (EIZO LCD Color\nan inbuilt color calibration device (colorimeter) using the Color Navigator 5.4.5 interface for\nWindows. The video input received by the computer from the HD USB fisheye camera\ngenerated the raw image data. These were adjusted to a viewing frame of 640 pixels\n(width) \u00c2 480 pixels (height) and processed to generate 2D visual displays (Figure 1) in a\nviewing frame of 1280 pixels (width) \u00c2 960 pixels (height), the size of a single pixel on the\nscreen being 0.32 mm. Real-world data and visual display data were scaled psychophysically\nto ensure that the visual display subjectively matched the scale of the real-world action field\n(RAF) of the simulator as seen in front of the observer as closely as possible. The luminance\n(L) of the light grey (x \u00bc 3.03, y \u00bc 3.19, z \u00bc 3.47 in CIE color space) RAF visualized on the\ncolor space) target areas was 15.4 cd/m2, producing a target or background luminance\ncontrast (Weber contrast: ((Lforeground\n\u00c0Lbackground\n)/Lbackground\nof the blue (x \u00bc 0.15, y \u00bc 0.05, z \u00bc 0.80 in CIE color space) object surface on the screen\nwas 3.44 cd/m2, when shown in colour and when shown in its achromatic version on the\nscreen. This gave Weber contrasts of \u00c00.90 with regard to the RAF and \u00c00.78 with regard to\nthe target areas in both achromatic and colour viewing modes. The luminance (29.9 cd/m2) of\nthe green (x \u00bc 0.20, y \u00bc 0.70, z \u00bc 0.10 in CIE color space) tool-tips produced Weber contrasts\nof \u00c00.11 with regard to the RAF and 0.94 with regard to the target areas. All luminance\nvalues for calculating the object contrasts visualized on the screen were obtained on the basis\nof standard photometry using an external photometer (Cambridge Research Instruments)\nand interface software. The luminance of the different objects (object top surface, tool-tips,\nthe square-shaped target areas, and the grey action field) displayed on the screen was\nphotometrically identical in the two display conditions (Figure 1), yielding identical local\n(Michelson) contrasts in both viewing modes. All subjects stated to perceive the contrast\nintensities as equivalent in the two displays (Figure 1). The pick-and-place simulator task\nhere requires placing the square-shaped 3D object on the centre of each of the different dark\ngrey 2D target squares. Optimal precision in this task involves, as pointed out earlier (Dresp-\nFigure 1. Screen snapshots of the two viewing conditions for image-guided task execution (five step pick-\nand-place simulator task controlled by a HD fisheye micro camera equivalent to a surgical camera and\nconnected to a computer with optimal processing capacity) with local colour cueing (left) and without (right).\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 11\nLangley, 2015), segregating the blue or grey square top of the 3D object from the grey 2D\nsquares defining the target areas. Psychophysical figure-ground experiments (Guibal &\nDresp, 2004) have shown that achromatic patterns with identical Michelson contrasts\nproduce the same perceptual figure-ground response probabilities, however, when local\ncolour cues were added, stronger figure-ground responses were found. Therefore, we are\nled to assume that any difference in placing precision from the two different display\nconditions here can confidently be explained by the presence or absence of the local colour\ncue in the image.\nExperimental Procedure\nThe experiments were run under conditions of free viewing, with illumination levels that can\nbe assimilated to daylight conditions. The RAF was illuminated by two lamps (40 Watt,\n6500 K) which were constantly lit during the whole duration of an experiment. Participants\nwere comfortably seated at a distance of approximately 150 cm away from the screen, looking\nstraight-ahead at the image. Seats were adjusted individually in height at the beginning of a\nsession to ensure that the image displayed on the monitor was slightly higher than the\nindividual's eyes when looking straight at the screen, which is a near-optimal viewing\nposition for laparoscopic simulator training. All participants were given a printout of the\ntargets-on-RAF configuration with white straight lines indicating the ideal object trajectory,\nand the ordered (red numbers) target positions the small blue cube object had to be placed on\nin a given trial set of the pick-and-place task, always starting from zero, then going to one, to\ntwo, to three, to four, to five, and back to position zero. Participants were informed that they\nwould have to position the cube with the tool, a forceps-type instrument, held in their\ndominant hand ``as precisely as possible on the center of each target area of the RAF, as\nswiftly as possible, and in the right order, as indicated on the printout.'' Before starting the\nfirst trial set, the participant could look at the printout of the RAF with the ideal trajectory\nsteps in the right order for as long as he or she wanted. When an individual felt confident to\nbe able do the task, the experiment was started. Each participant was given a blank warm-up\ntrial set, and then trained in 10 repeated trial sets in each of the two viewing conditions (with\ncolour cue and achromatic). The order of conditions was counterbalanced within individual\nsessions and between subjects in two separate successive sessions. Each time the small object\nwas placed on a target area, the computer software processing the video data (see Batmaz\nnumber of pixels separating the object from the ideal on-target-centre location. At the end of\na trial set, the cumulated number of off-target pixels from the five successive task steps (place\nmanoeuvers) and the total time of task completion in milliseconds were written to a labelled\nexcel file.\nResults and Discussion\nResults were analysed in terms of the means M and their standard errors SEM for dependent\nvariables relative to time in seconds and precision in pixels for with two levels (achromatic vs.\nwith colour cue) of the display factor D2\n, 10 levels of the trial rank factor T10,\nand six subjects.\nWe therefore have a balanced Cartesian experimental design S6\nyielding a total of\n120 data (observations) for time and precision.\nFor the dependent variable relative to time, the data analysis returned a shorter average\ntime for the achromatic image condition (M \u00bc 15.6 s, SEM \u00bc 1.5) compared with the image\ncondition with local colour cue (M \u00bc 16.9, SEM \u00bc 1.4). Two-way repeated measures analysis\nof variance signals that the difference in means for time (d \u00bc 1.3) between the two levels of the\ndisplay factor is statistically significant, F(1, 5) \u00bc 8.423; p<.05. Average times decrease\nsystematically as the rank number of the trials in a session increases. Means for time as a\nfunction of the rank number of trial sets are shown in Figure 2 (top) for each of the two\nFigure 2. Average data relative to task execution times (top) in seconds and task precision (bottom) in\nterms of the number of pixels recorded off-target-centre for successive place steps of the pick-and-place task.\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 13\nstatistically significant. The condition of equality of variance of the distributions for time was\nsatisfied.\nFor the dependent variable relative to precision, the data analysis returned a higher\naverage off-target score, indicating lesser precision, for the achromatic image (M \u00bc 1,682,\nSEM \u00bc 64) condition compared with the image condition with the local colour cue\n(M \u00bc 1,396, SEM \u00bc 59), which produced greater precision. Two-way repeated measures\nanalysis of variance signals that the difference in means for precision (d \u00bc 286) between the\ntwo levels of the display factor is statistically significant, F(1, 5) \u00bc 22.60; p<.01. As the rank\nnumber of the trials in a session increases, average precision increases significantly,\nF(9, 45) \u00bc 3.500; p<.01, as testified by the decreasing off-target scores, depending on the\ndisplay condition shown in Figure 2 (bottom). Average off-target scores get smaller as\nthe trial increases only in the image condition with the colour cue. The interaction\nbetween the trial rank factor and the display factor on the dependent variable for\nvariance of the distributions for precision was satisfied.\nBeyond considering the population statistics from analysis of variance, there is a\ncomplementary and quite revealing way of looking at the average data for time and\nprecision from this experiment. Trend analysis (linear regression analysis) on the average\ndata reveals the correlation coefficients R2 from a least-squares fitting process of the variance\nof the residuals to the variance of the one-sample dependent variable, representing 1 minus\nthe ratio of that variance. R2 gives an estimate of the fraction of variance in the average data\nthat is explained by the fitted trend line. The statistical significance of the trend is determined\nby the statistical probability that the linear trend is different from zero using the Student\ndistribution (t) with n\u00c02 degrees of freedom.\nHere (see Figure 2), it is shown that the achromatic image conditions produce horizontal\n(flat) regression lines indicating an absence of any linear trend indicative of a training effect.\nIn other words, the average performance scores for time and precision do not evolve in\ntraining sessions with 10 trial sets when guided by images without a colour cue. On the\nother hand, the image condition with the colour cue, on average, produces such training\neffects, for both time and precision. These effects are revealed by the significant linear trends\nfor this image condition, shown in Figure 2 (top and bottom, respectively). Under image\nguidance with the colour cue, average times and average off-target scores present a\nas the rank number of the trial set increases. In other words, subjects are, on average,\ngetting faster and more precise in 10 trial sets when guided by the image with the local\ncolour cue. The one-sample t statistic from the linear trend analysis gives the statistical\nprobability that the trend is real, that is, significantly different from zero.\nthe performance scores of complete novices and more experienced surgeons in simulator\ntasks as this one here depend on factors relative to individual speed-precision strategy and\non the capacity to select information relative to local detail in the visual display guiding the\nmotor performance. Others (e.g., Yantis & Jones, 1991) had found some time ago that colour\ncan act as a powerful priority tag in guiding attention for cognitive performance. The results\nfrom this study here show that a local colour cue in the image consistently promotes positive\ntraining effects on time and precision in a total of 10 trial sets, while an image without the\ncolour cue (achromatic viewing) fails to do so. We suggest that this can be explained in terms\nof a colour-facilitated figure-ground segregation in images of complex natural scenes with\nmore than two layers of subjective surface depth.\nThis interpretation is consistent with data from Dresp-Langley and Reeves (2012, 2014)\nwho found effects of relative brightness contrast and subject depth induced locally by\ncoloured patches in complex configurations (Figure 3) were significantly stronger in images\nwith more than two subjective surface depth levels in the plane when compared with\nFigure 3. Examples of configurations from Dresp-Langley and Reeves (2012, 2014). In images with more\nthan two subjective surface depth levels in the plane (top), as is the case in most natural scene images\nincluding surgical images, effects of relative brightness contrast and subject depth induced by the coloured\npatches were found to be significantly stronger compared with the same configurations with only two levels\nof surface depth in the plane, that is, only two alternatives for what is likely to be figure or ground.\nDresp-Langley and Reeves 15\nconfigurations with only two levels of surface depth in the plane, that is, only two alternatives\nfor figure and ground.\nConclusions\nEvolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only colour trait production in the\ndifferent species, but also their perceptual ability to see and process colour in terms of useful\ninformation for guiding action. This ability directly ensures the success of survival relevant\nactions directly related to mating (sexual selection) and feeding (foraging). Moreover, colour\nnot only helps sustain the survival of animal species, but also acts as a key factor in the\ncultural and technological development of our own species. In the contemporary imaging\nsciences, the strategic use of colour has become a powerful tool for guiding the planning and\nexecution of interventional procedures (medical precision technology). Here we have shown a\nfacilitating effect of a colour cue on training for task precision in a computer-controlled\nsimulator (pick-and-place) task. This effect can be explained in terms of a colour-cue-\nbased enhancement of figure-ground salience in images with more than two layers of\nsubjective surface depth such as natural surgical images. Colour thus plays an important\nrole in the cognitive development of man by facilitating his adaptation to new and\nchallenging visual worlds in the context of rapidly progressing technological development.\n"
