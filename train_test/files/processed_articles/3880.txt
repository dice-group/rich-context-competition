In this study, private cloud computing is the major research target. The chief information officers participated in a\nquestionnaire survey. The results indicate that the integration of trust into the information systems success model will have\nacceptable explanatory power to understand cloud computing success in the hospital. Moreover, information quality and\nsystem quality directly affect cloud computing satisfaction, whereas service quality indirectly affects the satisfaction through\ntrust. In other words, trust serves as the mediator between service quality and satisfaction.

However, a few years after the implemen-\ntation, the funding for national health insurance incurred a\nshortage; therefore, many policies have since been proposed\nto mitigate the funding gap, such as diagnosis-related groups.\nIn 2013, the second generation of the National Health\nInsurance Program was implemented with additional supple-\nmentary insurance fee to address the funding problem. For\nhospitals, under the various medical payment standards of\nnational health insurance, reducing operating costs became\nan important objective and a source of competitive advan-\ntage. To achieve this goal, information technology (IT) has\nbeen utilized as a critical weapon. Using the characteristics\nof information systems (IS), hospitals can provide good\nhealth care services at lower costs. These health care IS\ninclude picture archiving and communication systems\n(PACS), hospital information systems (HIS), and radiology\ninformation systems (RIS), among others.\nRecently, with the emergence of the cloud computing\nera,1,2 generating electronic medical records (EMRs) has\nbecome more feasible than traditional IT platforms.\nAccording to its applications, the deployment models of\ncloud computing can be divided into private cloud, public\ncloud, and hybrid cloud.3 Many hospital-based applications\ncan benefit from this novel platform. Over the past few\nyears, more and more hospitals in Taiwan have adopted\ncloud computing as their IT services platform.4 However,\nprevious studies were focused on critical factors that affect\nadopting decisions.1,5 In contrast, very few studies have\nbeen conducted to understand the success of cloud comput-\ning for hospitals. The work of Garrison et al6 emphasized\nthe critical role of 3 IT capabilities (managerial, technical,\nand relational) toward the success of cloud computing.\nHowever, they only focused on IT capabilities, other IS suc-\ncess related factors were not considered. Besides, their study\nhas not applied to the health care industry which has particu-\nlar characteristics than other industry.\nThis study, to address the insufficiency of related research,\nattempts to establish and verify a cloud computing success\nmodel for Taiwan hospitals. By integrating IS success\nmodel7,8 and trust, the hospital cloud computing success\nmodel has been established and validated using the question-\nnaire survey administered to hospital chief information offi-\ncers (CIOs). This study has 3 major contributions. First, it\naddresses the inadequacy of current research available in the\nliterature. Second, it can be referenced by hospitals that, in\nthe future, will adopt cloud computing. Finally, it can be uti-\nlized by hospital management for evaluating the success of\ntheir cloud-based e-health care systems.\n1National Taichung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nJiunn-Woei Lian, Department of Information Management, National\nTaichung University of Science and Technology, 129 Sec. 3, San-min Road,\nEmail: jwlian@nutc.edu.tw\nTheoretical Framework and Hypothesis\nThe major theoretical base of this study is the IS success\nmodel proposed by DeLone and McLean7 in 1992. Ten years\nlater, DeLone and McLean8 integrated various challenges\nand IS environment evolutions, and proposed an updated IS\nsuccess model and applied it in the context of e-commerce\nand electronic business environment.9 This model has been\nverified by previous IS researches.10 It has also been used to\nunderstand electronic health record (EHR) success in the\nhospital.11 Therefore, it is suitable for understanding the fea-\nsibility of cloud-based hospital IS. It indicates that informa-\ntion quality, systems quality, and service quality are 3 critical\nfactors that will positively affect user intention and satisfac-\ntion. In addition, user intention will affect user behavior and\nwill consequently affect user satisfaction. With better user\nsatisfaction, it will enhance use intention, thereby resulting\nin a loop. Finally, success of IS will result in net benefits and\nincrease the continued intention to use the IS.8 This cycle is\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nIn addition to the IS success model perspective, previous\nstudies indicate that cloud computing adoption is usually a\nkind of IS outsourcing.12 For hospitals, transitioning from\ntraditional IS platform to a cloud computing environment is\na large-scale transformation. Most hospitals will look to col-\nlaborate with professional third-party cloud service provid-\ners. Hospitals in Taiwan are no exception. Therefore,\nintegrating IS success and IS outsourcing perspectives will\nbe helpful to understand cloud computing success in\nhospitals.\nFrom the IS outsourcing viewpoint, previous studies indi-\ncate that the degree of trust between organizations and ser-\nvice providers is most critical for successful cooperation.13,14\nIn addition, the work of Petter et al15 also indicated that trust\nplays one of the critical factors that will affect IS success.\nTherefore, trust has been integrated into the proposed cloud\ncomputing success model and is validated in the context of\nthe private cloud computing in hospitals. In Figure 2, we can\nfind that the proposed model has 3 quality factors from the IS\nsuccess model7-9 and integrates the fourth factor, trust.15 The\ndependent variable is the satisfaction of cloud computing\nthat is derived from the IS success model.7-9 Therefore, 7\nhypotheses have been inferred:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Information quality of cloud comput-\ning will positively affect hospitals'trust toward the IS ser-\nvice providers.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): System quality of cloud computing\nwill positively affect hospitals' trust toward the IS service\nproviders.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Service quality of cloud computing\nservice provider will positively affect hospitals' trust.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Information quality of cloud comput-\ning will positively affect hospitals' satisfaction.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): System quality of cloud computing\nwill positively affect hospitals' satisfaction.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): Service quality of cloud computing\nservice provider will positively affect hospitals'\nsatisfaction.\nHypothesis 7 (H7): Hospitals' trust toward computing\nservice provider will positively affect their satisfaction.\nResearch Design\nMaterials and Methods\nA mail-based questionnaire survey was used in this study.\nMeasurements used in this survey were adapted from previ-\nous studies and were modified to suit the research context.\nWorking definitions and employed measurements of each\nvariable are summarized in Table 1. Because the original\nmeasurements are not designed for the cloud computing\ndevelopment in the hospital, following steps were followed\nto develop the questionnaire and confirm its reliability and\nvalidity. First, English and Chinese specialists translated\neach statement into Chinese and verified the equivalency of\nthe Chinese and English meanings. Next, to ensure content\nvalidity, 3 experts (2 from the field of information manage-\nment and 1 from the hospital managerial level) were asked to\nreview the questionnaire, and accordingly the content was\nmodified. Because the population is scarce in this study (the\npopulation in this study is only 502 hospitals in Taiwan),\nonly qualitative methods were used in the pilot test to\nFigure 1. Information systems success model.4\nFigure 2. Research model.\nconfirm the validity and reliability. Finally, 48 items were\nused to measure the variables in the research model.\nThe respondents were the CIOs of the hospitals. Data col-\n502 hospitals in Taiwan. Subsequently, the study received\ncloud computing whereas 51 respondents (23.8%) indicated\nthat they had not used cloud computing. Moreover, among\nadopted private cloud computing, 49 (30.1%) utilized public\ncloud, and 50 (30.7%) used hybrid cloud computing. Owing\nto the different characteristics and requirements of various\ncloud computing deployment types,3 this study focuses on\nprivate cloud computing success for 2 major reasons. First,\nseparate different cloud computing deployment models will\navoid any unnecessary ambiguities. This is because different\ndeployment models of cloud computing have different pur-\nposes and applications. Moreover, owing to security con-\ncerns, many hospitals have chosen to adopt private cloud as\ntheir first priority.4,19 This study also has similar findings;\ntherefore, focus on the technology utilized by the majority is\nmore critical.\nWe utilized 64 samples to validate the proposed research\nmodel. Partial least squares (PLS) was used as it is suitable\nfor samples larger than 10 times the number of independent\nvariables.20 This study has 4 independent variables; there-\nfore, the minimum required sample size is 40. This implies\nthat the selected sample size is sufficient for advanced analy-\nsis. SmartPLS21 and SPSS have been used for the following\ndata analysis.\nResults\nRespondents' Demographic Characteristics\nThe 64 respondents are predominantly male, with 53 males\nFifty-six (88%) participants had a college degree or higher.\nMost of them had rich experience in the health care informat-\nics field (47% had more than 10 years of experience in the\nhealth care industry). The respondents were mainly CIOs\nand leaders of informatics-related departments.\nAmong the 64 participating hospitals, there were 4 (6%)\n(69%) regional hospitals. This distribution is similar to the\npopulation, thereby making the data set representative.\nexperience with cloud computing. The 3 major applications\non the cloud platform are PharmaCloud System, EMR, and\nPACS. Finally, most of the respondents (87.5%) noted that\nthey collaborated with a third-party information service part-\nner for constructing their private cloud computing platform.\nMeasurement Validity and Reliability\nThe following criteria are utilized to evaluate the validity and\nreliability of the measurements used in this study: composite\nreliability (CR) > .7, average variance extracted (AVE) > 0.5,\nCronbach's alpha value > .7, and the square roots of AVE are\ngreater than the correlation coefficients to ensure discrimi-\nnant validity. From Table 2, we can see that all of the indexes\nTable 1.

CR = composite reliability; AVE = average variance extracted; NA = not applicable.\nare acceptable. Only 1 of the 9 items measuring information\nquality was omitted because of low factor loading (<0.5).22\nTherefore, 8 items were employed to measure service quality.\nOther measurements remained unchanged from the original\ninstruments.As regards discriminant validity, the square roots\nof AVE were computed and compared with the correlations\nbetween constructs.23 According to the above criteria, the\nresults indicated that the discriminant validity of each con-\nstruct is acceptable. On the basis of the above testing, we can\nensure that the data set can be used for advanced analysis.\nHypothesis Testing\nThe PLS results indicate that the critical determinants of hospi-\ntals' private cloud satisfaction are information quality (H4),\nsystem quality (H5), and trust (H7).The R2 is 65.4%. Moreover,\ntrust serves as the mediator between service quality and satis-\nfaction. It implies that service quality will directly affect trust\n(H3), whereas satisfaction will be affected indirectly. Overall, 4\nproposed hypotheses are significant, H3, H4, H5, and H7. The\nresults are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 3.\nDiscussion\nFrom the perspective of the IS success model, this study indi-\ncates that only information quality and system quality directly\naffect satisfaction. Service quality will directly affect hospi-\ntals' trust toward their partners (R2 = 27%) and the level of\ntrust will significantly affect their satisfaction. The overall\nexplanatory power of the sequential dependent variable,\ncloud computing satisfaction, is 65%. In other words, in the\ncontext of private cloud computing in hospitals, integrating\ntrust and IS success model can improve the understanding of\nthe success of cloud computing. In contract to traditional\nviewpoint, this study found that only information quality and\nsystem quality have a direct effect on satisfaction. The effect\nof service quality on satisfaction, however, is indirect. This is\nthe major theoretical contribution of this study. This finding\nalso confirms the opinion proposed by Paul.24 He indicates\nthat in the context of commercial cloud computing environ-\nment, service-level agreement and quality of service require-\nments of users determine the level of trust toward cloud\ncomputing.24 Present study advanced finds that trust will not\nonly affect users' satisfaction but also serve as the mediating\nrole between service quality and satisfaction . Finally, com-\npared with information quality and system quality, service\nquality is relatively intangible; therefore, it will not affect\nusers' satisfaction directly but indirectly. This phenomenon\nwill be meaningful for future studies about cloud computing.\nFor applicability in hospitals, cloud-based applications\nneed to provide reliable, timely, compactable, and clear\ninformation for users. Besides, it also needs to meet users'\ninformation requirements to ensure the quality of informa-\ntion. Regarding systems quality, cloud-based applications\nmust ensure ease of use from a user perspective, and in par-\nticular, for doctors. A friendly user interface will help users\ncomplete their tasks without the task being cumbersome to\nexecute. As regards the cloud service provider, this study\nfinds that only promoting service quality is insufficient to\nensure user satisfaction. Improved service quality is required\nto promote trust level simultaneously. Only this approach\ncan improve user satisfaction. This study suggests that cloud\nservice providers must express their transparency and not\nmake decisions catering to their own interests. Finding solu-\ntions that consider the interest of both parties is critical.\nOverall, this study has both practical and theoretical\nimplications. In practice, this study aggregated the status of\nprivate cloud computing development in Taiwan hospitals\nand determined the critical success factors. The results can\nbe referenced by the hospitals in Taiwan and other countries,\nespecially in the Asia-Pacific region. In terms of theoretical\ncontribution, this study extends the traditional IS success\nmodel to the issues facing the establishment of cloud com-\nputing environments in hospitals. In addition, we established\nand validated a cloud computing success model for hospitals\nin Taiwan. These results contribute to the research streams in\nthe IS success model, thereby enriching the research context\nof the IS success model.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThere are some limitations and future research directions\nproposed in this study. First, this study only focused on pri-\nvate cloud computing in hospitals. Based on the definition\nproposed by National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST), cloud computing has different service models and\ndeployment models. However, this study only focused on\nprivate cloud computing in hospitals. In addition, hospitals\nin Taiwan have their own characteristics. Therefore, future\nstudies can conduct more research across different cloud\ncomputing types and industries. Moreover, this study is a\ncross-sectional study, and cloud computing is still in its\nTable 3.

Therefore,\nlongitudinal research will be needed for this research area.\nSecond, to make more significant contributions to the lit-\nerature in this research area, future studies can apply the pro-\nposed model to different cloud computing platforms and\ncompare their differences and similarities. Besides, the data\nset only includes hospitals in Taiwan; therefore, we suggest\nthat data from different countries will enable researchers to\nmake more meaningful contributions. Third, only 4 indepen-\ndent variables are included in the proposed model, even\nthough the R2 value obtained is acceptable. We believe that\nmore critical variables can be included to understand the suc-\ncess of cloud computing in hospitals. Regarding the respon-\ndents, CIOs normally are responsible for IS development and\ncould be also end users. Surveying CIOs is one perspective\nfor system success and, however, should be different from\nsurveying normal users in the results. Therefore, findings\nfrom regular users other than CIOs may be different. Future\nstudy can conduct comparative research to get a better under-\nstanding of this topic. Finally, previous studies25,26 had argued\nthe potential problems of small sample size in PLS; however,\nthe population in this study is only 502 hospitals in Taiwan,\nand among the valid respondents only 64 adopted private\ncloud computing. This causes another limitation. Future study\ncan focus on end users to release this restriction.\nConclusions\nThis study integrates the characteristics of cloud computing\nby combining the IS success model and trust to investigate\nthe critical success factors that affect the success of private\ncloud computing in hospitals. Based on this cloud computing\nsuccess model, we conducted a questionnaire survey to vali-\ndate the proposed model and hypotheses. Overall, the\nexplanatory power (R2) of this model is 65.4%. In addition,\nthe results of the hypothesis testing indicate that, similar to\nprevious studies, information quality and system quality of\nprivate cloud computing in hospitals no double can have\npositive and direct effects on cloud computing users' satis-\nfaction. However, service quality indirectly affects users'sat-\nisfaction. Trust is the mediator between service quality and\nsatisfaction. In other words, maintaining a healthy partner-\nship between third-party information service providers and\nhospitals is critical when developing private cloud comput-\ning. Besides, this study also finds that adopting private cloud\ncomputing is a major trend among hospitals in Taiwan. The\n3 major applications on the cloud platform are PharmaCloud\nSystem, EMR, and PACS. Finally, this study found that\n87.5% of the respondents have collaborated with third-party\npartners for establishing a cloud computing environment in\ntheir hospitals. On the whole, this proposed cloud computing\nsuccess model will help hospitals evaluate success after\nadopting private cloud computing health care services and\nachieve its value creation purpose.27\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nFigure 3.
