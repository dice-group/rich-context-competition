Design Nationally\nrepresentative samples of US adolescents in their senior year of secondary school (age 18) were followed into middle\nadulthood. Structural equation models estimated the associations between age-18 characteristics and current drinking\nand heavy drinking at ages 22, 26 and 35 and symptoms of AUDs at age 35. Participants The sample consisted of\npredictor variables had stable associations with alcohol use over time, although their ability to explain variance in\nalcohol use declined with increasing time lags. Being white predicted alcohol use, but not symptoms of AUDs. Parental\ndrinking, risk taking and use of cigarettes and marijuana predicted heavy drinking to age 35. Planning to attend\ncollege predicted more heavy drinking at age 22 and less frequent heavy drinking by mid-life. High school theft and\nproperty damage predicted later AUD symptoms. Most associations were invariant across gender, with variations\ntypically taking the form of stronger associations between predictors and alcohol use for men. Invariance in findings\nacross cohorts indicates that results reflect general developmental trends rather than specific historically bounded ones.\nConclusions Many adolescent individual and contextual characteristics remain important predictors of adult alcohol\nuse and abuse, and their predictive impact varies as a function of age and type of alcohol outcome. These associations\nare largely equivalent across gender and cohort, thus reflecting robust developmental linkages.\n",

At the same time,\nmost adults who use alcohol do so without any short- or\nlong-term difficulties. In fact, moderate drinking, defined\nby the US Department of Health and Human Services and\nthe US Department of Agriculture [3] as no more than\none drink/day for women and no more than two drinks/\nday for men, can have health-promoting effects [4].These\nunique qualities of alcohol--namely, the effects of its use\nbeing devastating for some and neutral or even salutary\nfor others--underscore the importance of delineating the\nindividual characteristics and experiences that contri-\nbute to variation in the etiology and course of alcohol use\nand abuse across the life-span.\nIn particular, given that adolescence is when alcohol\nuse typically onsets and escalates, as well as the pivotal\nrole adolescence can play in adult health [5\u00ad7], an impor-\ntant set of questions pertain to how adolescent charac-\nteristics and experiences contribute to variation in adult\nalcohol use and abuse; due to the dearth of long-term\nprospective studies, these questions have received little\nattention. Of course, alcohol use and abuse during adult-\nhood are not static, so in addition to interindividual varia-\ntion there are important developmental variations, such\nthatalcoholuseandabusetendtopeakduringearlyadult-\nhood and then decline thereafter [8\u00ad13].Thus, not only is\nit important to examine the adolescent risk factors for\nadult alcohol use, it is also important to examine the\nextent to which the associations between such risk factors\nand alcohol outcome vary as a function of both age and\nthe type of alcohol outcome under investigation. Accord-\ningly, the purpose of the present study is to examine ado-\nlescent risk factors for early and middle adult alcohol use\nand abuse, within a US national multi-cohort panel study\nfollowing young people from age 18 to age 35.\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use and alcohol\nuse disorders\nAs measured typically, there is a distinction between\nalcohol use and heavy drinking; alcohol use refers to the\nfrequency and/or quantity of use, whereas heavy drink-\ning is a subcategory referring to excessive use in a rela-\ntively short amount of time (sometimes called `binge\ndrinking' and measured traditionally as having five or\nmore drinks in a row) [11,14]. Alcohol use disorders\n(AUDs), psychiatric disorders as defined by the DSM-IV\n[15], include alcohol abuse, a condition in which alcohol\nuse is disruptive to an individual's personal life or respon-\nsibilities, and alcohol dependency in which an individual\nbecomes physically tolerant to or dependent on alcohol.\nBecause alcohol use, heavy drinking and AUDs represent\nvarying levels of both normative alcohol involvement\nand disorder, they are likely to have different adolescent\npredictors; we include each as adult outcomes in the\npresent study.\nAdolescent risk factors for concurrent and future\nalcohol use and abuse are conceptualized to range from\ncharacteristics of the individual to facets of the individu-\nal's social context [16\u00ad18]. Given the purposes of this\nstudy, it was important to include a wide range of risk and\nprotective factors capturing numerous aspects of adoles-\ncents' lives including individual characteristics related\nto conventionality, education, peer involvement, risk-\ntaking, deviancy and well-being, along with salient social\ncontext and demographic characteristics. We focus in\nparticular on factors that are known to be related con-\ntemporaneously to alcohol use during adolescence so\nthat we can determine their staying power in predicting\nadult alcohol use and abuse.\nThe associations between individuals' social and\nfamily background and their alcohol use tend to be sub-\nstantial during adolescence. In the United States, white\nadolescents exhibit higher rates of alcohol consumption\nthan nearly all other racial/ethnic groups, particularly\nAfrican Americans [2], a finding that may relate to\nhigher religiosity among African Americans [19] and\nmay not be present much beyond adolescence [20]. Chil-\ndren of divorce tend to exhibit higher adolescent alcohol\nuse [21] and more symptoms of drug and alcohol abuse\n[22]; similarly, adolescents from single-parent homes are\nmore likely than those from two-parent homes to exhibit\nproblem substance use [23]. However, whether these\neffects of parental divorce and single parenthood extend\ninto adulthood is unclear. Having parents who abused\nalcohol is a well-established risk factor for AUDs especially\namong males [24\u00ad27]; this association is probably attrib-\nutable to a combination of genetic risk, modeling of\ndrinking behaviors and the effects of parental drinking\non the home environment.\nTies to broader social institutions can also be protec-\ntive against alcohol use, at least during adolescence [17].\nIt has been well documented that religiosity is an impor-\ntant protective factor [19], although it is unclear whether\nadolescent religiosity has any long-term predictive rela-\ntion to adult alcohol use and abuse. Adolescent educa-\ntional success and plans have been found to predict lower\ncollege attendance relates to heavier drinking and\nalcohol abuse during early adulthood and higher rates of\nalcohol use (but not disorders) into adulthood [31]. Dif-\nferential drinking patterns between young adults who\nattend college and those who do not are probably a result\nof early and heavier use among adolescents who do not\ngo on to college, and heavy use among those in college\ndue in part to the normative aspect of heavy drinking on\nMany risk-taking and externalizing behaviors that are\nuncommon among other age groups occur more fre-\nquently during adolescence. When they co-occur, these\nbehaviors have been viewed as components of a problem\nbehavior syndrome [33,34]. Some of these behaviors\nhave been found to be effective in predicting which indi-\nviduals will use or misuse alcohol into adulthood. For\nexample, externalizing behavior in adolescence [24] and\nadolescent deviant behaviors predict adult alcohol abuse\nMentalhealthandwell-beingalsorelatetoalcoholuse.\nAdolescent internalizing difficulties including depressive\naffect and anxiety relate to adolescent alcohol and other\ndrug use [37], and also predict adult alcohol dependence\n[36,38]. However, findings regarding the associations\nbetween alcohol use and mental health are mixed, with\nsome suggesting the potential for AUDs to cause mood\ndisorders [39] and others showing stronger associations\nbetween negative affect and problem drinking than\nbetween negative affect and more normative alcohol use\n[40]. The relationships between heavy alcohol use and\nmental health are likely to be complex. For example,\nresearch examining patterns of heavy drinking over time\nfinds less depressive affect among chronic heavy drinkers\nthan among infrequent heavy drinkers [41].\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 85\nAlcohol use is associated frequently with the use\nof other addictive and psychoactive substances. For\nexample, a body of evidence suggests that drinking\nalcohol and smoking cigarettes have a high rate of\nco-occurrence [42\u00ad44]. Cigarette smoking is the most\nstable of drug use behaviors in that it is usually initiated\nby the end of high school and, once established, desis-\ntance from smoking is less likely than desistance from use\nof other substances [9,29]. Because rates of desistance\nfrom smoking are low and cigarette use co-occurs with\nalcohol use, we would expect cigarette use at the end of\nhigh school to be useful in predicting later alcohol use.\nHigh school use of marijuana and other illicit drugs may\nalso relate to later drinking, either as a function of\ndeviance-proneness or proclivity to use psychoactive\nsubstances.\nVariation in prediction as a function of developmental\nperiod, gender and cohort\nBecause adolescence is a time when many consequential\nlife decisions are made, adolescent experiences should\nhave strong implications for adult functioning. However,\nadolescence is also a time when risky behaviors become\ntemporarily more normative than they are at other times\nin the life-span. For some adolescents, engaging in risky\nbehaviors may be temporally limited, while for others\nthese behaviors are part of long-term problems [45\u00ad47].\nDuring adolescence, those individuals for whom these\nbehaviors are developmentally limited and those for\nwhom they are indicative of life-long disorders may look\nsimilar. Therefore, the normative nature of risk-taking\nand externalizing behaviors in late adolescence could\nlimit their usefulness in predicting long-term drinking\noutcomes.\nSimilarly, because drinking behaviors follow a devel-\nopmental pattern, predictors are likely to vary as a func-\ntion of the age of assessment of adult alcohol use and\nabuse. Indeed, risk factors associated with drinking\nwithin one age group of adults may be unassociated with\ndrinking among another age group [48]. In the present\nstudy, we focus on three ages in adulthood: age 22\n(corresponding with the peak of binge drinking), age 26\n(an age by which the assumption of many adult roles has\noccurred for most) and age 35 (corresponding with\nbeginning of middle adulthood) [28]. We expect that the\nassociations between adolescent risk factors (particularly\nthose that become temporarily normative during adoles-\ncence) and alcohol outcomes will generally grow weaker\nacross the three ages. Some of the risk factors (e.g. racial/\nethnic group, parental education, single parent and\nparental drinking) are static, in that they do not change\nor at a minimum are well established by the end of high\nschool; accordingly, they may be more likely to maintain\ntheir predictive power across adulthood.\nDifferences in alcohol use patterns between men and\nwomen indicate the importance of examining gender dif-\nferences and interactions in alcohol research. Alcohol\nabuse and dependence occur more frequently in men\nthan in women and, on average, men consume more\nalcohol than women [1,2]. In addition to mean level dif-\nferences, normal developmental patterns include a slower\ndecrease in drinking during adulthood among men than\namong women [49]. Furthermore, the associations\nbetween risk factors and alcohol outcomes have been\nfound to vary as a function of gender, particularly for\nacademic achievement and deviant behaviors [50], and\npossibly for depressive symptoms as well [51]. Similarly,\nsome evidence suggests greater heritability for AUDs\namong males than among females [27].Thus, we include\na focus on gender differences and similarities in our pre-\ndictive models.\nHistorical period may contribute to differences in\nlevels of risk factors and outcomes and, perhaps more\ninterestingly, to relationships among risk factors and out-\ncomes [33,52]. Because the Monitoring the Future (MTF)\nschool graduates who were followed into adulthood, we\nhave the unique opportunity to test the generalizability of\nresults across 11 senior year cohorts in this paper, pro-\nviding some insight about the extent to which findings\nreflect developmental trends and/or historical trends\n(i.e. cohort-specific effects or period effects).\nThis paper extends current knowledge regarding the\nassociations between adolescent risk factors and later\nalcohol use and abuse by using US multi-cohort national\nlongitudinal data, by including multiple adolescent risk\nfactors from a variety of domains and by including up to\nfour adult alcohol outcomes at three different ages. The\ngoals of this paper are to determine: (i) the associations\nbetween adolescent risk and protective factors and later\nalcohol outcomes; and (ii) whether the associations\nbetween adolescent risk and protective factors and later\nalcohol outcomes vary with gender, age and type of\noutcome, and cohort.\nMETHODS\nRespondents\nRespondents are from the MTF national panel study [11].\nEach year, MTF surveys a nationally representative\nsample of about 17 000 American adolescents who are\nin their senior year of secondary school (modal age 18).\nApproximately 2400 respondents are selected randomly\nfrom each senior year cohort for follow-up into young\nadulthood and beyond. Follow-up mail surveys are con-\nducted on a biennial basis until age 30. After age 30, data\nare collected at 5-year intervals. For the purpose of this\n86 Alicia Merline et al.\nstudy, we selected respondents who had completed at\nleast the first follow-up (modal ages 19\u00ad20) and were old\nenough for potential inclusion in the age 35 survey (high\nprovided sufficient data (5263 did not respond to the first\nfollow-up survey and 113 failed to indicate their gender).\nBecause high school students who reported drug use\nwere oversampled for inclusion in the follow-up sample,\nanalyses used selection weights.\nEach respondent received one of five randomly distrib-\nuted forms during their senior year, and was sent the\nsame form for each follow-up. All forms contained infor-\nmation regarding respondents' alcohol use and many of\nthe predictors used in this paper. In addition, one of the\nforms contained several items relevant to the current\nstudy that were not duplicated on any other form. Previ-\nmation regarding the study's design, as does the study's\nMeasures\nAdult alcohol outcomes\nThirty-day and heavy alcohol use were measured at ages\nalcohol abuse and dependence were assessed only at age\n35. These measures are described below, and means and\nstandard deviations are presented in Table 1 by gender; as\nindicated, gender differences are significant for all mea-\nsures at each age, with men having higher use and\nsymptom counts than women.\nThirty-day alcohol use. Respondents were asked about the\nnumber of times they drank in the 30 days prior to each\nsurvey. Responses ranged from one (never) to seven\nHeavy drinking. Respondents were asked about the\nnumber of occasions on which they drank five or more\ndrinks in a row during the 2 weeks prior to each survey.\nResponses ranged from one (never) to six (10 or more\ntimes).\nAlcohol use disorders: symptoms of abuse and dependence.\nAUDs were measured through symptoms of both alcohol\nabuse and dependence. A nine-item symptom count indi-\ncating each respondent's number of symptoms of alcohol\nabuse in the 5 years prior to the age 35 survey was used\nto construct a count of abuse symptoms.The items in this\nsymptom count (e.g. `Has your use of alcohol in the last\n5 years hurt your relationship with your spouse?') are\nbased on DSM-IV criteria and are consistent with the\nmeasurement of alcohol abuse in other large-scale\nsurveys [55\u00ad57]. A five-item scale indicated the number\nof symptoms of alcohol dependence present in the\n5 years prior to the age 35 survey. Items included symp-\ntoms of both tolerance (e.g. `needed more to get the same\neffect') and physical dependence (e.g. `used alcohol to\navoid hangovers'). These items are based on the DSM-IV\ncriteria for alcohol dependence and are consistent with\nhow alcohol dependence has been measured in the\nNational Comorbidity Survey [58] and other large-scale\nTable 1 Mean levels of alcohol use by gender and age.\nRange\nt-Test of gender\ndifferences\nMean SD Mean SD\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 87\nAdolescent risk factors\nTable 2 provides information regarding the measures of\nadolescent risk factors. At the time of the senior year\nsurvey, respondents provided information regarding their\nrace/ethnicity, parental education and whether they lived\nin a single-parent home. At the time of the age 35 survey,\nrespondents were asked to recall their experience of\nparental drinking. In the senior year survey, respondents\nalso answered questions regarding their religious atten-\ndance, grades, college plans, truancy, evenings out, risk-\ntaking, aggression, theft/property damage, self-esteem\nand depressive affect. [To measure depressive affect we\nincluded items from the MTF survey reflecting self-\nderogation (feelings of worthlessness and guilt), which is\nan important aspect of depression (and consistent with\nitems on the Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\n(CES-D) [59]). Symptoms of depression range from\nsomatic disturbances to anhedonia, indicating that we\nare measuring just one aspect, albeit an important one, of\ndepression.] They also reported their cigarette use, mari-\njuana use and use of other illicit drugs.\nAttrition and missing data strategy\nAs mentioned above, respondents who completed the\nfirst follow-up survey after high school and were eligible\nfor the age 35 survey were included in the analyses\nregardless of their level of response to subsequent\nsurveys. In order to minimize bias associated with\nattrition after ages 19\u00ad20, we used full information\nmaximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, a missing data\nalgorithm available within MPlus [60]. [With regard to\nadolescents who attrited before the age 19\u00ad20 follow-\nup, previous attrition analyses conducted with other\nsamples from MTF (e.g. [61,62]) found that those who\nremained in the study were more likely to be female and\nwhite; to be higher on parental education, religious\nattendance, high school grades and college expectations;\nand to be lower on substance use. These analyses also\nfound that relations among variables were not affected\nby differential attrition.] Compared to simple case-wise\ndeletion and most other missing data procedures, FIML\nis superior for minimizing bias due to attrition [63\u00ad66].\nFIML is also appropriate to use to account for data\nmissing due to the planned missingness inherent in the\nmultiple form structure of MTF [63]. Although some of\nthe variables (including risk-taking, aggression, theft/\nproperty damage, self-esteem and depressive affect) were\non only one of the five questionnaire forms (thus distri-\nbuted to only a random 20% of respondents), FIML\nallows for the analyses of data from all respondents\nTable 2 Family and adolescent risk factors for adult drinking behavior.\nFamily background\nRace/ethnicity Dichotomous variable: 0 = African American, Hispanic or not white, 1 = white and non-Hispanic\nParental education Mean of mother's education and father's education (or one parent's education if only one is reported):\n1 = grade school or less, 6 = graduate or professional school after college\nSingle-parent home Number of parents in the home at age 18: 0 = two-parent home, 1 = single-parent home\nParental drinking At age 35, respondents were asked to recall how much of the time their parents `often drank heavily'\nwhen they were growing up: 1 = not at all, 4 = 6 or more years\nAdolescent risk factors\nReligious attendance How often respondents attended religious services: 1 = never, 4 = about once a week or more\nHigh school grades `Average grades so far in high school.' 1 = D or below: 9 = A\nCollege plans How likely it was that respondents would `graduate from college' after high school: 1 = definitely won't\nto 4 = definitely will\nTruancy Two items: `How many whole days of school have you missed because you skipped?' `How often have\nyou gone to school but skipped a class when you weren't supposed to?'\nEvenings out How often respondents went out at night unsupervised for `fun and recreation'\nRisk-taking Two items: `like to do risky things just to test myself', `I get a kick out of doing dangerous things';\nAggression Five items: hit supervisor, fight at work or school, participate in gang fights, hurt someone badly enough\nto need a doctor, threatened someone with a weapon; a = 0.65\nTheft/property\ndamage\nNine items: stole something worth under $50, stole something worth over $50, shoplift, steal a car, steal\npart of a car, trespassing, arson, damage school property, damage work property; a = 0.72\nSelf-esteem Four items: `I take a positive attitude toward myself', `I feel I am a person of worth', `I am able to do\nthings as well as most other people', `I am satisfied with myself' (1 = disagree to 5 = agree); a = 0.84\nDepressive affect Four items: `I feel I do not have much to be proud of', `Sometimes I think that I am no good at all',\n`I do the wrong thing', `My life is not useful' (1 = disagree to 5 = agree); a = 0.81\nCigarettes Cigarette smoking in last month (0 = none, 6 = more than 2 packs a day)\nMarijuana Marijuana use in past 12 months (0 = none, 7 = 40 times or more)\nOther drugs Use of illicit drugs other than marijuana in past 12 months (0 = none, 1 = one or more)\n88 Alicia Merline et al.\nAnalysis plan\nPreliminary analyses included zero-order correlations\nconducted separately for men and women between age\n18 individual and contextual variables and alcohol use at\nage 18 and at each follow-up. To examine our primary\nresearch questions, path analyses using adolescent risk\nfactors to predict each of the three domains of adult\nalcohol involvement (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy\ndrinking and symptoms of alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence) were conducted within Mplus [63]--see Fig. 1.\nThe associations between adolescent risk factors and\nadult involvement with alcohol were modeled in three\nseparate models, one for 30-day alcohol use, one for\nheavy drinking and one for symptoms of alcohol abuse\nand dependence (two separate outcomes, modeled in\nsame set of analyses). Within each of the three models,\nthe adolescent risk factors were entered simultaneously\nas predictors of the adult alcohol problem behavior of\nfocus; thus, the path coefficient for each risk factor repre-\nsents the unique effect of each risk factor after account-\ning for the effects of each other risk factor. Given the\nrelatively large sample sizes used, only results significant\nat the level of P < 0.01 are reported.\nIn order to determine: (i) if the strength of association\nbetween adolescent risk factors at age 18 and adult\nover time; and (ii) whether the associations between ado-\nlescent risk factors at age 18 and adult alcohol problems\nwe conducted a series of model comparisons. Because\nthese analyses involved models in which no variables\nwere latent (i.e. path models) the baseline model, for\nwhich all associations were free to vary across time and\ngender, had a c2 value of 0 as well as 0 degrees of\nfreedom. Comparing each constrained model to the base-\nline model via a standard c2 difference test remains\nappropriate in this situation [67].\nThe model comparisons assessing the extent of stabil-\nity across time and the impact of gender were conducted\nby estimating a series of multivariate models using stan-\ndard multiple-group analyses. In the baseline model,\nassociations between the adolescent risk factors and the\nadult alcohol outcome were free to vary across age of\noutcome and across gender. In the next multivariate\nmodel, the association between one adolescent risk factor\nand alcohol outcome was constrained to be equal across\nall ages and both genders. In models where these con-\nstraints had no significant effect on model fit the con-\nstraints were retained. If the c2 of the constrained model\nwas significantly different from the baseline model, then\ntwo additional models were estimated: one in which asso-\nciations were constrained across age of outcome but free\nto vary across gender, and one in which associations\nwere free to vary across age of outcome but constrained\nacross gender. If the constraints imposed in either of\nthese models had no significant effect on model fit then\nthe constraints were retained. If, for a given adolescent\nrisk factor, no constraints could be made without affect-\ning the fit significantly, then all associations involving\nthat adolescent risk factor remained free in the final\nmodel. Next, while still focusing upon the same adult\nalcohol outcome, we switched focus to a different adoles-\ncent risk factor and repeated the above series of model\ncomparisons. This pattern of analyses continued until all\nthe associations between the set of adolescent risk factors\nand the adult alcohol outcome of focus were examined.\nThis process was completed for each model: 30-day\nAge\nAge\nAge\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nAge\nAdult alcohol use and abuse1,2\nAge\nAge\nAge\nalcohol\nuse\nAdolescent risk factors\nFigure 1 General path model used to\nassess stability in associations across\ntime. 1Three separate models were con-\nducted for 30-day alcohol use, heavy\ndrinking and alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence. 2For alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence, data were available at age 35 only.\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 89\ndrinking, heavy drinking and symptoms of alcohol abuse\nand dependence.\nIn a final set of analyses, we examined whether the\npath coefficients in each model varied as a function of\ncohort.The 11 senior year cohorts used in this study were\ndrinking and symptoms of abuse and dependence), a\ncohort model was estimated in which the constraints\nfrom the final models were retained, but allowed to vary\nacross the three cohort groups. Then additional equality\nconstraints across cohort groups were added to all\nparameters.\nRESULTS\nPreliminary results: correlations\nTable 3 describes the correlations among the adolescent\nrisk and protective factors, with the correlations shown\nabove the diagonal for men and below the diagonal for\nwomen. As shown, the associations between the sub-\nstance use indicators were moderate to large. In addition,\nboth measures of age 18 alcohol use correlated moder-\nately with many of the adolescent risk factors. Further,\nthe intercorrelations among the adolescent risk factors\nranged from small to moderate. In particular, parental\neducation and high-school grades were associated posi-\ntively with college plans, while truancy was associated\nnegatively with college plans. In addition, truancy was\nassociated positively with evenings out, aggression and\ntheft/property damage, while evenings out was itself\nassociated positively with aggression and theft/property\ndamage. The intercorrelations between the problem\nbehaviors of risk taking, aggression and theft/property\ndamage were also moderate. Finally, the intercorrelation\nbetween self-esteem and depressive affect was both nega-\ntive and significant.\nCorrelations between the adolescent risk and protec-\ntive factors and alcohol outcomes are presented sepa-\nrately by gender and age of outcome in Tables 4 and 5. As\npresented in these tables, higher levels of alcohol use\nwere associated generally with being white, higher parent\neducation, higher parental drinking, lower religious\nattendance, higher truancy, frequency of evenings out\nfor fun and recreation, risk-taking, aggression, theft/\nproperty damage and high school use of cigarettes, mari-\njuana and other drugs. There are a few variables for\nwhich the associations with alcohol use varied across\ntime, outcome and gender. For example, parental educa-\ntion was associated with higher 30-day alcohol use for\nboth men and women across time, but its positive asso-\nciation with binge drinking for men decreased over time.\nAlthough depressive affect was not associated with heavy\ndrinking and was associated negatively with 30-day\ndrinking (for women at ages 26 and 35), respondents\nwith high depressive affect in high school reported more\nsymptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence at age 35.\nPath analyses\nModels predicting 30-day alcohol use\nThe model comparisons, as described above in the `Analy-\nsis plan' section, resulted in the selection of a 30-day\nalcohol use model [c2\nroot mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)\nand 35, respectively). As shown in Table 6, being white\nand having more educated parents predicted 30-day\ndrinking at each age (although the association decreased\nin magnitude across age) and the associations were the\nsame for men and women. Parental drinking, truancy,\nrisk-taking and low depressive affect significantly pre-\ndicted higher 30-day drinking and the strength of these\nassociations did not vary with age of outcome or gender.\nCollege plans predicted higher 30-day drinking, but the\nstrength of this association varied with both age and\ngender, increasing in strength over time for men. Eve-\nnings out during high school predicted 30-day alcohol\nuse for both men and women, but only at age 22. Age 18\n30-day alcohol use predicted later 30-day alcohol use,\nwith associations diminishing over time, but invariant\nacross gender. [To assess the impact of autoregressive\neffects on model coefficients, additional models excluding\nage 18 alcohol use were tested for each alcohol use\noutcome (i.e. 30-day alcohol use, heavy drinking and\nAUD symptoms). Generally speaking, the substantive\nfindings were similar to those presented in this paper.\nWhere there were differences, the effects of adolescent\nrisk factors on later alcohol use were generally larger\nwhen age 18 alcohol use was excluded. In particular, the\neffects of age 18 parental education, truancy and mari-\njuana use on later alcohol outcomes were more pro-\nnounced.] Marijuana use also predicted 30-day drinking,\nwith associations being stronger for men than for women\nat ages 22 and 26. Based on these multivariate models,\nseveral adolescent risk factors that were correlated sig-\nnificantly with 30-day drinking--including religious\nattendance, aggression, theft/property damage, cigarette\nuse and other illicit drug use--were not significant pre-\ndictors of 30-day drinking at any age; also living in a\nsingle-parent home, high school grades and self-esteem\nwere not significant predictors (or correlates) of 30-day\ndrinking at any age (and these non-significant associa-\ntions were able to be constrained equally across age of\noutcome and gender).\n90 Alicia Merline et al.\nTable 3 Correlations among predictors (men's correlations shown above the diagonal, women's under the diagonal).\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 91\nModels predicting heavy drinking\nAgain, a series of model comparisons resulted in the\nfinal model for heavy drinking (c2\nrespectively).\nAs shown in Table 7, being white and having more\neducated parents predicted heavy drinking significantly\nwere invariant across gender.

Higher high school grades predicted less heavy\ndrinking at all ages, with coefficients being invariant\nacross ages and gender. College plans in high school pre-\ndicted more heavy drinking at age 22 but less heavy\ndrinking at age 35 (coefficients invariant across gender).\nHigher frequency of evenings out, risk-taking and\nsmoking predicted higher levels of heavy drinking, with\neach of these associations being invariant across age of\noutcome and gender.

There are many reasons to expect connections\nTable 8 Standardized regression coefficients for alcohol abuse\nand dependence at age 35.\nPredictor Abuse Dependence\n*P < 0.01, **P < 0.001; where two coefficients appear, the left is for men\nand the right is for women.\n94 Alicia Merline et al.\nbetween adolescent and adult functioning, such that\nadult alcohol abuse follows in a cascading manner from\nadolescent difficulties; at the same time, the normative-\nness of substance use and externalizing behaviors during\nadolescence may make it difficult to predict from this age\nperiod to adult functioning [13,68]. Addressing such\nquestions about the predictability of adolescent charac-\nteristics and experiences on adult substance abuse has\nbeen difficult, given the scarcity of long-term prospective\nstudies. Thus the present study, in conjunction with the\nother papers in this supplemental issue [69\u00ad75], offers a\nneeded perspective on life-span linkages of addiction.\nThis study shows that risk factors measured at age 18\ncan be useful in predicting alcohol use, heavy drinking\nand symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependency to age\n35. The findings regarding the lack of cohort variation in\nthe magnitude and patterns of predictors provides strong\nevidence that the identified risk factors were not given\nto historical variation during the period of this study,\nand reflect robust developmental linkages (rather than\ncohort-specific ones). Among the background character-\nistics found to predict later drinking, being white was\nassociated with 30-day drinking through age 35, but was\nassociated with heavy drinking only at age 22 and was\nunassociated with symptoms of abuse or dependence at\nage 35.This decrease in racial/ethnic differences with age\nis consistent with other research [20], and suggests that\nfuture research should examine the associations between\nalcohol use and its predictors separately by racial/ethnic\ngroup. Parental education was a risk factor for 30-day\nalcohol use at all ages and heavy drinking at age 22, but\nwas not associated with symptoms of abuse or depen-\ndence. As expected, parental drinking was a risk factor for\nall alcohol outcomes across all points of measurement,\nand in fact increased in predictive power over time for\nheavy drinking; it was generally a stronger predictor for\nmen than for women. These findings are consistent with\nprevious research [27] suggesting greater heritability for\nAUDs among males than among females.\nHigh school grades were protective against heavy\ndrinking but unassociated with 30-day drinking or symp-\ntoms of abuse or dependence, perhaps reflecting previ-\nously documented associations between intelligence and\nlight drinking [76] or the effects of school success and\ninstitutional identification as protective factors [29,30].\nCollege plans predicted more heavy drinking at age 22\nbut less heavy drinking at age 35, suggesting the differ-\nential college-based course of heavy drinking across\nadulthood; it is equally interesting that college plans pre-\ndicted greater 30-day drinking at all ages, but was unre-\nlated to alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms at age\n35.These associations suggest that although respondents\nwho attended college drank more heavily during their\ncollege years, they were not at greater risk for AUDs than\nothers, a finding consistent with other studies [77,78].\nThat college attendance was a short-term risk factor for\nalcohol use and abuse is worrisome, none the less, and\nsuggests the utility of studies aimed at identifying char-\nacteristics that differentiate desisters from those who\nexperience long-term alcohol problems [12].\nAs expected, indices of adolescent risk-taking and\nexternalizing behaviors were all correlated positively with\nadult alcohol use, heavy drinking and AUD symptoms.\nHowever, based on the multivariate models, there were\nsome notable inconsistencies in the pattern of these pre-\ndictors that suggest different pathways to adult use\nand abuse [79]. Risk-taking predicted consistently both\n30-day alcohol use and heavy drinking, but did not\npredict age 35 AUD symptoms, suggesting that risk-\ntaking is associated more with use (even heavy use) than\nwith abuse or dependence symptoms.Truancy was a con-\nsistent predictor of 30-day alcohol use, but not of heavy\ndrinking, and it predicted abuse and dependence symp-\ntoms; this suggests that truancy in high school may\nreflect problems that manifest later as AUDs. The findings\nthat aggression did not predict either 30-day drinking or\nheavy drinking at all (and was related inconsistently to\nabuse and dependence symptoms) are consistent with\nthe argument that aggression during late adolescence\nreflects a mix of ongoing and developmentally limited\nexternalizing behaviors, and thus may be of little value in\npredicting later difficulties at the population level [46].\nSimilarly, theft/property damage did not predict 30-day\nor heavy drinking significantly at any age. Interestingly,\ntheft/property damage was a particularly important pre-\ndictor of both abuse and dependence symptoms, with a\ngender difference indicating a stronger association with\nabuse (but not dependence) symptoms for women than\nfor men. Further research is needed to investigate\nwhether the more normative nature of theft or property\ndamage among male adolescents contributes to the\ngender difference. Of course, because all these indices\nwere included together, it is likely that some of the incon-\nsistencies were due to some `competition' among the pre-\ndictors, suggesting appropriate caution in interpreting\nthese findings.\nHigher depressive affect in high school predicted lower\nadult 30-day alcohol use and heavy drinking (but not age\n35 AUD symptoms), suggesting the social aspect of much\nof adult drinking, consistent with findings that loneliness\nserves a protective function against heavy drinking [30].\nSimilarly, evenings out with friends in high school pre-\ndicted higher adult 30-day alcohol use and heavy drink-\ning, but not age 35 AUD symptoms. The lack of a strong\nassociation between adolescent depressive affect and\nsymptoms of AUDs in middle adulthood in this study\nmay reflect limitations of our depressive affect measure\n(e.g. the absence of somatic symptoms and the focus on\nAdolescent risk factors for adult alcohol use 95\nself-derogation) or the presence of complex non-linear\nassociations between high school mental health and later\nHigh school use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana\nwere risk factors for all adult drinking measures, although\nadolescent drinking and marijuana use were better pre-\ndictors of later heavy drinking for men than for women.\nWhether these associations reflect an individual's pheno-\ntypic tendency toward substance use [83] or similarity of\nriskfactorsacrossmultiplesubstances[84],theirstrength\nhighlights the importance of identifying and intervening\nwith adolescent polydrug users in an effort to reduce adult\nalcohol and other drug use problems.\nThe associations between many of the risk and protec-\ntive factors and later alcohol use were largely stable\nacross gender and age of outcome. This was true for\nparental education, truancy, risk-taking and depressive\naffect as predictors of 30-day drinking and for grades,\nevenings out, risk-taking, self-esteem, depressive affect\nand cigarette use as predictors of heavy drinking. Other\nsignificant associations varied by age of outcome, gender\nor both. These include being white, parental education\n(as a predictor of heavy drinking), college plans, age 18\ndrinking and marijuana use. Coming from a single-\nparent home was the only risk factor included in this\nstudy that was found to have no significant association\nwith alcohol use when entered into a multivariate analy-\nsis. This suggests that the association between living with\na single parent and alcohol use may be limited to the\nadolescent period [21\u00ad23]. Overall, although effects were\ntypically small and much variance remains unaccounted\nfor, the ability of adolescent predictors to account signifi-\ncantly for alcohol use and abuse up to 17 years later\nshows that despite the multitude of more developmen-\ntally proximal influences on adult alcohol use and abuse,\nadolescent risk factors remain important.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study is unique in its use of both US national multi-\ncohort long-term longitudinal data and four different\nalcohol outcomes. In particular, by using national data\nfrom 11 different cohorts (thus essentially providing 11\nwe were able to test whether there were important his-\ntorical variations in the relationships. That there were no\nsuch variations demonstrates the robustness of the find-\nings and argues further that we are tapping into\ndevelopmental/age effects rather than cohort or secular\ntrend effects across this historical period. One important\nlimitation to our sample is that by starting with high\nschool seniors we missed high school dropouts, repre-\nsenting about 15% of the population. Other analyses in a\nseparate MTF study that included dropouts [29] indicate\nthat many of the relationships found here would have\nbeen stronger, suggesting that our findings reflect lower-\nbound estimates. In general, we cover a wide range of\nadolescent characteristics and experiences, but not all rel-\nevant aspects of adolescence; similarly, in terms of mea-\nsures, ours do not always provide in-depth considerations\nof relevant constructs. Because the assessments for this\nstudy began during the respondents' late adolescence, it is\ndifficult to distinguish between those respondents whose\nproblem behaviors began in adolescence and those whose\nproblem behaviors had an earlier onset in childhood or\nearly adolescence. Distinguishing these two groups could\nbe important when we use adolescent problem behaviors\nas predictors of later alcohol use. Previous research has\nindicated differing outcomes among individuals with life-\ncourse persistent and adolescence-limited antisocial\nbehaviors [45,46]. Building on our analyses, future\nefforts should be aimed at processes and mechanisms that\nconnect adolescent risk factors to later outcomes, focus-\ning upon adult characteristics and experiences that serve\nto mediate and moderate long-term linkages.\nCONCLUSION\nAlcohol use disorders across adulthood are among the\nstrongest predictors of morbidity and mortality [85,86],\nand a better understanding of their developmental ante-\ncedents can facilitate efforts to diminish their negative\ninfluence on individuals, families and communities. This\nstudy shows that many predictors of alcohol use mea-\nsured during adolescence retain their predictive value\nthroughout young adulthood and into early mid-life.\nAdolescence is marked by rapid change, exploration and\nbehavior that is often risky. Many individuals move\nbeyond the unsafe behaviors of their teenage years, but\nthe choices made during adolescence can set in motion\nbehaviors and experiences that contribute to adult func-\ntioning and adjustment [87].\n"
