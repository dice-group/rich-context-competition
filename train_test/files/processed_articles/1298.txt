During an interview, LUTS,\nsmoking history, alcohol consumption and\nphysical activity were assessed. Cases\ncomprised men with at least three of the\nsymptoms of nocturia, hesitancy, weak stream\nand incomplete emptying. Men who had had\nINTRODUCTION\nLUTS are a common bothersome condition in\nolder men. Although BPH is thought to be one\ncause of these symptoms not all men with\nsymptoms have an enlarged prostate [1];\nchanges in the tone of prostate and bladder\nsmooth muscle may also contribute to these\nsymptoms. Despite the high prevalence of\nLUTS not much is known about their causes.\nAge is the only well-established risk factor,\nbut it has been hypothesized that common\nlifestyle factors such as smoking,\nconsumption of alcohol, or physical inactivity\nmight contribute to the symptoms.\nWhile physical activity generally has been\nfound to be inversely associated with the\nprevalence of LUTS [2,3] the associations of\ncigarette smoking and alcohol consumption\nwith LUTS are more controversial. Most\nstudies found either no [3\u00ad8] or a positive\n[9\u00ad11] association between cigarette smoking\nand LUTS. Fewer studies have evaluated the\nassociation of alcohol intake with LUTS; two\nstudies reported an inverse association [4,11]\nwhereas in others there were positive\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) is a large\nAmerican cross-sectional study conducted\ncollected in NHANES III, we evaluated the\nassociation of cigarette smoking, alcohol\nconsumption and physical activity with LUTS\nin a multi-ethnic group of older men\nrepresentative of the USA.\nNHANES III is a nationally representative\ncross-sectional study of the non-\ninstitutionalized civilian USA population\nmultistage probability sampling design was\nused with oversampling of non-Hispanic\nblacks, Mexican-Americans and older\nparticipants. Subjects participated in an\ninterview conducted at home and had an\nextensive physical examination. In the present\naged 60 years at participation. Of these,\nwe excluded those men with a mobility\nimpairment (103) or who were not self-\nmen who reported during the interview of\nhaving had a diagnosis of prostate cancer at\nsome point before the interview. The\nanalysis.\nDuring the interview, all men who were aged\n60 years were asked to report the following\nsymptoms, which are part of the AUA\nSymptom Index [13]: (a) How many times per\nnight do you usually get up to urinate (pass\nwater)? (`nocturia'); (b) when you urinate\n(pass water), do you usually feel like you have\nnot completely emptied your bladder?\n(`incomplete emptying'); (c) do you usually\nhave trouble starting to urinate (pass water)?\n(`hesitancy'); and (d) has the force of your\nurinary stream of water decreased over the\nyears? (`weak stream'). In the present analysis,\nmen were considered as having LUTS if they\nreported at least three of the four symptoms.\nNocturia was included as a symptom when\nmen had to get up at least twice per night.\nMen were also asked if they had ever had\nsurgery for their prostate not related to\ncancer. Those men who reported such surgery\nwere excluded from the cases because\nremoving the hyperplastic tissue may have\nreduced or eliminated symptoms. The controls\nwere men who reported none of the four\nsymptoms and had never had prostate\nsurgery unrelated to cancer. Men with only\none or two symptoms were excluded from the\nanalysis to increase the specificity of the LUTS\ndefinition. In a cohort of similarly aged men\nunselected for urological problems and in\nwhich the AUA Symptom Index was\nadministered [11], the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient between the AUA symptom score\nand the index using only the four symptoms\nThe agreement between using as the\nthreshold a score of 3 or 4 on the abbreviated\nindex and using a score of 15+ on the full\nindex as the indicator of high moderate/\nsevere LUTS was 69%.\nSmoking history was assessed during the\ninterview and men were classified according\nto their smoking habit into current (1\u00ad34, or\n35 cigarettes/day), former, or never smokers.\nWe also calculated pack-years of smoking\nfrom smoking history, a pack-year being\ndefined as 20 cigarettes/day for 1 year. The\nconsumption frequency of alcoholic\nbeverages (beer, wine, liquor) during the past\nmonth was assessed using a food-frequency\nquestionnaire during the interview. This\nmethod captures long-term habits of alcohol\nconsumption. We categorized men into those\nwho consumed none of these three alcoholic\nbeverages, those who drank up to once per\nweek, more than once per week but less than\nonce per day, and those who drank alcohol\nonce a day or more. During the physical\nexamination at the Mobile Examination\nCenter a 24-h dietary recall was administered,\nwhich assessed the amount of alcohol\nconsumed during the previous day. From\nthese data, the daily intake of alcohol (in\ngrams) was calculated. We grouped men as\nday. Furthermore the type and frequency of\nleisure-time physical activity in the past\nmonth were ascertained during the interview.\nPhysical activities were coded and classified\nby rate of energy expenditure (i.e. by intensity)\naccording to a standardized coding scheme\ndeveloped by Ainsworth et al. [14]. Men were\ngrouped by their weekly frequency of\nmoderate and vigorous activity, defined as\nwalking, jogging or running, biking,\nswimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthenics,\ngardening, lifting weights, and other physical\nactivities, if the metabolic equivalent of the\nactivity compared to at rest (METs) was >2.4\nfurther evaluated the frequency of vigorous\nactivity only, which was defined as walking\n(for men aged > 79), jogging or running (all\nmen), biking (for men aged > 64), swimming\n(all men), aerobics (all men), dancing (for men\naged > 64), calisthenics (for men aged > 64),\ngardening (for men aged > 64), lifting\nweights (for men aged > 79), and other\nphysical activity if METs were >5.9 for men\ncircumference of the participants was\nmeasured during the physical examination.\nMen were considered to have a history of\nhypertension if they currently used\nmedication to treat hypertension or if they\nwere told by their doctor on two occasions\nthat they had hypertension/high blood\npressure.\nThe results were analysed statistically using\nSAS v8.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and\nSUDAAN [16] software. We used sample\nweights that took into account several\nfeatures of the NHANES III survey, i.e. the\nspecific probabilities of selection for the\nindividual domains that were over-sampled as\nwell as non-response and differences\nbetween the sample and the total USA\npopulation [12]. Logistic regression was used\nto calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI\nof LUTS for cigarette smoking, alcohol\nconsumption and physical activity. In the\nlogistic regression models, we adjusted for\nage (5-year categories) and race (non-\nHispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexican-\nAmerican, other). We further included in the\nmodels the waist circumference (continuous\nvariable) as a possible confounder, and\nmutually adjusted cigarette smoking, alcohol\nconsumption and physical activity. Trends for\nalcohol consumption and physical activity\nwere tested by assigning to each man the\nmedian value for the exposure category into\nwhich he fell and modelling this term as a\ncontinuous variable, the coefficient for which\nwas evaluated by the Wald test.\nRESULTS\nno LUTS and had never had prostate surgery\n(controls), 46.7% reported one or two\nsymptoms and 10.3% reported three or four\nsymptoms (cases). Men with LUTS were older\nthan men in the control group and had fewer\nyears of education (Table 1). These men also\ndrank less alcohol, but smoking patterns and\nweekly frequency of physical activity did not\ndiffer.\nMen who currently smoked up to 35\ncigarettes/day had no greater odds of LUTS,\nbut there was insignificantly greater odds of\nLUTS in men who smoked 35 cigarettes/per\nday (Table 2). However, this association was\nstrongly attenuated after adjusting for waist\ncircumference, the frequency of alcohol\nconsumption, and the frequency of moderate\nand vigorous activity. Of these factors, waist\ncircumference caused the strongest\nattenuation of the OR for heavy smoking.\nFormer smokers had a slightly but not\nstatistically significant greater odds of LUTS\nthan never smokers. Men who had ever\nsmoked 50 pack-years had a higher odds of\nLUTS than never smokers. This association was\nlimited to former smokers; there was no\nassociation among current smokers who had\nsmoked 50 pack-years. Further adjustment\nfor waist circumference, but not for\nhypertension, attenuated the association of\npack-years with LUTS in both ever and former\nsmokers.\nThere was an inverse association between the\nfrequency of alcohol consumption and LUTS\nin this group of older men (Table 2). Compared\nto non-drinkers, men who drank alcohol daily\nhad a significantly lower odds of LUTS. This\nassociation was not substantially altered after\nS M O K I N G , A L C O H O L , P H Y S I C A L A C T I V I T Y A N D L U T S I N O L D E R M E N\nadjusting for waist circumference, physical\nactivity and cigarette smoking, or for\nhypertension. Using a second approach to\nassess alcohol consumption by 24-h dietary\nrecall, men with an alcohol intake of 38 g/\nalcohol intake.\nMen who reported no leisure-time physical\nactivity had a significantly higher odds of LUTS\nthan men who reported some physical activity,\nand adjusting for smoking, alcohol intake and\nwaist circumference did not change this\nassociation. All levels of moderate or vigorous\nphysical activity were also associated with a\nsignificantly lower odds of LUTS than men\nwho reported no moderate or physical activity\n(Table 2). These results did not change after\nfurther adjusting for history of hypertension\nor for the presence of the metabolic syndrome\n(data not shown). However, vigorous physical\nactivity alone was not consistently inversely\nassociated with LUTS. The most frequently\nreported activity was walking. Fewer men with\nLUTS than men without reported walking\nreported walking had a lower odds of LUTS\nthan men who did not, although the OR did\nnot decrease monotonically (Fig. 1). Adjusting\nfor total frequency of moderate and\nvigorous physical activity as well as waist\ncircumference, smoking and alcohol drinking\ndid not change the association for walking.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this group of older men in the USA, alcohol\nconsumption and physical activity (moderate\nand vigorous) were both inversely associated\nwith LUTS. Men who walked regularly were\nless likely to have LUTS than men who did not.\nThere was no association between current\ncigarette smoking and LUTS, but we could not\nexclude that former heavy smokers were more\nlikely to have LUTS.\nSeveral studies have examined the association\nbetween cigarette smoking and LUTS, with\ninconsistent results. Most studies found no\nstatistically significant association between\ncigarette smoking and LUTS [3\u00ad8], whereas\nthree studies reported a statistically\nsignificantly positive association [9\u00ad11]. In an\nanalysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up\nStudy [11], heavy smokers had a significantly\nhigher risk of LUTS than never smokers,\nwhereas moderate smokers did not. Similarly,\nin NHANES III, there was no association for\ncurrent cigarette smoking, but a suggestion of\na higher occurrence of LUTS in heavier\ncurrent, lifetime and former smokers.\nThere may be several explanations for LUTS\npossibly being more common in long-term\nheavy smokers. Nicotine increases\nsympathetic nervous system activity [17] and\nmight contribute to LUTS via an increase in\nthe tone of the prostate and bladder smooth\nmuscle. Furthermore, smoking is thought to\nbe associated with higher concentrations of\ntestosterone [18]. A higher testosterone\nconcentration might be associated with\nhigher intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone\nlevels, which is thought to be important in the\ndevelopment of BPH and LUTS [19].\nThere was a slightly greater chance of LUTS in\nformer smokers and these men also had a\nhigher odds of LUTS when they smoked 50\npack-years over their lifetime. Platz et al. [11]\nalso reported a higher risk of LUTS in former\nsmokers. The reasons for a greater risk of LUTS\nin former smokers are not clear. The greater\nwaist circumference in former than in current\nsmokers in this group of men might\ncontribute to LUTS via increased insulin\nresistance [20]. Also, men who develop\nTABLE 1 Age-adjusted baseline characteristics of men aged 60 years in the NHANES III, 1988\u00ad94\nFactor Controls Cases P\nMean (SEM)\nSmoking habits, %\nMean (SEM)\nAlcohol consumption\nRace/ethnicity, %\nPhysical activity\u00b6, mean (SEM) times/week\nAll percentages and means are calculated using sampling weights; adjusted for age; *t-test; chi-square\ntest;assessedbyfoodfrequencyquestionnaireduringthehouseholdinterview;\u00b6assessedby24-hrecall\nduring the physical examination (see text).\nFIG. 1. Age- and race-adjusted OR of LUTS by\nwalking (miles/week) in men aged 60 years in the\nWalking, miles/week\nsymptoms might be more likely to stop\nsmoking than men without symptoms. In\naddition, we cannot exclude chance as an\nexplanation for this finding.\nMen who frequently consumed alcohol were\nless likely to have LUTS than men who did not.\nThere was also a lower odds of LUTS with\nincreasing daily alcohol intake when using a\nsecond dietary assessment tool that captured\nintake the day before the interview. These\nresults support the findings of two other\nstudies reporting negative associations\nbetween alcohol consumption and LUTS\n[4,11], whereas the association was positive in\ntwo others [3,7]. Platz et al. [11] reported\nlower odds in moderate drinkers, but this\nprotective effect was attenuated in men who\nconsumed >50 g alcohol/day (\u00aa 3.5 or more\ndrinks per day). This pattern was also apparent\nin another USA cohort study [9], in which\nAfrican-American men with an intake of\n>72 g/day (five or more drinks per day) had a\nsignificantly higher odds of LUTS than non-\ndrinkers, whereas there was no association in\nmoderate consumers. Light to moderate\nalcohol consumption is associated with\nimproved insulin sensitivity [21] and\ndecreased testosterone concentration [22]. As\nan alternative explanation, we cannot exclude\nthat the observed inverse association between\nthe frequency of alcohol consumption and\nLUTS is caused by avoidance of fluids,\nespecially of alcoholic beverages that have a\ndiuretic effect, by men with LUTS, as there\nwas an insignificantly lower odds of LUTS in\nmen who drank caffeinated beverages at least\nfour times a week (data not shown).\nIn NHANES III, men who were physically active\nin their leisure time were less likely to have\nLUTS. All levels of moderate and vigorous\nactivity were inversely associated with LUTS,\nbut the association for vigorous activity did\nnot decrease consistently. Two previous\nstudies reported inverse associations between\nthe frequency of physical activity and LUTS\nPhysical activity is associated with improved\ninsulin sensitivity [23]. We previously reported\nstatistically significant positive associations\nof glycosylated haemoglobin, a long-term\nmarker of glucose and insulin metabolism,\nand the metabolic syndrome with LUTS in this\ngroup of men [24]. Alternatively, reductions in\nthe odds of LUTS by physical activity might be\ncaused by changes of sympathetic nervous\nsystem activity. Aerobic exercise training may\nelicit adaptations in the adrenergic system,\nbecause the sympathetic nervous system is\nactivated through each bout of exercise, and\nrepeated activation of this system could result\nin a reduction of the resting system activity\n[25]. In contrast to Platz etal. [2] there was no\nconsistently inverse association between\nvigorous physical activity and LUTS in the\nTABLE 2 The OR of LUTS by current smoking status, pack-years of smoking, alcohol consumption and\nphysical exercise\nCigarette smoking status\nCurrent, cigarettes/day\nPack-years of cigarette smoking\nAll men\nCurrent smokers only\nFormer smokers only\nAlcohol consumption, frequency\u00a7\nFrequency of physical activity, times/week\u00b6\nModerate and vigorous\nVigorous\n*All results were calculated using sampling weights; adjusted for age and race; second column:\nsmoking status: adjusted for age, race, frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity, frequency\nof alcohol consumption and current waist circumference (continuous); \u00a7second column: alcohol\nconsumption: adjusted for age, race, frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity, smoking\nstatusandcurrentwalstcircumference(continuous);\u00b6secondcolumn:physicalactivity:adjustedforage,\nrace, frequency of alcohol consumption, smoking status and current waist circumference (continuous).\nS M O K I N G , A L C O H O L , P H Y S I C A L A C T I V I T Y A N D L U T S I N O L D E R M E N\npresent study. Only men who reported\nvigorous activity up to twice a week had a\nstatistically significantly lower odds of LUTS,\nbut the association was weaker in men who\nwere more vigorously active. However, in this\ngeneral population, few men reported\nparticipating in vigorous physical activity\nmore than twice a week.\nIn addition to an inverse association between\ntotal moderate and vigorous activity, men\nwho walked, the most often reported physical\nactivity in this group of older men, were\nless likely to have LUTS. This association\nwas reported previously in the Health\nProfessionals Follow-up Study [2]. A small\ncase-control study in Japan [26] reported that\n12 weeks was inversely associated with\nsympathetic nervous activity and blood\npressure in hypertensive men compared\nwith sedentary men. Therefore, men who\nwalk regularly might be less likely to have\nLUTS because of the lower tone of the\nprostate and bladder smooth muscle, and\nlower blood pressure, previously been shown\nto be positively associated with LUTS\nSeveral aspects of the study design merit\nfurther discussion. First, NHANES III is a cross-\nsectional study representative of the USA\npopulation of older men, thus aiding in the\nbroad general applicability of these results.\nAlso, the elderly were over-sampled, allowing\nfor more stable estimates in the analysis of\nolder men. Second, the questions on LUTS in\nNHANES III covered four of the seven\nquestions of the AUA Symptom Index, which\nalso includes frequency, intermittency and\nurgency, which together discriminated\nbetween men with and with no BPH in a\nclinical setting [13]. To increase the specificity\nof the present analysis, we included only men\nwith three or four symptoms in the case\ngroup; we exclude men with only one or two\nsymptoms in the control or case group\nbecause individually these symptoms are not\nspecific for LUTS. Third, we cannot completely\nexclude that some men in the control group\ndid not report LUTS because they were taking\nmedications to treat their symptoms.\nHowever, this is unlikely because NHANES III\nmedication for treating BPH symptoms was\nconsumption and physical activity were\nassessed concurrently with LUTS. Therefore,\nthe results reflect associations and are not\nnecessarily causal.\nIn conclusion, physical activity, even moderate\nactivity like walking, may be beneficial for\nLUTS. Additionally, moderate alcohol\nconsumption might be associated with a\nreduction in the occurrence of LUTS, whereas\nheavy cigarette smoking in the past may\nincrease the occurrence of LUTS in older men.\nIntervention studies are needed to determine\nwhether the frequency of LUTS can be\nmodulated by changes in these lifestyle\nfactors.\n"
