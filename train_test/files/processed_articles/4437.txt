    "abstract": "Abstract\nParamedics, health care workers who assess and manage health concerns in the prehospital setting, are increasingly providing\npsychosocial care in response to a rise in mental health call volume. Observers have construed this fact as \"misuse\" of\nparamedic services, and proposed as solutions better triaging of patients, better mental health training of paramedics, and\na greater number of community mental health services. In this commentary, we argue that despite the ostensibly well-\nintentioned nature of these solutions, they shift attention and accountability away from relevant public policies, as well as from\nbroader economic, social, and political determinants of mental health, while placing responsibility on those requiring services\nor, at best, on the health care system. We also argue that the perspective of paramedics, who are exposed to, and interact\nwith, individuals in their everyday environments, has the potential to inform a better, structural and critical, understanding\nof the factors driving the rise in psychosocial crises in the first place. Finally, we suggest that a greater engagement with the\npolitical and social determinants of mental health would lead to preventing, rather than primarily reacting to, these crises\nafter the fact.\n",
