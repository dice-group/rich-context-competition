The effect of supercritical\nextracts of yeagam peel (SEYG) on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases, STAT3-regulated gene products, cellular\nproliferation, and apoptosis was examined. The in vivo effect of SEYG on the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft\ntumors in athymic nu/nu male mice was also investigated. We found SEYG exerted substantial inhibitory effect on STAT3\nactivation in human prostate cancer DU145 cells as compared to other tumor cells analyzed. SEYG inhibited proliferation\nand downregulated the expression of various STAT3-regulated gene products such as bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1/2,\ncyclin D1, cyclin E, COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9. This correlated with an increase in apoptosis as indicated by an increase\nin the expression of p53 and p21 proteins, the sub-G1 arrest, and caspase-3-induced PARP cleavage. When administered\nintraperitoneally, SEYG reduced the growth of DU145 human prostate xenograft tumors through downmodulation of\nSTAT3 activation in athymic nu/nu male mice. Overall, these results suggest that SEYG extract has the potential source of\nSTAT3 inhibitors that may have a potential in chemoprevention of human prostate cancer cells.\n",

A number of animal studies and epidemiological\nstudies in human propose that fruits and vegetables can pre-\nvent cancer.1 Citrus is a common term and genus (Citrus) of\nflowering plants in the rue family, Rutaceae. Citrus is\nbelieved to have originated from the part of Southeast Asia\nbordered by Northeast India, Burma (Myanmar), and the\nYunnan province of China.2 Natural and cultivated origin\nhybrids include commercially important fruits such as the\noranges, grapefruit, lemons, some limes, and some tanger-\nines. We describe here the bioactive potential of the fruit of\nCitrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka (locally known as Iyokan),\nwhich is one of a variety of citrus fruits. The citrus fruits\nhave been shown to suppress the growth of various tumors,\nincluding prostate carcinoma,3,4 breast carcinoma,5 colon\nMost of the citrus species offer large quantities of phyto-\nchemicals that have beneficial effects attributed to their\nchemical components: tangeretin, nobiletin, hesperetin,\nnaringin, and naringenin. We have recently shown that nob-\niletin, one of citrus flavonoids, can downregulate CXC che-\nmokine receptor type 4 and matrix metallopeptidase-9\nthrough the suppression of the constitutive NF-B and\nMAPKs activation.11 We further observed that nobiletin can\ninduce apoptosis and potentiate the effects of the anticancer\ndrug 5-fluorouracil in p53-mutated SNU-16 human gastric\ngenin,15 and hesperetin,16 derived from citrus fruits, are\nknown to exhibit diverse anticancer activities in a variety of\ntumor cells.\nThe signal transducer and activator of transcription\n(STAT) proteins consist of a 7-member family of latent\ncytoplasmic transcription factors that are stimulated through\ntyrosine phosphorylation by various cytokines (eg, interleu-\nkin-6, tumor necrosis factor-), growth factors (eg, epider-\nmal growth factor, transforming growth factor-, hepatocyte\ngrowth factor), and oncogenic kinases (eg, Src).17 STAT\nactivation pathways have been strongly associated with the\nproliferation, antiapoptosis, and chemoresistance of\ntumors.18 We have previously reported that the anticancer\neffects of Dangyuja (Citrus grandis Osbeck) leaves are\nmediated in part through suppression of STAT3 activation.19\nIt is possible that supercritical extracts of yeagam peel\n(SEYG) may also mediate its effects through the modula-\ntion of this pathway. Moreover, the detailed molecular\nmechanisms(s) by which SEYG mediates antitumor activi-\nties has not yet been fully elucidated.\nOnce activated, STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation-\ninduced homodimerization, leading to nuclear transloca-\ntion, DNA binding, and subsequent gene transcription. The\nphosphorylation is mediated through the activation of non-\nreceptor protein tyrosine kinases called janus-like kinase\n(JAK). JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 have been impli-\ncated in the activation of STAT3.20 In addition, the role of\nc-Src kinase has been demonstrated in STAT3 phosphoryla-\ntion.21 STAT3 has been shown to regulate the expression of\ngenes that participate in oncogenesis, such as apoptosis\ninhibitors (bcl-xl, bcl-2, IAP-1/2, and survivin), cell-cycle\nregulators (COX-2, cyclin D\n, and cyclin E), and inducers\nof angiogenesis (MMP-9 and VEGF).18 Thus, small mole-\ncule inhibitors of STAT3 activation have the potential for\nboth the prevention and treatment of cancer.22,23\nBecause of the critical role of STAT3 in survival, prolif-\neration, metastasis, and angiogenesis, we postulated that\nSEYG mediates its effects through the suppression of the\nSTAT3 pathway. The results that follow indicate that SEYG\nspecifically suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation and\ndownregulated the expression of cell survival, proliferative,\nand angiogenic gene products, leading to the suppression of\nproliferation and the induction of apoptosis in human pros-\ntate cancer DU145 cells. SEYG also inhibited the growth of\nhuman DU145 cells and suppressed constitutive STAT3\nsignaling pathway in a xenograft mouse prostate model.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant Materials\nFruits of Citrus iyo Hort. ex Tanaka, locally known as yea-\ngam, were collected from the National Institute of\nSubtropical Agriculture, Jeju Province, Korea. The fruits\nwere harvested from native plants during the harvest season\nwere previously taxonomically identified, and voucher\nspecimens were deposited in the laboratory of Dr S. K. Cho\nat the College of Applied Life Sciences, Jeju National\nUniversity.\nSupercritical Fluid Extraction\nPeel of yeagam (331 g) were loaded separately into a 1-L\nthick-walled stainless steel thimble extraction cell and\nextracted at 50\u00b0C for 2 hours. The extraction was performed\nusing CO\nat 300 bar pressure in a diaphragm compressor\n(Haskel Co, Bellingham, WA). The extracts were deposited\nin a separator attached to a metering valve and held in a\ncirculating bath at 0\u00b0C. Finally, the extracts were collected\ninto a clean vial and stored at -21\u00b0C until analysis.\nReagents\nAn 100 mg/mL solution of SEYG was prepared in 30% etha-\nnol (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]]), stored in\nsmall aliquots at -20\u00b0C, diluted in the culture medium for in\nvitro experiments or diluted in the PBS for in vivo experi-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), propidium iodide (PI),\nTris base, glycine, NaCl, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), and\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-\nAldrich (St Louis, MO). RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's modified\nEagle medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and\nLightShift Chemiluminescent EMSAkit were obtained from\nThermoFisherScientificInc(Waltham,MA).5-Biotinylated\nSTAT3 and Oct-1 oligonucleotide were from Bioneer\nCorporation (Daejeon, Korea).Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-\nrabbit IgG (H+L) antibody, 0.4% trypan blue vital stain, and\nantibiotic-antimycotic mixture were obtained from Life\nTechnologies (Grand Island, NY). Anti-COX-2 antibody\nwas obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Anti-\nphospho-JAK1, anti-JAK1, anti-phospho-JAK2, anti-JAK2,\nanti-phospho-Src, and anti-Src antibodies were purchased\nfrom Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-\nphospho-STAT3, anti-STAT3, anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E,\nanti-p21, anti-p53, anti-bcl-2, anti-bcl-xL, anti-survivin,\nanti-IAP-1, anti-IAP-2, anti-VEGF, anti-MMP-9 (matrix\nmetalloproteinase-9), anti-caspase-3, anti-cleaved cas-\npase-3, anti-PARP, anti-Ki-67, anti-CD31, anti--actin, and\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u00adconjugated secondary anti-\nbodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa\nCruz, CA). Caspase-3 inhibitor was from Calbiochem (San\nDiego, CA). TUNEL (terminal transferase mediated dUTP-\nfluorescein nick end labeling) assay kit was from Roche\nDiagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Whole-cell\nlysates of tumor tissues were obtained with T-PER Tissue\nProtein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\nCell Lines\nHuman multiple myeloma U266, human myeloid leukemia\nhuman prostate RWPE-1, human breast carcinoma\nMDA-MB-231, and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma\nHepG2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were\nobtained from the American Type Culture Collection\n(Manassas, VA). M2182 was kindly provided by Dr Paul B.\nFisher (Virginia Commonwealth University School of\nMEF cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing\n10% FBS. All media were also supplemented with 100 U/\nmL of penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin.\nMTT Assay\nCell viability was analyzed by an MTT assay to detect\nNADH-dependent dehydrogenase activity,24 as described\nWestern Blotting\nAfter the cells were treated with the indicated concentra-\ntions of SEYG, the cells were lysed and the total protein\nconcentrations were determined by Bradford reagent\n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were resolved on\nsodium dodecyl\u00adpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE).26 Western blot analysis was performed\nusing a method described previously.25 Statistical analy-\nsis and densitometry values for Western blot experiments\nwere estimated by the Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc,\nSan Jose, CA) and Image J software (National Institutes\nof Health, Bethesda, MD).\nEMSA for STAT3-DNA Binding\nSTAT3-DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobil-\nity shift assay (EMSA) using a 5-biotinylated STAT3 oligo-\nserved as a loading control. The Oct-1 probe contained the\nmobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described pre-\nviously.25 The membrane was detected following manufac-\nturer instructions using LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA\nkit (Waltham, MA).\nImmunocytochemistry for STAT3 Localization\nImmunocytochemistry was performed as described\nMonitoring of Cell Growth With the RTCA MP\nInstrument\nCell growth behavior was continuously monitored for 48\nhours using the xCELLigence RTCAMPInstrument (Roche\nDiagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Background\nimpedance was measured in 100 \u00b5L cell culture medium per\nwell. The final volume was adjusted to 200 \u00b5L cell culture\nmedium, including 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well. After plating, imped-\nance was recorded in 15-minute intervals. All experiments\nwere performed in triplicates. Cell Index (CI) values were\nnormalized to the time point of 200 \u00b5g/mL of SEYG admin-\nistration (referred to as normalized CI).\nTransfection of Plasmids\nWe investigated the ability of commercially available elec-\ntroporation systems, the Neon Transfection System\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection efficiency was\nmeasured by Western blot analysis. MEF cells were pre-\npared for transfection after cells were resuspended with 120\n\u00b5L of Neon Resuspension Buffer R for every 1 million cells.\nFor electroporation, MEF cells with 1 \u00b5g of pMXs-STAT3C\nor pMXs-gw plasmids were aliquoted into a sterile micro-\ncentrifuge tube. A Neon Tip was inserted into the Neon\nPipette and the mixture was aspirated into the tip avoiding\nair bubbles. The Neon Pipette was then inserted into the\nNeon Tube containing 3 mL of Neon Electrolytic Buffer E in\nthe Neon Pipette Station. MEF cells were pulsed once with a\nfection, MEF cells were treated with 200 \u00b5g/mL of SEYG\nfor 6 hours or 24 hours. Then whole-cell extracts were pre-\npared for phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), STAT3, PARP, cyclin\nD1, and -actin analysis by Western blotting.\nCell Cycle Analysis\nCell cycle analysis was performed as described\nAnnexin V Assay\nOne of the early indicators of apoptosis is the rapid translo-\ncation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid\nphosphatidylserine from the cell's cytoplasmic interface to\nthe extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry\ncan be detected using the binding properties of annexin V.\nTo detect apoptosis, we used annexin V antibody conju-\ngated with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC). Annexin V assay was performed using a method\ndescribed previously.28\nStudies With Caspase-3 Inhibitor\na 60-mm plate. The cells were pretreated with 20 \u00b5M of\ncaspase-3 inhibitor for 2 hours and then treated with SEYG\nfor an additional 24 hours, and then subjected to annexin V\nand PI staining. The cells were washed and observed\naccordingly with flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson,\nHeidelberg, Germany). Acquisition and analysis of the data\nwere performed using Cell Quest 3.0 software.\nTUNEL assay was performed as described previously.29\nAnimals\nAllproceduresinvolvinganimalswerereviewedandapproved\nby KHU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\n(KHUASP(SE)-13-025). Six-week-old athymic nu/nu male\nmice (NARABiotech, Seoul, Korea) were implanted subcuta-\nneously in the right flank with DU145 cells. The animals were\nhoused (11 mice/cage) in the standard mice plexiglass cages\nin a room maintained at constant temperature and humidity\nunder 12-hour light and dark cycle and fed with regular auto-\nclaved mouse chow with water ad libitum. None of the mice\nexhibited any lesions and all were tested pathogen-free.\nBefore initiating the experiment, we acclimatized all mice to a\npulverized diet for 3 days.\nSubcutaneous Implantation of DU145 Cells\nDU145 cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures,\nwashed once in serum-free medium, and resuspended in PBS.\nOnly suspensions consisting of single cells, with >90% viabil-\nPBS-Matrigel [1:1]) were injected subcutaneously into the\nright flank of the mice. To prevent leakage, a cotton swab was\nheld cautiously for 1 minute over the site of injection.\nExperimental Protocol\nWhen tumors have reached 0.25 cm in diameter, the mice\nwere randomized into the following treatment groups\n(n = 11 per group). Group I was given PBS (200 \u00b5L, intra-\nperitoneally [ip] thrice/week), group II was given SEYG\n(50 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week), and group III was\ngiven SEYG (200 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week).\nTherapy was continued for 4 weeks, and the animals were\neuthanized 1 week later. Primary tumors were excised and\nthe final tumor volume was measured as V = 4/3r3, where\nr is the mean radius of the 3 dimensions (length, width, and\ndepth). Half of the tumor tissue was fixed in formalin and\nembedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and rou-\ntine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The other half\nwas snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C.\nWestern Blot Analysis for Tumor Tissues\nProstate tumor tissues (75-100 mg) from control and exper-\nimental mice were minced and incubated on ice for 30 min-\nutes in 0.5 mL of ice-cold T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction\nReagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The minced tissue was cen-\nwere then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to\nnitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and\ndetected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE\nHealthcare, Waukesha, WI). Densitometry values for\nWestern blot experiments were estimated by the Image J\nsoftware (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).\nImmunohistochemical Analysis of Prostate\nTumor Samples\nSolid tumors from control and various treatment groups were\nfixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, processed, and\nembedded in paraffin. Sections were cut and deparaffinized in\nxylene, and dehydrated in graded alcohol and finally hydrated\nin water. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the slide\nImmunohistochemistry was performed following manufac-\nturer instructions (ImmPRESS Reagent Kit; Vector\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA). Briefly, endogenous peroxi-\ndaseswerequenchedwith3%hydrogenperoxide.Nonspecific\nbinding was blocked by incubation in the blocking reagent in\nthe ImmPRESS Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Sections were incubated overnight with primary\nantibodies as follows: anti-Ki-67, anti-CD31, anti-cleaved\ncaspase-3 (each at 1:100 dilutions). Slides were subsequently\nwashed several times in PBS and were incubated with\nImmPRESS reagent according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. Immunoreactive species were detected using 3,3-\ndiaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as a substrate.\nSections were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin and\nmounted under glass cover slips. Images were taken using an\nOlympus BX51 microscope (magnification, 20\u00d7). Positive\ncells (brown) were quantitated using the Image-Pro plus 6.0\nsoftware package (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD).\nGas Chromatography\u00adMass Spectrometry (GC-\nMS) Analysis\nChromatographic analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu\nGC-MS (model QP-2010, Shimadzu Co, Kyoto, Japan)\nattached to AOC-5000 autosampler in electron impact mode.\nThe ionization voltage was 70 eV, and the temperatures of the\nThe capillary column used was an Rtx-5MS (30 m length,\noven temperature was programmed at 60\u00b0C (isothermal for 2\nat 8\u00b0C/min (isothermal for 12 minutes). Helium was used as\nthe carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with 57.4 kPa pres-\nsure, and an injector volume of 1 \u00b5L using a 1:10 split ratio.\nMass range was from m/z 40 to 500 amu. The extracts of the\nfruits were solubilized in n-hexane, filtered through a 0.20-\n\u00b5m syringe filter (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan), and aliquots\nwere injected into the GC-MS. Mass spectra of each com-\npound were tentatively identified with the mass spectral data\ncontained within the WILEY7 and NIST05 libraries and by\ntheir Kovats indices relative to C\n-C\nn-alkanes (Sigma-\nAldrich, St Louis, MO) on an Rtx-5MS column. Further ten-\ntative identification was completed by comparing the mass\nspectra with those of authentic standards.30\nFor the determination of concentration of major com-\npounds, limonene, linalool, and geranyl acetate in extract,\ncalibration curves of reference standards at 3 concentrations\nwere prepared in chloroform: 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5g/mL for limo-\n0.2 \u00b5g/mL for geranyl acetate, respectively, in the same\ncondition.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by Student's t test and\none-way analysis of variance, (ANOVA). A P value of less\nthan .05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nSEYG Exerts Cytotoxicity Against Various Types\nof Human Cancer Cells\nTo determine cytotoxicity, cultured human multiple\nprostate carcinoma (DU145), human breast carcinoma\n(MDA-MB-231), human hepatocellular liver carcinoma\n(HepG2), and normal human prostate (RWPE-1) cells were\ntreated with indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours,\nand viability was measured by MTT assay. As shown in\nFigure 1A, SEYG broadly inhibited the viability of 5 tumor\ncells in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that\ninhibition of cell viability by SEYG is cell type nonspecific.\nHowever, SEYG had no substantial effect on the suppres-\nsion of cell viability in RWPE-1 cells.\nSEYG Inhibits Constitutive STAT3\nPhosphorylation in Human Prostate Cancer\nPrevious studies have shown that STAT3 is a key point of\nconvergence of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. We\nnext investigated whether SEYG can modulate constitutive\ndetermine whether SEYG could inhibit STAT3 phosphory-\nlation in these cells. As shown in Figure 1B, the constitutive\nactivation of STAT3 was clearly suppressed by SEYG in\nDU145 cells. However, SEYG had a minimal effect on\nhad no effect on the suppression of constitutive STAT3\nphosphorylation in K562 cells. Furthermore, as shown in\nFigure 1C, we determined whether SEYG could suppress\nSTAT3 phosphorylation in various prostate cancer cell\nlines. We found that SEYG suppressed the constitutive\nprostate cancer cells.\nSEYG Suppresses Constitutive STAT3\nPhosphorylation in a Time- and Dose-Dependent\nManner\nHuman prostate cancer (DU145) cells are well known to\nexpress constitutively active STAT3.25 Whether SEYG can\nmodulate the constitutive STAT3 activation in the cells was\nand RWPE-1 cells (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were incubated at 37\u00b0C with various indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours, and the\nviable cells were assayed using the MTT reagent. ***P < .001 compared to nontreated. (B and C) Cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were\nincubated with the indicated concentrations of SEYG for 6 hours. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, then equal amounts of lysates\nwere analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against p-STAT3 and STAT3. The results shown here are representative of\n3 independent experiments. Graphs represent band intensities of indicated proteins. All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. ***P\n< .001 versus control. (D and E) DU145 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were treated with various indicated concentrations of SEYG and\ntime intervals. Then equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against p-STAT3 (Tyr705) and\nSTAT3. The results shown here are representative of 3 independent experiments. Graphs represent band intensities of indicated\nproteins. All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. **P < .01 versus control.\ninvestigated. We determined the incubation time with\nSEYG required for the suppression of STAT3 activation in\nDU145 cells. As shown in Figure 1D (upper panel), the\ninhibition was time-dependent, with strong inhibition\noccurring at around 6 hours, with no effect on the expres-\nsion of STAT3 (Figure 1D, lower panel). As shown in\nFigure 1E (upper panel), SEYG suppressed the constitutive\nactivation of STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner,\nwith substantial inhibition occurring at 200 \u00b5g/mL. SEYG\nhad no effect on the expression of STAT3 protein (Figure\n1E, lower panel).\nSEYG Suppresses Constitutive Activation of\nSTAT3 has been reported to be activated by the soluble\ntyrosine kinases of the Janus family (JAK).20 Because\nJAK1/JAK2 are the main kinases involved, we examined\nthe effect of SEYG on JAK1/JAK2 activation. As shown in\nFigure 2A-D, both JAK1 and JAK2 were constitutively\nactive in DU145 cells and the treatment with SEYG clearly\nsuppressed this phosphorylation in a time- and concentra-\ntion-dependent manner.\nSEYG Inhibits Constitutive Activation of Src\nBecause STAT3 is also activated by soluble tyrosine kinases\nof the Src kinase families,21 we determined the effect of\nSEYG on the constitutive activation of Src kinase in DU145\ncells. We found that SEYG suppressed the constitutive\nphosphorylation of Src kinase (Figure 2E and F, upper\npanel). The levels of total Src kinase remained unchanged\nunder the same conditions (Figure 2E and F, lower panel).\nOverall, our data clearly indicate that SEYG may block the\ncooperation of JAK1/2 and Src involved in tyrosyl phos-\nphorylation of STAT3.\nSEYG Inhibits Binding of STAT3 to the DNA\nBecause tyrosine phosphorylation causes the dimerization of\nSTATs and their translocation to the nucleus, where they bind\nto DNA and regulate gene transcription,33 we determined\nwhether SEYG suppresses the DNA binding activities of\nSTAT3. EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from\nDU145 cells showed that SEYG reduced STAT3-DNA bind-\ning activities in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). These\nresults show that SEYG abrogates the DNAbinding ability of\nSEYG Reduces Nuclear Pool of STAT3 in Tumor\nCells\nBecause the active dimer of STAT3 is capable of translocat-\ning to the nucleus and inducing transcription of specific\ntarget genes,33 we determined whether SEYG suppresses\nthe nuclear translocation of STAT3. Immunocytochemistry\nresults (Figure 3B) clearly demonstrate that SEYG reduced\nthe translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus in DU145 cells.\nSEYG Suppresses Cell Proliferation in Human\nProstate Cancer Cells\nTo specifically examine the antitumor activity of SEYG on\ntrations of SEYG, and then cell viability was analyzed using\nevery 15-minute time intervals with the xCELLigence\nRTCA MP Instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). As\nshown in Figure 3C, SEYG significantly suppressed cell\nproliferation in prostate cancer cells in a time-dependent\nmanner.\nSEYG Downregulates Expression of Various\nProteins Involved in Antiapoptosis, Proliferation,\nand Angiogenesis\nBecause bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2 have\nbeen implicated in apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunc-\ntion, we next examined the effects of SEYG on the constitu-\ntive expression of these proteins. We found that SEYG\nsuppressed the expression of antiapoptotic gene products in\na dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). Also, SEYG\nrepressed proteins linked with cell proliferation (cyclin D1,\ncyclin E, and COX-2) and angiogenesis (MMP-9 and\nVEGF; Figure 3E and F).\nSEYG Induces the Expression of Both p53 and\np53 is important in multicellular organisms, where it regu-\nlates the cell cycle and, thus, functions as a tumor suppres-\nsor that is involved in preventing development of cancer.34\nThe expression of p21 is controlled by the tumor suppressor\na prototypical member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-\ndependent kinase inhibitors. It negatively modulates cell\ncycle progression by inhibiting the activities of cyclin E/\nCDK2 and cyclin D/CDK4 complexes and blocks DNA\nreplication by binding to proliferating cell nuclear anti-\ngen.36 We found that SEYG induced the expression of both\np53 and p21 in a concentration-dependent manner in pros-\ntate tumor cells (Figure 4A).\nSEYG Activates Caspase-3 and Causes PARP\nCleavage\nCells were treated with indicated concentration of SEYG for\n24 hours and then examined for caspase activation byWestern\nblot using specific antibodies. We found a dose-dependent\nFigure 2. SEYG downregulates p-JAK1, JAK2, and Src levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

(D-F) DU145 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were incubated\nwith the indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and 20 \u00b5g of the whole-cell lysate was\nresolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, sliced from the membrane based on the molecular weight,\nand then probed with antibodies against bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP1/2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9 as described\nin \"Materials and Methods.\" The same blots were stripped and reprobed with -actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. The\nresults shown here are representative of 3 independent experiments.\nFigure 4. SEYG induces apoptosis by PARP cleavage through activation of caspase-3. (A) DU145 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were incubated with\nthe indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and 20 \u00b5g of the whole-cell lysate was resolved by SDS-\nPAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, sliced from the membrane based on the molecular weight, and then probed with antibodies\nagainst p53 and p21 as described in \"Materials and Methods.\" The same blots were stripped and reprobed with -actin antibody to verify equal\nprotein loading. The results shown here are representative of 3 independent experiments. (B) After DU145 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were seeded\nonto 6-well plates, they were treated with various indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Thereafter, equal amounts of lysates were\nanalyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against caspase-3 and PARP. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with -actin antibody\nto verify equal protein loading. (C) MEF cells were transiently transfected with pMXs-STAT3C or pMXs-gw (control vector) plasmid. STAT3C\nprotein was overexpressed in pMXs-STAT3C tranfected MEF cells compared to control. Transiently transfected cells were treated with indicated\nconcentrations of SEYG for 6 hours. Then, equal amounts of lysate were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against phospho-\nSTAT3 (Tyr705) and STAT3. (D) MEF cells were transiently transfected with pMXs-STAT3C or pMXs-gw (control vector) plasmid. STAT3C\nprotein was overexpressed in pMXs-STAT3C tranfected MEF cells compared to control. Transiently transfected cells were treated with indicated\nconcentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Equal amounts of lysate were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibody against cyclin D1 and PARP.\nThe same blots were stripped and reprobed with -actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. The results shown here are representative of\n3 independent experiments. (E) After DU145 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/well) were seeded onto 6-well plates, they were incubated with the indicated\nconcentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Then, the cells were fixed and analyzed using flow cytometry. The results shown here are representative\nof 3 independent experiments. (F) Cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SEYG for 24 hours. Thereafter, they were incubated\nwith anti-annexin V antibody conjugated with FITC plus PI and analyzed with a flow cytometer for apoptotic effects. The results shown here are\nrepresentative of 3 independent experiments. (G) Cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SEYG and caspase-3 inhibitor for 24 hours.\nThereafter, they were incubated with anti-annexin V antibody conjugated with FITC plus PI and analyzed with a flow cytometer for apoptotic\neffects. The results shown here are representative of 3 independent experiments. (H) Cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SEYG\nfor 24 hours. Cells were fixed, stained with TUNEL assay reagent, and then analyzed with a flow cytometer.\noverexpression of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) as compared\nwith those transfected with only control plasmid, and the\noverexpression of STAT3 was clearly inhibited by SEYG\ntreatment in MEF cells (Figure 4C).As shown in Figure 4D,\noverexpression of STAT3 led to the attenuation of SEYG-\nmediated suppression of cyclin D1 and cleavage of PARP as\ncompared to the control, indicating that STAT3 is one of the\nmajor molecular targets involved in SEYG-induced\napoptosis.\nSEYG Causes the Accumulation of the Cells in\nthe Sub-G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle\nWe set out to determine the effect of SEYG on cell cycle\nphase distribution. After treatment for 24 hours, SEYG\ninduced an increased accumulation of 15% of the cell popu-\nlation in the sub-G1 phase, which is indicative of apoptosis\n(Figure 4E).\nSEYG Induces Substantial Apoptosis\nWe also examined the apoptosis-inducing effects of SEYG\nby using the annexin V assay, which detects phosphatidyl-\nserine externalization (Figure 4F). When we further exam-\nined for late apoptosis by analyzing DNA strand breaks\nusing the TUNEL assay, apoptotic cells were also signifi-\ncantly increased on SEYG treatment as observed by flow\ncytometric analysis (Figure 4H).\nSpecific Blockade of Caspase-3 Activation\nAbrogates SEYG-Induced Apoptosis\nTo determine whether a specific caspase-3 inhibitor blocks\nSEYG-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells, annexin V assay\nwas performed. We found that the SEYG-induced apoptosis\nwas suppressed by the caspase-3 inhibitor, indicating the\nsignificance of caspase-3 activation for SEYG-induced\nSEYG Induces Antitumor Effects in a Xenograft\nProstate Tumor Model in Nude Mice\nWe examined the therapeutic potential of SEYG on the\ngrowth of subcutaneously implanted human prostate cancer\ncells in nude mice. The experimental protocol is depicted in\nFigure 5A. DU145 cells were implanted subcutaneously in\nthe right flank of nude mice. When tumors had reached 0.25\ncm in diameter after a week, the mice were randomized into\n3 groups and we started the treatment as per the experimental\nprotocol. The tumor diameters were measured at 5-day inter-\nvals. The treatment was continued for 4 weeks and animals\nwere sacrificed after 5 weeks. The tumors were excised and\nthe tumor diameters were measured. We found that the tumor\nvolume increased rapidly in the control group compared with\nthe other treatment groups (Figure 5B). We found that SEYG\nwhen given at 200 mg/kg body weight considerably inhibited\nthe growth of the tumor at day 25 after treatment (P < .01\nwhen compared to control; Figure 5C and D). Furthermore,\nthe lowest mean tumor weight was found with SEYG when\ngiven at 200 mg/kg body weight (Figure 5E).\nSEYG Inhibits Ki-67 and CD31 Expression and\nIncreases Levels of Cleaved Form of Caspase-3\nExpression\nWhile Ki-67-positive index is used as a marker for cell pro-\nliferation, the CD31 index is a marker for microvessel den-\nsity. Whether SEYG modulate these markers was examined.\nFigure 6A shows that SEYG significantly downregulated\nthe expression of Ki-67 in prostate cancer DU145 tissue\n(***P < .001 vs vehicle). Similarly, when examined for\nCD31, we found that SEYG significantly reduced the CD31\nexpression as compared to control group (Figure 6B; **\nP < .01 vs vehicle). Cleaved form of caspase-3 was signifi-\ncantly increased in the SEYG-treated group as compared\nwith the control group (Figure 6C; ***P < .001 vs\nvehicle).\nSEYG Inhibits Phosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1,\nJAK2, and Src in Prostate Tumor Tissues\nWe also evaluated the effect of SEYG on phosphorylation\nlevel of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src in prostate tumor tis-\nsues. Figure 6D shows that SEYG was substantially effec-\ntive in suppressing the expression of p-STAT3, p-JAK1,\np-JAK2, and p-Src at 200 mg/kg. SEYG had no effect on\nthe expression of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src proteins in\ntumor tissues.\nSEYG Downregulates Expression of Various\nProteins Involved in Antiapoptosis, Proliferation,\nand Angiogenesis in Prostate Tumor Tissues\nWe next examined whether SEYG can modulate the consti-\ntutive expression of antiapoptotic proteins in tumor tissues,\nas examined by Western blot analysis. We found that SEYG\nsuppressed the expression of bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1,\nand IAP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6E). Also,\nSEYG repressed proteins linked with cell proliferation\n(COX-2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and MMP-9) and angiogene-\nsis (COX-2, MMP-9, and VEGF; Figure 6F).\nSEYG Induces the Expression of Both p53 and\np21 in Tumor Tissues\nTo determine whether SEYG induces expression of p53 and\np21, we examined the expression of these proteins in\nFigure 5. Effects of SEYG in human prostate cancer cells growth in nude mice induced by DU145. (A) Schematic representation\nof experimental protocol described in \"Materials and Methods.\" DU145 cells (4 \u00d7 106 cells/mice) were injected subcutaneously\ninto the right flank of the mice. The animals were randomized after 1 week of tumor cell injection into 3 groups based on tumor\nvolume. Group I was given PBS (200 \u00b5L, ip thrice/week), group II was given SEYG (50 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week), and group\nIII was given SEYG (200 mg/kg body weight, ip thrice/week).

(E-G) Equal amounts of lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against\nbcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, IAP-2, COX-2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, VEGF, MMP-9, p53, and p21. -Actin was used as a loading control.

Figure\n6G shows that SEYG induced the expression of both p53\nand p21 gene products in a dose-dependent manner.\nCompositional Analysis of SEYG by GC-MS\nThe extract of yeagam peel was prepared by supercritical\nextraction method and analyzed by GC/MS. The com-\npounds were identified and listed in Tables 1 and 2. Sixty-\nfour compounds belonging to chemical classes of carboxylic\nacid (3), alcohol (12), aldehyde (8), ester (10), hydrocarbon\n(23), ketone (1), and miscellaneous (8) were tentatively\nidentified from the SEYG. Hydrocarbon was the chemical\nclass with the highest proportion, 34.77%. The major hydro-\ncarbon compound was limonene (21.87%). Similarly, esters\ncontaining 13.38% were characterized as second major\nchemical group. Esters of fatty acids were domenent, espe-\ndetected as a major esterified compound. Monoterpenoidal\nmajor among the alcohol compounds. On the basis of the\naforementioned results, it is concluded that limonene was\nthe prime component in SEYG, and major compounds\nranged in content order as follows: linalool, geranyl acetate,\n-terpineol, -farnesene, p-cymene, and so on. Next, we\nquantitatively analyzed the 3 major active compounds in\nthe same extract. The content of limonene, linalool, and\nmL, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the present study was evaluation of the anti-\ncancer activity of SEYG through the blockage of the STAT3\nsignaling pathway in both in vitro and in vivo. We found\nthat this extract suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation at\ntion of JAK1, JAK2, and c-Src activation. SEYG downreg-\nulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products,\nsuch as bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, IAP-2, cyclin D1,\nCOX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9. It also caused the inhibition of\nproliferation and induced substantial apoptosis in DU145\ncells. We further investigated the potential therapeutic effi-\ncacy of SEYG in an in vivo model of human prostate carci-\nnoma in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of SEYG in a\nxenograft mouse model of DU145 cells resulted in a signifi-\ncant suppression of tumor progression, inhibition of STAT3\nsignaling pathway, and downregulation of various STAT3-\nregulated gene products in SEYG-treated tumor tissues.\nOur data clearly indicate that SEYG mediates its suppres-\nsive effects on the STAT3 activation cascade in human pros-\ntate tumor cells.\nThis is the first report to evaluate the potential effects\nof SEYG on STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells\nand a xenograft mouse model. Whether examined by\nSTAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705, by nuclear trans-\nlocation, or by DNA binding, we found that SEYG sup-\npressed STAT3 activation. How SEYG inhibits activation\nof STAT3 was also investigated in detail. The activation\nof JAK has been closely linked with STAT3 activation,20\nand we observed that SEYG inhibited the activation of\nconstitutively active JAK1 and JAK2 in DU145 cells.\nThis is in agreement with a report that AZD1480, a spe-\ncific JAK2 blocker, can suppress the growth of human\nsolid tumors through suppression of STAT3-dependent\nWe further found that SEYG suppressed the expression\nof several STAT3-regulated genes, including antiapoptotic\ngene products (bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2),\nproliferative (cyclin D1and cyclin E), angiogenic (COX-2\nand VEGF), and metastatic (MMP-9) gene products. The\ndownregulation of cyclin D1and cyclin E expression corre-\nlated with suppression in proliferation as observed in\nDU145 cells. Bcl-2 and bcl-xL can also block cell death\ninduced by a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, and thus\ncontribute to chemoresistance.38 In addition, activation of\nSTAT3 signaling can induce survivin gene expression and\nconfers resistance to apoptosis in breast cancer cells.39\nThus, the downregulation of the expression of bcl-2, bcl-\nxL, and survivin is likely to be linked with SEYG's ability\nto induce apoptosis in DU145 cells. The downmodulation\nof VEGF, COX-2, and MMP-9 expression by SEYG also\nemphasized the antiangiogenic and antimetastatic potential\nof SEYG in the cells, an aspect that will be investigated in\ndetail in the future.\nWe also observed that SEYG significantly suppressed\nhuman prostate carcinoma growth in a xenograft mouse\nmodel as well as downregulated the expression of Ki67 and\nCD31 and increased the levels of cleaved form of caspase-3\nin the treated group as compared with control. Besides,\nSEYG suppressed STAT3 signaling pathway and a variety\nof STAT3-regulated gene products from tissues in a xeno-\ngraft prostate tumor model. Treatment with SEYG (50 mg/\nkg body weight) did not appear to substantially inhibit the\nphosphorylation of STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and Src. However,\nthe volume of tumors in this group is decreased compared\nwith control group. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,\nno prior studies with SEYG have been reported in a xeno-\ngraft prostate tumor model in nude mice, and our observa-\ntions clearly indicate that SEYG has a clear potential for the\ntreatment of human prostate carcinoma through the sup-\npression of the STAT3 signaling cascade.\nOur in vitro and in vivo experimental findings clearly\nindicate that the anticancer effects of SEYG in human pros-\ntate carcinoma are mediated through the suppression of the\nSTAT3 signaling pathway and provide a strong rationale for\npursuing the use of SEYG to enhance treatment efficacy in\nprostate cancer patients.\nTable 1.
