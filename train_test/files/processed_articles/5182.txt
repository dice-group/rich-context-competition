The 46 items\nof the irrational subscales are the focus of attention as the\npossibility of abbreviating this large section of the GABS,\nwithout loss of information, could increase the convenience\nof use in clinical settings. Also, as shown in the following\nreview, the irrational statements in beliefs inventories gener-\nally show greater discriminant validity than rational state-\nments in differentiating nonclinical from clinical samples.\nEvaluating the GABS using IRT methods (Baker, 2001;\ntest items are the most discriminating and informative, can\nassess the utility of the Likert-type scale response format for\neach item, and can scale critical test items for the level of\nirrationality they represent. There has been no clear consen-\nsus among clinicians or researchers about the hierarchical\nstructure of irrational beliefs (DiGiuseppe, 1996), and dis-\nagreement persists (David, Lynn, & Ellis, 2010). Identifying\nand scaling the most psychometrically sound items in the\nGABS could be constructive in revealing the irrationality\nlevels of specific unhelpful beliefs and in focusing the assess-\nment process.\nPrevious research on various measures of irrational beliefs\nsuggests that some irrational content areas are more valid\nthan others in discriminating clinical from general popula-\ntion samples. For example, on the Common Beliefs Survey\n(Bessai & Lane, 1976), psychiatric inpatients showed sig-\nnificantly higher scores than hospital staff members and stu-\ndents on a self-downing subscale, and inpatients had\nsignificantly higher scores than mental health outpatients\nand the nonclinical samples on perfectionism, whereas there\nwere no differences between these samples on such other\nscales as need for approval or blame-proneness (Thorpe,\nParker, & Barnes, 1992). On another inventory, a subscale on\nrational thoughts or self-statements did not differentiate cli-\nents from students, whereas significant group differences\nwere seen in subscales on irrational thought content (Thorpe,\nBarnes, Hunter, & Hines, 1983). On the GABS, maritally\ndistressed couples scored higher on Self-Downing and Need\nfor Comfort than nondistressed couples, and distressed cou-\nples receiving counseling also had higher scores on Need for\nApproval than those not receiving counseling (Addis &\nSuch findings do not directly address the possibility that,\nindependent of the sample under study, some beliefs may be\nmore irrational than others--in the sense that making global\nratings of oneself and others, for example, may indicate a\nmore extreme position on the implied general trait of irratio-\nnality than, say, unrealistic demands for fairness.\nProcesses and Themes in Assessing Irrational\nBeliefs\nEssential to contemporary REBT theory is a set of four eval-\nuative irrational beliefs: \"demands, awfulizing, low frustra-\ntion tolerance, and global evaluations of human worth\"\nwhich are assessed by items (though not necessarily sub-\nscales) in the GABS. There is disagreement on their relative\nimportance (O'Kelly, Joyce, & Greaves, 1998). The primacy\nof demandingness (thinking in terms of \"shoulds,\" \"oughts,\"\nand \"musts\") was cited in many early writings, but factor\nanalytic research on the original GABS items failed to sup-\nthere are conceptual and measurement difficulties\ntration tolerance and self-downing have emerged as more\nfundamental constructs. Improvements on ratings of those\nconstructs following parent education interventions were\nassociated with beneficial change on emotional measures\n(O'Kelly et al., 1998), and in psychometric research on the\nGABS, self-downing was the only evaluative belief category\nto appear as a distinct single factor (DiGiuseppe et al., 1988).\nDavies (2008) has reported that the GABS subscales Self-\nDowning, Need for Achievement, and Need for Approval are\nall strongly and negatively correlated with unconditional\nself-acceptance.\nDavies (2008) has noted that the GABS takes account of\nthe four evaluative beliefs or irrational thinking processes\n(demandingness, awfulizing, low frustration tolerance, and\nself-downing) as well as the four content domains or themes\n(needs for achievement, approval, and comfort, and demands\nfor fairness). Arguing that each irrational belief includes\nboth a process and a theme, he pointed out that such combi-\nnations are represented in all 46 irrational GABS items. For\nexample, GABS Item 35 (\"It's awful to have hassles in one's\nlife and it is a catastrophe to be hassled\") combines the\nawfulizing process with the Need for Comfort theme or con-\ntent area. Davies concluded that it is difficult at the present\nstate of knowledge to separate processes from themes in\nOwings et al. 3\nirrational beliefs inventories. Accordingly, the focus of this\nstudy is on representative items drawn from the irrational\nsubscales of the GABS, each item representing a process/\ntheme combination.\nIn this study of the GABS, the most representative items\nfrom each of the irrational subscales as identified by Bernard\n(1998), and from each of the processes and themes noted by\nDavies (2008), were evaluated for their position on the broad\nscale of irrationality in a convenience sample of student\nrespondents. The study was approved by the Protection of\nHuman Subjects Review Board at the University of Maine.\nMethod\nParticipants\nfemale, 148 male, and 3 who did not indicate their gender)\ntaking courses in general psychology. They received course\ncredit for their participation. The mean age of the sample was\nMaterials\nistered. The GABS consists of seven subscales: Rationality\n(9 items), Self-Downing (9 items), Need for Achievement (9\nitems), Need for Approval (7 items), Need for Comfort (9\nitems), Demands for Fairness (9 items), and Other-Downing\n(3 items). Respondents rate each item on a 5-point Likert-\ntype scale to indicate level of agreement (1 = strongly dis-\nagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly\nagree). Agreement signals rationality for the 9 items of the\nRationality scale and irrationality for the 46 items of the\nother six scales, which taken together form a Total\nIrrationality scale. Additional questionnaires that were not\nthe focus of this article were administered to some of the\nrespondents together with the GABS.\nIRT Methodology\nThe research protocol called for the use of IRT programs\nsuitable for analyzing data from Likert-type scales (Ostini &\nNering, 2006). Data were analyzed using the Graded\nResponse Models (GRM) in MULTILOG 7 (Thissen, Chen,\nModels in IRT for analyzing dichotomous data (e.g., with\n\"true or false,\" \"agree or disagree\" response options) include\nthe two-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model, which estimates\nitem discrimination (designated by a) and item location or\ndifficulty (designated by b) parameters for each item within\nMULTILOG estimates each test respondent's trait level, des-\nignated as , from performance on all test items, then pro-\ngresses through an iterative process in which the trait levels\nof respondents and the item parameters are estimated pro-\ngressively more precisely. Items with poor discrimination\n(those that do not effectively differentiate respondents with\nhigher vs. lower trait levels) are automatically given low\nweightings in estimating respondents' values (Baker, 2001;\nMULTILOG and similar programs produce item charac-\nteristic curves (ICCs) to depict the functioning of each\ntest item with respondents with varying levels of . In\nMULTILOG, the x-axis of the ICC indicates increasing lev-\nels of  from left to right on an arbitrary z-score metric\ncates the probability of a response to the item in the desig-\nnated direction (e.g., a correct response to an item assessing\nfactual knowledge or agreement on an attitude survey\nitem). The trace line of the graph, modeled from an S-shaped\nlogistic function or growth curve, indicates the probabili-\nties with which respondents with varying trait levels will\nendorse the correct response (or the response signifying\nagreement). The difficulty level of an item is arbitrarily set\nas the point on the x-axis at which the trace line crosses the\n.5 probability value on the y-axis. Item information is\ninversely related to the standard error of measurement; in\npractice, highly discriminating items show high values for\ninformation. This methodology is described in detail in\nFigure 1 presents the ICC and Figure 2 the item informa-\ntion curve as generated by the MULTILOG 2PL model pro-\ngram for Item 37 of the GABS: \"It is frustrating to be hassled\nbut I can stand the frustration of being hassled.\" This is Item\nb\nAbility\nProbability\nItem Characteristic Curve: 7\nFigure 1.

As this is an \"easy\" item, respon-\ndents do not have to show a very high level of rationality to\nregister agreement.\nResults\nOriginal Irrational Subscales\nRespondents' scores on the 46 items of the six irrational sub-\nscales of the GABS were evaluated via the methodologies of\nclassical and modern test theory. In classical test theory,\nobtaining high values for internal consistency in the items\nwithin each subscale could help to justify selecting a single\nitem to represent each subscale. In IRT, establishing the uni-\ndimensionality of the subscales is important; \"a scale is uni-\ndimensional when a single latent trait accounts for all the\ncommon variance among item responses\" (Morizot,\nsional enough\" (M. Linacre, personal communication, June\n4, 2011). Suitable methods for assessing unidimensionality\ninclude conducting an exploratory factor analysis (e.g., Funk\n& Rogge, 2007) and inspecting factors'eigenvalues, the ratio\nof the eigenvalue of the first factor to the second and subse-\nquent factors, and the \"knee\" in scree slopes (Ruscio &\nanalysis to examine patterns of covariation among responses,\nand if multidimensionality is found, then each factor can be\nused as a unique scale if doing so would be consistent with\nthe overall theoretical approach\" (p. 214).\nUsing these methods, identifying the most representative\nitem within each GABS subscale would allow further analy-\nsis of those six items so as to reveal the relative levels of\nirrationality that they represent.\nInternal Consistency Analyses. Table 1 presents the results of\ninternal consistency analyses for each of the GABS sub-\nscales. For the following subscales, none of the constituent\nitems, if deleted, would have resulted in an increase in the\nvalue obtained for Cronbach's alpha as shown in Table 1:\nSelf-Downing, Need for Achievement, Need for Approval,\nNeed for Comfort, and Demands for Fairness. For the three-\nitem Other-Downing subscale, deleting GABS Item 18\nwould have increased the value marginally from  = .70 to\n = .71 (this relatively low value for alpha is directly attrib-\nutable to the small number of items in this subscale).\nThe generally high degree of internal consistency shown\nby the items within each subscale provided justification for\nselecting the most representative item from each subscale for\nfurther analysis.\nComparison of Subscale Scores Across Studies. Table 2 presents\nthe mean scores per item in our sample for each of the six\nirrational subscales of the GABS. Also included in Table 2\nare the corresponding data from four previous studies from\nAustralia and the United Kingdom published from 1992 to\n2008. The degree of concordance in the ordinal rankings of\nthe six subscale scores in these five studies was high (Kend-\nshowed perfect concordance in ranking the mean subscale\nitem scores for Demands for Fairness, Need for Achieve-\nment, Need for Approval, and Self-Downing in that order\nfrom highest to lowest.\nScale Score\nInformation\nItem Information Curve: 7\nFigure 2.

The irrational subscales were\nsubjected to separate exploratory factor analyses (principal\ncomponents analyses) to assess the degree of unidimension-\nality. Self-Downing produced two factors, the first including\nseven items and the second the remaining two. Need for\nAchievement produced two factors, with six items in the first\nand three in the second. The remaining four subscales--\nNeed for Approval, Need for Comfort, Demands for Fair-\nness, and Other-Downing--each produced a single factor\n(only one component was extracted).\nThe GABS irrational subscales were evaluated separately\nusing the GRM in MULTILOG. The GRM is very similar to\nthe 2PL model, but it is a polytomous model that can accom-\nmodate the five Likert-type scale response options for each\ntest item. The ICCs from the GRM program provide a trace\nline for each response option, as in Figure 3 (GABS Item 48,\nfrom an analysis of a very brief test consisting of six items:\neach subscale, listed in order of increasing difficulty). For\neach item, the printed output provides a value for slope (a,\nequivalent to discrimination in the 2PL model) and four val-\nues for location (b1, b2, b3, and b4), the thresholds between\nthe five response options. Item information in the GRM\nmodel is calculated from the value of the slope parameter\n\"and the spread of the category thresholds\" (Embretson &\nare given with steeper slopes and when the between-category\nthreshold parameters for an item are distributed fairly evenly.\nWithin each subscale, the item with the highest value for\ninformation was selected. The resulting six items form a very\nbrief scale for further study. A principal components analysis\nof that scale led to only one factor being extracted. Table 3\npresents the values for the slope and threshold parameters for\nthe six items selected to represent the subscales.

Item 46 has the lowest value and is located at\napproximately the midpoint of the x-axis on an ICC; this\nitem therefore functions among respondents with medium\ntrait levels for irrationality. Item 44 has the highest value and\nis located toward the right on the x-axis; this item functions\namong the respondents with the highest trait levels for irra-\ntionality. The intervening four items have broadly similar\nvalues for location and are most helpful in assessing respon-\ndents with moderate trait levels. In the student respondents,\nonly those with the highest levels of irrationality endorsed a\nSelf-Downing item. However, even those with the lowest\ntrait levels often agreed with a Demands for Fairness item.\nTable 2.

From left to right the\nfive curves represent the trace lines for the five response options: 1 =\nstrongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neutral; 4 = agree; and 5 = strongly agree.\n6 SAGE Open\nProcesses and Themes\ntrated how particular GABS items could each be placed at\nthe intersection of one of the four irrational processes and\none of the four themes. Extending this matrix, we divided all\n46 irrational items of the GABS into scales representing\neither the irrational processes or the irrational themes. We\nadded the 3 items from the Other-Downing subscale to the 9\nSelf-Downing items to create a \"global rating\" scale of 12\nitems. Because the 3 Other-Downing items all combined the\nelements of (a) damning other people because they (b) treat\none unfairly, these items were also added to the Demands for\nFairness subscale to create a 12-item theme \"fairness.\"\nTreating other items similarly led to two separate divisions\nof the 46 irrational items in the GABS. One of these divided\nthe 46 items into four processes (demandingness, 12 items;\nglobal rating, 12 items; low frustration tolerance, 12 items;\nand awfulizing, 10 items), and the other divided the items\ninto four themes (achievement, 12 items; approval, 10 items;\ncomfort, 12 items; and fairness, 12 items).\nTwo raters, both advanced undergraduate research assis-\ntants earning course credit, independently assigned each of\nthe 46 irrational GABS items to one of the four processes and\nto one of the four themes, and their agreement was assessed\nby kappa coefficients (processes:  = .942; themes:  = .884).\nThose kappa values represent \"almost perfect agreement\"\nInternal Consistency Analyses.Table 4 indicates the mean\nscore per item (with standard deviation) in each of the new\nscales, and the internal consistency values for each scale. It\ncan be seen that the values for coefficient  are uniformly\nAnalyses Using IRT Methodology.Table 5 provides parameter\nvalues from MULTILOG and PARSCALE for the most\ninformative items from the scales representing each process\nand each theme. The values for slope are all very high, indi-\ncating that these items are extremely informative.\nDiscussion\nCompleting the 55 items of the GABS by rating each of them\non a 5-point Likert-type scale is demanding of respondents'\ntime and effort, and this concern may be particularly perti-\nnent in a clinical setting. Distilling the instrument into its\nmost informative items, as indicated above, could save\nexaminees' time without loss of essential information. But\nthere are other compelling reasons for examining the GABS\nscales item by item. A concern arising from classical test\ntheory methods is that items within a scale are treated as if\nTable 3. The Most Informative GABS Items Representing the Six Irrational Subscales: Slope (a) and Between-Category Thresholds (b1,\nb2, b3, b4) from MULTILOG, and Location from PARSCALE.\n46. It is unbearable to not have respect from people, and\nI can't stand their disrespect (Demands for Fairness)\n35. It's awful to have hassles in one's life and it is a\ncatastrophe to be hassled (Need for Comfort)\n48. I must be liked and accepted by people I want to like\nme, and I will not accept their not liking me (Need for\nApproval)\n30. I believe that if a person treats me very unfairly, they\nare bad and worthless (Other-Downing)\n45. If I do not perform well at things which are important,\nit will be a catastrophe (Need for Achievement)\n44. When I experience hassles and my life is unpleasant, I\nbelieve I am a worthless person because I have hassles\nor an unpleasant life (Self-Downing)\nNote: GABS = General Attitude and Belief Scale.\nThe values for slope, category thresholds, and location in this table were estimated from participants' responses to a very brief test consisting of the six\nitems listed.\nTable 4. Mean Scores per Item, Standard Deviations, and\nCoefficient Alpha Values on the Four Irrational Processes Scales\nand the Four Irrational Themes Scales (n = 486).\nSubscale M SD Coefficient \nProcesses\nThemes\nOwings et al. 7\nthey were interchangeable. For example, scoring the GABS\nSelf-Downing subscale in the traditional way involves aggre-\ngating a respondent's scores from each of the 9 items as if\neach has equal weighting, typically an untested assumption\nin respect of both the item itself and the Likert-type scale of\nmeasurement (Bond & Fox, 2007). There is only one way of\nattaining the lowest possible score on the subscale (endors-\ning \"strongly disagree,\" or 1, for each item), and only one\nway of obtaining the highest score (recording \"strongly\nagree,\" or 5, for each item). But total scores intermediate\nbetween 9 and 45 can be arrived at in many different ways.\nThe number of possible response patterns on a 9-item sub-\nscale, each item rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, is 59, or\nIn fact, the GABS subscales all show high internal consis-\ntency, indicating that respondents are unlikely to produce a\nvery wide range of the possible response patterns. Yet\nrespondents with the same Self-Downing score (for exam-\nple) could show many different patterns of specific item\nendorsements, and thus could have varying perspectives on\nself-criticism and self-abasement. Selecting and scaling the\nmost informative items with IRT methodology and present-\ning only such items to respondents can guarantee that similar\nscores represent similar item endorsements.\nThe data from the six irrational subscales of the GABS in\nour study were highly consistent with those from four other\nstudent samples responding to the GABS in Australia and the\nUnited Kingdom (Table 2). The overall concordance of the\nrankings of the six mean subscale item scores across the five\nstudies was very high; all studies produced the same rank-\nings for Demands for Fairness, Need for Achievement, Need\nfor Approval, and Self-Downing. Thus, nonclinical samples\nproduce an impressive degree of consistency in displaying a\nshared ordering of GABS irrational subscale scores.\nThe IRT analyses of the data from this study produced\nresults consistent with the rankings of subscale scores, but\nplaced the items on a more secure psychometric foundation\nand a more dependable metric (Bond & Fox, 2007; Dumenci\n& Achenbach, 2008). Each subscale showed satisfactory\nunidimensionality, as determined by the exploratory factor\nanalyses--the results of which are consistent with the factor\nstructure of the GABS as identified by its originators and\ndevelopers. The PARSCALE GRM estimates for item loca-\ntion are well grounded in that difficulty levels are drawn\nfrom all five response options in each item. Polytomous\nitems provide \"more information over a wider range of the\ntrait continuum than . . . dichotomous items\" (Ostini &\nThe most informative items from each of the irrational\nsubscales of the GABS form a unidimensional six-item scale\nsuitable for further study with respondents in clinical set-\ntings.

Many\nrespondents will endorse an item from the Demands for\nFairness subscale, but only those with high levels of irratio-\nnality agree with a Self-Downing item. Consistent with that,\nTable 1 reveals that respondents show low mean subtest\nscores for Self-Downing and high mean subtest scores for\nDemands for Fairness. The location values for the processes\nand themes indicate that the low frustration tolerance item is\nlowest for irrationality among the processes, whereas the\nglobal rating item is highest. Among the themes, achieve-\nment is lowest and comfort is highest for irrationality. This\nsignifies that respondents with relatively low trait levels for\nirrationality may readily agree with items revealing low frus-\ntration tolerance and concerns about achievement. Only\nrespondents with the highest trait levels for irrationality\nendorse items reflecting global ratings of worth and extreme\npreoccupations with comfort.\nThe MULTILOG and PARSCALE analyses were also\nhelpful in indicating items for which the five response\noptions on the Likert-type scale were all operating optimally.\nFor example, the ICCs for Item 48 in Figure 3 reveal that the\ntransitions between all five response options are clear and\ninformative; most respondents chose options 1, 2, or 3, and\nonly those with the highest trait levels for irrationality chose\noptions 4 or 5 to register \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" with\nthis irrational item. Table 3 shows that some items produced\nhigh values exceeding +3.00 for response option 5 (strongly\nagree), especially Item 30. Future work on the GABS could\nfocus on the utility of the five-item Likert-type scale for all\nitems. For example, possibly options 4 and 5 in Item 30\ncould be collapsed into a single category for agreement with-\nout loss of information.\nConsistent with the results of other recent studies, Self-\nDowning emerged as the most irrational of the six original\nirrational beliefs scales measured by the GABS in our stu-\ndent sample. Among the irrational appraisal mechanisms,\ndemandingness is viewed as primary while awfulizing, low\nfrustration tolerance, and self-downing are regarded as sec-\nondary; and demandingness and self-downing are seen as\nschemata, whereas awfulizing and low frustration tolerance\nare cast as propositional networks (David & Lynn, 2010).\nThus self-downing, linked with a pattern of evaluating\nhuman worth in global terms, is given prominence both as an\nirrational secondary appraisal mechanism and as a schema.\nDemandingness has been associated with several clinical\nconditions, including anger, depressed mood, and anxiety;\nself-downing is correlated with depressed mood. Further\nresearch on the irrational beliefs assessed by the GABS\ncould help identify with greater precision and clarity the\nspecific patterns associated with particular disorders com-\nmonly presented in outpatient mental health settings (David\nLimitations\nBecause REBT is applied in clinical settings, our use of a\nstudent sample in this research may be questioned as limiting\nthe generality of our findings to clients and patients. Further\nresearch with clinical populations is indicated before we can\nrecommend an abbreviated form of the GABS for profes-\nsional use.\nIn general terms, there is no impediment to using data\nfrom respondents with low trait levels for irrationality to\ninform test development and refinement because of the\npredicted group invariance in the item parameter esti-\nmates produced by modern test theory methodology\n(Baker, 2001). In IRT, estimates of item characteristics\nhold true regardless of the \"abilities\" of the group being\ntested; a group of respondents with low trait levels will\nproduce the same ICCs as a group with high trait levels. In\nother words, \"the item parameters are not dependent upon\nthe ability level of the examinees responding to the item\"\ndents differ only in the degree to which they endorse irra-\ntional beliefs, then generalization from students to patients\ncan be justified. However, that assumption will have to be\ntested empirically in prospective research with clinical\nsamples.\nOne hypothesis for future research is that clients or\npatients may be less preoccupied than the student respon-\ndents were with irrational beliefs about the importance of\nbeing treated fairly by others (e.g., demanding that others\nmust treat one fairly) and personal achievement (e.g., see-\ning achievement as a dire necessity rather than a strong\npreference). The Demands for Fairness and Need for\nAchievement subscales were the \"easiest\" in terms of irra-\ntionality in our study; in other words, students who were\npractically at the median for irrationality were still likely\nenough to endorse irrational items from those subscales.\nThe Self-Downing items, by contrast, produced relatively\nfew endorsements from our sample but a prediction is that\npeople receiving mental health services may be far more\nlikely to agree with such items. The results of future\nresearch on the GABS with clinical samples will no doubt\nimprove assessment practices and advance the further\ndevelopment of REBT interventions.\nAuthors' Notes\nPortions of this paper were presented by Dr. Owings at the 115th.\nConvention of the American Psychological Association, San\nFrancisco, August, 2007, and at the 41st.
