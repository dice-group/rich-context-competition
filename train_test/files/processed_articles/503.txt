These same states exhibited high rates of undetermined death\nand, more specifically, high rates of undetermined poisoning deaths. Further, these three states evidenced\ncorrespondingly lower rates of unintentional poisonings. The types of undetermined poisonings present in\nthese states, but not present in other states, are typically the result of a combination of recreational drugs,\nalcohol, or prescription drugs.\nConclusions: The differing classification among states of many poisoning deaths has implications for the\nanalysis of undetermined deaths within the NVDRS and for the examination of possible/probable suicides\ncontained within the undetermined- or accidental-intent classifications. The NVDRS does not collect\ninformation on unintentional poisonings, so in most states data are not collected on these possible/\nprobable suicides. The authors believe this is an opportunity missed to understand the full range of self-\nharm deaths in the greater detail provided by the NVDRS system. They advocate a broader interpretation\nof suicide to include the full continuum of deaths resulting from self-harm.\nMuch of the difficulty in conceptualizing and measur-\ning violent death lies in the implicit nature of\nintentionality, particularly for suicide. Perhaps stem-\nming from this difficulty, a number of studies have\nconcluded that suicides are underreported because of the\nmisallocation of suicide verdicts to other manners of death,\nsuch as the ``accidental'' or undetermined classifications.1\u00ad6\nSome have argued that the standard of proof (that is,\ntypically ``beyond a reasonable doubt'') used by coroners/\nmedical examiners (C/ME) for legal reasons is a standard\nthat is artificially high for public health purposes, and may\nresult in the systematic exclusion of particular types of\nsuicides.4 7 The difficulty of ascertaining a decedent's intent,\ncombined with the legally defined burden of proof, likely\nrestricts the full range of deaths due to self-harm from\ninclusion in violent death surveillance systems.\nWhen intent cannot be established at the legally defined\nlevel, many possible or probable suicides are classified as\nundetermined in nature.1\u00ad4 7 8 General guidelines issued by\nthe National Association of Medical Examiners state that the\nundetermined manner-of-death classification is to be used\n``when the information pointing to one manner of death is no\nmore compelling than one or more other competing manners\nof death in thorough consideration of all available informa-\nDespite deaths of undetermined intent comprising a rela-\ntively small percentage of injury deaths, disaggregating these\ndata reveals troubling patterns and cause for concern.\nOf particular concern, the misclassification of suicides and\nhomicides as deaths of undetermined intent results in\nunderreporting of official suicide and homicide rates for\ncertain demographic subgroups.8 11\u00ad14 Further complicating\nmatters, certain elements of a violent death may system-\natically influence whether a death is classified as undeter-\nmined in nature. These factors include: the mechanism of\ndeath,1 5\u00ad7 15 whether the decedent left explicit or circum-\nstantial evidence of intention,1 7 16 the quantity and quality of\ninformation available to the C/ME making the determina-\ntion,14 17 and differing criteria among C/MEs about the\nclassification of certain types of deaths.18 While some of\nthese factors are indicative of intentionality, each is\nindependent of the decedent's true intentions and may result\nin a skewed picture of violent deaths.\nLikely related to several of the aforementioned factors,\nconsiderable variability exists across both states and coun-\ntries in terms of the frequency and rates of deaths of\nundetermined intent.10 19 In many states, the undetermined\ncategory is used infrequently. In others, it represents a large\nproportion of violent deaths. As a cause of death, poisoning\naccounts for an increasingly large proportion of injury deaths\nthe percentage of undetermined injury deaths due to\nthe undetermined-intent poisoning deaths in 2002 were due\nto narcotics and hallucinogens.10 Here, we suggest that\ndifficulty in judging intentionality, coupled with differing\nC/ME philosophies on classifying manner of death, are\nlargely responsible for variations among jurisdictions, parti-\ncularly in cases of self-inflicted drug overdose (poisoning)\ndeaths.\nAbbreviations: NVDRS, National Violent Death Reporting System;\nWISQARS, Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System;\nC/ME, coroner/medical examiner.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nIn addition to reviewing state-level variation in rates of\nmanner-undetermined deaths, this research extends knowl-\nedge based on death certificates alone by taking advantage of\nadded details on violent death investigations that are\navailable from states participating in the US National\nViolent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS links\ndata from C/MEs, police reports, death certificates, and like\nsources to produce a more detailed record of the character-\nistics and circumstances surrounding violent deaths, includ-\ning those of undetermined manner or intent. We suspect, as\nhave others, that variations across time and place in the\namount and quality of information available describing the\ncircumstances surrounding unnatural deaths likely have a\ndirect impact on judgments of intent.14 We believe that such\nvariations reduce the validity and reliability of statistics on\nviolent death. At the same time, we argue that improved\ncollection of accurate and detailed information on fatal\ninjuries that result from high risk behaviors, regardless of the\ndecedents' intentions, can lead to better and more effective\nviolence prevention efforts.\nMETHODS\nData sources\nWe used two sources of data in this analysis to explore\npatterns of manner-undetermined death: the NVDRS and the\nWeb-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System\n(WISQARS) which draws on mortality data from the US\nNational Vital Statistics System. Standard descriptive statis-\ntics were used to compare groups. Two-sample t tests,\nassuming equal variances, were computed to compare group\nmeans.\nThe NVDRS is a state-based, active surveillance system that\ncollects information on all homicides, suicides, deaths of\nundetermined intent, deaths resulting from legal interven-\ntion (except legal executions), and deaths from unintentional\nfirearm injuries. State health departments participating in\nthe NVDRS typically identify these violent deaths as their\ndeath certificates are filed and then establish details of the\ncases from C/ME and law enforcement records. Details\ncollected include the circumstances contributing to the\ndeaths, interpersonal relationships, and toxicology results.\nSeven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,\nOregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) provided NVDRS data\nin 2003. Six additional states (Colorado, Georgia, North\nCarolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) provided\nmanner-undetermined deaths.20\nViolent deaths in the NVDRS are initially defined by\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-\n10) codes; NVDRS coders then review all pieces of evidence\nand assign a manner consistent with NVDRS coding\npractices.21 The manner of death used in the NVDRS analysis\npresented here is the abstractor-assigned manner of death.\nThere are other differences in the NVDRS case definition, as\nThe NVDRS makes a unique contribution to injury\nsurveillance in that information about circumstances related\nto suicide, undetermined deaths, homicides, and uninten-\ntional firearm injuries are linked together from multiple\nsources in a single, incident-level database. The NVDRS does\nnot collect information on unintentional deaths, aside from\nfirearm related unintentional deaths, so detailed examination\nof these cases was not possible. Additional information about\nthe NVDRS design, methods, and variable definitions are\nWISQARS data are collected by Centers for Disease Control\n(CDC)'s National Center for Health Statistics from death\ncertificates registered in each of the 50 states and the District\nof Columbia.

Figure 1 illustrates the inverse relation-\nship between rates of undetermined-manner deaths and\nunintentional poisoning deaths among NVDRS states using\nPoison types in the NVDRS\nmanner occurred in which a poison was noted in the record.\nMaryland, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island. In 2003, six\nclassifications of poisonings comprised most undetermined\npoisoning cases: 440 deaths due to prescription drugs only\nstreet/recreational drugs only (97.3% in Maryland/\nMassachusetts), 262 deaths due to ``other combination of\ndue to street/recreational drugs and prescription drugs\n(97.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts), 78 deaths due to alcohol\nand prescription drugs (91.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts),\nand 67 deaths due to alcohol and street/recreational drugs\n(97.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts). Results from this\nanalysis of NVDRS data are summarized in table 3.\nIn 2004, these same six classifications of poisonings\ncomprised most undetermined poisoning cases: 444 deaths\ndue to prescription drugs only (73.0% in Maryland/\nMassachusetts/Rhode Island), 285 deaths due to street/\nrecreational drugs only (92.6% in Maryland/Massachusetts/\nRhode Island), 155 deaths due to ``other combination of\nsubstances'' (95.5% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode\nIsland), 127 deaths due to street/recreational drugs and\nprescription drugs (92.1% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode\nIsland), 72 deaths due to alcohol and prescription drugs\n(93.1% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode Island), and 50\ndeaths due to alcohol and street/recreational drugs (98.0% in\nMaryland/Massachusetts/Rhode Island).\nThe comparison of high rate versus low rate undetermined-\nmanner NVDRS states is complicated by differential reporting\nof poisoning type across the two groups. In 2003, Maryland\nand Massachusetts together reported type of poison in 82%\nmanner states reported type of poison in only 37% (112 of\nthis, computing significance tests of poison type differences\nbetween the two groups is not warranted until the question\nof differential reporting bias can be ruled out.\nDISCUSSION\nThe number of deaths classified by NVDRS abstractors as\nundetermined in manner varies considerably among states\nparticipating in the NVDRS. This confirms patterns based on\nICD-10 classifications found among the 50 US states and the\nDistrict of Columbia. In particular, Massachusetts, Maryland,\nand Rhode Island tend to have more manner-undetermined\ndeaths than other states. In addition, these states contribute\nTable 3 Numbers and percentages of undetermined-intent deaths by type of poisoning: high rate undetermined-manner states\nType of poisoning\nOther\nstates Row total\n% in\nOther\nstates Row total\n% in\nMA/MD, Massachusetts/Maryland; MA/MD/RI, Massachusetts/Maryland/Rhode Island; OTC, over-the-counter (no prescription required); CO, carbon\nmonoxide.\nFigure 1 Scatterplot of age-adjusted rate of undetermined intent by the\nage adjusted rate of unintentional poisoning deaths among NVDRS\nMaryland; RI, Rhode Island.\nii52 Breiding, Wiersema\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\na disproportionate percentage of the overall number of\nundetermined deaths within the NVDRS. Using WISQARS\ndata, we found that these three states' poisonings comprise a\nlarge majority of the manner-undetermined deaths. Further,\nwhen comparing these states with all others and the District\nof Columbia, we found that they have a substantially higher\nrate of undetermined death and, more specifically, substan-\ntially higher rates of undetermined poisonings. We also\nfound that the states with substantially higher rates of\nundetermined poisoning tend to have low rates of uninten-\ntional poisoning. Finally, NVDRS data suggest that the\npoisons involved in most undetermined poisoning deaths in\nMaryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are some\ncombination of recreational drugs, alcohol, or prescription\ndrugs. The only undetermined poisoning deaths found in\nsignificant numbers in other NVDRS states were deaths in\nwhich prescription drugs alone were implicated, although\ndifferential reporting of poison types across states make this a\nvery tentative finding.\nThe data indicate that C/MEs in Maryland, Massachusetts,\nand Rhode Island are more likely than C/MEs in other\nNVDRS states to classify a poisoning death as undetermined,\nparticularly when a combination of prescription drugs,\nrecreational drugs, or alcohol is implicated. We suspect,\nbased on the WISQARS data, that in other NVDRS states\nsimilar poisonings were classified as unintentional. However,\nwe were unable to examine this possibility directly using\nNVDRS because data on most unintentional deaths (that is,\nthose that are not firearm related) are not collected by the\nsystem.\nThe discrepancies in the classification of poisoning deaths\nfound here may reflect a lack of consensus among C/MEs.\nThis is a critical issue for public health surveillance,\nparticularly the NVDRS, because decisions about intent can\nsignificantly affect the validity of violent death data. Further,\ngiven the variation we found among states for poisoning\ndeaths, variation in other types of deaths likely exists, albeit\nin less striking numbers. Future studies might examine this\npossibility. Future studies might also consider whether\nguidelines for manner-of-death classification disseminated\nby the National Association of Medical Examiners, particu-\nlarly for the classification of poisoning deaths, can be made\nclearer.\nThis study's findings have implications for the analysis and\ninterpretation of future studies examining undetermined\ndeaths using NVDRS data. Because of the apparently\ndiscrepant criteria used for the classification of poisoning\ndeaths in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, the\ndata for undetermined deaths in these states are not directly\ncomparable with other states' deaths of undetermined intent.\nTherefore, when analyzing undetermined deaths in the\nNVDRS, we recommend that researchers perform separate\nanalyses: one for Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode\nIsland, and another for the remaining states. An alternative\nstrategy would be to analyze undetermined poisonings\nseparately from other undetermined deaths. Performing\nseparate analyses allows an examination of undetermined\ndeaths which factors out the very large effect caused by\ndiffering criteria among states in classifying manner-unde-\ntermined poisonings.\nFinally, even though the criteria Maryland, Massachusetts,\nand Rhode Island use in defining undetermined intent\nappear to be much more liberal than those of most other\nstates, the increased number of undetermined deaths that\nthey contribute to the NVDRS represents an excellent\nopportunity for studying a wider range of fatal self-injurious\nbehaviors. Previous researchers have speculated that violent\ndeath surveillance systems significantly undercount suicide3\nbecause C/MEs typically classify a death as suicide only when\nsignificant evidence exists to indicate suicidal intent.\nHowever, many who die by suicide do not provide such\nevidence, particularly those who experience ambivalence\nabout suicide. Little detail is known about people who die\nby suicide without a clear indication of intent because their\ndeaths have typically been classified as undetermined or\naccidental in nature. However, those who experience\nambivalence about suicide may provide the best opportunity\nfor intervention given their doubts about taking their own\nlife.\nPrevious researchers have discussed the need to examine\nthe entire continuum of intentionality for self-injurious\ndeaths.23 24 Our study indicates that, within the NVDRS, such\nan examination would require looking not only at manner-\nundetermined deaths for possible/probable suicides, but also\nat some deaths classified as unintentional. In essence, it\nwould require defining self-harm in a way that is less\nconcerned with C/ME verdict and more concerned with the\nbehavior that resulted in the death. We therefore recommend\nfuture expansion of the NVDRS case inclusion criteria to\ncover all deaths involving self-harm, regardless of intent.\nWhile this may come at increased cost to the NVDRS system\nit is worth noting that Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode\nIsland collect information on many, if not most, of these\ndeaths already.\nUntil unintentional deaths can be examined for possible/\nprobable suicides, the unique collection of circumstance,\ntoxicology, and situational variables of the NVDRS should be\nused to explore all available clues in deaths of undetermined\nintent. The many deaths of undetermined manner in\nMaryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island may provide\nan especially good opportunity to examine a wider portion of\nthe continuum of intentionality among violent deaths.\nAuthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nM J Breiding, Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, GA, USA\nB Wiersema, Violence Research Group, Department of Criminology and\nCriminal Justice, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA\nKey points\nN Significant variation exists among NVDRS states in the\noverall number and rates of manner-undetermined\ndeaths; among those states with elevated numbers,\nmost of the manner-undetermined deaths are due to\npoisoning.\nN States that have many manner-undetermined poison-\ning deaths also tend to have few unintentional\npoisoning deaths, suggesting different criteria for the\nclassification of poisoning deaths in some states.\nN Results point to the need for consideration of a wider\nrange of the continuum of intentionality, from those\nwho leave evidence of suicidal intent to those who may\nbe ambivalent and less likely to leave such evidence.\nN Within the NVDRS, this might mean examining both\nmanner-undetermined and unintentional deaths for\npossible/probable suicides.\nN Results have implications for the analysis of manner-\nundetermined deaths in the NVDRS, namely that states\nwith high rates of undetermined poisoning deaths\nshould be analyzed separately from those with low\nrates.\nUndetermined manner of death classification in the US ii53\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThis research was supported in part by a subcontract to the University of\n01 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the\nMaryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH).\nCompeting interests: none.\nEthics approval: IRB approval was sought and obtained from the\nUniversity of Maryland Human Subjects Committee prior to the collection\nof Maryland NVDRS data; however, no identifiable data were accessed\nor analyzed for this publication.\nThe findings and conclusions in this paper are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental\nHygiene, or the University of Maryland.\nREFERENCES\n1 Linsley KR, Schapira K, Kelly TP.
