Details of NLSY assessment metho-\ndology, attrition, and other matters are described in detail\nelsewhere.4,22,23 Informed consent was obtained from all\nadult participants.\nIn order to examine risk factors for the development of\nasthma, the analysis was restricted to children who first\nentered the cohort prior to age 2 years and were asthma-free\nprior to age 2 years and at the time of their first body mass\nindex (BMI) measurement (measured at age 2 or 3 years). In\naddition, the analysis was limited to subjects who partici-\npated in at least two rounds of the survey.\nParticipants\nOf the 11 300 children who were surveyed at some point in\nNLSY the following were excluded: 5574 whose initial\nparticipation occurred after age 24 months, 586 who only\nparticipated in one survey, 58 who had asthma prior to age\n24 months, 94 who had asthma at their first survey with a\nclassifiable BMI, and 595 who did not have a classifiable BMI\nat the baseline evaluation. The final analytic cohort\nDemographics, and variable definitions\nThe following variables were included in the analysis: sex,\nrace/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, or white), poverty status,\nprenatal maternal smoking history, birth weight, and BMI.\nChildren were classified as having a mention of poverty if\nthis was noted in any survey they participated in. Weights\nand heights were measured either by an in-home interviewer\nusing a portable scale and tape measure or reported by the\nparent.4 In this analysis, 69% of the height and 61% of the\nweights were measured. The BMI was calculated by dividing\nthe weight in kilograms by the height in m2. Observations\nfrom subjects in whom the BMI was p10 or X70 kg/m2 were\nexcluded as likely measurement errors, reporting errors, or\nsigns of extreme medical condition.4 The most recent\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth curves were used\nto determine the BMI percentile.24 Children were classified\nbased on their BMI percentile at the baseline evaluation into\nX85th percentile).25 Children were also classified using the\nsame three categories at the subsequent evaluations they\nparticipated in. Asthma-free children were categorized based\non their BMI classifications over multiple visits into four\ncategories: always o25th percentile, always X85th percen-\ntile, at least one time X85th percentile, and others (consist-\ning of children not in one of the other three categories).\nChildren who were previously `asthma-free' were classified\nas developing asthma (incident asthma) if their parent\nreported they either had asthma that limited their activity\nor required the use of medication or frequent attention from\na doctor.\nStatistical analysis\nFor analyses, both SAS and SUDAAN26,27 were used. Person-\nyears at risk were determined by using the time from the\nbaseline evaluation to either the final evaluation or the\nevaluation during which asthma was reported. Cox propor-\ntional hazard regression models were developed using the\nSAS procedure PHREG to account for differential follow-up\nin study participants. The time of follow-up was the under-\nlying time metric. Plots of the log\u00adlog survival curves for\neach covariate were used to demonstrate that the propor-\ntional hazards assumptions were met. The effect of BMI was\nanalyzed in two different ways: as a time varying covariate\nand as an independent variable at each of the first four\nevaluations. Models were developed to determine whether\nthe BMI predicted the development of asthma, after adjust-\ning for race, sex, prenatal maternal smoking history, birth\nweight, and poverty status. HR and 95% CI are reported.\nIn addition, we repeated the analyses in subgroups stratified\nby sex, due the previous reported evidence of different effects\nof BMI on asthma incidence in males compared to\nResults\nOf the 4393 children in our analytic cohort, all of whom\nwere initially surveyed prior to age 24 months and asthma\nfree at that time, 218 (5.0 %) developed asthma during the\nchildren excluded because they were not followed since\nbirth, 364 (6.5 %) had asthma noted at least once (either at\nbaseline or follow-up).

The data suggested this might be a risk\nfactor in 4\u00ad7 year old children,5 but was not statistically\nsignificant. Some studies have suggested a curvilinear\nrelation between bronchial responsiveness or asthma inci-\ndence and BMI.9,19 Asthma is a chronic illness and some\nchronic illnesses are associated with lower BMIs.38,39 In\naddition, asthma has several different phenotypic presenta-\ntions, so it is possible that different phenotypes of asthma\nmay be affected by BMI in different ways.40\nIn this study, the overall incidence of asthma among\nincluded children was 8.2 per 1000 person-years at risk. This\nrate is comparable to that seen in several studies of\nperson-years at risk reported by Gilliland et al.21 This study\nwas designed to look at the effect of BMI on incident asthma,\nand standards for classifying BMI in children do not exist\nprior to age 24 months. Thus, the study had to exclude\nchildren who had asthma prior to age 24 months and those\nwhose first BMI was obtained at the same time they were\nreported to have asthma. A result of this is that the overall\nincidence of asthma in all of the children followed from\nbirth in this cohort would have been higher than 8.2 per\nThis study is subject to several limitations. Asthma was\nproxy-reported and not verified by either the use of medical\nrecords, physician contact, or other means. The definition of\nasthma used in this study was not the traditional one (has\nyour child ever been diagnosed by a physician with\nFigure 1 Incident cases of asthma among children asthma-free at the\nbaseline evaluation (age 2\u00ad3 years), stratified by the baseline body mass index\nTable 5 Results of multivariate proportional hazards models predicting the\ndevelopment of asthma in the overall group and stratified by sex\nSex\nFemale Referent\nRace\nWhite Referent Referent Referent\nPoverty\nNo mentions Referent Referent Referent\nPrenatal maternal smoking\nNo Referent Referent Referent\nBirth weight\nX5.5 pounds Referent Referent Referent\nBMI category at baseline\n(age 2\u00ad3 years old)a\n25th\u00ad84th percentile Referent Referent Referent\nBMI profile at second visit\n25th\u00ad84th percentile Referent Referent Referent\nBMI profile at third visit (age\n25th\u00ad84th percentile Referent Referent Referent\nBMI profile at fourth visit\n(age 8\u00ad9 years old)c\n25th\u00ad84th percentile Referent Referent Referent\nBMI category (time varying\ncovariate)d\nOthers Referent Referent Referent\npercentile\nThe models included either the body mass index (BMI) classification at each of\nthe first four visits or the BMI as a time varying covariate.

Thus, this analysis may not have included\nchildren with very mild asthma who did not meet those\ncriteria. Also, there is no way to separate out true asthma\nfrom obesity-related dyspnea. Another possibility is that\nchildren with high BMIs may be more likely to have activity\nlimitations or require more frequent use of medication,\nthus resulting in their being counted as asthma cases more\nthan similar children with normal BMIs. Finally, we only\nsaw a significant effect of elevated BMI on asthma among\nboys, who had a higher incidence of asthma than girls in\nthis study. If, however, this study could be extended into\nyoung adulthood, when the incidence of asthma among\nwomen increases above that seen in men, the relation\nbetween elevated BMI and asthma could also be seen among\nwomen.\nIn conclusion, this analysis suggests a complex relation\nbetween BMI and incident asthma among children that may\nvary by sex. This finding needs further study with more\ntraditional assessments of asthma outcomes. Overall, this\nstudy found that boys with high BMIs were at increased risk\nfor developing asthma, although there appear to be vulner-\nable ages for both boys and girls during which being\noverweight increases the risk for the development of asthma.\nReferences\n1 Mannino DM, Homa DM, Pertowski CA, Ashizawa A, Nixon LL,\nJohnson CA et al.
