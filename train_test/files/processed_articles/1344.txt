Whether obesity\nalso predicts psychiatric disorders such as depression has not\nbeen established. Since depression is also associated with\nchronic medical conditions (5, 6), poor treatment compli-\nance, higher utilization of health services, and worse health\noutcomes (5, 6), the relation between obesity and depression\nis important to clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers.\nThus far, population-based studies of the association\nbetween obesity and depression have yielded inconsistent\nresults (7, 8). Some studies found an association (9\u00ad14), but\nothers did not (15\u00ad17). Some found an association between\nobesity and higher rates of depression in women but not in\nmen (11, 12); others reported inverse associations between\nMethodological differences across studies have contrib-\nuted to these inconsistent observations. Friedman and\nBrownell noted in their 1995 review (8) that most popula-\ntion-based studies had not defined depression according to\nestablished psychiatric diagnostic criteria. The definition of\nobesity also varied. Some investigators used body mass\nindex (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters, as a continuous variable in their\nanalyses; others used cutpoints to define BMI categories.\nMore recent studies have used cutpoints recommended by\nCorrespondence to Dr. Chiadi U. Onyike, Osler 320, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, 600 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21287 (e-mail:\nconyike1@jhem.jhmi.edu)\nthe US Public Health Service (the Public Health Service\ndefines obesity as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile) (20)\nor the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (the Insti-\ntute defines obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher) (1). The use of\ncutpoints defined by percentiles is problematic. BMI distri-\nbutions vary across subpopulations defined by age, gender,\nrace, geography, and time (1). Thus, cutpoints based on\npercentiles may yield obesity categories that are not compa-\nrable across studies.\nSince the publication of Friedman and Brownell's review,\nthree population-based studies (9, 10, 13) have defined\ndepression using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition (DSM-\nNational Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (22).\nAmong adults aged 18 years or more, high BMI was\ninversely associated with past-year depression and suicide\nideation in men; positive associations were observed in\nwomen. Low BMI was associated with past-year depression,\nsuicide attempts, and suicide ideation in men but not in\nwomen. When BMI categories were used in the analyses,\nobesity (BMI 30) was associated with past-year depression\nin women and was inversely associated with it in men.\nRoberts et al. (9), in older adults from the Alameda County\nStudy, found that obesity in 1994 (as defined by the US\nPublic Health Service criteria) was associated with past-year\ndepression in 1995, after controlling for age, sex, education,\nmarital status, social support, social isolation, life events,\nfinancial strain, chronic medical conditions, and functional\ndisability. Health and functional disability were the most\nimportant indicators of risk for depression in that report.\nRoberts et al. examined whether the definition of obesity\naffected their results. There was an association between\nobesity and past-year depression in unadjusted analyses but\nnot in multivariable analyses when obesity was defined\nusing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria\n(9). These findings were replicated in a 5-year study of the\nResults from these studies are somewhat disparate with\nrespect to the risk for depression when obesity is defined\nusing National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. This\nmay be due to heterogeneity of the obesity-depression rela-\ntion across obese persons, as has been suggested in recent\nreviews (7, 8). One approach to resolving this heterogeneity\nis to stratify obesity by severity (class 1, BMI 30\u00ad34.9; class\npreviously been used. In addition, the first two studies (9, 13)\nreported associations for past-year depression, the third (10)\nfor depression within the past 2 weeks; it is possible that the\nassociation between obesity and depression depends on the\ntime frame used to measure depression.\nThe inconsistency of findings from previous research indi-\ncates that obesity and depression do not always co-occur.\nTherefore, it is necessary to ask: When does an association\nbetween these conditions occur? Understanding when\nobesity and depression co-occur in the population is impor-\ntant. First, obesity and depression are common and have\nimportant deleterious effects on a wide range of health\noutcomes (1\u00ad6). Second, a subgroup of people may exist in\nwhom both conditions co-occur with a higher frequency than\nin the general population. Indeed, clinical studies have\nreported higher rates of depression and psychopathology\namong persons with severe obesity (23, 24); however, clin-\nical samples represent a select population. It remains unclear\nwhether severely obese persons represent a subgroup of the\nobese population that is at particular risk for depression.\nIdentifying which obese persons will also have depression\nis a useful approach to resolving the heterogeneity of find-\nings from previous research. Finding this subpopulation will\nalso help investigators focus future research on more infor-\nmative samples. By specifying an \"at-risk\" population,\nresearchers can use increasingly precise case definitions to\ninvestigate underlying mechanisms and to develop and eval-\nuate more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions\nfor both conditions.\nIn this study, we investigated whether there is any associ-\nation between obesity and depression; whether the associa-\ntion between obesity and depression depends on the severity\nof obesity; and whether the definition of obesity and/or\ndepression influences the occurrence of the association. Data\nfrom the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) (25) presented us with the opportu-\nnity to address these questions in a population sample, since\na structured diagnostic interview was used to ascertain the\npresence of DSM major depression in the respondents. We\nassessed several hypotheses. First, we predicted that there\nwould be no association between obesity (BMI 30) and\ndepression in the NHANES III sample. Our rationale was\nthat obesity is a heterogeneous condition (26), and inconsis-\ntent results from previous studies strongly suggested hetero-\ngeneity of relations (with depression) within the obesity\ncategory (7, 8). In addition, our population sample was\nyoung and healthy; chronic medical conditions and func-\ntional disability explain much of the association in older\nadults (9, 10). On the other hand, we hypothesized that\nsevere obesity (BMI 40) would be associated with depres-\nsion. Severe obesity has been associated with depression in\nof persons aged 20\u00ad59 years found a higher prevalence of\nunhappiness (in men) and sadness (in women) in the highest\ntertile of relative body weight (28).\nWe expected the occurrence of an association between\nobesity and depression to depend on the time frame used to\nmeasure depression. The time frame used to measure depres-\nsion influences the assignment of depression status. For\nexample, many persons with past-year depression are\nexcluded from the diagnosis when the past-month time\nframe is used to measure depression; this can lead to error\nwhen evaluating associations between obesity and depres-\nsion. In addition, individuals' recollection of past symptoms\ncan change considerably over time (29); there may be differ-\nences in reliability when different time frames are used to\ndiagnose depression.\nStudy population\nThis was an analysis of cross-sectional data collected\nduring NHANES III, a survey of the US population\nIs Obesity Associated with Major Depression? 1141\ninvolving interviews, physical and psychological examina-\ntions, and collection of laboratory data. The survey was\nfor Health Statistics. Data were weighted to produce national\nestimates, with adjustments for oversampling (of young chil-\ndren, the elderly, and ethnic minorities) and nonresponse.\nThe multistage sampling procedure has been described else-\nwhere (25, 30). This study received approval from the\nCommittee for Human Research of the Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public Health.\nwere included in NHANES III. The response rates of 82\npercent for the household interviews and 73 percent for the\nexaminations (unpublished data from the National Center for\nHealth Statistics) are typical of large surveys. In this study,\nbeen randomly selected for the structured psychiatric inter-\nview. A total of 363 respondents (4.1 percent) were excluded\nfrom the study analyses: 28 of these (0.3 percent) were\nmissing data on height or weight (precluding calculation of\nrelative body weight), and 338 (3.8 percent) were missing\ndata from the psychiatric interview (precluding ascertain-\nment of depression status). The final sample size for this\nstudy was 8,410. Compared with study subjects, persons\nexcluded from the study were more frequently underweight\nnot shown). Those excluded more frequently had an educa-\ntion of eighth grade or less and had less frequently been\neducated beyond high school (2 p < 0.01). Approximately\n71 percent of participants were White, as compared with 44\npercent of excluded persons (2 p < 0.01); the participation\nof African-American and Hispanic respondents was compa-\nrable. There were no differences by gender, age, or marital\nstatus.\nMeasurements\nDiagnostic Interview Schedule. The Diagnostic Interview\nSchedule (DIS) (31, 32) is a structured interview designed\nfor use by trained lay interviewers. In the NHANES III, only\nthe section required for diagnosis of depressive and bipolar\ndisorders was administered. The DIS allowed diagnoses to\nbe made according to operational criteria in the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition\n(DSM-III) (33). The DIS has been well characterized (34)\nand widely used in epidemiologic field studies (35). The\nDIS/DSM-III diagnosis of major depression in NHANES III\nis equivalent to a diagnosis based on the DSM-IV.\nMajor depression. The diagnosis of DIS/DSM-III major\ndepression requires the persistence of depressed mood or\nanhedonia for at least 2 weeks. An additional four out of\neight other possible depressive symptom groups are required\nto have been clustered with depressed mood or anhedonia\nduring those 2 weeks. The diagnosis is not made if the\nrespondent attributes the symptoms to another illness, medi-\ncines, or bereavement or if there is no social or occupational\nimpairment. In this study, the primary measure of depression\nwas past-month DSM-III major depression. Respondents\nwere also assigned a diagnosis of past-year and/or lifetime\n(ever having met the criteria) major depression. Respondents\nwere assigned a diagnosis of recurrent major depression if\nthey had ever had more than one episode of depression. All\ndepression measures were binary (0 = no depression, 1 =\ndepression).\nRelative body weight. Body mass index was calculated\nfrom height and weight, which were measured by trained\ntechnicians. Participants were grouped into four or six BMI\ncategories based on criteria from the National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute (1). For the four-category definition,\nreference category), \"underweight\" (BMI <18.5), \"over-\nsix-category definition, the obese category was subdivided\nused BMI as a continuous variable to investigate associa-\ntions over the entire range of relative body weight.\nCovariates. Selection of covariates was based on the\npublished literature (36\u00ad44), and bivariable logistic regres-\nsion analyses were performed to identify potentially\nconfounding factors. The potential confounders considered\nyears); race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White (referent), non-\nHispanic Black, Hispanic, or other); education (8\n(referent), divorced/widowed/separated, or never married);\nphysician's rating of health (excellent, good, or fair/poor);\ndieting for medical reasons (0 = no, 1 = yes); use of psychi-\natric medicines in the past month (0 = no, 1 = yes); cigarette\nsmoking (never, former, or current); use of alcohol (no use,\nformer use, moderate use, or abuse); and ever use of mari-\njuana (0 = no, 1 = yes) or cocaine (0 = no, 1 = yes).\nStatistical analysis\nStata software (45) was used for all statistical analyses.\nStata uses weights and sampling data to provide corrected\nstandard error estimates and statistical tests. There was suffi-\ncient statistical power to test the study hypotheses (table 1).\nMost analyses were stratified by gender. The primary analyt-\nical method was estimation of the relative odds for depres-\nsion in each obesity class. The multivariable logistic\nregression model included the potential confounders.\nLogistic regression analyses were performed for each defini-\ntion of DSM-III major depression (past-month, past-year,\nlifetime, and recurrent) and for each measure of relative\nbody weight (continuous BMI, four BMI categories, and six\nBMI categories).\nRESULTS\nThe demographic characteristics of the respondents are\nshown in table 2. Men and women did not differ significantly\nin terms of age, race/ethnicity, education status, or area of\nresidence (urban vs. rural). Equal proportions of men and\nwomen were currently married. Greater than twofold more\nwomen than men were separated, widowed, or divorced (2\np < 0.0001); more men than women had never been married\npercent obese (data not shown). A higher proportion of\nwomen than of men were in obesity classes 2 and 3, and\nThe prevalence of past-month DSM-III major depression,\nby relative body weight, is shown in table 3. As expected,\nwomen had an approximately 2.5-fold higher prevalence of\npast-month depression than men; this is consistent with\nresults from other population-based prevalence studies that\nused the DIS and DSM-III criteria to identify cases, as well\nas with results from studies that used other measurement\nmethods (46). The prevalence of past-month depression was\nhigher in obese subjects than in normal-weight subjects.\nThere was heterogeneity in the prevalence rates across the\nsubclasses of obesity, with the highest rates of depression\noccurring in obesity class 3. Prevalence rates for depression\nin the underweight and overweight were not different from\nthose in the normal-weight. Results were similar for past-\nyear, lifetime, and recurrent depression (data not shown).\nAmong women, the prevalence of depression was higher\nwith increasing levels of obesity. Among men, prevalence\nrates were lowest in obesity class 2 and highest in obesity\nUnadjusted odds ratios for the association between relative\nbody weight and measures of depression are shown in table\n4.

Obesity class 3 was associated with depression\nobserved for women (data not shown); there were too few\nobesity class 3 men with depression for meaningful multi-\nvariable analyses. Female gender, current smoking, and use\nof psychiatric medicines were also associated with depres-\nsion in these analyses. In post-hoc analyses, there was no\nevidence of interaction between gender or age and obesity\n(or any obesity class) in the association with depression.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we investigated severity of obesity (as\ndefined by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\ncriteria) as a potential discriminator between obese persons\nwith depression and those without depression. We also\nexamined how definitions of obesity and depression may\naffect the occurrence of an association between these condi-\ntions in epidemiologic studies. Early population-based\nstudies showed an inconsistent relation between obesity and\nmajor depression, with the preponderance of the evidence\nsuggesting that no association existed between obesity and\ndepression (see Friedman and Brownell's review (8)). These\nstudies typically treated obesity as a unitary construct, an\napproach that potentially obscures any heterogeneity of rela-\ntions with depression (7, 8). More recent studies have shown\nan association between obesity and depression (9, 10, 13).\nData from clinic samples also support the presence of an\net al. (7) and Friedman and Brownell (8) concluded that there\nare probably multiple relations between obesity and depres-\nsion. They have proposed a \"second generation\" of research\nthat would focus on identifying potential risk factors for\ndepression within the obese population (in preparation for\nfuture prospective multivariable studies). We implemented\nthat approach in this study by investigating severe obesity as\na potential risk factor for depression.\nWe found that the association between obesity and depres-\nsion depends on the severity of the obesity. Obese persons\nhad an approximately 1.5-fold higher prevalence of past-\nmonth depression than their normal-weight counterparts.\nAmong women, obesity was associated with 82 percent\nhigher odds of past-month depression; the estimate of 73\npercent higher odds in men was not statistically significant.\nThese data were inconsistent with our first hypothesis, which\npredicted null results. However, among the obese, there was\nheterogeneity in rates of the prevalence of past-month\ndepression. The prevalence of depression was highest in\npersons with severe obesity (BMI 40). Consistent with our\nsecond hypothesis, there was a strong association between\nsevere obesity and depression in logistic regression analyses;\nwhen we adjusted for potential confounders to assess\nwhether obesity was independently associated with depres-\nsion, the association remained strong.\nThe association between obesity and depression is sensi-\ntive to the definition of obesity. This is hardly surprising,\nTABLE 3.

The time frame used to define cases of\nDIS/DSM-III major depression had only a small effect on\nthe presence of association, especially when obesity was\nstratified by severity. When depression is defined using\nDSM criteria, the presence of an association may not be\nsensitive to the time frame used to measure depression. This\nmay be partly explained by depression's being a chronic\ncondition, and it is of value to researchers in this field in that\nit suggests that DSM depression within the past year is a reli-\nable measure. Thus, the definition of obesity is the more\nimportant determinant of the occurrence of an association\nwith depression. We did not observe any associations when\nBMI was used as a continuous measure. BMI is an unsatis-\nfactory measure when used as a continuous variable--which\nrequires the assumption that the relation between obesity and\ndepression is linear across the entire range of relative body\nweights. Empirical research suggests that health risks are not\nlinearly distributed across the entire range of relative body\nweights; health risks are dramatically higher in the obese (1,\n3, 4), particularly the severely obese (1). As we noted above,\nwhen BMI was categorized, heterogeneity in depression risk\nwas observed and severe obesity was associated with depres-\nsion.\nTABLE 4.

Carpenter et al. (13) found an\nassociation between obesity and depression in women; their\ninverse association in men may correspond to our finding of\na relatively low prevalence of depression in obesity class 2\nmen (which was not statistically significant in logistic\nregression analyses). Roberts et al. (9, 10) found associations\nbetween obesity and depression among older adults with a\nrelatively high prevalence of chronic medical conditions and\nfunctional disability--the principal indicators of risk for\ndepression in their studies. In contrast, we sampled young\nadults in whom chronic medical conditions and functional\ndisability were of very low prevalence and were not associ-\nated with depression. Palinkas et al. (16) also studied older\nadults but did not find any association between obesity and\ndepression (defined by scores on the Beck Depression Inven-\ntory (47)). These studies did not examine associations across\nlevels of obesity. In another study, Britz et al. (27) compared\na clinic sample of severely obese adolescents with obese and\nnormal-weight adolescents from the population and found\nhigher rates of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in the clinic-\nbased case adolescents. Since the clinic-based case children\nwere considerably more obese than the population-based\ncase children, the investigators could not determine whether\nthe higher rates of psychiatric disorders were related to\nsevere obesity or to treatment-seeking behavior.\nThis study had several strengths. First, the sample was\ndrawn from the general household population of the United\nStates, thereby minimizing the selection biases of clinical\nsamples. Second, DSM-III diagnostic criteria were applied\nusing data from a structured psychiatric lay interview\nmethod (the DIS); the DIS/DSM-III diagnosis of major\ndepression was equivalent to a DSM-IV diagnosis. Third, we\nstratified the analyses by gender, which allowed us to iden-\ntify gender-specific patterns of association. Fourth, we were\nable to examine the association between obesity and depres-\nsion within subclasses of obesity. Finally, to our knowledge,\nthis is the only study that has assessed the impact on the\nTABLE 5.

First, the design was cross-\nsectional; a temporal relation between obesity and depres-\nsion could not be inferred. Second, we had data only on\npersons aged 15\u00ad39 years. Thus, the study was limited to\nthat age group. Third, the size of the male subpopulation was\ntoo small for us to test for an independent association of\nsevere obesity with depression. However, the sample size\nwas adequate for our primary hypotheses. Fourth, lay inter-\nviewers may collect clinical data of limited quality, since\nthey are not trained to probe responses; thus, the validity of\ndiagnoses based on lay interviews can be questioned (48,\n49). In addition, problems with the accuracy of the DIS for\ndiagnosing depression (and other psychiatric disorders) have\nbeen reported (50, 51), and diagnostic agreement between\nthe DIS and a psychiatrist's interview is higher in clinical\nsamples than in community samples (34). Furthermore,\nnonspecific symptoms such as change in appetite, fatigue,\ninsomnia, and loss of libido are included in the DSM-III\ndiagnostic criteria for depression. These symptoms may be\nmore common in the severely obese (because of a higher\nprevalence of chronic medical conditions), making careful\nattribution of symptoms (which requires clinical training) a\ncritical factor in the diagnostic process. However, use of the\nDIS is a tremendous improvement over use of continuous\nscales (such as the Beck Depression Inventory (47), the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (52), and\nthe scale of Zung et al. (53)), and our results are consistent\nwith findings from clinical studies. In addition, it is prohibi-\ntively expensive to use clinically trained interviewers to\nascertain diagnoses in large community surveys.\nOur findings indicate that informative approaches to the\nstudy of the association between obesity and psychiatric\noutcomes include the stratification of obesity by severity and\nthe use of DSM definitions of psychiatric disorder. Persons\nwith severe obesity may represent an \"at-risk\" population in\nwhich mechanisms linking obesity to depression can be prof-\nitably investigated. This association between severe obesity\nand depression is also of interest to clinicians, since depres-\nsion is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. It is\nimportant to evaluate and treat depression in persons who\nseek medical treatment for severe obesity, and it may be that\nroutine screening for depression should be formulated as the\nstandard of care for these patients.\nMore research is needed to clarify the relation between\nsevere obesity and depression. For instance, the association\nmay be bidirectional (7). In addition, it remains unclear\nwhether gender, age, race, and socioeconomic status influ-\nence this association. The use of DSM criteria for the diag-\nnosis of depression in population-based studies has been an\nimportant step forward, but research measures will have\nenhanced construct validity when interviewers are clinically\ntrained. Clinic-based samples will be useful for identifying\nother potential risk factors for depression in the obese, since\nthey often represent the extreme of disease or syndrome\npresentations and thus may minimize ambiguity in case defi-\nnitions and heterogeneity in research samples. Prospective\nstudies will ultimately be required in order to clarify the\ntemporal relation between obesity and depression, but these\nstudies must await the identification of potential risk factors\nfor depression in the obese. These studies will require active\ncollaboration between investigators to surmount the chal-\nlenges involved, which include high costs, the need for large\nstudy samples, lengthy follow-up, and repeated assessments,\nand the problem of censorship in studies of long duration.\n"
