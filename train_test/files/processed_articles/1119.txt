Interdisciplinary Institute of Management, London School of Economics and Political Science,\nBACKGROUND: It is widely known that more boys are born during and immediately after wars, but there has not\nbeen any ultimate (evolutionary) explanation for this `returning soldier effect'. Here, I suggest that the higher sex\nratios during and immediately after wars might be a byproduct of the fact that taller soldiers are more likely to\nsurvive battle and that taller parents are more likely to have sons. METHODS: I analyze a large sample of British\nArmy service records during World War I. RESULTS: Surviving soldiers were on average more than one inch\n(3.33 cm) taller than fallen soldiers. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative estimates suggest that the one-inch height advan-\ntage alone is more than twice as sufficient to account for all the excess boys born in the UK during and after World\nWar I. While it remains unclear why taller soldiers are more likely to survive battle, I predict that the returning\nsoldier effect will not happen in more recent and future wars.\nKeywords: generalized Trivers\u00adWillard hypothesis; offspring sex ratio\nThe puzzle: the `returning soldier effect'\nIt has been widely observed that more boys than usual are born\nduring and immediately after the World Wars in most of the\nsoldier effect'.\nMacMahon and Pugh (1954) were among the first to observe\nthe effect. They demonstrate that the sex ratio among whites in\nthe USA rose during World War II, but not during World War I.\nOthers have since documented the phenomenon repeatedly\nBonin, 2004). In one of the most comprehensive demon-\nstrations, Graffelman and Hoekstra (2000) conclusively show\nthat the secondary sex ratio (sex ratio of live births) increased\nduring and immediately after World Wars in all belligerent\nnations (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the\nNetherlands, USA and UK), except for Italy and Spain. In\nthe succinct words of the scientist who has studied sex ratios\n(of both humans and other animals) more than anybody else,\n`there can be no reasonable doubt that sex ratios (proportions\nmale at birth) have risen during and just after major wars'\nWhile there may be no reasonable doubt that the pheno-\nmenon exists, there are no satisfactory explanations for it.\nIn particular, to the best of my knowledge, few have proposed\nan ultimate (evolutionary) explanation for the increased\nnumber of boys born during and immediately after wars. One\nattempt at an ultimate explanation is the view that sons have\ngreater expected reproductive success than daughters during\nand immediately after wars in which many men die (Trivers,\nparents to know how long the war (or any other situation of\ngreater male mortality) will last. If the war lasts longer than,\nsay, 15 years, long enough for the newborn boys to reach\nsexual maturity, then parents who have more sons may on\naverage achieve greater inclusive fitness than parents who\nhave more daughters.\nSome offer proximate explanations of the returning soldier\ncontends, first, that the mother, not the father, determines the\nsex of the offspring and, second, that dominant, `tough'\nwomen high in testosterone are more likely to have sons.\nWith respect to the returning soldier effect, Grant (1998,\nwars because they have to take over some of the traditionally\nmale roles in society in the absence of men, and they as a\nresult have more boys presumably because their testosterone\nlevels increase during wars. However, there is very little\n# The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.\nAll rights reserved.

It also cannot explain why the secondary sex\nratio remains high for a few years after the end of the war.\nJames (2003) offers an alternative proximate mechanism.\nDuring wars, couples are reunited only during short leaves\nfrom the armed services. They are expected to have frequent\nintercourse during such short leaves and, as a result, more\nlikely to conceive during the early phase of the cycle, when\nthe estrogen/gonadotrophin ratio in women is high. Mamma-\nlian (including human) sex ratio is higher when the maternal\nestrogen level is higher at the time of conception (James,\n1996). Hence, couples who have high frequencies of intercourse\n(such as briefly reunited soldiers on short leaves and their wives)\nare more likely to conceive sons. While very plausible on the\nsurface, James' (2003) proximate explanation currently lacks\nempirical support, including rigorous quantitative evidence\nfor the crucial assumption that coital frequency is higher\nduring wartime and remains high for a few years afterwards\nThus the puzzle remains: Why (as opposed to how) are\nmore boys born during and immediately after wars? What\nultimate mechanism can account for it?\nBefore going further, it is important to point out that, while\nthere is indeed no reasonable doubt that more boys are born\nduring and immediately after wars, and the absolute number\nof excess boys is large in large populations, the relative increase\nin the secondary sex ratio is very small. For example,\nMacMahon and Pugh (1954) report that the sex ratio among\nwhites in the USA increased from the baseline of 51.406 to\nII, the sex ratio increased by three-quarters of a 10th of a boy\nGraffelman and Hoekstra's (2000) more recent and compre-\nhensive analysis of all belligerent nations in both World Wars\nproduces the same results. For example, in the UK, the baseline\nsex ratio during peacetime is 51.2 (Graffelman and Hoekstra,\nthis translates into an increase in odds of having a boy by\nonly 0.7% (the odds of having a boy during peacetime:\nGeneralized Trivers\u00adWillard hypothesis (gTWH)\nIn their classic paper, Trivers and Willard (1973) suggest that\nparents might under some circumstances be able to vary the\nsex ratio of their offspring in order to maximize their reproduc-\ntive success. The Trivers\u00adWillard hypothesis (TWH) proposes\nthat, for all species for which male fitness variance exceeds\nfemale fitness variance, male offspring of parents in better\nmaterial condition are expected to have greater reproductive\nsuccess than their female siblings, because their greater size\nallows them to outcompete their intrasexual rivals and mono-\npolize available reproductive opportunities. The converse is\ntrue of offspring of parents in poorer material and nutritional\ncondition, because smaller males, who are not intrasexually\ncompetitive, are excluded from mating opportunities. Parental\ncondition affects the reproductive prospects of female off-\nspring to a much lesser extent. Almost all females get to repro-\nduce some offspring, even though no female can produce a\nlarge number due to their greater obligatory investment into\nWhile the TWH in its original formulation has specifically to\ndo with material (and, for humans, economic) condition of\nparents and their ability to vary the sex ratio of their offspring\nin response to such condition, the basic insight behind it may be\nmore general. The fundamental assumption underlying the\nTWH is that if males are expected to attain greater reproductive\nsuccess than females, for whatever reason, then parents may\nhave more sons than daughters. If, in contrast, females are\nexpected to attain greater reproductive success than males,\nfor whatever reason, then parents may have more daughters\nthan sons. While female fitness variance is much smaller\nthan male fitness variance among mammalian species, there\nis still variance among females, and some women do better\nthan others, in terms of the quality, if not quantity, of their\noffspring.\ngTWH: parents who possess any heritable trait which\nincreases male reproductive success at a greater rate (or\ndecreases male reproductive success at a smaller rate) than\nfemale reproductive success in a given environment will have\na higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more males).\nParents who possess any heritable trait which increases\nfemale reproductive success at a greater rate (or decreases\nfemale reproductive success at a smaller rate) than male repro-\nductive success in a given environment will have a\nlower-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more females).\nthesis, the gTWH is completely mute on which parent deter-\nmines or influences the sex of the offspring. There has been\nemerging evidence for the gTWH with respect to a variety of\nheritable traits which increase the reproductive success of off-\nspring of one sex or the other (see Kanazawa, 2007, for review).\nOne of these heritable traits which has been shown to affect\nsecondary sex ratios is body size: big and tall parents are more\nlikely to have sons (Kanazawa, 2005). Taller men have greater\nreproductive success than shorter men (Pawlowski et al., 2000;\nNettle, 2002a), but shorter women have greater reproductive\nsuccess than taller women (Nettle, 2002b). And body size\n(height and weight) is substantially heritable (Chambers\nfore predict that taller and heavier parents will have a\nhigher-than-expected number of sons, and shorter and lighter\nparents will have a lower-than-expected number of sons (or a\nhigher-than-expected number of daughters).\nIf this finding is generalizable, then it can potentially\nprovide an ultimate explanation for biased sex ratios, including\nsociety-wide patterns like the returning soldier effect. If the\npopulation distribution of any of the relevant traits (any herita-\nble trait that has a sexually dimorphic effect on the reproduc-\ntive success of the offspring) shifts slightly during and\nimmediately after wars, then the gTWH can possibly explain\nReturning soldier effect\nwhy there are more boys born then. If, for example, taller and\nbigger soldiers are more likely to survive wars, to be reunited\nwith their wives after demobilization, while shorter and\nsmaller soldiers are more likely to die, never to get an(other)\nopportunity to reproduce, then the gTWH would predict that\nmore boys will be born during and immediately after wars.\nThe returning soldier effect would then be a byproduct of the\ngTWH, where soldiers who would have produced daughters\nwere more likely to be killed during the war and did not get\nan opportunity to do so. Such a byproduct of the gTWH is\nexpected to be temporary, as younger generations of men\nwho were unaffected by the combat experience (and thus pre-\nserve the normal distribution of height) become of reproductive\nage and start having children, and as the surge of baby boom\ncreated by postwar reunion of soldiers with their wives gra-\ndually wanes.\nThe question then is: is it possible that there was a significant\ndifference in body size between the soldiers who survived the\nbattle and those who were killed?\nSurviving and fallen British soldiers during\nWorld War I\nData\nIn order to examine whether soldiers who survive wars are\ndifferent in body size than soldiers who do not, I examine the\nservice records of British soldiers in World War I. The\nrecord series `WO (War Office) 363' in the National Archives\nin Kew Gardens outside London contains service records of\nevery single man who enlisted for the British armed forces\ndier's record typically begins with the attestation form, which\nlists the soldier's name, address, age, marital status and next\nof kin, among other demographic information at the time of\nenlistment. Then each enlistee undergoes a thorough medical\nexamination, where their height, chest girth and (less freq-\nuently) weight, and vision are measured and recorded. The\nrecord also contains the details of each soldier's service for\nits entire duration, where and how long he was posted at a parti-\ncular domestic or foreign location, when he was granted leaves,\nif he received any medal of honor for his service, and his ulti-\nmate fate. It records whether he was discharged after a given\nlength of service, demobilized at the end of the conflict or\nkilled in action or died of wounds or diseases acquired\nduring service. WO363 contains the records of enlisted men\nand non-commissioned officers only; it excludes the records\nof commissioned officers.\nThe original records for 6.5 millions soldiers were kept in\nthe War Office Record Store on Arnside Street in London after\nWorld War I (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/\nFullDetails\u00bcTrue). On 8 September 1940, incendiary bombs\ndropped during an air raid campaign by the German Luftwaffe\ncaused fire at the War Office Record Store, and destroyed\napproximately two-thirds of the records (WO363 is thus known\nas the `burnt documents'). The surviving records, many of\nwhich were charred and water damaged, were subsequently\nstored on 23 608 reels of microfilm, in alphabetical order of the\nsoldier's last name. All 23 608 reels are currently kept at the\nNational Archives in Kew Gardens for free public access for\nanyone who visits the National Archives in person, but they are\nnot online or accessible from a remote site.\nThe sample\nBecause WO363 records exist only as the original handwritten\nforms photographed on microfilm, and because the information\nis not coded or digitized in any way, it is impossible to draw a\nrepresentative sample of the soldiers. I have therefore decided\nto code each soldier's record into a computer file, starting with\nthe first record on the first reel (A1), in strict alphabetical order\nby the last name, without skipping any record. I have thus tran-\nscribed the first 1000 records. The last names range in alpha-\nbetical order from Ababreltom to Ablett.\nThis is obviously not a representative sample of men who\nperiod. For example, to the extent that many Irish last names\nbegin with M or O, my sample probably underrepresents sol-\ndiers from Ireland (which was part of the UK until 1921).\nHowever, I do not expect Irish nationality to be correlated\nwith either the independent variables of interest (height and\nweight) or the dependent variable (survival).\nNor do I have any reason to believe that the alphabetical\norder of the soldier's last name or the probability of the soldier's\nrecord's survival of the fire on 8 September 1940, in London,\nto be correlated with the soldier's body size or his ultimate\nfate in the war. I therefore believe that, while my sample is\nnot a representative sample in the technical sense, it is nonethe-\nless an unbiased sample with respect to the current purpose of\ndetermining whether British soldiers who survived World War I\nwere significantly taller than those who did not.\nIn order to ascertain whether my particular decision to code\nthe first 1000 cases has any effect on my conclusions, I have\ndrawn alternative samples of first n cases which includes 100\ndead soldiers with usable (non-missing) values on height\ncases which includes 1000 usable values on height (n \u00bc\n1122). None of my substantive conclusions below change as\na result of using any of these alternative samples.\nDependent variable\nThe dependent variable of interest here is whether the soldier\nsurvived the war (0 if he survived the war, 1 if he was\nkilled). I did not make a distinction among the causes of\ndeath. Sometimes the soldier's fate is recorded as `killed in\naction' and other times as `died of wounds'. A few soldiers\ndied of an accident while on duty. If the soldier died of any\ncause during his military service, I record him as being\nkilled. In a few instances where the soldier's survival status\nwas not apparent in the handwritten records in WO363, I con-\nsulted the (purportedly comprehensive) list of fallen British\nsoldiers at the web site of the Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission (http://www.cwgc.org/).\nSimilarly, there are many ways a British soldier could\nsurvive World War I. Most were `discharged' from service\nafter a contracted period of service. These soldiers usually\nfilled out a discharge form, which recorded the date of\nKanazawa\ndischarge and a forwarding civilian address. In some cases, the\nsoldier was `demobilized' after the end of the conflict in World\nWar I. In a surprising number of cases, the soldier deserted\nthe unit. Once again, regardless of the reason for survival,\nI recorded the soldier as having survived if he was not killed\nduring his service.\nIndependent variables\nMy main independent variables of interest are the soldier's\nheight and weight at the time of enlistment. These were\ntaken during the routine medical examination at the beginning\nof his service. For some reason, weight was not measured\nnearly as frequently as height and `chest girth' (the chest\nmeasurement when fully expanded). Some of the forms used\nfor medical examination had spaces for height and chest\ngirth, but not for weight. Other forms had spaces for height,\nweight, chest girth, vision for left and right eye, as well as\nother medical measurements. In addition to height, weight\nand chest girth, I recorded the soldier's age at enlistment and\nmarital status (1 if currently married, 0 otherwise).\nResults\n898 as survived. All subsequent comparisons, however, use\nsomewhat smaller numbers due to missing data on the indepen-\ndent variables.\nThe surviving soldiers in my sample have a significantly\nhigher mean height than fallen soldiers (in cm): 168.63\nsoldiers are also significantly heavier (in kg): 60.46 versus\n1.6). The two groups are not different in chest girth (91.29\n\u00bc 1.301, ns).

In order to provide a statistically\nconservative estimate of what potential consequences in off-\nspring sex ratio this height difference might have, I will\nfocus on the mean difference in the subsequent analysis.\nThe reader should keep in mind that my choice of the mean\ndifference deliberately underestimates the potential conse-\nquences for offspring sex ratio.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of soldiers' height by their\nsurvival status. The top panel shows the distribution of height\namong soldiers who survived World War I, and the bottom\npanel shows the distribution of height among soldiers who\nwere killed. The vertical line that runs through both panels indi-\ncates the mean height of the surviving soldiers (168.63 cm). It\nis evident that the distribution of height among the fallen sol-\ndiers in the bottom panel has a lower mean than the distribution\nof height among the surviving soldiers.\nWhat difference does a one-inch difference make?\nIt thus appears that British soldiers who survived World War I\nwere slightly but significantly taller than those who were killed.\nFigure 1: Height distributions of surviving soldiers (top panel) and\nfallen soldiers (bottom panel), British troops during the World War I\nThe solid vertical line indicates the mean height of surviving soldiers\nReturning soldier effect\nThe mean height difference is nearly one inch (2.37 cm).\nBut what difference can such a small height difference\nmake in offspring sex ratio? Is it really sufficient to account\nfor all the excess boys born during and after World War I in\nthe UK?\nUnfortunately, this question cannot be answered with his-\ntorical data from the UK from the same period. There are no\ndatasets that contain both the height of the general population\norder to estimate the effect of height on the offspring sex ratio,\nI use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health) from the USA. To my knowledge, Add Health\nis the only data set with a large, nationally representative\nsample of a population, in which researchers measure respon-\ndents' height rather than relying on their self-reports. Given\nthat most men want to be taller than they are (Calden et al.,\n1959), it is important not to rely on self-reports of height in\nestimating its effect on offspring sex ratio.\nThe use of Add Health in the following analysis, however,\ncrucially assumes that the effect of height on offspring sex\nratio remains roughly comparable both across time (from\nearly 20th to early 21st century) and across the Atlantic (in\nthe UK and in the USA). Both TWH and gTWH are purported\nto describe not only species-typical phenomena applicable to\nall human societies at all times, but also a fundamental bio-\nlogical process hypothesized to operate among all species\nwith sexually dimorphic fitness variance.\nAmong male respondents who have had at least one child by\n(n \u00bc 696), controlling for education and income (as measures\nof social class predicted to influence offspring sex ratio by\nthe original TWH) and weight, height has a significantly posi-\ntive effect on the probability of having a son as the first child\nThe odds ratio (eb) of 1.0550 for one-inch increment in\nincreases the odds of having a son by 5.13%. Notice that,\naccording to Graffelman and Hoekstra's (2000) analysis, this\nis more than seven times the actual increase in the odds of\nhaving a son during and immediately after World War I in\nthe UK (0.7%). It therefore follows that, if at least one-seventh\nof British male population experienced combat duties in World\nWar I, then the one-inch height difference between the sur-\nviving and fallen soldiers can account for all the excess boys\nborn during and immediately after the war.\nAs it turns out, nearly one-third (32.39%) of young British\nmen between the ages of 15 and 40 were mobilized during\nWorld War I. In 1911, in the last British Census conducted\nbefore the outbreak of World War I, the number of men\nbetween the ages of 15 and 40 in England and Wales was\nTable 29). Unfortunately, the exact number of adult males in\nScotland and Ireland in 1911 is not available. However, in\nAllen, 1999, p. 6). Assuming that the population age structure\nin Scotland and Ireland in 1911 was roughly comparable to that\nin England and Wales in the same year, it means that the total\nmillion British men were mobilized during World War I\n(Spencer, 2001, p. xi). Thus the proportion of adult males\nwho served in the British military during World War I is\nIt, therefore, appears that the very slight (2.37 cm) height\nadvantage of surviving soldiers compared to their fallen com-\nrades is more than twice as sufficient to account for the return-\ning soldier effect observed in the UK during and immediately\nafter World War I. This conclusion assumes that surviving\nand returning soldiers were no more or no less likely to\nfather a child during and immediately after World War I than\nthe rest of the (unmobilized) male population. If, as some\nyears of separation from their wives are more likely to\nfather a child, then it would have required an even smaller\nproportion of the British male population to have been\nmobilized to produce the observed increase in the number\nof boys. Further, recall that the use of the median height\ndifference (3.33 cm) would also have required a similarly\nsmaller proportion of the British male population to have\nbeen mobilized.\nWhy do taller soldiers have better chance\nof survival in war?\nIf the height advantage of surviving soldiers over fallen sol-\ndiers in the British armed forces during World War I genera-\nlizes to the soldiers of other belligerent nations in both\nWorld Wars, then the phenomenon, combined with the ten-\ndency of taller parents to have more sons, can potentially\nexplain the returning soldier effect, where more boys are\nborn during and immediately after wars. More empirical\nresearch is necessary, both to replicate the findings above in\nthe UK and to extend it to other western nations found to\nhave experienced the returning soldier effect during and after\nWorld Wars (Graffelman and Hoekstra, 2000).\nIt remains unclear why taller soldiers are more likely to\nsurvive battle than shorter soldiers. I can offer three specu-\nlations. First, taller and heavier soldiers, especially during the\nless prosperous times of the early 20th century, may have\nbeen physically stronger and more fit, as well possibly as\ngenetically and developmentally healthier. They might, there-\nfore, have been better able to resist diseases and even\nwounds sustained during combat, which might have killed\ntheir shorter and lighter counterparts.\nSecond, height is known to be correlated with intelligence\nSinha, 1993). Some (Miller, in press) suggest that both height\nand intelligence are indicator of underlying genetic health,\nwhile others (Kanazawa and Reyniers, 2007) contend that the\nextrinsic correlation stems from assortative mating of intelli-\ngent men and beautiful women, on the one hand, and that of\ntall men and beautiful women, on the other. The correlation\nbetween height and IQ among men in the Add Health data is\nKanazawa\nbetween height and intelligence has two possible con-\nsequences. While the WO363 records that I use in my analysis\ninclude only enlisted men and non-commissioned officers, and\nexcludes commissioned officers, it is possible that taller and\nthus more intelligent men were able to climb the ranks of\nnon-commissioned officers to such ranks as lance corporal\nand sergeant, and were able to avoid the most dangerous\ncombat situations because of their relative seniority (I thank\nWilliam H. James and Dominic D. P. Johnson for indepen-\ndently suggesting this possibility to me).\nAlternatively, modern warfare, even in the Great War\nnearly a century ago, is evolutionarily novel in that it\ninvolves weapons, machines, tactics and situations that did\nnot exist in the ancestral environment. Soldiers may therefore\nhave needed general intelligence to fight successfully and\nsurvive an evolutionarily novel situation of modern warfare\n(Kanazawa, 2004). Given that a non-trivial number of British\nsoldiers survived World War I by deserting, they may have\nneeded general intelligence to desert and avoid court-martial\nsuccessfully. Whalley and Deary (2001) show, however, that\nless, not more, intelligent British soldiers were more likely to\nsurvive World War II.\nDominic D. P. Johnson (personal communication) suggests\nanother interesting hypothesis. If vital organs in the body do\nnot increase in size linearly with the body size (height and\nweight), then it means that taller and heavier soldiers, while\nthey may be more likely to be shot because of their larger\nbody size, have nonetheless more room in their body where\nthey can be `safely' shot and still survive the injury.\nRegardless of the exact reason why taller soldiers are more\nlikely to survive battle, if my explanation for the returning\nsoldier effect is correct, the phenomenon is not likely to be\nobserved and repeated in more recent and future wars. This\nis because, for my suggested mechanism to work, a substantial\nproportion of the male population has to be deployed in the\nwar. With the advances in military technologies, however,\nwhich allow the modern military to fight wars, not by mano a\nmano combat of large infantries, but with laser-guided missiles\non a computer screen and supersonic fighter jets, military\nforces of advanced western nations do not require as many\nsoldiers to fight the war successfully as they used to. This\ntransition to smaller military forces is reflected in the discon-\ntinuation of conscription in most western nations.\nWith much smaller proportions of the male population\nmobilized in wars, the returning soldier effect is not likely to\nbe repeated, even if tall soldiers are still more likely to\nsurvive battle and even if tall parents are more likely to have\nsons. The higher sex ratios among the surviving (and returning)\nsoldiers will not significantly shift the secondary sex ratio in the\nwhole society. There is some evidence that more boys were not\nborn during more recent wars, such as the Iran\u00adIraq wars in\nof mobilization might also explain why the returning soldier\neffect was not observed in the US during World War I, when\nit was during World War II (MacMahon and Pugh, 1954;\n"
