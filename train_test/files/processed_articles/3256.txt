The contribution of this paper is to analyze the role of wage\nand price contracting schemes for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. Most monetary\nmodels adopt the scheme of Calvo for introducing nominal stickiness. Despite its popu-\nlarity, the scheme has unappealing properties. There exists a set of firms that almost never\nadjust their prices. Some firms are forced to retain prices arbitrarily far away from the\noptimal price, which can influence the welfare implications in an unreasonable way.\nWe compare the following models of nominal rigidities. Contract adjustment of\nCalvo, a truncated version of that scheme, N period overlapping contracts as in Taylor\nand a more general scheme with time varying adjustment probabilities as suggested by\nWolman. All of these schemes imply that the welfare cost of nominal rigidities stem from\nthe dispersion of differentiated goods across producers or of differentiated labour across\nworkers.\nOur main findings is that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are very sensitive to\nthe particular way in which these rigidities are modeled. The costs of these rigidities may\nvary from roughly 0.05 to roughly 0.3 of one per cent of consumption in each period.\nWe find that Calvo contracts may imply much higher welfare costs of nominal rigidities\nthan schemes with a narrower support of the intervals between price or wage changes\nbut equal mean. In the baseline parameterization of the model, Calvo contracts give rise\nto welfare costs of nominal rigidities that are more than 3 times as high as for Taylor\ncontracts. However, the finding that Calvo contracts imply higher welfare costs is not\ngeneral. Calvo contracts may also imply similar welfare costs over the business cycle than\nTaylor contracts depending on the monetary policy rule. The intuition for this result is as\nfollows. When the age distribution has larger support as in Calvo vs. Taylor contracts,\nthere are some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract price tends to\nbe more out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect typically increases\nthe welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther into the future and\nalso charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions. The overall effect on\nprice dispersion and therefore welfare is ambiguous.\nWe perform two robustness checks. We explore how the welfare costs of nominal\nrigidities depend on the existence of an economy-wide rental market for capital and on\nintroducing rigidities via the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and Reis. We show\nthat imposing firm specific capital has two opposite effects on the welfare costs of nomi-\nnal rigidities that may be largely offsetting. A given amount of relative price dispersion is\nmore costly in welfare terms since there is more dispersion of labour across firms. How-\never, specific capital makes firms more reluctant to changes prices, since marginal cost\nnow depends on the price they charge. Hence, there is less price dispersion in equilib-\nrium.\nWe then assume as in Mankiw and Reis that some agents must choose their contract\nbased on outdated information sets and vary the age distribution of information sets as\nwe did in our earlier analysis with contract ages. When restricting the ability to obtain\ncurrent information rather than directly restricting the ability to reset contracts, we find\nthat the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are typically very small: ranging from 0.01 to\n0.06 of one per cent of consumption.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nNominale Rigidit\u00a8\naten sind essentiell f\u00a8\nur Neu Keynesianische Modelle. Diese Rigidit\u00a8\naten\nk\u00a8\nonnen jedoch auf vielerlei Weise modelliert werden. Der Beitrag dieses Papiers liegt\ndarin, die Rolle von Lohn- und Preiskontrakten f\u00a8\nur die Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen\nRigidit\u00a8\naten zu analysieren. Die meisten monet\u00a8\naren Modelle folgen dem Calvo Ansatz zur\nModellierung von Preiskontrakten. Trotz seiner Popularit\u00a8\nat hat dieser Ansatz problema-\ntische Eigenschaften. Bei diesem Ansatz gibt es eine kleine Menge von Firmen, die fast\nnie den Preis anpassen. Diese Firmen sind gezwungen einen Preis zu setzen, der nahezu\nwillk\u00a8\nurlich weit weg vom optimalen Preis liegt. Diese Eigenschaft des Calvo Ansatzes\nk\u00a8\nonnte die Wohlfahrtsimplikationen der Neu Keynesianischen Modelle in unplausibler\nWeise beeinflussen.\nDieses Papier vergleicht die folgenden Modelle von nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten: Kontrakt-\nanpassung nach Calvo, eine \"gestutzte\" Version dieses Schemas, \u00a8\nuberlappende Kontrakte\nnach Taylor und einen allgemeineren Ansatz mit zeitvariierenden Kontraktanpassungs-\nwahrscheinlichkeiten nach Wolman. Bei allen diesen Modellierungsans\u00a8\natzen lassen sich\ndie Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten darauf zur\u00a8\nuckf\u00a8\nuhren, dass die unter-\nschiedlichen G\u00a8\nuter oder Arten von Arbeit in gesamtwirtschaftlich ineffizienter Menge\neingesetzt werden.\nAls wesentliches Resultat dieser Analyse l\u00a8\nasst sich feststellen, dass die Wohlfahrts-\nkosten von nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten sehr stark davon abh\u00a8\nangen, wie diese Rigidit\u00a8\naten mo-\ndelliert werden. Die nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten sind mit Wohlfahrtskosten verbunden, die -\nje nach gew\u00a8\nahltem Modellierungsansatz - zwischen circa 0,05 und circa 0,3 Prozent des\nKonsums in jeder Periode variieren. Calvo-Kontrakte k\u00a8\nonnen sehr viel h\u00a8\nohere Wohl-\nfahrtskosten implizieren als Kontraktschemata mit einer anderen Verteilung der Intervalle\nzwischen den Kontrakt\u00a8\nanderungen, aber gleicher durchschnittlicher Kontraktdauer. In\nder grundlegenden Kalibrierung des Modells sind die Kosten der nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten\nbei Calvo- Kontrakten dreimal so hoch wie bei Taylor-Kontrakten. Allerdings ist dieses\nErgebnis nicht allgemeing\u00a8\nultig. Calvo-Kontrakte k\u00a8\nonnen, je nach der geldpolitischen\nRegel, auch Kosten in \u00a8\nahnlicher H\u00a8\nohe wie Taylor-Kontrakte hervorrufen. F\u00a8\nur dieses\nResultat mag folgende Intuition hilfreich sein. Wenn die Altersverteilung von Preiskon-\ntrakten breiter wird, wie beim \u00a8\nUbergang von Taylor- auf Calvo-Kontrakte, dann gibt es\neinige Firmen, deren \u00a8\naltere Preise weniger die gegenw\u00a8\nartigen \u00a8\nokonomischen Bedingun-\ngen reflektieren. Dieser Effekt erh\u00a8\noht typischerweise die Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen\nRigidit\u00a8\naten. Anderseits \u00a8\nandert sich auch das Preissetzungsverhalten derjenigen Firmen,\ndie heute die Gelegenheit haben, den Preis anzupassen. Diese Firmen schauen weiter in\ndie Zukunft und setzen einen Preis, der auch weniger die gegenw\u00a8\nartigen \u00a8\nokonomischen\nBedingungen reflektiert. Insgesamt ist der Effekt auf die Verzerrung relativer Preise und\ndamit die Wohlfahrt nicht eindeutig.\nDas Papier nimmt zwei Robustheitsanalysen vor. Es wird erstens untersucht, wie\ndie Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten von der Existenz eines Marktes f\u00a8\nur die\nAllokation von Kapitalg\u00a8\nutern zwischen den Firmen abh\u00a8\nangen. Zweitens wird gepr\u00a8\nuft,\nwelche Auswirkung die Annahme teilweise veralteter Informationsmengen bei Preis- und\nLohnsetzung im Sinne von Mankiw und Reis auf die Wohlfahrtskosten hat.\nDie Annahme, dass Kapitalg\u00a8\nuter vollkommen firmenspezifisch sind, hat zwei un-\nterschiedliche Auswirkungen auf die Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten. Ein\ngegebenes Ausma\u00df der Verzerrung relativer Preise bewirkt h\u00a8\nohere Wohlfahrtskosten, weil\nnun der relative Arbeitseinsatz zwischen den Firmen st\u00a8\narker verzerrt wird. Allerdings\nnimmt die Verzerrung relativer Preise tendenziell ab, weil Firmen nun weniger starke\nPreis\u00a8\nanderungen vornehmen. Dies liegt daran, dass die Grenzkosten der Produktion bei\nfirmenspezifischem Kapital von der Produktionsmenge der einzelnen Firma und damit\nvon ihrem eigenen Preis abh\u00a8\nangen. Folglich gibt es im Gleichgewicht eine geringere\nVerzerrung der relativen Preisen.\nEs wird als n\u00a8\nachstes angenommen, dass die Individuen ihre Kontrakte auf der Ba-\nsis teilweise veralteter Informationsmengen festlegen. Die Altersverteilung der Informa-\ntionsmengen wird dann in derselben Art und Weise variiert wie vorher beim Kontrakt-\nalter. Es stellt sich heraus, dass Restriktionen auf die Informationsmengen zu wesentlich\nkleineren Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen Rigidit\u00a8\naten f\u00a8\nuhren als direkte Restriktionen\nauf die Kontraktanpassung. Diese Kosten variieren nun nur noch zwischen 0,01 und 0,06\nProzent des Periodenkonsums.\nContents\n2.1 Households . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.2 Production . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n2.3 The efficiency gap and monetary policy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3 Alternative wage and price setting schemes 6\n3.1 The general Wolman (1999) framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3.2 The log-linearized price and wage setting conditions . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n4 The key equations and model calibration 12\n5 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities 15\n5.1 Average duration or average age? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n5.2 Welfare costs of sticky contracting schemes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n5.3 Welfare costs of sticky information schemes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\nList of Tables\n1 Conditional adjustment probabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n2 The considered interest rate rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n3 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - mobile capital . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n4 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - sticky information . . . . . . . . . . 19\n5 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - immobile capital . . . . . . . . . . . 21\nList of Figures\n1 Age distribution of wage contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n2 Age distribution of price contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3 Welfare costs with sticky wages and flexible prices . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4 Welfare costs with sticky prices and flexible wages . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n5 Sensitivity 1: Inverse of Frish elasticity and relative risk aversion . . . . . 23\n6 Sensitivity 1: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor . . . . . . . . . . 24\n7 Sensitivity 2: Substitutability of differentiated labour and goods . . . . . 24\n8 Sensitivity 2: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor . . . . . . . . . . 25\n9 Sensitivity 3: Inflation response and Output gap response . . . . . . . . . 25\n10 Sensitivity 3: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor . . . . . . . . . . 26\nThe Role of Contracting Schemes for the Welfare Costs of\nNominal Rigidities over the Business Cycle1\n1 Introduction\nThe welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations have been an important topic for macroe-\nconomic research since the seminal paper by Lucas (1987). Lucas (2003) focused on the\nvariability of consumption and has argued that the costs of cyclical fluctuations are very\nsmall, roughly 0.07 percent of steady state consumption. Recently, a number of studies\nhave employed new Keynesian monetary models with sticky prices and wages to find that\nthe welfare costs could be much larger. Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) show that\nthe costs of nominal inertia may be 20-60 larger than the costs of consumption variability\nNominal rigidities can be modeled in many different ways in New Keynesian models.\nThe contribution of this paper is to analyze the role of wage and price contracting schemes\nfor the welfare costs of nominal rigidities.2 Most monetary models adopt the scheme\nof Calvo (1983) for introducing nominal stickiness. Despite its popularity, the scheme\nhas several unappealing properties. Collard and Dellas (2005) point out that \"a well-\nknown but unfortunate feature of this scheme is that there exists a non-zero set of firms\nthat almost never adjust their prices\". Similarly, Bergin and Tchakarov (2003) note that\n\"under Calvo pricing, some firms are forced to retain prices arbitrarily far away from\nthe optimal price, which can influence the welfare implications in a way viewed by some\nas unreasonable\". The main contribution of this paper is to compute the welfare costs\nof nominal rigidities across several popular modeling devices for stickiness in nominal\ncontracts. In doing so, we address an issue identified by Woodford (2003), who writes\nthat \" to deal with other, possibly more realistic distributions of intervals between price\nchanges, is an important topic for future research.\"\nauthors find that Calvo (1983) contracts imply much larger dispersion of output across\nfirms in the steady state induced by trend inflation and therefore lower steady welfare than\nTaylor (1980) contracts of equal average duration. An important and natural question is\nwhether the use of the Calvo (1983) scheme has similar implications for quantifying the\n1Author: Matthias Paustian, Center for European Integration Studies, Walter-Flex-Str. 3, D-53119\nBonn, Germany. m paustian@yahoo.de\nThis paper is largely based on my earlier work, Paustian (2004).

All errors\nare my own.\nquadratic adjustment costs give rise to similar Phillips curves. This does not imply that the welfare costs\nof nominal rigidities must be similar, as the Phillips curves are similar only after linearization, whereas\nwelfare measures take into account some of the nonlinearity of the model.\nwelfare costs of nominal rigidities over the business cycle rather than in the steady state.\nMonetary general equilibrium models that feature steady state inflation often assume that\nagents can index their contracts to the trend inflation rate, thereby completely bypassing\nthe point made in Ascari (2004). It is an open question, to what extent the findings of\nKiley (2002) and Ascari (2004) are also relevant for the costs of nominal rigidities over\nthe business cycle in an environment without trend inflation or equivalently with full\nindexation to the trend inflation rate.\nWe build on the paper by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) who analyze welfare in\na model with nominal stickiness in wage and price setting. The models of nominal rigidi-\nties we consider are the following: Random price adjustment of Calvo (1983), a truncated\nversion of the Calvo (1983) scheme, N period overlapping contracts as in Taylor (1980),\na more general scheme with time varying adjustment probabilities as suggested by Wol-\nman (1999) and finally variants of the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and Reis\n(2002). All of these schemes imply that the welfare cost of nominal rigidities stem from\nthe dispersion of differentiated goods across producers or of differentiated labour across\nworkers. Thus we consider a homogenous family of modeling devices for nominal rigidi-\nties.3 When comparing these schemes we require an equal expected duration over which\nnewly set contracts or information sets are fixed.4 In such a way no model implies more\nexogenous stickiness on average. While this metric is typically assumed in the literature,\nit is not the only obvious choice. We also report results when choosing the average age in\na cross-section of contracts as our metric, taking into account recent criticism by Dixon\nThe schemes suggested by Taylor (1980), Wolman (1999) all relax at least one un-\npleasant assumption of the Calvo (1983) contracts. Taylor (1980) contracts truncate the\nhorizon in the expectation formation of price and wage setters, which is infinite in the\nscheme of Calvo (1983). Wolman (1999) additionally relaxes the assumption that ad-\njustment probabilities are independent of time elapsed since last adjustment. Finally, the\nMankiw and Reis (2002) scheme provides a tractable framework for considering limited\navailability of information, often seen as one possible micro-foundation for sticky nomi-\nnal contracts.\nOur main findings can be summarized as follows. We find that the welfare costs or\nnominal rigidities depend very strongly on how these rigidities are modeled. These costs\nrange from 0.01 of one per cent of period consumption to 0.32 of one per cent, depending\non the monetary policy rule in place and on the particular contracting scheme chosen. We\nfind that Calvo (1983) contracts may imply much higher welfare costs of nominal rigidi-\nties than schemes with a narrower support of the intervals between price or wage changes\nbut equal mean. In the baseline parameterization of the model, Calvo (1983) contracts\ngive rise to welfare costs of nominal rigidities that are more than 3 times as high as for\nTaylor (1980) contracts. This supports the view that the use of Calvo (1983) contracts\nmay influence welfare calculations in a very special way. However, the finding that Calvo\n(1983) contracts imply higher welfare costs is not general. Contrary to the results by Ki-\n3An often used scheme missing from this comparison is Rotemberg (1982) quadratic adjustment costs.\nWe do not consider it here, since it does not belong to the family of rigidities that imply dispersion of output\nacross firms or hours across workers. Furthermore, the derivation of welfare based loss function is not as\neasily done as with the other schemes.\n4The duration is equal to the inverse of the frequency of contract adjustment.\nley (2002) for the steady state effects of inflation, Calvo (1983) contracts may also imply\nsimilar or even slightly smaller welfare costs over the business cycle than Taylor (1980)\ncontracts. The intuition for this result is as follows. When the age distribution has larger\nsupport, there are some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract\nprice tends to be more out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect\ntypically increases the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther\ninto the future and also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions.\nTherefore widening the support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme\nhas an ambiguous impact on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare.\nWhen restricting the ability to obtain current information rather than directly restrict-\ning the ability to reset contracts, we find that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are\ntypically much smaller. For all considered monetary policy rules and for all considered\nage distributions of information sets, the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are smaller\nthan the cost of consumption variability computed by Lucas (2003), i.e. less than 0.07 of\none per cent of consumption.\nIn the final section we perform a robustness check that explores the role of an economy\nwide rental market for capital. The absence of a rental market for capital represents a\nsource of real rigidity identified by Ball and Romer (1990) and Kimball (1995) to be\nimportant for the business cycle analysis of monetary models.We show that imposing\nfirm specific capital has two opposite effects on the welfare costs of nominal rigidities\nthat may be largely offsetting. A given amount of relative price dispersion is more costly\nin welfare terms since there is more dispersion of labour across firms. However, specific\ncapital makes firms more reluctant to changes prices, since marginal cost now depends on\nthe price they charge. Hence, there is less price dispersion in equilibrium. We find that\nthe relative welfare costs of nominal rigidities across the considered contracting schemes\ndo not depend strongly on how we model capital.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the setup of the model. In section\n3, we describe our alternative wage and price setting schemes. Section 4 collects the\nlog-linearized necessary conditions for equilibrium and the model's baseline calibration.\nSection 5 computes the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for our considered schemes.\nIn section 6 we take up the aforementioned robustness check. Finally, section 7 briefly\nsummarizes the findings and concludes. An appendix contains the sensitivity analysis\nwith respect to key parameters.\nThe model is based on Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000). In particular, capital is\nin fixed supply in the aggregate. In the baseline model, we assume that there exists an\neconomy-wide rental market that allows capital to move freely between firms. This as-\nsumption is relaxed in a robustness check. We assume further that subsidies exist that\ncompletely offset the effects of monopolistic competition in the steady state in order to\navoid involved derivations of the loss function that would arise with an inefficient steady\nstate.5 Finally, following Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) households can fully insure\n5Recently Benignio and Woodford (2004) have shown that not assuming the subsidies, the quadratic\nwelfare criterion used here and the relative weights attached to the elements in that criterion still apply as\nagainst the idiosyncracies in income streams arising from nominal wage rigidities. While\nthis may bias the welfare costs of nominal rigidities, it greatly facilitates the analysis.\nThere is a continuum of households with unit mass indexed by h. Households are in-\nfinitely lived, supply labour Nt\n(h) and receive nominal wages Wt\n(h), consume final goods\nCt\n(h), and purchase state contingent securities Bt\n(h). Furthermore, they receive lump\nsum transfers Tt\nas well as profits t\n(h) from the monopolistic retailers and hold nominal\nmoney balances Mt\n(h). The utility function is assumed to be separable in consumption,\nreal money balances and leisure. The representative household's problems is:\nmax\n{Bt,Mt+1,Ct,Nt}\nEt\n\nt+i\nt\n+ H\nMt+i\n(h)\nPt+i\n-\nNt\ns.t. Ct\n(h) = (1 + w\n)\nWt\n(h)\nPt\nNt\n(h) + Tt\n(h) + t\n(h)\n-\n(h) - Mt\n(h)\nPt\n-\nBt\n(h) - Bt-1\n(h)\nPt\n.\nThe function H(\u00b7) depicts the utility flow arising from real money balances, often used\nas a shortcut for a more explicit role for money, such as a cash-in-advance constraint. We\nassume that the utility from real money balances is arbitrarily small. Following Wood-\nford (2003) we omit the first-order condition for money holdings. Given that the we\nmodel monetary policy as an interest rate rule, this equation merely serves to back out\nthe quantity of money that supports a given nominal interest rate. Bt\nis a row vector of\nstate contingent bonds, where each bond pays one unit in a particular state of nature in\nthe subsequent period. The column vector t+1,t\nrepresents the price of these bonds. The\nrole of the bonds is to allow perfect consumption insurance against labour income risk\nstemming from nominal rigidities in wage setting. w\nis a wage subsidy used to offset\nthe steady state effects of monopolistic competition in the labour market. The first order\nconditions for consumption and state contingent bond holdings give rise to the standard\nEuler equation.

When government purchases are present and not unreasonably\nlarge, the relative weights in the welfare function change only slightly and the output gap must be defined\ndifferently. However, the levels of the weights will increase in the severity of the steady state distortion\nno matter whether government purchases are present or not. Since government purchases are absent in our\nmodel, we do not introduce any bias into the analysis of the relative welfare costs of different contracting\nschemes by conveniently assuming subsidies, whereas the levels are affected by our assumption.\nThe demand function for differentiated labour is:\nNt\n(h) =\nWt\n(h)\nWt\n-\nLt\nHere Wt\nis the Dixit-Stiglitz wage index.\nFirms in the final good sector produce a homogeneous good, Yt\n, using intermediate goods,\nYt\n(z), as input in production.

Up to a first-order approximation in log deviations6 flexible price output\nis given by:\nY \nt\n=\n +  + (1 - )\nAt\nOne can use this equation together with the firm's first-order condition for labour demand,\nto derive a key equation for this model. This equation links marginal cost to the output\ngap, Yt\n- Y \nt\n, and the gap between the average marginal rate of substitution between\nconsumption and labour and the real wage:\nXt\n=\n + \n+  Yt\n- Y \nt\n- Lt\n+ Ct\n- wr\nt\nWhen there are no nominal rigidities in the labour market, the marginal rate of substitution\nbetween consumption and labour is equal to the real wage and the last term in brackets\nvanishes. We then recover the condition from sticky price models that marginal cost is\nlog-linearly related to the output gap. When prices are perfectly flexible as well, the\nmarginal product of labour is equal to the real wage, i.e. log marginal cost is zero. It\nfollows that the output gap is zero.\nMonetary policy is assumed to follow an interest rate as suggested by Henderson and\nMcKibbin (1993) or Taylor (1993). We consider the following functional form that is\noften used in the empirical description of central bank behaviour:\n^\nRn\nt\n^\nYt\n- ^\nY \nt\n^\nt\n^\nRn\n+ vt\nHere vt\nis an i.i.d. monetary policy shock capturing non-systematic central bank be-\nhaviour.\n3 Alternative wage and price setting schemes\nThere are many different ways in which nominal rigidities can be modeled in New Key-\nnesian models. The apparatus of Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996) has emerged as a widely\nused standard in the analysis of welfare effects of monetary policy, see e.g. Pappa (2004),\nimplies much more price dispersion induced by steady state inflation than Taylor (1980)\npricing. Ascari (2004) considers a standard New Keynesian model with trend inflation\nand Calvo pricing, where those firms that are not re-optimizing their price cannot adjust\nfor trend inflation. He computes that a trend inflation rate of 5 % generates a steady state\n6Throughout this text, for any variable Xt\n, \u00af\nX denotes its steady value and ^\nXt\n log Xt\n- log \u00af\nX\nloss7 of output relative to the zero inflation case of 11.5 % with Calvo (1983) pricing, but\nonly of 0.5% with Taylor (1980) contracts that have the same average duration over which\nprices are expected to be fixed. The reason is that trend inflation translates into much\nmore price dispersion with Calvo (1983) pricing. We are motivated by these findings to\nundertake a systematic quantitative comparison of the welfare effects of monetary policy\nover the business cycle across different assumptions about wage and price setting. In\norder not to pick up any effects already emphasized by Kiley (2002) and Ascari (2004)\nand in keeping with much of the new Keynesian literature, we analyze an environment\nwith zero trend inflation.\nWe next turn to the description of the alternative price and wage setting schemes. We\ncan subsume 4 contracting schemes under the general framework provided by Wolman\n(1999). The sticky information schemes requires a separate exposition.\nFollowing Wolman (1999), we nest all considered models of price and wage setting as\nspecial cases of the following set-up. Limited ability to reset prices is described by a\nvector . The j-th element of that vector is the probability that a firm adjusts its price in\nperiod t, conditional on the previous adjustment having occurred in period t - j. One can\ndeduce from  a vector , denoting the fraction of firms charging prices set in period t-j.\nThe Wolman (1999) scheme is very flexible, it encompasses Taylor (1980) overlapping\ncontracts as a special case and can approximate Calvo pricing for large J.\nThere are two key differences between the Calvo (1983) price setting scheme and\nthe scheme proposed by Wolman (1999). The first is that Calvo (1983) has an infinite\ntail: for any integer J there is a nonzero fraction of firms that last adjusted their price J\nperiods ago. In the scheme considered here, J is finite. Furthermore, under Calvo (1983)\npricing the probability that a firm adjusts its price in any given period is independent of\nthe time elapsed since the previous adjustment. A firm that has not adjusted its price\nfor say 10 quarters is just as likely to keep the price fixed in period t as a firm that has\nlast adjusted its price in period t - 1. Both the infinite tail and the constant adjustment\nprobabilities of Calvo (1983) are often considered to be unrealistic. Nevertheless, the\nCalvo (1983) scheme is often used under the implicit assumption that these particularities\ndo not influence welfare computations by much.\nWe compare the Calvo scheme for wage and price setting to 3 alternative contracting\nspecifications. To allow for a fair comparison, we require that the expected lifetime of a\nnewly set contract is equal across schemes. In such a way, no contracting scheme imposes\nmore exogenous stickiness on average. Using the general notation above the expected\nlifetime of a newly set contract, D, is\nD \nJ\nkk\n7The loss reported here refers to the case of firm-specific capital and a markup of 10%. The loss is only\n3% when there is an economy wide rental market for capital.\nduration is given by:\nD = (1 - )\n\nWe consider overlapping contracts in the spirit of Taylor (1980), a truncated version of\nthe Calvo (1983) scheme and a more general upward sloping scheme with time dependent\nadjustment probabilities following Wolman (1999). We assume that no price or wage is\nfixed for longer than 10 quarters. Prices are assumed to be fixed on average for 2 quarters,\nwhile wages are fixed for 4 quarters on average. The choice of these durations is motivated\nin section 4. The vectors of adjustment probabilities is depicted in the table 1. In that table\nthe suffix p refers to price setting and w to wage setting.\nTable 1: Conditional adjustment probabilities\ntruncated p p\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\ntruncated w w\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\nPrice and wage setting is staggered under each of these schemes. At any point in\ntime the aggregate price or wage index is determined by the prices of Jp cohorts of firms\nor wages of Jw cohorts of households indexed by when they last updated their contract.\nUnder Taylor pricing there are two cohorts of firms that charge prices lasting for exactly 2\nperiods. At any point in time half of the prices were determined yesterday and half today.\nSimilarly for 4 period wage setting. Under the Wolman scheme, the time profile of the\nconditional adjustment probability is increasing. This is an ad hoc way of capturing the\nnotion that the gain from adjusting prices when firms face fixed adjustment costs should\nincrease the longer prices have not been adjusted. The truncated version of the infinite\nhorizon Calvo (1983) scheme has a time invariant adjustment probability p\nprice setting and w\nperiods after last adjustment, all contracts can be renegotiated.\nWhile all contracting schemes imply that the newly set contracts have the same ex-\npected lifetime, the schemes differ with respect to the average time elapsed since last\nadjustment (the age8 of contracts) at any given point in time as has recently been pointed\nout by Dixon and Kara (2005). Calvo (1983) contracts have the largest average age, Tay-\nlor (1980) contracts have the smallest average age. The following two graphs plot the\nimplied age distribution of wage and price contracts.9\n8The average age is defined as follows. Let j\ndenote the fraction of contracts at any point in time that\nwere last adjusted j periods ago. The average age is J\nj\nj. The j\ncan be derived from the vector \nvia recursions described in Wolman (1999).\n9Note that graphs show that the fraction of contracts that is one period old (i.e. newly set contracts) is\ntime since last adjustment\nshare in population\nTaylor\nWolman\ntruncated Calvo\nFigure 1: Age distribution of wage contracts\ntime since last adjustment\nshare in population\nTaylor\nWolman\ntruncated Calvo\nFigure 2: Age distribution of price contracts\nequal across schemes. The same fraction of contracts are updated in each period, implying an equal average\nexpected duration of a newly set contract. This follows from the fact that the average updating frequency is\nthe inverse of the average duration.\n10At any given point in time, the average age of a price (wage) contracts is 2 (4) for Calvo (1983)\nTaylor contracts.\n3.2 The log-linearized price and wage setting conditions\nIn any given period, a firm faces a certain probability of receiving a signal that allows\nthat firm to reset its price. Firms that do not receive the signal, carry on the prices posted\nin the last period and satisfy any demand at that price. Given the vector of adjustment\nprobabilities , firms compute the probability that the price set today will still be in place\nj periods from now, labeled p\nj\n. The firms problem is:\nmax\nP\nt\n(z)\nEt\nJp\np\ni\niC-\nt+i\n)\nP\nt\n(z)\nPt+i\nYt+i\n- Xt+i\nP\nt\n(z)\nPt+i\n-\nYt+i\nHere, p\nis sales subsidy suitably chosen as to offset the steady state effects of monop-\nolistic competition (1 + p\n\n). The first-order necessary condition for the optimal\nnominal price P\nt\nexpressed in terms of the stationary variable p\nt\n P\nt\nPt\nis:\np\nt\n=\nEt\np\nj\njC-\nt+j\nXt+j\n(t,t+j\n) Yt+j\nEt\np\nj\njC-\nt+j\n(t,t+j\nHere, t,j\n j\nt+k\n, i.e inflation between periods t and t + j. Log-linearizing this\naround a steady state with zero price inflation yields:\np\nt\n= Et\njp\nj\np\n^\nXt+j\n+\np\nj\np\nt+j\nwith: p =\njp\nj\n, p\nj\n=\nk=j\nkp\nk\nFrom the definition of the price index Pt\nPt\n1- we obtain:\np\nj\np\nt-j\n-\np\nj\nt-j\nwith: p\nj\n=\np\nk\nOne can show that it is not necessary to keep track of the relative quantities of intermediate\ngoods produced by the different cohorts of firms in order to solve the model. A relation\nbetween aggregate inputs and aggregate output similar to what was pointed out by Yun\nYt\n=\nAt\nDt\n\u00af\nt\nwith: Dt\n\np\nj\nP\nt-j\nPt\n-\nFor this pricing scheme it is also possible to show that the price distortion term Dt\ncan\nbe ignored for a log-linear analysis around a steady state with zero inflation. One can\nlog-linearize the price distortion term together with the aggregate price index to show that\n^\nDt\n= 0, if there is no trend inflation.\nThe wage setting problem is analogous. Given the vector of adjustment probabilities,\nhouseholds maximize utility through choice of the wage subject to the demand curve\nimplied by the labour aggregator. Let w\nj\ndenote the probability that a wage set in period\nt is still in place in period t + j. The first order condition for the wage can be expressed\nin terms of the stationary variable w\nt\n W\nt\nWt\nas:\nw\nt\n=\n\n\nEt\nw\nj\nj w\nt,t+j\nt+j\nEt\nw\nj\nj w\nt,t+j\n Lt+j\nC-\nt+j\nwr\nt+j\nw\nt,t+j\n\n\nHere, w\nt,t+j\n j\nw\nt+k\n, i.e wage inflation between periods t and t + j. At any point in\ntime there are Jw\nsuch conditions determining the aggregate wage index, corresponding\nto the FOC of wage setters in the current and previous J - 1 periods.\nThe first order conditions log-linearized around a steady state with zero wage inflation\nis:\nw\nt\n= Et\njw\nj\nw\n^\n\u00b5t+j\n+\nw\nj\nw\nw\nt+j\nwith: w =\njw\nj\n, w\nj\n=\nk=j\nkw\nk\nWe use ^\n\u00b5t\nas shorthand for the difference between the marginal rate of substitution and\nthe real wage: ^\n\u00b5t\n ^\nLt\n+  ^\nCt\n- ^\nwr\nt\n. From the definition of the wage index Wt\n\nWt\n1- we obtain\nw\nj\nw\nt-j\n-\nw\nj\nw\nt-j\nwith: w\nj\n=\nw\nk\nThe familiar framework of Calvo contracts obtains as a special case of this general\nscheme. In particular, Jp =  and the adjustment probability is time invariant j\n=\n, for j = 1, 2, .... Similarly for wage setting, there is a time invariant adjustment\nprobability w\n. One could numerically simulate the economy with Calvo (1983) contracts\nby truncating the infinite sums for some large integer Jp and Jw. However, one can exploit\nthe recursive representation of the infinite geometric sums to obtain the well-known wage\nand price Phillips curves.\nt\n=\n\nXt\n+ Et\nw\nt\n=\n)\n\u00b5t\n+ Et\nw\n3.3 A variant of Mankiw and Reiss (2002): Sticky information\nWe build a N-period version of the sticky information scheme by Mankiw and Reis\n(2002). As with Wolman (1999) contracts, the arrival of new information is described\nby a vector , whose elements are the same as in Table 1 for our earlier analysis. The\ngeneric entry j\ndenotes the probability that a firm that last updated its information set\nin period t - j receives a signal to update the information set in period t. In section 5\nthe adjustment probabilities referred to the signal to be allowed to change the contract\nprice. Hence, price setters must choose one price which does well on average over the\nweighted future periods. Sticky information firms can change their price in any period.\nWe can think of the problem of a sticky information agent that receives the most recent\ninformation set as choosing a whole path for the contract wage or price to be applicable\nin the subsequent periods unless the agent receives another update of the information set.\nEquilibrium sequences for allocations and prices in the model with sticky information\nmust then satisfy (32), (35) - (40) as well as the following conditions stemming from wage\nand price setting. There are Jw cohorts of households11, indexed by how many periods\nago they last received an update of their information set. The first order condition of the\noptimal nominal wage chosen by cohort j conditional on the information set at time t - j\nand applicable in t denoted with Wt,t-j\nis:\nt,t-j\nWt,t-j\n- C-\nt\nNt,t-j\nt\nHere, Nt,t-j\nis labour supplied by cohort j, i.e. Nt,t-j\n Wt,t-j\nWt\n-\nLt\n.

Market clear-\ning requires Ct\n= Yt\n, henceforth we drop Ct\n. The model's equilibrium conditions are\nsummarized in the following box.\nYt\n= Et\nt\nw\nt\n=\n)\n\u00b5t\n+ Et\nw\nt\n=\n\nXt\n+ Et\nYt\n= At\n+ (1 - )Lt\nwr\nt\n= Xt\n+ At\n- Lt\nwr\nt\n= wr\n+ w\nt\n- t\nXt\n=\n + \n+  Yt\n- Y \nt\n- Lt\n+ Yt\n- wr\nt\n^\nRn\nt\n^\nYt\n- ^\nY \nt\n^\nt\n^\nRn\n+ vt\nAt\n+ ut\nUpper case letters denote the aggregate of the respective lower case variables. (32)\nis the consumption Euler equation. (33) and (34) are the wage and price Phillips curves.\n(35) is the log-linearized aggregate production function. (36) is the firm's labour demand\nfunction. (37) is an identity defining the change of the real wage. (38) links marginal cost\nto the output gap and the \"wage gap\". (39) is the monetary policy rule. Finally, the last\nequation is the exogenous stochastic process for total factor productivity.\nWe now turn to the calibration. A time period is taken to be a quarter. The average\nduration of newly set price contracts is set to 2 quarters. This number is somewhat smaller\nthan the average duration in most recent calibrated monetary models12. It reflects survey\nevidence by Bills and Klenow (2004) pointing to much more price flexibility in the U.S.\neconomy than typically assumed in the literature. Bills and Klenow (2004) find that half\nof all prices last 5 months or less when excluding temporary sales. For wage contracts\nwe follow Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) and much of the literature and set the av-\nerage duration to 4 quarters. A recent micro study by Rich and Tracey (2004) suggests\nthat U.S. wage contracts last on average 10 quarters, with a significant fraction of con-\ntracts negotiated annually. We do not calibrate the average contract duration to the data\nfor the purpose of comparisons with the existing studies on wage stickiness, that almost\nuniversally assume annual contract duration.\nThe time preference rate is matched to yield an annual gross real interest rate of 1.03,\ni.e.  = 1.03-0.25. The markup is calibrated to 15% in both goods and labour markets,\nresulting in  = = 7.66. This value is intermediate in the range employed by other\nters.\nmarkup of 20%. The labour share in production 1 -  is set to the standard value 0.65.\nWe assume a Frisch (constant marginal utility of wealth) elasticity of labour supply of 1\n(implying  = 3), which is in line with most empirical estimates ranging between 0 and\n0.5 as surveyed in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999). We set the coefficient of relative risk\naversion  to 2. This is a compromise between experimental evidence by Barsky, Juster,\nKimball, and Shapiro (1997) who find a mean risk aversion of roughly 4 and the value of\n1 commonly chosen in RBC models. The exogenous process for technology follows an\nAR(1) with autoregressive parameter equal to 0.9. The innovation has standard deviation\nof the monetary policy shock is set to 0.0025. Since the welfare costs of nominal rigidities\nare highly sensitive to the monetary policy rule in place, we consider 3 different rules. The\nreaction coefficients describing these three rules are summarized in Table 2. Rule 1 is our\nTable 2: The considered interest rate rules\nwith this monetary policy rule as our baseline model. Rule 2 is an estimated rule where\nthe response to the output gap is restricted to zero. The reason is that the output gap is\ntypically only marginally significant or even insignificant and that the adverse welfare\neffects of reacting to a wrong measure of the gap can be very large, see Schmitt-Groh\u00b4\ne\nand Uribe (2004). We finally consider the classical Taylor (1993) rule as a prominent\nbenchmark from the literature.\nThe model is too stylized to estimate its parameters or rigorously calibrate them to\nthe data. However, we note that the overall amount of volatility present in the model is\nroughly comparable to the data. For instance, the baseline calibration implies that the\nstandard deviation of consumption and hours worked in the model are 0.017 and 0.012,\nrespectively. Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) report that these numbers are 0.016\nand 0.014 in detrended U.S. data. Extensive sensitivity analysis with respect to the key\nparameters is documented in the appendix.\n13All data is taken from the FRED2 database. The interest rate is the end of quarter federal funds\nrate available at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FEDFUNDS/downloaddata/FEDFUNDS.txt. It\nis converted to quarterly decimal rate by dividing by 400. The output gap is constructed as the log differ-\nence between quarterly real GDP and potential real GDP as constructed by the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe series are available at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPC96/downloaddata/GDPC96.txt\nand http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPPOT2/downloaddata/GDPPOT2.txt, respectively. In-\nflation is constructed as the log of the first difference of the GDP price index available at\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPCTPI/downloaddata/GDPCTPI.txt. All data except potential\nGDP are seasonally adjusted. All coefficients are significant at standard levels.\n5 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities\nThis section computes welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations stemming from nom-\ninal rigidities in wage and price setting. The welfare measure is the expected lifetime\nutility of a randomly drawn household. We follow Rotemberg and Woodford (1999) and\nassume that utility flow from real money balances is negligible. Define period utility Wt\nas\nWt\n\nC-\nt\n+\nt\n(h)\nLet W\nt\ndenote period utility under perfectly flexible wages and prices. The consump-\ntion equivalent welfare measure L  -E \nt (Wt\n- W\nt\n) / UC\n\u00af\nC can be approxi-\nmated up to second order by the following weighted sum of second moments:\nL = E\n\nt\n\n~\np\nj\np t-j\n+ ~\n^\nYt\n- ^\nY \nt\n+ ~\nw\nj\nw t-j\n\nwith: ~\n=\n, ~\n=\n + \n+  , ~\n=\nE denotes unconditional expectation. Here, p\nt-j\n P\nt-j\n- Pt\nand similarly for w t-j\n.\nL gives the onetime increase in consumption, expressed as a percentage of period con-\nsumption in the steady state, necessary to make agents as well off in a world with nominal\nrigidities as in a world with perfectly flexible wages and prices. Since this loss function is\nfree of first moments, it can be accurately (up to second-order) evaluated by considering\na linear approximation to the model's equilibrium conditions.\nFor Calvo (1983) contracts, we have JP = JW =  and we could compute welfare\nby truncating at some large integer. Instead we work with the well-known equivalent\nrepresentation:\nL = E\n\n^\nt\n^\nYt\n- ^\nY \nt\nw\nt\nHere, the weights are given by\n=\n\n=\n + \n=\nw\n)\n.\nNote that the weight on wage dispersion (~\n) is roughly 15 times larger than the weight\non price dispersion (~\n) for our benchmark calibration. The higher weight attached to\nwage dispersion depends on the labour supply elasticity. With sticky wages labour sup-\nply is demand determined. The inverse of the labour supply elasticity signals how much\ncompensation the household requires for supplying an extra unit of labour. When wages\nare sticky, households are induced to vary their labour supply without any such compen-\nsation taking place.14 Therefore, it is clear that the inverse of the labour supply elasticity\n14An indirect compensation takes place, since firms make higher profits when workers are paid a wage\nthat is off their labour supply schedule.\nis closely related to the welfare cost of wage inflation. For instance, setting  = 1 brings\nthe weight on wage inflation relative to price inflation down to 3.1 for our benchmark\ncalibration. Other important parameters determining the weights on wage and price dis-\npersion are the elasticities  and . The higher these parameter, the more substitutable are\ndifferent varieties of labour in production. Since welfare is decreasing in the dispersion\nof goods or labour across varieties, a given amount of dispersion of relative prices results\nin lower welfare when goods are more substitutable.\nWe next address whether choosing the average contract duration rather than the av-\nerage age as a metric to make contracting schemes comparable influences our welfare\ncomparison systematically.\n5.1 Average duration or average age?\nChoosing the average contract duration as our metric for making different schemes com-\nparable implies that the average time elapsed since last adjustment in a cross-section (the\naverage age) is different across schemes.15 In particular Calvo (1983) contracts have a\nhigher average age in a cross-section than Taylor (1980) contracts, despite the fact that\nthe expected duration of a contract is the same. For instance, our Calvo (1983) wage\ncontracts with  = 3\nare on average 4 quarters old, whereas our 4 periods Taylor (1980)\ncontracts are on average 2.5 quarters old. It is therefore of interest to find out how the\nwelfare costs of nominal rigidities depend on the average contract age.\nWe show that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities under Calvo (1983) contracts are\nnon-monotonic in the average age of contracts. The following graph plots the welfare\ncosts of nominal rigidities as a function of the probability  that the random signal to\nchange the contract is not received. Both the average age in a cross section and the\naverage duration of Calvo (1983) contracts are equal to 1\n.\nTwo effects influence the welfare costs, when agents can adjust their contracts less\noften. More agents keep their contract fixed and therefore do no respond optimally to\ncurrent period shocks. That effect tends to increase the welfare costs. However, those\nagents that currently receive a signal to change their contract are attaching more weight\nto economic conditions farther into the future as their contract is fixed for a longer period.\nThey therefore tend to also be less responsive to current economic conditions and that\neffect works to decrease relative price dispersion. The result is a non-monotonic relation\ndepicted in the above figures. Apparently, the two mentioned effects interact strongly\nwith monetary policy as the location of the peak depends on the monetary policy rule in\nThe message of this simple plot is as follows. When comparing welfare costs across\ndifferent contracting scheme holding fixed the average contract duration we are in effect\ncomparing schemes with different average ages in a cross-section. However, on average\n15For the Calvo (1983) contracts both the expected lifetime of a newly set contract and the average age\nof contracts in a cross-section are equal to the inverse of the reset probability. For N period Taylor (1980)\ncontracts the expected lifetime is N and the average age is N+1\n.\n16If the shock has zero autocorrelation, than economic conditions in the period of the shock are most\ndifferent from those in the following periods. Therefore, the peak of the plot of the welfare costs with\nrespect to the average contract duration should occurs earlier than with highly correlated shocks. Numerical\nresults support this and therefore tend to support our line of intuitive argument.\nwelfare cost\nprob(keep wage fixed)\nFigure 3: Welfare costs with sticky wages and flexible prices\nolder Calvo (1983) contracts do not necessarily imply higher welfare costs than on average\nyounger Calvo (1983) contracts, as the plot shows.\nThis hump shaped relation between contract duration and the welfare costs of nominal\nrigidities is not specific to Calvo (1983) contract. Similar plots hold for Taylor (1980)\ncontracts, but the shape and the location of the peak differ.\n5.2 Welfare costs of sticky contracting schemes\nTable 3 displays the welfare cost of nominal inertia for the considered contracting schemes.\nIn that table, we express the welfare cost in terms of a per period compensation17 and as\na fraction of 1 per cent. We consider two comparisons. In the first one, we hold the aver-\nage duration of newly set contracts constant across schemes as is typical in the literature\n(see Kiley (2002)). In the second one, we modify the vector  of adjustment probabili-\nties such that the average age in a cross section is equal across schemes. The particular\naverage we choose is that of 2 period Taylor price contracts and 4 period Taylor wage\ncontracts, i.e. 1.5 and 2.5. Note that requiring equal average age as the Taylor scheme\ninvolves shortening the average duration of the other schemes.\nThe first two rows of Table 3 show that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities may dif-\nfer strongly across the considered contracting schemes when the average duration is held\nfix. This supports the view that the exact nature of price and wage contracting schemes\ncan be important for the quantification of the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. In par-\nticular, under Taylor (1980) contracts the welfare costs are roughly of the same magnitude\nas suggested by Lucas (2003), approximately 0.07 of one per cent of period consumption.\nHowever, for the Calvo (1983) scheme they are roughly 3-4 times higher. The truncated\n17Given our unconditional welfare measure, per period welfare compensation and lifetime compensation\nare proportional with proportionality factor 1 - \nwelfare cost\nprob(keep price fixed)\nFigure 4: Welfare costs with sticky prices and flexible wages\nTable 3: Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - mobile capital\nrule L (Calvo) L (tr. Calvo) L (Taylor) L (Wolman)\nsame average duration\nsame average age in cross section\nage distribution of contracts deliver costs that are somewhat in between the costs implied\nHowever, considering rule 3 shows that the Calvo (1983) scheme need not always have\nthe highest welfare costs. This is in stark contrast to the unambiguous results for the case\nof trend inflation in the comparison between Calvo (1983) and Taylor (1980) contracts\nin the work of Kiley (2002). In his steady state analysis, the prices farther out in tail of\nthe age distribution of the Calvo (1983) scheme differ more and more from the aggregate\nprice level due to the trend in the general price level. The Taylor (1980) scheme truncates\nthat tail and therefore necessarily implies smaller welfare costs. The conjecture by Kiley\n(2002) that this basic insight would carry over to a welfare comparison over the business\ncycle18 cannot be supported by our analysis. Must a contracting scheme that features a\nwider support of the age distribution necessarily imply more dispersion of relative prices\n18Kiley (2002, p.291) conjectures that the gains from inflation stabilization policies in the model of Erceg,\nHenderson, and Levin (2000) may be overstated due the choice of Calvo (1983) contracts.\nor relative wages? Without trend inflation (or with full indexation to the trend inflation\nrate) our results suggest the answer is no.\nThe intuition is as follows and similar to the one in the previous subsection. When the\nage distribution has larger support, there are some agents that charge prices set farther in\nthe past. Their contract price tends to be more out of line with current conditions. While\nthat typically increases the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther\ninto the future and also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions.\nTherefore widening the support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme\nhas an ambiguous effect on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare. Whether\ncontracts with a large support of the age distribution or a small support have higher welfare\ncosts depends on the exact model dynamics, in particular on the monetary policy rule and\non the persistence of the shocks.\nFinally, we note that by requiring that all schemes have an equal average age in a\ncross-section, the difference in welfare costs across schemes is somewhat smaller. In\nparticular, the Calvo (1983) scheme now yields the highest welfare costs throughout all 3\nmonetary policy rules considered.19\n5.3 Welfare costs of sticky information schemes\nThe loss function for the sticky information model is the again of the form (42). In that\nformula, one must simply substitute p\nt-j\nwith the expectation based on the information\nt - j periods ago of the optimal price and w\nt-j\nwith the expectation based on the in-\nformation t - j periods ago of the optimal wage. In the following table we display the\nwelfare losses associated with different monetary policy rules and different assumptions\nabout the arrival rates of new information. These arrival rates are the ones described in\nTable 4: Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - sticky information\nrule L (tr. Calvo) L (Taylor) L(Wolman)\nsame average duration\nsame average age\nTable 4 shows that the welfare costs of Mankiw and Reis (2002) price and wage setting\nare typically very small. Apparently, the amount of price and wage dispersion induced by\n19Extensive sensitivity analysis suggests that this is the case for a lot of parameter configurations, but\nnot for all. Even when requiring an equal average age, Calvo (1983) contracts may for some parameter\nconfiguration yield higher costs than Taylor (1980) contracts.\nthe exogenous restrictions on the ability to reset contracts is much higher than the disper-\nsion induced by restricting the arrival of new information. Qualitatively, this result should\nnot be surprising. After all sticky information agents will typically choose to post a new\nprice or wage even when they do not receive any new information about the state of the\nworld. They use optimally the information available in the period they last updated their\ninformation set to infer about the state of the world today. Thus, the sticky information\nframework typically involves less contract rigidity. The quantitative differences pointed\nout here are important since more ad-hoc models of nominal rigidities are sometimes jus-\ntified by arguing that agents have imperfect capacities to constantly compute and post\nthe optimal price. Our comparison suggests it may well make a difference for welfare\ncomparisons whether one explicitly models imperfect ability to process information as in\nMankiw and Reis (2002) or resorts to more ad-hoc models of price setting.\n6 Robustness\nSo far we have assumed that capital is freely mobile across firms and can be re-allocated\nas to equalize the shadow value of capital. Danthine and Donaldson (2002), Woodford\n(2003, p.166) and others have pointed out that capital cannot be costlessly and instanta-\nneously relocated across firms. Danthine and Donaldson (2002) view it as unreasonable\nthat it is too costly to post a new price tag, but that it is costless to unbolt machinery and\nship it between firms.20. Here, we check how the welfare cost of nominal rigidities across\nthe considered schemes depends on the mobility of capital.\nFor the purpose of business cycle analysis, capital might better be modeled as being\ncompletely fixed at the firm level on a quarterly frequency. The problem of the firm is to\nchoose its optimal nominal price P\nt\n(z) subject to the demand curve and the production\nfunction to maximize\nmax\nP\nt\n(z)\nEt\nJp\np\nt+i\niC-\nt+i\n)\nP\nt\n(z)\nPt+i\nYt+i\n- Zt+i\nK(z) - wr\nt+i\nLt+i\nThe first order condition for this problem is:\nEt\nJp\np\nt+i\niC-\nt+i\nP\nt\nPt+i\nYt+i\n+\nwr\nt+i\nLt+i\nWith firm specific capital and Calvo (1983) pricing, the Phillips Curve is now given by:\nt\n=\n\n(1 -  +  )\nXa\nt\n+ Et\nHere, ^\nXa\nt\nis average marginal cost. Since capital is fixed at the firm level, the capital-\nlabour ratio differs across firms and so does marginal cost. While the slope of the price\n20Furthermore, Eichenbaum and Fischer (2004) show that departing from the assumption of perfect cap-\nital mobility is necessary to reconcile the Calvo (1983) model with the data. Sveen and Weinke (2004)\nand Woodford (2005) further discuss the implications of modeling capital for the equilibrium dynamics in\nsticky prices models\nPhillips curve becomes much flatter, the weight on price inflation in the loss function\nbecomes larger. In particular, the slope of the Phillips curve decreases by a factor (1-)\n,\nwhile the weight in the welfare function increases by exactly the inverse of that factor. A\ngiven amount of inflation variability is roughly 5 times more costly than with mobile\ncapital for our benchmark values of  and . The same correction factors to the relation\nbetween marginal cost and inflation and the welfare function must be applied for the more\ngeneral price setting model of Wolman (1999).\nThe reason why the weight in the welfare increases is as follows. Firm specific capital\nimplies that a given dispersion in relative quantities results in a much bigger dispersion\nof labour across firms. Capital is fixed at the firm level, the firm can only adjust labour\nto vary production. Since labour has decreasing marginal product in production at the\nlevel of the individual firm, the dispersion of labour across firms is welfare reducing.21\nTherefore, the weight attached to price inflation rises strongly with firm specific capital.\nTo understand why the the slope of the Phillips curve falls, consider the problem of a firm\nthat receives a signal to change its price. By setting a lower price than the fixed price firms\nit can attract additional demand. But with firm specific capital marginal cost depends on\nthe firms' own level of production while it only depends on the aggregate production level\nwith a common rental market. Therefore, the firm will choose a relative price that deviates\nfrom unity by less when marginal cost depends on own output and therefore on its relative\nprice. As a result the variance of price inflation is smaller with firm specific capital.22\nTable 5: Welfare costs of nominal rigidities - immobile capital\nrule L (Calvo) L (tr. Calvo) L (Taylor) L (Wolman)\nsame average duration\nsame average age\nTable 5 displays the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for the case of immobile cap-\nital. Whether we model capital as fixed at the firm level or assume a rental market does\nnot have a large effect on the welfare cost for the benchmark calibration of this model.\nThis result depends crucially on the concavity of the production function with respect to\nlabour, i.e. on . The welfare loss with firm specific capital increases monotonically as \napproaches unity, but remains bounded when we assume a rental market. For  close to\nunity the welfare costs with firm specific capital can therefore be much larger than under\n21If  = 0 production is linear in labour and capital does not enter the production function. One can\ndouble check that our correction factor seems correct, by noting that it reduces to unity in that case as\nintuition suggests it should.\n22See Kimball (1995) for a discussion of assumption on factor markets on price setting and Ball and\nRomer (1990) for the seminal paper on real rigidities.\nthe rental market assumption. The table shows that the loss with firm specific capital is\ngenerally somewhat lower for the policy rules considered, but the difference is not huge.\nIn broad terms, the picture emerging from Table 3 is similar to that from Table 5. In par-\nticular, how we model capital does not seem to matter much for the relative welfare costs\nof our 4 considered schemes.\n7 Summary and conclusion\nOur main findings have already been summarized in the introduction. Here, we only\nbriefly sketch the papers main contributions.\nOverall, we find that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities depend very strongly\non the particular scheme used for introducing nominal rigidities. Contrary to the find-\ning of Kiley (2002) for the case of trend inflation we do not find that the Calvo (1983)\nschemes necessarily overstates the welfare costs of nominal rigidities relative to contract-\ning schemes with a smaller support of the age distribution. In the baseline parameteriza-\ntion of the model, Calvo (1983) contracts give rise to welfare costs of nominal rigidities\nthat are more than 3 times as high as for Taylor (1980) contracts. However, there are\nmonetary policy rules for which Calvo (1983) contracts may also imply similar or even\nslightly smaller welfare costs over the business cycle than Taylor (1980) contracts. The\nintuition for this result is as follows. When the age distribution has larger support, there\nare some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract price tends to be\nmore out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect typically increases\nthe welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther into the future and\nalso charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions. Therefore widening\nthe support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme has an ambiguous\nimpact on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare.\nWe show how the welfare costs of nominal rigidities and the relative welfare costs\nacross modeling schemes depend surprisingly little on capital mobility. As discussed,\nthe reason is that immobile capital strongly increases the welfare cost of a given amount\nof dispersion of relative prices but also generates less equilibrium price dispersion. We\nfinally analyze the welfare costs implied by the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and\nReis (2002). We apply the same restrictions on the availability of information costs as we\ndid in our earlier analysis on the ability to change contracts. The resulting welfare costs\nof the sticky information scheme however are much smaller.\nAppendix\nIn this section we document the sensitivity analysis undertaken. We present surface plots\nof the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for the Calvo (1983) scheme and of the Calvo\n(1983) scheme relative to the Taylor (1980) scheme when varying two parameters while\nkeeping the others at their benchmark value. We show that the welfare costs of nominal\nrigidities are increasing in the inverse of the Frish elasticity of labour supply , the coeffi-\ncient of relative risk aversion  as well as the substitutability among differentiated labour\n and among differentiated goods . The economic explanation for this has been given in\nthe text, it is not repeated here.\nHowever, for any value of these key parameters governing the level of the welfare cost\nand given our benchmark monetary policy rule the welfare costs implied by Calvo (1983)\ncontracts are always roughly 2-4 times higher than those of Taylor (1980) contracts.\nrisk aversion\nsensitivity analysis for the Calvo model\nFrish elasticity\nwelfare cost\nFigure 5: Sensitivity 1: Inverse of Frish elasticity and relative risk aversion\nrisk aversion\nRatio Calvo Cost to Taylor Cost\nFrish elasticity\nwelfare cost\nFigure 6: Sensitivity 1: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor\ngoods substitutability\nsensitivity analysis for the Calvo model\nlabor substitutability\nwelfare cost\nFigure 7: Sensitivity 2: Substitutability of differentiated labour and goods\ngoods substitutability\nRatio Calvo Cost to Taylor Cost\nlabor substitutability\nwelfare cost\nFigure 8: Sensitivity 2: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor\ninflation response\nsensitivity analysis for the Calvo model\ngap response\nwelfare cost\nFigure 9: Sensitivity 3: Inflation response and Output gap response\ninflation response\nRatio Calvo Cost to Taylor Cost\ngap response\nwelfare cost\nFigure 10: Sensitivity 3: Welfare costs of Calvo relative to Taylor\nReferences\nASCARI, G.
