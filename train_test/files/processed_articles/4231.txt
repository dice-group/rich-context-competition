    "abstract": "Abstract\nInfluences of educational level and gender were examined through free drawings. A total of 216 participants were recruited\nranging from nursery school to university students. Using an adaptation of Turgeon's methodology, participants were given\na standardized set of colored pens and asked to draw a picture. Pictures were analyzed for the area of the page covered,\ncolors used, number of colors used, and content. Overall, females covered more of the page, and used more colors than\nmales. Females drew significantly more sky, flowers/trees and buildings (in most cases houses), and males drew more people\nand vehicles. In relation to educational level, nursery children used fewer colors than the other groups and secondary school\nchildren used more colors than primary school children. It was concluded that gender differences in content, and color, of\ndrawings exist and these differences remain stable into adulthood. Results are discussed in terms of social and evolutionary\ntheory.\n",

Toddlers enjoy scribbling with different colors\nwhile children begin to draw more realistic drawings around\nage 4. This process continues to evolve into and beyond ado-\nlescence (Lowenfeld & Brittain, 1987). Age is an important\nfactor in drawing as holding a pencil and drawing precisely\nrequires the finger muscles and general motor control to be\nsufficiently developed. This is said to happen around the age\nLowenfeld and Brittain (1987) present a comprehensive\naccount of drawing, outlining six stages of artistic develop-\nment in children, referring to concepts such as age appropri-\nateness and reflection. Stages are referenced against the\nchild's age, or expected stage of development. These begin\nwith the scribbling stage (demonstrated by children aged 2 to\n4 years), followed by the preschematic stage (age 4 to 7)\nwhere children are thought to show their first attempts at rep-\nresentational drawings (e.g., a drawing of a person with a\ncircular head and \"stick\" legs), then the schematic stage (age\n7 to 9) where they demonstrate concepts and are much more\nconfident in their drawings as they resemble objects more\nthan before. Children between 9 and 11 years are \"gang age,\"\nalso referred to as the preadolescent crisis, and their draw-\nings reflect how things actually look and are expressed in\ndetail, they also become critical of their drawings at this\nstage. Between 11 and 13 years, children reach the age of\nreasoning. During this stage, Lowenfeld and Brittain identify\nthat children's art becomes less of a \"spontaneous process.\"\nThe final stages of this model (which approximately span the\nyears of puberty, around ages 12 to 17 years) involve more\ndetail, precision, and perspective. The pseudo-naturalistic\nstage involves the depiction of perspective, 3D objects, shad-\ning, and attempts to demonstrate motion. The final stage of\nthe model is the adolescent art stage demonstrated by adoles-\ncents aged 14 to 17 years of age, and is said to refer to the\ncrisis of adolescence. Drawings at this stage can span a num-\nber of styles. It is at this stage that natural development is\nsaid to stop unless a conscious decision is made to continue\ndrawing (Lowenfeld & Brittain, 1987). Based on Lowenfeld\nand Brittain's model, we would expect little difference\nbetween the drawings of adolescents and adults. For exam-\nple, Lowenfeld and Brittain state that once individuals are in\nthe final adolescent art stage, skill will only improve if the\nindividual has both the opportunity, and desire, to do this. In\naddition, Nicholls and Kennedy (1992) examined cube\ndrawing in children and adults and found that there was no\n1University of Abertay, Dundee, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nLynn Wright, Evolutionary and Biological Approaches to Behaviour\nResearch Group, School of Social and Health Sciences, Division of\nPsychology, University of Abertay, Bell Street, Dundee, Scotland, DD1\nEmail: l.wright@abertay.ac.uk\nMonochrome Males and Colorful Females:\nDo Gender and Age Influence the Color\nand Content of Drawings?\nLynn Wright1 and Fiona Black1\n Keywords\ndrawing, gender, age, educational level\n2 SAGE Open\ndifference between the drawings of 14- and 15-year-old indi-\nviduals and adults. They explained that more sophisticated\ngeometry knowledge in the older children allowed them to\nproduce similar cubes to the adults. Therefore, knowledge of\nangles, perspective, and scale in adolescents and adults might\nhelp explain why their drawings would be expected to be\nsimilar.\nLowenfeld and Brittain's stages focus on the process of\ndrawing and reflection of the art work, rather than the con-\ntent and color of the drawings. For example, if a drawing is\nof a dog then the focus would be on the age appropriateness\nof the drawing. Analyses may be carried out in a number of\nadditional ways to provide us with further rich information\nregarding the artists and their drawings. One important ele-\nment that Lowenfeld and Brittain did not focus on was gen-\nder differences. Indeed, it is the case that very little research\nexamines color and pictorial content beyond the elementary\nyears.\nSeveral researchers have reported differences relating to\ncontent and color of drawings by male and female children.\nIijima, Arisaka, Minamoto, and Arais (2001) reported that\nmales aged 5 to 6 years used fewer colors in their drawings\nthan females, and used more grays and blues, while females\npreferred pink and flesh colors. Milne and Greenway (1999)\nreported that older male children (between 10 and 14 years)\nused fewer colors compared with younger males (under 10\nyears); however, older and younger females used an equal\nnumber of colors. They suggested that pubertal males use\nfewer colors due to the inhibition of emotional responses at\nthis time. Ellis and Ficek (2001) found that male college stu-\ndents preferred to use cold colors such as blue and green,\nwhile females preferred warm colors such as red and yellow.\nThere is an argument that sex differences in color preference\nmay be related to the evolutionary division of labor with\nfemales evolving to identify yellow fruit, red leaves, and red\nand purple berries in their role of gatherer (Hurlbert & Ling,\nthat males preferred blue and green, whereas females pre-\nferred pink, purple, and white. They also relate their findings\nto the hunter-gatherer theory stating that men, as hunters,\nprefer blue and green, which are considered calm colors and\nare related to the natural environment such as the blue sky.\nWomen, as gatherers, prefer pink, purple, and white, which\nare said to be warm and peaceful colors.\nTurgeon (2008) examined drawings by elementary school\nchildren and found that boys used more cold colors (e.g.,\nblack and gray), while girls used more pink, purple, and yel-\nlow in their drawings. Previous research has demonstrated\nthat younger children prefer warm colors but as they get\nolder preference shifts to cooler colors. A common method\nof investigating color preference is presenting pairs of colors\nto participants and asking for their preference. When using\nthis method, Child, Hansen, and Hornbeck (1968) reported\nthat children between the ages of 6 to 18 years preferred\ncooler colors. Although most research on color preference\nhas been carried out with children, several studies have\nexamined color preference in adults. Ellis and Ficek's (2001)\nwork examined color preference in college students while\nSilver and Ferrante (1995) reported that retired male and\nfemales' favorite color was blue. However, when carrying\nout research with older adults additional factors have to be\naddressed such as quality of eye sight and potential color\nperception difficulties. Dittmar (2001) asked adults ranging\nfrom 19 to 90 years to choose their preferred and least pre-\nferred color. Older and younger groups preferred blue but\nolder participants preferred green over red, and younger par-\nticipants preferred red over green. Dittmar suggested that\nchanges in color preference could be explained by social\ninfluence; older participants spend more time gardening or\non walks outside that may influence their preference for the\ncolor green. Finally, Silver et al. (1988) examined color pref-\nerence among college students and concurred that males\nchose blue as their favorite color more than females did. The\ncontent of children's drawings has also been investigated.\nWillats (2005) stated that young children draw familiar\nobjects while older children draw what they see. Iijima et al.\n(2001) found that boys preferred to draw mobile and mechan-\nical objects such as cars and rockets, while girls preferred to\ndraw people and flowers. Turgeon (2008) found that females\npreferred to draw flowers, sky, and animals, while boys pre-\nferred to draw people. All of the previous studies examined\nthe content of drawings by children who were under 9 years\nof age, and thus it is relatively unknown whether the content\nof adolescent's and young adult's drawings would continue\nto demonstrate similar sex differences. Young female chil-\ndren have been reported to use more of the page than males\nwhen asked to draw a picture (Iijima et al., 2001; Turgeon,\n2008). Female's drawings are often larger but much of the\narea is taken up by details such as grass and sky that expand\nto cover the whole page. To date, no study has examined the\ncontent of adults' free drawings outside of a clinical setting.\nAside from the evolutionary derived hypotheses (e.g.,\nHurlbert & Ling, 2007), sex differences can be explained\nthrough biological and social theories. Biological theory\nhypothesizes that gender differences are present from birth\nand are influenced by prenatal androgens such as testoster-\none (Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, &\nManning, 2004) while social theory indicates that we learn\ngender roles through observing others, and via sex role\nsocialization through education and the media (Katz &\nences across a range of ages could signify that drawing has a\nbiological basis due to prenatal androgen exposure. This is\nsupported by the work of Iijima et al. (2001) who reported\nthat females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH;\ncaused by exposure to higher levels of prenatal androgens)\ndrew more masculine pictures.\nKoller (2008) discussed color preference in the context of\nsocial theory. Products marketed at women were examined\nand shown to consist of warm colors and soft shapes, whereas\nWright and Black 3\nproducts marketed at men consisted of colder colors and\nangular shapes.\nCherney, Seiwert, Dickey, and Flichtbeil (2006) state that\nchildren's drawings can be influenced by their education,\nculture, and society. They state that cultural and society\ninfluences can be expressed in drawings through the type of\nclothing depicted in drawings of people. Girls were also\nmore likely to add detail to drawings that were seen to be\nrelatively stereotypical, such as jewelry, specific hair styles,\nand details such as fingernails on hands. La Vooy et al. (2001)\nexamined the drawings of Japanese and American children\nfor the number of smiles included, and found that American\nchildren were more likely to include smiles in their draw-\nings. La Vooy et al. and Cherney et al. (2006) looked at the\nheights of humans depicted in drawings and found that\nfemale children tended to draw larger human figures. Both\nstudies concluded that the depiction of larger human figures\ncould relate to increased self-esteem and the individual's\nworth in their culture.\nA question remains as to whether gender differences in\nfree drawing content and color preference continue to be evi-\ndent throughout adolescence and into adulthood. Most stud-\nies examining color use and content in drawing involve\nrelatively young children, or studies that do involve adults\noften examine neuropsychological measures such as clock\ndrawing (e.g., Hubbard et al., 2008), figure drawing (e.g.,\nGuez, Lev-Wiesel, Valetsky, Sztul, & Pener, 2010), or evalu-\nate changes in the ability to draw the human figure across the\nlife span (e.g., Ericsson, Winblad, & Nilsson, 2001).\nTo investigate effects of educational level (age) and gen-\nder, we examined drawings of nursery school, primary\nschool, and secondary school pupils (all in their final year of\nstudy) along with University students (in their penultimate\nyear of study). Each person was asked to complete a free\ndrawing and had the choice of a standard set of 10 colored\npens. Drawings were analyzed for the area of page covered,\ncontent (using an adaptation of categories defined by\nTurgeon, 2008), number of colors used, and actual colors\nused. The content of nursery children's drawings was not\nexamined due to the lack of pictorial content. Based on pre-\nvious findings it was predicted that females would cover a\nlarger area of the page, females would use more colors in\ntheir drawings, males and females would use different colors\nin their drawings and would draw different types of pictures.\nIt was also predicted that educational level (age) would affect\ndrawing content and that the number of colors used and the\nactual colors used would change with age, particularly\naround puberty.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 216 participants took part in the study: 47 nursery\n51 years--mean age 21 years). This research was carried out\nin Scotland, UK.\nMaterials\nA standard set of 10 different colored felt tip pens were given\nto participants (black, gray, blue, pink, red, yellow, orange,\nbrown, green, and purple) along with a blank sheet of\nA4 paper. The area of the page was assessed using a Perspex\nparticipant's gender, age, and education group were recorded.\nPermission and full ethical clearance was given to carry out\nthis research in each educational establishment.\nProcedure\nIn the nursery school condition, children were given a piece\nof A4 paper and the standard set of 10 colored pens and were\nasked to draw a picture. Due to the informal nature, partici-\npants were not given a time limit but were still timed; how-\never, no child took more than 10 min to complete their\ndrawing. In the primary school, secondary school and uni-\nversity condition participants were given an A4 sheet of\npaper, the standard set of 10 colored pens and were given 10\nmin to draw a picture. After 10 min, drawings were collected\nfor analysis. All the data were coded by the experimenters\n(area of the page used, colors used [total number and indi-\nvidual colors] and picture content). A standardized checklist\nwas used to record this information.\nResults\nNumber of Colors Used\nFigure 1 shows that females in every educational group used\nmore colors, on average, than their male counterparts.\nA 2 (gender) \u00d7 4 (education level) between subjects\nANOVA was carried out to investigate the number of colors\nused. There was a significant main effect of gender,\npower = 1, with females using significantly more colors\n(average of eight colors) in their drawings than males (aver-\nage of five colors). There was a significant main effect of\nand observed power = 1. The interaction between gender and\neducation level was not significant F < 1.\nBonferroni t-tests were carried out to investigate the dif-\nferences between levels of education for the number of col-\nors used. Nursery children used significantly fewer colors\nthan the other educational levels (primary school children,\nsecondary school children, and university students; p < .001\n4 SAGE Open\nfor all). Primary school children used fewer colors (on aver-\nage) than secondary school children (p = .008), but there was\nno significant difference in the number of colors used\nbetween primary school children and university students or\nbetween secondary school children and university students.\nFigure 2 shows that the number of colors used by males\nand females across each educational level followed the same\npattern but females used more colors at each stage.\nAdditional independent samples t-tests were carried out\nto examine whether females used more colors than males at\neach educational level. Female nursery school children used\nr = .4, as did female primary school children, t(45) = -5.1,\nArea of Page Covered\nFigure 3 indicates that females in every educational group\ncovered a larger area of the page, on average, than males.\nA 2 (gender) \u00d7 4 (education level) between-subjects\nANOVA was carried out to investigate the area of the page\ncovered. There was a significant main effect of gender,\nwith females covering more area. There was no significant\neffect of education level (p = .09) and no significant interac-\ntion between gender and education level (p = .81)\nIndividual Color Usage\n2 analyses were carried out to investigate the individual\ncolor usage of participants (by gender and by educational\nlevel). Females' drawings were more likely to contain every\ncolor except for black than males'. That is, a higher propor-\ntion of females used pink, purple, blue, green, red, yellow,\ngray, orange, and brown in their drawings than males.\nFigure 1. Mean number of colors used in free drawings by males\nand females across four levels of education.\nFigure 2. Average number of colors used across gender and\neducational groups.\nFigure 3. Mean area (measured by the number of boxes\ncontaining ink) covered in free drawings by males and females\nacross four levels of education.\nWright and Black 5\nInterestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the colors used\nfindings are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\nTable 2 shows that there was a significant difference in\nthe colors used in drawings across education level groups for\nall colors except pink and purple. However, closer inspection\nof Table 2 shows that the differences might be influenced by\nthe nursery group who have lower representations of the col-\nors compared with the other three groups.\nWe therefore removed the nursery group from the 2 anal-\nysis and found that only gray and blue showed a significant\ndifference in appearance in drawings across primary school,\nsecondary school, and university groups (gray: 2 = 14.3,\nMore secondary school students used blue in their pictures\nthan the other groups while fewer primary school pupils used\ngray in their drawings.\nPicture Content\n2 analyses were carried out to investigate the content of par-\nticipant's drawings (by gender and by educational level). It\nwas found that males, irrespective of age, drew more people\ncrv = .3), and females drew more flowers/trees (2 = 4.7,\nWhen examining the educational level, it was found that,\noverall, more primary and secondary school children drew\n= .4) than university students. However, on further analysis,\nit was found that each of these effects was driven by the\nfemale participants. Female primary and secondary school\nchildren, in fact, drew more flowers/trees (p < .001), sports\npictures than female university students. When the content of\nmale drawings was examined across each educational group\nthere were no differences (p > .05 for all categories).\nThe content of drawings by primary school children and\nsecondary school children appeared to be quite similar.\nTherefore, we looked at this selection of data and found that\nonly the number of drawings of people were significantly\nschool children drawing people compared with 34% of pri-\nmary school children.\nThe most popular drawings among female primary school\nchildren and secondary school children were houses and\nflowers/trees while for female university students it was the\nsky and houses. The most popular drawing content among\nprimary school, secondary school, and university males was\npeople. Examples of drawings from each gender and age\ngroup can be seen in Figure 4.\nDiscussion\nIn the current study we examined whether sex differences in\ndrawing production were evident beyond childhood and\nadolescence.\nIt was hypothesized that gender and age would influence\nthe content, color, and size of drawings. Significant differ-\nences were reported for the area of the page that drawings\ncovered, with females using more space than males (irre-\nspective of age), which replicates the findings of Turgeon\n(2008). Analyses of drawings also revealed significant dif-\nferences between males and females in the number of differ-\nent colors used, with females using more colors overall in\ntheir drawings than males. We examined gender differences\nin the number of colors used in the individual educational\ngroups and found that females used significantly more colors\nin each group. This finding supports Turgeon (2008) and\nIijima et al. (2001) who found that young females (age 6 and\nunder) used more colors than males. Nursery school children\n(both genders) used fewer colors in their drawings than the\nother groups and, interestingly, secondary school children\n(males and females) used the most colors. This could be\nattributed to drawings at this stage being more realistic and\nadvanced thus requiring more colors. Male secondary school\nstudents in our sample used an average of seven colors in\ntheir drawings while primary school children used an aver-\nage of five colors. This finding supports Milne and\nGreenway's (1999) research suggesting that male color\nusage fluctuates in relation to emotional response prior to\npuberty. Our secondary school students were aged 16 or\n17 years and arguably these students were at the end of\npuberty, whereas the primary school students (aged 11 or 12\nyears) were at the onset of puberty, which may explain their\nlower color use.\nMilne and Greenway suggested that female emotional\nexpression tends to remain relatively consistent and thus the\nnumber of colors used by females across the different age\ngroups would be similar. In our sample, the average number\nTable 1. 2 Analysis for Individual Colors Used by Males and\nFemales Including Percentage of Colors Used by Each Group.\nColor 2 crv Males (%) Females (%)\nNote. crv = Cramer's V effect size.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 2. 2 Analysis for Individual Colors Used by Education Level Including Percentage of Colors Used by Each Group.\nColor 2 crv Nursery (%) Primary (%) Secondary (%) University (%)\nof colors used by female primary, secondary, and university\nstudents ranged between 8 and 9 (out of a possible 10).\nTurgeon (2008) found that sex differences in color use were\nonly found in older children, but examining our sample for\nsex differences in the number of colors used, we found this\ndifference evident even in the youngest group.\nWe reported nine significant associations between gender\nand individual colors used with females using every color\nmore except for black. In terms of educational level there\nwere relatively few differences in color usage. Overall, nurs-\nery school children used less of each color than the other\nthree groups but interestingly they used as much pink and\npurple in their drawings. This is contrary to Turgeon's find-\nings who reported that students in the second and third grade\nused significantly more pinks and purples than first grade\nand kindergarten students. One reason that might have influ-\nenced this difference could be the number of colors available\nto our sample (10) compared with Turgeon's (24). Turgeon\nrefers to \"pinks\" and \"purples\" suggesting that there were\nmore than one shade of pink and purple available to partici-\npants. Moreover, by increasing the numbers of pens avail-\nable in Turgeon's study, there would be an increased\nlikelihood of the more sophisticated artists--that is, the older\nchildren--using more shades of each color to define and\ndetermine objects in their pictures, thus influencing the age\ndifference in color usage.\nEllis and Ficek (2001) reported that male college students\npreferred to use cold colors such as blue and green, while\nfemales preferred warm colors such as red and yellow. In our\nsample, over three quarters of females used blue and green\ncompared with just over half of males. In fact, warm colors\nsuch as red and yellow were used just as much by males as\ncold colors. In our sample, there is no clear pattern of males\npreferring cold colors and females preferring warm colors.\nEllis and Ficek measured color preference by means of ask-\ning participants what their favorite color was while we\nlooked at color usage in drawings and this may have influ-\nenced findings. We propose that the use of color is influenced\nby the content of the drawing, especially in older groups. It is\ndifficult to make assumptions that colors included in draw-\nings are preferred colors as opposed to functional colors.\nEmbellishing drawings could be one method of identifying\ncolor preference. For example, if a person draws a picture of\na red car, the car color could indicate color preference.\nIn terms of picture content, males drew more people and\nvehicles while females drew more trees/flowers, sky, and\nhouses. The finding that males drew more people supports\nreported that girls were more likely to draw people. Turgeon\nexplained her findings by stating that there was a tendency\nfor the older boys to draw sporting events with people in\nthem. In our sample, 34 males included people in their draw-\nings; however, only 10 of these contained sporting events\nwith people in them. The most common drawing containing\npeople by males was some form of superhero or fireman/\nsoldier. This is perhaps influenced by exposure to television,\nfilms and computer games as well as sex role socialization.\nRecently, there has been an influx of superhero movies, and\nassociated memorabilia (e.g., Iron man, X men, and\nSpiderman to name a few) that are predominantly aimed at a\nyoung male audience, and this perhaps influenced male\ndrawings in our sample. In support of this, Cherney and\nLondon (2006) reported that males watched more masculine\ntelevision programs and watched television for longer than\nfemales. We found that there was no difference in the content\nof male drawings from primary school through to university\nstudents. Female participants' drawing content was similar\nacross the age ranges; however, female primary and second-\nary school pupils drew more houses, flowers and trees, and\nsport than female university students. What is interesting,\nhowever, is that one of the most common drawings in each\nfemale age group was a house indicating that there are simi-\nlarities across each age group.\nPrevious research examined gender differences in relation\nto evolutionary, biological, and social theory. Many research-\ners have found sex differences in drawings from an early age\nand this lends support to biological theory. Our youngest par-\nticipants were 3 years of age, but sex differences were still\nWright and Black 7\nevident. Arguably, this lends support to a biological argu-\nment. Drawings produced by nursery children also support\nsocial theory as the largest difference between individual\ncolor use by males and females was the inclusion of pink and\npurple in drawings. Drawings by nursery children were\nmainly scribbles and this shows evidence of color preference\nrather than content. Male color usage supports social and\nevolutionary theory with more males using blue and green in\ntheir drawings. The colors used least by males were pink and\npurple, which supports sex role socialization. It is difficult to\ndraw conclusions regarding evolutionary theory. Although\nthere is evidence that drawings have evolved in terms of their\nFigure 4. Examples of drawings from educational and gender groups.\n8 SAGE Open\nsophistication, we cannot conclude that females in the sam-\nple, irrespective of age, preferred colors such as yellow, pur-\nple, and red as they used most of the available colors more\nthan males.\nIf Lowenfeld and Brittain's stage theory of drawing is to\nbe supported, we would expect little difference between sec-\nondary school pupil's drawings and university student's\ndrawings as natural development is said to stop around the\nage of 17 years. In the current sample, most similarities in\ndrawings occurred between secondary school pupils and\nuniversity students. There was no difference between the\nnumbers of colors used in the drawings nor was there any\ndifference in the area that their drawings covered. Thus,\nthere seems to be some support for the contention that sec-\nondary school students produce similar drawings to univer-\nsity students.\nOne criticism of the current study is that we only provided\na standard set of 10 colors, while other studies (e.g., Turgeon,\n2008) provided more colors. An increased number of avail-\nable colors would allow further creativity in drawings. We\ncould also have asked participants to name their favorite\ncolor to examine preference differences. In addition, our\nsample consisted of students who were in their final year of\nstudy at nursery, primary, and secondary school and penulti-\nmate year of study at university. Although we found differ-\nences in the drawings of our current participants, examination\nof participants who were closer in age to each other, particu-\nlarly those about to enter, going through, or having just gone\nthrough puberty would be extremely interesting (e.g., partici-\npants aged 10 through to 15 years). Future studies will mea-\nsure digit ratio as an indicator of prenatal testosterone\nexposure. Many of our university students were only 2 or\n3 years older than the secondary school students, but there\nwas a relatively large difference between the primary school\nchildren (aged 10 or 11 years) compared with the secondary\nschool children (aged 16 or 17 years) and the nursery school\nchildren (aged 4 or 5 years). In the current study, we looked\nat a limited sample of ages but it would be interesting to\nrecruit a wider range of participants to examine if these pat-\nterns continue.\nIn summary, these results support sex differences in color\nuse in free drawings irrespective of age, and indicate that\neven after puberty and into adulthood, strong sex differences\nexist in color use and drawing content. At every educational\nstage, females used more colors in their drawings than males,\nand secondary school and university students used more col-\nors than the younger groups. Milne and Greenway state that\nas males approach puberty, their emotional responses are\ninhibited, and this is reflected in the reduced number of col-\nors in their drawings; the current findings lend support to this\nwork. We also found that there is no difference in the content\nof drawings between male primary school, secondary school,\nand university students, so perhaps as previously mentioned,\ncolor reflects the developmental differences in males, rather\nthan content. The content of female participants' drawings\ndiffered slightly, but many contained very detailed, and col-\norful, drawings of houses, which again suggests that drawing\ncontent is similar in adulthood. Therefore, gender differences\nin drawing across a number of age groups show evidence of\nsex role socialization but also lend some support for evolu-\ntionary and biological theory. Future work will allow us to\naddress these theories further.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nCherney, I.
