We focus\nhere on the relationship between internal and\nexternal exposure, with external exposure being\na measure of environmental chemical concen-\ntration in contact with the body. Often, how-\never, biomonitoring data are reported without\ncorresponding external exposure data, leaving\nthe relationship between internal and external\nexposure as one to be determined; establishing\nthis relationship involves the reconstruction of\npast external exposure or dose, from biomoni-\ntoring data collected at some later time. Such\nexposure reconstruction can be addressed at\nboth the individual and the population level. A\nprocedure for determining an estimate of\nexternal exposure consistent with biomonitor-\ning data measured in a population has been\ntermed \"exposure reconstruction\" or \"reverse\ndosimetry.\"\nA population-based estimate of exposure\nshould account for the intrinsic heterogeneity\n(variability) in the population, both in the\nmodeling of the disposition of the chemical\nin the body, and in the description of the\nexposure conditions. Additionally, the bio-\nmonitoring information itself, considered as a\nwhole, should reflect the variability in the\npopulation from which it arises.\nTan et al. (2006) incorporated variability\ninto the reverse dosimetry of chloroform using\na combined physiologically based pharmaco-\nkinetic (PBPK) and shower exposure model,\nwith external exposure calculated using an\nexposure conversion factor (ECF) distribu-\ntion. The ECF distribution was obtained by\ninverting the output of a Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation for chloroform concentration in\nblood using, as input, a preselected reference\nvalue for chloroform concentration in tap\nwater. The product of the ECF distribution\nwith an observed blood concentration pro-\nvides a distribution of tap water concentra-\ntions corresponding to that blood level.\nAlthough the ECF distribution provides a\npopulation estimate of exposure, its accuracy\nis limited to the case in which tissue dose is\nlinearly related to external exposure. In this\narticle, we reconsider the work of Tan et al.\n(2006) with an approach to reverse dosimetry\nusing Bayesian inference in place of the ECF\ndistribution.\nIn addition to the work of Tan et al.\n(2006), exposure reconstruction for chloroform\nusing PBPK modeling has appeared in\nGeorgopoulos et al. (1994) and Roy et al.\n(1996) in the form of a maximum likelihood\ncalculation. In this case, the biological model\nparameters remained as fixed values represent-\ning an average or reference individual and did\nnot account for population variability. The\nreport by Tan et al. (2007) included a calcula-\ntion of chloroform tap water concentration\nusing Bayes' theorem, but with the prior distri-\nbution taken as unity, which reduced Bayes'\ntheorem to a maximum likelihood calculation.\nPrevious work using Bayesian methods\nfor exposure reconstruction for other chemi-\ncals has appeared in Miller et al. (2002), Sohn\nwork of Miller et al. (2002) described a gen-\neral procedure for individual dose reconstruc-\ntion using Bayesian inference and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In\nthis case, the model for chemical disposition\nwas a traditional compartment-based kinetic\nmodel for plutonium-239, which was applied\nto individual exposure reconstruction for\n239Pu from urine measurements. Although\nthe model used was not a PBPK model and\ndid not address population-based measure-\nments and variability, it served as the moti-\nvating example in formulating the details of\nthe method we present in this article.\nSohn et al. (2004) used a PBPK model and\nBayesian inference to reconstruct exposure to\ntrichloroethylene from detailed concentration\u00ad\ntime data for eight individuals. They obtained a\npopulation estimate by treating the individuals\nas a random sample from a larger population\nwithout the use of a hierarchical population\nmodel or the use of MCMC simulation.

The biomonitoring data consist of chloroform blood\nconcentrations measured as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), and for which no corresponding exposure data were collected.\nMETHODS: We used a combined PBPK and shower exposure model to consider several routes and\nsources of exposure: ingestion of tap water, inhalation of ambient household air, and inhalation and\ndermal absorption while showering. We determined posterior distributions for chloroform concen-\ntration in tap water and ambient household air using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Total\nExposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) data as prior distributions for the Bayesian analysis.\nRESULTS: Posterior distributions for exposure indicate that 95% of the population represented by\nthe NHANES III data had likely chloroform exposures  67 \u00b5g/L in tap water and  0.02 \u00b5g/L in\nambient household air.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the application of computer simulation to aid in the inter-\npretation of human biomonitoring data in the context of the exposure\u00adhealth evaluation\u00adrisk\nassessment continuum. These results should be considered as a demonstration of the method and\ncan be improved with the addition of more detailed data.\nKEY WORDS: Bayesian, biomonitoring, chloroform, Markov chain Monte Carlo, MC, MCMC,\nevaluated Bayes' theorem directly by using MC\nsimulation to build up a library of terms for\nthe likelihood and prior incorporating distribu-\ntions for PBPK model parameters to account\nfor population variability.\nAllen et al. (2007) recently reconstructed\nexposure to methylmercury (MeHg) in\nwomen of childbearing age and pregnant\nwomen, using a method similar to that pre-\nsented here. Their application involved two\nstages of Bayesian updating to recalibrate the\nPBPK model parameters along with oral\nabsorption of MeHg for the subpopulation of\ninterest. Both the method of Allen et al.\n(2007) and the method presented here are\nbased on the work of Gelman et al. (1996),\nwhich was presented as a general method of\nparameter estimation in PBPK models. This\nmethod originally was applied to PBPK model\ncalibration, and examples and reviews can be\nfound in a number of articles (Bernillon and\nWe view reverse dosimetry as a type of\nPBPK model calibration problem, which\nallows us to use established methods and tools\nto aid in the interpretation of population-\nbased biomonitoring data.\nReverse dosimetry. The fundamental prob-\nlem underlying reverse dosimetry is to relate a\nmeasured internal dose, or tissue concentra-\ntion, CT\n, to an unmeasured external exposure\nor dose, CD\n, given a deterministic model f (we\nconsider f to be minimally a PBPK model).\nThe usual mode of operation for f is to solve\nthe \"forward problem\" of determining the tis-\nsue concentration given a known external dose:\nCT\n= f (CD\n). If our model is such that an\nappropriate inverse f \u00ad1 can be found, then the\nreverse problem can be solved as CD\n).\nTypically, however, f is such that an inverse\neither does not exist or may not be unique, or\nmay be unstable, meaning that a small change\nin the data may lead to a large change in out-\nput of the inverse function; that is, the reverse\nproblem is usually \"ill-posed\" (Hadamard\n1902). Additional complications arise when\nconsidering the population-based nature of the\nbiomonitoring data where population variabil-\nity becomes a significant factor that needs to be\nincorporated into the solution for CD\n. Also,\nbiomonitoring data represent accumulation of\nchemicals in the body from all possible sources\nand routes of exposure, and we may need to\naccount for multiple simultaneous indepen-\ndent inputs into the model.\nBayesian inference. A Bayesian approach\ndetermines CD\nas a probability distribution\nrather than a single value, the starting point\nbeing the treatment of all observables and para-\nmeters of interest as random variables. The\nexternal dose CD\nis assigned a \"prior\" probabil-\nity distribution representing knowledge about\nCD\nbefore consideration of the data CT\n. The\nprior distribution is updated via Bayes' theo-\nrem, into a \"posterior\" probability distribution\nfor CD\nconditioned on the data CT\n. Bayes' the-\norem can be written as\nwhere p(CD\n) is the prior, p(CT\n) is the\nlikelihood, and p(CD\n) is the posterior.\nThe likelihood is the conditional distribution\np(CT\n) viewed as a function of CD\nand\nwhose functional form is based on the specifi-\ncation of a measurement model that describes\nthe difference between observation and model\nprediction in terms of an error.\nA significant aspect of PBPK models is that\nall of the parameters have a physical or biologi-\ncal interpretation: they are not arbitrary. We\ncan use knowledge regarding possible ranges,\ncentral values, and measures of dispersion, as\nwell as specific data from separate studies, to\ndefine informative prior distributions.\nThe product of the prior and likelihood\ngives (up to a normalization constant) the pos-\nterior distribution containing all information\nregarding the parameter CD\nconsistent with\nthe data and prior information. The posterior\ndistribution is the solution of the reverse prob-\nlem, and all further inferences regarding CD\nis\nmade from it in terms of expectation values of\nfunctions of CD\n.\nFor most cases of practical interest, the nor-\nmalized posterior distribution is evaluated via\nnumerical simulation. MCMC simulation is\nthe standard method used for Bayesian analysis\nMCMC simulation refers to a class of iterative\nsimulations in which the random variables of\ninterest are drawn from a sequence, or chain, of\ndistributions that eventually converge to a sta-\nble posterior distribution. These chains can be\ndetermined by rejection sampling algorithms\nwhere a random draw is accepted or rejected\nbased on a simple probabilistic rule (e.g., the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm; see Gilks et al.\n1996). Convergence can be assessed by running\nmultiple chains and comparing the variance\nwithin and between the sequences via a \"poten-\ntial scale reduction\" factor R\n^ (Gelman et al.\n^ is such that limn R\n^ = 1, where n is\nthe number of iterations. Gelman et al. (2004)\nrecommend continuing iterations until R\nfor each parameter of interest. Once conver-\ngence is obtained, the multiple chains can be\naggregated and considered to be a sample from\na discrete approximation to the posterior distri-\nbution. The expectation value E[h(CD\n)] of an\narbitrary function h(CD\n) can be estimated by\ndrawing {CDk,\nk = 1, . . . , N } from the poste-\nrior and calculating the following:\nFor example, we can estimate the expected\nvalue for CD\nas the sample mean of the poste-\nrior distribution. Note also that CD\ncan consist\nof multiple components, the posterior being a\njoint distribution from which we can calculate\nmarginal distributions for each component.\nThe above discussion describes the basic\nelements of a Bayesian analysis that would\napply to an estimate of external dose for an\nindividual based on data collected for that indi-\nvidual. The reverse dosimetry problem, how-\never, is a problem of statistical inference: we\nwish to determine an estimate of exposure for\nthe general population based on biomonitoring\ndata collected from a representative sample of\nthat population. We can address this statistical\naspect of the problem by combining Bayesian\nanalysis with a population model.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe applied the Bayesian population analysis of\nGelman et al. (1996) to the problem of reverse\ndosimetry for chloroform to obtain population\nestimates of chloroform concentrations in tap\nwater and ambient household air under resi-\ndential exposure conditions. We viewed reverse\ndosimetry as a type of model calibration prob-\nlem where, using an otherwise calibrated\nmodel, we determined unmeasured exposure\nparameters based on the measured biomonitor-\ning data. The basic elements of the analysis\ninclude a PBPK + shower model, prior chloro-\nform concentration measurements in tap water\nand ambient air from the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) Total Exposure\nAssessment Methodology (TEAM) study\n(Wallace 1997), and biomonitoring data in the\nform of chloroform concentrations in blood\nmeasured as part of the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII) (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention 1996). With some noted excep-\ntions, we use the PBPK + shower model, para-\nmeter distributions, definition of exposure, and\nexperimental data provided in Tan et al.\ndifferent rationale and purpose in the context\nof the Bayesian population framework pre-\nsented here, than that of the ECF distribution\nor likelihood-based methods.\nThe TEAM study data we used here were\npopulation than that used for the NHANES III\nNo exposure data were collected corresponding\nto the NHANES III biomonitoring data, and\nthe objective here is to determine an estimate\nfor such corresponding exposure.\nThe reverse dosimetry problem for chlo-\nroform is to relate a sample of chloroform\nblood concentrations, CV\n, to an unmeasured\npopulation distribution of environmental\nchloroform source concentrations, CS\n, given\nthe deterministic model f : CS\n.

We divided the parame-\nters into those that are to be updated in the\nanalysis, that is, the unmeasured source con-\ncentrations CS\n= (CW\n, CA\n), and those that are\nto remain fixed, where CW\nand CA\nare the con-\ncentrations in water and air, respectively. We\ndesignate the fixed parameters by , which can\nbe single-point values or fixed distributions\nrepresenting pharmacokinetic, shower model,\nand other exposure parameters such as drink-\ning water intake and shower duration.\nPopulation variability is described by con-\nsidering individual values for CS\nto arise\nindependently from a population distribution\nparameterized by a population mean \u00b5 and a\npopulation variance . The introduction of\npopulation parameters induces a hierarchical\nstructure among the model parameters that,\nalong with the specification of the determinis-\ntic model quantities and error, defines the\npopulation model. The population model,\nspecifying the conditional dependencies\namong the population and individual para-\nmeters and the link through the deterministic\nmodel to the data and error, can be summa-\nrized as a graphical model (Figure 1). Here,\nblood and source concentrations are related at\nthe individual level through the deterministic\nmodel, with source and error parameter val-\nues for each individual arising independently\nfrom population-level distributions.\nThe Bayesian analysis proceeds as\ndescribed above, but with the additional\nstructure among the parameters in the popu-\nlation model incorporated into the terms in\nBayes' theorem. Writing the joint prior prob-\nability distribution as p(\u00b5, , CS\n, 2), we use\nthe conditional dependencies encoded in the\ngraphical model to obtain p(\u00b5, , CS\np(\u00b5) p() p(CS\n|\u00b5, ) p(2). Similarly, the\nlikelihood is p(CV\n|\u00b5, , CS\n, 2) = p(CV\n,\n2). Bayes' theorem then takes the form\nOnce we specified the prior distributions\nfor \u00b5, , and 2, the next step was to calculate\nthe posterior distribution conditioned on the\nobserved data and to calculate the statistical\nquantities for the parameters of interest.\nFigure 2 illustrates the relationships among\nthe basic elements used in the Bayesian analy-\nsis. Random draws from the prior distributions\nfor water and air concentrations, and from\nfixed distributions for pharmacokinetic, shower\nmodel, and other exposure parameters, define\nindividual parameter sets from which we calcu-\nlated model predictions for chloroform blood\nconcentrations. We compared predicted blood\nconcentrations with the observed concentra-\ntions and accepted the sampled values for\nwater and air with probability defined in the\nMCMC algorithm. Using the output parame-\nters of one iteration as the input for the next,\nwe repeated the procedure until the parameter\ndistributions for water and air became stable,\nand then transformed the prior distribution to\nthe posterior distribution.\nThe analysis of the reverse dosimetry\nproblem consists of the following steps:\n\u00b7 Specification of the probability model: speci-\nfication of the joint probability distribution\nincorporating the PBPK + shower model,\nhierarchical population model, measurement\nmodel, and the specification of prior parame-\nter distributions\n\u00b7 Bayesian inference: calculation of the poste-\nrior distribution conditioned on the observed\np C C\np C C p C\n \n   \n, , , |\n( )\n | , , ,\n( ) , , ,\n( )\n\n \n\n | ,\n( ) | ,\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\np C C p C p p p\n   \n  .\nLyons et al.\nFigure 3.

We placed the PBPK +\nshower, measurement, and population models\ninto a probability context through the specifi-\ncation of distributions for the likelihood and\npriors. We then combined these into an\nexpression for the posterior distribution for\nBayesian analysis.\nPBPK + shower model. The PBPK +\nshower exposure model consists of a PBPK\nmodel for chloroform (Corley et al. 2000)\ncombined with a mass transfer model for\nchloroform volatilized from shower water\n(Weisel et al. 1999). We consider the model\nvalidated for the forward problem under con-\ntrolled experimental conditions; that is, the\nmodel accurately predicts measured concen-\ntration\u00adtime profiles for a known external\ndose. Figure 3 illustrates this model.\nThe shower model consists of a shower\nstall in which chloroform is volatilized from a\nplug flow stream of tap water into well-mixed\nshower stall air. Model parameters include\nshower water flow rate, shower stall volume,\nand a chloroform mass transfer coefficient\naccounting for details of the shower system\nthat were not explicitly modeled (e.g., shower\nhead design).\nThe PBPK model consists of seven com-\npartments with chloroform exposure specified\nas inhalation, dermal, and ingestion. We con-\nsider inhalation exposure to be from chloro-\nform in ambient household air and from\nchloroform volatilized from shower water\nduring showering. Inhalation exposure is\nindicated in the gas exchange compartment,\nwhich we consider to be under equilibrium\nand steady-state conditions. We define dermal\nexposure as a net flux of chloroform into the\nskin via passive diffusion from direct contact\nwith water while showering. Ingestion is via\ndrinking water, which we indicate as absorp-\ntion directly into the liver. Elimination of\nchloroform is through exhalation from the gas\nexchange compartment and metabolism in\nthe liver and kidney compartments.\nIn order to maintain physiologic con-\nstraints during MC and MCMC simulations,\nwe made the following modifications to the\nPBPK model (see, e.g., Marino et al. 2006):\na) correlating cardiac output with alveolar ven-\ntilation rate through the ventilation perfusion\nratio (ventilation rate/cardiac output), b) con-\nstraining fractional blood flows to sum to unity\nby dividing the fractional blood flow to each\ntissue by the sum of fractional blood flows to\nall tissues, and c) constraining fractional tissue\nvolumes to sum to 0.91, by multiplying each\nfractional tissue volume by 0.91 and dividing\nby the total fractional tissue volume. We chose\nvalue 0.91 to match the total fractional tissue\nvolume used previously (Tan et al. 2006).\nPharmacokinetic parameters. With the\nexception of body weight and the ventilation\nperfusion ratio, all pharmacokinetic parameter\nvalues and distributions are those given in Tan\net al. (2006). We describe body weight with a\nnormal distribution with mean of 70 kg\n(Brown et al. 1997) and coefficient of varia-\ntion of 30%. We took the ventilation perfu-\nsion ratio as lognormal with a mean of 1.45\nand a coefficient of variation of 18%, calcu-\nlated from the cardiac output and alveolar\nventilation data given in Tan et al. (2006).\nExposure parameters. Consistent with\nTan et al. (2006), we defined exposure in\nterms of the following seven parameters:\na) chloroform concentration in tap water,\nb) chloroform concentration in ambient\nhousehold air, c) shower duration, d) shower\nwater flow rate, e) shower stall dimensions,\nf ) chloroform mass transfer coefficient, and\ng) daily drinking water intake.\nDistributions for several of the exposure\nparameters were provided by Tan et al. (2006),\nwho used them to generate distributions for\nMC simulation equivalent to a linear interpo-\nlation between data points. Here, we fitted\nsmooth normal or lognormal distributions to\nthe percentile data (Table 1). We obtained all\ncurve fits to percentile data using Gnuplot,\nlinear least-squares algorithm (Marquardt-\nLevenberg) to determine a best fit.\nWe truncated these parameter distribu-\ntions to include 95% of the distribution\n(mean \u00b1 1.96 SD for a normal distribution)\nto avoid sampling from implausible values\nand to be consistent with the truncations used\nThe notation  ~ N(M, S2) indicates the\nparameter  is distributed normally with\nmean M and variance S 2. For data that are\nlognormally distributed with sample mean M\nand variance S2, the notation\nindicates the log-transformed quantity is nor-\nmally distributed with the following mean\nand variance:\nwhere the coefficient of variation (CV) =\nS/M. We also used geometric mean GM =\nexp(M\n^ ) and geometric standard deviation\nGSD = exp(S\n^) to characterize the central value\nand dispersion for the lognormally distributed\nquantities.\nWe found no significant deviations of the\ncurve fits from the percentile data, with the\nexception of that for chloroform concentra-\ntion in tap water, which underestimates the\n25th percentile point (Figure 4). The data we\nused for chloroform concentration in tap\nwater (Wallace 1997) consisted of three sam-\nples from Bayonnne\u00adElizabeth, New Jersey,\nand three samples from Los Angeles and\nAntioch\u00adPittsburg, California. The 25th per-\ncentile point came only from the California\nsamples that had concentration values approx-\nimately half that of the New Jersey measure-\nments for the other percentiles. Also, in the\ncontext of the reverse dosimetry problem\naddressed here, we considered the parameters\nCW\nand CA\nto be unmeasured. We used the\ndistributions for these terms to define prior\ndistributions, which we will update based on\nthe measured biomonitoring data.

The source concentration CS\nconsists of\ntwo independent components corresponding\nto tap water and ambient air concentrations\nCS\n= (CW\n, CA\n). The population mean and\nvariance terms are then \u00b5 = (\u00b5W\n, \u00b5A\n) and  =\n(W\n, A\n). The variance 2 consists of only a\nsingle component corresponding to error in\nchloroform blood concentration measure-\nments. The population model specifies the\nrelationship among parameters before consid-\neration of the data; it may be that condition-\ning on the data induces a correlation among\ncomponents initially specified as independent.\nFor the measurement model, we consid-\nered I individuals, from each of whom we\nsimulated a single chloroform blood concen-\ntration CVi\nat time ti\n, i = 1, . . . , I. We used\nthe lognormal measurement model (Bernillon\n) = f (ti\n, i\n, CWi\n, CAi\n) +\ni\n, i = 1, . . . , I, where f is the PBPK + shower\nmodel, i\nare the fixed pharmacokinetic,\nshower model, and exposure parameters for\neach individual, and the error terms i\n2). The likelihood then takes the form\nPrior distributions. We assigned prior\ndistributions for each component of the\npopulation mean \u00b5 = \u00b5(M, S2) based on the\nbest estimate of the mean M and variance S2\nfor the parameter of interest; that is, we inter-\npreted a prior estimate of the mean and vari-\nance of the parameter as a prior distribution\nof means for that parameter.

We calculated the\nposterior distribution p(\u00b5, , CS\n)\nusing MCMC simulation conditioned on the\nobserved biomonitoring data. We interpreted\nthe expected values of the posterior popula-\ntion mean and variance distributions as the\nupdated mean and variance parameters for\nthe source concentration distributions as CS\n=\nCS\n(\u00b5\n\u00ad, \n\u00ad\n) where \u00b5\n\u00ad = E(\u00b5) and \n\u00ad\n= E().\nBiomonitoring data.

We distributed\nthe sampled blood concentrations uniformly\nover each hour in the sampling time interval:\nfive random data points per hour, for each\nExposure regimen. We assumed continu-\nous water intake at a constant rate from\nshower start time of 1010 hours. We obtained\nthe shower start time as the 50th percentile\n(median) of the shower start time distribution\nused by Tan et al. (2006). Our regimen was\nsimplified from that of Tan et al. (2006), who\nused a pulsed water intake and a distribution\nfor shower start time. The influence of the\nshower start time, in the context of the prob-\nlem at hand, is to provide a time point that,\ncombined with shower duration, defines an\nupper or lower bound to the time interval\nbetween shower exposure and sampling time.\nno data are available regarding blood sampling\ntime and exposure; we used the distribution of\nchloroform blood concentrations throughout\nthe sampling interval to account for variation\nbetween exposure and blood sampling time.\nWe considered inhalation of chloroform in\nambient household air to be constant.\nMCMC simulation. The MCMC simula-\ntions consisted of three independent chains of\n5,000 iterations and assessed convergence for\neach of the parameters of interest using the\npotential scale reduction factor of Gelman\n^ < 1.1 as criteria for con-\nvergence. We then aggregated the independent\nchains for each parameter and considered them\nto be a sample from the posterior distribution.\nEvaluation of results. MC simulation.

We ran the MC simula-\naggregated the simulations for each hour into a\nsingle distribution function and compared it\nwith the observed blood concentrations from\nthe NHANES III data.\nPosterior correlation of parameters. We\nchecked the assumption of independence\nbetween tap water and ambient air concentra-\ntions through the posterior correlations that\nmight have arisen following conditioning on\nthe data. For each individual i, we have in the\nof individual tap water and ambient air con-\ncentrations (CWi\n, ln(CA\n)i\n). We calculated the\nindividual sample correlations ri\n= corr(CWi\n,\nln(CA\n)i\n), i = 1, . . . , I, and estimated the popu-\nlation correlation as the mean of all the ri\n.\nComparison with previously obtained\nresults. We compared the posterior chloro-\nform tap water distribution with the results\nusing the ECF distribution reported by Tan\net al. (2006). We generated a distribution of\nrandom draws from the distribution defined\nby the curve fit for CV\n. The product of this\ndistribution and the ECF distribution yields a\ndistribution for chloroform concentrations in\ntap water.\nResults\nMCMC simulations. The MCMC simula-\ntions converged to R\npopulation mean and variance parameters.\nThe posterior means and variances, along\nwith the prior values, are noted in Table 2,\nwith the probability density functions plotted\nThe posterior distributions represent\nlikely distributions for chloroform concentra-\ntions in tap water and ambient air consistent\nwith the biomonitoring data, as well as the\nassumptions and constraints imposed by the\nmodel, exposure regimen, and prior distribu-\ntions. The posterior distribution for tap water\nconcentrations shows a decrease in the\nmedian and variance compared with the\nTEAM data (Wallace 1997), and the poste-\nrior distribution for ambient air concentra-\ntions shows an increase in the geometric mean\nand decrease in the geometric SD. A proper\nassessment of these results requires a direct\ncomparison of the posterior distributions with\nexposure data that would correspond to the\nNHANES III blood concentrations, and no\nsuch data are available at this time. We also\nevaluated the results by comparison of model\npredictions for blood concentrations using the\nposterior distributions for exposure.\nMC simulations. Table 3 and Figure 7\nshow the results of the MC simulations for\nchloroform blood concentrations using the\nprior and posterior concentrations for chloro-\nform in tap water and ambient household air.\nThe results for the prior distribution agree\nclosely with the results reported previously\n(Tan et al. 2006) for the case where chloro-\nform concentration in air is independent of\nthat in water, indicating that the simplifica-\ntions in exposure regimen used here had little\neffect on blood concentration compared with\nthe more detailed regimen. The posterior val-\nues for tap water and ambient air concentra-\ntions provide a better match to the observed\nvalues than do the priors, particularly for the\nmedian blood concentration. Comparing the\nprior and posterior curve fits in terms of the\nresidual sum of squares (RSS), we have\nRSSprior\n=\nCorrelation between ambient air and tap\nwater concentrations. The average individual\nsample correlation between chloroform tap\nwater and ambient air concentrations from the\nposterior distribution was r\u00ad = \u00ad0.05 with\nSE = 0.004. We interpret this as indicating lit-\ntle, if any, correlation between chloroform tap\nwater and ambient air concentrations induced\nby conditioning on the NHANES III data.\nThe lack of correlation between air and water\nconcentrations suggests that air concentration\nlevels are more the result of other factors, such\nas use of cleaning products, and nonlinear\nmixing effects involving ventilation, use of\ndishwashers and washing machines, or other\nmodes of chloroform source concentrations.\nComparison with results from the ECF\ndistribution approach. Table 4 shows the per-\ncentile values for chloroform concentrations in\ntap water from the posterior distribution in\nTable 2 and also as the product of measured\nblood concentrations and the ECF distribution.\nThe ECF distribution gives very high val-\nues for the upper percentiles that are not pre-\nsent in the results for the Bayesian approach.\nThe results of the Bayesian analysis are consis-\ntent with the TEAM data and provide expo-\nsure distributions that lead to close agreement\nbetween model predictions of chloroform\nblood concentration and the observed bio-\nmonitoring data.\nAmbient air concentration was provided by\nTan et al. (2006) through the relationship CA\n(mg/L); they reported\nno results corresponding to a posterior distrib-\nution for the case in which these quantities are\nindependent.\nConclusions\nIn this article we presented a method for\ninterpreting biomonitoring data in the con-\ntext of the exposure\u00adhealth evaluation\u00adrisk\nassessment continuum. The Bayesian analysis\nwe used here relates population-based meas-\nurements of chloroform blood concentrations\nto chloroform exposure in terms of tap water\nand ambient household air concentrations\ngiven as the posterior distributions in Table 2.\nThis places biomonitoring information in a\nhealth-based context by relating it to expo-\nsure-based quantities such as maximum con-\ntaminant level (MCL) and reference dose\n(RfD). With the understanding that the\nmethod we used here has not been subjected\nto comparison with experimental data for\nexposure, and that the numbers presented are\nComputational toxicology of chloroform\nTable 3.

Comparison of chloroform concentrations\nusing Bayesian analysis with that calculated using\nPercentile\nCW\n(posterior)\nCW\n= CV\n(\u00b5g/L)\nfor demonstration of the method, we note\nfrom Table 4 that 95% of the population rep-\nresented by the NHANES III data was likely\nto be exposed to  67 ppb chloroform in\nwater, which can be compared with the MCL\nfor trihalomethanes of 100 ppb (U.S. EPA\n2007). Using distributions for the posterior\nconcentration of chloroform in tap water\n), daily water intake (WI\n), and body\nthe product CW\nWI\n/BW to obtain a daily\nchloroform intake from drinking water\n(Table 5). The RfD for chloroform is\npercentile for the posterior distribution for\nchloroform concentration in ambient air is\n0.02 \u00b5g/L. The U.S. EPA currently does not\nhave an established inhalation reference con-\ncentration for chloroform (U.S. EPA 2001).\nThe accuracy of the results is limited by the\napproximate nature of the model, the assump-\ntions regarding exposure, and the quality of the\nexperimental data. In particular, the prior dis-\ntribution from the TEAM data did not corre-\nspond to the same population as that of the\nNHANES III data, and although it provided\nan informative prior, data from the same loca-\ntions and time frame as the NHANES III data,\neven if not corresponding to the individuals in\nthat study, would likely improve the accuracy\nof the results. Although the method presented\nhere is intended to be a tool to reconstruct\nexposure from biomonitoring data where no\ncorresponding exposure data are available,\ncomparison of the results with such data would\ngreatly assist in assessing the accuracy of the\nmethod, and such results could be incorpo-\nrated as prior distributions for additional\nchloroform dose reconstructions.\nREFERENCES\nAllen BC, Hack CE, Clewell HJ. 2007.
