Liggett\n Keywords: ethnic groups; psychiatric disorders; self-rated health\n1. Introduction\nSingle-item self-rated health (SRH), which measures the overall health of individuals [1], is a\nuseful screening tool for estimating the health needs of populations [2\u00ad4]. Single-item SRH predicts a\nwide range of physical, mental, and behavioral health outcomes [2,5\u00ad11]. Whether or not single item\nSRH measures similarly reflect health needs across diverse ethnic groups is still unknown [12\u00ad26].\nAs SRH may not have the same meaning across ethnic groups [17], it is plausible to expect\ncross-ethnic variation in the association between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH [17].\nAlthough we know that mental SRH better reflects mental problems, and physical SRH better\nreflects physical health problems [12\u00ad17,26], very few studies have ever tested the mental health\ncorrelates of physical SRH, particularly across various ethnic groups. While the literature has shown\nthat overall SRH reflects psychological distress [27] and psychiatric disorders [5,6,9\u00ad11], very limited\nknowledge exists on how racial and ethnic groups differ in the mental health correlates of physical\nSRH. The current study compares 10 ethnic groups for the associations between psychiatric\ndisorders and physical SRH in the United States.\nThe meaning of poor SRH may be under the influence of ethnicity and culture [9,16,17,25]. As a\nresult, the health correlates of SRH may vary across diverse populations [12,16,27]. Recent literature\nsuggests that single-item SRH measures may be more sensitive to the health needs of non-Hispanic\nWhites than any other ethnic groups [9]. However, very limited information is known about the\ncomparability of single-item SRH, as they reflect mental [28] and physical health [13,14,28\u00ad30] across\nethnic groups.\nEthnic groups may differ in the process of somatization, which is defined as the expression of\nemotional distress as physical rather than psychological symptoms [31]. Some research suggests that\nethnic minorities have a higher tendency to somaticize their mental health issues [32,33]. Minority\npopulations that have low access, trust and high stigma toward mental health care systems may\nexpress and perceive their mental and emotional symptoms as due to physical health problem [18].\nThis somatization may be one of the mechanisms that explain the lower mental health care\nutilization of ethnic minorities [34]. Due to higher somatization, we can expect the association\nbetween psychiatric disorders and physical SRH to be stronger in ethnic minority groups.\nThis study explored cross-ethnic variation in the associations between psychiatric disorders and\nphysical SRH in the United States.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Design and Setting\nThis was a secondary analysis of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES),\n2001 to 2003. The CPES is composed of the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), the\nNational Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the National Comorbidity Survey Replication\n(NCS-R). These three surveys are representative of United States adults and have employed very\nsimilar methodologies, including utilizing trained lay interviewers to conduct interviews primarily\nin person. Data were collected by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan in\nAnn Arbor. Study design and sampling have been described in detail elsewhere [35].\nThis current study included a national household probability sample of 18,237 individuals\nparticipants were adults (aged 18 or older). These numbers came from NLAAS (n = 4649), NSAL (n =\nThe study protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.\nParticipants received financial compensation for participating in this study.\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. All\nprocedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical\nstandards of the institutional and/or national research committee as well as the 1964 Helsinki\ndeclaration and its later amendments, or comparable ethical standards.\nMost interviews were face-to-face and conducted within participants' homes. A minority of the\ninterviews were conducted via phone. The average response rate of the CPES is 72.7%.\nRace and ethnicity in the CPES was measured by the individual's self-identification.\nParticipants self-identified as Asian, Hispanic, Black/African American, or White/Caucasian. Asians\nthen self-identified as Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, or other Asian. Hispanics identified as Cuban,\nPuerto Rican, Mexican, or other Hispanic. Blacks identified as African American or Caribbean Blacks\n2.5.2. Physical Self-Rated Health\nParticipants were asked \"How would you rate your overall physical health?\" Responses\nincluded five categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. Single-item physical SRH\nmeasures correlated with several aspects of health and well-being. Test\u00adretest reliability for\nsingle-items is high, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 for brief time intervals [30]. These single-item measures\nalso correlate with detailed standard multi-item scales [30]. A review showed that in 23 of 27 studies,\nSRH was associated with mortality above and beyond the effect of age and socioeconomic status,\nand in several studies, chronic conditions and medical risk factors as well [2].\nDemographic factors including age (continuous measure) and gender (dichotomous measure,\nmales being the reference category) were measured.\n2.5.4. Socioeconomic Characteristics\nSocioeconomic factors including education level--less than high school (reference category),\nhigh school graduate, some college, college graduate--and income (continuous measure) were\nmeasured.\n2.5.5. Lifetime Psychiatric Disorders\nA modified version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(WMH-CIDI) was used to evaluate lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), general anxiety\ndisorder (GAD), social phobia, alcohol abuse, binge eating disorders, panic disorder, and\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). All disorders were diagnosed based on the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The WMH-CIDI was originally\ndeveloped for the World Mental Health project initiated in 2000 [37]. The CIDI requires trained lay\ninterviewers to generate diagnoses of lifetime and recent DSM-IV-/ICD-10 disorders [38]. Clinical\nreappraisal studies have documented good concordance for CIDI diagnoses with diagnoses made by\npsychiatrists [37\u00ad40]. The CIDI has shown to be valid among several ethnic groups [41\u00ad43].\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nTo account for the complex sampling design of the CPES, we used Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp.,\nCollege Station, TX, USA) for data analysis. Standard errors were estimated using the Taylor series\napproximation technique. We conducted our analyses within each ethnic group. For bivariate\nassociations, zero-order Pearson correlations were calculated. For multivariable associations, we\ncalculated partial correlations.\nFirst, we estimated zero-order correlations by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient.\nThen, we used partial correlation tests while age and gender were controlled. Finally, we used\npartial correlation tests while age, gender, education, and income were controlled. In all analyses,\nphysical SRH was treated as a continuous measure, with a higher score indicating worse health.\nPsychiatric conditions were all dichotomous variables. Due to multiple comparisons, we used a\nmore conservative threshold for our p-values, where p of less than 0.01 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\n3. Results\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics across Ethnic Groups\nTable 1 provides a summary of demographic and socioeconomic status (SES) characteristics\nacross 10 ethnic groups in the study. Table 1 also describes the sample sizes of each ethnic group. As\nshown in the table, the largest population was composed of non-Latino Whites (41.6%). Our\npopulation was representative of over 200 million individuals in the United States. Age was lowest\nin Mexicans and highest in Cubans followed by non-Latino Whites. Education was lowest in\nMexicans, followed by African Americans. Income was lowest among African Americans, followed\nby Mexicans (Table 1).\n3.2. Unadjusted Associations\nTable 2 provides a summary of bivariate correlates of physical SRH across ethnic groups. Major\nethnic differences were found in correlates of physical SRH. Particularly in three ethnic groups,\nnamely, non-Hispanic Whites, Cubans, and African Americans, several psychiatric disorders were\npositively correlated with physical SRH, suggesting that the presence of psychiatric disorders is\nassociated with worse physical SRH (Table 2).\n3.3. Partially Adjusted Associations\nTable 3 summarizes adjusted correlations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH\nwhen age and gender are controlled for. This table also shows major ethnic differences in\ncorrelations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH. Age and gender explained why\nseveral psychiatric disorders were correlated with physical SRH in non-Hispanic Whites, but not in\nCubans or African Americans. That is, in non-Hispanic Whites, psychiatric disorders and physical\nSRH were not correlated net of age and gender. However, Cubans and African Americans showed\nassociations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH above and beyond age and gender\n(Table 3).\n3.4. Fully Adjusted Associations\nTable 4 shows the results of adjusted correlations when demographic factors and SES are\ncontrolled. As shown in this table, SES explained the correlation between psychiatric disorders and\nphysical SRH in African Americans, but not in Cubans. In African Americans, psychiatric disorders\nwere not correlated with physical SRH net of demographic and SES indicators. In Cubans,\npsychiatric disorders were still correlated with physical SRH above and beyond demographic and\nSES indicators (Table 4).\nTable 1.

Discussion\nThis study was conducted to compare various ethnic groups for the associations between\npsychiatric disorders and physical SRH in the United States. In line with our hypothesis, major\nethnic-group differences were found. We also found cross-ethnic variations in the role of\ndemographic and SES factors in explaining the association between psychiatric disorders and\nphysical SRH.\nIn African Americans, Cubans, and non-Hispanic Whites, a wide range of psychiatric disorders\nwere associated with physical SRH. In African Americans, SES explained the association between\npsychiatric disorders and physical SRH. In non-Hispanic Whites, however, age and gender\nexplained the associations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH. In Cubans, neither\ndemographic nor SES explained the link between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH.\nOur findings can be explained by the literature on ethnic differences in the degree to which\nmental disorders are somaticized [32]. Non-White ethnic groups such as Hispanics [32], African\nAmericans [44], and East Asians [33] may have a higher tendency for somatization of mental health\nsymptoms than non-Hispanic Whites. Studies have shown that women in general [32], and ethnic\nminority women in particular [45\u00ad47], have a high tendency for somatization of psychiatric\ndisorders such as depression. Future research should explore how the intersection of race, ethnicity,\nclass, and place shape somatization.\nIn countries such as United States, ethnic minorities may use somatization to cope with their\nmental health issues, which is defined as the diversion of emotional distress to physical rather than\npsychological symptoms. In the presence of somatization, patients experience and report bodily\ncomplaints due to psychiatric disorders [32]. In a study comparing clinical samples of Thai and\nAmerican children, Thai children were reported to have higher levels of somatic versus depressive\nsymptoms relative to American children [33]. Ethnicity, gender, and SES all influence the degree to\nwhich an individual is emotionally expressive [32]. We argue that differences in somatization,\nemotional expressivity, and stigma explain cross-ethnic variation in associations between\npsychiatric disorders and physical SRH.\nOur findings extend the literature differential validity of SRH across ethnic groups [33,44,48].\nRecent research has documented considerable ethnic differences in the association between SRH and\npsychiatric disorders [9,16,17]. SRH differently reflects past, current, and future health needs across\nethnically diverse individuals [27,49], and not only ethnic differences: SES differences also exist in\nthe reliability and validity of SRH [50]. Thus, one reason SRH reflects the various health domains of\nethnic groups is their SES differences. However, in this study, we did not control for SES differences\nbetween ethnic groups, only the SES variation within each ethnic group. We need to conduct more\nstudies on the cumulative and interactive effects of ethnicity and SES on meanings of SRH. As SRH\nhas differential validity for measuring \"true\" health statuses across ethnic groups [22,24], and SRH\nreflects different aspects of health across ethnic groups [16\u00ad18], SRH should not be simply used for\nthe comparison of health status across groups. So, SRH may not be an ideal tool to measure health\ndisparities across ethnic groups. There is a need for more validation studies of SRH and mental\nhealth measures [12,13]. There is also a need to study the cognitive and emotional mechanisms\nbehind ethnic differences in regards to how actual health needs are reflected in the perception and\nWe also found ethnic group variation in the confounding role of demographic and SES factors\non the associations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH. In non-Hispanic Whites, age\nand gender explained the associations between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH. This means\nthat age and gender had a more salient effect in shaping both mental (e.g., psychiatric disorders) and\nphysical (e.g., SRH) health in non-Hispanic Whites. However, for African Americans, it was not age\nand gender, but rather low SES that explained why psychiatric disorders and physical SRH were\nlinked. In Cubans, psychiatric disorders and physical SRH did not correlate because they were more\ncommon in demographic or SES groups. The role of demographic factors in the health of\nWhites [55\u00ad57], and role of SES in the health of Blacks [58\u00ad60] are well-known. In fact, low SES at\nleast in part explains why Blacks experience worse health outcomes in United States [59\u00ad61].\nResearch has shown that demographic and SES factors differently determine physical and mental\nSRH across ethnic groups [25]. Previous research has also shown that demographic and SES factors\ndifferently confound the associations between physical and mental health outcomes across various\nOur findings have implications for clinical and public health practices with ethnically diverse\npopulations. Solely relying on single-item SRH measures will result in differential levels of bias in\nthe measurement of health across various ethnic groups [15,66]. Single-item SRH should accompany\nmore comprehensive measures if we wish to compare health and illness across ethnically diverse\npopulations [24]. Currently, SRH is being used as a screening tool to enroll populations for\ninterventions [5,24]. SRH is also being employed to measure the efficacy of an intervention both in\nclinical and community settings. As said above, we recommend the use of other measures in\naddition to SRH to provide more nuanced information on the actual health status of ethnically\ndiverse populations [66].\nAlthough we showed ethnic differences in how psychiatric conditions influence the evaluation\nof one's physical health, the mechanisms behind these group differences are still unknown. In\naddition, it is not clear how biases in the measurement of health status of diverse populations can be\nreduced [9]. There are more questions than answers when it comes to the interplay of ethnicity,\ngender, class, and health perception [17].\nThis study had a few limitations. CIDI may be differentially valid for the diagnosis of\npsychiatric disorders across ethnic groups. The study did not measure whether participants had\nreceived a psychiatric diagnosis by a clinician, and whether they had chronic medical conditions.\nThe current study did not use a comprehensive list of psychiatric disorders. As single-item SRH\nmeasures are sensitive to the contextual effects of preceding questions in surveys [30], other\nresearchers may find different results if they use other surveys. Despite all these limitations, the\ncurrent study used a nationally representative data with a very large sample size.\nTo conclude, various ethnic groups differ in their associations between psychiatric disorders\nand physical SRH. Cross-ethnic variations also exist in the role of demographic and SES factors in\nexplaining the association between psychiatric disorders and physical SRH.\n"
