It also gives rise to the view\nthat the organizations which possess skilled, creative, and distinctive knowledgeable\nemployees along with supportive organizational structures and systems, and main-\ntains cordial customer relations contribute in achieving superior organizational posi-\ntion. Hence, it is important to understand to what extent intellectual capital is efficiently\nutilized by specific sectors in creating value for organizations (Kamath, 2007). The\npresent study aims to develop, establish, and empirically validate the intellectual capital\nscale in the banking sector, in the context of emerging economies like India.\nData were collected from three executives each (including one manager and two senior\nemployees) from 144 branches of 21 public and seven private commercial banks oper-\nating in Jammu city, India. The three senior most executives were purposively selected\nbecause of being more knowledgeable and experienced. The study established the intel-\nlectual capital scale as a multidimensional scale comprising human capital, relational\ncapital, and structural capital. All the three dimensions were found to significantly\ncontribute to the intellectual capital, among which relational capital contributed rela-\ntively more, followed by human capital and structural capital.\nRelational capital consists of important items like meeting with customers, customer\nfeedback, and knowledge and regular customer interaction. Similarly, human capital\ndimension consists of significant items like employee creativity, devoted staff, training\nand education, experience, attitude, and innovative employees. Structural capital is a\ncomposite of valuable items like structure, systems, information technology, capabilities,\nculture, empowerment, and service quality which helps in developing intellectual capital.\nThe research findings can help bank managers in determining how to generate value\nusing human, structural, and relational capital. For instance, the study findings offer\nvaluable insight into how the managers can improve bank's structural capital by encour-\naging innovation ability among employees, positive culture, and strengthening informa-\ntion technology in terms of continuously updating software and hardware. The study is\nlimited to public and private commercial banks operating in Jammu city. In future, the\nscale validation can be undertaken to investigate whether the three-dimensional intel-\nlectual capital scale can be generalized for other industries and countries.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nIntellectual Capital\nHuman Capital\nRelational Capital\nStructural Capital\nBanking  \nOver the past few decades, intangible assets\nhave become a basic source of organizational\nwealth creation and sustainable competitive\nadvantage (Garcia-Ayuso, 2003). Intellectual capital is\none of the essential blocks of intangible assets, which\nis becoming a critical factor for organizational perfor-\nmance (Hsu & Fang, 2009). Researchers such as Stewart\nthat the creation of economic value was largely based on\nintangible resources and capabilities, as these were the\nmost powerful tools to enhance organizational compet-\nitiveness. In simple words, intellectual capital is a value\ndriver of an organization which gives it a competitive\nedge. Therefore, it is important to understand to what\nextentintellectualcapitalisefficientlyutilizedbyspecific\nsectors in creating value for organizations (Kamath,\nneed to know how intellectual capital created value in\nan organization. Similarly, scholars like Ahangar (2011),\nMaditinos, Chatzoudes, and Tsairidis (2011) empha-\nsized on the need to explore how intellectual capital\ncould be managed and measured properly. Scholars\nsuch as Hormiga, Canino, and Medina (2010), Hsu and\nWu, Chang, and Chen (2008) have conceptualized intel-\nlectual capital but still there is a lack of universally\nacceptable definition of intellectual capital. Further,\nSamraie, and Jadallah (2012), and Sharabati, Jawad,\nand Bontis (2010) have measured intellectual capital\nbut from varied aspects and that too in different sectors\nand in different countries. Kamath (2007) and Rehman,\nUsman, and Asgar (2012) have measured intellectual\ncapital in the banking sector using VAIC (value added\nintellectual coefficient), based on secondary data. A few\nstudies, based on primary data, have been conducted\non measurement of intellectual capital in sectors such\nas microfinance, banking, etc. For example, Cabrita and\nBontis (2008) study on Portuguese banks. It also meas-\nured intellectual capital based on human capital, rela-\ntional capital, and structural capital but with limited\nnumber of items.\nBesides, a few studies such as Choudhary (2010), Jaradat\nin different services sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals,\nand microfinance. However, no study has been found\nto measure intellectual capital based on the perception\nof the managers/executives, in the Indian context in\ngeneral and in the banking sector in particular.\nBeing a knowledge-intensive, skill-based, and rela-\ntionship-service industry, banking is an ideal sector\nto study intellectual capital. Banks exploit intellec-\ntual capital for its survival in the competitive market\nthrough extensive use of human capital, structural\ncapital, and relational capital (Kamath, 2007). The role\nand working of employees, at different positions and\nlevels, in the banking service sector are directly linked\nwith the knowledge and intellect of employees (Bontis,\npeople, organizational structure, and relationships\nof people which give banks the competitive edge in a\nknowledge-based economy.\nHence, the main objective of this study is to establish\nand empirically validate the intellectual capital scale\nin the banking sector. The specific objectives include\ndefining the elements of intellectual capital to construct\nthe intellectual capital scale based on measurement\nmodels, and to test the reliability and validity of the\nscale through an empirical study.\nDEVELOPMENT\nIntellectual Capital\nIntellectual capital is conceptualized as intangible\nresources that generate value for an organization\n(Hunter, Webster, & Wyatt, 2005). One of the most\nsuccinct definitions of intellectual capital as `packaged\nuseful knowledge' is given by Stewart (1997). Edvinson\n(1997) recognized intellectual capital as a set of intan-\ngible assets such as resources, competencies, and capa-\nbilities which not only increased organizational perfor-\nmance but also resulted in value creation. Further, Kim,\nYoo, and Lee (2011) described intellectual capital as a\nnon-monetary asset that eventually reaped economic\nmajor contributors of the concept, on the other hand,\nrelated intellectual capital with a composite of human\ncompetencies, knowledge, ability, skills, experience,\nand customer relationships that provided an organiza-\ntion competitive edge in the market. This concept was\nextended by Ulrich (1998), who equated intellectual\ncapital to commitment and competence of employees.\nVarious typologies are proposed by different researchers\nin the literature. Among these, the three-dimensional\nclassificationofintellectualcapital,thatishumancapital,\nstructural capital, and relational capital has achieved a\ncertain degree of consensus among researchers such as\nHuman Capital\nHuman capital is the basic component in the intellec-\ntual capital development process (Yang & Lin, 2009).\nIt is inherent in people and hence cannot be directly\nowned by an organization (Edvinson & Malone, 1997).\nHuman capital denotes what employees bring into the\nvalue adding processes, and encompasses professional\ncompetence, employee motivation, and leadership\nviewed human capital as a summation of employees'\nskill, capabilities, experience, education, and attitude\nabout life and business. Various competencies such\nas learning and education, experience and expertise,\ncreativity, staff attitude as well as recruitment and\ntraining plays a significant role in the development of\nhuman capital (Lings & Greenley, 2005; Sharabati et\neducated, experienced, trained, creative, and motivated\nemployees can work more efficiently and thereby result\nin the creation of organizational capital.\nRelational Capital\nRelational capital results from organization's rela-\ntionship with customers, partners, shareholders, and\nother stakeholders that are critical to the organizational\nperformance (Bontis, Crossan, & Hulland, 2002). Shih,\nChang, and Lin (2010) contended relational capital\nas the interaction between organizations, customers,\nsuppliers, contractors, and other affiliated partners.\nLow (2000) explicated relational capital as the flow\nof knowledge from an organization to external envi-\nronment. The competencies such as customer relation\nas well as customer loyalty and trust play significant\nrole in the development of relational capital (Isaac,\ninstance, higher the degree of customer loyalty and\ntrust, better will be the relationship with customers\nwhich subsequently enhances organizational value.\nStructural Capital\nStructural capital refers to the mechanism and structure\nof an organization that helps to support employees for\noptimum intellectual performance (Bollen, Vergauwen,\nlighted that structural capital consisted of non-human\nstore houses of knowledge in an organization which\nare embedded in systems, databases, and programmes.\nFurther, Bontis et al. (2002) remarked that an individual\nin an organization could never reach the fullest potential\nof its systems if its procedures were poor. The structural\ncapital is the outcome that is extended from systems\nand programmes, information technology, culture,\nand renewal and development which significantly\ncontribute to the development of structural capital\nscale (Choudhary, 2010; Isaac, Herremans, & Kline,\nstructures, programmes, systems, and information\ntechnology enhance the efficiency of employees and\ncan create better customer relations, thereby enhancing\nthe organizational value.\nMajority of the researchers such as Ahmadi, Ahmadi,\nand Shakeri (2011); Allameh, Abassi, and Shokrani\nand Shih et al. (2010) considered human capital as the\ncore component that influenced both relational capital\nand structural capital. However, Cabrita and Bontis\ncapital influenced relational capital not only directly\nbut also indirectly through structural capital in banks\nand hospitals respectively. This was also supple-\nmented by Shih et al. (2010), who identified human\ncapital as exhibiting positive and direct effect over rela-\ntional capital and structural capital in service as well\nas in banking sectors. Even Allameh et al. (2010) found\nhuman capital to impact relational capital in service\nand manufacturing organizations. Further, Shih et\nal. (2010) underscored both relational and structural\ncapital having positive and direct impact on each other.\nHence, it is concluded that all the dimensions of intel-\nlectual capital affect each other.\nBased on this backdrop, the following hypotheses are\nformulated as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Research Framework\nIntellectual\nCapital\nStructural Capital\nRelational Capital\nHuman Capital\nSource: Review of literature.\nH1: Intellectual capital is a composite of human\ncapital, relational capital, and structural capital.\nH2a: Human capital significantly affects relational\ncapital.\nH2b: Human capital significantly affects structural\ncapital.\nH2c: Relational capital significantly affects struc-\ntural capital.\nGeneration of Scale Items\nThe main objective of the research article is to develop\na scale to measure intellectual capital in the banking\nsector. As discussed in the previous section, intellectual\ncapital is considered to be a composite of three major\ndimensions: human capital, relational capital, and\nstructural capital. The items used for the measurement\nof intellectual capital in the banking sector were gener-\nated using the following steps:\nFirst, relevant studies were identified from the scanned\nliterature to draw a pool of scale items for the measure-\nment of the three dimensions. Second, to make the scale\ncomprehension more clear and relevant for the banking\nsector, a number of self-developed items were designed.\nThird, all identified, selected, and designed items were\ndiscussed with five academicians and five doctoral\nstudents to critically evaluate and check for their clarity\nand unambiguity. At this stage, few suggestions were\nincorporated on the basis of received feedback. Fourth,\nall the selected items were finally discussed with five\nbank managers and accordingly some modifications in\nthe form of alteration and deletion were done. Lastly,\nall the selected items were pretested on 55 managers\nto establish the content validity of the scale items. At\nthis stage, few of the items were modified and the rest\nwere kept the same for final data collection. All these\nsteps identified 63 items to measure intellectual capital\nthat included 34 items extracted from literature, and 26\nself-developed items.\nHuman Capital\nThe five major significant characteristics of human\ncapital, as identified from the scanned literature, include\nlearning and education (Sharabati et al., 2010), experi-\nence and expertise (Sharabati et al., 2010; Subramaniam\n& Youndt, 2005), staff attitude (Lings & Greenley,\n2005), and recruitment and training (Sharabati et al.,\n2010). To capture the domain of human capital, items\nrelated to learning and education were borrowed from\nthe works of Sharabati et al. (2010) and Subramaniam\nand Youndt (2005), along with some self-developed\nitems such as `competence of bank employees matches\nwith their work requirements and responsibilities'\nand `bank always keeps itself up-to-date for profes-\nsional skills'. While items of experience and expertise\nsuch as `experienced and expert employees work more\nefficiently' and `employees consistently perform at\ntheir best in the bank' were adopted from the study of\nSharabati et al. (2010), staff attitude was measured with\nthe help of items like `employees are well motivated'\nand `employees are happy to take more responsibility'\nwhich were extracted from the works of Lings and\nGreenley (2005). The items pertaining to recruitment\nand training like `bank's recruitment programmes is\ncomprehensive' and `bank upgrades employees skills\nthrough training programme' were extracted from the\nstudies of Zerenler, Hasiloglu, and Sezgin (2008) along\nwith one self-developed item, namely, `bank's educa-\ntion and training programmes are beneficial'.\nRelational Capital\nThe third component of intellectual capital focuses on\nrelationships of employees with internal and external\nstakeholders. It embraces items related to trust and\nloyalty that an organization creates by maintaining\ngood relationship with customers and the rest of the\nsociety. Thus, to assess relational capital, items related\nto customer knowledge like `data about customers are\ncontinuously updated' and `bank continuously meets\nwith customers to find out what they want from it' were\ntaken from the studies of Isaac et al. (2010) and Sharabati\net al. (2010) along with a few self-developed items such\nas `feedback of customers is shared across departments\nin bank'. On the other hand, the customer loyalty and\ntrust items (e.g., `employees discover and solve prob-\nlems through mutual cooperation' and `customers trust\nbank with open communication') were extracted from\nthe scale items used by Hafeez and Muhammad (2012).\nStructural Capital\nThe supportive infrastructure of an organization\nconsists of important sub-dimensions like systems and\nprogrammes, information technology, organizational\ncultureaswellasrenewalanddevelopmentthatenhance\nemployees' capabilities to do work. To measure struc-\ntural capital, items related to system and programmes,\nand information technology were extracted from the\nSubramaniam and Youndt (2005), and items related to\nrenewal and development were self-designed which\nincluded `bank constantly improves service quality',\n`there is great support for innovative ideas in this\nbank', and `bank continuously develops new product\nand services'. Items related to organizational culture\nwere drawn from the works of Amiri et al. (2010), e.g.,\n`atmosphere in this bank is pleasant'.\nThe present study exclusively focused on the Indian\nscheduled commercial banks, both public and private\nsector banks, operational across India. Since all the\nbanks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\nand work according to its guidelines, their functioning\nwith respect to working culture, management and policy\nguidelines, in general, is considered at par with each\nother. Further, all managers and employees working in\ndifferent bank branches in Jammu have the exposure\nof working in different representative branches across\nIndia, as all banks have transferable job option.\nThe sampling frame of the study consisted of 144\nbranches of 21 public and seven new private banks\nfunctioning in Jammu city. The data were collected\nfrom three executives each (one branch manager\nand two senior most employees) from 144 branches.\nThese respondents, selected on the basis of purposive\nsampling, were more knowledgeable, experienced and\nhad clear understanding of the operational functioning\nof banks at different levels. Finally, a total of 576 ques-\ntionnaires were distributed to the respondents, out of\nwhich 339 questionnaires were returned (response rate\nDescriptive Statistics\nBefore proceeding for analysis, negative responses\nassigned to some items were reversed. Additionally,\n10 outlier responses were identified for deletion. The\nnormality of data was investigated, and the items\nfalling within the liberal range of skewness (\u00ad1.5 to +1.5)\nThe mean and standard deviation of the constructs are\nshown in Table 1.\nReliability\nThe consistency of data was established through\nCronbach's alpha.

The exploratory factor\nanalysis (EFA) was run both dimension-wise and on\nthe overall intellectual capital scale. Out of the 31\nitems of human capital, 13 were retained across four\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics and Reliability\nMean Standard Deviation Skewness Kurtosis Reliability\nConstruct Min Max Min Max Min Max Min Max \nSource: Table values calculated by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) software.\nValues are calculated on the basis of responses collected from respondents through questionnaire during survey.\nNote: HC=Human Capital, RC=Relational Capital, SC=Structural Capital, IC=Intellectual Capital.\nfactors. In structural capital, 16 were retained out of 21\nitems under four factors. Likewise, out of the 11 items\nof relational capital, seven were retained under two\nfactors. The EFA results are shown in Table 2. Majority\nof the alpha values for factors identified under EFA\nand culture factors (0.694) (Table 2).

The three-dimensional model\ncomprised all items identified in three dimensions--\nhuman capital, relational capital, and structural capital.\nThe two-dimensional model comprised two dimen-\nsions `human capital and relational capital', considered\nas single-dimension related to human behaviour,\nhuman relation, and competence and structural capital.\nThe unidimensional model considered all summated\nitems of three dimensions in a single factor. Based on\nthe threshold criteria of model fit measures given by\nMalhotra and Dash (2010), intellectual capital model\ncomprising three dimensions was found to be the best\nfit model (Figure 2), whereas the other two models, that\nis, two-dimensional model and unidimensional model,\nwith inadequate fit indices, were rejected. Further, one\nof the four factors of structural capital got deleted in\nthe accepted three-dimensional model, as its deletion\nresulted in better model fit. Besides, precaution was\nalso taken to ensure that deletion had no effect on the\nmeaning of the construct. Hence, deletion was no threat\nto the content validity. The fitness measures of the three\nmodels are given in Table 3. All the fit indices of the\nthree-dimensional model met the threshold criteria for\nan excellent fit except Relative Fit Index (RFI), which\nwas marginally close to 0.9.\nPsychometric Properties\nThe result of the psychometric characteristics of intel-\nlectual capital scale and its three dimensions are given\nin Table 4. The composite reliability (CR) of the intellec-\ntual capital scale along with human capital, relational\ncapital, and structural capital was assessed. The three\nsubscales, namely, human capital, relational capital, and\n0.916, respectively. Since all the composite reliability\nvalues are above threshold values of 0.7, all the subscales\nare established as reliable and consistent (Malhotra &\nDash, 2010). To assess the convergent validity, Average\nVariance Extracted (AVE) for human capital, relational\ncapital, and structural capital were computed and their\ntively (all greater than 0.5). Hence, convergent validity\nof all the scales is also established. Further, discriminant\nFigure 2: Three-dimensional Measurement Model\nSC\nRC\nHC\nIC\nSource: SEM software.\nNote: e1 to e13= errors, IC--Intellectual capital, HC--Human\ncapital, RC--Relational capital, SC--Structural capital, HCF1M--\nCompetence, HCF2M--Creativity, HCF3M--Managers' attitude,\nHCF4M--Staff attitude, RCF1M--Customer relation, RCF2M--\nEmployee relation, SCF1M--Innovation, SCF3M--Information tech-\nnology, SCF4M--Culture.\nTable 3: Measurement Models on the basis of Dimensionality\nSource: Table values calculated by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) software.\nValues are calculated on the basis of responses collected from respondents through questionnaire during survey.\nNote: HC = Human capital, RC = Relational capital, SC = Structural capital.\nvalidity of sub-scales was also ascertained. For instance,\ndiscriminant validity for human capital was estab-\nlished, as the square root values of AVE that is recorded\nas 0.801 for human capital is greater than the correlation\nbetween relational capital and structural capital that is\ntraced as 0.589. Likewise, discriminant validity for rela-\ntional capital and structural capital was also established.\nNomological Validity\nThe study further assessed nomological validity which\nexhibits the relationship of one construct with another\nconstruct in accordance with the relevant theory. The\nnomological validity in the study was established\nby identifying how well intellectual capital corre-\nlated with business performance (Figure 3). There are\nwell grounded theoretical reasons to expect a posi-\ntive relationship between intellectual capital and busi-\nness performance, as various researchers like Ahangar\net al. (2010) emphasized that intellectual capital played\nan important role in improving business performance of\norganizations. The business performance of the banks\nwas assessed through growth, market share, profit-\nability, and Return on Assets (ROA). All these items\nwere used by Latif, Malik, and Aslam (2012) to measure\nbusiness performance in the banking sector. The struc-\ntural equation model (SEM) was applied to examine\nthe relationship between intellectual capital and busi-\nness performance. The intellectual capital and business\nperformance model reflects robust indices for 2/df,\nRoot Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)\nand incremental fit indices like Normed Fit Index (NFI),\nRelative fit Index (RFI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI),\nTucker Lewis Index (TLI), and Comparative Fit Index\nsion weights (beta value = 0.345) and significant critical\nFigure 3: Nomological Validity\nSC\nFINP\nHC\nSource: SEM software.\nNote: e1 to e17= errors, IC--Intellectual capital, HC--Human capital, RC--Relational capital, SC--Structural capital, HCF1M--Competence, HCF2M--\nCreativity, HCF3M--Managers' attitude, HCF4M--Staff attitude, RCF1M--Customer relation, RCF2M--Employee relation, SCF1M--Innovation, SCF3M--\nInformation technology, SCF4M--Culture, FINP--Business performance, CA5--Desired growth, CA6--Market share, CA7--Profitability, CA9--ROA.\nTable 4: Composite Reliability, Average Variance Extracted, and\nCorrelation Matrix\nConstructs Composite\nReliability\nSource: Table values calculated by using Statistical Package for\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) soft-\nware.

First, Harmon's one factor\nmethod using exploratory factor analysis was applied\non all the dimensions of intellectual capital taken\ntogether, in which the variance extracted was identi-\nfied as 29.82 per cent (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, &\nPodsakoff, 2003). This value suggests absence of any\nsignificant influence of common variance. Second, the\nlatent variable approach was also used by adding a first\norder factor with all the measures of human capital,\nrelational capital, and structural capital as observed\nindicators. Again common variance of 9 per cent was\nrecorded which indicates that biasness is not an issue\nAfter assessing the psychometric properties of the intel-\nlectual scale and its subscales, the hypotheses formu-\nlated were tested using SEM.\nIntellectual capital is positively influenced by human\ncapital, relational capital, and structural capital\n(Model 1): This model is found to be robust fit with\ndimensions of intellectual capital--human capital,\nrelational capital, and structural capital--are found\nto significantly and strongly affect intellectual capital\nas all critical ratios (CR) are above 1.96 at 5 per cent\nsignificant level and standard regression weight (SRW)\nvalues are above 0.5 (Table 5). Hence, Hypothesis\nH1 is accepted. The study results are consistent with\nthe results of Cabrita and Bontis (2008) study which\nindicated that the three constructs that made up\nintellectual capital significantly affected one another,\nand then subsequently affected intellectual capital.\nFurther, Shih et al. (2010) contemplated that human\ncapital was primarily predicted through employees'\ncapabilities and employees training. In the present\nstudy also, both factors including items such as\n`employees undergo continuous training programmes'\nand `employees are educated enough to do their jobs'\ncontribute significantly in developing human capital.\nAkin to the results of Shih et al. (2010), organizational\nculture and innovation ability are considered to be\nimportant for enhancing structural capital. However,\ninformation technology, comprising items such as `bank\nis embedded with information technology software'\nand `information technology contributes to service\nquality', is seen as an additional factor to influence\nstructural capital. Further, similar to the results of\nHalim (2010), the present study also witnesses that\ncustomer relationship is a significant factor which\ncapitalizes relational capital along with employee\nrelationship comprising items like `employees enhance\ntheir capabilities through interactions' and `employees\ndiscover and solve problems through interactions'.\nHuman capital significantly affects relational capital\n(Model 2): In this model, the effect of human capital\non relational capital was assessed. The human capital\nand relational capital model fit indices were arrived at\nmodel to be best fit. The CR and SRW values comes out\nhuman capital significantly and strongly affects rela-\ntional capital. Hence, Hypothesis H2a is accepted. These\nresults are in line with studies of Allameh et al. (2010)\nand Cabrita and Bontis (2008). According to Cabrita\nand Bontis (2008), increased training of employees and\nemployee motivation could lead to higher productivity\nand enhanced creativity, thereby resulting in satisfied\nand loyal clients. Further, they concluded that high\nTable 5: Critical Ratio and Standardized Regression Weight\nValues\nDimensions Critical Ratio (CR) SRW\nSource: Table values calculated by using Statistical Package for\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) soft-\nware.

In addition, Allameh et al. (2010)\nexhibited that abilities, competences, and know-how\nthat human resources possessed helped an organiza-\ntion in building good customer relations and knowl-\nedge sharing. In addition, the study also identified other\nfactors like competence, creativity, employee attitude,\nstaff attitude, culture, and employee relationship which\ncan enhance and generate valuable human capital.\nHuman capital significantly affects structural capital\n(Model 3): In this model, the effect of human capital on\nstructural capital was examined. The human capital and\nstructural capital model showed robust fit indices (2/\nstructural capital is significantly and strongly affected\nby human capital. Hence, Hypothesis H2b is accepted.\nThe results are compatible with the studies of Shih et\nargue that human capital exhibits positive and direct\ninfluence on structural capital. According to Cabrita\nand Bontis (2008), employees' competence, creativity,\nand staff attitude exhibit positive influence on structural\ncapital as employee abilities affect organizations'\nculture, process efficiency, and innovation processes.\nOn the other hand, Shih et al. (2010) demonstrated\nthat banks with rich human capital not only boosted\ntheir operational efficiency but also accumulated good\nstructural capital by creating innovative capabilities,\nand promising organizational culture. In addition,\nthis study identifies other factors such as information\ntechnology and culture which affect structural capital\nbut are not considered by the researchers such as Shih\nStructural capital significantly affects relational\ncapital (Model 4): In this hypothesized model, the\nrelationship between relational capital and structural\ncapital was tested. The effect of structural capital on\nrelational capital was determined in which all model\nfit indices were found to have acceptable values\ncapital significantly affects relational capital (CR =\nthe relationship between relational capital and struc-\ntural capital to be robust. Hence, Hypothesis H2c is\naccepted. The results support the findings of Cabrita\nand Bontis (2008) that structural capital significantly\naffects customer relationship. Further, they concluded\nthat organizational culture, processes, and innovation\nability attracted or retained more and more customers\nin the organization, thereby enhancing customer\nrelationship in an organization. Unlike studies such\nthis study finds significant role of information tech-\nnology in creating employee relationship and thereby\nenhancing relational capital.\nCONCLUSION\nThe article presents the development of reliable and\nvalid intellectual capital scale for the banking sector.\nAmong the three measurement models, unidimensional\nand two-dimensional models stand rejected due to\ninadequate fit indices while the three-dimensional\nmodel comprising human capital, relational capital, and\nstructural capital as three different dimensions is found\nto be significant in comprehending intellectual capital,\nand is hence accepted. The intellectual capital scale was\nfinalized using data purification consisted of 36 items.\nThe study finds that human capital dimension consists\nof significant items like employee creativity, devoted\nstaff, training and education, experience, attitude and\ninnovative employees, which are also identified as\nimportant ingredients of human capital by studies such\nas Sharabati et al. (2010) and Subramaniam and Youndt\n(2005). In line with the findings of studies, namely,\net al. (2010), relational capital consists of important\nitems like meeting with customers, customer feedback\nand knowledge, and regular customer interaction.\nSimilarly, structural capital, which is a composite of\nsignificant items like structure, systems, information\ntechnology, capabilities, culture, empowerment and\nservice quality is also accepted by researchers such as\n(2010). Further, it is also confirmed that human capital,\nrelational capital, and structural capital positively\naffect intellectual capital. Among the three dimensions,\ncontribution of relational capital with a beta value of\n0.938 is found to be slightly higher than human capital\n(beta value = 0.930) followed by structural capital (beta\nvalue = 0.839) to the intellectual capital. The results are\nconsistent with the studies of Cabrita and Bontis (2008)\nand Allameh et al. (2010) which observed that the three\ndimensions of intellectual capital significantly affected\neach other as well as intellectual capital.\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe present study contributes to the measurement\nstream of intellectual capital research by developing and\nvalidating the measurement scale of intellectual capital.\nThe study has a number of implications for researchers\nand practitioners. This intellectual capital scale\ndevelopment can act as a stimulus for future research\nfor scholars. The study is expected to enable scholars,\npractitioners, managers, and investors to have more\nclear understanding of intellectual capital. Similarly,\nbank managers can have better understanding of how\nintellectual capital develops and drives performance.\nThe managers can use intellectual capital as a tool to\nevaluate organizational performance, which can also\nenable them to know how value can be created with\nthe help of trained, educated, and creative employees\n(Cabrita & Bontis, 2008). Further, relational capital\nbeing a crucial part of intellectual capital can help\nthe managers to know how it can enhance the ability\nof employees through interaction and collaboration\namong themselves and customers. By focusing on high\nvalue-added products and services and good physical\nenvironment, banks can strive for establishing a good\nlong-lasting relationship with the customers (Shih et\nal., 2010). Furthermore, the study provides insights into\nhow the managers can improve bank's structural capital\nby encouraging innovation ability among employees,\npositive culture, and strengthening information\ntechnology in terms of continuously updating software\nand hardware.\nThe present study is confined to scale development of\nintellectual capital in the banking sector of Jammu city,\nIndia. The scale validation needs to be undertaken in\nfuture research to investigate whether the three-dimen-\nsional intellectual capital scale can also be generalized\nfor other industries and countries. Further, researchers\ncan use this intellectual capital scale for theory devel-\nopment, model testing, and scale refinement with addi-\ntion of other dimensions like organizational capital,\nprocess capital, and customer capital as these are\nnot included in the present study. As suggested by\nresearchers such as Ahangar (2011) and Ahmad and\nMusharaf (2011), the inter-relationships of intellectual\ncapital with other factors like competitive advantage,\ninnovation, and learning culture can also be taken into\nconsideration in future to comprehend the concept of\nintellectual capital.\nREFERENCES\nAhangar, R.
