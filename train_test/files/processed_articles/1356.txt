IGT was defined as a 2-h postchallenge glucose\n140 mg/dl (7.7 mmol/l). We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to describe the\nassociation of IGT with commonly available clinical information. A numerical score to predict\nIGT was derived from the results of the multivariate logistic regression models.\n74 years, hypertension, and triglyceride level 150 mg/dl (1.69 mmol/l) were also associated\nwith IGT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for an 8-point scale derived\nscale resulted in high sensitivity (86%), whereas a high cut point of 6 yielded high specificity\n(97%) for the detection of IGT.\nCONCLUSIONS -- A numerical score based on common clinical data can identify individ-\nuals with a low or high likelihood of having IGT.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is an\nimportant intermediate stage in the\nnatural history of type 2 diabetes (1)\nand has been associated with an increased\nrisk for cardiovascular disease and mor-\ntality (2\u00ad4). Recent clinical trials report\nthat lifestyle modifications or pharmaco-\ntherapy among individuals with IGT can\nreduce their risk of developing diabetes\n(5,6). The American Diabetes Association\nrecommends screening for IGT or im-\npaired fasting glucose in men and women\nage 45 years, particularly in those who\nare overweight or obese (7). An oral glu-\ncose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed to\ndiagnose IGT, which is defined as a post-\nchallenge glucose value between 140 and\nabsence of a fasting glucose in the diabetic\nrange (8).\nIn the clinical setting, OGTTs are\nmore costly than fasting or random blood\nmeasurements, are burdensome to ad-\nminister, and are not commonly per-\nformed. Using only an elevated fasting\nplasma glucose to identify individuals at\nhigh risk for glucose intolerance is inade-\nquate and will miss a substantial propor-\ntion of individuals with IGT (8,9). Some\nauthors advocate screening high-risk\npopulations with OGTTs, regardless of\ntheir fasting glucose level, whereas others\ndo not (10\u00ad13). The purpose of this study\nwas to examine the association of com-\nmonly available clinical characteristics\nknown to be associated with IGT using a\nnationally representative U.S. dataset and\nto derive a numerical score based on\nreadily available clinical information to\npredict presence of IGT.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) was\nconducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics at 89 U.S. survey loca-\nused a stratified multistage probability\ncluster design with oversampling of Mex-\nican Americans, African Americans, and\nthe elderly.

By definition, these individuals have\ndiabetes and would require further clini-\ncal intervention (15). Even though the\noutcome as we have defined it includes\nindividuals with diabetes diagnosed only\nby the OGTT, we will refer to the outcome\nas \"IGT\" throughout the rest of the article.\nData were collected on other known\nrisk factors for IGT and diabetes (15).\nStanding height and weight were ob-\ntained during the physical examination\nand were used to calculate BMI. Individ-\nuals were considered obese if their BMI\nwas 30 kg/m2 and were considered\noverweight if their BMI was between 25\nconsidered to have a family history of di-\nabetes if they reported that any first-\ndegree relative had diabetes. Criteria for\nthe metabolic syndrome included ab-\ndominal obesity (waist circumference\nmmol/l), and a serum HDL level 40\nIndividuals were considered to have hy-\npertension if they had a measured blood\nreported being told by their physician\nthat they had high blood pressure.\nStatistical analysis\nData were weighted to account for the un-\nequal probability of selection that resulted\nfrom the survey cluster design, nonre-\nsponse, and oversampling of certain tar-\nweights were used to calculate population\nestimates, and sampling strata and pri-\nmary sampling units were accounted for\nto estimate variances and test for signifi-\ncant differences. Statistical analysis was\nperformed using Stata 7.0 software\n(21,22) to take into account the complex\nsampling design. All results are presented\nas unweighted counts (n) and weighted\npercentages and odds ratios (ORs). Pear-\nson's 2 test was used to determine biva-\nriate associations between socioeconomic\nand health characteristics of IGT.\nWe developed two multivariate mod-\nels with the presence of IGT as the main\ndependent variable. The independent\nvariables in the multivariate models in-\ncluded clinical characteristics associated\nwith IGT in bivariate analysis or from pre-\nviously published literature (8,11). The\nfirst model will be referred to as the \"clin-\nical model\" and includes those data most\nlikely to be available at a routine clinical\nencounter, including sex, age, race/\nethnicity, family history of diabetes, BMI,\nfasting glucose, and blood pressure. The\nsecond model will be referred to as the\n\"full model\" and includes these covariates\nin addition to abdominal obesity and ad-\nditional laboratory tests (triglyceride and\nHDL level). All continuous independent\nvariables were entered into models in cat-\negorical form.\nFor the full multivariate model, we\nassessed goodness of fit with the Hosmer-\nLemeshow test (22). We tested interac-\ntion terms between age, sex, and race/\nethnicity. The risk of IGT predicted for\neach person by the full multivariate model\nwas used to define the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC)\ncurve. To assess the external validity of\nthe full multivariate model, we used an\ninternal bootstrap technique (23) to esti-\nmate the area under the ROC curve for the\npredicted probability of IGT. We also\ntested the full multivariate model among a\nsubsample of individuals with a BMI 24\nkg/m2 and a fasting blood glucose be-\ntwo recent diabetes prevention trials\nWe created a simplified 8-point score\nby replacing significant multivariate\nmodel coefficients (P  0.05) with integer\nvalues (24) as follows: a value of 1 for a\nsignificant multivariate OR between 1.1\nand 3 for an OR of 3. An ROC curve was\nused to describe the diagnostic properties\nof the 8-point scale.\nThe ROC curve plots the sensitivity as\nTable 1--Population characteristics and bivariate correlates of IGT in adults aged 40\u00ad74\nyears in NHANES III\nTotal\n2-h postchallenge glucose\n(mg/dl)\nAge (years)*\nRace/ethnicity\nFasting glucose [mg/dl (mmol/l)]*\nBMI (kg/m2)*\nData are n (%) or % (95% CI).

In this study, cut points of\nthe scale score were examined. The sensi-\ntivity refers to the percentage of individ-\nuals with IGT whose score was above the\ncut point. If the sensitivity increases as the\ncut point increases, with a disproportion-\nately smaller increase in the false-positive\nrate, the area under the ROC curve will be\nlarge. The ROC curve area is smaller if\nfalse-positive cases accumulate more rap-\nidly as the cut point increases. The area\nunder the ROC curve represents the prob-\nability that a subject chosen at random\nfrom a group of people with IGT had a\nhigher point value than an individual\nwithout IGT. Likelihood ratios were cal-\nculated for each cut point of the score.\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive test re-\nsult is the ratio of the probability of a pos-\nitive test result among the truly positive\nsubjects to the probability of the positive\ntest result among truly negative subjects.\nSimilarly, the likelihood ratio for a nega-\ntive test result is the ratio of the probabil-\nity of a negative test result among the truly\npositive subjects to the probability of a\nnegative test result among the truly nega-\ntive subjects.\nAnalyses of the area under the ROC\ncurves were used to assess the full multi-\nvariate model and the 8-point score. We\ncalculated the SE of the area under the\nROC curve and compared areas under the\nROC curve (22). Comparisons of the area\nunder the ROC curve were examined for\nthe full model, the use of fasting glucose\nalone to predict IGT, and the application\nof the model to a subpopulation eligible\nfor diabetes prevention trials (5,6).\nRESULTS -- The population charac-\nteristics of the sample are displayed in Ta-\nble 1. The majority of the sample was\nwhite, and 53% were women. Over one-\nthird of the participants had high blood\npressure, an elevated serum triglyceride\nlevel, or a low serum HDL level. The ma-\njority of the sample was either overweight\nor obese, and almost half of the respon-\ndents had abdominal obesity. Of the sam-\ncorrelates of IGT are displayed in Table 1\nand include increasing age, Mexican-\nAmerican ethnicity, and impaired fasting\nglucose. Characteristics of the metabolic\nsyndrome, including obesity, hyperten-\nsion, elevated triglycerides, and low se-\nrum HDL, were also associated with IGT.\nAn individual's sex or a family history of\ndiabetes was not significantly associated\nwith IGT.\nTable 2 presents the results from mul-\ntivariate logistic regression models pre-\ndicting IGT (F statistic for clinical and full\nmodel, using the most commonly avail-\nable clinical variables, the strongest asso-\nciation with IGT is impaired fasting\n10.9). Other significant associations in-\nclude Mexican-American ethnicity, age\nbetween 60 and 74 years, obesity, and hy-\npertension. When other characteristics of\nthe metabolic syndrome, including ele-\nvated triglycerides, low HDL, and abdom-\ninal obesity, are added in the full model,\nobesity is no longer independently asso-\nciated with IGT. Interactions between\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity were not\nfound to be significantly associated with\nthe presence of IGT (data not shown). The\narea under the ROC curve for the full mul-\ntivariate model predicting IGT was 0.76\nthe area under the ROC curve obtained by\nthe bootstrap procedure compared with\nmer-Lemeshow test did not reject the\ngoodness of fit of the full model (P \n0.11). The full multivariate model had\nsimilar predictive ability for the sub-\nsample of individuals with a fasting blood\nBMI 24 kg/m2 (area under the ROC\ncompared with the entire study sample).\nWhen we excluded the 128 individuals\nfrom the analysis, no difference was noted\nin the predictive ability of the full model\nentire study sample).\nTable 3 presents a scoring system\nbased on the results of the multivariate\nregression analyses. The highest possible\nscore is 8. Because obesity was significant\nin the first model and not in the full model\nafter the addition of triglyceride level, two\nscores were created: one using the triglyc-\neride level and one using obesity.

The area under the ROC\nis significantly larger than the area under\nthe ROC curve for fasting glucose level\nwas similar when obesity was used in-\nstead of triglyceride value to calculate the\nscore (data not shown).\nTable 4 highlights two cut points in\nthe score that may be clinically useful.\nWhen a low cut point is set (for example,\nif the test is considered positive with a\nscore 2), the sensitivity of the score is\nhigh. A total of 86% of individuals with\nIGT had a score 2. Forty-eight percent\nof the sample had a score 2. When the\ncut point is set high (for example, if the\ntest is considered positive with a score of\n6), the specificity is high. Of those with-\nout IGT, 97% had a score 6. The posi-\ntive likelihood ratio of 6.0 for a score of\n6 and the negative likelihood ratio of\n0.2 for a score 2 both generate a mod-\nerate shift in the pretest to posttest prob-\nability of IGT (25).\nCONCLUSIONS -- We present a\nsimple 8-point score based on commonly\navailable clinical data that accurately pre-\ndicts individuals at low and high risk of\nhaving IGT. This scale performs signifi-\ncantly better than fasting glucose level\nalone in identifying individuals with IGT.\nWhen a low cut point of 2 is used to de-\nfine a positive test, the sensitivity of the\ntest is high (86%). Thus, individuals with\na score 2 have a low likelihood of hav-\ning the disease. Further oral glucose tol-\nerance testing may not be necessary in this\nlow-risk group, which comprises almost\nhalf of this nationally representative pop-\nulation of individuals aged 40\u00ad74 years.\nWhen a higher cut point of 6 is used\nto define a positive test, the specificity of\nthe test increases and most individuals\n(97%) without IGT have a score of 6.\nThus, individuals with a score 6 have a\nhigh likelihood of having IGT. Targeting\nindividuals with scores 6 for OGTTs\nmay help identify individuals at high risk\nfor IGT and diabetes among individuals\nwith fasting plasma glucose levels in the\nnondiabetic range. An intermediate score\nbetween 2 and 6 will not help clinicians\ndetermine the risk of IGT, but lifestyle in-\nterventions should be targeted in individ-\nuals with low HDL, high triglycerides,\nand obesity, independent of IGT (18,26).\nThe outcome of the prediction model in-\ncluded 128 subjects with diabetes based\nmmol/l) and a fasting glucose in the non-\ndiabetic range. Although diabetes and\nIGT are distinct categories in terms of glu-\ncose tolerance classification, the identifi-\ncation of either may lead to similar clinical\ninterventions.\nThe strength of this study is the use of\nnationally representative data (8). Our re-\nsults add important evidence for screen-\ning individuals at high risk of IGT based\non commonly available clinical data. Pre-\nvious authors have not advocated using\nclinical data to predict IGT (11). In a pop-\nulation-based study conducted in Swe-\nden, a high-risk screening strategy based\non obesity and family history did not de-\ntect the majority of individuals with IGT\n(11). However, this study had a lower rate\nof obesity than in the U.S., did not use\ntriglyceride or HDL levels in analyses, and\ndid not combine multiple risk factors into\na numerical score. Limitations of our\nstudy include the use of self-reported data\nof socioeconomic and health characteris-\ntics that are subject to recall and other\nbiases. In addition, NHANES III only al-\nlows for population estimates among\nwhite, African-American, and Mexican-\nAmerican populations and does not have\nadequate sample size to make estimates\nabout Asian- or Native-American popula-\ntions.\nRecent clinical trials demonstrated\nthat diabetes can be prevented by behav-\nioral and pharmacological interventions\namong high-risk populations (5,6). Indi-\nviduals were included in these clinical tri-\nals if they had an abnormal glucose\ntolerance, defined by a 2-h response to a\nfixed glucose load. Because of cost and\ninconvenience, the OGTT is rarely used in\nclinical practice. We present a simple\nscore based on commonly available clini-\ncal data to differentiate individuals at both\nlow and high risk for the presence of IGT.\n"
