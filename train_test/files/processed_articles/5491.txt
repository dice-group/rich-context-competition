We have established\na human co-culture model to study myelination. Our earlier\nobservations showed that addition of human -carboxylated\ngrowth-arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) to human oligoden-\ndrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures enhanced their survival\nand maturation. Therefore, we explored the effect of Gas6 in\nco-cultures of enriched OPCs plated on axons of human fe-\ntal dorsal root ganglia explant. Gas6 significantly enhanced\nthe number of myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+ ) oligo-\ndendrocytes with membranous processes parallel with and\nensheathing axons relative to co-cultures maintained in de-\nfined medium only for 14 days. Gas6 did not increase the\noverallnumberofMBP+ oligodendrocytes/culture;however,\nit significantly increased the length of MBP+ oligodendro-\ncyte processes in contact with and wrapping axons.

While a great deal of our understanding\nof myelination comes from studying rodent model systems,\nthere is an incomplete understanding of how efficient myeli-\nnation is achieved during human development, and repar-\native processes occurring subsequent to neurologic diseases\nin the central nervous system (CNS). This lack of knowledge\nhas hampered our understanding of how to optimize treat-\nment for humans. Unlike rodent oligodendrocytes, human\noligodendrocytes do not synthesize mature myelin proteins\nin the absence of axons. Several studies show that addi-\ntional factors that enhance survival, maturation and myeli-\nnation in human-derived models are required. Our goal was\nto combine growth factors that enhance oligodendrocyte\nprogenitor cell (OPC) survival and maturation to generate a\nhuman co-culture model that expresses myelin-synthesizing\nK. N. O'Guin and others\nproteins resulting in myelination. Our earlier studies deter-\nmined that a vitamin K-dependent protein, growth-arrest-\nspecific protein 6 (Gas6), is a survival/maturation factor for\nhuman O4+ OPCs. When maintained in platelet-derived\ngrowth factor (PDGF)-containing medium in the absence of\nGas6 there was significant apoptosis 6 days post-plating. The\naddition of 5.6 nM recombinant human Gas6 prolonged sur-\nvival and promoted the expression of 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide\n3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) protein (Shankar et al., 2003,\nGas6, detected in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (Sainaghi\ncells, can signal through the mitogen-activated protein ki-\nnase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. In the ner-\nvous system, Gas6 is expressed and secreted by several\ntypes of neurons including motor neurons in spinal cord and\nlarge neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (Li et al.,\nwidely in the CNS, and the interaction between Gas6 and its\nreceptors have physiologically relevant function (Crosier and\nGas6 is a ligand for the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) family\nof receptor tyrosine kinase. The relative affinity of Gas6 for\nits receptors is Axl>Tyro3>Mer. In situ hybridization stud-\nies performed in rat CNS demonstrated that members of the\nTAM family are expressed on neurons and in white matter\nTranscription of Axl and Tyro3 are increased in the presence\nof nerve growth factor (NGF), the growth factor essential for\nhealthy axonal outgrowth (Gundersen and Barrett, 1979). RT\u00ad\nPCR studies showed that Axl, Tyro3, and Mer are expressed\nin human O4+ oligodendrocytes (OLs), cultured fetal human\nmicroglia, and all three RNAs are expressed in human fetal\nbrain and spinal cord (Shankar et al., 2003), and in the ro-\ndent CNS (Prieto et al., 2000). We proposed that Gas6 ligand\nreceptor interaction enhances signaling between axons and\nOLs during myelination. By combining growth factors that\nenhance survival and maturation of human OLs and neurons\nwe have generated a human co-culture system that expresses\nmature myelin proteins and can be further manipulated for\na more complete understanding of human myelination.\nHuman fetal tissue including spinal cord, DRG and brain were\nobtained from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository as approved\nby the Institutional Review Board of Albert Einstein College\nof Medicine and state and federal laws.\nDRG explant cultures\nDRGs were prepared from specimens 15 gw. DRGs\nwere stripped of meninges, placed on previously prepared\ncoverslips (12 mm) coated with diluted (1:7) growth\ncovered with 300 l of NB (neurobasal)/F medium. NB/F\nconsists of NB medium containing 2% B27 (Gibco),\n4 mg/ml D-glucose (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco),\n1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco), 50 ng/ml NGF (Harlan)\nsupplemented with 10 M 5-fluorodioxyuridine and uridine\nEvery\n3 days, the medium was alternated with NB medium, NBF\nmedium minus 5-fluorodioxyuridine and uridine. After three\nalternate feeds in NBF and NB, the DRGs were maintained in\nNB until axons radiating from the explant reached the edges\nof the coverslip. The total time frame was 3 weeks. All\nDRG explant cultures selected for co-culture were of similar\naxonal density.\nEnrichment of OPCs\nOPCs were prepared from mixed glial cultures of brain 16\ngw. The fetal mixed glial culture was established from fetal\nbrain tissue 3weeks after the DRGs were plated (Jana et al.,\nin poly-D-lysine-coated T-75 flasks in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 plus 10% FCS for 9 days. An\ninitial 2 h shake-off at 240 rev./min was performed to re-\nmove the microglia and fresh medium was added. On day\nformed to remove the OPCs from the adherent monolayer.\nPrior to plating on the DRG explant the nonadherent OPCs\nfrom the shake-off were purified by two rounds of plating\non uncoated tissue culture dishes for 1 h at 37C, 5% CO2,\nto further eliminate contaminating microglia, and plated on\nthe DRG (see below).\nDirect isolation of OPCs from human fetal brain mixed\nglial cultures was the best method for preserving the integrity\nof OPCs for co-culture. We did not find immunopanning\nto be better than the direct isolation of enriched OPCs.\nBy reducing the amount of manipulation we observed an\nincrease in the total number of viable OPCs, and minimized\ncell death. All lineage-committed OLs express IV\ntubulin\n(Terada et al., 2005). Immunohistochemical examination of\nenriched OPC cultures determined that 95% of the cells\nwere positive for PDGFR, the transcription factor Olig2\nand IV\ntubulin. There were 5% GFAP+ astrocytes and no\ndetectable Iba1+ microglia.\nOPC/DRG co-cultures\nUnless otherwise noted, enriched OPCs purified from mixed\nglial cultures were immediately plated without further cul-\nturing on to the DRG explant at 1\u00d7105 cells/well in de-\nfined medium consisting of DMEM high-glucose medium\nderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Peprotech), 20 ng/ml\n30 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nEstablishment of a human OPC/DRG co-culture\nFigure 1 Generation of human fetal DRG explants (A and B) with parallel arrays of NF+ axons, and enriched OPCs from mixed glial\ncultures (C and D)\n(A) Axons radiating from a DRG explant maintained in culture for 3 weeks.

When co-cultures were maintained in PDGF-containing\nmedium, BDNF and IGF1 were not added. When PDGF was\nremoved from the medium, BDNF and IGF1 were added and\nreferred to as defined medium. Co-cultures were maintained\n. The medium was changed three times/week\nfor 14 days whereupon co-cultures were fixed and analyzed\nby immunofluorescent staining.\nWhile maintaining the DRG explant cultures, the mixed\nglial cultures and the DRG-enriched OPC co-cultures is chal-\nlenging and time consuming, the culture conditions could be\noptimized to obtain consistent results. On average each co-\nculture experiment study took 7 weeks to complete, and an\nadditional 2\u00ad3 weeks to perform immunostaining and data\nanalysis. For our co-cultures, Matrigel was utilized as the\nsupport matrix throughout all the studies.\nGrowing OPCs in culture\nTo determine the purity of the OPCs, enriched OPCs were\nisolated from mixed glial culture (Jana et al., 2007) and\nthen fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

Randomly selected fields were selected on the\nMBP+ (green) channel, selecting MBP+ OLs with no knowl-\nedge of association with the NF+ axon (red).

To measure the length of\naxonal ensheathment by MBP+ oligodendrocyte processes,\nmultiple \u00d760 oil fields were photographed and the length\nof the processes were calculated in ImageJ (NIH). Additional\nmeasurements were obtained following determination of the\nlongest MBP+ process length using Volocity 3D image analy-\nsis software.

Merged images were\nanalyzed for the mean number of condensed stained nuclei.\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise noted, statistical analysis was evaluated in\nGraphPad Prism using the unpaired t test. A Mann\u00adWhitney\ntest was performed to evaluate the length of the longest\nprocesses.\nElectron microscopy (EM)\nCo-cultures maintained for 14 days in defined medium mi-\nnus and plus Gas6 were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde,\nand post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1%\nuranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol\nand embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries). Ul-\ntrathin (80 nm) sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut UCT,\nstained with 0.01% uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate\nToluidine blue-stained 1 m epoxy sections were examined\nby light microscopy (Tsiperson et al., 2010). Co-cultures in\nthe absence of Gas6 were not processed further for EM as\nthe MBP+ immunofluorescent staining indicated that en-\nsheathment was sparse, short or incomplete and, therefore,\nrequisite ensheathment necessary to observe wrapping and\nmyelin by EM would not be observed.\nRESULTS\nEstablishment of DRG/OL co-cultures using\nhuman fetal DRG explants and enriched OPCs\npurified from mixed glial cultures\nThis is the first report of successfully maintaining human fe-\ntal DRG in explant culture with long axons radiating from the\nexplant and reaching the edge of the coverslip. We have de-\ntermined that using growth-factor-reduced Matrigel stabi-\nlized the axons better than fibronectin or poly-lysine alone or\nin combination with Matrigel. Figure 1 shows a DRG explant\nwith parallel arrays of axons by phase microscopy (Figure 1A),\nand axons following incubation with a chick NF polyclonal\nantibody (Figure 1B). In our experience, a 3 week DRG explant\nwas optimal for use for co-culture resulting in axons that ex-\ntended to the edge of the 12 mm coverslip. DRGs less than\n15 gestational weeks could not support MBP+ OL expression\nin co-culture and were not included in analyses. Optimal co-\ncultures were obtained when the age of both the DRG and\nthe OPCs were >16 gestational weeks.\nUsing our current method to isolate enriched OPCs from\nfetal brain, we examined whether addition of Gas6 (2.8 nM,\ntubulin+ OPCs (n = 3 coverslips/treatment)\nwould enhance OPC maturation following 20 days in culture.\nFixed cultures were incubated with antibodies against IV\ntubulin (green) and the transcription factor Olig1 (red), and\nstained with Hoechst dye (blue).

P0 expression was not detected\nin any co-cultures examined. Figure 4 shows that MAG+ (red)\nand MBP+ (green) OLs are expressed in IGF1+ BDNF+ co-\ncultures. MAG+ MBP+ OLs with extensively branched pro-\ncesses were observed both in the absence and presence of\nGas6 (n = 4 coverslips/condition; P > 0.05). In the presence\nof Gas6, MAG+ processes (red, Figures 4G and 4J) and MBP+\nprocesses (green, Figures 4H and 4K) wrapping NF+ axons\n(blue) are observed. In Figures 4I and 4L (arrows), MAG+\nOLs that express little MBP immunoreactivity and have no\nprocesses wrapping axons are shown. OLs expressing MBP\nhave more myelin membrane sheets associated with axon\nensheathment (Figures 4H\u00ad4N). We examined MAG+ MBP+\nOLs by Z-series confocal microscopy and Volocity. All im-\nages were captured at the same laser intensity. Figure 4(M)\nshows three strongly MAG+ OLs from a co-culture grown\nin defined medium minus Gas6. The OL in the lower-left\ncorner is strongly MBP+ and maximal projection indicates\nthat the process is wrapping axons. Consistent with our data,\nOLs grown in defined medium plus Gas6 have more exten-\nsive wrapping. Figure 4(N) shows maximal projection of an\nOL with multiple MBP+ processes wrapping multiple axons.\nMAG expression appears to extend further to the periphery of\nOL processes suggesting that MAG expression precedes MBP\nin outer sheet formation of human fetal OLs (Figures 4M\nand 4N). Co-cultures maintained in the absence or presence\nof Gas6 had a similar percentage of OL processes with MAG\nextending farther than MBP in OL processes along the axon,\nwith functional OLs, we found that a single OL could initiate\nwrapping of a single axon at multiple sites. Also, MBP+ OLs\ncould wrap multiple axons.\nTo further explore if Gas6 consistently enhanced the\nensheathment of axons by MBP+ OL processes, we eval-\nuated MBP+ processes aligned with the axon for ev-\nidence of complete wrapping by Z-series confocal mi-\ncroscopy and 3D analysis. Figure 5(a) shows that in co-\nculture maintained in the absence of Gas6, MBP+ OLs\nprocesses were able to spirally wrap axons (arrow). Fig-\nure 5(b) shows an additional OL with MBP+ processes\nensheathing the axon (arrowhead) (Supplementary Movie\nConsistent with previous experiments, cultures minus Gas6\nhad fewer MBP+ OL processes wrapping axons, and the\nlength of the longest wrap of an OL process completely\naround an axon was significantly shorter.

Figure 6(E) illustrates the axon in Figure 6(D) at\nlow magnification to indicate the OL processes in the upper-\nleft corner contacting the axon at three sites consistent with\nour light microscopic data.\nIn addition to observing multiple OL\u00adaxon membrane con-\ntacts we observed OL processes wrapping the axon support-\ning our light microscopic data. The majority of the wraps\nobserved were one to two wraps of myelin membrane en-\nsheathing the axon and with these co-cultures we did not\nobserve compact myelin. Figures 7(A)\u00ad7(D) shows represen-\ntative axons wrapped in myelin membrane. Interestingly, we\nobserved in several grids with OL membrane wrapping and\nmultiple contacts/adhesions between the axonal membrane\nand the OL membrane; see asterisk in Figure 7(B) and higher\nmagnifications of the contacts in Figures 7(F) and 7(G). Addi-\ntionally, as observed in Figure 7(D), we observed an OL mem-\nbrane wrapping an axon, as well as contacting an additional\naxonal membrane; higher magnification in Figure 7(H). These\ndata show that human fetal OL/DRG co-cultures generate\nnon-compact myelin that is able to contact, elongate, form\nphysical contacts, and ensheath axons. However, ultrastruc-\ntural analysis failed to observe compact myelin in co-cultures\nmaintained in Gas6.\nDISCUSSION\nMyelination of axons is a highly regulated process relying\nupon neuronal activity, adhesion, extracellular ligands, se-\ncreted molecules and receptor engagement on OLs and axons\naxonal initial segment, nodes and termini, the vast major-\nity of axons are ensheathed along their length to maximize\naxonal conductance velocity. In the vertebrate CNS, myelin\nis generated by elongated and flattened OL processes which\nensheath axons in multiple layers of lipid-rich plasma mem-\nbrane. Mature myelin is composed of both noncompact and\ncompact myelin consisting of lipids and several specialized\nproteins synthesized by the OL. MBP, a 14\u00ad22.5 kDa protein,\nis one of the most abundant proteins expressed in myelin.\nMBP is highly charged and interacts with the cytoplasmic\nside of the membrane serving as a molecular sieve to allow,\nas well as restrict, select proteins to be incorporated into\nthe myelin sheath (Aggarwal et al., 2011). Based on the im-\nportant role of MBP in myelination, we developed a human\nco-culture model system to enable us to examine the effect\nof Gas6 and other signaling molecules on MBP expression\nand myelination.\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nK.

Our current data support these findings\nand suggest a role for Gas6 signaling in ensheathment of the\naxon by myelin membranes generating noncompact myelin.\nGas6 is detected in CSF (Sainaghi et al., 2008), and is ex-\npressed in and secreted by motor neurons and large neurons\nits receptors are expressed widely in the CNS (Crosier and\net al., 2000). In situ hybridization studies performed in rat\nCNS demonstrated that members of the TAM family are ex-\npressed on neurons and in white matter during myelination\nthat Gas6/receptor interaction may enhance adhesion and\nensheathment between axons and OLs during myelination,\nwhere high levels of both ligand and receptor are observed\nGas6 activates Axl, Tyro3, and Mer receptor tyrosine ki-\nnases in a concentration-dependent manner. While we have\nno evidence that Axl is the receptor to which Gas6 is signaling\nto in our co-culture model, Axl is preferentially activated by\nGas6 and is expressed during myelination (Prieto et al., 2000).\nAlso, Axl is required for Gas6-enhanced OL survival during tu-\nmor ncerosis factor (TNF) challenge (Shankar et al., 2006). Axl\ncontains two binding sites for Gas6; Tyro3 and Mer each have\none binding site. In the developing CNS, Axl down-regulation\nresults in increased Tyro3 expression, but both continue to be\nexpressed in the mature CNS.

We examined the ability of the human\nDRGs and OPCs to support myelination at several gesta-\ntional ages. OPCs isolated from brains at 14 gestational weeks\nand younger never synthesized MBP+ OLs when co-cultured\nwith DRGs from early or late gestational ages. In two in-\ndependent experiments, we determined that OPCs from 14\ngestational weeks or younger did not mature to MBP+ OLs in\nco-culture even when the co-cultured were maintained for\n21 days. We determined that the DRG gestational week is less\ncritical than the OPC gestational age as 15 gestational week\nDRGs could support myelination of 16 gestational week OPCs.\nOPCs from 19 gestational weeks yield the highest number of\nMBP+ OLs with some co-cultures containing as many as 470\nMBP+ OLs/12 mm coverslip. However, the total percentage\nday 0 was less that 1%.\nWe determined that administration of Gas6 by mini-pump\ndirectly to the corpus callosum enhanced re-myelination fol-\nlowing cuprizone-induced demyelination (Tsiperson et al.,\n2010). Additionally, Gas6-knockout mice had a delay in\nremyelination during the recovery phase following cupri-\nzone withdrawal suggesting that Gas6 promotes myelination\n(Binder et al., 2011).

Our studies\ndemonstrated that multiple OLs can contact a single axon,\nand multiple MBP+ processes from single OLs can ensheath\na single axon, or multiple axons. The nature of the proteins\ncontained at the \"adhesion contact\" observed between the\nOL membrane and the axon by EM requires further analysis.\nA recent paper suggest that both the adhesive properties of\nproteolipid protein and the loss of sialic acid residues from\nthe cell surface during myelinogenesis aid in myelin mem-\nbrane adhesion and the compaction of CNS myelin (Bakhti\nFinally, we examined by EM whether there is a pref-\nerential axonal diameter for initial myelination in our hu-\nman co-cultures. We determined that the majority of myeli-\nnated axons had a mean axon diameter of 5 m. It is\npossible that the limited number of axonal wraps observed\nin our co-cultures is the result of variability in the diam-\neter of the axons. Small axons tend not be myelinated,\nand larger or swollen axons are more difficult to myeli-\nnate. We determined that aged DRG explants maintained\nfor longer than 4 weeks did not efficiently support myelina-\ntion when plated with OPCs in co-culture. Additionally, 1%\nparaformaldehyde-fixed axons did not support human OPC\nformation of MBP+ myelin membranes. While our studies\nshow that Gas6 supports wrapping of noncompact myelin\nmembranes in a human co-culture system, many aspects of\nmyelin biology are still unresolved. Future studies will ex-\nplore additional pathways to determine whether activators\nand inhibitors affect wrapping, and whether Gas6 can syner-\ngize with signal transduction pathways to enhance compact\nmyelin formation. Thus, for successful myelination to occur,\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors must be co-ordinately regu-\nlated both at the axon and at the OL.
