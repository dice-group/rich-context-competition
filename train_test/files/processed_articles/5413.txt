Psychoactive substance use can lead to\ndependence syndrome (World Health Organization (WHO),\n2016). Substance abuse in the current study is therefore\nconcerned with the harmful or hazardous use of psychoac-\ntive substance, including alcohol, illegal drugs, and some\nprescription drugs (Outlaw et al., 2012) such as benzodiaz-\nepines and opioid analgesics.\nSubstance abuse is often misconceived in research and\npractice as an issue affecting only the younger population.\nHowever, substance abuse is not limited to a specific age\ngroup (Koechl et al., 2012).According toAmerican studies,\nthe number of people aged 50\nyears and above in need of\nsubstance-related addiction treatment will reach 4.5million\nposited that the aging of the \"baby boomer\" cohort, those\nsuch higher rates of substance abuse than earlier cohorts.\nSocial gerontologists notice that baby boomers have tested\nmany of the deeply rooted social values and beliefs (Outlaw\net al., 2012), and that this cohort of older adults is more\ncomfortable with alcohol and drug use, as they may have a\nhistory of substance use from when they were young\nSubstance abuse among older people, which is often\nunder-diagnosed, is a significant public health issue.\nResearch has documented that alcohol- and drug-related\nproblems have negative impacts not only on the health and\nwell-being of individuals but also the social aspects of the\nMitchell, 2011). At the individual level, substance abuse\nmay exaggerate the normal slowing of reaction times and\nother physical functions, among older adults. This may\nincrease the risk of falls and accidents (Colliver et al., 2006).\nAt the community and social level, alcohol and drug abuse\npresents a major challenge for the criminal justice system,\nPrevalence of substance abuse and\nsocio-economic differences in\nsubstance abuse in an Australian\ncommunity-dwelling elderly sample\nWendy Li and Nerina Caltabiano\n Keywords\naging, gender, prevalence, socio-economic factors, substance abuse\nJames Cook University, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nWendy Li, College of Healthcare Sciences, James Cook University,\nEmail: Wendy.Li@jcu.edu.au\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nthe health system, and worker productivity (Manning et al.,\n2013). Alcohol and drug abuses are also identified as risk\nfactors for domestic violence and road accidents (Manning\nAlcohol is the most commonly abused substance by\nolder adults (Cummings et al., 2008; Li and Jackson,\npercent of noninstitutionalized people aged\nyears and over were at risk of alcoholism and up to\npercent of the elderly residents of nursing and retire-\nment facilities drank at least moderately or have problems\nrelated to alcohol use. American studies report the preva-\nlence of alcohol abuse in community-dwelling older adults\nranges from 3\npercent. The prevalence of\nalcohol abuse among older people presenting in healthcare\nsettings has been consistently higher, ranging from 5per-\npercent in hospitals, nursing homes, and other\ninstitutional settings (Cummings et al., 2008; Kane and\nSimilar trends of high rates of alcohol abuse among\nolder people in both community samples and healthcare\nsettings are found in other countries. A UK prevalence\nstudy of the community mental health service for older\nadults reported that 30percent of service users drank above\nthe national guidelines for safe consumption of alcohol,\nand that 10percent of service users drank alcohol at depend-\nence levels (Rakshi and Marron, 2011). In Australia, the\n2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (Australian\nyears had high-risk drinking for\nalcohol-related harm or injury over the lifetime.\nIn addition to alcohol, some older adults have also been\nfound to be drug abusers (Li and Jackson, 2016). These\ndrugs include prescription drugs and illicit drugs. Older\npeople are reported to have the highest prescription-drug\nabuse rate of any other age group (Briggs et al., 2011).\nAmong the prescription drugs, benzodiazepines and opioid\nanalgesics are frequently prescribed to individuals aged\n65years and older. In Australia's aged care services, around\n4.4percent of residents report misusing opioids or benzodi-\nThe use of illicit drugs may be increasing in the elderly\npopulation as baby boomers age (Cummings et al., 2008).\nIllicit drugs include marijuana, hashish, cocaine (including\ncrack), inhalants, hallucinogens, heroin, and prescription-\ntype drugs used nonmedically. Latest projections suggest\nsignificant increases in illicit drug use by people aged\n50years and older. According to Colliver et al. (2006), mar-\nijuana use among adults aged 50\nyears and older in the\naddition, use of any illicit drug is estimated to reach 3.5mil-\nlion, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs (opioids,\nsedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants) is projected to\nmillion. While older Australians have generally\nhad the lowest rates of illicit drug use compared to younger\nage groups, recently this age group has begun to show an\nyear\npercent for people aged\nyears and over (Australian Institute of Health and\npercent of older\nAustralians have used pain killers or analgesics for non-\nmedical purposes (Li and Jackson, 2016).\nResearchers strive to establish evidence of socio-eco-\nnomic variables that correlate to substance abuse in the\nelderly population. In the studies that investigate gender dif-\nferences in substance abuse, a consistent finding is that\nelderly women are less frequently diagnosed with alcohol\nand illicit drug addiction disorders than elderly men (Briggs\nwomen are often more vulnerable to prescription drug abuse\nThe relationship between alcohol abuse and loneliness\namong older adults is inconclusive. For example, Briggs\npeople living alone and experiencing isolation, loneliness,\nand lack of social support might be more at risk for excessive\nsubstance use as a way to manage life stressors. However,\nCanham et al.'s (2016) study reported that in a sample of\ncommunity-based adults aged 50\nyears and over, loneliness\nwas not associated with at-risk or binge drinking.\nThe impact of retirement on substance abuse is incon-\nclusive. Kuerbis and Sacco (2012) used alcohol abuse as its\nexample in reviewing the impact of retirement on the drink-\ning patterns of older adults. Several positions appear to pre-\nvail on this issue. From a social network and social role\nperspective, drinking may decrease for retirees as they are\ncut off from their social network of co-workers that encour-\nage alcohol consumption (Wood, 2007). Alternatively,\ndrinking may increase due to greater leisure time and/or\nlessened demand from workplace functioning (Kuerbis and\nSacco, 2012). From a stress and coping perspective, retired\nolder persons may use alcohol to cope with the stress of\nretirement. They may also use alcohol to relieve tension\nand pain or cope with boredom (Adlaf and Smart, 1995).\nIncome and education are two important indicators of\nsocio-economic status. Nevertheless, there is a lack of\nempirical evidence on the associations between substance\nabuse and the income and education of older adults.\nThe Australian National Drug Strategy Household\nSurvey (NDSHS) has been conducted every 2\u00ad3years since\n1985. It provides the substance abuse prevalence of risky\nalcohol consumption and illicit drug usage by age groups\npercent, and\nrespectively, had risky drinking (more than two standard\ndrinks of alcohol on any day). Male had higher rates of\nrisky drinking across three age groups. In the previous\nLi and Caltabiano 3\npercent of\nyears, used can-\nnabis, respectively. Male had higher rates of cannabis use\nacross three age groups. However, it does not assess the\nrelationship between substance abuse and socio-economic\nfactors in older Australians. Australia lacks comprehensive\ninformation about the relationships between substance\nabuse and socio-economic factors.\nTo address the aforementioned research gaps, this article\nuses a community-dwelling sample of older Australians to\nestimate the prevalence of substance abuse in the sample. It\nthen focuses on the relationships between substance abuse\nand gender, age, income, education retirement, living\narrangement, and community involvement. This investiga-\ntion of a non-clinical sample will provide a better under-\nstanding, of the socio-economic risk factors of substance\nabuse among older Australians, to community service pro-\nviders and practitioners.\nMethod\nParticipants and procedure\nRespondents were recruited from three state capital and\ntwo regional cities in Australia. Five hundred letters were\nsent to randomly selected households in telephone books\nto ask whether there were persons aged 55\u00ad90years who\nwere interested in participating in the survey. Thirty-two\nresponses were received. More than 30 senior citizen\nclubs and community groups were approached by research\nassistants of the research project. Meetings were organ-\nized by the organizations who were willing to help in\nrecruiting participants, where the research assistants met\nwith the prospective participants. Research assistants\nexplained the purpose of the research project, outlined the\nrights of a research participant, distributed the participant\ninformation sheet, and answered any questions the pro-\nspective participants had about the project. As a result of\nthe meetings, 235 respondents were recruited. A snow-\nballing technique was also used. Researchers emailed the\ndetails of the study to their networks and/or personal con-\ntacts who were asked to forward the emails to their clients\nand/or friends. Fifty-seven respondents were recruited. As\na result, a total of 324 respondents took part in the survey.\ndeviation (SD)\n=\n8.58). The sample was skewed toward\nthe demographic characteristics of the sample.\nEthical approval was obtained from the Human Research\nEthics Committee at James Cook University. Respondents\nwere informed that the study would be exploring mental\nhealth issues among olderAustralians. Following the provi-\nsion of informed consent, the participants completed a pen-\nand-paper questionnaire and returned it to the researcher or\nused the supplied postage paid envelope.\nMaterials\nSocio-economic variables were measured by gender, age,\nindividual annual income, education level, retirement sta-\ntus, living arrangements, and membership of social/sports/\narts community groups. The scale of Substance Abuse\n(SUB) in the Clinical Assessment Scales for the Elderly\n(CASE) Form S (self-report) was employed to measure\nsubstance abuse. SUB was chosen because it is specifically\ndesigned to assess substance abuse for older persons aged\nbetween 55 and 90years and can be used in the non-clinical\npopulation (for details of SUB, please see Reynolds and\nwere recorded using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from\nNever, Once a Year or Less, Monthly, Weekly to Daily, or\nAlways. The higher the score, the more severe is the sub-\nstance abuse. Sample questions included \"drink to feel bet-\nter,\" \"if I do not have a drink, I start to shake,\" \"rely on\nalcohol or drugs too much,\" and \"my family and I quarrel\nabout my alcohol or drug use.\" SUB has been demonstrated\nto have good reliability, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients\nfor the scale being .92 (Reynolds and Bigler, 2001). For the\ncurrent study, Cronbach's alpha was .83.\nThe CASE manual recommends that a T score of 75 or\nhigher suggests an extreme level of substance abuse; T\nscores between 65\u00ad74 indicate a clinically significant level\nof substance abuse; 55\u00ad64 for a mild to moderately\nVariable n %\nAge (years)\nIncome\n\n\nEducation level\nLiving arrangements\nRetirement\nCommunity group membership\n4 Health Psychology Open \nelevated level of substance abuse; 45\u00ad54 for an average or\ntypical level of substance abuse; and 44 or lower for a low\nto very low level of substance abuse. The present study\nused these cut-off T scores to estimate prevalence levels in\nthis Australian sample. An elevated level of substance\nabuse refers to a tendency to use alcohol and/or drug use to\nregulate mood, and episodic binge drinking may occur in\nthe absence of regular use. A clinically significant level of\nsubstance abuse refers to a clear pattern of alcohol and/or\ndrug abuse. An extreme level of substance abuse refers to\nsevere alcohol and/or drug use problems of a dependent\nnature.\nAnalysis\nLittle's Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test indi-\ncated that missing data were missing completely at random\n(p=.82). Multiple imputation technique was used to replace\nmissing data, which generated five sets of imputed data.\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample.\nFor the estimate of prevalence and analyses of age, income,\nand educational differences in substance abuse scores, the\nparticipants were categorized into three age groups, four\nincome groups, and four educational groups, as shown in\nTable 1. To be consistent with the CASE manual (Reynolds\nand Bigler, 2001), T scores were chosen to transform raw\nscores to standardized scores for the purpose of estimating\nthe prevalence of substance abuse. T-tests and ANOVAs\nwere employed to investigate differences of group means.\nResults\nPrevalence of substance abuse\nTable 2 presents the prevalence of substance abuse broken\ndown by a number of demographic variables.\nSocio-economic differences in substance abuse\nIn order to ascertain socio-economic differences in sub-\nstance abuse mean scores, independent samples t-tests were\nused to test the differences of the mean scores of substance\nabuse between gender (male/female), community involve-\nment (yes/no), retirement (yes/no), and living arrangements\n(with people/living alone). In each of these analyses, the\ndegrees of freedom were higher than expected because the\nresults were pooled from five imputed datasets using multi-\nple imputation.

Being an upper medium, income earner appears to be\na risk factor for substance abuse.\nMale participants had a higher prevalence of substance\nabuse than their female counterparts. The mean score of\nsubstance abuse among males was significantly higher than\nthat of females. This finding is consistent with findings in\nexisting literature that elderly men are more frequently diag-\nnosed with substance abuse than elderly women (Briggs\nTable 2. Prevalence rates of substance abuse by demographic variables.\nVariable Level of substance abuse\nElevated (%) Clinically significant (%) Extreme (%)\nGender\nAge (years)\nIncome\nEducation level\nLiving arrangements\nRetirement\nCommunity group membership\n6 Health Psychology Open \nalso consistent with the finding in NDSHS that theAustralian\nolder men had higher rates of risky substance use (such as\ndrinking and cannabis use) than Australian older women\n(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2013).\nPertaining to age, baby boomers had higher substance\nabuse rates than the previous age cohorts, with their mean\nscores of substance abuse being significantly higher than the\nage cohort of 75years and over. This finding is consistent with\nthe theory that the retirement of baby boomers may result in\nunprecedented high numbers of older substance abusers\nWith regard to income, participants with an upper\nmedium income had the highest substance abuse rates com-\npared with the other income groups. Their mean substance\nabuse scores were significantly higher than those of the low\nincome group. This finding provides empirical evidence\nthat middle class older people may be more vulnerable to\nsubstance abuse compared to their counterparts in other\nincome groups.\nIn relation to retirement status, older retirees had a lower\nprevalence rate of substance abuse than those who were\nworking at the time of the study. The mean score for retir-\nees was significantly lower than that for non-retirees. This\nfinding is consistent with the social network and social role\ntheory that social roles are reduced for retired older people,\nand therefore, alcohol consumption and related problems\nmay reduce. This is particularly the case for older people in\nworkplaces where alcohol use is associated with work-ori-\nented social roles (Kuerbis and Sacco, 2012).\nWith respect to living arrangements, the participants liv-\ning with others reported higher rates in substance abuse\nthan those who lived alone, even though the mean sub-\nstance score difference between the two groups was not\nsignificant. This finding is not consistent with previous\nfindings where loneliness is an at-risk factor of substance\nabuse among older adults. One of the explanations of this\ninconsistency is that people living alone may not necessar-\nily be lonely. Another explanation is that older people, who\nlive with family or friends and who have physical problems\nsuch as pain, may be encouraged by family members or\nfriends to use pain medication (Patterson and Jeste, 1999).\nRegarding community involvement, participants who\nwere part of a social/sporting/arts community group had a\nlower prevalence rate in substance abuse than their counter-\nparts. The mean score of substance abuse among those who\nwere involved with community groups was significantly\nlower than their counterparts. Older people who are not\ninvolved in community activities may be more likely to\nexperience isolation and a lack of social support, and feel\nlonely. Excessive substance use may be employed as a\nmeans to manage isolation and loneliness by some older\nThere are a number of limitations which warrant future\nresearch. The non-probability sampling method limits the\ngeneralizability of the current findings. A randomized,\nlarger-size sample would overcome this limitation.\nMoreover, as Li and Jackson (2016) suggested that cultural\nbackground may play a role in the gender\u00adsubstance abuse\nrelationship, future work may want to consider whether\nmales irrespective of cultural background are more at-risk\nsubstance abusers than females. Furthermore, future work\nmay consider the role cultures play in substance abuse of\nolder Australians. In particular, are older Indigenous\nAustralians more likely than their mainstream counterparts\nto be consuming alcohol at a high-risk level? In addition,\nalthough the manual of CASE states that high scores of\nsubstance abuse always suggest problems associated with\nalcohol use, the CASE does not distinguish between alco-\nhol and drug abuse, which limits the meaningfulness of the\nfindings. It is worth assessing abuses of alcohol, prescrip-\ntion drug, and illicit drug separately.\nDespite the limitations, the article offers insights into the\noccurrence of substance abuse among a volunteer sample of\ncommunity dwelling over 55\nyear olds. Health psycholo-\ngists working with older people and/or those designing pro-\ngrams, which aim at preventing substance abuse among\nolder people, may want to address demographic markers of\ntheir clients in the prevention programs. For example, pre-\nvention programs could be developed to address the follow-\ning risk socio-economic factors identified by the present\nstudy: being a male, baby boomer, non-retiree and an upper\nmedium income earner, and having no involvement in com-\nmunity groups. Moreover, as the initial wave of the baby\n2014), it is important to provide culturally appropriate ser-\nvices to this age group due to the uniqueness of this genera-\ntion of older adults.\nConclusion\nAlthough the current proportions of older adults inAustralia\nwith substance abuse remain low compared to younger age\ngroups, a growing proportion and number of older\nAustralians are at risk for risky drinking, substance misuse,\nand even illicit substance misuse and abuse. The present\nresearch indicates that one in five of the participants experi-\nence substance use that may put them at risk of substance-\nrelated harm in their later life. Being male, baby boomer,\nmore affluent, non-retiree, and less involved in community\nactivities are associated with substance use among the older\npeople in the current study.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthors received financial support from James Cook University\nfor the research and publication of this article.\nLi and Caltabiano 7\nReferences\nAdlaf E and Smart R (1995).
