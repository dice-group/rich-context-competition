In white men, SSF showed a U-shaped association with stroke risk. In white men, stroke risk was\nelevated in the top quartile of BMI only in never smokers. In black women, stroke risk was signi\u00aecantly elevated in the bottom\ncompared to the top quartile of BMI. No signi\u00aecant associations were seen in white women or black men.\nCONCLUSIONS: In white men, SSF showed a U-shaped association with stroke risk, which was elevated in the top quartile of\nBMI only in never smokers. Surprisingly, stroke risk was elevated in black women with the lowest BMI. More studies of these\nassociations are needed, especially in black women.\nKeywords: cerebral infarction; cerebrovascular disorders; obesity; blacks; adipose tissue\nIntroduction\nOverweight and obesity are the second leading cause of\npreventable death in the United States, affecting an esti-\nmated 97 million adults.1 The presence of excess fat in the\ntrunk or abdomen out of proportion to total body fat is an\nindependent predictor of risk factors and morbidity.1 \u00b1 4 Rela-\ntively few studies have attempted to examine body fat\ndistribution as a risk factor for incidence of stroke, especially\nin women and blacks.5,6 In cohorts of white women aged\nsured waist-to-hip ratio increased the risk of self-reported\nstroke over a 2-y or 5-y follow-up.5,6 In both studies, the\nassociation of central obesity with stroke risk was indepen-\ndent of body mass index (BMI). In order to replicate these\n\u00aendings and to examine variation in the association by sex\nand race and other possible effect modi\u00aeers, data from a\nlongitudinal follow-up study of a national sample were\nanalyzed to test the hypotheses: (1) that persons whose\nratio of subscapular to triceps skinfolds was in the highest\nquartile were at increased risk for development of stroke over\nthe follow-up period compared to persons in the lowest\nquartile independent of baseline BMI; (2) that those with\nelevated subscapular skinfold thickness were at increased risk\nfor stroke; (3) that those with increased BMI were at\nincreased risk for stroke; and (4) that these associations\nwere modi\u00aeed by sex, race, BMI level or smoking status.\nMaterials and methods\nThe NHANES I   (NHEFS) is a\nlongitudinal study of participants in the \u00aerst National Health\n*Correspondence: RF Gillum, Of\u00aece of Analysis, Epidemiology, and Health\nPromotion, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) who were\n25 \u00b1 74 y of age at the time of the survey examination in\nlaboratory examinations of NHANES I provided the baseline\ndata for the NHEFS.

Excluded from the\nanalyses were 510 persons with unknown baseline subscap-\nular or triceps skinfold thickness, height, weight, physical\nactivity history, systolic blood pressure, history of recent\nblood pressure medication, serum cholesterol, diabetes his-\ntory, smoking status, alcohol drinking history, hemoglobin\nconcentration, history of heart disease or educational attain-\nment. Additionally, 261 persons were excluded who had a\npositive history of stroke at baseline, de\u00aened as those who\nhad ever been told by a doctor that they had had a stroke\nprior to the baseline interview. After all exclusions, 6936\npersons remained for the analyses (5961 white persons and\n975 black persons), as shown in Table 1. The mean length of\nfollow-up for stroke-free survivors was 19 y.\nOutcome de\u00aenitions\nIncident stroke cases met at least one of the following\ncriteria: (1) a death certi\u00aecate with underlying or non-under-\nusing the International Classi\u00aecation of Diseases Nineth\nRevision (ICD-9); or (2) one or more hospital andaor nursing\nhome stays during the follow-up period with any discharge\ndiagnosis with the following codes using the Clinical Mod-\nwas estimated as one of the following: (1) date of \u00aerst\nhospital admission with a stroke diagnosis; or (2) date of\ndeath for stroke deaths without any stroke hospital records.\nThe subgroup nonhemorrhagic stroke was de\u00aened by the\nunderlying or non-underlying cause of death ICD-9 433 \u00b1\nwithout associated 431.

The triceps skinfold was measured posteriorly at the\nhalfway point between the outer edge of the acromion\nprocess and the olecranon process of the ulna. Technicians\nalso measured height and weight.13 The ratio of subscapular\nto triceps skinfold thickness (SFR) was used as an indicator\nof truncal vs peripheral distribution of body fat.6\nTable 1 Age-speci\u00aec incidence of stroke by approximate quartile of\nsubscapularatriceps skinfold ratio\nQuartile Cases n at risk Person-year Incidencea1000 person years\nWhite men\nWhite women\nBlack men\nBlack women\nObesity, overweight and stroke\nRF Gillum et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nUnfortunately, neither waist nor hip girth were measured in\nNHANES I.

Sex \u00b1 race \u00b1 speci\u00aec approximate quartiles of each\nvariable were de\u00aened using cutpoints shown in the Appen-\ndix.\nThe baseline medical history questionnaire provided\ninformation about selected conditions (for example diabetes)\ndiagnosed by a doctor.7,9 A positive history of heart disease at\nbaseline was de\u00aened as having ever been told by a doctor\nthat one had ever had a heart attack or heart failure or\nhaving used any medicine, drugs or pills for a weak heart\nduring the six months prior to the baseline interview. At the\nbeginning of the baseline physical examination, the physi-\ncian measured blood pressure with the examinee seated.14\nOther baseline variables were measured as described else-\nStatistical methods\nStroke incidence rates were calculated as the number of\nincident cases per 1000 person-years of follow-up at ages\nfor persons with higher quartiles of SFR, SSF or BMI relative\nto those with in the lowest quartile derive from Cox propor-\ntional hazards regression models computed using the PHREG\nprocedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).17 Persons\nwho did not develop stroke were censored at either the date\nof their last follow-up interview or their date of death. Tests\nof the signi\u00aecance of trends across quartiles of these variables\nwere conducted by treating the four quartiles as ordered\ncategories.\nControl variables in regression models were selected based\non the literature to identify potential confounders and also\nmediators of hypothesized effects of SFR, SSF and BMI on\nstroke risk. In preliminary analyses BMI2 in addition to BMI\nseemed appropriate for inclusion in some subgroups in SFR\nand SSF models and was included in all such models for\nconsistency. All SSF models included age at baseline in single\nyears and BMI and BMI2 as covariates. All SSF and BMI\nmodels included age at baseline in single years as a covariate.\nRisk-adjusted models included current cigarette smoking\n(yes, no), alcohol consumption in the past year (yes, no),\neducational attainment (` 12 y, ! 12 y), hemoglobin con-\ncentration (gadl), hemoglobin concentration squared, his-\ntory of heart disease (yes, no), and nonrecreational physical\nactivity level (low, medium, high). Risk- and mediator-\nadjusted models included the preceding variables plus sys-\ntolic blood pressure (mmHg), history of current blood pres-\nsure medication, serum cholesterol (mgadl), and history of\ndiabetes (yes, no). Separate models were developed for white\nmen, white women, black men and black women.\nTo assess the effect of the complex survey design on the\nresults, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were\nperformed using PROC SURVIVAL in SUDAAN to incorporate\nthe sample weights and the strati\u00aecation and clustering in\nthe analysis.18,19 The results were consistent with minimal\neffects of the complex survey design on the main conclu-\nsions derived from the unweighted estimates. Therefore the\nestimates from the unweighted Cox regression models are\npresented.\nResults\nBody fat distribution (SFR)\nIncidence rates of stroke per 1000 person-years are shown in\n(Table 1). At ages 45 \u00b1 74, Kaplan-Meier survival curves failed\nto show signi\u00aecant differences among quartiles (not shown).\nIn Cox regression analyses controlling for age, BMI and\nBMI2 risk of stroke was not signi\u00aecantly associated with\nquartile of SFR in black men or in black or white women\naged 45 \u00b1 74 (Table 2). The lack of association persisted after\ncontrolling for multiple confounders. Results were\nunchanged after controlling for the mediating variables\nsystolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, his-\ntory of diabetes and serum total cholesterol concentration\n(Table 2). For nonhemorrhagic stroke, no signi\u00aecant associa-\ntions were seen. Interactions of SFR with age, BMI and\nsmoking were nonsigni\u00aecant in blacks or white women.\nIn white men the results were complex and somewhat\ninconsistent. In all white men aged 45 \u00b1 74, relative risk of all\nstroke was signi\u00aecantly elevated in the fourth quartile of SFR\n(Table 2). However, for all stroke (P  0.003) and nonhemor-\nrhagic stroke (P  0.005), signi\u00aecant interactions of SFR and\nBMI were observed in regression models with SFR and BMI\nentered as continuous variables with an interaction term.\nThe negative coef\u00aecient of the interaction terms indicated\nthat the effect of SFR was less at higher levels of BMI.\nFurthermore, regression models indicated interactions of\nSFR with smoking as well as BMI.

A signi\u00aecant positive association of SFR and stroke risk\nwas observed in former smokers with BMI above the median.\nA nonsigni\u00aecantly increased risk was also seen in the fourth\nquartile of those with low BMI. The direction of the\nSFR\u00c2BMI interaction in former smokers was the reverse\nof that in all white men. Because of this inconsistency and\nthe necessary use of imputed smoking data for about half\nthe sample, no \u00aerm conclusions can be drawn about the\nassociation of SFR and stroke in white men.\nTruncal obesity (SSF)\nFigure 1 shows the incidence rate of stroke per 1000 person-\nyears of follow-up in whites by age, sex and quartile of SSF,\nand indicator of obesity. In white men aged 65 \u00b1 74, the\nincidence rate of stroke was highest among those with\nhigh SSF, and lowest among those in the second quartile\nObesity, overweight and stroke\nRF Gillum et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\n(Figure 1). In white women, no consistent pattern was seen\nfor SSF. A trend towards an inverse association of SSF with\nincidence rates was seen in blacks.\nIn white men, Cox regression models con\u00aermed a U-\nshaped relationship of SSF with stroke risk with the lowest\nrisk in the second quartile. When SSF was entered in models\nwhich controlled for age, BMI and BMI2, a U-shaped pattern\npersisted in white men (Table 3), essentially the same as that\nshown for SSF, not controlling for BMI (Figure 1). For non-\nhemorrhagic stroke in white men, the U-shaped pattern\nwith lowest risk in the second quartile of SSF was also seen\n(Table 3). In black women aged 65 \u00b1 74, stroke risk was\nhighest in the \u00aerst quartile of SSF (Figure 1). Signi\u00aecant\nassociations of SSF with stroke risk were no longer present\nafter controlling for BMI and BMI2 in sex, race groups except\nwhite men (Table 3). Signi\u00aecant associations of SSF with\nstroke risk were not observed in white women or black men\nin any models.\nSince previous reports have indicated effect modi\u00aecation\nby smoking with effects of obesity restricted to nonsmokers,\nregression models were done in white men within smoking\ncategories (not shown). In white men, a nonsigni\u00aecant U-\nshaped relationship of SSF and stroke risk was seen in current\nsmokers, nonsmokers (former and never) and never smokers.\nNo effect modi\u00aecation by smoking was seen in white women\nor in blacks.\nTable 2 Relative risks for stroke incidence associated with the ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness in women and men aged 45 \u00b1 74 y; NHEFS\nAge- and BMI-adjusted Confounder-adjusted a Confounder- and mediator-adjusted b\nDiagnosis, sex, race and\nbaseline skinfold ratio quartile RR (95% CI) RR (95% CI) RR (95% CI)\nWhite men\nAll stroke\nNonhemorrhagic stroke\nBlack men\nAll stroke\nNonhemorrhagic stroke\nWomen\nAll stroke\nWhite\nBlack\nNonhemorrhagic stroke\nWhite\nBlack\naAdjusted for baseline age, smoking, history of heart disease, low education level, body mass index, nonrecreational physical activity, alcohol use, hemoglobin\nconcentration, and hemoglobin concentration squared.\nbAdjusted for the variables above, and systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, history of diabetes and serum total cholesterol concentration.\nRR, relative risk; 95% CI, 95% con\u00aedence limits.

A trend towards an inverse association of BMI with\nincidence rates was seen in blacks.\nSince previous reports in white men have indicated effect\nmodi\u00aecation by smoking with effects of overweight\nrestricted to nonsmokers, regression models were done in\nwhite men within smoking categories (Table 4). In white\nmale never smokers, risk was signi\u00aecantly elevated in the\nfourth compared to \u00aerst BMI quartile (Table 4). In current\nsmokers, former smokers or in ever smokers (former and\ncurrent), no signi\u00aecant association was seen (Table 4). A\nsimilar pattern was seen for nonhemorrhagic stroke. Thus\nin white men, smoking modi\u00aeed the effect of BMI on stroke\nrisk, with the effect of elevated BMI restricted to never\nsmokers. No effect modi\u00aecation by smoking was seen in\nwhite women or in blacks.\nIn black women, the highest risk of stroke occurred in the\ncontrolling for age or multiple confounders).

Top panel whites, bottom panel blacks.\nObesity, overweight and stroke\nRF Gillum et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nDiscussion\nThis paper reports one of the few longitudinal studies of\ncentral obesity and the subsequent development of stroke\ncontrolling for baseline BMI. It provides the \u00aerst data for\nblacks, who suffer disproportionately from stroke. Data\nfrom NHEFS showed a complex relationship among\nstroke risk, SFR, BMI, smoking, sex and race. SFR was\nnot a signi\u00aecant predictor of stroke risk in white women\nor in black men or women. Higher SFR was associated\nwith a mildly increased incidence of stroke in white male\nformer smokers, especially those with high BMI. Reasons\nwhy this association seemed limited to white male former\nsmokers are unknown but may include gender and racial\ndifferences in pathophysiology and etiology of cerebral\ninfarction (ie extracranial vs intracranial atherosclerosis,\nlarge vs small vessel or lacunar infarction, indistinguish-\nable in this study), effects of smoking on weight and fat\ndistribution, bias due to use of imputed smoking data in\nhalf the cohort, andaor to chance (wide con\u00aedence limits\nfor former smokers). In white men, a U-shaped association\nof SSF and a direct association of BMI with stroke risk was\nseen. In black women, stroke risk was elevated in the top\nquartile of SFR, but in the bottom quartiles of SSF and\nBMI. Effect modi\u00aecation of the positive association of\nstroke risk with BMI level by smoking status was observed\nin white men, effects being greatest in never smokers. No\nsigni\u00aecant associations were seen in white women or\nblack men.\nTable 3 Relative risks for stroke incidence associated with quartile of subscapular skinfold thickness in persons aged 45 \u00b1 74 y; NHEFS 1971 \u00b1 1992.\nAge- BMI- and BMI2 adjusted Confounder-adjusteda Confounder- and mediator-adjustedb\nDiagnosis, sex, race and\nbaseline skinfold thickness quartile RR (95% CI) RR (95% CI) RR (95% CI)\nMen\nAll stroke\nWhite\nBlack\nNonhemorrhagic stroke\nWhite\nBlack\nWomen\nAll stroke\nWhite\nBlack\nNonhemorrhagic stroke\nWhite\nBlack\naAdjusted for baseline age, smoking, history of heart disease, low education level, nonrecreational physical activity, alcohol use, body mass index, body mass index\nsquared, hemoglobin concentration, and hemoglobin concentration squared.\nbAdjusted for the variables above, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, history of diabetes, and serum total cholesterol concentration.\nRR, relative risk; 95% CI, 95% con\u00aedence limits. Reference group is quartile 1.\nObesity, overweight and stroke\nRF Gillum et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nMechanisms have been suggested for an association of\ntruncal and abdominal obesity with the incidence of\nischemic stroke.5,6 Elevated SFR might be a marker for a\nstate characterized by increased truncal and visceral fat\nleading to insulin resistance and increased plasma insulin\nlevels with resulting dyslipidemia, glucose intolerancea\ndiabetes and increased sympathetic nervous system activity\nand decreased renal sodium excretion. These may produce\narteriosclerosis and hypertension.20 \u00b1 24 Previous reports have\ndemonstrated abdominal obesity to be an independent risk\nfactor for coronary heart disease.25,26 Similar mechanisms are\npostulated for overall obesity and overweight.27 Excess car-\ndiovascular risk at low levels of SSF or BMI have been\nattributed to high rates of weight loss, smoking, alcohol\nuse, subclinical disease, and comorbidity in thin per-\nSFR likely measures a somewhat different aspect of relative\nbody fat distribution than other measures such as waist\ncircumference or waist \u00b1 hip ratio.31 \u00b1 33 Although likely not\nan optimal measure, especially for clinical settings,1 its\nadvantages are long-established standardized methods and\nwide availability in data sets from large population surveys.\nSubscapular skinfold measures subcutaneous truncal fat, a\nsomewhat different aspect of absolute truncal body fat than\nmeasures such waist girth, which measures subcutaneous\nand intraabdominal fat, or intraabdominal fat on computer-\nized tomographic scanning for visceral fat. Unlike the girth\nor radiographic measures, skinfolds do not directly re\u00afect\nvisceral fat. However, reported associations with incidence of\nhypertension have been similar.2,5 Further in other studies\nusing computed tomography or MRI, subcutaneous abdom-\ninal fat was at least as strong a correlate of insulin sensitivity\nas visceral fat, and retained signi\u00aecance after controlling for\nvisceral fat.32 \u00b1 34 Further an android pattern of skinfold\nthicknesses was associated with greater absolute and propor-\ntional amounts of visceral adipose tissue than a gynoid\npattern.35 Skinfolds should not be affected by changes in\nlean body mass with aging.\nPrevious studies have yielded con\u00aficting results, most\ndemonstrating an association of central body fat distribution\nwith increased stroke risk independent of overall obesity\nFigure 2 Incidence of stroke per 1000 person-years by quartile of body mass index in persons aged 45 \u00b1 64 and 65 \u00b1 74 y at baseline: NHANES I\n , 1971 \u00b1 1992.

Reference group is quartile 1.\nObesity, overweight and stroke\nRF Gillum et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nIn middle-aged Japanese men in Hawaii, subscapular\nskinfold thickness, but not BMI, or SFR was signi\u00aecantly\nassociated with risk of stroke over a 20-y follow-up.42 In\nmiddle-aged Finnish men, subscapular skinfold was\npositively associated with stroke incidence independent of\nBMI and other variables including plasma insulin.41 In the\nFramingham Study, waist-to-height ratio was related to\nstroke in men and women.37 Other studies reported waist-\nto-hip ratio to be positively associated with stroke risk in\nPrevious studies of obesity (SSF) and overweight (BMI) and\nstroke risk yielded con\u00aficting results. Overall overweight or\nobesity was independently associated with stroke risk in\nassociations of SSF or BMI with stroke risk have been\ndescribed.45 \u00b1 47 It seems likely that elevated BMI is a risk\nfactor only for ischemic stroke.27 Interactions with smoking\nand hypertension have been suggested.43,46 Recent weight\nloss was associated with increased stroke risk.45\nLimitations\nLimitations of the study include possible bias arising from\nloss to follow-up, missing data on baseline risk variables,\nand, for the incidence analysis, missing hospital data at\nfollow-up. However, repeating the regression analysis for\ntotal stroke including cases of self-reported stroke without\na matching medical record at follow-up (87 in whites, 21 in\nblacks) produced no major changes in the results. A further\nsource of possible bias was misclassi\u00aecation due to inaccu-\nracy of diagnoses coded on death certi\u00aecates and medical\nrecords, especially regarding stroke subgroups.48 \u00b1 50 Inaccu-\nracy of baseline history of stroke could result in cases being\nidenti\u00aeed during follow-up that were actually diagnosed\nprior to baseline. Further, for stroke incidence the year of\nonset was taken as the year of \u00aerst hospitalization but this\ncould be in error if an earlier hospitalization for stroke was\nnot reported or the records not found. Extensive athero-\nsclerosis might itself cause weight loss. Exclusion of preva-\nlent stroke cases at baseline and controlling for history of\nheart disease make this an unlikely source of bias in this\nanalysis.\nLack of valid measures or errors in measurement of body\nfat distribution, obesity or overweight could be a source of\nbias.51,52 However, the rigorously standardized measurement\nprotocols used minimized measurement errors, which in any\ncase should be random producing bias towards the null.\nFurther, adipose tissue distribution and weight are not\nstable over long periods of time; this causes misclassi\u00aecation\nwhen only a baseline measure is used.28 It seems likely,\nhowever, that any bias would be toward the null. Means\nand distributions of multiple baseline characteristics of the\nNHEFS cohort by SFR level have been published.2,26\nErrors in measurement of other baseline variables could\nalso result in bias but this seems unlikely given the standar-\ndized nature of the NHANES I examination. One exception\nwas baseline smoking data, which were derived or imputed\nfrom follow-up interview questions for about half the\ncohort. However, this approach has been judged valid for\nanalyses of mortality.16 Confounding by variables not mea-\nsured cannot be excluded. Statistical power was lower for\nblacks than for whites. However, when analyses for blacks\nwere repeated using tertiles instead of quartiles of obesity\nvariables, results were consistent with those using quartiles\nas shown.\nMost cases of stroke occurred in persons aged 65 \u00b1 74 at\nbaseline. Increased stroke incidence was linked to central\nobesity and overweight in white men. Previous analyses of\nBMI and BMI change and mortality in this cohort suggest\nthat this excess risk might be preventable by primary pre-\nvention of overweight (BMI b 25), but probably not by\nloss in those over 65 may be caused by a number of chronic\ndisabling conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, claudi-\ncation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteo-\nporosis among others.28 Nevertheless, the \u00aendings regarding\neffects of maintaining acceptable BMI throughout young\nadulthood and middle age and mortality together with the\nlow percentage of men in whom this occurs, suggests a\nsigni\u00aecant role for obesity and overweight prevention in\nstroke prevention at least in white men.1,28,53 Despite the\nassociation of low SSF and BMI with increased stroke risk in\nblack women, primary prevention of obesity and overweight\nmight still be bene\u00aecial, if stroke victims had low body\nweight due to weight loss from extensive comorbidity,\nfurther research in this group is needed.\nConclusions\nIn a complex relationship, higher SFR was associated with a\nmildly but signi\u00aecantly increased incidence of stroke only in\nwhite male former smokers, especially those with high BMI.\nSeveral possible mechanisms for such an association have\nbeen suggested. SSF showed a U-shaped association with\nstroke risk. In white men, stroke risk was elevated in the\ntop quartile of BMI only in never smokers. In black women,\nstroke risk was elevated in the bottom quartile of BMI. More\nstudies of these associations with stroke risk are needed,\nespecially in former smokers and black women. Studies\nshould clarify the relationship of subcutaneous truncal\nfat, intraabdominal fat, and total fat and their relative\nimportance in the pathogenesis of various types of cerebral\ninfarction.\n"
