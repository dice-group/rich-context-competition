Furthermore, many college students regularly\nengage in unhealthy behaviors, placing them at risk for\ndeveloping serious health problems later in life (Heller and\n2004). However, in a longitudinal study examining positive\nwell-being and health outcomes, Hoyt et al. (2012) reported\nthat positive well-being during adolescence predicted fewer\nrisky health behaviors in young adulthood. Given the above\nfindings, the assessment and promotion of wellness within\nthe undergraduate student population are imperatives.\nOne of the overarching goals of the Healthy Campus\n2020 initiative is to promote quality of life, healthy devel-\nopment, and positive health behaviors on college campuses\n(US Department of Health and Human Services, 2012).\nFurthermore, promoting wellness within academia reduces\ndisease frequency and enhances both mental and physical\nwellness behaviors can be learned. Once internalized by the\nindividual, holistic wellness can reduce issues related to\nsomatization, psychoticism, and interpersonal sensitivity\nThis study was undertaken as an examination of well-\nness factors among undergraduate students attending a lib-\neral arts or research institution. Although a variety of\ntopics could be discussed in this context (e.g. happiness,\nmeaning, and autonomy), we focused on several dimen-\nsions of holistic wellness (physical, emotional, social,\noccupational, and intellectual) as conceived by Hettler\n(1984). To date, studies that examine holistic wellness as a\nfunction of institutional type are scant.

We posit that holistic wellness contributes to student\nsuccess, and the cultivation of wellness is a valuable insti-\ntutional commodity.\nWellness concept\nWellness, as a concept, captures in many ways the broader\ndefinition of health. The World Health Organization (1948)\nredefined health to be a complete state of physical, mental,\nand social well-being, and not merely the absence of dis-\nease and infirmity. Shortly after, Dunn (1961) coined the\nphrase \"high-level-wellness\" to refer to a state of optimal\nhealth that included, a zest for life, sense of meaning and\npurpose, sense of social responsibility, developing ways to\nmaximize an individual's potential for well-being, and\nacquiring skills for adapting to the challenges of a changing\nenvironment.\nOver the years, wellness has been conceptualized as a\nmultidimensional phenomenon (Keyes, 2009; Miller and\nsional model of psychological well-being, which comprises\nsix distinct components. These include autonomy, environ-\nmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, positive\nrelations with others, and self-acceptance. However, this\nmodel fails to incorporate the physical aspects of wellness\nand thus limiting usefulness in addressing wellness as a\nIn this study, we used Hettler's (1984) model of holistic\nwellness. This model was developed to promote wellness in\nuniversity and community settings. It has been used to\nmodify health behaviors in college students (Gieck and\nOlsen, 2007) and enhance prevention and treatment of dia-\nbetes (Klepac, 1996). Holistic wellness consists of six\nbroad dimensions of health-related behaviors: Physical\nWellness (e.g. diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol use,\nand personal hygiene), Emotional Wellness (e.g. self-iden-\ntity and self-esteem), Spiritual Wellness (e.g. sense of peace\nand connectedness with the universe), Social Wellness (e.g.\nsense of community and social support), Occupational\nWellness (e.g. job satisfaction), and Intellectual Wellness\n(e.g. creative stimulating mental activities).\nAccording to Hettler (1984), a person who strives for\nholistic wellness is one who is aware of all aspects of well-\nness and consciously works to incorporate these elements\ninto one's daily life. In other words, the pursuit of wellness\nis a lifelong endeavor, and educational facilities are ideal\nsettings for wellness promotion (Harrington, 2016; Miller\net al., 2008). Regardless of the number of wellness dimen-\nsions, researchers agree that wellness is a multidimensional,\npositive, and affirming concept that has enormous practical\nand therapeutic benefits (e.g. Harrington, 2016; Hattie et al.,\nLiberal arts and research institutions\nHistorically, small liberal arts colleges have proclaimed a\ndistinctive mission by providing students with an educa-\ntional experience which fosters intellectual openness,\nlearning for their own sake, high-quality teaching, smaller\nclass sizes, and frequent student\u00adstudent and student\u00adfac-\nulty interactions both in and out of the classroom (Bovillian\nhigher education suggests that students attending a small,\nprivate, liberal arts college are more likely to experience\ngood practices in undergraduate education (e.g. effective\nteaching, active learning, and high academic expectations)\ncompared to students attending other academic institutions\net al., 2008). For example, liberal arts colleges were the\nfirst institutional type to implement Chickering and\nGamson (1987) Good Practices in Undergraduate\nTeaching Model. This model identifies seven principles for\ngood practices in undergraduate teaching (e.g. active learn-\ning, respect for diversity, student\u00adfaculty contact, and high\nacademic expectations). Seifert et al. (2010) recently\nexamined the degree to which first year undergraduate stu-\ndents attending a college (2 or 4years) or a research uni-\nversity experienced these principles. For the most part, the\nexperiences were similar, except for two principle out-\ncomes: (1) good teaching and high-quality interaction with\nfaculty and (2) academic challenge and high expectations.\nMoreover, they found that students who were less prepared\nfor college (e.g. lower levels of parental education, aca-\ndemic motivation, and involvement in high school activi-\nties) tended to benefit the most from a liberal arts education.\nAlthough the findings are somewhat encouraging, this\nstudy did not assess other measures of student success\nsuch as emotional well-being.\nResearch universities, on the other hand, articulate a\nmission statement to discover, preserve, and disseminate\nknowledge as well as advance scientific and technological\nresearch (Jacobs and Hyman, 2010). As a result, undergrad-\nuate students are presented with a plethora of research\nopportunities which have been linked to increased confi-\ndence and awareness, increased cumulative grade point\naverage, increased anticipation of a PhD, and clarification\nof interest in science, technology, engineering, and math\nWalkington, 2015). Students and alumni surveyed at a\nresearch institution reported that working collaboratively\nwith peers and faculty mentors engaged in research was\nimportant for developing skills and increasing their aca-\ndemic confidence (Levis-Fitzgerald and Denson, 2005).\nSimilarly, Gilmore et al. (2015) recently investigated the\nassociations between undergraduate research experiences\nand research skill performance, autonomy, collaboration,\nand motivation at the graduate school-level. They found the\nBaldwin et al. 3\nundergraduate research experience (e.g. design, data col-\nlection, and analyses) was associated with heightened grad-\nuate school performance in all research skills assessed.\nHowever, the examination of wellness factors as a measure\nof student success was not assessed.\nPurpose of this study\nBoth research and liberal arts academic institutions are\ndevoted to developing teachers, scholars, and other profes-\nsionals capable of achieving and contributing to society-at-\nlarge. Despite these noble similarities, it is unclear how\nthese academic institutions compare on measures of holis-\ntic wellness. Research suggests that wellness has a lifelong\neffect on academic, business, and individual success (Dolan\nmate dependent variable is human well-being, and all other\noutcomes derive their importance. The primary purpose of\nthis study was to examine differences in reported wellness\nin undergraduate college students attending a land grant\nresearch university or a small liberal arts college with a\nteaching mandate. To our knowledge, this is the first study\nto examine wellness within this context. Although this is a\npreliminary study, we expect differences to emerge between\nthe two academic institutions.\nMethods\nSample\nA total of 211 undergraduate students attending a research\nuniversity (n\n=\n85) or a small, private liberal arts college\n(n=126) located in the southeast participated in this study.\nParticipants were recruited using word of mouth, and the\nmajority of the participants were psychology majors. A\ntotal of 63percent of the participants were female (n=132),\nyears (standard deviation\n(SD)\n=\npercent identified as Caucasian,\n7.1percent as African American, 1.4percent as Hispanic or\nLatino, 1percent as Asian American, and 3.3percent as bi-\nracial. The majority of the participants were upperclassmen\n(96%), and 57.1percent of the participants were employed.\nSample characteristics as a function of institution type are\npresented in Table 1.\nMeasures\nDemographic survey.We assessed all demographic varia-\nbles (e.g. age, race, sex, and employment) using single\nitems, which allowed participants to select from a variety of\nresponse options. Our wellness measures are as follows:\nPhysical Wellness--Health Behaviors. Diet and exercise\nwere assessed using the modified Health Behavior\nitems, and participants were asked to indicate how accu-\nrately each item describes their health habits. Responses\nrange from 1 (never) to 5 (daily). High scores suggest\nthat diet and exercise habits are fairly good. For this\nstudy, Cronbach's alpha was .83.\nEmotional Wellness--The Perceived Stress Scale. This\nscale (Cohen et al., 1983) was used to assess global non-\nspecific stress levels during the last month. This survey\ncomprised 14- items, of which 7 are positively formu-\nlated (e.g. In the last month, how often have you felt\nthings are going your way?) and 7- items which are nega-\ntively formulated (e.g. In the last month, how often have\nyou felt that you were unable to control the important\nthings in your life?). This is a widely used instrument,\nand higher scores indicate greater stress levels.\nResilient coping.Coping was measured using the Brief\nResilient Coping Scale (BRCS; Sinclair and Wallston,\n2004). This is a four-item survey that was designed to\nmeasure an individual's tendency to cope with stress in a\npositively adaptive manner. Participants were prompted to\nconsider how well the items describe their behavior (e.g. I\nbelieve I can grow in positive ways by dealing with diffi-\ncult situations) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1\n(does not describe you at all) to 5 (it describes you very\nwell). Convergent validity was demonstrated on measures\nof personal coping resources and psychological well-being\nin two samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Cronbach's\nalpha for this study met minimal standards (.70).\nThe Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This scale\n(Rosenberg, 1965) assessed global feelings of self-\nworth or self-acceptance. This is a 10-item scale, and it\nis one of the most well used measures to assess self-\nesteem (Blascovich and Tomaka, 1991). It is rated on a\n4-point scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly\ndisagree). Scores lower than 15 are considered indica-\ntive of low self-esteem. This instrument reportedly has\nTable 1. Descriptive characteristics of participants as a\nfunction of institution type.\n4 Health Psychology Open \ngood test\u00adretest reliability according to Fleming and\nSocial Wellness--Need to Belong. This scale assesses\nthe degree to which respondents desire to be accepted by\nothers, seek opportunities to belong to social groups,\nand react negatively when they are shunned, rejected, or\nand participants responded on a 5-point scale ranging\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher\nscores indicate a greater need to belong. In this study,\nCronbach's alpha was .92.\nIntellectual Wellness--Self-Efficacy. The New General\nSelf-Efficacy Scale (Chen et al., 2001) was used to\nmeasure an individual's belief in their ability to meet\ntask demands in a broad array of contexts. This is a short\nscale (eight items), and responses are based on a 5-point\nLikert scale where scores range from strongly disagree\nto strongly agree. High scores indicate higher general\nself-efficacy levels. According to Chen et al. (2001,\n2004), the psychometric evidence for this measure is\npositive. Cronbach's alpha was .88 in this study.\nOccupational Wellness. For this wellness measure, par-\nticipants were asked about their job status. Participants\nresponded with yes or no to job status items such as full-\ntime, part-time, or unemployed.\nProcedure and data analyses\nAfter obtaining informed consent, the survey package was\nadministered during regular class time. All participants\nreceived extra credit, and this study was approved by both\nschools' institutional review boards. The data were col-\nanalyzed using SPSS version 21 (Cary, NC). To determine\nthe differences between groups (e.g. institution type or\ndemographic variables), analysis of variance (ANOVA) or\nchi-square was computed. To determine significant predic-\ntors of wellness, a standard multiple regression analysis\nwas utilized. Effect sizes were also calculated where appro-\npriate, and the alpha level was set at .05. Due to the poor\npsychometric properties for the measure of spiritual well-\nness, these data were not included in the current analyses.\nResults\nFrom a demographics perspective, we found no signifi-\n=\n.23, between the two\nwere found. The liberal arts group had a greater number\nof male and minority participants than the research insti-\ntution group (see Table 1).\nTable 2 presents the means and standard deviations for\nthe study variables as a function of institution type.

Collectively, the effect sizes for the analyses\nsuggest a moderate effect.\nWe performed multiple regression analyses for the two\nwellness variables which were found to be significantly dif-\nferent between the two institutions. Both regression models\nhad significant predictive powers: physical well-being,\ndicting participants physical well-being (total score on\nhealth behavior scale), only self-esteem was a significant\nof the variance. In predicting participants social well-being,\nTable 2. Means and standard deviations for major variables as\na function of institution type.\nBaldwin et al. 5\nonly perceived stress was a significant predictor (=.160,\np=.042), and it also accounted for 12percent of the variance\nin need to belong.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we examined levels of holistic wellness\nbetween college students attending a research university\nand a small liberal arts college. Our results revealed few\ndifferences on measures of wellness; however, two signifi-\ncant differences did emerge from this cross-sectional\ndesign. First, students attending the small liberal arts col-\nlege self-reported being more physically activity and subse-\nquently, endorsed more overall health behaviors than their\nresearch university counterparts. It is plausible that these\ndifferences are due, in part, to gender effects. There were\nsignificantly more males in the liberal arts group, and the\noverrepresentation of females in the research group may\nhave contributed to these differences. Research shows that\nphysical activity levels are higher among men than women\n(e.g. Monin et al., 2015; National Center for Health\nexamined the association between physical activity and\npsychological well-being in college students. They found\nmen were more likely than were women to participate in\naerobic activity on a weekly basis. Indeed, when\nyou collapse across academic institutions, males reported a\nsignificantly higher level of physical activity in this study.\nFurthermore, we found no significant differences between\nthe groups (institutional type or gender) with regard to diet.\nThe above findings may also reflect a differential approach\nto stress management. Theory explaining gender-socialized\nbehaviors has long placed instrumental traits (e.g. assertive\nand independent) in the men's domain and expressive traits\n(e.g. dependence and care-focused) in the women's domain\nMen may show their assertive behavior through action such\nas increased physical activity. However, women may demon-\nstrate their expressive behavior through dependence on social\nrelationships and increased belonging needs.Although instru-\nmental and expressive trait behaviors are associated with ste-\nreotypical gender roles, some research suggests that men and\nwomen during emerging adulthood may utilize both traits\nwhen making decisions about health-related behaviors\n(Shifren et al., 2003). Young people identifying with the\nandrogynous trait category may report greater physical activ-\nity than those identifying with feminine traits. Additionally,\nSieverding et al. (2005) suggested that instrumental self-\nconcept may play a role in college students' response selec-\ntions to stressors. Activity choices about management of\nstress in the college population are likely to be biased toward\nthose traits most reinforced during early development.\nSecond, students attending the research university reported\na higher reliance upon social acceptance (need to belong)\ncompared with their liberal arts counterparts. According to\nBaumeister and Leary (1995), the need to belong is a funda-\nmental human motive that reflects an individual's subjective\nsense of connectedness with family, friends, and social mem-\nberships. More importantly, a high need to belong reflects a\nheightened motivation to be accepted by others and avoid\nbeing shunned. Again, it is plausible that this difference\nbetween the academic institutions is due, in part, to gender\nissues. In this study, the research group was overwhelmingly\nfemale. Indeed, when you collapse across institutional types,\nwomen endorsed a significantly higher need to belong than\nmen. Our finding is consistent with previous research regard-\ning gender difference with respect to belongingness or con-\nnectedness (e.g. Baumeister and Sommer, 1997; Good et al.,\nIt is also plausible that a large research institution provides\nmore opportunities for satisfying this fundamental need for\nacceptance and belonging. According to Tinto's (1987) aca-\ndemic and social integration model of college student attri-\ntion, the need to belong is an important non-cognitive variable\nthat is strongly related to academic success.\nTherefore, individuals with a heightened inclusion need\nmay be drawn to a research university as opposed to a\nsmaller liberal arts college. Indeed, further studies are war-\nranted to ferret out these findings. In this current investiga-\ntion, we found that students who were gainfully employed\nTable 3. Means and standard deviation for study variables as a\nfunction of job status (N=211).\nTable 4. Means and standard deviation for study variables as a\n6 Health Psychology Open \nreported greater self-efficacy and belongingness compared\nwith their unemployed counterparts. Our findings are not\nsurprising, and they are in line with previous research on\nthe benefits of employment on well-being (Boreham et al.,\nated with many positive benefits such as income, interper-\nsonal contact, opportunity for control, opportunity for skill\nuse, and valued social position, just to name a few. We also\nfound that employed students engaged in less physical\nactivity than their unemployed counterparts. Working,\nwhile attending college, is very demanding. Furthermore, it\nmay be difficult to squeeze in an exercise time or a healthy\nmeal under these time constraints. For college students,\ncommon barriers to exercise include other priorities,\nfatigue, no motivation, and lack of time (Ebben and\nstudents who reported higher levels of physical activity\nalso scored higher on measures of emotional intelligence\nand mental health. Clearly, our single-item measure does\nnot capture completely the construct of occupational well-\nness; further studies are warranted.\nFinally, this study found self-esteem to be the best pre-\ndictor of physical well-being, and perceived stress was the\nbest predictor of social well-being. Self-esteem refers to the\nvalue we place on aspects of our self. Research shows that\nphysical activity tends to positively influence our self-per-\nception and consequently our self-esteem (Ahmed et al.,\nSchmalz et al. (2007) found higher physical activity early in\nlife predicted higher self-esteem later in life in non-Hispanic\ngirls. Likewise, a sense of belonging is a fundamental need\nthat is often satisfied via friendships, social activities, and\nclose relationships (Baumeister and Leary, 1995). A stu-\ndent's sense of belonging is an important factor associated\nwith academic success (Freeman et al., 2007; Good et al.,\nment provides a myriad of opportunities for strengthening\nsocial ties and thereby satisfies this universal need to belong.\nIt is not surprising that college students with a strong need to\nbelong would seek out many of these membership opportu-\nnities (academic and/or social). Consequently, membership\nin too many organizations can lead to increased demands\nupon one's time and energy. This increase in workload, in\nthe absences of resources, can produce feelings of stress and\nFuture studies should examine the relationship between\nholistic wellness and membership in professional and social\norganizations among college students.\nLimitations\nDespite the relative strengths of this study, there are also\nlimitations to consider. Our sampling method was\nnonrandom and may not be representative of colleges and\nuniversities in other parts of the country. In addition, this\nstudy was cross-sectional which eliminates cause and effect\ninterpretations regarding the variables of interest. Moreover,\nour college student sample lacked diversity (e.g. ethnicity,\ngender, geographical region, and sexual minority). This\nprevented the inclusion of ethnicity and gender in inter-\ngroup analyses. For example, Spurgeon (2009) found Black\nmales attending a historically black colleges and university\n(HBCU) scored significantly higher on wellness dimen-\nsions of friendship, love, sense of control, and gender iden-\ntity compared to Black males attending the predominantly\nwhite institution (PWI). It is important that future studies\nrecruit larger samples of males and minorities to examine\ncritical differences in wellness components as a function of\nacademic institutions. Our study did not examine wellness\ndimensions in students attending a community college. The\ninclusion of a community college group would provide a\nmore complete examination of college student wellness.\nLikewise, employment status is an objective index of occu-\npational wellness. However, this single item does not cap-\nture the construct in its entirety. Future studies should\nincorporate broader measures of wellness (e.g. spirituality)\nand correlate these self-reported measures with actual\nobservable wellness behaviors.\nConclusion\nThe foundation for lifelong wellness is laid during the col-\nlege years in which young adults learn to balance academic,\nfinancial, social, and health-related demands indepen-\ndently. The degree to which an individual can balance suc-\ncessfully these life challenges is a direct reflection of their\nlevel of wellness. Our findings highlight aspects of well-\nness which are a source of concern for both types of aca-\ndemic institutions. Although liberal arts colleges and\nresearch universities provide their students with wellness\ninformation via a stand-alone wellness center, classroom\ninstructions, and/or website, the message may not be reach-\ning the intended audience.\n"
