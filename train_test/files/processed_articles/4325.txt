Fifty individuals completed a measure of attachment\nsecurity to parents and peers at age 14, measures of romantic attachment and emotion regulation at age 22, and a measure\nof psychopathology at age 24. Results revealed that attachment insecurity to parents in adolescence was associated with\ngreater symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood, and emotion-focused strategies partially mediated this association.\nAnxious romantic attachment was also related to psychopathology, an association that was fully mediated by emotion-\nfocused strategies. The long-term mechanism involved in the association between earlier attachment and future adaptation\nwill be discussed.\n",

Specifically, attachment insecu-\nrity in both adolescence and adulthood has been concurrently\nlinked to symptoms of psychopathology. However, few stud-\nies have examined longitudinal models linking these vari-\nables (Lee & Hankin, 2009), thus limiting our understanding\nof the developmental precursors to adult adaptation. This\nstudy thus tested the long-term influence of attachment inse-\ncurity toward parents and peers in adolescence and toward\nromantic partners in young adulthood on the development of\nadult psychopathology. Furthermore, although theoretical\nmodels indicate that associations between earlier attachment\nmodels and later adaptation lie in the specific emotion regu-\nlation strategies adopted by individuals to deal with distress\nGreenberg, 2008), this assumption has yet to be empirically\ntested. Accordingly, the main objective of this study was to\ninvestigate associations between attachment insecurity in\nadolescence and young adulthood and global symptoms of\npsychopathology in later adulthood. We further tested the\nrole of emotion regulation strategies as mediators of these\nlongitudinal associations.\nAttachment Theory: Childhood,\nAdolescence, and Young Adulthood\nAccording to attachment theory, internal working models\ndeveloped in response to the quality of repeated attachment-\nrelated parent\u00adchild interactions influence the child's expec-\ntations and beliefs about the self, others, and the environment\n1985). The classic work of Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar,\nWaters, & Wall, 1978) identified three attachment catego-\nries: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-ambivalent,\nbased on child separation\u00adreunion behavior with the primary\ncaregiver. Children who have experienced interactions with a\nsensitive caregiver who consistently responds to their attach-\nment needs are more likely to develop a secure attachment\nmodel consisting of self-representations of competency and\nperceptions of others as dependable and available in times of\n1Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nKatherine Pascuzzo, Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0\nMontr\u00e9al, C.P.8888, Succ.Centre-ville, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada H3C\nEmail: pascuzzo.katherine@uqam.ca\nAttachment and Emotion Regulation\nStrategies in Predicting Adult\nPsychopathology\nKatherine Pascuzzo1, Ellen Moss1,\nand Chantal Cyr1\n Keywords\nadolescent attachment, adult romantic attachment, emotion regulation strategies, psychopathology\n2 SAGE Open\nChildren with an insecure-avoidant attachment relation-\nship with their primary caregiver have learned that express-\ning distress or the need for proximity in stressful situations is\nlikely to evoke rejection from their caregiver. To protect\nthemselves from this possible rejection, avoidant children\ninhibit attachment-related behaviors, such as the expression\nof negative emotions and proximity seeking (Main &\nCassidy, 1988). Based on their experiences, avoidant chil-\ndren may view others as untrustworthy and develop positive\nbut unrealistic self-perceptions, with an excessive focus on\ntheir ability to overcome difficult situations on their own.\nInsecure-ambivalent children, however, have experienced\ninconsistent or unpredictable caregiving, leading them to\nworry about the availability of their attachment figure to\nrespond to their manifestations of distress. In response to their\ncaregiving experiences, ambivalent children learn to exagger-\nate and intensify distress signals to maintain parental proxim-\nity (Main & Cassidy, 1988). Accordingly, these children may\ndevelop self-perceptions as being helpless and unlovable,\nand view others as being unreliable.\nMain and Solomon (1990) later identified a fourth attach-\nment pattern, which they called insecure-disorganized.\nDisorganized child attachment is believed to develop in the\npresence of frightening or frightened parental behavior\n(Madigan, Moran, Schuengel, Otten, & Pederson, 2007).\nAccording to Main and Hesse (1990), disorganized children\nare caught at the heart of an important dilemma in which\ntheir source of comfort also represents their source of fear.\nConsequently, these children show confused and contradic-\ntory withdrawal and approach behaviors toward their attach-\nment figure when distressed. Children with disorganized\nattachment describe themselves the most negatively of all\nthe attachment groups, show the highest level of affect dys-\nregulation, and lack organized and coherent attachment strat-\negies for seeking parental proximity in times of distress\nSimilar systems exist for classifying adolescent attachment\nmodels, using both categorical and continuous dimensions of\nsecurity (see Main & Goldwyn, 1985, for details on the Adult\nAttachment Interview), while others rely solely on continuous\nscales of security (e.g., Armsden & Greenberg, 1987).\nAccordingly, a more secure adolescent is likely to be involved\nin a goal-corrected parent\u00adteen relationship, which allows for\nincreased independence from parents to attain normative age-\nappropriate social goals (e.g., development of social relation-\nships with peers, greater exploration of a larger environment,\netc.) while still maintaining contact with parents through open\nKobak & Duemmler, 1994). However, greater adolescent\nattachment insecurity toward parents, in general, is marked by\nfeelings of resentment and alienation, as well as emotional\nAlthough parents remain the adolescent's primary attach-\nment figure, close peers increasingly fulfill certain attachment\nneeds during this crucial developmental period (Allen, 2008;\nline with this idea, Zeifman and Hazan (2008), who investi-\ngated participants'(aged 6 to 17) preferred attachment figure\nrelating to the four components of attachment (i.e., proximity\nseeking, safe haven, separation distress, and secure base),\nreported that nearly all sample participants preferred spend-\ning time with peers over parents. Moreover, between the ages\nof 8 and 14, participants increasingly preferred receiving\ncomfort and emotional support from peers, although parents\nremained the primary sources of separation distress and\nbases of security. By late adolescence, the authors noted that\nromantic partners were identified as the overall preferred\nattachment figures. During late adolescence and early adult-\nhood, there is thus a subsequent restructuring of the attach-\nment hierarchy with romantic partners becoming the most\nsought-out attachment figures (Hazan & Shaver, 1987;\nAdult romantic attachment can be measured along two\northogonal dimensions, which assess feelings and thoughts\ntoward romantic partners in general, that is, avoidance of inti-\nmacy and anxiety over abandonment (Brennan, Clark, &\nShaver, 1998). Avoidantly attached individuals generally dis-\ntrust their romantic partners and are uncomfortable with inti-\nmacy, whereas anxiously attached individuals are preoccupied\nby thoughts of abandonment by their partners. Taken together,\nparents, peers, and romantic partners represent important\nattachment figures at specific phases of development.\nAttachment and Psychopathology\nIn addition to influencing one's perceptions of self and oth-\ners, internal working models of early attachment relation-\nships influence the individuals' resilience and vulnerability\nto stressful life events, consequently affecting their well-\nbeing and mental health (Bolwby, 1988). Insecure adult\nattachment models have been found to be associated with\nmore inflexible perceptions of self (Lopez, 1996), as well as\nmore negative and distorted views and expectations of others\n(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008). Based on these distorted cog-\nnitive models, individuals may perceive and experience dif-\nficult and stressful events in a more negative manner (e.g.,\nanger, hurt, disappointment, sadness, jealousy, helplessness),\npotentially exacerbating their experience of distress (Collins,\n1996). In line with this idea, attachment security during\nchildhood, adolescence, and young adulthood has been\nshown to be a protective factor against psychopathology and\nrelated symptoms such as anxiety, depression, dissociation,\nand antisocial behaviors (Davila, Ramsay, Stroud, &\nIn contrast, internalized representations of self and others\ndeveloped in response to insensitive caregiving are thought\nto increase the risk of developmental maladaptation across\nthe life span (DeKlyen & Greenberg, 2008; Moss, Bureau,\nSt-Laurent, & Tarabulsy, 2011). Therefore, although attach-\nment insecurity is not considered a disorder in and of itself, it\nPascuzzo et al. 3\nis viewed as an important risk factor for adult psychopathol-\nogy, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, dissocia-\ntion, and antisocial behaviors (Bolwby, 1988; Davila et al.,\nAdolescence is a particularly interesting developmental\nphase to study with respect to attachment insecurity and psy-\nchopathology given that, as previously stated, different\nattachment figures (i.e., parents and peers) play an active\nrole in the teen's life (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Zeifman\n& Hazan, 2008). Concurrent and prospective studies with\nadolescent samples have already linked attachment insecu-\nrity to higher instances of depression and behavior problems\nexample, Lee and Hankin (2009) found that both anxious\nand avoidant attachment orientations to parents and close\npeers in adolescence predicted prospective increases in\ndepressive and anxiety symptoms over a 5-month period.\nHowever, this study was limited in that it did not assess the\nindependent contribution of attachment security to parents\nand peers, but rather used a global attachment score. In two\nother studies that included independent parent and peer\nscores, both attachment relationships were found to be con-\ncurrently associated with psychopathology: General insecu-\nrity was associated with greater depression and anxiety\n(Muris, Meesters, van Melick, & Zwambag, 2001), whereas\nsecurity was related to greater overall adjustment (i.e.,\ngreater sympathy and lower aggression and depression;\nLaible et al., 2000) in adolescence. In these two studies, the\ncontribution of attachment to parents and to peers in relation\nto psychopathology was similar. However, in a study by\nWilkinson and Walford (2001), the authors found that only\nadolescent attachment security to parents, not to peers, was\nrelated to lower distress. Taken together, study findings are\nsomewhat inconsistent with respect to the distinct influence\nof attachment insecurity to parents and peers on the develop-\nment of symptoms of psychopathology. Moreover, given the\ncross-sectional nature of these studies, our understanding of\nthe longitudinal influence of these specific relationships on\nlater adult psychopathology is limited.\nAssociations between greater attachment insecurity in\nadulthood and general psychopathology have also been\ninvestigated, although findings differ across studies. Some\nstudies report that both the anxious and avoidant attachment\norientations are positively correlated with internalizing,\nexternalizing, and overall symptom severity (Fortuna &\nstronger associations with symptoms of psychopathology for\nthe anxious dimension than for the avoidant, particularly\nwhen internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression) are\nmeasured as outcomes (Brenning, Soenens, Braet, &\nBosmans, 2011; Lopez, Mauricio, Gormley, Simko, &\nIn summary, at both adolescence and adulthood, attach-\nment insecurity has been linked to various symptoms of\npsychopathology. However, no study to date has examined\nassociations across these two developmental periods.\nMoreover, there are inconsistencies in the adolescent litera-\nture concerning the relative influence of attachment to par-\nents versus peers and, in the adult literature, of anxious\nversus avoidant orientations on outcome measures. In addi-\ntion, most studies have focused on the association between\nattachment and symptoms of depression and anxiety (Lee\ndespite the fact that the assessment of global symptoms of\npsychopathology, versus specific disorders, may be particu-\nlarly appropriate when studying nonclinical populations.\nAttachment, Emotion Regulation\nStrategies, and Psychopathology\nAttachment theory provides a strong framework for under-\nstanding associations between the quality of primary caregiver\u00ad\nchild relationships and mental and psychological well-being\nover time. Within this framework, it would seem that emotion\nregulation strategies represent important contributors to this\nassociation. Specifically, based on attachment theory, the par-\nent\u00adchild relationship influences the development of emotion\nregulation strategies thought to be important for later adult\nAccording to Thompson (1994), \"Emotion regulation con-\nsists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for\nmonitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions,\nespecially their intensive and temporal features, to accom-\nplish one's goals\" (p. 28-29). Based on attachment theory,\nindividuals adopt specific emotion regulation strategies to\naccomplish their goal of dealing with distress that is in accor-\ndance with their internal working model of attachment\nor stressful situations, individuals will rely on these strategies\nto regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. For\nexample, individuals with an avoidant attachment are more\nlikely to use deactivating strategies to deal with stress-related\nsituations, which include denial of emotion-related thoughts\nand information, as well as suppression of emotional expres-\nsivity (Kobak, Cole, Ferenz-Gillies, Fleming, & Gamble,\nals adopt these strategies to maintain their attachment system\ndeactivated because activation of this system would cause\nthem to relive past or present experiences of distress in\nresponse to a distant and rejecting attachment figure\n(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007). Fear, anxiety, anger, sadness,\nshame, guilt, and distress are especially inhibited as they\nrelate to feelings of vulnerability, contradicting the avoidant\nindividual's self-perceptions of competency, superiority, and\nstrength (Hesse, 1999). Although denial of emotional states\nand inhibition of emotional expressivity are adaptive for\navoidant individuals in the short term, over time, they can\npotentially contribute to psychopathology, including anxiety\ndisorders (Zeijlmans van Emmichoven, van IJzendoorn, de\nRuiter, & Brosschot, 2003), eating disorders (Ward et al.,\n4 SAGE Open\n2001), and antisocial behaviors (Rosenstein & Horowitz,\n1996), given that negative emotions are not openly communi-\ncated and accurately evaluated but are rather suppressed\nHowever, anxiously attached individuals are more inclined\nto use hyperactivating strategies, which include exaggeration\nof threats, over-dependence on the attachment figure, and\nhypervigilance to cues of danger and abandonment, when\nfaced with stress-related situations (Mikulincer & Florian,\ntially negative cues and emotions causes these individuals to\nlink negative experiences together so that one negative\nthought leads to a string of others (Mikulincer & Shaver,\n2008). The anxiously attached individual is therefore caught\nin a vicious cycle whereby his or her attention to negative\ninformation leads to negative thoughts and ruminations,\nwhich in turn intensifies their feelings of anxiety, and thus\ntheir focus on potentially negative cues. Although the use of\nhyperactivating and emotion-focused strategies (e.g., self-\nblame, self-criticism, ruminations, focus on negative emo-\ntions, and feelings of helplessness) by anxiously attached\nindividuals is somewhat effective for maintaining the atten-\ntion of attachment figures, these strategies may serve to inten-\nsify negative feelings, such as anger, helplessness, and stress,\nwhich have been found to contribute to the development of\nsymptoms of psychopathology, including depression and\nanxiety disorders (Cantazaro & Wei, 2010; Hankin &\nGiven that insecure attachment models have been shown\nto be related to symptoms of psychopathology, and that these\nmodels promote the use of specific emotion regulation strate-\ngies associated with qualitative differences in attachment\nrelationships (e.g., avoidantly attached individuals avoid\nexpressing their emotions at all cost, while anxiously attached\nindividuals are intensively focused on their negative emo-\ntions), these strategies may be important mediating variables\nexplaining the association between earlier attachment insecu-\nrity and adult functioning (Carlson & Sroufe, 1995; Chaplin\nidea, problematic strategies such as emotional reactivity and\ndifficulties in identifying and communicating feelings (Lopez\nMallinckrodt, 2003) have already been identified as media-\ntors of the association between insecure attachment and psy-\nchopathology, particularly depression and anxiety. However,\nthese studies are limited in that samples were restricted to\nspecific populations (undergraduates) and relied on concur-\nrent data only. For example, using a sample of undergradu-\nates, Wei et al. (2003) found that the perceived ability to\novercome difficulties fully mediated the association between\nattachment anxiety and psychological distress (including anx-\niety and depression symptoms), whereas it only partially\nmediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and\ndistress. Similarly, Lopez et al. (2001) reported that ineffec-\ntive strategies (i.e., strong emotional responses, impulsivity,\nand distortions) partially mediated the positive association\nbetween anxious attachment and distress (combined depres-\nsion and anxiety), whereas avoidant attachment was not a pre-\ndictor of distress. Overall, reviewed studies, although\ncross-sectional, indicate that the association between attach-\nment insecurity and psychopathology is indirect and may be\nmediated by different emotion regulation strategies. Not only\nwill we attempt to replicate these concurrent mediation mod-\nels using longitudinal data, but we will also test these models\nusing diverse measures of attachment throughout develop-\nment (toward parents and peers in adolescence and toward\nromantic partners in young adulthood).\nThe Current Study\nDespite the evidence for concurrent associations between\ninsecure attachment and psychopathology at adolescence\nand young adulthood (Fortuna & Roisman, 2008; Lee &\nMuris et al., 2001), to our knowledge, no study has tested a\ndevelopmental model across these periods. In this study,\nattachment was evaluated at two different time points (Time\n1: 14 years of age, and Time 2: 22 years of age) and in rela-\ntion to three distinct attachment figures (Time 1: parents and\npeers; Time 2: romantic partners). Given that the sample was\nnonclinical, a global index of symptoms of psychopathology\nwas used as the outcome variable. The use of a normative\nrather than clinical sample is better suited for assessing the\npotential long-term associations between earlier attachment\nand later psychopathology as the presence of other potential\ninfluential variables, such as low family socio-economic sta-\ntus, parental psychopathology, and/or substance abuse in\nhigh-risk samples, can make it difficult to tease apart the\nunique influence of early insecurity on later functioning.\nThe first objective of this study was to test a longitudinal\nmodel evaluating the relative contribution of attachment\ninsecurity toward parents and peers during adolescence\n(Time 1), anxious and avoidant romantic attachment orienta-\ntions in young adulthood (Time 2), and emotion regulation\nstrategies in young adulthood (Time 2) to self-reported\nsymptoms of psychopathology in adulthood (Time 3). Based\non past empirical evidence (Lee & Hankin, 2009; Muris\net al., 2001), we expected greater insecurity at both Time 1\nand Time 2 to be associated with greater symptoms of psy-\nchopathology. In line with the findings of Wilkinson and\nWalford (2001), we also expected adolescent attachment to\nparents to be more strongly related to adult psychopathology\nthan adolescent attachment to peers. This hypothesis is also\nsupported by the theoretical assumption that internal work-\ning models are based more prominently on caregiving expe-\nriences with parents rather than peers (Bolwby, 1988).\nGiven that emotion regulation strategies have also been\nlinked to psychopathology (Lopez et al., 2001; Mallinckrodt\n& Wei, 2005), we expected attachment-related emotion regu-\nlation strategies, specifically emotion-focused strategies and\nPascuzzo et al. 5\nemotional expressivity, to be related to adult symptoms of\npsychopathology. More precisely, we predicted that greater\nuse of emotion-focused strategies (i.e., self-blame, rumina-\ntions, focus on negative emotions) and lower emotional\nexpressivity (i.e., tendency to outwardly display and com-\nmunicate emotions) would be related to greater symptoms of\npsychopathology.\nThe second study objective was to test mediation models\nin which attachment orientations (in adolescence and adult-\nhood) would be related to later adult psychopathology via the\nuse of emotion regulation strategies. Specifically, we\nexpected that greater insecurity to parents and peers would\nbe associated with greater symptoms of psychopathology in\nadulthood via the use of greater emotion-focused strategies\nand lower emotional expressivity. Based on the hyperactivat-\ning and deactivating strategies of the anxious and avoidant\nattachment models, respectively, we also expected romantic\nattachment in adulthood to be related to greater symptoms of\npsychopathology via the use of emotion-focused strategies\nfor the anxiously attached and via the use of lower emotional\nexpressivity for the avoidantly attached.\nMethod\nParticipants\nM age = 23.5, SD = .88) taking part in an ongoing longitudi-\nnal study of developmental adaptation as a function of the\nparent\u00adchild relationship (see Moss, Smolla, Cyr, Dubois-\nComtois, Mazzarello, & Berthiaume, 2006). Participants\nwere part of a larger community sample that had been ini-\ntially recruited through various daycares in diverse socio-\neconomic areas of Montreal, Canada. The original\nlongitudinal study began when children were 4 years of age.\nThe present study included data collected from adolescence,\nthat is, when participants were 14, 22, and 24 years of age,\nrespectively, referred to in this article as Time 1 (T1), Time 2\nSeventy percent of the participants'mothers obtained college-\nor university-level training, and 32% of the sample adoles-\ncents were living in a mother-headed single-parent family. At\nwomen), 50% of young adults reported earning less than\nreported earning $30,000 and above. Thirty-two percent of\nthe participants had completed a high school degree, and the\nrest had some college- or university-level training. Seventy-\nthree percent of the sample participants were still living with\ntheir families, whereas the rest where living on their own. At\nwomen), 22% of young adults reported earning less than\nreported earning $30,000 and above. Twenty-five percent of\nthe participants had completed a high school degree, and the\nrest had some college- or university-level training. Forty-two\npercent of the sample participants were still living with their\nfamilies of origin, whereas the rest were living on their own.\nAt T1, the sample included 79 participants. From T1 to\nrepeated contacts initiated by the project staff, 2 no longer\nhad valid phone numbers, 1 moved away, 4 refused to par-\nticipate, and 1 accepted participation but did not show up to\nthe laboratory visit. Out of the 66 participants who com-\npleted T2 measures, 10 participants had to be dropped from\nanalyses due to incomplete attachment and emotion regula-\ntion data sets (no differences on socio-demographic variables\nwere found between these 10 participants and the remaining\n56). From T2 to T3, six participants were lost to attrition\n(never responded to repeated contacts initiated by the project\nstaff).ANOVAs and chi-square analyses of socio-demographic\nvariables (age, gender, and family income) and main vari-\nables (adolescent attachment to parents and peers at T1 and\nadult attachment and emotion regulation strategies at Time\n2) comparing the final study sample of 50 participants with\nthe 29 who were lost to attrition or dropped from Time 1 to\nTime 3 revealed no significant differences. Moreover, addi-\ntional analysis (ANOVAs and chi-square) revealed no sig-\nnificant differences in age, gender, and family income at\ninitial assessment (when children were 4 years of age; n =\n186) between the 50 participants who remained in the longi-\ntudinal project and the 136 who were lost over 20 years.\nProcedure\nTime 1.An initial phone call informing participants of the\nadolescent phase of the longitudinal study was followed by a\nlaboratory visit for each adolescent during which the Inven-\ntory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA; Armsden &\nGreenberg, 1987) questionnaire was completed. Mothers of\nparticipants completed a socio-demographic questionnaire\nsent to them by mail.\nTime 2. Participants were contacted by phone and invited to\nthe first of two laboratory visits (approximately 1 month\napart), during which a socio-demographic questionnaire and\nthe Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR; Brennan et al.,\n1998) measure were completed. During the second laboratory\nvisit, participants completed the two emotion regulation mea-\nsures: the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS;\nEndler & Parker, 1994) and the Emotional Expressivity Scale\n(EES; Kring, Smith, & Neale, 1994). The emotion-focused\nsubscale of the CISS was chosen given its positive anticipated\noverlap with the hyperactivating strategy of anxiously\nattached individuals, while the EES was chosen for its nega-\ntive anticipated association with the deactivating strategy of\n6 SAGE Open\nthe avoidantly attached. Participants also completed a modi-\nfied version of the Life Event Questionnaire (Norbeck, 1984)\nto account for the presence of stressful life events throughout\ndevelopment.\nTime 3. Participants were contacted by phone and asked to\ncomplete questionnaires that would be sent to them by mail.\nThese included a socio-demographic questionnaire, the\nSymptom Checklist 90\u00adRevised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,\n1983), and a modified versions of the Life Event Question-\nnaire (Norbeck, 1984) to account for the presence of stressful\nlife events since the last laboratory assessment.\nMeasures\nInventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA).The IPPA\nquestionnaire evaluating adolescents' positive and negative\nperceptions of affective and cognitive dimensions of their\nrelationships with their parents and peers (e.g., my parents/\nmy friends accept me as I am; if my parents/friends know\nsomething is bothering me, they ask me about it). Partici-\npants rated each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 1\n(\"almost always true\") to 4 (\"almost never true\"). Ratings\nwere then summed, generating two global indices of attach-\nment insecurity: 1 for parents (12 items; alpha current study\n= .83) and the other for peers (12 items: alpha current study\n= .84). A high global score reflected a high level of attach-\nment insecurity. The IPPA has excellent psychometric quali-\nties (average internal consistency and test\u00adretest reliability\nscores: .90) and is widely used within adolescent attachment\nresearch (see Allen, Porter, McFarland, McElhaney, &\nExperiences in Close Relationships (ECR).The self-reported\nsure romantic attachment along two dimensions: avoidance\nof intimacy (18 items: alpha current study = .90; for exam-\nple, I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down) and\nanxiety over abandonment (18 items: alpha current study =\n.90; for example, I worry about being abandoned). Partici-\npants responded to each item using a 7-point scale from 1\n(\"strongly disagree\") to 7 (\"strongly agree\"), rating the\nextent to which each item is descriptive of how they usually\nfeel and behave in romantic relationships. Ratings were then\naveraged to compute scores for each dimension. High scores\nreflected more anxious and avoidant attachment orientations.\nThe ECR is well-validated and widely used within the adult\nattachment literature (for a review, see Mikulincer & Shaver,\nCoping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS).The CISS\n(Endler & Parker, 1994) is a 48-item self-administered ques-\ntionnaire, which assesses four strategies of coping styles:\ntask-focused, emotion-focused, distraction, and social diver-\nsion. For the present study, only data obtained for the\nemotion-focused scale (16 items: alpha current study = .87)\nwere included in the present study, as the others did not per-\ntain to our research questions. Specifically, emotion-focused\nregulation refers to strategies that monitor emotional distress\nin response to a stressful situation (e.g., I blame myself for\nnot knowing what to do; I focus on the insufficient resources\nat my disposal to deal with the problem; I get angry with\nmyself; I get angry with others). Respondents rated each\nitem on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (\"not at all\") to 5\n(\"very much\"). Ratings were then summed to compute a\ntotal score. A high score reflected greater use of the strategy.\nThe CISS has good internal consistency with alpha coeffi-\nthermore, this measure is widely used as a measure of\nemotion regulation (see Benoit, Bouthillier, Moss, Rousseau,\nEmotional Expressivity Scale (EES).The EES (Kring et al.,\nextent to which people outwardly display their emotions\n(alpha current study = .93). Respondents rated each item (e.g.,\nI display my emotions to other people; other people believe\nme to be very emotional) on a 6-point scale ranging from 1\n(\"strongly disagree\") to 6 (\"strongly agree\"). Ratings were\nthen summed to compute a total score. A high score reflected\ngreater emotional expressivity. Reliability studies (Kring\net al., 1994) show the EES to be internally consistent with an\nalpha coefficient of .91. Kring et al. reported a 4-week test\u00ad\nretest correlation of .90. As a result, the EES has been used in\nnumerous studies for assessing emotion regulation (see Ben-\noit et al., 2010; Niles, Haltom, Mulvenna, Lieberman, &\nThe Symptom Checklist 90\u00adRevised (SCL-90-R).The SCL-\n90-R (Derogatis, 1983) is a psychiatric self-report inventory.\nThe 90 items included in the questionnaire were scored on a\n5-point scale from 0 (\"not at all\") to 4 (\"extremely\"), indicat-\ning the rate of occurrence of the 90 symptoms in the last 7\ndays. Symptoms can be classified into nine dimensions\nincluding somatization, obsessive\u00adcompulsive, interpersonal\nsensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety,\nparanoid ideation, and psychoticism. The questionnaire also\ngenerates a global severity score, representing the average\nrating for the 90 items (alpha current study = .96). This\nglobal score was used in the analyses as an index of general\nexperience of symptoms of psychopathology (correlation\ncoefficients among SCL-90-R scales in the current study\nranging from .39 to .77). A high global score reflected more\nsymptoms of psychopathology. This scale is particularly use-\nful for nonclinical patients who may be less symptomatic of\nspecific disorders. Accordingly, the measure had been vali-\ndated with adult nonclinical patients (Derogatis, 1983),\nwhich represents the sample of the current article.\nPascuzzo et al. 7\nStressful life events.A modified version of the Life Event\nQuestionnaire (Norbeck, 1984) was created for the purpose\nof the current study (72 items at T2; 40 items at T3). Partici-\npants indicated whether or not they experienced the specified\nevent, in what year, whether it was a positive or negative\nexperience, and the amount of impact the event had on his or\nher life ranging from 0 (\"no effect\") to 3 (\"great effect\"). The\nfollowing events were retained for the purpose of the present\nstudy as these events can be expected to influence one's\nexperience of psychopathology: (a) sickness of a close\nfriend, family member, and/or of the self, (b) death of a close\nfriend or family member, (c) parental divorce or separation,\n(d) the experience of a break-up.\nSocio-demographic questionnaire.This 10-item questionnaire\nwas created by the research team to assess participants'\ndemographic information pertaining to the self and the fam-\nily (e.g., age, gender, income, education).\nResults\nPreliminary Analyses\nPreliminary correlation analyses performed to identify pos-\nsible covariates such as age, years of education, and income\nlevel in relation to the global psychopathology index revealed\nno significant associations (rs between -.20 and -.17). Given\npast findings showing consistent associations between gen-\nder and the prevalence of symptoms of psychopathology\n(Barlow, 2002), a t-test was conducted to assess differences\nbetween men and women on the global psychopathology\nindex. Results revealed no significant association between\ngender and psychopathology, t(48) = 1.24 n.s. Furthermore,\nto assess the possible influence of stressful life events on\nadult symptoms of psychopathology, a risk index was cre-\nated based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of stressful life\nevents as reported at T2 and T3 (events reported at T2 and T3\nwere summed). Correlation analyses revealed no significant\nassociations (r = .25, p = .08) between risk and psychopa-\nthology. Therefore, socio-economic variables, gender, and\nrisk were not controlled for in subsequent analyses.\nCorrelation analyses were then conducted between the\nindependent (adolescent and young adult attachment, and\nemotion regulation strategies) and dependent (global index\nof psychopathology) variables. Table 1 presents correlation\ncoefficients as well as means, standard deviations, and range\nfor study variables. Results show insecure adolescent\nattachment toward parents, anxious romantic attachment,\nand emotion-focused regulation strategies to be positively\nrelated to adult symptoms of psychopathology. Adolescent\nattachment to peers, avoidant attachment, and emotional\nexpressivity were not.\nAttachment and emotion regulation strategies as predictors of\nadult psychopathology.In line with our first hypothesis, we\ntested a complete longitudinal model to assess the long-term\nassociations between adolescent and young adult attach-\nment, emotion regulation strategies, and adult symptoms of\npsychopathology. A multiple regression analysis was there-\nfore performed with adolescent attachment to parents and\npeers, anxious and avoidant romantic attachment orienta-\ntions, emotion-focused regulation strategies, and emotional\nexpressivity as predictors of global index of psychopathol-\nogy. Results (see Table 2) revealed that adolescent attach-\nment to parents and emotion-focused regulation strategies in\nyoung adulthood made a significant unique contribution to\nthe prediction of adult psychopathology (explaining 19%\nand 14% of the variance, respectively), whereas adolescent\nattachment to peers, anxious and avoidant romantic attach-\nment, and emotional expressivity did not.\nAssociation between adolescent attachment to parents, emotion-\nfocused strategies, and adult psychopathology.

Results\nrevealed an indirect effect of .0080 and a bias-corrected\ndecrease in the effect of adolescent attachment to parents on\nadult psychopathology, through the use of emotion-focused\nstrategies. The use of emotion-focused strategies is therefore\nconsidered to be a partial mediator of the association between\nadolescent attachment to parents and adult symptoms of\npsychopathology.\nAssociation between young adult anxious attachment, emotion-\nfocused strategies, and adult psychopathology.Although anx-\nious romantic attachment was not identified as a significant\npredictor in the tested longitudinal model described above,\ncorrelational analyses did reveal anxious romantic attach-\nment to be positively linked to emotion-focused strategies\nand to symptoms of psychopathology. In line with our origi-\nnal hypothesis, we thus tested a model in which emotion-\nfocused regulation strategies mediated the association\nbetween anxious attachment orientation in young adulthood\nand adult psychopathology. According to Baron and Kenny's\n(1986) recommendations, all three conditions for testing\nsuch a model were met (see Figure 2): (a) The independent\nvariable (anxious attachment) was related to the dependent\nrelated to the mediator (emotion-focused strategies), Path a:\nmediator was related to the dependent variable, controlling\nA final hierarchical regression with adult symptoms of\npsychopathology as the dependent variable was thus con-\nducted with emotion-focused strategies entered in Step 1 and\nanxious attachment in Step 2.

The use of emo-\ntion-focused strategies is therefore a complete mediator of\nthe association between anxious attachment orientation in\nyoung adulthood and adult symptoms of psychopathology.\nDiscussion\nThe overall objective of the present study was to (a) test a\nlongitudinal model depicting the impact of attachment to\nparents and peers in adolescence and to romantic partners in\nyoung adulthood, on adult self-reported symptoms of psy-\nchopathology, and (b) test the theoretical assumption that\nspecific emotion regulation strategies, that is, emotion-\nfocused strategies and emotional expressivity, mediate asso-\nciations between attachment insecurity (in adolescence and\nyoung adulthood) and adult symptoms of psychopathology.\nIn doing so, our goal was to identify the mechanism through\nwhich earlier attachment relationships influenced the experi-\nence of adult symptoms of psychopathology. As expected,\nour results revealed that greater attachment insecurity toward\nparents in adolescence predicted greater symptoms of psy-\nchopathology in adulthood, 10 years later. Further analysis\nof this link revealed the partial mediating role of emotion-\nfocused strategies. In addition, emotion-focused strategies\nfully mediated the positive association between anxious\nattachment in young adulthood and adult psychopathology.\nThese findings and their implications are discussed in greater\ndetail in the following sections.\nAdolescent Attachment and Emotion-Focused\nStrategies as Predictors of Adult Symptoms of\nPsychopathology\nDespite evidence suggesting concurrent associations between\ninsecure attachment and psychopathology in adolescence\nTable 3.

Findings of this study therefore\nextend the existing concurrent literature by showing that\nattachment insecurity toward parents continues to be related\nto symptoms of psychopathology into the adult years. As\nexpected, emotion-focused regulation strategies were also\nrelated to adult symptoms of psychopathology. We interpret\nthese results as suggesting that, by resorting to emotion-\nfocused strategies, including self-blame, ruminative\nthoughts, and feelings of helplessness in dealing with dis-\ntress, negative emotions are not dealt with constructively.\nRather than thinking of the problem in a more benign manner\nand finding appropriate solutions, individuals who use\nemotion-focused strategies become enveloped in the stress-\nful situation, focused on the negative emotions associated\nwith it, and overcome with feelings of helplessness\n(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008). These strategies can thus serve\nto exacerbate one's experience of negative emotions, con-\ntributing to the experience of symptoms of psychopathology\nin adulthood. Therefore, in accordance with our findings,\nemotion-focused strategies play a crucial and direct role in\nthe presence of adult psychopathology.\nWe also found that, in addition to being related to adult\nsymptoms of psychopathology 2 years later, emotion-focused\nstrategies were also partial mediators of the association\nbetween insecure parent\u00adadolescent attachment and adult\nFigure 2.

Our results are in line with\nthose of previous studies showing that ineffective strategies\nmediate concurrent associations between insecure attach-\nment and psychological distress (Lopez et al., 2001;\nMallinckrodt & Wei, 2005). Nevertheless, emotion-focused\nstrategies were only partial mediators, such that insecure\nattachment to parents in adolescence remained associated to\nadult psychopathology 10 years later. We interpret our results\nas providing evidence that internal working models associ-\nated with insecure attachment relationships toward parents\npredispose the individual to experience symptoms of psy-\nchopathology in adulthood (Davila et al., 2005; Dozier et al.,\n2008). Despite the fact that other attachment figures, namely,\npeers and romantic partners, may fulfill important attach-\nment needs in later life (Allen, 2008), internal working mod-\nels are primarily constructed from attachment-related\nexperiences with parents in childhood and adolescence,\nwhen the individual is most vulnerable (Bowlby, 1982).\nThese representational models form the basis for expecta-\ntions and beliefs concerning the self and others as well as\nbasic self-regulatory processes, which contribute to later\nsymptoms of psychopathology (Bolwby, 1988; Main et al.,\n1985). During adolescence, in particular, when coping with\ndevelopmental challenges are an inherent part of the parent\u00ad\nteen relationship, the quality of dyadic interactions may rein-\nforce the teen's internal working model regarding his or her\nability to overcome difficult situations and the supportive-\nness and reliability of others (Dozier et al., 2008).\nAnxious Romantic Attachment, Emotion-Focused\nStrategies, and Adult Psychopathology\nSupported by results of past empirical studies, our initial find-\nings suggested that anxious romantic attachment in young\nadulthood was related to greater self-reported symptoms of\npsychopathology, 2 years later (Fortuna & Roisman, 2008;\nattached individuals are guided by negative working models\nof self and the world (Brennan et al., 1998; Collins & Read,\n1990), that is, beliefs of being unworthy of receiving love and\nconsistent support from their attachment figures. These indi-\nviduals also fear partner abandonment and experience intense\nnegative emotions in attachment-related contexts. Our results\ntherefore suggest that these self-deprecating models may con-\ntribute to the experience of symptoms of psychopathology in\nadulthood.\nHowever, our results further showed that anxious romantic\nattachment influenced the experience of symptoms of psy-\nchopathology via the use of emotion-focused strategies.\nAlthough we acknowledge that we did not control for earlier\npsychopathology, this study is nevertheless the first to dem-\nonstrate this indirect link using a 2-year delay, reinforcing the\nimportance of the proposed model. These results are also in\nline with findings from previous studies (Cooper, Shaver, &\nCollins, 1998), suggesting that anxiously attached individuals\nmay be caught in a vicious cycle whereby their negative\nviews of self, coupled with their fears of partner abandon-\nment, may lead them to be hypervigilant to negative cues and\nvulnerable to experiencing distress. To deal with these nega-\ntive feelings, anxiously attached individuals may resort to\nemotion-focused strategies that include ruminations, self-\nblame, and feelings of helplessness in overcoming difficult\ncan lead to greater feelings of distress and thus increases in\nself-reported symptoms of psychopathology over time.\nAdolescent Attachment to Peers and Avoidant\nAttachment in Adulthood\nIn our study, adolescent attachment insecurity toward peers\nwas unrelated to adult symptoms of psychopathology.\nAlthough this null finding may reflect a lack of power, it is\nconcordant with that of Wilkinson and Walford (2001), who\nalso failed to identify such an association using a concurrent\ndesign with a much larger sample (N = 404). This suggests\nthat the concurrent association between attachment insecu-\nrity toward peers and symptoms of psychopathology demon-\nstrated in a few studies (Laible et al., 2000; Lee & Hankin,\ntained over time. Unlike attachment relationships with par-\nents, which are enduring features of one's life (Allen, 2008),\nattachment relationships with peers are more fleeting, with\nthe formation of new friendships and the dissolution of oth-\ners. Whereas adolescents' friendships may contribute to alle-\nviating or exacerbating symptoms of psychopathology in\nadolescence, this association is unlikely to carry over into\nadulthood. Additional studies with larger samples are thus\nnecessary to provide support for the theoretical idea that the\nquality of attachment experiences with the most important\ncaregiving figures, usually parents, is most predictive of the\nindividual's internal working model and future adaptation\nIn line with the findings of Lopez et al. (2001), our results\nshowed no relation between avoidant romantic attachment\norientation in young adulthood and the global index of psy-\nchopathology. Past research has shown that avoidance is\nrelated to the development of symptoms of psychopathology\nonly under extreme conditions of stress (Berant, Mikulincer,\n& Florian, 2001; Ein-Dor, Doron, Solomon, Mikulincer, &\nShaver, 2010). Given our low-risk sample, the likelihood of\nour participants experiencing high levels of stress was lim-\nited, which may explain our nonsignificant findings. The\nlack of findings may also be attributed to under-reporting of\nsymptoms of psychopathology by avoidantly attached indi-\nviduals given their strategy of minimization of distress sig-\nsuggested that these individuals may not report distress on\nsimple measures with high face validity, as the one used in\nthe present study. The authors found that when multiple mea-\nsures of psychopathology were used, a positive association\nbetween avoidant attachment and psychological distress was\nmore likely to be detected. Future studies using multiple\nmeasures of psychopathology are thus needed to clarify our\nlack of a significant association.\nEmotional Expressivity and Symptoms of\nPsychopathology\nContrary to the expectation that a lack of emotional expres-\nsivity would be associated with greater symptoms of psycho-\npathology 2 years later, the tendency to express emotions\nwas unrelated to psychopathology in the present study.\nAgain, these null findings may be attributed to the rather lim-\nited sample size of the current study. In fact, past studies\nhave shown associations between lower emotional expres-\nsivity and greater prevalence of psychiatric disorders (i.e.,\nalcohol and drug dependence, and depression; Corcos &\nSperanza, 2003), and higher emotional expressivity and\nfewer symptoms of psychological distress (Vogel et al.,\n2008). Using the same EES as the one used in the present\nstudy, Vogel et al. (2008) found that greater emotional\nexpressivity was negatively associated with psychological\ndistress when assessed concurrently in a large sample of\nundergraduate students. The authors proposed that highly\ndistressed individuals may be less likely to openly express\ntheir emotions, given their expectation that communicating\nemotions may cause them to experience even greater unpleas-\nant feelings (Vogel et al., 2008). In light of the results from\nthe Vogel et al. study, and those of the present study, we sug-\ngest that, whereas emotional expressivity and psychopathol-\nogy may be concurrently related, the tendency to express\nemotions may not buffer against future experience of symp-\ntoms of psychopathology. However, we interpret this null\nfinding with caution given the restricted sample size of the\ncurrent study.\nStudy Limitations\nSeveral study limitations should be noted. First, owing to our\nlimited sample size, the present study may have been under-\npowered, and thus, all null findings should be interpreted\nwith caution. Moreover, we recognized the higher proportion\nof women in our sample such that study findings may be\nmore applicable to women than men. Further studies with\nlarger samples in which women and men are equally repre-\nsented are necessary to confirm study results. Second, ado-\nlescent attachment security to parents and peers was assessed\nalong a continuous dimension of insecurity, whereas adult\nattachment was assessed along the anxious and avoidant\ndimensions. Given this discrepancy, we were unable to\nassess the long-term association of anxious and avoidant\nattachment insecurity in adolescence and adulthood. A third\nlimitation of the present study is that all study variables were\nself-reported, which may have engendered under-reporting\nof symptoms by avoidantly attached individuals and\nover-reporting by anxiously attached individuals. Moreover,\nindividuals who endorsed emotion-focused regulation strate-\ngies may also have been more likely to over-report symp-\ntoms, given their focus on distress. Future studies should use\nvarious measures for assessing symptoms of psychopathol-\nogy to correct for this possible bias. Last, given that we could\nnot control for psychopathology symptoms in adolescence,\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that self-reported symp-\ntoms in adulthood were persisting symptoms from the ado-\nlescent period. Replication studies of current findings should\ninclude an earlier measure of psychopathology to address\nthis limitation. Nevertheless, our sample consisted of a nor-\nmative population, reducing the likelihood that our results\nare an artifact of severe and persistent psychopathology.\nConclusion\nIn summary, findings from this study extend the investiga-\ntion of adult adaptation by presenting new longitudinal asso-\nciations spanning a 10-year period, that is, between the ages\nof 14 and 24. Specifically, results highlight the association\nbetween an insecure attachment to parents in adolescence\nand greater symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood.\nThese results therefore make an important contribution to the\nexisting attachment literature in showing, from a develop-\nmental perspective, that adolescents' negative expectations\nand views within the context of an insecure relationship with\nparents are directly related to greater symptoms of psychopa-\nthology in adulthood, 10 years later. By identifying this\ndevelopmental model, our results suggest that adolescent\nattachment to parents and the use of emotion-focused strate-\ngies in young adulthood may be important mechanisms to\ntarget in reducing symptoms of psychopathology in adult-\nhood. For example, our findings directly support the theo-\nretical framework of Emotion-Focused Couples Therapy\n(EFT; Johnson, 2004). This attachment-based intervention\napproach aims at improving couples' negative interactions\nthrough changes in emotion regulation strategies. In a recent\narticle by Dalgleish et al. (2014), the authors found that more\nanxiously attached individuals showed greater improve-\nments in marital satisfaction following EFT. Accordingly, by\nproviding anxiously attached individuals with more adaptive\nstrategies for regulating their distress, these individuals are\nmore likely to show increased psychosocial functioning. The\nresults of the present article are also in line with the\nAttachment Based Family Therapy by Diamond, Siqueland,\nand Diamond (2003), which focuses on improving the qual-\nity of the parent\u00adadolescent attachment relationship for\ndepressed and suicidal adolescents. Taken together, based on\nour findings, prevention and intervention programs centered\non fostering more secure parent\u00adadolescent attachment rela-\ntionships as well as more adaptive emotion regulation strate-\ngies in adulthood are crucial for thwarting or improving the\nexperience of symptoms of psychopathology in the future.\nNonetheless, the replication of our findings with larger\nsamples using a pre/post-test experimental design is neces-\nsary to corroborate study conclusions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This work was\nsupported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council\nof Canada (research grant) and the Fonds Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de Recherche\nsur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la Culture (doctoral scholarship).\nReferences\nAinsworth, M.
