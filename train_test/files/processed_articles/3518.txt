    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the difference in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric\ndisorders and normal controls. After a detailed literature review, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant\ndifference in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric disorders and normal controls. The sample of the\npresent study consisted of 260 participants, who were further divided into two groups: clinical group (n = 140) and normal\ncontrols (n = 120). The age range of the participants in both the samples were 18 to 25 years (with the mean age of 22.14\nyears for psychiatric patients and 21.18 years for normal controls), and they belonged to middle socioeconomic status. The\nclinical group consisted of diagnosed psychiatric patients according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th\ned., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR) criteria and further divided into four subgroups, including patients of (a) schizophrenia (n = 40),\n(b) major depressive disorder (n = 40), (c) obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 40), and (d) opioid dependence disorder (n =\n20). The semi-structured interview form of Institute of Clinical Psychology, University of Karachi, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem\nScale were used. Descriptive Statistics and one-way ANOVA were applied to analyze and interpret the data in statistical\nterminology. Results indicate significant differences among patients with psychiatric disorders and normal controls on the\nvariable of self-esteem (F = 30.513, df = 4, 255, p< .05). The finding has implications for clinical interventions and also suggests\navenues for future research.\n",

People with\nhigh self-esteem regard themselves highly and are generally\npleased with who they are (Bordens & Horowitz, 2008). They\ntend to have positive, well-anchored, and secure feelings of\nself-worth and are satisfied with themselves (Kernis, 2000).\nThey are better at making new friends, at communicating\nabout themselves, at providing emotional support to others,\nand at resolving interpersonal conflicts (Buhrmester, Furman,\nWittenberg, & Reis, 1988). In contrast, feelings of failure,\nincompetence, and worthlessness are common characteristics\nof people with low self-esteem (Bordens & Horowitz, 2008).\nPeople with low self-esteem evaluate themselves negatively,\nwhich increases the proneness toward feelings of being weak,\nhelpless, hopeless, frightened, vulnerable, fragile, incom-\nplete, worthless, and inadequate. Consciously or uncon-\nsciously low self-esteem causes patients or others to hate and\nreject themselves, which may be expressed in direct or indi-\nThe past few decades have seen an increase in the research\non self-esteem deficits and their debilitating effects among\npsychiatric patients. Research on self-esteem deficit and its\nparalyzing effects among psychiatric populations has already\nprovided a great deal of insight into this phenomenon.\nAccording to O'Brien, Bartoletti, and Leitzel (2006), among\npatients with psychiatric disorders or mental illnesses, low\nself-esteem is either a diagnostic criterion or an associated\nfeature of nearly two dozen mental disorders in Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text\nrev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA],\n2000). Research evidence recognizes low self-esteem to\noccur in several psychiatric disorders, particularly major\ndepressive disorders, dysthymic disorder, anxiety disorders,\n1University of Lucerne, Switzerland\n2University of Karachi, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nMuhammad Rizwan, PhD, Department of Health Sciences & Health Policy,\nSwitzerland.\nEmail: muhammad.rizwan@unilu.ch, muhammad29psy@yahoo.com\nSelf-Esteem Deficits Among Psychiatric\nPatients\nMuhammad Rizwan1,2 and Riaz Ahmad2\n Keywords\nself-esteem, psychiatric patients, normal control, Karachi, Pakistan\n2 SAGE Open\neating disorders, sexual dysfunction, and personality disor-\nders (Leary & MacDonald, 2003), schizophrenia (Lysaker,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder (Fava, Savron, Rafanelli,\nopioid dependence disorder (Frances & Franklin, 1988) in\nyoung adults. This fundamental importance of self-esteem in\nthe course of various disorders is still inviting the attention of\nresearchers due to its significance and implications.\nThere is also a controversy that swirls around the rela-\ntive impact of self-esteem and psychiatric illnesses on each\nother. Some researchers argue that self-esteem deficit\nmakes individuals vulnerable to psychiatric illnesses (see\nKhanam, Rizwan, & Bilal, 2008), and some suggest that\npsychiatric illnesses lessen one's level of self-esteem (see\nSteinhausen, 2005), while others argue that there is a\nvicious cycle between low self-esteem and psychiatric ill-\nnesses (see Silverstone & Salsali, 2003). The present study\nis an effort to highlight the relative presence of self-esteem\ndeficits in psychiatric patients compared with normal con-\ntrols. This comparative analysis is not only limited to a spe-\ncific diagnostic classification and its controls; instead, it\nconsiders a number of diagnostic groups under this analy-\nsis, which adds to its significance and makes it distinctive\nto previous studies. The inclusion of multiple groups (i.e.,\nparticipants from patients of schizophrenia, major depres-\nsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and opioid\ndependence disorder) not only makes the study sample\nmore representative of the psychiatric population, but also\nmakes intergroup comparisons possible, which add to the\nstudy's credibility. On the basis of literature, it was hypoth-\nesized that there would be a significant difference in the\nlevel of self-esteem among patients with psychiatric disor-\nders and normal controls.\nMethod\nSample\nThe sample of this study consisted of 260 participants,\nincluding (a) clinical group, and (b) normal controls group\n(For demographics see Table 3 & 4). The clinical group con-\nsisted of 140 participants, who had been taking treatment for\ntheir mental health problems from outpatient clinics of dif-\nferent psychiatric and psychological settings within urban\nareas of Karachi, Pakistan. They were diagnosed psychiatric\npatients according to DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000) criteria,\nincluding patients of (a) schizophrenia (n = 40), (b) major\ndepressive disorder (n = 40), (c) obsessive-compulsive disor-\nder (n = 40), and (d) opioid dependence disorder (n = 20).\nThe participants of the opioid dependence disorder group\nwere comprised of males only because of the unavailability\nof females with opioid dependence disorder in outpatient\nclinical setups in Karachi.\nNormal controls consisted of 120 participants who them-\nselves or their first-degree relatives had never experienced\nany kind of psychological problem that demanded clinical\nattention or consultancy from mental health professionals.\nParticipants for the control group were drawn from different\ninstitutions and organizations in Karachi.\nThe ages of the participants in both samples ranged from\npatients and 21 years for normal controls (see Table 1 & 2).\nThe entire sample was drawn from the middle socioeco-\nnomic class, and the minimum education level was Middle\n(eighth grade).\nMeasures\nSemi-structured interview form. The semi-structured interview\nform is a qualitative tool designed by the Institute of Clinical\nPsychology (ICP), University of Karachi, to use in Out\npatient Department(OPD). It consisted of items focusing on\nan individual's demographic information, presenting prob-\nlems, history of problem, medical history, family history,\neducational history, social and occupational history, recre-\national activities, sexual history, mental state examination,\nextrasensory perceptions, belief system, affective state, anxi-\neties, gender identity problems, psychosomatic complaints,\naddiction problems, family psychopathology, personality\ntraits, motivation, and behavior during interview. It is not a\nstandardized measure, but a practice tool to get qualitative\ninformation from patients, and it usually takes 20 to 30 min-\nutes to be administered.\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).The RSES (Rosenberg,\n1965) is a 10-item scale that was originally designed to mea-\nsure global self-esteem. It uses the 4-point Likert-type\nresponse format: strongly agree, agree, disagree, and\nstrongly disagree. The scores can range from 0 to 30, with\nthe higher scores indicating a high level of self-esteem and\nlower scores indicating a low level of self-esteem. In the\npresent study, a translated version (in Urdu) of the RSES\n(Sardar, 1998) was used. Cronbach's alpha was found to be\n.71 for the clinical sample and .75 for the normal controls,\nwhich indicates adequate internal consistency of the Urdu\nResearch procedure.This research was conducted after\napproval of research review board in ICP, University of\nKarachi. The sample for the clinical group was recruited\nfrom different psychiatric departments and mental health\nclinics within urban areas of Karachi. A letter of consent\ndescribing the research project was provided to authorities\nof selected organizations. After getting permission from\nauthorities, the psychiatric patients were approached indi-\nvidually with the help of their respective psychiatrists and\npsychologists who had already been treating them. The\nRizwan and Ahmad 3\ninitial few minutes were spent putting the patients at ease,\nand then the purpose of the study was briefed and discussed\nin very general terms. The researcher assured the confiden-\ntiality of the participant's personal information and\nresponses. The formal consent was taken from patients\nthrough a consent form, and only those patients who gave\nconsent to participate were included in the sample. First,\nthe researcher conducted a detailed diagnostic interview\nand recorded all necessary information about each partici-\npant's illness on the Semi-Structured Interview Form,\nwhich was utilized to confirm the diagnosis made by the\nrespective psychiatrist/psychologist according to the diag-\nnostic criteria of DSM-IV-TR(APA, 2000). The participants'\nfinal diagnosis was determined by a consensus meeting\nbetween the researcher, respective psychiatrist/psycholo-\ngist, and an expert clinician's opinion.\nFinally, the RSES was administered to assess the psychi-\natric patients' level of self-esteem. Participants were allowed\nto ask questions if they had any difficulty in following\ninstructions and understanding the statements. At the end of\nthe administration of research measures, psychiatric patients\nand concerned authorities were thanked for their cooperation\nand time.\nThe sample for normal controls was drawn from different\ninstitutions and organizations in Karachi. The same proce-\ndure that was applied to the clinical group was followed for\nthe normal controls. They were individually interviewed to\nassess them as controls for the study (e.g., age, marital status,\neducation), and they were requested to respond on the RSES.\nDuring the process of study, the researcher adhered to four\nkey ethical principles: respect for the person's rights and dig-\nnity, responsibility, and integrity.\nStatistical analysis. After scoring, the research data were ana-\nlyzed to interpret them in statistical terminology. Data were\ninitially compiled into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and\nthen analyzed on Statistical Package for Social Sciences\n(SPSS, V-13.0) software. To test the hypotheses of the pres-\nent study, one-way ANOVA was computed.\nResults\nTable 4.

This post hoc Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) was\nconducted to analyze the difference of subgroups within the clinical group\nfrom the normal controls. All the psychiatric patients, that is, patients\nwith schizophrenia (MD = 3.983, p < .05), major depressive disorder\nto score significantly lower, indicating low self-esteem in all types of\npsychiatric patients, compared with normal controls.\nsignificantly lower, indicating low self-esteem in all types of\npsychiatric patients, compared with normal controls in this\nstudy.\nThe value we assign to ourselves is generally based on\nfive factors--two physical and three psychological. The\nphysical factors that determine our self-esteem are our\nappearance (the way we look) and our physical abilities. The\npsychological determinants of self-esteem are how well we\ndo (our perceived intelligence), how confident we are in\nsocial situations, and how we regard ourselves (Rice, 1987).\nHowever, Strickland (2001) described that psychologists\nwho write about self-esteem generally discuss it in terms of\ntwo key components: the feeling of being loved or lovable\nand accepted by others and a sense of competence and mas-\ntery in performing tasks and solving problems independently.\nIn psychiatric patients, generally both components (i.e., feel-\ning of being loved or lovable and accepted by others) are\nimpaired and manifest as deficiency of self-esteem. As Berk,\nMacneil, Castle, and Berk (2008) described, that insight into\nreality that one has a severe mental illness may be associated\nwith a fall in self-esteem and demoralization. He further\nextended that diagnosis by saying that denial may be a way\nof protecting oneself from the cognitive dissonance experi-\nenced when trying to integrate the idea of a stigmatized ill-\nness with one's usual self-concept. This might also be a\nreason for patients with psychiatric disorders to, when they\nbecome aware of their illness, spontaneously respond to their\nillness with denial; and that when they accept their illness,\nthey become prone to negatively evaluate themselves. As\nSanyal (2008) suggested, psychiatric patients can believe\nthat they are less smart than other people, and this can\nadversely affect their self-esteem and reinforce isolation. In\nthis way, people with psychiatric illnesses do not trust them-\nselves; they view themselves as awful people who are poor\nin all aspects of life compared with others. They not only\nperceive that they lack confidence in themselves and their\nability to control their lives but also that they are socially\ninapt. Thus, their psychiatric disorder limits their coping\nmechanisms, and impairs their problem-solving and deci-\nsion-making skills. Consequently, they disregard themselves,\nand their self-esteem is further lowered.\nAnother reason for the low level of self-esteem among\npsychiatric patients as compared with normal controls is the\nrole of stigmatization. Several researchers have put forward\nthat in psychiatric patients, the stigmatization of suffering\nfrom a severe psychiatric disorder creates typical self-\nesteem\u00addestructive ideas and low self-esteem (e.g., Berge &\nH. Stuart & Sartorius, 2005). Patients with psychiatric disor-\nders are not generally accepted in society as well as by their\nfamilies and are frequently criticized. They are usually\nlabeled as insane, mad, mental, psycho, useless, burden, and\nTable 5.

This table shows that the clinical group (patients of schizophrenia,\nmajor depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and opioid\ndependence disorder) scored significantly lower on the variable of self-\nDiscussion\nAs we hypothesized that \"there would be a significant differ-\nence in the level of self-esteem among patients with psychi-\natric disorders and normal controls,\" the results from a\nstatistical analysis of the data show that the clinical group\n(patients of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder, and opioid dependence disorder)\nscored significantly lower on the variable of self-esteem as\n.05;Table 5). These findings are consistent with the formu-\nlated hypothesis and validate the previous studies (e.g.,\nButler, Hokanson, & Flynn, 1994; Ehntholt, Salkovskis, &\nSilverstone & Salsali 2003) that have reported low levels of\nself-esteem in psychiatric patients compared with normal\ncontrols. Furthermore, post hoc Tukey's honest significant\ndifference (HSD) test was conducted to analyze the differ-\nence of subgroups within the clinical group from normal\ncontrols (Table 6). All the psychiatric patients, that is,\nRizwan and Ahmad 5\nso on, which leads to feelings of inadequacy, a general sense\nof worthlessness, and inferiority, which in turn contributes to\na low level of self-esteem. Link and Phelan (1999) illustrated\nthat the stigma of mental illness carries not only negative\nmoral connotations (e.g., \"lazy\") but also results in social\nmarginalization, isolation, withdrawal, a devalued sense of\nself, and lower self-esteem for those diagnosed with a mental\ndisorder. Lysaker, Tsai, Yanos, and Roe (2008) suggested\nthat the experience of greater levels of stigma was generally\nrelated to poorer self-esteem. This could be further explained\nthat the quality of feedback received by others significantly\naffects one's level of self-esteem, as Leary et al. (2003) pos-\nited. They noted that approval and disapproval from environ-\nment clearly affects self-esteem. Sullivan (1953) also put\nforward that self-esteem is shaped by individuals' appraisals\nof how they are perceived by significant others, and specifi-\ncally that negative feedback is detrimental to self-esteem.\nThus, culturally defined stigmas affect patients' self-esteem\nby developing in them a sense of segregation and discrimina-\ntion and inducing feelings of humility, worthlessness, and\nshame, which in turn may also adversely affect the course of\ntheir illness by causing further deterioration. The evidence\nobtained in this study points to the importance of self-esteem\nin planning the remedies and therapeutic interventions for\nthose experiencing mental illness challenges.\nThis study has certain limitations. First, the sample con-\nsisted of young adult patients with middle socioeconomic\nstatus who fall into only four diagnostic categories, including\nschizophrenia, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder, and opioid dependence disorder, so that a gen-\neralization of the results to the entire psychiatric population\nis not applicable. The second limitation is the use of the sub-\njective measure of Urdu self-esteem and an unstandardized\nsemi-structured interview form. In Pakistan, both of these\nforms have never been tested for their psychometric charac-\nteristics. Future research should therefore utilize a sample\nfrom varied age groups and different diagnostic groups and\nshould also focus on the biological, sociological, and psy-\nchological moderator or mediator mechanism underlying\nself-esteem changes following the onset of psychiatric\nillnesses.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
