Hagen3 and Peter Hammerstein4\n1Department of Anthropology, California State University, Sacramento, CA 95819, USA\n2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA\n4Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt University, 10115 Berlin, Germany\nNeurobiological models of drug abuse propose that drug use is initiated and maintained by rewarding\nfeedback mechanisms. However, the most commonly used drugs are plant neurotoxins that evolved to\npunish, not reward, consumption by animal herbivores. Reward models therefore implicitly assume an\nevolutionary mismatch between recent drug-profligate environments and a relatively drug-free past in\nwhich a reward centre, incidentally vulnerable to neurotoxins, could evolve. By contrast, emerging insights\nfrom plant evolutionary ecology and the genetics of hepatic enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450,\nindicate that animal and hominid taxa have been exposed to plant toxins throughout their evolution.\nSpecifically, evidence of conserved function, stabilizing selection, and population-specific selection of\nhuman cytochrome P450 genes indicate recent evolutionary exposure to plant toxins, including those that\naffect animal nervous systems. Thus, the human propensity to seek out and consume plant neurotoxins is a\nparadox with far-reaching implications for current drug-reward theory. We sketch some potential\nresolutions of the paradox, including the possibility that humans may have evolved to counter-exploit plant\nneurotoxins. Resolving the paradox of drug reward will require a synthesis of ecological and\nneurobiological perspectives of drug seeking and use.\nKeywords: reward; cytochrome P450; neurotoxins\nThe use of psychoactive substances is one of the most\nperplexing human behaviours. Some substances cause\nimmeasurable harm to individuals and societies (e.g.\nheroin) or impose a tremendous social burden in the form\nof preventable chronic illnesses (e.g. tobacco), while others\nappear to be mostly harmless and are widely enjoyed by\npeople around the world (e.g. coffee and chocolate).\nHistorically, a broad range of psychosocial, behavioural\nand neurobiological theories seeking to understand drug\nphenomena are unified by the notions of reward and\nreinforcement (Thorndike 1911). According to these\ntheories, recreational drugs reward and/or reinforce\nconsumption, often via hedonic effects (Wise & Rompre\nMost commonly used psychoactive drugs are plant\nsecondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids) or their close\nchemical analogues (table 1, see also further detail in\ntable 1, electronic supplementary material). Evolutionary\nbiologists studying plant\u00adherbivore interactions have con-\nvincingly argued that many plant secondary metabolites,\nincluding alkaloids such as nicotine, morphine and cocaine,\nare potent neurotoxins that evolved to deter consumption\nby herbivores (Karban & Baldwin 1997; Roberts & Wink\n1998).1 On the other hand, neurobiology's reward model\nsees interactions between drugs and the nervous system as\nrewarding and reinforcing. Hence, in their current forms,\nneurobiology's reward model and evolutionary biology's\npunishment model appear to be incompatible. We term this\nincompatibility the paradox of drug reward.\nSeveral theorists have attempted to explain drug reward\nfrom an evolutionary perspective emphasizing fitness\nconsequences (Tooby & Cosmides 1990; Nesse & Berridge\nNewlin 2002). In this view, behaviours beneficial to an\nanimal's reproductive success are rewarded and/or\nreinforced by positive emotions, while behaviours with\nfitness-impairing consequences are discouraged with\nnegative emotions. This perspective holds that drugs of\nabuse subvert natural reward circuits by creating a signal in\nthebrainfalselyindicatingthe arrivalof a hugefitnessbenefit\n(positive reinforcement), and by blocking painful feelings or\naffect states, `short circuiting' the adaptive functions of\nnegative emotions (Nesse & Berridge 1997).\nThis current evolutionary interpretation of brain\nfunction and reward could potentially resolve the paradox,\nbut carries with it several assumptions with which we\nintend to take issue. These are summarized below.\n(i) The widespread availability of drugs in the present is\nan evolutionary novelty, or mismatch; meaning that\nthe brain, and its putative reward centres, evolved in\nElectronic supplementary material is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.\n* Author and address for correspondence: Department of Anthro-\npology, California State University, Sacramento, CA 95819, USA\n(sullivar@csus.edu).\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use,\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nancestraldrug-freeenvironments(Tooby&Cosmides\ncontrary, we will argue that the evolutionary biological\nevidence strongly indicates that humans and other\nanimals have been exposed to drugs throughout their\nevolution,andwillbasethisargumentonananalysisof\nthe evolution of hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450)\nthat metabolize environmental chemicals.\n(ii) The brain and its reward centres are inherently\nvulnerable to drugs (Nesse & Berridge 1997). This\nidea follows from the `mismatch' assumption. If drug\nexposure is an evolutionary novelty, then it logically\nfollows that the brain does not have evolved defences\nto protect it from psychoactive substances. If such\nexposures were not novel then, as (Nesse & Berridge\n1997) point out, `Hundreds of generations of\nexposure would likely shape resistance to [drugs']\nallure and .deleterious effects.' We will use evidence\nfrom the genetics of drug metabolism to show that\nhumans have been exposed to plant neurotoxins\nthroughout their evolution, and to indicate that we are\nunlikely to be inherently vulnerable to drugs.\n(iii) Drugs of abuse are intrinsically rewarding and that\nsentientrewardscorrelatewithfitness consequences. To\nthe contrary, we will argue that commonly used\ndrugs are often experienced as affectively unpleasant\nby neophyte users (i.e. non-rewarding) and are\nidentified physiologically as toxic (non-rewarding)\nin the nervous system.\nAmong the points of contention described above, the\nkey question is that of `novelty' or mismatch--whether or\nnot our ancestors were exposed to psychoactive neuro-\ntoxins. Our rejection of the assumption that drugs are\nevolutionarily novel, we will argue, leaves the paradox of\ndrug reward unresolved. Although we see no obvious\nresolution to the paradox, we conclude by sketching some\npossibilities, including a consideration of the potential\nadaptive outcomes of an evolutionary exposure to plant\nneurotoxins in humans.\nPERSPECTIVE\nNeurobiological theory of drug use distinguishes between\ninitial seeking and use, and the longer term phenomena of\ndrug tolerance and addiction. Causal theories of both\n`stages' of drug use employ the concepts of reward or\nreinforcement: as motivation for drug seeking and in the\nacute effects of initial use, and in the maintenance of long-\nterm drug use and the neuroplastic changes that occur in\nresponse to chronic drug exposure. It is not surprising\nthen, that the motivations for neophyte drug use are often\nconflated by a failure to distinguish between the causes of\ninitial and long-term drug use (Wallace 2004). Our focus\nis on the most enigmatic phase of drug use--initial drug\nseeking and its acute effects, which we detail here, and not\non the distinct processes of dependence and addiction\n(for recent reviews of the neurobiology of addiction see\ntheories of addiction, see West (2001)). Note that neither\nstage of drug-use theory typically incorporates evolution-\nThe leading neurobiological model of acute drug\nreward and reinforcement is the mesolimbic dopamine\nsystem (MDS). In simplified terms, the MDS comprises\ndopaminergic neurons projecting from the ventral teg-\nmental area (VTA) in the midbrain to the nucleus\naccumbens (NAc) in the basal forebrain. The degree of\nactivity of the dopaminergic projections affects concen-\ntrations of extracellular dopamine in the NAc (Kelley &\nAn influential interpretation of dopamine function in\nthe MDS followed from the observation that dopamine\nreceptor blockade induced an `anhedonia' in rats, which\nwas not explained by sedation or motor side effects (Wise\net al. 1978). In other words, under what is sometimes\nreferred to as the hedonia hypothesis, dopamine mediates\nthe unconditioned pleasure produced by food, sex, etc., as\nwell as the conditioned pleasure produced by secondary\nreinforcers like drugs.\nThe discovery that dopamine neurons fail to respond\nwhen animals receive an anticipated reward contradicts the\nhedonia hypothesis, suggesting instead that the response\nof midbrain dopaminergic neurons might encode predic-\ntion errors--the difference between predicted and\nobtained rewards--rather than absolute reward. Under\nthis hypothesis, unpredicted rewards elicit activation of\nmidbrain dopaminergic neurons (positive prediction\nerror), fully predicted rewards elicit no response, and the\nomission of predicted rewards induces a depression\nThe incentive salience hypothesis (Robinson & Berridge\nrevision of the original hedonia hypothesis. This perspective\nstresses that manipulation of dopamine transmission has a\npowerful impact on motivation without changing hedonic\nreactions, and that `wanting' is neurologically, psychologi-\ncally and conceptually distinct from `liking'. In this view, the\nMDS mediates wanting and not liking (i.e. not hedonia).\nDespite diverse mechanisms of action and hetero-\ngeneous effects in the brain and periphery, initial and acute\nexposure to all drugs of abuse is thought to interfere with\nthe normal functions of the MDS by increasing dopamin-\nergic transmission in the NAc (Nestler 2005). For\nexample, stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine\ndirectly increase dopaminergic transmission in the NAc;\nopiates inhibit GABAergic interneurons in the VTA by\ndisinhibiting VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the\nNAc; and nicotine seems to activate VTA dopamine\nneurons both directly and indirectly via stimulation\nTable 1.

J. Sullivan et al.  . The paradox of drug reward\nof glutamatergic terminals innervating dopamine cells\nprecise effects of increased dopamine levels are not yet\nresolved, this drug-induced increase is widely believed to\nreward and/or reinforce drug use (Kelley & Berridge\nThe relationship between living plants and the animals\nthat feed on them is antagonistic, forged by an intense and\nongoing evolutionary arms race. In the evolution of life,\nautotrophs--plants, algae and some bacteria that syn-\nthesize organic compounds from inorganic sources of\ncarbon and energy--became the ultimate source of raw\nmaterials and energy for heterotrophs--the animals, fungi,\nprotists, bacteria and viruses that constitute the Earth's\nremaining biota.2\nPlants and other autotrophs have evolved an impressive\narray of chemical defences to deter heterotrophic pre-\ndators (insect and vertebrate herbivores, fungi and\nmicrobes; Wink 1998). All cellular organisms possess\ninternal signalling systems to regulate metabolism, growth\nand reproduction, which depend on small quantities of\nsimple molecules such as amines, peptides, steroids and\nlipids. Although such systems are efficient, they are\nvulnerable to manipulation by adversaries. As a key\nfacet of their chemical defence, many autotrophs have\ncoevolved compounds that are either identical to or\nclosely mimic these signalling molecules; thus enabling\nautotrophs to subject herbivores to disrupting chemical\nattacks. For example, one or more plant alkaloids have\nbeen identified that interfere with nearly every step in\nneural signalling. Targets include neurotransmitter\nsynthesis, storage, release, binding, deactivation and\nreuptake, ion channel activation and function, and key\nenzymes involved in signal transduction (Wink 2000).\nParadoxically, the same properties invoked to explain\nwhy common drugs like caffeine, nicotine and cocaine are\ntoxic are also those invoked to explain why these\ncompounds are rewarding. It is therefore important to\nstress that these and other addictive drugs appear to have\nevolved only because they successfully deterred, not\nrewarded or reinforced, plant consumption. Among\ndrugs of abuse, the data are particularly clear for nicotine,\nan alkaloid that binds to acetylcholine receptors. Nicotiana\nattenuata is an important model species for the analysis of\nplant\u00adherbivore interactions involving nicotine. It is a\ndomesticated North American tobacco plant that is\nattacked by over 20 different herbivores, ranging from\nmammalian browsers to intracellular-feeding insects\n(Baldwin 2001). These attacks elicit a battery of defensive\nresponses, including nicotine production.\nFor example, under natural conditions, Nicotiana with\ntransgenically downregulated nicotine production lost three-\nfold more leaf area to herbivores than did wild-type plants,\nsupporting a defensive function for nicotine (Steppuhn et al.\n2004). Nicotiana treated with jasmonic acid (JA) to boost\nconcentrations of nicotine and other defences had less leaf\nloss to mammalian browsers, lower mortality rate and\nproduced more viable seed than size-matched controls.\nThe insect herbivore, tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta)\nshowed dramatically lower survivorship and growth on\nJA-treated plants than on untreated controls. However, for\nplants not subject to herbivory, JA treatment reduced seed\nproduction by 26% relative to controls, demonstrating that\nchemical defences are expensive to produce. Nicotiana has\ntherefore evolved to allocate chemical defences strategically\nby concentrating them in the most valuable parts of the plant,\nsuch as young leaves, stems and reproductive organs, and\nby modulating its production according to the type of\nherbivore and extent of leaf damage (Baldwin 2001).\nHerbivores have coevolved a number ofcountermeasures\nin response to the evolution of autotroph chemical defences\nincluding: chemosensors that permit selective feeding on\nless toxic tissues, compounds that prevent or attenuate\ninduction of autotroph chemical defences, mechanisms that\nextract benefits from defensive chemicals (e.g. by metaboliz-\ning them or sequestering them to aid heterotrophic chemical\ndefence against predators), symbiotic relationships with\nmicrobes to detoxify or extract nutrients from plant\ndefences, cellular membranes for multidrug transport and,\nperhaps most commonly, enzymes that detoxify plant\nsecondary compounds (Karban & Agrawal 2002). We will\nreturn to the latter topic shortly.\nNeurobiologists have made a strong case that drug seeking\nand use is intimately related to neural circuitry involved in\nreward and/or reinforcement. However, evolutionary\nbiologists have made an equally strong case that plant\nneurotoxins evolved to punish, not reward, plant con-\nsumers, and that it is in the fitness interests of both plant\nand consumer that the consumer is averse to the plant's\ndefensive toxins. From the perspective of evolutionary\necology, plants should not have evolved defensive\nchemicals that easily trigger reward in consumers, and\nconsumers should not have evolved neural circuitry that\nreadily but inadvertently rewards or reinforces consump-\ntion of numerous neurotoxins.\nSeveral evolutionary theorists have argued that the\nMDS evolved to reinforce behaviours that successfully\nresulted in food acquisition, mating and other fitness-\nenhancing outcomes, and is maladaptively triggered by\nevolutionarily novel exposure to psychoactive plant toxins\n2002). If exposure to plant neurotoxins is evolutionarily\nnovel, then humans should exhibit little evidence of\nevolved countermeasures.\n(a) Detoxification enzymes: a coevolved counter-\nmeasure in humans and other animals\nHere we explore a key superfamily of detoxification\nenzymes to assess whether they support the hypothesis\nthat exposure to plant neurotoxins is evolutionarily novel\nfor humans. The principal heterotroph detoxification\nenzymes are the cytochrome P450 (CYP) haemoproteins.\nCYPs are ubiquitous in Bacteria and Eukarya, and have\nbeen found in many Archaea species, suggesting that the\nancestral CYP gene evolved approximately 3.5 Gyr ago.\nThe metabolism of endogenous fatty acids and steroido-\ngenesis appear to have been the original (and still central)\nfunctions of most CYP genes. With the rise of terrestrial\n . The paradox of drug reward R. J. Sullivan et al. 1233\nplants and animals approximately 400 Myr ago, the major\nfunctions of CYPs expanded to encompass the detoxifica-\ntion of dietary phytochemicals via a coevolutionary\nprocess involving dozens of gene duplication events\nCYP families known in animals, with 57 of these present\nAlthough CYPs are found in many tissues, in humans\nand other mammalsthey are concentrated in the liver, where\nthey catalyse the oxidation of a wide range of endogenous\nand exogenous chemicals in phase I metabolism. CYP\noxidases introduce an atom of molecular oxygen into the\nstructure of a lipophilic substrate (such as a toxin/drug) to\nrender it more hydrophilic prior to conjugation to a carrier\nmolecule in phase II metabolism for export from the body.\nIn mammals, CYPs are responsible for oxidizing over 90%\nof drugs and other xenobiotics (Lewis 2001).\nSeveral CYP families are highly conserved across\nspecies, whereas others are quite variable. The conserved\nCYP 5 and higher families have endogenous functions\nsuch as bile acid metabolism and cholesterol and steroid\nbiosynthesis, and show remarkable cross-species simi-\nlarity. For example, 21 out of the 22 human and mouse\ngenes in these families are orthologous (Nelson 1999).\nBy contrast, most of the drug-metabolizing enzymes\nare in the variable group (Nelson 1999). The CYP 2 and\nCYP 3 families, for example, are phylogenetically\ngenes, as opposed to 51 CYP 2 and 8 CYP 3 genes in mice\nhumans, whereas there are nine 2D genes in mice (Nelson\net al. 2004). A comparison of the human genome with the\ninitial sequence of the chimpanzee genome similarly found\nrapid evolutionary divergence in xenobiotic-metabolizing\ngenes (The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Con-\nsortium 2005), as well as divergence in genes expressed in\nthe liver (Khaitovich et al. 2005). The latter finding is\nsupported by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. For\ninstance, systemic clearance of propranolol, verapamil,\ntheophylline and 12 other synthetic drugs in chimpanzees\nand humans ranged from close to parity to a 10-fold\nvariation, with CYP2D enzyme activity approximately\n10 times higher in the chimpanzee, a species that notably\nsubsists primarily on plants (Wong 2004).\nThe emergence of xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP in\nanimals at about the same time as the evolution of\nterrestrial plants, the localization of cross-species variation\nin CYP genes within the xenobiotic-metabolizing subset,\nand the large species differences in drug metabolism\nsuggest species-specific adaptation to frequently encoun-\ntered plant toxins and other environmental chemicals.\n(b) Evolution in human xenobiotic-metabolizing\nThe mammalian cytochrome P450 phylogenetic data are\ncompelling evidence of a long evolutionary history of\nexposure to plant toxins. As mammals, humans have\nphylogenetically `inherited' the cytochrome P450 system\nfor detoxification of environmental chemicals. This fact\nalone would seem to falsify the hypothesis that human\nexposure to drugs is evolutionarily novel--that there has\nbeen a mismatch between contemporary drug-profligate\nand ancestral environments that were `drug' free. But\nhumans are taxonomically unique in several respects,\nparticularly in regard to the relative magnitude of culture\nand technology. A scenario that might preserve the\nmismatch hypothesis is that the evolving human nervous\nsystem was `protected' in a unique cultural or ecological\nniche that excluded plant neurotoxins. In this scenario, the\nphylogenetically inherited mammalian P450 adaptation\nwas superfluous until the proliferation of drugs in the\nmodern era. The Homo genus with its meat-rich diet and\ndetoxification technology (e.g. fire), probably had reduced\ntoxins in its diet relative to the chimpanzee (Ingelman-\nSundberg 2005). However, several lines of evidence\nindicate that our ancestors were regularly exposed to\nplant neurotoxins, and do not constitute a special case in\nmammalian evolution.\n(i) Conserved function\nPerhaps the most compelling argument that humans have\nexperienced relatively recent selection pressures from plant\ntoxins is that xenobiotic-metabolizing function is con-\nserved. Psychoactive plant toxins are substrates of CYP\nenzymes (table 2) with enzyme activity levels similar to\nthose for endogenous hormones and essential fatty acids\n(table 2 in the electronic supplementary material). If plant\ntoxins were not a recent selection pressure on humans, then\nloss of enzyme function through genetic drift would be\nexpected. For the majority of phenotypes, loss of function\nfrom drift does not appear to have occurred.\n(ii) Stabilizing selection\nxenobiotic-metabolizing CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3\nfamilies. DNA was sampled from 93 ethnically diverse\nhumans, including Caucasians, African-Americans and\nAsians. Although measures of genetic diversity indicated\nthese genes were comparatively rich in variation (mostly as\na consequence of low-frequency polymorphism), four\nindependent measures also indicated that these genes are\nunder selection against non-synonymous amino acid\nchanges in coding regions. Across all genes, for example,\nthe ratio of variation in non-synonymous versus synon-\nymous coding regions, pNS\n/pS\nstabilizing selection and thus a recent evolutionary history\nof exposure to xenobiotics such as plant toxins. For several\nCYP2E1, these ratios were particularly low (pNS\n/pSZ\n(iii) Population-specific selection\nMost polymorphisms in CYP genes are of low frequency,\nbut several are found with relatively high frequency in\ncertain populations. In some cases, high-frequency poly-\nmorphisms can be plausibly associated with the local plant\necology. Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, for example,\nhave very high frequencies of 2D6 ultrametabolizers:\nindividuals with multiple functional copies of 2D6 genes\n(Aynacioglu et al. 1999). This pattern suggests positive\nenzyme that metabolizes opiates and amphetamine-like\ncompounds, together with other substrates. Perhaps not\ncoincidentally, the opium poppy is native to the Turkish\nregion, and khat (a plant containing amphetamine-like\ncompounds) is native to North East Africa and is\nubiquitously chewed in Ethiopia and the Arabian Peninsula\n1234 R. J. Sullivan et al.  . The paradox of drug reward\n(iv) Reduced selection\nIn most cases, no compelling explanation exists for high-\nfrequency population-specific CYP polymorphisms. Some\nhigh-frequency polymorphisms produce low or non-\nfunctioning enzymes that suggest reduced or no selection\nby certain categories of xenobiotics. Such evidence could\nundermine the argument that humans have been under\nrecent selection by plant toxins; we address this potential\nobjection by investigating two CYP genes in detail.\nCYP2D6 is well studied and constitutes approximately\nCYP2A6 is less researched, but is important here as the\nprincipal metabolizing enzyme of nicotine. CYP2A6\nconstitutes 2\u00ad3% of total drug metabolism in humans\nCYP2A6 are representatives of current descriptive knowl-\nedge in human pharmacogenetics. The majority of 2D6\nand 2A6 alleles have low frequencies, consistent with\nstabilizing selection, but a few have high frequencies in\nsome populations. Table 3 lists several alleles for which\nin vivo enzyme activity has been measured (see also table 3\nin the electronic supplementary material).\nSome of the strongest evidence of reduced selection for,\nor selection against, a particular CYP enzyme occurs in\nAsian populations, among which the highest frequencies\nof non-functioning CYP2A6 alleles are observed. Assum-\ning Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium, the allele frequencies in\ntable 3 indicate that approximately 4% of Japanese are\nnon-metabolizers (\u00c34/\u00c34), and another 16% lack a normal\nNonetheless, individuals with the latter genotypes still\nmetabolize nicotine adequately, albeit at somewhat\nreduced levels. In one study of Koreans, for example,\nthe cotinine/nicotine ratio (an in vivo measure of enzyme\nup to 10% of some Caucasian populations and 19% of\nSouth African San are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers\nAlthough humans have probably been exposed to fewer\nplant toxins than our non-human ancestors (Ingelman-\nSundberg 2005), we believe that these population-level\npatterns of 2A6 and 2D6 enzyme activity more strongly\nsupport a hypothesis of relatively recent population-\nspecific selection by particular categories of xenobiotics,\nrather than a global near absence of exposure to plant\ntoxins across human evolution (Sullivan 2003). For\nexample, although Asians have high frequencies of non-\nfunctional 2A6 alleles, they also have low frequencies of\nnon-functional 2D6 alleles, a pattern that is more or less\nreversed in Caucasians (table 3). If Asians and Caucasians\nhad not been subjected to selection from xenobiotics, then\nboth populations should have high frequencies of non-\nfunctional alleles for both genes. Overall, 2D6 and 2A6\nadequately metabolize typical substrates in 90% of\nindividuals, albeit at variable rates.\nWe interpret the conserved function in human CYP\nenzymes, the statistical evidence of stabilizing selection\nand the existence of both species- and population-specific\npolymorphisms as evidence that humans have undergone\nrelatively recent selection by plant toxins frequently\nencountered in local environments. This hypothesis, if\ncorrect, has important implications for reward models of\ndrug seeking and acute drug use.\n(a) Are we inherently vulnerable to drugs?\nThe notion that we are inherently vulnerable to drugs is\nimplicit in neurobiological models of the mammalian\nMDS. The current assumption is that the MDS is easily\ntriggered by a broad range of neurotoxins because it was\nnot exposed to such toxins during its evolution (Nesse &\nBerridge 1997). The coevolution of the xenobiotic-\nmetabolizing CYP families contradicts this view by\ndemonstrating that heterotroph signalling systems have\nsuccessfully endured a relentless chemical assault by\nautotrophs for hundreds of millions of years.\nThe long exposure to plant neurotoxins indicated by\nthe CYP data make it unlikely that humans, or other\nmammals, are inherently vulnerable to drugs. This\nconclusion amounts to a rejection of the conventional\nevolutionary explanation of drug use, dependent as it is on\nthe notion that the MDS evolved in the absence of\nselection pressures from plant neurotoxins (Nesse &\nBerridge 1997) or, in broader theoretical terms, that the\nreward and/or reinforcement functions of the MDS were\nsomehow exempt from the implications of evolutionary\nbiology's punishment model.\nTo reiterate our broader argument here, the phylogenetic\nevidence for coevolution of animal CYP and plant toxins\nreinforces the evolutionary biological perspective that plant\nneurotoxins evolved because they punished and deterred\nconsumption by herbivores (Karban & Baldwin 1997;\nTable 2.

The paradox of drug reward R. J. Sullivan et al. 1235\nRoberts & Wink 1998), and is in direct conflict with\nneurobiology's reward model which sees drug use as\nrewarded and reinforced in the MDS. We termed this\nincompatibility the paradox of drug reward. Before sketching\npotential resolutions of the paradox of drug reward, we\nrespond to several objections to our argument that emerge\ndirectly from the substantial data generated in support of\ncurrent reward models like the MDS drug-reward pathway.\n(b) Does initial drug use elicit hedonic rewards\nand false-positive fitness signals?\nNesse & Berridge (1997) and others (Tooby & Cosmides\nNewlin 2002) propose that positive and negative affective\nexperiences and sensations are related to fitness con-\nsequences, and that drugs interfere with affectively\nmediated fitness signals. We find this perspective proble-\nmatic in several ways.\nFirst, commonly used drugs have multiple nervous\nsystem `targets' and may activate physiological responses\nthat are unpleasant or physiological systems that do not\nmediate affective experiences. For example, the widely used\ndrug arecoline (betel nut) not only binds to muscarinic\nreceptors in the brain, but also exerts potent effects in the\nperipheral nervous system (PNS) inducing tremor, face\nflushing, sweating, changes in heart rate and blood pressure,\nsalivation, nausea and broncoconstriction (Chu 1993,\n1995). The unpleasant consequences of PNS-binding sites\nare shared by all of the most commonly used plant drugs\n(e.g. tobacco, betel nut, khat, cola nut, coffee, tea, coca,\ncannabis). In regard to tobacco, Eissenberg & Balster\n(2000) demonstrated that neophyte users typically experi-\nence nausea and other aversive affects, not hedonic\nrewards. Most commonly used plant drugs are correctly\nand unsurprisingly `recognized' as toxins by most new users,\nboth physiologically and affectively, and the physical and\naffective responses are accurate warnings of fitness costs,\nrather than a false `positive' signal of a fitness benefit.\nSecond, modern euphoric drugs, like heroin, might\nrepresent a genuine evolutionary mismatch--drugs that are\nvastly more pleasurable than any neurotoxins occurring\nnaturally in ancestral environments (Nesse & Berridge\neuphoric drug use is trivial when compared with mundane\ndrugs such as tobacco, cannabis and betel nut. We\ncompiled data from the 2004 annual federal survey of\ndrug use in the USA, to show that regular users of heroin\nare an extremely small proportion of the population (0.2%)\nand even the numbers of regular users of cocaine, `crack'\nof the population, respectively) than the proportions of\ntobacco and cannabis users (34 and 11%, respectively,\n`used in the last year'; figure 1). These data suggest that the\nexception--use of euphoric drugs by very small proportions\nof human populations--has been used to prove the `rule' of\nhedonic drug reward. Stiff legal penalties might partially\nexplain the exceptionally low frequency of euphoric drug\nconsumption (DuPont & Voth 1995), but they obviously\ncannot explain the high frequency of non-euphoric drug\nconsumption. Euphoric drug use is a poor model for a\ngeneral theory of human, or mammalian, drug use. We\nsuggest that commonly used non-euphoric drugs should be\nthe basis for new models of human substance use that\nreflect major, rather than minor, population-use trends.\n(c) Potency\ncommonly useddrugs are more potentand are morelikely to\nbe encountered today than they were by our ancestors. We\nhave countered elsewhere that firstly, the most commonly\nused drugs in the ancestral past are the same drugs that are\nstill most commonly used today, e.g. tobacco, coffee, tea,\ncannabis, betel nut, khat, coca and cola nut (Sullivan &\nHagen 2002), and secondly, that the concentrations of\nalkaloids like nicotine in the wild (or partially domesticated)\nspecies encountered by our ancestors is generally higher\nthan in the domesticated species currently used in the\nmanufacture of commercial brands (Watson 1983).\nThe issues surrounding domestication and potency are\ncomplex and contradictory: domestication of edible plants\nhas employed detoxifying cultural technologies to make\nfood safer and more palatable (Johns 1990), whereas\nplants used as drugs appear to have been artificially\nselected for potency, rather than detoxification (Sullivan &\nHagen 2002). Although issues of domestication require\nfurther research, there is little evidence that the transitions\nTable 3.

The paradox of drug reward\nto horticulture and agriculture provided an evolutionary\n`window' free from human exposure to plant neurotoxins.\n(d) Routes of delivery\nIt has been argued that the mismatch might not be in the\nnature of the drugs, but in their method of delivery, e.g. via\nhypodermic needle to bypass first-pass metabolism (Nesse\n2002). However, many drug-containing plants are simply\nchewed or smoked, and pre-industrial and prehistoric\nsocieties often used drug delivery methods, such as free-\nbasing techniques in combination with the buccal\u00adoral\nroute that ensured that these drugs were pure (i.e.\nchemically unbound) and bypassed first-pass metabolism\n(Sullivan & Hagen 2002). Given the simplicity of these\nmethods, it is entirely plausible that they have been used as\nlong as there have been cognitively modern people, that is,\n(e) Animal data of drug reward\nSome of the strongest data supporting drug reinforcement\nmodels have emerged from decades of research using\nlaboratory animals (Liebman & Cooper 1989). Taking\nthese results at face value, however, does not invalidate our\ncritique. The xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP1, CYP2 and\nCYP3 families are well represented in all mammals for\nwhich data are available, including mice, rats, rabbits and\nprimates, and the evidence for coevolution of neurotoxins\nand mammalian CYP shows that exposure to high\nconcentrations of plant alkaloids is no more an evolution-\nary novelty for rats or rabbits than it is for humans\n(Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium 2004).\nHence, drug reward is as much as a paradox for laboratory\nanimals as it is for humans.\nThis insight suggests that we should pay particular\nattention to animal learning research that has incorporated\nevolutionarily and ecologically plausible experimental\nconditions. For example, the classic studiesbyPetrinovich &\nmurine experimental outcomes that contradict conven-\ntional classical and instrumental conditioning theory are\nexplicable only when interpreted from an evolutionary\nperspective. Garcia & Ervin (1968) showed that rats will\navoid novel foods paired with an aversive association after a\nsingle trial, but only if the aversive experience is nausea.\nPetrinovich & Bolles (1954) demonstrated that rats find it\neasier to learn relationships that are consistent with their\nnatural ecology, and will make such associations indepen-\ndently of experimentally induced motivational states such as\nhunger and thirst. Garcia & Ervin's insights may be\nparticularly relevant to our argument in that plant toxins\nmay have provided the phylogenetic basis for the con-\nditioned taste aversions observed in rats. A third example is\nthe work of Green et al. (2002) showing that rats in\n`enriched' environments (i.e. those that are relatively less\nartificial) are less inclined to lever press for drug rewards.\nThe common element in all of these studies, experimental\nconditions that are ecologically `normal' to the laboratory\nanimal, is missing from other studies that have been hugely\ninfluential on the theory of drug reward such as Olds &\nMilner's classic research of electrical brain stimulation in\nEvolutionary rationales that can accommodate current\ndrug-reward models might include that the most com-\nmonly used plant drugs today have exploited human\npleasurable `tastes' to encourage domestication, much in\nthe way that sweet tasting fruits and nectar promote seed\nand pollen dispersal by animals (Nesse 2002). Tobacco\nstands as a counter-example to this hypothosis. Nicotine\nevolved before humans, is toxic for tobacco herbivores, is\ninduced in tobacco plants when subject to herbivory, and\nhas no known function for seed dispersal by non-human\nspecies. Thus, it is unlikely that it evolved to exploit\npleasurable tastes of humans or other animals.\ntobacco cannabis cocaine crack heroin hallucinogens meth\npercentage of US population (12 years or older)\nFigure 1. Data from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2004: drug use in the last year.\n . The paradox of drug reward R. J. Sullivan et al. 1237\nEven if psychoactive plant toxins are not an evolutionary\nnovelty, it is possible that a few toxins incidentally activate\nreward circuitry (Nesse 2002). As discussed previously,\nhowever, responses to first use of tobacco and other\nrecreational drugs are usually aversive with nausea and\nvomiting as a commonly occurring outcome (Eissenberg &\nterms, most drugs are recognized as toxins, suggesting that\nthe paradox of drug reward might be usefully informed by a\ngreater understanding of why aversion mechanisms and\naversive learning do not overcome drug reward and\nreinforcement (Hagen et al. in preparation).\nNot all neurobiological theories of drug use invoke\nevolvedneuralsignallingpathways.Theoriesofchronicdrug\nuse emphasize neuroplastic `adaptations' to chronic\ndrug exposure and addiction, and focus less on hedonic\nfeedback circuits that motivate initial drug seeking\nand responses to acute drug exposure (Kalivas 2005;\nShaham & Hope 2005). Such models, as non-evolutionary\nexplanations for habituated drug use, do not necessarily\nconflict with the evidence of plant\u00adanimal coevolution.\n(a) Questioning a unitary reward model\nThere is a near consensus that all recreational drugs increase\ndopaminergic transmission in the NAc, however, when\ncompared with opiates, the mechanisms by which they do\nso are `more conjectural' (Nestler 2005). For instance,\nmesolimbic and neostriatal dopamine projections are\ncrucial to sensorimotor function, which, in turn, means\nthat sensorimotor responses to dopamine manipulation\ncomplicate a clear understanding of dopamine's role in\nreward (Berridge & Robinson 1998). Furthermore, on the\nbasis of observations that do not easily fit prevailing reward\nand reinforcement models of the MDS, several researchers\nhave suggested that the MDS involves broader functions\nsuch as attention, complex sensorimotor integration, effort\nor behavioural programme switching (see, e.g. Horvitz\nexplained by effects other than, or in addition to, reward and\nreinforcement. A unitary reward model for all drugs of\nabuse, in other words, is not yet established.\nAlthough the unitary account of drug use provided by\nthe MDS model is elegant, we believe that it would also be\nbeneficial to explore drug-specific mechanisms. It is\ncommonly recognized that different drugs have profoundly\ndifferent and wide-ranging effects on the CNS and PNS,\nand it is likely that the explanation for opiate use could differ\nin fundamental ways from the explanation for tobacco use.\nFor example, it is relatively easier to induce the self-\nadministration of opiates than nicotine in laboratory\nanimals (Le Foll & Goldberg 2006). It is important to\nkeep in mind that the opium poppy evolved morphine to\nreplace endogenous endorphins at m-opioid receptors, and\nthat the tobacco plant evolved nicotine to replace\nendogenous acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors, in the\nCNS and PNS (table 1), not to activate the MDS\n`downstream'. If we were to consider each toxin/receptor\nrelationship as a distinct ecological phenomenon with, firstly,\nits own neurochemistry reflecting plant-defence strategies\nand, secondly, potential consumer counter-strategies, we\nmay find that multiple drug pathway models can account\nfor neurobiological and behavioural data of acute drug\nstates better than the current comprehensive models.\n(b) Ecological approaches to drug use\nThus far, we can summarize certain common elements\nthat should be present in ecological and/or evolutionary\napproaches to research of substance use as follows.\n(i) Making a distinction between the causes of\nneophyte use and the physiological and behavioural\nprocesses associated with chronic drug use.\n(ii) Using information about natural patterns of\nseeking and use. For example, what are the\necologically salient factors affecting initial use\npatterns in humans and animals?\n(iii) Using independent variables that are ecologically\nmeaningful, or plausible, to the experimental\nsubject; that is, which reflect a plausible aspect of\nthe animal's natural ecology and evolutionary\nhistory. For example, the key elements of Garcia &\nErvin's (1968) classic study--food paired with\nnausea--are `ecologically plausible' to the rat; by\ncontrast, the electrical brain stimulation used in\nOlds & Milner's famous study (1954) has no natural\nparallel in the ecology or phylogeny of the rat.\n(iv) Focusingon theprimaryneurobiologicaltargetofthe\nneurotoxin rather thandownstreaminteractionswith\ndopamine and/or the NAc. For example, the\nneurotoxin nicotine has evolved to bind with\ncholinergic receptors, not dopaminergic receptors;\nwhat are the primary physiological (and behavioural)\ncorrelates of cholinergic receptor binding, and how\ndo they relate to 1, 2 and 3 above?\n(v) Considering the possibility of coevolutionary pro-\ncesses. Animals that are ecologically exposed to plant\nneurotoxins often evolve strategies and adaptations\nto counter-exploit the neurotoxin.\nIn regard to the latter, the broad patterns of human drug-\nseeking behaviour (see the macro trends in the US National\nSurvey data; figure 1) may reflect active substance seeking\nmediated by presently unknown toxin-exploiting\nmechanisms, similar to those found in numerous other\nspecies (Karban & Agrawal 2002), rather than an inherent\nvulnerability to drugs. For example, Bentz & Barbosa\n(1990) demonstrated that the food use efficiency of\nunparasitized tobacco hornworm larvae was significantly\nreduced by ingestion of nicotine. However, larvae that\nconsumed food containing nicotine were themselves\nprotected from parasitism by the wasp Cotesia congregata.\nParasitized larvae that consumed a nicotine-laced diet had\nsignificantly greater efficiency in conversion of ingested and\ndigested food than parasitized larvae without dietary\nnicotine, presumably because nicotine was worse for the\nparasitic wasps than it was for the hornworm larvae (an\nexample of what ecologists call pharmacophagy). Note that\nthe benefit of nicotine exposure exceeded the cost only\nwhen the hornworm was itself parasitized. This example\ndemonstrates both the cost of toxin consumption to\nco-adapted species (tobacco hornworm/Nicotiana) and\nhow a targeted plant predator may counter-exploit the\ntoxins deployed against it.\nIn this light, it has been proposed that toxins in fava\nbeans and cassava might be effective against Plasmodium\nthe ubiquitous use of spices could be an adaptation to\nexploit plant alkaloids to combat bacterial infections of\n1238 R. J. Sullivan et al.  . The paradox of drug reward\nfood (Billing & Sherman 1998), and that the evidence that\nprimates and other animals use the toxic properties of plants\nto self-medicate, especially against gastrointestinal\nparasites, may provide an evolutionary basis for human\nWe have hypothesized elsewhere that hominins may have\nexploited plant toxins to overcome nutritional and energetic\nconstraints on CNS signalling (Sullivan & Hagen 2002).\nHere we note that some recreational drugs attack human\npathogens. For example, of the world's three most popular\nalkaloid drugs--caffeine (coffee), nicotine (tobacco) and\narecoline (betel nut)--two, in the form of nicotine sulphate\nand arecoline hydrobromide, are potent commercial\nanthelmintics used in animals (Eckert et al. 1981;\nHammond et al. 1997). Dried tobacco leaves, stalks and\nthe whole herb are still employed by farmers in parts of the\ndeveloping world to treat helminth infections in livestock,\nand it has been shown that an aqueous extract of nicotine\nfrom tobacco leaves is quite effective against helminth\ninfections in cattle and sheep (Msolla et al. 1987; Iqbal et al.\n2006). Like nicotine, modern anthelmintics such as\nlevamisole and tetrahydropyrimidines target nicotinic\nacetylcholine receptors on somatic muscle cells, inducing\nspastic paralysis and parasite expulsion (Kohler 2001).\nNicotinic receptors are also targeted by recently developed\n`neonicotinoid' agents effective against fleas, ticks and other\narthropod parasites (Tomizawa & Casida 2005).\nAlthough we are not aware of any quantitative studies,\norally ingested nicotine and arecoline are seen as\nefficacious anthelmintics in humans (Fabricant &\nFarnsworth 2001). Thus, the widespread recreational\nuse of plants producing nicotine and arecoline could be an\nevolved response to chronic infections of parasites (with\nnicotinic or muscarinic receptors) in ancestral human\npopulations. However, we doubt that selection occurred\nfor use of nicotine or arecoline specifically; it appears more\nlikely that there could have been selection to seek out and\nuse cholinergic agents of various types.3 According to this\nhypothesis, any pleasure or satisfaction from nicotine and\narecoline use stems not from incidental activation of a\ngeneral reward mechanism, but rather from an evolved\npropensity for `human pharmacophagy' using these or\nrelated cholinergic compounds. As in the case of\npharmacophagy by the parasitized tobacco hornworm,\nour ancestors may have initially exploited plant neurotox-\nins because, although they are `bad' (toxic) for humans,\nthey are even worse for some human pathogens.\nCurrently, any potential benefits from the antihelmen-\ntic properties of nicotine are outweighed by the consider-\nable health costs of tobacco consumption in long-lived,\nresource-rich Western populations with low parasite loads.\nIn the shorter-lived, nutritionally stressed populations\nwith higher parasite loads, such as those in which our\nancestors evolved, the antihelmentic properties of cholin-\nergic plant toxins may have constituted a significant\nadaptive opportunity. These hypotheses are testable\nusing both descriptive and experimental methods in\nanimals and humans. Animal research could observe a\npropensity for consuming cholinergic substances after\nexperimental infection with helminths. In humans,\nobservational research could describe associations\nbetween consumption of cholinergic substances and\nrates of helminth infections in natural populations.\nExperimental studies could measure the effects of\ncholinergic interventions on experimentally induced\n(benign) helminth infections or, conversely, the effects of\nmanipulations of existing infection (e.g. by treatment with\ncommercial anthelmintics) on existing cholinergic sub-\nstance use (e.g. tobacco use).\nThis paper has sought to illuminate the paradox between\nevolutionary biology's punishment model and neurobiol-\nogy's reward model. Existing models of drug reward have\neffectively bypassed the paradox by ignoring the evolved\nfunction of plant drugs and the probable coevolution of\nplant defensive compounds and herbivore nervous\nsystems. We have critiqued major assumptions underlying\nthe current evolutionary justification of reward models,\nthat: drugs are an evolutionary novelty; humans (and\nmammals) are inherently vulnerable; and hedonic reward\nbest characterizes the psychological and physiological\nresponses to drug exposure. Our review has identified\nseveral elements of research design that we believe would\nconstitute evolutionarily/ecologically plausible research of\nsubstance use, including considering the possibility of\ncounter-exploitation of plant toxins in human evolution.\nWe have also provided an initial hypothesis that human\nsubstance seeking may have evolved to exploit the anti-\nparasitic properties of commonly used plant toxins, but\nthere are, of course, other possibilities.\nIn our opinion, resolving the paradox of human drug\nuse will require new neurobiological models, or new\ninterpretations of neurobiological reward theory, that are\nconsistent with insights from evolutionary ecology. More\ngenerally, we urge neurobiologists studying drug use, and\nevolutionary biologists studying plant\u00adherbivore\ninteractions, to expand their research agenda to incorpor-\nate findings and insights from one another.\nWe thank Don Symons, Marta Di Domizio, Nicole Hess and\nmembers of the ITB for numerous helpful comments and\nsuggestions.
