    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is among the most common sexually transmitted pathogens in the United States\nand worldwide. HSV has a high incidence of undetected cases. In addition, there is no treatment, and there is a lack of\nknowledge why disparities among populations exist. Research studies suggest that fat tissue may participate in body's\nimmune responses, and the impact of obesity on susceptibility to HSV1 infection is not clear. The purpose of this study was\nto examine whether obesity is a risk factor for HSV1 infection using a large sample from the general population.\nMethods/Principal Findings: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Examination and Nutritional\nExamination Survey (NHANES) from 2007\u00ad2008. Variables, gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, poverty\nlevel, and diabetes represented potential confounders and were included in analyses. The two-tailed Pearson's chi square,\nstudent's t test, and a multiple logistic regression analysis were applied to evaluate associations using a significance value of\np#0.05. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval represented the degree of these associations. The prevalence of\nHSV1 infection in US population between 20 and 49 years old was 60.3% (n = 1,536). In this study, having a BMI classified as\nassociation was stronger than three already established risk factors of age, female gender, and poverty level.\nConclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that obesity may play a role in the susceptibility to HSV1 infection.\nFindings from this study suggest that obesity should be considered when designing preventive measures for HSV1\ninfection. These results may also explain why some people acquire HSV1 infections and some do not. Further, these findings\nmay justify an increased emphasis on the control and prevention of HSV1 transmission and other pathogens in overweight\nand obese populations.\nCitation: Karjala Z, Neal D, Rohrer J (2011) Association between HSV1 Seropositivity and Obesity: Data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination\nEditor: Luwen Zhang, University of Nebraska \u00ad Lincoln, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2011 Karjala et al.

    "reduced_content": "Association between HSV1 Seropositivity and Obesity:\nData from the National Health and Nutritional\nZuzana Karjala1*, Diane Neal1, James Rohrer2\n1 Walden University, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America, 2 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America\n Introduction\nHSV is an intracellular pathogen that can affect the skin of\nmultiple parts of the body including anogenital region, mouth,\neyes, nervous system, and various major organs [1,2,3]. HSV is\ncontagious and humans are the only known reservoir [4].\nHSV belongs to a family of Herpesviridae, subfamily Alpha-\nherpesvirinae. HSV is a fairly large, enveloped virus containing a\ndouble stranded DNA encoding for more than 80 proteins,\nincluding enzymes directly involved in binding to cells, fusion,\nsynthesis, and replication. HSV usually infects epithelial mucosal\ncells, in which viruses replicate. The replicated virus follows nerve\ncells and usually settles in the trigeminal ganglia or sacral ganglia\nwhere it can become dormant. The dormant virus can be\nreactivated at any time by various stressors including sun, fever, or\npsychological stress [4]. Reactivated virus can travel back to the\noriginal point of entry and repeat the cycle.\nHSV triggers cell mediated immune response, which peaks\nbetween 7 to 14 days after infection, then declines and reaches\nconstant levels after 1 or 2 months [5,6]. The symptoms may be\nmild and not obvious to the carrier and for this reason, HSV\ninfections may often be unrecognized. It has been documented\nthat HSV infection may allow entry of other pathogens (e.g.,\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus), and the infected person may\nalso be at higher risk for diseases including bacterial vaginosis,\noropharyngeal cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and meta-\nbolic disorders [4,7,8,9]. HSV has the ability to ``trick'' the body's\nimmune system by binding Immunoglobulin Gamma (IgG), which\nenables the virus to go unnoticed, leading to persistent and\nrecurrent infections [10]. As it is extremely difficult to rid the body\nof this infection, the condition is a chronic one.\nHSV is usually transmitted via direct contact with infected\ndischarge from blisters, and the primary infection may occur at\nany stage of life. HSV are commonly divided into two primary\nsubtypes, HSV1 and HSV2, and these subtypes can be\ndistinguished antigenically [10]. Although both types can cause\ninfections around the mouth or the genital region, it is estimated\nthat more than 90% of oral infections (e.g., lips, mouth, tongue, or\npharynx) are caused by HSV1, and HSV2 is usually transmitted\nthrough sexual contact [4,11]. Recently, and in contrast to this\nestablished pattern, public health authorities have started noticing\na shift in the prevalence of genital herpes caused by HSV1 in some\nhas been hypothesized that this shift could be a result of a change\nin sexual practices (e.g., more common oral sex) and/or increased\nincidence of using condoms to prevent HSV2 transmission [13];\nhowever, further research will be needed to confirm these theories.\nThe shift in HSV ratio may have serious consequences. For\nexample, mothers infected during pregnancy or delivery can\nexpose their newborn babies to the risk for developing neonatal\nherpes infection, which often leads to neurologic disorders or\ndeath [15,16]. Findings from one epidemiological study on the\nprevalence of HSV in Canada indicated that more than 60% of\nnewborns with HSV were caused by HSV1. This finding suggests\nthat without effective preventive programs we may see an increase\nin this type of transmission. The transmission may occur\nprenatally, perinatally and after the birth; therefore, the emphasis\non prevention may be especially important in young women and\nmothers [17]. A recently noted change in the HSV1/HSV2 ratio\n(i.e., increase in HSV1 and decrease in HSV2) in some\npopulations suggests that new epidemics could be evolving [13].\nThere is no effective treatment for HSV infection, and preventive\nmeasures currently used are inefficient [18]. The identification of\nall risk factors involved in HSV1 prevalence is essential to alleviate\nthe burden of HSV infection.\nEpidemiological studies indicate that obese and overweight\npeople are at higher risk for postoperative infections and mortality\nassociated with infections [19,20]. The increased seropositivity for\nspecific pathogens has been identified in obese individuals [21,22].\nFor example, the association of adenovirus-36 with obesity in\nhumans and animals has been well documented [23,24]. Other\ninfectious agents including Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) and Helico-\nbacter pylori (Hp) have been also suggested to be associated with\nobesity [25,26]. However, the association with other pathogens,\nsuch as HSV1, still needs to be evaluated. The aim of this study\nwas to determine whether obesity is a potential risk factor for\nHSV1 infection.\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional study used NHANES data from 2007\u00ad\n2008. NHANES data were collected by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) and are publicly accessible at http://\ntested for HSV1 antibodies. After excluding 3 participants from\nserostatus. Only participants between 20 and 49 years of age who\nhad complete records for all tested variables were included in the\nanalyses and the final sample size used for analyses was 2,546.\nIn this study, HSV1 infection represented by seroprevalence\n(positive, negative) was a dependent variable, and body mass index\nrepresenting the degree of obesity status (BMI,25 for normal\nBMI.40 for severely obese). Age, gender, race/ethnicity marital\nstatus, poverty level, and diabetes were used as covariates. The\ndifferences between groups for the continuous variable, age, was\ntested by student's t test. All other variables were categorized, and\nthe differences between groups were tested by Pearson's chi-square\ntest. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the\nassociation between the dependent variable, HSV1 infection, and\nindependent variable before and after the adjustment for possible\nconfounding factors. Odds ratios with 95% confidence interval\nwere used to represent associations and p values less than 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nDetermination of HSV infection\nThe dependent variables for this study were seropositivity with\nHSV1. To determine serostatus, eligible study subjects provided a\nblood sample at the mobile examination center. Blood serum was\nsent for further processing to Emory University, where laboratory\nexperts used enzymatic immunodot assay (EIA) to detect specific\nantibodies.\nDetermination of Obesity status\nThe independent variable for this study was obesity status\nrepresentated by Body mass index (BMI). During NHANES data\ncollection, the body weight and height measurements were\nperformed by trained technician using calibrated equipment.\nThe body mass index was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by\nheight (m2). In this study, BMI was divided into four categories;\nconsidered overweight, BMI 30\u00ad39.9 was considered obese and\nBMI.40 was considered severely obese.\nDetermination of Covariates\nOther variables were obtained from NHANES questionnaire\nand, except for age, were also divided into categories. In all\nanalyses, age was treated as a continuous variable. All respondents\nover age of 20 were asked ``Other than during pregnancy, have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that\nyou have diabetes or sugar diabetes?''. For the purposes of this\nstudy, the participants who answered yes or bordeline were\nconsidered diabetic; participants who answered no were consid-\nered nondiabetic. The highest educational level of participants was\nbased on the response to:``What is the highest grade or level of\nschool you have completed or the highest degree you have\nreceived?''. To be consistent with associated literature, the\neducation levels were divided into 3 categories ``Less than high\nschool'', ``High school graduate/GED'' and ``Higher''.\nGender was assigned as ``Male'' and ``Female''. In this study,\nthe marital status was divided into two categories; single and\nmarried. The category ``single'' included widowed, divorced,\nseparated, never married responses and ``married'' included\nmarried and living with a partner responses.\nThe race/ethnicity category was determined from the question\nasked by the interviewer ``What race do you consider yourself to\nbe?''. The categories used in this study were as follows; Non\nHispanic White, Non Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and\nOther race/ethnicities.\nThe poverty level was based on poverty income ratio (PIR)\nincluded in the questionnaire. PIR was determined based on the\nmost accurate estimate for family income per year and family size.\nIn this study, the poverty level was categorized as follows; PIR,1\nwas labeled as poor and PIR$1 was considered as not poor.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data management and analyses were performed using\nSTATA 11.0 software [28]. The downloaded data were checked\nfor integrity before and after merging. NHANES uses a complex\nstudy design that requires the use of weighted methodology and\nproper clustering during the analytical process [27]. To address\nissues of unequal probabilities of selection and modification for\nmissing responses, appropriate weight variables (i.e., wtmec2yr,\nHerpes Simplex Virus 1 and Obesity\nsdmvstra, and sdmvpsu) were used in all statistical analyses. These\nweight variables were generated by NHANES in order the sample\nto represent the U.S. civilian non institutionalized Census\nBivariate analyses were performed to evaluate descriptive\ncharacteristics of the study participants and to evaluate dependent\nand independent variables. The bivariate analyses were performed\nfor the association of HSV1 and the independent variable, body mass\nindex (normal, overweight, obese and severely obese), and possible\ncovariates, such as age (continuous), gender (male and female), race/\nethnicity (Non Hispanic White, Non Hispanic Black, Mexican\nAmerican, and Others), education level (less than high school, high\nschool/GED, higher than high school), diabetes (yes, no), poverty\nlevel (poor, not poor), and marital status (single, married). Means and\nstandard deviations were used to represent continuous variables and\nproportions were used to represent categorical variables. The\nPearson's chi square (categorical) and student's t test (continuous)\nwere selected to determine the relationship between two variables.\nThe difference was considered significant when p#0.05.\nMultivariate logistic regression was used to examine the\nassociation between the dependent variable HSV infection and\nindependent variables before and after the adjustment for possible\nconfounding factors. The association between variables was\nrepresented by odds ratios with 95% confidence interval and p\nvalues less or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEthics Statement\nThe NCHS strictly comply with several laws and regulation\naddressing participant's confidentiality. Prior to data collection for\nNHANES, NCHS obtained an approval from NCHS Research\nEthics Review Board (formerly the Institute Review Board) [27].\nResults\nTable 1 characterizes the study sample. The prevalence of HSV1\n(n = 1,536). The average age of participants with HSV1 infection\nNon-Hispanic Blacks, 81.1% of Mexican Americans, and 69.0% of\nindividuals who identified themselves as from other racial/ethnic\ngroup tested positive for HSV1. Further, 75.3% individuals who\nhad education less than high school, 68.6% who had high school\ndiploma, 52.0% who had higher than High school education,\n56.9% of individuals who were single, 62.3% who were married,\n68.9% who were classified as poor, 55.6% who were classified above\npoverty level, 68.9% who reported to be diagnosed with diabetes,\nand 60.3% who reported not being diagnosed with diabetes also\ntested positive for HSV1. Age, race/ethnicity, education, marital\nstatus and poverty level tested statistically significant (p,0.05).\nTable 2 provides data on the distribution of BMI of the participants\nby status of HSV1 infection using bivariate analysis. The average\nBMI between HSV1 positive and HSV1 negative groups tested\nsignificant (p = 0.009) by Pearson's Chi square test. The BMI group\nwith the highest percentage of seropositives was in the obese group,\nThe logistic regression analysis was used to examine the\nrelationship between the main independent variable (BMI) and\nHSV1 infection before and after controlling for confounding\nvariables (Table 3). The bivariate logistic regression analysis\ndemonstrated that BMI of 30\u00ad39.9 was significantly associated\nTable 1.

When BMI was used in the full model, the multivariate\nlogistic regression revealed that the BMI for the obese group (BMI\nof 30\u00ad39.9) continued to be significantly associated with HSV1\ninfection in the U.S. population aged 20\u00ad49 years [adjusted\nadjustment for the independent variables of age, gender, race/\nethnicity, marital status, education, and PIR. The relationship for\ngroups was not significant (p.0.05).\nAdditionally, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were obtained\nfor covariates (Table 3). Results from the multivariate logistic\nregression analysis suggest that covariates, such as age [adjusted\nHSV1 infection (p,0.05). The relationship did not test significant\nfor marital status (p = 0.16).\nDiscussion\nThis quantitative, cross-sectional study was the first to explore\nwhether obesity plays a role in the distribution of HSV1 infection\nin the U.S. population using data from a national survey. The\nresults from this study indicate that obesity could play an\nimportant role in identifying a high risk population for HSV1\ninfection as having a BMI in the classification ``obese'' (BMI 30\u00ad\n39.9) was significantly associated with HSV1 infection before\nfor socio-demographic factors. This means that obese persons were\n1.5 times more likely to be infected with HSV1 when compared to\ninfected persons with normal weight. An odds ratio of 1.5\ncorresponds to a relationship of medium strength and therefore\nthe odds of being obese are stronger than such other already\nestablished risk factors, as age (adjusted OR = 1.40), PIR (adjusted\nOR = 1.37) and female gender (adjusted OR = 1.25). This finding\nsuggests that a BMI of 30\u00ad39.9 could be a significant factor in the\nsusceptibility to HSV and could potentially be used as an indicator\nfor susceptibility to HSV1 infection.\nFindings in this study are consistent with findings that suggested\nThis study is also consistent with studies that propose HSV1 as a\nsignificant risk factor for metabolic disorders and cardiovascular\nobesity is also a major risk factor for these disorders, it is possible\nthat obesity could be a link between HSV1 and metabolic and\ncardiovascular disorders.\nThe association of obesity and HSV1 could possibly be\nexplained by predisposition to the altered production of hormones\nTable 3.

This theory is consistent with findings from\nseveral studies which indicate that a dysfunction in the production\nof hormones involved in metabolism (e.g., leptin) alter immune\nsystem responses [32,33,34]. Other studies suggest that obesity\nmay be linked to an increased level of herpes virus entry mediators\n(HVEM), which could potentially increase viral entry [35].\nHowever, due to data limitations with the data, this theory will\nneed to be evaluated further when hormonal and HVEM levels\nare available.\nThe multivariate logistic analysis did not reveal a significant\nassociation between severe obesity and HSV1 infection (p = 0.79).\nThis finding is not consistent with a dose-response relationship\nbetween body fat and HSV1 titer found in different study [21].\nHowever, because there were only 6.6% of persons with severe\nobesity in the sample, it is possible that the relationship could be\ndetected when using a larger sample size.\nThe relationship was not found to be significant for overweight\ngroup (BMI 25\u00ad29.9), which suggests that higher level of obesity\nmay be necessary to show the relationship. This is consistent with\nfindings that HSV1 titer increases with fat mass [21]. Future\nresearch could examine contributing factors. For example, the\ndistribution of body fat in the body has been shown to contribute\nto the effects for metabolic disorders [36]. Therefore, it is possible\nthat such factors could possibly play a role in the association of\nBMI and the susceptibility to HSV1.\nViral infections have been shown to induce inflammatory\nresponses [5] and adipose tissue was shown to released hormones\nthat have been linked to susceptibility to infection in animals and\nhumans [30,37]. Therefore, it is plausible that obese people could\nbe more susceptible to HSV1 infections. This study provides some\nexciting findings, however more studies will be necessary to\nexamine why this association was not seen in overweight\nindividuals and persons who were morbidly obese.\nResearch reports indicate that genital HSV1 is now being\nidentified more frequently and the HSV1/HSV2 ratio is reversing\n[3,13]. Therefore, the awareness and preventive measures against\nHSV1 transmission will need to be emphasized. Preventive efforts\nshould mainly focus on prenatal screening, development of\neffective vaccines, and establishing a surveillance program to\nmonitor the effectiveness of implemented preventive measures.\nThese results also suggest that preventive measures should be\nfocused on Mexican Americans. One way to prevent mother-child\ntransmission is to incorporate screening programs into prenatal\ncare. Serological screening for HSV antibodies in the mother and\nher partner could help to plan for appropriate strategies during the\ndelivery and implementing effective counseling. In addition,\nsurveillance programs will need to be developed to monitor the\ntrends and the effectiveness of preventive measures.\nAnother preventive strategy that could be implemented should\nfocus on the development of effective vaccines against HSV.\nCurrently, vaccines focusing on minimizing of virus shedding are\nbeing evaluated [38]. However, more effective vaccines that would\nprevent HSV acquisition should be developed. The use of\npreventive vaccine would be beneficial especially for young\npopulation, women and obese individuals since they appear to\nbe most vulnerable to HSV infection.\nPreventive measures should continue to focus on modification of\nbehavior and improved personal hygiene to minimize the\ntransmission of HSV. Education about the virus transmission\nand safe sexual practices were demonstrated to be effective\n[39,40]. These measures should be emphasized in younger\npopulation and the development of preventive measures should\nbe implemented for the most vulnerable population including\npersons with weight problems and women.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the design of this study\nwas cross-sectional; therefore, the study does not provide evidence\nfor a causal relationship. On the other hand, this study used the\nmost recent data, which provides the latest prevalence estimates on\nboth HSV1 infection and obesity in the United States. Second,\nonly adults between 20 and 49 years old were used in this study,\ntherefore, results from this study cannot be extended to younger or\nolder populations. Third, in this study, HSV1 status was\ndetermined based on the detection of antibodies in blood samples\nand serological evaluation was not able to determine whether the\ninfection was acute and where the infection was located in the\nbody. However, the serological test was able to detect positive\ncases that were symptomatic and could identify people who were\nnot aware of being infected with HSV1 [4]. This serological\ndetection may provide more accurate estimates of infected\nindividuals.\nConclusion\nIn this study, individuals who were obese exhibited a higher\nprevalence of HSV1 infection when compared to individuals with\nnormal weight. Women and individuals with racial/ethnic\nbackground, other than non Hispanic White, were at higher risk\nfor HSV1 infections and should be the primary target for\ninterventions.\nThe prevalence of HSV1 was slightly higher that previously\nreported. New preventive efforts should mainly focus on prenatal\nscreening, development of effective vaccines, and establishing a\nsurveillance program to monitor the effectiveness of implemented\npreventive measures. Preventive programs should continue to\nconcentrate on modification of negative behaviors and on the\nimprovement of personal hygiene to minimize the transmission of\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: ZK.
