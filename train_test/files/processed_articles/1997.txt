Serum bilirubin, because\nof its antioxidant nature, has been conjectured to exert an anti-in-\nflammatory biologic effect. The objective of this study is to discern\nwhether higher serum Total Bilirubin(TBili) levels are protective\nagainst RA.\nMethods: This is a secondary analysis of National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected between\ntionnaire regarding their health history, underwent a physical ex-\namination, and had body fluids collected for laboratory studies. In\nNHANES, to assess for the presence of RA, the following questions\nwere asked: \"Doctor ever said you had arthritis?\" If so, \"Which\ntype of arthritis\". Statistical analysis was performed, using SAS\nversion 9.1, proc survey methods. Participant data were adjusted\nfor demographic characteristics as well as risk factors for RA.\nas a representative sampling of the entire US population. Exclu-\nsion criteria included age less than twenty years or liver dysfunc-\ntion, defined as history of abnormal liver function tests or liver dis-\nease. 8,147 subjects did not have any exclusion criteria and were\nincluded in the data analysis. RA is inversely related to the serum\nand remained significant even after adjusting for age, gender, race,\neducation, and tobacco history, with an odds ratio 0.749 (95% CI\n  \nConclusions: Our study supports the hypothesis that higher TBili\nlevels are protective against RA. A plausible mechanism for this\nassociation would be that the anti-oxidant effects of TBili exert a\nphysiologic anti-inflammatory effect, which provides protection\nagainst RA. This explanation is supported by prior studies which\nshow that higher TBili levels are protective against stroke, athero-\nsclerosis, and vasculitis. Further studies are needed to delineate the\nexact nature of the protective properties of TBili.\n",

Murphya, Ian Petersb, Pramil Cheriyatha\n Keywords: Bilirubin; Rheumatoid arthritis ; Antioxidant; Protec-\ntive\nIntroduction\nDespite great advances in drug development for Rheumatoid\nArthritis (RA), a large number of patients still tend to rely\non alternative treatments such as antioxidant therapy and\ndiet, suggesting that their RA is still not being adequately\ncontrolled. New therapeutic approaches targeting the un-\nderlying, pathologic inflammation in novel ways have the\npotential to bridge this therapeutic gap. In delineating the\netiologies of inflammation in RA, the generation of reactive\noxygen and nitrogen species has been shown to be critical\nto the genesis of this disease [1, 2]. Thus, modalities that\ndecrease production of reactive, oxidative, inflammatory\nmolecules would have direct disease modifying effects. One\napproach that has shown potential is vitamin supplementa-\ntion, such as with Vitamin E [3-5]. However, the literature\nremains unclear as to whether this theoretical benefit trans-\nlates into clinical improvement in RA patients.\nTotal Bilirubin (TBili) has been studied as a chemical\nwith similar, anti-oxidant properties. Unlike with Vitamin\nE, a growing body of data exists to show that its anti-inflam-\nmatory properties do translate into decreased human morbid-\nity [6, 7]. Indeed, literature shows that higher TBili levels\ncorrelate with a reduced risk of stroke, atherosclerosis, renal\nperfusion injuries, and angiotensin-mediated hypertension\n[8-13]. Despite this robust body of literature showing the\nbenefits of higher TBili levels in varied inflammation-related\nmorbidities, no literature exists investigating how higher\nTBili levels impact RA.\nManuscript accepted for publication October 8, 2010\naPinnacle Health/Harrisburg Hospital, 205 S Front Street, Harrisburg,\nbPhiladelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA\ncCorresponding author: dfischman@pinnaclehealth.org\nFischman et al\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 J Clin Med Res and Elmer PressTM | www.jocmr.org\nMethods\nSurvey design\nThe NHANES survey is a continuous assessment of health\nand nutrition conducted by the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) and its subsidiary, the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS). Findings from this survey are\nutilized to determine the prevalence of major diseases and\ntheir risk factors. The NHANES survey consists of house-\nhold interviews, physical and dental evaluations, and body\nfluid collections, such as blood and urine, of a representa-\ntive sample of the non-institutionalized, United States popu-\nlation, using a complex, stratified, multistage probability\ncluster survey design. Older individuals, children, Mexican\nAmericans, and African Americans are purposefully over-\nrepresented to insure a pre-specified minimum sample size.\nSampling weights are used to adjust the cohort distribution\nso that it more closely models the US population.

A to-\ntal of 8,147 subjects did not meet any exclusion criteria and\nwere included in data analysis.\nLaboratory methods\nSerum samples were collected and analyzed in a standard-\nized manner from fasting individuals as described in the\nWhite Sands Clinical Laboratory's Collection Procedures\nand Specimen Requirements Manual 8. Blood drawn from\nthe examinee's arm was processed and stored on dry ice at\n-70\u00b0C. The analyses were performed with a Beckman Syn-\nchron LX20. The serum TBili concentration was assayed us-\ning a timed-endpoint diazo method. This chemical assay is\npredicated on bilirubin reacting with the diazo reagent, in\nthe presence of caffeine, benzoate, and acetate as accelera-\ntors to form azobilirubin. The assay measurement instrument\ndetects changes in light absorbance, at 520 nm wavelength,\nafter the chemical reaction has progressed for a fixed time\ninterval.\nDefinition of variables\nNHANES survey interviewers completed an extensive two-\nweek training course prior to conducting interviews. A large\npercentage of the interview is conducted in both English and\nSpanish. RA was defined based on the subject's response\nto the following questions: `Have you ever been told by a\nFigure 1.

Participants who\nanswered `yes'to the question regarding liver disease or who\nhad AST values greater than 50 ng/ml on serum studies, or\nALT values greater than 50 ng/ml on serum studies, were\nexcluded from data analysis. Other co-variables included\nwere self-reported age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking sta-\ntus, education status, and marital status. BMI was calculated\nfrom height and weight measurements, and placed into 3 cat-\negories based on the CDC criteria of normal (less than 25),\nStatistical analysis\nNHANES uses a complex, stratified, multi-state probability-\ncluster sampling survey design. Due to the complexity of\nthis survey's design, we used SAS version 9.1's (Cary, NC)\nPROCSURVEY methodology. A Jackknife Replacement\nmethod was used to estimate the sample variance. Logistic\nregression models were created to look at the unadjusted\nassociation between RA and the TBili. Adjusted regression\nmodels, using the variables age, gender, race, marital status,\neducation, smoking and BMI, were also derived.\nResults\nOur analysis showed the data to be normally-distributed,\nwith a right tail (Fig. 1). The mean TBili level was 11.99\nmicromoles per liter with a standard deviation of 5.28.\nBased on prior studies investigating the disease preven-\ntative effects of TBili, our analysis stratified TBili levels as\neither less than or greater than 11 micromoles per liter [11].\nThe demographic characteristics of these two groups were\nthen compared (Table 1). With respect to the age-adjusted\nprevalence, males had higher TBili levels while females\ntended to have levels less than 11 micromoles per liter.\nAmong participants with a BMI less than 30, a higher pro-\nportion of subjects had higher TBili levels.\nWith respect to RA, a greater proportion of subjects who\ndid not report any history of RA had a TBili above 11 mi-\nwas a trend toward more patients in the RA stratification also\nhaving lower TBili levels (less than 11 micromoles per li-\nter), it did not reach statistical significance.

In this study, we found that this inverse relation\nbetween higher TBili levels and disease prevalence extends\nto RA as well.\nThe exact nature of this protective effect is not clear. We\ndo know that the inflammation inherent to RA results from\nimmunological reactions involving the activation of granu-\nlocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes [1]. These inflam-\nmatory cells, in the synovial fluid, are in an activated state,\nreleasing oxygen-derived free radicals that are lethal to the\njoint tissue [2]. One possibility for the protective effect of\nTBili with regard to RA risk suggests that Bilirubin clears\nperoxyl radicals, decreases oxidative stress and by binding\nto serum albumin can prevent in-vitro oxidation of albumin-\nFurthermore, unconjugated Bilirubin and Biliverdin\nhave been shown to exhibit immune protective effects on\nmurine liver and cardiac grafts. In the case of Biliverdin, this\neffect has been shown to be mediated by suppression of IL-2\nproduction, via inhibition of nuclear factor. Recent research\nhas shown that intracellular redox cycling of bilirubin to\nbiliverdin, a metabolite of bilirubin, may be important for\ncytoprotection [3].\nIn reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of this study,\nthis study's large sample size would lend itself to increased\nresolution of small differences in the groups studied. Fur-\nthermore, use of data from NHANES facilitates investiga-\ntion of the interaction among multiple co-variables and its\nstudy design facilitates generalization to the US population,\nas a whole. Since our analysis is based on data derived from\na survey, there will be an inherent inability to determine tem-\nporal association of higher TBili levels and RA. In addition,\nthis study is limited by the survey participants self-report\nFigure 2. Odds ratio of RA in subjects with higher TBili levels in\ncomparison to subjects with lower TBili levels.

These findings introduce the possibil-\nity of a therapeutic role of bilirubin as an anti-inflammatory\nagent, alongside pharmacotherapy, to reduce the process of\njoint destruction. Further studies, particularly cohort stud-\nies, are needed to confirm this association and to investigate\napproaches to manipulate the TBili level for the patient's\nbenefit.\nReferences\n1.
