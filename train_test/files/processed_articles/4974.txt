This study examines moderators and mediators of a yoga intervention targeting quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes in\nwomen with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy.Methods. Women undergoing 6 weeks of radiotherapy were randomized\nto a yoga (YG; n = 53) or stretching (ST; n = 56) intervention or a waitlist control group (WL; n = 54). Depressive symptoms\nand sleep disturbances were measured at baseline. Mediator (posttraumatic stress symptoms, benefit finding, and cortisol\nslope) and outcome (36-item Short Form [SF]-36 mental and physical component scales [MCS and PCS]) variables were\nassessed at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 1-, 3-, and 6-months posttreatment. Results. Baseline depressive symptoms\n(P = .03) and sleep disturbances (P < .01) moderated the Group \u00d7 Time effect on MCS, but not PCS. Women with high\nbaseline depressive symptoms in YG reported marginally higher 3-month MCS than their counterparts in WL (P = .11).\nWomen with high baseline sleep disturbances in YG reported higher 3-months MCS than their counterparts in WL (P < .01)\nand higher 6-month MCS than their counterparts in ST (P = .01). YG led to greater benefit finding than ST and WL across\nthe follow-up (P = .01). Three-month benefit finding partially mediated the effect of YG on 6-month PCS. Posttraumatic\nstress symptoms and cortisol slope did not mediate treatment effect on QOL. Conclusion. Yoga may provide the greatest\nmental-health\u00adrelated QOL benefits for those experiencing pre-radiotherapy sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms.\nYoga may improve physical-health\u00adrelated QOL by increasing ability to find benefit in the cancer experience.\n",

However, with the exception of some limited evi-\ndence,18 it is largely unknown if patients with elevated\ndistress derive greater QOL benefit from a yoga intervention\ncompared with their less-distressed counterparts.\nThe benefits of yoga are multifaceted, targeting not only\npsychological but also physical and spiritual dimensions of\nQOL.17 Thus, participant characteristics beyond psycho-\nlogical distress may moderate the efficacy of a yoga inter-\nvention. Sleep disturbances, potentially caused by the\ncancer process itself or cancer treatments, are commonly\nexperienced among women with breast cancer19-21 and are\nassociated with impaired QOL in cancer patients even when\ncontrolling for depression and fatigue.20,22,23 Because yoga\nis an effective treatment to improve sleep in cancer patients\nand survivors,9,24,25 it may be particularly efficacious for\npatients reporting high levels of sleep disturbances. In fact,\na multicenter RCT involving 410 survivors with moderate\nto high sleep disturbances demonstrated that an 8-session\nyoga intervention improved self-reported and actigraphy-\nassessed sleep relative to standard care.9 However, to the\nbest of our knowledge, sleep disturbances have not yet been\nexamined as a yoga intervention moderator.\nMediators of Mind-Body Interventions\nIn addition to lacking a clear understanding of for whom\nmind-body interventions are most helpful, no cohesive the-\noretical framework has been proposed to explain how and\nwhy yoga interventions produce change.26,27 A recent sys-\ntematic review reports that few potential mechanisms of\nyoga have been explored to date, and no mechanisms of\nyoga have been tested in cancer populations.28,29 The excep-\ntion is one study on mindfulness-based stress reduction for\ncancer patients, which includes some yoga. This study\nfound that increasing mindfulness partially mediated the\nintervention's beneficial effects on stress and posttraumatic\navoidance.30 However, in light of the growing RCTs exam-\nining yoga in cancer and the limited exploration of media-\ntors of this intervention, further examination of yoga\nmediators guided by a conceptual model is needed.\nWe propose a stress response model as a way to under-\nstand how yoga produces change in cancer patients. A diag-\nnosis of cancer and its treatment are typically experienced\nas stressful, or even traumatic, events, and yoga interven-\ntions are generally conceptualized within the framework of\na stress reduction program. Thus, practicing yoga may\nimprove health outcomes in cancer patients via modulating\nthe stress response.28 Put another way, yoga may affect\nposttraumatic stress symptoms, such as cognitive interfer-\nence and avoidance, while also increasing posttraumatic\ngrowth or benefit finding. Importantly, both constructs of\ntrauma response (ie, posttraumatic stress symptoms and\nbenefit finding) have been consistently and prospectively\nassociated with psychological and physical QOL outcomes\nWith this model in mind, we previously examined the\neffects of yoga versus usual care on intrusive thoughts/\navoidance behaviors and benefit finding in a small pilot trial\nin women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy.10\nDifferences between groups in benefit finding did not\nemerge until the last 3-month assessment time point, pre-\ncluding the examination of benefit finding as an interven-\ntion mediator. Surprisingly, the yoga group reported\nincreased intrusive thoughts 1 month after the end of radio-\ntherapy compared with the women in the usual care group,\nwith subsequent reduction at the 3-month time point, and\nnonsignificant reductions in avoidance behaviors.\nInterestingly, intrusive thoughts at 1 month were positively\nassociated with benefit finding at 3 months. There is some\nevidence to suggest that heightened levels of intrusive\nthoughts experienced during the aftermath of a traumatic\nevent may help individuals more effectively adjust to the\nstressor and ultimately to find benefit in the traumatic expe-\nrience.40 Thus, the increase in intrusive thoughts associated\nwith yoga may have led to better, more mindful processing\nof the cancer experience, ultimately fostering finding mean-\ning in the cancer experience.\nMoreover, within a trauma response model, cortisol\nrhythmicity may represent one biological pathway by which\nmind-body interventions improve health and well-being.\nBoth types of trauma response (posttraumatic stress symp-\ntoms and benefit finding) are associated with hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal axis function in cancer patients, which in\nturn is associated with behavioral symptoms (eg, fatigue,\nsleep disturbance, and depression), making changes to cor-\ntisol rhythmicity a potential mechanism of yoga.41-44\nAlthough previous studies have shown group main effects\nof a yoga intervention on diurnal cortisol and speculated a\nmediating effect, no empirical evidence exists to date.28\nThe Present Study\nThe goal of the current study was to examine moderators\nand mediators of a previously reported 3-arm yoga RCT for\nwomen diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing radiother-\napy.45 We focused only on mediators and moderators of the\nprimary outcome variable: health-related QOL. First, we\nhypothesized that, compared with active and waitlist con-\ntrol groups, the yoga program would be especially benefi-\ncial at improving posttreatment QOL for women with\nelevated pretreatment depressive symptoms and sleep dis-\nturbance. Second, we hypothesized that the beneficial QOL\neffects of the intervention would be mediated by improved\ntrauma responses (ie, short-term increases in intrusive\nthoughts and reduction in avoidance behaviors and increased\nbenefit finding) as well as better stress hormone regulation\n(ie, a steeper cortisol slope).\nMethod\nParticipants\nWomen were recruited prior to radiotherapy treatment\n(XRT), with inclusion criteria being the following: 18\nyears old; ability to read, write, and speak English; diag-\nnosed with stage 0 to III breast cancer; and scheduled to\nundergo daily adjuvant XRT for 6 weeks at MD Anderson\nCancer Center. Patients with lymphedema, metastatic bone\ndisease, deep-vein thrombosis, documented diagnosis of a\nformal thought disorder, and extreme mobility problems or\nthose who had practiced yoga in the year before diagnosis\nwere excluded. The protocol was approved by the institu-\ntional review board.\nProcedures\nDetails of the study procedures have been reported else-\nwhere.45 Briefly, after receiving written informed consent,\nself-report and saliva samples (for cortisol data) were col-\nlected from participants at baseline before randomization,\nduring the last week of XRT, and 1, 3, and 6 months later.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups:\n(1) yoga (YG); (2) stretching control (ST); or waitlist con-\ntrol (WL) using a form of adaptive randomization,46 accord-\ning to age, stage of disease, time since diagnosis, type of\nsurgery, and chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant).\nParticipants in the WL group received usual care, completed\nall assessments on the same timeline as the active groups,\nand were offered yoga classes at the end of their study par-\nticipation. All participants were asked to refrain from par-\nticipating in any other yoga classes while on study.\nParticipants in the YG and ST groups attended up to three\n60-minute classes per week during their 6 weeks of XRT.\nEach participant received an audio CD and a written manual\nof the program to encourage at-home practice.\nThe integrated yoga program, described previously,10\nincluded the following: (1) preparatory warm-up synchro-\nnized with breathing; (2) selected postures, or asanas (for-\nward-, backward-, and side-bending asanas in sitting and\nstanding positions, cobra posture, crocodile, and half-\nshoulder-stand with support); (3) deep relaxation (supine\nposture); (4) alternate-nostril breathing or pranayama; and\n(5) meditation. The program was taught by Vivekananda\nYoga Anusandhana Samsthana\u00adtrained teachers with spe-\ncific oncology training.\nThe stretching program included exercises recom-\nmended specifically for women undergoing or recovering\nfrom breast cancer treatment.47,48 The exercises approxi-\nmated the gross movements of the yoga exercises and were\ntaught by cancer center physiotherapists.\nMeasures\nPrimary Intervention Outcome: Health-Related QOL.Overall\nQOL was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item\nShort Form survey (SF-36) and was the primary outcome of\nthe clinical trial published previously.45 The SF-36 assesses\nphysical functioning, physical impediments to role func-\ntioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality,\nsocial functioning, emotional impediments to role function-\ning, and mental health and includes an overall physical and\nmental component scale (PCS and MCS).49,50 To reduce the\nnumber of analyses, only the component scales are included\nin outcome analyses. Higher scores reflect better QOL.\nProposed Moderators. Depressive symptoms were assessed\nusing the Centers for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepression\nmeasures (CES-D),51 a well-validated measure focusing on\naffective components of depression. Lower scores reflect\nfewer depressive symptoms. In this study sample, the inter-\nnal reliability was high (Cronbach's  = .89).\nSleep disturbances were assessed using the Pittsburgh\nSleep Quality Index (PSQI),52 a questionnaire that assesses\nsleep disturbances over a 1-month period. We report on the\ntotal score, with lower scores reflecting fewer sleep distur-\nbances. Acceptable internal reliability was found in this\nstudy sample (Cronbach's  = .70).\nProposed Mediators: Posttraumatic Responses.Posttraumatic\nstress symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event\nScale (IES), a scale that assesses the 2 most common catego-\nries of responses to traumatic events: intrusion (intrusively\nexperienced ideas, images, feelings, or bad dreams) and\navoidance behaviors (conscious efforts to avoid certain\nideas, feelings, or situations).53 We report on the intrusive\nthoughts and avoidance behaviors subscales and the total\nscore. Lower scores reflect fewer symptoms. Adequate\ninternal reliability was found for the total scale (Cronbach's\n = .85) as well as intrusive (Cronbach's  = .85) and avoid-\nance (Cronbach's  = .79) subscales.\nParticipants' ability to find benefit was measured by the\nBenefit Finding Scale (BFS),54,55 a scale assessing accep-\ntance of life's imperfections, change in priorities, and devel-\nopment of a sense of purpose in life as a result of having\nbeen diagnosed with cancer. Higher scores reflect greater\nbenefit finding. In this study sample, the internal reliability\nwas high (Cronbach's  = .94).\nCortisol Rhythmicity. Cortisol was obtained via 5 saliva sam-\nples (waking, 45 minutes later, approximately 8 and 12\nhours after waking, and at bedtime) for 3 consecutive days\nat each assessment. Participants chewed on a cotton swab\n(Salivette) and placed it in a plastic tube (Sarstedt), which\nwas then frozen at -80\u00b0C for later time-resolved immuno-\nassay with fluorescence detection performed at the Univer-\nclassified as missing. If patients missed a collection point,\nthey were told to leave the tube empty. Reliability for each\ncollection time point within a day across the 3 days and the\nonly 6 out of 25  values (5 samples a day at 5 time points)\ndropping below 0.50. Reliability was directly related to the\nsample size, which dropped off by the 6-month follow-up.\nA steeper, more-negative cortisol slope indicates better cor-\ntisol regulation.\nCovariates.\nPatients also completed basic demographic\ninformation (eg, age, marital status, education). Medical\ninformation was obtained from electronic medical records.\nData Analyses\nHypothesis 1: To evaluate whether the intervention was\nmore effective in regard to health-related QOL (SF-36\nMCS and PCS) for participants with high depressive symp-\ntoms (Hypothesis 1A) or greater sleep disturbance\n(Hypothesis 1B) at baseline, we used an ANCOVA frame-\nwork to first examine the Group \u00d7 Baseline moderator\neffect using PROC MIXED in SAS v9.2. This was fol-\nlowed by a Group \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Baseline moderator ANCOVA\nto see if the moderator effect varied by time. We controlled\nfor the respective baseline outcome as well as randomiza-\ntion factors (age, stage of disease, time since diagnosis,\ntype of surgery, and chemotherapy type). We also con-\ntrolled for baseline SF-36 general health scores in all anal-\nyses as a result of imbalances across groups. We treated\ntime as a categorical variable and the intercept as a random\neffect. We specified an unstructured covariance structure.\nFor significant 3-way interactions, we decomposed the\ninteraction according to high and low (mean \u00b1 \u00bdSD) base-\nline depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance and com-\npared the least-squared means (LSM) for each group at\neach time point using a general linear model analysis, con-\ntrolling for baseline levels of the outcome variable and\nillustrating the interaction by plotting the LSM.\nHypothesis 2: We were interested in determining media-\ntors of significant group effects on health-related QOL. The\noriginal trial45 demonstrated group differences in SF-36\nPCS at 1 and 3 months, and a subscale of the SF-36 PCS\n(physical functioning) at those time points and 6 months.\nWe chose to examine mediators of SF-36 PCS at 1, 3, and 6\nmonths, rather than the physical functioning subscale\nbecause the SF-36 PCS is a more comprehensive index of\nphysical health\u00adrelated QOL.\nTo determine the mediator variables, we regressed each\nproposed mediator (ie, IES, BFS, and cortisol slope) on\ngroup, time, and the Group \u00d7 Time interaction using the\nmodel and covariates described above. Where there was a\ngroup or Group \u00d7 Time effect on the proposed mediator\nvariable, we chose the time point associated with the largest\ngroup or Group \u00d7 Time effect as the mediator. If a proposed\nmediator variable did not significantly differ by group, it\nwas not further examined. Only primary outcome variables\nassessed after our chosen mediators were included as\ndependent variables in the mediation models to enable a\npredictive relationship between the mediator and the depen-\ndent variable to be established.56\nTo test for mediation, we calculated indirect effects using\nHayes and Preacher's bias-corrected bootstrap procedure\nvia the MEDIATE macro for SPSS, which is designed to\nestimate indirect effects of multicategorical independent\nvariables.57 Indicator coding of the grouping variable was\nused, with WL functioning as the reference group. D1 codes\nthe effect of YG compared with WL controlling for ST, and\nD2 codes the effect of ST compared with WL controlling\nfor YG. Indirect effects were determined significant when\nthe mean of the indirect effect across all 5000 bootstrap\nsamples was associated with a bias-corrected confidence\ninterval that did not include 0.57\nResults\nAttrition and Adherence\nparticipate; 13 dropped out before, and 15 after, randomiza-\nWL = 54). Measurements were obtained for 80% of the sam-\noriginal clinical trial45 for CONSORT). Out of a maximum\nin each group attended fewer than half the classes. There\nwere no significant differences in demographic, medical, or\nbaseline self-report scores between those who attended\n75% of classes compared with those who did not. For the\nYG group, self-reported practice outside of class was high\n(twice per week) at 1 month posttreatment and then\ntively). For the ST group, self-reported practice outside of\nclass (twice per week) was lower at 1 month and then\nrespectively). WL participants were offered the YG program\nafter data collection was complete, but no data were col-\nlected from the WL during or after yoga.\nThere were also no group, demographic, or baseline self-\nreport differences between those who completed the\n6-month follow-up assessment and those who did not (Ps >\n.14), with the exception that older adults were more likely\nto complete the 6-month assessment.\nBaseline Sample Characteristics\nThe 3 groups were similar on all medical and demographic\nvariables (Table 1). There were no statistically significant\ndifferences among the groups on any of the self-reported\nvariables at baseline, apart from the SF-36 general health\nsubscale. Women in YG reported lower baseline general\nhealth compared with those in ST (P = .01). Depending on\nthe time point, 21% to 34% of participants did not provide\nsaliva samples. There were no differences between patients\nproviding samples and those who did not based on group\nassignment, medical, demographic, or outcome measures.\nWe present the baseline and follow-up means of self-\nreported variables in Table 2.\nHypothesis 1: Baseline Depressive Symptoms\nand Sleep Disturbance as Moderators of\nIntervention Outcomes\nThere were no significant Group \u00d7 Baseline Depressive\nSymptom (CES-D) interaction effects on mental health\u00ad\nrelated QOL (SF-36 MCS). However, there was a signifi-\ncant Group \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Baseline CES-D interaction effect on\neffect varied by time. We decomposed the interaction\naccording to high and low (mean \u00b1 \u00bdSD) baseline CES-D\nscores. There were no statistically significant differences in\nSF-36 MCS scores between groups for those with low or\nhigh baseline depressive symptoms at any assessment point\n(Figure 1A). However, women with high baseline depres-\nsive symptoms in YG had a trend toward higher SF-36\nMCS scores at 3 months compared with WL (P = .107), and\ntheir 1-, 3-, and 6-month SF-36 MCS scores were no differ-\nent from those of women scoring low on baseline depres-\nsive symptoms. There were no significant Group \u00d7 Baseline\nCES-D or Group \u00d7 Time \u00d7 Baseline CES-D interaction\neffects on physical health\u00adrelated QOL (SF-36 PCS).\nThere was no significant Group \u00d7 Baseline sleep distur-\nbance (PSQI) interaction effects on mental health\u00adrelated\nQOL (SF-36 MCS). However, there was a significant Group\n\u00d7 Time \u00d7 Baseline PSQI interaction effect on SF-36 MCS\n(F\naccording to high and low (mean \u00b1 \u00bdSD) baseline PSQI\nscores. There were no significant differences in SF-36 MCS\nscores between groups for those with low baseline sleep\ndisturbances at any assessment point (Figure 1B). However,\namong the women with high baseline sleep disturbances,\nthere was a significant Group \u00d7 Time effect (F\nP = .003). Specifically, women with high sleep disturbances\nin YG reported higher 3-month SF-36 MCS scores than\ntheir counterparts in WL (t\n6-month SF-36 MCS scores than their counterparts in ST\n(t\ntime point were no different from that of women reporting\nlow sleep disturbance at baseline.

Results revealed no signifi-\ncant Group \u00d7 Time interaction effect on IES total scale,\nintrusive thoughts, or avoidance behaviors subscales scores\n(Ps > .5). Additionally, there were no main effects of group\nor time on the IES total scale or intrusive thoughts subscale\n(Ps > .2). There was a main effect of group (F\nP = .05), but not time (P = .6), for the IES avoidance sub-\nscale. Specifically, YG was associated with greater IES\nYG or WL (Ps > .1). Figure 2A presents LSMs of IES\navoidance for groups across time.\nThe time point at which groups differed most on IES\navoidance was at 6 months (F\ngreater IES avoidance scores compared with women in WL\nthe mediator does not enable examining a temporal relation-\nship between the mediator and outcome, and there were no\nsignificant group differences at earlier time points, precluding\nexamination of IES avoidance as an intervention mediator.\nBenefit Finding.Results revealed no significant Group \u00d7\nTime interaction effect on BFS scores (P = .9). However,\nthere was a main effect of group (F\na main effect of time (F\nfinding. Specifically, YG was associated with greater bene-\nSE = 1.19; P < .01).

Groups differed most on benefit finding at 3\nwomen in YG reporting greater benefit finding scores (LSM\nTherefore, 3-month benefit finding was examined as a\nmediator of group's effects on physical health\u00adrelated QOL\nTable 1.

First, YG resulted in\nhigher 3-month benefit finding compared with WL (the a\npathway; P = .04), whereas ST and WL did not differ in\n3-month benefit finding (the a\npathway; P = .84). Second,\nholding group constant, those who reported higher benefit\nfinding at 3 months reported higher 6-month physical\nhealth\u00adrelated QOL (the b pathway, P = .04). Third, relative\nto WL, women in YG reported higher 6-month physical\nhealth\u00adrelated QOL in part because of the positive effect of\nYG on 3-month benefit finding. Indeed, a bootstrap esti-\nmate of the indirect effect of YG compared with WL on\n6-month physical health\u00adrelated QOL via 3-month benefit\nfinding revealed a 95% bias-corrected and accelerated\n(BCa) confidence interval that did not cross zero (B = 0.77;\ning partially mediated the effect of YG on 6-month physical\nhealth\u00adrelated QOL. Conversely, the BCa confidence inter-\nval for the indirect effect of ST compared with WL did cross\nzero and was, therefore, not significant (B = 0.07;\n6-month physical health\u00adrelated QOL was not mediated by\n3-month benefit finding.\nCortisol.

There was a trend for a Group \u00d7\nTime interaction effect (F\ncally, YG was associated with a steeper cortisol slope\nFigure 1.

Figure 2C represents LSMs of cortisol slope for groups\nat each time point. Because the effects of group and Group\n\u00d7 Time on cortisol slope did not reach significance, it was\nnot examined as a mediator.\nExploratory Analyses: Changes in IES and\nOutcomes\nBecause women in WL reported unexpectedly lower IES\navoidance scores over time compared with women in YG,\nwe explored the association between changes in IES avoid-\nance and QOL outcomes by regressing group, change in\nIES avoidance at 6 months (the time point associated with\nsignificant group differences), and the interaction on QOL\noutcome variables (physical and mental health\u00adrelated\nQOL (SF-36 PCS and MCS), depressive symptoms (CES-\nD), and sleep disturbance (PSQI)) at the final follow-up\ntime point (ie, 6 months). There were significant interaction\neffects for mental health\u00adrelated QOL (P = .05) and depres-\nsive symptoms (P = .04). Pearson correlations within each\ngroup revealed no association between change in IES avoid-\nance scores and 6-month mental health\u00adrelated QOL or\ndepressive symptoms for YG or ST, whereas a greater\nincrease in IES avoidance scores was associated with worse\nand higher depressive symptoms (r = 0.42; P < .01) for the\nWL group.\nDiscussion\nThe present study hypothesized that participating in a yoga\nintervention during radiotherapy would be particularly ben-\neficial for women with high baseline depressive symptoms\nand sleep disturbances on posttreatment QOL compared\nwith their counterparts participating in stretching or waitlist\ncontrol groups. We also hypothesized that trauma responses\n(ie, change in posttraumatic stress symptoms and increased\nbenefit finding) and better stress hormone regulation (ie,\nsteeper cortisol slope) would mediate the effect of yoga on\nprimary outcomes. Results partially supported each of the\nhypotheses.\nConsistent with previous research suggesting that cancer\npatients with higher distress derive greater benefit from\npsychosocial interventions,18,58-61 the yoga intervention pro-\nvided the greatest mental health\u00adrelated benefits for women\nwith elevated sleep disturbance and, to a lesser extent,\ndepressive symptoms prior to the start of radiotherapy. This\neffect varied by time, with differences emerging especially\n3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Thus, yoga was espe-\ncially helpful for those women with disturbed sleep and\ndepressive symptoms at the start of radiotherapy. In fact, the\nwomen in the yoga group who had sleep disturbances at\nstudy entry had mental health scores at 3 and 6 months after\nFigure 3. Yoga indirectly affects physical health\u00adrelated QOL (SF-36 PCS) at the 6-month follow-up via increased benefit finding\n(BFS) at 3 months. Values on each path are unstandardized path coefficients taken from bootstrapping analyses controlling for age,\nstage of disease, time since diagnosis, type of surgery, chemotherapy type, and baseline benefit finding (BFS), physical health\u00adrelated\nQOL (SF-36 PCS), and the SF-36 general health subscale. The a\nand a\npaths correspond to the mean differences in 3-month BFS\nbetween YG relative to WL and ST relative to WL, respectively. Thus, YG resulted in 3-month BFS scores that were a\nhigher than WL (P = .04), and ST resulted in BFS that were a\n= 0.54 points higher than WL (P = .84). The b pathway corresponds to\nthe relation between 3-month BFS and 6-month SF-36 PCS when group is held constant. Thus, for every 1 point increase in 3-month\nBFS, individuals reported an average b = 0.14-point increase in 6-month SF-36 PCS (P = .04). The relative indirect effects of group can\nbe determined by multiplying the a and b paths. Thus, relative to WL, YG resulted in SF-36 PCS scores that were a\nhigher as a result of the positive effect of YG on BFS, which corresponds to a significant indirect effect of YG versus WL on 6-month\nAbbreviations: QOL, quality of life; SF-36, 36-item Short Form; PCS, physical component scale; BFS, Benefit Finding Scale; YG, yoga\ngroup; ST, stretching control group; WL, or waitlist control group.\nradiotherapy equivalent to those of women who did not\nhave sleep disturbances at study entry. A similar pattern was\nseen for the benefits of yoga for those with high depressive\nsymptoms at baseline.\nRegarding our mediation hypotheses, yoga led to\nincreased benefit finding across the follow-up period rela-\ntive to the stretching and waitlist control groups, where\nthere was consistent decrease over time. Importantly, we\nfound that yoga indirectly affected physical health\u00adrelated\nQOL assessed 6 months after radiotherapy via increased\nbenefit finding reported 3 months after radiotherapy. In\nother words, part of the effect of yoga on physical health\u00ad\nrelated QOL at the long-term follow-up can be attributed to\nthe increased benefit finding experienced by yoga partici-\npants midway through the follow-up period. Of note, the\nlongitudinal nature of the data enabled the time-lagged\nmediation analyses, which are critical for determining\nmechanisms of effect. This is a particular strength of the\npresent article because such mediation analyses are often\nlacking in intervention study designs.\nSurprisingly, women in the waitlist group reported less\navoidance behaviors (eg, \"I tried not to think about it;\" \"I\nstayed away from reminders about it\") 6 months following\nradiotherapy compared with women in the yoga group, who\nreported little change in avoidance behaviors from baseline,\nand there was no evidence of a decrease in intrusive thoughts\nover time for any group. This finding was counter to our\nhypotheses and that of other studies, which have found\nmind-body practices in general, and yoga in particular, to be\nassociated with reductions in avoidance-related coping.62,63\nHowever, exploratory analyses suggested that the typical\ndeleterious effect of avoidance behaviors on QOL64,65 was\nnot found for those in either of the active groups (yoga or\nstretching) but remained for those in the waitlist group. This\nfinding was somewhat consistent with our previous pilot\ntrial, in which the yoga group reported short-term increases\nin intrusive thoughts relative to the waitlist control group.10\nFurthermore, a meta-analysis by Helgeson et al66 found that\nincreased intrusive or avoidant thoughts about a stressor\nwere associated with increase in benefit finding, which was\nin turn associated with greater well-being. Thus, it could be\nthat yoga may not reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms (ie,\ncognitive interference or avoidance) in the acute phase, but\nthis in turn may facilitate improved long-term adjustment.\nThere are several limitations to recognize in this study.\nThe majority of participants were white, non-Hispanic,\nmarried, and highly educated. Thus, future research is\nneeded to test the generalizability of these findings to more\ndiverse populations. Participants also were not blinded to\nstudy condition, and no measure of treatment expectation\nwas collected, which could have biased the findings because\nof the subjective nature of the outcomes. In addition,\nalthough these data suggest that women with elevated lev-\nels of depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances show a\ngreater treatment response, these findings need to be inter-\npreted with caution because the patients were not selected\nbased on pretreatment symptomatology. The study may\nhave also been underpowered for the mediation analyses. In\na study of empirical power simulations, Fritz and\nMacKinnon67 indicated that very large sample sizes are\nrequired for tests of mediation to be conducted with at least\n80% power. Thus, the sample size of the present study\nlikely limits our ability to determine mediators with full\npower, and the same limitation may be true for moderation\nanalyses. Additionally, the reduced reliability of cortisol\nslopes assessed at later follow-up points (because of a\nsmaller sample size) may have limited our power to detect\nthe effects of cortisol slopes as a mediator in particular.\nFinally, we followed participants for only a 6-month period,\nso the long-term effectiveness of yoga in patients with\nbreast cancer remains to be determined. To address these\nlimitations, we are conducting an ongoing yoga trial using a\nquasi-double-blinded design, with patients not knowing the\ndetails of the intervention groups at baseline and then only\nknowing the specifics of their assigned group. Additionally,\nassessors are blind to group assignment. Treatment expecta-\ntions are also being measured, and patients complete a\n1-year follow-up assessment.\nIn conclusion, the current study provides a greater under-\nstanding of who will benefit most from a yoga intervention\nand how a yoga intervention produces change. These results\nsuggest that future studies of the effect of yoga on cancer\npatients may benefit from screening for participants who\nreport poor sleep or depressive symptoms because yoga may\nbuffer the negative effect of poor sleep or low mood on men-\ntal health\u00adrelated QOL indices in the months following\ntreatment for cancer. Additionally, these findings imply that\nyoga may improve physical health\u00adrelated QOL by increas-\ning one's ability to find benefit in the cancer experience.\nFinally, yoga appears to increase women's endorsement of\nsymptoms typically associated with posttraumatic stress (ie,\nintrusive thoughts and/or avoidance behaviors) but disasso-\nciates the typically harmful link between these symptoms\nand QOL. Based on these results, we recommend that future\nresearch continues to identify pretreatment psychosocial\nfactors that predict intervention response, seeks mechanisms\nby which interventions work, and begins implementing tar-\ngeted, tailored, evidence-based mind-body interventions to\noptimize recovery and QOL in patients affected by cancer.\nAuthors' Note\nChelsea G.
