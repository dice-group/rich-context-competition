It is evident that EH is a very important public\nhealth challenge because its complications, including car-\ndiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases, are major\ncauses of morbidity and mortality.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently\ndescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)\ncomponent that shares 42% identity with the catalytic\ndomain of somatic ACE, has been found to play a protec-\ntive role in regulation of blood pressure homeostasis and\ncardiac function.1 ACE2 has one active enzymatic site and\nis responsible for degrading Ang II to the vasodilator Ang\n1\u00ad7.2 ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein\nthat is found in most tissues, with its highest expression\nobserved in the endothelium and heart.3 Yagil and Yagil\nshowed that ACE2-knockout mice had 10 mmHg higher\nblood pressure and an enhanced response to angiotensin-II\ninfusion compared with normal mice.4 Thus, it was reason-\nable to hypothesize that ACE2 might potentially be a can-\ndidate gene of EH.\nSo far, a lot of studies have investigated the association\nbetween ACE2 polymorphisms and susceptibility of EH.5\u00ad19\nHowever, the results from these studies were inconsistent.\nThe association between angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 polymorphisms\nand essential hypertension risk: A meta-\nMei Yang1, Jing Zhao2, Lin Xing1 and Li Shi1\n Keywords\nEssential hypertension, ACE2, meta-analysis, genetics, polymorphism\n1Intensive Care Unit, Jinan Third People's Hospital, China\nDepartment of Cardiology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong\nUniversity, China\nCorresponding author:\nMei Yang, Intensive Care Unit, Jinan Third People's Hospital, Jinan\nOriginal Article\nAlthough three meta-analyses on this topic have be pub-\nlished, some inconsistent results still exist.20\u00ad22 For example,\nLu et al. reported that the ACE2 gene polymorphism\nG8790A was probably a genetic risk factor for essential\nhypertension.20 However, Zhou et al. and Li found that the\nincreased EH risk.21,22 In addition, all these meta-analyses\nfocused on one polymorphism: G8790A polymorphism.\nThey did not evaluate the associations between other poly-\nmorphisms and EH risk. Hence, we performed a meta-\nanalysis of all eligible studies to derive a more precise esti-\nmation of the associations of ACE2 polymorphisms with\nEH risks. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehen-\nsive meta-analysis of the association between ACE2 poly-\nmorphisms and EH susceptibility.\nMethods\nPublication search\nPublished studies were identified through a computerized\nsearchofPubMed,EMBASE,ChineseNationalKnowledge\nInfrastructure (CNKI) and Wangfang databases (last search\nwas updated on May, 2014). The search terms were used as\nfollows: (essential hypertension or hypertension) and\n(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2) and (polymor-\nphism or mutation or variant). We also perused the refer-\nence lists of all retrieved articles and relevant reviews.\nThere was no language restriction.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nEligible studies had to meet the following criteria: (a) only\ncase-control studies were considered, (b) the study\nexplored the correlation between ACE2 polymorphisms\nwith EH risk. Major exclusion criteria were: (a) no control\npopulation, (b) no available genotype frequency, (c) when\nduplication of the previous publications existed, the largest\nor most recent publication was selected.\nData extraction\nInformation was extracted from all eligible publications\nindependently by two authors according to the inclusion\ncriteria listed above. The following information was\nextracted from each study: first author, publication year,\nracial background, age of patients, gender, number of\ncases and controls, polymorphisms, and odds ratios (ORs)\nand the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of\nEH risk.\nStatistical analysis\nOR and 95% CI were applied to assess the strength of the\nassociation of ACE2 polymorphisms and EH risk. An\nallele model was used in this meta-analysis, because most\nof the studies reported the results in this model. Because\nthe ACE2 gene is located on the X chromosome, all of the\ndata for each sex were analyzed separately. Heterogeneity\namong studies was calculated using the 2-based Cochran's\nQ-statistic test (p < 0.10 was considered statistically sig-\nnificant heterogeneity); the inconsistency index I2 statistic\nwas also calculated to observe between-study variability\nthat was due to heterogeneity rather than chance. This sta-\ntistic, which was documented by percentage, yields result\nrandom effects model using the method of DerSimonian\nand Laird was used in this meta-analysis. Sensitivity anal-\nyses were conducted by deleting a single study each time\ninvolved in the meta-analysis to identify the potential\ninfluence of the individual data set on the pooled ORs.\nPotential publication bias was assessed by Egger's\nweighted regression method.23 All statistical analyses were\nconducted using Stata software version 11.0. All p values\nwere two sided.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nAfter a comprehensive literature search applying our\npatients and 5156 controls were identified in the final anal-\nysis. Two studies reported two case-control studies.\nTherefore, a total of 17 studies were included in this meta-\nanalysis. There was only one study with Caucasians, while\nthe rest of the studies used Asians. There were three stud-\nphism. The main study characteristics are summarized in\nQuantitative data synthesis\nThe ACE2 A1075G polymorphism. Three studies determined\nthe association between A1075G polymorphism and EH\nrisk.

In the C57BL/6\nmouse, ACE2 deficiency was associated with a modest\nincrease in blood pressure.24 ACE2 knockout mice have\nhighlighted hypertensive responses to Ang II infusion\nassociated with exaggerated accumulation of Ang II in the\nkidney. The transgenic ACE2 overexpression in spontane-\nous hypertensive rat (SHR) showed a reduction of mean\narterial pressure irrespective of heart rate. This ACE2\noverexpression model showed an increase of Ang-(1\u00ad7) in\nplasma and kidney, and attenuated blood pressure eleva-\ntion response to Ang II infusion.25 Taken together, these\nresults suggested that ACE2 was critical in the develop-\nment of EH. ACE2 was one of the most studied of the can-\ndidate genes for EH. The G8790A polymorphism was\nsituated in the intron adjoined to the extron, suggesting\nthat this locus could alter messenger RNA (mRNA) alter-\nnate splicing and affect ACE2 gene expression. The latter\nled to changes in the serum content of Ang1\u00ad7 that inhib-\nited vasoconstriction and cell proliferation.25 The func-\nbeen reported that some regulatory elements within\nintronic sequences or residing up to 85 kb upstream of the\ngene's promoter were still able to communicate with the\npromoter and regulate gene expression.26 Thus, one can\nmay be functional and could downregulate the expression\nof ACE2 and contribute to the increase in the susceptibility\nto hypertension. Thus, it was plausible that these two poly-\nmorphisms could influence the susceptibility to EH.\nIn the present meta-analysis, we explored the associa-\npolymorphisms and EH risk, including 17 eligible case-\ncontrol studies. For the ACE2 A1075G polymorphism, no\nsignificant result was detected. However, only three stud-\nies were included. Thus, the positive association between\nACE2 A1075G polymorphism and EH could not be ruled\nout because studies with small sample size may have insuf-\nficient statistical power to detect a slight effect. For the\ntrols were included. We found that individuals with the\n8790A allele showed an increased risk of EH in males and\nfemales, respectively. Actually, there was only one study\nwith Caucasians. Thus, we can conclude only that Asians\nwith ACE2 A1075G polymorphism might have increased\nEH risk. This result was consistent with the previous meta-\ncases and 2373 controls were included. There was a sig-\nnificant association between this polymorphism and EH\nrisk. Taken together, these results suggested that ACE2\ntant roles in the etiology of EH.\nThe present meta-analysis should be interpreted with\ncaution; several limitations merit consideration. First,\nbecause of a lack of original data from the eligible stud-\nies, we could not perform other subgroup analyses based\non age, smoking, and so on. Second, the numbers of\npublished studies were not sufficient for a comprehen-\nsive analysis, particularly for Caucasians and Africans.\nHowever, our meta-analysis also had some merits. First,\nwe investigated the association between three polymor-\nphisms and EH risk. Second, there was low heterogene-\nity in this meta-analysis.\ndevelopment. Further studies with a larger sample size are\nneeded to further assess the presence of an association.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
