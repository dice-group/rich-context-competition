IL-1b levels were determined in saliva samples via enzyme-linked immunosorb-\nent assays, undertaken before and after TNF-a inhibitor treatment. Psoriasis-specific analysis of\ndisease severity and activity were also undertaken.\nResults: At baseline, patients (n \u00bc 25) had significantly higher salivary IL1b levels than controls\n(n \u00bc 20). In patients with psoriasis, TNF-a inhibitor treatment resulted in significantly reduced IL1b\nlevels compared with baseline, but IL1b levels remained significantly higher than in control subjects\neven after treatment. There was a positive correlation between IL-1b levels, psoriasis activity and\ndisease index score after TNF-a inhibitor treatment.\nConclusion: Saliva is a valid noninvasive tool for monitoring inflammation in psoriasis. TNF-a\ninhibitor treatments appear to interfere with the oral inflammatory process in patients with\npsoriasis.\n",

Salivary biomarkers have\nbeen identified in systemic pathologies\nincluding cardiovascular disease, renal fail-\nure and malignancy.6,7 We have profiled the\ninflammatory cytokines present in salivary\nsecretions from patients with psoriasis.8\nThe aim of this pilot study was to evalu-\nate the change in salivary interleukin (IL)-1b\nconcentration in patients with psoriasis after\ntreatment with tumour necrosis factor\n(TNF)-a inhibitors.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis pilot study recruited consecutive patients\nwith stable chronic plaque psoriasis who\nwere attending the Dermatology Clinic,\nPolytechnic University of Marche Region,\nMarch 2014. Inclusion criteria were no peri-\nodontal involvement and no previous bio-\nlogical therapy. Age, sex and periodontal\nstatus-matched control subjects were recruited\nfrom patients with nonpsoriatic dermato-\nlogical conditions who were attending the\nsame clinic. A trained oral pathologist (A.S.)\nevaluated the oral cavity of each participant.\nPatients with psoriasis then began standard\nregimens of TNF-a inhibitor treatment.\nThe study was conducted in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinski,9 and all\nstudy participants provided oral informed\nconsent prior to enrolment.\nSample collection and analysis\nSalivary secretion samples were collected at\nbaseline (in patients and controls), and after\n12 weeks of TNF-a inhibitor treatment (in\nthe patient group). Samples were collected\ncircadian modification of salivary bio-\nmarkers, using a standardized collection\nmethod (Salivette\u00d5; Sarstedt, Nu\n\u00a8 mbrecht,\nGermany), and stored at \u00ad80C until use.\nIL-1b levels were evaluated via an enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay kit (Quiagen,\nVenlo, Netherlands) and expressed as\nabsorbance units.

Interestingly, TNF-\na inhibitor treatment reduced salivary IL-1b\nlevels in our patients. This may attenuate the\noral inflammatory process that could be a\npsoriasis trigger and/or perpetuate the per-\nsistent inflammatory process of psoriasis\nitself. Our study found that, despite being\nreduced by TNF-a inhibitor treatment, sal-\nivary IL-1b levels in patients remained\nhigher than in control subjects. Taken\ntogether, these data suggest that salivary\nIL-1b may serve as a biomarker of disease\nactivity in patients with psoriasis.\nThe main limitations of this study\nwere the small sample size, and the com-\nparative analysis with nonbiological agents.\nAlthough larger cohort studies are needed to\nvalidate our results, TNF-a agents appear to\ninterfere with the oral inflammatory process\nin patients with psoriasis.
