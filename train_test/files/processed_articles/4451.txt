Environments that foster physical\ninactivity and access to diet rich in energy are the most\nimportant determinants of this epidemic (Unwin et al.,\n2010.) In Finland, about 9percent of the population already\nhas type 2 diabetes. The amount of diagnosed patients with\ntype 2 diabetes has been doubled in intervals of 12years,\nand there is no sign of change in this trend (Koski, 2011).\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized\nby chronic hyperglycemia (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998).\nAchieving and maintaining recommended levels of glyce-\nmic control is the main target in the management of diabe-\ntes. Good glycemic control is essential in order to reduce\nmicro- and macrovascular complications associated with\ndiabetes. Glycemic control is best achieved by pharmaco-\nlogic therapy combined with lifestyle changes including\nweight loss, increased physical activity, and healthy diet\nAutonomy-supportive health-care climate is one factor\nthat is supposed to promote healthy lifestyle and good\nglycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes\n(Williams et al., 1998). According to the self-determination\ntheory (SDT), people are most effective in long-term glyce-\nmic control when they are autonomously motivated and\nfeel competent with respect to critical self-management\nbehaviors (Deci and Ryan, 1985). SDT assumes that people\nare oriented toward physical and psychological health.\nThey also have psychological needs for autonomy, compe-\ntence, and relatedness. Autonomous motivation and feeling\nof competence for effective self-management of diabetes is\nbest achieved in environments that support these basic psy-\nchological needs. Health-care personnel's autonomy- and\nHealth-care climate, perceived self-care\ncompetence, and glycemic control\namong patients with type 2 diabetes\nin primary care\n Keywords\ncompetence, diabetes, glycemic control, health-care climate, motivation\n1University of Helsinki, Finland\n2Folkh\u00e4lsan Research Center, Finland\n3Nordic School of Public Health, Sweden\n4University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden\n5University of Turku, Finland\nCorresponding author:\nAnne M Koponen, Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki,\nEmail: anne.m.koponen@helsinki.fi\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nrelatedness-supportive behaviors, such as acknowledging\npatients' perspectives and giving relevant information,\nrespect, and understanding, are supposed to enhance\npatients' sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness,\nwhich in turn is assumed to be positively associated with\nfavorable health behavior change and ultimately better\nphysical and mental health (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Williams\net al., 2009.) Need satisfaction and sense of being the initia-\ntor of the behavior and being competent to control impor-\ntant outcomes such as maintaining glucose levels in a\nhealthy range are assumed to give long-term psychological\nenergy for adapting and maintaining healthy lifestyle (Ng\nNg et al. (2012) showed that the SDT-model has got sup-\nport in several studies analyzing various variables as out-\ncome of care, for example, high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL)-cholesterol, HbA1c and glucose levels (Williams\nisfaction (Williams et al., 2005), and medical adherence\nHealth-care climate is an important but not the only\nfactor that possibly affects patients' perceived compe-\ntence in diabetes self-management and ultimately glyce-\nmic control. The effect of the larger life context, such as\nthe severity of the illness, other stressful experiences, per-\nsonality factors, and social support, should also be evalu-\nated. Patients with diabetes are forced to cope with\nself-management demands and threat of complications\nand their possible effect on daily functioning and impor-\ntant roles (Gonzales et al., 2011). Other stressful life expe-\nriences may additionally increase the general stress level\nand decrease emotional well-being. For example, the\nprevalence of major depression and minor depressive\nsymptoms has been shown to be significantly higher in\npatients with type 2 diabetes than in the general popula-\net al., 2010). Several studies have found an association\nbetween depressive symptoms and poor self-management\nof diabetes, unsatisfactory glycemic control, and compli-\nSignificant others in the person's social context may\nalso have an effect on perceived competence and glycemic\ncontrol to the extent that these persons are autonomy sup-\nportive (Williams et al., 1998). In addition, personality ori-\nentations, such as a strong sense of coherence, may\nenhance perceived self-care competence directly or indi-\nrectly by increasing the ability to cope with stress\n(Antonovsky, 1987). Socioeconomic status may be associ-\nated with glycemic control through health behavior, since\nmany unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking, poor dietary\nhabits, and physical inactivity, are known to be more prev-\nalent in lower socioeconomic groups (Laaksonen et al.,\nThis study extends previous research by examining\nwhether the perceived health-care climate is associated\nwith outcomes of care, in terms of perceived competence in\ndiabetes care and glycemic control, when the effect of a\nwide variety of other important life-context factors is con-\ntrolled for.\nWe hypothesize that an autonomy-supporting health-\ncare climate and autonomous motivation are positively\nassociated with perceived self-care competence even after\nthe effect of other important life-context factors is con-\ntrolled for. Also, we hypothesize that an autonomy-support-\ning health-care climate, autonomous motivation, and\nperceived self-care competence are positively associated\nwith good glycemic control even after the effect of other\nimportant life-context factors is controlled for.\nMethods\nData collection\nThe sample of the study was collected in 2011 from the\nregister of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII).\nSII is a Finnish government agency (funded directly from\ntaxation) in charge of settling benefits under national social\nsecurity programs. SII handles retirement pay, child bene-\nfits, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, health\ninsurance, and student benefits. All permanent residents of\nFinland are covered under the Finnish National Health\nInsurance (NHI) scheme and are eligible for reimbursement\nof medical expenses under the Health Insurance Act. SII\nkeeps the register of those persons who have entitlement to\na special reimbursement for medicines because of chronic\ndiseases such as diabetes. The sample for this study was\ncollected among persons who fulfilled the following inclu-\nsion criteria:\n1. Had entitlement to a special reimbursement for\nmedicines used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes\n(International Classification of Disease\u00ad10 (ICD-\nsafety prohibition at the time of the data collection;\n3. Finnish as native language; and\n4. One of the five study municipalities as place of\nresidence.\nA total of 7575 persons fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\nBased on power-analysis, a sample of 5167 persons was\ncollected: 2000 persons from the two large municipalities\nand all persons from the three small municipalities.

A reminder to\nnonrespondents was sent out in October, and another\nreminder with a new copy of the questionnaire was sent out\nin November. The final response rate was 56\npercent\n(n=2866). The response rates in the two large municipali-\nties were 54 and 56percent, and in the three small munici-\nmore often (57%) than men (54%). The response rate was\nEthical issues\nThe research plan was accepted by the Ethical Committee\nof the Hjelt Institute, University of Helsinki, and the per-\nmission to conduct the study was received from the SII. The\nsample was collected by the contact person who worked at\nthe SII, and the questionnaires were posted from there.\nRespondents returned filled questionnaires, provided only\nby an identification number, directly to the researchers by\nmail. An identification number was needed in order to\ncheck for nonresponse. Identity of respondents was not\nrevealed to the researchers at any stage of the sample or\ndata collection, nor was the content of the questionnaires\nrevealed to anybody else except the researchers.\nRespondents\nThe mean age of respondents was 63years (standard devia-\ntion (SD): 8\npercent of\nthem were men. Over half (56%) of the respondents were\nretired because of old age, 60\npercent were married, and\n59percent had less than higher professional education. The\nmajority (83%) of the respondents had a municipal primary\ncare health center as their primary care place in diabetes\ncare, and 74percent used tablets only for diabetes therapy\n(Table 1).\nMeasures\nMeasures used in the study are presented in Table 2.\nAveraged sum scales for health-care climate, autonomous\nmotivation, perceived competence, energy, emotional well-\nbeing, sense of coherence, life stress, and social support in\ndiabetes were calculated. The respondent was included in\nthe analysis if she or he had answered at least to 70percent\nof the scale items.\nStatistical procedures\nDescriptive statistics were estimated, and the baseline asso-\nciations between independent variables, covariates, and\ndependent variables were tested with Pearson chi-square-tests,\nt-tests, or one-way analysis of variance depending on the\nmeasurement scale of the variable of interest. In the final\nanalyses, multivariate linear and logistic regression analy-\nses were used. The correlations between study variables\nwere explored before the analyses by Pearson or Spearman\ncorrelations. The variables for the regression models were\nchosen on theoretical and statistical basis. Independent var-\niables that correlated strongly with each other, such as vari-\nables measuring mental well-being, were omitted from the\nregression analyses. Only the variable that correlated most\nstrongly with the dependent variable was chosen for the\nmodels.\nTable 1.

Statistical\nrequirements for normal distribution, linearity, and homo-\nscedasticity of regression residuals were fulfilled. List-wise\ndeletion of missing data was used.\nIn the mediation analyses between health-care climate,\nautonomous motivation, perceived competence, and gly-\ncemic control, the instructions reported by Baron and\nKenny (1986) were followed. First, the mediator was\nregressed on the independent variable. Second, the\ndependent variable was regressed on the independent var-\niable. Third, the dependent variable was regressed on both\nthe independent variable and on the mediator. A mediation\nexists if the predicted associations hold on each step of the\nanalysis and if the effect of the independent variable on\nthe dependent variable is less in the third step than in the\nsecond step. The mediation is perfect if the independent\nvariable has no effect when the mediator is controlled\n(Baron and Kenny, 1986). Statistical significance of the\nmediation was calculated by the Sobel test (Preacher and\nStatistical analyses were performed using complex\nsamples-procedure, which allows the use of weight coef-\nficients in order to correct bias caused by the different\nsample collection methods in the small (all patients with\ntype 2 diabetes) and big municipalities (a sample). SPSS\nversion 20 was used.\nResults\nHealth-care climate, reflecting the patient's assessment of\nhis or her doctor's autonomy-supportive behavior in the\nhealth center, was quite good (mean: 3.6, SD: 1.2, range:\n1\u00ad5).

A total of 42 percent\nof the respondents had at least one diabetes-related addi-\ntional complication of which retinopathy was the most\ncommon (18%). A total of 22 percent of patients had a diag-\nnosed depression.\nTable 2.

HbA1c\nreflects the average level of glycemic control over several months and has a strong\npredictive value for diabetes complications (American Diabetes Association, 2014).\nKoponen et al. 5\nThe four variables measuring mental health or positive\npersonality orientation correlated strongly, that is, energy\ncorrelated with emotional well-being (0.78***), sense of\nfour variables, energy correlated most strongly with per-\nceived self-care competence (0.36***) and glycemic con-\ntrol (0.12***).

Spearman correlations between\nemotional well-being, sense of coherence, diagnosed\nand -0.05*, respectively. Therefore, energy was included\nas an independent variable to the multivariate linear and\nTable 3 shows correlations between the variables chosen\nfor the final analyses. Health-care climate correlated posi-\ntively with autonomous motivation and perceived compe-\ntence. These three SDT variables correlated positively with\nperceived energy, perceived social support, and good self-\nrated health, and negatively with stress. In addition, auton-\nomous motivation and perceived competence correlated\npositively with good glycemic control and negatively with\nhigh body mass index (BMI), but these correlations were\nquite modest.\nTable 4 shows that perceived competence was strongly\nassociated with autonomous motivation and autonomy-\nsupportive health-care climate. In addition, perceived com-\npetence was positively associated with good status of\nhealth, energy, social support, and higher age and nega-\ntively with stressful life experiences.\nTable 5 shows that good glycemic control was strongly\nassociated with perceived competence but not with health-\ncare climate or autonomous motivation directly. The asso-\nciation between perceived competence and glycemic\ncontrol remained statistically significant after the effect of\ndisease related and other important life-context factors was\ncontrolled for. Of these factors, using tablets only as diabe-\ntes medication, higher age, higher professional education,\nand female gender were positively, and long duration of\ndiabetes, high BMI, and social support in diabetes care\nwere negatively associated with glycemic control.\nTable 6, describing the mediation analysis, shows that\nhealth-care climate was positively associated with autono-\nmous motivation and perceived competence and that the\neffect of health-care climate on perceived competence was\nreduced when the effect of autonomous motivation was\ncontrolled for. This indicates that autonomous motivation\nmediates the effect of health-care climate on perceived\ncompetence. Also, autonomous motivation was positively\nassociated with perceived competence and glycemic con-\ntrol, and the effect of autonomous motivation on glycemic\ncontrol disappeared after the effect of perceived compe-\ntence was controlled for, which indicates perfect mediation\nDiscussion\nThis study examined whether the health-care climate in pri-\nmary care health centers is associated with outcomes of\ncare in terms of perceived competence in diabetes care and\nglycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes. The\nresults of the study supported the predictions derived from\nthe SDT (Williams et al., 2005) and emphasized the impor-\ntant role of health care in supporting autonomous motiva-\ntion and perceived competence in order to reach good\nglycemic control.\nAs hypothesized, an autonomy-supporting health-care\nclimate and autonomous motivation were strongly associ-\nated with high perceived competence in diabetes care even\nafter the effect of other important life-context factors were\ncontrolled for. Autonomous motivation partially mediated\nthe effect of health-care climate on perceived competence.\nOur second hypothesis was partly supported. Glycemic\ncontrol was strongly associated with perceived competence\nin diabetes care but not with health-care climate and auton-\nomous motivation directly. The mediation analysis indi-\ncated that the effect of autonomous motivation on glycemic\ncontrol was mediated by perceived competence.\nBesides health-care-climate-related factors, disease\nseverity and other life-context factors played a role in the\noutcomes of care. Perceived competence in diabetes care\nwas positively associated with good perceived health,\nenergy, social support, and higher age, and negatively asso-\nciated with stress. Glycemic control was positively associ-\nated with using tablets only as diabetes medication, higher\nage, high professional education, and female gender, and\nnegatively associated with long duration of diabetes, high\nBMI, and high social support in diabetes care. These results\nindicate that it is important to promote general health and\nwell-being of patients with type 2 diabetes. As stated by\nGonzales et al. (2007), the assessment of the psychological\nand social situation of patients should be included as an\nongoing part of the medical management of diabetes.\nSocial support in diabetes care was positively associated\nwith perceived competence but negatively associated with\nglycemic control. This may be due to the fact that those\nwith poor glycemic control were more often insulin users\nand thus seemed to have a more serious illness and more\nneed of support in diabetes care.\nA total of 22percent of the patients in this study reported\ndiagnosed depression, while the prevalence of depression in\nthe whole population of Finland is about 5\npercent (Pirkola\net al., 2005). This result is in line with the studies in other\ncountries that show higher prevalence of depression among\npatients with type 2 diabetes compared with the general pop-\net al., 2010). However, of the four variables that we used to\nmeasure mental well-being, energy correlated most strongly\nand diagnosed depression most weakly with perceived com-\npetence in diabetes care and glycemic control. Also, the\n6 Health Psychology Open \nTable 3. Correlations matrix between study variables.\n1. Climate \n2.

(2010) showed that diabetes distress,\nwhich is a minor affective variable, was associated with gly-\ncemic control but major depressive disorder was not. These\nresults indicate that minor affective variables, such as energy\nand diabetes distress, may be better predictors of glycemic\ncontrol than diagnosed major depressive disorder.\nTable 4.

In addition to\nthese variables, we analyzed the effect of many health behav-\nior variables describing eating habits and physical exercise\non glycemic control. However, we found that BMI, which\nreflects the result of health behavior, was a better predictor of\nglycemic control than health behavior variables separately.\nTherefore, we included BMI to the final analyses. Also, per-\nceived status of health was a better predictor of glycemic\ncontrol than reported complications, and therefore perceived\nstatus of health was chosen for the final analyses.\nThe strength of this study was that in the analyses, we\nwere able to control the effect of many important diabetes\nand life-context related factors. Even after this, the predic-\ntions of the SDT held. The data, based on self-reports, were\nhighly reliable when compared with register data. We com-\npared basic information (diagnosis age, duration of diabe-\ntes, medication, HbA1c-values, BMI) with register data\nfrom the whole country (Valle et al., 2010) and information\non glycemic control also with the electronic medical\nrecords from the municipal health centers in the study\nOne limitation of the study was that, due to question-\nnaire technical reasons, we used 5-point Likert-scales\ninstead of 7-point scales in the health-care climate ques-\ntionnaire (HCCQ) and perceived competence scale (PCS)\nmeasures. However, we found no indication that this would\nhave reduced the validity of these measures. In fact, for\nelderly people, as a majority of respondents were, it may be\neasier to fill a 5-point scale. Another limitation of the study\nwas that a cross-sectional study is not methodologically\ncapable to state anything about directionality of the hypoth-\nesized relations. However, 95\npercent of the respondents\nhad been at least 1year, and 84percent over 2years in care\nin their current and principal primary care health center.\nAlso, 75percent of the respondents had a family doctor or a\n\"regular\" doctor. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that\ncare provided by the doctor and other health-care personnel\nin the health center has influenced the patient's motivation\nand perceived competence in diabetes care. In future, longi-\ntudinal intervention studies are needed.\nIn summary, the results of this study were in line with\nprevious studies based on SDT (Ng et al., 2012) and gave\nfurther support to this model. An autonomy-supportive\nhealth-care climate may increase patients' sense of auton-\nomy and competence that gives energy for long-term\nchange in self-management behavior and thus can lead to\nbetter health. SDT can be used as a conceptual framework\nto plan interventions for improved diabetes care.\nConclusion\nHealth-care personnel's main task is to support patients'\nautonomy and perceived self-care competence in order to\nTable 6.
