The association\nbetween emergence agitation and CRBD\nwas examined, and additional perioperative\nvariables were evaluated as risk factors for\nemergence agitation in this patient group.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study included adult\npatients (aged 20\u00ad90 years) with American\nSociety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical\nstatus 1\u00ad3, admitted to the PACU after\nelective urological surgery under general\nanaesthesia with an endotracheal tube or a\nsupraglottic airway device at Seoul National\nUniversity Hospital, Seoul, Republic of\n2012. Patients' electronic medical records\nwere reviewed by two board-certified anaes-\nthetists (E.K. and H.C.K.) and one resident\nanaesthetist (J.H.S.). Exclusion criteria were:\nneurological disease potentially associated\nwith symptoms of agitation or intellectual\ndisability; transfer to intensive care unit.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Seoul\nNational University Hospital, Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea, and the requirement\nfor patient consent was waived.\nGeneral anaesthesia\nAll patients received controlled mechanical\nventilation during general anaesthesia; no\npatient was premedicated. Anaesthesia was\ninduced with 2 mg/kg propofol or 5 mg/kg\nthiopental and maintained with: (i) inhal-\nation anaesthesia (1\u00ad4 vol% sevoflurane or\n4\u00ad8 vol% desflurane, and intermittent\n0.5\u00ad1 mg/kg fentanyl injection); or (ii) intra-\nvenous anaesthesia (continuous effect site\nconcentration: 3\u00ad5 mg/ml propofol and effect\nsite concentration: 2\u00ad5 ng/ml remifentanil\ninfusion using a target-controlled infusion\ndevice [Orchestra; Fresenius-Vial, Brezins,\nFrance]). Intubation was facilitated via\n0.8 mg/kg rocuronium intravenous injection\nor I-gel\u00d5 (Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK;\nused in some patients undergoing\nendoscopic surgery such as transurethral\nresection of bladder tumour).\nNeuromuscular blockade was maintained\nnium. About 20 min before the end of\nsurgery, 30 mg ketorolac was administrated\nfor pain relief in patients without a patient-\ncontrolled analgesia (PCA) device. The\nmajority of patients with a PCA received\n0.3 mg ramosetron (majority of patients) or\n0.075 mg palonosetron (three patients) and\nopioid-based intravenous PCA (20\u00ad30 mg/kg\nfentanyl and 0.3 mg ramosetron; total\nvolume 100 ml, loading 1 ml, basal infusion\n15 min). At the end of surgery, residual\nneuromuscular blockade was reversed with\natropine. Most patients were extubated in\nthe operating room and transferred to the\nPACU. No patient received epidural cath-\neterization for intraoperative or postopera-\ntive pain control.\nPostoperative assessment\nEmergence agitation was assessed in the\nPACU by attending anaesthetic nurses\nusing the Riker sedation\u00adagitation score.8\nEmergence agitation was defined as a Riker\nscore !5 at any time in the PACU.\nPostoperative pain was assessed by attend-\ning anaesthetic nurses using an 11-point\nnumerical rating scale (0, no pain; 10,\nworst imaginable pain) on admission to\n(and discharge from) the PACU. Pain\nscore was also assessed whenever patients\nasked for pain medication. If the pain score\ntered as rescue medicine. The maximum\npain score was included in the analysis.\nNausea, vomiting, shivering and dizziness\nwere also assessed at the time of pain\nassessment in PACU. Patients with moder-\nate-to-severe nausea and vomiting were\ngiven 4 mg ondansetron (patients without\nintraoperative ramosetron administration)\nor 1 mg/kg dexamethasone (patients with\nintraoperative ramosetron administration).\nPatients with moderate-to-severe shivering\nwere given 25 mg pethidine. Haemodynamic\nand respiratory parameters were assessed to\nfind correctable factors when severe dizzi-\nness was detected. Patients were discharged\nfrom the PACU if they were conscious, had\na pain score of 3, stable vital signs for\n30 min and no shivering, bleeding, nausea or\nvomiting.\nData collection\nData were retrieved from patient electronic\nmedical charts and categorized into pre-,\nintra- and postoperative variables.\nPreoperative variables included: demo-\ngraphics; ASA physical status; history of\nsmoking and social drinking; educational\nstate; nil-by-mouth duration; serum albu-\nmin; and surgical history within 3 months.\nIntraoperative variables included: surgical\nsite; endoscopic surgery (such as transureth-\nral resection of ureter stones, or bladder and\nprostate lesions); anaesthetic induction\nagent (propofol or thiopental); airway\ninstrument (endotracheal tube or I-gel\u00d5);\nanaesthesia maintenance agent (sevoflurane\nor desflurane or intravenous anaesthesia);\nnitrous oxide use; antiemetic use; transfu-\nsion; remifentanil continuous infusion; total\nintraoperative opioid dose (remifentanil\ndose was converted to equivalent dose of\nfentanyl with a ratio of 1 : 19); duration of\nsurgery; duration of anaesthesia.\nPostoperative variables included: postopera-\ntive pain score; voiding urgency; nausea;\nvomiting; shivering; dizziness. The presence\nof a tracheal tube, urinary catheter and\ngastric tube in PACU were also noted.\nStatistical analyses\nThe incidence of emergence agitation in\npatients undergoing urological surgery has\nbeen reported as 4.1% in.1 The present study\nrequired a minimum of 467 patients to\nreproduce the incidence of emergence agita-\ntion, with a two-sided 95% confidence\ninterval width of 3.6%.\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD, n (%)\nor median (interquartile range [IQR]).\nPatients were stratified according to the\npresence or absence of emergence agitation.\nStudent's t-test and 2 or Fisher's exact test\n(if the number in a cell was less than five)\nwere used for between-group comparisons of\ncontinuous and categorical variables,\nrespectively. Variables with P-values <0.1\nin the primary test were included in binary\nlogistic regression to identify independent\nrisk factors for emergence agitation.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 494 patients, of whom six\nwere excluded because of transfer to the\nsurgical intensive care unit.

A long duration of sur-\ngery, history of social drinking, presence of a\ngastric tube, chronic lung disease and severe\npostoperative pain were predictive of emer-\ngence agitation.\nTable 3.

The overall inci-\ndence of emergence agitation was reported\nto be 5% in two large-scale PACU-based\nprospective studies using the Riker sed-\nation\u00adagitation scale and Richmond agita-\ntion and sedation scale, respectively.1,4\nSubgroup analyses indicated the incidence\nof emergence agitation was 4.1% in adult\nurology patients.1 A further study that\nevaluated emergence agitation using a\nthree-point scale reported that 21.3% of\npatients developed postoperative emergence\nagitation in the PACU,5 with subgroup\nanalysis indicating the incidence in urology\npatients to be 13.6%.5 These differences may\nbe explained by variations in surgical site,\nthe scale used for patient assessment, inter-\nobserver agreement and possible\nunderestimation as a result of retrospective\nstudy design.\nThe presence of a urinary catheter is a\nknown risk factor for emergence agitation.5\nAll patients who experienced postoperative\nemergence agitation in the present study had\na urinary catheter, and CRBD was asso-\nciated with an increased risk of emergence\nagitation.

It\nis necessary to reduce CRBD in these\npatients in order to prevent emergence agi-\ntation. Early removal of the Foley catheter\nwill reduce patient discomfort.\nTable 4.

Studies in\npatients with lung cancer, however, demon-\nstrated that pneumonia is associated with\nhyperactive delirium.21 Acute hypoxia or\nhypercapnia due to lung disease may result\nin additional postoperative stress, increasing\nthe risk of emergence agitation.\nAlcohol use is a risk factor for post-\noperative delirium.22\u00ad24 This is consistent\nwith our finding that a history of social\ndrinking was a risk factor for emergence\nagitation. This may be due to acute with-\ndrawal of alcohol during the perioperative\nperiod.\nDuration of surgery was associated with\nemergence agitation in the present study and\nthose of others.1 Although it is considered a\nnonpreventable factor, using a surgical\ntraining programme that can increase the\nskill of the associated medical staff may\nreduce the duration of surgery. Moreover,\nclose communication and co-operation\namong medical teams may be necessary to\nreduce any unnecessary delays during sur-\ngery. The presence of a gastric tube was also\nassociated with increased postoperative\nemergence agitation in the present study.\nSimilar to a urinary catheter, a nasogastric\ntube can distress a patient during anaesthetic\nemergence by stimulating the gag reflex.\nTherefore, to diminish patient discomfort,\nthe nasogastric tube should be removed as\nearly as possible.\nDespite the significantly higher incidence\nof emergence agitation in male patients than\nfemale patients in the present study, male\nsex was not an independent risk factor. The\nrole of sex as a risk factor for emergence\nagitation remains unclear, with some studies\nreporting that male sex is a risk factor5 and\nothers that it is not.1,4 The high proportion\nof male patients in the present study (81.8%)\nlimits the usefulness of our findings.\nIn our hospital, large Foley catheters are\nused in transurethral resection of bladder\nand prostate lesions to facilitate postopera-\ntive bladder irrigation and prevent obstruc-\ntion of the catheter due to blood clots. We\nexpected that the incidence of emergence\nagitation would be higher in patients\nundergoing endoscopic surgery because a\nFoley catheter with large diameter and con-\ntinuous bladder stimulation with irrigation\nfluids is associated with CRBD. In contrast\nto our expectation, patients undergoing\nendoscopic urological surgery had a lower\nincidence of emergence agitation than those\nundergoing nonendoscopic surgery,\nalthough surgery type was not an independ-\nent risk factor in multivariate analysis.\nPostoperative emergence agitation can\nresult in serious complications, and self-\nextubation can lead to arterial hypoxaemia\nor aspiration pneumonia. In this study, one\npatient required reintubation in the PACU\nbecause of desaturation after self-extuba-\ntion. It is most important to protect patients\nfrom self-injury, even before the cause of\nemergence agitation is identified. Once the\ncause is identified it should be immediately\nresolved. If this is not possible (e.g. removal\nof a urinary catheter in patients needing\npostoperative urine output monitoring),\nreassurance and pharmacological treatment\ncan reduce the incidence of emergence agi-\ntation related to CRBD.\nOur study has several limitations. First,\nthe retrospective nature of the investigation\nmeant that there were limitations in the data\navailable. There was insufficient information\nrelated to preoperative anxiety, preoperative\nbenzodiazepine administration for pre-\nmedication or the use of intravenous anaes-\nthetic agents for anaesthetic maintenance to\nallow us to evaluate their effects on emer-\ngence agitation in full. Preoperative anxiety,\npremedication with benzodiazepines and\nintraoperative use of an inhalation agent\nare known risk factors for emergence\npants were undergoing urological surgery\nand CRBD is associated with an increased\nrisk of emergence agitation. Thus, our\nfindings may not be applicable to other\nsurgical patients, particularly those who do\nnot require intraoperative urinary catheter-\nization. Thirdly, we used the Riker sed-\nation\u00adagitation score to evaluate emergence\nagitation. To our knowledge, there is no\ngold standard for diagnosis and other\nparameters such as the Richmond agita-\ntion\u00adsedation scale can be used instead.\nIn addition, there was no causal relationship\nbetween postoperative variables and emer-\ngence agitation. Rescue medications (such as\nfentanyl for postoperative pain relief, antie-\nmetics for moderate-to-severe nausea and\nvomiting, and pethidine for shivering) can\nalter the incidence of emergence agitation.\nCaution is therefore needed in interpreting\nour results. Finally, this study focused on\npostoperative emergence agitation, not\nhypoactive emergence. Eight (1.6%) of our\npatients were highly sedated or unarousable\nin the PACU: these might be considered to\nbe cases of hypoactive emergence. Risk\nfactors for hypoactive emergence were not\nanalysed in this study because of the small\nnumber of cases.\nIn conclusion, emergence agitation occur\nin around 10% of adult patients undergoing\nurological surgery. Chronic lung disease, a\nhistory of social drinking, voiding urgency\ndue to an indwelling Foley catheter, long\nduration of surgery, inadequate postopera-\ntive pain control and presence of a gastric\ntube were associated with emergence\nagitation. Adequate postoperative pain\nmanagement and prevention of CRBD\nmay be helpful in reducing the incidence of\nemergence agitation in urology patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\n"
