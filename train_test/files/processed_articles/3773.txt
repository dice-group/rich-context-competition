He thought that, in a passage from the\nPhysics, Aristotle had `seen the principle of natural selection shadowed forth'\n(Darwin, 1861, p. xiii, quoting Physics, ii.8). In the Origin's 1st edition, Darwin had\nalready traced his theory back to an ancient Chinese encyclopedia, to Pliny's Natural\nHistory, to `savages' in Africa--and to passages in Genesis (Darwin, 1859, p. 31).\nAs he was at pains to show, it was very far from true that his theory of natural\nselection was new.\nDarwin`s theory predicts that individuals should evolve to compete--for\nhabitats, for food, for mates. In the 1871 sequel to Origin of Species, his book On the\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nDescent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, he wrote: `it is certain that amongst\nalmost all animals there is a struggle between the males for the possession of the\nfemales.' And H. sapiens was no exception. `With savages, the women are the\nconstant cause of war'--not just between, but within groups, he wrote. So it had\nbeen, back to the ancient Greeks at least. `Nam fuit ante Helenam mulier teterrima\nquoting Horace, Satires, i.3).\nIn 1948 an Italian entomologist, Leo Pardi, first carefully described a paper\nwasp dominance hierarchy, and showed that dominant wasps had higher reproductive\nsuccess. They ate more, worked less, laid more eggs, and ate the eggs others had laid\n(Pardi, 1948; Turillazi and West-Eberhard, 1996). In the half century since Pardi, the\nrelationship between success in competition and success in reproduction has been\nestablished almost 700 times. For some taxonomic groups, results are almost\nunanimous. Results are most hotly debated for primates (Cowlishaw and Dunbar,\nThen in 1976 an American anthropologist, Bill Irons, did the first statistical\ntest of the relationship between `cultural' and `biological' success (Irons, 1976, 1979,\n1997). He looked at the Yomut Turkmen, nomadic herders living in Iran, and found\nthat rich men had more wives and surviving children than poor men. In dozens of\nstudies since then, men with means (meat, land, cash, kin, or rank) have reportedly\noutreproduced men without--in both foraging and farming groups (Betzig, 1997;\nThis paper tests Darwin's theory against the Old Testament evidence.\nCenturies before Aristotle or Horace, millennia before The Origin of Species or The\nDescent of Man, the Hebrew people were blessed by a mandate from god to\nreproduce. And they did their best to fulfill it. From Lamech the patriarch, to\nZedekiah the last king of Judah, they tried to `be fruitful and multiply, and fill the\nearth and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). Throughout the Old Testament, more powerful\nmen are more polygynous men. They have sex with more wives and concubines;\nthey have sex with more slaves; they have more sex with other men's women; and\nthey father many children.\nThe Bible shares drawbacks with other historical sources. One problem is, the\nsample isn't always representative. Like most histories, the Old Testament was\nwritten by and about powerful men. The commons are mostly ignored. But\naggregate data can help profile the masses--some archaeological, some demographic.\nIt shows that most ancient Near Eastern families lived in small, two-to-four room\nhouses; and that many paid tribute--around a thousand jar handles from 8th-century\nBCE Judah are labeled lmlk, or `belonging to the king' (see Stager, 1985 on houses\nhistory). Even in the scriptures, thousands of anonymous men work as forced\nlaborers, or are killed as soldiers. And of the 41 polygynists named in the Old\nTestament, not one is a powerless man (Table 1).\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nAnother problem is, the evidence isn't always reliable. Like most histories,\nthe Old Testament was put together by a handful of authors. They represent few\nindependent points of view. But comparative accounts can help put history in\ncontext--some from other times and places, some from contemporary societies\nnearby. We know that kings from 4th-century BCE India, to 3rd-century BCE China,\nto 15th-century CE Mexico and Peru collected hundreds or thousands of women; and\nthat kings from Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Persia did the same in Israel's time (see\non the ancient Near East). In many ways, the Bible reads like history's condensed\nversion. Kings (like Solomon) held onto a thousand women; judges (like Gideon)\nhad dozens; patriarchs (like Abraham) kept three or four; and the poor Israelite took\nwhatever was left.\nWives and Concubines\nIn the beginning, there was Adam--or adam, the Hebrew word for `man.'\nThen of or for Adam, there was `the mother of all living,' Eve (Genesis 3:20; all\nBiblical quotations are from the Revised Standard Version). Cain, who was their\nfirstborn son, knew his wife (of uncertain origin) and fathered Enoch. Then Enoch\nbecame the father of Irad, Irad of Mehujael, Mehujael of Methushael, and Methushael\nof Lamech. `And Lamech took two wives' (Genesis 4:17-19). It had taken seven\ngenerations.\nPatriarchs\nThroughout the first five books of the Old Testament, the sons of Adam\nwander in search of a homeland. And men with bigger herds of sheep and goats tend\nto have sex with more women, then to father more children (see Table 1).\nTerah, who was Abraham's father, was a descendant of Adam and Eve's third\nson, Seth. He was the next patriarch after Lamech who may have married twice. We\nknow that because, at one point, Abraham admits that his wife Sarah is `indeed' his\nsister, `the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother' (Genesis 20:12).\nLike father, like sons. Of Terah's three boys, the first two--Abraham and\nNahor--were polygynous men. Haran, the youngest, died young, having fathered\ntwo daughters and just one son (Genesis 11:27-29). Nahor lived longer, and fathered\nat least 12 sons. Eight belonged to his wife Milcah, who was one of Haran's\ndaughters; and four belonged to Reumah, his concubine (Genesis 22:20-24).\nAbraham, Terah's eldest, married his half-sister Sarah as a relatively young\nman. But when he was 86, Sarah was still childless. So she took compassion on her\nhusband, and told him to try his luck with Hagar--her Egyptian maid. `The Lord has\nprevented me from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that I shall obtain\nchildren by her,' she said. He did; and Ishmael, `a wild ass of a man,' was born\n(Genesis 16:2, 12). Soon after that, Sarah conceived her son Isaac. Then much later,\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nhaving lost Sarah at the advanced age of 137, Abraham married again. Her name was\nKeturah; and she gave him another six sons. But like good patriarchs ever since, he\nfavored his first wife's firstborn boy. He left `all he had' to Isaac--Sarah's only son\nSarah's son Isaac took just one wife. He picked Rebekah, his father's\nbrothers' daughter. And she bore Esau and Jacob, twin sons. Both were polygamous\nmen.\nEsau had children by all three of his wives. Adah, Oholibamah and Mahalath\nJacob had children by four women. When his father sent him down to\nPaddan-aram as a young man, he found `beautiful and lovely' Rachel herding her\nfather's sheep. He liked what he saw, so he kissed her right way `and wept aloud'\n(Genesis 29:11, 17). Then he worked hard for seven years to get her--but ended up\nwith her weak-eyed older sister Leah instead; so he worked hard for another seven\nyears--and won the woman he loved. But Rachel, like Sarah, was infertile at first,\nand told Jacob to have a go at Bilhah, her maid. `Go in to her, that she may bear upon\nmy knees, and even I may have children through her,' she said (Genesis 30:3). Leah\nlater made the same arrangement with her servant, Zilpah. So of Israel's (`Your\nname shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and\nwith men') 12 sons: six were Leah's (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and\nZebulun); two were Rachel's (Joseph and Benjamin); two were Bilhah's (Dan and\nJoseph, the son Jacob loved `more than any other,' led his family into Egypt,\nout of a famine in Canaan (Genesis 37:3). They stayed for 430 years, till Moses led\nthem back out (Exodus 12:40). In the meantime, they bred. When they went in, `all\nthe offspring of Jacob were seventy persons'--sons and daughters, granddaughters\nand grandsons (Exodus 1:5, Genesis 46:27). When they left, god ordered a census,\nwere fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong; so\nthat the land was filled with them' (Exodus 1:7).\nJudges\nAfter they got back to Canaan, `then the Lord raised up Judges' (Judges 2:16).\nThey were more powerful, and more polygynous, than the patriarchs had been. Most\npatriarchs counted their sons in single digits; most judges counted an order of\nmagnitude more. Gideon--who led an army of 32,000--had `seventy sons, his own\noffspring, for he had many wives,' plus at least one son by a concubine (Judges 8:30-\n31). He was followed by Jair, whose 30 sons `rode on thirty asses;' then by Ibzan,\ngrandsons (Judges 10:4, 12: 9, 14). Samson came next, `and the Lord blessed him'\n(Judges 13:24)--but we don't know how much.\nUnder the patriarchs, and under the judges, `every man did what was right in\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nhis own eyes' (Judges 21:25). That was about to change. Even in the desert, Moses\nwarned his followers about kings. When they got back to Canaan, he knew they'd\nwant one of their own, since `all the other nations' around the Mediterranean had\nthem. But they should watch what they wished for. A good ruler `must not multiply\nhorses for himself,' or `greatly multiply for himself silver and gold.' Most of all, `he\nshall not multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away' (Deuteronomy 17: 14,\nGideon's son Abimelech didn't mind calling himself `son of a king.' But his\nbrother, Jotham, thought they'd be better off without one. So he came up with a\nparable about how `the trees once went forth to anoint a king over them,' but the good\nones--fruit-bearing figs, spirit-uplifting grapevines, and honorable olives--declined.\nOnly the thorny, prolific bramble was willing (Judges 9:8). That didn't stop people\nfrom clamoring.\nRoughly 10 judges after Gideon, people asked Samuel--who'd `judged Israel\nall the days of his life'--again for a king (1 Samuel 7:15). But Samuel was a son of a\npolygamist himself, the half-brother of boys who `lay with the women who served at\nthe entrance to the tent of meeting' (1 Samuel 1:1-2, 2:22). So he knew what they'd\nbe up against. He warned them, even more ominously than Moses or Jotham had.\n`These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you,' he said.\nHe will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his\nhorsemen, and to run before his chariots; and he will appoint for\nhimself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and\nsome to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his\nimplements of war and the equipment of his chariots. He will take\nyour daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the\nbest of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to\nhis servants. He will take the tenth of your grain and of your\nvineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. He will take\nyour menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle and\nyour asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your\nflocks, and you shall be his slaves. And in that day you will cry out\nbecause of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the\nLord will not answer you in that day (1 Samuel 8: 10-18; compare\nBut Samuel did as he was told. He picked the son of a rich Benjaminite, a\ngood-looking man and a good fighter, Saul. `Behold, I have harkened to your voice\nin all that you have said to me, and have made a king over you,' he said. And the\npeople answered, `Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, that we may not die;\nfor we have added to our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king' (1 Samuel 12:1,\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nKings\nSaul had an armor bearer, a beautiful lyre player, the youngest son of Jesse the\nJudean, who `found favor' in his sight (1 Samuel 16:22). David leveled the Philistine\nGoliath, `whose height was six cubits and a span,' with a stone (1 Samuel 17:4).\nThen as the army was coming home, women came out of the cities and sang, `Saul\nhas slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' That was the kiss of death:\nSaul `eyed David from that day on' (1 Samuel 18:6-9). Worse, he hunted him. So\nDavid raised a protection racket in the wilderness with a few hundred other men `in\ndistress' (1 Samuel 22: 2); then he made himself a mercenary in the Philistines' pay.\nThey made David king of Judah, and a long war followed. In time, `David grew\nstronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker' (2 Samuel\n3:1). In the end, Saul's house was pretty much wiped out (2 Samuel 21:7-9).\nBut David's proliferated. Even before he became king, David took a few\nwives. There were Ahinoam, Abigail, and Michal--a daughter of Saul; there were\nMaacah (the king of Geshur's daughter), Haggith, Abital and Eglah (1 Samuel 25:42-\n43; 2 Samuel 3:2-5). Then after he became king, David took a few more. He\nassembled `more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron'\n(2 Samuel 5:13). Just one (Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon) is named; and nobody\nbothered to count the rest. But when Maacah's son Absalom made a bid for the\nthrone, David went away and left `ten concubines' behind (2 Samuel 15:16).\n14:3-7). The Bible names Amnon, Chileab (or Daniel), Absalom, Adonijah,\nShephatiah, Ithream, Shammua (or Shimea), Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar,\nElishua (or Elishama), Eliphelet (or Elpelet), Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama,\nEliada (or Beeliada), another Eliphelet, and Tamar--his `virgin' daughter, who gets\nmentioned because she's molested by one of her half-brothers (2 Samuel 13). But\nthere were probably others. David lived in an ivory palace, wrapped in aloe and\ncassia scented robes, entertained by stringed instruments, surrounded by `ladies of\nhonor' and `virgin companions' (Psalms 45:9, 14). He didn't mind uncovering\nhimself in front of those women, `as one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers\nhimself!' (2 Samuel 6:20). And he was provided with girls till the day he died.\nWhen David was 70 years old, his servants searched for a beautiful virgin to be his\nnurse, and told him, `Let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may be warm.'\nThey delivered Abishag, but `the king knew her not' (1 Kings 1:1-4).\nDavid worked hard all his life to extend his kingdom--from Egypt's wadi El\nArish in the west, to the Euphrates in the east (Genesis 15:18, 2 Samuel 8, 1 Kings\n4:21, 2 Chronicles 9:26). His son Solomon lived off the fruits of that work. He put\nup a Hall of Pillars, a Hall of the Throne, a House of the Forest of Lebanon, and a\nhouse of his own--on hewn stone foundations, supported by cedar pillars and beams,\nThen he filled his palace with women. Solomon took one wife--a daughter of\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nPharaoh's, who got her own house--from Egypt; and he took 699 more from other\nparts of his empire. There were Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and\nHittites, `seven hundred wives, princesses' in all, `far more precious than jewels.'\nSoon after that, the united kingdom fell apart. Solomon's labor officer,\nJeroboam, ruled northern Israel from a new capital at Shechem--moved later to\nTirzah, then Penuel, then eventually to Samaria. And Solomon's son, Rehoboam,\nruled Judah in the south from Jerusalem. `And there was war between Rehoboam and\nJeroboam continually' (1 Kings 14:30). Dynasties in Judah were relatively stable:\nmost kings left their thrones to a son. Israel's dynasties turned over faster: all but two\nended after the reigns of just one or two kings (Baron, 1952). But both kingdoms\nwere left with fewer subjects; and royal households shrank. In Judah, Rehoboam had\nprovisions' and wives of their own; his son Abijah had 14 wives, 16 daughters and 22\nJehoiada, who bore `sons and daughters;' but half a century earlier Ahab, who made\nJezebel his queen, had `seventy sons in Samaria' alone (2 Kings 10:1, 7; 2 Chronicles\nHaving a harem was what being a king was about. God made that perfectly\nclear to David, when he put these words in his prophet's mouth: `I anointed you king\nover Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul; and I gave you your master's\nhouse, and your master's wives into your bosom.' They amounted to the same thing.\nIf David wasn't obedient, his lord would undo all that. `I will take your wives before\nyour eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the\nSoon after Solomon became king, his older brother, Adonijah, asked\nSolomon's mother Bathsheba for a favor. He wanted to marry Abishag, David's\nShunammite nurse. `You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully\nexpected me to reign; however the kingdom has turned about and become my\nbrother's, for it was his from the Lord,' he said. Bathsheba thought that wasn't too\nmuch to ask; but Solomon swore the request would `cost Adonijah his life!' (1 Kings\nHis brother Absalom had already met that fate. He was a beautiful boy (`in all\nIsrael there was no one so much praised for his beauty as Absalom'), and people were\nfond of him (`Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel'). So he raised an\ninsurrection against David, and `went in to his father's concubines.' That got him\nhung in an oak, with three darts in his chest (2 Samuel 14-18). The concubines in\nquestion were put under house arrest, and `shut up until the day of their death' (2\nThe tradition was older than that. Shortly before David became king in Judah,\nSaul's son Ishbosheth became Israel's king. And Abner, his general, took liberties\nwith Rizpah, one of Saul's concubines. Abner thought he was owed that much: `Am\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nI a dog's head?' he asked. `I keep showing loyalty to the house of Saul your father,\nto his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the house of David;\nand yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.' But Ishbosheth said\nno; so Abner switched his allegiance to Judah (2 Samuel 3:6-8).\nEven Israel's sons coveted their father's women. Reuben--Jacob and Leah's\nfirstborn--is supposed to have lost his inheritance `because he polluted his father's\ncouch' (1 Chronicles 5:1). One day while Jacob was away, Reuben `went and lay\nwith' Bilhah, who was Jacob's concubine, and Rachel's maid (Genesis 35:22). After\nthat, Reuben's place in the genealogy was reassigned: `his birthright belonged to\nJoseph' from then on (1 Chronicles 5:2).\nOther Men's Women\nWhen Israel and Judah were weak, foreign kings stole Hebrew women. But\nwhen Israel and Judah were strong, Hebrew kings took wives from their subjects.\nHebrew Women and Hebrew Kings\nEven in the early days, while he was still running from Saul, David's band of\n600 discontented debtors tried to extort cattle from Nabal, a rich sheepherder in\nCarmel. Nabal was `churlish and ill-behaved' about that; but his wife Abigail, a\nwoman `of good understanding and beautiful,' showed up with armloads of bread,\nwine, mutton and dried fruit. When she told her husband about it the next morning,\n`his heart died within him;' so David wooed Abigail, and made her his own wife.\nShe came `mounted on an ass, and her five maidens attended her' (1 Samuel 25:3-39,\nThen late one afternoon after he became king, David was out walking on the\nroof of his house when he caught a glimpse of Uriah the Hittite's `very beautiful'\nwife. He sent messengers, who brought her to the palace; then he took her to bed,\n`and the woman conceived.' David sent Uriah off to die on the front, and married the\nHebrew Women and Foreign Kings\nBefore David, Hebrew women were preyed on by foreign kings. One day\nwhen Abraham was 65, and Sarah was 10 years younger, they went out of Canaan to\navoid a famine. But her husband warned, `I know that you are a woman beautiful to\nbehold; and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, \"This is his wife;\" then they\nwill kill me, but they will let you live.' He was partly right. When Egypt's princes\nsaw Sarah, they let pharaoh know she looked good, and she was `taken into Pharaoh's\nhouse.' But Abraham got away with his life. He said Sarah was his sister, so\npharaoh `dealt well' with him: sheep, oxen, camels, he-asses, she-asses, menservants\nand maidservants were delivered to Abraham (Genesis 12:10-16).\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nThen it was the Philistines' turn. When Abraham was 99, and Sarah was still\n10 years younger, they `sojourned' in Gerar--where the king `sent and took her.' But\nby the Philistines, as by the Egyptians, Abraham was enriched--with a thousand\npieces of silver, sheep, oxen, male and female chattels. Then he got his wife back.\nFor which Abraham's god did the king of Gerar a favor. He `healed his wife and\nfemale slaves,' whose wombs he'd shut up on Sarah's account (Genesis 20:2-18). A\nlittle later, Abraham's son Isaac took his own wife Rebekah to Gerar. Like his father,\nhe told the locals `she is my sister'--being afraid to call her his wife, thinking they'd\nkill him `because she was fair to look upon.' But the Philistine king found out the\ntruth, and told his subjects, `whoever touches this man or his wife shall be put to\nAfter David's kingdom was divided, the same things happened. In the 9th\ncentury, Benhadad of Damascus tried, but failed, to take Ahab of Israel's `fairest\nwives and children' away (1 Kings 20:3-7). Arabs invaded Judah soon after, and\nbrought Jehoram's `sons and his wives' out of Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 21:17).\nThe Assyrian king Sennacherib laid siege to 46 cities in Judah in 701, and\nlocked up Hezekiah `like a bird in a cage' in (Ursalimmu) Jerusalem. So Hezekiah\nstripped metals off temple doorposts, sent 300 (or 800) talents of silver plus 30 talents\nof gold, and threw in `his daughters, his harem, his male and female musicians' (2\nKings 18:14-16; Sennacherib, Annals, Third Campaign). Not for the last time.\nIn 597, when Nebuchadnezzar II deported Judah's Jehoiachin, `the king's\nmother, the king's wives, his officials, and the chief men of the land, he took into\ncaptivity from Jerusalem to Babylon'--where he fed his sons on oil rations (2 Kings\n24:15; Nebuchadnezzar II, Administrative Documents).\nSlaves\nWives made a man's heirs; other women made bastards (e.g., Westermarck,\n1921). Sarah and Isaac got singled out for special treatment by Abraham; Bathsheba\nwas favored by David, pharaoh's daughter by Solomon, Jezebel by Ahab. Rehoboam\nloved Maccah, the daughter of Absalom, `above all his wives and concubines;' and he\nmade Maacah's son Abijah `chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make\nhim king' (2 Chronicles 11:21-22). A shegal, or `royal consort,' stood at the king's\n`right hand' in the Psalms (Psalms 45:9). Her sons and the rest of the `king's sons,'\nBut powerful men collected other women, and fathered their children. They\ncollected concubines; they collected servants; and they collected slaves.\nIn the Old Testament, as all over the ancient Near East, there were at least six\nways to get slaves: by capture, as tribute, by purchase, by marriage, to fill a legal\nobligation, and by reproduction (see Mendelsson, 1949). In some cases, slave men\nwere the fathers of yel\u00eed\u00ea bayth--the homeborn slaves brought up in their master's\nhouses. In other cases, masters fathered yel\u00eed\u00ea bayth themselves, and so did their\nsons.\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nBy Purchase\nSlaves could be bought and sold--even Hebrew slaves. Foreign slaves didn't\nhave to be freed. In Moses' words, `You may bequeath them to your sons after you,\nto inherit as a possession for ever' (Leviticus 25:46). But his lord told Moses, `When\nyou buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out\nfree, for nothing' (Exodus 21:2). Hebrew women, like Hebrew men, were to be\noffered their freedom after six years; and they were not to be sent home empty\nhanded. They should be liberally furnished `out of your flock, out of your threshing\nfloor, and out of your wine press' (Deuteronomy 15:12-17). Though it didn't always\nwork out that way. When Zedekiah ruled Judah, the prophet Jeremiah knew Hebrew\nslaves who'd served their six years, but hadn't been freed. He said to let them go--or\n`behold, I proclaim to you liberty by the sword' (Jeremiah 34:17).\nBy Capture\nOther slaves were spoils of war. On their way out of Egypt, when they fought\nagainst the Midianites east of the Sinai, the people of Israel `slew every male' but\n`took captive the women of Midian and their little ones.' Then they brought the\ncaptives to Moses.1 He said it would be better to kill the grown women, and save just\n`the young girls who have not known man by lying with him.' So 32,000 Midian\nvirgins got Hebrew husbands (Numbers 31: 15-35). Even before they left Canaan,\nJacob's daughter Dinah got raped by a Hivite prince, and her brothers obliterated the\nHivite males, but saved `all their little ones, and their wives' (Genesis 34:29). Then\nafter they'd resettled in Canaan, Jacob's son Benjamin's descendants went looking\nfor girls in Jabeshgilead, and destroyed every man and every woman who'd `lain with\nGod handed Moses two different laws about spoils. One was for wars with\nclose neighbors; the other was for more remote wars. When their enemies lived far\naway, he said, `you shall put all the males to the sword, but the women and the little\nones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty for\nyourselves.' But when their enemies lived nearby, `you shall save alive nothing that\nbreathes, but you shall utterly destroy them.' Land was the limiting factor\nSo after Joshua crossed the Jordan and set siege to Jericho, he had everybody\nkilled--`both men and women, young and old' (Joshua 6:21). Then at Ai, Makkedah,\nLibnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, Debir and Hazor, everybody was `exterminated, as\nthe Lord commanded Moses;' they `utterly destroyed all that breathed' (Joshua 9:2,\nboth man and woman, infant and suckling.' And when David raided the Amalekites,\nGeshurites and Girzites, `inhabitants of the land from old,' he left `neither man nor\nSometimes, Hebrew women were taken captive. Even before the exodus,\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nEgypt's Thutmose III raided Canaan and took `340 living prisoners.' Then on their\nway back to Canaan, Hebrew men were afraid that `our wives and our little ones will\nbecome a prey' (Thutmose III, Annals in Karnak, Year 23; Numbers 14:3).\nThat happened even under the kings. Before he ruled Judah, David's wives\nAbigail and Ahinoam were abducted in an Amalekite raid--along with everybody\nmiddle of the 8th century BCE, the Assyrian Tiglath-Pileser III led `all its inhabitants\nand their possessions' out of Israel, or B\u00eet Humria, or `Omri-Land.' Syrian raiders\ntook a `little maid from the land of Israel' under Ahab, Omri's son; and Shalmaneser\nV, Tiglath-Pileser III's son, `carried the Israelites away' in 721 (Tiglath-Pileser III,\nAnnals, Fragment from Year Unknown; 2 Kings 5:2, 17:6). When Nebuchadnezzar II\ninvaded in 597, he `carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty\nmen of valor, ten thousand captives.' Then 11 years later, he came again and `took\ninto exile in Babylon all who had escaped from the sword, and they became servants\neunuch, Ashpenaz, picked out `youths without blemish,' like Daniel, and made them\nProphets like Jeremiah knew that would happen. `Virgins are ravished in\nZion, virgins in the towns of Judah,' he'd imagined; `all your wives and your sons\nshall be led out to the Chaldeans' (Lamentations 5:11, Jeremiah 38:23). Later, Isaiah\nprayed for revenge. Someday, they'd `take captive those who were their captors;'\ntheir enemies' `infants will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be\nplundered and their wives ravished' (Isaiah 13:16, 14:2). Or in the words of a Psalm:\n`Despoiled daughter of Babylon, happy is he who pays you back! Happy is he who\ntakes hold and smashes your suckling babies against a rock' (Psalm 137:8-9).\nBy Tribute\nAfter a battle was over, slaves could be drawn from the conquered. When\nDavid defeated Moab, `the Moabites became servants to David;' then after he'd killed\n22,000 Syrians on the battlefield, `the Syrians became servants to David;' then after\nhe'd put garrisons in Edom, where he'd slain `every male,' the Edomites `became\nDavid's servants;' then after he'd ravaged the Ammonites, `he brought forth the\nPerizzites, Hivites and Jebsites, `whom the people of Israel were unable to destroy\nutterly,' he `made a forced levy of slaves, and so they are to this day' (1 Kings 9:21).\nLater the tables were turned. After Assyria's conquest in 721, Sargon II took\nyoung and old, males and females he `counted as booty' in 701 (Sargon II, Annals of\nKhorsabad, Year 1; Sennacherib, Annals, Third Campaign). In the first 23 the years\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nSome were probably girls. Even before Jacob's descendants were out of\nEgypt, New Kingdom pharaohs sent letters to the Canaanite prince of Gezer, asking\nfor shipments of `beautiful women, in whom there is no defect' (Amarna Letters, EA\n69). Six centuries later, the Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II, his son,\nhad wives--and probably other women--with Hebrew names (see Dalley, 2004).\nThen in the 5th century BCE, the Persian ruler Ahasuerus (probably Xerxes I) issued\nan order to `let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.' So Esther the\nJewess, among others, got basted for six months with myrrh and another six months\nwith spices, then herded into the palace. `In the evening she went, and in the morning\nshe came back to the second harem in custody of Sha-ash'gaz the king's eunuch who\nwas in charge of the concubines.' She wasn't asked to go back to the king again,\nunless `he delighted in her and she was summoned by name' (Esther 2:2, 12-14).\nBy Legal Obligation\nPeople could be enslaved for theft. Joseph `yearned' for his brother\nBenjamin, his mother Rachel's son; so he kept him in Egypt by hiding a cup in his\nsack, then accusing him of stealing it. Joseph had his steward chase Benjamin down\nand say, `he with whom it is found shall be my slave' (Genesis 43:30, 44:9).\nOthers were enslaved for debt. When Ahab's son Jehoram ruled Israel, a\nwoman complained `the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves;'\nand when Nehemiah returned from Babylon, people were upset that their `Jewish\nbrethren' were exacting interest at high rates, and `forcing our sons and our daughters\nto be slaves' (2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:1, 5). That wasn't supposed to happen. His\nlord said to Moses on Mt Sinai, `If your brother becomes poor beside you, and sells\nhimself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: he shall be with you as a\nhired servant and as a sojourner.' A Hebrew was to serve till the jubilee, every\n`seven times seven years,' then be set free with his family (Leviticus 25:8, 39-40).\nBy Marriage\nSome brides came with entourages. When Rebekah married Isaac, her maids\ncame along: they `rode upon the camels, and followed the man' (Genesis 24:61).\nSarah, Rachel and Leah all came with one or more servants; and when David married\nAbigail, she came with five. In the Psalms--73 of which are attributed to David--a\nwife is delivered to the king, along with `her virgin companions, her escort, in her\ntrain' (Psalms 45:14). And in Solomon's Song, `maidens without number' come\nalong with a new bride--whose `hair is like a flock of goats, moving down the slopes\nof Gilead' (Song of Solomon 6:5-8).\nBy Reproduction\nWhen Abraham was 99 years old, his god appeared and said, `This is my\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\ncovenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you:\nEvery male among you shall be circumcised.' All boys over eight days old were to\nhave their foreskins removed: `every male throughout your generations, whether born\nin your house, or bought with your money from any foreigners who is not of your\noffspring.' So Abraham had them all operated on. They were a big crowd. It isn't\nclear how many slaves Abraham had bought, but at least 318 male slaves had been\n500 yoke of oxen, 500 she-asses, and `very many slaves' (Job 1:3). Jacob, having\ntended Laban's herds for 14 years, `grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks,\nmaidservants and menservants, and camels and asses' (Genesis 30:43).\nIf patriarchs like Abraham numbered their yel\u00eed\u00ea bayth in the hundreds, judges\nand kings must have numbered more. Solomon said he'd `bought male and female\nslaves, and had slaves who were born in my house' (Ecclesiastes 2:7). Otherwise, we\nknow only that households were large. Gideon took along `ten men of his servants'\nto help wreck a rival god's altar; and Ziba, a servant of Saul's, had 15 sons `and\nofficers' numbered 250; and Ahab's son Ahaziah numbered his `servants' in\ncompanies of 50. Nehemiah, who brought 7,337 `menservants and maidservants'\nback from Babylon, fed 150 `Jews and officials' at his table (2 Chronicles 8:10; 2\nIt was taken for granted that `a man lies carnally with a woman who is a\nslave.' Moses said that a slave girl who didn't `delight' her master could be\ndesignated for his son--or had to be set free. If she was kept, she had to be taken\ncare of. Even if her master took a wife, `he shall not diminish her food, her clothing,\nHer children were looked after, too. Slaves `born in the house' shared a\nfamily's food, even its Passover foods (Leviticus 22:10-12). They shared the\n`everlasting covenant' with god, by having their foreskins removed (Genesis 17:7-\n27). And some yel\u00eed\u00ea bayth became their masters' heirs. As Abraham complained to\nhis god before Sarah conceived, `Behold, thou hast given me no offspring; and a\nslave born in my house will be my heir' (Genesis 15:3). Some must have been\nnatural daughters and sons.\nConclusion: God's Covenant with Abraham\nGod's mandate is laid down in Genesis 1. He tells Adam and Eve to `Be\nfruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish\nof the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon\nNine generations after Adam, just after the flood, god tells Noah to `be fruitful\nEleven generations after Noah, 10 generations after Noah's son Shem, he says\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\nit again to Abraham--10 times (see Table 2). Abraham's seed will be like the dust of\nthe earth, the sands of the sea, the stars of heaven: `I will make my covenant between\nme and you, and will multiply you' (Genesis 17:2-3). God says the same thing to\nAbraham's sons. `I will multiply your descendants,' he tells Isaac; and Isaac's son,\nJacob, 'shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the\nsouth;' he'll become ` a great nation;' and `kings shall spring' from him (Genesis\nMoses passes that on--seven times. He tells the Israelites their god `will love\nyou, bless you, and multiply you;' that `there shall not be male or female barren\namong you, or among your cattle' (Deuteronomy 7:13-14).\nThen after Moses' five books, the mandate stops. The patriarchs are followed\nby judges, and the judges by kings. Neither needed be told to breed. But fertility\nremained a reward for keeping faith.\nPatriarchs who lost faith were infertile. God told Moses what would happen if\nhis commandments were disobeyed: `You shall sow your seed in vain, for your\nenemies shall eat it' (Leviticus 26:16, 29). Covenant breakers would be punished--\nwith confusion, frustration, heat, drought, inflammation, consumption, fever, plague,\nmadness, blindness, terror, wild beasts, war and pestilence. Their cities would be laid\nwaste, their lands desolate. In short, `as the Lord took delight in doing you good and\nmultiplying you, so the Lord will take delight in bringing ruin upon you and\nJudges who lost faith lost their independence. After Joshua died, people\nworshiped other gods; `so the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he\ngave them over to plunderers' (Judges 2:14). Wars were lost to Mesopotamians,\nMoabites, Canaanites and Midianites: `Go and cry to the gods whom you have\nchosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress,' god said (Judges 10:14).\nFor 18 years, Israel was `crushed and oppressed' by the Ammonites; for another 40\nyears, they laid under the Philistines' hand (Judges 10:8; 13:1). Then a good judge\nlike Samuel came along, and the countryside was `restored to Israel' (1 Samuel 7:14).\nKings who lost faith lost their kingdoms. David--who had `the Spirit of the\nLord' with him--was spared the afflictions of `violent men.' He remembered god's\npromise to make the people of Israel `as many as the stars of heaven' (1 Samuel\n`beloved of the lord'--knew `the fruit of the womb' was a reward, and that a man\nwas glad when his wife was `a fruitful vine,' and he had a `quiver full' of sons. But\nthe foreign women he loved `turned away his heart;' so the lord raised up adversaries\n`bound him in prison' (2 Kings 17:4). Then Zedekiah of Judah displeased his god, so\nthey `slew his sons before his eyes,' then `bound him in fetters, and took him to\nAfter the land was lost, there was remorse. The prophets understood the cost\nof losing faith. When the Assyrians took Israel, Hosea warned, `No birth, no\nPolitics as Sex: The Old Testament Case\npregnancy, no conception! Even if they bring up children, I will bereave them'\n(Hosea 9:11-12). Then after the Babylonians took Judah, Nehemiah remembered,\n`Thou didst multiply their descendants as the stars of heaven, and thou didst bring\nthem into the land which thou hadst told their fathers to enter and possess' (Nehemiah\n9:23). Then they stiffened their necks.\nBut they never lost hope. Prophets like Ezekiel, in the Babylonian exile,\nbelieved god when he said that `the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places\nrebuilt; and I will multiply upon you man and beast' (Ezekiel 36:10-11). So did\nJeremiah, who'd seen Jerusalem destroyed, but heard `I will gather the remnant of my\nflock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to\ntheir fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply' (Jeremiah 23:3). Isaiah had\nsurvived Samaria's demise, but believed. `In days to come Jacob shall take root,\nIsrael shall blossom and put forth shoots, and fill the whole world with fruit' (Isaiah\n"
