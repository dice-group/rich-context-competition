This study aimed to evaluate the effects of candesartan, an angiotensin\nII receptor blocker, on cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity basally as well as after surgical stress under general anesthesia.\nMaterials and methods: Male Wistar rats were treated with 5 mg/kg/day candesartan in their drinking water for two\nweeks. Levels of cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity were determined, using a kinase activity assay, basally and after surgi-\ncal stress under general anesthesia.\nResults: Chronic administration of candesartan increased hepatic AMPK activity approximately 4 times (p<0.05) while\nno significant change was demonstrated in cardiac AMPK. Cardiac and hepatic AMPK activities were not significantly\nincreased by surgical stress alone performed under anesthesia. However, chronic treatment with candesartan decreased\nAMPK activity in both liver and heart after surgical stress under anesthesia (p<0.01 for both comparisons).\nConclusions: While chronic candesartan treatment may stimulate AMPK activity in certain organs such as the liver,\nwhen combined with surgical stress under anesthesia it inhibits pathways regulating AMPK activity.\n",

However, it is necessary to clarify the tissue-spe-\ncific and stress-specific activation mechanism of AMPK\nactivation.6\nIt has been suggested that the renin-angiotensin system\nmay play a significant role in regulating the AMPK system.7\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered to\nplay a protective cardiovascular role through blood pressure\nlowering and beyond.8,9 Indeed, the use of ARBs in\nThe effects of chronic candesartan\ntreatment on cardiac and hepatic\nadenosine monophosphate-activated\nprotein kinase in rats submitted to\nsurgical stress\nAnt\u00f4nio Ribeiro-Oliveira Jr1*, Mirna B Marques1,2*, Walkiria W\nVilas-Boas3, Jonas Guimar\u00e3es1, C\u00e2ndido C Coimbra4, Allan P\nAnjos1, Rodrigo B F\u00f3scolo1, Robson Santos4, Julia D Thomas2,\nSuzana M Igreja2, Blerina Kola2, Ashley B Grossman2,5 and M\u00e1rta\nKorbonits2\n Keywords\nAMP-activated protein kinase, angiotensin receptor blocker, candesartan, stress, surgery\n1Department of Internal Medicine,Federal University of Minas Gerais,Brazil\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Queen Mary University of London, UK\n3Department of Surgery, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil\nDepartment of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas\nGerais, Brazil\nOxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University\nof Oxford, UK\n*These two authors contributed equally to the manuscript.\nCorresponding author:\nM\u00e1rta Korbonits, Department of Endocrinology, Barts and the London\nSchool of Medicine, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6QB, UK.\nEmail: m.korbonits@qmul.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\n482 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nperioperative medicine has increased,10 although the role of\nthese agents in surgical practice has not been fully eluci-\ndated. While AMPK has been extensively studied in terms\nof its response to metabolic fuel deprivation,11 very few\nstudies are available on the in vivo modifications of AMPK\nresponses to such a common stress scenario as laparotomy.\nWe have recently shown that basal hypothalamic AMPK is\nupregulated by theARB candesartan, although it was dimin-\nished in candesartan-treated animals submitted to surgical\nstress under anesthesia.12\nWe have therefore sought to evaluate cardiac and hepatic\nAMPK activities under basal conditions and in response to\nthe surgical stress of laparotomy in anesthetized rats chron-\nically treated with candesartan in order to assess the pattern\nof AMPK activity response in the heart and the liver.\nMaterial and methods\nAnimals\nMale Wistar rats of 7\u00ad9 weeks of age (provided by the\nFederal University of Minas Gerais Medical SchoolAnimal\nFacility) were maintained under temperature-controlled\n\u00b0C) with an artificial 12-hour light-dark\nard chow and water ad libitum. Rats were housed in indi-\nvidual cages and were handled daily.\nA total of 28 animals were treated either with candesar-\ntan cilexetil (AstraZeneca, Cotia, Brazil) 5 mg/kg/day in\nthe drinking water for two weeks (n=14) or no additions\n(vehicle, n=14) for the same period in their drinking water\nfor two weeks utilizing metered drinking bottles with air-\nholes according to a well-established protocol13,14 for glu-\ncose and AMPK measurements. The University Ethics\nCommittee for Animal Experimentation approved all pro-\nExperimental design\nFollowing the two-week treatment with candesartan, rats\nwere transferred in the early morning on the day of the\nexperiment to the temperature-controlled experimental\nroom and were left to rest for 60 min in their home cages.\nNoise was kept at a minimum. Experiments were performed\nor food during the experiments.\nExperiment animals were then anesthetized with 0.075\nmg/g intraperitoneal ketamine (Crist\u00e1lia, Itapira, Brazil)\nand 0.01 mg/g xylazine (Schering-Plough Coopers, Cotia,\nBrazil) according to the protocol of the local Ethics\nCommittee for Animal Research. This drug combination\nwas suggested by the local Ethics Committee to induce a\nnon-inhaled general anesthesia. After an average of 5 min,\nwhen rats were deeply anesthetized, a median laparotomy\nwas performed, followed by evisceration and exposure of\nthe bowels for 20 min15 with exposed tissues kept warm\nand moist.\nNon-stressed animals and those after 20 min of stress\nwere moved to an adjacent room where they were killed by\ndecapitation without anesthesia, followed by immediate\nremoval of liver and heart. The organs were then placed in\nliquid nitrogen and stored at \u00ad80\u00b0C. Blood from the trunk\nwas collected in sodium citrate 6% syringes and kept in ice\nstored for subsequent glucose measurements.\nAssays\nThe AMPK activity of the heart and liver tissues were evalu-\nated at both baseline and after 20 min of surgical stress. We\nhave chosen to evaluate AMPK activity after 20 min of stress\nbased on our and others'previous experience showing a stress\npeak, as evaluated by the hyperglycemic response, at around\n20 min.15\u00ad18 Heart and liver of rats were weighed and homog-\nenized with Precellys 24 using CK14 tubes containing\nceramic beads (Stretton Scientific, Stretton, UK) at 3600 g\nfor one cycle of 20 s in lysis buffer containing 50 mM\nTris-HCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1 mM\nEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 250 mM sucrose,\nmidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 5 \u00b5g/ml\nsoybean trypsin inhibitor. Tissue protein content was deter-\nmined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce,\nRockford, USA). AMPK activity was assayed as previously\ndescribed:19 briefly, AMPK was immunoprecipitated with an\nequal mixture of 1AMPK and 2AMPK antibodies,19 and\nAMPK activity was determined by the entity of phosphorylation\nof SAMS (amino acid sequence: HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR,\nPepceuticals Ltd., Nottingham, UK), a synthetic peptide sub-\nstrate of AMPK.19 AMPK activity was calculated using the\ndifference of the counts between SAMS containing and\nSAMS negative samples and expressed as nanomoles of ATP\nincorporated per minute per milligram of sample of peptide.\nThe sensitivity of the AMPK assay was 5 pmol/ATP/min/mg\nprotein with an intra- and inter- assay coefficients of variation\nStatistical analysis\nNon-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test followed by\nConover-Inman comparison) were performed for AMPK\nmeasurements, as these data were not normally distributed\n(Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test). StatsDirect (Addison Wesley\nLongman, Cambridge, UK) and GraphPad Prism4 (San\nDiego, California, USA) were utilized for statistical analy-\nsis. All data are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the\nmean (SEM), and significance was taken at p<0.05.\nResults\nThere was no difference between the two-week fluid intake\nof animals who on the day of the stress tests were assigned\nto stress or to control groups, suggesting that they had\nequal exposure to candesartan. There were no significant dif-\nferences in plasma glucose levels as related to candesartan\ntreatment when compared to respective non-stressed or\nstressed controls, as appropriate. Marked hyperglycemia as\nan index of sympathetic discharge was shown in surgically\nstressed animals utilized in this study.12\nCardiac AMPK\nAfter two weeks of candesartan treatment, there was no sig-\nnificant change in cardiac AMPK activity in candesartan-\ntreated non-stressed rats when compared to the\nvehicle-treated non-stressed controls (Figure 1).\nAfter 20 min of surgical stress under general anesthesia,\nno significant change could be observed in cardiac AMPK\nin the vehicle-treated stressed animals when compared to\nnmol/min/mg). However, there was a significant decrease\nin cardiac AMPK levels in candesartan-treated anesthesia-\nstressed animals when compared to the other groups\ncomparison with candesartan-treated non-stressed animals;\nvehicle-treated non-stressed animals and with no-candesartan\nstressed animals, respectively; Figure 1). These data sug-\ngest that the surgical stress of laparotomy under general\nanesthesia is not associated with a stress-induced increase\nin cardiac AMPK activity. However, the combination of\ncandesartan and laparotomy with anesthesia inhibitsAMPK\nactivity levels.\nHepatic AMPK\nIn the liver, two weeks candesartan treatment increased\nunder general anesthesia, there was a non-significant increase\nin hepatic AMPK in vehicle-treated stressed animals when\nHowever, there was a significant decrease in hepatic\nAMPK activity levels in the candesartan-treated anesthe-\nsia-stressed group when compared to both the candesartan-\nnmol/min/mg, p<0.01, Figure 2) and the vehicle-treated\nmg, p<0.05, Figure 2). These data show that the stress of\nlaparotomy under general anesthesia (surgical stress) does\nnot significantly change hepatic AMPK activity. However,\nwhen the same surgical stress is combined with candesartan\nit restores hepatic AMPK activity to values which are simi-\nlar to non-stressed controls, suggesting that inhibitory\nAMPK pathways are switched on by this stress which can\novercome the effects of candesartan upon hepatic AMPK\nactivity observed on basal values.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that chronic candesar-\ntan treatment stimulates hepatic AMPK activity in non-\nstressed animals. Cardiac AMPK levels are not changed by\nchronic candesartan treatment. We have also shown that\ncardiac and hepatic AMPK are not changed significantly\nby surgical stress under general anesthesia, suggesting that\nthe stress-anesthesia procedure inhibits pathways which\nwe might anticipate should lead to a stress-induced\nincrease in AMPK activity. However, when candesartan\nis combined with anesthesia and surgical stress, other\nmechanisms seems to be switched on: the ARB blocks the\nantiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1)-mediated effects of\nstress-induced angiotensin II release,20 thus preventing\nstress-increases of both cardiac and hepatic AMPK, as\ndemonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells.21\nConsequently, chronic treatment with candesartan in com-\nbination with the inhibitory actions on AMPK of both\nFigure 1.

Several stress stimuli,\nsuch as exercise, anoxia and myocardial ischemia, have\nbeen described as activators of AMPK.22\nThis is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to\nidentify the changes of cardiac and hepatic AMPK in the\nsurgical stress of laparotomy.ARBs are widely used in clin-\nical medicine, but very little is known regarding their\neffects on the AMPK system.23 We have shown here that\ncandesartan significantly increases hepatic AMPK activity\nin non-stressed animals, while surgical stress under anes-\nthesia does not significantly change hepatic or cardiac\nAMPK activity. We have further addressed the in vivo com-\nplex interaction of candesartan, anesthetics and the hyper-\nglycemic response in surgical stress, demonstrating that\nthis combination ultimately shuts down cardiac and hepatic\nAMPK activity levels.\nThe AMPK system plays a major role in the regulation of\nhepatic and lipid metabolism through its acute effects on\nenergy metabolism and long-term effects on gene expression\npattern in the liver.24 Candesartan has been otherwise shown\nto increase the expression of peroxisome proliferator-\nactivated receptor-gamma (PPAR-) and adiponectin,25\nwhich are both known to increase hepatic AMPK activ-\nity.26\u00ad28 Therefore, both PPAR- agonism and the effect on\nadiponectin might have contributed to the observed increase\non basal hepatic AMPK activity.25,29,30 In addition, as cande-\nsartan not only reduces the actions of angiotensin II, but also\nincreases angiotensin-(1\u00ad7), we might also speculate that the\nalternative renin angiotensin system axis formed by angio-\ntensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2)-angiotensin-(1\u00ad7)/\nMas receptor could play a role in hepatic AMPK activation.\nLikewise, we have recently shown that candesartan stimu-\nlates the hypothalamic AMPK system, and others have\nshown that anotherARB, telmisartan, acts on skeletal muscle\nthrough activation of the PPAR/AMPK pathway.23\nActivation of hepatic AMPK causes a switch from an\nanabolic to a catabolic state and entails positive metabolic\nconsequences such as inhibition of hepatic glucose produc-\ntion with restoration of blood glucose levels and regulation\nof cellular lipid metabolism through stimulation of fatty\nFigure 3.

Indeed, our findings of elevated basal\nhepatic AMPK levels in candesartan-treated animals are in\nagreement with possible beneficial effects of ARB on\nmetabolism, pointing to an anti-steatotic effect in the liver.31\nHowever, despite the well-known protective effects of can-\ndesartan in the heart,32 we did not detect in this study a\nsignificant elevation in cardiac AMPK activity of rats\nchronically treated with candesartan. Similarly, a recent\nstudy showed that activation of intrinsic cardiac ACE2 pro-\ntects the heart against diabetes-induced dysfunction with-\nout significant changes in AMPK expression.33\nInterestingly, surgical stress under general anesthesia\ndid not significantly change cardiac and hepatic AMPK\nactivity. Indeed, general anesthesia reduces overall metabo-\nlism sparing AMPK, thus precluding stress-increases of\nAMPK in cardiac and hepatic cells as it turns off regulatory\nAMPK pathways. Likewise, we recently demonstrated the\nabsence of significant changes in AMPK after surgical\nstress under this same anesthetic protocol for hypothalamic\ncells.12 The role of anesthesia is further corroborated by a\nsignificant increase in hypothalamic AMPK activity after\nrestraint, when anesthesia is not utilised.12\nThe 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine utilized in these\nexperiments acts centrally to decrease efferent sympathetic\nactivity and circulating noradrenaline concentrations, thus\npreservingenergyconsumptionintheperiphery.34 Ketamine,\nan N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, has been\nrecently demonstrated to lower brain AMPK activity when\nadministered to rats before ischemia.35 Thus, the anesthetic\ncombination of ketamine and xylazine may have prevented\na significant increase in AMPK due to surgical stress.\nHowever, these data may also be related to the marked\nhyperglycemia evoked by surgical stress under general\nanesthesia, thus reducing AMPK activity.36\nThe role of AT1 receptors in the regulation of stress\nresponses have been previously investigated.20,37,38 The pro-\nduction of circulating and local angiotensin II, as well as the\nexpression of AT1 receptors increase during stress,20 and the\nperipheral administration of an AT1 receptor antagonist oth-\nerwise blocks peripheral and brain AT1 receptors.39\nFurthermore, AT1 receptor mediates nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase activa-\ntion and increases reactive oxygene species (ROS) produc-\ntion,40 which are known to upregulate AMPK.41 Importantly,\nit has been demonstrated that the angiotensin II type I recep-\ntor antagonist valsartan significantly inhibits angiotensin\nII-induced AMPK activation in rat vascular smooth muscle\ncells, strongly suggesting that angiotensin II-induced AMPK\nactivation is specifically AT1 receptor-dependent.21\nFurthermore, these data pointed to an AMPK inhibition\neffect on the proliferation signal induced by angiotensin II.\nIt has previously been demonstrated that the renin-\nangiotensin system is activated in anesthetized, surgically\nstressed rats.42 In this study, candesartan blocked the AT1\nreceptor, thus inhibiting angiotensin-II-induced AMPK acti-\nvation. This effect, in combination with the inhibitory effects\nof anesthetics and stress hyperglycemia, suppresses AMPK\nactivity in the heart and liver (Figure 3). Further studies\nshould address the molecular pathways as well as the signifi-\ncance of these changes. Interestingly, a possible role for angi-\notensin-(1\u00ad7) may also be considered to explain the observed\nchanges in the candesartan-stressed group of animals. Our\npreliminary data, using the same stress protocol in transgenic\nrats over-expressing angiotensin-(1\u00ad7), suggest a reduction\nin hepatic and cardiac AMPK in these stressed rats when\ncompared to the wild type (data not shown).\nWe have not included a group of rats with anesthesia\nalone (without surgery), as we wished to demonstrate the\neffects of combined anesthesia and surgery mirroring a\n`real life' situation. However, as AMPK has been impli-\ncated in a wide range of metabolic pathways, apparent par-\nadoxes and conflicts may be brought about, especially\nwhen utilizing an in vivo model.\nIn summary, this in vivo study shows that candesartan\nstimulates basal hepatic AMPK activity but has no signifi-\ncant effect on heart AMPK activity. It also shows that surgi-\ncal stress under anesthesia is not associated with a\nsignificant increase in cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity.\nFurthermore, and in line with the fairly complex position of\nAMPK as a regulatory system, two weeks' treatment with\ncandesartan down-regulated cardiac and hepatic AMPK\nactivity after surgical stress under anesthesia. These\nchanges may need to be considered in the clinical situation\nwhere ARBs are in widespread use.\nConclusions\nWe show for the first time that chronic treatment with can-\ndesartan increases hepatic AMPK, while the combination\nof candesartan with surgical stress under anesthesia inhibits\npathways regulating AMPK activity, suggesting a role of\ncandesartan in modulating cardiac and hepatic AMPK\nactivity in surgical stress under anesthesia.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial\nsupport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article:This study was supported by the National Council\nof Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq), by the\nFapemig (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para o Desenvolvimento da Pesquisa do\nEstado de Minas Gerais), and by the Wellcome Trust.\nReferences\n1.
