The\ndata reported in this paper were collected as part of the\nStudy on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE), which\nset out to improve knowledge on the health, disability and\nwell-being of older populations in low- and middle-income\ncountries.3 Adult mortality has been increasing in southern\nand eastern countries of sub-Saharan Africa since the\nstudies have focused on young adults, ignoring the\nfact that the older population is also directly and indirectly\naffected by the HIV epidemic.6\u00ad8 Existing data show\nthat one effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is to increase\nthe number of older people living alone.7 However,\nthere has been limited attention in the literature to the\nprevalence of HIV in older people, despite calls to examine\ninfection and mortality in the population aged 50 years\nand older.1,9 Negin et al. have called attention to the\ninterplay between the ageing process and the double bur-\nden of HIV and non-communicable diseases, especially in\nThis paper describes factors associated with mortality\nin people aged 50 years and over in a rural area of South\nAfrica where HIV prevalence is high11 and where gender\ndifferences in experience of quality of life, function and\nhealth have been described.12 The objectives of this paper\nare twofold: first, to describe the mortality trends and iden-\ntify possible HIV-related trends; and second, we aimed to\nidentify the social and functional risks related to increased\nmortality risk in this cohort. In exploring the social and\nfunctional risks, we considered both the well-known and\nfrequently described `distal causes of disease'13 including\neducation, occupation13 and poverty,14 as well as other\nfactors which have been previously associated with higher\nmortality risk in this or similar populations. Union (part-\nnership) status has been related with poor self-reported\nhealth, quality of life and well-being in older people in dif-\nferent African settings.3,15,16 A single question on self-rated\nhealth and the composite measure on functionality (WHO-\nDAS) have been associated with higher risk of mortality in\nIndia17 whereas, in Agincourt HDSS, former Mozambican\nrefugees have been found to suffer higher levels of child\nmortality.18 To further explore the patterns of mortality,\nwe have included information from the site-specific annual\nMethods\nEthical clearance for the MRC/WITS Rural Public Health\nand Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt) and its\nassociated Health and Demographic Surveillance System,\nand for the Agincourt-INDEPTH Study on Global Ageing\nand Adult Health, was granted by the Committee for\nResearch on Human Subjects (Medical) University of\nKey Messages\n\u00b7 Lower quality of life (measured by WHOQOL), lower functionality (measured by WHODAS), lower household assets\nscore and being single are associated with higher mortality levels in this older South African population.\n\u00b7 As in high-income countries, mortality in a poor rural setting presents with the `male-female survival paradox' where\nwomen experience a higher number of risk factors than men but survive longer.\n\u00b7 Mortality due to HIV/TB, especially in men, has increased in recent years, so that mortality is higher in the younger\nold (up to 69 years of age), after which there is an apparent fall in mortality with increasing age.\n\u00b7 In South Africa, policy makers and practitioners should consider the needs of the expanding, but often overlooked,\nolder population.\nthe Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, Refs\nThe study population and general methods have been\ndescribed in detail previously.12 Here, we describe them\nbriefly.\nSetting\nIn 1992, the MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health\nTransitions Research Unit initiated the Agincourt Health\nand Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the rural\nAgincourt sub-district of Ehlanzeni district, Mpumalanga\nProvince, South Africa. The total population under surveil-\nsubstantial socioeconomic development in the area since\nthen, infrastructure remains poor and formal unemploy-\nment rate is high (36%) with continuing high levels of la-\nbour migration among men and, increasingly, women.19\nThe public health system in the sub-district consists of six\nclinics and one health centre, and three district hospitals\n2008 a private health centre was built in one village, in-\ntended mainly for the treatment and care of people with\nHIV. HIV prevalence among all ages from 15 years in the\nover 50 years of age had an HIV prevalence of 16.5%\nBasic demographic data (pregnancy outcome, deaths, mi-\ngration) are collected every year by trained local field-\nworkers, to update HDSS census information.21 Additional\nindividual and household data (food security, labour partici-\npation, household assets) are collected at regular intervals to\nprovide contextual information. Although the surveillance\nsystem includes information on all deaths, there is incom-\nplete official death notification and very few people can re-\nport their relatives' cause of death. To determine cause of\ndeath, we use two independent clinician assessments of ver-\nbal autopsy interviews. Verbal autopsies are carried out by\ntrained lay fieldworkers with closest caregivers of the\ndeceased for every death in the area, allowing us to study\nmortality by likely cause of death.22\nSample\nover enumerated in the Agincourt HDSS. Of those, we\nexcluded 575 who had been randomly selected to partici-\npate in a previous recent study; and those who were tem-\nporary (often labour) migrants (n \u00bc 2223), living for less\nthan 6 months of the year prior to the study in the sub-\ndistrict. The remaining 5631 individuals, who had been\npermanently resident in the area for 12 months prior to the\n2006 census round, were invited to participate. Each per-\nson was visited a maximum of three times to attempt to\ncomplete the interview. Due to the census field constraints,\nwe were not able to follow up any further those individuals\nwho were absent from their households on these three vis-\nalthough they were apparently permanently living in the\nstudy site. A further 458 (8.1%) individuals had died or\nwere too sick to answer the questions, and 47 (0.8%)\ndeclined to take part. A total of 4085 individuals (response\nData collection\nWe used a data collection tool that was adapted from the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) \u00adINDEPTH Network\nStudy on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)23 to\ninterview participants during 2006 census. The SAGE\nquestionnaire included questions on self-rated health as-\nsessment, physical and cognitive function, well-being and\nquality of life. It was translated into the local language\n(Shangaan) and back-translated into English.\nAdditional data on gender, age, whether married or liv-\ning with a partner, nationality, level of education and date\nand cause of death were extracted from the Agincourt\nHDSS (2006 census round). Employment status was indi-\ncated by being in paid work or not.\nWe also used HDSS census data, annually updated from\nthe person-years of observation, and to determine out-\nmigration and death dates.\nFollow-up\nA total of 2006 study participants were followed up at an-\n38 (0.9%) were lost to follow-up with no information and\nhave been excluded from analyses. The 4047 remaining par-\nticipants were followed up until out-migration, death or 31\nJuly 2009, whichever came first. Out-migration was defined\nas an individual moving away from his/her original dwell-\ning. All efforts were made to follow up those who moved\nwithin the sub-district, but those we could not find in a new\n1.4%) were censored at out-migration date. Main reasons\nfor out-migration were moving to new houses, change of\nunion status, or work-related issues.\nVariables\nWe calculated age at interview from recorded date of birth\nand reported age. We assigned participants to 5-year age\ngroups.\nEducation was categorized according to the WHO lev-\nels of education: 6 years or more of formal education; less\nthan 6 years of formal education; and no formal education.\nThis information was obtained from the 2006 Agincourt\nHDSS database.\nSince many unions are traditional rather than civic, and\npolygamy is practised by some people, we decided to cat-\negorize union status into two groups: currently married or\nliving as married (in a current partnership); and single,\nincluding anyone not in a current partnership (i.e. those\nwho had never married or were separated, divorced or\nwidowed).\nTo evaluate socioeconomic status (SES), we used an `ab-\nsolute SES' indicator constructed from the 2005 household\nasset survey. Each asset was given equal weight by rescal-\ning so that all values of a given asset variable fell within\nthe range [0, 1]. Assets were categorized into five broad\ngroups: `modern assets', `power supply', `water and sanita-\ntion', `quality of housing' and `livestock assets'. For each\nhousehold and for each asset group, the asset values were\nadded and then rescaled to arrive at a specific value in the\nrange [0,1]. Finally, for each household these five group-\nspecific scaled values were added to give an overall asset\nscore with a value in the range [0, 5].24\nHousehold asset scores were calculated using 2005 cen-\nsus data, since these were the most recent data available,\nand then grouped in quintiles for the entire Agincourt sub-\ndistrict population. As participants in this study are a sub-\nsample of the whole population (50 years and older), they\nare not equally distributed across the five quintiles.\nDue to the war in Mozambique, the Agincourt area\nreceived a high number of Mozambican refugees before\n1993. Those who elected to remain in the area were re-\ncorded as Mozambican. The variable `nationality of origin'\nrefers to whether the participant was originally from South\nAfrica or Mozambique. The Mozambican group are separ-\nately identified in the HDSS data and differ from the\noriginal South African population in measures such as edu-\ncation, household assets and child mortality.18 Many\nMozambicans have now taken South African nationality\nwhich allows them to work legally and receive state\npensions.\nThe physical and social functions of each participant\nwere measured using the WHODAS II scale (World Health\nOrganization Disability Assessment Schedule II) which\nassesses daily functioning.25 This scale is created by asking\n12 questions on the difficulty experienced when perform-\ning certain activities in past 30 days. The score ranges from\n0 to 100, with a high score indicating severe impairment of\nphysical function. WHOQOL (Word Health Organization\nQuality of Life) was used to measure life satisfaction.\nWHOQOL includes questions on satisfaction with own\nhealth, personal and social relations, performing daily\nactivities and overall satisfaction with life. It is presented\non a scale of 8 to 40 (where 8 is the best quality of\nlife).26,27 We used two single questions to measure self-\nrated health and working difficulty, where we asked the\nparticipants `In general, how would you rate your health\ntoday?' with the options of very good, good, moderate,\nbad and very bad; and `Overall in the last 30 days, how\nmuch difficulty did you have with work or household\nactivities?' with options being none, mild, moderate, severe\nand extreme/cannot do.\nData entry and analysis\nWe entered data using CSPro 3.1 data entry programme\n(http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/cspro/index.html) which\nincludes validation checks. Data were then extracted to\nStata10.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) for\nanalysis.\nDemographic analysis\nA demographic analysis on the full Agincourt HDSS popu-\nthe sample mortality trend by age group was due to a sam-\nple bias or whether it is explained as a new mortality trend\nin the study site--that is, up to cohort recruitment. Hazard\nmortality ratios were computed using number of deaths\nthat occurred within the HDSS as the numerator, and\nlength of time lived in the HDSS over the period as the de-\nnominator, expressed in person-years. Individuals were\nconsidered residents when they spent more than 6 months\nper year in the HDSS area. In order to minimize effects on\nmortality of temporary migrants that return home to die,28\nthe mortality analysis did not included temporary migrants\nwho died outside the HDSS or within 6 months of their re-\nturn to the study site. The analysis of all-cause mortality\nwas conducted by gender, 5-year age-group defined by age\nin August 2006 and 5-year time period. HIV/TB mortality\nwas similarly analysed. This demographic analysis pro-\nvided background mortality trends to compare with results\nfrom the participants in this study.\nCox regression model\nWe carried out a Cox's regression analysis to determine\nthe factors related to the risk of death. We first carried out\nan age-adjusted analysis of the impact of the three compos-\nite measures to evaluate whether gender effects could be\nmerely explained by age differences (Table 2). Then we\nperformed a univariate analysis (Table 3) and then con-\nstructed a multivariate model, including age group (treated\nas a categorical variable), sex, whether in a union, educa-\ntion status and household asset score as a-priori variables.\nWe then entered in turn each of the other variables listed in\nTable 3, where the univariate analysis returned a P-value\nof less than 0.1. In each case, we compared models with\nand without the variable, and discarded the variable if the\nlikelihood ratio test returned a value of P > 0.1. Three\nmodels, for the whole population, for men and for women,\nwere constructed. Proportional analysis was performed\nusing proportion hazard assumption. We performed a test\nof proportionality for each predictor using the Schoenfeld\nand scaled Schoenfeld residuals. If the tests were not sig-\nnificant (P-values > 0.05), proportionality was not rejected\nand we assumed that there was no violation of the propor-\ntional assumption. Once we had constructed the model for\nthe whole population, we further investigated the effect of\nthree groups of causes of death (chronic disease; HIV and\nTB; and other infections) by running the model separately\nfor each of these cause groups.\nResults\ndeaths recorded. Participants were predominantly female\n(75.2%), which represents the demographics of this older\npopulation in the sub-district, with a mean age of 66.1\nyears at the time of interview. Less than half of the popula-\ntion had received any formal education. Men were more\nthan twice as likely to be currently in a union. Most of the\nparticipants were retired and not looking for work, but\n5.7% reported that they were unemployed and looking for\nemployment.12 Most (56%) of the respondents in paid\nwork were aged less than 60. A higher proportion of par-\nticipants than expected, especially men, were living in\nhouseholds with no persons under 50 years of age (9.6%),\nor in a skip generation household (2.4%) where there were\nchildren (under 18 years) present but no adults aged under\nWe calculated death rates in 5-year age cohorts and found\nfell, only finally surpassing the 60\u00ad64 rates in the group\nover 85 years of age (see Supplementary Table 1, available as\nSupplementary data at IJE online). A similar but less marked\npattern was observed in women. When we compared the\nstudy men and women death rates with the Agincourt census\nfound a significant difference between the study [death rate\ngroup 50\u00ad54 years (see Supplementary Table 1, available as\nSupplementary data at IJE online).\nThe relationship between age group and mortality led\nus to analyse mortality data over the entire period of the\nannual Agincourt census, from 1993. In Figure 1 we show\nthe death rates per 1000 person-years for men and women\nDeath rates in the younger men increased in each of the\nperiod. This time period shows a drop in mortality for men\naged 65\u00ad69 after an essentially flat line in the four younger\nage groups. In the final time period the death rates are\nlower, but with a similar pattern. Women showed a similar\nbut less marked pattern.\nIn Figure 2 we show similar graphs for the cause-\nspecific death rates from HIV and TB, as determined by\nverbal autopsy. These rates rose markedly in the men aged\nperiod. Again, women showed a similar but less marked\npattern in HIV/TB death rate. When mortality contribu-\ntion of HIV/TB is calculated as a percentage of all\nin the youngest age group 45\u00ad49 years, HIV/TB contrib-\nutes with 25% of the deaths in men and 50% of the deaths\nin women.\nBecause of this complex relationship between age, gen-\nder and risk of death, age could not be treated as a continu-\nous variable with a linear relationship to survival. We\ntherefore entered age into the Cox regression analysis as a\ncategorical variable in 5-year age groups, allowing an inde-\npendent estimation of risk for each age group.\nThe age-adjusted analysis of the three composite meas-\nurements, i.e. quality of life, functionality and health status,\nshows that gender effects are not the result of age differences\nfor mortality or for composite health outcomes (Table 2).\nTable 3 shows the results for the univariate analysis of\nmortality risk for all demographic and health variables,\nand for the fully adjusted model. In the univariate analysis,\nwomen had lower mortality risks and, as previously\ndescribed, there was a complex relationship with age. Not\nbeing in a current partnership, living in a household of\nlower socioeconomic status and having no formal educa-\ntion were all related to increased mortality. In general,\nolder people living in households with younger adults and/\nor in `skip generation' households have lower mortality.\nThis protective effect remained when the analysis was car-\nried out separately by gender, but only the effect of living\nwith younger adults had confidence intervals below 1.\nPeople who reported that they were suffering moderate or\nbad health and those who reported severe difficulty with\nwork or household duties experienced higher mortality, as\ndid those who reported poor function, low quality of life\nand lowest health status.\nAs described in the methods section above, we con-\nstructed three multivariate Cox regression models: for the\nTable 1.

We retained in the model all variables where the\nlikelihood ratio test returned a value of P > 0.1. The sur-\nvival advantage of women was maintained [HR 0.35) 95%\nhousehold asset score, WHOQOL and WHODAS were re-\ntained in all three models, whereas health status was\ndiscarded.\nIn the fully adjusted model for women, although there\nwas no clear double peak of mortality with age, the mor-\ntality risk was similar for all ages between 50 and 79, sug-\ngesting that the younger age groups were experiencing\nhigher mortality than would be expected. Poor physical\nfunction was associated with a greater risk of dying; those\nwomen reporting the worst function had nearly double the\nrisk of dying compared with those in the highest function\nsocioeconomic status and not being in a current partner-\nship were associated with a higher risk of dying independ-\nently of disability.\nThe fully adjusted model for men shows a clear double\npeak in age-related mortality, with an increased mortality\n85 onwards, the risk of dying was again higher than that in\nWe grouped cause of death into broad categories be-\ncause there were relatively few deaths. These categories\nwere chronic disease (164 deaths), HIV/TB (78 deaths),\nother infections (67 deaths), other causes (20 deaths) and\nunknown (48 deaths). In Table 4 we show the same general\npopulation model for each of the first three of these catego-\nries separately. The model is shown in more detail in\nSupplementary Table 4 (available as Supplementary data\nat IJE online). Whereas the models for chronic diseases\nand other infections show the expected age gradient with\nincreasing risk at older ages, the model for HIV/TB shows\nan inverted relationship with age such that older people\nare at lower risk.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented the results of 3 years of follow-up on\nover 4000 older people living in rural South Africa. We set\nout to describe some of the factors associated with mortal-\nity in a cohort of older people living in an area of rural\nSouth Africa with high HIV prevalence. One of the\nstrengths of this study is that it is based in a sub-district\nthat is covered by a health and demographic surveillance\nsystem, where the population has been followed for 18\nyears and there is access to high-quality mortality and\nMales\nAge groups\nFemales\nAge groups\nFigure 2. HIV/TB death rates by gender, age group and time period\nMales\nFemales\nAge groups\nAge groups\nFigure 1. All-cause death rates by gender, age group and time period\ncause of death data. Moreover, we achieved high follow-\nup of the participants in the study, with only 1.2% lost to\nfollow-up at 3 years. All those recruited at baseline had\nbeen permanently resident in the research site for at least\n12 months before recruitment, thus reducing the likelihood\nof including labour migrants who had `returned home to\ndie'. There is inevitably some bias in recruitment at base-\nline, in that those who were unable to respond, usually be-\ncause they had died or were too sick (8.1%), were not\nincluded as were those who were not present to be inter-\nviewed (28.7%). Excluding people who were ill will result\nin under-representation of those in poor health, whereas\nthe exclusion of the much larger number of individuals\nwho were not available could influence the results either\npositively or negatively.\nFor rural sub-Saharan Africa, there was a high propor-\ntion of participants living in households without younger\nadults, including those older persons living in `skip gener-\nation' households. This might be related to the impact of\nthe HIV epidemic on younger adults as well as the increas-\ning number of young men and women joining the migrant\nwork force.29 The situation is likely to impact on the well-\nbeing and health of the older population, although only the\nunivariate analysis shows higher mortality in those people\nliving in households without younger adults or children,\npossibly due to the weight of other socio-demographic fac-\ntors such as education and socioeconomic status.\nMoreover, we observed the lowest mortality in the small\ngroup of individuals (2.4%) living in `skip generation'\nhouseholds, although this might be accounted for by selec-\ntion bias, in that only fitter older people become sole care-\ngivers for children.\nPeople of Mozambican origin have a higher risk of mor-\ntality in the univariate analysis, an effect that it is not\nobserved in the multivariate analysis. This may be because\npeople of South African origin suffer higher levels of HIV.11\nOur results demonstrate higher survival in women.\nIndividuals who were not in a partnership had lower sur-\nvival, as did those with lower socioeconomic status, higher\nlevels of disability and lower quality of life. We have previ-\nously demonstrated that women in this cohort report\nhigher disability and lower quality of life even after adjust-\ning for the effect of age.12 These findings reflect the `male-\nfemale health survival paradox'30,31 frequently observed in\nhigh-income countries, where women report poorer health\nand quality of life and yet have lower death rates. It may\nbe related to some other set of health protective mechan-\nisms, whether biologically-based or involving health-\npromoting behaviours or forms of social protection in\nfamilies, but we are unable to investigate this further with\nthese data.\nA striking finding is the pattern of mortality, particu-\nlarly in men, with an apparent fall in mortality with\nincreasing age after an earlier rise. We do not believe that\nthis is due to errors in recorded date of birth. Although all\nparticipants in this study were born before 1992 when the\nfirst census round was undertaken, and birthdates were\nnot certified by the HDSS field team, those dates were later\ncompared and corrected with those in the National ID\ncards that most of the population hold. Moreover, ages\nwere further analysed looking for trends that could\nindicate age misreporting (for example, low numbers in a\nspecific age group compared with others), but no evident\ntrend in misreporting was found.\nthat mortality rose dramatically in this older population\n(Figure 1). The effect is more pronounced for men than for\nwomen and is probably accounted for by an increasing\nnumber of deaths from HIV and TB (Figure 2). This is\nconfirmed by comparison of the different causes of death\nmodels (Table 4). There is highest mortality in the age\ngroup 50\u00ad54 years for the model including HIV/TB deaths,\nbut the more usual higher mortality at older ages for mod-\nels including chronic diseases and other infections.\nOur observations suggest that older people in the\nAgincourt sub-district are experiencing overall worsening\nof mortality. These changes are probably due to a combin-\nation of the direct effect of the HIV epidemic on older\nadults, and the effects of the HIV epidemic on the survival\nof younger adults. Whereas mortality remains higher than\nTable 2.
