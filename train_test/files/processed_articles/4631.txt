Prorenin, which has\nbeen generally assumed to be an inactive precursor of renin,\ncan bind to its cognate receptor, inducing a conformational\nchange that renders it enzymatically active.1-4 Prorenin syn-\nthesis can occur at adrenal tissue, eye and ovaries,5-7 and\nthe physiological concentration of prorenin in plasma is in\nthe picomolar range. For as of yet unknown reasons, the\nconcentration of prorenin in human plasma is higher than\nthat of renin8 and is 100 times higher in microalbuminuric\ndiabetic subjects.5,9,10 High levels of prorenin in human\nplasma may indicate that the body is in a pathological con-\ndition, thus prorenin could be predictive of disease. The\nbinding of prorenin to PRR not only increases the produc-\ntion ofAngII11,12 but also activates signal transduction path-\nindependently of AngII. AngII is the key component of the\nRAS and can elicit proliferative, fibrotic and proinflamma-\ntory effects through a series of mechanisms that are com-\nmonly linked to the production of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). ROS play an important role in cardiovascular dis-\neases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart fail-\nure.17 The struggle between proliferation and apoptosis of\nvascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which participate\nin the initiation and early progression of atherosclerosis,18\nwas demonstrated to be mediated by AngII through ROS\nBinding of prorenin to (pro)renin receptor\ninduces the proliferation of human\numbilical artery smooth muscle cells via\nROS generation and ERK1/2 activation\nFeng Y Liu1, Xiao Y Liu1, Li J Zhang1, Yun P Cheng2\nand Yi N Jiang2\n Keywords\n(pro)renin receptor, ROS, atherosclerosis, proliferation, apoptosis\n1Dalian Medical University, Dalian, PR China\n2Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian\nMedical University, Dalian, PR China\nCorresponding author:\nYi N Jiang, Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital\nLiaoning Province, China.\nOriginal Article\n100 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(2)\nproduction, which depends on the activation of NAD(P)H\noxidase.19-23 However, whether prorenin could induce\napoptosis in human umbilical artery smooth muscle\n(HUASM) cells has not been reported, and whether and\nhow prorenin and PRR affect the production of ROS in\nHUASM cells remain unknown.\nIn this study, we hypothesized that the binding of\nprorenin to PRR can promote proliferation and inhibit\napoptosis, and we investigated the role of ROS in the\nprorenin-induced effects on HUASM cells. To evaluate the\nPRR-mediated, AngII-independent effects of prorenin, we\nused Valsartan (Ang II type 1 receptor blocker) and\ntargeted siRNA.\nMaterials and methods\nChemicals\nProrenin was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). Valsartan\nwas obtained from Beijing Novartis Company (Beijing,\nfrom Abcam (Cambridge, UK). PRR siRNA and transfec-\ntion reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (California,\nCell culture\nHuman umbilical cords were collected from healthy preg-\nnant women at The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian\nMedical University. The pregnant women gave written\ninformed consent prior to delivery. This study was\napproved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated\nHospital of Dalian Medical University.\nUnder sterile conditions, umbilical arteries were iso-\nlated from human umbilical cords. The arteries were dis-\nsected longitudinally, and the intimas of the arteries were\nscraped with scissors to remove the endothelium. Next,\nthe arteries were cut into small pieces of tissue (1\u00d71\u00d71\nmm). The tissue samples were placed in 35 mm culture\nof Medium 231 (Gibco, California, USA) supplemented\nwith Smooth Muscle Growth Supplement (SMGS, Gibco,\nCalifornia, USA) and 1\u00d7 strength antibiotics/antimycotic\n(HyClone, Logan City, Utah, USA) was gently trans-\nferred into the culture plates. The media were refreshed\nevery 3 days.\nCells began growing from the explants within 1 week\nand became confluent in approximately 3\u00ad4 weeks. The\nHUASM cells were cultured in Medium 231 with SMGS\nfor trypsinization, passage, or freezing, according to stand-\nard protocols. We used second-to-fourth passage HUASM\ncells in our experiments.\nSpecific siRNA and transfection\nThe cDNA sequence of the PRR gene was obtained from\nthe siRNAs were designed and chemically synthesized by\nInvitrogen (California, USA). The nucleotide sequences\nwere as follows: 5'-GCUCCGUAAUCGCCUGUUU -3'\n(sense), and 5'-AAACAGGCGAUUACGGAGC -3'(anti-\nsense). As a negative control, a non-targeting scrambled\nsiRNA (control siRNA) was also purchased. Cells were\nplated in 6-well plates, and the siRNAs were transfected\ninto the cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent\n(Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manufac-\nturer's protocols.\nImmunofluorescence\ncells per well and grown in Medium 231 supplemented\nwith SMGS for 1\u00ad2 days. The cells were rinsed with phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformalde-\nhyde (30 min, 4\u00b0C), washed three times with PBS, and\ncells were washed with PBS and then incubated at room\ntemperature for 1 h in PBS with 5% bovine serum albumin\n(BSA). Labeling experiments were performed with a\nmouse anti-human antibody against -smooth muscle actin\nCambridge, UK). Fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure goat\nanti-mouse IgG antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) or\nRhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-\nrabbit IgG antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) diluted\n1:100 in PBS (1 h, room temperature) were used for visu-\nthe cell nuclei. The cells were rinsed and assessed by fluo-\nrescence microscopy.\nMeasurement of cell proliferation\nThe proliferation of HUASM cells was measured using a\nCell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Beyotime, Shanghai,\nChina), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly,\nthe HUASM cells were cultured in triplicate at 2\u00d7103 cells/\nwell in 96-well plates. After different treatments, 10 l of\nCCK-8 reagent was added to each well. After 1 h of incu-\nbation at 37\u00b0C, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured\nusing a microplate reader. The relative levels of cell prolif-\neration for each group were normalized to the levels of the\ncontrol group, which represented 100%.\nROS measurement\nROS production was measured using a Reactive Oxygen\nSpecies Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Briefly,\n1\u00d7106 HUASM cells seeded into 6-well plates were treated\nwith prorenin for 24 h.At the end of the treatment period, the\ncells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with\nDCFH-DA(5 M) in medium for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark.\nNext, the cells were washed with PBS three times, trypsi-\nnized, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry.\nThe fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured at 488\nnm using a flow cytometer (BD FACS AriaII, USA).\nReal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol rea-\ngent (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manu-\nfacturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized from total\nRNA using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa,\nDalian, China). mRNAexpression levels were evaluated by\nreal-time PCR using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics)\nand SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The\namplification reactions were performed in a total volume of\nfor 30 s) with the following parameters: 95\u00b0C for 5 s and\n60\u00b0C for 20 s. GAPDH was used as the internal control. All\nof the primers were designed by TaKaRa (Table 1).\nWestern blot\nCellular proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (150 mM\nPMSF) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The extracts were centrifuged at\nthe total cellular protein were harvested. The protein con-\ncentrations were quantified using the BCA Protein Assay\nKit (Keygen, Nanjing, China). The total protein extracts\n(30 g) were electrophoretically separated using 10% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically\nonto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 m pore\nsize). The blots were blocked for 60 min at room tempera-\nture with 5% skimmed milk in PBS with Tween-20.\nImmunoblotting was performed using anti-phospho-ERK\n1/2, anti-ERK 1/2 (Bioworld Technology, Minneapolis,\nUSA, dilution 1:750), anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz, California,\nUSA, dilution 1:200), anti-Bax (Santa Cruz, California,\nUSA, dilution 1:500) and anti-PRR (Abcam, Cambridge,\nUK, dilution 1:700) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. After\nthree washes with PBST at 10 min, the membrane was\nincubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second-\nary antibodies (dilution 1:1500, ZHONGSHAN, Beijing,\nChina) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visual-\nized using ECL Plus according to the manufacturer's proto-\ncols. Blotting with an anti--actin (dilution 1:1000, Bioss,\nBeijing, China) antibody served as an internal control.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) using SPSS 16.0 software, and the least signifi-\ncant difference (LSD) test or the Dunnett T3 test were used\nfor post-hoc subgroup analysis. All of the data are\nexpressed as the mean values \u00b1 SD of three independent\nexperiments. The data were considered statistically signifi-\nResults\nVerification of vascular smooth muscle cells and\nthe location PRR in HUASM cells\nWe observed HUASM cells that appeared fusiform or\npolygonal in shape by light microscopy (Figure 1(a)).\nBecause smooth muscle cells express the smooth muscle\nmyofilament protein -smooth muscle actin (SMA), we\nevaluated -SMA(Figure 1(b\u00add)) by fluorescence immuno-\nhistochemistry and observed the uniform and filamentous\nexpression of -SMA in the HUASM cells. We also deter-\nmined the distribution of PRR in HUASM cells by fluores-\ncence immunohistochemistry and detected the cytoplasmic\nexpression of PRR (Figure 1(e\u00adg)). We can see that the red\nfluorescence represents the PRR expression, and find that\naround the cell nucleus the PRR expression was higher.\nEffect of prorenin on proliferation in HUASM\ncells\nCell proliferation was assayed using a CCK-8 assay. We\ntreated HUASM cells with 0.1, 1 and 10 nM prorenin for\nTable 1. Primer series of Bcl-2, Bax, ATP6AP2 and GAPDH gene.\nGene Primer sequence(5'-3') Sequence Product\n102 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(2)\nthat 10 nM prorenin most significantly induced the prolif-\neration of HUASM cells independently of AngII (Figure\n2(a)). Next, we observed the effect of prorenin on prolif-\neration at different time points and found that with increas-\ning time, the proliferative effect became more significant\n(Figure 2(b)).\nWe next determined whether prorenin could affect the\nexpression of apoptosis-related factors.As shown in Figure\n2, both protein and mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2\nand pro-apoptotic Bax were upregulated and downregu-\nlated, respectively, in the 10 nM group compared with\nnone and con group. These results indicated that prorenin\ncan regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in HUASM\ncells.\nDownregulation of PRR inhibits the prorenin-\ninduced proliferation of HUASM cells\nTo determine whether the effects of prorenin are medi-\nated by the PRR in HUASM cells, HUASM cells were\ntransfected with PPR-targeting siRNA. At 72 hours after\ntransfection, the levels of PRR mRNA were the most sig-\nnificantly reduced by 82% (Figure 3(a)), and the PRR\nprotein was reduced to barely detectable levels (Figure\nTransfection with a PRR siRNA significantly decreased\nthe effects that prorenin (10 nM at 24 h) elicited on the\nproliferation of HUASM cells (Figure 4(a)). The expres-\nsion of Bcl-2 and Bax were also affected by PRR.As shown\nin Figure 4, the upregulated expression of Bcl-2 and the\ndownregulated expression of Bax were altered, at both the\nprotein and mRNA levels, after transfection with the PRR\nsiRNA. These results indicated that the prorenin-induced\neffects in HUASM cells were mediated by PRR.\nProrenin promotes the production of ROS in\nHUASM cells\nAlthough prorenin can promote the proliferation of\nHUASM cells, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.\nThus, we first examined whether prorenin elicits an effect\non the production of ROS in HUASM cells. We found that\nprorenin increases the production of ROS in a concentra-\ntion-dependent manner and that the treatment with the\nnitric oxide synthase inhibitor DPI could inhibit this ROS\nproduction (Figure 5(a)). Transfection with a PRR siRNA\nsignificantly reduced the effects of prorenin (10 nM at 24\nh) on the production of ROS (Figure 5(b)). These data\nindicated that prorenin can induce the production of ROS\nthrough PRR.\nEffect of prorenin on ERK1/2 phosphorylation\nProrenin significantly increased the phosphorylation of\nERK1/2 independently of AngII, with peaks at 15 min and\n30 min compared with the control (Figure 5(c)).\nFurthermore, pretreatment with DPI (10 M) decreased\nthe prorenin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 to a\nlevel that was similar to that observed with PD98059\nFigure 1.

These results indicated that ROS\nare involved in prorenin-induced phosphorylation of\nERK1/2 in HUASM cells.\nProrenin promotes proliferation via the\nproduction of ROS and the activation of the\nProrenin can induce the production of ROS and the phos-\nphorylation of ERK1/2 in HUASM cells, but whether ROS\nand ERK1/2 are required for prorenin-induced prolifera-\ntion is unknown. As shown in Figure 6, pretreatment with\nDPI and PD98059 significantly inhibited the production of\nROS, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the proliferative\neffects of prorenin on HUASM cells. Moreover, the pre-\ntreatment also altered the prorenin-induced upregulated\nexpression of Bcl-2 and the downregulated expression of\nBax at both the protein and mRNA levels.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we demonstrated that prorenin can promote\nthe proliferation of HUASM cells and upregulate the\nexpression of Bcl-2 and downregulate the expression of\nBax through PRR independently of AngII. We also found\nthat ROS and ERK1/2 are involved in these prorenin-\ninduced effects.\nFigure 2.

The role of\nPRR has been investigated in many cell and tissue types.\nThe activation of PRR promotes the expression of fibrosis-\noxidative stress in neuronal cells.25 In animal models, PRR\nhas been shown to be involved in the regulation of myo-\ncardial fibrosis and the deterioration of cardiac function.26\nIn diabetic rats, the expression of PRR is upregulated27 and\ncontributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis,28,29\ndiabetic nephropathy,30 and elevated blood pressure and\nheart rate.31 Extensive evidence has shown that PRR is\nassociated with cardiovascular disease.32\nProrenin, which is considered as an inactive renin pre-\ncursor, can bind to PRR within the nanomolar range1,2,33\nand trigger a series of molecular events. The binding of\nprorenin to PRR might not only promote the production of\nAngII but also might play a role similar to, but indepen-\ndently of, AngII. In this study, we demonstrated that\nprorenin can promote the proliferation of HUASM cells\nthrough PRR independently of AngII and can further regu-\nlate the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. Proliferation and\napoptosis are imbalanced processes during the early pro-\ngression of atherosclerosis.\nVSMCs have two types of phenotype: synthetic\nphenotype and contractile phenotype. VSMCs undergo a\nphenotypic change from contractile phenotype to syn-\nthetic phenotype in response to external stimulation such\nas growth factors and shear stress.34 This transformation\ndirectly causes abnormal proliferation and migration of\nVSMCs from the medial layer to the intimal layer, and\nVSMCs can synthesize extracellular matrix which is\nresponsible for formation of atherosclerotic plaque.18\nPhenotype modulation of VSMCs contributes to the\nremodeling of vessels, which further leads to the occur-\nrence of cardiovascular diseases. Apoptosis occurs at dif-\nferent stages of atherosclerosis. In the early progression of\natherosclerosis, phenotype-transformed VSMCs may\nexpress adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhe-\nsion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1\nlike endothelial cells, and these adhesion molecules could\npromote VSMC proliferation and also prevent apoptosis\nof these cells.18 The Bcl-2 family proteins are important\nregulators of cellular apoptosis pathways, and Bcl-2 is an\nanti-apoptotic protein, whereas Bax is a pro-apoptotic\nprotein.35 These proteins contribute to the balance between\nproliferation and apoptosis.36 Our study showed that\nFigure 4. Downregulation of PRR inhibits the prorenin-induced proliferation of HUASM cells.\nHUASM cells were transfected with control (open bars) or PPR (filled bars)-targeted siRNAs. Then, the cells were exposed to prorenin (10 nM) for\na period of 24 h in the presence of Valsartan and PD123319.

The data are shown as the mean values \u00b1 SD.\nprorenin can regulate the expression of apoptosis proteins\nthrough PRR independently of AngII in HUASM cells,\nand this anti-apoptotic effect may contribute to the forma-\ntion of early atherosclerosis.\nROS are known to participate in the development of\nmany cardiovascular diseases.37 In VSMCs, various stim-\nuli can induce the production of ROS, which might induce\nfurther proliferation,38 increase inflammatory gene expres-\nsion39 and modulate matrix remodeling.40 In endothelial\ncells, ROS can regulate the expression of adhesion mole-\ncules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and\nintracellular adhesion molecule-1.41 The production of\nROS, which can represent a second messenger, can trigger\na series of downstream signal transduction pathways, such\nantioxidative defense system and oxidative stress can con-\ntribute to the dysfunction of vascular cells, increasing the\nrelative inflammatory gene expression.44 Based on the\neffect of ROS on VSMCs and endothelial cells, ROS can\nparticipate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our\nstudy showed that prorenin can promote the production of\nROS through PRR independently of AngII. In HEK14 and\nneuronal25 cells, ROS are also involved in prorenin-\ninduced effects through PRR. In addition, the expression\nof PRR is regulated by ROS in diabetic rats.27 In previous\nstudies, the prorenin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2\nfirmed that the prorenin-induced phosphorylation of\nERK1/2 is mediated by ROS production, and that the inhi-\nbition of ROS production reduced the phosphorylation of\nERK1/2. Early studies have also reported that ROS can\nmediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to AngII.46\nA recent study claimed that in neuronal cells, the produc-\ntion of ROS through PRR is regulated by ERK1/2 and\nPI3K/Akt.25 There may be a crosstalk between ROS pro-\nduction and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which\nremains to be elucidated. Overall, ROS and ERK1/2 play\npivotal roles in terms of prorenin-induced effects.\nThe RAS plays a key role in cardiovascular and renal\ndiseases, and the blockade of the RAS is considered to be\nbeneficial and to reduce cardiovascular risks, despite the\nfact that its inhibition cannot completely inhibit the\nFigure 5.

The answer to this question\nmight reside in the AngII-independent effects induced by\nthe binding of prorenin with PRR. Ichihara et al.47 devel-\noped a decoy-epitope peptide of the prorenin prosegment,\nwhich is called the `handle-region peptide'(HRP) and\nwhich can block the binding of prorenin to the PRR. In in\nvivo studies, the subcutaneous administration of HRP sig-\nnificantly attenuated renal and cardiac damage.48,49\nHowever, certain studies have failed to find any effects\nelicited by HPR in this regard.50,51 Although discrepancies\nremain regarding HRP, PRR is clearly a key component of\nthe RAS, in addition toAngII, and PRR represents a poten-\ntial pharmacological target.\nIn conclusion, our study has shown that prorenin can\npromote the proliferation of HUASM cells, upregulate the\nexpression of Bcl-2 and downregulate the expression of\nBax through PRR independently of AngII.
