They\nreference major contributions to the literature and present\nstimulating debates on the topics. The themed collection\nbuilds on previously well-cited publications in which the\neditors have presented state-of-the-art articles on second-\nary analysis of qualitative data, for example, the 2004\nSpecial Issue of the International Journal of Social\nResearch Methodology on \"Celebrating Classic Sociology:\nPioneers of Contemporary British Qualitative Research,\"\nedited by Paul Thompson and Louise Corti, and the subse-\nquent 2012 Special Issue of the same journal on\n\"Perspectives on Working With Archived Textual and\nVisual Material in Social Research\" (Crow & Edwards,\nThe articles address the use of digital sources in qualita-\ntive research in both research and teaching, charting types of\nuse over the past couple of decades and looking forward to\nemerging practices and methods. Critical perspectives on the\nsecondary analysis of qualitative data are discussed where\nrelevant across the set of articles, including returning to the\nongoing debate over whether or not the \"contextualization\"\nof secondary data is essential to enable rich analysis.\nThe papers further address the promise and potential that\ntechnological innovations can bring to enable new ways of\npresenting and publishing qualitative research. Some of the\npapers make use of direct linking allowing the reader to\nexplore \"live\" data sources, thus offering an insight into how\nresearch transparency might be operationalized in the pre-\nsentation of qualitative findings and reporting.\nThe Papers\nAll the authors reflect the contemporary interest in digital\nrepresentations and qualitative secondary analysis. Two of\nthe authors/editors (Corti and Bishop) have been central to\nthe international initiatives, both institutional and emergent\nfrom within the research community, that mark the present\nstate of the art. The issue benefits from this experience, and\nfrom the collaboration of all three editors in \"Digital Futures,\"\n1University of Essex, Colchester, UK\n2University of Surrey, Guildford, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nLouise Corti, UK Data Archive, University of Essex, Colchester CO4\nEmail: corti@essex.ac.uk\nEditorial for Special Edition, Digital\nRepresentations: Re-Using and Publishing\nDigital Qualitative Data\nLouise Corti1, Nigel Fielding2, and Libby Bishop1\n Keywords\nsecondary analysis, qualitative data, qualitative research, publishing data, social history\n2 SAGE Open\na funded project engaging with the cutting edge affordances\nof Web 2.0 technologies and beyond in application to quali-\ntative research, culminating in the U.K. Data Service's online\ndata browsing system, QualiBank (UK Data Service, 2014).\nCorti and Fielding in their paper, titled \"Opportunities From\nthe Digital Revolution: Implications for Researching,\nPublishing and Consuming Qualitative Research,\" examine the\nexistence of knowledge and data in digital form and how these\noffer opportunities for research and study (Corti & Fielding,\n2016). They examine the role of \"born digital\" materials and\ntrust in, and persistence of, these sources. The paper addresses\nthe significant research opportunities brought by Big Data by\napplying computational technologies to digital textual sources.\nThey offer exemplars of the contemporary use of qualitative\ndata within academia and citizen (social) science. The Internet\nand other online media are re-shaping the discovery process\nwith crowdsourcing generating much new data and knowledge.\nThe authors note the need to understand new and emergent\nmodes of doing and reporting informal social science research\narising from these trends.What are the implications for research\ndata services in supporting access to these information sources?\nThe authors examine current practices in generating new kinds\nof knowledge outputs, and in more formal academic publish-\ning, they note the role of the \"enhanced publication,\" a peer-\nreviewed digital output where readers can interact with primary\nraw data sources. The paper addresses the need for the publish-\ning interface to enable easy authoring, and is mindful of the\neffort involved by author and reader and the potential returns.\nFinally Corti and Fielding's paper addresses the recent\ndebate about research transparency, drawing on value of rep-\nlication of data and methods to enable openness, yet ques-\ntioning how some traditional and specific research practices\nmight be eroded by inflexible journal publisher policies. The\nauthors highlight the intellectual and methodological chal-\nlenges of demonstrating transparency of qualitative research\nby showing various practical solutions for adding context to\ndata, and through transparency of production. Finally the\nauthors conclude on the strengths and weaknesses of the\nanalytic transparency, a policy recently proposed by\nthe political science community in the United States to evi-\ndence claims made with data in academic publications.\nBishop and Kuula-Lummi's contribution, titled \"Revisiting\nQualitative Data Reuse: A Decade On,\" provides a journey\nthrough two decades of re-using digital qualitative data created\nfrom previous research projects (Bishop & Kuula-Lummi,\n2016). Re-use provides a unique opportunity to study the raw\nmaterials of past research projects to gain insights for both\nmethodological and substantive purposes. In the past decade,\nuse of the approach has grown rapidly to become widely\naccepted and practiced. This growth is explained by several fac-\ntors such as the open data movement, research funders'policies\nsupportingresearchtransparencyanddatasharing,andresearch-\ners seeing benefits from sharing all manner of resources. A fur-\nther factor enabling data re-use has been improved services and\ninfrastructure, such as the U.K. Data Service and the Finnish\nSocial Science DataArchive, which provide access to hundreds\nof data collections for social scientists.\nNevertheless, challenges remain when re-using qualitative\ndata and Bishop and Kuula-Lummi's paper engages with the\nroles of context, ethical issues, and sampling from digital data\narchives. Recent case studies of data re-use for studies of\nhealth, food, family, and more are presented that illustrate inno-\nvative approaches used in both research and teaching. Diverse\nforms of collaboration among primary and secondary research-\ners work to fill in gaps of contextual information, and to gener-\nate deep insights into data. The case from Finland suggests that\ntheir most popular qualitative data set is one generated for a\nwriting competition: a collection of 800 autobiographical nar-\nratives, including some fiction and poetry, on the conditions\nand experiences of poverty. The writings' popularity for\nresearch lends new insight to the academic debate over recov-\nery of context in secondary analysis, in particular negating the,\nsometimes militant, view held by some social researchers about\nthe absolute necessity of rich context to support re-use of raw\ndata. Responses from users who have confronted the data say\nthat they did so with very little context and documentation\navailable, and further, did not express any need for it. This pro-\nvides evidence that the depth and richness of a large data set\ncan ameliorate lack of context, and that it can stand on its own\nas a resource to interrogate.\nThe two papers written by Lawrence and Elliott and\nSutcliffe-Brown are based on social historical reinterpreta-\ntion of existing data from a well-known scholar who pub-\nlished widely in the area of social class, Ray Pahl. They\npresent insight into the re-use of much older data sources,\ndigitized for the purpose of re-use and offer a methodologi-\ncal focus that addresses methods of data sampling and selec-\ntion in qualitative analysis. At a broad level, all three authors\nare confronting a central debate in social theory--the relative\nroles played by agency and structure.\nLawrence and Elliott in their contribution, titled \"The\nEmotional Economy of Unemployment: A Re-Analysis of\ninterviews from one couple, Linda and Jim, who had been\ncentral voices in Pahl's book, Divisions of Labour (Lawrence\n& Elliott, 2016). In their paper, the authors return to these\ninterviews to explore themes that had not been a focus for\nPahl's research, focusing on emotions and identity. In doing\nso, they uncover new dimensions of agency in the stories\nfrom Linda and Jim. Pahl was explicitly situating his work in\nThatcher's Britain and criticizing its policies, but Lawrence\nand Elliott take a longer, more historical view on these mate-\nrials. In their revisiting of the data, Lawrence and Elliott\ndevelop a nuanced interpretation, one that acknowledges a\nlonger view by looking not only at how Linda and Jim\nresponded to critical periods of high unemployment but also\ntheir changing relationships with benefits, home ownership,\nand employment. These insights from seeing lives as a tra-\njectory portray a deeper understanding of the emotional\neconomy of unemployment.\nCorti et al. 3\nSutcliffe-Brown's (2016) paper, titled \"New Perspectives\nFrom Unstructured Interviews: Young Women, Gender and\nSexuality on the Isle of Sheppey in 1980,\" focuses on the\nnarrative of one person, a young working-class woman liv-\ning on Sheppey and her experiences in the early 1980s. She\nre-explores this interview, asking questions of this narrative\nthat were not addressed by any of the original researchers. In\ndoing so, challenges of both missing context and ethically\nsensitive material needed to be addressed.\nDrawing on recent work on emotional history, Sutcliffe-\nBrown analyzes this text using tools from oral history and\nfrom feminist psychology. As the paper by Bishop and\nKuula-Lummi demonstrates, the presence of limited contex-\ntual information does not preclude finding new insights\nfrom data. Methodologically, this paper also demonstrates\nthe rich potential of drawing from multiple disciplines, such\nas history and psychology.\nHaaker and Morgan Brett in their paper on \"Developing\nResearch-Led Teaching: Two Cases of Practical Data Re-Use\nin the Classroom\" examine the value of using real data to bring\nto life teaching undergraduate sociology (Haaker & Morgan\nBrett, 2016). They introduce two case studies. The first is\ndrawn from sociologist Annette Lawson who undertook\nresearch in the early 1980s to explore the taboo topic of adul-\ntery (Lawson, 1988). This data set, through its topic of interest\nto younger people, presents opportunities for teaching aids and\naccompanying guidance for classroom discussions, particu-\nlarly around relationship values and attitudes, sexual orienta-\ntion, and the role of gender and socioeconomic status. The\nsecond case study is based on Stan Cohen's 1972 publication\nFolk Devils and Moral Panics, a core text for criminology in\nA-level and university classrooms (Cohen, 1987). With its\nfocus on criminality, youth culture, and its depiction by the\nmass media, it has captured the imagination of students for the\npast 40 years. The authors show how they developed an inno-\nvative teaching resource with substantive learning exercises\nbased on extracts of real data as well as other online resources.\nThe authors conclude by setting out how students can develop\na range of transferrable skills by confronting real data with sub-\nstantive and relevant topics for research methods teaching.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research and/or authorship of this article: This editorial and spe-\ncial edition article was prepared with support from the ESRC as part\nof its U.K. data infrastructure funding for the U.K. Data Service.\nReferences\nBishop, L., & Kuula-Lummi, A.
