    "abstract": "Abstract\nSociology has focused predominantly upon `collective memories' and their impact on social\ncontinuity and change, while relegating individual memories to the status of an empirical data\nresource for research on experiences and identity construction or maintenance. This article\nsuggests, however, that sociology has overlooked the part individual memories play in social\nproduction. It applies a post-anthropocentric, new materialist ontology, in which bodies, things,\nsocial formations, ideas, beliefs and memories can all possess capacities to materially affect and be\naffected. To explore the part that personal memory can play in producing the present and hence\nthe future, data from in-depth interviews in a study of adults' food decision-making and practices\nare reported. Personal memories deriving from earlier events affect current food practices, and\nthese contribute to the materiality of people's consumption of food stuffs. The article concludes\nby reflecting on the wider importance of personal memory for sociological inquiry and memory\nstudies.\n",

It addresses this issue by the applica-\ntion of a new materialist and post-human sociology that acknowledges the `materiality'\nof memories, supplying to them a capacity to materially affect the world (just as they are\nthemselves affected by events). It sets out propositions for the study of personal memory\nand social production in terms of the micropolitical affectivity of remembering and for-\ngetting, and illustrates and explores these via empirical data on how memory and remem-\nbering affect people's everyday food choices. More generally, the article will thereby aim\nto re-balance the emphasis within the sociology of memory that has privileged `collec-\nunderstanding of continuity and change in the social world. It will consequently also\nseek to cut across barriers that treat individual memories as the territory of psychology\nand the collective that of sociology.\nAfter a brief review of how sociology has engaged with issues around memory and\nremembering, the article sets out a new materialist framework for re-thinking what mem-\nory does sociologically. To illustrate this argument, we turn then to the specific topic of\nfood preferences and choices, and report data from a study in which respondents reflect\nupon the influences on what food they currently consume or prefer. We assess from a\nmaterialist perspective how personal memories affect current food preferences, and then\nconclude by discussing more generally the key part that personal memories play in pro-\nducing the social world from moment to moment.\nMemory in Social Research\nbeen individualistic: both in terms of the physiological processes involved in how\nhumans remember past events, and with the specific memories of individuals, typically\nas these bear upon mental health. Sociologists by contrast have been cautious about per-\nsonal memories, regarding them either as subjective representations of the social world\nwith an unclear relationship to the `reality' of past events \u00ad as has been demonstrated in\npsychoanalysis and psychological studies of `false memories' (Schacter et al., 2011), or\nas ultimately socially produced anyway (Erll, 2008: 5). The proper concerns of sociol-\nogy, Jedlowsi (2001) argues, are the social `frameworks' that give meaning to personal\nmemories; collective memories; and cultural attitudes towards memory. Personal memo-\nries have consequently been given less weight, and have been treated primarily as empir-\nical data resources to enable researchers to glean information on respondents'experiences\n(Jedlowsi, 2001: 31) or as constitutive of stories/narratives people use in identity con-\nMemory was accorded little attention in classical sociology (Olick and Robbins,\n1998: 107), with the exception of Durkheim's disciple Halbwachs, who developed and\nresearched the concept of collective memory (1992 [1950]), as an antidote to psycholo-\ngy's individualistic focus. He argued that individuals remember the past only in the con-\ntext of membership of a specific group, community or other social body (Connerton,\nsentations concerning the past, which each group produces, institutionalizes, guards and\nFox and Alldred 3\ntransmits through the interaction of its members' (Jedlowsi, 2001: 33). As such, it pro-\nvides a means for these groups to establish distinctive social identities and differentiate\nthemselves from others (Neiger et al., 2011: 3). It follows that collective memories can\npossess a `political' objective (Neiger et al., 2011: 4) that personal memories do not.\nThe ascendancy of collective memory within sociology may be seen against the back-\ncloth of the discipline's `cultural turn' (Coser, 1992; Friedland and Mohr, 2004; Miller,\nthat meanings, symbols and cultural framings played within social processes and institu-\ntions and in the social construction of events, experiences and identities. Collective\nmemory has become a dominant research concern of the sociology of memory and\n`memory studies', where studies have explored collective processes of remembering and\nforgetting in material structures and practices such as museums, memorials, ceremonies\nThompson, 2016; Neiger et al., 2011), and embodied practices such as military drill or\nThis sociological and relational emphasis focused studies of memory upon how the\nsocial world produces specific collective memories (Zerubavel, 1995), addressing tem-\nporality by linking remembered pasts to the lived present and the imagined future\n(Conway, 2010: 443). Collective remembering and forgetting has been implicated in the\ntransmission of `culture' from past to present (Olick and Robbins, 1998: 108); in the\nmacropolitics of how states establish adherence to political doctrines such as `democ-\n126; Sutton, 2008b). Human geography, meanwhile, has also addressed the interactions\nbetween collective memories, space and landscapes (Foote and Azaryahu, 2007; Jones,\nWithin this body of work, some scholars of collective memory have addressed the\nrelationship with materiality, exploring how memories are mediated by material cultures,\nparticularly within museums, monuments and buildings.2 Sturken (2016) explored how\nmaterial remnants housed in the 9/11 Memorial Museum have reconstituted New York's\nTwin Towers as Ground Zero, with a new narrative concerning loss, grief and terrorism.\nSimilarly, Bach (2016) suggests that the various memorial sites and `tourist experiences'\nestablished after the fall of the former Berlin Wall serve both to conserve memories of\nthe past and to produce a number of distinct and sometimes contradictory narratives for\nthe present (variously around democracy, globalisation, consumption, creativity). The\n`Island of Ireland' Peace Park in Belgium is a monument whose design and use aims to\nmobilise specific memories of the past `in order to intervene in the political discourses of\nThese sociological studies typically establish material objects as constitutive of mem-\nories. However, further steps are needed to explore the memory/matter connection. First,\nall the studies we have just mentioned, and many others like them, retain sociology's\nfocus upon collective memories and memorialisation \u00ad shared sites of memory \u00ad and do\nnot venture into the interactions between `personal' memories and matter. Second, we\nwant to query the implied directionality of the interaction between matter and memory/\nremembering. If, as Jedlowski (2000: 30) notes, `recalling and forgetting, selecting and\nprocessing'are pervasive in most walks of life, then what are the material effects of these\nmemories in the present? To explore this further, we take advantage of the post-anthro-\npocentric ontology of the new materialisms, in which thoughts, emotions and memories\nhave capacity to materially affect.\nA (New) Materialist Perspective on Memory\nIn the humanities and social sciences, new materialism refers to a range of perspectives\nthat have in common a `turn to matter' (as opposed to the focus upon texts and language\nin post-structuralism) that emphasises the materiality of the world and everything \u00ad social\nand natural \u00ad within it. Drawing on a very wide range of disparate philosophical, feminist\n2015), the new materialisms recognise materiality as plural and complex, uneven and\ncontingent, relational and emergent (Coole and Frost, 2010: 29). Unlike Marxist sociolo-\ngy's `historical materialism' that considered an economic base as the foundational driver\nfor social relations, new materialists consider that the world and history are produced by\na wide range of material forces that extend from the physical and the biological to the\nThe ontology advocated by new materialist scholars has been described as `flat' or\n`monist' (as opposed to `dualist'), rejecting differences not only between Marx's (1971)\nconception of `base' and `superstructure', but also between `natural' and `cultural'\nrealms, human and non-human, and \u00ad perhaps most significantly for this article \u00ad between\nmind and matter (van der Tuin and Dolphijn, 2010). By challenging any distinction\nbetween the materiality of the physical world and the social constructs of human thoughts\nand desires, it opens up the possibility to explore their material interactions, and how\nthings other than humans (for instance, a tool, a technology or even an idea) can be social\n`agents', making things happen. New materialist sociology consequently shifts humans\nfrom centre stage, to engage productively not only with human culture but also with\nother living things, and with the wider environment of inanimate matter. This `flat ontol-\nogy' (DeLanda, 2005: 51) re-focuses attention toward `events': the endless cascade of\nmaterial interactions of both nature and culture that together produce the world and\nhuman history, and away from structural or systemic `explanations' of how societies and\ncultures work (Latour, 2005: 130). Exploring the relational character of events and their\nphysical, biological and expressive composition becomes the sole means for sociology to\nexplain the continuities, fluxes and `becomings' that produce the world around us.\nTo develop the features of a sociological new materialism, we draw upon the well-\ndeveloped and widely applied conceptual framework deriving from Gilles Deleuze's\n(1988) materialist reading of Spinoza, as developed in the work of Deleuze and Guattari\nGrosz (1994) and Thrift (2004), and then applied in empirical social science by Alldred\nArmstrong (2011) and others. This DeleuzoGuattarian approach is predicated upon three\npropositions, concerning relationality, agency and micropolitical capacities.\nFox and Alldred 5\nFirst, new materialism asserts the fundamental relationality of all matter: bodies,\nthings and social formations gain their apparent `is-ness' only through their relationship\nto other similarly contingent and ephemeral bodies, things and ideas (Deleuze, 1988:\n1988: 88) of these relations that develop `in a kind of chaotic network of habitual and\nnon-habitual connections, always in flux, always reassembling in different ways' (Potts,\nan event such as an erotic kiss, which comprises not just relations between pairs of lips\nbut also physiological processes, personal and cultural contexts, aspects of the setting,\nsexual codes and norms of conduct, and \u00ad importantly for this article \u00ad memories of past\nexperiences (as well as many other relations specific to that particular kiss-event). The\nrelations within assemblages may be identified from sources including empirical data,\nresearch literature and our knowledge and understanding of the social and natural world.\nSecond, a conventional conception of (human) agency is replaced with the Spinozist\nnotion of affect (Deleuze, 1988: 101), meaning simply a capacity to affect or be affected.\nAn affect is a `becoming' (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 256) that represents a physical,\npsychological, emotional or social change of state or capacities of an entity (Massumi,\n1988: xvi). All matter has an `agential' capacity to affect, rather than being inert clay\nmoulded by human agency, consciousness and imagination (Barad, 1996: 181; Coole and\nFrost, 2010: 2): this assessment de-privileges human agency as the means by which the\nsocial world is produced and reproduced. Affects produce further affective capacities\nwithin assemblages (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 400), and because one affect can produce\nmore than one capacity, social production is a branching, coalescing and rupturing (rather\nthan linear) flow. Clough (2004: 15) describes this complex flow as an `affect economy'.\nThird, analysis of this relational ontology is necessarily micropolitical \u00ad at the level\nof assemblages, affects and capacities, as opposed to exterior forces, structures or sys-\ntems.Affects within assemblages act on bodies, things and social formations to alter their\ncapacities \u00ad what they can do (Duff, 2010: 625). Affect economies may limit bodies and\nthings within existing capacities or even close these down \u00ad a process of specification or\n`territorialisation' (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 88\u00ad89), or open up new possibilities\n(capacities) in them (generalisation or `de-territorialisation'). Deleuze and Guattari\nargued (1988: 294) that memories are territorialising forces that will tend to shift bodies\ninto habit and repetition.\nThis non-essentialist relational ontology suggests a framework for how we might con-\nceptualise the materiality of memory. To explore this, consider again the example of a\nkiss mentioned a moment ago. We may imagine that a qualitative research study has\ngenerated an analysis of a `kiss-assemblage' between two humans A and B on a second\ndate. This reveals (in no particular order) the following relations:\nA's lips \u00ad B's lips \u00ad social and sexual norms \u00ad A and B's personal attributes (e.g. physical\nappearance, personality, job) \u00ad dating conventions \u00ad immediate material contexts \u00ad past\nexperiences and circumstances\nThese relations assemble because of the affects between them (for instance, the affective\npower of A's appearance upon B's mind and body, or the impact of dating conventions\nthat require a kiss at the end of a second romantic date). In our imagined study of first\nkisses, we might expect to learn from interviews with A and B precisely how `past expe-\nriences and circumstances' might affect a kiss positively or negatively. They might\ndescribe how what happened during their dates, or how memories of past encounters\nwith other people (including sexual partners) gave significance to, or added or reduced\nthe pleasure provided by the kiss.\nFrom this we may conjecture that memories can materially affect bodies, things and\nsocial processes, and it is partly the memories that individuals bring to events that link\nthese events across time and space, in the process producing both social continuities and\nchange. These past experiences are not of course materially present within the current\nkiss-event, but have a virtual presence via rememberings of earlier events, along with\nother virtual affects such as expectations, imaginations, fantasies and ideas. It is these\nrememberings (which may or may not be accurate representations of the events upon\nwhich they were based) that contribute affectively \u00ad alongside many other assembled\nrelations \u00ad to event-assemblages (whether in the relatively trivial example of a kiss or in\nother events), making that event-assemblage do whatever it does.\nHowever the relational ontology of the new materialist perspective has some further\nimplications for theorising the materiality of memories. From such an ontological posi-\ntion, `memories' should not be considered as pre-existing, essential entities with fixed\nattributes. Rather, remembering and forgetting are processual and contingent: in terms of\ntheir initial production during past events; in terms of the effects they may have in the\npresent; and finally in terms of how subsequent events may affect how they are remem-\nbered or forgotten.3 More formally, we may summarise the perspective that new materi-\nalism brings to understanding memory, remembering and forgetting in the following\nthree propositions.\n1. When human bodies are assembled in a present event, memory traces of past\nevents are materially affective, entering into the `affect economy' of the present.\n2. Memory production (`memorising') is relational and contingent. Though events\nleave a corporeal, cognitive and/or emotional trace upon a body, we cannot know\nin advance what memory-traces an event will generate.\n3. Because memories interact with many other relations in an event-assemblage, we\ncannot predict what effects remembering/forgettings will have within a particular\nassemblage.\nIt is these propositions that we set out to explore in the following empirical illustration.\nStudying Food and Memory\nSocial science studies suggest that food is an important `site' of memory (Sutton, 2008a:\n176) in which memories mediate social and cultural values and norms that impact on iden-\n2006). Lupton (1994) found that students'childhood memories of food were linked strongly\nto family relationships and the rituals of shared mealtimes and the emotions associated with\nthem. These memories could be more powerful in food choice than rational criteria (Lupton,\nFox and Alldred 7\nfood memories from the 1950s and 1960s supplied Australians with a skein of cultural\nresources with which to construct `imaginary places of stability and security' to sustain fin\nde siecle identities. However, recollections of past collective meals among Greek islanders\nserved not only as nostalgia but as `prospective memories'\u00ad cues to initiate practical prepa-\nOther studies document more individual consequences of food memories. Analysis of\ndata from a 1982 Mass Observation survey (Uprichard et al., 2013) found various `food\nhates' (for foodstuffs such as tripe, milk puddings or jellied eels) grounded in memories,\npredominantly from schooldays or childhood. Some of these had endured since child-\nhood, while other respondents now enjoyed foods they had disliked when younger. In a\nstudy of memories of forced food consumption during childhood, a survey of US college\nstudents found that most episodes were recalled as powerfully negative, with 72 per cent\nsaying they would not willingly eat the foodstuff today (Batsell et al., 2002). Veterans\nexposed to Asian food during active service in the Pacific during the Second World War\nhad less favourable opinions of Chinese and Japanese food than those who had fought in\nthe European theatre (Wansink et al., 2009).\nThe challenge of researching memory from a materialist perspective is to apply meth-\nods and methodology sensitised to the affective capacities of memories upon present\nevents. We report data from a qualitative study that set out to explore food decision-\nmaking and associated practices among families living in the north of England. A sample\nof 45 adult participants was drawn from the ranks of the South Yorkshire Cohort.4\nSampling was random, but stratified according to body weight and family income, based\non BMI and Index of Multiple Deprivation scores, to provide 15 `low deprivation obese',\n15 `high deprivation obese' and 15 `high deprivation normal body weight' respondents,\nthough in this article we do not differentiate on these variables. NHS ethics approval was\ngranted for the original cohort study, with subsequent ethics approval for this study\nobtained from the University of Sheffield.\nMost participants were interviewed twice. The first interview used the `free associa-\ntion narrative' approach of Hollway and Jefferson (2000: 53) to elicit past and present\nnarratives around food and associated practices. This methodology is well suited to the\npurposes of new materialist analysis, as it can provide rich evidence of the physical,\nsocial and psychological relations in event-assemblages. The second interview applied a\nmore structured approach, to follow up and probe themes that emerged in the first inter-\nview associated with food practices.\nMethodologically, new materialism shifts focus from human agents to human/non-\nhuman assemblages, attending to the material effects of bodies, things, social formations\nand other affective relations, including memories (see Fox and Alldred, 2015 for more on\nthis analytical approach). For this article, analysis of data focused specifically upon\nmemories associated with food consumption and preferences (though for one respondent\nwe document multiple relations in her `food assemblage'). Transcripts were trawled for\nexamples where respondents explicitly described how food experiences in the past\naffected subsequent food events, attitudes or interactions, with the assistance of NVivo\ndata management software. No attempt was made by the analyst to inductively link\nreports of past food-related events in one part of the interviews to their reports of present\nfood choices in another, or to use as data discussions by respondents of third parties'past\nand present food choices. In the report of findings that follows, respondents are identified\nonly by number; quotations are referenced using a notation in which, for example, the\nreference (1.2) means respondent 1, second interview.\nStudy Findings\nIn this section we consider the data from this study in terms of the three propositions on\nthe materiality of memories set out earlier.\nProposition 1. Memories are Materially Affective, Entering into the `Affect\nEconomy' of the Present\nData suggest that memories could be materially affective, influencing present food\nevents in various ways. One respondent in the study \u00ad who worked as a school cook \u00ad\ndescribed how immediate recollection of her work influenced her daily food choices at\nhome later the same day.\nAnd I think sometimes when I'm ordering at work, ordering say like the meats and produce that\nI order, that I use for work, for cooking, I'll come home and because in the back of me head I'll\nbe thinking right I've got mince in at work that was saved for lasagne or for mince pie, whatever\nI've ordered it for. And so in the back of me head I'm going home and I'll think what can we\nhave for tea and I'll go in freezer and there'll be mince there and I'll go, oh we'll have a lasagne.\nBut it's because I've ordered it from work, you know what I mean, and it's just like the seed's\nthere in the back of your mind and you just think. So it does influence you. (23.2)\nIn addition to this `cognitive' remembering, this respondent also gave an example of a\ncorporeal or embodied memory, sometimes described as a `habit-memory' (Connerton,\n1989: 23): a memory that has been so frequently reinforced by repetition that it has a\npowerful embodied affect on subsequent events.\nI can just knock stuff up. I don't weigh a pound. Very rare. Very rare I weigh a pound because\nI just look at it and think yeah, that's right, and I just throw it all together. And I can do that, you\nknow. But I think a lot of that comes with weighing up 8oz of something for 30 years, you know\nFew food memories in the study were cognitive and corporeal, however. The overwhelm-\ning majority of food memories offered by respondents linked past food experiences to\npositive or negative reactions or emotions. Thus the following two respondents described\nremembered likes and dislikes associated with specific foodstuffs, and \u00ad in the second\nextract \u00ad how this affected meal-preparation decisions.\nI do like pork and nobody ever cooks it like my mum cooked it, and she always did it with\ncrackling and that was always gorgeous. ... I do like lots of seafood but things, I don't like\nthings like octopus, calamari, stuff like that. But I don't mind the fish, different fish, I like skate\nand I like plaice, bream, anything like that. (26.2)\nFox and Alldred 9\nWe don't experiment no, we tend to know what we like, or at the moment we tend to rely upon\nwhat we've had previously and heavily depend on that we're going to get through an evening\nSome foods were associated with bad memories from earlier in life. The following dem-\nonstrates how a negative food memory from childhood continued to affect present\nresponses to specific foods.\nI think it was powdered egg they'd used and there was always this rumour that it was stock left\nfrom the Second World War. Now whether that was true or not, maybe not, but it certainly I\nthink it was powdered egg. And I still have problems eating scrambled egg. (10.2)\nFor respondent 2, one negative experience could be enough to prevent him even tasting\na foodstuff again\n.\nI mean I suppose ultimately if I've tasted something for a first time, and then I didn't enjoy it,\nyou've always got the safeguard of just literally just pushing it away from you and saying no\nI've tasted that, I'll have something else. ... I think it was a question of that maybe an early\nexperience put me off and ... I'm entrenched in that old fashioned belief that no, no, once bitten\ntwice shy, I'm not going up that path again. (2.2)\nProposition 2. Memory Production (Memorising) is Relational and\nContingent: We Do Not Know What Memories an Event will Generate\nThough the previous examples suggest that sometimes it could be simply the recall of an\nunpleasant taste or other experience of a foodstuff that affected present food decisions,\noften the data in this study indicated a more complex process surrounding how food\nmemories had been generated in the first place. For the following respondents, food\nmemories were highly contextual. Negative responses to spaghetti Bolognese and\nchicken soup respectively were not reactions to the taste of the food, but rather that their\nfrequent serving during childhood had turned them off, so they felt they had `had enough'\nof that particular meal.\nSo every time my dad said `I'll cook', it was always spaghetti Bolognese, that's the only thing\nhe can cook. ... It's some old family recipe of my dad's side, that my dad's, I don't know where\nhe's got it from, from them, but it's a version of spag bol. ... Heavily laced in garlic and onions,\nyeah. You can smell it and taste it for days. My mum tends to, when he offers to cook; she'll be\nlike `no you're all right. I've had enough of spaghetti'. (24.2)\nMy mum would boil leftovers and use stock, and obviously meat falls off don't it. So now I don't\neat, I eat chicken soup made in a tin but I wouldn't dream of making it myself. Because I ate it\nenough when I was a kid, and we had it every Monday. Plus we had chicken every Sunday. (7.2)\nPositive memories of foods might be more to do with the positively valorised events\nwithin which the food was consumed. For the next respondent, a relatively unappetising\nfood has positive connotations with meals she had eaten with her father.\nI used to like readymade fish pies, them Admiral's fish pies, and if there's half an ounce of fish\nin them it's a miracle, you know, but it's just the taste of it. And I suppose because it reminds\nme of me dad, and me dad used to eat it. And I just like the taste of it, and I'd quite happily buy\none of them.And they're cheap and they're nasty and they're about a pound a piece and nothing\nto them at all. But I like them, you know, I just like the taste of it. And I think it's probably\nbecause it reminds me of me dad. (23.2)\nRespondent 16 claimed that she had not missed sweets, biscuits and crisps during her\nchildhood. Yet this lack may have generated an unconsidered affect that had had an unex-\npected and unintended consequence later in her life, when she was in charge of her own\ndiet.\nWe didn't have sweets and things in the house, no, chocolate and biscuits and stuff like that. ...\nWe never felt like we were missing out or anything; that was just the way it was. I thought it\nwas more strange to have them in the house than it was to not have them in the house, but then\nthe minute I could buy these things for myself I sort of went the other way and ended up eating\nFor respondent 4, the timing of her Sunday family meal was based on a moral imperative\nderiving from childhood valorisation of a ritual Sunday dinner.\nMost of the time we have it [Sunday meal] at tea time, unless Gareth's mum's coming then we\nhad it at like half past one time, something like that. ... [As a child, we] used to always have it\ndinner time [i.e. early evening], we always have a Sunday dinner. ... I think Sunday it's well\nyou should have a Sunday, it's Sunday dinner isn't it. (4.2)\nProposition 3. Memories Interact with Many Other Relations in an Event-\nAssemblage, With Unpredictable Effects\nThe examples offered so far have sought to demonstrate how a memory associated with\nfood affected present food events. However, the data also reveal that the effects of food\nmemories were often caught up with many other material relations within a current food\nevent, so that the influence of the food memory might not be straightforward. For the\nfollowing respondent, sharing food events in the present were affected not only by her\nown food-related memories, but also by the influence of her partner and his family, and\ntheir material engagements with food.\nI suppose food was, food's a big thing in Tom's side of the family, it's a big social event and\nthey enjoy their food, and they talk about food a lot, and the family centres around the table if\nyou like. And I'd say I was probably heavily influenced by that, because with my side of the\nfamily, food's important but you eat to stop being hungry and you eat to be healthy and it's not,\nyou don't indulge in all this naughty food all the time. (28.2)\nSometimes the affectivity of memories was outweighed entirely. This respondent\ndescribed how the aroma of coffee persuaded her to try drinking it, despite previous\nexperiences.\nYou go in Starbucks and it's like oh. I can remember once, I think it was when I was having him\n[child], I had this thing about coffee. So I bought a jar of coffee, I'm like I'm going to drink it,\nI really, the smell of it, and I drank it. After the first mouthful I spat it out. You know, that's\ndisgusting, it smells nice but it's disgusting. (4.1)\nEarlier we noted how memories affected respondent 16's food consumption and choices.\nHowever, analysis of the entirety of the two interviews with this respondent supplied an\nopportunity to identify the wide range of relations that contributed to her present interac-\ntions with food. In no particular order, the complex `food assemblage' of material rela-\ntions may be summarised as:\nhusband \u00ad work \u00ad autistic son \u00ad foodstuffs \u00ad supermarkets \u00ad time \u00ad family members \u00ad health\n\u00ad body weight \u00ad money \u00ad cooking equipment \u00ad diet \u00ad slimming clubs \u00ad sugar \u00ad peer group \u00ad\nrestaurants \u00ad memories of food and eating\nThese relations affected food choices in multiple, interacting ways. Thus for example,\nfood choices were affected by her son's very picky preferences that excluded many veg-\netables; by the food available in local retail outlets; by notions of `healthy eating'; by her\nefforts to lose weight, the guidance provided by her slimming club and peer pressure\nfrom other club members; and so forth. So while respondent 16 described the effects of\npast eating experiences on food choices, the affectivity of her memories was always\nassembled with many other affective forces. Similar analysis of other respondents' inter-\nviews could disclose their own unique food assemblages, within which the effects of\nmemories may play a greater or lesser part. Analysis of such assemblages demonstrates\nthat the affectivity of memories is always contextualised within a broader affect econ-\nomy, deriving from multiple interacting relations.\nDiscussion\nThe data we have offered here provide an illustration of how past events, mediated via\npersonal memories, affect present behaviour, beliefs or attitudes concerning food choice.\nWhile the fact that what we have eaten and enjoyed/disliked in the past affects what we\neat in the present may seem glaringly obvious, we would argue that it is of far wider\nsignificance: for the sociological analysis of social production; for a materialist under-\nstanding of continuity and change; and for memory studies'perspective on collective and\npersonal memories. We will consider each of these in turn.\nFirst, this insight into the part that personal memories play in producing the world and\nhistory is important because it acknowledges that memories are not just an individual\nrecord of people's movement through the events that make up their lives, but also are in\nthemselves a productive force that plays an important part in shaping our present and\nfuture. As Yates notes,\nMemory becomes accordingly both more and less mental and material, something that flows\nthrough circuits, the affective product of a network. Memory happens, turns out to be transitive,\ntakes an object, requires a subject. But it also exceeds all its hosts, seeps in between and through\nthe join between beings to become more than anyone or anything bargained for. (Yates, 2016:\nThis understanding of memory challenges the long-held sociological view that personal\nmemories are properly the domain of psychological inquiry, and that sociology should\nlimit its concerns to the sociocultural production of collective memory. A materialist\nanalysis reveals that personal memories are a key element in understanding the forces\nthat sustain continuities in the social world but also contribute to social transformations,\nas elements within of the mix of affects that shape events. This formulation of memories\nas affects cuts across the personal/collective memory dualism discussed earlier: it is\nirrelevant to this analysis whether memories are `shared', or `personal'.\nWe may extend this insight further, into the realm of non-human memory. Animal\nmemories may affect social and economic events \u00ad for example, fishes' recall of their\nbreeding grounds will affect the fishery industry and the nation's diet; dogs' and cats'\nrecollections of their owners and their homes will affect human/animal interactions, pet\nfood retail and so on. Inanimate objects (statues, museums, buildings, photographs, art) or\nsocial formations (ceremonies, traditions, rituals) can be regarded as `memorising' past\nevents, as of course do documents, photographs and media, and other physical records of\npast events (Pinchevski, 2011). All may become affective relations within event-assem-\nblages independent of human-mediated memories, and can be analysed as such.\nSecond, if doubts over the significance of memory for sociology persist, they are\nbrought into sharp focus for those who wish to embrace the monist or flattened ontology\n(Fox and Alldred, 2017; Karakayali, 2015) of perspectives including post-structuralism,\nfeminist post-humanism and the new materialisms. Unlike historical materialism, struc-\nturalism and critical realism, such perspectives operate without notions such as struc-\ntures, systems or mechanisms working `behind the scenes' to produce and sustain the\nworld. Analysis instead must be `micropolitical', focusing entirely upon the processes\nwithin events to explain the social world. This monism may appear as a limitation of this\nperspective, rendering it unable to adequately explain social continuities and stabilities.\nHowever, the analysis of personal memory in this article suggests how the past may\ninfluence the present and future. Remembering (and forgetting), whether personal or\n`collective', supplies the means for the past to influence current and future events, though\nas we have seen these affects are unpredictable, and as the illustration showed, on occa-\nsions positive past food experiences can transmute into negative forces upon current\nfood events.\nAt the same time, as we also noted, memories are just one element within any event;\nconsequently, their effects will be balanced out by many other affective relations, many\nof which will favour novelty, discontinuity and change. Given that memories are not\nperfect records of the past, but are modified by the contexts at the points of both memo-\nrising and remembering, memories could never serve as a means to assure continuity \u00ad\nhowever much the architects of some collective remembering practices (statues,\nmonumental buildings) might wish. Nor may they be relied on to orchestrate change.\nThis leads us to the final area of significance: upon memory studies. We believe that\ninsight into the contribution of personal remembering (and forgetting) to social produc-\ntion requires a rebalancing of memory studies away from collective memory toward the\nmuch more common and pervasive realm of personal memories. While the memorialisa-\ntion of the past through the kinds of materialist events and objects discussed by scholars\nof collective memories remains of sociological import, we need to begin to design stud-\nies that can explore the impact of personal memory upon social production, continuity\nand change. This is a vast area of potential research, as personal memories encompass\ncognitive reactions to events, emotional responses and corporeal sensations such as\npleasure or disgust,5 as well as habitual memory (Connerton, 1989) that range from the\nmost unconscious processes such as walking and eating, to reading and recalling simple\nmultiplication tables, to everyday embodied tasks such as driving a car or mastering\nspecialist tools or musical instruments. At the same time, this link between memory and\nsocial production can reinvigorate studies of collective memory, to explore the affective\nflows within events where collective memories may be invoked or mobilised alongside\npersonal memories. Examples ripe for such exploration in terms of memories (personal\nand collective) and affects include popular uprisings, public mass grieving for celebrities\nor major sporting events (Fox, 2013, 2015), to generate further insights into the complex\nways in which memories affect social processes.\nThese three consequences of a focus upon personal memory have methodological\nimplications. Many qualitative sociological studies are replete with data on respondents'\nmemories, yet these are usually treated simply as ways to get at the experiences or events\nthat a study wishes to investigate. Instead, we need to develop materialist research studies\nthat are designed to explore personal memories as affective, and use interviews and obser-\nvations to reveal their part in producing continuity and/or change. Designs that will be\nsuited to this task will obviously include ethnography and qualitative interviews, but these\ncan usefully be augmented by surveys and perhaps social experiments, as well as more\ncreative approaches such as ambulatory interviews that can explore the memories trig-\ngered by a neighbourhood, house or work-space; group explorations of memories; and\naction research that attempts to use memories proactively to effect desired changes. Such\nstudies can begin to bridge the gap between sociology's focus on collective memory and\npsychological studies of cognitive processes in remembering and forgetting, contributing\nto the `post-disciplinarity' of the new materialisms (Taylor and Ivinson, 2013: 665).\nTo conclude, we have shown that from a materialist perspective, personal remember-\ning (and perhaps forgetting) must be taken seriously as a non-human force that affects the\nproduction and sustaining of the social world, and a potent source of affectivity that link\nevents and assemblages across time and space. Personal and collective memories serve\nas a virtual resource for social production, but their actualisation in events is unpredict-\nable and unstable. Along with other psychic products \u00ad such as imaginations, dreams and\npremonitions \u00ad memories permeate our lives and our social interactions. As such they\nneed to be acknowledged by sociology as contributory to how the social world unfolds,\nand no longer treated simply as a means to gain access to respondents' backgrounds,\nexperiences or beliefs.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: The research on food practices was funded by the National Institute\nfor Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, Yorkshire\nand Humber, and data collection was undertaken by Paul Bissell, Marian Peacock and Joanna\nBlackburn. The views and opinions expressed are those of the current authors, and not necessarily\nthose of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health.\nNotes\n1. The term `personal memory' is used to describe a memory held by an individual person, as\nopposed to a more widely held cultural or collective memory. We considered terming such\nadjectives have problematic or ambiguous connotations. Wherever possible in this article\nwe avoid sustaining the personal/collective opposition and refer to `memory' without further\nelaboration.\n2. The journal Memory Studies devoted an issue to memory and materiality in 2016.\n3. A more appropriate formulation might therefore speak of `remembering' and `forgetting' as\ncontextual processes. Subsequent uses of `memory' in this article should be understood in the\nlight of this qualification.\n4. The South Yorkshire Cohort was funded by the National Institute of Health Research, and\ncomprises more than 22,000 patients recruited from 42 general practices in South Yorkshire\nin 2010 who expressed willingness to participate in subsequent studies, including the research\nthat this article reports.\n5.
