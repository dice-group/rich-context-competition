The period of im-\nproved glycemic control in the inten-\nsively treated arm of the DCCT\ncontinues to yield potent reduction in\nrisk of microvascular disease well be-\nyond the period of intensive implemen-\ntation11 and the beneficial effect of gly-\ncemic control now extends to\nmacrovascular disease, indicated by re-\nduced carotid artery wall thicken-\ning.12 These latest observations should\nstrengthen public health efforts to trans-\nlate intensive glycemic control into\nclinical practice.\nImpressive evidence that intensive\ncontrol of blood pressure in adults with\ntype 2 diabetes prevents both micro-\nvascular and macrovascular diseases\nalso emerged during and after NHANES\ntients with diabetes should be lower\npertensive groups. The recommended\nblood pressure level was further re-\ntension increased significantly in the\ngeneral US population, and its preva-\nlence was associated with risk factors\nfor diabetes including older age, non-\nHispanic black race, and higher BMI.40\nWhen individuals with diabetes were\nexcluded from analysis, the preva-\nlence of hypertension was no longer sig-\nnificantly increased. That analysis of in-\ndividuals with diagnosed hypertension\nfound that the percentage of those with\ndiabetes and hypertension controlled to\nsignificantly (to 46.9%) in those with\ndiabetes. We found a small but statis-\ntically significant decrease in mean sys-\ntolic blood pressure in individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes and a small and non-\nsignificant increase in the fraction of\nparticipants with diabetes with nor-\nmal blood pressure. The new guide-\nlines for control of blood pressure is-\nsued near the conclusion of NHANES\nIII may have contributed to the small\nbut statistically significant decrease in\nmean systolic blood pressure in indi-\nviduals with diagnosed diabetes in\nbeen minimal, if any, effect in reduc-\ning the proportion of those with blood\ncollected just after clinical trials dem-\nonstrated that, by lowering lipid lev-\nels, individuals with diabetes can sub-\nstantially reduce the risk of developing\ncardiovascular disease.15 Moreover, in\nfactor for cardiovascular disease equiva-\nlent to having preexisting coronary ar-\ntery disease.41 The ADA guidelines on\nmanagement of lipid disorders issued\non these new data42 and the American\nsubsequently issued guidelines for lipid\nmanagement in diabetes. Thus the im-\nprovement in total cholesterol levels ob-\ncurred on the cusp of new data showing\nthe benefits of lowering lipid levels, and\nfurther reductions in total cholesterol\nlevels may be anticipated in the future\nas a result of dissemination of the new\nguidelines.\nProgress in improving risk factors for\nvascular disease among individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes in the United States\nover nearly a decade has been modest.\nWhile there has been increased aware-\nness among physicians and individuals\nwith diabetes of the use of HbA1c\nlevels\nto monitor glycemic control,23 only\n37.0% of adults with diagnosed diabe-\ntes in the United States are achieving the\nADA goal of HbA1c\nlevels less than 7.0%.\nIn addition, 37.2% of adults with diag-\nnosed diabetes have HbA1c\nlevels greater\nthan 8.0%, the level of additional treat-\nment action suggested by the ADA. Al-\nthough the percentage of adults with di-\nagnosed diabetes and diagnosed\nhypertension who use blood pressure\nmedication has increased in the past de-\ncade, only 35.8% of individuals with di-\nagnosed diabetes have achieved the cur-\nrent ADA blood pressure goal of less\ntensive blood pressure levels. Finally, al-\nthough the percentage of adults with di-\nagnosed high cholesterol levels has\nincreased and twice as many of these\nadults report taking medication for their\nviduals with diagnosed diabetes have\ntotal cholesterol levels greater than 200\nmg/dL(5.18mmol/L).Theincreaseduse\nof medication to control high choles-\nterol levels and high blood pressure has\nnot been accompanied by attention to\nlifestyle change; fewer adults with dia-\nbetesreporteatinglessfattocontrolcho-\nlesterolthanapproximatelyadecadeago,\nand there has been no change in the use\nof weight control or exercise to control\nlipid levels or blood pressure. Due to the\nsmall sample size, we were unable to\nstratify the analysis by previously diag-\nnosed high blood pressure or high cho-\nlesterol levels.\nBiological and behavioral character-\nistics of individuals with diagnosed dia-\nbetes are likely to affect control of risk\nfactors for vascular disease. The ear-\nlier age at diagnosis of diabetes in\nlier onset of disease or may be due to\nincreased screening for undiagnosed\ndiabetes leading to individuals being di-\nagnosed at an earlier point in the dis-\nease pathway. This earlier age at diag-\nnosis corresponded to a significantly\nreflect increased longevity due to bet-\nter treatment. The increase in BMI of\nadults with diagnosed diabetes in the\nUnited States over nearly a decade mir-\nrors the increase in prevalence of over-\nweight and obesity in the US popula-\ntion as a whole.44 Both longer duration\nof diabetes and increased BMI are likely\nto correspond to higher levels of gly-\ncemia, blood pressure, and choles-\nterol; however, these levels did not ap-\npear to increase over the past decade.\nThis may be due in part to the greater\nuse of medications for control of blood\nglucose levels, blood pressure, and cho-\nlesterol levels that was observed in\nprogress toward achieving guidelines\nfor therapy has been disappointing,\nmaintenance of levels of HbA1c\ncon-\ntrol, in the face of increased BMI and\nduration of diabetes, may reflect inten-\nsification of therapy. The greater im-\nprovement in cholesterol levels com-\npared with glycemic control may reflect\ndifferences in the complexity of the\nmedical regimens for these condi-\ntions, as well as the earlier initiation and\nbroader dissemination of messages from\nthe NCEP compared with the NDEP.\nThese factors could influence both pre-\nscription of and adherence to therapy.\nA major limitation of this study is the\nsmall number of participants with di-\ngroups, specifically by age, race/\nethnicity, or treatment group. In\naddition, the surveys only include non-\ninstitutionalized adults. There were\ninformation on risk factors for vascu-\nlar disease among these individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes. In addition, the\nNHANES surveys are cross-sectional in\ndesign. Although we can draw infer-\nences on trends among participants\nwithdiagnoseddiabetes,differentadults\nparticipated in each survey and there-\nfore we cannot draw conclusions on\ntemporal relationships of observa-\ntions.\nRapidly increasing rates of type 2 dia-\nbetes in the United States have been at-\ntributed to aging of the population, in-\ncreased prevalence of overweight and\nobesity, and decreased physical activ-\nhere a slight trend for an increase in the\noverall prevalence of previously diag-\nnosed diabetes among adults aged 20\nyears and older, although the change\nwas not significantly different.

The 95% confi-\ndence interval for the change in the\nprevalence of diagnosed diabetes be-\ntween the 2 surveys ranges from a de-\ncrease of 0.34 percentage points to an\nincrease of 1.98 percentage points.
