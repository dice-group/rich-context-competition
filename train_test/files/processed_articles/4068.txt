We also investigated the\nunderlying mechanism of AT2\n-mediated atheroprotective\naction. Our results demonstrated for the first time that\ndeficiency accelerates the development of athero-\nsclerosis, and liver X receptor  (LXR)-mediated anti-\natherogenic actions such as anti-inflammatory response,\ncholesterol efflux, and emigration-related gene expression\nwere attenuated in AT2\n-deficient macrophages. Our find-\nings support the notion that direct AT2\nactivation could be\na potential therapeutic option for preventing the develop-\nment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nApoE-/- mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Taconic Co.\nLtd (Germantown, NY, USA) and AT2\nreceptor-deficient\n(Agtr2-/-) mice (C57BL/6) were kindly provided by Dr. M.\nHoriuchi (Ehime University). Agtr2-/- mice were crossed\nwith apoE-/- mice. Heterozygous animals were crossed\nuntil homozygous double knockout (Agtr2-/-/apoE-/-)\nmice were obtained (backcrossed more than 10 times).\nTwo-month-old female apoE-/- recipient mice were\nlethally irradiated at 9 Gy using an X-ray source. BM cells\nwere harvested from the femurs and tibias of donor male\nmice (Agtr2-/-/apoE-/- or Agtr2+/+/apoE-/-) by flushing\nwith RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL), and then recipi-\nmedium by tail-vein injection. Two months after BM trans-\nplantation, all mice started to receive a high-cholesterol\ndiet (36% fat, 1.25% cholesterol; OrientalYeast Co., Tokyo,\nJapan) for an additional 2 months. The animals were housed\nin a room that was maintained at 22\u00b0C under a 12-h light/\ndark cycle and were provided with drinking water ad libi-\ntum. Before the tissues (aortas) were harvested, mice were\neuthanized by trans-cardiac perfusion under terminal\nanesthesia induced by intraperitoneal administration of\npentobarbital (200 mg/kg). All investigations conformed to\nthe Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Kyoto\nPrefectural University of Medicine, following approval by\na local university ethics review board.\nHemodynamic analysis\nMean blood pressure and heart rate were measured under\nconscious and unrestrained conditions using a programma-\nble sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan).\nPlasma lipid analysis\nTotal cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were\ndetermined using an automated chemistry analyzer (Wako\nChemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). Low density lipoprotein\n(LDL)-cholesterol levels were quantified by an enzymatic\nreaction using a commercially available kit (Daiichi Pure\nChemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan).\nQuantitative measurement of atherosclerotic\nlesions\nThe mice were euthanized at 24 weeks and the atheroscle-\nrotic lesions were analyzed. Image analysis was performed\non Oil Red O-stained aortas using Scion Imaging software\n(Informer Technologies, Inc. Shingle Springs, USA). The\naortic lesion area in each animal was measured as a per-\ncentage of the total aortic area.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFor immunohistochemical analysis, the aortic root was rap-\nidly removed after phosphate buffered saline (PBS) perfu-\nsion, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound,\nand quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The atherosclerotic\nlesions in the aortic root region were examined at five loca-\ntions at 100-\u00b5m intervals, and stained immunohistochemi-\ncally with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated\nantibodies against monocyte/macrophage antibody-2\n(MOMA-2; Serotec, Oxford, UK), and then observed using\na confocal microscope (FLUOVIEW FV300; Olympus,\nTokyo, Japan). As a negative control, non-immune immu-\nnoglobulin and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies\nwere used. Positive MOMA-2 staining was evaluated using\nimage-analysis software. Coverage of the MOMA-2-\nstained area as a percentage of the total plaque area was\nassessed in five sections from six animals in each group.\nIsolation of bone marrow-derived macrophages\n(BMDMs) and polarization assay\nPrimary cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages\nwere obtained from femurs and tibias of 8\u00ad12-week-old\nAgtr2+/+ or Agtr2-/- mice and cultured in complete\n938 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nmedium (Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supple-\nmented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 800 pg/ml mac-\nmedium)). Non-adherent cells were collected after 24 h\nand were differentiated for seven days, yielding 98%\nF4/80+ cells (data not shown). Differentiated bone mar-\nrow-derived macrophages were polarized with either 100\nng/ml LPS+100 U/ml interferon gamma (IFN) (M1) or 5\nIsolation of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal\nmacrophages (TGPMs) and lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS)-induced inflammatory response\nPeritoneal exudate cells were harvested from the perito-\nneal cavities of wild-type (Agtr2+/+) and Agtr2-/- mice\nfour days after an intra-peritoneal injection of 2.0 ml of 3%\nsterile thioglycollate medium. After 6 h of incubation,\nnon-adherent cells were removed. Flow cytometric analy-\nsis showed that more than 90% of the adherent cells were\npositive for F4/80. After 18 h of incubation, isolated\nTGPMs were stimulated by 100 ng/ml of LPS for 6 h.\nLPS stimulation.\nRNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR)\nRNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy mini kit\nor RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The\nobtained RNAwas reversely transcribed with SuperScriptR\nIII First-Strand kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative\nreal time RT-PCR was carried out using a LightCycler\nST300 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with\nLightCycler FastStart DNA Masterplus SYBR Green I kit\n(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The dis-\nsociation curves were monitored to check for aberrant\nprimer dimer formation. PCR-amplified products were\nelectrophoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the pres-\nence of a single band. Data are expressed as levels relative\nto the Agtr2+/+ mice.\nWestern blotting\nTGPMs were harvested and homogenized in Eppendorf\ncontaining 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (w/v), 10%\nglycerol, 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1% bromophe-\nnol blue (w/v)). The cell lysates were sonicated for 2 s,\nfor 2 min at 4\u00b0C. Small aliquots (20 l) of the supernatants\nwere subjected to polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophore-\nsis containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and\nthen transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-P,\nAmersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, USA).\nThe membrane was then blotted using the LXR antibodies\n(LXR: sc-1001; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa\nCruz, USA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with\nan enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system\n(Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) followed by expo-\nsure to Kodak X-ray film.\nFlow cytometric analysis\nTGPMs were detached from culture plates using cell dis-\nsociation buffer (GIBCO BRL, San Francisco, USA) and\nanalyzed by FACSCalibur (Becton, Dickinson and\nCompany, Franklin Lakes, USA). The antibodies used for\nanalysis were PE-conjugated anti-F4/80 (eBioscience, Inc.\nSan Diego, USA) and PerCP-CyTM5.5-conjugated anti-\nCCR7 (Becton, Dickinson and Company).\nCholesterol efflux assay\nPeritoneal macrophages were obtained as described above\nand cholesterol efflux was evaluated as described previ-\nously.15 After washing, 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well were plated on an\neight-well -slide in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium\n(DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 U/\nml penicillin/streptomycin and were grown overnight.\nCells were then incubated with NBD-cholesterol (0.35\nM) in the above medium containing 2.5% FBS for 1 h at\n37\u00b0C. Cells were washed twice with Puck's buffer (1 mM\nHEPES) and placed in serum-free medium. The fluores-\ncence-labeled cholesterol released from the cells into the\nmedium was measured with a multi-label counter.\nCholesterol efflux was evaluated as a percentage of fluo-\nrescence in the medium relative to the total amount of\nfluorescence (cells and medium), and expressed as levels\nrelative to the Agtr2+/+ mice.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error (SE). Mean\nvalues were compared using analysis of variance. If a statis-\ntically significant effect was found, Scheffe's F test was per-\nformed to detect the difference between groups. Values of P\n< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\ndeficiency exaggerates atherosclerosis\ndevelopment in apoE-/- mice\nEight weeks after BM transplantation, 16-week-old chi-\nmeric mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 2 months.\nThe atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly larger\nin apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2-/- mice than that in apoE-/-/\naccompanied by an augmented accumulation of lesion\nmacrophages (Figure 1(c) and (d)). Hemodynamic data\n(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) did not differ between the\ntwo groups before and after the high-cholesterol diet. Lipid\nprofile (Supplemental Table 3) and circulating blood cell\ncounts (Supplemental Table 4) after 8 weeks of a high-cho-\nlesterol diet were also equivalent between the two groups,\nsuggesting that the BM-AT2\nreceptor plays a crucial role in\nthe pathogenesis of atherosclerosis development.\ndeficiency has no effect on phenotypic\npolarization of BM-derived macrophages\nMacrophage phenotype has been conventionally divided\ninto two classes: inflammatory M1 macrophages and\nresident M2 macrophages, induced by IFN- or IL-4,\nrespectively.12 First, we examined the effect of BM-AT2\non BMDM polarization. The expression levels of M1\nmarkers, such as TNF-, CXCL10, iNOS, and ICAM-1,\nwere equivalent between the two groups before polariza-\ntion. Stimulation with IFN- significantly increased the\nexpression of M1 markers in both Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-\nBMDMs, with no discernible difference between the two\ngroups except for iNOS gene expression (Figure 2(a)).\nLikewise, the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206\nand Arg1, was comparable between Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-\nBMDMs before and after stimulation with IL-4 (Figure\n2(b)), suggesting that BM-AT2\ndid not affect BMDM\npolarization elicited by IFN- or IL-4. We further com-\npared LPS-induced M1 polarization between Agtr2+/+\nand Agtr2-/- TGPMs. Flow cytometric analysis showed\nno difference in F4/80 expression between Agtr2+/+ and\nAgtr2-/- TGPMs (Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B). AT1\nreceptor mRNA expression levels, as well as F4/80 and\nCD68, did not differ between the two groups\n(Supplemental Figure 1C). LPS-induced expressions of\ninflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6,\nwere significantly elevated in both Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-\nTGPMs; however, no significant difference could be\nobserved between the two groups (Figure 2(c)), suggest-\ning that LPS-induced macrophage polarization was not\naffected by AT2\ndeficiency.\ndeficiency remarkably attenuates LXR\nexpression in TGPMs\nNext, we examined the mRNA expression levels of LXR\nand LXR, which are a nuclear receptor superfamily of\nFigure 1.

These findings sug-\ngest that the LXR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was\nimpaired in Agtr2-/- TGPMs.\ndeficiency reduces ABCA1 expression and\ncholesterol efflux in TGPMs\nNext, we examined the effect of AT2\ndeficiency on ATP-\nbinding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) expression, which\nis transcriptionally regulated by LXR.21 ABCA1 mRNA\nexpression was significantly reduced in Agtr2-/- TGPMs\nby 31% compared with Agtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 5(a)).\nConsistently with this finding, cholesterol efflux was sub-\n(Figure 5(b)), suggesting that the LXR-mediated increase\nin ABCA1 expression and its anti-atherogenic properties\nwere impaired in apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2-/- mice.\ndeficiency inhibits CCR7 expression in\nWe further examined the effect of AT2\ndeficiency on CCR7\nexpression, which is up-regulated by LXR activation and\ncontributes to macrophage emigration from the atheroscle-\nrotic lesions.22 CCR7 mRNA expression was substantially\nreduced by 58% in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with\nAgtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 6(a)).

GW: GW3965, LXR agonist; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TGPMs: thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we demonstrated for the first time that\ndeficiency markedly exaggerated atherosclero-\nsis development with an augmented accumulation of\nlesion macrophages. Although phenotypic polarization of\nBM-derived macrophages was not affected by AT2\ndefi-\nciency, mRNA and protein expression levels of LXR,\nwhich belongs to a nuclear receptor family of ligand-\ndependent transcriptional factors exerting anti-atherogenic\nproperties,16\u00ad20 were significantly decreased in AT2\n-\ndeficient TGPMs. While LXR agonist treatment signifi-\ncantly inhibited LPS-induced proinflammatory response\nin wild-type TGPMs, it was markedly ameliorated in\n-deficient TGPMs. Moreover, mRNA expression lev-\nels of ABCA1 and CCR7, transcriptionally up-regulated\nby LXR activation,21,22 showed significant decreases in\n-deficient TGPMs, accompanied by markedly\nreduced cholesterol efflux. These findings suggest that\nLXR-mediated anti-atherogenic action was substan-\ntially impaired in BM-AT2\n-deficient chimeric mice and\nsupport the notion that direct AT2\nactivation could be a\npotential therapeutic strategy to prevent the development\nof atherosclerotic diseases.\nLiver X receptors (LXR/), members of the nuclear\nreceptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription fac-\ntors, were originally thought to control lipid metabo-\nlism.23,24 The LXR isoform is highly expressed in the\nliver and plays a dominant role in hepatic lipogenesis,\nthereby promoting triglyceride synthesis.24 Considering\ndeficiency has no effect on LXR expression\n(Figure 3(a)), the AT2\n-mediated antiatherogenic effect\ncould be exerted without stimulating hepatic lipogenesis.\nOn the other hand, LXR is ubiquitously expressed and\nhas been found to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-prolif-\nerative effects.25 Levin et al. demonstrated that the ability\nof the LXR agonist to inhibit atherosclerosis progression\nwas lost in mice transplanted with BM lacking macrophage\nLXR expression,26 suggesting that macrophage LXR may\nbe a potential therapeutic target to prevent atherosclerosis\ndevelopment. Moreover, LXR activation has been\nreported to increase the expression of ABCA-1 and CCR7\nin macrophages, which are closely implicated with choles-\nterol efflux and macrophage emigration from atheroscle-\nrotic plaque lesions.21,22 Systemic administration of the\nLXR agonist has been reported not only to inhibit athero-\nsclerosis progression but also to cause regression of estab-\nlished atherosclerotic lesions.26,27 Since the mRNA and\nrelative mRNA levels\nCholesterol efflux\n(a) (b)\ndeficiency attenuates ABCA1 gene expression and cholesterol efflux.\n(a) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA expression levels of ABCA1 showing a significant decrease in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with\nAgtr2+/+ TGPMs. Values are the mean \u00b1 SE for at least six mice in each group. *P < 0.01 vs. Agtr2+/+ TGPMs. (b) Cholesterol efflux from TGPMs\nprepared from Agtr2-/- and Agtr2+/+ mice showing a significant decrease in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with Agtr2+/+ TGPMs. Values are the mean \u00b1 SE\nrelative to Agtr2+/+ TGPMs for at least six mice in each group. *P < 0.05 vs. Agtr2+/+ TGPMs. TGPMs: thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages.\n944 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nprotein expression levels of CCR7 decreased in AT2\n-\ndeficient TGPMs, AT2\n-mediated anti-atherogenic action is\nlikely to be involved in the regression of atherosclerotic\nplaques by augmenting emigration of monocytes/mac-\nrophages from atherosclerotic lesions.\nThe underlying mechanism of AT2\n-mediated regulation\nof LXR gene expression remains to be elucidated. The AT2\nreceptor has been shown to be associated with the activation\nof a series of phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phos-\nphatase SHP-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase phos-\nphatase-1 (MKP-1), and serine/threonine phosphatase 2A\n(PP2A).28\u00ad32 In silico analysis of promoter sequences identi-\nfied the binding sites of NFATC2, a transcriptional factor of\nthe Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) superfamily,\nin the LXR promoter region (data not shown). While phos-\nphorylated NFATC2 is located in the cytoplasm, dephospho-\nrylated NFATC2 moves into the nucleus and binds to the\npromoter region to regulate gene expression.33 Interestingly,\nactivation has been demonstrated to induce diphospho-\nrylation of NFATC2 and promote the binding of NFATC2 to\nthe eNOS promoter region, resulting in increased eNOS\nexpression in rat cardiomyocytes.34 These findings suggest\n-mediated dephosphorylation of NFATC2 is likely to\nenhance its binding to the LXR promoter region, leading to\nincreased expression of LXR.\nLXR activation has been reported to lessenAT1\nexpression\nvia dephosphorylation of Sp1.35 Likewise, Takata et al.\nreported that ABCA1 gene expression was inhibited via AT1\nactivation.36 To exclude the possibility that augmented\ninflammatory response and reduced gene expression of\n-deficientTGPMscanbeattributedtoincreased\nactivation, we examinedAT1\nreceptor mRNAexpression.\nreceptor mRNA expression levels did not differ between\n-deficient and wild-type TGPMs (Supplemental Figure\n1(c)), suggesting that AT2\n-mediated anti-atherogenic actions\nare not dependent on AT1\n-mediated effects.\nIsotype\ncontrol\nrelative mRNA levels\n*\nGeometric mean\n(b)\n(a)\n(%)\ndeficiency attenuates mRNA and protein expression of CCR7.\n(a) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA expression levels of CCR7 showing a significant decrease in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with\nAgtr2+/+ TGPMs for at least six mice in each group. *P < 0.05 vs. Agtr2+/+ TGPMs. (b) Flow cytometry for CCR7 expression in TGPMs from Agtr2-/-\nand Agtr2+/+ mice. Quantitative analysis showing a significant inhibition of CCR7 expression in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with Agtr2+/+ TGPMs.\nTGPMs: thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages.\nRecently, compound 21 (C21), a nonpeptide, orally\nactive, and selective AT2\nagonist has been developed.37\nDirect AT2\nstimulation by C21 has been reported to exert\nbeneficial effects on cardiac and vascular function in\nrodents through an increased production of NO and/or sup-\npression of the inflammatory response.38,39 Rompe et al.\nreported that C21 treatment significantly reduced TNF--\ninduced IL-6 mRNA levels in primary human and murine\ndermal fibroblasts.40 They also showed that injection of\nbleomycin into murine skin resulted in significantly ele-\nvated mRNA expression levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-\n, which were markedly reduced by C21 treatment. Our\nfindings support the notion that AT2\nstimulation exerts\nanti-atherogenic actions and could be a potential therapeu-\ntic strategy for producing a clinically beneficial effect on\nthe cardiovascular system.\nIn conclusion, AT2\ndeficiency in macrophages markedly\ninhibited LXR-mediated anti-inflammatory response,\nABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, and migration-related\nCCR7 expression. AT2\n-mediated regulation of macrophage\nLXR expression was mostly attributable to the atheropro-\ntective effect of bone marrow AT2\nreceptor. These findings\nprovide novel evidence for the bone marrow AT2\n-mediated\nanti-atherogenic actions and new insight into the mecha-\nnism for AT2\n-mediated effect on atherosclerosis.\n"
