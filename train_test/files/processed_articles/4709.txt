Participants also perceived female managers' speech as more emotional than male managers'. After\ntraining, participants thought that men's and White managers' speech would become more emotional, despite the fact that\nthis training has been targeted specifically at female managers.Overall,our findings highlight the importance of examining race\nand gender in evaluating managerial communication.\n",

Stereotypes may actually prevent\neffective communication between people (Biernat & Vescio,\nindicated that when White women deviate from stereotypes\nby speaking assertively, they may be judged negatively as a\nbe particularly true for women in leadership positions because\nthey already face a trade-off between being perceived as like-\nable or competent (Eagly & Karau, 2002). It is also likely that\nthis double bind exists for other stigmatized groups in the\nworkplace, such as ethnic minorities.\nPrevious studies have documented that gender and racial\nstereotypes (specifically, stereotypes regarding African\nAmericans) include beliefs about communication style\nexception (Popp et al., 2003), however, studies have failed to\nexamine race and gender stereotypes about speech style in the\nsame study. This is problematic because research has found\nthat separate examination of race and gender categories can\nMore specifically, this research has found that when partici-\npants are not made explicitly aware of a target's gender or\nrace, they default to the categories of White and male.\nIn Popp et al.'s (2003) study, gender and race stereotypes\nwere jointly investigated by having White college students\ncategorize the speech style of a fictional Black male, Black\nfemale, White male, or White female college student.\nParticipants rated targets' typical talk style using 31 bipolar\nwords and phrases (e.g., emotional\u00adunemotional, articu-\nlate\u00adinarticulate, soft\u00adloud, active\u00adpassive). The results\nindicated that Black people's speech, in general, was viewed\nas more direct, less socially appropriate, more emotional,\nless playful, and tending to be more dominant than White\npeople's speech. Women's speech was believed to be more\nemotional and slightly less direct than men's speech. Thus,\ngender and race affected perceptions of speech style. The\neffects for race were stronger than those for gender.\nHowever, the two variables did not interact, suggesting that\na target's communication style might be judged according to\nwhether race or gender is more salient in a particular situa-\ntion. These findings are important not only in the context of\nPopp et al.'s study but also in other areas where people\ninteract and communicate, such as the workplace.\nResearchers have dedicated an increasing amount of study\nto stigmatized groups, and how stigma is related to status and\nhierarchy.

Manifestations of gender- and racial dis-\ncrimination in the workplace can be subtle but are important\nto examine because they can have significant consequences.\nAlthough women account for about 50% of managerial and\nprofessional positions in organizations today, the percentage\nof women in top managerial positions remains in the single\nWomen hold only 15.2% of corporate officer jobs in Fortune\nation exists for Black managers. Current statistics indicate\nthat Black men account for 2.9% of managers and officials,\nwhereas Black women account for 2% of the total number\n(Nkomo & Cox, 1990). Moreover, women of color account\nfor only 3.2% of Fortune 500 corporate officers (Catalyst,\n2008). Scholars have hypothesized that a \"double stigma\"\nexists for women of color making it even more difficult for\nthem to obtain leadership positions in the workplace (Botsford\nMorgan, Gilrane, McCausland, & King, 2011).\nThe goals of this study were twofold. First, we aimed to\nreplicate and extend Popp et al.'s (2003) study of communi-\ncation stereotypes by using the same design but using a\nsample of working adults rather than the college students\nused in the original study, and by changing the targets to\nWhite male, White female, Black male, and Black female\nmanagers. Our second goal was to examine whether partici-\npants drew upon communication stereotypes in assessing\nthe effects of a social skills training program on the com-\nmunication style and managerial effectiveness of targets.\nTheoretical Underpinnings for the Stigma\nof Female and Minority Leaders\nThe social stigma of female leaders can be explained by role\ncongruity theory, which is based on social role theory, and\nthe stereotype fit hypothesis. The former posits that the\nsocial role of being \"feminine\" is incongruent with the social\nrole of being a \"leader,\" which occurs because people\nobserve men in management roles and then correlate the\ncharacteristics of men with the definition of an effective\nleader (Eagly & Karau, 2002). In support of this assertion,\nEagly and Karau (2002) also found that female managers are\nseen as effective when characteristics such as cooperation or\naffiliation are required, a situation in which there is per-\nceived congruence between the two roles. However, Eagly,\nMakhijani, and Klonsky (1992) found that women who lead\nin an autocratic, stereotypically masculine way are evaluated\nnegatively. This role incongruity results in three main conse-\nquences for women in management: They are evaluated less\nfavorably than comparable men, they have more difficulty\nbecoming leaders than men, and they are not recognized as\nbeing as effective as men (Eagly & Karau, 2002).\nHeilman's (2001) concept of stereotype fit leads to a com-\nparable hypothesis, which can help to explain the manager-\nas-White stereotype. The thinking here is that stereotypes of\nmanagers and ethnic minorities might not coincide, or \"fit\"\nwith one another. In support of this hypothesis, Tomkiwicz,\nBrenner, and Adeyemi-Bello (1998) found that participants'\nratings of Whites and managers were significantly corre-\nlated, whereas the relationship between perceptions of\nBlacks and managers were not. In other words, they found\nthat managers were judged to have attributes more typically\nassociated with Whites than Blacks. Moreover, there is a\nrelatively large body of literature documenting Black\u00adWhite\ndifferentials in performance appraisals. These findings were\nconfirmed in Roth, Huffcut, and Bobko's (2003) meta-anal-\nysis, which found that Whites were rated more highly than\nBlacks on objective performance measures. Similarly, Cox\nand Nkomo (1986) used the performance appraisal ratings of\n125 first-level managers to investigate the extent to which\ncriteria for Black and White managers differed. They found\nthat social-behavioral factors were more strongly correlated\nwith the job performance of Black managers. Finally,\nGreenhaus, Parasuraman, and Wormley (1990) found that\nBlack managers felt less accepted in their organizations,\nreceived lower performance and promotion ratings from\nsupervisors, and had a lower amount of career satisfaction,\nas compared with White managers.\nGender and Racial Stereotypes of Speech\nThere is a generally held belief that women and men speak\ntion styles are very often portrayed as dichotomous. Lakoff\n(1975) identified a cluster of speech features that she believed\nconstituted a distinctive \"women's language\" style convey-\ning hesitancy and powerlessness. Tannen (1990) theorized\nthat girls and boys learn different communication styles from\nearly childhood, and characterized their speech as \"report\ntalk\" (for men) and \"rapport talk\" (for women). Mulac and\nhis colleagues have conducted an extensive research program\naimed at uncovering gendered speech features (Mulac,\n2006). Researchers have looked for sex differences in emo-\ntional communication (Guerrero, Jones, & Boburka, 2006),\ninstigating and detecting deception (Burgoon, Blair, Buller,\nand many other features and types of speech style. It is only\nrecently that the search for sex differences has been put in a\nlarger context of differences and similarities (Dindia &\nCanary, 2006) and considered from a social constructionist\nOverall, research from the 1970s onward has found that\nmen's speech is stereotyped as articulate, forceful, aggres-\nsive, dominating, and blunt, whereas women's speech is\ncharacterized as polite, emotional, talkative, gentle, and\nlacking in humor (Crawford, 2003; Crawford & Gressley,\nconfirms that these stereotypes remain as social prescrip-\ntions: Speakers still are sanctioned for violating gendered\nconversational expectations. In other words, to be\nCarlson and Crawford 3\nconsidered socially appropriate, speakers should adhere to\nSimilarly, research indicates that Black people's speech\nis stereotyped as loud and aggressive (Hughes & Baldwin,\n2003). The little empirical research that has been done in\nthis area indicates that White participants typically rate\nBlack people's speech as being more emotional, aggressive,\ntalkative, straightforward, and argumentative--in sum, less\nsocially appropriate (Leonard & Locke, 1993; Niemann,\nLeonard and Locke's (1993) research indicates that racial\nstereotypes of speech may also be dichotomous in nature.\nWhen asked to describe the speech of White people and\nBlack people on a 21-item adjective checklist, their partici-\npants differentiated between Whites and Blacks on 18 of the\nGender, Race, and Managerial\nEffectiveness Interventions\nSolutions to the lack of parity in management would require\nchange at many levels; however, most interventions, have\nfocused on the individual level, and most have focused on\nwomen, implicitly on White women. These change efforts\nassume that women are in need of compensatory training.\nExamples include assertiveness training programs, special\ncourses designed for women in management, and self-help\nbooks that provide tips on getting ahead in corporate America\nWhite, 1995). A large amount of self-help literature in the\nincrease their assertiveness--the underlying message being\nthat women should stop being doormats and stand up for\nthemselves (e.g., Bloom, Coburn, & Perlman, 1975).\nIn recent years, however, there has been a growing back-\nlash which recommends training in the opposite direction,\nsuggesting that women are too assertive or even aggressive.\nFor example, Hollands's (2002) Same Game Different\nRules: How to Get Ahead Without Being a Bully Broad, Ice\nQueen, or \"Ms. Understood\" offers management strategies\nto female managers and executives. Her self-improvement\nstrategies include using a softer voice, adopting a submis-\nsive body language, smiling when speaking, dressing less\n\"militantly,\" learning to apologize more, even disparaging\noneself and affecting a stammer to appear less threatening\nto others. These strategies prescribe many of the same\nbehaviors that the assertiveness training of the 1970s and\n1980s sought to eliminate. Indeed, the executive Bully\nBoss training program (GLC website, n.d.-a) can be thought\nof as \"anti-assertiveness\" training.\nAs Ashcraft and Allen (2003) pointed out, organizational\ncommunication scholars have focused increasingly on how\norganizations are gendered, yet ignored the ways in which\nthey are raced. Allen (2007) argued that research has drawn\nfrom and circulated \"White universalistic paradigms\nwithout problematizing or even acknowledging Eurocentric\nlimits . . . [and that] . . . this bias impedes our discipline from\neffecting social change related to race\" (p. 259). Although\nHollands's (2002) intervention is particular to women, it can\nbe argued that the same type of self-help strategies might be\nperceived as improving all nonnormative groups as stereo-\ntypes of these groups'communication styles do not coincide\nwith White men's.\nThere are numerous problems with individualistic\napproaches to gender and racial inequalities in the work-\nplace. First, they ignore important interactional and social\nstructural level changes that need to be made for women and\nethnic minorities to achieve equality in management.\nSecond, they are implicitly White and do not encompass\ndiversity. Finally, they create double bind situations for\nwomen and ethnic minorities in management. More specifi-\ncally, they create a trade-off between perceived competence\nand perceived likeability. Individual-level interventions are\nparticularly troublesome given that reviews of gender and\nassertiveness show few gender differences and that these\ndifferences are even smaller in African American popula-\nIn this study, Hollands's (2002) self-help \"Bully Broad\"\nintervention was made gender neutral (\"Bully Boss\") and\nused as stimulus material that participants evaluated. The\ntheoretical rationale for using this particular intervention\nwas that it contained self-help advice for female managers\nin particular. Furthermore, after reviewing the most recent\nself-help literature geared toward managers, this interven-\ntion was one of the more publicized, as evidenced by\nfrequent appearances in the media, and was even the basis\nfor the plot in one episode of the television show Ally\nMcBeal (http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Silicon+Valley+\nAuthor+Jean+Hollands+Appears+on+Oxygen+Network's\nitself to our purposes because it was not only a self-help text\nbut also a program to which companies could pay to send\ntheir employees, thus creating a \"training\" intervention that\ncould be evaluated by participants.\nIn sum, we know that there are stereotypes about women\nand men's communication styles; more specifically, that men\ntend to be dominant and forceful, whereas women tend to be\nsoft and polite. These stereotypes may be weaker than in the\npast, but they are still there (Popp et al., 2003). We also know\nthat there are stereotypes about African Americans' commu-\nnication style, for example, being loud and inappropriate,\nand these stereotypes may be quite strong (Popp et al., 2003).\nHowever, we do not know much about how these gender and\nracial stereotypes interact, how general they are, how they\nextend to targets other than college students, or how they\naffect perceptions of competence and effectiveness. This\nstudy replicates and extends previous research by (a) exam-\nining gender and racial speech stereotypes of managers from\n4 SAGE Open\nthe perspective of working adults, (b) jointly studying gen-\nder and race, and (c) investigating the perceived effect of a\nfemale-targeted social skills training on White male, White\nfemale, Black male, and Black female managers' communi-\ncation style and managerial effectiveness.\nHypotheses\nBased on our review of the relevant literature, the following\nhypotheses were generated:\nHypothesis 1: It was expected that pre-training com-\nmunication style stereotypes of race would rep-\nlicate those found in Popp et al.'s (2003) study,\nspecifically that Black targets would be rated as\nmore dominant and emotional, and less socially\nappropriate than White targets.\nHypothesis 2: We hypothesized that female manag-\ners may be stereotyped differently than in Popp et\nal.'s (2003) study due to their higher status position,\nsuch that a \"Bully Broad\" stereotype might emerge\nwhich would counter traditional stereotypes of\nwomen (i.e., female managers may be perceived as\nmore dominant, and less socially appropriate than\ntheir male counterparts).\nHypothesis 3: Regarding communication effective-\nness, it was expected that nonnormative groups'\n(e.g., Black and female) speech would be perceived\nas improving more than the normative groups (e.g.,\nWhite and male) as a result of \"Bully Boss\" training\nbecause they are perceived to need it more.\nHypothesis 4: In line with expectations about changes\nin communication style, it was also predicted\nthat nonnormative groups would be perceived as\nimproving in terms of their managerial effective-\nness as a result of the training, whereas normative\ngroups would be viewed as unchanged or nega-\ntively affected by the training.\nHypothesis 5: Finally, it was expected that, when rat-\ning nonnormative groups, participants would be\nmore in favor of company policies that give access\nto or require \"Bully Boss\" training.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were working adults who were recruited by\nstudents in undergraduate psychology courses as part of an\nextra credit assignment. Students were instructed to recruit\nparticipants who were currently employed full-time, to tar-\nget as many different fields of work as possible, and to\npreserve anonymity by having participants seal their com-\npleted surveys in unmarked envelopes and send them\ndirectly to the first author. Surveys were collected from 157\njob incumbents. In all, 67 job titles were represented in the\nsample. The most frequently occurring job titles were man-\nager (n = 21), administrative assistant (n = 12), teacher (n =\n11), accountant (n = 5), and engineer (n = 5). Examples of\nother titles included consultant, interior designer, social\nworker, postal employee, firefighter, project analyst, nurse\npractitioner, financial advisor, lawyer, and sales associate.\nParticipant ages ranged from 20 years to 73 years (M =\n= 12.12). Fifty-five percent of the respondents were women,\n84% were White or nonminority, 5% were Black/African\nAmerican, 3% were Hispanic/Latino/Latina, 7% were\nAsian/Asian American, and 1% was Native American. As in\nPopp et al. (2003), participants who did not self-identify as\nWhite were removed for methodological and theoretical\nreasons, yielding a final sample of 133 White participants,\nProcedure\nParticipants were told that they were taking part in a study\nabout management training. Modeling the procedure from\nPopp et al.'s (2003) study, participants were randomly\nassigned to one of four experimental conditions based on\nthe target's race and sex (i.e., White male manager, White\nfemale manager, Black male manager, or Black female\nmanager) and were then asked to rate the average or typical\ntarget group member's \"usual everyday communication\nstyle\" on 31 bipolar items which ranged from 1 to 7. Some\nexample items are \"sensitive\u00adinsensitive,\" \"polite\u00adimpo-\nlite,\" \"strong\u00adweak,\" \"competent\u00adincompetent.\" For exam-\nple, in the Black female condition,\nPlease rate the following adjectives on the extent to\nwhich they reflect the usual, everyday communication\nstyle of the typical Black female manager, boss and\nexecutive on a scale from 1 to 7. We are asking for\nyour opinion about this group in general. Please\ndescribe the average, or typical, Black female manag-\ner's communication style in your ratings.\nEach participant was then given a vignette to read\nregarding \"Bully Boss Syndrome\" and its associated anti-\nbully training, which was explained to be particularly use-\nful with their target's group (see the appendix for vignette;\nthe description was generated using phrasing and wording\nfrom Hollands's [2002] book). The last sentence of the\nvignette varied based on target group. For example, the last\nline of the vignette in the Black female condition read as\nfollows:\nThis training has been found to be particularly useful\nwith Black female managers, bosses and executives.\nCarlson and Crawford 5\nTherefore, the remainder of these materials will focus\non Black women as participants.\nNext, participants were asked to rate what effect they\nbelieved this training would have on the typical target group\nmember's behaviors and outcomes on a scale ranging from 1\n(very negative effect) to 5 (very positive effect). This scale\nconsisted of 10 items that were developed for this study:\n\"role as a leader,\" \"role as coworker,\" \"being liked,\" \"ability\nto get ahead (move up to a higher level of management) in a\ncompany,\" \"productivity,\" \"effectiveness as a manager,\"\n\"general job performance,\" \"being taken seriously,\" \"benefit\nfrom the training,\" and \"effectiveness in change (as a result\nof training).\" Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency\nParticipants were also asked to indicate the extent to\nwhich they agreed with four statements regarding organiza-\ntional policies about the training, on a scale ranging from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Again, these state-\nments were developed for this study and included \"This\ntraining program would be a waste of a company's Human\nResources budget,\" \"There is no reason for companies to\nprovide this training as an employee benefit,\" \"This training\nwould be useless in general (for any manager who took it),\"\nand \"Companies should require this training.\" Cronbach's\nalpha for internal consistency was .87.\nNext, participants were presented with the same 31 bipo-\nlar adjective items from the beginning of the survey, in a\ndifferent order, and were asked to rate the typical target\ngroup member's communication style after participating in\n\"Bully Boss\" training. Again, responses ranged from 1 to 7.\nSpeech items were combined using the factor structure in\nPopp et al.'s (2003) study. In that study, the two strongest\nfactors were social appropriateness, consisting of 14 items\n(e.g., sensitive, polite, pleasant, intelligent, warm, compe-\ntent, inoffensive, soft, cooperative, does not interrupt), and\ndominance, consisting of 7 items (e.g., strong, dominant,\nactive, self-assured, decisive). In this study, the alpha esti-\nmates of internal consistency for social appropriateness and\ndominance were .86 and .78, respectively. The other three\nfactors in Popp et al.'s study, which were directness, emo-\ntionality, and playfulness, did not have high enough alphas to\ncreate subscales in this study; thus, the single items \"articu-\nlate,\" \"emotional,\" and \"humorous\" were used instead.\nComposite measures of social appropriateness and domi-\nnance were formed by taking the mean of the relevant items.\nHigher scores indicate more socially desirable speech char-\nacteristics (i.e., high social appropriateness and low domi-\nnance). Means were also used for the three single-item\nmeasures, with higher scores indicating more articulate\nspeech, less emotional speech, and more humorous speech.\nFinally, participants completed the Ambivalent Sexism\nInventory (ASI; Glick & Fiske, 1996), the Modern Racism\nScale (MRS; Swim, Aiken, Hall, & Hunter, 1995), and the\nMotivation to Control Prejudice Reactions Scale (MCPRS;\nassesses two components of sexism: hostile sexism and\nbenevolent sexism. Some example items include \"Most\nwomen interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist,\"\nand \"Women seek to gain power by getting control over\nmen.\" The MRS is a 6-item measure that assesses modern, as\nopposed to old-fashioned, racist beliefs. An example item is\n\"Over the past few years, the government and news media\nhave shown more respect to Blacks than they deserve.\"\nFinally, the MCPRS is a 17-item measure of social desirabil-\nity in relation to individuals' attempt to control prejudiced\nreactions. An example item is \"I always express my thoughts\nand feelings, regardless of how controversial they may be.\"\nThe alpha estimates of internal consistency for these three\nResults\nManagerial Speech Stereotypes\nAs modern racism, hostile sexism, motivation to reduce\nprejudice reactions, and age were correlated with dependent\nmeasures, they were used as control variables in this analy-\nsis.

No other sig-\nnificant main effects or interactions were found for manage-\nrial effectiveness.\nIn examining our prediction that training would differen-\ntially affect participants' opinions of company policies, a\nunivariate ANOVA was conducted on the composite score\nfor policy opinions. No covariates were used in this analysis,\nas none of the control measures were correlated with the\ndependent variable. The analysis revealed no significant\nmain effects or interactions. Thus, Hypotheses 4 and 5 were\nnot supported.\nDiscussion\nThe goals of this study were twofold. First, we aimed to\ninvestigate communication stereotypes about managers, and\nwe included both race and gender as target attributes.\nPrevious research had demonstrated communication stereo-\ntypes about race and gender among college student samples\nassessing student targets (Popp et al., 2003). However, our\nsearch of the literature found no research assessing percep-\ntions of the communication style of targets who were man-\nagers. Research on the stigma of both gender and race in the\nworkplace has repeatedly shown that negative consequences\ncan occur for women and ethnic minorities in leadership\npositions because of these stereotypes. Thus, we chose a\nsample of working adults as the most relevant group in\nCarlson and Crawford 7\nwhich to assess such stereotypes. Assuming that we would\nfind evidence of communication stereotypes in this popula-\ntion, our second goal was to examine whether participants\ndrew upon these stereotypes in assessing the effects of a\nsocial skills training program on the communication style\nand managerial effectiveness of targets. We discuss these\ntwo aspects of our results in turn.\nDoWorking Adults Hold Race- and Gender-Based\nStereotypes of Managers' Communication Style?\nOverall, our results show a consistent pattern of stereo-\ntypical judgments based on race. Participants viewed the\ncommunication style of White managers, female and male,\nas more socially appropriate (polite, sensitive, coopera-\ntive), dominant (decisive, self-assured, strong), articulate,\nand less emotional, than the communication style of Black\nmanagers. There were fewer results based on gender; how-\never, women were perceived as more emotional than men.\nThese results can be compared with Popp et al.'s (2003)\nresearch on communication stereotypes using college stu-\ndent participants and targets. Popp et al. found that the\ncommunication style of Blacks was seen not only as less\nappropriate and more emotional but also as more direct.\nThey also found that gender stereotypes were minimal;\nsimilarly, our results showed differences for target gender\nonly on the dependent measure of emotionality. Overall,\nfor college student and working adult participants, race\nseems to be more salient than gender in evaluating others'\nspeech style.\nWhat Are the Perceived Effects of\nCommunication SkillsTraining on Managers?\nNext, we investigated working adults' perceptions of the\neffects of a social skills training program on communication\nstyle and managerial behaviors. Despite the fact that \"Bully\nBroad\" training has been targeted specifically at female\nmanagers, our participants thought that White and male par-\nticipants would be most affected by becoming more emo-\ntional. Counter to our predictions about nonnormative\ngroups being perceived as needing to be \"fixed\" more than\nnormative groups, our results indicate that participants\nthought the normative groups would benefit most from more\nsensitive communication. One possible explanation for this\nis that White and male managers are seen as having the most\npower in the workplace and occupying the highest echelons\nof organizations, and thus are perceived as having the most\npotential for \"bullying\" behavior. Although research has\ndocumented negative evaluations of women who deviate\nfrom gender stereotypes in their speech, female (and Black)\nmanagers were perceived to have more emotional speech\nthan White or male managers prior to training, which is\nreflective of general race and gender stereotypes in society.\nIt appears that participants viewed the training program as a\nway to equalize emotionality, bringing White and male man-\nagers to the same level and Black and female managers.\nAnother interesting finding was that participants did not\nthink training would have much of an effect on managerial\neffectiveness (M = 3.82 on a 5-point scale), although female\nparticipants thought it would have more of an effect on\nfemale targets, whereas male participants thought it would\nhave more of an effect on male targets. Participants did not\nhave strong feelings regarding whether training should be a\npart of organizational policy (M = 4.42 on a 7-point scale).\nImplications, Limitations, and Future Research\nSince the 1970s, women have received conflicting mes-\nsages about how to communicate effectively. In the 1970s\nand 1980s, assertiveness training for women was a thera-\npeutic fad (Crawford, 1995). More recently, the trend has\nbeen to provide \"anti-assertiveness\" training, as in the Bully\nBroad program. The recent backlash on assertiveness may\nbe detrimental to women attempting to climb the corporate\nladder because it suggests that, to be successful, they should\nengage in behaviors that other working adults do not view\nas particularly helpful, effective, or necessary. Despite the\nlarge amount of publicity given to \"Bully Broad\" training\n(GLC website, n.d.-b), it seems that our sample of working\nadults did not perceive overly aggressive female managers\nas a major workplace problem. Neither male nor female\nmanagers were perceived as bullies; the ratings for both\ngroups were moderate. The selling of \"Bully Broad\" train-\ning to corporate human resources departments may depend\nmore on evoking outdated stereotypes of powerful women\nthan on any real need.\nOverall, these findings point to the necessity of examin-\ning communication, race, and gender in a managerial con-\ntext. Importantly, our study examined race and gender\ntogether. Being a member of a minority racial category and\nbeing gendered female are sources of prejudice and discrimi-\nnation in our society. Because the race and gender categories\nare not often studied together, little is known about whether\nthe effects of membership in two stigmatized categories are\nadditive, multiplicative, or whether they might even cancel\neach other out. In the study by Popp et al. (2003), the gender\nand the race of a target influenced evaluations of the target's\ncommunication style, but the effects were separate and non-\ninteracting. In our study, race proved more important than\ngender with respect to initial stereotypes; however, gender\nplayed a role in the evaluation of managerial effectiveness.\nAlthough race and gender did not interact in this study, it is\nstill important to investigate both variables simultaneously\nto better understand their relationship. Although scholars\nhave hypothesized that Black women will experience a dou-\nble disadvantage in leadership positions based on the dual\nstigma of race and gender, recent research has shown that\nthis is not so clear. A recent study done by Livingston,\nRosette, and Washington (2012) indicated that the\n8 SAGE Open\ncombination of two stigmatized categories may interact in\nunexpected ways. In their experiment, the researchers found\nthat using a dominant leadership style had negative conse-\nquences for White women and Black men, but not for Black\nwomen. They hypothesized that double stigmatization put\nBlack women in a unique position, rendering them invisible\nand affording them the opportunity to behave in a more\nassertive way without penalty (even though penalties may\nprevent them from becoming leaders in the first place).\nOne major limitation of this study was the use of an all-\nWhite sample. It would be interesting to investigate the\neffects of this research with a more diverse population that\nwould enable interaction effects to be examined. In addition,\nit would be important to explore whether the differences\nfound in this study extend to other racial categories. Future\nresearch should further investigate beliefs about racial differ-\nences in leadership style. The strong negative stereotypes of\nAfrican American communication style found in earlier\nresearch with college students were not completely repli-\ncated here. Nevertheless, Black managers were evaluated as\nless socially appropriate, less articulate, and more emotional\nthan White managers. There is a need for more research on\nracial stereotypes as expressed in beliefs about communica-\ntion style. In particular, why are Black managers perceived\nas communicating less appropriately? In addition, when and\nhow does managerial status override racial stereotypes about\ncommunication?\nUnlike race, gender was relatively unimportant in affect-\ning judgments about communication effectiveness. This\nstudy underscores how much the beliefs about women's\ncommunication skills (and by implication, their managerial\ncompetence) have changed over the past decades. However,\nit also suggests that beliefs about African Americans' lack of\nsocial appropriateness may still undermine the effectiveness\nof Black managers.\nAppendix\nExampleVignette\nHow Not to Be a \"Bully Boss\"\nAn important part of management training is providing\nexecutives with the skills to be effective communicators.\nOne new approach is the \"Bully Boss Boot Camp,\" where\ntough, direct, and successful executives are being enlisted by\ntheir supervisors--said to be intimidated by their style--for\nreprogramming to change their assertive ways and \"tone it\ndown.\" This 3-month intensive \"Bully Boss\" program costs\nup to US$20,000. Clients continue to meet as a group once\na month afterward for as long as they want. In this training\nprogram, high-powered executives are told to ditch the hard-\nball stuff and relearn softer behavior and tactics. Participants\nare told to let go of the idea of total control, to show others\nthat they are vulnerable by revealing their weaknesses, to\nuse a softer voice, to smile when they speak, to talk slowly\nso that others can understand, and even to put themselves\ndown or to affect a stammer to appear less threatening to\nothers.\nHere are some other pieces of advice that are given to\nparticipants:\nAdopt a submissive body language\nBe more willing to listen\nLearn to apologize more\nHesitate when speaking\nTalk about your feelings\nDress less militantly\nWait until two or three people have spoken before\nspeaking\nAdopt a more equivocal vocabulary (e.g., using more\nphrases like \"I don't know,\" \"I'm not sure,\" and \"I\nguess\")\nThis training also suggests that these managers walk\nmore slowly so that people do not feel bowled over. The\nprogram is designed to help \"Bully Bosses\" to \"fine tune\"\nthe way they behave at work--It attempts to change the way\nthey communicate by helping them to adopt a gentler, less\nabrasive management style. This training has been found to\nbe particularly useful with White male managers, bosses,\nand executives. Therefore, the remainder of these materials\nwill focus on White men as participants.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1. Only 16% of the sample identified an ethnicity other than\nWhite. Of this amount, the highest group was Asian/Asian\nAmerican at 7%. As with Popp, Donovan, Crawford, Marsh,\nand Peele (2003), it was therefore impossible to make mean-\ningful intergroup comparisons. Based on the theoretical and\nmethodological reasoning discussed in Popp et al., we also\ndecided to restrict our sample to White participants. However,\ncontrary to Popp et al., we found that 100% of participants\nwere able to identify the race and sex of the target during the\nmanipulation check; therefore, we did not need to exclude any\nfurther participants from our analyses.\nReferences\nAllen, B.
