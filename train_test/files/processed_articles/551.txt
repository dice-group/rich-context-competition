We also tested\nwhether the intervention effect was moderated by parent gender, child gender, or child age.\nMETHODS: The Support-Transform-Achieve-Results Intervention was delivered in an information\ntechnology division of a US Fortune 500 company. Participants included 93 parents (45%\nmothers) of a randomly selected focal child aged 9 to 17 years (49% daughters) who completed\ndaily telephone diaries at baseline and 12 months after intervention. During evening telephone\ncalls on 8 consecutive days, parents reported how much time they spent with their child that day.\nRESULTS: Parents in the intervention group exhibited a significant increase in parent-child shared\ntime, 39 minutes per day on average, between baseline and the 12-month follow-up. By\ncontrast, parents in the Usual Practice group averaged 24 fewer minutes with their child per\nday at the 12-month follow-up. Intervention effects were evident for mothers but not for\nfathers and for daughters but not sons.\nCONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the intervention would improve parents' daily time with their\nchildren was supported. Future studies should examine how redesigning work can change the quality\nof parent-child interactions and activities known to be important for youth health and development.\ntime with parents is critical for healthy\ndevelopment. Lack of control over parents'\nschedules and limited supervisor support for\npersonal and family life can interfere with\nparents' family time.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first group\nrandomized controlled field trial demonstrating\neffects of a workplace intervention, designed to\nincrease schedule control and supervisor\nsupport, on working parents' time with their\nchildren, as assessed by using longitudinal daily\ntelephone interviews.\naClearinghouse for Military Family Readiness, and cHuman Development and Family Studies, The Pennsylvania State\nUniversity, University Park, Pennsylvania; bDepartment of Psychological Science, Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana;\ndDepartment of Sociology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; ePopulation Dynamics Branch, The Eunice\nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development, Bethesda, Maryland; fDepartment of Psychology,\nPortland State University, Portland, Oregon; gDepartment of Sociology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia; hDepartment of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; and\niKaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Portland, Oregon\nDr Davis contributed to the conceptualization and design of the diary component of the Work, Family, and\nHealth Study (WFHS), conceptualized the current study, planned the analysis steps, and wrote most of this\nmanuscript; Dr Lawson conducted the analyses for the paper, wrote the Results section, created the tables\nand figures, and reviewed, revised, and approved this manuscript; Dr Almeida led the conceptualization and\ndesign of the telephone interview diary component of the WFHS, consulted on the analytic approach, and\nreviewed, revised, and approved this manuscript; Dr Kelly was involved in the design of the WFHS, including\nthe development and implementation of the workplace intervention, and reviewed, revised, and approved\nthis manuscript; Dr King contributed to the conception, design, and interpretation of the data, revised the\nmanuscript critically for important intellectual content, and gave final approval of the version submitted;\nDr Hammer was involved in the design of the WFHS, including the development and implementation of the\nworkplace intervention, and reviewed, revised, and approved this manuscript; Dr Casper led the design of\nthe original Workplace, Family, Health and Well-being Network Initiative, and reviewed, revised, and\napproved the manuscript; Drs Okechukwu and Hanson reviewed, revised, and approved this manuscript;\nDr McHale contributed to the conceptualization, design, and measurement design of the diary component of\nthe WFHS, provided analytic consultation, and reviewed, revised and approved this manuscript.\nTime with parents is a significant\nfactor in children's health and\ndevelopment. Shared activities\npromote close, nurturing\nrelationships that are critical for\nyouths' psychological and behavioral\nadjustment1\u00ad3 and for their ability to\ndevelop close relationships with\npeers and romantic partners.4,5\nParent-child shared time also affords\nopportunities for parents to monitor\ntheir children's activities and deter\nhealth risk behaviors,6 promote\nhealthful eating and exercise,7,8\narrange health care appointments,9,10\nand foster skills and knowledge that\nare important for youths' current and\nWith longer work days and commute\ntimes, more nonstandard work\nschedules, and greater work stress, it\nis more difficult to be a parent today\nthan in the past.12 Parents' time at\nwork necessarily limits time to invest\nin children, and today's US working\nparents often report feeling the time\nsqueeze, that is, insufficient time to\nfulfill responsibilities for both work\nand family.13 Cultural standards set\na high bar for what constitutes\nsufficient time with children and\ncan place a strain on parents,\nincreasing their feelings of work-\nfamily conflict and time inadequacy.14\nYet, public and workplace policies are\nlimited and mismatched in meeting\nthe needs of working parents, needs\nthat ultimately affect the welfare\nMost research on parents' work and\ntime with their children shows that\nlonger work hours are associated\nwith less parent-child time.16 The\ncorrelational designs of this research,\nhowever, mean that conclusions\nabout causal associations between\nwork involvement or workplace\nconditions and parent-child shared\ntime cannot be drawn. One exception\nis a study of a workplace initiative in\na white collar organization that\nimproved mothers' and fathers'\nperceptions of adequacy of time with\ntheir children; however, this study did\nnot assess parents' actual time with\nchildren.17 Most research in this area\nfocuses on working parents with\nyoung children; we know little about\nthe effects of parents' work on\nadolescent-aged offspring.\nAdolescents' increasing autonomy\nand involvement in the world beyond\nthe family mean that parents and\nadolescents spend less time together\nthan in childhood.18 However,\nadolescents' time with parents\nremains important for their\ndevelopment,19 and work policies\nand practices that allow parents to be\nresponsive to their adolescents'\nschedules may promote parent-youth\nshared time.\nThe Work, Family, and Health Study\n(WFHS) builds on previous research\nto evaluate the effects of a workplace\nintervention designed to increase 2\nresources: supportive supervisor\nbehaviors for personal and family life\nand schedule control. Our hypotheses\nwere that increases in work resources\nwould reduce employees' work-\nfamily conflict and, in turn, benefit\ntheir health and family lives. Our\nstudy is situated within the work-\nhome resource model,20 which holds\nthat work demands deplete parental\nresources, including time and energy,\nthereby influencing parents' family\nfunctioning. Correspondingly, work\nresources, such as supervisor support\nfor personal and family life and\nschedule control can increase\npersonal resources, with positive\nimplications for family role\nperformance, including increased\ntime with children.21 We\nhypothesized that parents in the\nintervention condition would exhibit\nsignificantly more daily time with\ntheir children 1 year after\nintervention, compared with parents\nwho were randomly assigned to the\nUsual Practice (UP) condition. We\nalso tested whether intervention\neffects varied as a function of parent\ngender, youth gender, or youth age. In\nline with gender role socialization\nthat highlight the social and kinship\norientations of women and girls,22 we\nexpected that the intervention would\nbe most effective for mothers and for\ndaughters. In line with developmental\nresearch that stresses youths'\nincreasing involvement in the world\nbeyond the family, we expected that\nthe intervention would be more\neffective in the case of older\nMETHOD\nStudy Design\nThe WFHS is a group randomized,\nfield experiment conducted in an\ninformation technology division of\na US Fortune 500 company. We tested\nthe effects of the STAR (Support-\nTransform-Achieve-Results)\nintervention, which was designed to\npromote a supportive work culture by\nincreasing supervisor support for\npersonal and family life and schedule\nwas introduced by executives as\na company-sponsored pilot program.\nThe intervention was developed\njointly by our research team and\noutside consultants who customized\nthe materials for this work force. In\nan additional effort to keep the data\ncollection and intervention separate,\n4 facilitators delivered the STAR\nintervention to supervisors and\nemployees, and a separate group of\nresearch staff, blind to participants'\nexperimental assignment, was\nFifty-six groups of information\ntechnology workers who reported to\nthe same manager were randomized\nto either the intervention (STAR), or\nUP conditions. STAR involved\nfacilitated training sessions (6\nmanager training sessions, 4\nemployee sessions) across a 4-month\nperiod. The sessions were designed to\nchange work culture to focus on work\nresults rather than when and where\npeople perform their work,17 that is,\nvaluing work productivity rather than\nface time. In addition, managers\ncompleted a 1-hour computer-based\ntraining that focused on providing\nemotional and instrumental support\nfor employees facing family and\npersonal demands, modeling effective\nwork-family management, and\nidentifying creative work-family\nmanagement strategies.26 Managers\nalso were instructed to track their\nsupportive behaviors by using the\nweSupport Behavior Tracking\napplication. Research staff blinded to\nparticipants' group assignment\nconducted workplace interviews at\npost-STAR. The WFHS was approved\nby several internal review boards. A\ndetailed description of the\nintervention design and protocol has\nbeen published elsewhere.27 All of\nthe intervention materials can be\nfound on the following Web site:\nwww.workfamilyhealthnetwork.org.\nOf the 823 employees who completed\nwere eligible for home interviews\nbecause they were a parent of a child\naged 9 to 17 who lived at home for at\nleast 4 days a week and who was\nwilling to participate in a home\ninterview.

The attriters (n\n= 32) did not differ from those who\ncompleted both the baseline and 12-\nmonth diary assessments (n = 99) in\nbasic demographic information (eg,\nage, education, household income,\nnumber of children living in the\nhome) or the target intervention\nvariables (ie, schedule control and\nsupervisor support for personal and\nfamily life; Fig 1). Over the course of 8\nconsecutive evenings, participants\ncompleted interviews assessing daily\nmood, health, work and family\nexperiences, and time use. In addition\nto its ecological validity, the daily\ndiary method reduces recall biases\nthat can occur when parents provide\nglobal reports of their time use over\nextended periods.28 Parents\ninterviews, on average, at baseline,\ninterviews at the 12-month follow-up.\nparticipation at baseline and 12\nmonths, respectively.\nParticipants\nAnalyses used the subsample of 93\nmothers) who participated in the\ndiary study at baseline and 12\nmonths. Most were college-educated,\nwith annual household incomes .\naveraged 13 years of age, and about\nhalf were girls.\nMeasures\nDaily parent-child time was assessed\non each of 8 consecutive evenings\nwith the following question: \"Since\nthis time yesterday, how much time\ndid you spend taking care of or doing\nthings with [TARGET CHILD NAME],\nsuch as helping with homework,\nplaying with him/her, driving him/\nher around, or doing something else\nwith him/her?\" Time was converted\nto minutes per day.\nThe independent variables to test the\nintervention effect were Condition (0\n= UP, 1 = STAR), Wave (0 = baseline,\n1 = 12 months after assessment), and\ntheir interaction. Covariates included\ndiary day (range = 1\u00ad8, centered at\nday 1), whether the youth was on\nsummer vacation (0 = no, 1 = yes),\nmean number of school days across\nthe 8 diary days at each wave, mean\nnumber of parent work days at each\nwave, parent and youth gender (0 =\ngirls, 1 = boys), and youth age\n(centered at the grand mean at\nbaseline).

To\naccount for the clustering of\nobservations within persons, we\ntested multilevel models using SAS\nProc Mixed (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,\nNC). For significant interactions,\nsimple slopes tests were used to\ndetermine if increases or decreases\nwere significantly different from\nRESULTS\nMain Effects of the STAR Intervention\nCompared with UP parents, those in\nSTAR increased in parent-child time\nfrom baseline to the 12-month follow-\n(Table 2).

Parents in the\nSTAR intervention reported an\naverage of 39 minutes more time per\nday or 4.5 hours per week with their\nchild at 1 year after intervention. By\ncontrast, parents randomly assigned\nto UP exhibited declines in time with\nTABLE 1 Participant Demographic Information (n = 93)\nSTAR Intervention Group, n = 57 UP Group, n = 36\nn (%) or Mean (SD)\nEmployee\nChild\nThe intervention group and UP groups did not significantly differ in employee or child demographics.\nTABLE 2 Average Parent-Child Time Together\n(Minutes Per Day) at Baseline and\n12 Months for STAR and UP Groups\nMean SD Mean SD\ntheir children over the same period,\ndeclines that would be expected given\nthe increasing autonomy of\nadolescents.18 Youths' increasing\ninvolvement in the world beyond the\nhome, in combination with parents'\ndemanding work schedules, may\ncreate special challenges for parents'\ntime with adolescent-aged children.\nClose parent-child relationships\nremain important, however, in\nprotecting youth from the increases\nin adjustment problems and health\nrisk behaviors that often emerge\nduring this developmental period.32\nBy providing parents with support\nfrom managers and flexibility in when\nand where to complete their work,\nour results suggest that the STAR\nintervention opened up opportunities\nfor parents to remain connected to\ntheir adolescents.\nChanges in parent-child time were\nmore apparent for mothers than for\nfathers. Mothers in STAR increased\nnearly 1 hour per day by the 12-\nmonth follow-up, whereas UP\nmothers declined by more than an\nhour per day in time with their child.\nAlthough the simple slopes test\nrevealed a trend-level increase in\nparent-child time for fathers in STAR,\nthey did not differ significantly from\nUP fathers. Past decades have\nwitnessed increases in fathers' time\nwith children, but cultural scripts\nregarding mothers' role as caregiver\nand fathers' role as breadwinner\nremain pervasive34 and mothers still\nspend more time than fathers.33 One\nstrategy mothers use is limiting their\ntime on personal activities.14\nImportant to note is that mothers in\nthis sample did not work significantly\nfewer hours per week (baseline\nweek for mothers and fathers,\nrespectively), and work hours did not\nsignificantly change for either\nmothers or fathers. Thus, mothers\nmay have been more inclined to take\nadvantage of the opportunities and\nsupports afforded by STAR to spend\ntime with their children.\nOur findings on youth gender\nmoderation suggest that children, too,\nplay an important role in these\nprocesses: daughters may be more\ninclined than sons to seek out their\nparents or be seen by their parents as\nmore available for and amenable to\nconversations and companionate\nactivities. Indeed, research on\ndevelopmental changes in parent-\nchild time has shown that, across\nadolescence, mother-daughter dyads\nspend more time together than dyads\nof any other gender constellation,35\nand our findings fit with this pattern.\nThis finding could also reflect\nparenting practices that tend to keep\ndaughters under closer supervision\nthan sons.36 The sample size limited\nour ability to test whether mother-\ndaughter dyads showed the largest\nincrease in shared time compared\nwith other parent-child gender\nconstellations; this is a direction for\nfuture research.\nTaken together, our findings are\nconsistent with the work-home\nresource model,20 which holds that\nwork demands deplete resources but\nthat work resources can increase\nparents' resources, including time,\nwith positive implications for family\nrole performance. Early results\nshowed that the STAR intervention\nimproved 2 workplace resources\n(supportive supervisor behaviors and\nschedule control27) and our analyses\nIntervention effects on average daily parent-child time together by parent gender.

The figure repre-\nsents the average daily parent-child time together (in minutes) across time for both the Intervention\nand UP groups.\nrevealed that it also increased\nemployees' time with children. By\npromoting schedule control in the\ncontext of supervisor support, STAR\nmay have provided more flexibility\nfor parents to spend time when their\nadolescent-aged offspring were\navailable, and such time investments\nare known to have positive\ndownstream implications for youth\nImportant to note is that this study\ntested the effects of a workplace\nintervention on quantity but not\nquality of parent-child time. Although\nmore time together brings\nopportunities for positive parent-\nchild experiences, it does not\nguarantee them. The autonomy of\nadolescence, however, means that\nyouths have increasing opportunities\nto avoid spending time with their\nparents when shared time is not\nrewarding, and further, there is\nevidence that the quantity of parent-\nchild shared time is linked to\nadjustment measures, such as self-\nesteem and peer social competence in\nadolescence.35 Other research\nidentified specific activities, such as\nfamily meals, assisting with\nhomework, and discussing daily\nactivities, that are linked to positive\ndetermining whether and what\nworkplace resources promote\ninvolvement in particular kinds of\nactivities or interactions is a direction\nfor future study.\nIn this study, we used parents' rather\nthan youths' daily reports of shared\ntime. Although our daily measure\nreduces memory distortions and\nsocial desirability biases because\nreports focus on a single day, future\nresearch should take youths'\nperspectives into account. Reports\nfrom individuals not directly involved\nin the intervention (such as youths or\nspouses) would provide confidence\nthat behavioral changes are due to the\nintervention and not placebo-type\neffects. Although using a more\ntraditional time diary approach could\nprovide more accurate reports of time\nuse than end-of-day reports,39 the\nlatter approach was more viable for\na sample of working parents with\nlimited time. We also focused on\nparents' time with 1 \"target child,\"\naged 9 to 17 who lived at home for at\nleast 4 days per week, and thus our\nfindings are not generalizable to\nyouths in other age groups or family\ncircumstances. Another important\ndirection for research is to test the\neffects of efforts to increase\nsupervisor support for personal and\nfamily life and schedule control in\nwork organizations and industries\nbeyond the white-collar context we\nstudied. Finally, although our\nprevious research documented\nsignificant increases in family\nsupportive supervisor behavior and\nschedule control and decreases in\nwork-family conflict in the\nintervention group relative to the UP\ngroup,40 a next step is to identify the\nmechanisms through which the\nintervention affected parent-child\nshared time.\nIn the face of some limitations, our\nresearch advances understanding of\nthe effects of parents' work on family\nlife. Most importantly, the design\nallows for causal inferences about the\neffects of the intervention, leading to\nthe conclusion that workplace\npractices can have positive effects in\nemployees' family lives and benefit\ntheir children. Using daily\nmeasurements, we were able to\ndocument with precision the effects\nof the intervention on a key\ndimension of parent-child\nrelationship quality (how much time\nyouth spend with their parents) that\nis critical for youth health and\nadjustment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy using an experimental design and\ndaily measurement, we documented\nthat the effects of a workplace\nintervention spilled over to affect\nemployees' family lives in the form of\nincreases in parents' time\ninvestments in their children. Our\nresults were consistent with theory\nand previous, largely correlational\nfindings in suggesting that workplace\nchanges that target 2 key workplace\nresources (supervisor support for\npersonal and family life and employee\nschedule control) can help to mitigate\nthe often conflicting demands and\nresponsibilities of work and family.\n"
