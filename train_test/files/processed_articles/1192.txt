This pattern suggests both a gene\u00adenvironment\ninteraction (i.e., those with a genetic propensity for\nrisky behavior will benefit more from a helping rela-\ntionship than those without such a propensity) and a\ngene\u00adenvironment correlation (these same people will\nbe less likely to have a helping relationship). This\npaper explores these complications, focusing on the\ncase of the student\u00admentor relationship, DRD2, and\ncontinuation beyond secondary school, which is a\nstrategic empirical example.\nIn the American context, educational continuation\nbeyond secondary school has major implications for\nadulthood, including life-long patterns of income\nand physical and mental health (Avison, 2005;\nand health are related to myriad aspects of successful\naging -- including subjective assessments of life satis-\nfaction, marital quality, and community involvement\n-- suggesting a pivotal and crucial role for education\nin the life course.\nMentoring is of special significance because\nmodels attempting to predict which students con-\ntinue beyond secondary school have traditionally\nfocused on the socioeconomic status of the parents\nand the educational aspirations that they maintain\nfor their children (Sewell et al., 1969). But such a\nview has expanded to include influential, non-\nparental adults (mentors) and indeed research\nsuggests that youth who are involved in a mentoring\nrelationship experience more academic success than\ntheir peers without such relationships (Bryant &\nNevertheless, most prior research focuses on `at-risk\nyouth' with little attention to comparatively diverse\nWe consider DRD2 Taq IA, a gene that is associ-\nated with dopamine type 2 receptors.

These regions of the brain have been associ-\nated with the reward system, impulse control,\nplanning, and related behaviors, and the dopaminer-\ngic system has been linked to reward-seeking\nbehavior in humans (e.g., Pessiglione et al., 2006).\nStudies with nonhuman animals suggest a role of D2\nand D2-like receptors in premature responding and\nimpaired accuracy of responses (Pattij et al., 2006),\nimpulsive choice making (van Gaalen, Brueggeman,\net al., 2006), inhibitory control (van Gaalen, van\nKoten, et al., 2006), and deficits in the initial acqui-\nsition of task-governing rules (Glickstein et al.,\n2005). The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man\nalso suggests behavioral correlates including alco-\nholism, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and\nTourette's syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance\nin Man, 2006). Taken as a whole, these and related\nstudies (for example, using DRD2 knockout mice,\nthe exact associations among DRD2 alleles, specific\nneural processes, and specific phenotypes are not\npresently understood, DRD2 A1+ is associated with\nphenotypes that would undermine school perfor-\nmance and educational attainment.\nThe present study focuses on (1) whether DRD2\nA1+ is associated with continuation to college/univer-\nsity; and, if so, (2) whether mentoring relationships\ncan attenuate this association (i.e., a G \u00d7 E); and\nfinally, (3) whether DRD2 A1+ is associated with\nhaving mentors (i.e., a rGE). In addition to these sub-\nstantive interests, we illustrate the usefulness of a\ncombinatoric approach to studying gene\u00adenvironment\ncorrelations and interactions by applying a novel ana-\nlytic method to the study of genes and behavior,\nQualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), and by\ndrawing on molecular genetic data available in Wave III\nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health). In so doing, our paper highlights\na new analytic strategy for researchers interested in the\ninterplay of genes and environmental factors, a point to\nwhich we return in the Conclusions and Discussion.\nMentoring: DRD2 Interplay\nand School Continuation\nGiven the relationship between DRD2 and phenotypes\nthat would be disadvantageous in classrooms, we\nexpect that DRD2 A1+ will be associated with poor\nperformance in social settings that call for high levels\nof self-control, such as schools, workplaces, and fami-\nlies. In the school setting, a career of such behaviors\n-- possibly including substance abuse and impulsivity\n-- will culminate in a lowered probability of\nmatriculation to college/university (Hypothesis 1).\nCould this relationship be buffered by mentoring? If\nso, do students with DRD2 risk develop mentoring\nrelationships in the first place?\nMentors and DRD2\nMentoring represents a form of social capital, which\nrefers to links among actors (in this case, the student\nand the mentor) that facilitate action (in this case, edu-\ncational continuation; Portes, 1998). Prior research\ndistinguishes between formal and informal mentoring\nand most studies of mentors focus on the former:\nyouth who are candidates for organized mentoring\nprograms due to a high risk of failure, at least in terms\nof their educational prospects (see Rhodes et al., 2000)\nor their social disadvantage (e.g., Bryant &\nmentors are relatives, friends, and other community\nmembers with whom youth have developed relation-\nships through their existing social networks.\nThe distinction between formal and informal\nmentors maps onto the distinction between bridging\nand bonding social capital. Bridging social capital con-\nnects actors who differ with respect to salient\nresources and thus bridging capital is believed to be\nespecially important in reducing soecioeconomic\ninequalities (including education). Formal mentors are\nlikely to represent bridging capital because programs\nassign people with special skills and knowledge to\nassist students without such skills and knowledge.\nTeachers who are mentors, although perhaps not\nformal mentors, also represent bridging capital\nbecause they possess a high level of experience with\nand insight into the educational system. In contrast,\nbonding social capital connects actors who do not\ndiffer appreciably in their salient resources.\nAccordingly, informal mentors who are not teachers\nare likely to lack expertise in the educational system\nand thus constitute bonding capital.\nThese distinctions suggest that teachers as mentors\nmay be especially salient forms of bridging social\ncapital. Because of their expertise with the educational\nsystem and personal knowledge of the student, a\nmentor who is a teacher may contribute to school con-\ntinuation in the presence of DRD2 A1+ (Hypothesis 2)\nby encouraging appropriate behavioral comportment\nand good decisions about schooling. On the other\nhand, a nonteacher mentor, lacking these insights and\nskills, may be of little assistance (Hypothesis 3).\nAre some youth more likely to have teachers as\nmentors? Rhodes (2002) suggests that adolescents\nwho are competent and goal-driven may appear a\n`better investment' of a teacher's time than youth who\nare impulsive and lack planful competence. Thus,\nyouth with DRD2 A1+ are expected to attract fewer\nteachers as mentors than youth with A1\u00ad (Hypothesis\n4). Taken as a whole, these hypotheses suggest that\nteachers may be especially beneficial to students with\nDRD2 A1+, but that these very same students are less\nlikely to attract teachers as their mentors.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Most of the evidence that suggests links among\nDRD2 alleles, neurobiology, and behavior is silent on\nissues of sex and race. Biological studies that link\nDRD2 with neurobiological structure and function\nrestrict attention to males or often fail to find\nmale\u00adfemale differences. Thus, for example, DRD2\nrisk is presumed to lower neuronal density and\nbinding site availability equally in the striatal regions\nof males and females, and whites and blacks.\nLikewise, the animal literature linking DRD2 allelic\nvariation with behavior typically focuses on males\n(e.g., Wistar rats) and the race distinction obviously\nhas no nonhuman animal homologue. Finally, studies\nlinking DRD2 alleles and behaviors in humans do not\nprovide consistent evidence for sex or race differences,\nwith apparently no attention devoted to the latter.\nNevertheless, sex and race differences in the pro-\nposed hypotheses may be observed. With respect to sex,\nfemales and males are socialized differently, such that\nmany behaviors that would be deemed inappropriate in\nthe classroom (e.g., disruptive behaviors) would be con-\nsidered especially problematic for females. Thus, the\neffect of DRD2 on continuation may be smaller for\nfemales than for males (Hypothesis 5).\nSome theories of social capital maintain that it\nserves the majority's interest to reproduce inequalities\n(e.g., Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990), an argument typi-\ncally construed in terms of socioeconomic strata but\napplicable to race distinctions as well. Stanton-Salazar\nand Dornbusch (1995) argue that racial/ethnic minori-\nties find supportive ties in school settings and\ncommunity organizations, but these ties are often\nproblematic because institutional agents of the school\n(e.g., teachers, coaches) tend not to share subcultural\nvalues and norms with nonwhites. This line of reason-\ning suggests that teachers may have little or negative\nassociation with continuation among blacks\n(Hypothesis 6). In effect, hypotheses 5 and 6 suggest\nthat blacks, particularly black males, will not benefit\nfrom either bridging or bonding capital.\nSample\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health) was based initially on a nation-\nally representative sample of youth in grades 7\nthrough 12 in the United States. Data have been\nobtained from the adolescents themselves, and from\ntheir parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners, and\nfrom school administrators. The National Quality\nEducation Database provided the sampling frame with\nits list of all high schools in the United States\n(N = 26,666). To qualify, a high school had to include\nan 11th grade and an enrollment of more than 30 stu-\ndents. From this frame 80 schools were selected. The\nsample was stratified according to several distinctions,\nincluding region, suburban/urban/rural, school type\n(whether public, private, parochial), ethnic mix, and\nsize. Fifty-two of the 80 schools agreed to participate,\nand 28 replacements schools were selected based on\nthe stratifying variables. Each of the 80 schools was\npaired with a middle school (based on its contribution\nto the high school student body). A total of 145 of the\nschools agreed to host a confidential in-school survey\nwhich focused on adolescent health and friends. This\n(in 1994). Nearly four out of five schools provided a\nroster from which the first in-home interview sample\nwas drawn.\nFrom the rosters, students were randomly selected\nfor a 90-minute interview, conducted in the home.\nApproximately 200 students were recruited from\nschools in each school pair, regardless of size. This\nprocedure resulted in a self-weighting sample. A total\nthrough 19) were interviewed at home. This in-home\nwave of interviews with target child and parent was\ncarried out in 1995, between April and December. The\nsecond in-home interview encompassed youth who\nwere in the 7th to 11th grades at Wave I, was compa-\nrable to the first interview in its coverage, and was\ncarried out between April and August of 1996. The\nWave II in-home survey resulted in a sample of 14,738\nyouth between the ages of 13 and 20. A third wave\nThe present study draws on data collected from\nstudents and parents at Wave I and from youth at\nWave III. In Wave I, data were collected from a\nsibling pairs subsample; 64% of the cases arose from\nthe Add Health probability sample, and 36% of the\npairs were collected as a convenience sample. The\nsibship sample is composed of 1249 full-sibling pairs,\npairs. DNA data were collected from some of the\nsibling pairs at Wave III (n = 2574), with genotyped\naverage sibship size among the 2557 individuals is\n1.88, with a standard deviation of .46; an inspection\nof the frequency distribution for sibship size shows\nthat almost 79% of the youth have one other sibling\nin the dataset and about 17% are singletons.\nThus, the DNA subsample of Add Health is not a\nprobability sample. Comparisons between the fully-\nweighted Wave I school-based dataset and the DNA\nsubsample (not shown; available upon request) reveal\nsimilar levels of parental socioeconomic status,\nparental involvement in school, and school quality,\nand somewhat higher levels of talking to parents\nabout school in the latter. These comparisons also\nreveal that the DNA sample is more educated, more\nlikely to belong to a nonintact family, more likely to\nlive in the West (as opposed to Northeast), and more\nsuburban (as opposed to rural).\nFinally, among the 2557 individuals in the DNA\nsubsample, there were missing data: about 10% for\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The TaqIA polymorphism (Grandy et al.,\n1989) is the most commonly studied and is located\nabout 10 kb down stream from exon 8, which is the\nend of the DRD2 gene (Kidd et al., 1996). The TaqIA\npolymorphism refers to a single nucleotide polymor-\nphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the gene\n(and so may act via an associated, functional polymor-\nphism in an adjacent gene). The A1 allele has a point\nmutation C  T (TCGA to TTGA), which eliminates\nthe TaqI site. This polymorphism was assayed at the\nInstitute of Behavioral Genetics, University of\nColorado-Boulder.\nThe DRD2 TaqIA assay (Haberstick & Smolen,\n2004) was performed using the fluorogenic 5'nuclease\n(Taqman\u00ae, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\nUnlabeled forward and reverse primers were purchased\nfrom Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).\nVIC and FAM labeled probes were puchased from ABI.\nAll reactions were performed in an ABI Prism\u00ae 7000\nSequence Detection System using the allelic discrimina-\nUniversal Master Mix.

Cycling parameters used were a 10\nwell plate included six nontemplate controls, four\nsamples homozygous for the A SNP, four samples\nhomozygous for the G SNP and two heterozygous\nsamples.

Preliminary analyses supported the\nand A1\u00ad (those students homozygote for A2), a dis-\ntinction supported by many other studies (e.g., see\nNoble's 2003 review). Research conducted at the\nInstitute of Behavioral Genetics indicates that\nDRD2 is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (Smolen,\nMentors\nAll mentoring data come from the Wave III in-home\ninterview data and were reported by the young\nperson. Informal mentors were identified with the\nfollowing question: `Some young people know\nadults, other than their parents, who make an impor-\ntant positive difference in their lives. Some do not.\nHas an adult, other than your parents or step-\nparents, made an important positive difference in\nyour life at any time since you were 14 years old?'. If\nthere was more than one influential adult, respon-\ndents were asked to report only on the most\nimportant. The mentor's social role, or relationship\nto the young person, was identified by the respon-\ndent as an adult relative (older brother, younger\nbrother, older sister, younger sister, mother's mother,\nmother's father, father's mother, father's father, aunt,\nuncle, spouse or partner), friend, teacher (teacher or\nguidance counselor, coach/athletic director), or com-\nmunity member (minister, priest, rabbi, or religious\nleader, employer, co-worker, neighbor, friend, ,\nfriend's parent, doctor/therapist/social worker,\nother). These two items -- whether a respondent had\na mentor and, if so, the role of the mentor -- were\nused to create three sets: no mentor, mentor who was\nnot a teacher, and mentor who was a teacher. Finally,\nthe youth were asked `How old were you when\n{HE/SHE} first became important in your life?'. This\nitem, combined with the mentor status item, were\nused to assure that mentors became important after\nage 14 but before age 18 (i.e., during high school for\nthe vast majority of youth).\nParental Socioeconomic Status\nResearch on educational continuation traditionally\nfocused on the important role of parental socioeconomic\nstatus and so we include this variable in our analysis.\nSocioeconomic status is the average of two variables\nstandardized (mean = 0 and unit variance), highest com-\npleted parental education (1 = 8th grade or less,\n2 = more than 8th grade but did not complete high\nschool, 3 = went to business, trade, or vocational school\ninstead of high school, 4 = high school graduate,\n5 = completed a Graduate Equivalency Diploma,\n6 = went to business, trade, or vocational school after\nhigh school, 7 = went to college but did not graduate, 8\n= graduated from college or university, 9 = professional\ntraining beyond a 4 year college or university) and\nPhysical Appearance and Attractiveness of Personality.\nAlthough the analyses focus on DRD2 and mentors,\nother factors undoubtedly contribute to the elicitation\nof help from mentors.

This\nitems was then used in conjunction with six other\nitems asked about degrees received to categorize youth\ninto two sets: did not continue education beyond high\nschool; continued education beyond high school.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe hypotheses focus on whether DRD2 alleles are\nrelated to school continuation (Hypothesis 1); teachers\nas mentors can attenuate the association between\nDRD2 and school continuation (Hypothesis 2); non-\nteacher mentors will not attenuate this association\n(Hypothesis 3); and students with DRD2 risk are less\nlikely to attract teachers as mentors then students\nwithout such risk (Hypothesis 4). Further, we expect\nthat the link between DRD2 risk and continuation\nrates will be stronger for males than for females\n(Hypothesis 5) and that the positive effect of teachers\nwill not be observed among blacks (Hypothesis 6).\nHypotheses 1 and 5 are addressed with a simple\ncomparison of continuation rates across groups defined\nby DRD2's alleles. The remaining hypotheses are\naddressed with QCA (Ragin, 1989). QCA is an analytic\nmethod that combines Boolean algebra with descriptive\nstatistical analysis. A `set' refers to a group of people\ndefined by one independent variable. Combinations of\nsets are called `configurations.' Rather than trying to\ndiscover the net causal effect of single independent vari-\nables, QCA assesses how each configuration compares\nto other configurations on their level of the dependent\nvariable. In so doing, QCA is well-suited to the study of\ngene-environment interplay.\nConsider a simplified example: a theory predict-\ning that Y reflects A (a gene), B (a contextual\nvariable), and C (another contextual variable), all of\nwhich are dichotomous variables (i.e., 0 or 1). A, B,\nand C each define a set. Rather than estimating the\nnet effect of each of A, B, and C, QCA instead\ncreates an 8-cell typology that combines their possi-\nble values (i.e., three variables with two response\ncategories = 23 = 8 configurations). We can then\nexamine how many people are in each configuration\ncompared with expectations given the marginals,\nwhich could reveal a r(GE). We can also compare\nthe proportion of people with Y = 1 across the eight\nconfigurations, which would reveal a G \u00d7 E. If we\nfound, for instance, that both A\u00b7b\u00b7C1 and A\u00b7B\u00b7C\nstood out positively relative to the other configura-\ntions, we could use Boolean algebra to reduce this\nsolution to A\u00b7C. (B and b cancel each other out as\nlong as they are the only differences between the\nsolutions.) That is, a specific polymorphism (A)\naccompanied by a specific context (C) significantly\nincrease the likelihood that Y = 1 and B is irrelevant.\nThere are several advantages to QCA compared\nwith more traditional methods. First, it takes seriously\nthe fact that real life may reflect high levels of\ncontigencies among predictor variables. Second, it\nprovides a model that treats `interactions' between\nvariables with greater sensitivity than general linear\nmodels. In a general linear framework, for example,\nthe interaction term (A) \u00d7 (B) would be scored 0 if the\nrespondent was either a or b or both. It therefore\ntreats potentially very different kinds of situations as\nthe same type of thing. QCA preserves these differ-\nences by looking at all configurations.\nIn the present analyses, we are interested in dif-\nferences in school continuation rates. To form the\nexplanatory configurations, we rely on six variables:\nDRD2 A1+ (G), having a mentor (M), having a\nteacher as a mentor (T), high parental socioeco-\nnomic status (S), physically attractive (A) and\nattractive personality (P).\nThe `crisp variant' of QCA (explained above)\nassumes that each person is (1) or is not (0) a member\nof each configuration of sets. A crisp set approach\nthus yields 48 configurations of sets and each person\nis a member of only one of these configurations.\n(There would be 26 (or 64) configurations except that\nm*T is logically impossible.) For example, a person in\nthe configuration of sets `youth with no DRD2 risk,\nhas a mentor, that mentor is not a teacher, high\nparental status, not physically attractive, and attrac-\ntive personality' would belong to that configuration of\nsets (i.e., their membership would equal 1 for a\ndichomotomous variable representing that configura-\ntion of sets) and would not belong to any of the other\nconfigurations of sets (i.e., membership = 0 for each of\nthe other 47 configuration of sets).\nGiven low subsample sizes, particularly for the\nblack males and females, we employ a fuzzy set\nvariant of QCA, which allows for partial membership\nin sets. Accordingly S, A, and P are `fuzzified' by con-\nverting their z scores into their equivalent place on the\ncumulative normal distribution, which has a natural\nrange of 0 to 1, noninclusive. (The DRD2 variable G\nand the mentoring variables M and T necessarily\nremain dichotomous.) In order to provide sample-spe-\ncific fuzzy membership, we linearly rescale these\nvalues such that the minimum for each set is 0 and the\nmaximum is 1. Following standard practice (Ragin,\n2000), we combine individual sets into configurations\nusing the minimum value of the constituent sets. For\nexample, a respondent with G = 1, M = 1, T = 1,\n.44 in the set G\u00b7T\u00b7S\u00b7I\u00b7Q\u00b7A, 0 in the set\ng\u00b7T\u00b7S\u00b7I\u00b7Q\u00b7A, and .10 in the set G\u00b7T\u00b7s\u00b7I\u00b7Q\u00b7A. That\nis, most respondents will provide information about a\nnumber of configurations of sets simultaneously.\nDrawing on fuzzified sets and their configurations,\nwe consider the broad issue of G \u00d7 Es involving DRD2\nand types of mentors using two strategies. First, for\neach one of the 48 configurations, we statistically\ncompare its school continuation rate with the average\nrate of the 47 other groups. To allow for such com-\nparisons, we generate values for `proportion\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Erickson, Stephen Vaisey, and Andrew Smolen\ncontinuing' by using the formula for fuzzy inclusion:\nIsk,y = min(sk,y)/sk, where Isk,y is the extent to\nwhich set s is included in outcome set y, and k\nindexes which of the 48 configurations is under\nconsideration.2 Each configuration of sets is then\ncompared to the average of the other 47 using an F\ntest. (The formula automatically weights the\nresponses so that respondents with low values of a\nconfiguration count less toward producing the value\nof Isk,y than do respondents with high values of a\nconfiguration.) Translating this into set-theoretic lan-\nguage, this formula essentially asks the question `to\nwhat extent is this configuration (X) a subset of the\noutcome (Y)?'. The resulting value (of Isk,y) can\nrange from 0 (X and Y do not overlap at all) to 1 (X\nis completely included in Y).\nThese comparisons identify configurations that\nare significantly different from the rest of the popula-\ntion in their rates of continuation (either positively or\nnegatively). Among configurations with a signifi-\ncantly higher continuation rate (i.e., `positive\nstand-out configurations'), we then use Boolean\nalgebra to simplify the solution (e.g., A\u00b7B\u00b7C plus\nA\u00b7b\u00b7C reduces to A\u00b7C). The same procedure is also\napplied to the negative stand-outs, or those configu-\nrations with significantly lower continuation rates.\nThese comparisons thus identify configurations of\nDRD2 and mentorships that are sufficient to produce\nresults that are significantly different from other con-\nfigurations that are closer to the overall sample's\ncontinuation rate.\nSecond, we focus on genetic differences in contin-\nuation rates within social capital configurations.\nCombining the variables (M, T, S, A, and P) yields 24\npossible configurations. Within each of these 24 con-\nfigurations, do continuation rates differ by genetic\nvariation (i.e., DRD2 A1+ and A1\u00ad)? We address this\nquestion by conducting an F test of the difference in\nschool continuation rate between these two groups.\nThese analyses compare continuation rates between\nDRD2 A1+ and A1\u00ad groups in the same configura-\ntion of sets of social context.\nAll analyses were conducted with Stata and\nfsQCA software packages and adjust standard errors\nfor nonindependence of observations due to sibships.\nFindings\nIs DRD2 associated with continuation to the tertiary\nlevel? Table 1 reports the mean continuation rates for\ngroups defined by race, sex, and DRD2. For males,\ncontinuation rates are significantly different between\nDRD2 A1+ and A1- groups, and the differences are\nnotable in magnitude. White males with A1\u00ad have an\naverage continuation rate of 59.3, compared to white\nmales with A1+, who have an average continuation\nrate of 44.4, a substantial difference. Black males with\nA1\u00ad have an average continuation rate of 51.5, com-\npared to black males with A1+, who have an average\ncontinuation rate of 34.7, a difference also of consid-\nerable magnitude. Within each race, these differences\nare statistically significant, although no such differ-\nences are observed for the white or black females.\nThus, DRD2 TaqI is associated with continuation to\nthe tertiary level, but only among males (consistent\nwith Hypotheses 1 and 5). Because of this lack of\nassociation among the white and black females, the\ncombinatorial analyses that examine the moderating\ninfluences of social capital will be presented for white\nand black males only.3\nMentoring, School Continuation, and DRD2: White Males\nThe conceptual model suggests that mentoring will\ncompensate for the association between DRD2 and\nschool continuation. To address this question, we\ncompared the continuation rates of each configuration\nof sets with the 47 other configurations of sets. The\n`positive stand-out' and `negative stand-out' configu-\nrations -- those having statistically better and\nstatistically worse continuation rates than the rest of\nthe configurations -- are presented in Table 2 for\nwhite males. The top panel shows the negative stand-\nouts, the bottom panel shows the positive stand-outs.\nFor example, youth who belong to the set\nG\u00b7m\u00b7t\u00b7s\u00b7a\u00b7p, `A1+, no mentor, no teacher mentor,\nlow parental socioeconomic status, not physically\nattractive, and personality not attractive,' have an\naverage continuation rate of .338 versus an average\ncontinuation rate of .547 for the remaining configura-\ntions of sets, a difference that is large in magnitude\ndegrees of freedom, p = .000). In contrast, youth in\ng\u00b7M\u00b7T\u00b7S\u00b7A\u00b7P -- belonging to the `opposite' set --\nhave an average continuation rate of .792. and this\ndifference is also statistically significant (F = 35.23\ntwo configurations have the lowest and highest proba-\nbilities of continuation, respectively.\nUsing Boolean logic, the stand-out configurations\nshown in Table 2 reduce to three parsimonious solutions:\nWhite males, positive stand-out:\ng\u00b7M\u00b7S or g\u00b7M\u00b7T\u00b7s\u00b7A\u00b7P\nWhite males, negative stand-outs:\nm\u00b7s or G\u00b7t\u00b7s\nThat is, two configurations produce better-than-\naverage continuation rates: A1\u00ad coupled with a\nContinuation to Tertiary Level by Race, Sex, and DRD2 Allele, % and n\nWhite Black\nMale Female Male Female\nNote: Logistic regression is used to compute significance tests to adjust the p values\nincludes the A2A2 genotype\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Further, in the case\nof high socioeconomic parents, any mentor will\nsuffice, be he/she a teacher, friend, minister/rabbi,\nand so forth. This pattern is consistent with the idea\nthat high socioeconomic status students attract high\nsocioeconomic status informal mentors. In contrast,\nin the case of low socioeconomic parents, the mentor\nmust be a teacher and the student must be attractive\nphysically and in personality. Perhaps low socioeco-\nnomic status students must attract teachers as\nbridging capital and they do so through their per-\nsonal attractiveness.\nThe negative stand-outs all involve low socioeco-\nnomic status. Additionally, white males lacking a\nmentor do less well, as do males with A1+ and low\nsocioeconomic status and no teacher mentor. Taken as\na whole, the results suggest the importance of socioeco-\nnomic status (or, in the alternative, attractiveness), A1+,\nand mentors, especially teachers for low socioeconomic\nstatus students. Follow-up analyses reveal that\nmentoring matters less for students with A1+: there is a\n14.4 percentage point increase in continuation rates for\nstudents with A1- (i.e., comparing g\u00b7m with g\u00b7M, .504\nversus .648, respectively), in contrast to 4.4 percentage\npoint increase for youth with A1+ (i.e., comparing G\u00b7m\nTable 3 shows the continuation rates within the\nconfigurations of sets for A1+ and A1- white males.\nThe table is divided into three panels.

In contrast, the bottom panel shows youth\nwith no genetic difference in continuation rates.\nCommon to every configuration in this panel is M\u00b7T,\nhaving a teacher as mentor. Finally, the middle panel\nshows configurations with higher continuation rates\namong those students with A1\u00ad compared to students\nwith A1+.

That all\n24 configurations would fall perfectly into these three\ngroups provides striking evidence to the effect that,\namong white males, (1) nonteacher mentors benefit\nstudents with A1\u00ad; and (2) only teachers can compen-\nsate for DRD2 A1+, and they do so completely.\nContinuation Rates for Stand-Out Configurations of Sets: White Males\nConfiguration of sets Continuation rate Continuation for F, p Best fit\nother configurations n\nNote: Significance level for F test with 636 degrees of freedom.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

To address this question, we cross-\ntabulated DRD2 allelic variants with five mentor\ncategories (none, friend, relative, teacher, and commu-\nnity). The omnibus chi-squared test is marginally\nsignificant, indicating that DRD2 risk status is\nweakly associated with the distribution of these men-\ntorship statuses (chi-squared with 4 degrees of\nnonetheless suggested a significant difference involv-\ning teacher mentors and an additional test revealed a\nstatistically significant difference: DRD2 A1+ is asso-\nciated with fewer teacher mentors (13.10%) than A1\u00ad\nteacher as mentor.\nConsistent with expectations, then, teachers fully\ncompensate for DRD2 A1+ with respect to educational\ncontinuation beyond secondary school, but youth with\nA1+ are less likely to attract teachers as mentors in the\nfirst place.\nMentoring, School Continuation, and DRD2: Black Males\nTurning to black males, we once again begin by exam-\nining positive and negative stand-out configurations.\nThe top panel of Table 4 shows negative stand-outs,\nthose configurations with lower than average continua-\ntion rates, and the bottom panel shows the positive\nstand-outs. Parsimonious solutions can be obtained by\napplying Boolean logic to the table, which results in:\nBlack males, positive stand-out: g\u00b7M\u00b7t\u00b7S or g\u00b7M\u00b7t\u00b7s\u00b7A\u00b7P\nor G\u00b7M\u00b7T\u00b7s\u00b7A\u00b7P\nBlack males, negative stand-outs: G\u00b7m\u00b7s\u00b7a\nor G\u00b7M\u00b7t\u00b7s\u00b7p\nThat is, black males do better than average in several\ncircumstances.

Second,\namong black males with A1+, a teacher mentor and\nhigh socioeconomic status or both physical and\npersonal attractiveness. These results are especially\nnoteworthy in two respects. As was observed among\nwhite males, physical and personality attractivess can\nsubstitute for parental high socioeconomic status.\nBlack males with A1+ also require a teacher as a\nmentor. However, white males with A1\u00ad require a\nteacher mentor, while black males require a non-\nteacher mentor.\nCommon to the negative stand-outs for black\nmales are A1+ and low socioeconomic status. These\nfactors may be coupled with no mentor and low\nphysical attractiveness or a nonteacher mentor and\nlow attractiveness of personality. Common to white\nand black males with lower than average continua-\ntion rates, then, is no mentor and low\nsocioeconomic status or DRD2 A1+ and no teacher\nmentor. Once again, the results highlight the impor-\ntance of socioeconomic status, A1+, and mentors,\nalthough there is a high level of contingency operat-\ning among these factors.\nTable 5 shows the average continuation rates\nwithin configurations of sets and across groups\ndefined by DRD2 allelic variant. Once again, the table\nis divided into three panels. The top panel shows con-\nfigurations including m\u00b7t -- black males without any\ntype of mentorship. These configurations generally\nhave low continuation rates and there are no differ-\nences by DRD2 allele. This pattern was also observed\nfor white males. Configurations in the middle panel\ndiffer significantly, with black males with A1\u00ad having\nsignificantly higher average continuation rates.\nCommon to all of these cases is M\u00b7t, indicating the\npresence of a mentor who is not a teacher. This\npattern was also observed among the white males.\nFinally, the bottom panel (M\u00b7T) shows configurations\nthat are, with few exceptions, significantly different in\ntheir continuation rates, with black males with A1\u00ad\nhaving the lowest average continuation rates.\nThe patterns suggested by Table 5 are shown in\nFigure 2. For black males without mentors, DRD2\nstatus does not make a difference for average continu-\nation rates (although the magnitude of the difference\nmay appear large, the difference is statistically\ninsignificant). Black males benefit from a mentor who\nis not a teacher only if they have A1\u00ad. These patterns\nwere both observed for white males. Likewise, only\nteachers as mentors compensate for A1+. Unlike white\nmakes, however, black males with A1\u00ad have much\nlower average contuinuation rates. While these data\npoints are based on few cases (12 for A1+ and 19 for\nA1\u00ad), the difference is statistically significant. We\nreturn to this finding in the final section of the paper.\nThe results show that, once again, the negative\nassociation between DRD2 status and average contin-\nuation rate is fully attenuated only by mentors who\nare teachers. A cross-tabulation of DRD2 status by\ntypes of mentors yields an insignificant omnibus test\n(chi-squared with 4 degrees of freedom = 4.69,\np = .321), indicating no global differences in DRD2\nstatus and mentoring. However, an inspection of the\ntable reveals that black males with A1+ are less likely\nrespectively), which was confirmed by a post hoc test\n(chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom = 3.94,\np = .047).

With respect to endogeneity, helpers\nare not randomly distributed across people: some\ntypes of people are more likely to elicit and maintain a\nrelationship with a helper. If people in need of help are\ndefined in terms of genetic propensity for risky behav-\nior, this pattern of endogeniety suggests a\ngene\u00adenvironment correlation according to which\nsuch people are least likely to be party to a helping\nrelationship. With respect to effectiveness, some\nhelpers are uniquely suited to help those in need\nbecause of their special skills and knowledge. The\nwell-intentioned neighbor or friend may or may not be\ncapable of helping with specific problems. Once again,\nif need is defined by genetic propensity for risky\nbehaviors, this reality suggests a gene\u00adenvironment\ninteraction according to which a specific risk's nega-\ntive implications are attenuated by certain types of\nhelp but not others. In short, perhaps people in need\nof specific help are likely to benefit from it but also\nunlikely to receive it. Cast in terms of DRD2, perhaps\nstudents with A1+ will benefit from teachers as\nmentors but be less likely to receive such support than\nstudents with A1\u00ad.\nThese complexities have been illustrated with the\nstrategic example of DRD2, mentors, and continua-\ntion beyond secondary school. After acknowledging\nlimitations to our empirical example, we discuss the\nfindings and then briefly consider the value of combi-\nnatoric approaches to the study of genetics, social\ncontext, and the life course.\nFirst, there is no `college gene.' Success in school\nand the likelihood of extending one's education\nbeyond secondary school undoubtedly depend on\nmany skills that are influenced by genetic action. Our\ntheoretical model posits that risk associated with\nDRD2 increases the likelihood of behaviors that\nundermine the student's ability to do well in school\nand thereby the likelihood of continuing one's educa-\ntion beyond high school. But what are these\nbehaviors that trace to DRD2 and that interfere with\nschool performance? Prior research is suggestive in\nonly molar terms: impulsivity, poor ability to learn\nbased on rewards and punishments, poor ability to\ndelay gratification. Exactly how students differ in\ntheir school-related behavioral repertoires is\nunknown, however.\nIn specific terms, how are DRD2 A1+ students dif-\nferent from A1\u00ad students? This question assumes\nspecial importance given that the continuation rates of\nboth white and black girls did not differ by DRD2\nallelic variant, and given the DRD2-teacher as mentor\ncorrelation. Males with DRD2 A1+ must differ pheno-\ntypically from males with A1\u00ad and, in turn, the A1+\nmales differ from the A1+ females. But how? The\nquestion calls for a genetically informed, classroom-\nbased ethnography. A related question for future\nresearch posed by the findings concerns black males\nand teachers as mentors. Drawing on the work of\nStanton-Salazar and Dornbusch (1995), we hypothe-\nsized that black males would not benefit from mentors\nwho are `institutional agents' of the school because\nsuch mentors typically do not share `subcultural\nvalues and norms' with racial and ethnic minority\nContinuation Rates for Stand-Out Configurations of Sets: Black Males\nConfiguration of sets Continuation rate Continuation for F, p Best fit\nother confiigurations n\nNote: Significance level for F test with 636 degrees of freedom.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

This expectation proved insightful\nwith respect to black males with A1\u00ad, but not for\nblack males with DRD2 A1+. There is very little\nresearch on minorities and school-based mentors and\nthe finding for the latter group is presently inexplica-\nble. Again, the new questions raised seem best suited\nto a genetically informed ethnography.\nSecond, given limitations in sample size and mea-\nsures, we can only consider a small number of\nrelevant indicators of mentors and genetic candi-\ndates. As with all studies conducted in a qualitative\ncomparative framework, our models were formu-\nlated with attention to theory and prior research.\nNevertheless, there are numerous genetic and social\ncandidates that could plausibly be incorporated into\nour models. With the larger genetic sample of Wave\nIV of Add Health, we will be able to examine many\nadditional, plausible possibilities.\nThird, because of our reliance on quasi-experimen-\ntal methods, we can not rule out the possibility of\nspurious findings. Perhaps DRD2 is not in itself\nimportant but rather it is closely associated with other\ngenetic candidates that are causally linked to behav-\niors that detract from one's educational\naccomplishments. Our conceptual model is based on\npersuasive evidence with respect to genetic and social\nmechanisms and indeed it generated a set of hypothe-\nses that proved insightful. Nevertheless, like all\nquasi-experimental studies, the present findings\nsupport provisional conclusions that call for further\nstudy informed by other theoretical frameworks and\ntested with other samples, measures, designs, and sta-\ntistical models.\nFinally, QCA is attractive as a descriptive frame-\nwork capable of detecting high levels of contingency\namong independent variables, but this is accomplished\nwith a multitude of contrasts, raising the possibility of\nfalse positives. Replication is especially important in\nthese circumstances. Indeed, our findings comport\nclosely with our expectations, which provides a solid\njustification for future replications.\nMentor\u00adDRD2 Interplay\nThe results suggest that DRD2 A1+ is associated with\ndecreased likelihood of school continuation (consistent\nwith Hypothesis 1), but only for boys (consistent with\nHypothesis 4) and these trends are considerable in mag-\nnitude. Further, as expected, teachers as mentors are\nable to compensate for this risk completely for white\nand black males and these trends are also considerable\nContinuation Rates by DRD2 Allele Within Configurations: Black Males\nConfiguration of sets Continuation rate Continuation rate F, p\nNote: Significance level for F test with 636 degrees of freedom.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Erickson, Stephen Vaisey, and Andrew Smolen\nin magnitude (Hypothesis 2). Among white males with\nA1+, about 43% with no mentor or a nonteacher\nmentor continued their educations beyond high school,\ncompared to 60% with a teacher as mentor (see\nFigure 1), a pattern yet more pronounced among black\nmales (see Figure 2). In contrast, nonteacher mentors\nhad no effect on average continuation rates, consistent\nwith Hypothesis 3. Perhaps because of their knowledge\nof the educational system and understanding of the\nstudent, teachers are uniquely qualified to advise stu-\ndents about their educations, including addressing\nissues of behavioral comportment in the classroom. It\nmay be that, lacking this unique perspective, non-\nteacher mentors were ineffective in fostering\neducational continuation.\nNevertheless, white and black males with A1+\nwere significanty less likely to report having a teacher\nas mentor, consistent with Hypothesis 4 and indicating\na gene\u00adenvironment correlation. Conceptual consider-\nations suggested that teachers were less likely to\nmentor students with A1+ than students without such\nrisk perhaps because the former's consistent patterns\nof impulsive behaviors and poor self-regulation made\nthem `poor investments' of limited helping resources.\nFinally, Hypothesis 6 predicted that the positive\neffects of teachers as mentors would not be observed\nfor black males. The evidence on this point is mixed.\nBlack males with A1+ benefit substantially from\nteachers as mentors and, in this sense, the (null)\nhypothesis is disconfirmed. Black males with A1\u00ad\nshow the hypothesized pattern, however. As suggested,\nan ethnographic study might help clarify the meaning\nof this pattern.\nThe over-arching pattern suggested by these data\nfor the white and black males is clear: the link\nbetween DRD2 A1+ and continuation beyond high\nschool is fully attenuated by mentors who are teach-\ners, but males with A1+ are less likely to have a\nmentor who is a teacher then males with A1\u00ad. As with\nall studies documenting gene\u00adenvironment interplay,\nreplication is essential.\nCombinatoric Strategies for Studying G\u00adE Interplay\nIn addition to revealing new findings and raising\nnew questions about the role of mentors in the edu-\ncational process, the present analyses also illustrate\nthe usefulness of a combinatoric approach to the\nstudy of gene\u00adenvironment interplay. Combinatoric\napproaches begin with the assumption that people\nbelong to sets and that sets form configurations. The\nsets may be defined by genetic, social, psychological,\nand other types of variables. The immediate issues\nthen become: which configurations of sets exist?\nHow common is membership in each configuration\nof sets? And how is membership in a configuration\nassociated with other variables, both antecedents\nand consequences?\nAs shown in the present example, such an\napproach is well-suited to studying gene\u00adenvironment\ncorrelations and interactions simultaneously. What\nallele\u00adsocial context configurations exist? And what is\nthe likelihood of being a member of a specific configu-\nration? These are questions that get to the heart of\ngene-environment correlations. In the present case,\nDRD2 A1+ decreased the likelihood of belonging to\nany configuration that included a teacher as mentor.\nAside from the percentage of people populating each\nconfiguration, are combinations of specific alleles and\nspecific contextual behaviors related to a criterion\nvariable in a nonlinear fashion? This is a question\nabout gene\u00adenvironment interactions. In the present\ncase, mentors who were not teachers increased the\nprobability of continuation, but only for students with\nA1\u00ad. Teachers alone, acting as mentors, were capable\nof neutralizing DRD2 A1+.\nBeyond the specific example of DRD2, mentor-\ning, and education, combinatoric strategies are a\npresently neglected but valuable analytic approach\nto the study of genetics and social context. Given\nspecific genotypes, what social circumstances are\npeople in? And how are these patterns, in turn,\nrelated to health and well-being? Sociological and\npsychological findings clearly establish the impor-\ntance of `significant others' for positive\ndevelopment. Future research will ideally join\ninsights from behavioral genetics with these find-\nings, drawing on analytic strategies that are\nsensitive to ongoing gene\u00adenvironment correlations\nand interactions.\n"
