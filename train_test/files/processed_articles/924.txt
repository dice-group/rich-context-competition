It is surprising,\ngiven the relatively consistent evidence that college stu-\ndents are drinking more than their non\u00adcollege-\nattending peers, that the results of at least one study sug-\ngest that they do not have higher rates of alcohol use\ndisorders.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to compare the\nprevalence of alcohol use disorders and alcohol use disor-\nder symptoms in college-attending young adults with their\nnon\u00adcollege-attending peers within the same study, in an\nattempttoreexaminetheearlierparadoxicalfindingsofSlut-\nske et al7 in a larger and more representative US national\nsample, and to explore whether there may be differences\nbetween men and women in the association between col-\nlege attendance and alcohol involvement.\nMETHODS\nThe data for this study were obtained from the public use data\n(NHSDA), an interview survey of 68929 individuals drawn from\nthe civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (including resi-\ndents of group quarters, such as college dormitories). The par-\nticipation rate for the interview was 73%. To protect the con-\nfidentiality of the participants, the public use file contained data\nfrom 55561 individuals that were randomly sampled from the\noriginal data set. Other steps were also taken to ensure confi-\ndentiality, such as excluding particular variables from the pub-\nlic use data set and collapsing response categories for certain\nquestions. The data collection procedures were approved by\nthe Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute.\nPARTICIPANTS\nParticipants aged 19 to 21 years who completed the NHSDA in-\nterview were selected for this study. The choice of this age range\nwasbasedonseveralconsiderations.Becausethefocusofthestudy\nwas past-year alcohol use disorders, 18-year-old participants were\nexcluded to minimize capturing any alcohol-related problems\nthat occurred prior to college in the college-attending sub-\nsample. Those older than 21 years were excluded to minimize\nthe inclusion of any college graduates in the non\u00adcollege-\nattending subsample. Finally, in an attempt to replicate the re-\nsults of Slutske et al,7 the same age range was included. There\nvey who were identified as either currently attending college full-\nor part-time (n=3184, 51%), or who were identified as not cur-\nwas 20 years (SE=0.02). Participants in college were slightly but\nsignificantly younger than those who were not in college (in col-\nlege, mean age=19.9 years; not in college, mean age=20.1 years;\nt=-5.63, P.001). Forty-nine percent of the participants were\nmale and 51% were female. Other demographic characteristics\nof the sample are summarized in Table 1.\nMEASURES\nStructured computer-assisted interviews for the NHSDA inter-\nview were conducted by a nationwide staff of approximately\n900 field interviewers. Most of the interview, including all of\nthe questions about alcohol involvement and alcohol use dis-\norders, was done using audio computer-assisted self-\ninterviews. Respondents listened to the questions read out loud\nthrough headphones while reading the question text on a com-\nputer screen. Respondents then keyed their numeric answers\ninto the computer. Prior to the interviews, respondents were\ntrained by the field interviewer in the use of the audio computer-\nassisted self-interview system, and the field interviewer re-\nmained in the room with the respondent throughout the in-\nterview. This system was used to provide respondents with\nprivacy and to increase the likelihood that they would feel com-\nfortable revealing sensitive information. A portion of the in-\nterview, including the questions about demographic charac-\nteristics, was administered as a computer-assisted personal\ninterview, in which the field interviewer read the questions out\nloud from the computer screen and keyed in the responses. There\nwere 223 (3.9%) interviews conducted in Spanish. Informed\nconsent for participation was obtained from all respondents prior\nto the survey.\nSeven different dichotomous indicators of frequency of alco-\nhol use were examined: lifetime, past-year and past-month use\nof any alcohol, past-year and past-month drinking at least once\na week (on average), past-month binge drinking at least once\na week (on average), and past-month daily drinking. The past-\nyear and past-month measures of weekly or daily drinking were\nderived from questions about the number of days in the past\nany alcohol. Drinking at least once a week in the past year was\nbased on the respondent reporting consuming alcohol on at least\n52 days of the year. Drinking at least once a week in the past\nmonth was based on the respondent reporting consuming al-\ncohol on at least 4 days of the month. The past-month mea-\nsure of weekly binge drinking was derived from a question about\nthe number of days in the past month that the respondent drank\nat least 5 drinks on one occasion. Binge drinking at least once\na week in the past month was based on the respondent report-\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics\nof the College-Age Sample\nCharacteristic No. (Weighted %)\nRace\nNative American/Alaskan/Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 100 (1)\nGeneral Equivalency Diploma (GED) 182 (3)\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Respondents who had con-\nsumed alcohol in the past month were also asked about the typi-\ncal quantity they consumed on the days that they drank in the\npast month. This continuous indicator was log transformed to\nreduce the positive skew of the distribution of responses.\nSymptoms of past-year DSM-IV11 alcohol dependence and abuse\nwere assessed. Diagnoses of alcohol dependence required that\nat least 3 of 7 dependence symptoms occurred in the past year.\nDiagnoses of alcohol abuse required that at least 1 of 4 abuse\nsymptoms occurred in the past year (in other words, a diag-\nnosis of alcohol abuse only required experiencing a single symp-\ntom). Diagnoses of alcohol abuse were made only for individu-\nals who did not meet the criteria for past-year alcohol\ndependence. A combined diagnosis of alcohol use disorder\n(DSM-IV alcohol dependence or abuse) was also examined. The\nestimates of DSM-IV alcohol dependence or abuse obtained in\namong women) were very similar to those obtained among the\n18- to 29-year-old participants in the National Longitudinal Al-\nand 10.1% among women) and the National Epidemiologic Sur-\nAll of the analyses were conducted using the survey estimation\ntechniques in Stata Release 8.013 to account for the stratified sam-\nplingemployedintheNHSDAandtoincorporatesamplingweights\nassociated with each observation. The sampling weights ad-\njusted the final sample so that it was demographically matched\nto the US census, and accounted for unequal participation rates\nof certain demographic groups (including college dormitory resi-\ndents). All of the sample percentages presented are based on the\nweighted data, and therefore will not match percentages calcu-\nlated from the unweighted sample sizes provided.\nFor categorical outcomes, the differences between those in\ncollege and not in college were tested with logistic regression,\npredicting the alcohol outcome from college attendance. For\nthe continuous outcome (typical quantity consumed), differ-\nences were tested with ordinary least squares regression. Sex\ndifferences in the strength of the association between an alco-\nhol outcome and college attendance was indicated by a signifi-\ncant interaction of college attendance by sex in the regression\nmodel. This method yields the same result as the Breslow-Day\ntest for the homogeneity of the odds ratio, but has the benefit\nof allowing for the inclusion of control variables such as age in\nthe analysis. Because of the well-documented differences be-\ntween men and women in their levels and rates of drinking and\nprevalence of alcohol use disorders, the comparison results of\ncollege students with their non\u00adcollege-attending peers were\ncontrolled for sex. Given the slight but significant difference\nin ages of the participants in college and not in college, all of\nthe comparison results were also controlled for age.\nRESULTS\nCollege students were no more or less likely than their\nsame-age peers not in college to be lifetime abstainers from\nalcohol, but they exceeded their non\u00adcollege-attending\npeers on all of the other indicators of yearly, monthly,\nand weekly alcohol use, as well as weekly binge drink-\ning (Table 2 and Table 3). Daily drinking, on the other\nhand, was more common among the young adults not\nin college.\nAmong young adults who drank any alcohol in the\npast month, the average amount of alcohol consumed\nmedian=3) for women.

The associations of the remaining indicators\nof alcohol use with college attendance did not differ for\nmen and women; there were no instances in which al-\ncohol use was more strongly associated with college at-\ntendance among men than women.\nTable 2.

The associations of the remain-\ning diagnoses and symptoms with college attendance did\nnot differ for men and women; there were no diagnoses\nor symptoms that were more strongly associated with col-\nlege attendance among men than women.\nEven if the heavy drinking at college contributes to the\ndevelopment of alcohol dependence, the problems may\ntake several years to develop. Therefore, differences\nbetween college students and their non\u00adcollege-\nattending peers may not become evident until later\nyears in school. This possibility was evaluated by exam-\nining whether the prevalence of alcohol dependence\nwas higher among college students in their later years\nin school compared with those in their first year.\nBetween both college-attending men and women, the\nprevalence of alcohol dependence was nearly identical\nFailure to find a difference in the prevalence of alco-\nhol dependence between those in college and those not\nin college may be due to the fact that the individuals suf-\nfering from alcohol problems are more likely to drop out\nof college, and therefore not remain in the college stu-\ndent subsample. Among the young adults who were not\ncurrently attending college, alcohol dependence was not\nmore prevalent among the 239 men who had previously\nattended some college compared with the 1297 men with\nthe 293 women who had previously attended some col-\nlege compared to the 1339 women with no previous col-\nThe failure to find a difference in the prevalence of\nalcohol dependence between those in college and those\nnot in college might be due to the inclusion of nontra-\nditional part-time students in the college-attending sub-\nsample. Among both the men and women who were\ncurrently attending college, alcohol dependence was\nnot more prevalent among the full-time vs the part-time\ndf, P=.54), and there still were not significant differ-\nences between college-attending and non\u00adcollege-\nthe prevalence of past-year alcohol dependence when\npart-time students were excluded from the college-\nattending subsample.\nCOMMENT\nIn a large representative national sample, 18% of US col-\nlege students (24% of men, 13% of women) suffered from\nclinically significant alcohol-related problems in the past\nyear, compared with 15% of their non\u00adcollege-\nattending peers (22% of men, 9% of women). College stu-\ndents were more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV\nalcohol abuse than their peers not in college, but de-\nspite the fact that those in college were drinking more,\nthey were not more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV\nalcohol dependence.\nSeveral possible explanations were explored for the\nlack of a difference in the prevalence of alcohol depen-\ndence among those in college vs those not in college. The\nlack of a difference could not be explained by the fact\nthat some college students in their earlier years in school\nmay not have had adequate time to develop problems,\nnor could it be explained by differential drop-out rates\nof those with alcohol dependence from college, or by the\ninclusion of nontraditional part-time students in the col-\nlege student subsample.\nThe results of this study are consistent with the sug-\ngestion of Slutske et al7 that college attendance may be\nassociated with experiencing some consequences of drink-\ning to a greater extent than others and that it may not\nnecessarily be related to a more pervasive syndrome of\nproblems that is required for a diagnosis of alcohol de-\npendence. This might be because certain symptoms are\nnot as relevant or noticeable against the backdrop of the\ncollege environment, or because college provides a buffer\nagainst experiencing certain alcohol-related problems,\ncompared to life outside of the college context. In addi-\ntion, there were some symptoms that were actually less\ncommon among those in college than their non\u00adcollege-\nattending peers, which also may have contributed to the\nlack of a difference for alcohol dependence as a whole.\nThe emerging picture of the relationship between al-\ncohol involvement and educational status and educa-\ntional attainment is complex. As previously illustrated\nbyresultsfromtheEpidemiologicCatchmentAreastudy,14\nthere may not be a simple linear relation between years\nof education and the probability of drinking or having\nan alcohol use disorder. For example, during high school,\nthose who are college bound drink less than those who\ndo not go on to college7,14-17; substance use disorders are\nassociated with the failure to enter college among high\nschool graduates.18 However, college students drink more\nthan their non\u00adcollege-attending peers during the college-\nage years.5-7 Lifetime alcohol use disorders are higher\namong those who attended some college but did not\ngraduate compared with those who graduated from high\nschool but had no college14 and those who graduated from\nhave higher rates of alcohol abuse than their non\u00adcollege-\nattending peers during college (present study), but col-\nlege graduates have the lowest rates of lifetime alcohol\nThis complicated array of findings suggests another\npossible explanation for the lack of a difference in the\nprevalence of alcohol dependence among those in col-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nlege vs those not in college. Samples of college students\ndo not include two groups most at risk for alcohol use\ndisorders, those who fail to graduate from high school\nand those who do not enter college. Thus, there may\nbe opposing forces at work: the association of alcohol\nuse disorders and the failure to graduate from high\nschool or to enter college, and the association of alcohol\nuse disorders and heavy drinking in college. These\ncombined opposing forces may sum to an overall lack\nof differences in alcohol dependence between those\nwho attend college and those who do not,7 and may\nalso explain why daily alcohol use and some alcohol\nuse disorder symptoms, such as withdrawal, are actu-\nally more common among those not in college than\nthose in college.\nThe results of this study raise several important ques-\ntions that warrant further investigation. First, why do col-\nlege students have higher rates of alcohol abuse than their\nnon\u00adcollege-attending peers? There is some evidence to\nsuggest that the association between college attendance\nand heavy/binge drinking can be explained by system-\natic differences between college students and their non\u00ad\ncollege-attending peers on factors such as race, family in-\ncome, marital status, or living arrangement.7,21 Other\nindicators of college student drinking (such as the fre-\nquency of getting drunk,7 the maximum quantity of al-\ncohol consumed in a single day,7 and driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol22) cannot be completely explained\nby such factors. For example, in a study of 73 young adult\nfemale twin pairs discordant for attending college (a study\ndesign that provides an ideal control for any family back-\nground characteristics that might explain the associa-\ntion between college attendance and alcohol involve-\nment), the college-attending twin exceeded her non\u00ad\ncollege-attending co-twin by nearly one half of a standard\ndeviation on the maximum amount of alcohol that she\nhad consumed in a single day in the past year.7 Such re-\nsults are consistent with the conclusion that some as-\npect of the college experience may be an important en-\nvironmental risk factor for certain aspects of drinking\namong young adults.7 It will be important to determine\nwhether the same is true for alcohol abuse. Nearly two\nthirds (62%) of recent high school graduates enrolled in\nence is a risk factor for the development of clinically sig-\nnificant alcohol use disorders, then it is a risk factor to\nwhich many of the young adults in the United States are\npotentially exposed.\nSecond, why is the increased risk of alcohol use dis-\norder associated with college attendance higher among\nwomen than men? It is unclear whether this can be in-\nterpreted as a more potent effect of the college environ-\nment on women than on men, whether it is better\nexplained by greater differences between college-\nattending vs non\u00adcollege-attending women than be-\ntween college-attending vs non\u00adcollege-attending men\non drinking-related background characteristics, or\nwhether it is better explained by the roles that relatively\nmore non\u00adcollege-attending women than non\u00adcollege-\nattending men have assumed by their college-age years\nthat might be related to reduced drinking (such as mar-\nriage or parenthood).\nThird, are the alcohol use disorders that occur among\ncollege students more or less transitory than those ex-\nperienced by their non\u00adcollege-attending peers? Al-\nthough it is generally assumed that the alcohol-related\nproblems among young adults are developmentally lim-\nited,24 it is clear that a substantial fraction continue to\nhave problems beyond the college-age years. Among the\n18- to 19-year-old young adults from a college-based and\na community-based longitudinal study who were diag-\nspectively, had an alcohol use disorder when followed\nup at age 25 years. To date, there are no longitudinal stud-\nies that have examined the relative persistence of alco-\nhol use disorders of college students vs those of their non\u00ad\ncollege-attending peers.\nThe results of this study provide a more encouraging\nmessage about the consequences of college drinking than\nmany of the recent reports--although college students\nsuffer from some clinically significant consequences of\ntheir heavy/binge drinking, they do not appear to be at\ngreater risk than their non-college attending peers for the\nmore pervasive syndrome of problems that is character-\nistic of alcohol dependence. Unfortunately, the alcohol-\nrelated problems that are associated with college often\nlead to some of the most dire consequences. For ex-\namong college students each year are due to the alcohol\nabuse symptom of being under the influence of alcohol\nwhen it is physically hazardous, that is, while driving a\ncar.5,22 Furthermore, such hazardous use does not just\nimperil the life of the college student, but also the lives\nof other passengers, and anyone else sharing the road.\nThe consequences of college student alcohol use disor-\nders extend well beyond the college campus.\nCorrespondence:  , Department\nof Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri-\n(slutskew@missouri.edu).\nFunding/Support: Preparation of this article was sup-\nported in part by National Institutes of Health grants\nvey on Drug Abuse was sponsored by the Office of Ap-\nplied Studies within the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration and was conducted by Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC.\nREFERENCES\n1.
