Some scholars attempt\nto explain the \"gap\" between consumers' attitudes and\nbehavior (Bray, Johns, & Kilburn, 2011; Carrigan & Attalla,\nars have asked whether consumers bear responsibility for\npurchasing unethically produced commodities (Barrera,\nfrom a normative standpoint. My aim is to distinguish among\nthe myriad types of ignorance that consumers manifest\ntoward the commodities they consume. The article is philo-\nsophical in intent and undertakes a conceptual analysis of the\nconditions under which consumers' ignorance may be\ndeemed culpable. What follows not only draws on philo-\nsophical work on ignorance and culpability but also contrib-\nutes to such work by refining aspects of it and applying it to\na topic hitherto neglected by philosophical research, namely,\nconsumption. The conceptual work, though philosophical in\nnature, reaches beyond a philosophical audience because it\nprovides a framework for future empirical work into the eth-\nics of consumption. Although highly enlightening, empirical\nwork on ethical consumption has heretofore lacked a clear\nanalytical framework with which to differentiate the multi-\nfaceted forms of unethical consumption behavior. This arti-\ncle suggests such a framework, one which will relate\nempirical study of ethical consumption to the normative con-\ncerns of moral philosophy.\nWhat is an unethically produced commodity? The ethical\ncriterion I use for a commodity's being unethically produced\nis that its production involves harm or injustice being\ninflicted on innocent parties. Innocent parties are numerous\nand include\ni. fellow humans beings, for example, sweatshop labor-\ners who produce commodities or farm laborers who\nare exposed to toxic chemicals when they harvest\ncrops destined for the market;\nii. future human beings, for example, those to whom we\nwill bequeath depleted and inadequate environmental\nresources as a result of our consumption choices;\niii. non-human animals, for example, those kept under\ndetrimental conditions and turned into feed for\nhumans, or those on whom cosmetics are tested.\nThese categories are not exhaustive; some people, for\ninstance, would include plant life among those parties that\nhuman economic activity harms. The examples I discuss in\nthis article reveal the diversity of innocent parties, and I will\nnot add to the categories of innocent parties here. More\nimportant, by way of introduction, is to clarify the wrongful-\nness involved in purchasing unethically produced commodi-\nties and its relationship to ignorance and culpability.\nPurchasing unethically produced commodities is wrong-\nful because of the harm it causes to others or the injustices\nthat are perpetuated through purchasing such commodities.\nConsumers are usually not the direct perpetrators of these\nharms and injustices; the latter are more often perpetrated by\nbusinesses that produce the commodities in question.\nConsumers are nevertheless implicated in the harm and injus-\ntice that extend along the value chains along which commodi-\nties travel. They are implicated in the sense that their decisions\n1York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMark Peacock, Department of Social Science, York University, Ross\nEmail: mpeacock@yorku.ca\nMarket Processes and the Ethics of\nConsumption\nMark Peacock1\n Keywords\nethical consumption, market process, culpable ignorance, attitude\u00adbehavior gap\n2 SAGE Open\nto purchase such commodities contribute to the profitability\nof corporations that perpetrate harms and injustices.\nConsumers are therefore a causal force in sustaining unethi-\ncal business practices. Consumers are often ignorant of these\nharms and injustices, and the question at the core of this\nstudy is \"Under which circumstances does consumers' igno-\nrance absolve them of culpability for the existence of wrongs\nfor which they are partly causally responsible on account of\ntheir purchase of unethically produced commodities?\" By\nfocusing on consumers in this article, I do not intend to\ndeflect attention from the culpability of corporations (or of\ngovernments) for their role in the existence of unethically\nproduced commodities. My enquiry into consumers' culpa-\nbility should not therefore be interpreted to imply that con-\nsumers alone bear responsibility for the persistence of\nunethical economic practices. Rather, my aim is to theorize,\nfrom an ethical point of view, the role of consumers in the\npersistence of such practices and how consumers can act to\nreduce or avoid culpability.\nThe structure of the article is as follows. The section\n\"Market Processes and the Division of Knowledge,\" gives an\naccount of how markets function which turns on the notion of\nignorance. This \"Austrian\" account of market processes holds\nthat a merit of the market is its epistemological modesty. The\nclaim is that markets function relatively well despite market\nparticipants' ignorance about many characteristics of the\ncommodities they buy and the processes through which they\nare produced. Market participants can therefore economize\non knowledge about market processes while remaining able\nto make rational economic decisions on a slim epistemologi-\ncal foundation. Consumers'lack of knowledge about the con-\nditions under which commodities are produced means,\nhowever, that they often lack information necessary for mak-\ning ethical consumption decisions. In the section\n\"Preliminaries and Caveats,\" I clarify a few preliminaries and\ncaveats to explain why I focus on consumers' culpability\nrather than that of corporations or governments. The norma-\ntiveanalysisbeginsinthesection\"IgnoranceandCulpability,\"\nin which I ask whether the notion of \"affected ignorance\"\n(Moody-Adams, 1997) provides a good depiction of consum-\ners' role in unethical market practices. If it is, it follows that\nconsumers' ignorance is culpable. My discussion leads me to\ndraw a number of distinctions within the category of igno-\nrance and its culpable nature. In the section \"Degrees of\nCulpability,\" I consider circumstances that might lessen the\ndegree of culpability we ascribe to consumers for being igno-\nrant, and the section \"Precepts for Ethical Consumption,\"\ncontains precepts to guide ethical consumption.\nMarket Processes and the Division of\nKnowledge\nThe knowledge argument in Austrian economic theory is\nthe purpose of this article, I look at one aspect of the argument\nthat concerns the division and dissemination of knowledge in\na market economy and its relevance for consumers' deci-\nsions. This allows me to take up the argument of the follow-\ning section which considers the knowledge necessary for\nconsuming ethically.\nConsider the following situation of a consumer:\nFood reaches his local supermarket through processes of which\nhe is probably ignorant, if not misinformed. He lives in a home\nconstructed by an involved process whose technical, economic,\nand political intricacies are barely suspected, much less known\nto him. His home is likely to be stocked with many devices\nworking on mechanical and technical principles which he\nneither understands theoretically nor can cope with as a practical\nOur ignorance of the details of products we consume is\nnot a barrier to our ability to make serviceable decisions\nbecause much information is conveyed to us in the form of\nrelative prices. If the price of an item of food falls relative to\nthose of other foodstuffs, a consumer can buy more of this\nfood and economize on other items. She does not need to\nknow about the technical development in farming methods\nwhich has brought about the reduction in price to make a\nrational consumption decision. This applies to businesses\nthat use this food in their production processes, for example,\nrestaurants. If, for instance, the price of a particular olive oil\nfalls, restaurateurs can substitute relatively more expensive\nolive (and other) oils with this cheaper rival. Why the price of\na particular type of olive oil has fallen is not something res-\ntaurant owners need to know; that a supplier of olive oil has\noffered them this cheaper variety suffices, and the technical\ndevelopment in olive cultivation in Turkey, which has caused\nthe fall in price, is something of which they may remain\nignorant. The decision of a restaurant owner to use the\ncheaper oil can be conveyed to consumers in the form of\nlower priced meals. The consumer, too, is ignorant of what\nhas gone on upward in the supply chain to make the price of\nmeals at this particular restaurant cheaper. But what occurred\nin Turkey to reduce the price of olives is communicated to\nmarket participants in the form of price information. And the\nknowledge that led to the technical development in Turkish\nagriculture, and which might be known in all its details only\nto a few agricultural scientists, becomes dispersed in the\nmarket, although the market participants who benefit from\nthe technical development know nothing of its details but\nonly its effects on prices. One such group of market partici-\npants are consumers whose knowledge seldom extends to the\ntechnical details of production, the source of raw materials,\nthe modes of transport involved in conveying goods to retail-\ners, or to the activities of the corporations in whose name\ncommodities are produced. In fact, there are innumerable\ndetails of the genealogy of commodities of which consumers\nare typically ignorant. This has implications for consumers\nwho wish to consume ethically.\nConsider the following examples:\n1. The wedding ring on my finger hails from South\nAmerica where a mining corporation has developed a\nnew mining technique that allows it to undercut\ncompetitors.\n2. The T-shirt I wear was made in southeast Asia at a\nlow price that reflects an innovative personnel policy\nused by a textile factory.\n3. The price of beef falls thanks to a change in institu-\ntional conditions in the Amazon Basin.\nThere is much about which consumers of wedding rings,\nT-shirts, and beef are ignorant in such examples. Let us fill in\na few details:\nAd (1) The new mining technique involves the detonation\nof explosives which removes the summits of mountains\nand exposes the ore that can be mined cheaply. This\ncauses environmental damage, leaving the landscape\nscarred and the water table polluted, thus causing a short-\nage of fresh water on which many communities depend.\nAd (2) The innovative personnel policy consists of out-\nlawing workers' associations and collective bargaining, a\nmeasure passed by a military government and enforced by\nthe army that has a permanent presence in textile facto-\nries. This ensures a cheap and disciplined labor force.\nAd (3) The price of beef has fallen due to the conversion\nof forest land to cattle farming. This causes deforestation\nand is enabled by the government having granted property\nrights on the hitherto \"unowned\" land to large cattle farm-\ning corporations. These farmers clear the land of aborigi-\nnal communities who have lived on it for generations\nwithout having a formal title to the land; members of such\ncommunities who resist and organize protest against cat-\ntle farmers are intimidated and forced from the land; some\nlose their lives.\nIn example (1), consumers benefit from the knowledge of\nthe mining innovation when they purchase a wedding ring,\nyet they have no direct knowledge of how the ore is mined.\nThe mining technique will have given the mining corporation\na competitive advantage that is reflected in a lower relative\nprice of rings. It is through such relative price differentials,\nnot through direct knowledge of the innovation itself, that\nconsumers are alerted to the existence of the new mining\ntechnique. If consumers possessed such knowledge, many\nwould not buy rings because they hold their mode of produc-\ntion to be unethical. Such examples reveal that consumers'\nignorance of market processes can lead them to purchase\ncommodities of which they would not approve ethically were\nthey to know more about them. That is, because of their igno-\nrance, consumers are implicated in the perpetuation of injus-\ntices in the supply chain. By purchasing such commodities,\nconsumers commit wrongdoing because they are ignorant\nabout these commodities. Whether they are blameworthy for\ndoing so depends on whether their ignorance is culpable.\nPreliminaries and Caveats\nBefore diving into the theme of consumer ignorance and cul-\npability, I clarify some limitations I draw around my analy-\nsis. First, many people lay the blame for unethical market\npractices at the door of corporations that produce commodi-\nties unethically. \"If only corporations were to produce ethi-\ncally, consumers would not need to worry about purchasing\nunethical products,\" one might say. This is a cogent argu-\nment, and ethical-consumer activism should indeed draw\nattention to corporate misdemeanors as a means to outlawing\nthe malfeasance of business. Often, corporations only\nimprove their ethical record when it is revealed that their\nbusiness practice transgresses ethical norms. Corporations'\nattempts to \"conceal their sourcing practices\" (Oxfam, 2013,\np. 33) represent a barrier to consumers who wish to over-\ncome their ignorance about corporations' practices. Without\nwishing to make light of the ethical dubiety of many corpo-\nrate practices, I take the existence of such malfeasance as a\nregrettable fact of life for the foreseeable future. The ques-\ntion regarding consumers then becomes \"Given the existence\nof unethically made products, is consumers' ignorance about\nthese products culpable, even if other actors, namely corpo-\nrations, are the primary perpetrators of injustices committed\nin the production process?\" The discussion that follows,\nthen, is a contribution to \"non-ideal theory\" (Rawls, 2001, p.\n13). That is, I am considering a market society that is not\n\"well-ordered\" in the sense that not everyone--certainly not\nevery corporation--\"strictly complies\" with widely accepted\nethical principles regarding commodity production.\nThe non-ideality of my analysis applies also to govern-\nment. Government, some people hold, is responsible for pun-\nishing unethical corporate practices. If government carried\nout this task perfectly, consumers would not be in a position\nin which they would have the option of consuming unethi-\ncally produced commodities, for government would prohibit\nthe sale of all such commodities. In this way, government\ncould divest consumers of the moral burden they currently\nface, namely, the burden of deciding whether to become\nmore informed about commodities with a view to cease pur-\nchasing those of an ethically dubious nature. Governments,\nhowever, do not ban the production or sale of all unethically\nproduced commodities, nor can they realistically be expected\nto do so. One reason for this is that consumers hold ethical\nvalues which governments wish not to endorse legislatively.\nConsumers, for instance, who find the slaughter of animals\nmorally unacceptable will hope in vain that government will\nprohibit the sale of meat, for a broad consensus on this policy\ndoes not appear to exist. The moral burden of whether to\nconsume meat remains, therefore, in the judgment of each\nconsumer. However vigilant a government might be in pass-\ning and enforcing laws about consumer goods, the law will\nnever correspond exactly to any consumer's ethical values.\nThis gap between law and a consumer's ethical values will\nalways mean that the ethical burden cannot be carried by\ngovernment alone.\n4 SAGE Open\nGovernment can nevertheless fulfill a different role that\nfalls short of prohibiting ethically unacceptable of commodi-\nties, namely, providing information about commodities so\nthat consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.\nThis is precisely what government does when it insists that\nnutritional information be provided about the foods we con-\nsume or when it decrees that imported items carry a \"Made\nin _____\" label. Such information can serve as a fillip to\nethical consumption, for it gives consumers access to infor-\nmation, which allows them to make ethical consumption\ndecisions. A proponent of ethical consumption should, cer-\ntainly, support further-reaching informational policies and\nhold accountable a government that did not provide informa-\ntion with which consumers could fully assess the ethical con-\nstitution of commodities.\nA further limitation on government concerns international\ntreaties. A member state of the European Union (EU), for\ninstance, must uphold the \"country of origin principle\"\nwhereby corporations that export goods to any EU state must\ncomply with the regulations of their home country only, not\nwith those of other EU states in which their goods are sold.\nThis limits, say, the Irish government's power to outlaw\nproducts made in Slovakia which the Irish populace deems\nethically unseemly. Whether European governments made\nan ethically defensible decision when they agreed to the\ncountry of origin principle does not fall within the purview\nof this article, but the existence of the principle creates an\nethical onus for consumers whose government may not ban\ncommodities that its citizens find ethically unacceptable.\nThis is a further aspect of the non-ideal world the consumer\ninhabits.\nIgnorance and Culpability\nThe processes of production through which commodities are\ncreated are often unethical. One reason such processes per-\nsist is because consumers are ignorant of their details.\nConsumers' ignorance is thus a causal factor for the exis-\ntence of unethically produced commodities and this causal\nrole leads us to ask how much responsibility consumers bear\nfor their ignorance that perpetuates unethical business prac-\ntices. Under some circumstances, ignorance excuses a per-\nson who performs a wrongful act. This section enquires into\nthe extent of the culpability of consumers' ignorance which\nleads them to undertake wrongful acts of consumption.\nLet us start the discussion by attending to Michele Moody-\nAdams' notion \"affected ignorance\" as a basis for exploring\nconsumers' ignorance. Consider two examples:\n1. Actively shielding oneself from others'knowledge so\nas to remain isolated from the consequences of\nactions in which one is involved. Moody-Adams\noffers the example of the CEO of an investment bank\nwho instructs her staff to increase profits but insists\nthat they not inform her about their means of doing so\n(and about the \"potential wrongdoings\" they commit\nin carrying out the CEO's instruction).\n2. Not acknowledging one's own fallibility, e.g. a uni-\nversity administrator who declines to investigate\ncharges of misconduct against a colleague because\nthe latter \"`couldn't possibly' be guilty of sexual\nOf what are the CEO and the university administrator\nignorant in these examples? Using a distinction drawn by\nAllen Buchanan (1996), we may distinguish two types of\nignorance, each of which may account for a person's wrong-\ndoing. The first type is factual ignorance, when a person\nlacks the factual basis for judging the nature of a particular\nsituation. Buchanan draws his distinction in a study of human\nradiation experiments conducted in the United States from\nharmful radiation by government-sponsored scientists. If,\narguendo, we suppose that the scientific knowledge of the\nday led scientists who conducted experiments to judge the\nrisk to subjects of these experiments to be non-existent, we\nwould absolve the scientists of culpability for their actions.\nTheir actions, to be sure, were wrong because they harmed\nexperimental subjects; but the fact that they would have\nacted in the faith that they were not harming their subjects\nlessens the culpability of their acts. Buchanan's second type\nof ignorance is moral ignorance whereby a person is \"unable\nto discern what he ought to do because he is unable to make\nson is morally ignorant when she cannot ascertain what is\nright and what wrong in the way that other people can. For\ninstance, if I break a promise, believing that there is nothing\nwrong in doing so, I am morally ignorant about the right\ncourse of action.\nReturning to Moody-Adams' two examples, the igno-\nrance of the CEO and the university administrator is better\ninterpreted not as moral but as factual; they are ignorant\nabout morally relevant facts, but their moral sense itself is\nnot faulty.1 If the CEO knew about her staff's methods, be\nthey fraudulent, threatening, and so forth, for increasing\nprofits, she would presumably be morally disturbed; her\nrequest not to be informed about these methods makes little\nsense without this assumption. The university administrator\nfails to investigate the allegations against his colleague, not\nbecause he finds sexual harassment harmless, but because he\nfinds it incredible that his colleague could be guilty of sexual\nharassment. This description makes it clear that the adminis-\ntrator holds sexual harassment to be execrable. Although the\nCEO and the administrator share a factual type of ignorance,\ntheir ignorance differs in a way to which I now turn.\nThe CEO is aware that her staff will use dubious means to\nincrease company profits; this explains her instruction to\nthem to keep their knowledge of these means to themselves.\nThrough her instructions, the CEO actively cultivates her\nstate of ignorance: She is ignorant of the details of her staff's\ndoings, yet she knows there is something--probably morally\ndistasteful--of which she wishes to remain ignorant. (In a\ndifferent context, Donald Rumsfeld described such doings as\n\"known unknowns\"). The CEO's ignorance corresponds to\nMoody-Adams' (1997) definition of affected ignorance as\ninvolving \"a choice not to know something that is morally\nimportant\" (p. 102) or, in an earlier formulation, \"choosing\nnot to know what one can and should know\" and thereby\ncommitting or perpetuating injustice (Moody-Adams, 1994,\np. 296). The CEO's awareness of the (probably immoral)\nmethods to be used by her staff presents her with two options:\n(a) investigating these methods and (b) remaining ignorant\nabout them. She opts for (b), but her awareness of option (a)\nmeans that she is making a choice. The CEO's position is\nlike that of the doctor who crops up in many philosophical\nwritings on culpable ignorance (e.g., Montmarquet, 1995;\nSmith, 1983). The doctor has not kept up with innovations in\nhis field as disseminated in medical journals; \"he is aware\nthat he should read a certain article, yet decides . . . to take\ndoctor is aware that the article might contain something of\nrelevance but he decides not to read it and thereby risks\ninflicting deleterious consequences on his patients.\nCompare this with the university administrator. He is fac-\ntually unaware of any wrongdoing on his colleague's part,\nbut unlike the CEO, he does not actively cultivate his igno-\nrance. By not acknowledging the fallibility of his opinion,\nthe administrator does not deliberately keep himself in the\ndark about the facts of the matter; rather it simply does not\nstrike him as possible that his colleague could be involved in\nsuch sordid affairs. The administrator, therefore, does not\nchoose to remain ignorant about a morally important fact of\nwhich he is more or less aware; for, to make a choice, the\nadministrator would have to be aware that an investigation\ninto the allegation might reveal the colleague's misconduct,\nbut this is precisely what the administrator cannot entertain.\nThe administrator's case is therefore not one of affected\nignorance if, following Moody-Adams, affected ignorance\nrequires that one make a choice not to apprise oneself of facts\nwhich one could find out. The administrator's position is like\nthat of the doctor who has not kept up with innovations in his\nfield, though in a different scenario from that of the previous\nparagraph. In this second scenario, the doctor does not read\nthe article in the medical journal because he considers read-\ning the journal in which it appears unnecessary for those in\nhis field (perhaps he thinks that significant innovations in\nmedicine are published only in more prestigious journals).\nThe doctor does not think it feasible that the journal in ques-\ntion could carry an article of any significance.\nThe two previous paragraphs issue in what I call the\nawareness condition for culpable ignorance:\nAwareness condition: For an agent's ignorance to be\ndeemed culpable, the agent must be aware that, by main-\ntaining her state of ignorance, there exists a risk that some\nmorally undesirable state of affairs will arise or be per-\npetuated through her actions.2\nAn agent who fulfills the awareness condition makes a\nchoice between remaining ignorant or enlightening herself\nabout the details of the case. The CEO does, but the adminis-\ntrator does not, fulfill this condition.\nWe have thus distinguished two types of factual igno-\nrance: one is when the ignorant person is aware--perhaps\ndimly--that he or she is ignorant of something and chooses\nto maintain or propagate his or her ignorance; in the other\ntype, the ignorant person is unaware that there is anything\nabout which he or she is ignorant (these matters correspond\nto Donald Rumsfeld's \"unknown unknowns\"); such a person\ndoes not choose to be ignorant but simply is ignorant. Each\ntype of factual ignorance leads to a particular normative con-\nclusion about a person who is thus ignorant. Let us begin\nwith the first type.\nThe CEO is ignorant of facts which, because of their moral\nsignificance, might lead her, were she to be cognizant of\nthem, to assess a situation as morally dubious. She should be\ncensured for willfully maintaining her ignorance instead of\nscrupulously overseeing her staff's activities and stipulating\nin advance that their methods be above board.3 Her self-culti-\nvated ignorance is culpable. The university administrator, by\ncontrast, does not cultivate his ignorance but simply is igno-\nrant in that he has no suspicion that wrongdoing could be\nafoot. We might be inclined to be lenient on such a person\nbecause, unlike the CEO, he does not actively cultivate his\nignorance. But he might nevertheless be condemned for not\nentertaining the merest suspicion that potentially disquieting\nmatters are afoot. One might say the administrator should be\naware of the possibility that there is substance to the allega-\ntions, and that he should, therefore, investigate them. Let us\nask what light the foregoing sheds on consumers' ignorance.\nAffected Ignorance and Consumers' Behavior\nIf it can be argued that consumers affect their ignorance of\nthe injustices perpetrated in the production of the commodi-\nties they consume, their ignorance is culpable. By viewing\nthe matter through the lens of affected ignorance, we direct\nattention toward some types of consumer but not others.\nBracketed from the following analysis are, for instance,\n\"moral backsliders.\" A moral backslider (Hare, 1965) is an\nagent who knows the morally correct course of action but\nknowingly refrains from following it. He or she commits\nwrongdoing in awareness that his or her act is wrongful. In\nthe realm of consumption, many people, I suspect, purchase\ncommodities knowing full well that they are unethical. The\nconsumer who said the following about his or her consump-\ntion of fair-trade products probably falls into this category:\n\"I've thought some times that I should be more ethical in\nwhat I buy . . . but part of me is quite lazy actually\"\n(Chatzidakis, Hibbert, & Smith, 2007, p. 92). The authors of\n6 SAGE Open\nthe study in which this response was given classify it under\nthe heading of \"appeal to higher loyalties,\" though \"being\nlazy\" would seem to indicate little more than self-interest\nrather than any \"higher\" value. The consumer might be\nexpressing a preference for being lazy, but he or she is not\nthereby making a recognizably moral argument with which\nhe or she tries to justify his or her behavior. The consumer, I\nwould argue, is not ignorant of his or her wrongdoing, and\nthis obviates the need to ask whether his or her ignorance is\nculpable, as it does for all moral backsliders.\nA second category of consumer bracketed from the fol-\nlowing analysis consists of those who may be deemed mor-\nally ignorant in Buchanan's terminology. Such people, to\nrecall, have faulty moral judgment such that we say of them\nthat they cannot make the moral judgments that most people\nare able to make. A study by the Marketing Society (2010),\nfor instance, found that 20% of consumers \"didn't care\n[about] or weren't interested\" in environmental sustainabil-\nity and did not consume according to environmental con-\ncerns. This is a moral deficiency (especially regarding our\nobligations to future generations and the environmental qual-\nity we bequeath to them). However, although there might be\nsubstantial numbers of such morally ignorant consumers,\nsuch cases take us away from the focus on factual ignorance.\nA discussion of moral ignorance would require that we\nexamine what is meant when we say that a person cannot\nmake correct moral judgments; if a person literally cannot\nmake such judgments, the philosophical maxim \"ought\nimplies can\" would have us believe that the person who is\nunable to judge ethical matters correctly is not culpable.\nThis, though, is a discussion for a different occasion. For the\npurpose of this study, I am interested only in cases in which\na consumer occupies a different epistemological position to\nthat of backsliders or those who are morally ignorant. This\nepistemological position is marked out by the following two\npoints. Consumers are\ni. aware of the possibility of injustices surrounding\ncommodities they consume;\nii. not sufficiently aware of the disturbing details to pre-\nvent them from purchasing them (cf. Smith, 1983, p.\nThe backslider does not fulfill Condition (ii)--he is fully\naware of the details of the commodities he purchases and he\nknows he ought not to purchase them. The person with defi-\ncient moral judgment does not fulfill Condition (i), for she\ndoes not recognize anything morally wrong about purchas-\ning unethically produced commodities.\nLet us consider a representative consumer whose con-\nsumption habits and ethical attitudes correspond to those of\nmany consumers. The representative consumer buys grocer-\nies from large supermarket chains, brand-name clothing\nfrom multinational retailers, and non-sustainable furniture;\nshe ignores fair-trade products and drives a car with a high\nrate of fuel consumption. Asked about her ethical views, the\nconsumer answers the following questions affirmatively:\na. Would you be concerned about cotton farmers in India\nincurring high levels of debt and being driven to sui-\ncide?\nb. Would it worry you if textile workers in southeast Asia\nwere routinely exposed to unsafe working conditions?\nc. Would it trouble you to know that major clothing re-\ntailers sourced textiles from factories in which below-\nschool-aged children were employed?\nd. Do you think that deforestation is a matter of concern?\ne. Does the finite nature of fossil fuels mean that human\nbeings should economize on their use?\nf. Are you disturbed that rising sea levels, which result\nfrom climate change, poses a threat to the survival of\nmany of the world's species and of people in parts of\nthe world?\nBecause she answers these questions affirmatively, this\nconsumer manifests the gap between her consumption\nbehavior and her ethical beliefs. Her acts of consumption are\nwrongful because they are implicated in harming others or\nperpetuating injustice. But before we judge her blamewor-\nthy, we must enquire to what extent she is ignorant of the\nmatters mentioned in points (a) to (f), and whether her igno-\nrance is culpable.\nWhen probed further, our representative consumer reveals\nrudimentary awareness of ethical issues that pertain to cer-\ntain business practices. She has not actively sought informa-\ntion about such matters but has been informed about them\nincidentally--through newspaper reports, television news\nitems, or conversations with acquaintances. Beyond this\nrudimentary awareness, she takes no measures to inform her-\nself further such that she would be in a position to compre-\nhend her own causal role as a consumer in these processes,\nand hence she does not change her consumption habits. Our\nrepresentative consumers' ignorance is akin to that of\nMoody-Adams' CEO, for the consumer fulfills the aware-\nness condition described in the section \"Preliminaries and\nCaveats.\" That is, she is situated epistemologically in that\nin-between space in which the question of culpable igno-\nrance arises: She knows a little but not too much about the\ncommodities she purchases; she has enough evidence to give\nrise to the suspicion that she might be contributing to injus-\ntice, but she has \"insufficient evidence to warrant holding\npurchasing a particular commodity. The representative con-\nsumer's ignorance is culpable.\nThe source of the representative consumer's ignorance is,\nfollowing Smith (1983), an objectionable psychological\nstate that leads her to choose not to overcome or reduce her\nignorance. This objectionable psychological state consists in\nwillingness to risk the perpetuation of injustice through acts\nof unethical consumption based on ignorance; indifference to\nthis risk, then, is how one might best characterize this objec-\ntionable psychological state. The agent's willingness to risk\nthe perpetuation of injustice presupposes that she is aware of\nthe risk but ignores it.\nDegrees of Culpability\nThe representative consumer depicted above is culpably\nignorant because she is indifferent to a risk, of which she is\naware. This constitutes a culpably objectionable psychologi-\ncal state. This example constitutes our baseline for culpable\nignorance, yet it is only the beginning of an analysis of cul-\npability, for the situation of actual consumers deviates from\nthat of our representative consumer in many ways. The ways\nin which their situation differs from that of the representative\nconsumer can change their degree of culpability, as we shall\nnow see.\nOne way of exploring degrees of culpability attributable\nto consumers is via the awareness condition, the fulfillment\nof which requires that consumers be aware of a risk that a\nmorally undesirable state of affairs will arise or be perpetu-\nated if they maintain their ignorance. Following a line of\nrance is only culpable if the act of consumption, which\nensues from ignorance about the unethical nature of the com-\nmodity purchased, \"falls within the known risk\" (Smith,\nables regarding this risk influence the degree of culpability\nof the consumer's ignorance:\n1. the magnitude of the risk;\n2. the moral severity of the consequences, should the\nundesirable state of affairs actually ensue as a result\nof her act of consumption.\nI postpone elucidation of Variable (2) until the next sec-\ntion in the discussion of the second moral precept for ethical\nconsumption. Here I explore Variable (1).\nThe magnitude of the risk and the consumer's degree of\nculpability are positively related. Consider a consumer who\nbuys cheap clothing made in Bangladesh and who has some\nawareness of the risk that he is thereby perpetuating working\nconditions in textile factories which he considers unjust. His\nunethical act of consumption \"falls within the known risk\" of\nhis ignorance because the risk involved is self-evident: The\nconditions of production under which cheap clothing is man-\nufactured in developing countries are widely known, and the\ndeplorable working conditions in textile factories are, as it\nwere, internally related to the production of the T-shirts (and\nto their low prices), for low wages and poor working condi-\ntions are a fillip, perhaps necessary, to the production of\ncheap clothing. In Michael Zimmerman's (1997) words,\nthere is a straightforward \"cognitive connection\" between\nthe existence of cheap T-shirts in retail stores and the sort of\npay and conditions which the workers who produce them\nsuffer (p. 420). If a consumer were to plead that he had no\ninkling that purchasing these items were likely to perpetuate\ninjustices, his words are unlikely to convince. This would\nlead us to say that the consumer ought to have known about\nthe risk that buying cheap T-shirts, and the fact that he did\nnot know (or claimed not to have known) does not absolve\nhim. This is not, however, always the case, as a different\nexample shows.\nThe pharmaceutical corporation Roche, which produces a\ndrug called CellCept, presents such a case (Schrempf-\nStirling, 2014). CellCept hinders the rejection of transplanted\norgans by their hosts. Roche's development of this drug\nrelied on the acquisition of organs taken from executed pris-\noners in China. Consider, in light of this, a person who\nreceives treatment using a different product manufactured by\nRoche, for example, an intravenously administered antibac-\nterial solution. We may say that consuming any Roche prod-\nuct is wrongful because it contributes to the profitability of a\ncorporation that produces at least one commodity using\nunethical means. The consumer who purchases the antibacte-\nrial solution would, however, be absolved of the guilt associ-\nated with contributing to the profitability of Roche because\nthe connection between the bacterial solution and CellCept is\nremote; we would not say that the consumer ought to know\nabout this connection. Culpability would therefore stop with\nthe corporation but not seep to the level of the consumer.\nIf we consider now consumers of CellCept itself, one fea-\nture of the case should make us wary of generalizing it to\nother commodities. CellCept is a potentially lifesaving drug\nfor a patient undergoing organ transplantation. Consider a\npatient who knows about Roche's use of executed prisoners'\norgans in testing the drug. The ethical consumer must con-\nsider the effects of refusing to take such a drug. If there are\nfew or only less effective alternatives to CellCept, the chance\nof losing one's life as a result of organ rejection is a high\nmoral cost of refusing to take the drug. A patient would jus-\ntifiably hold the moral value of increasing her chance of\npost-transplant survival to be higher than the moral value of\nextricating herself from complicity in the use of executed\nprisoners'organs. This would be an example of moral weigh-\ning, whereby a person weighs the wrongness of committing\nan immoral act (in this case consuming CellCept) against the\nmoral gain to be had (increasing life expectancy by taking\nthe drug).4 We might forgive a consumer of CellCept for\nholding the gain to be of higher moral value to herself than\nthe immorality of being implicated in a commodity with an\nunethical biography. This is not a case of moral backsliding\nbecause the consumer does not, all things considered, believe\nthat her consumption of the drug is wrong on account of the\npositive moral effects it is likely to have in prolonging her\npost-transplant life. Neither is it a case of ignorance, for the\nconsumer has sufficient information about the product to\nmake a sound ethical judgment.\nCellCept may be described as a \"high-stake\" commodity.\nIf the consumption of a particular commodity is likely to\n8 SAGE Open\nhave profound moral effects on the life of the consumer (in\nthe case of CellCept, increasing the consumer's life expec-\ntancy), that commodity is, for this consumer, of high stake.\nOther commodities involve a lower stake in the sense that the\nconsequences of not purchasing them are of little or no moral\nconsequence.5 If, for instance, I refrain from buying what I\nconsider to be ethically dubious clothing made in Vietnam,\nmy moral sacrifice is not great: By thus refraining, I will\nhave to spend more money to pay for ethically sourced cloth-\ning, but for people of comfortable means, this is not a moral\nsacrifice. One consideration, then, in judging a consumer's\nculpability concerns the moral sacrifice one would have to\nmake if one were to refrain from consuming a particular\ncommodity. In the case of CellCept, the sacrifice is poten-\ntially great; in the case of clothing it is usually not great.\nIn the previous example, I stated that, for people of com-\nfortable means, the sacrifice involved in buying ethically\nsourced clothing is not great. But for the less well-to-do, the\nsacrifice can be high. Consider a not atypical U.S. resident\nwho supports two dependents, works 40 hr per week, and\nearns US$8.50 per hour (above the minimum wage). If such\na person works 52 weeks of the year, after paying social\nsecurity, rent, health insurance, and the costs of a car, he or\nshe will be left with a disposable income below US$3,000\nper annum to support his or her family, or under US$3 per\nday per person (Stiglitz, 2012). Given his or her paltry\nincome, buying ethically sourced clothing or fair-trade food\nmight make this person unable to afford a winter coat for his\nor her children, to provide them with adequate calorific\nintake, or to treat them to 1 week's vacation every other year.\nThese items, which he or she would have to relinquish if he\nor she were to consume ethically, might, in light of the obli-\ngations he or she has toward his or her children, be of greater\nmoral import to him or her than the plight of textile workers\nin Vietnam. Purchasing cheap, rather than ethically sourced,\nclothing allows this person to reserve part of his income to\nfulfill obligations which he or she deems to be of higher\nmoral import, and so his or her moral weighing would lead\nhim or her not to consume ethically. As a person's income\nincreases, however, he or she is likely to purchase ever more\nitems, the consumption of which does not fulfill any moral\nobligation; as a greater proportion of one's income is spent\non luxuries, directing one's expenditure to ethically pro-\nduced commodities is likely to impose ever smaller moral\ncosts on the consumer. Hence the higher the income of a per-\nson, the more stringent we should be in applying standards of\nethical consumption. And the poorer one is, the more likely,\nceteris paribus, one will sacrifice something of moral import\nwhen consuming ethically, and this acts as a mitigating factor\nin one's culpability for perpetrating injustices in the produc-\ntion of commodities that one consumes.\nA poor person who consumes ethically tainted commodi-\nties does not necessarily do so in ignorance (culpable or oth-\nerwise). The poor person just depicted is engaged in moral\nweighing, as was our CellCept user. If a person deems ethical\nconsumption to involve a moral sacrifice greater than the\nmoral gain, one would have to inspect his or her moral\nweighing to ascertain whether this be a reasonable judgment.\nIf the cost of consuming ethically leaves a person unable to\nfulfill basic obligations to himself or herself or to those with\nwhom he or she stands in a special ethical relationship, we\nare likely to absolve him or her of culpability for consuming\nunethically. If, for instance, I would be unable to nourish my\nchildren if I were to divert my paltry financial resources to\nethical consumption, I would probably be declared blameless\nfor doing so. Whatever our verdict, though, it should be\nnoted that culpability in such cases is not a function of igno-\nrance, for the consumer need not be ignorant of the relevant\nethical implications. I might, that is, be forced by my meager\nmeans to buy unethically produced commodities in full\nknowledge of the harms I am perpetuating. But if the money\nI save by consuming such products allows me to nourish my\nfamily and stop its members from falling into chronic ill\nhealth, I might be justified in acting thus. I am thereby not\nnecessarily ignorant of any causal impact of my deeds. If I\nam censured for taking this course of action, I will be casti-\ngated not because of my ignorance but because my moral\nweighing is deemed faulty.\nPrecepts for Ethical Consumption\nHaving outlined some variables that affect the degree of con-\nsumers' culpability, we now issue practical precepts for ethi-\ncal consumption:\nPrecept 1: Inform yourself first about those commodities\nthe consumption of which, ceteris paribus, has the highest\nprobability of giving rise to a moral wrong.\nOne's ignorance about commodities is associated with a\nrisk that we will buy commodities the production of which\ninvolves harm or injustice to innocent others. Consumers are\noften aware that they risk perpetuating injustices through\ntheir acts of consumption. But the magnitude of the risk\ninvolved will vary. For instance, purchasing meat or dairy\nproducts from a budget supermarket has a close cognitive\nconnection to the moral wrong of harming animals, and\nhence the probability that the harm ensues is high. It is implau-\nsible that a person is unaware of the connection between the\nsuffering of animals and the ways in which they are farmed,\nespecially for the production of low cost food. Like Moody-\nAdams' CEO, one might not want to confront the details of\nanimal farming, but one would have to be quite active in culti-\nvating this ignorance, not least in the sense of putting thoughts\nabout the lives of animals one eats to the back of one's mind. A\nconsumer of a Roche product, by contrast, is unlikely to be\naware of a connection between purchasing, say, an antibacterial\nmedication and the profitability of a corporation that uses ethi-\ncally dubious methods to develop a different, ethically suspect,\ntreatment, namely CellCept. The closeness of the cognitive\nconnection between purchasing cheap meat and harm to ani-\nmals should lead her to prioritize the task of informing herself\nabout the risk of consuming meat. The distant cognitive con-\nnection between Roche's wrongdoing and the consumption of\none of the corporation's non-transplant-related products\nmakes it a less obvious target for immediate investigation.\nA second precept of ethical consumption concerns the\nseverity of the moral consequences that might ensue from\nacts of consumption. Consider a consumer who is aware of a\nrisk that buying commodities A and B will perpetuate injus-\ntices, denoted I\nA\nand I\nB\n, respectively. The consumer also esti-\nmates (however roughly) the probability that I\nA\nand I\nB\nwill be\nperpetuated by his acts of consumption to be p(I\nA\n) and p(I\nB\n),\nrespectively. If p(I\nA\n)  p(I\nB\n), the consumer is more culpable\nfor his ignorance that leads to the purchase of A if he deems\nI\nA\nto be greater than I\nB\n. This, then, issues in the following\nprecept, which returns us to variable (2) of the previous\nsection:\nPrecept 2: Reduce your ignorance about those commodi-\nties the consumption of which, ceteris paribus, risks\nengendering or sustaining the most severe moral\nconsequences.\nOther things being equal, one's degree of culpability for\nremaining ignorant about commodity C and the pernicious\neffects associated with it is greater the more severe the moral\nconsequences of purchasing C are. Note, though, that\nPrecepts 1 and 2 can pull a consumer's investigations in\nopposite directions. Purchasing commodity A in ignorance\nabout its severe moral implications is worse than purchasing\ncommodity B that is associated with minor moral infractions.\nThis should lead a consumer who abides by Precept 2 to\ninvestigate the ethical biography of commodity A rather than\nB. But if the consumer estimates the risk of perpetuating\ninjustice by consuming A to be very small (and perhaps the\nconsumer, as in the Roche case, is unaware of the risk), she\nis counseled by Precept 1 to investigate commodity B if con-\nsuming B carries a high probability of perpetuating the minor\nethical misdemeanors associated with B's production. The\nconsumer who acts on Precepts 1 and 2 is, then, involved in\na calculation in which the estimation of moral wrong and the\nestimation of its likelihood are to be balanced.\nPrecepts 1 and 2 must be augmented by a third that\naddresses the ease with which information about commodities\ncan be gathered. Consider the following moral excuse that\nmight be offered on behalf of consumers whose ignorance\nleads them to purchase unethically produced commodities:\nThose who advocate ethical consumption underestimate the\ndifficulty of finding out the morally relevant facts needed to\nassess whether a commodity has been ethically produced. Of the\nthousands of products we buy, we would be cognitively\noverstretched if we were to apprise ourselves of the details of\neven a handful of value chains which some of those commodities\nhad traversed before arriving in retail stores. The impossibility\nof informing ourselves sufficiently about every available\nproduct means that our ignorance is not culpable and hence we\nmust be absolved of culpability for our acts of unethical\nconsumption.\nThis moral excuse casts doubt on the feasibility of sub-\njecting all or even many of our consumption decisions to\nethical scrutiny. Even the most ethical consumer will unwit-\ntingly purchase some ethically dubious commodities. The\ninsurmountability of consumers' ignorance regarding com-\nmodities, the moral excuse would have us believe, absolves\nthem of blame for purchasing them. This excuse might apply\nto many ethically concerned consumers who, despite a gen-\neral awareness of corporate malfeasance in many sectors,\noften lack specific information about individual corporations\n(Carrigan &Attalla, 2001), for to delve into the ethical record\nof myriad corporations is no small task.\nOf what, though, does the above moral excuse absolve\nconsumers? It does not absolve them of culpability for their\nignorance tout court, for although it might be impossible that\na consumer inform herself about every commodity, this does\nnot warrant the inference that she is permitted to inform her-\nself about none, or even about a good number of them. To\nargue otherwise would be a false generalization of the moral\nexcuse. The impossibility of informing herself fully about\nevery commodity does not mean that it is impossible (or\neven terribly difficult) for her to inform herself to some\ndegree about some commodities. The question then becomes\n\"About which, among the sea of commodities available,\nshould a consumer inform herself so as to avoid the state of\nbeing culpably ignorant?\" Precepts 1 and 2 give guidance on\nthis, but we should add a further precept that pertains to the\nrelative ease with which reliable information can be found\nwhich can strengthen or weaken the consumer's suspicion\nabout the unethical nature of a commodity. Thus we have the\nfollowing:\nPrecept 3: Obtain information first about those commod-\nities about which, ceteris paribus, reliable information is\nrelatively easily gathered.\nPrecept 3 takes the onus of arduous information-gathering\nexercises from the consumer's shoulders, but it does not tell\nus at which point the consumer may relieve herself of further\ninformation collection while being non-culpable for her\nremaining ignorance. For we have absolved the consumer of\nculpability for being ignorant about all available commodi-\nties. But at which point may she stop collecting further infor-\nmation about some of the commodities she purchases while\nbeing non-culpable for acts of consumption that implicate\nher in wrongdoing? The answer to this question depends on\nmoral weighing. One suggestion for a rule of moral weighing\ntakes its inspiration from Peter Singer who, in a discussion of\nduties of assistance, writes,\nIf it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening,\nwithout thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral\nimportance, we ought, morally, to do it. By \"without sacrificing\nanything of comparable moral importance\" I mean without\ncausing anything else comparably bad to happen. (Singer, 1972,\nI call this the Singer criterion for moral action. One can\napply it to the information-gathering duties of consumers\nwho are ignorant about commodities they might purchase.\nThe Singer criterion applied to this task would issue in a fur-\nther precept:\nPrecept 4: Gather information about commodities you\nmight consider purchasing up to the point at which the\ncost of further information gathering involves a moral\nsacrifice that outweighs the moral harm avoided by col-\nlecting more information.\nGathering information about commodities one might con-\nsume has two effects: It (a) reduces the risk that injustices\nassociated with the production of those commodities will be\nperpetuated, and (b) imposes a cost on the consumer who\ngathers the information. The former effect is clearly moral--\nit puts the consumer into a position from which she can\nreduce injustice. The costs of gathering information (effect\n[b]) might be included in the moral deliberation of the con-\nsumer, but only if these costs are morally relevant. Whether\nthese costs are moral depends on the particularities of the\nconsumer's situation, as the following examples indicate.\nThe costs of information gathering may be deemed mor-\nally relevant if the time the consumer spares himself by not\ngathering information about commodities is instead used in\nthe pursuit of something of greater moral worth. Hence, if a\nconsumer decides not to spend a further unit of time collect-\ning information about the ethical characteristics of commodi-\nties, he relinquishes a moral gain, which consists in a reduction\nof the risk that the consumer will unwittingly purchase ethi-\ncally tainted commodities; relinquishing this moral gain can\nonly be compensated if the consumer uses that unit of time to\npursue an end that is morally at least as valuable as the reduc-\ntion in the risk that he purchases an ethically tainted commod-\nity. So if I decide not to spend a further hour informing myself\nabout the clothing I buy because that hour is better spent in\npursuit of animal liberation, my culpability for remaining\nignorant about the clothes I buy will be diminished (or extin-\nguished) if the hour of activism for animal liberation move-\nments is deemed to be morally more important than divesting\nmyself of ignorance about clothing. Or, to return to the resident\nof the United States mentioned in the previous section, if\nresearching the ethical characteristics of commodities reduces\nthe time available to him for working overtime in his job, the\nmoral cost, for example, being unable adequately to feed his\nfamily because of low income, might be held to be so high that\nit excuses him from the information-gathering exercise through\nwhich he would reduce his ignorance about commodities. If,\nhowever, one's reason for not informing oneself further\nabout the world of commodities is simply laziness or conve-\nnience, or the fact that \"other people do not inform them-\nselves about commodities, so why should I?\" one cannot\ncompensate for the moral loss of not informing oneself fur-\nther (and hence increasing the risk that one purchases an\nethically tainted commodity) because these excuses are not\nmoral excuses. This does not mean that the consumer must\nset herself the impossible task of informing herself about\neach and every commodity she might purchase, but it does\ncommit her to informing herself up to the point at which she\nbelieves she would relinquish something of greater moral\nimportance were she to continue to gather information about\nthe commodities she consumes.\nConclusion\nThis article has explored consumers' ignorance about com-\nmodities they purchase and has asked under which condi-\ntions their ignorance makes them morally culpable. My focus\nhas been on consumers who are factually, rather than mor-\nally, ignorant. That is, I have been concerned with consumers\nwho are ignorant about the modes of production of the com-\nmodities they consume, but not with those consumers whose\nsense of right and wrong is defective. Through a re-working\nof Michele Moody-Adams' concept of affected ignorance, I\nestablished the defining criterion for determining whether\nignorance is culpable to reside in the awareness condition. To\nfulfill this condition, a consumer must be aware of a risk that\nher consumption of a given commodity will engender or help\nto sustain harms or injustices to others. This sets the lower\nbound to a consumer's awareness if she is to fulfill the aware-\nness condition. The awareness condition also sets an upper\nbound to the degree of awareness the consumer has about the\ncommodities she consumes. The upper bound to the aware-\nness condition means that the consumer is not permitted to\nhave a degree of awareness extensive enough to prevent her\nfrom purchasing unethically produced commodities; neither\ncan she be so well informed about the commodity in question\nthat she purchases it in the knowledge that doing so is wrong-\nful, for this would be a case of moral backsliding. The aware-\nness condition thus constrains the consumer from two sides:\nShe must have some awareness of the unethical nature of\ncommodities, but not too much. Her awareness of the ethi-\ncally dubious nature of commodities allows us to describe\nher as making a choice not to overcome her ignorance if she\ndoes not take steps to inform herself further about these com-\nmodities. From within the epistemological space carved out\nby the awareness condition, I have investigated consumers'\nculpability for acts of consumption that inflict harm on oth-\ners or perpetuate injustices.\nTo investigate consumers' culpability, I depicted a repre-\nsentative consumer who fulfills the awareness condition and\nwhose ignorance is therefore culpable. Following that, a\nnumber of mitigating circumstances were enumerated, all of\nwhich lessened or annulled the consumer's culpability. These\ninclude cases in which the harm arising from an act of uneth-\nical consumption falls outside the risk of the consumer's\nignorance. That is, for cases in which the risk is remote and\nin which, therefore, there is no obvious cognitive connec-\ntion between the act of consumption and the harm that\nensues, the consumer's culpability is diminished. We do\nnot expect consumers to be aware of distant or arcane con-\nnections between their consumption and the harms it\ncauses. The remoteness or proximity of the risk that one\nwill engender harm through one's acts of consumption is a\nfactor underlying the first precept of ethical consumption.\nThe second factor that determines the degree of culpability\nconcerns the severity of the moral consequences of con-\nsuming unethically as a result of one's ignorance.\nConsideration of this factor lay at the basis of the second\nprecept of ethical consumption, which counseled consum-\ners to reduce their ignorance about those commodities the\nconsumption of which lead to the most severe moral con-\nsequences. A third reason for absolving a consumer of cul-\npability lies in the moral sacrifice involved in informing\noneself about commodities. If overcoming one's ignorance\nso that one can avoid purchasing ethically tainted com-\nmodities involves a moral sacrifice greater than the harm\none is likely to arise by remaining ignorant, remaining\nignorant is justified. Those of lower income are likely to\nhave to sacrifice something of greater moral relevance\nwhen they seek information about commodities than those\nendowed with more income and wealth. The moral sacri-\nfice of overcoming one's ignorance about commodities is a\nfactor underlying the third and fourth precepts for ethical\nconsumption.\nAlthough there are many circumstances that lessen the\ndegree to which our ignorance may be deemed culpable, my\nargument suggests that we are less innocent than many will\nwish to admit when we make consumption decisions that\ncause harm or injustices to others. Significantly, to narrow the\ngap between our ethical attitudes and our behavior would\nrequire significant changes in behavior the attainment of\nwhich, to many, will seem unrealistic. Yet the difficulty in\nmaking our conduct ethical should not deter us from remind-\ning ourselves of what we ought to do in the sphere of\nconsumption.\nFinally, the conceptual analysis contained in this article\npoints to avenues of empirical research. Such research would\nbe of an ethnographic nature or based on surveys. It would\nattempt to ascertain the prevalence of different types of atti-\ntudes among consumers. This would allow one to determine\nhow many consumers are morally ignorant in the consump-\ntion decisions they make, how many are factually ignorant,\nand, among these, how many manifest a degree of ignorance\nthat satisfies the awareness condition. Those whose igno-\nrance does fall within these confines would be deemed cul-\npable for their ignorance.\n"
