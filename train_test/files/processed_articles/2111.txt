It is also the most\nprevalent mental condition in elderly individuals\n(Chan, Chien, Thompson, Chiu, & Lam, 2006). It is\ncurrently projected that depression will be the\nsecond leading cause of disability worldwide in\ncarries a poor prognosis, being associated with\nincreased mortality, morbidity, and the use of health\nfacilities (Covinsky et al., 1999; Dozeman et al.,\nThe impact of depression in quantitative out-\ncomes (such as mortality) has been extensively\ndemonstrated in the literature (Covinsky et al.,\n1999). In addition, the role that major depression\nplays in the quality of life and aging experiences in\nolder adults has been reported (Chan et al., 2006;\nLow & Molzahn, 2007). Several studies have\ndemonstrated that the clinical diagnosis of major\ndepression is the most influential predictor for\nimpairments in quality of life (Chan et al.; Netuveli,\nWiggins, Hildon, Montgomery, & Blane, 2006;\nSobocki et al., 2007; Stafford, Berk, Reddy, &\nJackson, 2007), even when confounding factors (such\nas age, gender, living arrangements, or physical\nconditions) are controlled.\nE.

The majority of instru-\nments have been used without adequate validation\n(Haywood, Garratt, & Fitzpatrick, 2005), do not\ntake into consideration several aspects of life that\nolder adults consider fundamental (Pearlman &\nUhlmann, 1988), or are not suitable for older adults\nbecause they have been developed primarily for\nyoung adult populations (Brazier, Walters, Nicholl, &\nKohler, 1996; Chachamovich, Trentini, & Fleck,\nThe prevalence of subsyndromal depression in\nelderly individuals is more than double the one for\nmajor depression (D. G. Blazer, 2003; Geiselmann &\nBauer, 2000; Geiselmann, Linden, & Helmchen,\nAmick, & Boustani, 2004). In the United States,\naround 15% of the older adults are expected to\npresent subthreshold depression, which is defined as\ndepressive symptoms that fail to meet the full\ndiagnostic criteria for a major depression episode\n(Judd, Schettler, & Akiskal, 2002). In contrast to\nmajor depression, the prevalence of subsyndromal\ndepression seems to increase with advancing age\nLavretsky & Kumar, 2003; Tannock & Katona,\nseverity of symptoms are lower than those in the full-\nblown syndrome, subsyndromal depression is asso-\nciated with significant functional impairment and\npsychosocial disability (Penninx, Leveille, Ferrucci,\nvan Eijk, & Guralnik, 1999; Wilms, Kanowski, &\nBaltes, 2000), an increased risk of developing major\ndepression at some point, and suicidal ideation\n(Geiselmann & Bauer; Greden, 2001; VanItallie).\nHowever, to our knowledge, there are no reports on\nthe impact that subthreshold depression may have on\nquality of life or attitudes toward aging.\nThe brief version of the World Health Organiza-\ntion Quality of Life (WHOQOL) instrument, known\nas the WHOQOL-BREF instrument, is a generic\nmeasurement of quality of life (the WHOQOL\nGroup, 1998). Its development was based on a trans-\ncultural simultaneous methodology (Bullinger, Power,\nAaronson, Cella, & Anderson, 1996; Guillemin,\n1995), which ensures its applicability in different\ncultural settings. Recent reports have described its\nsatisfactory psychometric properties in older adult\npopulations (Chachamovich et al., 2007; Hwang,\nLiang, Chiu, & Lin, 2003). In addition, the WHOQOL\nAssessment for Older Adults (WHOQOL-OLD) and\nthe Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ) instru-\nments have been recently developed to provide more\nreliable and comprehensive tools in assessing quality\nof life and attitudes toward aging in older adults\n(Laidlaw, Power, & Schmidt, 2007; Power et al.,\n2005). They are in line with the need of broader\nconceptual outcome measures, beyond the classic\nones, such as mortality and morbidity. Because they\nwere developed as specific instruments for elderly\nindividuals, particular attention was paid to guar-\nantee that the specificities of old age would be\nproperly covered by the instruments. Both instru-\nments were developed with the use of a combination\nof classical and modern psychometric approaches,\nwhich ensures that the instruments have satisfactory\npsychometric performance (Laidlaw et al.; Power\net al.). The WHOQOL Group recommends that the\nWHOQOL-OLD module be applied together with\none generic quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-\n100 or WHOQOL-BREF) to enhance its validity\n(Power et al.).\nOur aim in this study is to assess the association\nof depression symptoms on the quality of life and\nattitudes toward aging in a large international sam-\nple of older adults. Furthermore, we explore to what\nextent subclinical depression symptoms also deter-\nmine alterations in the quality of life and attitudes\ntoward aging in this population.\nMethods\nParticipants\nWe obtained data from a larger study on quality\nof life in older adults (WHOQOL-OLD). This\nproject was carried out by the WHOQOL Group\nand involved 20 countries around the world (Power\nResearchers recruited opportunistic samples of\nindividuals in participant centers across Europe,\nAsia, South America, and North America.

Researchers carried\nout the recruitment in university hospitals, nursing\nhomes, and in community groups for older adults.\nProcedures\nThe assessment was run in a cross-sectional\ndesign. As we already mentioned, the participants\nwere required to complete a sociodemographic form,\nWHOQOL-BREF instrument (the WHOQOL\nGroup, 1998), the WHOQOL-OLD module (Power\nThe GDS is a widely used instrument for assessing\ndepression specifically in older adults. Its theoretical\nbackground is based on the ability to distinguish\ndepressed elders from the ones with ``normal aging''\nneurovegetative symptoms. Thus, the GDS focuses\non nonsomatic symptomatology, emphasizing the\naffective and cognitive areas (de Craen, Heeren, &\net al., 1982). It has yet to be cross-nationally validated\n(this issue is currently being addressed elsewhere).\nThus, each center has applied a nationally validated\nversion. The optimal cutoff score of 5/6 presents\nsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity (Almeida &\n2000; Wancata, Alexandrowicz, Marquart, Weiss, &\nFriedrich, 2006), although alternative cutoff points\nhave been suggested for specific conditions (Cullum,\nMalakouti, Fatollahi, Mirabzadeh, Salavati, &\nZandi, 2006). Because the instrument has yet to be\ninternationally validated, its cutoff point is not\nconsensual. For the present study, we adopted the\nThe WHOQOL-BREF instrument is a generic\nquestionnaire to assess quality of life. Developed\nunder a simultaneous transcultural approach\nfor multicentric studies and is also validated for\nolder adults (Chachamovich et al., 2007; Hwang\nposed of four domains (physical, psychological,\nsocial, and environmental) and an overall score.\nThe WHOQOL-OLD module is a specific com-\nplementary set of items recently developed to\nincrease the specificity of the quality of life mea-\nsurement in older adults (Power et al., 2005). It\ncomprises six domains (sensory abilities, autonomy,\npast, present, and future activities, social participa-\ntion, death and dying, and intimacy) and an overall\nscore. Furthermore, it proved to be suitable and\nadequate to measuring quality of life comprehen-\nsively in older adults, because an intense qualitative\nphase ensured that relevant issues were properly\ncovered by this instrument (Chachamovich et al.,\nThe AAQ is an instrument developed by the\nWHOQOL Group to assess the subjective perception\nof aging. It also followed a transcultural methodol-\nogy and shows good psychometric performance\n(Laidlaw et al., 2007). It is composed of three facets\n(psychological growth, physical change, and psycho-\nsocial loss) and was also based in an intense\ntheoretical debate among international experts, as\nwell as in focus groups carried out with older adults\nto confirm or adjust the instrument items. It is also\nable to assess attitudes toward aging from the\nperspective of the elderly population, which is the\none researchers consider to be the most capable of\ninforming them about the experience of aging.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe ran our statistical analyses by using SPSS 14.0\nsoftware. We analyzed the total sample through\ndescriptive statistics for both clinical and subsyn-\ndromal depression. If we found the distribution of\ndemographic variables to be significantly different,\nthen we ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to\npartial out the variance for which other predictors\n(age, educational level, gender, and marital status)\ncould account (Field, 2005). We carried out\nindependent t tests to compare the quality of life\nand attitudes toward aging scores according to the\npredictors.\nWe applied hierarchical regression in each domain\nAAQ instruments to detect the impact of depression.\nWe included age, gender, educational level, and\nmarital status as independent variables, together\nwith depression levels.\nNext, we selected the subsample of individuals\nwith subsyndromal depression levels and divided\nthem into two groups (one with GDS scores from\n0 to 2, and another with scores from 3 to 5). We\nbased this cutoff on the median of the GDS score\ndistribution. Again, we applied demographic distri-\nbution verification and ANCOVA to ensure compa-\nrability. We ran independent t tests for each domain.\nAt this stage, these comparisons had the aim of\ndetecting the impact of small increases in depression\nscores even at a subsyndromic level. We also carried\nout a hierarchical regression to detect the relative\nweight of subsyndromic depression on quality of life\nand attitudes toward aging.\nResults are described through means and proba-\nbility or p values (chi-square and t tests), and\nsquared multiple correlation or R2 changes and\nstandardized beta or b values (for hierarchical\nmultiple linear regression).\nResults\nDescriptives\nResearchers assessed 4,316 respondents. The\nsample was predominantly comprised of highly\neducated married women. Researchers carried out\nrecruitment primarily in homes (76.6%), followed by\nfound no relevant correlation between the site of\nrecruitment and the domain scores for quality of life\nor attitudes toward aging (Pearson coefficients from\ncharacteristics of the total sample divided into\na subsyndromal group and a clinical depression\ngroup. There is a marked predominance of respond-\nents with depression scores lower than the diagnostic\nWe compared the WHOQOL-BREF, WHOQOL-\nOLD, and AAQ domain scores across the clinically\ndepressed and the subsyndromic groups. All scores\nfor quality of life and attitudes toward aging are\nsignificantly lower in the depressed group than in the\nsubsyndromic group (p , .001; data not shown).\nThese findings point out a wide and intense associa-\ntion of major depression in quality of life outcomes.\nThis association, however, could be partially\nrelated to the discrepancy in the distribution of\ndemographics. To control this potential bias, we ran\nan ANCOVA. Table 2 describes the ANCOVA\nresults. As shown in this table, the interaction among\nthese variables assumes statistical significance in only\n4 out of the 16 scores. Furthermore, the interaction\nexplains not more than 3% of the total variance of\nthe score in these four domains. Thus, the difference\nin scores for quality of life and attitudes toward\naging between the two samples appears to be\nstrongly related to depression levels, and not to\ndemographic dissimilarities.\nWe tested potential multicollinearity through the\nvariance inflation factor in each regression model.\nVariance inflation factor values ranged from 0.903 to\n1.09, which indicates that the predictors do not have\nstrong linear relationships among them (Field, 2005;\nWe conducted a hierarchical multiple linear\nregression to detect the increase of the coefficient\nof determination as new independent variables were\nincluded in the model. We evaluated the data\ndistribution by means of the Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov\ntest, which showed a normal distribution of all\ndependent variables (WHOQOL and AAQ domains\nscores). We also checked linearity and variance and\nthese met the linear regression assumptions. We\nselected gender, age, marital status, and educational\nlevel to compose the regression model, together with\ndepression levels, because they represent important\ndemographic variables and are widely reported in\nseveral studies (Chan et al., 2006; Low & Molzahn,\n2007). We also examined the standardized beta co-\nefficients to compare the impact of the independent\nvariables in the quality of life and attitudes toward\naging domains. Tables 3 and 4 illustrate the R2\nincrease and the beta coefficients for each domain, as\nwell as for the overall scores in the three scales.\nThe inclusion of depression in the model deter-\nmined a marked increase in the coefficient of deter-\nmination. In fact, almost all of the variance is\nTable 1. Total Sample Characteristics\nCharacteristic\nn (%) or M (SD)\nn (%) or M (SD) p\nNotes: GDS = Geriatric Depression Scale.

The magnitude of the effect\ncaused by depression in the model is greatly higher\nthan the ones by the other variables, as we can see by\nboth the R2 change and the beta coefficients.\nInterestingly, the domains of death and dying and\npsychological growth seem to be less related to\ndepression. In fact, the proposed model explains only\n8.4% and 7.3% of the total variance, respectively. As\nwe expected, depression is negatively associated with\nall scores in different intensities.\nBesides testing the association of major depression\non quality of life and attitudes toward aging, we also\nexplored the subsyndromal symptomatology. Our\nmain objective in these further analyses was to\ninvestigate whether an increase of depression levels\ncan be related to impairments in quality of life and\nattitudes toward aging, even when they are not\nconsidered clinically relevant.\nWe selected a subsample of 3,187 respondents\nfrom the total sample. We included all respondents\nwith GDS scores of 5 or lower in this analysis stage.\nTo test the effect of subsyndromal depression in the\nWHOQOL and AAQ scores, we divided the sample\ninto two groups. The first group was composed of\n1,782 respondents with GDS scores equal to or lower\nthan 2. The second group included respondents with\nGDS scores from 3 to 5. Demographics are described\nin Table 5.\nWe tested demographic variables through the use\nof chi-square and independent t test statistics.\nFollowing the same strategy applied for the total\nsample and as already described, we used an\nANCOVA test to assess a potential effect of this\ndifferent distribution. Results indicated that the\ninteraction among gender, educational level, and\nmarital status is not significant for any domain.\nPartial eta-squared values were 0% for all 16 scores\n(data not shown).\nTable 6 shows the comparison of mean scores for\nall domains. It is possible to observe that the quality\nof life and attitudes toward aging scores are\nsignificantly decreased as depression levels are\nincreased.\nIn fact, the analysis of the scores of all domains\nindicates a progressive impairment with increasing\ndepression levels, even when nonclinical depression\nis included. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing quality\nof life and AAQ overall scores in four different levels\nof depressive symptoms. An analysis of variance\nshowed that the differences are statistically signifi-\ncant at all points (p , .0001). In addition, it seems\nthat the AAQ scores are less intensely associated\nTable 5.

Again, we assessed the\nincrease in the coefficient of determination, as well as\nthe standardized beta coefficients. As we expected,\nthe variances of the domain scores were lower than\nthe one observed in the total sample. As a result,\ntotal R2 and changes in the coefficient were smaller.\nThe results indicate the same pattern observed in\nthe findings from the total sample. Again, the\nmagnitude of the effect caused by the inclusion of\ndepression in the model is much higher than the ones\ncaused by the other variables. This suggests that\na slight increase in depression level (in a subsyndro-\nmal scenario) is a major predictor of impairments in\nquality of life and attitudes toward aging.\nThe psychological growth and the death and\ndying domains again showed a low coefficient of\ndetermination. However, most of this low value was\ndue to depression rather than any other independent\nvariable in the model. Tables 7 and 8 describe the\nhierarchical regression findings.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we aimed at exploring the association\nof clinical and subclinical depression in the quality of\nlife and attitudes toward aging in a large interna-\ntional sample of older adults. The results suggest\nthat even relatively minor levels of depression are\nassociated with a significant decrease in quality of\nlife and with a pattern of negative attitudes toward\naging. These findings assume particular relevance\nbecause the instruments that were used are indeed\nadequate for investigations in older adults. This\nensures the reliability of the results. Furthermore, the\nlarge international sample could be seen as an\nimportant factor of external validity.\nStudies regarding attitudes toward aging have\ndemonstrated the effect of culture in the perception\nof aging. Interestingly, stereotypes of aging proved\nnot to be adequate to describe the aging process\n(Yun & Lachman, 2006). Quality of life is also\nintimately linked to cultural aspects, because culture\nand value systems of the society are part of the\nquality of life definition (Schmidt & Bullinger, 2003;\nthe WHOQOL Group, 1998). The AAQ and the\nWHOQOL instruments were constructed under\na simultaneous methodology, which included input\nfrom several cultural contexts in the development\nphase. Thus, they seem to represent what Draper\ncalls a ``culture-proof variable,'' because they are\nable to assess meaningfully abstract concepts\nResearchers have yet to explore the link between\nquality of life and attitudes toward aging. Some\nsimilarities should be highlighted. First, both\nconcepts are predominately based on subjective\nTable 7.

Second,\nboth are multidimensional and include physical and\npsychological aspects. Nevertheless, it is possible to\nstate that the AAQ assesses a more stable perception,\nwhereas the WHOQOL instrument would be related\nto a more circumstantial aspect. The combination of\nthe WHOQOL-OLD and the AAQ is suggested as an\neffective methodology for assessing psychological or\npsychiatric interventions (Laidlaw et al., 2007).\nThe sequential comparisons of the mean scores of\nquality of life and attitudes toward aging domains\nindicate progressive impairment on both outcomes\nwith increasing depression levels. This finding is\nclinically relevant and is in line with the findings\nfrom a series of recent studies (Chan et al., 2006;\net al., 2007). However, to our knowledge, the con-\nsistent result of impairment in all quality of life and\nAAQ domains with a slight increase in depression\nlevels (in a subsyndromal stage) has not yet been\nreported. When analyzed as a whole, the present\nresults show that there is a decrease in quality of\nlife and AAQ as depression levels increase. This\nphenomenon happens not only for the clinically\ndepressed respondents (i.e., respondents with 6 to 9\nsymptoms and respondents with 10 or more symp-\ntoms on the GDS) but also for subsyndromic\nrespondents.\nThus, findings suggest that classifying a person as\nnondepressed is not sufficient and is still not\ninformative about his or her quality of life and\nattitudes toward aging status. Historically, depres-\nsion has been underdiagnosed and undertreated in\nlater life (Alexopoulos, 2005), and this is evidently\nmore likely to occur if a person does not meet\ndiagnostic criteria (Jeste, Blazer, & First, 2005).\nThese results would raise the hypothesis that\nsubsyndromal depression could be treated because\nof the impact of minor scores on the GDS on\nappraisals of aging and quality of life. The potential\nincrease in the quality of life and attitudes toward\naging of patients treated for subsyndromic depres-\nsion symptomatology appears as a question to be\nfurther addressed in longitudinal studies.\nThe hierarchical multiple regressions produced\nsome interesting results. First, depression accounted\nfor the vast majority of coefficients of determination\nin all domains. The standardized beta coefficients\nalso showed a high difference of magnitude between\ndepression and age, gender, marital status, and\neducational level. Furthermore, depression was the\nonly predictor with significant values for all out-\ncomes in both total and subsyndromal samples. In\nfact, depression has been described as the pre-\ndominant factor contributing to morale (Woo,\nHo, & Wong, 2005), as well as the strongest\npredictor for subjective perception of quality of life\npresent findings corroborate these previously re-\nported results.\nTable 8.

PPF = past, present, and future activities; SP = social\nparticipation; DD = death and dying; PG = psychological growth, PL = psychosocial loss, PC = physical change. Values set in boldface type designate p , .05.\nSecond, there is a marked difference in the extent\nto which the regression model explained the scores\nvariances. It is suggested that moderate coefficients\nof determination are expected for models including\nquality of life because it is a wide and comprehensive\nconstruct, which would require complex models to\nprovide adequate explanation (Bowling, Banister,\nSutton, Evans, & Windsor, 2002). For example,\nrecent studies using linear regression methodology\non quality of life reported model R2 values of .568\n2006). Because the model applied in the present\nstudy is simpler than the ones just cited, we would\nexpect the R2 values to be lower. In fact, the values\nthe exception of death and dying and psychological\ngrowth) in the total sample. These values are\nconsidered sizeable given the complex nature of the\ndependent variables (Bowling et al.).\nIn contrast, the coefficient of determination was\nmarkedly smaller for the death and dying and\npsychological growth domains, which suggests that\nthere may be other important and specific factors\nthat account for the variation in these areas. Our\ndata were not able to address this question, though.\nIt is important to note that the death and dying\ndomain seems to present some potential psychometric\nweaknesses, as demonstrated by other reports\nWe hypothesize that this domain would perform\nbetter when it is applied to unhealthy subjects but\nwould lose power when healthy subjects are included\nin the sample. Studies on quality of life in HIV\npatients have supported this hypothesis (O'Connell,\nSkevington, & Saxena, 2003; O'Connell, Saxena, &\nRegarding the psychological growth domain, the\nonly article published up to the present that we know\nof describes its satisfactory psychometric perfor-\nmance in an international data set (Laidlaw et al.,\n2007), which indicates that there must be another\ncluster of variables for determining psychological\ngrowth, and that these variables are more specific for\nthis domain. A close look at the eight items included\nin this domain suggests that generativity is one major\ntopic (i.e., passing on the benefits of growing older,\ngiving good examples to younger people; see Laidlaw\net al.). It is possible to hypothesize that older adults\nwithout the opportunity to be in contact with\nyounger generations (e.g., without children or grand-\nchildren) may not be adequately represented by this\ndomain. It is extremely relevant to design inves-\ntigations on this topic in order to implement specific\ninterventions to improve psychological aspects of\ngrowing older.\nAs we predicted, the same model produced lower\ncoefficients of determination in the subsyndromal\nsample. However, the results shown for the total sam-\nple (i.e., elevated and significant standardized beta\ncoefficients for depression in all domains and the\npattern of R2 values) remained similar for the sub-\nsyndromic sample. This finding reinforces the role of\neven minimal depression levels in the WHOQOL and\nAAQ domain scores. The question that arises from\nthese findings wouldbe whetheroffering treatment for\nsubsyndromal patients (either psychopharmacologi-\ncal or psychotherapy) could improve their quality of\nlife and attitudes toward aging. Studies designed\nspecifically to address this issue are needed.\nThere are some limitations in the present study.\nThe cross-sectional design does not allow inference\nof causality. Thus, it is possible to detect an\nassociation between depression and WHOQOL\nand AAQ scores, but not to state that the latter is\ncaused by the former. Longitudinal studies are\nrequired to address this issue. In addition, clinical\nor structured psychiatric interviews were not used to\nprovide a clinical diagnosis of depression. However,\nthe GDS was chosen because it has been extensively\nstudied for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, we\ndecided to use level of depression rather than the\nclinical diagnosis of depression in the analysis to\navoid this potential bias. It is also important to\nobserve that the tested model did not include other\ndemographic, clinical, and social variables, which\ncould be potentially related to depression and quality\nof life (such as impaired functioning, life stressors,\nsocial support, and physical health). These non-\nevaluated variables may play a role in the relation-\nship between depression levels and quality of life.\nIn summary, the present study showed that an\nincrease in levels of depression, both in clinical and\nsubsyndromic stages, is a major predictor of impair-\nments in quality of life and attitudes toward aging\nfor older adults.\nReferences\nAlmeida, O.
