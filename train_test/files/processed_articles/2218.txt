Hudson3,4\n Introduction\nOver the past 50 years, survival rates for childhood\ncancer have dramatically improved with 1 in 640 U.S.\nyoung adults now estimated to be survivors (1, 2). Sur-\nvivorship is commonly affected by complications result-\ning from cancer treatment. Specifically, 42% of pediatric\ncancer survivors experience serious, disabling, or life-\nthreatening illnesses by 30 years after diagnosis (3). These\ninclude cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure,\npulmonary fibrosis, and second malignancies, conditions\nthat may be the result of, or exacerbated by, tobacco use.\nAntineoplastic therapies used in cancer treatments result\nin cardiopulmonary toxicities and organ compromise,\nwhich may be further potentiated by tobacco use. Patients\nwho continue tobacco use after diagnosis are at increased\nrisk for both acute (e.g., treatment complications) and\nlong-term health risks (e.g., disease recurrence, secondary\nprimary cancer, and reduced survival) relative to those\nwho quit (4, 5). As such, survivors of childhood cancer\nshould avoid tobacco to decrease their risk for long-term\nhealth problems.\nAlthough smoking has been examined among pediatric\ncancer survivors, smokeless tobacco and dual tobacco use\n(e.g., usage of both combustible and smokeless tobacco)\nhas not (4, 6). The 2 most commonly used smokeless\ntobacco products in the United States are snuff and chew-\ning tobacco, and both are absorbed through tissue in the\nmouth (7). Smokeless tobacco includes up to 28 carcino-\ngens and is associated with malignancies of the mouth,\ntongue, throat, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas and\nincreased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial\ninfarctions, and stroke (7, 8). As survivors are already\nsusceptible to these late effects, tobacco use would be\nAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1Psychology, 2Biostatistics, 3Epi-\ndemiology and Cancer Control, and 4Oncology, St. Jude Children's\nResearch Hospital; 5Department of Preventive Medicine, University of\nTennessee Health Sciences Center, Memphis, Tennessee; 6Harvard\nSchool of Public Health and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Mas-\nsachusetts; and 7Department of Radiation Physics, The University of Texas\nMD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas\nCorresponding Author: James L.

Participants were diagnosed before 21\nyears of age and treated at one of the 26 collaborating\n1986. A detailed description of the CCSS study is reported\nelsewhere (10, 11). The study was approved by the Insti-\ntutional review board at each institution, and informed\nconsent was obtained from participants.\nsurvey, 374 (3.7%) were lost to follow-up. Among parti-\ned the study questionnaire. Participants and those lost to\nfollow-up were similar in regard to diagnosis and geo-\ngraphic region; however, study participants were more\nlikely to be White and of older age at diagnosis (P < 0.05).\nWomen were excluded because of low engagement in\nsmokeless tobacco (n \u00bc 6) and dual tobacco (n \u00bc 1) use.\nThe remaining sample of 4,000 males was further restrict-\ned to those living in the United States (n \u00bc 3,717) and those\nwith complete tobacco data (n \u00bc 3,378). Canadian parti-\ncipants were excluded because the reference population\nused to calculate standardized incidence was U.S. based.\nStudy outcomes were based on participants' self-report of\nsmokeless and combustible tobacco use. Participants who\ndid/did not complete the tobacco items were similar in\nregard to cancer type, race, age at diagnosis, income,\ngeographic region, educational status, and marital status\nPrimary outcomes\nSmokeless tobacco use. Participants who endorsed\nresponse options of \"occasionally use\" or \"regularly use\"\nfor chewing and/or snuff tobacco over the last year were\nclassified as smokeless tobacco users.\nDual tobacco use. Participants were classified as\n\"dual users\" if engaged in smokeless tobacco use as\ndefined above, and responded \"yes\" to current cigarette\nuse or \"occasionally use\" or \"regularly use\" of cigars or\npipes.\nIndependent variables\nDemographic/personal variables considered included\nage at and years since diagnosis, race, educational attain-\nment, household income, marital status, geographic\nregion of residence, and current age. Health condition\nvariables included cancer diagnosis, history of relapse/\nsecond malignant neoplasms (SMN), and respiratory and\nheart/circulatory health status. Respiratory health status\nwas based on 8 items querying history of breathing/lung\nproblems (asthma, emphysema, lung fibrosis, etc.,).\nHeart/circulatory health was based on 13 items querying\nhistory of cardiovascular problems (myocardial infarc-\ntion, arrhythmia, hypertension, etc.). For each system-\nspecific condition, participants reported condition history\nbased on the following response options: (i) \"yes, condi-\ntion still present,\" (ii) \"yes, condition not present,\" (iii) \"no\nhistory of condition,\" and (iv) \"not sure.\" Participants were\ngrouped into disease acuity categories based on endorse-\nment of the condition at the highest level. Psychologic\ndistress was based upon the Brief Symptom Inventory-\n1812 (depression, somatization, anxiety, and Global Sever-\nity Index; GSI) applying a clinical cut-off score  63 (90th\npercentile; ref. 12) and antidepressant use. Participants'\nlevel of physical activity was based upon reported par-\nticipation over the previous month.\nCancer treatments known to be associated with cardio-\nvascular and/or pulmonary complications including che-\nmotherapy (bleomycin, BCNU/CCNU, anthracyclines)\nand radiation therapy (cranial irradiation associated with\nincreased risk of metabolic syndrome, chest irradiation\ninvolving the heart and/or lungs, and/or neck irradiation\ninvolving the carotid arteries) were also examined.\nDichotomous (yes/no) variables were created to charac-\nterize exposure to any of the 3 chemotherapies (at-risk\nchemotherapy) or 3 exposure areas of radiation therapy\n(at-risk radiation therapy), as well as an overall dichoto-\nmous variable for exposure to any of the 6 treatment\nvariables (at-risk cancer treatment).\nStatistical analysis\nCurrentrates of smokeless tobacco anddual tobacco use\nfor the CCSS cohort were compared with data from the\nexpected values standardized by age, sex, and White/\nnon-White race, prevalence ratios (PR; PR \u00bc observed/\nexpected) were computed along with corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI). Probability values were estimat-\ned using Byar approximation. The associations between\nrisk factors and tobacco outcomes were evaluated in\ngeneralized linear models using PROC LOGISTIC in SAS\nversion 9.2. Univariate models were first conducted to test\nassociations between single-risk factors and tobacco out-\ncomes. Independent variables with initial P values < 0.15\nwere included in multivariable models. Final multivariate\nmodels were determined using a backward selection\nprocess based on minimum Akaike's information criteri-\non (AIC). If there were variables that were not significant\nat the 5% level of significance, but were included in the\nmodel chosen by AIC, then the model was rerun without\nthose variables. If the AIC for the new model didn't\nincrease significantly, then the reduced model was\nKlosky et al.\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(6) June 2013 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nretained; otherwise, the model chosen by AIC was taken\nas the final model.\nResults\nAt the time of data collection, the mean population age\nwere married, 65.5% had Bachelor degrees or more, and\nmore. Distribution of diagnoses is as follows: leukemia\nWilm's tumor (7.9%), neuroblastoma (5.6%), soft-tissue\nwere diagnosed between ages 0 to 9 and 25.3% experi-\nenced relapse. Participants received the following cardio-\nvascular- and/or pulmonary-toxic therapies: bleomycin\nall, 40.4% of the sample received at-risk chemotherapy,\nreceived at-risk cancer treatment. More than 32% of par-\nticipants reported a current heart/circulatory condition\n(6.4% reported past history), and 11.9% reported a current\nrespiratory condition (8.5% reported past history).\nApproximately 5% experienced clinically significant glob-\nal psychologic distress, or disordered somatization (5.5%),\ntaking antidepressants, and 77.7% reported engaging in\nphysical activity.\nuse of smokeless tobacco and 79 (2.3%) reported dual\ntobacco use. Comparisons of age- and race-standardized\nprevalence rates of tobacco use between survivors and the\ngeneral population revealed that smokeless tobacco use\namong survivors (Table 1). Dual tobacco use (PR, 0.37;\nvors. Significant PRs 1.0 or more were found only for\nsmokeless tobacco use in non-White survivors aged 35 to\nUnivariate analyses identified associations between\nsmokeless tobacco use and age at diagnosis, race, educa-\ntion, household income, marital status, U.S. region of\nresidence, cancer diagnosis, psychologic distress (anxiety,\nsomatization, and GSI), antidepressant use, and exposure\nto various cancer treatments. In multivariable models, at-\nrisk cancer treatment and GSI were used to represent\ntreatment and psychologic distress to reduce potential\ncollinearity between constructs. In the final multivariable\nlogistic model, factors that remained independently asso-\nciated with smokeless tobacco use included early age at\ncancer diagnosis, not being a college graduate, being\nmarried or divorced/separated, and not residing in the\nNortheast (Table 2). Decreased risk of smokeless tobacco\nuse was associated with having received at-risk cancer\ntreatment.\nUnivariate analyses assessing dual tobacco use identi-\nfied associations between age at diagnosis, current age,\neducation, household income, marital status, U.S. region\nof residence, heart/circulatory problem, physical activity,\npsychologic distress (anxiety, somatization, and GSI),\nantidepressant use, bleomycin exposure, anthracycline\nexposure, at-risk chemotherapy, and at-risk cancer treat-\nment. The final multivariable logistic model identified\ndual tobacco use to be independently associated with\nyounger age at cancer diagnosis, not being a college\ngraduate, being separated/divorced, and being psycho-\nlogically distressed (Table 3). Existing heart and/or\ncirculatory problems were associated with a decreased\nlikelihood of dual tobacco use.\nDiscussion\nMales surviving childhood cancer engage in smokeless\ntobacco and dual tobacco use, but their rates are lower\nthan the U.S. population. Sex, education, U.S. region of\nTable 1. Comparison of smokeless tobacco use among males in the U.S. population and CCSS cohort\nPrevalence\nAge, y Race U.S. population Cancer survivors PR 95% CI P\nTobacco Use in Survivors of Childhood Cancer\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nresidence, psychologic functioning, age at diagnosis, and\nmarital status were identified as risk factors for tobacco\nuse, whereas active heart/circulatory conditions and at-\nrisk cancer treatment were protective. Despite their vul-\nnerable health status, these results suggest that surviving\nchildhood cancer does not make one immune to tobacco\nuse. As such, careful screening and the provision of risk-\nbased care should be prioritized among all adults as\nrecommended by the Public Health Service clinical guide-\nlines (14). This is particularly important for survivors of\nchildhood cancer, as suboptimal application of the guide-\nlines has been reported in this group (15). As 90% of\nsurvivors experience medical encounters at least biannu-\nally (16), screening may be conducted more often by\nhealth professionals, thus maximizing the opportunity\nfor tobacco surveillance and intervention.\nAlthough White survivors reported lower rates of\nsmokelesstobaccowhencomparedwiththegeneralpopu-\nlation, non-White survivors had comparable or increased\nrates. Specifically, 6.1% of middle-aged non-White sur-\nvivors (and 2.6% of their population peers) reported\nsmokeless tobacco use. These findings are concerning as\nsurvivors are at increased health risk secondary to treat-\nment, and are less likely to quit tobacco use in general (17).\nFurthermore, ethnic minorities are at disproportionally\nhigh risk of cerebral vascular disease and mortality sec-\nondary to diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease (14). Therefore, ethnic minority status compounds\nthe risk of smokeless tobacco use for this group of non-\nWhite survivors (14, 18). However, this finding should\nbe interpreted within the confines of limited cell sizes\namong subgroups, which limit the generalizability of this\nfinding.\nSeveral risk factors were identified for both smokeless\ntobacco and dual tobacco use including younger age at\ndiagnosis, lower education, and being divorced/separat-\ned. Unique predictors of smokeless tobacco included\nbeing married and not living in the Northeast, whereas\na history of at-risk cancer treatment was protective against\nsmokeless tobacco. Dual tobacco was independently asso-\nciated with high psychologic distress, a factor, which\nassociates with both smoking and difficulty quitting\n(19, 20). Finally, having an active heart/circulatory con-\ndition was protective against dual tobacco, which is nota-\nble considering the cardiovascular risk associated with\nboth smokeless tobacco and combustible tobacco use\n(21). Similar risk (lower education, psychologic distress)\nand protective factors (at-risk treatment) have been pre-\nviously shown for smoking in childhood cancer survivors\nThese results may be limited by potential under-report-\ning of tobacco use given this population's susceptibility\nTable 3.

Future designs should consider\nstrategies that will increase the validity of tobacco use\noutcomes such as biochemical verification or bogus pipe-\nline (25). Also, this study did not consider contemporary\nforms of tobacco use (hookah, narghile, bidis, kreteks, e-\ncigarettes).\nOver the past 50 years, survival rates for childhood\ncancer have increased exponentially (1, 2). As such, a\nlonger continuum of care has been necessitated, which\nfocuses on the reduction of risk for second cancers and\nadverse late effects. Interventions to eliminate or reduce\ncancer-linked behaviors (including smokeless tobacco\nand dual tobacco use) are now fundamental components\nof survivorship care. The promotion of healthy behaviors\nwill not only reduce morbidity/mortality in this popula-\ntion, but also translate to better quality of life outcomes.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nAuthors' Contributions\nConception and design: J.L.
