Most studies focus on the\neffects of individual background characteristics such as race, age, sex, income\nresearch went further to incorporate individuals' personal or vicarious experi-\nences, such as victimization and contact with police, into the analysis (e.g.,\nthe impact of neighborhood contexts on residents' perceptions of police has\nThe primary purpose of this study is to examine the relative importance of\nrace and class in measuring citizen satisfaction with police. From Bayley and\nMendelsohn's (1969) early study of police\u00adminority relations to Weitzer and\nTuch's (2005b) recent analyses of racially biased policing, race has been one of\nthe most important and consistent predictors of citizens' perceptions of police.\nA growing number of studies, however, question the primacy of race and stress\nthe importance of neighborhood contextual characteristics in shaping citizens'\nevaluations of police. Some researchers find that the effect of race or ethnicity\nis not significant when neighborhood contextual variables are simultaneously\nsuggest that neighborhood class status plays an equally important, if not\ngreater, role in determining satisfaction with police (Dunham & Alpert, 1988;\neffect even after introducing contextual variables (e.g., Garcia & Cao, 2005;\nto clarify the influences of race and class on citizens' attitudes toward police.\nSeveral other reasons, chiefly methodological considerations, justify this\nresearch. First, this study employs a multilevel modeling strategy to assess the\nexplanatory power of both the individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of\nperceptions of police. With the exception of two studies (i.e., Reisig & Parks,\ninfluences of individual-level variables exclusively or used neighborhood contex-\ntual variables in individual-level analyses. This microlevel approach could be\nproblematic for two reasons. One is that these studies could have violated the\nassumption of independence for regression analysis because respondents who\nare naturally nested in a same neighborhood are often correlated with each\nother in certain ways. The other is that these studies could not assess cross-\nlevel effects since the estimates are not adjusted for the covariates, regardless\nof whether they are measured at the individual or the contextual level. They\nalso fail to measure the independent effects of neighborhood characteristics\nadjusting all individual predictors. To address these concerns, the current study\nincludes both individual- and neighborhood-level variables and examines their\ninfluences on citizen satisfaction with police simultaneously.\nA second and related issue is that this research constructs the measures of\nrace and class at both the individual and neighborhood levels. While individual\nrace and class are commonly considered in past research on satisfaction with\npolice, the inclusion of both at the neighborhood-level analysis is rare. A\npivotal measure employed by recent macrolevel studies is concentrated disad-\nvantage, which is constructed by combining neighborhood racial composition\n(i.e., percent Black) and class status (i.e., percent poverty, unemployed, and\nfemale-headed family) into a single scale (Reisig & Parks, 2000; Sampson &\nJeglum-Bartusch, 1998). Although this scale correctly signals the socially and\neconomically disadvantaged status of neighborhoods, it may not allow\nresearchers to examine the relative explanatory power of neighborhood racial\nmakeup and neighborhood class level and possible inter-racial distinctions\nalong class lines.\nFinally, multiple scales are employed to measure neighborhood contextual\ncharacteristics. The two studies that performed a multilevel analysis on\nattitudes toward police considered four neighborhood contextual variables,\nincluding concentrated disadvantage, immigrant concentration and residential\nmobility in Sampson and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) and concentrated disadvantage\nand homicide rate in Reisig and Parks (2000). This study uses concentrated\ndisadvantage and residential mobility and two more measures, racial composi-\ntion and violent crime rate. This group of variables arguably represents a more\ncomprehensive collection of theoretically relevant neighborhood-level predic-\ntors of satisfaction with police.1\nIn brief, the aim of this research is threefold: (1) to assess the effects of\nindividual race and class on determining resident satisfaction with police,\ncontrolling for other background characteristics and personal experience; (2) to\nexamine the effects and relative importance of neighborhood racial and class\nvariables on citizens' satisfaction with police, controlling for other contextual\nvariables, individual characteristics and personal experience; and (3) to analyze\ninter-racial differences in attitudes toward police across distinctive neighbor-\nhood socioeconomic status.\n1. Several other neighborhood contextual characteristics, including neighborhood social and\nphysical disorder, collective efficacy, and perceived crime conditions, were also constructed and\nexamined in the preliminary analysis. All these scales, however, are highly (r > .7) correlated with\nthe measure of concentrated disadvantage and are thus dropped from the study.\nPredicting Satisfaction with the Police\nStarting from the late 1960s, there has been a rich tradition in criminological\nresearch studying public perceptions of the police. Overall, evidence from\nprevious research indicates a widespread positive and supportive attitude\ntoward police (Huang & Vaughn, 1996). Empirical findings suggest, however,\nthat the level of satisfaction can vary across a variety of individual characteris-\ntics, individual experiences and neighborhood characteristics. We thus propose\nthat a comprehensive theoretical framework of public satisfaction with the\npolice should incorporate three different perspectives--individual background\ncharacteristics, personal and vicarious experiences, and neighborhood contexts.\nIndividual background characteristics\nTheoretical explanations that focus on the influence of individual characteris-\ntics and personal/vicarious experiences are the two most popular perspectives\nin explaining citizen satisfaction with the police. The individual-characteristic\nexplanation posits that citizens' individual background characteristics, such as\nrace, class, age and gender, influence their attitudes toward the police.\nRace\nRace has been the focal concern of a considerable number of past studies on\nattitudes toward police. Racial minorities, African Americans in the case of\nmuch of the research, are found to be less likely than Whites to display\nfavorable attitudes toward police (see Brown & Benedict, 2002 and Decker,\n1981 for a summary of past findings). Two theoretical models derived from\nconflict theory, the sense-of-injustice model and the group-position model, can\nbe used to explain this finding.\nThe sense-of-injustice model posits that public attitudes toward criminal\njustice agencies are heavily influenced by the feeling of being treated unjustly\nby the gatekeepers of the criminal justice system--police officers. Applying this\nargument to race, minorities, especially African Americans, tend to display less\nfavorable attitudes toward police because they are more likely than White\nAmericans to have a sense of unequal treatment by the criminal justice system,\nin general, and the police, in particular. Two sources may contribute to a\nhigher level of sense-of-injustice among Blacks. First, African Americans are\nconsistently overrepresented in the criminal justice system, making up less\nof the total arrests for violent crime and nearly 40 percent of all inmates in\nstate and federal correctional facilities (Maguire & Pastore, 2007). This over-\nrepresentation has generated serious concerns about the fairness of law\nenforcement in America. Accordingly, many African Americans tend to view\npolice as \"occupying armies\" in Black neighborhoods whose job is mainly to\nprotect the status quo and to serve the interests of people in power\n(Cashmore, 1991). Recent, highly publicized problems in law enforcement,\nsuch as racial profiling or driving while Black, produce more concerns about\npossible racism.\nSecond, African Americans are also more likely to be victims of both violent\nand older) for violent crimes was 27 for Blacks and 20 for Whites and personal\ntheft is 1.7 for Blacks and .9 for Whites (Maguire & Pastore, 2007). Many African\nAmericans believe that they are victims of both overpolicing and underpolicing\n(Barlow & Barlow, 2000). That is, while residents in largely African American\nneighborhoods perceive that they are often subject to overly aggressive police\ntactics and practices, they also perceive that they are denied equal protection\nby police who are not willing to deal with disorder and crime problems in minority\nThe core arguments of the sense-of-injustice model are in line with the find-\nings from studies on procedural justice which suggest that citizens' perceptions\nof local legal authorities, including the police, are heavily influenced by\nwhether they perceive criminal justice agencies as fair and equitable in both\nthe procedures for making decisions and the outcomes of the decisions (Tyler,\nlead to low citizen cooperation and satisfaction with police, poor police-\nA second model that has been used to explain the Black\u00adWhite differences in\nattitudes toward police is the group-position perspective. Originating from\nBlumer's (1958) group-position theory of racial prejudice and extended by\nmodel asserts that group orientations toward social institutions spring mainly\nfrom a sense of group position that involves \"group identity, out-group stereo-\ntyping, preferred group status, and perceived threat\" (Bobo & Hutchings, 1996,\np. 955). Specifically, members of the dominant group (i.e., the in-group) tend\nto share a sense of superiority, view members of the subordinate group (i.e.,\nthe out-group) as intrinsically different and alien, display a belief about proper\nclaim over certain rights, statuses, privileges and resources, and perceive out-\ngroup members as significant competitors for a greater portion of dominant\nExtending these arguments to racial attitudes toward police, Whites are more\nlikely to hold favorable opinions of the police because they perceive this social\ninstitution as critical and scarce resources to which they are entitled and, more\nimportantly, with which their interests and superiority are ensured. The stereo-\ntyping images of African Americans (e.g., more violent and prone to crime)\ncommonly held by many Whites also lead to strong support among Whites for\naggressive law enforcement against Black Americans and neighborhoods\n(Weitzer & Tuch, 2004b). Racial prejudice associated with a sense of group\nposition thus is one of the key factors differentiating Blacks' and Whites' views\nof the police.\nThe majority of previous studies on race and attitudes towards the police\nhave found a significant link between them supporting the predictions of both\nthe sense-of-injustice and the group-position models. Early studies conducted at\nthe request of President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration\nof Justice in the 1960s found that although there was widespread satisfaction\nwith the police, minorities were notably less favorable than Whites in their\njudgments of different aspects of police practice (President's Commission on\nLaw Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967). More recent studies\nhave reached similar conclusions (e.g., Brandl et al., 1994; Carter, 1985; Huang\nResearchers suggest that this difference exists because of the differential treat-\nment of Whites and Blacks by police, in reality or by respondents' perceptions.\nFor example, Weitzer (2000) examined citizens' perceptions of racialized\npolicing and found that there was a shared belief across White and Black\ncommunities that police treated Whites and Blacks differently.\nA small number of studies, however, have found that race has a weak or nil\neffect on citizens' evaluations of police. Jesilow, Meyer and Namazzi (1995), for\ninstance, found that ethnicity is not a good predictor of attitudes toward police.\nFrank and colleagues (1996) actually found that African Americans in Detroit\nheld more favorable views of the police than did White residents. They\nexplained this \"Detroit exception\" by suggesting that a number of American\ncities were going through an ethno-racial political transition, which has dramat-\nically enhanced African Americans' political influence, including the election of\nBlack mayors and the appointment of Black police chiefs. A recent replication of\nthis study in Washington, DC, however, reached a contradictory conclusion,\nwith African American respondents reporting lower levels of satisfaction with\nClass\nClass or socioeconomic status (SES), measured in a variety of ways, is another\nfactor commonly used in research on citizen satisfaction with police. As with\nrace, both the sense-of-injustice and the group-position perspectives are appro-\npriate for the explanation of class differences in attitudes toward police. The\nsense-of-injustice model suggests that working-class people will hold less favor-\nable attitudes toward police than wealthy people because they are more likely\nresponses to incidents vary, depending upon the location of the citizens in social\nspace as measured by the race, sex, age, and social class of the parties. For\nexample, he argues that citizens of the lower ranks (e.g., Blacks, women,\nchildren and lower and working classes) are more likely than the higher ranks to\nbe handled in a penal style (e.g., arrest), and less likely to be handled in a\nconciliatory or therapeutic style (e.g., mediation, separation, and counseling).\nSimilarly, the group-position model would suggest that members of a high socio-\neconomic tier are more inclined to have a close relationship with police since\nthey rely on the police to serve their interests.\nA number of empirical studies have found a significant connection between\nsocial class and evaluations of police, with people in the lower socioeconomic\nstratus more likely to have less favorable attitudes toward police than the\n& Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998). Other studies show that class conditions the effect\nof race on satisfaction with police, but the findings are less than conclusive.\nWhile some found that Whites' perceptions of the police become more positive\nas they move up the social structure (Hagan & Albonetti, 1982), others showed\nthat wealthy Blacks are more likely than poor Blacks to be less supportive of\nAlbonetti, 1982). Still others found that economically and educationally advan-\ntaged Blacks have more favorable evaluations of police (Priest & Carter,\nAge and gender\nTwo additional individual characteristics, age and gender, have been noted in\nthe research on public perceptions of police. It has been widely observed that\nyounger citizens tend to have less favorable attitudes toward police than older\ncitizens (Hurst & Frank, 2000; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002), although this relationship\nhas received less than consistent support (Decker, 1981). Some researchers\nargue that age is a stronger predictor of attitudes than race, gender, or social-\nthat the relationship between age and attitudes is unstable (Smith & Hawkins,\n1973). Still others found that the types of contact between youth and police are\nthe determinants of attitudes toward these authority figures (Rusinko, Johnson,\nTo explain the less positive attitudes toward police held by youth, Gaines,\nKappeler, and Vaughn (1994) suggested that younger people are more freedom-\noriented, while older people were more safety-oriented. In addition, they\nsuggested that younger people have less positive attitudes toward police\nbecause they are more likely to engage in risky behaviors than elderly people.\nTaylor and colleagues (2001) found that rather than holding negative percep-\ntions, juveniles are generally indifferent in their attitudes toward police.\nSullivan, Dunham, and Alpert (1987, p. 192) argued that different age groups\nmay have different conceptualizations. For example, violence means more in\nconceptualizing police demeanor towards Black teens than towards Black\nadults. Therefore, they concluded that \"attitudes are not unidimensional and\nare structured differently for different groups\".\nCompared to race, class, and age, findings on the impact of gender on public\nsatisfaction with police are less equivocal. Some studies have shown that males\ntend to hold less favorable attitudes toward police than females (Apple &\nfound that males hold more favorable attitudes (e.g., Correia, Reisig, & Lovrich,\ngender. For example, younger men tend to hold the most negative attitudes\nPersonal and vicarious experiences\nThe personal- and vicarious-experience explanation argues that individuals'\npersonal and/or vicarious experiences with crime and criminal justice, in\ngeneral, and the police, in particular, shape their evaluations of the police. Two\ntypes of individual and vicarious experiences related to crime/criminal justice\nand police, victimization and contact with police, have often been employed in\nresearch on public attitudes toward police.\nResearchers have not reached a consensus on the relationship between victim-\nization and satisfaction with police. Some early studies found that recent expe-\nrience as a victim did not influence attitudes toward police (Biderman, Louise,\nthreat of criminal victimization, either property or personal (Smith & Hawkins,\n1973). By and large, more recent studies, however, have indicated that victim-\nization experiences tended to increase unfavorable attitudes toward police\nthat recent victimization experiences and fear of crime had a larger impact on\ncitizens' confidence on police than any of their demographic variables (but see\nJackson & Sunshine, 2006). Others discovered that the effect of victimization on\nperceptions of police is conditional on race. For example, Apple and O'Brien\n(1983) found that victimization was negatively associated with perceptions of\npolice for Whites but not for Blacks (but see Priest & Carter, 1999).\nOne explanation for the negative association between victimization and\nsatisfaction with police is that victimization has a negative effect on citizens'\nsatisfaction through the mediating factor of \"contact with the police.\" Contact\nwith police has been found to influence public attitudes toward police.\nResearch done in New Zealand showed that younger victims, victims of\nburglary, and victims who were beneficiaries were more likely than other types\nof victims to express higher levels of dissatisfaction with police response\n(Morris, Reilly, Berry, & Ransom, 2003). They reported two reasons for victims'\ndissatisfaction: \"the police were seen as not having done enough\" and \"the\npolice appeared uninterested\" (p. 24). In addition, Tewksbury and West (2001)\nassessed crime victims' perceptions of police in one urban American community\nand found that the most satisfied citizens were those who perceived officers as\nhelpful, concerned, and courteous.\nThe effect of contact with the police has been revealed to differ based on\ntwo main factors: the type of police contact and the performance of police on\nthe scene. Previous research has consistently shown that type of police contact\nmakes a difference. Citizens who come into contact with police can be, among\nothers, offenders, victims, or service requesters. The first two groups can be\nseen as people who experience involuntary contacts, while the third group\nincludes people who experience voluntary contacts. Bordua and Tifft (1971)\nfound that individuals who were stopped and searched (i.e., experience invol-\nuntary contact) were more likely to report that police did not deserve more\nrespect than those without such experience. Similarly, Dean (1980) found that\nindividuals who come into contact as a result of criminal victimization or traffic\nstops tended to express significantly lower levels of satisfaction with police,\nwhile individuals who initiate police contact through calls for service did not\nshow such a trend. This, however, contradicts with an earlier study done by\nBoggs and Galliher (1975) who found that individuals who had called the police\nfor service had more negative evaluations, while police-initiated contacts\nseemed to have little impact on citizens' assessments.\nA recent study by Jesilow, Meyer, and Namazzi (1995) found that requests\nfor police service are associated with both positive and negative comments.\nThis might be because the researchers combined reporting crime and requests\nfor service as one predictor, thus may include the perception of crime victims.\nAs aforementioned research reveals, victimization experience tends to be\nnegatively related to citizens' satisfaction with police. Another recent study\ncreated four dichotomous variables: call dissatisfaction and call satisfaction for\nthose who had requested police service within the past six months, and stop\ndissatisfaction and stop satisfaction for those who had been pulled over by\npolice within the past six months (Reisig & Parks, 2000). They found that indi-\nviduals who were satisfied with either a call for service or a traffic stop were\nmore satisfied with police than persons who had no contact with police.\nResearch also showed that as the number of contacts with police increased, the\nlevel of public satisfaction decreased regardless of the nature of contacts\nDespite these fairly consistent findings, there is some research showing that\npositive interactions between residents and police do not influence residents'\nperceptions of officer effectiveness. For example, Hawdon and Ryan (2003) did\nan empirical test of community policing and found that it is the visible presence\nof officers in the neighborhoods, rather than the positive interactions between\nresidents and police, that improved respondents' opinions of police.\nOfficers' actions on the crime scene are also important predictors. Research\nhas shown that evaluations of response time affect public satisfaction with\nand evaluations of overall police performance (Priest & Carter, 1999). In addi-\ntion, an early study found that citizens are more likely to be satisfied with police\nwhen officers take their time to explain their course of action (Furstenberg &\nMore recent studies confirm that citizens' perceptions of injustice under\ncircumstances like a traffic stop by police are based more on normative factors\nthan instrumental factors (e.g., Engel, 2005). That is, citizens' perceptions of\nprocedural fairness and justice are as important as, if not more important than,\nthe perceptions of fair outcome in determining citizens' satisfaction level with\nthe criminal justice system. Therefore, there is an important association\nbetween the way in which citizens are treated and the positive perceptions of\ntreated those they stopped or served that accounted most for the link between\nsocial cleavage and perception of police. He contrasted the effects of experien-\ntial, on-scene factors with those of race, age, gender, and language on satisfac-\ntion with encounters between police and residents, and argued that the\npersonal characteristics of city residents affected satisfaction primarily through\nthe mediating variables of on-scene actions by police. Recent studies confirm\nthe importance of attributes of officers (e.g., demeanor and fairness) and the\nencounter (e.g., response time) in shaping citizens' attitudes toward police\nNeighborhood characteristics\nThe neighborhood-context explanation suggests that public satisfaction with the\npolice can be explained in terms of demographic and institutional characteris-\ntics of communities. This explanation can be linked to an ecological explanation\nof criminal behavior, the social disorganization theory, which argues that neigh-\nborhood structural characteristics, such as poverty, racial heterogeneity and\nresidential mobility, have both a direct and an indirect impact on the crime/\ndelinquency rates through the mediating factors of social disorganization\n(Sampson & Groves, 1989). Applying these ideas to the study of public percep-\ntion of criminal justice agencies, an argument can be made that low satisfaction\nwith police, in part, results from neighborhood structural characteristics and\nlevels of social organization. Neighborhoods characterized by high levels of\npoverty, racial heterogeneity and residential mobility would breed aggregated\ndissatisfaction with police because in these areas, there is an imbalance\nbetween formal control and informal control. Informal control decreases as\nneighbors are unable to agree upon and work toward common goals, as\npredicted by the theory of social disorganization. When informal social control\nis weak, formal social control increases, producing an increased likelihood of\nconflicts between neighborhood residents and police officers. Socially disadvan-\ntaged neighborhoods also have the weakest ability to \"... influence political and\neconomic decision-making and to acquire externally based goods and services\nthat may increase its ability to control crime in the area\" (Bursik & Grasmick,\nThough not often clearly specifying social disorganization theory as a foun-\ndation, recent research has begun to note the varied assessments of the\nperformance of same police force by residents in different neighborhoods. This\nline of studies focuses on differences in community culture and contexts, and\nexplores how macrolevel predictors of the neighborhoods can be related to\nindividuals' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with police. Neighborhood character-\nistics that affect citizens' perceptions of police include racial composition,\nsocioeconomic status, residential mobility, and local crime and victimization\nrates.\nRacial composition and class\nCompared to the research on individual racial and class background, the effects\nof neighborhood racial composition and socioeconomic status are relatively\nunderresearched. A small number of studies reported a link between neighbor-\nhood racial makeup and attitudes toward police (e.g., Apple & O'Brien, 1983;\nAmericans' dissatisfaction with police decreases from all-Black, to most-Black,\nto mixed and to most-White neighborhoods, whereas Whites' dissatisfaction\nincreases each step of the way from all-White to most-Black neighborhoods.\nThey claimed that \"It is not color of skin, but color of area that is associated\nwith dissatisfaction\" with police (p. 380). Similarly, Apple and O'Brien (1983)\nfound that African Americans' perceptions of the quality of police services\ndecline when percent African American in the neighborhood rises, but Whites'\nperceptions are not significantly related to neighborhood rate of percent\nAfrican American (when perception of neighborhood safety is controlled),\nsuggesting a possible interaction between individual racial background and\nneighborhood racial composition.\nThe interactive effects between neighborhood racial composition and class\nhave also been noted. For instance, Dunham and Alpert (1988) found that\nresidents of one middle-class and one lower-class predominantly Black neigh-\nborhood generally held more negative attitudes toward police than those who\nlived in the White neighborhood, but there were attitudinal variations between\nBlacks in the two Black neighborhoods. They thus concluded that neighborhood\ndifferences in attitudes toward police went beyond traditional racial distinc-\ntions and that the main factors defining neighborhoods included both racial\nmake-up and socioeconomic status.\nBased on data collected from three neighborhoods in Washington, DC,\nWeitzer (1999) found that residents of the Black lower-class neighborhood are\nmore likely than those who lived in the Black middle-class and the White\nmiddle-class neighborhoods to perceive or experience police abuse. Weitzer\nconcluded that the crucial factor in shaping public perception of police miscon-\nduct is neighborhood class position, rather than individuals' class or neighbor-\nhood racial composition. Similarly, neighborhood class status influences\nresidents' perceptions of police relations with their own versus other-race\nneighborhoods, with residents in the Black middle-class neighborhood more\nlikely to perceive fair police treatment than those in the Black lower-class and\nWhite middle-class neighborhoods (Weitzer, 2000).\nThe connection between neighborhood racial composition and class status is\nmost evident in recent research that has incorporated percent Black into the\nscale of neighborhood class status. A common way to measure neighborhood\nclass is through the concept of concentrated disadvantage. Sampson and\nJeglum-Bartusch (1998) define concentrated disadvantage as representing an\neconomic disadvantage factor in racially segregated urban neighborhoods that\nwas characterized by percentages of Black, poverty, public assistance,\nunemployment, female-headed families with children, and people under age\n18. Reisig & Parks (2000) operationalize concentrated disadvantage using\npercent Black, percent poor, percent labor force unemployed, and percent\nfemale-headed households. Both studies found that concentrated disadvantage\nis inversely related to satisfaction with police.\nResidential mobility\nResidential mobility is another important yet understudied factor. Research has\nnot established whether residential stability or mobility is associated with\nresidents' perceptions of the police for only a handful of studies have assessed\ntheir connection. Sampson and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) found that residential\nmobility is not significantly related to satisfaction with police. Among individ-\nual-level analyses, Jesilow et al. (1995) showed no association between length\nof residence and attitudes toward the police, while Zevitz and Rettammei\n(1990) reported a positive link between length of residence and satisfaction\nwith police service among elderly. More research clearly is needed to test the\nrelationship between residential mobility and attitudes toward police.\nViolent crime rates\nSince most residents do not have direct contact with the police, public\nperceptions of the police could also be a function of the real or perceived\ncrime problems within neighborhoods (Jacob, 1971). It has been found that\npeople who reside in high crime rate neighborhoods and people who are fear-\nful of crime in their neighborhoods tend to hold less positive views of police\nthat homicide rate was inversely associated with satisfaction, but such a rela-\ntionship was not statistically significant when concentrated disadvantage was\nadded into the model. This suggests that the effects of neighborhood crime\nrates have been attenuated by concentrated disadvantage. In fact, crime rates\nand concentrated disadvantage can be correlated with one another: Sampson\nand Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) found that violent crime rate is a significant\nfactor in explaining why residents of concentrated disadvantaged neighbor-\nhoods are most dissatisfied with police.\nThe effects of crime rate on residents' satisfaction level with local police can\nbe explained in various ways. First, high crime rates heighten people's fear of\ncrime, and cast doubt on their confidence on the police's capability of effec-\ntively performing crime control function. Second, more police officers are\nassigned to areas with high crime rates. There might be more negative or\ninvoluntary encounters between local residents and police occurring in these\nareas, which lead to lower public satisfaction with police. Finally, higher crime\nrates might lead to negative perceptions of police through the intervening\nmechanism of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the quality of life. This is\nespecially true when the crime or disorder problem is seen as falling under the\npurview of police (Jesilow et al., 1995).\nMethods\nData source and sample\nData used in this study were collected as part of the project Informal Social\nControl of Crime in High Drug Use Neighborhoods in Louisville and Lexington,\nKentucky, 2000. The project was originally designed to examine the effects of\ncultural disorganization on informal social control, and the extent to which\nthese effects may be conditioned by the level of drug use in the neighborhood\nThe data include two parts. Part 1 data were collected from face-to-face\n(25 percent) and telephone interviews (75 percent) with households in 66 block\ngroups out of two urban communities, Louisville and Lexington, in Kentucky in\n2000.2 A non-proportional stratified sampling of block groups was used to assure\na sufficient number of high drug use neighborhoods and an adequate distribu-\ntion of predominantly White, predominantly racially mixed, and predominantly\nminority neighborhoods. Within each block group, a systematic random\nsampling method was used to select approximately 60 households from the\nblock group. The person interviewed in the household was the one who had\nmost recently had a birthday and who was at least 18 years old. Part 2 data used\nin this study include aggregated variables from Part 1, as well as data from the\noriginal project). Cases with missing data were dropped from the analysis,\nresulting in a final sample of 1,963 individuals nested within 66 neighborhoods.\n2. The possible attitudinal differences across the two cities were examined. Residents in the two\ncities do not differ significantly in their attitudes toward police. The variable city thus is not\nincluded as an explanatory variable in the analysis.\nDependent variable\nThe dependent variable, satisfaction with police, is recoded as a dummy\nvariable with 1 representing satisfaction with police and 0 representing dissat-\nisfaction with police. The variable is constructed from an additive scale\nconsisting of three items: \"The police play an important role in preventing\ncrime in this neighborhood\"; \"The police do a good job in responding to people\nin this neighborhood after they have been victims of crime\"; and \"Police are\ngenerally helpful when dealing with people in this neighborhood.\" Response\ncategories include: 1 = strongly agree, 2 = somewhat agree, 3 = somewhat\ndisagree, and 4 = strongly disagree.3 The magnitude of internal consistency\nindicates a high level of reliability (Cronbach's alpha = . 84). As is commonly\nfound respondents report a high degree of satisfaction with the police. In this\nstudy, the scale was dichotomized because of the highly skewed nature even\nafter trying data transformation techniques.4 Those whose ratings in the scale\nequal 6 or lower are coded as 1 meaning overall satisfaction, and those whose\nratings equal 7 or higher are coded as 0 meaning overall dissatisfaction. In this\nmanner only those who answered strongly agree on at least one of the vari-\nables or somewhat agree on all three variables were coded as being satisfied\noverall.\nIndependent variables\nThe explanatory variables consist of both individual-level and neighborhood-level\npredictors. The individual-level predictors include demographic characteristics\nand individual crime and criminal justice experience. Demographic predictors\ninclude race (0 = White, 1 = Black), class (0 = lower class, 1 = middle class), age\n(measured in years) and gender5 (0 = male, 1 = female). The class variable was\nconstructed by combining three variables: education (0 = higher school degree or\nlower, 1 = higher than high school degree), employment (0 = currently not\n3. All three items thus have a range between 1 and 4 (1 = strongly agree and 4 = strongly disagree).\nThe first item (i.e., The police play an important role in preventing crime in this neighborhood) has\na mean of 1.70 and standard deviation .93, the second item (The police do a good job in responding\nto people in the neighborhood after they have been victims of crime) has an average of 1.69 and\nstandard deviation .91, and the third item (police are generally helpful when dealing with people in\nthis neighborhood) has a mean of 1.58 and standard deviation .84.\n4. A legitimate concern is that the collapse of the coding categories may cause a loss of information\ncontent. To address this concern, we ran additional analysis using multinomial HLM models. The\nresults are largely similar to those from the Bernoulli HLM models, which justifies the use of a\ndichotomous variable.\n5. It should be noted that about two-thirds of the sample respondents are females. Several possible\nexplanations may account for a high percentage of female respondents in the sample. One is that\nthe sample block groups included a high number of high drug use neighborhoods with a high percent-\nage of female-headed households. In these neighborhoods, women are more likely than men to be\nsurveyed. Another possible explanation is that females are more likely than males to be home\nmakers, which increases their possibility of being included. It is also possible that women are more\ninclined than men to accept research requests.\nemployed, 1 = currently employed), and home owner (0 = no, 1 = yes). Respon-\ndents who have a higher than high school degree, who are currently employed,\nand who are also home owners are coded as 1, representing middle class.6 The\nrest are coded as 0, representing lower class. Crime and criminal justice\nexperience includes victimization (0 = no victimization experience over the past\nthree months, 1 = respondents or anyone in their household being a victim of a\ncrime over the past three months) and harassment experience with the police\n(0 = no harassment experience in the past three months, 1 = respondents or\nanyone in their household being harassed by the police over the past three\nmonths).\nThe neighborhood-level predictors cover four neighborhood structural\ncharacteristics--neighborhood racial composition, concentrated disadvantage,\nresidential mobility, and violent crime rate. Based on the classification used by\npast research (e.g., Sun & Payne, 2004), neighborhoods are divided into three\ntypes: predominantly White (over 80 percent of residents are Whites), predomi-\nnantly African American (over 80 percent of residents are African Americans),\nand racially mixed (neither White residents nor African American residents\nexceed 80 percent of the neighborhood population). Among the 66 sample\npredominantly African American, and the remaining 29 (44 percent) are racially\nmixed. For the purpose of this analysis, predominantly White neighborhoods are\nused as the comparison group, thus only predominantly African American and\nracially mixed are entered into the neighborhood-level analysis.\nThe measure of concentrated disadvantage is obtained from a factor analysis\nof the following three 1990 census items7: the percentage of residents that\nwere living under the poverty line, the percentage of labor force that was\nunemployed, and the percentage of families with children that were headed by\nsingle women. The factor has an eigenvalue of 2.37 and explains nearly 80\npercent of the variance across the three items. Factor loadings range from .85\nto .91. The factor of concentrated disadvantage is affected most by the poverty\nrate, followed by unemployment rate and female-headed household rate.\n6. The percentage distributions for all three items are: 51.3 percent of the respondents have a\nhigher than high school degree, 20.3 percent are currently employed, and 49.2 percent own a home.\nIt should be noted that the construction of the individual-level class variable is slightly different\nfrom that of the neighborhood-level class variable (i.e., concentrated disadvantage) since the\ndataset does not contain information on individual family's income. One may also argue that requir-\ning a \"yes\" response on all three items may underestimate the percentage of middle class. An alter-\nnative explanation for the high percent of lower class individuals found in this study is that the\nsampling plan for this study was developed to assure a sufficient number of high drug use neighbor-\nhoods. In such a sample, it would be expected that the socioeconomic status of the respondents\nwould be lower than that expected in a representative sample.\n7. The 2000 census data were not used to construct structural characteristics because the dataset,\nwhich was obtained directly from ICPSR, did not include the 2000 Census data. The failure of the\noriginal researchers to include data from the 2000 Census is probably because when the original\ndata were collected in 2000, the 2000 Census data were not available. Since there is no identifier\nfor each specific sample block group in the data set, adding data from the 2000 Census into the\ndataset is impossible.\nOriginally, factor analysis was conducted to build up the scale of concentrated\ndisadvantage with four factors--poverty rate, female-headed household rate,\nunemployment rate, and percent Black. Percent African American was found to\nhave the lowest factor loading (.73). Together with our theoretical consider-\nation, it was decided to take percent African American out and use it as an inde-\npendent level-2 predictor.\nResidential mobility is measured as is traditional in social disorganization\nresearch by the percentage of residents who have lived in the neighborhood\nfor less than five years. Neighborhood violence crime rate is measured by the\naverage violent crime counts per thousand people per year in the neighbor-\nhood. We used police reports on violent crime counts in each neighborhood\nrobbery. Descriptive statistics for variables used in this analysis are shown in\nPossible multicollinearity problems were examined for among the six level-1\npredictors and the four level-2 predictors. The highest correlation is between\nconcentrated disadvantage and residential mobility (r = .56), which is tolerable.\nThe correlation matrices for the variables are presented in Table 2.\nAnalysis\nThe analysis included two main parts. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was\nthe primary modeling procedure used in the first part. It enabled us to exam-\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for variables\nVariable Range M SD N\nDependent variable\nExplanatory variables\nIndividual-level predictors\nNeighborhood-level predictors\nine the relative effects of individual race and class and neighborhood racial\ncomposition and class level in determining citizens' satisfaction with police.\nThe program used was HLM 6.02. Due to the binary nature of the outcome\nvariable, we used a Bernoulli sampling model with logit link instead of the\nstandard level-1 linear regression model. The dependent variable is the prob-\nability that a resident will report of being satisfied with police work. The\nanalysis began with estimating an unconditional model with no predictors at\neither level, followed by the conditional models. In the first step, individual-\nlevel predictors were added into the level-1 model to see if there is still\nsubstantial variation among the neighborhoods. Next, neighborhood-level vari-\nables were added into the level-2 model, one by one. In these models, the\nlevel-1 unit of analysis is the individual, while the level-2 unit of analysis is\nthe neighborhood.\nIn the second part of the analysis, the neighborhoods were divided accord-\ning to their social-economic status (i.e., the level of concentrated disadvan-\ntage). Then, logistic regressions were run in both \"low disadvantaged\nneighborhoods\" and \"high disadvantaged neighborhoods,\" using all individual-\nlevel independent variables. After that, comparisons were made between the\ncorresponding coefficients in the two regressions. The main purpose of this\npart is to examine the inter-racial gap in satisfaction with police across low\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods and high disadvantaged neighborhoods. This part\nof analysis is complementary to the first part because in the HLM analysis,\nonly the intercept function is used as the outcome variable to reduce the\ncomplexity of the model, thus there is no test of the interactive effects of\nindividual-level and neighborhood-level predictors. By doing this second part\nanalysis, how the slopes (i.e., the effects of race and class on satisfaction)\nvary across neighborhoods with distinctive social-economic status could be\nassessed.\nTable 2 Correlation matrices for explanatory variables\nBlack 1 --\nPredominantly black 1 --\nResults\nHierarchical linear models\nUnconditional model\nThe purpose of estimating an unconditional model was to gauge the magnitude\nof variation between neighborhoods in the probability of their residents to be\nsatisfied with police. Given a Bernoulli sampling model and a logit link function,\nthe level-1 model is simply\nand the level-2 model is\nwhere i indexes individuals and j indexes neighborhoods. ij is the probability\nthat respondent i from neighborhood j is satisfied with police. 0,0 is the\naverage log-odds of satisfaction with police across the 66 neighborhoods, while\n00 is the variance between neighborhoods in their average log-odds of satisfac-\ntion. The disturbance u0,j is assumed to be random normal with a mean of 0 and\nThus, for a neighborhood with a \"typical\" satisfaction level, that is, for a neigh-\nborhood with a random effect u0,j = 0, the expected log-odds of satisfaction is\nlevel in these neighborhoods is very high--about 83 out of 100 chances that\nrespondents would rate police performance as satisfactory.\nMeanwhile, we would expect that about 95 percent of the neighborhoods should\nthese log-odds to probabilities, it turns out that 95 percent of the neighborhoods\nlie between (.604, .939) with respect to its residents' probability of satisfaction\nwith police. As a result, there exists adequate variation between different neigh-\nborhoods in their residents' average level of satisfaction with police8--in certain\nneighborhoods, the average possibility that the residents rate police work as satis-\nfactory is only about 60 percent, while in others, it is as high as 94 percent.9\n8. We ran additional analysis using the uncollapsed scale as the dependent variable and the results\ndo support our statement on adequate variation among neighborhoods. For example, the average\npossibility that the residents rate police work as satisfactory is about 55 percent in certain neighbor-\nhoods, while it is as high as 95 percent in others. These results are in line with those from the esti-\nmation using the dichotomous dependent variable.\n9. Because of the nature of nonlinear link functions, we do not report the intraclass correlation\n(i.e., the ratio of level-2 variance to the total variation). Though it is a useful index in a standard\ntwo-level HLM, this measure is less informative in the case of Bernoulli sampling, because the level-\n1 variance now is heteroscedastic (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).\n    \nij j ij ij ij\n= -\n( )\n[ ]\n( )\nmeans log / ,\n  \n, , , ,\n, ~ , ,\nj j j\nu u N\n= + ( )\nConditional models with level-1 predictors\nModel 1 included all the level-1 predictors. We estimated the log of public\nsatisfaction with police as a function of race, class, age, gender, victimization,\nand harassment experience. Among them, race, class, gender, victimization,\nand previous harassment experience are uncentered, while age is group-\ncentered.10 Specifically, the level-1 model becomes:\nAt level 2, only the intercept term is treated as randomly varied across the\nThe results are presented in Table 3, model 1. For White, middle class,\nmiddle-aged males whose family members did not have any victimization or\nharassment experience in the past 3 months, the average log-odds of satisfac-\ntion with police is 00 = 1.928. The log-odds is lower for African Americans,\n10 = -.427, and such racial difference is statistically significant. This means\nthat being an African American reduces the odds of satisfaction with police by\nabout 35 percent. Being middle class has a positive impact on the log-odds of\nsatisfied with police are almost 50 percent higher than those for a lower class\nresident. Age is positively associated with a higher log-odds of satisfaction,\n30 = .031, holding constant other predictors in the model. When age increases\nby one year, the estimated odds of satisfaction with police multiply by 1.032;\nthat is, they increase by 3.2 percent, which is quite significant. Females are\nslightly less likely to be satisfied with police than males, but the difference is\nnot significant.\nBoth previous victimization and police harassment experience turn out to be\nsignificant predictors of residents' ratings of police performance. Being a crime\nvictim or having a family member as a crime victim reduces the odds of being\nsatisfied with police by approximately 34 percent. Even more significant, being\nharassed or having a family member being harassed by police substantially\ndecreases the odds of satisfaction with police by 67 percent, controlling for all\nother individual indicators. Previous harassment experience appears to have the\nstrongest predictive power among level-1 predictors.\nThe variance component drops from .349 in the unconditional model to .176\n10. Group-mean centering means that we centered age by substracting its corresponding level-2\nunit mean from each individual's actual age, so that the intercept 0j becomes the expected\noutcome for a subject whose age is in the average level of their neighborhood. This facilitates\ninterpretation of the variable when it becomes the outcome variable in the level-2 model. This\napproach also tends to reduce multicollinearity.\n11. Because of the large number of level-one predictors, we turn off the disturbance terms for\nslopes (from 1j to 6j), to reduce the complexity of the model and to make it easier for the\ncomputer program to calculate the variance and covariance.\n      \n\nij j j j j j j\nj\nge\n= + + + + +\n+\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) (\nBlack middle class a female\nvictimization harassment).\nTable 3 Hierarchical linear models for satisfaction with policea\nFixed effects Coeff.

Therefore, the next step is to\nadd neighborhood-level variables into the model to explain this variation.\nConditional models with level-1 and level-2 predictors\nThe between-neighborhood models analyze four factors measured at the\nmacrolevel: neighborhood racial composition, concentrated disadvantage,\nresidential mobility, and violent crime rate. Except for racial composition, all\nvariables are entered into the model after grand-mean centering. The level-1\nmodel remains the same, and the level-2 model is written as:\nSince the factors are entered one by one (except for the two racial composition\nmeasures which are entered simultaneously), four hierarchical linear models\nwere estimated. They are all intercepts-as-outcomes models because our inter-\nest at this stage is in modeling satisfaction averages with police removing the\neffects of all individual-level characteristics, rather than in the slopes.12\nThe results were presented in Table 3, models 2 to 5. Model 2 indicates that\nresidents in predominantly African American neighborhoods and racially mixed\nneighborhoods are significantly less likely to rate police work as satisfactory\ncompared to those who live in predominantly White neighborhoods. Note that\nwhen racial composition is added into the model, race at the individual level is\nno longer significant. The effects of other individual-level predictors remain\nlargely the same. By adding racial composition of the neighborhood, the\nmeans that neighborhood racial composition can explain approximately 41\nof the outcome variable.\nModel 3 shows that concentrated disadvantage is inversely associated with\nresidents' levels of satisfaction with police. Specifically, with one unit increase\nin the measure of concentrated disadvantage, the average odds of satisfaction\nwith police drops by about 24 percent (1 - .76). Thus the effect of concentrated\ndisadvantage is both statistically and substantially significant. Note that when\nconcentrated disadvantage is entered into the model, at the individual level,\nclass is no longer a significant predictor. At the neighborhood level, the signifi-\ncant difference between predominantly White neighborhoods and mixed\n12. Before adding in neighborhood-level characteristics, we did run a model that enables slopes of\nall individual-level predictors to vary randomly. The results show that the impact of the individual-\nlevel predictors on the outcome variable did not vary significantly at the .05 level across neighbor-\nhoods. We thus model 0j as a function of the level-2 predictors, and view other level-1 coefficients,\npj, p > 0, as fixed.\n    \n \nj\nj\nu\n= + + +\n+ + +\n, , , ,\n, , , .\n( ( (\n( (\npredominantly Black) racially mixed) concentrated\ndisadvantage) residential mobility) violent crime rate)\nneighborhoods no longer exists, while the gap between predominantly White\nneighborhoods and predominantly African American neighborhoods is still quite\ndf = 62, p = .068), indicating that concentrated disadvantage can explain\napproximately 53 percent of the remaining variation among different neighbor-\nhoods in their average levels of satisfaction with police.\nModel 4 adds residential mobility as another neighborhood-level predictor. The\nfindings indicate that the higher residential mobility, the lower probability that\nresidents would rate local police performance as satisfactory (mobility = -.98,\nSE = .48, p = .044). Meanwhile, by adding residential mobility, the effects of\nconcentrated disadvantage on the outcome variable has been attenuated signif-\nicantly (concentrated disadvantage= -.15, SE = .11, p =.184). Results from the final\nestimation of variance components show that adding residential mobility reduces\nmoderate degree of model improvement. Together, racial composition, concen-\ntrated disadvantage and residential mobility can explain as much as 87.5 percent\nof the interneighborhood difference in terms of the outcome variable. The\nremaining variation between neighborhoods only approaches significant at the .1\nlevel. Nonetheless, the decision was made to add one more level-2 predictor, the\nneighborhood violent crime rate, into the model, because it is a theoretically\nimportant variable and might cause significant changes in other variables'\nexplanatory power.\nHolding all other predictors constant, neighborhood violent crime rate is nega-\ntively associated with the log-odds of satisfaction with police (violence= -.01,\nSE = .00, p = .040). Neighborhoods with high levels of violence crime rates tend\nto have low satisfaction with police. The influences of all other predictors remain\nmore or less the same as those from previous models. A slight decrease occurs in\nthe effects of predominantly African American neighborhoods on residents' satis-\nfaction with police, although people who live in predominantly African American\nneighborhoods are still significantly less likely to have favorable attitudes toward\npolice. Neighborhood violence level, together with other neighborhood-level\npredictors, contributes approximately 92 percent of the variation across\nneighborhoods in terms of the outcome variable. The variance component\nmodel improvement. This is the final model.\nFrom this final model, we can see that overall satisfaction level with police is\nsuggesting that the log-odds of satisfaction with police for a White, lower class,\nmiddle-aged male with no previous victimization or harassment experience who\nlives in a neighborhood with predominantly White residents, average concen-\ntrated disadvantage level, average residential mobility level, and average\nviolent crime rate is 2.21. The odds ratio equals 9.07, meaning that the odds of\nsatisfaction with police are about nine times greater than the odds of dissatisfac-\ntion, controlling for all predictors. Therefore, the respondents are much more\nlikely to express satisfaction with police.\nLogistic regression models\nIn the second part of the analysis, the data were portioned by neighborhood\nsocial-economic status and tested for potential different patterns of results for\nresidents in low disadvantaged neighborhoods versus in high disadvantaged\nneighborhoods. Results from the previous HLM analysis indicated that concen-\ntrated disadvantage was not a significant predictor of satisfaction after control-\nling for neighborhood racial composition, residential mobility and violent crime\nrate. In this study concentrated disadvantage and residential mobility are\nmoderately (r = .56) correlated with each other. This means that the explana-\ntory power of the former could be somewhat attenuated by adding the latter.\nFor this reason, the 66 neighborhoods were evenly divided into half according to\ntheir levels of disadvantage and examined specifically for whether or not resi-\ndents in neighborhoods of different social-economic status vary in terms of the\nrelationship between individual-level predictors and satisfaction with police\nthat exist within them.\nThe results, presented in Table 4, show that neighborhood social-economic\nstatus does influence individual residents satisfaction with the police. The effect\nof a resident's race on satisfaction with police is conditional on neighborhood\nsocioeconomic status. In low disadvantaged neighborhoods, African Americans\nand Whites differ significantly in their attitudes toward police, with Blacks\nholding less favorable attitudes. In high disadvantaged neighborhoods, African\nAmericans and Whites display similar views toward police. Meanwhile, in low\nTable 4.

Social class, however, has no such impact at all in high disad-\nvantaged neighborhoods. Another difference exists in the effects of previous\nvictimization experience. It is interesting to observe that previous victimization\nexperience has a much stronger negative impact on citizens' satisfaction with\npolice in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods than in less disadvantaged ones.\nIn brief, the results of the logistic regressions reveal inter-racial differences\nin public satisfaction with police. Though overall African American residents are\nless likely than White residents to view police work as satisfactory, such inter-\nracial gap only exists significantly in less disadvantaged neighborhoods. In highly\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, residents, regardless of their race, hold similar,\nless favorable attitudes toward police.\nDiscussion\nThis study represents an attempt to empirically test the effects of individual\ncharacteristics, especially race and class, personal and vicarious experiences,\nand neighborhood contexts on residents' satisfaction with police. The results\nsupport a comprehensive framework that takes into account both individual and\nneighborhood explanations of satisfaction with the police. A general finding is\nthat individual background characteristics and experiences appear to be signifi-\ncant predictors of attitudes toward the police at the single-level analysis,\nwhereas neighborhood contexts, along with personal experiences, show better\nexplanatory power at the multilevel analysis.\nSpecifically, perhaps the most important conclusion is that neighborhood\ncharacteristics are important in predicting satisfaction with the police and that\nresearch that ignores the neighborhood-level influence is incomplete. Three\nmajor findings from the study lead to this conclusion. First, while the connec-\ntion between race and evaluation of local police is well established, residents'\nsatisfaction with police is not accounted for only by their race but is signifi-\ncantly affected by neighborhood racial composition. It was found that African\nAmericans are significantly more likely than Whites to rate police work as\nunsatisfactory only when neighborhood contextual factors are not controlled.\nOnce neighborhood characteristics, such as racial composition, are held\nconstant, the effect of race becomes non-significant. This finding is similar to\nSecond, in terms of class, the findings support past research that shows a\npositive connection between individuals' social class and their perceptions of\npolice. However, the impact of individual class does not persist when neighbor-\nhood class level is included in the analysis, suggesting that it is neighborhood\nclass status, rather than individual class status, that matters more in measuring\nsatisfaction with police. This finding echoes the results from a handful of\nneighborhood class level is also pivotal in conditioning the effect of individual\nracial background on satisfaction with police. In socially disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods African Americans and Whites display similar attitudes toward police,\nwhereas in socially advantaged neighborhoods African Americans are more likely\nthan Whites to have negative attitudes toward police. This implies that research\nclearly needs to take neighborhood class status into consideration when assess-\ning inter-racial differences in attitudes toward police.\nThird, racial composition, concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility,\nand violence crime rate are all good neighborhood-level predictors in determin-\ning public perception of police. Comparatively, the impact of racial composition\nis stronger than that of class level, indicating the primacy of aggregate-level\nmeasures of race in explaining satisfaction with police. Overall, the findings\nreveal the importance of considering neighborhood explanations and continuing\nto use interneighborhood predictors in future studies because they provide\ntheoretical foundations and account for a substantial amount of variation across\nneighborhoods in residents' satisfaction with police.\nExtending these findings to a broader level, while some researchers argue\nthat the importance of racial status is diminishing in the lives of Americans in\ngeneral (Wilson, 1987) and in predicting citizen satisfaction with the police in\nparticular (Jesilow et al., 1995), the results of this research show that\nAmericans are largely divided by race and class in their attitudes toward the\npolice. This finding, which signals the social distance between White and Black\nand between the rich and poor, supports Hacker's (1992) argument that the\nnation is moving toward two societies--one Black, one White, separate and\nunequal. Even after the civil rights movement and three decades of affirmative\naction and police reform, it seems that the legacy of social inequality still has\nan enduring effect on public perceptions of the police (Browning & Cao, 1992).\nBeyond the importance of neighborhood are other key findings. First, individ-\nual crime and criminal justice experiences are highly predictive of satisfaction\nwith police. The findings indicate that personal or family members' experiences\nof victimization or harassment by police have a negative influence on residents'\nevaluations of local police performance. This fining is consistent with the results\nfrom research on procedural justice. As mentioned earlier, this vein of studies\nposits that citizens' evaluations of police are heavily shaped by whether they\nperceive criminal justice agencies as fair and equitable in both the procedures\nfor making decisions and the outcomes of the decisions (Tyler, 1990; Tyler &\nDegoey, 1995). Indeed, citizens are more likely to have higher levels of satisfac-\ntion with police when they feel that the decision of the police results from just\nprocedures.\nSecond, although age was used as a control variable, it is found to be a\nconsistently significant predictor and better than any other demographic char-\nacteristic in predicting variation in citizens' satisfaction with police. This result\nis congruent with the findings from several previous studies that stress the\nimportance of age in shaping citizens' satisfaction with police (Hurst & Frank,\nThe findings of this study have several implications for future research. First,\nfuture studies should incorporate other individual-level variables, such as citi-\nzens' perceptions of the quality of their lives, into the within-neighborhood\nmodel. Reisig and Parks (2000) found that variables measuring \"quality of life\"\nare significant predictors of satisfaction with police at the individual level. They\nargued that it was not just objective neighborhood structural characteristics\nthat influence public perception of police--the \"cognitive and emotionally\nbased responses to neighborhood conditions\" might matter more (Reisig &\nParks, 2000, p. 625). We agree. Originally, the researchers attempted to include\ndisorder, indicated by both social disorder and physical disorder, into the level-\n2 model to test whether or not the aggregated quality of life would impact\nindividual perception. It turned out that the disorder measures were almost\nperfectly correlated with violence measures, so they were dropped. Future\nresearch should include measures of perception of neighborhood disorder or the\nquality of life into the analysis of satisfaction with police.\nSecond, more studies should be conducted to examine exactly how previous\nvictimization experiences influence satisfaction with police. The findings\nindicate consistent significant effects of victimization and harassment on\nsatisfaction with police. While the latter is quite easy to understand, the former\nneeds more elaboration. Does gender, race or class have any impact on the\nrelationship between victimization and satisfaction with police? Or, do factors\nother than victims' demographic characteristics, such as the types of crime and\nthe ways victims are handled, have greater influences? More theorizing work\nneeds to be done on victimization, and mere quantitative analysis is not enough.\nThird, future studies should also pay attention to the construction of neigh-\nborhood-level factors. Two questions are important to ask. One, what are the\nbest indicators for \"concentrated disadvantage?\" Recall that factor analysis was\nconducted to build up the scale of concentrated disadvantage with four\nfactors--poverty rate, female-headed household rate, unemployment rate, and\npercent Black. Percent African American was found to have the lowest factor\nloading. It was dropped from the scale and used as an independent level-2\npredictor. This way of constructing concentrated disadvantage proved impor-\ntant for this study. The findings suggest that this would also be appropriate in\nother cities with middle class, predominantly African American neighborhoods\nwhere conventional lifestyles and criminal lifestyles are closely integrated\n(Pattillo, 1998). In these neighborhoods, the most important indicator of\nconcentrated disadvantage is not racial composition, but class level.\nThe second question is: what is the relationship among these neighborhood\npredictors? Do neighborhood structural characteristics, such as concentrated\ndisadvantage, lead to high rates of violence crime, which, in turn, result in\nlower levels of satisfaction with police? It would be useful if hierarchical linear\nmodeling and structural equation modeling could be combined. In addition,\nwhat is the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and residential\nmobility? In this sample, they are correlated with one another in a moderately\nhigh manner--is this also the case for other neighborhoods?\nCitizen satisfaction with the police remains an critical issue for police admin-\nistrators during the postera of community policing or the information technol-\nogy era where geo-based crime prevention and fighting strategies and tactics\nbecome essential in performing a new model of policing that is mainly driven by\ndata and technology (Rosenbaum, 2007). In this sense, understanding of neigh-\nborhood-based attitudes toward the police and specific neighborhood charac-\nteristics that shape resident attitudes represents key data or information for\npolice managers to enhance public participation in crime prevention programs\nand police-community relations.\nOur findings also have other important implications for policy. First, given\nthat younger residents are less likely than elderly residents to be satisfied with\nlocal police, efforts should be made to improve police activity toward this group\nof individuals. For police departments, one of the keys is to increase positive\ncontacts and reduce negative contacts between younger citizens and police.\nPositive contacts could be cultivated through field training programs and\ncommunity policing programs, such as citizen police academy and school\nresource officers, whereas negative contacts could be reduced by avoiding\noverly aggressive enforcement and fairly applying of justice.\nSecond, police departments need to seek ways to improve their services to\ncrime victims, who have consistently shown a higher level of dissatisfaction with\npolice. According to past research, victims' negative perceptions of police come\nmainly from two sources: they blame police for failing to prevent the crime and\nperceive that officers treat them with complete indifference. It would be hard\nto stop citizens complaining about crime prevention or victimization, but it is\nfeasible to require officers to display polite behaviors and gracious manners in\ntheir contacts with victims. Police administrators should constantly cultivate a\ncompassionate understanding of human suffering or the so-called \"tragic\nperspective\" (Muir, 1977) among officers to enhance victims' satisfaction with\npolice.\nFinally, our findings indicate that variation in neighborhood contexts influ-\nences residents' evaluations of local police. Policymakers and practitioners thus\nshould continue to work together to build up positive physical and social capital\nfor highly disadvantaged neighborhoods. Physical capital could be strengthened\nby attending to quality of life issues, increasing neighborhood opportunity struc-\ntures, and implementing better environmental design, while social capital could\nbe enhanced by promoting community networks and cohesion, decreasing social\ndisorganization and crime, and attracting external capital-building institutions\n(White, 2006). Police departments should actively participate in community-\nbuilding and crime-prevention programs, and hopefully this kind of involvement\nwould lead to higher levels of satisfaction with police.\nReferences\nAnderson, E.
