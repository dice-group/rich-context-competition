Popkin\n Key words: adults, energy intake, eating behaviors, ep-\nidemiology, trends\nIntroduction\nThere has been a notable increase in American's total\nenergy intake in recent decades observed among all races/\nethnicities, ages, and economic levels. It is estimated that\n50% of the increase in daily caloric intake is coming from\nconsumption of calorically sweetened beverages, such as\nsoda (1). To date, research has focused on the rise in\ncalorically sweetened beverages and the decline in milk\n(1\u00ad11). However, shifts in the trends and overall patterns of\nbeverage intake need to be more broadly examined, as these\nshifts potentially contribute to the rising rates of obesity\nRecent reviews put forth by the Institute of Medicine\nPanel on Water and Electrolytes, the Beverage Guidance\nhave noted excessive added sugar in the U.S. diet from\ntion has led to outlining recommended beverage patterns\n(12). The overarching goal of these recommendations is to\nprovide for adequate hydration and nutrient consumption\nwhile keeping added calories from beverages at a minimum.\nThe present study adds to our current understanding of\nthe long-term trends in beverage consumption, including\nwater, by examining intake over a 35-year period and to the\nlarger body of literature on the topic of beverage consump-\ntion by examining overall beverage patterns and comparing\nthese patterns over time. Pattern analysis is useful because\nit provides additional information on the potential combined\neffect of beverage consumption, which cannot be deter-\nmined when only the consumption of individual beverages\nis examined, and it allows for more specific identification of\nbehavior patterns for targeted interventions.

Each survey was designed to be nationally\nrepresentative. Detailed information about each survey and\nits sampling design has been published previously (16\u00ad19).\nDietary Intake\nNCFS 65 and NCFS 77. Information on dietary intake\nwas collected over 3 consecutive days using a single inter-\nviewer-administered 24-hour recall followed by a self-ad-\nministered 2-day diet record. Information on all foods and\nbeverages consumed both at and away from home was\nrecorded; 3-day values were averaged.\nNHANES III and NHANES 02. For these examinations, a\nsingle 24-hour dietary recall was administered by trained\ndietary interviewers. Respondents reported all foods and\nbeverages consumed (plain drinking water collected sepa-\nrately for NHANES III) for the previous 24-hour time\nperiod. For NHANES III, a 4-step automated coding and\ncollection system known as the NHANES III Dietary Data\nCollection System was used to collect all dietary recall data.\nFor the NHANES 02 survey, the United States Department\nof Agriculture's automated multiple pass method, a 5-step\ncomputerized dietary recall instrument, was used for data\ncollection.\nBeverage Groups\nSixteen beverage variables were used in our analyses:\nwater, unsweetened coffee and unsweetened tea (do not\ncontain cream or sugar), low-fat milk (1.5%, 1%, and skim),\nnon-calorically sweetened beverages (diet sodas or other\n\"diet\" beverages), fruit juice (100% fruit juice), vegetable\njuice (100% juice), sports drinks, whole fat milk (2%),\nalcohol (beer, wine, and liquor), soda (calorically sweetened\nsoda only), fruit drinks (beverages containing 100% juice,\nor with added sweeteners), sweetened coffee, sweetened tea\n(contain cream and/or sugar), other sweetened beverages\n(e.g., horchata, a sweetened rice beverage, and coconut\nmilk), and other beverages (e.g., protein-rich meal replace-\nment drinks and instant breakfast shakes).\nThese beverages were grouped in accordance with the\nrecent beverage guidance system (12), which combined\nbeverages according to 1) their energy and nutrient density,\n2) contribution to total energy intake and body weight, 3)\ncontribution to the daily intake of essential nutrients, 4)\nevidence for beneficial health effects, and 5) evidence for\nadverse health effects. For example, unsweetened coffee\nand tea were combined into a single category. This grouping\nresulted in 6 broad beverage groups, hereafter referred to as\nBeverage Levels, including water (Level 1), unsweetened\ncoffee and tea (Level 2), low-fat milk (Level 3), non-\ncalorically sweetened (diet) beverages (Level 4), caloric\nbeverages containing nutrients (Level 5), and calorically\nsweetened beverages (Level 6). These categories are similar\nStatistical Analyses\nTrends. Trends are presented as calories per capita per\nday, percent consuming, and calories per consumer. We\nused survey commands to account for survey design,\nweighting, and clustering (Stata 9.2; StataCorp., College\nStation, TX). All values were adjusted to the 1965 age and\ngender distribution and are reported as mean (percent) plus\nstandard error. Change in the percent consuming and aver-\nage caloric intake among consumers was calculated by\nwhole percent/calorie). To test for statistical differences\nbetween years, we used independent 2-sample t tests, with\np  0.01 set for statistical significance.\nPatterns. We elected to compare beverage patterns be-\nthe spring of 1965, and there were concerns about the effect\nof seasonality on beverage consumption; and 2) data in\nNFCS 65 lacked demographic information at the level of the\nindividual, precluding comparison across important sub-\ngroups of the population.\nTo generate descriptive patterns of overall beverage con-\nsumption, we used non-hierarchical cluster analysis. Cluster\nanalysis uses available data, rather than a priori defined\npatterns, to create groups of individuals with similar pat-\nterns, in this case, similar patterns of beverage consumption\ndetail elsewhere (21) and has been used in previous studies\nbeverage variables were dichotomized due to the large\nnumber of non-consumers. However, due to large variation\nwere categorized into a 3-level variable, providing a more\naccurate representation of consumption. In 1977, individu-\nals were identified as being non-consumers, medium coffee\nconsumers [22 fl oz (median amount reported by consum-\ners)], or high coffee consumers (22 fl oz). Similarly, in\n2002, individuals were classified as being non-consumers,\nmedium soda consumers [19 fl oz (median amount re-\nported by consumers)] or high soda consumers (19 fl oz).\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: NFCS, National Food Consumption Surveys; NHANES, Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nBeverage Consumption, Duffey and Popkin\nClustering was performed on an unweighted sample. We\ntested a range of 3 to 8 cluster solutions (i.e., patterns of\nbeverage consumption) and clustered on the following bev-\nerage variables: unsweetened coffee, unsweetened tea, low-\nfat milk, diet beverages, whole fat milk, fruit and vegetable\njuice (combined), alcohol, and soda and fruit drinks (com-\nbined). Water and sports drinks were not used because\ninformation on intake was not collected in 1977. The most\nrobust and parsimonious cluster solution (containing no less\nthan 5% of the sample in each cluster) was selected as the\nfinal solution.\nThese clusters, which represent overall patterns, or com-\nbinations, of beverage intake, were named according to 1)\nthe beverages that dominated each pattern and 2) the bev-\nerages that helped differentiate one pattern from another. In\nsumed whole fat milk, 24% consumed fruit or vegetable\njuice, and fewer than 10% of the persons reported consum-\ning any of the other beverages. Since the other clusters had\nbetween 30% and 36% of the persons within them consum-\ning fruit and vegetable juice, this variable did not help\ndifferentiate between patterns. Thus, this particular cluster\nwas named whole fat milk. Age, race, and gender probabil-\nities were calculated using Stata.\nResults\nBeverage Trends\nincrease in the per capita total caloric intake from beverages\n0.01), the contribution of beverages to overall caloric intake\nincreased as well.

Although significantly fewer people\nconsumed whole-fat milk, among consumers, there was no\nchange in caloric intake from this beverage. With fruit\ndrinks, there was not a significant increase in the percent\nconsuming, but there was a significant increase in the ca-\nloric intake from this beverage. For soda and alcohol, not\nonly was there a significant increase in the percent of people\nconsuming these beverages, but those who were consuming\nobtained significantly more calories from these 2 beverages\na greater volume of beverages being consumed, with the\ngreatest increase accounted for by calorically sweetened\nbeverages, alcohol, and unsweetened coffee and tea.\nAlthough caffeine is a mild diuretic, the increases in\ncoffee and tea consumption are likely not great enough to\nFigure 1: Per capita beverage consumption (fl oz) in 1989 and 2002 presented by beverage levels. To convert ounces to grams, divide by\n0.035; to convert fluid ounces to milliliters, multiply by 29.57. Results are weighted to be nationally representative and standardized to the\n1965 age and gender distribution. Beverage levels established by the Beverage Guidance System (12): Level 1, water; Level 2, unsweetened\ncoffee and tea (do not contain cream or sugar); Level 3, low-fat milk (1% or skim); Level 4, diet beverages; Level 5, caloric beverages\ncontaining nutrients (fruit juice, vegetable juice, whole-fat milk, sports drinks, and alcohol); Level 6, caloric beverages not containing\nnutrients (soda, fruit drink, sweetened coffee, sweetened tea, and other sweetened beverages).\nBeverage Consumption, Duffey and Popkin\nresult in significant increases in health risk. Many human\nstudies indicate that caffeine consumption of up to\nroughly 500 mg/d does not lead to dehydration or chronic\nwater imbalance (26,27) and that moderate caffeine in-\ntake (up to 400 mg/d) is not associated with increased\nrisk of hypertension, heart disease, osteoporosis, or high\ncholesterol (28). The average amount of coffee and tea\nreported is equivalent to roughly 236 mg caffeine/d, well\nbelow the recommended 400 mg/d level. However, recent\nincreases in the availability of highly caffeinated energy\ndrinks, such as Red Bull (not measured in these data), and\nthe combined effect of consuming an overall beverage\npattern dominated by coffee and soda may mean that\nindividuals are reaching these upper limits. As the con-\nsumption of these highly caffeinated beverages becomes\nmore prevalent, effects on caffeine intake specifically\nmay be warranted.\nThe differences in beverage patterns observed between\nsumption has changed. Generally, the patterns in 2002 were\ndominated by a greater number of beverages, and patterns\nemerged that were dominated by beverages that did not\ndominate patterns in 1977, for example, diet beverages.\nOverall, similar beverages tended to cluster together at each\ngroups comprised of higher caloric beverages (soda, whole-\nfat milk, and alcohol) and some patterns comprised of lower\nor non-caloric beverages (low-fat milk and tea).\nWhat we found, however, is that the patterns dominated\nby soda were less frequently observed in 1977 than they\nwere in 2002. Furthermore, a larger proportion of the pop-\nulation in 1977 consumed beverages in patterns dominated\nby whole-fat milk and coffee, beverages that did not appear\nin patterns of beverage consumption in 2002. These patterns\nrepresent important differences in consumption behavior\nacross time and suggest that the potential combined caloric\nintake from beverages is considerably larger among some\nindividuals compared with others, depending on the com-\nbination of beverages being consumed. Finally, understand-\ning patterns of consumption allows for more targeted inter-\nventions aimed at changing broader behaviors, rather than\nrelying on narrowly focused intervention messages (29\u00ad\n32), and patterns have served as important tools in health\noutcomes research.\nInterpretation of these results should be viewed cau-\ntiously, as methods for collecting dietary intake information\nchanged over the course of the 4 surveys. Most notable is\nthe adoption of the 4-step multiple-pass method for collect-\ning 24-hour dietary recall in NHANES III and the 5-step\nmultiple pass method implemented in NHANES 02. The\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, responsible for conducting\nthe NHANES studies, did not conduct bridging studies to\ndetermine if systematic changes in reporting occurred as a\nresult of these methodological changes; thus, possible con-\nfounding of time and methodological effects remains. One\nmight speculate that more accurate reporting of beverages\nas a result of changes to intake methods would artificially\ninflate intake estimates; however, bridging studies between\nfood composition estimates resulting from changes in meth-\nodologies did not significantly impact results (33,34). Ad-\nditional limitations include the fact that dietary intake in-\nformation was collected over just one season in 1965. In\naddition, the potential exists for systematic under-reporting\nby BMI category. Specifically, it has been demonstrated\nthat overweight individuals tend to under-report dietary\nintake (35\u00ad38), which may result in an underestimation of\nbeverage consumption. Given the increasing prevalence of\noverweight and obesity over time, the magnitude of under-\nreporting may have also increased, resulting in an underes-\ntimation of the upward trends in beverage consumption.\nFinally, due to recent changes in the availability of certain\ndrinks, specifically caffeinated waters and other caffeinated\nbeverages, we cannot adequately address the effects of\nchanges in consumption of these beverages in the American\ndiet.\nAlthough the mechanisms have not been elucidated, ev-\nidence suggests that individuals' compensation for liquid\ncalories is different from compensation for calories from\nsolid foods (39,40). Mattes reported a complete lack of\ncompensation for fluid intake, suggesting that these calories\nare not readily \"registered\" for appetite regulation (41).\nFurthermore, in a 4-week crossover study comparing inges-\ntion of 450 kcal of calorically sweetened fruit drink vs. solid\nsweetened food (jelly beans), there was a significant in-\ncrease in body weight during the fluid consumption that was\nnot observed for the solid food (42).\nDelineating the role that beverages play in a healthy diet\nmay be a valuable piece of the public health message aimed\nat stemming obesity rates. Toward this end, the present\nstudy improves our understanding of the contribution of\nbeverages to overall caloric intake and the dynamic inter-\nactions of beverages as overall patterns of consumption. For\nthe average American, beverages represent a significant\nsource of excess calories providing, for the most part, little\nadded nutritional benefit above what would be obtained by\nconsuming whole foods. To clarify, although consumption\nof fruit juice provides essential vitamins and nutrients, the\nadded calories and weaker compensatory response elicited\nby beverages make consumption of fruit juice less desirable\nthan consumption of the fruit itself. The exception may be\nthe consumption of low-fat milk, which may confer health\nbenefits (43\u00ad45), especially to certain populations, when it\nreplaces other beverages (46,47), although the evidence is\nnot conclusive (48). While children are mostly targeted for\npolicies regarding access to various beverages, the present\nstudy shows that this is also a salient issue for adults.\nBeverage Consumption, Duffey and Popkin\n"
