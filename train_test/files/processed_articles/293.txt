Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) causes Kaposi sarcoma. In the United States, transmission routes\nfor HHV-8 are uncertain.\nMethods. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III sampled individuals from the US general\nreading frame [ORF] 73 antigens) in 13,894 surveyed adults. HHV-8 seroprevalence was examined according to\nsexual history and viral coinfection markers.\nResults. Overall, seroprevalence was low when a highly specific cutoff was used (K8.1, 1.6%; ORF73, 1.5%)\nbut was higher when a less-specific cutoff was used (K8.1, 7.1%; ORF73, 7.4%). When the more-specific approach\nwas used, K8.1 seroprevalence was similar in men and women. Men who have sex with men (MSM) had a higher\nK8.1 seroprevalence (8.2%). Among other men, K8.1 seroprevalence was marginally associated with duration of\nheterosexual activity ( ) and was positively associated with the lifetime number of sex partners ( )\nand with coinfections with hepatitis B virus (6.1% vs. 1.2% without coinfection; ) and herpes simplex\nvirus 2 (2.7% vs. 1.0%; ). Among women, K8.1 seroprevalence was not significantly related to duration\nof sexual activity, the lifetime number of sex partners, or viral coinfections. The ORF73 EIA revealed similar but\nless clear-cut patterns.\nConclusions. Among men, HHV-8 transmission may occur through sexual activity, particularly sex with other\nmen. No evidence was observed for heterosexual transmission to women.\nHuman herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the etiologic agent\nof Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a malignancy that occurs at\ngreatly increased incidence in persons coinfected with\nHIV [1\u00ad4].

Shown are the no. of people randomly selected\nfor NHANES III ( ) and the subset interviewed ( ) who were considered NHANES III participants. The present study included only\nadults who were examined, had blood obtained by phlebotomy, and for whom remaining serum samples were available. Thus, the final sample size\nare therefore a select group. There have been no studies eval-\nuating risk factors for infection in the general US population.\nFurthermore, studies have used varying HHV-8 assays with\ndiffering or uncertain sensitivity and specificity [17, 19], making\ncomparisons across studies and populations problematic. Thus,\nfurther data on the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the United States\nwould be valuable.\nIn the present study, we used serum samples and data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III--a large, population-based, cross-sectional\nstudy--to study the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the US general\nadult population. We describe evidence of sexual transmission\nof this virus among US men.\nNHANES, which is conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, US Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, is a series of cross-sectional surveys that provide national\nstatistics on the health and nutritional status of the US non-\ninstitutionalized civilian population through household inter-\nviews, standardized physical examinations, and collection of\nbiological samples at special mobile examination centers [20].\n39,365 individuals randomly sampled through a complex, mul-\ntistage probability design [20]. Specific subgroups were over-\nsampled, including children, elderly persons, non-Hispanic\nblacks, and Mexican Americans.\nThe present article describes data on adults aged 18 years or\nbotomy performed. We performed HHV-8 antibody testing on\n13,894 subjects with available remaining serum samples.\nLaboratory methods. HHV-8 antibody testing was per-\nformed using EIAs to detect antibodies to the HHV-8 K8.1\nstructural glycoprotein (expressed during lytic viral replication)\nand open reading frame (ORF) 73 (also known as latency-\nassociated nuclear antigen, a viral regulatory protein expressed\nduring latent infection). Serum samples were diluted 1:20 for\nbeen detailed elsewhere [21]. We measured both K8.1 and\nORF73 antibodies because some infected individuals, includ-\ning those with KS, make antibodies only to lytic or latent\nHHV-8 testing was conducted over a period of 6 months.\nQuality control criteria determined an acceptable range for var-\niation in the controls, and plates that had control optical density\nvalues outside the acceptable range were repeated. Nonetheless,\nthere was noticeable plate-to-plate variability in the EIA optical\ndensity results for the positive controls on each plate and, in\nparallel, in the mean optical density value for samples tested\non each plate. To account for this plate-to-plate variability, we\nadjusted the optical density results for samples by regressing\nthem against the mean optical density of the positive controls\non the respective plate. The regression equations were as fol-\nlows:\nsample positivecontrol\nij i ij\nfor the K8.1 assay, and\nsample positivecontrol\nij i ij\nfor the ORF73 assay, where i denotes the plate, j denotes the\nsample, and Rij\nis the residual from the regressions. A sample's\nresidual Rij\nvalue can be interpreted as the amount that the\nsample's optical density was above or below the expected value\nfor that plate. For most samples, these residuals clustered in a\nsingle peak with low antibody levels, although there was a mi-\nnority of individuals who had higher reactivity. After visual\ninspection of histograms of the residuals, we chose cutoffs for\nassay), with subjects whose residuals were above the cutoff\nclassified as seropositive. The cutoffs chosen from the regression\nwere highly conservative, to increase the specificity of the EIAs\nand to enhance the positive predictive value of the test results.\nAs a consequence, seroprevalence results may underestimate\nthe true prevalence of HHV-8 infection, but comparisons of\nresults across groups should be valid. In a sensitivity analysis,\nwe used cutoffs for these EIAs that we had used previously: for\nthe K8.1 EIA, the cutoff was ; for the\nnegativecontrol\nORF73 EIA, the cutoff was . These cutoffs\npositivecontrol\nyielded higher seroprevalence estimates but did not fully ac-\ncount for the plate-to-plate variability captured by the regres-\nsion method.\nLaboratory testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)\u00ad1, HSV-2, and hu-\nman papillomavirus (HPV)\u00ad16 was performed as described\nelsewhere [23\u00ad27]. Antibodies to HBV core antigen were de-\ntected by radioimmunoassay [25]. Samples were tested for HCV\ninfection with a second-generation EIA and a supplemental test\n[23]. The presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection was assessed\nusing immunodot assays for viral gG1 and gG2 glycoproteins,\nStatistical methods. We examined HHV-8 seroprevalence\nin the total population and in subgroups of NHANES III sub-\njects. These analyses considered each EIA separately, to account\nfor biological variability in serological responses; for compar-\nison, we also present an overall estimate of seroprevalencebased\non positivity on either EIA. The primary analyses used the\ncutoffs chosen on the basis of our regression method, but, in\na sensitivity analysis, we also examined seroprevalence based\non prior cutoffs.\nHHV-8 seroprevalence estimates were weighted according to\nthe NHANES III sampling scheme, to provide unbiased esti-\nmates for the total US population and specific demographic\nsubgroups. However, adult NHANES III participants lacking\nserum samples for our study were older than the included\nsubjects and differed from them by sex and race/ethnicity (data\nnot shown). Because these differences could have introduced\nbias, we generated a new set of sample weights by poststratifying\nthe standard NHANES III sample weights, so that the new\nweighted totals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity matched cor-\nresponding totals for the US population [28]. All analyses used\nthese new sample weights.\nWe report HHV-8 seroprevalence data for specific subgroups\nof NHANES III subjects. Subjects with missing data were ex-\ncluded. Race/ethnicity was defined as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Mexican American; persons not fitting\nthese categories were still included in the total population. We\nexamined HHV-8 seroprevalence according to markers of sex-\nual activity separately for men and women, because preliminary\nanalyses revealed important differences by sex. All participants\n17\u00ad59 years old were asked questions regarding sexual history\nin a face-to-face interview. Questioning began with, \"At what\nage did you first have sexual intercourse?\" and, for subjects\nwho had had intercourse, \"With how many different partners\nhave you ever had sexual intercourse?\" Men were further asked\nhow many of these partners were male. We considered MSM\nactivity to be present if a man reported at least 1 male sex\npartner. We examined seroprevalence according to the duration\nof sexual activity, lifetime number of sex partners, and MSM\nactivity. Among sexually active adults, the duration of sexual\nthe current age minus the age at first reported sexual activity.\nThe lifetime number of sex partners was categorized into quar-\nroprevalence according to coinfection with viruses considered\nto be transmitted sexually (HBV, HSV-2, and HPV-16), sexually\nor through other intimate contact (HSV-1), and through par-\nenteral exposures such as injection drug use (HCV).\nSUDAAN (release 9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute), a sta-\ntistical package for analyzing complex survey data with mul-\ntistage sampling, was used for analysis. We calculated sero-\nprevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the\nbasis of the logit method. P values for differences in seroprev-\nalence across groups were derived from the Wald F test from\nlogistic regression models. Tests of trend across categories were\nperformed using logistic regression by assigning increasing in-\nteger values to increasing levels of the categories. Because we\nwere concerned that small numbers could affect the validity of\nthese P values, we checked them using a quasi-score test [29],\nand these agreed. We examined associations with markers of\nsexual activity separately for men and women, adjusting for\nage (in 5 categories, treated as an ordinal variable) as a potential\nconfounder.\nRESULTS\nwere K8.1 seropositive, yielding a seroprevalence estimate of\nuals who were ORF73 seropositive according to a specific cutoff,\nThere were 436 individuals seropositive on either assay, cor-\nA total of 109 individuals were seropositive on both assays\n( ).\nAs noted in Subjects and Methods, in a sensitivity analysis,\nwe also calculated seroprevalence using previous assay cutoffs.\nIn that approach, the overall seroprevalence was substantially\nDemographic patterns in K8.1 and ORF73 seroprevalence\nare shown in table 1, using the highly specific cutoffs chosen\nafter standardizing EIA results for plate-to-plate variability.\nK8.1 seroprevalence increased with age, from 0.6% among those\n). K8.1 seroprevalence was higher among non-Hispanic\nblacks (2.1%) and Mexican Americans (2.1%) than among\nnon-Hispanic whites (1.5%). K8.1 seroprevalence decreased\nwith level of education ( ) and, in the comparison of\nmarital status, was higher in individuals who were widowed or\nseparated/divorced than in those who were married or never\nmarried ( ). K8.1 seroprevalence was also higher in\nindividuals living in households with incomes below the US\npoverty level than in those at or above the poverty level\n( ). K8.1 seroprevalence was the same in men and\nwomen ( ) and did not vary by place of birth (table 1).\nPatterns for ORF73 seroprevalence were similar to those for\nK8.1 seroprevalence, but differences across subgroups were less\ndistinct and did not reach statistical significance (table 1).\nMSM activity (weighted prevalence, 1.9% among all men [95%\nCI, 1.2%\u00ad3.0%]). The median number of reported male part-\nners was 4 (interquartile range, 2\u00ad15). K8.1 seroprevalence was\nsubstantially higher in this small group of MSM than in men\n!60 years old who did not report a history of MSM activity\n(8.2% vs. 1.3%; ). A less-pronounced difference was\nthe previous assay cutoffs were used, each assay yielded higher\nWe next examined patterns in HHV-8 seroprevalence ac-\ncording to sexual history and markers of other viral infections.\nResults are shown separately for men (excluding 69 MSM; table\n2) and women (table 3), again when assay cutoffs with high\nspecificity were used. Results were similar to those in table 2\nwhen we excluded older men (who were not asked about sexual\nhistory) or other men for whom data on MSM activity were\nmissing (data not shown).\nAmong men (table 2), K8.1 seroprevalence increased with\nthe duration of heterosexual activity ( ) and lifetime\nnumber of heterosexual partners ( ), although these\ntrends were not strong and were reduced in significance after\nadjustment for age ( and , respectively). K8.1\nserostatus was associated with coinfections with HBV (K8.1\nseroprevalence, 6.1% in subjects with coinfection vs. 1.2% in\nsubjects without coinfection; ), HSV-1 (1.9% vs. 0.2%;\nciations remained significant after age adjustment. K8.1 sero-\nstatus was not associated with HCV or HPV-16 coinfection.\nAmong women (table 3), K8.1 seroprevalence did not in-\ncrease significantly with either duration of sexual activity or\nlifetime number of sex partners, but seroprevalence was rela-\ntively high (4.6%) among the few women reporting no prior\nsexual activity. The 5 K8.1-seropositive women who reported\nno prior sexual activity ranged in age from 18 to 59 years, and\nall were unmarried; 2 were coinfected with HSV-1, but oth-\nerwise all were uninfected with the other viruses considered.\nOverall, K8.1 seroprevalence in women was nonsignificantly\nelevated in women coinfected with HSV-1 (1.7% vs. 0.9%;\nat all in women coinfected with HBV (1.6% vs. 1.5%; ).\nK8.1 serostatus was not associated with HCV or HPV-16\ncoinfection.\nTo some extent, patterns in ORF73 seroprevalence for men\nand women mirrored those for K8.1 seroprevalence, although\nthey were less pronounced (tables 2 and 3). In men, ORF73\nseroprevalence was lower in HCV-infected subjects than in un-\ninfected subjects ( ), but this association was not sig-\nnificant in women. In both men and women, ORF73 se-\nroprevalence was positively associated with HBV coinfection\nspectively). Among women, there were nonsignificant inverse\nassociations with HSV-1 and HSV-2 coinfection (table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically\nevaluate the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the general US pop-\nulation. We used 2 different assays to independently measure\nantibodies to HHV-8 proteins expressed in lytic or latent in-\nfection. An important finding was the association between\nHHV-8 serostatus and markers of sexual risk behaviors among\nmen.\nTable 1.

HHV-8 seroprevalence was noticeably lower among MSM\nlikely explanation is the high specificity of the assay cutoffs that\nwe relied on. Indeed, HHV-8 seroprevalence in MSM was ma-\nterially higher when we used our prior cutoffs. Another expla-\nnation could be the recruitment of men in NHANES III from\nTable 2.

[4]). Likewise, men in the general population who report\nMSM activity may engage in less-risky types of behavior than\nthose considered typical for MSM in prior studies (e.g., atten-\ndance at \"bath houses\" or the use of stimulant drugs).\nTable 3.

These associations might arise be-\ncause of the heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 to men. How-\never, it is equally plausible that our findings reflect unreported\nMSM activity. In NHANES III, questions regarding sexual ac-\ntivity were asked in a face-to-face interview, and the proportion\nof men who reported prior sexual activity with other men (1.9%\nsurveys (4.7%) [32]. It is therefore not possible to rule out that\nunderreporting of MSM activity by NHANES III males ac-\ncounts for the observed associations with markers of sexual\nactivity among men.\nInterestingly, we did not find evidence that HHV-8 sero-\nprevalence was associated with these same markers of sexual\nactivity among women. Both women and men could have un-\nderreported their sexual history, which might have obscured\nan association with sexual transmission. Nonetheless, HHV-8\nwas only weakly associated with HSV-2 in female subjects, even\nthough HSV-2 is sexually transmitted and a clear relationship\nbetween HSV-2 and sexual history is present in women in\nExisting data on heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 are\ninconclusive. One prior study of male and female attendees at\na sexually transmitted disease clinic found no association be-\ntween HHV-8 infection and number of recent partners [9].\nStudies of HIV-infected men and prostitutes also have provided\nno evidence for heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 [7\u00ad9, 33],\nalthough the studies were limited by small size. Interestingly,\nin 2 high-risk cohorts of US women, HHV-8 serostatus was\npositively associated with HIV infection and a history of other\nsexually transmitted infections but was not related to the life-\ntime number of male sex partners or prior sex with a bisexual\nman [10, 34]. In support of heterosexual transmission of HHV-\n8 to US women, KS risk is especially high among HIV-infected\nwomen who acquire HIV (and, presumably, HHV-8) from a\nWays by which HHV-8 could be transmitted sexually are\nuncertain. HHV-8 is frequently shed in saliva from infected\nindividuals [11], raising the possibility of direct oral transmis-\nsion (e.g., by kissing). Among homosexual men, HHV-8 in-\nfection is strongly associated with a recent history of oral or\nanal sex [5, 30], which may involve contact of saliva with the\ninsertive partner's penis. Given the associations that we ob-\nserved with markers of sexual activity among men but not\nwomen, it is possible that HHV-8 is spread heterosexually to\nmen through similar acts between a man and his infected female\nsex partner.\nWe also observed differences in HHV-8 seroprevalence by\nrace/ethnicity, education level, marital status, and household\nincome. The elevated seroprevalence among blacks and Mex-\nican Americans and among those with lower education level\nand household income could reflect environmental conditions\n(e.g., crowding and inadequate nutrition) associated with lower\nsocioeconomic status and conducive to HHV-8 transmission\nby as-yet-undefined mechanisms [36]. HHV-8 is transmitted\nwithin families in areas of high endemicity [37], and such trans-\nmission might occur in the United States as well.\nEach HHV-8 assay separately yielded an overall estimate of\n1.5%\u00ad1.6% seroprevalence in US adults and, considering the\npresence of antibodies on either assay to indicate infection,\nprovided an upper estimate of 2.5%. Although the presence of\nantibody to HHV-8 might thus appear to be somewhat un-\ncommon, we are reluctant to emphasize this result as an es-\ntimate of the prevalence of HHV-8 infection among US adults.\nA general limitation of studies of the epidemiology of HHV-8\nis the lack of a standard serological assay for infection. We\ndeliberately chose cutoffs for the EIAs that yielded a high pre-\ndictive value for positive results. In the end, this approach was\nsupported by the demonstration of clear associations of K8.1\nantibody results with demographic and sexual risk factors. Also,\nalthough the results with the ORF73 EIA were less definitive,\nthe level of agreement between the 2 assays appeared to be\nreasonable ( ). However, our approach to standardizing\noptical density measurements across plates has not been vali-\ndated, and we could have underestimated the prevalence of\ninfection. A sensitivity analysis using an alternative approach\nfor determining seropositivity, with our previous cutoffs,\nyielded substantially higher seroprevalence estimates. However,\nwe did not rely on this analysis, because it did not fully account\nfor the observed plate-to-plate variability in EIA results and\nbecause the specificity (and thus the false-positive rate) was\nuncertain.\nAn additional limitation is that the seroprevalence estimates\nand associations for some groups (e.g., HCV-infected indi-\nviduals) were based on small numbers of NHANES III sub-\njects. Although the CIs and P values reflect the statistical un-\ncertainty, we caution against overinterpreting these results.\nFinally, NHANES III lacks data on sexual practices, which pre-\nvented us from exploring potential routes of sexual transmis-\nsion in more detail.\nIn conclusion, our study provides population-based epide-\nmiological data about the determinants of HHV-8 serostatus\nin US adults. Our results suggest that HHV-8 infection is in-\ncreased in relation to markers of sexual activity among men.\nAdditional research may further clarify transmission routes,\nwhich would ultimately help the development of interventions\nthat prevent infection.\nReferences\n1.
