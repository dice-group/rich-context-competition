We investigated whether high CRP is related to reduced FVC in MetS and diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined the association of MetS/\ndiabetes and CRP (normal 3 mg/l, high 3 mg/l) with predicted FVC in 4,272 nonsmoking\nU.S. adults aged 18\u00ad79 years without lung disease in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey. Logistic regression examined odds of FVC 80% by CRP and MetS/\ndiabetes.\nRESULTS -- Mean FVC in individuals with MetS and high CRP (95.7%) and those with\ndiabetes and high CRP (93.7%) was lower than in those with no MetS/diabetes and normal CRP\ncompared with those with no MetS/diabetes and normal CRP.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Elevated CRP is associated with lower FVC in people with MetS.\nCross-sectional (1,2) and prospective\n(3) studies have demonstrated im-\npaired lung function in individuals\nwith diabetes and metabolic syndrome\n(MetS). Recent studies show that reduced\nlung function may be a precursor of dia-\nbetes (4). People with reduced lung func-\ntion have greater levels of inflammation\n(5), and people with diabetes or MetS\n(6,7), including those with elevated C-re-\nactive protein (CRP) (8), are at increased\nrisk of cardiovascular disease. Although\nthe interplay among MetS, diabetes, and\ninsulin resistance has been thoroughly in-\nvestigated and extensively published,\ntheir role in systemic inflammation and\nlung function impairment has not been\nfirmly established. We examined whether\nincreased levels of CRP may help identify\nlung function impairment in individuals\nwith MetS/diabetes.\nMETHODS -- Using data from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nmillion, 59.7% female) with available\nforced vital capacity (FVC) data, who\nwere nonsmokers, absent of pulmonary\nobstructions, and without known pulmo-\nnary disease. Spirometric data were ob-\ntained using a spirometry system\nof the National Institute for Occupational\nSafety and Health (NIOSH) and American\nThoracic Society (ATS). Predicted FVC\nwas calculated using equations developed\nby Hankinson et al. (10). CRP was mea-\nsured using a latex-enhanced nephelom-\netry technique, providing a lowest\ndetectable concentration of 2.1 mg/l. Ad-\nditional details of the NHANES method-\nology have been published (9).\nMetS was defined by the presence of\nat least three of the following: 1) waist\ncircumference 102 cm for men and\n88 cm for women, 2) triglyceride level\n150 mg/dl if fasting, 3) HDL cholesterol\nmmHg or on antihypertensive medica-\ntions, and 5) fasting glucose level 100\u00ad\nestablished criteria (11). Diabetes was de-\nfined by a fasting glucose 126 mg/dl (or\n200 mg/dl if nonfasting), taking oral di-\nabetes medication or insulin, or self-\nreport. CRP cut points were defined as\nnormal (3 mg/l) or high (3 mg/l)\nbased on established recommendations\nThe 2 test of proportions or ANOVA\nwas used to compare baseline character-\nistics among FVC groups. Multivariable\nlogistic regression was used to examine\nthe likelihood of decreased FVC (80%\nof predicted) in those with MetS or diabe-\ntes by CRP group compared with those\nwith neither of these conditions and low\nCRP, adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity.\nSAS version 9.1.3 (SAS institute, Cary,\nNC) and SUDAAN version 9.0.1 (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Trian-\ngle Park, NC) were used for analysis and\ncomputation of weighted estimates for\nprojection to the U.S. population.\nRESULTS -- Individuals in FVC quar-\ntile 1 (lowest FVC) exhibited the highest\nCRP levels (P  0.01). Additionally, indi-\nviduals in FVC quartile 1 had higher trig-\nlycerides, glucose, systolic blood\npressure, and HDL cholesterol than those\nin FVC quartile 4 (highest FVC) (P \n0.05). Prevalence of MetS was highest\namong individuals in FVC quartile 1\n                                                \nFrom the 1Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine,\nCalifornia; and the 2Heart Disease Prevention Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine,\nUniversity of California, Irvine, California.\nCorresponding author: Hwa Mu Lee, hwamuleemd@sbcglobal.net.\n\u00a9 2008 by the American Diabetes Association.

Those with diabe-\ntes, regardless of CRP level, had higher\nodds of FVC 80% than those with no\nMetS/diabetes and normal CRP (3.57\nCONCLUSIONS -- We demonstrate\nthat elevated CRP is associated with re-\nduced FVC in individuals with MetS.\nThose with elevated CRP have an approx-\nimate threefold greater likelihood of low\nFVC than those with normal CRP. Indi-\nviduals with diabetes appear to have re-\nduced FVC regardless of CRP level.\nHowever, individuals with MetS and ele-\nvated CRP appear to have odds of reduced\nFVC similar to those of individuals with\ndiabetes, suggesting that CRP measure-\nment may aid in stratification of risk for\nlow FVC in individuals with MetS.\nRecent prospective studies suggest\nreduced FVC to be a precursor of dia-\nbetes and MetS (5). It is not clear why\nreduced FVC occurs in people with di-\nabetes and MetS, although several pos-\nsible explanations have been suggested.\nFirst, in studies involving the alteration\nin alveolar wall and capillaries, with\nsubsequent lung elastic recoil and car-\nbon monoxide diffusion tests, there\nwere no significant differences between\ninsulin-dependent subjects with diabe-\ntes and healthy nonsmokers (13); how-\never, other studies show a relationship\n(14). Second, while hypoxemia could\nreduce FVC in diabetes and MetS,\nmildly reduced FVC is unlikely to be\nassociated with significant hypoxemia\n(5). Third, inflammation has been\nshown to promote impaired lung func-\ntion. CRP is an acute-phase protein that\nis produced by the liver under the influ-\nence of cytokines. These cytokines are\nproduced at several extrahepatic sites,\nincluding the heart, vessel wall, and ad-\nipose tissues. Increased CRP levels have\nbeen described in people with diabetes,\nMetS, obesity, and inflammation (15).\nLimitations of this study include its\ncross-sectional design; it is uncertain\nwhether the inflammatory process actu-\nally led to reduced FVC in those with\nMetS and diabetes. An important strength\nis the large sample and weighting, allow-\ning findings to be generalized to the U.S.\nadult population. Moreover, the stan-\ndardized measurement of lung function\nand other laboratory measurements, in-\ncluding CRP, lipids, and blood pressure,\nenabled accurate classification of individ-\nuals with MetS and diabetes.\nOur study demonstrates that individ-\nuals with MetS and elevated CRP levels, in\nparticular, may have a further increased\nlikelihood of low FVC, which may further\ncontribute to increased cardiovascular\ndisease risk beyond what MetS and CRP\nmay individually confer. This suggests\nthat CRP may be useful in risk stratifica-\ntion for pulmonary disease in people with\nMetS. Longitudinal studies are needed to\nconfirm the prognostic significance of our\nfindings.\n"
