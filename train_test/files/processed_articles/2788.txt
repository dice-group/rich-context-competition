Rogers3\n Introduction\nBoth cigarette smoking and teen childbearing are considered urgent contemporary\nhealth issues in US society and other countries around the world. Despite recent\ndeclines, compared to peer countries (Sedgh et al. 2015), the United States has a\net al. 2017). In high-income nations, smoking is the largest cause of premature mortality\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008; Rogers et al. 2005), and \"smoking\nduring pregnancy is considered the largest preventable cause of fetal and infant ill\nhealth and death\" (Delpisheh, Brabin, and Brabin 2006: 389). Smoking typically begins\nin late adolescence: Cigarette use in the past month increased from just 4.0% among 15-\nHealth Statistics and Quality 2016). Given the public health concerns around teen\npregnancy and cigarette smoking and calls for research on their association (e.g.,\nMcDermott and Graham 2006), it is surprising that relatively little research has been\nconducted. Our study addresses that gap by estimating the relationship between teen\nchildbearing and subsequent daily smoking.\nAs with other potential consequences of teen parenthood, smoking's relationship\nto teen childbearing may be substantially complicated by selection processes and\nheterogeneity of effects. We seek to fill gaps in the literature by unpacking these\nprocesses. Preexisting social disadvantages based on characteristics such as socio-\neconomic status, race/ethnicity, and geographic location shape young women's\nselection into both teen childbearing (Erdmans and Black 2015; Furstenberg 2003;\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 621\nPampel, and Mollborn 2014). In other words, young women who become smokers and\nthose who become teen mothers are not evenly distributed throughout the population,\nand in many cases they disproportionately come from the same segments of the\npopulation. Because teen motherhood and smoking are strongly related to social\ndisadvantage, they are likely associated with each other in ways that may not be causal.\nFurthermore, there may be heterogeneity in the relationship between teen childbearing\nand subsequent smoking, with different associations for different groups. This study\nfocuses on race/ethnicity as a source of heterogeneity because it is strongly associated\nwith both teen motherhood and smoking in complex ways (Dennis and Mollborn 2013;\nUsing nationally representative survey data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) that followed US teens until their late\ntwenties or early thirties, this study estimates the relationship between teen childbearing\nand daily cigarette smoking at multiple points in the early life course. Because they\nrepresent a smaller proportion of the population than teen mothers and are less likely to\nlive with their children (Mollborn and Lovegrove 2011), teen fathers are a distinct and\nhard-to-reach population that may have different smoking implications and that is not\nstudied here. Our longitudinal data allows us to generalize findings to a recent US\ncohort and to establish time order between teen childbearing and daily smoking. We\nassess the roles of specific selection processes, explore potential mediators of the\nrelationship between teen motherhood and smoking, and investigate racial/ethnic\nheterogeneity in these relationships and processes. Each of these goals is a new\ncontribution to the literature. Understanding not only how teen motherhood and\nsmoking are related to each other, but the extent to which those relationships may be\ndriven by selection and how heterogeneous they are across different groups is important\nfor social policy. If the two phenomena are potentially causally related at least in some\ngroups, then policy efforts to reduce one might also ameliorate the other.\nOur goal is to disentangle the potentially complicated interplay between teen\nchildbearing and smoking by examining their relationship at different time points, the\nrole of selection, potential mediators, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity in each of these\nphenomena. We explore four primary research questions, based on our conceptual\nmodel shown in Figure 1.\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n622 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 1: Conceptual model\n1. Does teen childbearing predict daily smoking in young adulthood in a nationally\nrepresentative longitudinal study of women (Figure 1, path D)?\n2. If teen childbearing is associated with subsequent smoking, is this relationship\nexplained by the selection of socially disadvantaged teens into smoking and teen\nchildbearing (paths A\u00adC)?\n3. After accounting for selection processes, do socioeconomic status and depression\nin young adulthood mediate any remaining relationship between teen childbearing\nand subsequent daily smoking (paths D\u00adF)?\n4. Are there racial/ethnic differences in the association between teen childbearing and\nsubsequent smoking or in its selection and mediation processes?\n2. Background\n2.1 Teen motherhood and cigarette smoking\nUS teen childbearing rates peaked in the 1950s, but teen motherhood emerged as a\nperceived social problem in later decades as most teen births became nonmarital\n(Furstenberg 2003). A large, longstanding literature has examined the consequences of\nteen childbearing for a variety of short- and long-term life outcomes (e.g., Taylor 2009).\nSome influential studies have found that the documented negative consequences of teen\nchildbearing are mostly or entirely due to the selection of disadvantaged girls into early\nWave I\ndaily smoking\nPreexisting social\ndisadvantage\nTeen childbearing Wave IV\ndaily smoking\nRacial/ethnic\ndifferences\ndepression\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nB\nF\nB\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 623\nresearchers now attribute modest negative effects to teen motherhood (Fletcher and\nWolfe 2009; Kane et al. 2013), with heterogeneity in these effects for different groups\nHere, we consider the medium-term outcome of daily smoking in young adulthood\n(Figure 1, path D). Research on the relationship between teen childbearing and later\nsmoking is sparse. Teen mothers-to-be have higher rates of prenatal smoking than most\neven though they are disproportionately likely to quit smoking while pregnant (Colman\nand Joyce 2003; Curtin and Mathews 2016). White US teen mothers had a particularly\nAmerican and 11% for Hispanic teen mothers (Dennis and Mollborn 2013). White teen\nmothers' high levels of smoking partially explained their children's elevated risk for\nlow birthweight compared to children of older White mothers (Dennis and Mollborn\n2013). After childbearing, evidence from the United Kingdom and Australia suggests\nthat teen mothers have an increased likelihood of smoking (Graham et al. 2006;\nWebbink, Martin, and Visscher 2008). Young mothers in a high-risk New York sample\nwere more likely to be current smokers than those who were childless (Stueve and\nO'Donnell 2007). Teen mothers are more likely than older women to resume smoking\nafter childbirth (Colman and Joyce 2003), making the otherwise protective effect of\nchildbearing weaker for this group.\n2.2 Selection into smoking and teen childbearing\nAny relationship between teen childbearing and smoking may be caused by preexisting\nsocial disadvantages underlying both behaviors (Figure 1, paths A\u00adC). By comparing\npregnant teens who miscarried with those who gave birth, as well as estimating family\nfixed effects, Fletcher (2011) found that such selection processes accounted for the\ninitial relationships between teen motherhood and smoking in the short and long term.\nThree selection factors that may be particularly important for explaining observed\nassociations between teen childbearing and smoking are preexisting social class,\ndepression, and preexisting smoking. Cumulative social class across childhood predicts\nprenatal smoking among women (Spencer 2006), as well as teen childbearing\n(Quinlivan et al. 2004). Depression is related to smoking before pregnancy (Graham et\nal. 2006; Hanna, Faden, and Dufour 1994), and among severely depressed girls living in\npoverty it also predicts teen childbearing (Mollborn and Morningstar 2009). Teen\npregnancy is part of a constellation of related adolescent risk behaviors that may have\nimplications for its relationship with smoking. Because they have often experienced\nearly sexual intercourse, many teenage parents are expected to evidence a \"syndrome of\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n624 http://www.demographic-research.org\nproblem behavior\" predicted by social disadvantage, being more likely than other\nadolescents to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as problematic alcohol use,\nmarijuana use, and delinquency (Donovan, Jessor, and Costa 1988). Thus, because of\nsocial disadvantage underlying both behaviors, girls who have teen births may have\nalready been more likely to smoke. In a high-risk local urban sample, women who had\nbecome mothers by about age 20 were more likely to have smoked in the past (Stueve\nand O'Donnell 2007). Evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that teen\nchildbearing can compound smoking risk stemming from earlier childhood\ndisadvantages (Graham, Hawkins, and Law 2010), which implies a blend of selection\nand causality.\n2.3 Explanations for a relationship between teen childbearing and smoking\nIf selection processes do not fully account for the relationship between teen\nchildbearing and subsequent smoking, what potential mediators could explain this\nassociation (Figure 1, paths D\u00adF)? Teen motherhood is a stigmatized and stress-\ninducing experience for many reasons, including the violation of age norms, potential\ndisruption to human capital formation, its association with depression, and the stress of\nmotherhood more generally (Falci, Mortimer, and Noel 2010; Kane et al. 2013; Larson\n2004). Cigarette smoking is a known strategy for coping with stress that tends to be\nclassed and raced (Chassin et al. 1996; Lawrence et al. 2014). In a small qualitative\nstudy of teen mothers, Lawson (1994) found that a majority had already begun smoking\nbetween 10 and 11 years old. They reported reasons why they continued smoking\nduring and after pregnancy, perceiving that the short-term benefits of smoking, such as\nrelief from anxiety and weight control after childbearing, outweighed longer-term\nhealth risks.\nThe survey we analyze cannot assess these potential mediators, but we do evaluate\nothers. We focus on two prevalent phenomena among teen mothers (see above) that\nmay increase subsequent smoking, possibly mediating any relationship between teen\nchildbearing and subsequent smoking: low socioeconomic status attainment and\nelevated depression symptoms. We argue that teen childbearing may elevate depression\nand reduce socioeconomic attainment (path E), which could in turn increase the\nlikelihood of daily smoking (path F), explaining why teen childbearing predicts daily\nsmoking (path D). The relationships between teen childbearing and both depression and\nreduced socioeconomic attainment have been well studied and are described above.\nPrenatal smoking is more prevalent among women who have lower levels of education\nand income and those who have mood disorders (Erlingsdottir et al. 2014; Gilman et al.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 625\n2012; Zimmer and Zimmer 1998). In adulthood, less educated people are less likely to\n2.4 Racial/ethnic heterogeneity in relationships between teen childbearing and\nsmoking\nWomen's cigarette smoking is patterned by race/ethnicity. White women begin\nsmoking at younger ages than Black women (Geronimus, Neidert, and Bound 1993;\nMoon-Howard 2003) but are more likely to quit and do so at younger ages (Geronimus,\nLawrence and colleagues (2014) found that among African Americans, smoking rates\nstarted low but increased with age, resulting in the highest smoking rates of any racial\ngroup by their early thirties. There was an inverse U-shaped relationship between\nsmoking and age for White, Asian American, and Hispanic respondents, with smoking\nrates increasing throughout adolescence and peaking in their mid-twenties. The age-\nrelated increase and decrease around this peak were particularly sharp for Whites (Chen\nand Jacobson 2012), and analyses of other data have found that this cessation among\nWhites is the main explanation for racial convergence in smoking prevalence over the\nFertility complicates racialized smoking uptake and cessation patterns. A greater\nproportion of White women smoke during pregnancy compared to Black women\nwithin-family comparisons, Geronimus and Korenman (1993) found suggestive\nevidence that White teen mothers were more likely than their sisters to smoke during\npregnancy, but the same was not true for African American teen mothers. Although\nchildbearing generally lowers the likelihood of subsequent smoking (Pampel, Mollborn,\nand Lawrence 2014; Staff et al. 2010), this is likely not true for African American teen\nmothers, as their smoking rates continue to increase throughout their twenties and\nthirties after they have given birth. Unlike other groups, African American women who\nstart smoking in adulthood are not more likely to stop smoking than those who started\nin their teens (Thompson, Moon-Howard, and Messeri 2011).\nTeen childbearing is heavily patterned by race/ethnicity. Teen birth rates are\nconsiderably higher among Hispanics and African Americans than among Whites, at\n2017). Thus, because they represent a smaller and more disadvantaged proportion of the\nWhite population, White teen mothers are a more selected, atypical subpopulation than\nare Hispanic or Black teen mothers. Information on the role of race/ethnicity for the\nconsequences of teen childbearing is limited. Mollborn (2010) found that race/ethnicity\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n626 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndid not predict high school completion among US teen mothers and fathers. In contrast,\nWilliams and associates (2015) identified negative implications of teen birth for self-\nrated health at midlife compared to giving birth after age 25 for Black but not for White\nor Hispanic women. Because it structures both teen childbearing and smoking,\nrace/ethnicity may be a source of heterogeneity in their relationship.\nWe capitalize on the longitudinal, nationally representative Add Health data to observe\ndaily smoking before pregnancy and into young adulthood, several years after a teen\nbirth. The core relationship we estimate is between teen childbearing and the odds of\ndaily smoking in young adulthood. To answer the research questions, we estimate the\ninfluence of selection processes on this relationship, test for mediation of the adjusted\nrelationship by socioeconomic attainment and depression symptoms, and examine\nwhether all these relationships differ by the teen mother's race/ethnicity. Addressing\nthese goals requires longitudinal survey data following a large sample of young women\nover time, from before to well after the experience of teen childbearing, and comparing\nthem to peers who did not experience a teen birth.\n3. Methods\nWe investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking in young adulthood and\nexperiences of teenage motherhood using data from Add Health (Harris et al. 2009), a\nnationally representative survey of US adolescents. Add Health collected data on a\nvariety of health-related subjects throughout four waves (wave 1 from September 1994\nrepresent US schools in regard to region of county, urbanicity, size, type, and ethnicity.\nMore than 70% of these schools participated in the study, and schools that refused to\nparticipate were replaced by schools within the same community. A subsample of\nstudents in each school and their primary parent (typically the mother) completed an\ninterview. Students were followed up for additional interviews in the next three waves\n(graduating seniors and some others were not re-interviewed at wave 2). Some\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 627\npopulations were oversampled, yet sampling weights, region, and school identifier\nallow researchers to represent the national population of adolescents.\nFor this study, we mainly used data from waves 1 and 4. Wave 4 data is the most\nrecent information on the study participants, who were settling into young adulthood\n(ages 24 to 32) at the time of the interview. We used it to measure our outcome variable\n(daily smoking in young adulthood), as well as respondents' characteristics in young\nadulthood that may mediate the relationship between teen motherhood and the\nlikelihood of smoking in young adulthood. Wave 1 data provide information on the\nrespondents' teenage years (grades 7 through 12), including their family backgrounds.\nWe used this data for our selection variables, which may generate a spurious\nrelationship between teenage motherhood and smoking in young adulthood. We used\nwave 2 and 3 data only to measure daily smoking, which was needed for descriptive\nanalyses of smoking across the four waves but was not used in multivariate models.\nOur sample was limited to women, identified using respondents' reports of\nbiological sex in waves 1 and 4. Among them, 7,874 respondents who participated in\nWaves 1 and 4 and who were not missing sampling weights, region, or school identifier\nwere eligible for analysis. We omitted those who gave birth before or were pregnant at\nwave 1 to establish time order between smoking at wave 1 and teen childbearing,\nused all analysis variables to impute missing values on independent and dependent\nvariables, which retains all cases, reduces bias resulting from listwise deletion of\nmissing cases, and produces unbiased estimates (Schafer 1999; Sterne et al. 2009).\nMissing values were imputed by the `mi impute chained' command, and all analyses\nwere conducted using Stata statistical software (StataCorp 2011).5\n4 Among the 345 respondents who were excluded from analysis because of pregnancy or childbirth prior to\n5 Of the variables used for the 20 imputed datasets, wave 1 household income (24.9%), nativity (19.8%), and\nGPA (16.2%) had the highest percent of missing information among the eligible cases. Sensitivity analyses\nthat compare imputed to nonimputed results did not show substantive differences in conclusions drawn, with\nthe exception of racial/ethnic heterogeneity in selection and mediation processes. Compared to imputed\nanalyses, nonimputed analyses showed similar results among Black women, a greater association between\nteen childbearing and subsequent smoking that was mediated by achieved income among Hispanic women,\nand the disappearance of the significant association between teen childbearing and subsequent smoking once\nselection variables were included in the model among White women.\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n628 http://www.demographic-research.org\nGiven the high prevalence of social smokers among adolescents and young adults, who\nsmoke occasionally in certain social settings (Schane, Glantz, and Ling 2009; Song and\nLing 2011), we focused our analyses on daily smokers, who may be at greater health\nrisks than social smokers. Studies categorize current smokers into daily and intermittent\nsmokers and define intermittent smokers as those who smoke \"some days\" (Lindstr\u00f6m\n2003; Trinidad et al. 2009). Although intermittent smoking can be a chronic pattern of\ncigarette use, it is also perceived as a transitional phase (from nonsmoking to daily\nsmoking and vice versa; Berg et al. 2013). Adolescent and young adult intermittent\nsmokers tend to be experimental or social smokers and may not transition to daily\nsmokers (Wetter et al. 2004). Daily smokers, on the other hand, may have established\ntheir smoking habits and are less likely to quit, thus drawing greater attention for health\ninterventions.\nWe defined daily smokers using respondents' self-reports of smoking during the\npast 30 days. At wave 4, an initial question asked respondents whether they had ever\nsmoked an entire cigarette. Those answering `yes' were then asked how many days\nduring the past 30 days they had smoked. Our study classified those answering 30 days\nas daily smokers (coded 1), while non-daily smokers were those who either had never\nsmoked an entire cigarette or smoked during fewer than 30 days in the past month. For\nWe defined a teen mother as a woman who had her first child before the month of her\ntwentieth birthday. Using wave 4 retrospective fertility histories (the recommended\nsource of fertility information in Add Health), we subtracted each respondent's birth\nmonth and year from the pregnancy end date to measure the mother's age at her first\nbirth. We dropped two women who reported giving birth before age 11, so the sample's\nwomen had a live birth, with 1,002 teen mothers and 3,012 adult mothers who gave\nbirth after age 20. The other 3,515 women had not given birth by wave 4.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 629\n3.2.3 Sociodemographic variables\nWe chose all independent variables (demographic characteristics, selection factors,\nwave 1 smoking, and mediators) because of their possible relationships to smoking or\nteenage motherhood. Multicollinearity among the variables was not a concern in the\nmodels. As a control, respondents' age at wave 1 was calculated by subtracting their\nbirth month and year from the wave 1 interview date. We measured respondents'\nrace/ethnicity, a potential source of heterogeneity, by four categories: Hispanic, non-\nHispanic White, Black, and other race. We combined American Indian/Alaska Native\nand Asian/Pacific Islander as \"other race\" and excluded them from the analysis of\nracial/ethnic comparisons due to their small sample size of teen mothers. Respondents'\nnativity was coded from a question asking if they had been born in the United States\n(US-born = 1; foreign-born = 0).\nWe included several selection variables, all measured at wave 1. First, student-\nreported grade point average (GPA) for four subjects was averaged into a four-point\nscale (D or lower = 1, C = 2, B = 3, A = 4) and recoded into a series of indicator\nvariables (less than 3, 3 to 3.49, and 3.5 or more). Family socioeconomic status was\nmeasured by parents' education and parent-reported household income. We recoded\nparent reports of earned degrees into approximate years of education.6 The highest\neducation levels of the mother and her spouse/partner were averaged. If the spouse's\neducation was missing from the parent report, we substituted the adolescent\nrespondent's report of his education level. Lacking that, the mother's education was\nused for both. If no parent completed the survey, the adolescent respondent's report of\nboth parents' education levels was substituted. Cubbin and associates (2005) found\n75% agreement between parents' and adolescents' reports of parental education levels\nwhen data for both were available. Following Cubbin et al. (2005), we adjusted for the\nnumber of people in the household to create an indicator variable that represents parent-\nreported household income as a percentage of 1994 federal poverty thresholds (0 to\nstructure was coded into a series of indicator variables after Harris (1999): living with\nboth biological parents, other types of two-parent families, a single mother, a single\nfather, and other family structures. Religious service attendance was measured by\nfrequency and coded into a series of indicator variables (never/no religion, less than\n6 This variable was coded as: 8th grade or less = 8 years, some high school = 10, high school graduate = 12,\nsome vocational/technical training (after high school) = 12.5, completed vocational/technical training (after\nhigh school) = 13, some college = 14, completed college (bachelor's degree) = 16, some graduate school =\n17, completed a master's degree = 18, some graduate training beyond a master's degree = 19, completed a\ndoctoral degree = 20, some post baccalaureate professional education (e.g., law school, med school, nurse) =\n19, and completed post baccalaureate professional education (e.g., law school, med school, nurse) = 20 years.\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n630 http://www.demographic-research.org\nonce a month, once a month or more but less than once a week, and at least once a\nweek).\nWe also measured respondents' wave 1 levels of depression symptoms and\ndelinquency. The measure of depression symptoms used a subset of questions from the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff 1977).\nRespondents were asked 19 questions about how often they had particular feelings in\nthe past week (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = a lot of the time, 3 = most or all\nof the time), and the average of the 19 questions was used as a depression symptoms\nscale at wave 1 (alpha scale reliability coefficient = 0.91). In addition, respondents were\nasked 15 questions about how often they engaged in delinquent acts (0 = never, 1 = one\nor two times, 2 = three or four times, 3 = five or more times). The delinquency scale\nrepresents the respondents' averaged answers to the 19 questions after reverse coding\npositive items (alpha scale reliability coefficient = 0.84). Because the depression and\ndelinquency scales were highly skewed, we logged both scales after adding 1. Lastly,\nwe included a dichotomous indicator of respondents' reports of having ever had vaginal\nintercourse by wave 1. Because women who were pregnant were excluded from the\nsample, this was preexisting sexual activity that could not have led to the teen birth.\nRespondents' daily smoking status at wave 1 was another selection measure. Since\nwe excluded respondents who gave birth before or were pregnant at wave 1, daily\nsmokers at wave 1 would have started smoking before they became pregnant. In wave\n1, the initial question asked respondents if they had ever tried cigarette smoking, even\njust one or two puffs. Those who had tried smoking and smoked 30 days in the past\nmonth were categorized as daily smokers (1), whereas those who had never tried\nsmoking, never smoked an entire cigarette, or smoked less than 30 days in the past\nmonth were coded as 0.\nFor descriptive analysis of smoking of each racial/ethnic group over time, daily\nsmoking in waves 2 and 3 was also measured. Wave 2 smoking measures were different\nfrom the other three waves, as respondents were asked about their smoking activity\nsince the month of the wave 1 interview. We defined daily smokers as those who\nreported having tried smoking since the last interview (wave 1) and smoking 30 days in\nthe last month. At wave 3, we defined daily smokers as those who reported having\nsmoked an entire cigarette and smoking 30 days during the past month.\nRespondents' socioeconomic status attainment (education attainment, income, and\nhome ownership) and levels of depression symptoms, measured at wave 4, were\nconsidered potential mediators of the relationship between smoking and teenage\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 631\nmotherhood. Teen childbearing has been shown to compromise mental health and\neducational and other socioeconomic attainment (see above), which may in turn\nincrease smoking. Each respondent's highest level of education achieved was recoded\ninto approximate years from a categorical measure (earned degrees, recoded as in wave\n1). Wave 4 household income is coded as a percent of the 1997 federal poverty\nthresholds, adjusting for household size (recoded as in wave 1). We measured home\nownership by a dichotomous indicator of whether the respondent's house, apartment, or\nresidence is owned by themselves or their partner versus not. For the modified CES-D\ndepression symptoms scale at wave 4, respondents were asked 10 questions about how\noften they had particular feelings in the past week (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes,\n2 = a lot of the times, 3 = most of the time or all of the time), and we averaged their\nresponses after reverse coding positive items (alpha scale reliability coefficient = 0.84).\nAll analyses accounted for clustering and stratification in the survey design and used\nAdd Health's longitudinal probability weights to produce nationally representative\nfindings assessing the model laid out in Figure 1. First, we calculated means for all\nvariables used in analysis, comparing wave 4 daily smokers and others. Next, we\nestimated binary logistic regression models to examine the relationship between teenage\nmotherhood and the likelihood of daily smoking at wave 4, controlling for other\nvariables and comparing teen mothers to all other women. Supplemental models, which\nseparated the comparison group into nonmothers at wave 4 (the group least likely to\nsmoke) and mothers whose first birth occurred after their teenage years, did not produce\nsubstantively different conclusions, except for some specific changes to significance\nlevels in models disaggregated by race/ethnicity. The baseline model compared the\nlikelihood of daily smoking for teen mothers and all other women, controlling for\nrespondents' demographic characteristics, such as age, race/ethnicity, and nativity.\nNext, we added selection variables (model 2) and daily smoking at wave 1 (model 3) to\ntease out selection processes surrounding teen childbearing and smoking. Model 4\nadded potential mediators of the relationship between teenage motherhood and the\nlikelihood of daily smoking in early adulthood (mediation tests were conducted using\nthe logic laid out by Baron and Kenny 1986). Subsequent models included the 7,036\nwomen in the sample who were Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black or White. We\nintroduced interactions into the full model (model 4) to investigate whether the\nrelationship between teenage motherhood and smoking differed across racial/ethnic\ngroups. We also examined the smoking trajectories of teen mothers versus all other\nwomen, aggregated by racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n632 http://www.demographic-research.org\nand Hispanic), to better understand the interaction effects. All analyses used Stata's\ncomplex survey design commands (StataCorp 2011). We present odds ratios, or\nexponentiated coefficients, for the logistic regression models.\n4. Results\n4.1 Associations between teen childbearing and smoking\nTable 1 reveals that teen childbearing and subsequent wave 4 daily smoking are\nstrongly related (path D in Figure 1). Teen mothers made up 21% of daily smokers at\nwave 4, compared to 11% of nonsmokers and 14% of the overall sample. Table 2,\nmodel 1 estimated this relationship after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and nativity.\nBecoming a teen mother before wave 4 was associated with 1.5 times higher odds of\nsmoking at wave 4 compared to other women (odds ratio = 2.53).\n4.2 Selection processes\nTable 1 shows that sociodemographic factors (such as socioeconomic status, family\nstructure, and academic achievement) shaped the selection of women into wave 4\nsmoking status (Figure 1, path C). Supplemental descriptive analyses found similar\nselection processes for wave 1 daily smoking and teen childbearing as well (paths A\nand B). Table 2, model 2 adjusts for various selection factors predating teen mothers'\npregnancies, including academic achievement, family socioeconomic status, family\nstructure, religious attendance, depression symptoms, delinquency, and past sexual\nactivity. Including these covariates reduced the association between teen childbearing\nand later smoking (path D) by nearly two-thirds to 0.6 times higher odds of smoking\namong teen mothers (odds ratio = 1.57), but it was still significant. Another important\nselection factor potentially underlying teen childbearing and wave 4 daily smoking was\nwave 1 daily smoking. Adjusting for this measure in model 3 further attenuated teen\nmothers' likelihood of smoking to 1.47 times as high as other women's. Thus, the\nselection processes measured in this study accounted for most but not all of the\nrelationship between teen childbearing and subsequent smoking.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 633\nTable 1: Weighted means for variables used in analyzing daily smoking and\nteenage motherhood\nWave 4 smoker\nWave 4 nonsmoker\nDifference\nDemographic characteristics\nRace\nSelection factors (wave 1)\nGrade point average\nHousehold poverty status (% FPL)\nFamily structure\nReligious service attendance\nMediators (wave 4)\nHousehold income (% FPL)\nSource: National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995).\nNote: Reference categories are indicated with * next to variable names.

In testing for mediation using the criteria outlined by\nBaron and Kenny (1986), we found that educational attainment and income-to-needs\nratio together mediated the teen childbearing-daily smoking relationship in path D.\nSupplemental models showed that teen childbearing did not significantly predict home\nownership or depression symptoms (path E), so they did not qualify as mediators. In a\nsupplemental model in which only education and income were included as mediators,\nthe teen childbearing odds ratio was 1.14 and was not statistically significant. Thus,\neducation and income were the mediators that explained why teen childbearing was\npositively related to subsequent smoking: Teen childbearing predicted reduced\nsubsequent household income and educational attainment, which were associated with\nan increased likelihood of daily smoking.\n4.4 Racial/ethnic heterogeneity in processes\nThe proportion of teen mothers varied across racial/ethnic groups: 11.3% of White\nteen mothers. Figure 2 shows considerable racial/ethnic variation in the unadjusted\nrelationship between teen childbearing and daily smoking across adolescence and\nyoung adulthood. The figure reports smoking prevalence at each wave of the survey for\nteen mothers and other women. Wave 1 prevalence predated teen pregnancies in the\nsample, so it illustrates the selection of daily smokers into teen childbearing. This\nselection was substantial among White women, with 26.4% of future teen mothers\nsmoking compared to 12.7% of other women. This was true to a lesser extent for\nHispanics at 7.8% and 3.1% respectively, but there were no differences between Black\nfuture teen mothers and other Black women. Disparities in smoking between teen\nmothers and other women widened with age for White women, particularly between\nwave 3 (after nearly all women had become teen mothers) and wave 4. Between these\nwaves, White teen mothers' smoking prevalence held steady, while it decreased for\nother White women. This widening also occurred for Hispanics, but it happened\nprimarily between waves 2 and 3 (the period during which most of the teen births\noccurred for all racial/ethnic groups). There was little difference in smoking between\nBlack teen mothers and other Black women at any wave.\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n636 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 2: Smoking prevalence among respondents by teen mother status,\ndisaggregated by race/ethnicity\na) White respondents\nb) Black respondents\nc) Hispanic respondents\nSource: National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995).\nNote: Analyses account for sample design effects (weighting, stratification, and clustering).\nTeen mom Other women\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 637\nAt all waves, there were large racial/ethnic differences in smoking prevalence,\nwith the highest among Whites, the lowest among African Americans, and Hispanics in\nbetween. By wave 4, 47.1% of White teen mothers were daily smokers, compared to\n19.8% for Hispanic teen mothers and 10.9% for Black teen mothers. Thus, even White\nwomen who never became teen mothers still had a smoking prevalence (23.2%) that\nwas higher than any group of Black or Hispanic women.\nGiven the racial/ethnic differences in the gaps in smoking prevalence between teen\nmothers and others portrayed in Figure 1, it is perhaps unsurprising that Table 2, model\n5 identified significant differences by race/ethnicity in the relationship between teen\nmotherhood status and the likelihood of later smoking (Figure 1, path D). To explore\nracial/ethnic differences in selection and mediation processes, Table 3 presents the same\nfirst four models as Table 2 but disaggregated by race/ethnicity for White, Black, and\nHispanic women. There was no significant relationship between teen childbearing and\nsmoking among Black women in any model. Only for White women was there a\nsignificant relationship between teen motherhood and wave 4 smoking at the p<.05\nlevel after controlling for social background in model 2. For Hispanics, this relationship\nwas larger in magnitude than for White women (an odds ratio of 1.94 compared to 1.68)\nbut was only significant at the p<.10 level. This marginally significant relationship was\nexplained by the socioeconomic mediators, as it was for White women. Supplementary\nmodels showed that for both Hispanic and White women as in Table 2 for all women,\neducation and income mediated the relationship.\nTable 3: Odds ratios from binary logistic regression models predicting daily\nsmoking at wave 4 by teenage motherhood, disaggregated by\nrace/ethnicity\nSource: National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995).\nNote: DV: daily smoking at wave 4, IV: teenage motherhood, models restricted to each racial/ethnic group. Model 1: controls for\ndemographic characteristics; model 2: controls for demographic characteristics and selection factors; model 3: controls for\ndemographic characteristics, selection factors, and smoking at wave 1; model 4: controls for demographic characteristics, selection\nfactors, smoking at wave 1, and mediators. Analyses account for sample design effects (weighting, stratification, and clustering).\n5. Discussion\nWe found a strong association between teenage childbearing and subsequent daily\nsmoking: Teen mothers were 1.5 times as likely as other women to smoke daily at wave\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n638 http://www.demographic-research.org\n4, controlling for demographic factors and previous smoking. This greater likelihood of\ndaily smoking was due in large part to selection factors. Controlling for academic\nachievement, family structure and socioeconomic status, religiosity, delinquency,\nprevious sexual activity, and preexisting smoking substantially reduced the association\nbetween teen motherhood and subsequent smoking. Achieved socioeconomic status\nmediated the remaining relationship: Teen childbearing reduced women's educational\nattainment and household income, which in turn increased their likelihood of smoking.\nTeen mothers are disadvantaged in part because of lower socioeconomic status and\nriskier behaviors, including smoking. And their smoking during or after pregnancy may\nresult in further disadvantage. Smoking during pregnancy may lead to lower\nbirthweight babies who require more personal and medical care, which may further\nexacerbate the disadvantaged positions of their mothers. Furthermore, parental smoking\ncan expose infants and children to secondhand smoke, which can increase their risk of\ndisease and death (US Department of Health and Human Services 2006). Thus, we have\nidentified one pathway through which socioeconomic and health disadvantage may\naccumulate among young mothers and contribute to the intergenerational transmission\nof poor health: Social disadvantage is associated with becoming a teen mother, which\npredicts lower socioeconomic attainment, which is related to increased risk of smoking,\nwhich can increase the risk of preterm and low weight births and of infant and child\ndisease and mortality. These risky infants and children may require expensive and time\nconsuming medical care and may experience developmental delays that further stress\nthe mother and reduce her educational progress, perpetuating the vicious cycle of\nintergenerational inequality.\nThere were substantial racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between teen\nchildbearing and smoking, as well as in the selection and mediation processes\nunderlying the relationship. Smoking prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic\nWhites and lower among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. It is noteworthy that the\nracially advantaged group had the highest smoking prevalence rate. White teen\nmothers' high smoking prevalence rates may be related to teen mothers in this\nracial/ethnic group being a more highly selected population and also represents a unique\nrisk for this subpopulation. Teenage childbearing did not predict subsequent smoking\namong Black women, was marginally significant and mediated by income and\neducation among Hispanics, and was large, significant, and mediated by education and\nincome among Whites. Although it is important to reduce smoking among all young\nmothers, it may be especially important to reduce smoking among young White\nmothers, even years after childbirth. Gittelsohn and colleagues (2001) studied\nadolescents in Baltimore, finding that compared to African Americans, Whites\nperceived more parental permissiveness toward smoking and were more likely to smoke\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 639\nto fit in with their peers. Thus, antismoking programs could target teens' social\nnetworks, including family members and friends (Christakis and Fowler 2008).\nEffective social and health policies can break the vicious cycle of intergenerational\ninequality. Policy makers can find ways to reduce risky behaviors such as smoking and\nunprotected sex during youth and adolescence; provide school-, community-, and\nclinic-based smoking cessation programs; reduce teenage childbearing; increase\nprenatal care and healthy behaviors during gestation; increase health care access;\nencourage educational attainment among pregnant women and teen mothers; and\nprovide health care and childcare for infants of young mothers. Educational experts\nshould watch for young mothers who are at risk of dropping out of high school or, less\nvisibly, of forgoing college and other advanced levels of educational attainment. Our\nfindings suggest that reducing social disadvantage is a promising policy route. Such a\nreduction may simultaneously decrease rates of teen childbearing and of teen mothers'\nsmoking behaviors, as well as ameliorating the negative socioeconomic consequences\nof teen childbearing.\nAt the larger societal level, social and health policies can address unacceptably\nhigh rates of unintended pregnancies, poverty, and smoking among teenagers.\nCompared to older age groups, US children are more likely to live in poverty, with\npoverty rates of 18.0% for individuals under the age of 18, 11.6% for individuals aged\nKollar 2017). More Americans are now insured due in part to the Affordable Care Act,\nwhich can provide birth control information to teenagers, prenatal care to pregnant\nteens, and care to newborns and their mothers. In fact, the percentage of uninsured\ninterview with the National Health Interview Survey (Cohen, Zammitti, and Martinez\n2017). Thus, changing structural conditions \u00ad including increasing health care access,\nreducing poverty, and improving the quality of schools and neighborhoods \u00ad could\nreduce risky behaviors, including smoking and engaging in risky sex, and thereby\nimprove the quality of life and boost the health of young women and their children.\nSmoking is the top preventable cause of death in high-income countries (Mokdad\net al. 2004; Rogers et al. 2005), and smoking during pregnancy is a top preventable\ncause of fetal and infant mortality (Delpisheh, Brabin, and Brabin 2006). Smoking often\nbegins in adolescence, and young adolescent smokers are more likely to become long-\nterm smokers (Woolf and Aron 2013). Smoking can affect the health of teen mothers\nand their children, and is related to \"low birthweight babies, preterm delivery, fetal\ndeath, stillbirths, reduced lung function in infants, and sudden infant death syndrome\"\ncigarette advertising and smoking depicted in movies, videos, and on television that\nappeal to children and adolescents (Frieden and Blakeman 2005). Some cigarette\nMollborn, Woo & Rogers: Teen childbearing and smoking risk\n640 http://www.demographic-research.org\nadvertising \u00ad including the `Camel No. 9' campaign that RJ Reynolds launched in 2007\n\u00ad is extremely appealing to young girls (Pierce et al. 2010). Because most pregnant\nwomen understand the detrimental effects of smoking on their own and their unborn\nchildren's health, they have added motivation to quit and therefore become prime\ncandidates for smoking cessation programs (Delpisheh, Brabin, and Brabin 2006).\nCompared to other industrialized countries, the United States has relatively low life\nexpectancies and very high rates of teen fertility and such adverse birth outcomes as\nlow birthweight babies, prematurity, and infant mortality (Woolf and Aron 2013).\nInterventions to reduce teen smoking and fertility could contribute to increased life\nexpectancies and close part of the unacceptably high gap between the United States and\nits peer countries.\nOur results highlight the strengths of the Add Health dataset. One innovative\naspect of our analyses is the ability to use multiple waves to obtain smoking\ninformation on teen women before they became pregnant and follow them after they\nbore children. Additional research that builds on our results is merited. For example,\nfuture research could expand upon our analyses by examining data from wave 5, which\nwould follow women longer into adulthood and track smoking patterns.\nBeyond drawbacks arising from being able to definitively establish time order but\nnot causality, this study has three key limitations. First, although we provided detail on\nnon-Hispanic Whites and Blacks and Hispanics for which we had sufficient sample\nsizes, future research could focus on other small but important subpopulations,\nincluding Asians and Native Americans, as well as on teen fathers. Future research\ncould also examine more detail within the racial/ethnic groups we examined, including\ncountry of origin (e.g., comparing Hispanic Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and\nCubans) and nativity. Indeed, we found that compared to the foreign-born population,\nthe native-born population was about twice as likely to smoke by wave 4. Second, we\ncould incorporate other factors that may affect the association between pregnancy and\nsmoking, including relief from anxiety and weight control. Finally, while the Add\nHealth data is current, the results may be affected by historical period. Future research\ncould examine other datasets to see if the results respond to temporal and spatial\nvariations.\nOur findings underscore the importance of better understanding the relationship\nbetween teenage childbirth and subsequent smoking across racial/ethnic groups. Further\nreducing teen pregnancy could concomitantly reduce low weight and premature births\nand smoking among young women. Thus, reducing this cluster of risks could improve\nparticularly vulnerable subpopulations, including infants and teen mothers, who may be\nespecially amenable to health interventions. Moreover, investments in teen mothers and\ninfants may pay long-term future dividends in added person-years of health, which will\nultimately increase the overall health and longevity of the general population.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 641\n6.
