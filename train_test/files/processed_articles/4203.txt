Ludification is usually associated with the\nconstruction of ludic identities and cultural practices in the usage of new media or\nwith application of game elements in nongame contexts known as gamification. This\noverlooks, on the one hand, the influence of cinematic aesthetics on computer\ngames and, on the other hand, the extent to which play aspects and computer game\nelements imprint and transform the narrative compositional structures of modern\ncinema. The present study's investigation will present an expanded conceptualiza-\ntion of ludification, classified by playfulness and gamefulness through interactive/\nnoninteractive properties, aesthetic forms of expressions, and narrative composi-\ntions under the respective headings of gamification and cinemafication.

Exposing and disentangling such intertwined\ninfluences is not without its difficulties. In making the attempt, it is important that\nthe point of departure should be as clear as possible. The current exploration under-\ntakes this task with the aim of branching out and creating a conceptual basis to\ndiscuss how computer games are influenced by cinema and especially how computer\ngames influence the narrative structure of modern cinema. Such an endeavor can be\nseen as an attempt to unpack remediating (Bolter & Grusin, 2000) tie-ins between\nthe mainstream film and game industry (Shaviro, 2010). It should be borne in mind\nthat the film and game industries are drivers of ludification and that the existing\nsynergies between them can be regarded as being subject to the logic of ludification.\nEven though the starting point is relatively straightforward, further clarification\nof the current perception of ludification is needed to fully appreciate the conceptual\nframework presented here. The following will sketch out four influential ways of\nunderstanding ludification.\nThe first addresses ludification from a vantage point focusing on the emergence\nof playful identities that are associated with new cultural practices (Raessens, 2006),\nwhich in turn are shaped by how new media is being used and how such usage\nreconfigures, reshapes, and transforms media and identity (Frissen, Lammes, De\nLange, De Mul, & Raessens, 2015). Such an approach expresses a change of direc-\ntion in research into media and game studies following a cultural shift \"from a\npredominantly narrative to a predominantly ludic ontology\" (Raessens, 2006, p.\n54). The impetus to reveal this shift has come from a growing research interest in\nthe role of play in culture (Raessens, 2014).\nSeen through this analytical lens of play is ludification understood as an aspect of\nmedia convergence (Jenkins, 2006) and conceptualized as the flow of content across\nnumerous media platforms with an emerging participatory culture, where users\nplayfully engage and traverse spread out content to make meaningful connections\n\u00a8cklich, & Brereton, 2006). Investigations of\nludic identity construction in new media practices have been the predominant driver\nin conceptualizations of ludification.\nThe second regards ludification as gamification (Kirkpatrick, 2015). Like ludifi-\ncation, gamification is a new and often hotly debated term (Bogost, 2011, 2014),\nwhose tentative and porous definition highlights the \"use of game design elements in\nnon-game contexts\" (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011, para. 1). Gamifica-\ntion is associated with similar and even less well-defined terms such as \"gameful\"\n(McGonigal, 2014), \"gamified,\" and \"gamefulness,\" which often appear in conjunc-\ntion with \"design\" in phrases such as \"gameful design,\" \"gamified design,\" or as\n\"applied game\" or \"applied game design\" (Schmidt, Emmerich, & Schmidt, 2015), to\nmention just a few conceptual compositions from the tip of the gamification iceberg.\n2 Games and Culture XX(X)\nCurrently, consensus focuses on gamification as applied ludification targeting\naccelerated learning, enhanced engagement, and motivation through interaction with\ngame-like features outside the realm of games (Huotari & Hamari, 2011; Walz &\nThe third and perhaps less well-known view of ludification has to do with cine-\nmatic aesthetics influencing the visual shape or rhetoric of computer games (Larsen,\ninvestigates visual compositional formations of cinema and tracks them across\nmedia boundaries. In the present context, this extended influence is gathered\ntogether under the heading of cinemafication and reflects the ways in which cine-\nmatic techniques advance visual drama and elevate suspense in computer games\nwithout spilling over into related areas such as interactive storytelling or computer\ngame adaptations of movies. This view is loosely connected with transmedial worlds\nmovies that thematically use games to frame their narrative composition such as\nmention just a few. Identifying the borderlines between those perspectives is a close\nand often contextual call.\nThe fourth way of conceptualizing ludification is oriented toward computer\nhere is the question of how and to what extent play aspects and computer game\nelements influence the narrative composition of modern cinema. Such a perspec-\ntive traces patterns across boundaries of interactive and noninteractive media. This\ncalls for investigative caution to isolate clear examples of how computer game\nlogic is embedded in noninteractive cinematic narratives. It is vital to understand\nthat computer game logic in the present context is understood from a ludological\n\u00a8yra\n\u00a8, 2012) perspective and not from the dispersed\nperspective of gamification (Walz & Deterding, 2014), where narrowly selected\naspects of game logic can be traced in the logic of movie production or inside the\nmovies themselves.\nThe perspectives on ludification are often hazy, which is why the presented\nframework should be read as an attempt to iron out differences in an effort to clarify\nconceptual borders even though they can be difficult to draw.\nTo achieve this ambition, especially on how computer game logic penetrates\ncinematic narratives, five areas have been identified and outlined under the follow-\ning headings: (1) play worlds, (2) ludified quests, (3) controller and interfaces, (4)\nplay experience, and (5) game structures.\nThe composition of this article will clarify in greater detail the four ways of\nunderstanding ludification in order to sketch out a conceptual framework of ludifi-\ncation regarded from a predominantly ludological perspective. The main goal is to\npresent a ramified framework containing gamification on one side and cinemafica-\ntion on the other, each with relevant subcategories under the main heading of\nludification.\nThe overall research goal is twofold. The first is to map out a conceptual land-\nscape to clarify the current understanding of aspects of play and game and their\ninfluence on culture, identity creation, and gamified applications. The second and\nmost important is to provide an outline of cinemafication by unearthing ways in\nwhich (1) play aspects are influenced by cinematic aesthetics and (2) how computer\ngame logic influences the structure of selected cinematic narrative compositions.\nThe aim is to advance an expanded framework for the elusive concept of ludification\n(see Table 1).\nLudification: Play and Playfulness\nLudification as a cultural and social logic at the intersection between play and\ngame reveals how games act as sites for cultural and social production (Lindtner\n& Dourish, 2011). In this way, it places play and games at the heart of a\ndispersed ecology of practice, which extends from local identity creation to\nglobal cultural production and usage as well as general imagination and mani-\nfestation of imagery. This view of ludification bridges a lacuna in Huizinga's\nunderstanding and definition of play. Huizinga claims that play acts as an\norganizing principle of culture when he writes that culture \"arises in and as\nheart of culture. Yet his description of its formal characteristics paints a less\nclear picture, in particular when he highlights the separation of play and work,\ndrawing distinctions between the purposeless and the purposeful or, perhaps\nmost noteworthy, between the unproductive and the productive. Huizinga writes\nof play that\n. . . we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside \"ordinary\" life as\nbeing \"not serious\", but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is\nan activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It\nproceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules\nTable 1.

It promotes the formation of social groupings which intend to\nsurround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world\nby disguise or other means. (p. 13)\nThe essence of this quotation is echoed by Caillois (1958/2001), when he describes\nplay as \"pure waste\" (p. 5).\nHuizinga and Caillois's epistemology of play as unproductive and wasteful activ-\nities rests on the traditional Protestant distinction between play and work (Weber,\n1958). This is highlighted by Stevens (1978), when he points out that Huizinga's\ninfluential definition of play stresses the separation of play and work by placing play\noutside ordinary life, adhering to its own rules and carrying no material interest. An\nactivity deprived of seriousness although it has the ability to intensely absorb its\nparticipants.\nAccording to Stevens (1978), Huizinga and Caillois's distinction between play as\nbeing unproductive and useless and work as productive and useful is \"a false dichot-\nomy\" (p. 17). Both Huizinga and Caillois confuse formal characteristics of play with\nthe experience of being in play. Stevens argues that definitions of play that include\nsuch polarity blur and confuse our understanding of play, or, as he correctly writes,\n\"we are taking the behavior for the experiencing of that behavior\" (Stevens, 1978,\np. 21). He proposes untangling the \"rut\" (p. 21) by distinguishing between \"play\nform\" and \"play experience\" (p. 20). Such a distinction is beneficial since it sepa-\nrates the process of experiencing being in play (Gadamer, 1960/2013) from a formal\ndescription (Larsen, 2015) of the structure of play seen and mapped out from a\nbird's-eye perspective.\nThe shift in perspective from external to internal workings of play experience\nopens up a novel approach to play, especially if it is considered as taking place\nduring work activities (Stevens, 1978). This in turn allows play to be seen as a\nparticular and pleasurable attitude or sentiment from some kind of ongoing activity,\nwhich presents play as \"a mode of human experience [ . . . ] a way of engaging the\nThis way of perceiving play has three beneficial implications. It positions play (1)\nas a mode of experiencing, (2) as a particular way of engaging with the world, and\n(3) as a potentiality in all kinds of places and/or activities.\nIn a more recent article, Malaby (2009) refines his stance on play by addressing it\nas disposition \"characterized by a readiness to improvise in the face of an ever-\nchanging world that admits of no transcendently ordered account\" (Malaby, 2009, p.\n206). Malaby's formulation couples two aspects.\nFirstly, it prioritizes play as a specific stance toward any given ordered\nactivity or practice. Such a conceptualization of play as a predominantly playful\nattitude is similar to Sicart's (2014) description of play. The difference between\nthem is that Sicart understands play as an appropriative dynamic that (1) \"takes\nover\" any unfolding activity, (2) takes place contextually as a result of negotia-\ntion, (3) is tied to a specific situation, and (4) involves particular themes such\nas balancing tensions between order and chaos, including the pleasures of\ndestruction.\nSecondly, Malaby (2009) stresses that play involves navigating the indetermi-\nnateness of an ever-changing world (Malaby, 2009), or, when applied to the realm of\ngames, involves handling randomness in input and outcomes (Burgun, 2014), lead-\ning to uncertainty either in player behavior or in outcomes (Caillois, 1958/2001;\nThe larger point Malaby attempts to drive home becomes even clearer when he\nabandons the traditional dichotomy between work and play. Here games become\nsites for establishing new cultural forms specific to the historic moment in which\nWhen the work/play distinction is left behind, we see instead in ludic practice a\nmore useful contrast between a cultural form (a game-like activity, no matter how\nplayfully engaged in) and a mode of cultural experience (a playful disposition\nMalaby's anthropological positioning of play resembles contemporary media and\ngame studies when stressing the absence of strict boundaries \"between play and\neveryday practices\" (Roig, Cornelio, Arde\n`vol, Alsina, & Page\nAlthough scholars see more or less eye to eye on the ludic presence in contem-\nporary culture, few seem to agree on the ontology of a playful disposition. This\nraises questions of how to understand such a playful disposition and the layering that\nit consists of. Trammell and Gilbert (2014) try to address the issue by dissecting play\nat the intersection of play as form and play as experience, highlighting play as\ndivided between \"schemes,\" \"latitude,\" and \"slack.\" Schemes characterized play\nthrough the appearance of its objects in expected places and through a focus on\ngames and their \"affordances, mechanics, organisation and industrial implications\"\n(p. 396). Latitude is a blurring of \"the notion of what play is and where it happens\"\n(p. 396), thereby drawing attention to game spaces outside traditional boundaries\nand loosening the perception of how play operates in popular culture. Finally slack\nreflects ways in which \"play is part of everyday life\" (p. 396).\nTrammell and Gilbert's analysis of play experience derives from a particular\napproach to Huizinga's understanding of play, namely, how play entails both free-\ndom from restriction and resistance toward conformity. Trammell and Gilbert\ndescribe play(fulness) as oscillating between play and game activities in everyday\npractices of media consumption and production.\nGrimes and Feenberg (2009) on the other hand present a less innocent and more\ncritical perspective of play, playfulness, and ludification. Even though they focus on\nplay in relation to massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs), their approach is\nhighly relevant in the current context. This is especially true of their perception of\nludification as a form of social rationalization that takes place at the intersection of\nplay experience and game systems. Their perspective includes a reciprocal position\nthat outlines how play practices \"themselves come to reproduce the larger processes\nof rationalization at work within modern capitalist societies\" (p. 105).\n6 Games and Culture XX(X)\nRationalization here should be understood as a compound of three types of play\npractice taking place in MMOGs, namely, \"(1) exchange of equivalents, (2) classifi-\ncation and application of rules, and (3) optimization of effort and calculation of result\"\n(p. 106). This abstract description follows Silverman and Simon's (2009) player-\ncentric description of power player behavior in MMOGs. The correspondence\nbetween Silverman and Simon and Grimes and Feenberg is in their shared conception\nof play as an act or activity of \"machination\" and sublimation of submission shaped by\nthe game system. Unlike Silverman and Simon, Grimes and Feenberg regard players\nas engaged in a struggle with game corporations over game environments and content,\na perspective that emphasizes the players production of game content.\nGrimes and Feenberg provide a view of rationalized play on two levels. First,\nthey consider ways in which games are addressed as a rational practice and, second,\nthey take into account \"the social, cultural, and political conditions within which a\ngame is appropriated and contested by its players\" (Grimes & Feenberg, 2009, p.\n107). As in Stevens and Malaby, these two levels transgress the work/play dichot-\nomy in pointing to the rationalization process and the different domains in which\nplay unfolds. It is important to keep in mind that Grimes and Feenberg conceptualize\ngames as a predetermined set of possibilities and constraints that together create \"a\nform of social order\" (p. 108). It is possibly even more important that \"it is not that\nsocial order recapitulates certain features of games, but rather that games have\nthemselves become forms of social order\" (p. 109). These quotations take into\naccount the reciprocal relationship between configurations of consumption and for-\nmations of produced game content. They stress that play, playfulness, and ludifica-\ntion unfold in an intricate dynamic between the players' struggle to appropriate\ngame environments and the corporate commodification and instrumentalization of\nplay. It can be argued that this dynamic unfolds in a continuum ranging at the one\nend from a \"play mode\" close to Malaby's description of play as a disposition and on\nthe other end to a specialized stance required to play a particular game conceptua-\nlized as \"game mode\" much in line with the arguments of Silverman and Simon.\nWithin this framework, Grimes and Feenberg flesh out how play is transformed\nwhen moving from play mode to game mode. Play passes from an undifferentiated\nplayful state (play mode) to a rationalized mental configuration adjusted to \"fit\" the\ngame system (game mode). This is a transformative process, which takes place\nthrough a series of differentiations (Walter, 2003, 2011). Such a perspective is close\nto Caillois's continuum ranging from paidia/impulsive/play mode to ludus/disci-\npline/game mode, the two poles being understood, respectively, as \"diversion, tur-\nbulence, free improvisation, and carefree gaiety [and] ever greater amount of effort,\nThe difference between Caillois and Grimes and Feenberg is that the latter draw\nattention to the rationalizing process through the series of transformations and not\nthrough increasing discipline. It is equally important that Grimes and Feenberg do\nnot see the rationalization process as mutual exclusion of either playing or gaming.\nInstead playing a game should be understood as a \"dual process\" (Grimes &\nFeenberg, 2009, p. 111), involving the delicate balancing acts of playing and gaming\nsimultaneously.\nIn that way, Grimes and Feenberg's play mode and game mode resemble Mala-\nby's \"cultural form\" and \"mode of cultural experience,\" which could be said to\nunfold in an overlapping continuum that keeps both aspects open for ongoing\nconfigurations.\nYet Grimes and Feenberg (2009) go one step further. They carve out ways in\nwhich the process of social rationalization passes from play mode to game mode. It\ndoes so by virtue of five properties:\n(a) reflexivity (play becomes increasingly self-referential), (b) boundedness (play is a\ndifferentiated activity), (c) rule governedness (play is transformed into a game by\nspecific rules), (d) precision (play is standardized enabling measurement/optimization),\nand (e) playfulness (play as undifferentiated activity in everyday communicative prac-\nThese five properties constitute the elements in the process of ludification as\ntransformations from undifferentiated to differentiated activities that rely upon\noptimization, discipline, and excluded self-referential realities outside everyday life.\nTogether, they facilitate formations of new manifestations of social order while at\nthe same time creating opportunities for user resistance and innovation. These are all\naspects that influence this article's perception of playful aesthetics and gameful\nnarratives.\nLudification: Game and Gamefulness\nGamification understood as an aspect of ludification is less concerned with tracing\nludified cultural traits and identities and more concerned with applying game ele-\nments in everyday activities outside the realm of games. This means that gamifica-\ntion is particularly interested in game-like traits of interactive systems. Of special\ninterest is the question of how to use game elements to motivate and engage users in\nsome manner or degree to enhance or accelerate involvement or performance\nBuried within such broad descriptions are a number of questions addressing\ndifferent aspects of gamification: (1) How are interactive systems and there prop-\nerties understood? (2) Is the gamified system comparative, evaluating or surveying?\n(3) To which domains does the system belong? (education, online communities,\nsocial networks, health, sustainability, research, finance and marketing to mention\njust a few; Deterding, Sicart, Nacke, O'Hara, & Dixon, 2011; Huotari & Hamari,\nHow are rewarding game design elements conceived? (e.g., badges, leader boards,\nlevels, resources, clear goals, and challenges; Deterding, Dixon, et al., 2011), (6)\nHow is the experience of engaging with the system described? (Hunicke, Leblanc, &\n8 Games and Culture XX(X)\nZubek, 2004), and (7) Perhaps most notably, how are formal game elements\nunderstood?\nMany of these questions are under debate and have yet to be answered unequi-\nvocally. Of particular interest in the present instance are the questions related to\ngame properties, namely, its reward system, interactivity, and player experiences,\nsince they address key elements of gamification and clearly set gamification apart\nfrom playful identity creation and new media practices.\nGamification is heavily concerned with reward systems as motivational drivers\nfor behavioral changes. Yet almost all research on gamification refrains from\nexplaining how a reward system should or could be designed beyond giving the\nplayer a badge for a job well done. But details about how to design a reward system\nhave already been identified and explained as clearly demonstrated by Hopson\n(2001). He outlines how reward systems can be designed through tasks/assign-\nments/quests with either/or fixed and variable ratios and intervals (Larsen, 2012).\nWhen translated into the reality of practical application, the reward system sounds\nsomething like this: Game \u00c2Presents the player with a quest of killing \u00c2 Orcs or\nsolving \u00c2 Math assignments (Larsen, 2012). In both cases, rewards are distributed\nthrough a fixed ratio. Such a scenario can be coupled with a variable ratio that\nensures rewards after each player action. Every time the player kills an orc or solves\na math problem, a reward presents itself. This model can be expanded by fixed or\nvariable time released rewards so that the player receives rewards either after a fixed\nor a random time period. This is called layering rewards according to fixed and\nvariable ratios. Layered rewards are heavily invoked in MMOGs, including World of\nWarcraft (2004). Such a system creates correlation between object meaning, game\nprogression, and new rewards to ensure player motivation and engagement. This\ndescription is far from exhaustive, but it demonstrates how particularities of one of\nthe key elements in gamification are seldom satisfactory described even though it\nhas been brought into focus and analyzed.\nAnother example of lack of clarity relates to interactivity, which, while often\nreferred to as a key component of computer games, is rarely explained. Yet Crawford\n(2003) has illustrated interactivity as being similar to having a conversation with\nanother human being. His point is that interactivity depends on a fluent exchange\nbetween player input and system response or, as Crawford writes when defining\ninteractivity, it is \"a cyclic process in which two active agents alternately (and meta-\nphorically) listen, think, and speak\" (p. 76). The challenge of interactivity is respon-\nsiveness. The system should ideally respond \"as if\" or in just as \"lively\" a way as a\nhuman counterpart. This presents a difficult task even for triple A game producers.\nThis fluent dialogue between player input and system response is overlooked or\nneglected in relation to gamification. This formal description of interactivity says little\nabout player experience or how players or users feel when interacting with a particular\ngame or gamified system. This article claims that interactivity is associated with how a\nparticular system feels when engaged with. This feel is often referred to as game feel\nand, like reward systems and interactivity, it has been addressed in game studies.\nSwink (2009) has defined game feel as \"real-time control of virtual objects in\na simulated space, with interactions emphasized by polish\" (p. 6). The definition\nneeds a bit of unpacking. Real-time control of virtual objects more or less\ncovers interactivity involved in handling objects and experiencing how they\nrespond (the input\u00adoutput cycle mentioned above). Simulated space concerns\nthe virtual space and how objects behave, while polish points to particular ways\nof experiencing the digital objects. Polish is also called juice (Jonasson & Purho,\n2012). Generally speaking, polish/juice directs the players' experience of digital\nobjects. Are they perceived as heavy or light, easy or difficult to break or\nshatter, or are perceived as alive or dead? Sketching out complexities of reward\nsystems, interactivity, and player experience points to a further need for clar-\nification in relation to both the applicative and conceptual dimension of\ngamification.\nIn spite of design and conceptual shortcomings offers gamification valuable\ninsights. Firstly, it indicates how playfulness and gamefulness operate in the ludic\nturn. Secondly, it addresses the ongoing efforts of gamifying existing activities.\nThirdly, it manifests itself on an epistemic level as the ideological driving force\nbehind the ongoing applicative and ludic transformations. Fourthly, both the appli-\ncative and the epistemic level deliver fuel to ludic identity and to culture creation,\nsince they take place through playful applications and gamified systems and thereby\nintertwining gamification and ludification.\nTogether, gamification and ludification could be said to act in a circular and\nrecursive formation accelerating and expanding the ludic presence of game-like\ntraits outside the realm of games engaged with playful attitudes.\nCinemafication: Playful Aesthetics\nLudification understood and investigated as the impact of cinematic aesthetics on\ncomputer game expressions have until now been sparsely addressed, although such\nOne way of addressing cinematic significance is by outlining the comprehensive\ncatalogue of computer games that incorporate narrative compositions and storytell-\ning (Fac\n2013) in their game structure. These attempts demonstrate how techniques and\nthemes from contemporary cinema are being \"transported and \"converted\" to fit the\ninteractive framework of computer games, even though such efforts are often chal-\nlenged, most notably by the controversy between \"ludologists\" and \"narrativists\"\nKu\nin their own right (Aarseth, 2003) or as expressions of narrative configurations\nThe present discussion is less concerned with narrative in computer games than\nwith drawing parallels between selected and exemplary aesthetic cinematic\n10 Games and Culture XX(X)\ntechniques and exploring how computer games incorporate them. In this, I am\nfollowing an early and important venture presented by King and Krzywinska\n(2002) in which \"games-in-the-light-of-cinema\" (p. 2) was investigated.\nIn the present context, interfaces between cinema and computer games are \"read\"\nusing Fiske's (1993) interpretation of Kristeva's (1980) conceptualization of inter-\ntextuality. In particular, I use what Fiske coined \"vertical intertextuality\" (Fiske,\n1993, p. 117), which traces the dialogical synergies across different media high-\nlighting how meanings and, in this case, how aesthetic techniques are shaped by\nother \"texts\"/media.\nA vibrant case of vertical intertextuality can be found in the Max Payne game\nplayful influences worth mentioning are cut-scenes, voice-over, and game\nmechanics, exemplified by the Max Payne series creation of bullet time.\nFirstly, cut-scenes are digitalized animated sequences that often interrupt the flow\nof play to inform players of upcoming conflicts or challenges (Costikyan, 2002;\nHowells, 2002; Tong & Tan, 2002). It is a well-known technique. Secondly, voice-\nover is a film noir technique that has found its way into computer games. It creates\nambience and builds drama by enhancing suspense. The third and perhaps most\nnotable cinematic imprint can be traced to game mechanics (Burgun, 2015; Sicart,\n2008). In the Max Payne series, the famous game mechanic is called bullet time.\nWhen it is activated, time is slowed down along with enhanced visual cues and\neffects already described as polish (Swink, 2009). Bullet time is, in essence, a game\nmechanic distilled from the technique of slow motion--except for the fact that Max/\nthe player can take aim in real time giving Max/the player an edge over approaching\nenemies. Bullet time is directly tied to cinematic techniques in movies such as The\nMatrix (1999) or X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), where scenes are slowed down\nto a near standstill.\nThe bullet time resembles the reverse motion game mechanic in Jonathan Blow's\nindie game Braid (2008), where the player can move the protagonist, Tim, backward\nin motion to solve otherwise insolvable puzzles. The reverse motion game mechanic\nis a digital translation of movie scenes using reverse motion as in Funny Games\n(1960). Bullet time and the reverse motion mechanic both express playful conver-\nsions of movie aesthetics. Bullet time and the reverse motion mechanic are examples\nof playful aesthetics juggling with temporality, here also being used existentially to\nreverse the flow of time and escape death.\nCut-scenes, voice-over, and game mechanics such as bullet time and\nreverse motion display an organization of the audio-visual material (Mulvey,\n2009) inspired by mainstream movies. Together, they outline playful aes-\ncinematic aesthetics, and in doing so, they exemplify one aspect of what this\narticle has termed the cinemafication of computer games under the heading of\nludification.\nCinemafication: Gameful Narratives\nThe second aspect of cinemafication addresses a research area that until now has\nattracted little attention. It concerns how computer game logic influences cinematic\nnarrative compositions.\nThe work that has been done has focused primarily on narrative convergence\nbetween the cinema and computer games (Kinder, 2002). Less attention has been\ndevoted to how cinema employs game structures in its narrative compositions. One\nearly example of cinema applying game structures is the movie Lola Run Lola\n(1998), where the narrative unfolds as a puzzle \"game.\" The main character, Lola,\nstrives to successfully arrange a series of narrative events into a coherent whole with\na positive outcome not only for herself but also for her boyfriend and several other\ncharacters involved in the story. After three repetitions (Grieb, 2002) or respawns,\nshe is finally successful in placing the narrative sequence in the correct order and\nthereby \"solving\" the story?\nThe present context follows such an approach and identifies how computer games\ninfluence mainstream cinema on two levels, a semantic and a structural. The sematic\nlevel uses games to frame the narrative as in the abovementioned movies Wreck-It\na few. These movies more or less construct a fictional dyad distinguishing between\nevents taking place inside or outside a game or game-like world. Generally speaking,\nthe fictional dyad plays with the fictional content by intertwining the stratification of\ndiegetic levels of the narrated events in the story world. Less explicit examples are\ncinematic expressions using games to propel the narrative as in the cases of using\nor using the game of chess as narrative anchor as is the case in the The Seventh Seal\n(1953) or less explicitly in Blade Runner (1982) just to mention a few cases, where\nchess plays a part in the narrative composition.\nThe structural level is concerned with formal similarities between computer game\nelements and the narrative composition. It is that level this article is concerned with.\nIn the following investigation of computer game influences, five traits of such\ninfluence have been identified, (1) play worlds, (2) ludified quests, (3) controller\nand interfaces, (4) play experience, and (5) game structure.\nPlay Worlds\nPlay worlds can be outlined from Huizinga's definition of play. An exemplary case\nand movie installments. They are all organized according to similar ritualistic\npatterns. In Ghost Protocol (2011), the protagonist Ethan Hunts crosses the line\nseparating everyday life from a play world where he is hero, a savior of the world.\nHunt enters the magic circle of play (Salen & Zimmerman, 2004; Zimmerman,\n2014) by voluntarily accepting a secret mission placing himself and his Impossible\n12 Games and Culture XX(X)\nMission Force (IMF) group outside normal life and firmly in a scenario abiding by\nits own rules.\nThis is especially evident each time Hunt receives a mission. This is always\ncommunicated in the same recognizable way by structuring the content in same\norder. Each mission statement contains an identification of Hunt followed by a\nmission requiring a break-in to a particular space within a specific time frame--the\nKremlin in Ghost Protocol (2011) and the Vatican in Mission: Impossible III\n(2006)--to affirm, steal, or retrieve something or somebody. The mission statement\nalways ends by emphasizing that Hunt and his team will be disowned if captured or\nkilled thereby stressing their secrecy.\nActing out missions often centers on dressing up and impersonating villains by\npretending. Dressing up emphasizes the continuous \"play\" with identities, from the\ninitial mission confirmation of Hunt being Hunt to the identification of the villain.\nDressing up and impersonating is, by the way, one of the most salient features of\nMission Impossible. Not only can disguised members of IMF mimic the visual\nappearance of alleged villains, but they can also impersonate voices making them\nimpossible to distinguish from the real thing and in so doing enact a pivotal aspect of\nTaken together, the Mission Impossible universe exhibits a play world character-\nized by voluntary actions taking place outside everyday life within a specific time\nand space frame in a specific enactment as a secret group separated from everyday\nworld by disguise. All words in italics point to crucial aspects of Huizinga's defi-\nnition of play and justify a classification of the fictional universe of Mission Impos-\nsible as a play world.\nLudified Quests\nThe main challenge of conceptualizing ludified quests lies in separating them from\n(Tosca, 2003) is about transporting the player's avatar from Point A (beginning) to\nPoint B (end) through Point C (challenge/conflict) just as when Jumpman (later\nMario) has to defeat Donkey Kong to reach The Lady (later Pauline) in the Donkey\nKong (1981) arcade game or the later Mario game installments. Such a quest tem-\nplate fits many games and many narratives.\nLudified quest is dependent on vertical intertextual game references, as is the case\nIn Getaway, the ex-racing car driver Brent Magna is being forced to drive a\nMustang Shelby through the city of Sofia completing a series of quests to satisfy\nthe kidnappers of his wife. One quest is a drive, control, and speed test, where\nMagna has to get from Points A to B in less than 4 min. Driving recklessly\nthrough a densely populated city completing a timed quest places the scenario\nvery close to the highly proclaimed and debated computer game series Grand\ncrashes his car into police cars with screeching tires and people fleeing to avoid\nbeing hit by the vehicle. The vertical intertextual similarities between the movie\nGetaway and the GTA series show how the traditional quest scheme is trans-\nformed from standard quest to ludified scheme and in the process describes how\nformal quests are ludified.\nController and Interfaces\nGetaway is ludified not only through vertical intertextual references to the GTA\nseries but also in the way the movie addresses the relationship between protagonist\n(Magna) and antagonist who is an anonymous voice on the phone. This relationship\nis similar to that between player and avatar. In Getaway, Magna is avatar, while the\nanonymous voice acts as the player. The phone acts as a gateway for input and\noutput. Such a setup can be found in several movies, but in this case, the persona\nbehind the anonymous voice has installed several cameras in the Shelby, making\nMagna visible on the anonymous voice's computer screen. This adds to the sensation\nof Magna being an avatar. When this relationship between controller and controlled\nis seen against the backdrop of the GTA series, it becomes an expression of a ludified\nconstruction.\nThe intersection between controller and controlled reflects the relationship\nbetween software and hardware as a point of transition that relays the feel (Swink,\n2009) of the game. Magna as avatar is a tool acting out each of the voice's input\ncommands, but falling to do so would break immersion (Murray, 1997; Salen &\nrelationship of power between protagonist and antagonist. The moment Magna\nbreaks free of the voice's hold over him, he transforms from avatar to character,\nmarking the point where ludification ends and traditional movie composition begins.\nSuch considerations encourage associations with the title. Getaway pays lip ser-\nvice to Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway (1972) and later versions, but more notably it\nrelates to the term gateway, understood as a link between two computer programs or\nas a node acting as interface between user (voice) and content (Magna).\nGetaway illustrates how controller and interfaces find a way and an expression in\nthe narrative composition of modern movies. In this case, as an interface, they relay\nan input\u00adoutput circuit between controller and avatar.\nPlay Experience\nPlay experience as the fourth aspect of gameful narratives can be found in the\nmainstream sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow (2014). The narrative composition\nenacts the play experience and the structure of a particular computer game genre,\nreal-time strategy (RTS) games.\nThis section is concerned with tracing and unearthing the formal structure of play\nexperience in the narrative composition.\n14 Games and Culture XX(X)\nIn Edge of Tomorrow, William Cage, played by Tom Cruise, a major in public\nrelations who knows very little about being a soldier, is thrown against his will into a\nbattle against the alien invasion force The Mimics.\nCage quickly finds himself in a unit of unfit soldiers in the middle of the\nchaotic battlefield on the dawn of the final battle against the Mimic force or so\nthe military command thinks. However, the battle is an ambush. On the day of the\nfinal assault against the Mimics virtually all the soldiers are slaughtered. Cage's\nunit get killed frantically firing their weapons in panic in all directions without\nhitting any Mimics.\nIn his final seconds, Cage detonates a claymore mine, killing himself and an\nattacking a Mimic. The audience see Cage screaming as he dies with his face\ndrenched in Mimic blood. We are 24 min into the movie. Seconds later, Cage wakes\nup at the Heathrow airbase one day before the assault just witnessed. Cage relives the\nsame day and ends up getting killed once again. This pattern repeats itself. At each\nrepetition time is reset, placing Cage 1 day before the final battle. Later in the movie,\nCage learns that he accidental killed a rare a Mimic who controlled time. By killing\nit, he derived its ability or game mechanic.\nAfter several attempts to survive the battlefield, he joins forces with Rita Vra-\ntaski, played by Emily Blunt. Vrataski is a highly decorated and respected soldier.\nTogether, they fight their way through the massive presence of Mimics, trying to\nlocate the controlling force behind the invasion, the Omega.\nThe ludic influence on Edge of Tomorrow includes the formal respawn mechanic\nactivated every time Cage dies. Such a structure is similar to the one applied in\ncomputer games. Each time the player dies, he or she starts over again. Same pattern\nas in the before mentioned Run Lola Run.\nBesides the die-respawn mechanic, Cage engages in a learning process to prog-\nress through the battlefield. He trains, fights, and dies without risk (Gee, 2003, 2005;\nShaffer, 2006) always starting from scratch after dying. Once again, this resembles\nplayers trying to progress in a computer game.\nCage trains and learns to perform action sequences by memorizing. Each encoun-\nter with the enemy constitutes a countermove (Sirlin, 2008). Just like computer\nplayers learning to fight an Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nGame design Koster (2004) calls the learning of repetitious patterns grokking\n(2004). This refers to developing an understanding of something, \"so thoroughly that\nyou have become one with it and even love it. It's a profound understanding beyond\nintuition or empathy\" (p. 28).\nSuch patterns are needed to combat fast and complex AIs in RTS games. These\nlearned patterns could be divided in sequence and composition and, as Engestro\n\u00a8m\nlearning. Sequence is first and foremost about memorization of repeatable actions in\nstable contexts (the same battle each time). Composition is about changing\nsequence, adapting to change by recontextualizing and so instantiating and creating\nnew memorization of new sequences.\nOscillating between memorizing sequences and recontextualizing the same\nsequences (composition) constitutes the play experience (Larsen, 2015) of almost\nall computer gamers, when they try to find a way through or repel overwhelming\nforces generated by an AI.\nSuch player behavior exhibits what Juul (2013) characterizes as the paradox of\nfailure. Faced with failure in a computer game, the player becomes aware that he or\nshe is not good enough to overcome the challenge at hand. This is unpleasant. Yet\nplayers continue because \"games promise us a fair chance of redeeming ourselves\"\n(p. 7). In the case of Cage in Edge of Tomorrow, success hinges on nothing short of\nsaving mankind.\nGame Structure\nAs I have already pointed out, the structural layering of the invading Mimic force in\nEdge of Tomorrow is similar to the game structure of RTS games such as the Star-\nZerg rush in StarCraft), while Cage and Vrataski (players) try to counter the attacks.\nIn The Art of Computer Game Design (Crawford, 1982), Crawford highlights a\nnumber of computer game design techniques based on computer properties. They all\nserve to put pressure on the player. This is done (1) by using vast resources, under-\nstood as the computer's ability to create endless numbers of enemies; 2) by present-\ning limited information to the player, he or she is held in partial darkness; (3) by\nincreasing pace, unit respawn times, and movement speed; (4) by asymmetrical\nrelationship between computer and player (each side having different strengths and\nweaknesses); and (5) by using indirection (triangularity), which means presenting a\nspecial unit for the player to create a choice (Fullerton, Swain, & Hoffman, 2004;\nMeier, 2012) between following the current action or changing course and going\nafter the special unit. Indirection (triangularity) creates a \"mixed offensive-\nIn Edge of Tomorrow, all five design technics can be found: (1) the Omega/AI\ncontrols vast resources in the form of huge numbers of Mimics, (2) the players' (Cage/\nVrataski) actions are based on limited information (Mimics hide in the ground [similar\nto the Zergs in the StarCraft series]), (3) mimics move with overwhelming speed, (4)\nthere are asymmetrical relationships (a) between two players (Cage/Vrataski) against\nan army of vast resources and (b) in the possession of an asymmetrical ability (or game\nmechanic: (Burgun, 2015; Sicart, 2008), the ability to control time. The time-reset\nmechanic shifts from Mimic to Cage and later in the movie back to the Mimics again,\nand (5) in the final encounter with the Omega, an a Mimic is present enacting a\ntriangular relationship, creating a choice scenario where Cage/Vrataski have to deter-\nmine whether to pursue the a Mimic to regain time-reset mechanic or go for the final\nkill (known as an a strike in game communities) by destroying the Omega knowing\n16 Games and Culture XX(X)\nthey will die trying. Such similarities between computer game elements and modern\ncinema expose the dynamics of structural ludification.\nConclusion\nThis article has presented a conceptual framework of ludification as an answer to the\nelusive question \"What is ludification?,\" especially as regards the ludification of\nmodern cinema.\nUntil recently, ludification has been investigated mainly for its ludic significance\nfor playful identity creation as an expression of new participatory dynamics, pat-\nterns, and strategies in media practices. Such an approach has been set against the\nwidely applied dimension known as gamification, especially when conceived as\nconverting nongame content and contexts into game-like scenarios. There have been\ndiscussions about ways to position the concepts of ludification and gamification\nrelative to each other, and especially which term should be considered as overarch-\ning (Walz & Deterding, 2014). This article has proposed placing ludic identity and\nplayful media practices parallel to applied game aspects on nongame content and\ncontext under the heading of gamification as shown in Table 1. Such a step opens up\navenues for horizontally expanding conceptualizing by including two identified and\nequally important areas of ludic influences. These two areas constitute oppositional\nchannels of influences wandering between modern cinema and computer games.\nThey have been called playful aesthetics and gameful narratives.\nPlayful aesthetics is concerned with investigating and tracing how cinematic\neffects are being adapted and utilized in computer games. Cut-scenes and voice-\nover techniques demonstrated direct adaptation, while game mechanics exhibited\ncomplex indirect conversions of established cinematic aesthetics.\nGameful narratives constitute the prime concern of this article and reflect ways in\nwhich narrative compositions of modern cinema are more or less explicitly being struc-\nturally effected by computer game elements. Five such structural influences have been\nidentified. These were identified as follows: play worlds, ludified quests, controller and\ninterfaces, player experience, and game structure, all pointing to different aspects of\ncomputer game elements that influence the narrative composition of modern cinema.\nFuture work should focus on continuing unearthing, identifying, and clarifying\nadditional aspects of computer game elements and their influence on modern\ncinema. Especially from the proposed structural level where the influence is far less\nobvious than on the semantic level, where computer games frame the narration as in\nthe abovementioned cases Tron series, Gamer, or Wreck-It Ralph highlight.\nFinally, to get at a clear grasp of the complexities of ludification, the dynamic\ninfluences that mutually effect cinema and computer games (playful aesthetics and\ngameful narratives) have been placed together under the heading of cinemafication\n(Table 1) in contrast to gamification, thereby outlining the otherwise porous and\nelusive concept known as ludification, giving it substance and presenting it in a\nramified conceptual framework.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding.\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nReferences\nAarseth, E.
