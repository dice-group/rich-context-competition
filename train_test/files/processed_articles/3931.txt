    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo what extent does the level of overlap between social appraisal and social\nreferencing depend upon the particular definitions adopted when following\ndifferent research agendas? I argue that processes of both kinds fall under\nthe more inclusive heading of relation alignment. Relation alignment also\ncovers emotional influence that is not mediated by the communication of\nappraisal. Similarities, interdependences, and distinctions between these\nvarious relation-alignment processes warrant further investigation.\n",

In \"affective observation,\" on the other\nhand, the learner simply observes the knower interacting with a\nperson or object, and makes evaluative inferences about the lat-\nter on the basis of the knower's expressive behavior. Both social\nreferencing and affective observation are instances of what\nCl\u00e9ment and Dukes call \"social appraisal.\"\nThe question is whether this distinction between social refer-\nencing and affective observation is one that is scientifically use-\nful. In answering this question, it is worth considering the two\ncentral panels of Figure 2 in the Cl\u00e9ment and Dukes article\n(2017), because these capture what these authors regard as the\nkey process differences between the two constructs. In one case,\nsocial referencing, the learner interacts with a stimulus that\ngives rise to uncertainty, or even anxiety. The knower monitors\nthis interaction and deliberately modulates it by engaging in\nostensive communication. In the case of affective observation,\nthe knower interacts with a stimulus that generates emotionally\nexpressive behavior in the knower without any explicit inten-\ntion to communicate this to the learner; the learner observes this\ninteraction and draws an inference about the emotional qualities\nof the stimulus.\nThis distinction is, we think, conceptually clear and is likely\nto be important in understanding the role played by emotional\nexpressions in social learning. Take a child who interacts for the\nfirst time with another child who belongs to a different ethnic\ngroup. The first child may be uncertain and look to his or her\ncaregiver. The latter's smiles encourage the child to interact\nwith the outgroup child. The adult thereby actively teaches the\nchild a \"lesson\" about the emotional value of outgroup mem-\nbers. Contrast this with a situation in which a child witnesses his\nor her caregiver interacting warily with an adult who is a mem-\nber of a different ethnic group, and making a negative expres-\nsion behind the other adult's back when the interaction is over.\nHere the adult unwittingly teaches the child a lesson about the\nemotional value of outgroup members. These two sets of cir-\ncumstances differ in significant respects (not least in terms of\nthe implications for interventions).\nHowever, if we were to focus on the value of this distinction\nfor understanding how emotional experience and behavior are\ninfluenced by others, we might arrive at a different conclusion.\nTo understand the way in which social influences operate on the\nemotion process, it makes little difference whether the learner's\nemotional response to a stimulus is shaped by being actively\nsteered by expressive behavior that is deliberately communi-\ncated by a knower, or by witnessing the knower interacting with\nthe stimulus and apparently enjoying (or disliking) the experi-\nence. Either way, the learner's emotional response to the stimu-\nlus is shaped by inferences made about the knower's appraisals.\nA final point is that we believe that there is another poten-\ntially important difference between social referencing and social\nappraisal that is not explicitly mentioned in either article,\nnamely the circumstances under which these phenomena take\nplace. Social referencing is likely to be used in situations that\nare novel and the individual is seen to need others' appraisals to\nhelp him or her to disambiguate the situation. In the classic\nsocial referencing context, the knower's appraisal becomes the\nchild's appraisal. In principle, social appraisal applies to a\nbroader set of circumstances, having the potential to shape both\ninitial appraisals of a stimulus and subsequent reappraisals.\nThus passengers who are initially calm during a turbulent flight\nmay become anxious when they hear the screams of a flight\nattendant, and students who are mildly disappointed with how\ntheir essays have been graded may become angry when exposed\nto fellow students' appraisals of unfairness. It is not that others'\nappraisals of the event are adopted because the passengers or\nstudents are uncertain about how to appraise it; rather, others'\nappraisals serve to modulate an initial appraisal. Thus social ref-\nerencing is likely to occur early in the emotion process, whereas\nsocial appraisal could occur at virtually any stage. This is a sub-\ntle but potentially important difference when it comes to identi-\nfying the processes that are triggered when we are exposed to\nothers' emotions.\nReferences\nCampos, J., & Stenberg, C.

Is\nthere underlying commonality in the kinds of emotional influ-\nence implied by both concepts? Or is social referencing just\none example of a number of possible social appraisal pro-\ncesses? Answers to these questions obviously depend on our\ndefinitions of \"social appraisal\" and \"social referencing\"\nbecause adopting a more restrictive or inclusive formulation\nof either construct can tip the balance of argument in one or\nthe other direction. For example, a relatively broad concept of\nsocial appraisal is more likely to encompass a relatively nar-\nrow concept of social referencing than vice versa. But is there\nsomething deeper at stake; something that goes beyond seman-\ntics and gets to the bottom of how emotions regulate other\npeople's behaviour across social development and during real-\ntime interactions between adults?\nThree decades back, similar considerations surrounded the\nWhether emotion always depends on cognition is another ques-\ntion whose answer hinges on how inclusively the key concepts\nare formulated (e.g., Leventhal & Scherer, 1987; Parkinson &\nManstead, 1992). Emotion without cognition is clearly possible\nif \"emotion\" is defined broadly enough and \"cognition\" is\ndefined narrowly enough. However, definitional respecification\nof this kind leaves more fundamental questions about what\nkinds of \"emotion\" depend on what kinds of \"cognition\" unan-\nswered (Leventhal & Scherer, 1987). In the affective primacy\ncontroversy, moving beyond definitional disputes involved\naddressing these more specific questions. Arguably, the\nburgeoning study of interpersonal emotional influence processes\nshould follow a similar trajectory.\nDifferent researchers have certainly used the terms \"social\nappraisal\" and \"social referencing\" in a variety of overlapping\nsenses. Although both concepts consistently refer to interac-\ntions in which one person's emotion influences another per-\nson's evaluative orientation to an object or event, these\ninteractions can involve a range of processes, and these pro-\ncesses can serve a range of functions. The extent to which the\nprocesses and functions need to be distinguished depends on\nthe agenda guiding the research in question. When the theoreti-\ncal goal is to characterize the spectrum of interpersonal pro-\ncesses whereby people acquire information about the affective\nsignificance of events, it makes sense to make corresponding\ndistinctions (e.g., Cl\u00e9ment & Dukes, 2017). When the theoreti-\ncal goal is to uncover unifying principles underlying the devel-\nopment of interpersonal emotional influence, continuities\nrather than discontinuities start to seem more important (Walle,\nMy research (e.g., Parkinson, Simons, & Niven, 2016)\nmainly focuses on real-time interactions in which adult \"know-\ners\" and \"learners\" repeatedly switch roles and where influence\noperates dynamically and bidirectionally. In these contexts,\neach person's attention can shift rapidly from a referential object\nto the other person, or to the relation between self and other, or\nbetween self or other and object. For example, a wife expresses\nworry about her ability to cope with a current concern, and her\nhusband may orient at different moments to the concern, his\nwife, her orientation to him, and to the concern (e.g., Parkinson\n& Simons, 2012). Each partner may strategically regulate some\naspects of their emotional orientation, while other (often simul-\ntaneous) processes of mutual adjustment operate at less explicit\nlevels (e.g., Parkinson & Simons, 2009).\nI use the flexible term \"relation alignment\" (e.g., Parkinson,\n2008) to capture the variety of emotional influence processes\noperating during these interactions. Relation alignment\nincludes social appraisal along with other forms of interper-\nsonal adjustment that do not depend on explicit communica-\ntion or transfer of appraisal information. For me, social\nreferencing is an even more specific concept covering a par-\nticular form of interaction in which one person actively seeks\nout clarificatory evaluative information from another person.\nThis evaluative information then affects the second person's\nbehaviour by a process of social appraisal. In other words,\nboth social appraisal and social referencing imply interper-\nsonal information transfer and communication of emotional\nmeaning, whereas relation alignment can operate prior to, and\nas part of, the production of emotional meaning.\nMore basic forms of relation alignment also seem to precede\nthe acquisition of social appraisal and social referencing in\ndeveloping children. Infants adjust to (e.g., Stern, Hofer, Haft,\negivers' emotions before they begin to represent the relational\nmeaning of those emotions in terms of appraisal (Parkinson,\n2007). Indeed, some of the earliest forms of infant\u00adcaregiver\ninteraction involve regulation of direct relations between inter-\nactants rather than their respective orientations towards any ref-\nerential object. Social referencing probably depends on\nsubsequent co-ordination of this more directly interpersonal\nrelation alignment with the development of shared attention\ntowards objects.\nDespite its potential reducibility to a definitional dispute, the\nold affective primacy debate at least served to draw attention to\nCorresponding author: Brian Parkinson, Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX1 3UD, UK.\nEmail: brian.parkinson@psy.ox.ac.uk\nemotion-related phenomena that did not depend on prior\ngeneration of explicit meaning. Similarly, I want to argue that\nwhatever forms of \"cognition,\" \"appraisal,\" or \"social referenc-\ning\" characterize the earliest and most basic instances of rela-\ntion alignment, they do not necessarily involve ostension or the\nactive extraction of appraisal information. Mutual orientations\ncan adjust to one another, and their interpersonal consolidation\nat some point produces emergent emotional meanings (e.g.,\nFogel, 1993), which need not be registered as such by either\nparty to the exchange.\nFunding\nWork on this commentary was supported by the Economic and Social\nand Social Motives (CASM).\"\nReferences\nCl\u00e9ment, F., & Dukes, D.
