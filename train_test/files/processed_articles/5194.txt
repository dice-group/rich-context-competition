By zeroing\nin on the interaction between these two actors, we aim to find the discretionary decision that\nmatters the most in terms of explaining the crimmigration practices, offering a more holistic and\ninterdisciplinary approach to border control.

Large numbers of immigrants are try-\ning to find their ways into Fortress Europe irrespective of the dangers of such an under-\ntaking and the insecure future ahead of them, often fleeing desperate situations in their\nhome countries. Against the background of an ongoing securitization of migration in\ning the European mainland has led to heated debates among politicians and policy-\nmakers, on both the member state level and the EU level, on how to best deal with the\nmatter. Solutions are sought in the militarization of the external borders, border fences,\nand extensive yet also dispersed border surveillance (Aas, 2011). Much of the scholar-\nship on EU border matters seems to focus on the external border of the EU, whereas\ndevelopments affecting the formally non-existing internal borders between EU member\nstates remain relatively understudied. Obviously, the tragedies happening at the EU's\nexternal borders justify attention. Yet, given what the EU stands for \u00ad being an area with-\nout internal borders in order to stimulate the free flow of services, goods, and people \u00ad\nmonitoring what is happening in internal border areas is as crucial. In response to the\nrecent immigration influx, several member states have asked for internal border checks\nto be temporarily reinstalled, which would be a fundamental breach of the Schengen\nacquis. Other states have started to explore the possibility offered by the Schengen\nBorders Code to conduct highly discretionary random police checks \u00adfor reasons of both\nimmigration control and/or crime control \u00ad in 20 kilometer internal border areas between\ntwo member states (Van der Woude, 2015).\nThese police checks taking place in internal border areas are highly relevant in the\nlight of the process of crimmigration (Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015) \u00ad the\nincreased merger of crime control and immigration control (Aliverti, 2014; Chac\u00f3n,\nphysically, borders are primary sites for authorities to distinguish between so-called\n`bona fide travelers'and `crimmigrant others', being a bridge for the former and a barrier\nBerlo, 2015).The growing body of scholarship studying practices of crimmigration\nseems to paint a rather grim picture: to a greater or a lesser extent, crimmigration seems\nto be present in many national contexts, with no exception for countries in the EU\nDespite the different macro-level explanations that can account for the process of crim-\nmigration, many scholars directly or indirectly refer to the central role of discretionary\ndecision-making. Discretion allows law enforcement officials to make largely autono-\nmous decisions \u00ad to exercise choice \u00ad on how to deal with an individual case. In cases in\nwhich immigrants are involved this may also include the decision on whether to treat or\napproach it as a criminal case or an immigration case, with far-reaching consequences\nattached. When examining the literature on discretion and crimmigration, much of it\nseems to focus on explaining why and how the actions of one specific actor contribute to\nthe practice of crimmigration: police and/or immigration officers (Motomura, 2011;\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 29\n2012), etc. Although some scholars discuss the actions of several actors in their commen-\ntaries (Miller, 2005; Stumpf, 2015), little attention is being paid to the ways in which\ndiscretionary decisions made by different actors might relate to, interact with, or depend\nupon each other. Thereby the image might arise that the practice of crimmigration is to be\nseen as an outcome of discretionary decisions made by one sole actor and that it is mostly\ndriven by decisions made on the enforcement level.\nCentral focus and scope\nThis article will argue that a multi-actor assessment of discretionary decision-making,\nincluding also discretionary decisions made on the legislative and policy level (Schneider,\n1992) can contribute to a better understanding of the implementation of crimmigration.\nSuch an understanding \u00ad both in terms of why it is happening, but also in terms of how\nthis implementation takes shape \u00ad is important in the light of exploring ways in which the\nprocess and its often unjust outcomes could be subverted. This article will mostly focus\non the how by looking at actual practices of crimmigration and how discretion is used to\nsort and regulate mobility through the criminalization frame. In doing so, the article will\nfocus upon the police checks carried out in the EU's internal border areas. The ways in\nwhich member states give substance to these often highly discretionary police checks as\nallowed under the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) can differ greatly both in terms of the\nlegal and policy framework as well as in terms of practical enforcement, with differences\nin the implementation of crimmigration as a result.\nThis article will use the Netherlands \u00ad both an EU and a Schengen member \u00ad as a case\nstudy. This is a crucial case because the Dutch government has already formalized the\nSchengen-proof police checks by introducing the Mobile Security Monitor (MSM),\ncomprising time-limited immigration controls carried out by the Royal Netherlands\nMarechaussee (RNM, in Dutch: Koninklijke Marechaussee). In border areas, Dutch\nRNM officers are allowed to stop any vehicle or person to check their ID and legal status\nunder the Aliens Act, the central body of immigration law in the Netherlands, together\nwith the Aliens Decree and the 2012 Police Act. A reasonable suspicion of any criminal\nactivity or unauthorized entry or stay is not necessarily needed, which implies a lower\nthreshold for these controls compared with regular police checks. By following the dis-\ncretionary decisions that govern the MSM, this article aims to shed further light on the\nquestion of what the core and contingent discretionary decision(s) is/are behind the pro-\ncess of crimmigration in the context of immigration control in the internal border areas\nof the Netherlands.\nThis question falls within the scope of a larger research project `Crimmigration &\nDiscretionary Decision-making in EU Internal Border Areas'.1 We will draw from the\nlegal and empirical data collected as part of this project. Whereas previous publications\nderived from this project have focused more on the higher-level policy and administra-\ntive decision-making with regard to the Dutch immigration controls in border areas\n(Dekkers et al., in press; Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015), this article will also\ninclude data from focus group interviews and informal interviews and chats that were\ncarried out during ride-alongs reflecting the perceptions of RNM officials with regard to\nthe scope of their discretionary space. Although we also collected observational data\nduring the ride-alongs that provide insight into the practices on the ground, the actual\napplication of their discretionary space, this article explicitly aims to address the percep-\ntion of discretion in the context of the MSM. By analyzing the discretion created on the\nlegislative and policy level and comparing it with the perceived discretion on the enforce-\nment level, we aim to shed light on whose decisions seem to matter most in fueling crim-\nmigration practices.\nConceptualizing discretion\nAs a result of fundamental changes in the nature of modern society, the state is called\nupon to intervene in many areas of social life and the issues that have to be grappled with\nthe diversity and the complexity of problems that states have to deal with in modern\nsociety require a flexible approach. In order to meet the demands that are being made on\nthe modern state, discretion, rather than fine-grained rules, appears to be a more adequate\nmechanism for exercising power. Street-level bureaucrats, defined here as personnel of\ncriminal justice agencies who have regular direct contact with members of the public\n(such as police officers or probation officers), are the final implementers of public policy.\nTheir jobs are inherently discretionary and influence people's lives (Lipsky, 2010;\nwith failure to meet the most basic requirements of justice (that is, that decisions should\nbe fair and not arbitrary) it is recognized that a certain amount of discretion can bring\npositive benefits'. In other words, by enabling decision-makers to mitigate the unin-\ntended outcomes of the application of rules in individual cases, discretion can contribute\nto justice (Schneider, 1992). Obviously, it is precisely this flexibility with regard to\napplying the rules that makes discretion susceptible to misuse and abuse, potentially\ncontributing to injustice, for instance by favoring certain social groups over others. This\nbrings us to the core concept in discretion: choice. For discretion to exist, an official must\nbe given power, within a broad framework, either to choose the end that is to be pursued,\nor, if the end has already been determined, to choose the most appropriate means or\nstandard to achieve the end. How much discretion official have will depend on the nature\nof their professional power and the recognition that other officials give to their ability to\nchoose (Mensah, 1998; Van der Leun, 2006). Having said this, it is important to realize\nthe important role the legislature and policy-makers play in allocating discretion. The\nvery heart of the discretionary process lies within legislative and policy decisions since\nit involves decisions about the objectives and meaning of the law, and about how these\nare to be shaped into strategies to permit their interpretation (Galligan, 1986). According\nto Schneider (1992), discretion is deliberately built in to decision-making systems by\nlaw-makers for a variety of reasons.\nThe dominant focus in social science studies on discretion is on street-level decisions,\nbut this does not do justice to the reality that they should always be seen as part of a\nsequence of decisions and occurring as part of a network of relationships in the legal\ndecisions quite often involve a rather more complex series of decisions. The `output' for\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 31\none actor within a system often provides the `input' for another (Hawkins, 1992, 2003;\nquestion of whose discretionary decisions matter most in fueling the practice of crim-\nmigration in the case of the Dutch MSM checks, the remainder of this article will adopt\na more systemic approach towards discretion by focusing on both the discretion built in\nto the legal and policy framework of the MSM and the `enforcement discretion' as per-\nceived by RNM officials.\nSuch a systemic approach towards discretion gives room for the possibility \u00ad and\noften reality \u00ad that effective powers to decide are frequently assumed by actors other than\nthe person allocated formal authority to exercise discretion and diffused among a variety\nof actors who all play a part in the handling of an individual case. In doing so we will use\nthe simple yet functional conceptualization of discretion as put forward by Bushway and\nForst (2013).They distinguish between what they refer to as `Type A' and `Type B' dis-\ncretion. Type A discretion refers to the discretion that individual actors have to make\ndecisions with variation given a set of rules and Type B refers to the discretion that leg-\nislators and criminal justice policy-makers have to establish a set of rules. The choice by\nlegislators to impose sentencing guidelines is an act of Type B discretion; the legally\nallowable choice by judges of sentences within the sentencing guideline ranges is an act\nof Type A discretion. Type B discretion, the ability to create rules and policies, can be\nused to limit and shape Type A discretion and there is often a tension between the rules\nset by higher-level, administrative actors (Type B) and the discretion within those rules\nthat is available to lower(street)-level actors, responsible for the actual enforcement of\nthe rules. Most discussion in the literature deals with Type A discretion, yet, according to\nBushway and Forst (2013), both Type B discretion and the interaction between A and B\ndeserve more direct study in criminal justice. The same could be said for scholarship on\ncrimmigration.\nCrimmigration and discretion\nCrimmigration is often explained by referring to underlying trends such as over-criminal-\nization \u00ad the frequently deplored tendency of criminal law to expand into areas for which\nits heavy-handed machinery seems ill suited (Sklansky, 2012), the emergence of an over-\nall cultural obsession with security and potential dangerous `others' (Garland, 2001;\nSimon, 2007), and the development of an enemy penology (Fekete and Webber, 2010).\nDespite acknowledging the clear complexity and multitude of forces driving the process\nof crimmigration, Motomura (2011) claims that the discretion to stop persons is the\nstrongest driver behind the process of crimmigration, since it enables racial profiling and\nmakes street-level officers responsible for funneling immigrants into systems dealing\nwith immigration crime or criminal violations. His assessment of the pivotal importance\nof street-level decision-making in the process of crimmigration is widely shared among\nscholars, who often link it to selectivity based on racial stereotypes (Hernandez, 2013;\nAlthough the process of racial profiling by law enforcement officials is unmistakably\nconnected with the process of crimmigration, it is unclear whether it can explain the\nprocess or whether it is an outcome of it, or both. The answer to this question depends on\nwhether one approaches immigration control from a bottom up or a top down modus\n(Lind, 2015). In line with Motomura's assessment, the bottom up modus attributes power\nto the (Type A) decisions made on the street level. Yet, in their assessment of the crimi-\nnalization of migration, Provine and Doty (2011) observe that policy responses to unau-\nthorized immigration reinforce racialized anxieties by creating new discretionary spaces\nof enforcement within which racial anxieties flourish and become institutionalized. In\nother words, although they do acknowledge the impact of racial anxiety on the enforce-\nment level, potentially leading to racial profiling, they rather see this as the outcome of\ntop down (Type B) policy-level decisions.\nAccording to Sklansky (2012), practices of crimmigration cannot be seen apart from\nthe more general tendency towards ad hoc instrumentalism that is visible within both\ncriminal and administrative law. He defines ad hoc instrumentalism as `a manner of\nthinking about law and legal institutions that downplays concerns about consistency and\nplaces little stock in formal legal categories, but instead sees legal rules and legal proce-\ndures simply as a set of interchangeable tools. In any given situation, faced with any\ngiven problem, officials are encouraged to use whichever tools are most effective against\nthe person or persons causing the problem'(Sklansky, 2012: 161). The underlying ration-\nale behind practices of crimmigration seems to fit in with this tendency. In order to iden-\ntify dangerous individuals \u00ad immigrants and criminals both fitting this category \u00ad a\nhybrid web of social control is spun in such a way that street-level law enforcement\nofficials can choose between their criminal and administrative (immigration law) pow-\ners. Whichever route they take \u00ad crime control or migration control \u00ad doesn't really mat-\nder Woude et al., 2014). Although Sklansky also attributes an important role to street-\nlevel decisions in driving practices of crimmigration, in line with Provine and Doty\n(2011), he explicitly places street-level actions in the dynamics of broader changes in the\ngovernance of crime and migration and therewith of (Type B) decisions made in higher\nlegislative and policy echelons.\nIt seems safe to say that, although there is consensus in the literature that crimmigra-\ntion and discretion are somehow related, there are different views as to whether it is more\na top down or a bottom up connection, or possibly both. We take these differing views on\nwhat is driving crimmigration practices as a theoretical angle to study discretion in inter-\nnal border control in Dutch border areas empirically at different levels.\nMethodology\nThe present study uses a mixed methods research design, combining a policy discourse\nanalysis, informal interviews (held during ride-alongs with the border police), and semi-\nstructured focus group interviews. A key feature of mixed methods research is its meth-\nodological pluralism, which offers the advantage of incorporating the strengths of\ndifferent methodological strategies. Data were collected between October 2013 and\nFirst a discourse analysis was conducted on the basis of the Dutch parliamentary\ndebate as laid down in policy documents accessed through all relevant digital data-\nbases. Using key words, a total of 451 documents were found in the databases, of\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 33\nwhich 259 documents contained relevant information and were used in the analysis.\nWith regard to the upper echelons of the assumed chain of discretionary decision-\nmaking in matters of immigration checks in border areas \u00ad the level of the EU, the\nnational legislature, and policy-makers \u00ad we will draw from the results of this analysis,\nwhich were supplemented with the outcomes of a legal analysis of (supra)national\nlegislation and jurisprudence (Dekkers et al., in press; Van der Woude and Van Berlo,\nSecondly, in order to study street-level perceptions of discretionary decision-making,\nprimary data were collected through informal conversations with border police officers\nthree researchers went on 57 ride-alongs with border patrol officers who were exercising\ntheir discretionary powers in the context of the Mobile Security Monitor, during which\nthey were able to observe and talk about the MSM checks, the use and scope of discre-\ntionary powers, and the work of the border patrol in general. These ride-alongs were\ncarried out at the seven RNM brigades that are responsible for carrying out the MSM in\nthe border area with Belgium and Germany. All brigades were visited at least six times\nfor ride-along sessions, with extra ride-alongs carried out at the larger brigades.Although\nsome RNM officials did show some slight distrust when the researchers went on their\nfirst ride-along with them, a thorough explanation of the scope of the research, with an\nemphasis on the fact that the researchers were independent and not hired by the RNM to\ncheck on the street-level RNM officials, would often result in a relaxed atmosphere in\nwhich the RNM officials were more than willing to share their views. This feeling of\ntrust was only further enhanced by the fact that the researchers returned to a brigade\nmultiple times. This, combined with the informal nature of the conversations and the\nfamiliar setting, decreased the chance of politically correct answers (Finch et al., 2013;\nKrueger, 1994; Krueger and Casey, 2009). In the present article we do not use the obser-\nvation data, but we do draw from the informal interviews.\nThirdly, focus group interviews were conducted to gather more in-depth information\non specific subjects related to discretion and street-level decision-making in the context\nof the MSM. Focus group interviews are useful for exploring and examining what people\nthink, how they think, and why they think the way they do about the issues of importance\nto them without pressuring them into making decisions or reaching a consensus. Focus\ngroups permit researchers to search for the reasons why particular views are held by\nindividuals and groups. The method also provides insight into the similarities and differ-\nences of understandings held by people (Krueger, 1994; Krueger and Casey, 2009; Finch\nover all seven brigades, resulting in 25 hours of conversation. All focus groups consisted\nof a mixture of experienced and less experienced border patrol officers who were all car-\nrying out MSM checks as part of their duties. During most focus groups, all RNM offi-\ncials who were present participated in the discussion, some more actively than others,\nwhich is one of the most important limitations of focus group interviews (Krueger and\nCasey, 2009). Yet, knowing this pitfall, the moderator directly intervened in such\ninstances. Being a military organization, it was mostly the younger and often less expe-\nrienced or less highly ranked officials who kept somewhat of a low profile. Again, when\nnoticed by the moderator, these officials would be explicitly asked to respond.\nThe discourse analysis resulted in 259 documents selected to be analyzed. Valuable\ninformation from the ride-alongs and the informal conversations were recorded in the\nresearcher's field notes. After the shifts, these field notes were written down in a\ndetailed and structured manner in order to be coded. The focus group interviews were\naudiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and also coded. All data were analyzed with soft-\nware for qualitative analysis Atlas-Ti. As mentioned above, the observations will be\nreported on elsewhere. Access for this unique long-term and intensive research pro-\nject was obtained after a series of meetings taking place over the course of two years\nduring which the project coordinator reached an agreement with the RNM and the\nMinistry of Security and Justice. The agreement was formalized by a written covenant\nin which the independent position of the researchers and privacy issues were dealt\nwith. As part of the covenant, an external advisory board of academic experts and\nofficials working for the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of Defence\nwas established.\nDiscretionary decisions and the implementation of\ncrimmigration\nBased on secondary research of the legal and policy context of immigration and border\ncontrol as well as on primary empirical research with regard to the way in which Dutch\nborder patrol officers perceive their task and their discretionary space, this section aims\nto shed further light on the way in which the various levels of discretionary decision-\nmaking relate to each other at both the national and the European (the supranational)\nlevel. At both levels, Type B discretionary decisions can be made. By leaving room for\nmember states to decide how to interpret or how to implement certain EU rules or direc-\ntives, discretionary space is created on the supranational level. Yet member states also\nmake Type B discretionary decisions by translating political and policy goals into the\nrules and regulations that in turn govern street-level officials. The first two subsections\nare based on the outcomes of the analysis of legal and policy documents, and subsection\n3 draws from the data collected through the focus group interviews.\nCreating discretionary space on the European level\nWhen researching immigration controls carried out in the border areas between EU\nmember states, the point of departure for exploring discretionary decisions that might\nhave contributed to the process of crimmigration is obviously the 1985 Schengen\nAgreement. This agreement proposed the gradual abolition of border checks at the sig-\nnatories' common borders. In addition, the agreement included sections dealing with\nthe harmonization of visa and asylum policies, the common fight against drug-related\ncrime, and increased controls at the EU's external borders. The rules that govern the\nmovement of persons across the Schengen borders can be found in the Schengen\nBorders Code (SBC) as adopted in 2006. The SBC sets out the standards and procedures\nto be followed in controlling the movement of persons across internal and external\nSchengen borders and should thus offer clear guidelines for border patrol agents on how\nto perform their duties.\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 35\nAccording to Article 22 SBC, `[i]nternal borders may be crossed at any point without\na border check on persons, irrespective of their nationality, being carried out'.According\nto the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, this provision means that any control, whether systematic\nor by spot-checks, carried out solely for the reason of crossing an internal border, is\nincompatible with the idea of a single area without borders, and is therefore prohibited.2\nNevertheless, Article 23(a) SBC makes clear that lifting border controls does not mean\ngiving up all forms of control in border areas: `The abolition of border control at inter-\nnal borders shall not affect the exercise of police powers by the competent authorities of\nthe Member States under national law, insofar as the exercise of those powers does not\nhave an effect equivalent to border checks.' Border checks, according to Article 2(10)\nSBC, are `checks carried out at border crossing points, to ensure that persons, including\ntheir means of transport and the objects in their possession, may be authorized to enter\nthe territory of the Member States or authorized to leave it'. Following this definition,\npolice checks are not allowed at the actual internal border between two member states\nbut they can be carried out in the area around the border. As Article 23(a iii) SBC further\nstates, the aim of the police checks will `in particular' be to combat cross-border crime.\nLooking at the SBC, it seems safe to say that it creates discretionary space for member\nstates to autonomously decide how they want to carry out police checks, where, for how\nlong, and with what aim. This might be considered as problematic, or at least remarka-\nble, given the `freedom of movement' and the lifting of formal border control as one of\nthe key features of the European Project. These ambiguities in the SBC demonstrate that\nmuch of the actual implementation of these police checks has been left to the discretion\nof member states.\nThe problematic nature of the vagueness of Article 23 SBC was affirmed by two\nimportant cases that were brought before the Court of Justice for the EU (CJEU). In the\ngoverning police checks carried out in France (Melki & Abdeli) and in the Netherlands\n(Adil) was contested in the light of the right to free movement as represented by Articles\n22 and 23 SBC. In both cases the Court ruled that, in order to comply with Articles 22\nand 23(a) of the SBC, national legislation granting a power to police authorities to carry\nout identity checks must provide the necessary framework for the power granted to those\nauthorities in order, inter alia, to guide the discretion that those authorities enjoy in the\npractical application of that power. In order to guarantee that that the practical exercise\nof that power, consisting in carrying out identity controls, would not have an effect\nequivalent to border checks, the national framework should contain detailed rules and\nlimitations in order to define the intensity, frequency, and selectivity of the checks. A\nfurther explanation or guideline as to how detailed the national legal framework should\nbe on these three matters, or how these three rather general concepts should be inter-\npreted in the light of open borders, was not given by the CJEU or by the European\nCommission in response to the two rulings.\nIn sum, guidance with regard to the way in which member states legally formalize\nlet alone practically shape the Schengen-proof police checks is limited. This can be seen\nas an example of what Schneider (1992) refers to as rule-compromise discretion: discre-\ntion intentionally built in to the decision-making systems of member states as a result of\ngeneral EU norms. This allows member states to shape their national legislation in such\na way that it can do justice to the specific demographic, institutional, legal, etc. charac-\nteristics. The responsibility to meet the requirements of the SBC is intentionally passed\nto the national legislator since it would be impossible for the supranational rule-makers\nto come up with an all-encompassing legal framework that would fit all member states.\nCreating discretionary space on the national level\nThe Dutch government was one of the first to sign and implement the Schengen\nAgreement, yet it was also one of the first to introduce a form of police control in the\nborder areas. The easing of internal borders under the Schengen Agreement had the par-\nliament worried, leading to the implementation of the Mobile Aliens Monitor (MAM).5\nThe original goal of the Monitor, as stated in a 1994 letter by the State Secretary, was `to\nprevent illegal entry and irregular stay of aliens'.6 The Monitor was seen as an important\ntool to stop unwanted immigrants at the border and to discourage prospective immigrants\nfrom coming to the Netherlands without legal authorization. The chosen aim is interest-\ning in the light of the parameters set by the SBC. As mentioned in the previous section,\nthe SBC (Article 23[a iii]) explicitly states that police checks in border areas are particu-\nlarly meant to combat cross-border crime. Controlling immigration or immigration-\nrelated crime is not mentioned at all.\nOver the course of the years it became clear that RNM officers also ran into certain\nforms of cross-border crimes while performing the MAM, human smuggling and iden-\ntity fraud being the two most important. These crimes did not formally fall under the\nscope of Monitor because it was \u00ad and still is \u00ad predominantly meant as an instrument of\nimmigration control, legally founded in the Dutch Aliens Act and the Aliens Decree.\nWhen encountering a case of human smuggling or identity fraud \u00ad phenomena falling\nunder the scope of the criminal law \u00ad RNM officers immediately had to delegate these\ncases to the national police since they themselves were unauthorized to deal further with\nthe case. Since this course of events was seen as inefficient and frustrating, the Dutch\nlegislature in 2006 decided to formally expand the powers of the border patrol while\nexercising the MAM by amending the Dutch Police Act. From that year on, RNM offi-\ncials were legally allowed not only to use their discretionary powers for the purposes of\nimmigration control, but also to check for the allegedly immigration-related crimes of\nhuman smuggling and identity fraud.7\nThe expansion in the scope of the MAM seemed to bring it more in line with the lan-\nguage of Article 23 SBC, which clearly speaks of police checks carried out to combat\ncross-border crime. From a crimmigration perspective, the expansion can be seen as\nproblematic because it attributes powers of both crime control and immigration control\nto one actor: the RNM official having to enforce the MSM. Although the legislature\nseems to have put a clear limitation on the discretionary powers of the RNM officials by\nlimiting their crime control powers strictly to cases of human smuggling and identity\nfraud, no accountability structure was put in place to ensure that RNM officials in the\nfield would also interpret and apply their newly acquired tasks this restrictively.\nThis missing accountability structure seems particularly concerning in the light of a\nshift in the political discourse on border security in the Netherlands. Starting in 2010,\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 37\nofficial policy documents all of sudden spoke of the Mobile Security Monitor instead of\nthe Mobile Aliens Monitor without there being any changes in the formal discretionary\npowers of RNM officials, as seemed to be suggested by this new name.8 The reason for\nthe name change was addressed in a letter from the Minister for Immigration, Integration\nand Asylum.9 The minister explained that, during the MSM checks, criminal offenses\nwere often encountered that made these checks an important tool not just for immigration\npurposes but also for combating crime. The fact that the latter was still legally limited to\ncrimes of human smuggling and identity fraud was conveniently left out. Although the\nname change was presented as merely cosmetic, in the light of finding decisions that\nmight have influenced the practice of crimmigration enforcement and the perceptions of\nRNM officials in the field, it seems very significant.\nContrary to the formal expansion suggested by the name change, the use of the MSM\nwas legally restricted in 2011, this time by a formal change of the Dutch Aliens Decree\n(Article 4.17a) in response to the ruling of the CJEU in the previously mentioned Melki\n& Abdeli case.10 Whereas, prior to the ruling, the MSM was not restricted in terms of\ntime and location, the restrictions limited the MSM checks on the road to a maximum of\n6 hours a day and 90 hours a month. Whereas the obligation to define the intensity and\nfrequency of the MSM checks in the national legislative framework has been rather\nexplicitly met by the Dutch legislature by setting clear numerical limits, this cannot be\nsaid for the third aspect mentioned in the Melki & Abdeli ruling: the decision to select a\nperson or a vehicle for a check. Although the CJEU asked for `detailed rules and limita-\ntions defining the selectivity of the checks', Article 4.17a of the Dutch Aliens Decree\nmerely states that `only a part of the passing vehicles will be stopped'. By not addressing\nspecific criteria for selection, the decision to select a vehicle for an MSM check is com-\npletely left to the discretion of the RNM official in the field, making this decision of the\nDutch legislature a good example of rule-binding discretion deliberately built in to the\ndecision-making system (Schneider, 1992). This type of discretion recognizes the value\nof practical experience and knowledge of street-level decision-makers in deciding,\nwithin the framework of the law, how to respond in a certain situation. In our case this\nmeans that a high level of trust is attributed to the professional intuition and experience\nof RNM officials in selecting cars for an MSM check.\nIn line with the observations on the supranational legal framework, can the national\nlegal framework regulating the MSM also be characterized as highly discretionary, espe-\ncially with regard to the key question of how the selection for the MSM checks is made\nby individual RNM officials? This question is important not just because of heated pub-\nlic and academic discussions on ethnic \u00ad or racial \u00ad profiling by law enforcement offi-\ncials in general, but also because of the seemingly ambiguous scope of the Monitor as a\nresult of the name change, combined with the partial expansion towards also becoming\nan instrument of crime control. To what extent did these changes affect the way RNM\nofficials perceive the MSM and their discretionary power?\nStreet-level perceptions of discretionary decision-making in border areas\nThe previous two subsections have dealt with decisions taken on the legislative and\npolicy level that create discretion for street-level RNM officials. By drawing from the\ndata collected during the focus group interviews, this subsection will address the percep-\ntions of RNM officials of their discretionary powers under the MSM. Two of the core\nquestions of the focus group interviews \u00ad `What is the aim of the MSM?' and `What do\nyou see as your most important task?' \u00ad often resulted in very lively discussions and\nimportant insights into the way in which RNM officers perceived their discretionary\npower.\nAlthough the majority of the respondents mentioned that the MSM was meant as an\ninstrument of immigration control, and therefore combating unauthorized stay (com-\nmonly referred to as illegal stay) was the main reason to perform these checks, a large\npart of these respondents also added that, `besides combating illegal stay, the MSM is\nalso meant to combat cross-border crime'. When asked to specify cross-border crime, it\nwas interesting to hear that a fair number of the respondents also included crimes such as\ndrug trafficking, money laundering, and gun offenses.\n`The police is responsible for the security in the streets, the RNM is responsible for the safety\nand security of the state. That also includes catching folks who are dangerous due to carrying\nweapons or drugs across the border.'\nAs mentioned previously, RNM officials have the authority to actively look for cross-\nborder crimes during the MSM. Nevertheless, this authority is limited only to human\nsmuggling and identity fraud as `migration-related' forms of cross-border crime. When\nthis legal limitation was mentioned by the moderator, respondents would often start\nquestioning whether this limitation was legitimate and effective in their eyes. These dis-\ncussions would in the end always come back to the 2010 name change from Mobile\nAliens Monitor to Mobile Security Monitor.\n`In the early 90s it was clear that we could only use the powers attributed to us by the Aliens\nAct, but the goal at the time was to combat illegal immigration. Over time, society has changed,\ncrime has changed and they changed the name into Mobile Security Monitor and much more\npriority was given to catching criminal illegal immigrants.'\nDuring every focus group, respondents mentioned that the name change resulted in some\nconfusion at the street level. Although the majority of the respondents were very aware\nof the fact that the name change had not formally resulted in an expansion of their dis-\ncretionary powers, a small portion of the respondents was not. They were under the\nimpression that the MSM could be used as a fully fledged instrument of crime control\nafter the name change and that it was no longer restricted to human smuggling and iden-\ntity fraud.\n`In the 20 kilometer zone around the border you're no longer specifically focusing on illegal\nimmigration, you're also focusing on safety and security ... which means that you also pay\nattention to money laundering and stuff like that.'\nInterestingly enough, all the respondents thought it necessary to indeed expand the\nlegal framework of the MSM to all forms of cross-border crime, since that would be\nmore in line with their daily practices and with the image of the MSM as presented to the\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 39\ngeneral public. Many respondents expressed feelings of frustration with regard to the\ncurrent state of their powers. These frustrations were often motivated by addressing the\nfact that, `in the end, we're the frontline of defense for the Netherlands' or by the fact\nthat, `whereas the national police is for defending the streets, we're here to defend the\nnation-state, that's quite different'. Two respondents aptly capture the broadly shared\nfeelings of frustration and incomprehension:\n`When you are checking a car and immigration-wise everything is fine, they have the right\npapers etc., that obviously doesn't mean that they cannot have someone or something illegal\nlying in the trunk. Officially, your hands are tied because their IDs and paperwork were fine.\nUnder these circumstances, the Aliens Act forces you to let them go. But the thing is, you are\nstanding there to secure the safety of the Netherlands. With that in mind, it is strange that you\nare legally restricted from fully checking a car.'\n`We're located in these border areas and the name is Mobile Security Monitor. We're the first\nones to guarantee the security of the Netherlands, that's the focus of our organization. And if\nthat's your target, to monitor the security in the Netherlands while also saying that I cannot use\nmy powers to combat crime because that's not why I am here... Well, hello, I need to know who\nis entering my country? I need to create a secure situation, which is my task isn't it?'\nThe frustration about the ambiguous aim of the MSM also contributed to the notewor-\nthy situation of RNM officials actively exploring the boundaries of the legal framework.\nAs many respondents stated, although the name change had not resulted in an expansion\nof the legal framework, it seemed to imply that this was something to which the RNM as\nan organization aspired. Therefore, many respondents admitted that this provoked `being\ncreative' with their powers. `Being creative' referred to situations in which RNM offi-\ncials intentionally overstepped the discretionary powers attributed to them under the\nAliens Act by using them \u00ad or abusing them \u00ad for reasons of crime control. Several RNM\nofficials \u00ad also including some higher ranked officers \u00ad expressed the necessity of seek-\ning out the limits of the law in order to create case law that could eventually lead to more\nclarity about the implications of the name change for street-level decision-making. This\nsituation, where there seems to be a push from the street level to the policy level to make\nlegal potentially illegal practices that are part of the system (Davis, 1971), is characteris-\ntic of rule-binding discretion. And, as we established in the previous subsection, the\ndiscretionary space created by the Dutch legislature allowing RNM officials to rather\nautonomously decide which cars to stop and check can be characterized as such.\nFrom a crimmigration perspective it is important to note the ease with which immi-\ngration and crime were being lumped together in the focus group interviews, even by\nthose respondents who were well aware of the fact that the MSM was formally predomi-\nnantly meant to combat unauthorized stay in the Netherlands. These discussions were\noften related to the alleged `proven' links between illegal border crossings and cross-\nborder crime (`if you have nothing to hide, there's no need for false paperwork') or\nalleged connections between migration and terrorism. According to the large majority of\nthe respondents, the presence of the RNM in the border areas was of great importance in\ncurrent times of mass migration and terrorism. With some exceptions, the dominant dis-\ncourse around the MSM was clearly a discourse of safety and security in which\nimmigration was seen as a factor potentially threatening security. As Van der Woude\net al. (2014) note, besides actual laws and policies, an important marker of the process of\ncrimmigration is the way in which issues relating to crime and immigration are perceived\nand framed on the social and the policy level, but in terms of explaining crimmigration\npractices.\nCrimmigration checks in the EU's internal border areas?\nThis article has sought to shed light on the influence of discretionary decisions on the\nprocess of crimmigration, by distinguishing between discretionary decisions taken on\nvarious levels and by different actors. The often heard claim or assumption that street-\nlevel officials are the most important drivers in the crimmigration process has not been\nempirically verified in the case of the Netherlands. Our study suggests that the culprits in\nthe merger of crime control and migration control are to be found in the upper echelons\nof criminal justice decision-making. Based on the outcomes of this study, Type B deci-\nsions made at both the European and the national level seem to play a more important\nrole in the process of crimmigration than Type A \u00ad street-level \u00ad decisions by RNM\nofficials. By leaving much room for interpretation of the legal framework \u00ad both for\nmember states on how to translate the Schengen Borders Code into their national legisla-\ntion and for RNM officials on how to interpret the national legal framework of the MSM\n\u00ad favorable conditions are created for crimmigration practices. This is especially the case\nsince Dutch RNM officials are by law equipped with both immigration control and spe-\ncific crime control powers while enforcing the MSM.\nAlthough the use of their crime control powers is formally limited to specific situa-\ntions, the joint political and organizational \u00ad Type B \u00ad decision to change the name of\nthe Monitor has suggested a broader application. As the empirical research has shown,\nthis leads to confusion and sometimes frustration at the street level. RNM officials\nincreasingly seem to focus on crime control while they are performing the MSM and\nthey feel legitimized to do so by the name change, which also seems to have fueled\nexisting perceptions of the links between crime and migration. They also perceive a\nlarge amount of discretionary space while enforcing the RNM in a crime- and immigra-\ntion-oriented manner.\nAt the same time, it should be realized that there can be a gap between what people\nsay \u00ad during interviews \u00ad and what people do in practice. In order to truly grasp the way\nin which RNM officials enforce their discretionary powers and how this might contrib-\nute to the practice of crimmigration, it is necessary to observe their decision-making\nprocesses over a long period of time, which is another part of our study that is not\nreported on here. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the implicit or explicit claim\nthat street-level officials are the most important drivers in crimmigration needs to be\nnuanced. Owing to the formulation of open norms on the supranational and national\nlevels, discretionary space is consciously introduced into the decision-making scheme\ngoverning the MSM. Time limitations do not fundamentally limit this space. Although\nthe discretionary decisions most visibly reflecting crimmigration practices might be\ntaken on the street level, the foundation for these decisions was laid on higher legisla-\ntive and policy levels.\nVan der Woude and Van der Leun 41\nIn order to more thoroughly unravel the process of crimmigration, an interdisciplinary\nholistic multi-level approach is thus necessary. Focusing on one actor and ignoring the\nsocial and political context within which crimmigration decisions are made will by defi-\nnition lead to an incomplete analysis of the process of crimmigration and its drivers.\nNevertheless, there are always additional questions to explore. As mentioned in previ-\nously, the national legislature has created discretionary space for RNM officials to select\nwhich cars to stop for an MSM check. In the context of further disentangling the process\nof crimmigration, it is precisely this decision that needs further scrutiny. It would be\nrelevant to investigate to what extent border police officers see parallels between the\npeople they would stop from an immigration point of view and those they would stop\nfrom a criminal law point of view. In other words, to what extent are some immigrant\ngroups in practice also associated with certain forms of cross-border crime? Another\nopen question concerns the effectiveness of these strategies when it comes to crime con-\ntrol. What is the added value of border area policing in combating migration crimes? The\nlatter question requires a quantitative and potentially semi-experimental research design,\nwhich was not feasible in the context of the existing study.\nThe outcomes of the present study have implications for the European Project. One\ncould argue that the mere possibility of performing immigration checks in border areas\nis already questionable from the perspective of free movement, which can be seen as the\ncore characteristic of the EU. Surely, the frequency and intensity of these checks have\nbeen limited as a result of the rulings of the CJEU, but member states still enjoy a great\namount of discretion on how to translate the Schengen Borders Code into their national\nlegislation. And since the SBC is rather vague on the exact nature of these checks, mem-\nber states can deal with them creatively. Although the European Commission announced\nstricter checks on the implementation and enforcement of EU legislation on the member\nstate level in the 2013 Schengen Governance Package, it remains to be seen what this\nactually means in practice. In the light of the present influx of immigrants through the\nsouthern and eastern external borders of the EU and the difficult political process with\nrespect to more fundamental harmonization and burden-sharing with respect to asylum\nseekers, it is to be expected that member states \u00ad especially those in Western Europe \u00ad\nwill seek out all options to somehow manage or at least monitor who is entering through\nthe border areas of their nation states (Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015). Terrorist\nthreats and attacks, including the recent ones in France, add to the urgency that is felt in\nthis respect. Although the original promise of creating a borderless Europe within which\ncrossing a land border should be as easy as crossing a municipal border sounded good, it\nhas proven to be too good to be true. Countries are increasingly looking for ways to use\nthe gray areas of supranational and national legislation in such a way that the promise of\na borderless Europe applies only to a privileged group of bona fide travelers and not to\nthose who are seen as the crimmigrant `other'(Aas, 2011). Security concerns are crucial,\nbut the implications of the increasing merger of crime and migration control across\nEurope deserve attention that goes further than solely looking at street-level decisions.\n"
