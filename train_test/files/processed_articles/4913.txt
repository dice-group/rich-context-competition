Cell viability following\ndrug exposure was determined using the\n5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)\nassay (Solarbio Science and Technology).\nFigure 1.

After a further 24 h of\nincubation, media was removed and cells\nwere washed three times with phosphate\nbuffered saline (PBS) and stained with 2mg/ml\nPoland) at room temperature for 30 min.\nFlow cytometry detection of apoptosis\nand cell cycle\nCells were trypsinised 24 h after taccaoside\ntreatment and washed twice with PBS. Flow\ncytometry for cell cycle determination was\nperformed using DNA PREP and DNA\nPREP stain according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions (Beckman, Fullerton, CA,\nUSA) or for apoptosis using a PE/7-AAD\ndouble-staining kit according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions (Beckman). All\nexperiments were repeated three times.\nCaspase assays\nwith taccaoside for 24 h and caspase activity\nwas measure using a caspase activity assay\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions\n(Beyotime, China).\nWestern blot\nlogarithmic growth phase were seeded into\nTaccaoside for 24h. Scraped and collected\nthe cells. Total cellular proteins were\nextracted with RIPA buffer (Beyotime,\nChina) and quantified using a bicinchoninic\nacid (BCA) assay (Beyotime, China). Equal\namounts of protein per sample were loaded\nonto SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at\n80V for 30min. Samples were then electro-\nphoresed in a separation gel at 120 V for at\nleast 90min. Separated proteins were trans-\nferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride mem-\nbrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and\nblocked with 5% milk at room temperature\nfor 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight\nwith primary antibodies with shaking at 4C\nand then with secondary antibodies at room\ntemperature for 2 h. All immunoblots were\nvisualized by electrochemiluminescence using\nECL Western Blotting Substrate (Solarbio,\nChina). b-actin, Bax, Bcl-2 and PARP were\ndiluted with 2% BSA (Solarbio, China)\nafter primary and secondary antibody.\nStatistical analysis\nExperimental data were analysed using\nSPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) with significance set at\nP < 0.05. Between-group differences were\nanalysed using one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) with the Bonferroni t-test. Data\nwere presented as the mean \u00c6 SD.\nResults\nTaccaoside significantly inhibited the prolif-\na time-concentration dependent manner\nrespectively. Furthermore, cell density was\nmarkedly reduced in cells treated with\ntaccaoside.\nTo investigate whether the antiprolifera-\ntion effect of taccaoside were associated\nwith the induction of apoptosis, cellular\nmorphological changes were observed using\nwith 4 mM of taccaoside for 24h, cytoplasmic\nblebbing, chromatin condensation and\nnuclear fragmentation could be observed\nunder a fluorescent microscope (Figure 3a).\nPE-7AAD double staining was using to\ndetect taccaoside-induced apoptosis. After\nexposure to taccaoside for 24h, the apoptosis\n(Figure 3b). The increase in apoptosis was\nsignificantly dosage-dependent in both cell\nlines (P < 0.01) (Figure 3c). These results\ndemonstrated that taccaoside inhibited cell\nproliferation by inducing apoptosis.\nCell cycle arrest also played an important\nrole in the antiproliferation effect of taccao-\nsignificantly increased after treatment with\nthe percentage in the control group at\nin the G2/M phase in the taccaoside group\nphase in the control group (Figure 3).\nTaccaoside treatment also increased the\npercentage of S phase cells (P < 0.01). The\npercentage of G0/G1 phase cells was sig-\nnificantly decreased following taccaoside\nTo determine the possible mechanism by\nwhich taccaoside induced apoptosis in HCC\ncells, western blot assays were used to detect\nthe expression of apoptosis-related proteins.\nWe found that taccaoside activated caspase-3\ncells in a concentration-dependent manner\n(Figure 5) (P < 0.01). These results indicate\nthat taccaoside may promote apoptosis and\nnecrosis by activating caspase-3 and -8.

Increased PARP cleavage was also\nfollowing taccaoside treatment (Figure 6).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we showed that taccaoside, a\nsteroidal saponin isolated from Schizocapsa\nplantaginea (Hance), induced cytotoxicity,\napoptosis and cell cycle arrest in two HCC\ncell lines. Western blot results indicated that\ntaccaoside induced apoptosis by modulating\napoptosis-related proteins.\nTaccaoside is a biologically active com-\npound found in various types of traditional\nChinese medicine, which represents another\nroute to the discovery of therapeutic agents\nFigure 2.

Apoptotic cells with\n(continued)\nfor HCC. Although compounds from the\nTaccaceae family have been approved for\ncancer therapy in China,2,3 their anticancer\nmechanism remains poorly understood.\nDetermining the mechanism of action of\ntaccaoside is therefore the key to under-\nstanding the treatment effects of Taccaceae.\nIn a previous study, taccaoside was found\nto have significant antiproliferation effects on\ncancer cell lines, inhibiting the HCC cell lines\nively.5,6 In another study, taccaoside had a\nsignificant antiproliferative effect in cancer\nDespite multiple reports documenting the\ncytotoxicity of taccaoside, the mechanism\nbehind its cytotoxic effect remains unclear.\nAn imbalance between proliferation and\napoptosis is a characteristic of HCC cells, an\nthe antiapoptotic signal induced by multi-\ndrug resistance presents challenges in the\ntreatment of HCC using chemotherapy.12\nRegulation of the apoptosis signal in HCC\ncells is therefore a central focus in the\ntreatment of HCC.\nSeveral types of steroidal saponins can\ninhibit HCC cell proliferation by inducing\napoptosis and blocking the cell cycle.13,14 In\nthe present study, taccaoside showed signifi-\ncant inhibition of two HCC cell lines, in line\nwith the results of these previous studies.\nBased on our results, we show for the first\ntime that taccaoside markedly increases the\nBel-7404 cells as confirmed by the morpho-\nlogical changes observed. Furthermore, tac-\ncaoside may also inhibit HCC cell\nproliferation by blocking the cell cycle, as\nour results show that taccaoside decreased\nthe percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase\nby blocking cells in the G2/M or S phase.\nCaspases are the primary death prote-\nases, and their activation often triggers\nFigure 3.

The number of apoptotic cells is expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. The apoptotic\nrates of SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404 cells were markedly increased after exposed to taccaoside for 24 h.

Among the caspase\nfamily, caspase-3 is the primary executioner\nof apoptotic death,15 and morphological\nchanges and caspase-8 activation16 are\nnecessary for caspase-3 activation. Using a\ncaspase activity assay, we showed that\ncaspase-3 and caspase-8 were activated fol-\nlowing taccaoside treatment. Cell morpho-\nstaining also indicated caspase activation.\nOur results suggest that taccaoside promotes\nan anticancer effect in HCC cells via cas-\npase-dependent apoptosis.\nOur results also show that taccaoside\nregulates apoptosis-associated proteins in\nexposure to taccaoside for 24 h, PARP\ncleavage, an important indicator of apop-\ntosis,17 was increased. Taccaoside also\nincreased Bax expression and decreased\nBcl-2 expression. The upregulation of Bcl-2\ncan lead to the blocking of various apoptotic\nsignals,18 while the upregulation of Bax\nleads to the activation of caspases.19 The\nregulatory effect of taccaoside on Bax and\nBcl-2 protein expression may play an\nimportant role in taccaoside-induced\napoptosis.\nIn conclusion, we showed that taccaoside\nproliferation by inducing apoptosis and\ncausing cell cycle arrest. Caspase-3 and -8\nactivation may also contribute to taccaoside-\ninduced apoptotic cell death.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China grant\nFigure 6.
