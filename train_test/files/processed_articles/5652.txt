    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of the study is to analyze factors influencing students' perceptions of teaching as a career choice using structural\nequation modeling with the goal of shaping a teacher education recruitment program. In this study, 458 students from a\nMidwestern university in the United States responded to an online survey about career-related factors they value, their\nexpectation that teaching would offer those factors, and any social-influence factors that might encourage them to choose\na teaching career. The effect of 10 exogenous motivation variables (value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-extrinsic,\nvalue-altruistic, expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic, expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-\nexperience, and social-suggestions) on choosing a teaching career was examined. Results of our analysis showed that the\nfactors related to expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-experience, and social-\nsuggestions were found to be significant, whereas value-related factors and expectancy-extrinsic factors were found to be\ninsignificant.\n",

Our\nuniversity in the upper Midwest of the United States recently\njoined a national effort to increase the number of math and\nscience teachers. As recruitment of new teachers is a major\ngoal of our efforts, we want to develop a recruitment pro-\ngram--a strategy for attracting well-qualified students into\nteaching--which educates students about the teaching pro-\nfession. Most university-based teacher education programs\nin the United States have specific selection criteria that guide\nwhich students are admitted to the program, but relatively\nfew programs have a systematic program for actively recruit-\ning students into their programs (Tenore, Dunn, Laughter, &\nMilner, 2010). Instead, program doors are left open and stu-\ndents self-select to become a teacher.\nAn effective recruitment strategy will be responsive to\nstudents' perceptions of teaching as a career option. Almost\nall college students have spent most of their scholastic lives\nin formal classrooms, and their perceptions of teaching are\nshaped by their wealth of classroom-based experience\n(Haberman, 1989). The \"insider\" knowledge students have\nof the classroom may pre-dispose them to erroneously dis-\nmiss teaching as a career opportunity due to a lack of under-\nstanding the actual work of teachers. Students choose--or\ndismiss--a career in teaching with pre-established, strong,\nand sometimes misguided perceptions about the work of\nteaching based on their prior classroom experiences (Pajares,\n1993). Students who have not had positive school-related\nexperiences may disregard teaching as a career opportunity\n(Bianco, Leech, & Mitchell, 2011). Therefore, a strategy to\nrecruit new teachers should be guided by students' com-\nmonly held perceptions of teaching as a career option.\nKnowing how students generally perceive teaching will pro-\nvide an effective starting place in designing a recruitment\nstrategy that provides students with an accurate understand-\ning of the professional demands of teaching.\nThe goal of this study is to better understand commonly\nheld perceptions undergraduates have of teaching to guide\nthe development of a recruitment strategy that addresses stu-\ndents'perceptions, including their concerns, about a possible\ncareer in teaching. We recognize that perceptions of teaching\n1Black Hills State University, Spearfish, SD, USA\n2University of Minnesota, Morris, USA\n3South Dakota State University, Brookings, USA\n4Pennsylvania State University, Erie, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKenneth Emo, Division of Education, University of Minnesota, 600 E. 4th\nEmail: kremo@morris.umn.edu\nAnalyzing Factors Influencing Teaching\nas a Career Choice Using Structural\nEquation Modeling\nBudhinath Padhy1, Kenneth Emo2, Gemechis Djira3,\nand Amit Deokar4\n Keywords\nteacher education, education, multivariate analyses, teaching\n2 SAGE Open\nare subjective, are of cultural origin, and will vary with time\nand place. Whereas public perceptions of schooling and\nteaching are surveyed regularly (Bushaw & Lopez, 2010,\nlished studies that researched the perceptions of teaching\nheld by university students uncommitted to a teaching career.\nThese studies found that students favorably disposed to\nteaching were inclined to place higher value on altruistic fac-\ntors, such as making positive contributions to society, than\nthose less likely to teach (Kyriacou & Coulthard, 2000) and\nthat students were more likely to see only the intrinsic\nrewards of teaching (See, 2004). To understand student per-\nceptions of teaching as a career option, we administered a\nsurvey to undergraduate university students. We used struc-\ntural equation models (SEMs) to investigate the relationship\nbetween what students value in a career and what they expect\nteaching to provide (value- and expectancy-related con-\nstructs), the social experiences that influence their percep-\ntions, and the likelihood of choosing a career in teaching.\nTheoretical Framework\nThis study utilizes a survey based on the expectancy-value\nWigfield & Eccles, 2000). The expectancy-value theory of\nmotivation states that individuals are motivated to make\nchoices in light of their personal values and the expectation\nthat a particular choice will allow those values to be fulfilled.\nOne's values and the expectation one has that a given choice\nwill meet those values are highly personal and are formed\nthrough past experiences, the stereotypes that one holds, and\nthe way a person self-perceives his or her abilities to perform\nwell in given situations (Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984).\nGood choices are the result of understanding one's personal\nvalues and how the array of options in a given choice will\nallow one to meet those values. The theory has been success-\nfully applied to understanding choices made in academic\nschool disciplines and sports, as well as to specific types of\ncontended that expectancy-value motivational model was\nparticularly useful in investigating motivating factors for\nchoosing a teaching career. Expectancy-value theorists argue\nthat individuals' choices, their persistence, and their perfor-\nmances can be explained by their expectations of doing well\nin an activity and the extent to which they value that activity\nThis study utilized a survey instrument adapted, with per-\nmission, from one designed by Kyriacou and Coulthard\n(2000). Based on an expectancy-value model of motivation,\nthe survey asks respondents to first rate the value they placed\non 20 different career-related characteristics and then rate\nwhether or not they expected a career in teaching to meet\ntheir values. The survey's 20 different career-related\ncharacteristics are items that are perceived as characteristics\ngenerally valued in a career (Brown, 1992; Chuene, Lubben,\nCoulthard, 2000) and fit into one of three different\ncategories:\nIntrinsic motivations: These cover aspects of the job\nactivity itself, such as the activity of teaching children,\nand an interest in using their subject matter knowledge\nand expertise;\nExtrinsic motivations: These relate to aspects of the job\nthat are not inherent in the work itself, such as long holi-\ndays, level of pay, and status.\nAltruistic motivations: The deal with seeing teaching as a\nsocially worthwhile and important job, a desire to help\nchildren succeed, and a desire to help society improve.\nBased on a combination of exploratory and confirmatory\nfactor analyses, Wigfield and Eccles (2000) proposed three\nhigher order constructs for the expectancy-value theory of\nmotivation: (a) expectancy/ability beliefs, (b) subjective task\nvalue (i.e., attainment, intrinsic, and utility values), and (c)\nperceived task difficulty (i.e., effort required and task\ndifficulty).\nOur Present Context and Development of\nConceptual Constructs\nOur present study was informed by Kyriacou and Coulthard's\n(2000). It involves four different survey sections in which the\nrespondents were asked to mark factors that they value\nhighly in their careers, mark factors they expect teaching\nwould provide, and designate any social-influence factors\nthat might prompt interest in a career in teaching and their\nlikelihood of choosing a teaching career. The value and\nexpectancy sections consist of 20 items each, the social-\ninfluence section consists of 12 items, and finally, 1 item for\nthe likelihood of choosing a teaching career. Using explor-\natory factor analysis (EFA) techniques, we found a total of\n10 underlying constructs to be appropriate for this\napplication.\nThe value section (Section A) asks questions on items that\nare valued in a general career of their choice. The respon-\ndents were guided by the following prompt as they filled out\nthe value section of the survey: \"What factors are important\nto you when considering your own future career?\" Using\nEFA, items such as \"A career that I will find enjoyable,\"\n\"Colleagues that I can get along with,\" and \"A pleasant\nworking environment\" were found to be aligned along a con-\nstruct. As these were something to do with an environment,\nwe have named the corresponding construct as value-\nenvironment (aEnv). The items \"A career that provides intel-\nlectual challenge,\" \"A career which gives me responsibility,\"\n\"A career in which I can use the disciplinary knowledge\nlearned at college,\" \"A job with a reasonable workload,\" and\nPadhy et al. 3\n\"A job that provides high quality resources and equipment\"\nrelate inherently to the job itself and are considered intrinsi-\ncally motivated items that we named as value-intrinsic\n(aIntr). Items \"A career that provides long-term security,\" \"A\ncareer with good promotional prospects,\" \"High earnings\nover the length of career,\" \"A career that's well respected,\"\n\"A career that provides opportunity to travel,\" \"A career that\nprovides mobility,\" and \"A career with good starting salary\"\nrelate to the aspects of the job that are not inherent in the\nwork itself, are considered incentive-based or extrinsically\nmotivated items, and were named value-extrinsic (aExtr).\nFinally, the items \"Acareer that allows me to contribute posi-\ntively to society,\" \"A career that can easily be combined with\nparenthood,\" \"The opportunity to work with children and\nyouth,\" \"A career that gives me the opportunity to care for\nothers,\" and \"A job that helps other people\" relate to a career\nwhere one could help and care for youths, society, and others,\nand were considered altruistic and named value-altruistic\n(aAltr). A concise description of items and their associated\nconstructs with short names are given in Table 1.\nIn the expectancy section (Section B), the students were\nasked to rate their expectation that teaching would provide\nthe same list of factors given in the value section (Section A).\nThe respondents were prompted by the question, \"To what\nextent do you think a career in teaching would offer each of\nthe following factors?\" Using the EFA techniques, we found\nthat items in this section were aligned along three constructs\n(instead of four as in the value section). The items \"A career\nthat I will find enjoyable,\" \"Colleagues that I can get along\nwith,\" and \"A pleasant working environment\" were also\nfound to be aligned with a construct that was related to the\nenvironment and was named expectancy-environment\n(bEnv). As a career in teaching inherently deals with helping\nchildren and youth, and positively contributing to the society,\nwe saw that the items \"A career that provides intellectual\nchallenge,\" \"A career which gives me responsibility,\" \"A\ncareer in which I can use the disciplinary knowledge learned\nat college,\" \"A career that's well respected,\" \"A job with a\nreasonable workload,\" \"A career that provides mobility,\" \"A\ncareer that allows me to contribute positively to society,\" \"A\ncareer that can easily be combined with parenthood,\" \"The\nopportunity to work with children and youth,\" \"A career that\ngives me the opportunity to care for others,\" and \"A job that\nhelps other people\" were found to be aligned along a single\nconstruct. These items relate to the teaching job itself, are\nintrinsically motivated, and were named expectancy-intrin-\nsic (bIntr). The third set of items, \"A career that provides\nlong-term security,\" \"A career with good promotional pros-\npects,\" \"High earnings over the length of career,\" \"A career\nthat provides high quality resources and equipment,\" \"A\ncareer that provides opportunity to travel,\" and \"A career\nwith good starting salary,\" are associated with the aspects of\na job that are not inherent in the work itself and are consid-\nered incentive based or extrinsically motivated items. The\nconstruct along which these items were aligned was named\nexpectancy-extrinsic (bExtr). A concise description of items\nin this section, their associated constructs, and their short\nnames are given in Table 2.\nTable 1.

The items \"The salaries teachers earn,\" \"The\nsocial status of teachers,\" \"What I know and have heard\nabout schools,\" \"Dealing with disruptive students,\" and\n\"Media report on education\" relate to media information on\neducation and its people. We named this construct\nsocial-media-education (dMedia). The items \"Desire to\nshare knowledge with others,\" \"Previous experiences I've\nhad teaching others,\" \"The talent I've for working effectively\nwith others,\" and \"Teachers I've known\" relate to prior\nteaching experience and desire to share with others effec-\ntively. The associated construct was named social-prior-\nexperience (dPrior). The two items \"What friends suggest I\nshould do\" and \"What parent suggest I should do\" relate to\nsuggestions from friends and family. We called this construct\nsocial-suggestions (dSugg). A concise description of items in\nthis section, their associated constructs, and their short names\nare given in Table 3.\nDefinition of the Constructs\nThus, we have a total of 10 exogenous constructs that are\ndefined as follows:\nValue-environment: construct measured by environmental\nitems that the students value highly in their career of\nchoice.\nValue-intrinsic: construct measured by intrinsically moti-\nvated items that the students value highly in their career of\nchoice.\nValue-extrinsic: construct measured by extrinsically moti-\nvated items that the students value highly in their career of\nchoice.\nValue-altruistic: construct measured by altruistically\nmotivated items that the students value highly in their\ncareer of choice.\nExpectancy-environment: construct measured by environ-\nment items that the students expect career in teaching will\nprovide.\nExpectancy-intrinsic: construct measured by intrinsically\nmotivated items that the students expect career in teach-\ning will provide.\nExpectancy-extrinsic: construct measured by extrinsically\nmotivated items that the students expect career in teach-\ning will provide.\nSocial-media-education: construct measured by media on\neducation items that students get through social and media\ninfluence.\nSocial-prior-experience: construct measured by items\nrelated to prior experience of students.\nTable 2.

Whereas multiple\nregressions measure only the direct relationship between the\ndependent and independent observed variables while con-\ntrolling other variables, SEM examines simultaneous inter-\naction among observed and latent variables under study. The\nSEM research model for our study is shown in Figure 1. To\nkeep the figure simple, covariances among the exogenous\nconstructs were not shown.\nMethod\nProcedure and Participants\nThe survey was made available to more than 1,300 students\nwho were enrolled in 13 undergraduate courses at a medium\nsized university at an upper Midwestern state of the United\nStates. The survey instrument was adapted from a survey\ndeveloped by Kyriacou and Coulthard (2000). Course\ninstructors announced the survey to students and encouraged\nthem to take part. The survey was administered using an\nonline survey website and was available for approximately 2\nmonths. There were 458 respondents, with 3 missing data\ncases resulting in 455 complete cases. With permission, we\nutilized the above survey data for our analysis.\nThere were 62% male respondents and 38% female\nrespondents to this survey. The majority of the respondents\nwere younger undergraduates, with 72% in the 18- to\nremaining 7% were 25 years of age or older. The class ranks\nof the respondents were as follows: 48% were freshman,\nstudents. Respondents were predominately White or\nEuropean American with 91% of total, 1.13% African\nAmerican, 1.8% Native American, 1.3% Asian or Pacific\nIslander, 0.9% Latino, and 0.68% multiracial. Finally, the\nrespondents were asked to state their majors they are pursu-\ning. The respondents were 56% from life sciences, 5% from\nphysical sciences, 6% from mathematics, 8% from engineer-\ning, and 22% had their majors undeclared.\nMeasures\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the respondents provided\ntheir response to a multiple-item survey instrument with 20\nitems in the value section, 20 items in the expectancy sec-\ntion, 12 items in social-influence section, and 1 item in the\nlikelihood of choosing a teaching career section. The value,\nexpectancy, and social-influence items and their correspond-\ning constructs we developed through EFA were given in\nTables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For the initial model, we\nhypothesize that the constructs measured by their items are\ndistinct in the sense that each construct has its own set of\nitems or indicator variables (i.e., unidimensional).\nThe responses to the value and expectancy sections were\ncaptured by a rating scale with numeric values in the domain\nTable 3.

Finally, responses to likelihood of choos-\ning a teaching career section are captured as ordinal values of\n1, 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to \"very unlikely,\" \"unlikely,\"\n\"somewhat likely,\" and \"very likely,\" respectively.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe descriptive statistics of our data show that the standard-\nized kurtosis index of all 53 variables except the indicator\nvariable A1 are within the range of \u00b13.68, whereas standard-\nthe absolute kurtosis values greater than 10 suggest a prob-\nlem, and values more than 20 could possess serious problem.\nThe absolute skew indices of all our variables except A1 are\nfound to be within 2.00, which indicate these variables may\nbe skewed but not extremely skewed. However, skew index\nof A1 is found to be -4.27, which is beyond the recom-\nmended absolute value of 3.00 and could be cause of concern\nas the multivariate normality assumption among the indica-\ntor variables is violated and not handled properly (Kline,\nTest of the Structural Equation Model\nWe tested both the measurement model and the structural\nmodel in a single step with lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012)\nAlthough lavaan provides two default estimators for han-\ndling ordinal data (when multivariate normality assumption\nis violated)--the diagonally weighted least square (DWLS)\nestimator and the robust mean and variance adjusted\nweighted least square (WLSMV) estimator--we will only\nreport the results of the WLSMV estimator as it is robust and\nreported to be better than the DWLS estimator.\nWe have used the absolute fit index (2) and approximate\nfit indices to assess our models. As the 2 fit index is sensi-\ntive to sample size, Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson (2010)\nsuggested the use of the ratio of 2 to its degrees of freedom\n(2/df) with a ratio of 3.0 or less to be an indicator of accept-\nable fit. Approximate fit indices include root mean square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA) index, which is a stand-\nalone, badness of fit index (lower the better) that takes\nLikelihood of Teaching\nExpectancy-\nEnvironment\nSocial-Prior-Experience Social-Suggestions\nSocial-Media-\nEducation\nExpectancy-Intrinsic\nValue-Extrinsic\nValue-Intrinsic\nValue-Environment\nValue-Altruistic\nExpectancy-Extrinsic\nFigure 1.

Second, Bentler's\ncomparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI)\nare goodness of fit indices (higher the better) that compare a\nmodel with its baseline model.\nThe Initial Model\nThe initial model consisting of unidimensional constructs,\nvalue-environment, value-intrinsic, value-extrinsic, value-\naltruistic, expectancy-environment, expectancy-intrinsic,\nexpectancy-extrinsic, social-media-education, social-prior-\nexperience, social-suggestions, and their corresponding indi-\ncators are given in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 4 gives the results\nof the test with 455 observations, 53 indicator variables, and\nthe recommended level of acceptable fit (Hair et al., 2010).\nIt is seen that the WLSMV estimator reported 2 value of\nindex is below 0.90, it indicates that the model is not a good\nfit and needs to be improved.\nThe Revised Model\nSo far, we have focused on the indicator variables that only\nlink with a single factor. However, various operationaliza-\ntions of intrinsic, extrinsic, and altruistic motivations have\nresulted in a lack of definitional precision and overlapping\ncategorizations (Watt & Richardson, 2007). For example,\nB5: \"A career that provides an intellectual challenge,\" which\ncould be considered a form of intrinsic motivation could also\nbe referred to as a form of extrinsic motivation. Thus, a\ncross-loading link has been established so that the indicator\nB5 also measures the bExtr construct. Similarly, other indi-\ncators, \"A career that provides mobility\" (B15), \"A career\nthat's well respected\" (B11), and \"A career with a reasonable\nworkload\" (B12), are allowed to measure the expectancy-\nextrinsic motivational construct as these factors are not\nneeded in doing the teaching job itself. Moreover, \"A career\nthat provides long-term security\" (B4) is cross-loaded to the\nexpectancy-environment construct as having a secured job\nadds pleasantness to the overall environment. In this revised\nmodel, we have added a total of seven cross-loadings that\nhave the largest modification indices and those that theoreti-\ncally make sense. To keep the parsimony of the resulting\nmodel, we have minimized this ad hoc exploratory phase\nuntil we got acceptable CFI and TLI indices greater than\n0.90. The detailed list of constructs, their corresponding\nmeasures, and the added cross-loadings are given in Table 5.\nFinally, the model fit indices of this refined model are given\nin Table 6.\nLooking at the absolute fit indices of the model, we see\nthat the model fit is acceptable for sample size of 455 and 53\nindicators (Hair et al., 2010). Performing a chi-square differ-\nence of test between the intermediate model and the final\nfreedom and a p value < .001. All these results indicate a\npositive support for our revised model.\nTable 4. Fit Indices for the Initial Research Model.\nModel fit indices\nRobust WLSMV\nestimates\nRecommended\nguidelines\nNote.

Mean, Standard Deviation, and Reliability Coefficient of\nMeasures.\nConstruct M SD Cronbach's \nWe found that all factor loadings were significant at p<\n.001. The measures of the indicator variables linked with the\nconstructs, their mean, standard deviation, and the reliability\ncoefficients are given in Table 7. It is seen that the reliability\ncoefficients (the Cronbach's ) ranged from a low of .71 to a\nhigh of .92 (.7 or higher is better) giving confidence in the\noverall internal consistency or the degree to which responses\nare consistent across the items within a measure (Kline,\nTable 8 presents the correlation coefficients among the\nconstructs used in the study. We found that all pair-wise cor-\nrelations of the constructs are significant at p < .001. The\nhighest correlation coefficients are found to be between aIntr\nand aExtr (0.769), which is much less than the recommended\nrange <.90 (Kline, 2011), giving confidence in the discrimi-\nnant validity of the model.\nTesting the hypothesis.It is also seen that in addition to the\nstatistical significance of factor loadings in the measurement\nequation, the cross-factor loadings are also significant. The\nregression coefficients (of the structural part) that we are\ninterested in, for statistical inferences, are given in Table 9. It\nis seen that the regression coefficients for bEnv, bIntr, dMe-\ndia, dPrior, and dSugg are highly significant each with a p\nvalue of  .003. The positive path coefficients of bEnv,\ndPrior, and dSugg to C1 suggest that the students who are yet\nto choose a career and expect teaching would provide the\nfactors that they value highly are likely to choose a teaching\ncareer due to a pleasant career, pleasant environment, col-\nleagues they will get along with, a career that provides long-\nterm security, prior experience teaching, and influence from\nfriends and parents.\nSecond, the regression coefficients for aEnv, aIntr, aExtr,\nand aAltr are all non-significant at the 5% level with p values\nrelated factors have no influence in choosing a career in\nteaching. The path coefficient from the bExtr construct to C1\nis also found to be non-significant at the 5% level with a p\nvalue of .804 indicating no impact of extrinsically motivated\nfactors (in the overall model) for choosing a career in\nteaching.\nThird, the negative path coefficient in dMedia suggests\nthat respondents are discouraged by the information from the\nmedia about teachers' low salary (hence low social status)\nand dealing with disruptive students and are less likely to\nchoose a teaching career. The negative path coefficient in\nbIntr suggests that intrinsically motivated students who\nexpect teaching would provide their valued career factors are\nless likely to choose a career in teaching. This may be due to\nthe fact that the participants may not be looking for a teach-\ning career with intellectual challenge, with responsibility,\nand with opportunities to contribute positively to the society\nand helping youths and other people if the environment in\nwhich they work is perceived to be unpleasant.\nDiscussion\nA four-section survey instrument was utilized to better\nunderstand how undergraduate students in a Midwestern uni-\nversity perceive a career in teaching. The sections contain\nitems corresponding to what factors they value in a career,\nwhether they expect teaching to provide those factors, how\nsocial-influence factors influence their perceptions of a\nteaching career, and the respondents' likelihood of choosing\na teaching career.\nWe used EFA techniques to identify and categorize the\nitems along 10 constructs. There were four constructs in the\nvalue section, which were related to environment, intrinsic\nmotivation, extrinsic motivation, and altruistic motivation.\nIn the expectancy section, which deals with teaching as a\ncareer in context, three constructs were found to be sufficient\nand were related to environment, intrinsic motivation, and\nextrinsic motivation. Finally, in the social-influence section,\nthree constructs were identified and were related to media on\neducation, prior teaching experience, and influence from\nfriends and family. Our objective of the study was to exam-\nine the effect of value-environment, value-intrinsic, value-\nextrinsic, value-altruistic, expectancy-environment,\nexpectancy-intrinsic, expectancy-extrinsic, social-media-\neducation, social-prior-experience, and social-suggestions\non the likelihood of choosing a career in teaching.\nWe have used SEM to do our analysis. Because of extreme\nkurtosis and skewness in one of the indicators (A1), we\ntreated the data as ordinal (the way they were collected using\nsurvey) as the multivariate normality assumption among the\nindicators was violated. We have started with an initial model\nwith each indicator loading only on one construct. The result-\ning output gives a CFI value of 0.882 and a RMSEA value of\nthe recommended CFI value is 0.90 and recommended\nRMSEA value is 0.07 (provided CFI  0.9; Hair et al.,\n2010). As our CFI index value is slightly lower than the rec-\nommended value of 0.90, we needed to improve the model to\nPadhy et al. 9\nsee any theoretically justified respecification can be made\nusing modification indices.\nUsing highest modification indices that are theoretically\njustified, we have included cross-loadings of seven indica-\ntors that helped to improve the model fit. For example, items\n\"A career that provides intellectual challenge\" (B5), \"A\ncareer that provides mobility\" (B15), \"A career that's well\nrespected\" (B11), and \"A career with a reasonable workload\"\n(B12) are allowed to measure expectancy-extrinsic motiva-\ntional construct as these factors not needed in doing the\nteaching job itself. Similarly, \"A career that provides long-\nterm security\" (B4) is cross-loaded to expectancy-environ-\nment construct, as having a secured job adds pleasantness to\nthe overall environment.\nmeet the requirement for an acceptable model. All factor\nloadings were found to be significant and the maximum cor-\nrelation coefficient between two constructs is found to be\n0.769 giving confidence in the discriminant validity. The\nreliability coefficients (Cronbach's ) of the exogenous con-\nstructs of the final model were found to be from a low of .71\nto high .92 giving confidence in the overall internal consis-\nA critical question in SEM involves how large a sample is\nneeded to produce trustworthy results and opinion varies on\nthis. Typical rules of thumb include but are not limited to (a)\nthe sample size and p is the number of indicator variables.\nThus, the first condition N 200 is satisfied, which is the\nminimum size needed for any SEM model. With p = 53, we\nhave N/p = 8.58, which is slightly lower than the value of 10\nneeded. Research also shows that required sample size is\naffected if the multivariate normality of data is violated, by\nthe estimation technique used, and by the model complexity\nand average error variance among the reflective indicators\n(Hair et al., 2010). For our case, we have used robust\nWLSMV estimator, which is found to perform very well\n(Myers et al., 2010) for ordinal data (i.e., where multivariate\nnormality is violated). Even if we have a complex model\nwith 260 parameters to be estimated, the average error vari-\nance among reflective indicators or the convergent validity is\nfound to be satisfactory, the maximum correlation coefficient\nsolidifies the discriminant validity, and the Cronbach's alpha\n(reliability) for constructs has values from .71 to .92 (.7 or\nabove is better) asserting the internal consistency of the\nmodel. Finally, as the model fit is found to be satisfactory\nand has met all recommended fit indices range with few\nTable 8.

Structural Part Regression Coefficient Estimates.\nCoefficient of path to\nC1 from Estimate SE Z value p (>|Z|)\ntheoretically justified cross-loading additions to our original\nproposed model, we could undoubtedly conclude our find-\nings that for students who are yet to choose a career, the\nexpectation of teaching offering a pleasant environment and\nthe social influences play a prominent role in choosing a\nteaching career.\nImplications for Recruitment\nOur results show that respondents' highly valued career fac-\ntors had little relationship to their likelihood of teaching.\nRather, students' expectations of teaching and the influence\nof a variety of related previous experiences were the strongest\npredictors of increased likelihood of considering teaching as\na career option. The highest positive (0.895) and significant\nregression path coefficient from expectancy-environment to\nlikelihood of teaching indicates that an understanding of the\nteaching environment, including the items \"Colleagues that I\ncan get along with,\" \"A career that I find enjoyable,\" and \"A\npleasant working environment,\", plays an important role in\nchoosing a career in teaching. This agrees with the findings of\nKyriacou and Coulthard (2000) who did not use SEMs for\ntheir study. Our results indicate that students must be confi-\ndent that the working environment of schools, including other\nfaculty and staff with whom they work, will provide a posi-\ntive and collegial atmosphere, which they will enjoy. Prior\nexperiences such as having taught others, a self-perceived tal-\nent for working with others, teachers whom they have known,\nand a desire to share their knowledge with others contribute to\nstudents' openness to teaching. In addition, the positive sup-\nport of parents and friends has a positive influence on stu-\ndents' likelihood of considering teaching as a career.\nSecond, the statistically significant but negative regres-\nsion path coefficient for the expectancy-intrinsic construct\nsuggests that those who are less likely to choose a career in\nteaching are less likely to choose a career based on their\nintrinsic motivations and more likely to be guided by their\nexpectations of extrinsic factors. One possible explanation is\nthat students have low expectations of teaching to provide\nfactors such as an intellectual challenge, professional respon-\nsibility, a reasonable workload, professional respect and\ncareer mobility, the ability to make positive contributions to\nsociety, the opportunity to utilize disciplinary knowledge,\nand the opportunity to care for others, to help others, and to\nwork with children and youth, and to be a career that com-\nbines easily with parenthood. These are the kinds of career\nattributes that need to be addressed in a recruitment program\nso that students have accurate expectations of a career in\nteaching. It is possible that respondents to this survey viewed\nteachers as classroom technicians with little ability to exer-\ncise personal expertise and choice in working to bring about\nchange in the lives of students.\nMedia reports on education have a negative impact on\nstudents' likelihood to consider teaching. Students are dis-\ncouraged by the social status of teachers, what they have\nheard about schools, and media reports on education.\nStudents need a strong understanding of financial aspects of\nteaching such as teachers'salaries and the amount of funding\nschools receive. Although teacher educators may feel some-\nwhat helpless in rectifying broader societal issues, we feel it\nis important that these concerns be discussed openly and\nfrankly with potential recruits. Finally, the idea of dealing\nwith disruptive students has a negative influence on students'\nlikelihood of teaching. Recruitment programs could educate\nstudents about characteristics of teachers who effectively\nmaintain classroom discipline so potential recruits under-\nstand that teachers can be proactive and effective in main-\ntaining good class control.\nThe findings suggest that a good recruitment program will\neducate potential teachers about the career so they know\nwhat to expect and can make an informed choice as to\nwhether teaching will be a fulfilling career. Potential teach-\ners benefit from the opportunity to experience teaching situ-\nations to see whether they enjoy working with others in a\nteaching capacity. A recruitment program could provide\ninterested students with these opportunities through such\nactivities as volunteering in local school classrooms, work-\ning with children in after-school programs, or tutoring\nyounger students who are struggling in their studies. Such\nopportunities would provide possible recruits to experience\nteaching to better discern whether the profession is one they\nwould enjoy.\nThis study is limited in that results are drawn from data\nthat are captured from students taking courses during a single\nsemester in a single Midwestern university in the United\nStates and does not include students' gender or race. Another\nlimitation is that given a response rate of 35% (458 out of\n1,300) for this online survey, one must consider the possibil-\nity of self-selection. It should also be noted that arts and\nhumanities students were underrepresented in the sample\nwhile natural sciences students were overrepresented.\nFinally, our target population for the survey was first- and\nsecond-year undergraduates as we believe this age group to\ncontain a higher percentage of students still uncommitted to\nany career. We were successful at getting responses largely\nfrom this younger demographic, but we need to recognize\nthat responses from older students and undergraduates fur-\nther along in their studies may be different. Future research\ncould include more representative samples from different\nregions of the United States and compare the factors that\ninfluence a career in teaching with respect to students' gen-\nder, race, socio-economic status, region, and how percep-\ntions vary among those who do intend to teach. Second,\nlongitudinal studies could be designed to examine how\nchange in students' perceptions of teaching change over\ntime.\n"
