    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe growth of online higher education has presented important questions for social workers in academia. Can a human-based\nprofession be properly taught online? In macro courses, are social work students able to gain a complex understanding of\nhuman experience, social justice, and oppression without the benefit of face-to-face debate and dialogue? In an undergraduate\nsocial welfare policy course, pre and post anonymous opinions surveys were collected on the causes of poverty. Students in\nboth a face-to-face and an online course section, were asked to rate their agreement with the statements \"Poverty is usually\ncaused by individual actions\" and \"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions.\" While no statistically significant changes\nappeared for face-to-face students, online students were more likely to decrease blame for individual actions and increased\nattribution for societal actions at posttest. Reasons for this difference will be discussed, including the possible role of peer\ninfluence in face-to-face course sessions.\n",

Meanwhile,\na lively debate regarding the proper role and function of dis-\ntance pedagogies has emerged in the literature. Cohen\n(2003), for example, suggests that there is no substantial dif-\nference between learning outcomes for students in face-to-\nface versus distance education courses. Furthermore,\nteaching social work courses online may improve students'\nability to rehearse their evaluative and interviewing skills\nbecause the use of technology allows students the advantage\nof practicing in a less hectic atmosphere (Cummings et al.,\n2013). Importantly, online social work courses can also pro-\nvide educational opportunities to a larger student population\nthan traditional higher education settings (Faul, Frey, &\nHowever, others have argued that online courses are not\nthe best way for social work students to practice their craft.\nSome research has suggested that online social work courses\nmay cause students to become socially isolated and miss\nopportunities to practice interactional skills (Collins,\nColeman, Ing, & Gabor, 2002). Similarly, Banks and Faul\n(2007) argue that online courses may come at the expense of\nreplacing the valuable one-on-one experience that on-cam-\npus classes provide. Outside of this debate, the growth of\ndistance technology in higher education in general has meant\nthat a greater number of social work students are receiving\ntheir education either partially or completely online. It is,\ntherefore, critical to continue exploring the outcomes and\nexperiences of distance social work students.\nResearch in this area has been largely positive. For exam-\nple, a study conducted by Cummings et al. (2013) contrasted\nthe learning outcomes for social work students who partici-\npated in online sections of a graduate evidence-based prac-\ntice with groups course with on-campus students of the same\ncourse. The primarily online sections of the course also con-\nsisted of a few face-to-face Saturday sessions. When com-\nparing the online and face-to-face students, there was no\nsubstantial difference discovered between the two cohorts in\nthe areas of knowledge of leadership skills, exam scores\nor students' evaluations of effectiveness of the course\n(Cummings et al., 2013). This is noteworthy because\nstudents taking the online course were employed at jobs\nfor many more hours than face-to-face students, therefore\n1Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLeah Hamilton, Appalachian State University, Department of Social Work,\nEmail: hamiltonl@appstate.edu\nStudent Attitudes Toward Poverty\nin a Social Welfare Policy Course:\nOnline Versus Face to Face\nLeah Hamilton1 and Lindsay Daughtry1\n Keywords\ndistance learning, higher education, education, social sciences, curriculum, politics and social sciences, political science, social\nwork\n2 SAGE Open\nhaving obligations and time constraints elsewhere. Further-\nmore, distance education students reported high levels of\napproval for the course and their instructor.\nAnother study, conducted by Wilke and Vinton (2006),\nevaluated the first cohorts of an all-online advanced standing\nmaster's of social work program. The authors compared the\ncohorts with an on-campus cohort of also advanced standing\nstudents. Results indicated that there were several differ-\nences demographically between the two groups, such as stu-\ndents of the online cohort having more job experience than\nthose in the on-campus cohort. However, few differences\nexisted in regard to satisfaction and educational outcomes at\nthe end of the program.\nAlthough social work practice instructors ought to con-\ntinue investigation of the acquisition of interactional skills in\nan online format, policy teachers must consider whether the\nonline environment lends itself to a sophisticated under-\nstanding of social and economic inequality or acquisition of\nadvocacy skills. The Council on Social Work Education's\n(CSWE; 2008) Educational Policy and Accreditation\nStandard (EPAS) 2.1.5 calls for the advancement of social\nand economic fairness and basic human rights. This policy\nexplains that social workers are expected to promote human\nrights and social justice for all. Social workers are also\nexpected to comprehend the various forms of repression and\ndiscrimination that affect others and participate in exercises\nthat assist in bringing forth societal and economic justice\n(Council on Social Work Education, 2008).\nMeasuring these skills, however, can be elusive. Some have\nbegun by measuring student attitudes toward those in poverty.\nThe study of attitudes in the field of social work is important as\nthese beliefs may influence practice interactions, voting behav-\niors, and willingness to advocate for change (Cozzarelli, Tagler,\n& Wilkinson, 2001). A study conducted by Cozzarelli et al.\n(2001) sought to examine feelings about poverty, stereotypes\ndirected at those in poverty, and the attributions of poverty\namong 209 undergraduate students. Results indicated that ste-\nreotypes in relation to the poor were much more negative when\ncontrasted with stereotypes in relation to the middle class.\nOverall, participants were more likely to blame those in pov-\nerty themselves as opposed to some other cause. However,\nopinions tended to vary depending on the individual's sociode-\nmographic background (Cozzarelli et al., 2001).\nSimilarly, Schwartz and Robinson (1991) examined the\nperceptions of reasons for poverty from three different\ngroups of social work students enrolled in undergraduate\ncourses. The three groups consisted of students at the begin-\nning of their coursework, students midway through, and stu-\ndents close to graduating. Students who had completed\ncoursework in social policy rendered less significance toward\n\"blaming the victim\" justifications of poverty than their less-\nprogressed counterparts. These results may suggest that\nsocial work students are able to gain more social-justice-\noriented conceptions of poverty over the course of their edu-\nStill, it is important to establish whether these same gains\ncan be made in an online education format, and a paucity of\nresearch exists to explore this question. The current study\nexamines student attitudes toward poverty in one 200-level\nsocial work course titled \"The American Social Welfare\nSystem.\" The course is required for social work majors and\nis also approved for general education credit, which means\nthat student participants included both social work majors\nand nonmajors. In general, the course covers social welfare\npolicy history, social inequality, and poverty. The assigned\ntextbook is Jansson's (2014) Reluctant Welfare State, which\npresents social welfare policy via the lens of the National\nAssociation of Social Workers's (2008) Code of Ethics. The\nprimary aim of this study was to determine whether differ-\nences existed in student attitudes toward poverty before and\nafter the course. Furthermore, an online section of the course\nwas developed in Spring 2014, and this study seeks to deter-\nmine whether changes in students attitudes differed across\nface-to-face and online sections.\nMethod\nStudents in this course self-select into either a face-to-face or\nonline section, therefore creating a nonrandom sample.\nAlthough demographics were not collected for purposes of\nfull anonymity (to be discussed in greater detail later in this\nsection), it may be useful to describe the demographics of the\nuniversity overall: a medium-sized university in theAmerican\nsoutheast; the majority of students are White (85%), female\nyears; Appalachian State University, 2014). It is the observa-\ntion of the instructor that students in this course largely\nmatch the demographics of the university overall, with the\npossible exception of a higher percentage of females in a\nsocial work course.\nThe primary author was also the sole instructor for all\ncourse sections under analysis, which include spring, sum-\nmet two times per week for lecture and discussion, with sup-\nplemental material provided via the Learning Management\nSystem (LMS). This material included reading quizzes,\nPowerPoint slides, several documentaries, and supplemental\nreading materials. The online sections of the course include\nthe same LMS materials, with the addition of asynchronous\ndiscussion boards and a few additional assignments. The\nonline course was conducted entirely asynchronously\nalthough students were free to schedule face-to-face meet-\nings with the instructor as needed.\nDuring the first and last week of the described course,\nstudents were invited to respond to two statements on a five-\npoint Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly\ndisagree) via the online LMS (Moodle). These statements\ninclude \"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions\" and\n\"Poverty is usually caused by individual actions.\" A valid\nand reliable scale of attitudes toward poverty was developed\nHamilton and Daughtry 3\nby Atherton, Gemmel, Haagenstad, and Holt (1993).\nHowever, the instructor chose not to utilize this scale for two\nreasons. First, the scale includes such statements as \"Poor\npeople are dishonest.\" The primary author/course instructor\nworried that such phrasing would set a negative tone for the\ncourse, especially when used in a pretest. Second, the scale\nincludes 37 items and might have produced lower response\nrates among time-limited college students.\nAll responses were anonymous and students were\ninformed that they were free to decline to participate without\nconsequence to their course grade. Students were also pro-\nvided with information regarding institutional review board\nprocedures and approval. This anonymity was important due\nto the author/instructor's apprehension that any identifying\ninformation might influence student honesty. However, ano-\nnymity also produced significant challenges for analysis.\nBecause individual student changes could not be tracked, it\nwas impossible to conduct any sort of regression. Instead, a\nrelated samples Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was employed\nto analyze pre\u00adpost changes in student responses and an indi-\nvidual sample Mann\u00adWhitney U test was conducted to com-\npare face-to-face versus online students. Data analysis was\nconducted via the SPSS program with charts created via the\nExcel program.\nFindings\nWith five online sections (n = 154 at pretest, n = 137 at post-\ntest) and three face-to-face sections (n = 100 at pretest, n =\n92 at posttest) during the 18 months under examination, the\nsample included a total of 254 participants at pretest and 229\nat posttest. Attrition is most likely explained by students\ndropping the course or not completing course requirements.\nResponse rates were fairly high, with an average of one to\ntwo students declining to participate in each course section.\nThe first research question sought to discover changes in\nthe total population over the length of the course. For the\nentire sample, students significantly decreased (p = .000)\ntheir agreement with the statement \"Poverty is usually caused\nby individual actions\" from a mean score of 3.67 (3 = neutral,\n4 = disagree) to 3.70 at posttest. At the same time, students\n(N) significantly increased (p = .035) their agreement with the\nstatement \"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions\"\nposttest.\nThe second research question was answered in two ways.\nFirst, we examined differences between online and face-to-\nface students at pretest and posttest. For each of the two\nstatements, there were no statistically significant differences\nat either pretest or posttest. Second, we examined in-group\nchanges for each of the two statements. Contrary to findings\nfor the full sample, face-to-face students actually increased\ntheir agreement with the statement \"Poverty is usually caused\nby individual actions\" from a mean score of 3.77 (3 = neu-\ntral, 4 = disagree) at pretest to 3.73 at posttest. However,\nthese changes were slight and not statistically significant (p\n= .289). At the same time, face-to-face students increased\ntheir agreement with the statement \"Poverty is usually caused\nby societal actions\" from a mean score of 2.50 (2 = agree, 3\n= neutral) at pretest to 2.35 at posttest. These changes were\nalso not statistically significant (p = .670).\nChanges for online students were statistically signifi-\ncant for both statements and most likely influenced the\noutcomes of the full sample. Web students significantly\ndecreased (p = .000) their agreement with the statement\n\"Poverty is usually caused by individual actions\" from a\nmean score of 3.60 (3 = neutral, 4 = disagree) at pretest to\n3.68 at posttest. Meanwhile, these students significantly\nincreased (p = .011) their agreement with the statement\n\"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions\" from a\nmean score of 2.46 (2 = agree, 3 = neutral) at pretest to\n2.19 at posttest. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the mean changes\nin each group for the two statements.\nDiscussion\nThe quasi-experimental design of this study represents a sig-\nnificant limitation for interpretation. Self-selection of the\nstudents into either the face-to-face or online sections of the\ncourse (and resultant nonrandom sample) could significantly\nFigure 1. Changes in student agreement with the statement\n\"Poverty is usually caused by individual actions.\"\nFigure 2. Changes in student agreement with the statement\n\"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions.\"\n4 SAGE Open\ninfluence findings. It is likely that students were self aware\nwhen registering for the course and chose the section that\nbest supported their own learning styles. This could mean\nthat students who are less comfortable with distance tech-\nnologies would get less out of the course than those who\nwillingly volunteer. Furthermore, the guarantee of full ano-\nnymity limited tracking of individual changes and the oppor-\ntunity for more sophisticated methods of analysis. However,\nit is also possible that this anonymity presented a strength by\nencouraging greater honesty and increasing response rates.\nFinally, attrition rates may have also influenced results.\nStudents who were put off by the social justice orientation of\nthe course (and, therefore, less likely to report favorable\nchanges at course end) may have been more likely to drop\nthe course midterm.\nOne of the most interesting outcomes of this research is\nthe mean increase of agreement for both statements, \"Poverty\nis usually caused by individual actions\" and \"Poverty is usu-\nally caused by societal actions,\" among face-to-face stu-\ndents. The primary author/instructor assumed that these\nstatements would have an inverse relationship. It is possible\nthat the discussion-based model for the face-to-face section\neither confused the issue for some students or created a more\ncomplex understanding. It is also important to note that in the\nAmerican southeast, it is not uncommon to have very out-\nspoken and politically conservative students dominate class-\nroom conversations. It is possible that these comments\nswayed previously neutral students. However, these results\nshould not be weighted heavily as neither change was statis-\ntically significant. The fact that statistically significant\nchanges were observed among online students is noteworthy.\nIt is possible that in an introductory course, there is value in\nallowing students to absorb the material independently\nbefore being exposed to a discussion-based classroom.\nIt is recommended that future research in this area find\nways to gather demographic information, individual stu-\ndent data, and employ valid and reliable measures without\ncompromising student honesty or the course atmosphere.\nFurthermore, it is as yet unclear whether attitudes toward\npoverty are the most effective method of measuring a stu-\ndent's acquisition of social justice concepts. Establishing\nthis relationship or discovering better tools for measuring\nCSWE's (2008) macro focused EPAS will be critical to\nmeasuring the true effectiveness of online social work\neducation.\nAuthors' Note\nAn earlier version of this research was presented at the First\nNational Conference on Distance Education in Social Work in\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBoone, NC.
