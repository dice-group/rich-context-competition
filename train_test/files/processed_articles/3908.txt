AF can cause heart failure\nand thromboembolism, and increase the risk of cerebral\nembolism. In patients aged >75 years, AF has been identi-\nfied as the one of the most dangerous features of ischemic\nstroke.1 The mortality of AF patients is 1.5\u00ad1.9 times\nhigher than that of non-AF patients.2\nRecent research has shown that the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system (RAAS) is important to the develop-\nment and perpetuation of AF. Angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) expression is important in several patho-\nphysiological effects of the RAAS. Li et al.3 have reported\nincreased ACE expression in myocardial tissue of AF\npatients. ACE can stimulate the expression of angiotensin\nII, which promotes cardiac fibroblast proliferation by\nenhancing atrial fibrosis.4\u00ad6 The ACE gene is located on\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/\ndeletion gene polymorphisms associated\nwith risk of atrial fibrillation: A meta-\nanalysis of 23 case-control studies\nRunwei Ma1, Xiang Li1, Guoning Su2, Yunfei Hong3, Xingjian Wu4,\nJiyang Wang1, Ziliang Zhao1, Yi Song1 and Shaohong Ma5\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, atrial fibrillation, gene polymorphisms\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Surgery, the No. 4 Affiliated Hospital of\nKunming Medical University, China\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, the No. 4 Affiliated Hospital of\nKunming Medical University, China\nDepartment of Cardiology, the Third People's Hospital of Yunnan\nProvince, China\nDepartment of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The People's Hospital of\nWenshan Prefecture, China\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Surgery, the No. 1 Affiliated Hospital of\nZhongshan University, China\nR Ma and X Li contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding authors:\nYi Song, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, the No. 4 Affiliated\nHospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, China.\nShaohong Ma, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, the No. 1\nAffiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University, 58 Zhongshan Road,\nEmail: mashaohong@21cn.com\nOriginal Article\n794 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nchromosome 17q23.3, and insertion (I) /deletion (D) poly-\nmorphisms result in homozygous D/D and I/I and hete-\nrozygous I/D genotypes.7 Higher plasma levels of ACE are\nassociated with the D/D genotype, lower levels with the I/I\ngenotype, and intermediate levels with the I/D genotype.8\nIn recent years, the relationship between ACE I/D gene\npolymorphisms and incidence of AF has been a major\nresearch focus, but inconsistent results have been obtained.9\nA meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies published\nshowed no significant correlation between ACE I/D poly-\nFurther research on the association between ACE I/D\npolymorphisms and AF was conducted from 2010 to\nof ACE I/D gene polymorphisms and AF in populations in\ndifferent areas and further assessed the incidence of AF,\nusing the recessive model of D/D vs. I/D+I/I and the domi-\nnant model of D/D+I/D vs. I/I.\nMethods\nInclusion criteria\nStudies were selected based on the following criteria: (1)\ncase-control or cohort studies; (2) studies examining the\nrelationship between ACE I/D gene polymorphisms and risk\nof AF; (3) patients diagnosed with AF based on history and\nelectrocardiography (ECG); (4) diagnosis points of ECG\nand/or 24-hour Holter monitoring as follows: absolutely\nirregular ventricular rate, Pwave disappearance and replace-\nment by fluctuation with irregular size and shape (f wave),\ngeneral atrial frequency >350 times/minute; and (5) both\ncases and controls reporting genotype or allele frequencies.\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did\nnot fit within the selected conditions; (2) studies with repeti-\ntive data; and (3) studies with familial AF patients.\nSearch strategies\nEmbase, PubMed, WanFangData, and China National\nKnowledge Infrastructure were searched for studies\nsin-converting enzyme,\" \"I/D,\" \"gene polymorphisms\"\nand \"atrial fibrillation.\"\nData extraction\nData were extracted by scanning the title and abstract, and\ncross-checked by two independent investigators.Variations\nwere resolved by a third reviewer. Data extracted included:\n(1) surname of first author; (2) year of publication; (3)\ncharacteristics of study population, including country, eth-\nnicity, age and sample size; (4) ACE genotypes; and (5)\ngenotype distribution and allele frequency for the ACE I/D\npolymorphisms. Research quality was assessed according\nto the established methods of the Cochrane Collaboration\n(Table 1).\nStatistical analysis\nIn the meta-analysis, allelic (distribution of the D allelic\nfrequency of ACE I/D gene polymorphisms), recessive\n(D/D vs. (I/D+I/I)), and dominant ((D/D +I/D) vs. I/I)\ngenetic models were performed. Statistical analyses were\nperformed with Stata 12.0 software. The observed frequen-\ncies of genotypes in the control group were tested for con-\nformation to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.16 The\nrelationship between ACE I/D gene polymorphisms andAF\nwas assessed taking odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs). If the 2 test for heterogeneity was signifi-\ncant, we used a random-effects model to calculate the\npooled effect, which was used to calculate within-study and\nbetween-study variance. Alternatively, a fixed-effects\nmodel would be used to calculate the pooled effect. The\nfunnel plot and Egger's test checked for publication bias,\nwhile the influence analyses examined whether the results\nwere important to the meta-analysis.\nResults\nEligible studies\nSeventy-nine studies were selected from the databases,\nand 43 were excluded based on the titles and abstracts.\nThirteen of the remaining 36 studies were excluded. Five\nof them were excluded because they were duplicate publi-\ncations and three because they were meta-analyses of the\nrelationship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphisms\nand AF. We excluded three articles because of missing data\nfor the genotyping frequency and two others that had no\ncontrol group. Meta-analysis of the correlation between\nthe ACE I/D gene polymorphism and risk of AF was con-\nducted on the remaining 23 studies, which were based on\nresearch from Japan, China, Italy, Netherlands, USA,\nRomania, Greece, Brazil and Turkey (Figure 1).\nMeta-analysis\nIn the 23 studies, all the genotypes in the control group fit\nthe Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

We omit-\nted one study at a time and calculated pooled ORs for the\nremaining studies. None of the individual studies affected\nACE I/D polymorphisms and AF (Figure 4), signifying that\nthe results of the meta-analysis were reliable and stable.\nSubgroup analyses\nWe subsequently performed subgroup analyses stratified\nby population ethnicity. No correlation between ACE I/D\npolymorphisms and AF was observed under allelic D with\nin contrast to the significant association demonstrated with\nthe Asian population (Figure 5). Similarly, we found that\nACE I/D gene polymorphisms were not related to AF\nunder allelic D using the random-effects model (OR =\nCaucasian population (Figure 6).\nUltimately, the subgroup analysis separated by popula-\ntion ethnicity showed that the relationship between the\nACE I/D polymorphisms and AF had an obvious correla-\ntion only under the recessive model. The ACE I/D gene\npolymorphisms were associated with AF using the reces-\nsive model in the subgroup analysis.\nDiscussion\nOur meta-analysis helped to ascertain whether ACE I/D gene\npolymorphisms had an apparent correlation with AF. Our\nresults provide sufficient evidence of a relationship between\nthe D/D genetic variant and AF. A similar association was\nobserved in subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity.\nOur study strongly suggested that ACE D/D is a risk\nfactor for AF. However, a meta-analysis in 2011 showed\nthat there was no significant evidence to show that ACE\nand the additive genetic model used D/D vs. I/I.

Consistent with this\nassumption, our results showed that the ACE D/D geno-\ntype is significantly related to AF. However, it is not the\nonly reason for development of AF. There are many genes\nin the RAAS, and some studies have shown that other gene\npolymorphisms in the RAAS are related to AF.9,25,26 Future\nresearch can investigate the association between the RAAS\nand AF.\nSubsequent sensitivity analysis showed that, even after\nexcluding one study at a time and calculating pooled ORs\nfor the remaining studies, the results of the main meta-anal-\nysis were reliable and stable. The funnel plot and Egger's\ntest indicated no significant publication bias. Subgroup\nanalysis by ethnicity was performed to investigate the dif-\nferent causes of AF among distinct populations.\nIt should be noted that our study had several limitations.\nFirst, we did not consider other influences on AF, such as\nage, smoking, hypertension, and other cardiovascular dis-\neases, that could have led to potential bias. Second, ACE I/D\ngene polymorphism is not the only cause of AF, and gene-\ngene and gene-environment interactions also play an impor-\ntant role in the development and perpetuation of AF. Owing\nto the lack of related data, these interactions were not\nincluded in our study. Finally, meta-analysis is a retrospec-\ntive research technique, and it has methodological defects,\ntherefore, our data should be interpreted with caution.\nConclusions\nOur results provide sufficient evidence to show that ACE\nI/D gene polymorphisms are related to AF. Subgroup anal-\nysis revealed a significant correlation in different ethnic\npopulations in the recessive model. Comprehensive meta-\nanalysis further demonstrated that the D/D genetic variant\nis highly associated with AF. However, ACE I/D gene\npolymorphisms are not the only cause of AF, and further\nstudies are essential to elucidate the potential relationship\nbetween the RAAS and AF.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by grants from the Association\nFoundation Program of Yunnan Provincial Science and\nTechnology Department and Kunming Medical University (no.\nReferences\n1.
