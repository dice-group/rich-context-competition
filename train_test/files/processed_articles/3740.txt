    "abstract": "Abstract\nAssessing the well-being of postpartum mothers is an important aspect of postnatal nursing care. For this reason, Child\nHealth Nurses (CHNs) are charged with the responsibility of identifying postpartum mothers who do/not manifest resilient\nbehavioral qualities. However, little is known about CHNs' conceptualization of resilience or how they assess resilience in\npostpartum mothers. This exemplar study addressed this knowledge shortfall by conducting semi-structured interviews with\neight practicing CHNs. The study's findings reveal that although CHNs' conceptual understanding of resilience is congruent\nwith current theoretical thinking, some variance does exist in the ways in which CHNs assess postpartum resilience,\nparticularly, in relation to CHNs' use of intuitive assessment techniques to appraise the critical maternal postpartum coping\nqualities of adaptation, responsiveness, self-confidence, and social connectedness.\n",

Hence, the role of the Child Health Nurse\n(CHN) is to work directly with mothers during the 36 post-\npartum period to identify mothers who are, and mothers who\nare not coping with motherhood (Beyondblue, 2011).\nIn terms of providing assistance to mothers during this\ncritical postnatal recovery period, CHNs generally try to visit\nmothers within as soon as feasible after the infant's birth.\nDuring the course of this visit and subsequent home/clinic\nvisits, the CHN conducts an assessment of the mothers'resil-\nience as well as identifies any situational protective/at-risk\nfactors that may positively/negatively influence the well-\nbeing of the mother and child (Collins, 2011).This assess-\nment involves screening for postnatal depression, identifying\nsituational problems, developing individualized visitation\nschedules, and assisting mothers with their postpartum\nrecovery (Beyondblue, 2011; Department of Health Western\nAlthough the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale\n(EPDS) is a widely recommended postnatal depression\nscreening device, it is unclear what other measures CHNs are\nadvised to use when assessing maternal resilience. For\ninstance, the Western Australian CHN practice guidelines\nrefer to An Indicators of Need guide as being an appropriate\nassessment tool; however, no clear indication is given as to\nhow it can be sourced (Collins, 2011). Consequently, the\naccessing of this tool is dependent on each nurse's time,\nmotivation, and determination to source the relevant infor-\nmation. This individualized assessment situation approach\ncontributes to the variation in service delivery practices that\nmany health authorities seek to eradicate.\nA further conundrum is that if CHNs are to be proficient\nat identifying postpartum resilience, then they need to have\nboth a conceptual understanding of resilience and a practice\nunderstanding of how to recognize and evaluate it. This\nunderstanding is important not only in terms of their ability\nto assess maternal resilience, but also in identifying other\nsignificant adverse/challenging events that are occurring\nwithin the family unit during the postnatal period. Thus, this\n1Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nMyra Taylor, School of Exercise and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan\nEmail: myra.taylor@ecu.edu.au\n\"Keeping It Together, Keeping\nTheir Heads Above Water\":\nWestern Australian Child Health\nNurses' Understanding of Resilience\nin Postpartum Mothers\nRachael Collins1, Julie Ann Pooley1, and Myra F. Taylor1\n Keywords\nchild health nurses, postpartum mothers, resilience, trauma, adversity\n2 SAGE Open\nexisting approach is somewhat limited by each CHN's train-\ning and years of experience (Marron & Maginnis, 2009).\nAn Understanding of Resilience\nUnderstandably, calls have been made for research that pro-\nvides a greater understanding of the concept of resilience,\nhow it is made manifest, and how nurses can recognize it in\nothers (Gillespie, Chaboyer, & Wallis, 2009). The need to\ninvestigate CHNs' present understanding of the conceptual\nunderpinnings of resilience (and its counterpart thriving)\narises because the definitions of these two constructs have\nundergone considerable revision since their inception. In the\ncase of resilience, it has changed from its original deficit\nmodel of being a \"resistance to stress\" (Garmezy, Masten, &\nTellegen, 1984). Indeed, over the last decade, a seismic shift\nhas occurred within the resilience paradigm that has moved\nit away from its former deficit conceptualization toward the\ncurrent strength-based model. In this regard, a definitional\ndebate opened around whether resilience could be conceptu-\nalized as a state of homeostatic health maintenance during\nwhich competent thriving individuals return to their pre-\nadversity condition following each new adversity experience\n(O'Leary & Ickovics, 1995). This suggestion gave rise to the\nnotion of resilience being a \"better-off-afterwards\" experi-\nence, which in turn became the catalyst for shifting the\nresearch focus towards determining what innate intraper-\nsonal (e.g., social skills) and cognitive competencies (e.g.,\nintelligence, creativity, humor) were common to resilient\nindividuals (Tusaie & Dyer, 2004). During the same period,\nother researchers focused on determining the stress-resilient\npersonality traits that allow individuals when faced with\ninfrequent severe instances of personal threat to not only\ncope, but also to so successfully adapt that they are able to\nregain (and maintain) their pre-adversity level of functioning\n(Wald, Taylor, & Asmundson, 2006). It was conceptualiza-\ntions of this nature that gave rise to the \"bounce-back\" notion\nof resilience (Darbyshire & Jackson, 2005; Herrman et al.,\nFollowing on from this static notion of resilience, consid-\nerable research effort shifted to determining whether resil-\nience is a measureable trait (Herrman et al., 2011). More\nrecently, researchers have begun to postulate whether resil-\nience is the \"plastic\" intermittent ability, which allows indi-\nviduals to learn, adapt, and recover from their adversity\nexperiences that occur over the course of the human life span\nMore recently still, a consensus view has begun to emerge\nthat resilience is a dynamic relationship between an individ-\nual's personal traits, lived experiences, environmental situa-\ntion, psychosocial support system, and exposure to adversity\nIn terms of health resilience, it is now accepted that to\nmake a determination of resilience, two conditions need to\nco-occur, namely, the presence of an adverse experience\nand a manifest adaptation/coping competency. In this\nregard, an ecological framework has been constructed in\nwhich resilience is defined as being the human ability to\nnavigate a way forward toward accessing health sustaining\nresources in culturally meaningful ways (Fergusson,\nHarms, Pooley, Cohen, & Tomlinson, 2013; Unger, Brown,\nLiebenberg, Cheung, & Levine, 2008). More specifically,\nresearch has shown that resilience manifests itself differ-\nently within different families, cultural groups, and com-\nmunity settings. Finally, it has been suggested that resilience\nis the posttraumatic growth potential to exhibit resourceful-\nness by using available internal and external recourses in\nresponse to different contextual and developmental chal-\nlenges (Pooley & Cohen, 2010). Posttraumatic growth\nbeing typified by increases in self-reliance, expressiveness,\nlife appreciation, interpersonal relationships and spiritual-\nity, as well as changes to former goals and life priorities\n(Pooley, Cohen, O'Connor, & Taylor, 2013).\nThe conceptualization of thriving has similarly undergone\nconsiderable revision and, like resilience, is now considered\nto be a multi-dimensional construct. Indeed, there has been\nsome blurring of these two strength-based concepts. For\ninstance, thriving postpartum mothers have been defined as\nbeing individuals exhibiting a dynamic psychosocial growth\nresponse to the motherhood challenge (Walker & Sterling,\n2006). In addition, it is hypothesized that the \"gain\" aspect\nderived from overcoming a challenge is what differentiates\nthriving from the resilient overcoming of a \"loss\" experi-\nence. Regardless of whether it is the thriving lifestyle adapta-\ntion to challenge (e.g., coping with a new baby, moving\nhouse, planning a large family/community event, or under-\ngoing additional training) or the resilient experience of over-\ncoming traumatic loss (e.g., a traumatic delivery, a newborn\nwith major health issues, relationship breakdowns, death,\nmigration, or financial ruin), the important issue is that CHNs\nare adequately acquitted to fulfill their role of identifying\npostpartum mothers who are, or are not coping with the\nmotherhood experience. In light of this need, the present\nstudy sought to determine CHNs' understanding of the con-\ncept of resilience and how they assess resilience in postpar-\ntum mothers.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nUnlike most qualitative studies that aim to generate theory or\nfindings that are transferable to a larger population, the sole\nobjective of exemplar studies such as this one is to develop\nan understanding of a hitherto poorly understood phenome-\nnon within a defined context. A key attribute of exemplar\nstudies is that they allow data from within, and across, one or\nmore data sets to be intensely interrogated and rigorously\nStake, 1995). Through this process, one small-scale study\nCollins et al. 3\nbecomes the exemplar for other studies investigating the\nsame phenomenon. Flyvbjerg (2006) maintains that exem-\nplar studies are critically important as \"a scientific discipline\nwithout a large number of thoroughly executed case studies\nis a discipline without a systematic production of exemplars,\nand a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one\" (p.\n219). Whereas, as alluded to by Flyvbjerg, case studies char-\nacteristically involve a single case, which is then studied in\ndepth over a protracted period of time, case studies can also\n(as in the present study) involve a collective of cases (e.g., a\nnumber of employees or work sites conducting the same\ntask) wherein multiple perspectives are studied so as to gen-\nerate an across-case understanding of the investigated phe-\nnomenon. Hence, the collective case study design is\nsometimes used in workplace situations where it is impracti-\ncal, impossible, or not permittable for a researcher to observe\na worker in action. In such instances, there is a greater reli-\nance on the interviewer's own workplace knowledge to\nprobe and elicit the necessary rich data that would allow for\nan across-case investigation. The issue in such exemplar\nstudies is not so much the length of time spent following\neach individual case, but rather the quality and depth of the\ndata gathered and the strength and expertise of the cross-case\nanalysis.\nThe strength of exemplar studies is that they generate\nfindings that by weight of their combined numbers produce\ninsights into the investigated phenomenon, which are reflec-\ntive of the lived experience of the wider population (Punch,\nquantitative studies where tests of objectivity and credibility\nare judged by the strength of their numerical evaluation or\nthematic construction, the value of exemplar studies is\njudged by whether they bring something new or different to\nthe understanding of the investigated phenomenon\nThis exemplar study sought to explore the CHNs' under-\nstanding of resilience and their means of assessing resilience\nin postpartum mothers. Thematic analysis is not a prescrip-\ntive research design, but rather is an analytical approach that\nprovides an \"accessible and theoretically flexible means of\nPrimarily because thematic analysis accurately reflects par-\nticipants' lived-realities and, in addition, unravels pertinent\naspects of these realities. The unraveled data threads become\nthe data categories, subthemes, and themes each of which,\naccording to Braun and Clarke, captures data that are impor-\ntant to the investigated phenomenon. In this regard, thematic\nanalysis was considered to be a process suited to the investi-\ngation of this sample of CHNs.\nParticipants\nThe sample comprised eight experienced CHNs working\nwithin eight different child health clinics in Perth, Western\nAustralia. All the CHNs had between 2 and 30 years of\npractice experience and held (or the equivalent of) a Graduate\nCertificate in Child and Adolescent Health Nursing as well\nas an additional qualification in the area of maternal, child,\nand family health (e.g., a postgraduate diploma in child and\nadolescent health nursing). Their practice experience was\nderived from working with women across different socio-\neconomic groups and from culturally/linguistically diverse\nbackgrounds in the city's metropolitan and rural areas.\nProcedure\nEthics approval was sought for the study from the adminis-\ntering institution's Human Ethics Committee and from the\nDepartment of Health's (DOH) Strategic Support Unit for\nChild and Adolescent Community Health. The DOH granted\napproval on two stipulations. First, due to workload and time\nconstraints, no more than eight CHNs would participate in\nthe project and, second, the initial CHN contact was to be\nmade via the district clinical nurse manager. As per DOH's\ninstructions, the nurse manger informed CHNs (via email) of\nthe study and requested prospective volunteers to contact the\nfirst author directly.\nOn making contact, a mutually agreeable time and place\nfor the interview were arranged. In all cases, interviews were\nconducted within the CHNs'45-min lunch break. Prior to the\nstart of the interview, each participant was informed of the\nintent of the research and of his or her participatory rights.\nThe interview questions were informally delivered in a semi-\ndirective style so as to provide participants with the maxi-\nmum opportunity to discuss the experiences they deemed\nimportant to the understanding of resilience and its practice\nmanifestations in postpartum mothers.\nAnalysis\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim within a few days\nof having taken place. The accuracy of the transcriptions was\nassured by having the second author randomly check the\naccuracy of 50% of the first author's transcriptions. The tran-\nscriptions were subsequently analyzed using thematic analy-\nsis, which is the cornerstone of qualitative analysis as it\nenables connections to be made between people's expressed\nstatements and their embedded meanings (Stirling, 2001).\nThe initial process required the interview transcripts to be\ncontinually reread until salient points of interest emerged.\nThese points were recorded as a series of memos, which\nwere then grouped and ordered into basic units of meaning,\nnamely, categories (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Next, through a\nsynthesizing process of reordering, these categories were\nclustered into subthemes (Pringle, Drummond, McLafferty,\n& Hendry, 2011). Finally, through the process of continual\nabstraction, these subthemes were regrouped into a small\nnumber of encapsulating themes. In this way, the analysis\nprocess allowed rich, vivid data \"nested\" in the participants'\nreal-life social contexts to be uncovered and explored\n4 SAGE Open\nTo enhance the interpretive rigor of the analysis, two\nauthors independently analyzed the data sets. On comple-\ntion, they crosschecked their themes and subthemes. Where\nconsensus occurred, the identified themes and subthemes\nwere accepted as being representative of the participants'\nmeaning. When differences occurred, these were discussed\nwith the third \"judge\" author until a consensus of meaning\nFindings\nThe analysis resulted in the emergence of two themes and\neight subthemes, which are displayed in Table 1 with addi-\ntional illustrative quotes being displayed in Table 2.\nTheme 1: CHNs' conceptualization of resilience in post-\npartum mothers.\nSubtheme 1: Resilience is the survival-orientated human\nability to rebound from adversity.\nThe most consistently expressed definition of resilience by\nthe CHNs was the notion that human beings have a survival-\norientated ability to rebound from adverse/traumatic experi-\nences. Typically, CHNs commented,\nMy understanding of resilience is that it's mums, or perhaps\neven families, who've had a traumatic time, but are yet able to\nsurvive. (CHN 8)\nAlthough CHNs perceived resilience to be survival-orien-\ntated, they also expressed an opinion that resilience is also\nrecovery-focused. They contended that in the recovery stage,\nresilient individuals are not only able to \"pick themselves up\"\nand \"regain control\" of their circumstances, but are also able\nto apply \"coping strategies\" learnt during the course of han-\ndling previous adversity experiences. One CHN explained,\nResilience is the state in which you're able to cope better with\nlife's traumas and adversities. Um . . . instead of it (the adversity/\ntraumatic experience) knocking you over. You get up and fight\non. You cope. You just get through life without every little\ndisaster becoming a major issue. (CHN 4)\nSubtheme 2: Resilience is the human ability to project an\nunflustered and future-orientated demeanor.\nA second common perception among CHNs was that\nresilience is an innate \"relaxed personality trait\" that allows\npeople to cope. One CHN described resilient mothers as\nbeing \"the so chilled sort of people who just get on and face\nlife.\" Another surmised,\nResilience is an innate characteristic that enables people to keep\ngoing for want of a better word and to bounce-back when times\nget tough . . . There's some argument that it can be taught.\nMaybe it can, but I think it's an innate quality. (CHN 3)\nThe CHNs asserted that personality alone could not\nexplain why some postpartum mothers were more resilient\nthan others. Especially, as in their observations of postpar-\ntum mothers, those who manifested a relaxed attitude and\nwere well supported by their family, friends, and broader\ncommunity, often had a greater capacity for resilience than\nthose with a more anxious personality and few avenues of\nsupport. Although personality was considered to be an\nimportant individual factor, CHNs contended that it is \"your\nenvironment and your experiences that also form you.\"\nTypically stating,\nWe're all people, we've all got personalities and we've all had\nlife experiences. So nature and nurture have made the mother\nTable 1. Themes and Subthemes Relating to Child Health Nurses' Conceptualization of Resilience and Observed Resilient Qualities in\nPostpartum Mothers.\nThemes Subthemes\nTheme 1: Child health nurses'\nconceptualization of resilience\nin postpartum mothers.\n\nSubtheme 1: Resilience is the survival-orientated human ability to rebound from trauma.\nSubtheme 2: Resilience is the human ability to project an unflustered and future-orientated\ndemeanor.\nSubtheme 3: Resilience is the human ability to generate a self-expectancy of future recovery.\nSubtheme 4: Resilience building is a lengthy process.\nSubtheme 5: The resilience process involves grieving for a personal loss.\n Subtheme 6: Resilience is the human ability to learn from past experience, reframe the now, and\nwork a way forward.\nTheme 2: Child health nurses'\nintuitive assessment of the\npersonal qualities manifest in\nresilient postpartum mothers.\nQuality 1: Resilient mothers manifest a positive attitude toward their changed postpartum\ncircumstances.\nQuality 2: Resilient mothers interact with their babies and are responsive to their needs.\nQuality 3: Resilient mothers appear confident in their ability to overcome adversity.\nQuality 4: Resilient mothers establish social support networks and demonstrate a willingness to\nreach out for help.\nCollins et al. 5\nthe person she is . . . so whatever has shaped her has made her,\nand her coping strategies would've moulded her. (CHN 6)\nSubtheme 3: Resilience is the human ability to generate a\nself-expectancy of future recovery.\nA third consistently voiced interpretation of resilience\nwas that motherhood and resilience occur in tandem. The\nCHNs asserted that mothers for millenniums have been adept\nat coping with family-related adversities and personal trau-\nmas and, reflected that a maternal coping expectancy not\nonly exists, but because it is so embedded within society it\nhas become self-reinforcing and, therefore, has become nor-\nmalized. One CHN reasoned,\nWomen are perceived as being resilient in society. We're meant\nto cope because we're mothers. I think lots of mothers think they\nhave to cope because that's life. (CHN 4)\nAnother CHN asserted that when mothers are provided\nwith examples of their own coping qualities, then this mater-\nnal resilience expectancy is further reinforced:\nI think if other people have a belief in you and give you examples\nof when you've bounced-back . . . then as a mother you're\nexpected . . . to deal with what's coming. (CHN 3)\nSubtheme 4: Resilience building is a lengthy process.\nAlthough in the CHNs' experience, well-supported postpar-\ntum mothers generally displayed adequate levels of coping,\nthey also commented that this resilience is a finite quality.\nFor example, one CHS explained,\nI've worked with people who've gone through lots of trauma\nand torture in Sudan and I've thought they would have had\nresilience. Some had and some hadn't. I think that's because\nTable 2. Examples of CHNs' Identified Qualities of a Resilient Mother During the Perinatal Period.\nMaternal quality CHNs' perceptions\nPositive \"With the (resilient) mums they enjoy their children and seem to be able to manage and have that positive outlook.\"\n \"I certainly think it (positive outlook) does seem to make it easier for them. I think it's all a case of it (coping) just\nbuilds up and builds up and if you have that (resilient) sort of personality you might get through it (adversity) quite\nwell.\" (CHN 4)\nResponsive \"She delights in the baby . . . Is very interested in the baby . . . Picking up on the cues of the baby, communicating\nwith the baby . . . understanding the baby's need.\" (CHN 2)\nEngaged \"The sort of people who just get on and face life.\" (CHN 4)\n \"She's more aware of resources . . . She's not socially isolate and she's prepared to sort of engage with services.\"\nReflective \"Think, oh yeah, that was what I've learnt from that, no that's okay . . . I did an okay type job . . . I did handle that\nwell.\" (CHN 3)\n \"Looks at the bigger picture . . . reframes what has happened to them . . . yes this is hard but it will pass. In a few\nmonths it will get easier.\" (CHN 4)\nSelf-confidence \"Have better abilities, less levels of anxiety . . . more confident . . . less fearful of things that might happen, that could\nhave happened, that did happen . . . and have the confidence to think, actually yeah I'm doing a pretty good job\nhere.\" (CHN 4)\n \"Not hard on themselves.\" (CHN 7)\n \"Keeps her life normal.\" (CHN 8).\n \"Knows you have to have that order . . . to build on it and has the confidence that they can deal with the adversity\nthey face.\" (CHN 3)\n \"Knows how to access information and knows how to use it.\" (CHN 5)\nPragmatic \"Not over dramatizing (problems) . . . and look at things in a problem solving approach.\" (CHN 1)\n \"They're prepared to work through it (traumatic event) without actually giving up . . . knowing that what they're\ngoing through is only a very temporary time.\" (CHN 4)\n \"Can actually see what her day to day life is like.\" (CHN 2)\nCommunicative \"Can express this (thoughts).\" (CHN 2).\n \"Can have a bit of a laugh while we are chatting.\" (CHN 5)\n \"She's able to ask for help.\" (CHN 4)\n \"The fact that she's presenting and talking about it (adversity) is probably a sign that she's pretty resilient.\" (CHN 7)\n \"Laughing to me that is resilience.\" (CHN 1)\n \"Is comfortable talking about it (problem).\" (CHN 7)\nReceptive \"More relaxed . . . open to advice.\" (CHN 8)\n \"She's thinking well.\" (CHN 3)\nNote. CHN = Child Health Nurse.\n6 SAGE Open\nsome have been through so much they're just not able to go on\nanymore. (CHN 3)\nThe CHNs also considered resilience to be a lengthy pro-\ncess that took different mothers different amounts of time to\nachieve. For instance, they explained that in their experience,\nmothers whose exposure to adversity was recent were more\nlikely to display lower levels of resiliency than mothers who\nhad had a longer time to adjust. One CHN explained,\nI think time has a lot to do with resilience. I mean you're not\nresilient close to the event and some people take longer to\nbounce-back. (CHN 2)\nSubtheme 5: The resilience process involves grieving for\na personal loss.\nA fifth commonly articulated perception of resilience was\nthat it is a process that involves some degree of grieving for\nsomething lost. For, in the CHNs'experience, well-supported\nmothers tended to come to terms with their sense of loss\nquicker than did mothers with little/no avenue of support:\nI think resilience is the ability to bounce-back after a very critical\nlife event whether it's giving birth, a death in the family or a loss\nof any sort. So resilience is the ability to grieve over what you've\nlost and, then, move on to a state of normality. (CHN 2)\nSubtheme 6: Resilience is the human ability to learn from\npast experience, reframe the now, and work forward.\nThe CHNs additionally described resilience as being the\npost-adversity human ability to learn from \"looking back\" at\nprior adversity experiences, \"accepting\" the new changed\ncircumstances, and, then, having the depth of \"understand-\ning\" and \"inner strength\" to \"work forward\" and \"reframe\"\ntheir life. This reframing was seen to be critical not only\nto maternal resilience but also to the well-being of the\ninfant. One CHN provided the following explanation of\n\"reframing\":\nThey reframe things . . . not completely but enough to take a\nperspective other than the emotional one. Maybe, even a rational\none. That helps them get over the hurt, the anger or whatever it\nis that stops them from bouncing-back. (CHN 2)\nTheme 2: CHNs' intuitive assessment of four protective\nqualities manifest in resilient postpartum mothers\nAlthough the CHNs articulated a theoretical understand-\ning of resilience, when it came to identifying resilience in\npostpartum mothers, they suggested that this was an intuitive\nskill that required years on the job observations. In this\nregard, they described four protective qualities they believed\nwere indicative of maternal resilience, which are listed in\nTable 2 and described in greater detail below.\nQuality 1: Resilient mothers manifest positive attitudes\ntoward their changed postpartum circumstances.\nOne of the qualities in postpartum mothers that CHNs\nconsidered to be a prime indicator of resilience was whether\nthe mother projected a positive attitude toward her present\ncircumstances. In particular, CHNs looked to see whether the\nmother was pragmatic in her thinking, organized, adept at\n\"juggling things,\" and whether her speech was positive and\nforward looking (e.g., \"today is bad, but something cool\nmight happen tomorrow\"). One CHN explained,\nI'm thinking of one particular family, they've actually lost\neverything. Their house is going to be sold and they're looking\nat where they're going to live. They've got four children and\nyet mum's resilience is I'm going to take this one day at a time\nand we'll get through this. I'm amazed because it's pretty\ntough. They're a resilient family as they're able to survive\nwith their heads up and their family together. She (mother)\nsaid to me: \"Even if we lose every cent we've got, we've still\ngot the kids and we're gonna survive. I call that resilience.\"\nQuality 2: Resilient mothers interact and communicate\nwith their babies and are responsive to their needs.\nIn terms of bonding with their baby, the CHNs stated that\nwhen a mother first enters the child health clinic, one of the\nkey indicators of whether she is resilient or not is how she\ninteracts and communicates with her baby. They explained\nthat the most resilient mothers were those who genuinely\nwere responsive to their baby's needs and were not putting\non a show. Two CHNs explained,\nYou can just watch them . . . the way they talk about the baby.\nWhen the baby cries they respond. They talk to it as they're\ncoming into the clinic, they're encouraging it to look at things,\nand they're telling it what they're doing. There's smiling, there's\ncooing, they actually stop talking to you to coo at their lovely\nbaby. You can just see the whole relationship between the mum\nand baby is working well. (CHN 4)\nIf she's resilient and has bounced-back after a traumatic birth\nthen she's very interested in the baby. She's responsive to baby\nand to a big extent her thoughts are about baby and not about\nwhat she has suffered. She handles baby gently, caring for baby.\nShe says positive things about baby and you can see there is a\ngood attachment there. (CHN 2)\nQuality 3: Resilient mothers exude confidence in their\nability to overcome adversity.\nThe CHNs stated that another postpartum resilience indi-\ncator is whether mothers exude self-confidence.\nParticularly, whether they can see the bigger picture and\nnot be overwhelmed by issues of the moment. One CHN\nexplained,\nCollins et al. 7\nIt's them knowing that the time they're going through now is\nonly temporary. That it'll get easier. They're looking at the\nbigger picture. I think some mums are really good at doing that\nand knowing that yes this is hard, but it'll pass. In a few months\nit'll get easier and so to just take each day at a time and think, I\ncan cope, each day isn't gonna be like this hard. (CHN 4)\nQuality 4: Resilient mothers establish social support net-\nworks and demonstrate a receptive willingness to reach\nout for help and engage with local support networks.\nThe final postpartum resilience indicator that CHNs look\nfor is whether a mother has established a viable family/friend\nsupport network. For, in their experience those mothers who\nestablish connections with local support networks (particu-\nlarly female support networks), engage with those support\nnetworks on a regular basis, and are receptive to change.\nPossibly, because they tend to have greater resources at their\ndisposal to assist them in making a swift recovery. One CHN\nreasoned,\nWomen who talk about it (adversity) are aware that they'll get\nout of their stressful situation a lot faster than will women who\ndon't talk about it. Generally, if the woman is more resilient . . .\nthey'll have more resources . . . more social supports. They're\nprobably engaging in services . . . as that's the thing that's going\nto help them. (CHN 7)\nFinally, the CHNs explained that mothers who \"come\nfrom places where they're used to handing babies over to\ngrandmas, aunties and other women then they've grown up\nwith the attitude that their child belongs to the community,\nnot just them.\" Moreover, such community connected moth-\ners they maintained were more resilient than their socially\nisolated counterparts, as they were more self-assured about\nreaching out and asking for help. One CHN concluded,\nIt's all about confidence . . . confidence in their abilities to deal\nwith things . . . It's just having confidence in their abilities to\nknow to ask for help and not thinking they've to do everything\non their own. (CHN 4)\nDiscussion\nChildbirth is a significant event for women (Kendall-Tackett,\n2014) and a negative experience can affect their long-term\nmental health outcomes (see Henderson & Redshaw, 2013).\nFor, the mothers' perceptions of their delivery experience\nand other circumstances occurring at the time of the delivery\nnot only affect the strength of the bonded relationship they\nform with their infants, but also affect adaption to their par-\nenting role. Consequently, there is a cost health benefit to\nsociety in identifying early on and remediating confounding\nissues that occur in postpartum mothers' lives. It is no won-\nder then that since CHNs are the frontline interface with new\nmothers they are tasked with the responsibility of identifying\nmothers who are, and who are not, coping with their mother-\nhood experience (i.e., are resilient). What is somewhat sur-\nprising though is that although this CHN role is widely\nrecognized, little research endeavor has been focused on\nexamining the practice abilities of CHNs to fulfill the role.\nHence, this study sought to address this knowledge gap by\ndetermining both CHNs' conceptual understanding of resil-\nience and the means by which they assess resilience in post-\npartum mothers.\nResilience is conceptualized in the literature as being a\nstability of psychological and social functioning following\nan experience of high stress/trauma (Windle, 2011). It is\nclear from this study's findings that CHNs' conceptualiza-\ntion of resilience is largely congruent with this thinking. For,\nthey described resilience as being a composite of human\nabilities, which allows individuals to work through the psy-\nchosocial process of recovering from an adverse/traumatic\nexperience. Indeed, the most commonly articulated aptitude\ndescribed by CHNs was the human ability to \"bounce-back\"\npost adversity to their pre-trauma state of normalcy. This\nadaptive conceptualization of resilience is widely referred to\nas being the manifest competency of individuals to cope with\nsevere experiences of stress (Connor, 2006). The second and\nthird human resilience abilities identified by CHNs were\nthose of projecting an unflustered future-orientated demeanor\nand having an expectancy of recovery. Interestingly, these\ntwo abilities have been listed as being central protective fac-\ntors, which facilitate human resilience (Earvolino-Ramirez,\n2007). The CHNs' fourth commonly expressed conceptual-\nization was that resilience is a lengthy process, which\ninvolves grieving for and overcoming some form of loss.\nThis \"loss\" conceptualization of resilience is again consis-\ntent with the resilience literature, which views resilience not\nas a \"one off,\" \"get over it,\" obtain \"closure\" experience, but\nrather as a gradual process of recovery (Walsh, 2007).\nInterestingly, the CHNs conceptualized resilience as\nbeing the human ability to learn from their loss experiences\nand to reframe them in a more positive light. This reframing\nconceptualization of resilience has been conceptualized as\nbeing a recovery from loss ability that \"involves making\nmeaning of the experience, putting it in perspective and\nweaving the experience of loss and recovery into the fabric\nof individual and collective identity and passage\" (Walsh,\nstudy's CHNs linked resilience to the postadversity/trauma\nexperience of personal growth. This may be indicative that\nthe most recent advances in the conceptualization of resil-\nience have not been adequately conveyed to practicing\nCHNs. The need to keep practicing CHNs informed of recent\nadvances in the understanding of recovery concepts (i.e.,\nthriving and resilience) is pertinent given that it has been\ndetermined that highly resilient women are not only capable\nof posttraumatic growth, but are also less prone to serious\nmental illness than are less resilient women (Harville, Xiong,\nBuekens, Pridjian, & Elkind-Hirsch, 2010). (Also, the need\n8 SAGE Open\nto keep CHN informed of advances in the conceptual under-\nstanding of resilience is important because such knowledge\nwill help inform their health care delivery practices.)\nAnother interesting finding emanating from this study\nwas that when it came to assessing resilience in postpartum\nmothers, CHNs relied on their intuitive knowledge rather\nthan on a formal means of assessment such as EPDS. Their\nintuition was largely based on their years of on-the-job\ntraining, which in turn enabled them to recognize four key\nresilient qualities. First, was whether the mothers mani-\nfested a positive attitude toward their changed circum-\nstances. Second was whether the mothers interacted with\ntheir baby and were responsive to its needs. Third was\nwhether the mothers exuded confidence in their ability to\novercome any changes in their postpartum life, and fourth,\nwhether the mothers had established a support network and\nexhibited a willingness to reach out for help. The CHNs\nmaintained that the presentation of these four qualities was\nan indicator of the mother's resilience. Although their con-\ntention is consistent with the theoretical notion that resil-\nience is a set of personality traits, it should also be noted\nthat such traits do differ in their presentation from person to\nperson depending on the individual's situational circum-\nstances and his or her adversity/trauma experience\nobserved four \"protective\" qualities in resilient postpartum\nmothers (i.e., adaptation, responsiveness, self-confidence,\nand social connectedness). Interestingly, these observed\n\"protective\" qualities align with the contention that resil-\nience is a dynamic lifelong process of adapting to and cop-\nAlthough much of the study's CHNs'intuitive assessment\nof resilience in postpartum mothers was based on outward\nmanifestations of coping, only one of the CHNs alluded to\nthe types of coping skills used by mothers as being rational\n(problem focused) and emotional (reframing) in nature (see\nMaud, 2004). The possibility that resilient mothers use both\nadaptive (rational) and maladaptive (emotional) forms of\ncoping is an area that requires further investigation. Hence,\nfuture research may seek to evaluate the coping styles of\npostpartum mothers so as to determine whether resilient\nmothers do indeed use predominantly adaptive styles of cop-\ning (i.e., rational and detached coping) and, conversely,\nwhether less resilient mothers predominantly use maladap-\ntive coping styles (i.e., emotional and avoidance coping). Or,\nindeed, whether mothers use a combination of coping styles\nas suggested by this study. It is posited that engagement in\nsuch a determination of postpartum coping styles will be\nbeneficial to nursing practices in terms of shaping how CHNs\nmay best interact with postpartum mothers.\nLimitations of the Study\nOne limitation of this study was that data collection was lim-\nited to a single 45 minute interview period. This constraint is\nunderstandable given the interviews were conducted in the\nCHNs lunch breaks. This restriction prevented the research-\ners from confirming the emerged themes with the CHNs.\nA second limitation of this study's small homogeneous\nsample is its size. Although eight participants are entirely\nacceptable for a small-scale qualitative study, it should be\nnoted that its data lack sufficient power to generate substan-\ntive theory, which in turn could be applied to other popula-\ntions. Rather, this study's themes and subthemes should be\nseen as mega-categories (Bazeley, 2009). The benefit of\ndeveloping such meta-categories is that they can be subse-\nquently used in future empirical studies to determine whether\nthe perceptions of this study's participants hold true in differ-\nent settings. Thus, although this study's findings are sugges-\ntive of current practices, they should not be construed as\nbeing generalizable to the wider CHN population.\nConclusion\nUntil future research in the field of resilience resolves the\ndefinitional debate on whether resilience is a set of traits, a\ndynamic process, or some combination of both and develops\nappropriate measures for testing resilience, it is likely that\nCHNs will continue to base their maternal resilience assess-\nments on their intuitive observations. Undoubtedly, the ideal\nwould be for CHNs to use a combination of both intuitive\nobservances and formal resilience testing measures. For, a\ncombination approach would increase practice consistency.\nAnother ideal would be for greater practice/research collabo-\nration in the effort to determine not only where the boundar-\nies of postpartum resilience lies, but also what balance of\nhuman abilities/qualities determines whether postpartum\nmothers are (or are not) operating within the same functional\nrange of resilience as are non-postpartum women. The ben-\nefit of such research endeavor would be the enhancement of\nCHNs' capabilities to reach out to mothers and facilitate\npositive mental health outcomes (e.g., resourcefulness, har-\ndiness, and growth) during the postnatal period (Herrman\net al., 2011). This critical CHN reaching-out connecting role\nis particularly important in instances were mothers have situ-\national, social, and cultural challenges.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAtkinson, P.
