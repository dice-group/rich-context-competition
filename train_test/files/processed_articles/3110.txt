In perimenopausal women, skeletal\nlead stores are an important source of endogenous lead exposure due to increased\nbone demineralization.\nObjective To examine the relationship of blood lead level with blood pressure and\nhypertension prevalence in a population-based sample of perimenopausal and post-\nmenopausal women in the United States.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional sample of 2165 women aged 40\nto 59 years, who participated in a household interview and physical examination, from\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1988 to 1994.\nMain Outcome Measures Associations of blood lead with blood pressure and hy-\npertension, with age, race and ethnicity, cigarette smoking status, body mass index,\nalcohol use, and kidney function as covariates.\nResults A change in blood lead levels from the lowest (quartile 1: range, 0.5-1.6\n\u00b5g/dL) to the highest (quartile 4: range, 4.0-31.1 \u00b5g/dL) was associated with small\nstatistically significant adjusted changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Women\nin quartile 4 had increased risks of diastolic (90 mm Hg) hypertension (adjusted odds\nratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.7), as well as moderately in-\nciation was strongest in postmenopausal women, in whom adjusted ORs for diastolic\nhypertension increased with increasing quartile of blood lead level compared with quar-\nConclusions At levels well below the current US occupational exposure limit guide-\nlines (40 \u00b5g/dL), blood lead level is positively associated with both systolic and dias-\ntolic blood pressure and risks of both systolic and diastolic hypertension among women\naged 40 to 59 years. The relationship between blood lead level and systolic and dias-\ntolic hypertension is most pronounced in postmenopausal women.

The all-\nmale study population had mean base-\nline blood lead levels of 6.3 \u00b5g/dL,\nsimilar to men in the general popula-\ntion.10 An increase from the midpoint\nof the lowest quintile to the highest\nquintile of bone lead was associated\nwith an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of\nthat cumulative lead exposure, repre-\nsented by bone lead stores, may be an\nindependent risk factor for hyperten-\nsion in the general population.9\nEvidence suggests that bone lead\nstores contribute to circulating levels\nof lead in blood.11-13 In particular, blood\nlead levels in women appear to increase\nduring the menopausal transition,\nbecause of the mobilization of skeletal\nleadstoresassociatedwithbonedemin-\nbut significant increases in blood lead\nin postmenopausal compared with pre-\nmenopausal women is difficult to inter-\npret,becauserelativelyfewstudieshave\nexamined the health impacts of lead in\nwomen with hypertension who partici-\npated in the Nurses' Health Study\nshowed that increases in bone patella\ncentile were associated with increased\naboutmenopausalstatuswasextremely\nlimited in this study.7\nThe objective of our investigation was\ntoexaminetherelationshipofbloodlead\nlevels with blood pressure and hyper-\ntension in a population-based sample of\nperimenopausal and postmenopausal\nwomen in the United States.

During a 6-year\npart in a household interview and an\nin-depth physical examination with\nlaboratory tests. Full details of the sur-\nvey design have been published by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics of\nthe Centers for Disease Control and\nOur investigation focused on the sub-\nwho participated in the NHANES III\nsurvey interview. From this group, 409\nwomen were excluded for the follow-\ning reasons: 211 did not undergo a\nphysical examination or blood test-\ning; 77 did not have information about\nblood lead levels; and 121 women of\nethnicity other than non-Hispanic\nblack, non-Hispanic white, and Mexi-\ncan American were excluded because\nof small numbers in any single self-\nwomen constituted the sample used.\nDefinitions\nBlood Pressure and Hypertension. We\nused the mean of 3 systolic and dias-\ntolic blood pressure measurements, all\nof which were taken by a physician at\nthe end of the 4-hour physical exami-\nnation that occurred in the NHANES\nmobile examination center. Women\nwere categorized as hypertensive if any\nof the following criteria were met: cur-\nrent user of blood pressure medica-\ntion (self-report), a systolic blood pres-\nsure of 140 mm Hg or higher, or a\ndiastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg\nor higher. We also examined separate\ndichotomous variables for systolic hy-\npertension and diastolic hypertension\nusing these cutoff values, excluding per-\nsons who reported being treated for hy-\npertension. More details on measure-\nment of and outcomes related to blood\npressure and hypertension in NHANES\nIII have been published elsewhere.3\nBlood Lead. Blood samples were ob-\ntained by venipuncture during the\nphysical examination. Blood lead con-\ncentration was measured by graphite\nfurnace atomic absorption spectropho-\ntometry at the laboratories of the Na-\ntional Center for Environmental Health\nat the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The as-\nsay detection limit was 1.0 \u00b5g/dL. Each\nsample analysis was performed in du-\nplicate, and the mean of both measure-\nments was used in these analyses. All\nblood lead levels less than 1.0 \u00b5g/dL\nwere assigned a value of 0.5 \u00b5g/dL to\nbe consistent with previous analyses of\nNHANES III lead data by other inves-\nMenopausalStatus.Womenwerecat-\negorized as premenopausal (ovarian\nfunction intact), surgically menopausal\n(both ovaries removed surgically be-\nfore cessation of menses), and naturally\nmenopausal (nonsurgical cessation of\novarian function). Women without his-\ntories of reproductive surgery were clas-\nsified as premenopausal if they re-\nported a menstrual period during the\nprevious 12 months and postmeno-\npausal if they did not. Women report-\ning having undergone hysterectomy\n(without ovariectomy) within a month\nof the last menstrual period were as-\nsignedamenopausalclassificationbased\non their age (51 years, premeno-\npausal; 51 years, naturally meno-\npausal). Women who underwent bilat-\neral ovariectomy within 1 month of the\ndate of the last menstrual period were\nclassified as surgically menopausal.\nWomen who underwent hysterectomy\nor ovariectomy more than 1 month af-\nter the reported date of the last men-\nstrual period were classified as natu-\nrally menopausal. A total of 101 women\ncould not be assigned a menopausal sta-\ntus due to missing information.\nKidney Function. Serum creatinine\nwas measured because it is the most\nspecific of the 3 measures of kidney\nfunction available in NHANES III (se-\nrum creatinine, urinary creatinine clear-\nance, and blood urea nitrogen) and was\nconsistent with other recent studies of\nthe effects of lead on the kidney.41\nCovariates. Information about race\nand ethnicity (non-Hispanic black,\nnon-Hispanic white, and Mexican\nAmerican), age (years), cigarette smok-\ning history (current, former, or never),\nfamily income, and education was ob-\ntained from the household interview.\nInformation about body mass index\n(BMI, calculated as weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by the square of height\nin meters) and alcohol use (amount\nconsumed per week) was obtained from\nthe physical examination and exami-\nnation-associated questionnaire, re-\nspectively. A 4-level categorical vari-\nable for weekly alcohol intake was\ncreated with the following levels: none,\nless than 1, 1 to 2, or 3 or more drinks\nper week. The poverty income ratio, a\nratio of family income to the poverty\nlevel income for a given family size ad-\njusted to the poverty threshold for the\nyear of the interview, was used to cre-\nate a 3-level family income variable. A\nparticipant was assigned a family in-\ncome higher than the poverty level if\nthe poverty income ratio was more than\n1, at or lower than poverty if the pov-\nerty income ratio was less than or equal\nto 1, and missing if the survey partici-\npant did not report a family income\nlevel. A 4-level education variable was\ncreated on the basis of the number of\nyears of education reported by the sur-\nvey participant (0-11 years=high\nschool; 12 years = completed high\n16 years=completion of college or\nhigher).\nStatistical Methods\nWeusedmultiplelinearregressionmod-\nels to examine the associations of blood\nlead and menopausal status with sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressures.\nAnalyses that examined systolic and di-\nastolicbloodpressureascontinuousout-\ncomevariablesexcludedthe368women\nwithhypertensionwhoweretreated.We\nused multiple logistic regression to ex-\namine the risks of hypertension (gen-\neral, systolic, and diastolic) by catego-\nrizing blood lead in terms of quartiles\nand comparing those women in blood\nlead quartiles 2, 3, and 4 with those in\nquartile 1; these analyses were strati-\nfied by menopausal status.\nModels were constructed based on\noutcomes known to be biologically as-\nsociated with blood pressure (age, race\nand ethnicity, BMI, and serum\ncreatinine), including the study vari-\nable blood lead. Potential confound-\ning variables (education, poverty in-\ncome ratio, alcohol use, and cigarette\nsmoking status) were included if they\nwere found to be significantly associ-\nated with blood pressure outcomes in\nany 1 of the models before the inclu-\nsion of blood lead. Final regression co-\nvariates included age, race and ethnic-\nity, alcohol use, cigarette smoking\nstatus, BMI, and kidney function.\nStatisticalanalyseswereconductedus-\ning SAS version 6 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC), incorporating the examination\nsampling weights of NHANES III.40 The\nstatistical software package SUDAAN\nversion 7.0 (Research Triange Insti-\ntute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was\nused to calculate SEs for the estimates,\naccounting for both the weights and the\ncomplex survey design. Linear regres-\nsion coefficients reported are unstand-\nardized. The significance of regression\ncoefficients was evaluated using the\nWald 2 test. Statistical tests for trends\nof categorical variables were carried out\nin regression models by coding levels as\nintegers (scores) and evaluating tests for\nsignificance on the slope of the regres-\nsion line. Statistical tests with P.05\nwere considered statistically signifi-\ncant. All estimates of proportions, re-\ngression coefficients, and ORs are\nlation.\nRESULTS\nOverall, the mean blood lead level for\ndL, and the means for the quartiles of\n\u00b5g/dL in the lowest and highest quar-\ntile, respectively (TABLE 1). Women in\nthe higher quartiles of blood lead tended\nto be older, current smokers, regular\ndrinkers, poorer, less educated, and\nmore likely to be non-Hispanic black\nthan those in the lower quartiles. All of\nthese variables were significantly asso-\nciated with blood lead level.\n604 were classified as hypertensive\nbased on their systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures (n=231, untreated), as\nwell as whether they self-reported cur-\nrently taking antihypertensive medica-\ntions (n=373). Of those that were un-\nhypertension only, 30 had diastolic hy-\npertension only, and 78 had both sys-\ntolic and diastolic hypertension. Of\nthose who were treated for hyperten-\ntolicnordiastolichypertension,102had\nsystolic hypertension only, 14 had di-\nastolic hypertension only, 50 had both\nsystolic and diastolic hypertension, and\n5 did not have a systolic or diastolic\nblood pressure measurement during the\nexamination.\nIn these crude analyses, blood lead\nquartile was significantly associated\nwith systolic blood pressure (P=.03)\nbut not diastolic blood pressure\n(P=.86) (TABLE 2). A significant dose-\nresponse existed between blood lead\nquartileandgeneralhypertensionpreva-\nlence,with19.4%ofwomenhavinggen-\neral hypertension in the lowest quar-\ntilecomparedwith28.3%inthehighest\nquartile. However, although dose-\nresponsetrendsappearedtoexist,blood\nlead quartile was not significantly asso-\nciated specifically with systolic or dias-\ntolic hypertension prevalence (P=.09\nand P=.25, respectively).\nSystolic and Diastolic\nBlood Pressure\nIn multivariate analyses, blood lead was\nsignificantly associated with both sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressures\n(TABLE 3). In these regression mod-\nels, a difference in blood lead levels be-\ntween the lowest and highest quartiles\nwas associated with a difference of 1.7\nmm Hg in systolic blood pressure and\n1.4 mm Hg in diastolic blood pres-\nsure, after adjustment for age, race and\nethnicity, cigarette smoking, BMI, al-\ncohol use, and kidney function. Omis-\nsion of the serum creatinine variable in\nthe multivariable models for blood lead\nand blood pressure (both systolic and\ndiastolic) did not alter the signifi-\ncance of the blood lead variable.\nGeneral Hypertension\nBefore incorporating blood lead level in\nthe multiple logistic regression model\n(TABLE 4), the most important factors\nindependently increasing the ORs of\ngeneral hypertension in women in-\ncluded increasing age, being non-\nHispanic black, having an alcohol in-\ntake of less than 1 drink per week, and\nincreasing BMI.

After accounting for age, race\nand ethnicity, alcohol intake, ciga-\nrette smoking status, BMI, and kidney\nfunction, we found a significant asso-\nciation between blood lead and sys-\ntolic and diastolic hypertension preva-\nin the US population. We selected this\npopulation to analyze the role of meno-\npausal status, which we and others have\nshown can influence blood lead levels\nthe age range at which the risks for hy-\npertension increase markedly in wom-\n(mean, 6.3 \u00b5g/dL) was associated with\na 3.4-fold increase in the risks of dias-\nrelative to those in the lowest blood lead\nquartile (mean, 1.0 \u00b5g/dL). These risks\nwere considerably higher for postmeno-\npausal women. In addition, blood lead\nwas a significant, positive predictor of\nboth elevated systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure in these women. A dif-\nference in blood lead levels between the\nlowest quartile and the highest quar-\ntile was associated with a difference of\n1.7 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure\nand 1.4 mm Hg in diastolic blood pres-\nsure. Blood lead is among the few pre-\ndictors of both systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures in perimenopausal US\nwomen. Per unit change, blood lead was\na stronger predictor of diastolic blood\npressure than age.\nThe results are consistent with those\nof Korrick et al,7 who found an asso-\nciation between self-reported hyper-\ntension and bone lead in older women.\nIn a study of 45-year-old women liv-\ning in Copenhagen County, Den-\nmark, higher blood lead levels were as-\nsociated with elevated diastolic blood\npressure.29 Neither study accounted for\nmenopausal status in either blood lead\nlevel or hypertension analyses.\nIn analyses of systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures, the relationship be-\ntweenbloodleadandbloodpressurewas\nnot stronger for blacks than for whites,\nnor did blood lead levels explain racial\ndifferences in hypertension preva-\nlence. In fact, the blood lead and hyper-\ntension relationships reported ap-\npeared to be less pronounced among\nblacks compared with the cohort as a\nwhole. However, stratification of the co-\nhort by race and ethnicity resulted in\nsmall sample sizes in each blood lead\nquartile, limiting precision.\nThe associations of blood lead with\nsystolic and diastolic hypertension were\nmuch more pronounced for postmeno-\npausal women than for premenopausal\nwomen. The reasons for this associa-\ntion are unclear. Postmenopausal\nwomen may be more sensitive to the hy-\npertensive effects of lead because of loss\nofestrogenatmenopause.44 Estrogenhas\nbeen postulated to protect women from\nage-related increases in blood pres-\nsure,44 although results from a large\nrandomized clinical trial have not sup-\nported this hypothesis.45 This observa-\ntion also may reflect complex relation-\nships between bone lead and blood lead,\nwhicharealteredbythechangesinbone\nmineral metabolism that accompany the\nmenopausal transition.\nWhether lead affects blood pressure\nthrough altering kidney function in hu-\nmans is not known. Lead is nephro-\ntoxic to humans, and alteration of\nkidney function may precede the devel-\nopment of hypertension.7,8 Kidney func-\ntion, as measured by serum creatinine,\nwas found to be significantly positively\nassociated with both systolic and dias-\ntolic blood pressures in premeno-\npausal women who are untreated for\nTable 4.

Perhaps this reflects that\nthe kidney can be a common pathway\nfor blood pressure regulation, and the\neffect of lead on the kidney is only part\noftherelationshipbetweenkidneyfunc-\ntion and blood pressure. However, con-\ntrolling for kidney function did not re-\nduce the association of blood lead with\nblood pressure and hypertension, as\nwould be expected if kidney function\nwere along the causal pathway. In the\npresent investigation, serum creatinine\nwas both a sensitive and significant pre-\ndictor of general hypertension in pre-\nmenopausal women. For every unit in-\ncrease in serum creatinine, the risks of\nhypertensionincreasedmorethan7-fold\na significant association between lead\nandgeneralhypertensionwasnotfound.\nThe mechanisms of lead-induced hy-\npertension are not well-characterized,\neven in animal models. One hypoth-\nesis is that lead induces hypertension\nthrough direct effects on the kidney. A\nrecentretrospectivestudyof509healthy\nparticipants of the Normative Aging\nStudy found blood lead levels to be sig-\nnificantly positively correlated with se-\nrum creatinine levels.41 A study of lead-\nexposed workers, with high blood lead\nlevels (mean, 37 \u00b5g/dL), reported in-\ncreases in diastolic blood pressure and\nin levels of urinary biomarkers for re-\nnal function.7 Batuman et al46 reported\nthat patients with essential hyperten-\nsionwhohadreducedrenalfunctionhad\nsignificantly more chelatable lead than\nthose with essential hypertension with\nnormal renal function.\nIn the present study, kidney func-\ntion measured by serum creatinine did\nnot appear to mediate the associations\nbetween blood lead and blood pres-\nsure. Thus, lead may act on blood pres-\nsure through effects on the vasculature\nor central nervous system, or more sen-\nsitive measures of renal function may\nbe required to test mechanistic hypoth-\neses.However,Staessen47 reportednoas-\nsociation between renal markers of lead\ntoxicity and blood pressure in a large\ncohort study of women.

An-\nother study59 also identified meno-\npausal status as an independent\npredictor of blood lead levels in a ran-\ndom sample of Scandinavian women.\nHu et al60 noted that bone lead may\nbe a more appropriate marker of lead\nexposure for chronic disease out-\ncomes such as hypertension. The pres-\nent study is a cross-sectional study in\nthat the exposures and the outcomes\nweremeasuredsimultaneously.Therel-\nevant exposures affecting blood pres-\nsure and hypertension may occur\nmonths or years before the observed\neffect. For example, the average BMI\nduring the 5 years preceding the blood\npressure measurement may have more\nexplanatory power than BMI mea-\nsuredonthesamedayasthebloodpres-\nsure. Likewise, cumulative lead expo-\nsure during the preceding decade, bone\nlead burden, or serum creatinine may\nbe more predictive of blood pressure\nthan blood lead level measured on the\nsame day as blood pressure. Evidence\nsuggests that bone lead stores can con-\ntribute to circulating levels of lead in\nThe findings of our study are incon-\nsistent with the notion of a latency pe-\nriod of months to years between the on-\nsetofperimenopausalbonelossresulting\nin increased endogenous lead expo-\nsure, followed by a chronic effect of lead\non blood pressure. A study by Cake et\nal61 suggests that bone lead released into\nthebloodmaybemorebioavailablethan\nlead resulting from environmental ex-\nposure. Therefore, if blood lead in peri-\nmenopausal women is more driven by\nbone lead levels, it is possible that blood\nlead levels may be a more sensitive pre-\ndictorofbloodpressureoutcomesinthis\npopulation, because it represents liber-\nated skeletal lead stores.\nImportant methodological chal-\nlenges exist in observational studies of\nlead exposure and blood pressure and\nhypertension. First, if an association be-\ntween lead exposure and blood pres-\nsure exists, lead is most likely respon-\nsible for a relatively small effect on\nblood pressure, and thus, this associa-\ntion may be difficult to consistently as-\ncertain in different populations. Sec-\nond, when examining small effects, the\nissue of residual confounding, beyond\nthat which is controlled in the analy-\nsis, becomes extremely important. In\nsuch cases, what may be interpreted as\na small effect of blood lead on blood\npressure may actually be due to inad-\nequate control of confounding fac-\ntors. However, the restricted age range\nchosen for this investigation helps to\nminimize the effect of confounding by\nage, which is strongly related to blood\nlead, blood pressure, and hyperten-\nsion. Third, because the mechanisms by\nwhich lead may act on blood pressure\nin humans are not well understood, in-\nvestigators may tend to include more\ncovariates than necessary in their mod-\nels or use mechanical, stepwise ap-\nproaches to modeling. The true size of\nthe effect may be decreased by over-\ncontrolling. This is a particular prob-\nlem in studies of environmental lead ex-\nposure, because blood lead levels are\nhighly correlated with race and ethnic-\nity, income, and education,10 which also\nmay be risk factors for outcomes such\nWhether bone or blood is the appro-\npriate biomarker for lead exposure in\nstudies of chronic disease outcomes is\nuncertain.60 Blood lead is a marker of\nrelatively recent exposures to lead.\nHypertensioninadultsthatmaybeasso-\nciatedwithpastexposurestoleadiscon-\nsistent with a follow-up study of lead-\npoisonedchildreninwhomtherisksfor\nhypertension were significantly higher\nthan they were in controls matched by\nage, sex, race and ethnicity, and neigh-\nborhood.50 Bone lead is a more appro-\npriate marker for chronic exposure;\nhowever, its interpretation depends on\nan understanding of bone physiology\nand events such as pregnancy and\nmenopause.11 Future studies of blood\npressure and hypertension should con-\nsider blood lead and bone lead as inde-\npendent factors influencing the risk for\nhypertension.\nThe R2 values in Table 3 suggest that\nvariation in systolic and diastolic blood\npressure, respectively. We interpret this\nto mean that much of the variation in\nblood pressure is random or due to un-\nknown or immeasurable factors. Be-\ncause blood pressure has been so well\nstudied, it is unlikely that there are un-\ndiscovered factors responsible for the\nremaining unexplained variation.\nOther factors that contribute to the\nvariation in blood lead levels observed\nin our study include measured and un-\nmeasured aspects of conventional and\nbonedensity\u00adrelatedpredictorsofblood\nlead, as well as other variables that were\nnot measured by NHANES. However,\nwe controlled for all of the known fac-\ntors associated with blood pressure and\nhypertention,3 including alcohol in-\ntake. This approach presumably mini-\nmizes residual confounding of our es-\ntimate of the associations of blood lead\nwith blood pressure and hypertension.\nVital status data are not yet avail-\nable on the NHANES III cohort. How-\never, a recent analysis of men and\nwomen from the NHANES II cohort by\nLustberg and Silbergeld62 found el-\nevated blood lead levels to be associ-\nated with a dose-related increase in\ndeaths due to hypertension-related\ncoronary heart disease and stroke for\nboth men and women. Although the\ntiming of NHANES II resulted in higher\nblood lead levels than our data in our\npopulation, the effects observed in our\nstudy also suggest that lead acts on the\ncardiovascular system and much lower\nlevels in the blood.\nFrom a public health perspective, the\nmost important and troubling implica-\ntion of these findings is that lead ap-\npears to increase blood pressure in\nwomen at very small increments above\n1.0 \u00b5g/dL, well below what is consid-\nered deleterious in adults. The mean\nblood lead level in this sample of\nwomen was 2.9 \u00b5g/dL. These results\ndemonstrate effects of lead at levels less\nthan the US occupational blood lead ex-\nposure limits (40 \u00b5g/dL) and even less\nthan the current Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention level of con-\ncern for preventing lead poisoning in\nchildren (10 \u00b5g/dL). Finally, the find-\nings from our study of associations of\nblood lead with systolic and diastolic\nhypertensionandbloodpressureamong\nwomen in the general population lend\nsupport for further studies on the health\neffects of bone lead mobilization dur-\ning the menopausal transition. These\nresults provide support for continued\nefforts to reduce lead levels in the gen-\neral population, especially women.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nNash, Magder, Lustberg, Sherwin, Rubin, Kaufmann,\nSilbergeld.\nAcquisition of data: Nash.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Nash, Magder,\nLustberg, Rubin, Kaufmann, Silbergeld.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Nash, Sherwin, Rubin,\nKaufmann, Silbergeld.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Nash, Magder, Lustberg, Sherwin,\nRubin, Kaufmann, Silbergeld.\nStatistical expertise: Magder.\nObtained funding: Nash, Silbergeld.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nLustberg, Silbergeld.\nStudy supervision: Nash, Sherwin, Rubin, Kaufmann,\nSilbergeld.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported with an\naward from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention/Association of Teacher's of Preventive Medi-\ngrant from the Heinz Family Foundation.\nREFERENCES\n1.
