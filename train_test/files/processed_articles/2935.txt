Until recent years, empirical evidence showing the\ndependency of financing structures was often lacking, prompting Myers (1984) to raise doubt\nif there would ever be such evidence.1\nHowever, in the past decade and a half several studies of corporations in a domestic\ncontext have been successful in identifying tax effects. MacKie\u00adMason (1990) found that the\nmarginal source of finance was influenced by the effective corporate tax rate by exploiting\ndifferences in the loss carry-forward position of firms.2 For firms with high loss carry-\nforwards the tax deductibility of interest has a lower value than for profitable firms. MacKie\u00ad\nMason also showed for a sample of U.S. corporations that firms with high loss carry-forwards\nindeed used less debt at the margin. Givoly et al. (1992) used a similar method and show a tax\ninfluence by looking at the natural experiment of the U.S. 1986 tax reform act. Gentry (1994)\ncompared U.S. firms that operate in special industries and can avoid the double taxation under\nthe U.S. corporate tax system with other firms that are subject to double taxation of corporate\nprofits. Indeed the first group of corporations shows a significantly different financing\nbehavior. Graham (1999) argued that empirically the tax rate of the personal investor plays a\nrole in corporate financing decisions. Gordon and Lee (1999) exploited the fact that in the\n1 In his presidential address to the American Finance Association Myers said, \"I know of no study clearly\ndemonstrating that a firm`s tax status has predictable, material effects on its debt policy. I think the wait for such\na study will be protracted.\"\n2 A similar result on tax loss companies is found in Bartholdy, Fisher and Mintz (1987) who also provided\nevidence that an increase in the federal-provincial statutory corporate tax rates resulted in the debt-to-asset to rise\nby 0.4 percentage points.\nU.S. smaller corporations are granted a lower corporate tax rate and find a significant effect of\nthis lower rate. Finally, Gropp (2002) showed a sizeable tax effect on the financing of\nmarginal corporate investment by exploiting local tax differentials for German firms.\nWhen it comes to international investments only a few studies have dealt with the\nrelationship between corporate taxes and debt and most have used data on U.S.-owned\naffiliates (Altshuler and Grubert (2003) and Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003)). One exception is\nJog and Tang (2001). Using Finance Canada data, they found that Canadian-controlled and\nUS-controlled multinationals debt was significantly influenced by corporate tax rate\ndifferentials with the United States. Another exception is Ramb and Weichenrieder (2004)\nwho consider tax differentials of parent companies for explaining intra-company loans of\nforeign-owned affiliates in Germany (German inbound FDI), including a majority of non\nU.S.-owned firms.\nThe following study uses a large panel set on German outbound FDI to reconsider the\nflexibility of financial structure with respect to taxation. Consistent with other studies we find\nthat the fraction of debt in total assets is positively related to the host country's corporate tax\nrate and the estimated marginal effects are of approximately the same magnitude. More\nprecisely we find that a 10 per cent increase in the host country's corporate tax rate leads to a\n5.6 percentage point increase in the debt ratio of wholly-owned manufacturing3 firms.\nWe also find two other results of interest. The first is that partly-owned foreign\nsubsidiaries react little to corporate income tax rate variation. We speculate that this might\narise from a conflict between the majority and minority shareholders that would need to be\nresolved through governance procedures. The second result is that German-owned\nsubsidiaries will adjust their internal financing from affiliates rather than their third-party debt\nwhen the corporate tax rate varies.\n3 Manufacturing is broadly defined in the data to include mining and utility companies.\n2 Descriptive Statistics\nTo study the tax effects on financial structure we selected from the micro data base of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank those firms that were operating in one of 68 countries for which we\ncould collect reliable tax rate information and were operating in manufacturing. We also\ndropped branches, which are a minor form of conducting foreign operations in manufacturing.\nThe firms in the Bundesbank database are owned either directly or via a holding company\nabroad (indirectly). All firm observations come from the years 1996 to 2002. Data on years\nbefore 1996 are in principle available but the panel structure has been lost due to data\nprotection measures. This leaves us with 13,758 firms that on average are observed over 3.9\nyears.\nGerman investors owning foreign affiliates are legally required to report on their\nforeign operations if it meets mild size and ownership requirements.4 These reports are the\nbasis for a recent data base by the Deutsche Bundesbank (see Lipponer 2003). Most of the\ninformation in the data refers to a reduced set of balance sheet information. On the liability\nside, which is on the forefront of this study, there is information on paid-up plus non-paid-up\nequity, capital reserves, loss carry-forwards, current profits net of taxes, debt, liabilities to\nGerman affiliated companies, liabilities to foreign affiliated firms, and other liabilities. Figure\n1 gives an overview of several financial ratios and their development during the period 1996 \u00ad\n2002. The left hand side graphs refer to German-owned affiliates that are directly held by a\nGerman parent firm. The graphs on the right-hand side refer to the sample of firms that are\nheld indirectly via a foreign holding company. The financial ratios have been constructed by\ndividing the respective balance sheet items by balance sheet total. Each of the panels includes\n4 There is a yearly reporting requirement for wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries if total assets of the foreign\nsubsidiary exceed the equivalent of 3 million (DM 1 million in years before 2002).\nfive lines that represent the respective financial ratio at the 5th, the 25th, the 75th, the 95th centil\nand the median.\nAll panels show that, at least for the respective median firm, financial ratios have been\npretty stable over the period 1996-2002. For some firms, equity or debt can reach more than\n100 per cent of balance sheet total as is indicated by the 5th centiles in Figures 1b, 1g, and 1h.\nTechnically, this is feasible if a firm has loss carry-forwards or current losses that enter\nnegatively on the liability side of the balance sheet. A somewhat unusual feature of the\nbalance sheets collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank is that they contain the yearly after-tax\nprofit prior to dividend distributions as a separate part of the equity of the firm. Therefore, the\nbalance sheets provide information on current profits even though the data base does not\ncontain formal profit and loss statements. For the median firm, current profits net of taxes are\naround two per cent of balance sheet total in all years, but at least five per cent of the firms\nhave profits of nineteen per cent or more. This is mirrored by a similar fraction of firms that\nhave a current loss of more than 20 per cent of total assets. The median debt-to-asset ratio is\nbetween 53 % and 58%. For more than five percent of the directly and indirectly-held firms,\ndebt exceeds total assets. Since losses may dramatically reduce total assets, which serve as the\ndenominator of the debt ratio, debt ratios can become extremely high and the data set even\ncontains eight observations with debt ratios exceeding ten.\nWhile directly and indirectly-held manufacturing firms show quite similar financing\npatterns for equity and total debt, they differ strongly when it comes to intra-company loans.\nAs panel 1i shows, the median firm in the directly held sample has no liabilities against\naffiliated firms outside Germany and 75 per cent of the firms have less than three per cent of\ntheir assets financed by those liabilities. This is different when we turn to those firms that are\nheld via an intermediate foreign holding. For at least 25 per cent of these firms, liabilities\nagainst affiliated companies outside Germany account for 28 per cent of total assets or more.\nWhen we look at the liabilities against German affiliated companies (including the parent),\nthen we see the opposite: the median indirectly owned firm does not owe money to a German\nfirm, while this is the case in the sample of directly-held firms.\nFigure 1: The Financial Structure of German-owned Subsidiaries\n(fractions of balance sheet total)\nFigure 1a: Paid-up capital and capital reserves, directly-held\nsubsidiaries\nFigure 1b: Paid-up capital and capital reserves, indirectly-\nheld subsidiaries\nFigure 1c: Profit and loss carry-forwards,\ndirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1d: Profit and loss carry-forwards,\nindirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1e: Current profits after taxes, before dividends,\ndirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1f: Current profits after taxes, before dividends,\nindirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1g: Total debt,\ndirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1h: Total debt,\nindirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1i: Liabilities against foreign affiliates,\ndirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1j: Liabilities against foreign affiliates,\nindirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1k: Liabilities against German affiliated companies,\ndirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 1l: Liabilities against German affiliated companies,\nindirectly-held subsidiaries\nFigure 2 gives an impression of the amount of assets represented in our sample firms.\nIn the last year of our sample, total assets (measured by balance sheet total) of indirectly and\ndirectly-held firms amounted to  288 billion. Total assets peaked in the year 2000 and\ndeclined after the burst of the New Economy bubble. Some part of the further decline in\nreported investment from 2001 to 2002 is due to an increase in the size threshold for the\nreporting requirement. Also, values can shift as exchange rates relative to the Euro (or Mark\nin early years) change overtime. Figures for directly-held firms have been affected more\nstrongly, as directly-held firms tend to be smaller than those held indirectly via a foreign\nholding company. When FDI is measured by size, Figure 2 shows a growing importance of\nindirectly-held firms compared to directly-held manufacturing subsidiaries.\nFigure 2: The Number and Assets of German-owned Manufacturing Subsidiaries\nNo. of firms Total Assets (in bill. )\ndirect\nindirect\nAnnotation: The lines refer to total assets (balance sheet total) measured on the right scale. The columns\nindicate the total number of firms measured on the left scale.\nWe also constructed a panel of corporate tax rates, which resulted in a cross-section of\n68 countries for the combined data set. For all countries the rates reflect the general corporate\ntax rates, including average local taxes, and have been collected at the University of Toronto's\nInternational Tax program, using information from Finance Canada, International Bureau of\nFiscal Documentation, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Bureau of Tax Policy Research at the\nUniversity of Michigan, KPMG, and other sources.\nFigure 3 provides some analysis of the tax rate information in our data set. The left\npanel of Figure 3 shows the distribution of tax rates according to our sample. For the period\n1996 to 2002 the bold line in the middle indicates the tax rate faced by the median firm in\neach year. The two lines above show the rates for the 95 and 75 centiles firms. The two lines\nbelow indicate the rates for the 5th and the 25th centiles. The right panel of Figure 3 reflects\nthe same centiles but ignores the number of German firms operating in a given country. It\nonly reflects the distribution of the unweighted national tax rates.\nFigure 3: The distribution of Host Country Tax Rates for German-owned Firms\nFigure 3a: Tax Rates faced by German-owned Subsidiaries\n(Country Tax Rates weighted by No. of German Firms)\nFigure 3b: Tax Rate Dispersion among Host Countries\n(unweighted)\nAs Figure 3b illustrates, the median tax rate in our set of 68 countries has come down from 34\nper cent to 30 per cent and only five per cent of the included countries tax corporations at a\nrate of 40 per cent or higher. While a downward trend is also visible in Figure 3a, this left\npanel suggests that German-owned manufacturing firms are relatively often located in\ncountries that have experienced a less pronounced downward trend in taxation. Of the 68\nwhile the remaining 41 countries did. The average standard deviation of the sample countries'\ntax rates equals 1.63 percentage points.\n3 Empirical Results\nThe fundamental hypothesis is that for firms in high-tax countries the benefit of the tax\nshield provided by debt finance is higher than in low-tax countries and therefore leverage\nshould increase with the local tax rate. To allow for the possibility that directly held firms\nreact differently to a tax change than indirectly-held firms, which are held via an intermediate\nholding company, we started with two tax variables. CTXDIR is zero if the firm under\nconsideration is indirectly held but equals the foreign corporate tax if the firm is held directly.\nConversely, CTXINDIR takes on the value zero if the firm is directly held by the German\nparent, but equals the host country's corporate tax rate otherwise. In cases in which the\nrestriction CTXDIR = CTXINDIR was accepted by a Wald test we introduced the new\nvariable CT, which equals the corporate tax rate. To allow for tax effects that are nonlinear in\ntaxes we also introduced squares of the tax variables (CT2 = CT2, CT2XDIR = CTXDIR2 ,\nCT2XINDIR = CTXINDIR2). To account for non-tax reasons for the amount of leverage we\nuse four macroeconomic variables for the host countries: real GDP growth (GDPGROWTH),\nthe bank lending rate from the IMF International Financial statistics (IBANK), the host\ncountry's nominal inflation rate (INFLATION) and the amount of bank lending to the private\nsector scaled by GDP (DOMPRIVCRED). We expect that growth in the host country should\nmake it easier to self finance investment and may have a negative effect on the demand for\ndebt. The interest rate should negatively affect the demand for debt, while a higher inflation\nrate (at a given interest rate) reduces the real interest rate and should favour debt. The variable\nDOMPRIVCRED captures the efficiency of the banking sector in the host country and may\npositively affect the amount of debt.\nTable 1 begins with the determinants of subsidiaries' overall debt to asset ratio. Three\ndifferent samples are considered. The full sample of all subsidiaries [column (1)-(3)] consists\navailability of macroeconomic variables for some host countries. Columns (4)-(6) present\nresults for up to 9,156 subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by the German investor, while\ncolumns (7)-(9) include up to 6,023 less than fully owned-subsidiaries. Since the Hausman\ntest generally rejected the validity of a GLS model, all regressions use a fixed effects model\nwith robust p-values, which have been corrected for errors correlated across country\nobservations and firm observations (clustering).\nModel (1) uses the full sample to regress the overall debt ratio on the host country's\ntax rate and fixed time effects (not reported), while model (2) additionally introduces the\nmacro variables discussed above. These simple linear models suggest that a one percentage\npoint increase in the host country's tax rate leads to a .19 to .3 percentage point increase in the\ndebt ratio of German subsidiaries. None of the macroeconomic variables in model (2) is\nsignificant in the full sample of firms and the hypothesis that all four variables are\ninsignificantly different from zero is accepted by a Wald test. The increased significance of\nthe tax variable CT in model (2) is largely owed to the loss of 1,210 firms in less-developed\ncountries for which not all of the four macroeconomic variables are available. Dropping the\nlost observations without including the macro-variables would yield a very similar increase in\nthe estimated coefficient. Firms in countries for which the macroeconomic variables are not\navailable seem to react with much less flexibility in determining their leverage decision.\nDespite their insignificance, the macro-variables show the expected signs. Growth and\nlending rates reduce reliance on debt while inflation and the liquidity of the banking sector\nincrease leverage.\nAs shown by the significantly negative coefficient of CT2 in model (3) there is\nevidence that the tax effect is concave in the tax rate. The estimates imply that a one\npercentage point tax rate increase in the host country causes leverage to rise by .41 percentage\npoints (evaluated at sample means).\nThe models (4)-(6) repeat the regressions (1)-(3) but rely only on wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. Throughout, the magnitudes of tax effects are larger than in the full sample. The\nresults from model (6) for wholly-owned subsidiaries imply that a one percentage point tax\nrate increase pushes up leverage by .56 percentage points (evaluated at sample means).\nColumns (7)-(9) report results for partly-owned subsidiaries. Here the tax rate loses\nsignificance, and the marginal effect of the tax rate is largely reduced. At the same time three\nout of four macro variables are now significantly different from zero. Wholly-owned firms,\nthat are under the control of a single German investor seem largely independent of credit\nmarket conditions, while firms with more than one owner have to revert to the external\nfunding and are more sensitive to conditions on the debt market. The comparison between\nwholly-owned and partly-owned subsidiaries points to the potential importance of governance\nissues. Since the multinational parent is a related party to an affiliate, conflicts arise in\ndetermining the appropriate financial policy when unrelated (minority) shareholders are\ninvolved. Coordinating several owners' may be difficult if these owners face different\nfinancing and tax conditions \u00ad after all, minority shareholders of a subsidiary do not benefit in\nthe same manner from world-wide tax minimization strategies desired by the parent.\nWe now look deeper into the leverage decision by decomposing debt into loans\nreceived from third parties and loans received from foreign and German affiliated companies\n(including the German parent). Table 2 shows tax and macroeconomic effects on third party\ndebt. Since the null hypothesis that the tax rate affects indirectly held and directly held firms\nin the same way was not generally accepted, the variables CTXDIR and CTXINDIR were\nkept and all results separately report the effects on both types of firms. Irrespective of the sub-\nsample considered, we find that the tax rate is insignificant in explaining third-party debt. For\npartly owned subsidiaries the estimated coefficients even show consistently the wrong sign.\nUnlike the findings for the overall debt ratio, this result is in stark contradiction to findings for\nU.S.-owned multinationals (Altshuler and Grubert 2003, Desai, Foley, and Hines 2003) that\nsuggest that the local tax rate is both influencing intra-company loans and third-party debt.\nTable 1: Taxes and the Debt-Asset Ratio of Foreign Subsidiaries\nAll subsidiaries Wholly-owned subsidiaries Partly-owned subsidiaries\nAnnotations: ***significant at 1%-level, **significant at 5%-level, *significant at 10%-level.

P-values in brackets are based on robust t-statistics\n(corrected for clusters within country cells and within firm cells). All regressions contained a set of time and firm dummies plus a constant;\ncoefficients are not reported. We excluded firms that on average over all year observations had a debt-asset ratio of unity or larger.\nUnlike for overall debt, the bank lending rate (IBANK) is now significant in all\nsamples, but as in the case of overall debt, it is more significant for partly-owned subsidiaries\nthan for wholly-owned firms. The estimated magnitudes are small, though. A one percentage\npoint increase of the interest rate tends to decrease the debt to asset ratio by roughly a tenth of\na percentage point for wholly-owned firms and some 13 per cent of a percentage point for\npartly-owned firms. The other three macro-variables have the expected signs but are not\nsignificant.\nTable 3 shows results for the ratio of German loans to balance sheet. Again the models\nthat include a quadratic term perform significantly better than simple linear models. While,\nevaluated at the sample means, we always find a positive effect of the tax rate on German\nintra-company loans, the results are not significant for partly-held firms (model 6 \u00ad 8). For\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, the coefficients of model (6) imply a marginal effect of the tax\nrate on leverage of .252 for indirectly-held firms and .408 for directly-held firms. For\nexample, we can expect that a one percentage point increase in the tax rate leads to a sizeable\nincrease in German loans that amounts to 0.25% to 0.41% of balance sheet total.\nFinally, Table 4 reports on the determinants of loans received from affiliated\ncompanies outside Germany. Here we find a strong difference between wholly-owned firms\nthat are held directly and those that are held via a holding. Only those firms that are held via\nan intermediate holding company show a reaction of their respective debt ratio with respect to\ntaxation. Unlike in the previous regressions the tax effect is linear and the inclusion of\nquadratic terms shows insignificant results. A likely reason for this is that even the bulk of the\nindirectly held firms has only a modest ratio of this type of loans to balance sheet total (cf.\nFigure 1l). We also find insignificant results for the sub-sample of partly-owned firms.\nMacro-variables seem to play an insignificant role for the magnitude of loans received from\naffiliated companies outside Germany in all samples.\n4 Summary and Conclusions\nThis paper is one of the first studies that empirically analyze the effect of company taxes on\ncomplex multinational financial decisions and it is especially unique in using non-American\ndata. Unlike most previous studies we have relied on statutory corporate tax rates rather than\nimplicit tax rates derived by dividing tax payments by pre-tax profits. Despite these\ndifferences our estimates are largely in line with results derived from U.S.-owned\nsubsidiaries. We find that a one percentage point increase in the host country's tax rate\nincreases the debt to asset ratio by some .3 to .57 percentage points. This result is broadly\ncomparable to results of U.S. studies (Altshuler and Grubert (2003); Desai, Foley, and Hines\n(2003)) and a Canadian study using statutory tax rates (Jog and Tang (2001)). However, when\nit comes to the specific instrument of financial flexibility, German-owned subsidiaries rely\nalmost exclusively on intra-company loans, while in U.S. studies the marginal effect of a tax\nchange has turned out to be larger for third-party debt.\nOur study is the first that separately analyzes wholly-owned subsidiaries and partly-\nowned subsidiaries. While wholly-owned firms experience a significant tax effect on their\nfinancial leverage, this is not the case for German subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned\naffiliates. This squares with the observation that the major instrument of flexibility is the use\nof intra-company loans. Coordination of (tax-) efficient intra-company (related-party) loan\nstrategies seems more difficult to achieve when there minority shareholder interests are to be\nprotected.\nBibliography\nAltshuler, R. and H.
