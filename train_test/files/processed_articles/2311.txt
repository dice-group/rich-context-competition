Multiple Chronic Conditions Among US Adults Who Visited\n Introduction\nMost research on adults with chronic conditions focuses on a single disease or condition, such as hypertension or\ndiabetes; little attention is focused on multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in 1 patient. This study compares, by selected\ndemographic characteristics, physician office visits by adults with MCC with visits by adults without MCC. We also\npresent findings on the most common MCC dyads and triads.\nAnalysis\nData source\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is a nationally representative annual survey of patient office\nvisits to nonfederal physicians. The NAMCS sampling frame includes all physicians in the American Medical\nAssociation and American Osteopathic Association master files, excluding anesthesiologists, radiologists, and\npathologists. The 2009 NAMCS (1) used a multistage probability design and included 1,293 physicians who completed\npatient record forms. The unweighted response rate was 62.1%, and the weighted response rate was 62.4% (1). This\nstudy included the 28,693 patient record forms that physicians completed for visits by patients 18 or older for NAMCS\n2009. We excluded visits by patients under age 18. Patient information recorded during the visit was abstracted from\nmedical records and entered onto the patient record forms.\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Multiple Chronic Conditions Among US Adults Who Visite...\nEstimates are based on sample data weighted to produce national estimates and include standard errors. Estimates are\nnot presented if they are based on fewer than 30 cases in the sample data. Estimates based on 30 or more cases include\nan explanation if the relative standard error of the estimate exceeds 30%.\nDefinitions\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Interagency Workgroup on Multiple Chronic Diseases\n(IWMCD) created a list of 20 chronic conditions common in the United States (2). NAMCS includes check boxes for 13\nof these conditions: arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\ncongestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, and\nstroke. A checked box for any of these conditions on NAMCS indicates that the medical record contains documentation\nthat the patient was given a diagnosis of the condition at some point, not necessarily during the current visit. The\nremaining 7 conditions on the HHS-IWMCD list -- autism spectrum disease, cardiac arrhythmias, dementia, HIV,\nhepatitis, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders -- do not have check boxes on NAMCS. A separate NAMCS\nquestion collects the primary diagnosis (as well as 2 additional diagnoses) for the current visit. If 1 of the 7 conditions\nthat are not on the checklist show up in the diagnosis question, we could have included that condition in the count of\nchronic conditions that we used for this study. However, if the same patient had visited the doctor for a condition or\nailment unrelated to 1 of the 7 conditions without check boxes, we would have no way of identifying that chronic\ncondition and could not include it in our count. Because we cannot accurately count the number of visits that patients\nwith these 7 conditions made, we excluded those 7 conditions from our study. We focus exclusively on the 13\nconditions with check boxes on NAMCS.\nWe summed conditions and grouped them into 3 categories (0 or 1, 2 or 3, and 4), with MCC defined as 2 or more\nchronic conditions per visit to a physician. We created dyads by summing yes responses for every combination of 2\nchronic conditions. We identified the most common dyads by patients with at least 2 of the 13 chronic conditions (n =\n9,871 unweighted visits). We created triads by summing yes responses for every combination of 3 chronic conditions.\nWe identified the most common triads by patients with at least 3 of the 13 chronic conditions (n = 4,986 unweighted\nvisits). In 2009, race data were missing from NAMCS for 24.4% of physician office visits, and ethnicity data were\nmissing for 25.7%. NAMCS staff used model-based single imputation to create imputed race/ethnicity variables.\nRace/ethnicity imputation is restricted to 3 categories (white, black, and other) on the basis of research by a NAMCS\ninternal work group that identified quality concerns with imputed estimates for race/ethnicity categories other than\nwhite and black. Extensive research was conducted on the imputation method and is described in more detail\nelsewhere (1). We combined the imputed NAMCS race and ethnicity variables to form 4 racial/ethnic groups: non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic persons of any race. \"Non-Hispanic other\"\nincludes Asians, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons of more than 1 race.\nNAMCS collects all expected sources of payment listed in the medical chart. We combined these variables into 4\nmutually exclusive insurance groups: public insurance (all visits with Medicare or Medicaid/Children's Health\nInsurance Program [CHIP]) as the expected source(s) of payment); private insurance (all visits paid for by private\ninsurance, provided the public insurance box was not also checked); and no insurance (visits with self-pay or \"no\ncharge/charity\" checked, provided that public or private insurance was not also checked); and other (the remaining\nvisits not classified into 1 of the first 3 groups, [visits paid for by Workers' Compensation and other types of insurance,\nand unknown: 2.4% of all visits]).\nNAMCS collects up to 8 medications that are documented in the medical chart as having been prescribed or provided\nduring the visit. NAMCS includes prescription medications, over-the-counter preparations, immunizations, and\ndesensitizing agents, and medications can be new or continued. Because NAMCS limits the total number of\nmedications that can be recorded per visit to 8, a record of 8 medications indicates that the patient has been prescribed\nat least 8, but the number could actually be higher. Only 9% of all physician office visits were made by patients with 8\nmedications, so limiting medications to 8 does not affect a large percentage of total visits (3).\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences among subgroups were evaluated with 2-tailed t tests by using P < .05 as the level of significance. A\nweighted least squares regression analysis was used to evaluate the significance of trends. All comparisons reported in\nthis article were statistically significant.\nResults\nPhysician office visits by sociodemographic group\nconditions made an estimated 326 million physician office visits representing 37.6% of all visits made by adults (data\nnot shown). The majority of all visits were made by non-Hispanic white adults. Adult visits were distributed evenly by\nage. An estimated 61.7% of visits were made by women. Approximately half of all visits were made by patients with\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Multiple Chronic Conditions Among US Adults Who Visite...\nprivate insurance and about a third was made by those with public insurance (Table 1). However, there was great\nvariation in insurance status by age. Only 17% and 19% respectively of visits made by those aged 18 to 44 and aged 45\nto 64 were made by patients with public insurance, whereas 80% of visits made by those aged 65 and older were made\nby patients with public insurance (data not shown). Private insurance showed the inverse, with 65% and 71%\nrespectively of visits by those aged 18 to 44 and aged 45 to 64 being made by patients with private insurance, whereas\nonly 17% of visits by those aged 65 or older were made by patients with private insurance (data not shown).\nPhysician office visits by patients with MCC by sex, age and race\nIn 2009, 29.2% of physician office visits were made by adult patients with 2 or 3 chronic conditions, and 8.4% of visits\nwere made by patients with 4 or more MCC (Table 2). Visits made by younger patients were less likely to be made by\npatients with MCC (9.3% of visits by adults aged 18 to 44 years had 2 to 3 chronic conditions compared with 32.4% of\nvisits by adults aged 45 to 64 and 44.4% of visits by patients aged 65 or older). This increasing trend by age for 2 or 3\nchronic conditions was seen for visits by men and women and for visits by non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black\nand Hispanic patients. The increasing trend by age for patients with 4 or more chronic conditions was also seen for\nvisits by both sexes and visits by all racial/ethnic groups for which we had reliable estimates.\nVisits by men (32.6%) were more likely than visits by women (27.0%) to be made by patients with 2 or 3 chronic\nconditions, and this trend persisted for visits by non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. For visits\nby patients younger than 65, visits by men were more likely than visits by women to be made by patients with 2 or 3\nchronic conditions. This sex difference persisted for visits by non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics aged 18 to 44, and for\nvisits by non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics aged 45 to 64. Visits by men and women aged 65 or older were equally\nlikely to be made by patients with MCC, regardless of race/ethnicity.\nPhysician office visits by patients with MCC by sex, age, and insurance\nWe found significant differences among visits made by patients with insurance (public, private, or other) and those\nwith no insurance (Table 3). Visits by patients with private insurance (23.7%), other insurance (20.2%), or no\ninsurance (16.0%) were less likely to be made by patients with 2 to 3 chronic conditions than were visits by patients\nwith public insurance (39.5%). This difference by insurance status persisted for visits made by patients with 4 or more\nchronic conditions.\nA greater proportion of visits by patients aged 65 and older with public rather than private insurance were made by\npatients with 2 to 3 MCC (45.5% and 39.5% respectively). At all ages, a greater proportion of visits by men with public\nrather than private insurance were made by patients with MCC. Visits made by women aged 45 or older with public\nrather than private insurance were more likely to be made by women with 2 or more chronic conditions.\nVisits made by patients with no insurance were less likely to be made by patients with 2 or more chronic conditions\n(18.6%) than were visits made by patients with public insurance (54.2%). We saw this same pattern for all ages and for\nvisits by both women and men.\nVisits made by men with private insurance were more likely to be made by patients with 2 or 3 chronic conditions\n(28.7%) than visits made by women with private insurance (20.7%). This sex difference persisted for visits by those\nyounger than 65. We did not find a statistically significant sex difference by private insurance-for visits made by\npatients aged 65 or older or for visits made by patients with 4 or more chronic conditions.\nwith public insurance to be made by patients with 2 or 3 chronic conditions. We did not find a significant sex\ndifference by public insurance for visits made by patients aged 45 or older or for visits made by patients with 4 or more\nchronic conditions.\nChronic condition dyads\nHypertension, the most frequently occurring chronic condition, appeared in 21 of the 29 chronic conditions dyads\nlisted in Table 4. The most frequent dyad was hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and its incidence increased with age\nfor women. About 16.6% of visits by women aged 18 to 44 with 2 or more chronic conditions were made by patients\nhaving both hypertension and hyperlipidemia. This number increased for visits by women aged 45 to 64 (31.9%) and\n65 or older (40.6%). More visits by adult men than women aged 18 to 64 with 2 or more chronic conditions were made\nby patients with both hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Diabetes with hypertension and diabetes with hyperlipidemia\nwere frequent dyads, appearing in the top 5 dyads for all age groups for visits by both men and women. Hypertension\nand arthritis was a frequently occurring dyad for visits by both men and women aged 45 or older, and frequency\nincreased with age. Unlike other dyads, visits by women were more likely than visits by men to be made by patients\nwith hypertension and arthritis.\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Multiple Chronic Conditions Among US Adults Who Visite...\nChronic condition triads\nAn estimated 179,518,000 physician office visits were made by patients with 3 or more chronic conditions.\nHypertension, the most frequently occurring chronic condition, appeared in every listed triad (Table 5).\nHyperlipidemia, the second most frequent chronic condition, was absent from only 5 of the listed triads.\nThe most prevalent chronic condition triad was hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. This was the only triad for\nwhich we could produce reliable estimates for men and women aged 18 to 44. More visits by men (48.9%) than women\nand older were made by patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia and diabetes. There was not a significant sex\ndifference for this triad for those aged 45 to 64. Another common chronic condition triad was hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, and arthritis, and more visits by women than men aged 45 to 64 and 65 or older were made by\npatients with this triad. Hypertension/diabetes/arthritis was also a common triad for visits by patients aged 45 or\npatients with this chronic condition triad. There was not a significant sex difference for this triad for those aged 65 or\nolder. Hypertension/hyperlipidemia/depression was another common chronic condition triad for visits by women\naged 45 or older and visits by men aged 45 to 64. We found no difference by sex. Ischemic heart\ndisease/hypertension/hyperlipidemia was a common triad for visits by men aged 45 or older.\nNumber of medications ordered or prescribed at visits for patients with MCC\nPatients without MCC were more likely to make office visits during which no medications were ordered or prescribed\n(Figure). For 30% of visits by patients with 0 or 1 chronic condition, no medications were prescribed. This number\ndecreased to about 15% of visits made by patients with 2 to 3 chronic conditions and 11% of visits made by patients\nwith 4 or more chronic conditions. Patients without MCC took fewer medications than did patients with 4 or more. We\nfound a decreasing trend by number of medications for visits by patients without MCC, and an increasing trend for\nvisits by patients with 4 or more chronic conditions. The trend was not significant for visits by patients with 2 or 3\nMCC. More medications were ordered or prescribed during visits for patients with MCC. For example, at least 8\nmedications were ordered or prescribed for 4% of visits made by patients with 0 or 1 chronic condition, but this\nnumber climbed to 18% of visits made by patients with 2 or 3 chronic conditions and to 37% of visits made by patients\nwith 4 or more chronic conditions.\nFigure.

Shows percentage of office-based ambulatory care visits in which 0 through 8 or more medications\nwere ordered or prescribed for each of 3 chronic condition groupings (0 or 1, 2 or 3 4) (1). [A tabular version of this\nfigure is also available.]\nSummary\nOur nationally representative study of office-based ambulatory care visits by adult patients with diagnoses of MCC\ncontributes new information to the field. About 37.6% of adult visits were made by patients with MCC. Visits by\npatients with MCC were not evenly distributed by demographic characteristics. Visits by women comprised more than\n60% of all visits. However, visits by men were more likely than visits by women to be made by patients with MCC.\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Multiple Chronic Conditions Among US Adults Who Visite...\nVisits by patients with MCC increased with age and were more likely to be made by patients with public insurance.\nHypertension was the most common chronic condition in both dyads and triads. Hypertension-hyperlipidemia was the\nmost common dyad, and these 2 conditions were the most common combination in the top triads, appearing in 17 of\nthe 22 listed triads for this study. The most frequently occurring dyads and triads that included arthritis occurred more\noften at visits by women than men. However, frequent dyads and triads of other conditions were more likely at visits by\nmen than women. More medications were ordered or prescribed during visits by patients with MCC than by patients\nwithout MCC. Visits by patients without MCC were more likely to have no or fewer medications ordered or prescribed\nthan visits by patients with 4 or more chronic conditions.\nOur study has limitations. Because the unit of analysis for NAMCS 2009 is an ambulatory care visit to a physician in\nthe United States, the number of visits rather than number of people are measured, so it is possible for the same\nperson to be counted multiple times. In addition, anyone who did not visit a doctor in 2009 was excluded from\nNAMCS 2009, including Medicare beneficiaries who did not visit a doctor. Thus, our results are not directly\ncomparable with results presented in the Chronic Conditions Among Medicare Beneficiaries, Chart Book (4).\nAccording to the chart book, about 16% of all Medicare beneficiaries did not visit a doctor in 2009, representing about\n33% of beneficiaries without MCC and about 9% of beneficiaries with MCC (4). The National Health Interview Survey\nvisits by patients aged 65 or older were made by patients with Medicare. NAMCS has check boxes for 13 chronic\nconditions, whereas the chart book tracks 15 chronic conditions (4); therefore, our results may undercount Medicare\nbeneficiaries with MCC. Despite these differences, we found that visits by patients with MCC were more likely to be\nmade by patients with public rather than private insurance.\nAs a nationally representative survey of office-based medical care, our study provides information about ambulatory\nmedical care received by patients with MCC by demographic characteristics and identified the most frequently\noccurring dyads and triads of chronic conditions.\n"
