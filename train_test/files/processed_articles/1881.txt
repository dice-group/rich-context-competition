The predominant concerns\nat this time include cardiovascular disease\n2005), autoimmune disease (Bagenstose et al.\nSheiner et al. 2003), neuropsychiatric effects\n2003), and subjective complaints (Fukuda\net al. 1999). Furthermore, many of these\nadverse health effects may occur at mercury\nlevels previously thought to be safe.\nThe fetus has been the greatest concern\nbecause permanent damage to the developing\nbrain can occur with methylmercury expo-\nsure. The U.S. Environment Protection\nAgency's reference dose for mercury was based\non a cord blood concentration of 5.8 \u00b5g/L\nand corresponds to a maternal intake of 0.1 \u00b5g\nHg/kg body weight/day. However, it has been\nargued that this concentration should be low-\nered to 3.5 \u00b5g/L, based on more recent obser-\nvations showing that cord blood mercury\nconcentrations are approximately 70% higher\nthan maternal concentrations (Stern and\nSmith 2003). It is of importance to note that\nmercury concentration across the placenta was\nnot considered when the reference dose was\nFish consumption accounts for most of the\ndaily intake of mercury compounds in the\nUnited States, with lesser contributions from\nelemental mercury from mercury vapor in den-\ntal amalgams. Urine mercury is a reflection of\ninorganic or elemental exposure, as occurs with\ndental amalgams, magical uses of elemental\nmercury, and herbs and medicines adulterated\nwith inorganic mercury. Only small amounts\nof methylmercury, which is consumed primar-\nily through fish consumption, is metabolized\nto inorganic mercury and excreted in the urine\nThere is also growing recognition within\nthe medical community of the clinical impor-\ntance of methylmercury exposure and of the\nconnection between blood mercury levels and\nconsumption of fish and shellfish products that\nare high in mercury. The American Medical\nAssociation (AMA) has advocated that physi-\ncians \"assist in educating patients about the\nrelative mercury content of fish and shellfish\nproducts and make patients aware of the\nadvice contained in both national and regional\nconsumer fish consumption advisories\" (AMA\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nhas reported total whole-blood mercury levels\nin children 1\u00ad5 years of age and in women\n16\u00ad49 years of age.

However, blood mercury levels\nin this group have not been identified in recent reports of the National Health and Nutrition\nMETHODS: We used NHANES data from 1999\u00ad2002 to obtain population estimates of blood mer-\ncury levels among women of childbearing age classified as belonging to the \"other\" racial/ethnic\ngroup (Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and multiracial; n = 140). Blood mercury levels in\nthis group were compared with those among all other women participants, classified as Mexican\nAmerican, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and \"other\" Hispanic.\nRESULTS: An estimated 16.59 \u00b1 4.0% (mean \u00b1 SE) of adult female participants who self-identified as\nAsian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or multiracial (n = 140) had blood mercury levels  5.8 \u00b5g/L,\nCONCLUSIONS: Study subjects in NHANES who self-identified as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native\nAmerican, or multiracial had a higher prevalence of elevated blood mercury than all other\nracial/ethnic participants in the survey. Future studies should address reasons for the high mercury\nlevels in this group and explore possible interventions for lowering risk of methylmercury exposure\nin this population.\nKEY WORDS: Alaskan Natives, American Medical Association, Asians, Centers for Disease Control,\nfish, mercury, methylmercury, multiracial, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,\nNative Americans, Pacific Islanders, reference dose, women.

Among\nthese, 236 participants had missing blood\nmercury results and were thus excluded from\nthe analytic sample (n = 3,637). Among the\nwomen included in the analysis, 1,377 self-\nidentified as non-Hispanic white, 1,106 as\nMexican American, 794 as non-Hispanic\nwere categorized as \"other.\"\nStatistical analysis. We obtained popula-\ntion prevalence estimates for blood mercury\nlevels  5.8 \u00b5g/L and  3.5 \u00b5g/L, respectively,\nusing appropriate sample weights (Stata statis-\ntical software for complex survey design;\nStataCorp., College Station, TX) (CDC 2005;\nNational Center for Health Statistics 2005).\nWe compared the estimated prevalence of ele-\nvated blood mercury levels among participants\nin the \"other\" racial/ethnic group with those\namong Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic\nwhites, and non-Hispanic blacks.\nTo determine whether observed differences\nin whole-blood mercury levels were most likely\nto reflect differences in dietary fish consump-\ntion rather than exposure to elemental or inor-\nganic mercury, we examined self-reported fish\nconsumption (number of fish and shellfish\nmeals in the preceding 30 days) among female\nNHANES participants 16\u00ad49 years of age (n =\n3,481) by racial/ethnic group. We also exam-\nined mean urine mercury-to-creatinine ratios\n(micrograms per gram) across racial/ethnic\ngroups (n = 3,551). These analyses were also\nconducted using sample weights.\nResults\nfemale participants who self-identified as\nAsian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or\nmultiracial (n = 140) had blood mercury levels\nIn accordance with the NHANES analytical\nguidelines, these prevalence estimates are sta-\ntistically reliable, because the relative SEs did\nnot exceed 30% of the point estimates. The\nprevalence of elevated blood mercury levels in\nthe \"other\" group is significantly higher than\nin all other racial/ethnic groups (Table 1).\nAmong the remaining participants (n =\nThe mean number of fish and shellfish\nmeals for the \"other\" racial/ethnic group was\nhigher than for the remaining groups, although\nthe 95% CIs overlapped with all except\nMexican Americans. Fish and shellfish con-\nsumption among Mexican Americans is lower\nthan among the \"other\" population. There\nwere no statistically significant differences\nbetween groups in urine mercury:creatinine\nratios (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn the United States, 4.1 million people iden-\ntified themselves as Alaskan Native or Native\nAmerican alone or in combination with one\npeople identified as Asian or Pacific Islander,\nwith 51% residing in the West, 19% in the\nSouth, 12% in the Midwest, and 19% in the\nNortheast. Asians, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan\nNatives, and Native Americans accounted for\nThe prevalence of elevated blood mercury,\nwhether this was defined as  5.8 \u00b5g/L or  3.5\n\u00b5g/L, was significantly higher among members\nof the \"other\" racial/ethnic group than among\nany other racial/ethnic group and primarily\nreflected differences in organic mercury expo-\nsure, most likely due to fish consumption.\nAlthough reports based on the most\nnot reported mercury levels for this group\ncant trend toward higher mercury levels in\nthe \"other\" ethnic group (Mahaffey et al.\n2004). Estimates presented here based on\ndemonstrate that levels of mercury in this\ngroup are statistically significantly higher than\nfor all other groups considered.\nOur findings are consistent with those of\nsmaller studies that showed a correlation of\nmethylmercury through fish consumption\nwithin the racial/ethnic groups that comprise\nthe \"other\" population of NHANES partici-\npants. The groups identified in these studies\nwere Native peoples of the United States and\nCanada (Beuter and Edwards 2004; Bjerregaard\nJapan (Fukuda et al. 1999), and American\nSamoa (Marsh et al. 1974). In fact, a recent\nrandom-digit-dial fish consumption survey\n(with subsequent hair mercury levels in women\ncontinental United States) found that Asians\nhad methylmercury exposures greater than\nthe reference dose 83% of the time, compared\nwith 12% for the total survey population\nAlthough NHANES was not designed\nto identify small subgroups at risk, it is\nHightower et al.\nTable 1.

It is\nimportant that both patients and clinicians be\naware that members of this group are at\nincreased risk for methylmercury exposure.\nFuture studies should address reasons for the\nhigh mercury levels in this group and explore\npossible interventions for lowering risk of\nmethylmercury exposure in this population.\nREFERENCES\nMercury and Fish: Consumption: Medical and Public Health\nIssues 2004.
