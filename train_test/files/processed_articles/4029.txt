NHERF1 and b-catenin protein and mRNA were quantified by Western blot and real-time\nfluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively, in kidney tissue samples from\nHan:SPRD (\u00fe/\u00fe) and (cy/\u00fe) rats. The effects of human recombinant NHERF1 on proliferation and\ncell cycle of ADPKD cyst-lining epithelial cells (WT9\u00ad12) were evaluated by MTT assay and flow\ncytometry, respectively.\nResults: Levels of NHERF1 protein and mRNA were significantly lower, and b-catenin levels\nsignificantly higher, in patients with ADPKD and Han:SPRD (cy/\u00fe) rats, compared with control\nsubjects and (\u00fe/\u00fe) rats, respectively. Exogenous recombinant NHERF1 significantly inhibited\nproliferation of WT9\u00ad12 cells and increased the proportion of cells in G0\nphase.\nConclusions: ADPKD is associated with a decrease in NHERF1 protein and mRNA levels.\nSupplementing exogenous NHERF1 inhibited the proliferation of WT9\u00ad12 cells.\n",
