    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe informal sector has become the major employer in Zimbabwe, but the sector is not contributing meaningfully to the\ntreasury due to noncompliance on tax remittances by the operators. The research was done on 50 businesses in the retail\nsector in Gweru. The findings are that minimal efforts are being put in place to enforce compliance, and corruption levels\nare high among the tax collection officials. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) evade compliance by paying bribes, keeping\ntwo sets of records, relocating to new premises without notifying authorities, and temporarily closing businesses during\ncompliance blitz. Penalties have been found to be the most effective in enforcing compliance. Publicity should be increased by\nauthorities using radio, television, and pamphlets, which were found to be most effective. In addition, the Zimbabwe Revenue\nAuthority (ZIMRA) should give business people more formal tax education to enhance understanding of tax obligations and\ncompliance.\n",

Mangudhla and Mambo (2013) reported that more than\n700 firms have closed while others are scaling down opera-\ntions. This to a great extent has a telling effect on govern-\nment income and projects.\nThe unofficial unemployment level in Zimbabwe has\nbeen pegged at more than 87% and as a result of job losses,\nabout 5.4 million Zimbabweans are employed in the infor-\nmal sector (Mhlanga, 2012). The informal sector has become\nthe major employer in the country but the majority of these\nconcerns are not registered for tax and other purposes.\nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency\n(ZIMSTATS), the largest number of employees was in the\nwholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motor\ncycles, constituting 52%, followed by other services and\nmanufacturing at 14%. Therefore, by extension the retailers\nshould constitute a significant portion of tax revenue for the\nauthority and therefore focus of this study will be on this sec-\ntor. The sector should now be filling the gap in revenue col-\nlection by government.\nRevenue collections for the third quarter of 2013 amounted\nresulting in a negative variance of 1%. The marginal nega-\ntive variance was due to the harsh economic conditions pre-\nvailing in the country and the sluggish economic conditions\nduring the run-up to the harmonized elections (www.zimra.\nco.zw).

However, the majority of play-\ners in the economy are not registered as they operate\ninformally. These fall outside the normal tax regulations and\nthus do not contribute taxes to government income.\nThere seems to be overemphasis on penalties by authori-\nties to induce payments and compliance on the part of the\noperators. The revenue headlined other income, presupposes\nthat the majority of this revenue will be outsourced from\nplayers in the informal sector in the form of prescriptive\ntaxes. From the returns, the expected income was US$45\nmillion and the actual income was only US$ 29.53 million\ngiving a massive negative variance of US$24.695 million or\n35%. This deficit comes despite the heavy penalties that the\ntax authorities charge on businesses that fail to pay taxes due\nto the informality of most business operations in Zimbabwe.\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) in its finan-\ncial statement actually acknowledged the impact of the harsh\neconomic environment on its performance but did not extend\nthis problem to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) opera-\ntors when they fail to pay presumptive taxes. It seems the\nSMEs are struggling to meet their ZIMRAobligations, which\nposition is made worse by the heavy penalties charged by the\nauthorities. This is a clear indication that ways have to be\nfound to cajole SMEs to pay taxes due by them to govern-\nment. Why are SMEs operators noncompliant with tax pay-\nments when failure results in heavy penalties? Is the penalties\nmentality by ZIMRA the best method to use in enticing\nSMEs to be compliant?\nThe objectives of this study are\ni. To assess the importance of regulatory compliance\nfor SMEs and its costs.\nii. To assess the level of compliance among SMEs and\nimpact on business operations of SMEs.\niii. To assess the communication methods used in\ninforming SMEs about regulatory developments.\niv. To provide a framework for assessing the impact of\nregulations on SMEs.\nLiterature Review\nGovernments' responsibilities are on the increase while\nsources of revenue are narrowing and as a result, the\nGovernment of Zimbabwe has found it necessary to extend\ntax collection to SMEs and the informal sector. The laws to\ncollect such revenue are in place but from Table 1 above\nmost SMEs players have not complied with the tax laws in\nexistence. The majority of people in the informal sector can\nbe classified as self-employed. According to Briscoe, Dainty,\nand Millet (2000), \"Historically the self-employed operative\nhas gained financially over directly employed counterparts\nthrough evasion of taxes and National Insurances contribu-\nthat the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency were\nbeing deprived of large amounts of revenue, a case that also\napplies to the Zimbabwean situation. In response to high lev-\nels of noncompliance in Ireland, the Office of the Director of\nCorporate Enforcement (ODCE) was established by the\nCompany Law Enforcement to enforce the Irish Company\nAct with the aim to reduce the business risks of noncompli-\nance by limiting the occurrence of fraudulent, dishonest, and\nnoncompliance behavior (Heneghan & O'Donnell, 2007).\nAs a result, Schmidt, Bennison, Bainbridge, and Hallsworth\n(2007) believed that the retail and service sector is now one\nof the most highly regulated parts of the U.K. economy, with\nthe introduction, implementation, and enforcement of new\nbusiness legislation resulting in substantial additional costs.\nSchmidt et al. (2007) stated that administrative costs\ninclude all the time and resources spent by owners, manag-\ners, and staff or hired expects to understand regulations, col-\nlect, plan, report, retain data, and fill in forms required by\ngovernments. Munnich (2007) contended that compliance\nTax head Actual US$ Target US$ Variance US$ % variance\nNote. VAT = value added tax.\nNyamwanza et al. 3\ncosts for SMEs is up to 6 times higher than those for large\ncompanies, a disproportionality that is particularly pro-\nnounced in the service sector. Three main reasons for this are\nthe scale of the cost as regulatory costs make up a larger\nproportion of overheads, the fixed nature of many compli-\nance costs that result in raising the breakeven points, and\nindirect costs from the diversion of entrepreneurial attention\nMany owners of SMEs feel overburdened with existing\nworkloads and find it hard to go through all their paperwork\nand stay up-to-date on legislation (Schmidt et al., 2007).\nAccordingly, SMEs have to bear the differential costs of, for\nexample, devising and administering more formal proce-\ndures for managing traditionally very informally handled\nstaff base, as well as the often higher variable costs associ-\nated with manual checks where larger businesses have auto-\nmated systems in place (Schmidt et al., 2007). For example,\nBriscoe et al. (2000) reported that the New Construction\nIndustry Scheme (CIS) brings with it new responsibilities for\nemploying contractors and these involved checking the\nvalidity of any presented certificates and recording any pay-\nments made on appropriate vouchers.\nInformation is also disseminated via the Internet though\nmany SMEs do not make use of this information source\n(Schmidt et al., 2007). They further stated that the lack of\nawareness of what needs to be done, and when there is\nawareness of oncoming regulations, individuals' perceptions\nof potential costs and benefits are often distorted, as illus-\ntrated by the owner of the farm shop who worries about get-\nting it wrong and only responds by avoiding rather than\naddressing the issue. Poor information can lead to overly\nexpensive compliance solutions, adding further costs as a\nresult of ignorance and misperceptions. Many run an SME as\na lifestyle and may adopt a victim stance, whereas a more\nproactive approach can do much more to support the long-\nterm success of business (Schmidt et al., 2007).\nBannock (2001, p.3) argued that, \"regulatory costs are\nreal resource costs which have alternative uses . . . if regula-\ntory costs could be reduced by, say, 2 percentage points of\nGDP, taxation on business could be increased by a similar\namount without business being worse off.\" Schmidt et al.\n(2007) believed that alternatively the resources could be\ninvested in the growth and running of SMEs, enabling them\nto continue to make a vital contribution to the U.K.\neconomy.\nBriscoe et al. (2000) reported that the authorities tried to\nclose loopholes in the legislation by, for example, making it\ncompulsory for contractors to formally employ the self-\nemployed so that they will be eligible to paying Pay as You\nEarn (PAYE) and National insurance. The other possibilities\nwere to transfer workers into Labor agencies and rehire their\nservice or to assist groups of self-employed to form into a\nlimited company (Briscoe et al., 2000). In addition, a system\nof fines and charges apply to contractors who failed to prop-\nerly implement the new scheme such as obtaining relevant\ncertificates with failure to obtain such certificates being\nforced onto the SC60 scheme, where basic rates of taxes and\nnational insurance are deducted at source from any\npayment.\nThere are other approaches to prompting greater compli-\nance rather than fines and tighter regulation. Schmidt et al.\n(2007) reported that their findings strongly support the pos-\nsible solutions proposed by the Public and Corporate\nEconomic Consultants (2004) whereby respondents asked\nfor fewer regulations, a reduction in the complexity and\npaperwork required, enhanced consultation prior to the intro-\nduction of new regulations, greater flexibility in compliance,\nas well as a one-stop-shop for providing information and\nsupport. They further stated that it would appear that most of\nthe issues raised in their study could be resolved via addi-\ntional advice and support mechanisms aimed specifically at\nSMEs and delivered through channels traditionally used and\ntrusted by SME owners.\nDespite the efforts of authorities to curb noncompliance,\nthere are obstacles to tax compliance, for example, Rusi and\nlocations that did not coincide with addresses found in the\ntax offices. This made it difficult for authorities to track tax-\npayers, resulting in massive tax evasion. An equally serious\nproblem, according to Fries, Lysenko, and Polanec (2003),\nwas that \"organisations both under reported actual sales to\ntax authorities and bribed them in order to reduce their fiscal\nburden. Customs appears as the highly corrupted institution,\nas nearly 90% of its officials resorted to dishonest practices\"\nSuch practices tend to compromise the ability of tax\nauthorities to collect enough revenue for the fiscus as high-\nlighted by Bitzenis and Nito (2005) that many firms in\nAlbania in the formal sector evade taxes to some extent by\nmaintaining \"two sets of books\" while unregistered firms\nhave a significant tax advantage because they evade the high\ntax burden. Most people do not believe in the tax system and\n10% of the sample believed that the taxation system is\nappropriate, 15% felt that it is partially appropriate and needs\nfurther incentives for improvement, while 71% claimed that the\ntaxation system is inappropriate and VAT rates were considered\nto be too high..\nThis attitude seems to prevail in the majority of would be\ntaxpayers in Zimbabwe and therefore taxpayers tend to resort\nto any method to avoid paying taxes. It will be interesting to\nsee what else ZIMRA is doing to boost tax collection from\nthe hitherto untaxed majority.\nMethod\nA quantitative study was adopted for the study with a view to\ngather information from the owner/managers of retail\n4 SAGE Open\noperators in Gweru regarding their attitudes and practices\ntoward tax compliance. The survey used questionnaires that\nmade use of the Likert-type scale, which were pilot-tested on\nrespondents from the retail sector. The list of respondents\nwas drawn from the shop licenses' list administered by the\nGweru City Council for licensing purposes. Random sam-\npling was used to select the respondents and 120 question-\nnaires were administered to these owner/managers of the\nretail shops. Fifty questionnaires were successfully com-\npleted and were useful for analysis in the study. Sixteen\nfemale and 34 male owner/managers participated in the\nyears, 18% were older than 35 years and 2% were younger\nthan 20 years. The data was entered into Stata 11 and ana-\nlyzed using linear regression analysis and correlation coeffi-\ncient. Supplementary interviews were used to gather\nadditional information from 10 of the participants.\nFindings and Discussion\ndents, which can point to the fact that there are more men in\nbusiness than females. A relationship was sought to find out\nif gender influenced compliance of owners and managers\nwithin the legal system. The results showed a weak relation-\nresults are indicative of a nonexistent relationship of the\ninfluence of gender on compliance of owners and managers\nin operating in a legal system. The demographics of the sam-\nthan 35 years. The older than 35 years age group was found\nto be generally compliant with regulation. Fifty percent of\nthe respondents were below 30 years, which shows that\nyoung people are starting businesses. The majority of the\nrespondents (84%) cumulatively have less than 5 years of\ntrading. There was no correlation between age and tax com-\npliance. There was no evidence that one's age influenced\ncompliance.\nThe level of education was also considered for its impact\non compliance of owners and managers on operating within\nthe legal system. The findings reflected a coefficient of\n0.185, which showed that there is a weak relationship\nbetween the level of education and the ability to operate in a\nlegal system, which means these variables are unrelated and\nthat education does not influence any compliance on the part\nof managers and owners. This seems to indicate that the edu-\ncation held by the owners could have failed to include tax\ncompliance on the part of business owners. This is reflected\nby the noncompliance rate indicating that the education\nmight not be relevant to business or tax issues.\nEighty-six percent of the respondents believe it is the\nresponsibility of the owner of the business to be compliant\nwith all legal requirements, 6% think that employees are\nresponsible for legal compliance of the business operation,\nand 6% respondents believe other individuals apart from\nowners and managers are responsible for legalizing their\noperations, and 2% did not respond to the question. These\nresults are reflective of the opinion that the owners are the\ncustodians of their business and the honor lies with them to\nlegalize their businesses because the owner at the end is\nlegally liable and not the employee.\nForty-five percent of the respondents indicated that taxes\nhave minimum impact on their business operations, whereas\n55% have indicated that the taxes have a high impact. These\nfindings are augmented by the results on compliance with\nrespect to PAYE legislation, where 67.35% indicated that\ncomply. The results show that there is very low compliance\nby SMEs on PAYE legislation that applies to them. On com-\npliance with income taxes legislation, the results collected\nshowed that 55.10% never comply with requirements of\ncomply with the said regulation. The low levels of compli-\nance among the SMEs are similar to what Bitzenis and Nito\n10% of the sample respondents believed that the taxation system\nis appropriate, 15% per cent felt that it is partially appropriate\nand needs further incentives for improvement, while 71 per cent\nclaimed that the taxation system is inappropriate and VAT rates\nwere considered to be too high.\nThe results indicate that most respondents do not believe\nin the tax system.\nEffort was made to find out the effectiveness of commu-\nnication channels used by regulatory authorities to raise\nawareness on compliance issues. Generally, 49% of the\nrespondents were of the notion that these channels are not\neffective, whereas 51% indicated that they are effective. On\nthe effectiveness of communication done through newspa-\npers, 47% of the respondents indicated that they are not\neffective, whereas 53% said they are an effective method of\ncommunicating compliance messages. Compliance mes-\nsages communicated through the Internet were found to be\nineffective (78%) with 22% showing that it is effective.\nRegulatory authorities also communicate to stakeholders\nthrough the use of compliance workshops. It was found out\nthat 29% of respondents agreed that they are informative and\neffective, whereas 71% of the respondents disagreed. The\nuse of pamphlets was also found to be effective, as indicated\nby 76% of the respondents, with 24% showing that they are\nineffective. The communication channels used to dissemi-\nnate compliance messages were further analyzed through the\nregression model and it was found that there is a positive\nrelationship between radio/television and pamphlets with the\ncompliance to the legal requirements of operating a business\nin the Zimbabwean environment. However, SMEs in\nNyamwanza et al. 5\nZimbabwe do not comply with legislation despite having the\nrelevant information.\nAuthorities take a number of measures in enforcing com-\npliance such as garnishing orders, closure of business prem-\nises, confiscation, and penalties. These measures were rated\nby research respondents in terms of their effectiveness as fol-\nlows: penalties (42%), closure of businesses (29%), garnish-\nrespondents also indicated that regulatory authorities are not\ntaking any action to enforce compliance. Evidence on the\nground revealed that ZIMRA officials only undertook blitz\nraid at designated times during the year. Those in the trans-\nport parked their vehicles until the blitz was over. Thereafter,\nthey would continue operations without fear until the next\nblitz period. Those operating shops adopted different strate-\ngies including closing businesses temporarily until the visit\nwas over or deliberately closing the business completely by\nderegistering with ZIMRA and reestablishing the business\nunder a new name.\nThe research also revealed that SMEs business owners\nhave adopted a number of strategies to avoid compliance\nwith the regulatory authorities, which include temporary clo-\nsure of businesses (16%), paying bribes (51%), understating\nprofits made (16%), keeping two sets of records (26%), and\nrelocating to new premises without notifying authorities\n(22%). Keeping two sets of accounts by SMEs is supported\nby Bitzenis and Nito (2005) who concluded that many firms\nin Albania, in the formal sector, evade taxes to some extent\nby maintaining \"two sets of books\" while unregistered firms\nhave a significant tax advantage because they evade the high\ntax burden. The findings on bribery (51%) and on lack of\nenforcement (21%) are fairly high, which affect the collec-\ntion of compliance fees and taxes in the country. Fries et al.\n(2003) concluded that \"customs appears as the highly cor-\nrupted institution, as nearly 90% of its officials resorted to\ndishonest practices.\" Relocating to new premises without\nnotifying authorities was identified as one the major ways\nthat SMEs use to evade the payment of compliance fees dur-\ning compliance blitz by ZIMRA officials. This was also\nwere found in locations that did not coincide with addresses\nfound in the tax offices, making it difficult for authorities to\ntrack taxpayers thereby resulting in massive tax evasion.\nTherefore, despite the high penalties, it was difficult to\ninduce payments from business operators as the latter always\nfound ways of avoiding payments. The other methods were\nconsidered cheaper by the business people, hence the high\nlevels of avoidance.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe findings indicate that the government is not fully tapping\ninto the informal sector to boost the revenue base. This is\nattributable to noncompliance tax regulations by the SMEs\nin the country. Results showed that many young people are\nstarting businesses and this may be explained by few oppor-\ntunities in the formal sector due to viability challenges facing\nindustry and commerce. However, no relationship was found\nbetween age and compliance among the small business oper-\nators, which indicates that there are other factors that explain\nthe phenomenon.\nMost SMEs were found not to comply with income tax\nand PAYE as most of them do not believe in the tax system\nand viewed them as too high; thus they greatly affect their\nbusinesses. They are considered burdensome as the process\nof complying is viewed as unnecessarily consuming owner's\ntime and is costly as most businesses do not have accoun-\ntants as employees and therefore depended heavily on con-\nsultants who charge high fees. This was despite the fact that\none operator interviewed indicated that presumptive taxes\nwere very affordable and required no accounting records.\nThe respondent indicated that setting aside US$5 per day\nwould sufficiently meet the presumptive tax obligation. He\nhowever, conceded that trying to raise the presumptive tax\nobligation would be cumbersome if not done over a reason-\nable time period.\nWhile SMEs were found not to comply with the pension,\nthere are high levels of compliance with council regulations,\nwhere most of these have trading licenses, and the high lev-\nels of noncompliance with ZIMRA and National Social\nSecurity Authority (NSSA) regulations can be attributed to a\nnumber of factors such as lack of awareness through public-\nity. The communication channels used by authorities are not\neffective to raise awareness and compliance. The Internet,\nnewspapers, and workshops were found to be the least effec-\ntive, whereas the radio, television, and pamphlets were\nregarded as the most effective, which means more publicity\nshould be done using the most effective channels.\nSMEs have adopted a number of strategies to evade com-\npliance, and on top of the list is payment of bribes to authori-\nties, showing high levels of corruption among the officials.\nTo evade high levels of tax, SMEs keep two sets of records,\nunderstate profits, and resort to temporary closure of busi-\nnesses during blitz. In other instances, businesses are relocat-\ning to new premises without notifying authorities. Dalu,\nMaposa, Dalu, and Pabwaungana (2013) focused on tax and\ncompliance by informal traders in the central business dis-\ntrict of Harare and they found out that most of them were not\nregistered and were not aware of their tax obligations. The\nactions taken by SMEs owner/managers are indicative of\nawareness of tax obligations, which is contrary to the views\nof Dalu et al. (2013) Furthermore, this study focused on shop\nowners and managers in Gweru and all the businesses that\nparticipated in the study are registered with the city council,\nand are in the taxpayers' database.\nIt is thus evident that authorities are putting in minimal\neffort to enforce regulations. Efforts must be made toward\nstamping out corruption among the officials in addition to\npublishing such practices on television and newspapers,\namong others.\n6 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nActing Business Reporter.
