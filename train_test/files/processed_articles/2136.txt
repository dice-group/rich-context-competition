Although its overt\nmanifestations, such as heart attack\nand stroke, do not usually emerge until\nadulthood, CVD risk factors are often\npresent during childhood and adoles-\ncence.1 A recent report indicated that\nyears had high low-density lipopro-\nsimilarly, 8% had a low high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level.2\nSeven percent and 14% of US adoles-\nhypertension and elevated fasting glu-\ncose, respectively, in the nationally rep-\nresentative study.3\nCurrently, the most prevalent CVD risk\nfactors observed among adolescents are\nanestimated34%ofUSadolescentsaged\nobese.4 Overweight and obesity have\nnegative health consequences that ex-\ntend beyond excess body fat and cos-\nmetic concerns. Research indicates\nthat being overweight or obese may\nplace adolescents at increased risk for\nCVD risk factors such as hypertension,5\nabnormal lipid levels,6 prediabetes/\ndiabetes,7 and increased C-reactive\nprotein.8,9 Because CVD risks present\nduring this period may track into\nadulthood,10 it is important to have\nan understanding of the problem\namong adolescents. However, no infor-\nmation on recent trends and preva-\nlence of biological CVD risk factors by\nweight status is available among US\nadolescents.\nThe current study focuses on CVD risk\nfactors using nationally representative\ndatatodetermineprevalenceofbiological\nCVD risk factors (prehypertension/\nhypertension, borderline-high/high LDL-C,\nlow HDL-C, and prediabetes/diabetes) by\nweight status (normal weight, over-\nweight, obese) and their trends among\nalsoexaminetheclusteringof theseCVD\nrisk factors among overweight and\nobese adolescents.\nMETHODS\nParticipants and Methods\nThe data used were from the NHANES,\na nationally representative, continuous\ncross-sectionalsurveyofthehealthand\nnutritional status of the US civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population. Annu-\nparticipate by using a complex, multi-\nstage probability design. The survey\noversamples non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans. NHANES data are\nreleased in 2-year increments; this\nanalysis was conducted with data from\nAcross all 5 cycles, 78% of those se-\nlected completed the physical exami-\nnation component in an NHANES mobile\nexamination center.\nAll participants in NHANES completed\na standardized household interview\nand a detailed physical examination,\nincluding anthropometric and blood\npressure measurements, and were in-\nvited to the mobile examination center.\nThose who were randomly assigned to\nthe morning session, which required\nafastingbloodsample,wereinstructed\nto fast overnight for 8 to 24 hours.In the\ncurrent study, only those who had fas-\nted at least 8 hours before blood was\ntaken were included in the fasting sam-\nple. Data for this group were weighted to\naccount for the complex survey design\nand nonresponse. Participants 18 years\nand older provided written informed\nconsent.Forparticipantsunder18years,\nparents also provided written informed\nconsent.\nThe initial combined sample for the 5\nwho took part in home interviews and\nwere examined at mobile examination\ndomly selected to provide fasting blood\nsamples for lipid and glucose testing.\nThose who reported being pregnant,\nhad a positive urine pregnancy test\nexcluded from the sample. The final\nlescents (Table 1).\nMeasurement and Definitions of\nCVD Risk Factors\nWeight Status\nUsing height and weight, which were\nobtained by trained interviewers dur-\ningthephysicalexaminations,andself-\nreported gender and age obtained\nduring home interviews, adolescents\nwere classified as being overweight or\nobese according to Centers for Disease\nControl age- and gender-specific per-\ncentiles for BMI.11 Overweight was de-\nfined as having a BMI percentile of\nsity was defined as being $95th per-\ncentile. Normal weight was defined as\na BMI percentile $5th to ,85th per-\ncentile. Underweight youth (BMI ,5th\npercentile) were excluded from the\nanalyses.\nTABLE 1 Sample Demographic\nCharacteristics, NHANES\nCharacteristic n %\nGender\nCurrent age, y\nRace/ethnicity\na Based on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control gender-\nspecific growth charts for the United States.

Normal wt was defined\nas having an age- and gender-specific BMI .5th to ,85th\npercentile.\nPrehypertension/Hypertension\nSystolic(SBP)anddiastolic(DBP)blood\npressure were used to identify ado-\nlescents who were prehypertensive/\nhypertensive based on an average of\nup to 3 measurements that took place\nduring the physical examination. For\nlines established by the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute that were\nspecificforage,gender,andheight were\nused to define prehypertension and\nhypertension.12 Prehypertension for\nthis age group was defined as having\na SBP or DBP reading that was $90th\npercentile to ,95th percentile, and hy-\npertension as having an SBP or DBP\n$95th percentile. Adolescents aged\nhypertensive if they had an SBP $120\nmm Hg to#89 mm Hgand hypertensive\nif they had a SBP $140 mm Hg or a DBP\nAbnormal Lipid Levels\nBorderline-high, high LDL-C, and low\nHDL-C were defined with standards\nestablished by the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program and the American\nHeart Association that were incorpor-\nated in the American Academy of Pedi-\natrics(AAP)lipidscreeningguidelinesfor\nchildren and adolescents.13 Adolescents\nwere classified as having borderline-\nhigh or high LDL-C if their level was\nrespectively. HDL-C levels ,35 mg/dL\nwere considered low.\nPrediabetes/Diabetes\nRecommendations from the American\nDiabetes Association were used to\nclassify adolescents with prediabetes/\ndiabetes.14 Those with a fasting plasma\ndL were classified as adolescents with\nprediabetes, and those with a level\n$126 mg/dL were classified as ado-\nlescents with diabetes. Given changes\nin the equipment used to measure\nglucose levels in the NHANES in the\nfactor was applied to fasting glucose\ncycles to allow foraccurate estimation of\ntrends in the prevalence of prediabetes\nand diabetes.1 Youth who reported that\nthey were diagnosed as being diabetic\nwere also classified as adolescents with\ndiabetes.\nDemographic Characteristics\nDemographic characteristics, including\ngender, age in years, and race/ethnicity,\nwere self-reported during the home\ninterview; classifications were non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nHispanic,Asian/PacificIslander,orother\n(eg,multipleraces).AdolescentsofAsian\ndescent and those self-classified as\nother are included in the overall analy-\nses, but individual estimates for these 2\ngroups are not reported because of the\nsmall samples, unstable estimates, and\nwithin group diversity.\nData Analysis\nFirst, we estimated the population\nprevalence and standard errors of the\ndemographic characteristics and the\nprevalence of BMI categories (normal,\noverweight, and obesity) for the entire\nsample (Table 1). Second, the propor-\ntion of adolescents with 1 of 4 CVD risk\nfactors (prehypertension/hypertension,\nborderline-high/high LDL, low HDL,\nprediabetes/diabetes) was examined for\nthe entire sample and then stratified\nbased on BMI category (Fig 1). Third, we\ntested for differences in the prevalence\nof each of the 4 CVD risk factors pre-\nviously mentioned and of overweight\nand obesity across the 5 study cycles\ntests (Table 2). Significant differences in\nthe number of these 4 CVD risk factors\n(0, 1, 2, or $3 risk factors) as a function\nof weight status and demographic fac-\ntors were assessed by using x2 tests\n(Table 3). The Bonferroni method was\nused to account for multiple compar-\nisons. Finally, we assessed combinations\npossible combinations) among over-\nweight and obese youth by examining\ntheir prevalence and clustering (Table 4).\nAnalyses were conducted by using\nSUDAAN statistical software to account\nfor nonresponse and the complex sam-\npling design of NHANES. Given limitations\nin the availability and continuity of data\ndiet, physical activity, and smoking, these\nfactors were not examined.\nRESULTS\nstudy, there were slightly more boys\nthan girls (Table 1; weighted data), and\nage was evenly distributed over the 2-\nyear categories. Nearly two-thirds were\nnon-Hispanic whites, and 34% of the\nstudy group was overweight or obese.\nThe overall prevalence for each of the 4\nrisk factors was .10%, with the ex-\nception of low HDL-C (Fig 1). Borderline-\nhigh/high LDL-C was the most prevalent\nrisk factor overall (22%), and a dose-\nresponse increase was observed be-\ntween abnormal LDL-C (ie, borderline-high\nor high) and weight classification, as\npercentages were 18%, normal weight;\nSimilarly, dose-response increase with\nweight category was observed for\nprehypertension/hypertension, low HDL-\nC, and prediabetes/diabetes. In addition,\na dose-response increase was observed\nbetween weight category and having\n$2 CVD risk factors. There was no sig-\nnificant change in the prevalence of\noverweight, obesity, prehypertension,\nhypertension, borderline-high LDL-C, or\nhigh LDL-C (Table 2), but a significant\ndecrease in low HDL-C (from 9% to 3%;\nP , .05) was observed when comparing\nthe prevalence of each risk factor in\nARTICLE\nsequent study cycles. During the same\nperiod, the prevalence of prediabetes/\ndiabetes (combined given the small\nnumber of adolescents with diabetes)\nincreased significantly (from 9% to 23%;\nP , .05). No other significant differ-\nences were found in the prevalence\nof each of 4 CVD risk factors within each\nat least 1 biological CVD risk factor\n(Table 3). Significant differences were\nobserved by demographic character-\nistics in the distribution of the number\nrisk factors by adolescent gender, age,\nand BMI.

Thus,\nthe results presented here indicate that\nfrom a population level, a large propor-\ntion of adolescents, regardless of weight\nstatus, would benefit from interventions\nsuch as Let's Move15,16 and programs that\npromote overall healthy lifestyles, in-\ncluding physical activity, healthy diet,\nand healthy weight maintenance.\nOur findings are concerning given\ngrowing evidence demonstrating that\nCVD risk factors present during child-\nhood may persist into adulthood.10\nMoreover, atherosclerosis, a complex,\nmultifactorial disease that affects mil-\nlions of adults, may be first observed in\nchildhood as atherosclerotic changes\non the arterial wall.17 Carotid intima-\nmedia thickness, a measure of sub-\nclinical atherosclerosis, was found to be\nincreased in children with CVD risk fac-\ntors, especially if multiple risk factors\nwere present.18 However, the adoption of\nhealthy lifestyle behaviors appears to be\npromising as a counteractive force. For\nexample, results from the Cardiovascu-\nlar Risk in Young Finns cohort, which\nfollowed up for 27 years since baseline\nquent fruit consumption plus high\nphysical activity in childhood was asso-\nciated with an increase in the HDL/LDL\ncholesterol ratio, a decrease in BMI from\nchildhood to adulthood, and reduced\nprogression of intima-media thickness.19\nOur results indicating that the preva-\nlenceofprehypertension/hypertension\nand borderline-high/high LDL-C did not\nTABLE 3 Number of CVD Risk Factors Distributed Across Demographic Characteristics Among US\nDemographic Characteristic No.ofCVDRiskFactors(Prehypertension/Hypertension,Borderline-High/\nHigh LDL-C, Low HDL-C, or Prediabetes/Diabetes)\n% (SE) % (SE) % (SE) % (SE)\nGender\nRace\nCurrent age, y\na Relative SE estimate .50, estimate may be unreliable.\nb Based on the 2000 Centers for Disease Control gender-specific growth charts for the United States.

In contrast, we found\nthat the prevalence of prediabetes/\ndiabetes increased during this period,\nbut this result should be interpreted\nwith caution, given the approach used.\nWe identified prediabetes/diabetes by\nusing a single fasting blood glucose\nvalue, which may be a relatively unreli-\nable measure in children.20 Further-\nmore, a decrease in the prevalence of\nlow HDL-C was observed, but whether\nthiswas a true decline is not known. The\ndecrease may have been related to\nchanges in the protocol used to de-\ntermine HDL-C in NHANES.21\nThe plateauing of the prevalence of\nseveral CVD risk factors is not sur-\nprising when one considers that the\nprevalence of obesity, a frequent pre-\ncursor to the risk factors examined\nhere, did not increase significantly for\nmost youth in our or another NHANES\nstudy.4 Another state-level report has\nalso indicated small declines in the\nprevalence of obesity among youth.22\nResults suggesting a leveling off or\ndecline in obesity may be related to\nincreased attention to and awareness\nof obesity in the general population.\nObesity prevention efforts focusing on\nindividual and environmental changes\nmay have been beneficial in helping to\ncontrol CVD risk factors among US\nadolescents. In a recommendation is-\nsued in 2010, the US Preventive Services\nTask Force proposed to screen children\naged $6 years for obesity and offer/\nrefer them to comprehensive, moder-\nate to intense behavioral interventions\nissued Expert Panel on Integrated Guide-\nlines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk\nReduction in Children and Adolescents.10\nThe guidelines recommend classifying\nchildren's weight starting at age 2 years.\nIntensified diet and physical activity for\n8 months is suggested for children aged\nScreening for diabetes is also recom-\nmended among all children 10 years and\nolder with BMI percentiles $85, weight\nfor height, or weight .120% of ideal for\nheight by using fasting blood glucose.10\nBoth guidelines, however, recommend\nusing BMI percentiles11 for screening\noverweight/obesity. Still, concern has\nbeen expressed that obesity is under-\nrecognized and undertreated by pedia-\ntricians in primary care. According to\na nationally representative survey, al-\nthough 99% of respondents reported\nmeasuring height and weight at well\nvisits, only 52% of them used BMI per-\ncentiles for children aged .2 years.\nPediatricians in large practices and\nthose with recent obesity training were\nmore likely to screen for obesity by us-\ning BMI percentiles.24\nPrevious studies indicate that obese\nchildren are more likely than their\npeers to be screened for certain CVD\nrisk factors,25 but prehypertension/\nhypertension are often underdiag-\nnosed.26 This is disconcerting, given\nthe recommendation by the National\nHigh Blood Pressure Education Pro-\ngram and the AAP that children .3\nyears have their blood pressure mea-\nsuredaspart of any healthcarevisit.10,12\nThese guidelines also suggest differ-\nentiating between primary and sec-\nondary hypertension in all children\nwith diagnosed hypertension through\na comprehensive diagnostic panel. The\nlimited availability of data in the\nNHANES study precluded us from dis-\ntinguishing these 2 types of hyperten-\nsion. However, a retrospective study\nusing a different population found that\nprimary hypertension was the most\nprevalent type of hypertension in chil-\ndren aged 8 to 18 years and that it often\ncoexisted with a positive family history\nfor hypertension, an elevated BMI, and\nhypercholesterolemia.27 In our study,\nhaving a borderline-high/high LDL-C level\nwas the most prevalent CVD biological\nrisk factor for adolescents. The AAP ex-\npert panel recommends universal lipid\nscreening for all children aged 9 to 11\nusing nonfasting or fasting blood sam-\nadolescents 12 to 16 years, lipid screen-\ning is suggested if there is a family his-\ntory of premature CVD, high cholesterol,\nhigh BMI, diabetes, hypertension, or if\nyouth smoke or have conditions pre-\ndisposing to accelerated atheroscle-\nrosis and early CVD.10 Thus, these\nrecommendations addressed several\nconcerns that have been raised pre-\nviously regarding lipid screening in\nthe pediatric population, including the\nlow sensitivity of BMI or known family\nhistory as a criterion for cholesterol\nscreening, changes in lipid concentra-\ntions during puberty, and using a non-\nfasting lipid profile for screening.28\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force\nhas recognized that the benefits and\npotential long-term harms of lipid\nscreening, low-fat diets, and lipid-\nlowering medications among children\nhave not been studied adequately. Ac-\ncordingly, the Task Force has not made\nany recommendation for or against\nlipid screening among children and\nSeverallimitationsofthisreportshould\nbeconsidered.First,ourexaminationof\nCVD risk factors was not exhaustive; we\nfocused on biological risk factors only.\nThe emergence of CVD is multifactorial\nand determined in part by biological\nrisk factors; other factors such as\nfamily history and behaviors (eg, diet,\nphysical activity, smoking) are also\nimportantbutwerenotexaminedinthis\nstudy because these behavioral risks\nwere not available in this dataset for\nthis time period. BMI percentiles and\nthe other biological risk factors ex-\namined in this study lend themselves\nto easy, quick, and objective mea-\nsurement of CVD risk in the clinical set-\nting. The measurements of height and\nweight that we used to calculate BMI\nwere standardized in our study, and\nBMI is highly correlated with fatness.\nHowever, there are other measures\nthat may be better than BMI in pre-\ndictingCVDriskfactorsinchildrenand\nadolescents; specifically, measures of\ncentral obesity, including waist cir-\ncumference and waist-to-height ratio,\nmay be superior.30 Finally, given the\nlimited number of nationally represen-\ntative studies reporting the prevalence\nof CVD risk factors stratified by adoles-\ncent weight status and variability in\ndefinitions and/or range of ages in-\ncluded, it is difficult to compare the\nresults of this study regarding secular\ntrends with previous research. This\nhighlights the need for initiating sur-\nveillance of CVD risk factors among\nadolescents.\nThe results of this national study indicate\nthat US adolescents carry a substantial\nburden of CVD risk factors, especially\nthoseyouthwhoareoverweightorobese.\nAdolescence represents a window of\nopportunity for assessment of CVD risk\nfactors and the promotion of lifestyles\nthat will affect the development and\nprogression of CVD.\nREFERENCES\n1.
