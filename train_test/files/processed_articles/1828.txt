It has been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines\nand low-grade systemic inflammation activate bone resorption and\nmay lead to reduced bone mineral density (BMD), but no previous\nstudies have evaluated the association between the metabolic syn-\ndrome and BMD. We examined this relationship in a representative\nU.S. population-based sample from the Third National Health and\nMethods: We identified adult subjects enrolled in NHANES III with\nthe metabolic syndrome as defined by the criteria of the Adult Treat-\nment Panel III. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of femoral\nneck BMD (FN-BMD) for subjects with and without the metabolic\nsyndrome. Analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates and strat-\nified by quintile of body mass index.\nResults: Among 8197 persons at least 20 yr old who underwent\nAfter multivariable adjustment, FN-BMD was higher among subjects\ng/cm2; P  0.0001). When stratified by body mass index, FN-BMD was\nsimilar between subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.\nAdjusted FN-BMD increased with additional components of the met-\nabolic syndrome (P  0.0001 for trend), and there was a significant\npositive association with abdominal obesity (P  0.0001). A subgroup\nof subjects with diabetes had higher FM-BMD than those without,\nindependent of abdominal obesity.\nConclusions: In NHANES III, the metabolic syndrome was not as-\nsociated with reduced FN-BMD. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 92:\nTHE METABOLIC SYNDROME is a cluster of conditions\nwith detrimental effects on cardiovascular health and\na known association with low-grade inflammation (1, 2). The\nmetabolic syndrome includes obesity, dyslipidemia, im-\npaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension (3). The proin-\nflammatory state associated with the metabolic syndrome\nmay lead to a reduction in bone mass (4). However, obesity\nor high body mass index (BMI) is known to have a protective\neffect against osteoporosis (5). A recent prospective study\ndemonstrated that the metabolic syndrome reduced risks of\nnonvertebral fractures (6).\nOsteoporosis is common in various inflammatory condi-\ntions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythem-\natosus, and ankylosing spondylitis (7). Proinflammatory cy-\ntokines up-regulate receptor activator of nuclear factor-B\nligand, leading to increased bone resorption and osteoporo-\nsis (8\u00ad10). C-reactive protein (CRP) is a systemic inflamma-\ntory marker regulated by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and\nTNF-. Some have suggested that an elevated CRP is asso-\nciated with osteoporosis and nontraumatic fracture (4, 11).\nThe systemic inflammation related to the metabolic syn-\ndrome might activate bone resorption and lead to reduced\nbone mineral density (BMD).\nDespite the association between the metabolic syndrome\nand obesity, the hypothesized underlying inflammatory\nstate may lead to reduced BMD. However, no prior studies\nhave directly evaluated the association with the metabolic\nsyndrome and osteoporosis. Thus, we performed an analysis\nof the relationship between the metabolic syndrome and\nBMD in a representative U.S. sample from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,\nSubjects and Methods\nData source and subjects\nNHANES III was conducted by the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1988\nand 1994. The sample represents the civilian, noninstitutionalized pop-\nulation of the United States (12). We identified subjects aged 20 yr and\nolder with the metabolic syndrome according to the criteria of the Adult\nTreatment Panel III using NHANES III (3). Subjects were considered to\nhave the metabolic syndrome if they had three or more of the following\nabnormalities: abdominal obesity (waist circumference  102 cm in men\nand  88 cm in women); hypertriglyceridemia  150 mg/dl; low high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol  40 mg/dl; high blood pres-\nsure  130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication; or high\nfasting glucose  110 mg/dl or use of antidiabetic medication (insulin\nor oral agents). Femoral neck BMD (FN-BMD) measured with dual-\nenergy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was compared for the cohorts with\nand without the metabolic syndrome. Subjects without a DXA mea-\nsurement were excluded from the analysis.\nCovariates\nDemographic and medical risk factors predictive of reduced BMD\nwere considered potential confounders. In addition to gender, age, and\nrace, other important covariates included: BMI (kilograms per square\nmeter), smoking (current vs. former or never), alcohol intake (number of\ndrinks in the previous month), physical activity (metabolic equivalents/\nAbbreviations: BMD, Bone mineral density; BMI, body mass index;\nCOPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRP, C-reactive protein;\nDXA, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; FG, fasting glucose; FN-BMD,\nfemoral neck BMD; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; NHANES III, Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nJCEM is published monthly by The Endocrine Society (http://www.\nendo-society.org), the foremost professional society serving the en-\ndocrine community.\nPrinted in U.S.A.

Relevant chronic medical conditions included con-\ngestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (COPD), and nonskin cancer. We also examined serum\nlevels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (nanograms per milliliter), and serum\nCRP (milligrams per deciliter) as confounders (13). BMI was not in-\ncluded in the analysis because it generally parallels abdominal obesity\nfor definition of the metabolic syndrome. However, secondary analyses\nwere stratified by BMI.\nWe considered use of potentially relevant medications such as oral\nglucocorticoids, thiazide diuretics, hormone replacement therapy, 3-hy-\ndroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and\n-blockers. Users of osteoporosis therapy such as calcitonin, bisphos-\nphonate, or selective estrogen receptor modulators were sparse, so we\ncould not control for these medications. Total calcium intake (milligrams\nper day) was calculated by summing the average dietary intake plus the\nsupplements. Medication use was ascertained by asking, \"Have you\ntaken or used any medicines for which a doctor's or dentist's prescrip-\ntion is needed in the past month?\" and each medication container was\nchecked by the interviewer. Participants reported the duration of use for\neach medication.\nBMD\nAll analyses considered FN-BMD as the primary outcome and were\ncross-sectional comparisons. DXA (QDR 1000; Hologic, Waltham, MA)\nwas used with appropriate quality control measures (13). The BMDs of\nother anatomic sites were not available in NHANES III.\nStatistical analysis\nBaseline characteristics of subjects with the metabolic syndrome and\ncontrols were compared by Student's t test for continuous variables and\nPearson's 2 test for categorical variables. We used a multivariable linear\nregression model to assess the relationship between the metabolic syn-\ndrome and FN-BMD. The FN-BMD was also examined for each specific\ncomponent of the metabolic syndrome and by the number of compo-\nnents present. We repeated our analyses using more parsimonious mod-\nels, excluding a history of fractures and CRP levels. P  0.05 (two sided)\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\n8,197 eligible people who underwent DXA measurement. A\n6424 did not. The baseline characteristics of subjects with and\nwithout the metabolic syndrome were different (Table 1).\nCompared with controls, subjects with the metabolic syn-\ndrome were older; were more female and white; less fre-\nquently used tobacco; reported less physical activity, had\nworse health; were more frequently menopausal; had lower\nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and higher CRP levels; and\nwere more likely to have congestive heart failure, cerebro-\nvascular disease, COPD, and cancer. In addition, those with\nthe metabolic syndrome more frequently used oral glucocor-\nticoids, thiazides, hormone replacement therapy, statins, and\nTABLE 1.

The distributions of other variables\nwere similar.\nUnadjusted FN-BMD was reduced (P  0.005) among\npersons with the metabolic syndrome, but after adjustment\nfor age and gender and other covariates, it was higher in\nsubjects with the metabolic syndrome than in controls (P \n0.001). In analyses stratified by BMI, adjusted BMD in sub-\njects with the metabolic syndrome was similar to controls\n(Table 2). With the presence of increasing components of the\nmetabolic syndrome, there was a significant trend toward\nhigher FN-BMD (P  0.001 for trend) (Table 3). The adjusted\nCRP level increased with more components: CRP  0.17\nmg/dl for no component, 0.25 mg/dl for one component,\nfive components (P  0.001 for trend). We examined mul-\ntivariable linear regression models for each component of the\nmetabolic syndrome separately and found significantly\nhigher FN-BMDs in subgroups of people with abdominal\nthe role of obesity in the relationship between the metabolic\nsyndrome and FN-BMD, we conducted analyses stratified by\nabdominal obesity. The associations between the metabolic\nsyndrome components and FN-BMD remained the same (Ta-\nWe performed an analysis stratified on abdominal obesity\nexamining the potential relationship between low-grade in-\nflammation and BMD. Among male subjects with abdominal\nobesity present, we found lower BMD for those with CRP 1\n0.052). None of the other patient subgroups (men without\nabdominal obesity or women) exhibited a similar relation-\nship. When CRP was removed from the primary model, the\nadjusted BMD stratified by BMI was unchanged from the\nresults presented in Table 2.\nWe examined FN-BMD in light of the relationship between\nthe metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance and found a\ntrend toward higher BMD as fasting glucose (FG) level in-\nDiscussion\nIn this study of a representative the U.S. adult population,\nsubjects with the metabolic syndrome had an increased FN-\nBMD, compared with controls without the metabolic syn-\ndrome. This association was mainly driven by abdominal\nobesity, and stratified analysis by BMI showed similar BMD\nbetween subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome.\nWe also found a higher BMD as the number of the metabolic\nsyndrome components increased. We observed that higher\nBMD in the metabolic syndrome is largely determined by\nabdominal obesity. The protective effect of fat mass may be\nmultifactorial: not only does mechanical loading increase\nBMD, but high circulating insulin levels as well as factors that\nare cosecreted with insulin (e.g. amylin and preptin arising\nfrom pancreatic -cells) may promote bone formation (15).\nOur results are similar to those of previous cross-sectional\nstudies in that patients with diabetes had higher BMD (16,\n17). A recent study reported that the metabolic syndrome\nprotects against nonvertebral fractures (16). Insulin resis-\ntance is a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome, and\nprior studies demonstrated that circulating insulin levels\nand/or indices of insulin resistance are associated with bone\ndensity (18\u00ad20). Although type 1 diabetes may be related to\nbone mass reduction (21), longitudinal population-based\nstudy revealed that women with type 2 diabetes had a higher\nhip BMD at baseline but rapid bone loss over time (17).\nTABLE 3.

We also observed increased BMD with higher\nfasting glucose levels, a marker of insulin resistance. Because\nsubjects with high insulin resistance showed more inflam-\nmation than subjects with a low insulin resistance state (22,\n23), elevated inflammation in diabetes may eventually result\nin reduced BMD.\nA central question raised by this study is whether inflam-\nmation associated with the metabolic syndrome offsets the\nprotective effect of adiposity or diabetes on bone mass. The\nmetabolic syndrome is a complex set of conditions that in-\ncludes obesity, a factor associated with enhanced BMD, and\ninflammation, a factor thought to reduce BMD. In the pri-\nmary analytic models, we controlled for CRP but removed it\nfrom the parsimonious models. The different sets of models\ngave the same results. Whereas previous work suggests that\nosteoporosis is linked to inflammation, it is not yet clear\nwhether higher CRP levels are associated with bone loss (4,\n24). In the metabolic syndrome, we found a trend toward\nreduced BMD with higher CRP levels in obese men, but there\nwas no association between inflammation and BMD in other\nsubjects. The low-grade inflammation in the metabolic syn-\ndrome could affect BMD, but the protective effect of adipos-\nity or diabetes may counteract the negative influence of in-\nflammation on bone mass.\nOur study has several limitations. Because our data are\ncross-sectional, we have limited ability to assess the temporal\nrelationship between the metabolic syndrome and FN-BMD.\nAlso, we did not have DXA measurements on nonfemoral\nbone. It is possible that the effects of the metabolic syndrome\non BMD vary by anatomic site.\nIn conclusion, we found higher BMD among subjects with\nthe metabolic syndrome, in which obesity appeared to be the\nmain component increasing FN-BMD. Whereas adjusted FN-\nBMD stratified by BMI was similar between those subjects\nwith and without the metabolic syndrome, an increase in the\nnumber of the metabolic syndrome components and diabetes\nwere associated with a higher BMD. Longitudinal studies\nthat include more information regarding inflammation will\nbe helpful in better characterizing this relationship.\n"
