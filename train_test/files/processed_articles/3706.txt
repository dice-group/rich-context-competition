In turn, PGE2\nincreases AT1\nR activity.\nThe conversion of PGE2\nto the less active metabolite prostaglandin F2\n) via 9-ketoreductase interrupts this\nfeedback loop. The effects of diabetes on the interface between AT1\nare not well established. We\nhypothesized that in diabetes, an aberrant AT1\nR activity enhances the biosynthesis of PGE2\nand impairs the activity of\nPGE 9-ketoreductase, leading to accumulation of PGE2\n.\nMaterials and methods: Using microdialysis technique, we monitored renal interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin II\n(Ang II), PGE2\nin control and AT1\nR blocker, valsartan, treated diabetic rats (N=8 each). We utilized the PGF2\nratio as indirect measure of PGE 9-ketoreductase activity.\nResults: Diabetes increased renal interstitial fluid levels of Ang II, PGE2\nratio increased by the\nthird week, but declined by the sixth week of diabetes. Valsartan reduced PGE2\nlevels and increased Ang II\nand the conversion of PGE2\n.\nConclusion: Our results suggest that in diabetes, AT1\nR increases PGE2\ngeneration and reduces conversion of PGE2\nto\nwith the progression of diabetes.\n",

Negligible amounts of prostaglandins stick to the\npolyethylene tubes of the dialysis probes as demonstrated\n in the in\nvitro perfusate.\nAnimal preparation\nEight four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Hilltop Lab\nwere studied. All studies were approved by the University of\nVirginiaAnimal Care and Use Committee. For in vivo deter-\nminations of PGE2\n, the rats were placed under\ngeneral anesthesia with ketamine (80 mg/kg IM) and xyla-\nzine (8 mg/kg IM), and the left kidney was exposed by a left\nlateral abdominal incision. The microdialysis probes were\nplaced in the cortices of the kidneys while rats were under\ngeneral anesthesia. Opioid analgesia with buprenorphine\none day after surgery) was used as our pre-emptive analge-\nsia. No non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nwere used, given the impact of NSAIDs on prostaglandin\nrelease. All RIF measurements were made four days after\nimplanting the probes. For collection of RIF, the inflow tubes\nof the dialysis probes were connected to gas-tight syringes\nfilled with lactated Ringer's solution and perfused at 3 \u00b5l/\nmin. The effluent was collected from the outflow tubes of the\ndialysis probes for 60-min sample periods in plastic non-\nheparinized tubes and stored in \u00ad80\u00baC until assayed for PGE2\n. The animals were rendered diabetic using a single\ninjection of streptozotocin (30mg/kg, Sigma Co., St. Louis,\nMissouri) 14 days after insertion of the microdialysis tubes.\nBlood glucose from tail vein was monitored five days after\nSTZ injection (Accu-Check, Boehringer Mannheim\nCorporation). RIF samples were collected before STZ treat-\nment, and three and six weeks after induction of diabetes.\nExperiments were started every day at the same time (08:00)\nto avoid any diurnal variation of the measured substances.\nRIF samples were collected from conscious rats (N=8) prior\nto and five hours after receiving the AT1\nR antagonist valsar-\ntan (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland). Valsartan (10\nmg/kg) was administered orally by gavage. Kidneys were\nexamined for fibrosis or inflammatory response surrounding\nthe inserted dialysis probes.32\nAnalytical methods\nlevels in dialysate samples were\nmeasured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman\nChemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan). The sensitivity is 50 pg/\n, respectively, and the\nspecificity is 100% for both. The intra-assay and inter-\nassay cross-reactivity with arachidonic acid or other eicos-\nanoids was <10%.

Both systems are also strongly linked to the\ndevelopment of inflammation and the pathogenesis of\ndiabetes complications. However, the interface between\nprostaglandin and RAS in diabetes remained unclear and\nmechanistically vague. Prior studies have been hindered\nby the difficulty in continuous monitoring of early and\nlate paracrine changes in tissues of diabetic animals. The\nuse of the microdialysis technique allowed us to sample\nin real time and longitudinally in the same, live, and con-\nscious animals the interaction between renal cortical\nangiotensin II, PGE2\nbefore and after induc-\ntion of diabetes and in response to AT1\nR blockade. Here,\nwe demonstrate a role for AT1\nR in the increased biosyn-\nthesis of PGE2\nin diabetes and on the conver-\nsion of PGE2\n.\nIn alignment with previous reports22,26 under normal\nconditions, RAS activity is minimal with no effects of\nR blockade on Ang II, PGE2\nlevels. Also\nanalogous to our previous report under low salt conditions,\nwe have seen activation of the RAS in early diabetes with\na rise in Ang II generation and signaling through AT1\nR that\nmediated the increase in prostaglandins generation. Our\ncurrent study further clarified the effects of chronic activa-\ntion of RAS on prostaglandins release and the impact of\nthis on the regulation of prostaglandins\u00adRAS crosstalk.\nThe observed increased generation of PGE2\nand reduction\nin conversion rate of PGE2\nin diabetes provides a\nmechanistic explanation of previous reports that suggested\nan interaction between renin and prostaglandins36\u00ad38 and\nreveals a pathological positive feedback loop with the\nRAS (increased biosynthesis of prostaglandins and\nreduced conversion of the RAS-enhancer PGE2\nto the RAS\ninhibitor PGF2\n) in diabetes. The increase in the level of\nby the third week of diabetes was associated with a\nconcordant increase in the level of PGF2\nin the kidney.\nInterestingly, while the conversion of PGE2\nwas\ninitially enhanced by hyperglycemia, this rate of conver-\nsion declined by the sixth week of diabetes despite increas-\ning levels of PGE2\n. This paradoxical early increase in the\nconversion rate may result from either the increase in\nsynthesis or alteration in PGE2\nmetabolism by\n9-ketoreductase or both. A reduction in PGE2\n9-ketoreduc-\ntase activity, however, could only explain the later decline\nin the rate of conversion of the powerful pro-inflammatory,\nrenin enhancer PGE2\nto the less active PGF2\nin diabetes,\ndespite increased generation of PGE2.\nThe restoration of\nthis conversion rate with valsartan treatment supports the\nnotion that in diabetes, AT1\nR has an inhibitory effect on\n9-ketoreductase activity.\nIn the present study we observed a counter regulatory\nupregulation of RIF Ang II with valsartan treatment in dia-\nbetes. Previous studies suggested that treatment with AT1\nR\nantagonists are associated with a rise in plasmaAng II con-\ncentration as the result of inhibition of the AT1\nR-mediated\nnegative feedback on renin release.39\u00ad42 Previous studies\nhave also suggested that the resultant increased Ang II\nstimulates AT2\nR.43 Our current study suggests a role for\nR in reducing the activity of PGE2\n9-ketoreductase\nwith the progression of diabetes. We have observed an ini-\ntial increase in PGE2\n9-ketoreductase activity that was fol-\nlowed by decline as diabetes progressed; a potential role\nfor the anti-inflammatory AT2\nR cannot be excluded and\nmay explain the initial increase in the rate of conversion of\nat three weeks of diabetes (through an\nintact AT2\nR). With the progression of diabetes, increase in\nAng II and AT1\nR activity, a failure in AT2\nR may propagate\nthe reduced activity of PGE2\n9-ketoreductase. It is tempt-\ning also to speculate that the increased rate of conversion\nobserved with valsartan treatment dur-\ning the third week of diabetes is mediated through enhanc-\ning the activity of the unopposed and functional AT2\nR. We\npreviously reported a direct role for AT2\nR in modulating\nthe activity of PGE 9-ketoreductase.22,26 It is possible that\nthe use of AT1\nR blockade enhances the AT2\nR function in\ndiabetes.44 In addition, the observed increase in Ang II lev-\nels in diabetes could result from the less opposed inhibi-\nConclusion\nThe current study suggests that in diabetes,Ang II, through\nR, plays a critical role in generation and conversion of\n. With progression of diabetes, PGE2\nto\nconversion is impaired, leading to further accumu-\nlation of the potent pro-inflammatory, renin enhancer\nand the establishment of a vicious cycle between\nRAS and prostaglandins systems.
