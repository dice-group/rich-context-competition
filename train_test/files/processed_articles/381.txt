Regional body fat distribution has been\nassociated with non insulin-dependent diabetes melli-\ntus (NIDDM), hypercholesterolaemia, hyperinsulinae-\nmia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridaemia,\natherosclerosis and hypertension.1 \u00b1 5\nThere are several ways to measure body fat distribu-\ntion including anthropometric measures, computerized\ntomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nordualenergyX-rayabsorptiometry(DEXA).CTscans\nand MRIs and DEXA are the ideal measures of central\nabdominal fat, however, their use in large-scale studies\nis limited due to the expense of these procedures.\nAnthropometric measures are most commonly used in\nsuch large-scale epidemiological studies, although they\nonly provide an indirect estimate of abdominalbody fat.\nThe waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) has been the most com-\nmonly used anthropometric measure, however, recent\nwork suggests that using the waist circumference (WC)\nis more closely associated with measures of abdominal\nvisceral fat, that is, the fat most associated with the\nmetabolic problems listed above.6 \u00b1 8\nThere are known to be both genetic and environ-\nmental in\u00afuences on regional body fat distribution,\nhowever, it is still unclear how these in\u00afuences may\nvary among different age groups and in each gender.\nIt is important to obtain estimates for age effects and\ngender effects, because regional body fat distribution\nis known to increase with age and average values tend\nto be quite different for males and females.9,10 Genetic\nin\u00afuences have been estimated in several studies for\nWHR. In a family study of Mexican Americans,\ngenetic in\u00afuences were found to account for 17.3%\nof the variance in WHR.11 Other estimates have found\nWHR to be 28 \u00b1 50% transmissible; such estimates\ninclude both genetic and cultural factors (that is,\nshared environment).12,13 There are three twin studies\nwe are aware of that estimated WHR andaor WC in\nadults.

They used maximum likelihood methods\nwhich provide more power than the methods used\nby Selby et al.14 Rose et al 16 using the Kaiser\nPermanente Twin Study found a heritability of 61%\nfor WHR and 76% for WC in females, after control-\nling for BMI and age.\nThis is the \u00aerst analysis we are aware of that uses a\ntwinaadoption design to estimate the heritability of\nWHR and WC. Family studies, as with twin studies,\nmay overestimate genetic effects due to confounding\ngenetic and environmental factors, since relatives\nliving together share environments and genes. Twin\nstudies may overestimate genetic effects if monozy-\ngotic (MZ) twins share more environmental in\u00afuences\nthan dizygotic (DZ) twins. A design that reduces this\nkind of bias is one that combines twin studies with\nadoption studies. The Swedish AdoptionaTwin Study\nof Aging (SATSA) uses this design by comparing MZ\nand DZ twins reared together (MZT and DZT, respec-\ntively) and twins reared apart (MZA and DZA,\nrespectively).\nThe purpose of this analysis was to determine the\ngenetic and environmental components of variance in\nbody fat distribution, measured by WHR and WC, in\nSwedish men and Swedish women with an average\nMethods\nData for this study came from the Swedish Adop-\ntionaTwin Study of Aging (SATSA). The SATSA\nsample was identi\u00aeed through the Swedish Twin\nsame-sexed twins born in Sweden during 1886 \u00b1\nby contacting twin pairs identi\u00aeed in the Swedish\nTwin Registry as having been reared apart, along\nwith a matched sample of twins reared together.\nThose pairs reared apart were identi\u00aeed based on\ntheir responses to the item: `How long did you and\nyour twin partner live together in the same home?' All\npairs in which one or both members indicated that\nthey were separated from each other prior to their 11th\nbirthday were included for further study. The identi-\n\u00aecation and characterization of the SATSA sample\nhas been described in detail elsewhere.18 Measure-\nments of WHR and WC were obtained from a subset\nof 322 pairs of twins which includes pairs where both\ntwins may not have information on WHR and WC,\nwho underwent physical examinations between\nMeasures\nWC measurements were obtained at the circumfer-\nence around the smallest part of the waist, and hip\nmeasurements as the circumference around the widest\npoint between hips and buttocks. WHR was then\ndetermined by dividing the waist measurement by\nthe hip measurement. Age and gender were deter-\nmined by self-reported information during screening\nin 1984. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided\nby height squared (m2). Height (m) and weight (kg)\nwere obtained from subjects dressed in lightweight\nclothes with their shoes removed.\nStatistical analysis\nAnalyses included descriptive statistics and genetic\nanalyses. Descriptive analyses were performed using\nSAS,19 and included means and standard deviations as\nwell as correlations of WHR, WC and BMI.\nGenetic analyses were performed using Mx20 to\nevaluate quantitative contributions of genetic (addi-\ntive and dominant) and environmental (shared and\nunique) components. The assumptions using this\nmodel-\u00aetting analysis are that MZ twins share 100%\nof their additive and dominant genetic effects and DZ\ntwins share 50% of their additive genetic effects and\n25% of their dominant genetic effects. Twins reared\ntogether share similar rearing environmental effects\nand those reared apart do not share rearing environ-\nmental effects. This sample allowed us to partition out\ndominant, as well as additive, genetic effects, because\nthe SATSA sample contains twins reared together in\naddition to twins reared apart (see Figure 1). In\ntraditional twin studies, which only contain twins\nreared together, shared rearing environmental and\ndominant effects confound each other and therefore\ncannot be estimated separately.\nIn large multivariate samples, there is often missing\ndata. One twin may not have data for the variable\nbeing studied. To avoid having to discard all data\nfrom such pairs for analysis, we used Mx,20 a model-\n\u00aetting program that allows missing data to be con-\nsidered in the analysis. Since Mx uses raw data instead\nof variance-covariance matrices, the program does not\ngive an actual \u00aet statistic (that is, w2) for the overall\nmodel but gives instead a maximum likelihood statis-\ntic (minus two times the log-likelihood), based on the\nmultivariate normal function. Relative \u00aet of nested\nmodels can be evaluated by \u00aerst determining the\nmaximum likelihood statistic for a general model\nand then comparing to a more constrained model.\nThe difference between minus twice the log-likeli-\nhood of each model is distributed as a w2 with degrees\nof freedom being the difference in the number of\nparameters estimated in the two different models. So\nGenetic in\u00afuences on WHR and waist circumference\nTL Nelson et al\nfor example, if shared environmental effects were set\nto zero and compared to the general model (difference\nbetween minus twice the log-likelihoods), a statisti-\ncally signi\u00aecant w2 would mean shared environmental\neffects were a signi\u00aecant component of the variance\nfor the variable under consideration. The relative\nimportance of genetic and environmental in\u00afuences\non WHR and WC can be calculated by squaring and\nsumming the parameter estimates of components of\nvariance for each measure and dividing each squared\nparameter estimate by the sum of all the squared\nestimates of components of variance.\nSince both age and gender are known to affect WHR\nand WC, the analyses considered age as a covariate in\nthe model and gender differences were assessed. Since\nBMI was highly correlated with both WHR and WC\nbivariate analyses with BMI in the model, to determine\ngenetic and environmental variance in WHR and WC,\nindependent of BMI.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nFemale subjects were aged, on average, 67\u00c6 9 y and\nmale subjects were aged, on average, 63\u00c6 8 y. Table 1\nlists mean levels of WHR, WC and BMI by gender\nand rearing status. The mean values are about average\nfor this age range in the Swedish population.\nTable 2 shows the correlations by gender, zygosity\nand rearing status for WHR, WC and BMI. In general,\nintra-pair correlations for MZ twins were higher than\nthose for DZ twins, indicating genetic in\u00afuences.\nThere were differences in correlations between\nmales and females indicating possible gender differ-\nences in heritability for abdominal fatness. The nega-\ntive correlations for WHR in the male DZA and DZT\nand female MZA twins might suggest the twins'\nWHR scores are in opposite directions, however\nthese correlations were not signi\u00aecantly different\nfrom zero. In traditional genetic analysis, such corre-\nlations would limit our ability to assess genetic\nin\u00afuences, because all the information contained in\nall groups, regarding genetic in\u00afuences, is not used\nFigure 1 Univariate genetic model.

However, we used model-\u00aetting ana-\nlyses, which permits analysis of groups of twins\nsimultaneously. This method is more powerful at\ndetecting genetic effects because it uses all of the\ninformation in all of the groups in a single compre-\nhensive analysis.\nQuantitative genetic analysis\nTo assess whether males and females should be\nconsidered separately in this genetic analysis, a con-\nstrained model was tested, where the parameter esti-\nmates were set equal for males and females (see Table\n3 and Table 4). These models were signi\u00aecantly worse\ning males and females had signi\u00aecantly different\nparameter estimates for measures of WHR and WC.\nA reduced model, where dominant genetic loadings\nwere set to zero in both males and females, had no\nsigni\u00aecant loss of \u00aet compared to the full model, nor\ndid setting additive genetic effects to zero or shared\nenvironmental effects to zero. However, setting domi-\nnant and additive genetic effects and shared rearing\nenvironmental effects to zero, in males and females,\nresulted in a signi\u00aecantly worse \u00aet of the model. To\nfurther test this model, we set only shared rearing\nenvironmental effects and dominant genetic effects to\nzero, and this did not change the \u00aet of the model.\nHowever, setting additive genetic effects and domi-\nnant genetic effects to zero resulted in a signi\u00aecantly\nworse model indicating the importance of genetic\neffects on WHR and WC. To determine which\nmodel was the most parsimonious, we computed the\nAkaike's Information Criterion (AIC) (w2-2df). The\nmodel with the lowest value of this index \u00aets best,\naccording to the AIC. As can be seen in Table 3 and\nTable 4, model 7 was the most parsimonious\nmost parsimonious for univariate genetic analysis of\nBMI (not presented).\nTable 5 presents the percentage of genetic and\nenvironmental in\u00afuences for WHR, WC and BMI.\nIn males, additive genetic effects were found to\naccount for 28% of the variance in WHR and 46%\nof the variance in WC. In females, additive genetic\neffects were found to account for 48% of the variance\nin WHR and 66% of the variance in WC. The\nremaining variance in males was attributed to\nunique environmental effects (WHR, 72%; WC,\n54%) and in females the remaining variance was\nattributed to unique environment (WHR, 46%; WC,\n34%) and age (WHR, 6%). When BMI was added into\nthe WHR and WC models (Figures 2 and 3), it\naccounted for a portion of the genetic and environ-\nmental variance in WHR and over half of the genetic\nand environmental variance in WC.\nTo present the nature of the genetic and environ-\nmental covariances in another way, in Table 6, we\nhave reported phenotypic correlations for WHR and\nBMI, as well as WC and BMI, in both males and\nfemales. We then broke down the phenotypic correla-\ntions into a component due to genetic effects and a\ncomponent due to environmental effects. See Appen-\ndix for a description of the phenotypic correlation\ncalculations.\nTable 3 Test of models for genetic and environmental\nin\u00afuences on waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)\nDifference\nWHR likelihood df w2 df P-value AIC\n2.

In females, 40% of the genetic in\u00afuence\nwas unique to WHR and 8% was contributed from\ngenetic effects common to BMI, while 14% of the\ngenetic in\u00afuence was unique to WC and 52% was\ncontributed from BMI. These results also suggest\nthere are environmental effects unique to WHR, WC\nand BMI, and that both WHR and BMI, as well as WC\nand BMI, also have environmental effects in common.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study, was to estimate the effects\nof genetic and environmental in\u00afuences on regional\nbody fat distribution, as measured by WHR and WC.\nWe found an additive genetic in\u00afuence on WHR and\nWC, in both males and females. This genetic effect\nwas signi\u00aecantly different for males and females, and\nage was a covariate for females. The heritability\nestimates of WHR and WC are hard to compare to\nthose found in other studies, because of the different\nmethods used. For example, some of the studies used\nfamilies which in most cases meant they could not\nseparate out genetic effects from cultural or shared\nenvironmental effects. The Canadian Fitness Survey\nshowed WHR to be about 28% transmittable (this\nestimate included genetic and cultural effects).12 Data\nfrom the San Antonio Family Heart Study showed\nWHR to be 17.3% heritable, but this was with men\nand women combined,11 and among women in the\nIowa Women's Health Study13 it was found that the\nWHR was 40 \u00b1 50% transmittable, but once again they\ncould not separate genes from the shared environment.\nThe NHLBI study by Selby et al 14 suggested a non-\nhowever they used the classical estimates based on the\nintraclass correlations, which have low power and do\nnot use all the information simultaneously. Rose et\nal 16 found among female twins, in the Kaiser Perma-\nnente Twin Study, that WHR was 61% heritable while\nWC was 76% heritable, after adjusting for BMI\nand age. The study by Cardon et al 15 is the most\ncomparable to our data, because they used quantita-\ntive genetic analysis, however, they only used males.\nTheir results showed that genetic effects explained\n46% of the variance in WHR, while ours showed 28%\nof the variance was explained by genetic effects in\nmales. They also looked at what percentage of this\nvariance was shared with BMI and found that 12% of\nthe 46% genetic variance in WHR was explained by\nBMI, while our study found that 3% of the 28%\ngenetic variance was explained by BMI. The differ-\nences in these \u00aendings may be due to the potential for\nshared environmental effects to confound genetic\neffects and thus over-estimate heritabilities when\nquantitative analyses are made with only twins\nreared together. A twin study by Carey et al 21 used\nDEXA scans to measure central abdominal fat and\nTable 6 Genetic (G) and environmental (E) components of\nphenotypic correlations for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body\nmass index (BMI) as well as for waist circumference (WC) and\nBMI in males and females\nMales BMI Females BMI\nFigure 3 Multivariate genetic model for waist circumference\n(WC) and body mass index (BMI) in males and females.

DEXA scans provide a direct measure of\nabdominal fat and this estimate may be the most\naccurate of the above.\nBased on these studies, it is clear there are genetic\nand environmental in\u00afuences on regional fat distribu-\ntion, independent of overall body fat. The present\nstudy gives more insight into the genetic effects on\nmeasures of WHR and WC, as model-\u00aetting analyses\npermit the analysis of groups of twins simultaneously.\nWe were able to separate shared environmental effects\nfrom genetic effects and estimates were obtained for\nmales and females separately. This study also pro-\nvides estimates of effects in common with BMI. After\nadding BMI to the model we found some genetic\neffects in common, indicating that some of the same\ngenetic effects that are in\u00afuencing BMI are also\nin\u00afuencing WHR and WC. Of the genetic variance\nin WHR, ` 25% is in common with BMI in males and\nfemales, and over half of the genetic variance in WC\nis in common with BMI in males and females. The\ndifferences may be due to the nature of the measures,\nas we found WC to be more highly correlated to BMI\ncommon for abdominal fatness and overall fatness, as\nwell as a single genetic effect that may be unique to\npercentage of environmental effects in common for\nBMI and WHR, and over half of the environmental\neffects are in common between BMI and WC in males\nand females. Such common environmental in\u00afuences\nmay include overeating, lack of physical activity\nandaor alcohol consumption, as all of these have\nbeen found to be associated with indicators of abdom-\nConclusion\nBased on these \u00aendings, it is important to look at\ngenetic and environmental effects of regional body fat\ndistribution, in each gender separately, as well as to\nlook speci\u00aecally at age effects. Males tend to have\nmore abdominal fat than women. However, as women\nbecome postmenopausal, it is thought that these dif-\nferences become less pronounced. We did \u00aend age\neffects accounted for a small portion of the variance in\nWHR for females, however, we did not have the\npower to observe these age effects by cohort (that\nof menopausal status. Future studies may wish to look\nat whether the length of time women are postmeno-\npausal may be used as an indirect way of assessing\nhow much visceral or abdominal fat they may have.\nAge is also known to be associated with increases in\nabdominal fat, as people age, body composition\nchanges, more fat becomes deposited in the abdominal\nfat deposits and less on the periphery. More work is\nneeded to see if genetic effects are different among\nand b 80 y), as well as in each gender among these\nvarying cohorts. If there are different genetic effects at\ndifferent ages, there may also be different environ-\nmental in\u00afuences acting through the adulthood and\ninto old age, possibly through gene-environment inter-\nactions. Bouchard et al 23 has found a major gene,\naccounting for 51% of the variance in abdominal fat,\nas measured by CT scans. Once these genes are\nlocalized, genotyping can occur, and these potential\ngenetic and environmental interactions can be studied.\n"
