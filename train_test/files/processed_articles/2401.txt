Neylan, MD; Kristine Yaffe, MD\nAlthough much is known about the strong relationship\nbetweengeriatricdepressionanddisability,1-11 fewstud-\nies have examined the effect of anxiety disorders on\ndisability into later life. Of these studies, most have consid-\nered the association between generalized anxiety disorder\n(GAD) and disability.11,12 However, little research has investi-\ngated the burden of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)13 and\nthe occurrence of disability into later life.\nPrevious research has focused mainly on young veteran\npopulations to assess PTSD and functional impairment. In\nexamining archival data from the National Vietnam Veterans\nReadjustment Study, investigators found that middle-aged\nveterans with combat-related PTSD were at a higher risk of\nphysical limitations, not working, compromised physical\nhealth, and diminished well-being compared with veterans\nwithout PTSD.14 Research using the Veterans Affairs Norma-\ntive Aging Study examined the relationship between depres-\nsive symptoms and domains of functioning15 but did not\nconsider the effect of PTSD symptoms on similar domains.\nIn studies that have assessed community-based samples of\nolder adults, anxiety symptom scales have consistently\nfound a strong association between symptoms of anxiety\nand functional impairment.11,16 However, to our knowledge,\nthe association between PTSD and disability has not been\nstudied in a national sample using DSM-IV17 clinical diagno-\nsis criteria.\nIMPORTANCE Little is known about the association between posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) and disability into later life.

Moreover, we examine the chro-\nnicity of PTSD and its association with disability. We\nhypothesize that pre\u00adlate-life PTSD and persistent PTSD will\nbe associated with disability; however, persistent PTSD will\nhave a much higher magnitude of association compared with\nnoPTSD.Inaddition,disabilitywillbeattributedtoPTSDabove\nandbeyonditsrelationshiptomajordepressivedisorder(MDD),\nGAD, and other comorbidities.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES\nbidity Survey Replication, National Survey of American Life,\nand National Latino and Asian American Study), are nation-\nally representative surveys of 20 013 noninstitutionalized par-\nticipants 18 years and older in the United States. The sam-\npling designs and methods of the CPES have been described\nin detail elsewhere.18\nThe current sample consisted of 3287 community-based\nadults 55 years and older with a mean (SD) age of approxi-\nCPES data were obtained from the Inter-university Consor-\ntium for Political and Social Research.19 The institutional re-\nview boards of the University of California, San Francisco, and\nthe San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved\nthis study. Since this was an analysis of secondary data, pa-\ntient consent was not required.\nMeasures\nDiagnostic Assessment\nThe CPES psychiatric diagnoses were determined using the\nWorld Health Organization's World Mental Health (WMH)\nSurvey Initiative version of the Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI).20 The WMH-CIDI is a fully\nstructured lay interview that generates lifetime and\n12-month diagnoses according to the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases, Tenth Revision21 and DSM-IV17 criteria. In\nthe present analyses, the DSM-IV criteria were used. The\nprimary mental disorder examined was PTSD. We evaluated\nMDD, GAD, substance use disorders (including alcohol and\ndrug abuse or dependence), and several medical comorbid\ndisorders as confounders.\nChronicity of PTSD\nWe were able to determine whether onset of PTSD was in later\nlife (age 55 years) vs pre\u00adlate life (age <55 years) or whether\nit was persistent into later life (ie, age of onset <55 years and\nage at last diagnosis 55 years) based on age of onset as well\nas age at the most recent diagnosis, defined by the most cur-\nrent PTSD diagnosis or the last diagnosis at 55 years or older.\nWe defined 3 categories for PTSD chronicity during the re-\nspondent's lifetime: (1) no history of PTSD; (2) pre\u00adlate-life\nPTSD, which included age of onset and age at last diagnosis\nyounger than 55 years; and (3) persistent PTSD in later life,\nwhich included both age of onset younger than 55 years and a\nrecent diagnosis of PTSD at 55 years or older. Using this defi-\nnition, most (95.6%) respondents with persistent PTSD had a\ndiagnosis within the 12 months before their interview (65 of\n68), while 2 respondents had a diagnosis 1 year before and 1\nhad a diagnosis 7 years previously. Because we were inter-\nested in the chronic nature of PTSD into later life, we ex-\ncluded 27 respondents first diagnosed with PTSD after age 55\nyears. In addition, 7 respondents with missing data on age of\nonset and most recent PTSD diagnosis were excluded from the\noriginal sample.\nDisability\nDisability was defined by 5 domains (out of role, self-care, mo-\nbility, cognition, and social) of the World Health Organization\nDisability Assessment Schedule.22,23 Out of role was mea-\nsured by number of days during the past 30 days when the re-\nspondent was completely unable to work or carry out his or\nhernormalactivitiesbecauseofphysicalormentalhealthprob-\nlems. The other domains were a product of the frequency\n(number of days) and severity of problems (none, mild, mod-\nerate, or severe) that respondents reported experiencing in the\npast 30 days. All domains were scored on a 0 to 100 scale, with\nhigher scores indicating worse functioning. Because the do-\nmains were highly skewed, we examined binary outcomes of\nany disability (>0) in each domain. In addition, we created two\nglobal disability measures: (1) any disability measure, de-\nfined as any difficulty in at least 1 of the 5 disability domains,\nand (2) a standardized global disability score, computed by av-\neraging z scores of all 5 domains.\nOther Variables\nThe demographic variables included in analyses were age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-\npanic, or Asian), educational attainment (completed 0-11 or 12\nyears), marital status (married or cohabitating; divorced, sepa-\nrated, or widowed; or never married), and income defined by\nthe poverty index (ie, the ratio of household income to pov-\nerty threshold used in the 2001 US census and adjusted for\nhouseholdsize;categorizedaslow[1.5timesthepovertyline],\ntion, we determined smoking status, creating a dichotomous\nvariable for current smoking (yes or no). The medical condi-\ntions included in the analyses were those that are prominent\ninolderadultsandassociatedwithdisabilityandmentalhealth\ndisorders, that is, a history of stroke, myocardial infarction or\nheart disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, can-\ncer, and arthritis.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo produce nationally representative estimates, we imple-\nmented clustering and weighting techniques to reduce sys-\ntematic bias and imprecision imbedded in the complex sam-\nplingdesign.Thus,percentagesrepresentweightedproportions\nby PTSD group, with statistical differences estimated based on\nthe Rao-Scott 2, which corrects for the complex design.27 The\nPTSD and Risk of Disability in Older Persons Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

All analyses were also adjusted for demo-\ngraphic variables, current smoking, individual medical\nconditions (ie, arthritis, stroke, heart disease or myocardial in-\nfarction, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and can-\ncer), and lifetime MDD, GAD, and substance use disorders. We\nused any disability (ie, difficulty in any of the 5 disability do-\nmains) for logistic regression analyses and standardized global\ndisability scores (z scores) for the linear regression analyses.\nNext, logistic regression analyses were assessed in greater\ndetail, estimating the association of pre\u00adlate-life and persis-\ntent PTSD in later life with the 5 disability domains. The ref-\nerence group was no PTSD. To assess the confounding influ-\nence of other psychiatric disorders (ie, MDD, GAD, and\nsubstance use disorders), we examined 3 separate models:\nmodel 1, an unadjusted model; model 2, adjusted for demo-\ngraphic characteristics, current smoking, and medical condi-\ntions; and model 3, adjusted for variables in model 2 plus life-\ntime psychiatric disorders. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were\nestimated, along with design-corrected likelihood ratio sta-\ntistics and Wald 2 tests.\nStatistical tests were 2-tailed with P < .05 defining statis-\ntical significance.

In\nsummary, the findings show that persistent PTSD is associ-\nated with global disability. Moreover, persistent PTSD has a\nstrong association with all individual World Health Organiza-\ntion Disability Assessment Schedule domains of disability. Al-\nthough the statistical difference between persistent PTSD and\npre\u00adlate-life PTSD was not tested directly, persistent PTSD had\na higher magnitude of association with disability compared\nwithnoPTSD.ThisstudyconfirmsthatPTSDisahighlychronic\ndisorderandthatsuchchronicitycompromisesfunctioninlater\nlife.\nFew previous studies have considered the association be-\ntween PTSD and disability, and no study that we are aware of\nhas examined the chronicity of PTSD and its association with\ndisability in older adults. Our findings are consistent with re-\nsults from Vietnam veterans who experienced severe combat-\nrelated trauma. The National Vietnam Veterans Readjust-\nmentstudyfoundthatPTSDincreasedtheoddsofanyphysical\nlimitationby3-foldandraisedtheoddsofnotworkingby7-fold\njusting for demographics and medical and psychiatric\nfemale veterans (mean age, 46 years), those with PTSD had 2\nand 4 times more impairment in role functioning and social\nfunctioning, respectively, than those without PTSD.29 How-\never, unlike these other studies, our study is generalizable to\nthe larger population of older Americans, assessing chronic-\nityofPTSDintolaterlifeandexaminingglobaldisabilityaswell\nas multiple individual domains of disability.\nOf the previous nonmilitary studies, only one recent study\nthat we are aware of targeted older adults. Although this study\nfoundthatlifetimePTSDwasrelatedtomultiplephysicalhealth\nissues, including a reduction in role functioning in late life, the\nauthors did not assess other specific domains of disability or\nchronicity of PTSD.30 Other studies examined small samples\nthat included young adults. For example, a study of 368 pri-\nmary care patients 18 years and older found that those with\ncurrent (1-month) PTSD were more impaired in work, family,\nand social functioning scales than those without PTSD.31 In a\nmore recent study of 321 trauma-exposed primary care pa-\ntients 18 years and older, the authors found results similar to\nour study, where current PTSD was associated with the most\nimpairment (ie, work loss and social and family impairment),\nfollowedbyhistoryofPTSD,comparedwithnocurrentPTSD.32\nIn a sample of 95 individuals 19 years and older who survived\nthe2001WorldTradeCenterattack,highPTSDsymptomswere\nparticularlyassociatedwithsocial-occupationalimpairment.33\nAnother study, which assessed 49 patients with 2 or more post-\ntraumatic stress symptoms during their lifetime and 147 con-\ntrol participants 18 years and older in the community, found\nthat social, financial, physical (chronic illness and bed days),\nand psychological domains of disability were related to post-\ntraumatic stress symptoms.34 Our findings build on this pre-\nvious work by showing that the effect of clinically based PTSD\non function is evident at the population level and into later life,\nwhen individuals are most vulnerable to disability. In addi-\ntion, we assessed domains of disability, besides role and so-\ncial functioning, particularly pertinent to older age, includ-\ning mobility, cognition, and self-care.\nMultiple studies have provided evidence that depression\nis associated with functional impairment.1-11 However, find-\ningsthatPTSDisassociatedwithdisabilityindependentofMDD\nand other prominent psychiatric disorders has important im-\nplications.Thesefindingssuggestthat,ifleftunresolved,PTSD\nin older adults will have significant functional consequences.\nTherefore, by identifying chronicity of PTSD as a prominent\npredictor, we are able to show that monitoring and treatment\nof PTSD are imperative over the long term. In addition, al-\nthough not as encompassing as persistent PTSD, pre\u00adlate-life\nPTSDwassignificantlyassociatedwithspecificdomainsofdis-\nability (ie, mobility and social functioning) and only margin-\nally associated with cognition. These findings could be ex-\nplained by persistent effects of trauma exposure on functional\nstatus that are not related to having the diagnosis of PTSD or\nThe effect of chronic PTSD on disability in late life can po-\ntentially be explained by similar underlying mechanisms of\nMDD and disability. It is possible that PTSD itself is disabling\nor causes increased disability from other sources, such as\npoorer health behaviors.11 The persistence of symptomatic dis-\ntressarisingfromtraumaexposureoverthelongtermmayhave\nan adverse influence on health similar to models of allostatic\nload.35 This may be why individuals with persistent PTSD into\nFigure.

One possible pathway is through\ndysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical\naxisfollowingexposuretotrauma.36 Itishypothesizedthatdys-\nfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical sys-\ntem leads to increased glucocorticoid signaling and hippo-\ncampal degeneration, which, with repetitive stress responses\ntotraumacues,maypredisposeanindividualtoadversehealth\noutcomes. Another possible pathway may be through execu-\ntive-type cognitive impairments associated with PTSD.37\nFurthermore,ourfindingssuggestthatthepersistentPTSD\ngroup may be different in other ways besides their risk associ-\nated with function. The higher prevalence of adverse medical\nconditions in this group may suggest that persistent PTSD is an\nindicator of other health risks. Future studies need to examine\nother important adverse outcomes potentially associated with\nthis group, such as stroke, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus.\nThe strengths of this study include a large nationally rep-\nresentative sample of community-dwelling older Americans,\ninformation on clinically relevant DSM-IV PTSD, and care-\nfully measured disability domains. In addition, we at-\ntempted to carefully adjust for possible confounding from\nmedical and psychiatric comorbidities. Finally, we focused on\nthe effect of chronic PTSD. To our knowledge, our study is the\nfirst to examine the chronicity of PTSD into later life and its\nassociation with disability.\nThere are limitations of this study. First, the CPES sur-\nveys underrepresent older homeless and institutionalized\nadults. Thus, given this is a community-based sample of non-\ninstitutionalized older respondents, power for analyses and in-\nterpretation of results for the oldest-old respondents are lim-\nited. Second, even though the WMH-CIDI was shown to have\ngood concordance with the Structured Clinical Interview for\ntheDSM-IV,38 itisstillalay-administeredinterviewratherthan\na clinically administered assessment. Third, there may be is-\nsues of stigma, whereby older adults with mental illness might\nbe less inclined to participate in a mental health survey. Some\nrespondents with PTSD also may have been excluded from the\nstudy because of difficulty recalling symptoms. Although it is\npossible that older adults may be less likely to remember past\ntrauma, retrospective reporting of serious events such as\ntrauma is minimally affected by bias.39 Instead, there may be\na mortality effect, whereby traumatized adults are more likely\nto die at a younger age, resulting in an overrepresentation of\nnontraumatized older respondents.40 Fourth, the study was\nnot able to take the number of years with the disorder into ac-\ncount either in the definition or in the analyses. Further-\nmore, future research needs to examine other important co-\nvariates not accounted for in the current study such as\ndementia. Finally, the association between PTSD and disabil-\nity may be bidirectional, which suggests further investiga-\ntion in longitudinal analyses.\nConclusions\nOur study emphasizes the importance of improving the moni-\ntoring and treatment of PTSD over the long term. The impair-\nment in role functioning, mobility, cognition, and social func-\ntioning reflects diminished quality of life for older Americans\nwithpre\u00adlate-lifePTSD,particularlyPTSDthatpersistsintolater\nlife. Considering the projected expansion of the elderly popu-\nlation, increased life expectancy, and the health and eco-\nnomic costs of mental health disorders, the potential public\nhealth burden of PTSD implicated by this study is concern-\ning. Thus, future studies are needed to identify the reasons un-\nderlying PTSD's effect on disability and to investigate better\ninterventions that will reduce the risk of impairment.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Byers had full access to\nall the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Byers, Covinsky, Yaffe.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All\nauthors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Byers, Neylan, Yaffe.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: All authors.\nStatistical analysis: Byers.\nObtained funding: Byers.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nByers, Neylan, Yaffe.\nStudy supervision: Byers, Neylan, Yaffe.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by\nwhich was administered by the Northern California\nInstitute for Research and Education and with\nresources of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs\nMedical Center (Dr Byers), and in part by a K24\nNational Institute on Aging (Dr Yaffe).
