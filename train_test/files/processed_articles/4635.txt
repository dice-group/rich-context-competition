    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe majority of body image research has failed to measure what occurs beyond the immediate presentation of a body\nimage threat, or after a body image threat is no longer present. This is particularly true for physiological outcomes. The\npresent study examined psychological and cortisol responses to, and recovery from, a body composition assessment as a\nsocial-evaluative body image threat. Women (N = 64) were randomized into either a control or threat group. Participants\ncompleted a measure of social physique anxiety and provided a sample of saliva (to assess cortisol) at baseline, and immediately\nfollowing and 20 min following their condition. The threat group reported higher social physique anxiety following the\nthreat in comparison with both baseline levels and recovery levels. Cortisol was higher immediately following the threat in\ncomparison with baseline levels. Findings support the inclusion of a recovery time point in body image research to provide a\nmore complete picture of the psychobiology of body image experiences.\n",

Body image concerns are associated with a\nnumber of negative outcomes including lower self-esteem,\nincreased risk of depression, social anxiety, and eating\npathologies (Kostanski & Gullone, 1998; Levine & Smolak,\nthe potential negative implications of body image concerns,\nidentifying situations or the contextual factors of situations\nin which these concerns arise is important. Examples of spe-\ncific situations that exacerbate body image concerns include\nbeing seen in a bathing suit, being next to someone with an\nattractive/ideal physique, or having body composition\nassessed (Carron & Prapavessis, 1997; Hart, Leary, &\nQualitative research has explored situations of heightened\nbody image concerns (Bain, Wilson, & Chaikind, 1989;\nLamarche, Kerr, Faulkner, Gammage, & Klentrou, 2012;\nMyers & Rosen, 1999). For example, in their qualitative\nstudy, Lamarche and colleagues (2012) examined comfort-\nable and uncomfortable body experiences in young adult\nwomen. These authors found that the situations described\nwere social-evaluative in nature and included an element of\nbody exposure. Furthermore, coping mechanisms such as\navoidance or concealing behaviors were initiated to manage\nthose uncomfortable situations. Experimental studies have\nalso shown that situations that maximize social evaluation of\none's body elicit body image concerns (Cloudt, Lamarche, &\nHart et al., 1989; Van Raalte, Cunningham, Cornelius, &\nBrewer, 2004). In addition, situations in which body image\nconcerns are elicited (i.e., viewing media images of the thin\nideal, situations of heightened self-objectification) have been\nshown to have lingering effects (Hausenblas, Janelle,\nRecently, physiological measures have been incorporated\ninto body image research to gain an understanding of the\npsychobiology of body image (Anderson, Shapiro, Lundgren,\n& Gammage, 2015; Lamarche, Gammage, Kerr, Faulkner, &\n1University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\n3Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nLarkin Lamarche, Assistant Professor (part-time), Research Coordinator,\nHealth TAPESTRY, Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University,\n1280 Main Street West, McMaster Health Campus, 5th Floor, Hamilton,\nEmail: lamarche@mcmaster.ca\nPsychological and Cortisol Responses to\nand Recovery From Exposure to a Body\nImage Threat\nLarkin Lamarche1,2, Kimberley L.

The most commonly assessed in this recent literature\nis cortisol (a stress hormone thought to represent hypotha-\nlamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation; Sapolsky, 2003).\nGiven this recent interest in physiological variables in a\nbody image context, social self-preservation theory (SSPT;\nDickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004), in contrast to\nother theories of body image, may be particularly useful in\nthe examination of responses to social-evaluative body\nimage threats. SSPT suggests that when a social-evaluative\nthreat is present, negative self-conscious emotions and phys-\niological responses are elicited concurrently (Dickerson,\nGruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004). Shame and cortisol are par-\nticularly responsive to such threats, although other psycho-\nlogical (i.e., guilt) and physiological (heart rate,\nproinflammatory cytokines) outcomes have been examined\nwithin SSPT (Dickerson, Gable, Irwin, Aziz, & Kemeny,\nGenerally, research has supported the contentions of SSPT\nby examining psychobiological responses to the Trier Social\nStress Test, a performance-based social-evaluative task\n(Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993). Recently, SSPT\nhas been applied to a body image context (Bailey, Lamarche,\nMartin Ginis et al. (2012) provided the first empirical sup-\nport of a cortisol response to a social-evaluative body image\nthreat. In the first experiment, women thought they would be\nexercising in a high social-evaluative threatening setting (in\na public, mirrored exercise facility while wearing revealing\nexercise attire) or a low social-evaluative threatening setting\n(alone, in a private, non-mirrored room while wearing non-\nrevealing exercise attire). In their second experiment, partici-\npants were asked to go behind a screen into a changing area\nto try on exercise clothing and complete a questionnaire rat-\ning the exercise clothing (e.g., color, fabric). In the high\nsocial-evaluative condition, participants were led to believe\nthat after completing the questionnaire, a video camera\nwould record the participant in the clothing so that a panel of\njudges could evaluate how well the clothing fit at a later date.\nParticipants in the low social-evaluative condition were\ninstructed to change into the exercise clothing behind the\nscreen and complete the same questionnaire package; how-\never, they were told that no one would see them. Across both\nexperiments the results indicated that cortisol levels were\nhigher post-manipulation for those in the high versus low\nsocial-evaluative condition.\nAlthough these authors were the first to provide evidence\nof a cortisol response to a social-evaluative body image\nthreat, they noted significant limitations regarding their\nthreat. Given their ethics board guidelines, they were unable\nto actually expose participants to the social-evaluative body\nimage threat. They predicted that cortisol responses would\nhave been greater had participants actually faced the threat\nand emphasized that \"actual threat exposure in an ethical and\necologically valid manner is necessary to test this hypothe-\n(2015) examined psychological and heart rate responses to\nan imagined social-evaluative body image threat. Findings\nshowed that the highest levels of body shame and social phy-\nsique anxiety were reported in the social-evaluative com-\npared with the non-social-evaluative body image condition.\nHowever, no differences in heart rate were found between\ngroups. In agreement with Martin Ginis et al. (2012), it was\nnoted that actual threat exposure may be necessary to capture\nmore robust physiological changes under social-evaluative\nbody image threat, and fully understand the psychobiology\nof body image.\nThe implications of the potential differences in responses\nto anticipating and actually facing a threat are important. For\nexample, responses to the mere anticipation of a threatening\nsituation particularly negative may cause people to avoid\nengaging in specific body-related situations (e.g., swimming,\nhaving sex, exercising); however, if such responses can be\novercome, some people may feel that the situation was not as\nbad (or threatening) as originally believed (Lamarche et al.,\nOne recent study developed a novel weight stigma para-\ndigm in which participants were actually exposed to an inter-\npersonal rejection based on weight stigma (Himmelstein,\nBelsky, & Tomiyama, 2015). Specifically, the authors manip-\nulated weight stigma to examine its impact on cortisol reac-\ntivity. In addition, body mass index (BMI) and self-perceived\nweight were examined as potential moderators of the rela-\ntionship between stigma and cortisol reactivity. These\nauthors found that the weight stigma situation elicited\nchanges in cortisol, and that those who perceived themselves\nas \"heavy\" (regardless of their actual BMI) exhibited higher\ncortisol in response to the weight stigma situation compared\nwith those who perceived themselves as average weight.\nAlthough growing evidence suggests that cortisol may be\nelicited under body-related threats, the majority of the body\nimage literature has examined only immediate responses to\nsuch threats and still ignores what occurs after the body\nimage threat is removed. Recent evidence examining\nresponses to a social-evaluative non-body image threat sug-\ngests that failing to examine a recovery phase may lead to\nerroneous conclusions regarding the distress of the individ-\nual (Juster, Perna, Marin, Sindi, & Lupien, 2012).\nFurthermore, there is some, albeit limited, evidence of the\nlingering negative effects of body-related situations\nmore complete picture of the response-recovery profile to a\nbody image threat, the current study measured outcomes\nimmediately following the threat and after a rest period in\nwhich the threat was no longer present.\nThe threat used in the present study was a three-site skin-\nfold assessment while wearing a two-piece bathing suit. This\nthreat was selected for several theoretical and methodological\nLamarche et al. 3\nreasons. First, this threat is based on characteristics under\nwhich perceptions of, and responses to, social-evaluative\nthreatening situations are most likely to occur as supported by\nSSPT (Rohleder, Beilen, Chen, Wolf, & Kirschbaum, 2007).\nSpecifically, it involves a social-evaluative element (i.e.,\nevaluates body composition by a trained technician and assis-\ntant), involves a domain of importance (i.e., body fat is an\nimportant characteristic associated with the North American\nthin ideal), and the potential loss of social acceptance from a\nnegative evaluation (i.e., a poor body composition may serve\nas a reminder that one does not meet the thin ideal standard).\nSecond, a qualitative study framed within SSPT identified\nbeing seen in a bathing suit by others as the most uncomfort-\nable situation (Lamarche et al., 2012)--being in a bathing suit\nor increasing the level of body exposure has been an impor-\ntant aspect of manipulations designed to elicit body image\nconcerns (Carron & Prapavessis, 1997; Gammage et al.,\nanticipation of this specific threat has been shown to elicit\nsocial physique anxiety and body shame responses (Cloudt\nactually exposing an individual to this threat would also elicit\na cortisol response, similar to responses to a weight stigma\nsituation (Himmelstein et al., 2015). Fourth, a skinfold assess-\nment was originally used to validate a questionnaire measur-\ning social physique anxiety (Hart et al., 1989). Fifth, a body\ncomposition assessment through skinfold measurements is\ncommonly used in clinical and research settings, making it\nacceptable to the research ethics boards. Finally, as reported\nby Lamarche et al. (2014), self-rating of perceived evaluative\nthreat in anticipation of this exact situation was significantly\nhigher than a control group in a similar sample of women\ncompared with the present study.\nSpecifically, the purpose of the current study was to\nexamine psychobiological responses to, and recovery from,\nactually undergoing (i.e., facing) a body image threat in\nwomen. Based on the findings of Gammage et al. (2004) and\nwith respect to cortisol changes from a body image threat, it\nwas hypothesized that the body image threat would elicit\nincreased social physique anxiety and cortisol and that these\nvariables would not return to baseline levels after the threat\nwas removed (i.e., levels would remain significantly higher\nthan baseline levels). The hypothesis with respect to the\nrecovery of variables is based on Quinn et al.'s (2006) find-\ning of the lingering effects of body-related thoughts after\nbeing exposed to a situation designed to heighten body image\nconcerns. It was also hypothesized that participants in the\ncontrol condition would report no differences in body image\nvariables or cortisol levels across their testing visit.\nMethod\nParticipants\nUpon institutional ethics clearance, participants were\nrecruited through posters placed around a university campus\nand announcements made in undergraduate classes. To dis-\nguise the true purpose of the study, the recruitment materials\nindicated the study was examining the relationship between\nself-perceptions, anthropometric measurements, and corti-\nsol. Furthermore, the reason given to participants regarding\nthe required clothing for the research session (described\nbelow) was that it was standard clothing used in the labora-\ntory for anthropometric tests. The estimated required sample\nlarge effects of social-evaluative body image threats on cor-\ndata screening (detailed below), the final sample consisted of\n64 healthy, young adult women attending university (see\nTable 1 for sample characteristics). It should be noted that all\nbut one participant were Caucasian. Varsity athletes, smok-\ners, individuals with a history of a clinical eating disorder, or\nthose on medications that influence cortisol secretion (e.g.,\ncorticosteroids) were excluded from participation.\nParticipants were also excluded if they ate, drank, or partici-\npated in physical activity within 1 hr prior to testing.\nMeasures\nParticipants completed demographic information (age, fre-\nquency of exercise) and answered a series of questions ensur-\ning that they had complied with study requirements with\nrespect to food, drink, and physical activity participation.\nNext, a measure of state social physique anxiety was admin-\nistered (see description below).\nSocial physique anxiety. The nine-item State Social Physique\nAnxiety Scale (SPAS; Kruisselbrink, Dodge, Swanburg, &\nMacLeod, 2004) assessed anxiety associated with others'\nevaluations of one's body. The items were measured on a\n5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all characteristic of me)\nto 5 (extremely characteristic of me). Participants were\ninstructed to respond to each item by indicating how they felt\nat that moment. A sample item is \"Unattractive features of\nmy physique/figure make me nervous in this setting.\" This\nTable 1.

Final sample = 64 participants. BMI = body mass index; frequency of\nexercise = times per week.\n4 SAGE Open\nquestionnaire has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and\nvalidity in young adult women in past research (Kruissel-\nbrink et al., 2004; Martin Ginis, Murru, Conlin, & Strong,\n2011). Internal consistency for the present study was deemed\nadequate for each time point (s range = .88-.93).\nSalivary cortisol.Measuring cortisol in saliva is a reliable,\nstress-free, non-invasive technique that does not require a\ntrained technician (Vinning, McGinley, Maksvytis, & Ho,\n1983). Several studies have used salivary cortisol in their\nprotocols (e.g., Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Martin Ginis\nusing salivettes specific for cortisol measurement (Sarstedt,\nGermany). Participants placed the dental cotton piece in their\nmouths and left it there for 1 min, then placed the cotton back\ninto the test tube and sealed it. Samples were centrifuged\nimmediately and then placed in a -80 \u00b0C freezer until being\nassayed. Salivary cortisol concentration was measured in\nduplicate by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sali-\nmetrics, 2010). The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients\nof variability were calculated and deemed acceptable (<15%\nand <10%, respectively).\nProcedures\nInterested participants contacted the principal investigator\nand a mutually convenient time for participation was set.\nAfter confirming a test session, participants were randomly\nassigned to either the control or threat group by drawing a\nnumber out of a hat. Participants assigned to the control\ngroup were asked to bring shorts and a t-shirt to their visit,\nwhereas participants in the threat group were asked to bring\na two-piece bathing suit. Participants in both groups were\ntold that this clothing was standard laboratory attire to allow\nfor the accuracy of anthropometric measures, which would\nbe completed during the testing session. Upon arrival at the\nlaboratory, participants provided informed consent and com-\npleted demographic information. Next, participants com-\npleted a measure of state social physique anxiety. This time\nserved as a baseline rest period prior to cortisol collection.\nParticipants then provided a baseline saliva sample.\nNext, participants completed the threat/control condition,\ndepending on their group assignment. Participants in the\ncontrol condition were asked to sit quietly alone for 15 min.\nQuiet rest served as a control condition to be consistent with\npast research measuring cortisol responses to a social-evalu-\native threat in the non-body image literature (Kirschbaum\nfaced the social-evaluative body image threat (see descrip-\ntion below). Participants were then asked to sit while they\ncompleted the same measure of state social physique anxiety\nand provided another saliva sample (response measures).\nThe response saliva sample was completed approximately 25\nmin after the onset of the threat/quiet rest, capturing the peak\ncortisol response (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Participants\nin the threat group then changed back into their street clothes.\nAfter completing their condition (i.e., quiet rest or threat),\nparticipants sat quietly for 15 more minutes (i.e., threat was\nno longer present), and then completed the same measure of\nstate social physique anxiety followed by a final saliva sam-\nple (recovery measures). The recovery saliva sample was\ncompleted approximately 50 min following the onset of the\nthreat/quiet rest (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Upon com-\npletion of all questionnaires and saliva samples, objective\nmeasures of height, weight, and body composition were\ntaken for participants in the control group using the same\nstandard protocol described below, except that participants\nwore shorts and a t-shirt for the body composition assess-\nment and only the technician was present. Participants were\ndebriefed as to the true purpose of the study and given\nUS$10.00 as compensation for their time. Given the circa-\ndian rhythm of cortisol, all data collection took place at the\nSocial-evaluative body image threat.\nA body composition\nassessment completed while participants wore a two-piece\nbathing suit was selected as the social-evaluative body image\nthreat. Specifically, a standard three-site (triceps, iliac crest,\nthigh) skinfold measurement was performed to assess per-\ncent body fat (Jackson, Pollack, & Ward, 1980). The same\ntrained technician read measurements aloud to the same\nresearch assistant, who verbally repeated each value, then\nrecorded it, thus allowing participants' body composition to\nbe evaluated by the researchers. The presence of the assistant\nwho recorded the values ensured there was an evaluative\naudience, aside from the technician, increasing the likeli-\nhood that a threat would be induced. This body image threat\nmaximized body exposure and evaluation of the body, but\nwas also acceptable to the research ethics board as these\nanthropometric measures are typically taken for research,\nclinical, athletic performance assessment, and educational\npurposes. Furthermore, instructions for participants about\nclothing (particularly the bathing suit) were also considered\nrealistic, as some body composition testing done at the uni-\nversity requires participants to bring a bathing suit with\nthem.\nResults\nNine participants (all randomized into the threat group) who\nconfirmed their eligibility, scheduled a testing appointment\nand had knowledge of the clothing needed for participation,\ndid not attend their appointment. Of the 71 participants who\ncompleted the study, five participants were removed for not\ncomplying with study requirements or for feeling unwell.\nIndependent t tests showed no significant differences\nbetween participants removed and the final sample on key\nvariables (all ps > .05). Data for cortisol were positively\nLamarche et al. 5\nskewed so values were log-transformed for all analyses, sim-\nilar to previous studies investigating cortisol responses to\nsocial-evaluative body image threats (Cloudt et al., 2014;\ndata, non-transformed data are provided for ease of interpre-\ntation. Two participants were removed as outliers due to\nimplausible cortisol levels (>82.77 nmol/L; Salimetrics,\nSome research has demonstrated a relationship between\nmeasures of body composition and social physique anxiety\n(Hart et al., 1989), thus bivariate correlations were conducted\nto examine BMI, weight, and percent body fat as potential\ncovariates for analyses. No relationship was found (p > .05).\nTo investigate baseline group differences on demographic\nvariables and state social physique anxiety and cortisol at\nbaseline, a series of t tests were conducted. The results indi-\ncated no significant between-group differences on demo-\ngraphic variables or baseline variables (all ps > .05).\nRelationships between social physique anxiety and cortisol\nat all three time points were also examined. Results indicated\na significant positive relationship between state social phy-\nsique anxiety and cortisol at the response time point (r = .25,\np < .05) and between cortisol at response and state social\nphysique anxiety at the recovery time point (r = .28, p < .05).\nState Social Physique Anxiety\nTo compare the responses with, and recovery from, a social-\nevaluative body image threat, a 2 (group: control, threat) \u00d7 3\n(time: baseline, response, recovery) repeated-measures\nANOVA was conducted for social physique anxiety. There\nwas a significant group-by-time interaction, F(2, 61) = 4.36,\np\n2 = .13. To examine the nature of the time effects\nwithin each group, three sets of paired t tests were conducted\n(baseline vs. response, response vs. recovery, baseline vs.\nrecovery). A Bonferroni correction factor was applied for\nfollow-up analyses such that a p value < .017 would be\ndeemed significant. No differences were found within the\ncontrol group. Comparisons made within the threat group\nshowed that the level of social physique anxiety at response\nwas significantly higher than both baseline, t(30) = -3.64,\nof social physique anxiety were not different between base-\np\np\nTable 2 for means and standard deviations for social physique\nanxiety.\nCortisol\nTo compare the cortisol response with, and recovery from, a\nsocial-evaluative body image threat, a 2 (group: control,\nthreat) \u00d7 3 (time: baseline, response, recovery) repeated-mea-\nsuresANOVAwas conducted with log-transformed cortisol as\nthe dependent variable.

There was no significant change in\ngroup. In the threat group, comparisons showed that there was\na significant increase in cortisol from baseline to response\n1992). No differences were found in cortisol levels between\nThere were no significant main effects for time, F(2, 108) = .69,\np\np\nSee Table 2 for means and standard deviations for cortisol.1\nIn addition, area under the curve with respect to increase\n(AUCi) was also calculated for each group (Pruessner,\nKirschbaum, Meinlschmid, & Hellhammer, 2003). AUCi\nassesses baseline-corrected cortisol responses and accounts\nfor the difference between single measurements from each\nother or the change over time (Pruessner et al., 2003). It\nshould be noted that a negative value represents an index of\ndecrease rather than an area under the curve. To examine\nwhether a social-evaluative body image threat elicited a\ncortisol response, a one-way ANOVA was conducted using\nTable 2.

Significant increases in social phy-\nsique anxiety scores were found in the threat group, with\nscores highest immediately following the body composition\nassessment. By contrast, the control group showed no changes\nin social physique anxiety. Our findings also showed a sig-\nnificant group-by-time interaction for cortisol and a signifi-\ncant group difference in AUCi indicating that the threat\nelicited a cortisol response. These findings are consistent with\nour hypotheses that a social-evaluative body image threat\nwould lead to increased social physique anxiety and cortisol.\nContrary to our hypotheses, social physique anxiety and cor-\ntisol returned to baseline levels after the threat was removed;\nno significant differences were found between recovery and\nbaseline levels of social physique anxiety and cortisol.\nImplications for Research\nArguably the most significant implication of the present\nstudy is support for examining not only the responses to\nsocial-evaluative body image threats, but also the recovery\nfrom such threats to provide a more complete picture of the\npsychobiology of body image experiences. Furthermore, it\nshould be highlighted that a skinfold assessment elicited a\npsychobiological response consistent with SSPT. The find-\nings from the present study complement those of Himmelstein\net al. (2015) from which future research questions can build\nand test tenets of SSPT. In agreement with Martin Ginis et al.\n(2012), we highlight the challenges of designing an ethical\nthreat that can be tested in a laboratory setting. Despite the\nfact that some information regarding the study was required\nto be included in the consent material, we still found signifi-\ncant differences in psychobiological outcomes.\nContributions to Body Image Literature\nThe present findings contribute to the body image literature\nin two significant ways. First, they complement those of\nMartin Ginis et al. (2012) who found that women who antici-\npated a body image threat had higher cortisol levels post-\nmanipulation than women in a non-social-evaluative threat\ncondition. Our findings, in agreement with Himmelstein\net al. (2015), show that actual exposure to a threat resulted in\nsmall but significant increases in cortisol.\nMore important, to our knowledge, the present study is\nthe first to measure psychobiological outcomes after the\nsocial-evaluative threat is removed, highlighting the second\ncontribution to the body image literature. Findings show\nthat, when faced with a social-evaluative body image threat,\nwomen report an immediate increase in social physique anx-\niety and have higher cortisol, but perhaps more important,\nsocial physique anxiety and cortisol return to baseline levels\nwhen the threat is no longer present. This is an important and\nencouraging finding that extends what we currently know\nabout situations that elicit body image concerns. For exam-\nple, the negative effects of viewing media images of the thin\nideal, a non-social-evaluative body image threat, have been\nfound to persist 1 to 2 hr after viewing (Hausenblas et al.,\n2003). In addition, unlike a self-objectifying situation after\nwhich body-related thoughts persist (Quinn et al., 2006),\nquick recovery from a social-evaluative body image threat as\nshown in the present study is possible. Although the reasons\nfor these differences can only be speculated, this finding\ncould be considered positive for two reasons. First, outcomes\nreturning to baseline levels after 15 min from a laboratory-\nbased threat may indicate that women are capable of recover-\ning from a similar acute threat in real life, although\npsychobiological responses to a real life body image threat\nhave yet to be examined. Second, quick, efficient psychobio-\nlogical responses are adaptive (Gruenewald, Dickerson, &\nKemeny, 2007). Recent evidence examining responses to a\nsocial-evaluative non-body image threat suggests that failing\nto examine a recovery phase may lead to erroneous conclu-\nsions regarding the distress of the individual (Juster et al.,\n2012). In the present study, the quick reactivity and recovery\nof social physique anxiety and cortisol may have acted as a\nkey signaling emotion to make the participant aware that a\nsocial-evaluative threat existed and then passed. However,\ncaution should be taken in drawing any conclusion about the\ntemporal quality of this type of response. More research is\nneeded examining what occurs when the threat is removed.\nIn addition, potential moderators and mediators of responses\nand recovery need to be explored. For example, Himmelstein\net al. (2015) found that perceived weight (regardless of their\nactual BMI) was a moderator of cortisol responses to the\nweight stigma situation. Findings suggest that perceptions\n(and not objective variables) have potential moderating\neffects. Variables such as body image coping or body image\ninvestment may be important variables to examine, particu-\nlarly with respect to efficient recovery.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations to this study should be noted. Results can\nonly generalize to healthy, young Caucasian adult women.\nFurthermore, all but two participants fell within \"normal/rec-\nommended\" ranges for BMI and percent body fat. As some\nexamples, results in men or individuals who have a clinical\neating disorder may display different responses as they have\nLamarche et al. 7\ndifferent body image concerns. Second, it is important to\nnote that individuals volunteered for this study, and that all\nparticipants in the threat group went through with the body\ncomposition assessment indicating they were comfortable\nenough to have their percent body fat measured. This may\npresent the issue of demand characteristics within the sam-\nple. We can only speculate why those nine participants ran-\ndomized into the threat group did not show up to their testing\nappointment. However, it should be emphasized that even\nthough the sample was comfortable enough to complete a\nbody composition assessment, we still found a significant\nincrease in social physique anxiety and cortisol in response\nto the threat. Future research could minimize self-selection\nby withholding study details in recruitment materials\nalthough restrictions do apply based on ethical consider-\nations. Third, our group was relatively active. Research has\nprovided evidence that exercisers generally have a more\npositive body image than non-exercisers (Hausenblas &\nFallon, 2006), yet we were able to elicit a response including\nhigher social physique anxiety similar to findings reported\nby Gammage et al. (2004) in a similar sample.\nAlso, given that it is not possible to discern which of the\nfactors of the manipulation was associated with the increase\nin cortisol, future research could explore specific contextual\nfactors and their sole and additive effects on the psychobiol-\nogy of body image experiences. Finally, although timing of\nthe cortisol measurements in the present study was based on\nmeta-analytic evidence, it should be noted that this support\ncomes from studies examining the response to, and recovery\nfrom, a performance-based (and not body image-related)\nsocial-evaluative threat (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004); thus,\ntiming of the peak response and full recovery may not be the\nsame across all types of social-evaluative threats.\nAnother limitation that should be noted relates to the\ndesign of the control group. This challenge is illustrated by\nthe findings of a significant group-by-time interaction for\ncortisol and a significant group difference inAUCi. However,\nvisual inspection of the mean cortisol values at the response\ntime point shows that the control group had a higher cortisol\nlevel (although not significantly) than the threat group. We\nused a control group to represent a non-threatening condition\nwith respect to the body, similar to Himmelstein et al. (2015;\nrejection but not for weight-related reasons) and to past stud-\nies examining cortisol responses to a social-evaluative non-\nbody image threat (Kirschbaum et al., 1993; Nater et al.,\n2007); however, it was not matched on body image content.\nMartin Ginis et al. (2012) noted the difficulty in designing an\nequivalent control group when examining cortisol responses\nto body image threats. In their second experiment, these\nauthors had control participants believe they would try on\nexercise attire alone, in private. The control and experimen-\ntal conditions were matched with respect to content of the\nmanipulation (about the body), but differed on social evalua-\ntion (alone, in private vs. evaluated on fit of clothing by\nanother person). Objectification theory (Fredrickson &\nRoberts, 1997) may highlight the difficulty in designing a\nsuitable control group in studies comparing groups' varying\nlevel of social-evaluative threat in body image--any study\nabout body image may initiate self-objectification, leading to\nheightened self-conscious outcomes (i.e., body shame).\nResearch framed in objectification theory has found that\nwomen trying on a swimsuit in front of a mirror (with no one\nelse present) reported body shame (Fredrickson, Roberts,\nNoll, Quinn, & Twenge, 1998). Similarly, Martin Ginis et al.\n(2012) noted that trying on clothing may initiate the social\ncomparison process (which Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004,\nreported as one characteristic increasing social evaluation) to\nsocietal body image standards and, therefore, serve as a form\nof social evaluation itself leading to slight increases in corti-\nsol responses. In turn, this makes it more difficult to detect\ndifferences between the control and threat groups at the\nresponse time point. Although we acknowledge the design of\nour control group as a limitation, it should be noted that the\npresent study did find a significant increase in cortisol, even\nwith the control group knowing their anthropometric mea-\nsurements would be taken eventually while wearing shorts\nand a t-shirt. Nevertheless, this limitation highlights the chal-\nlenges in designing an equivalent body image control condi-\ntion void of social evaluation in a research topic with inherent\ntendencies for social comparison and/or self-objectification.\nConclusion\nThe present findings contribute to the body image literature\nby providing a more complete understanding of the psycho-\nbiological aspects of body image. The findings also highlight\nthe importance of measuring outcomes beyond the time point\nimmediately after the body image threat is removed to evalu-\nate any lingering effects on psychobiological outcomes.\nFurthermore, they emphasize the need to study both anticipa-\ntion of a body image threat and actually facing such threats;\nit is possible that negative responses that occur in anticipa-\ntion of these threats are actually decreased when actually\nexperiencing such threats (Lamarche et al., 2012; Mills et al.,\n"
