The\nrequirement for patient consent was waived\ndue to the retrospective nature of the study.\nSurgical procedure and\nperioperative assessment\nAll patients underwent preoperative exam-\nination of the entire heart and ascending\naorta using ultrasonic cardiography (UCG).\nThe AVR was performed according to the\nstandard surgical procedure used in our\ninstitution. The involved valve was replaced\nwith either a mechanical or biological valve\nprosthesis under the support of full cardio-\npulmonary bypass, leaving the non-dilated\nascending aorta untreated. The indication\nfor AVR was based on the current surgical\nguidelines but was ultimately at the sur-\ngeon's discretion.\nThe valve phenotype (BAV or TAV) was\ndetermined intraoperatively and confirmed\nby UCG and pathological examination. The\npattern of the valve and the ascending aorta\nwere assessed using UCG during the oper-\nation. The diameter of the proximal ascend-\ning aorta was obtained from the parasternal\nlong-axis view using two-dimensional mode,\nas this depicts the maximum aortic diameter\nperpendicular to the long axis of the aorta.\nAll aortic diameters were measured at end-\ndiastole using the leading edge-to-leading\nedge convention. When the AVR has been\ncompleted, transoesophageal echocardiog-\nraphy was used to evaluate the function\nof the valve prosthesis and the ascending\naorta. UCG was performed by two cardiac\nsurgeons and two cardiologists specializing\nin echocardiography. Postoperative compli-\ncations were documented.\nFollow up\nFollow-up information was obtained from\nannual outpatient reviews or telephone\nfollow up (which was offered to those\nunable to attend an outpatient review). All\npostoperative imaging data and echocardi-\nography reports obtained from our institu-\ntion or from hospitals with comparable\ntechniques and standards were analyzed.\nAdverse aortic events, defined as an enlarged\nascending aorta requiring medical treat-\nment, aortic dissection or aneurysm, and\nall causes of death were recorded. For all\nout-of-hospital deaths, sudden cardiac death\nwas confirmed or excluded. Aortic aneurysm\nwas defined as dilatation of the aorta to\ngreater than 1.5 times the normal size.\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables were expressed as\npercentages, and continuous variables\nwere expressed as the mean \u00c6 SD (range).\nAnalysis of freedom from events was\nperformed according to the methods of\nKaplan\u00adMeier, and significant differences\nwere analyzed using the log-rank test.\nA multivariable analysis (Cox regression)\nof the risk factors for total aortic events and\ndeath was performed. A number of variables\n(presence of BAV, baseline characteristics,\nascending aorta data, valve dysfunction,\nintraoperative variables, in-hospital out-\ncomes and the need for coronary artery\nintervention) were initially screened using a\nunivariate model and were considered for\nclinical relevance before being included in\nthe multivariate model. A P-value < 0.05\nwas considered to be statistically significant.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software version 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nA total of 613 patients were included in the\na TAV.\nBaseline characteristics\nBaseline patient characteristics are summar-\nized in Table 1.

In both\nthe BAV and the TAV group, severe stenosis\nof the aortic valve accounted for a higher\nproportion of those with stenosis compared\nwith the other subgroups. A combination of\nstenosis and regurgitation was seen in more\nthan half of the patients in both groups\n(Table 1).\nPerioperative data\nProcedural, intraoperative and in-hospital\noutcome data are presented in Table 2.\nThere were no significant differences in\ncardiopulmonary bypass time or operation\ntime between the two groups. Mechanical\nprostheses were used as replacement valves\nin the majority of patients.\nThere were no in-hospital deaths in either\ngroup. The major complication was post-\noperative bleeding requiring surgical inter-\nvention, which occurred in three patients in\nthe BAV group and 14 patients in the TAV\ngroup; however, this difference was not\nstatistically significant. Most of the patients\nhad a smooth, quick recovery, with a short\nand similar length of stay in the intensive\ncare unit. However, some patients (n < 10)\nremained in hospital for > 1 month due to\ninfection or delayed healing.\nFollow-up data\nFollow-up data were obtained in all\n613 patients. The distribution of the max-\nimum follow-up times is given in Figure 1.\nThe mean follow-up time was comparable\nin the two groups (5.6 \u00c6 2.2 years in the\ngroup).

Adverse aortic events and deaths\nwere mostly related to the cardiovascular\nsystem in both the BAV and the TAV group,\nwith the proportion of cardiac and non-\ncardiac causes being similar in both groups.\nOne patient in the BAV group underwent\nreplacement of the ascending aorta because\nof progression of aortic dissection, while two\npatients in the TAV group suffered an aortic\ndissection and underwent further surgery.\nOne patient in the BAV group experienced\nsudden death during UCG evaluation due to\nrupture of an aortic dissection.\nData concerning freedom from aortic\nevents and death are given in Figure 4.\nThere were no significant differences\nbetween the endpoint values for the BAV\nAll variables were screened using uni-\nvariate analysis. Cox regression analysis was\nperformed on four of these variables to\nidentify independent risk factors for aortic\nevents and death. Of these, preoperative\nmixed dysfunction of the valve and pre-\noperative diameter of the ascending aorta\nwere shown to be significant predictors of\nadverse aortic events and death (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study of 613 patients who had\nundergone isolated AVR surgery, post-\noperative dilatation of the ascending aorta\nwas compared in those with a BAV and\nthose with a TAV after a mean follow-up\nSince a link between BAVs and ascending\naortic aneurysms was first suggested by\nof patients with BAV disease, especially\nwhen combined with ascending aortic\naneurysm, has been the focus of numerous\nstudies.

However, it is controver-\nsial whether normal or mildly dilated\nascending aortas should be treated at the\ninitial time of AVR.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated pro-\ngressive enlargement of the aorta after AVR\nin patients with a BAV. Yasuda et al.8\nreported progressive dilatation of the aorta\nin BAV patients both with and without\nAVR; the results of this small study sug-\ngested that AVR could not prevent progres-\nsive aortic dilatation in BAV. Russo et al.18\nreported on 100 patients with a BAV\nor a TAV followed up after AVR for\nor Marfan's syndrome were excluded. At\nthe final time point, the mean diameter of\nthe ascending aorta in the BAV group\n(48.4 mm) was significantly larger than in\nthe TAV group (36.8 mm). They therefore\nrecommended prophylactic replacement of\neven a seemingly normal or mildly enlarged\nascending aorta during AVR in patients\nFigure 3.

Patients with mild aortic dilatation\ncomparable to those with non-dilated aortas\n(< 40 mm); therefore, these authors did not\nsee the need for aortic replacement for\nsmaller diameters.9\nIn the present study, adult patients with\na BAV or a TAV with an ascending aorta\nwith a normal or relatively normal diameter\nshowed a significant increase in aortic diam-\neter after AVR; however, no significant\ndifference was found between the two\ngroups. This suggests that a BAV may not\nbe a risk factor for dilatation of the ascend-\ning aorta post-AVR. Additionally, despite\nthe presence of dilatation, the diameter of\nthe ascending aorta did not increase to the\npoint of aneurysm and did not require\nfurther surgical intervention. Improved ven-\ntricular function and ejection fraction were\nseen in both groups after surgery.\nThat a BAV is not a risk factor for\ndilatation of the ascending aorta post-AVR\nwas supported by multivariable Cox regres-\nsion analysis of the risk factors for total\naortic events and death in the present study.\nIn most published articles, the presence or\nseverity of aortic valve dysfunction has been\nconsidered to be a risk factor for aortic\ndilatation or even dissection.19\u00ad21 In the\npresent study, the presence of a mixed\naortic valve lesion was a risk factor for\ndilatation of the remaining ascending aorta\n(P \u00bc 0.045). However, the presence of a BAV\nalone did not have a significant influence.\nThis finding may be explained by the distri-\nbution of the UCG results, which differs a\nlittle from the results of other researchers\nwho reported valve stenosis in the majority of\npatients due to valve morphology.22,23 The\nother risk factor identified in the present\nstudy was the preoperative diameter of the\nascending aorta (P < 0.001). This result is in\naccordance with Laplace's Law, which states\nthat for a given pressure the wall tension in a\nvessel is proportional to the radius, and is\nsupported by other studies.9,24\nAlthough a significantly faster aortic\ndilatation rate has been reported in patients\nwith a BAV compared with patients with a\nTAV,25 in the present study there was no\nsignificant difference in aortic dilatation\nbetween the BAV and TAV groups during\nthe follow-up period. In addition, the pre-\nsence of a BAV was not a significant\npredictor of later aortic events or death.\nThis observation is consistent with the\nresults of a study in which cross-sectional\nanalysis of echocardiographic data was per-\nformed in 595 patients undergoing isolated\nAVR.26 In a further longitudinal follow-up\nTable 4. Risk factors for complex aortic events and death calculated using Cox\nregression in patients with either a bicuspid or a tricuspid aortic valve who had\nundergone aortic valve replacement.\nVariable\nHazard\nratio\nintervals\nStatistical\nsignificance\nNS, no statistically significant between-group differences (P ! 0.05) using 2-test and\nStudent's t-test for categorical and non-categorical data, respectively.\nstudy aimed at evaluating aortic expansion\nrates, no difference between the BAV and\nTAV groups was reported.27\nIn the present study, coronary artery\nintervention did not significantly increase\nthe risk of total aortic events or death. This\nfinding is in agreement with the results of\nGirdauskas et al.,28 who studied a total of\n325 consecutive patients with aortic valve\nstenosis and concomitant ascending aortic\nunderwent isolated AVR; they found that\nmildly to moderately dilated ascending\naortas in patients with BAV or TAV stenosis\nbehaved similarly during 15 years of follow-\nup. As surgical techniques develop and\nimprove, the incidence of such adverse\naortic events should decrease.\nThe present study was a retrospective\nanalysis, with all the known limitations of\nthis type of study design. In addition, a\nlimitation of the present study was that BAV\nsubtypes were not identified, as information\nconcerning subtypes or the echocardio-\ngraphic parameters necessary for identifica-\ntion were not consistently available.\nA further limitation was that the size of\nthe ascending aorta during the initial aortic\nvalve operation was only assessed by UCG,\nwhich is not as precise as computed tomog-\nraphy, magnetic resonance imaging or other\nimaging modalities; it has been reported that\nthe diameter of the ascending aorta is\nunderestimated by UCG.29,30 UCG is still\na well-proven modality for accurately mea-\nsuring the size of the ascending aorta during\nroutine outpatient examinations without the\naccompanying radiation hazards of other\nmethods, and it is also acceptable in assess-\nment of the ascending aorta during follow-\nup.31 However, we believe a more accurate\nmethod of measurement should be used in\nfurther studies.\nIn conclusion, the present study demon-\nstrated that in adult patients with a BAV or\na TAV with an initially non-dilated ascend-\ning aorta (< 45 mm), the remaining aorta\nexpanded after AVR but did not require\nadditional intervention. The presence of a\nBAV did not significantly contribute to\nthe extent of dilatation of the ascending\naorta postoperatively. However, the pre-\noperative diameter of the ascending aorta\nwas a significant predictor of adverse aortic\nevents and death.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
