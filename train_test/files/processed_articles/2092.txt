Investigations of adolescents have focused\nprimarily on substance use among students, and assess-\nments for substance-related disorders are not included\nin school-based surveys; when researchers have exam-\nined substance-related disorders, data are frequently lim-\nited to alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine, resulting in a lack\nof data on other drug use disorders.15-19 In addition, sample\nsizes of studies are often inadequate for examining young\nAsians, Native Americans, and groups of multiple race/\nethnicity. The 2000 Census was the first US Census to\ninclude the classification of multiple race/ethnicity,12 and\ndata about substance-related disorders for this group are\nlacking. Results about \"substance use\" also are limited\nfor discerning important differences in substance use prob-\nlems across racial/ethnic groups. An improved measure\nof substance use problems, such as that provided by the\nDSM-IV,20 is needed to better inform research, interven-\ntion, and health policy making.\nFurthermore, although investigators have reported ra-\ncial/ethnic differences in substance use, findings of racial/\nethnic differences in problems related to various sub-\nstances are inconsistent and sometimes difficult to\ninterpret.15 These discrepancies relate to various defini-\ntions of substance use and at-risk groups (the denomi-\nnators) used.15 Some investigations have examined sub-\nstance use problems in a total sample, while others have\ncompared them among subgroups of substance users.\nThese variations in study designs complicate efforts to\ncompare substance use problems among racial/ethnic\ngroups and across substance classes.

The NSDUH is a large on-\ngoing survey, serving as the primary source for national\nestimates of substance use and substance-related disor-\nders for the noninstitutionalized US population.10 The se-\nlected years included designs that allowed the use of\npooled data to examine alcohol and 9 drug use disor-\nders across racial/ethnic groups and to compare the con-\nditional probability of substance-related disorders among\nadolescent substance users. Multiple years of substance-\nrelated disorder data assessed by the same instrument help\nidentify the extent of overlooked substance-related dis-\norders (prescription drug use disorders) for understud-\nied groups (ie, Asian, Native American, and multiple race/\nethnicity). To address the limitation of studies with\ncomplicated comparisons of racial/ethnic differences ow-\ning to various denominators or definitions of substance\nuse, we focus on past-year substance use and substance-\nrelated disorders, as they are better indicators of recent\nor active substance use and treatment needs than life-\ntime measures.\nTo better inform etiological efforts, we expand on stud-\nies of substance use by examining the frequency of each\nsubstance used and conditional probabilities of substance-\nrelated disorders to characterize use patterns and iden-\ntify subsets of adolescent users showing elevated odds\nof having the disorder. The conditional prevalence of sub-\nstance-relateddisordersconsiderssubstance-specificvaria-\ntions in use by restricting the denominator for each sub-\nstance-related disorder to adolescent users of the\ncorresponding substance, thereby allowing compari-\nsons across substances. To mitigate for the confounding\neffects on associations between race/ethnicity and sub-\nstance use status, included as control variables were ado-\nlescents' age, sex, family income, population density of\nresidence (adjusting for potential effects associated with\ncommunity economic characteristics, drug-using peers,\nand availability of substances), and self-rated health (ad-\njusting for potential effects associated with adolescents'\nsubstance use and health status), as well as the survey\nThe following 3 main questions are addressed: (1) Are\nthere racial/ethnic differences in the 1-year prevalence\nof substance-related disorders? (2) Are there racial/\nethnic differences in the 1-year conditional prevalence\nof substance-related disorders among past-year adoles-\ncent users of each corresponding substance class? (3) To\nwhat extent is racial/ethnic status associated with each\nsubstance-related disorder among adolescent substance\nusers after controlling for potentially confounding ef-\nfects of adolescents' age, sex, family income, population\ndensity of residence, self-rated health, and survey year?\nMETHODS\nThis study was approved by the Duke University Institutional\nReview Board, Durham, North Carolina. Data were from the\nvey designed to provide ongoing national estimates of sub-\nstance use and substance-related disorders in the United\nStates.31,32 The target population includes residents of house-\nholds from the 50 states (including shelters, rooming houses,\nand group homes) and civilians residing on military bases.

All study procedures and protections are carefully ex-\nplained. For adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the field inter-\nviewer first seeks verbal consent from their parents or guardians.\nOnce parental permission is granted, field interviewers then ap-\nproach the adolescents and obtain their agreement to partici-\npate in the study. Parents are asked to leave the interview set-\nting to ensure the confidentiality of their children's responses.\nThe interview uses computer-assisted interviewing to in-\ncrease the likelihood of valid respondent reports of substance\nuse behaviors.31,32 Sociodemographic questions are adminis-\ntered by interviewers using computer-assisted personal inter-\nviewing. Other questions of a sensitive nature (substance use,\nsubstance-related disorders, and health) are administered using\naudio computer\u00adassisted self-interviewing, which provides re-\nspondents with a highly confidential means of responding to\nquestions to increase honest reporting of sensitive behaviors.\nRespondents read questions on the computer screen, or ques-\ntions are read to them through headphones, and they enter re-\nsponses directly into a computer provided by the interviewer.\naged 12 years or older were interviewed annually (weighted in-\nterviewing response rates for adolescents aged 12-17 years,\nto allow the detection of differences in substance-related dis-\norders among racial/ethnic groups.\nSubstance Use\nThe survey asked each respondent about his or her use of al-\ncohol and 9 drug classes (inhalant use and illicit use of mari-\njuana or hashish, cocaine or crack, hallucinogens, or heroin,\nas well as nonmedical use of prescription analgesic opioids,\nstimulants or amphetamines, sedatives, or tranquilizers). Non-\nmedical use was defined as the use without a prescription or\nfor the experience or feeling the drugs caused; the use of over-\nthe-counter drugs and legitimate use of prescription drugs were\nexcluded.22,31,32 Alcohol and drug classes were assessed by dis-\ncrete questions in 10 different sections. Each included a de-\ntailed description of the substance class and a list of sub-\nstances belonging to the class. For nonmedical use, respondents\nwere provided with pill cards showing color pictures of tablets\nfor analgesic opioids, stimulants, sedatives, or tranquilizers (the\ncomputer screen prompts the respondent to obtain pill cards\nfrom the interviewer). To determine the extent of co-use of\nalcohol and drugs, users of both alcohol and a drug were\ncategorized.\nDSM-IV Substance-Related Disorders\n(Abuse and Dependence)\nRespondents who reported alcohol or drug use in the past year\nwere asked a set of structured substance-specific questions de-\nsigned to operationalize DSM-IV criteria for abuse (role inter-\nference, hazardous use, problems with the law, and relation-\nship problems) and dependence (tolerance, withdrawal, taking\nlarger amounts or taking them for longer periods, inability to\ncut down, time spent using the substance, giving up activities,\nand continued use despite problems) in the past year.20,31,32 De-\npendence on a given substance class included users who met\nat least 3 dependence criteria for that class in the past year. Abuse\napplied to users who met at least 1 abuse criterion but did not\nmeet criteria for dependence on that substance class; abuse and\ndependence were mutually exclusive.20,31,32 Assessments were\nadopted from questions used in the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey; as part of an ongoing process to improve the survey, di-\nagnostic questions were cognitively tested to determine how\nwell they were understood by respondents, were evaluated by\nexperts to determine how well the questions captured the\nDSM-IV criteria, and were modified for DSM-IV criteria.34 The\nsubstance-related disorder questions were implemented and as-\nsessed using the computer-assisted self-interviewing method.\nSociodemographics\nExamined were adolescents' age, sex, family income, popula-\ntion density of residence, self-rated health, and self-reported\nAmerican, 4.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.7% multiple race/\nethnicity, and 0.6% Native American [American Indian or Alaska\nsus data and the June 2003 Core-Based Statistical Area classi-\nfications and was categorized as large metropolitan (1 mil-\nlion population), small metropolitan (1 million population),\nor nonmetropolitan (not in a Core-Based Statistical Area). Ow-\ning to the nature of a national sample, population density of\nresidence (a proxy for community location) was included as a\ncontrol variable. Self-rated health (fair or poor vs excellent, very\ngood, or good) was assessed using a widely supported mea-\nsure of general health (\"Would you say your health, in gen-\neral, is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\").28-30\nThe distributions of race/ethnicity by survey year and racial/\nethnic differences in sociodemographics were determined by\n2 test. The prevalence rates of substance use and substance-\nrelated disorders by race/ethnicity were determined. The con-\nditional prevalence rates of substance-related disorders among\nadolescent users of each substance class were compared by race/\nethnicity. To evaluate conditional rates of substance-related dis-\norders among substance users, the frequency of substance use\namong past-year users was calculated. Logistic regression analy-\nses estimated associations between race/ethnicity and each sub-\nstance-related disorder among adolescent users of that sub-\nstance.

The findings should prove useful to con-\ncerned citizens, health professionals, researchers, and\nhealth policy experts. First, past-year alcohol or drug use\nreported having a substance-related disorder, with Na-\ntive Americans showing the highest prevalence of use and\ndisorders. Second, analgesic opioids have replaced in-\nhalants as the second most commonly used drug (fol-\nlowing marijuana), and analgesic opioid use disorders\ncomprise the second most prevalent illicit drug use dis-\norder. Third, close to one-fourth of adolescent alcohol\nor drug users met DSM-IV criteria for a substance-\nrelated disorder, and users of marijuana, heroin, co-\ncaine, or sedatives showed an elevated rate of abuse or\ndependence on these drugs. Fourth, adolescents used\nmarijuana more frequently than alcohol or other drugs.\nFifth, adolescents of Native American, white, Hispanic,\nand multiple race/ethnicity are disproportionately af-\nfected by substance-related disorders.\nAlcohol Marijuana Inhalant Cocaine Hallucinogen Heroin Analgesic\nOpioid\nStimulant Sedative Tranquilizer\nSubstance Use\nNo. of Days, Mean\nFigure 3.

In addition to sup-\nporting a high prevalence of substance use among those\nof Native Americans, white, and Hispanic race/\nethnicity,17,18,37 adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity were\nfound to have the second highest prevalence of alcohol\nuse (following those of white race/ethnicity) and any drug\nuse (following Native Americans). Close to one-tenth of\nadolescents of multiple race/ethnicity self-reported hav-\ning a substance-related disorder, and one-fourth of sub-\nstance-using adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity ex-\nhibited a substance-related disorder. These estimates were\nas high as those for adolescents of Native American, white,\nand Hispanic race/ethnicity. These 4 groups are dispro-\nportionately affected by symptoms of substance-related\ndisorders.\nWhen distinguishing abuse from dependence,36 drug-\nusing adolescents of multiple race/ethnicity exhibited a\nhigher prevalence of dependence than abuse, suggest-\ning that substance use problems could be a unique chal-\nlenge for research and intervention as this population\ngrows.11,12 While substance use is influenced by mul-\ntiple peer, individual (depression and delinquency), fam-\nily (poor parenting), school (location), and community\n(neighborhood deterioration) domains,39-42 research also\nhas identified cultural-specific risk (greater accultura-\ntion) and protective correlates (cultural pride and ethnic/\nracial identity) for substance use, suggesting that cultural-\nspecific issues should be addressed for interventions to\nyet to be investigated for adolescents of multiple race/\nethnicity. About 2% of the US population are of mul-\ntiple race/ethnicity, which includes 3 subgroups of simi-\nlar size (white and African American, white and Native\nAmerican, and white and Asian or Pacific Islander) and\na small subgroup self-identifying themselves as more than\n3 races/ethnicities.46 Heterogeneous cultural back-\ngrounds of individuals of multiple race/ethnicity empha-\nsize the need for multidisciplinary approaches to disen-\ntangle cultural related factors that can guide prevention\nAnother concern is the high rate of substance-related dis-\norders among Native Americans. Consistent with ear-\nprevalence of substance-related use (47.5%). Native\nAmericans also demonstrated the highest rate of sub-\nstance-related disorder (15.0%); among past-year sub-\nstance-using Native Americans, 31.5% met criteria for a\nsubstance-related disorder. In a sample of 651 indig-\nenous adolescents from a single culture in the northern\nUnited States and Canada aged 13 to 15 years, Whit-\nbeck et al49 found that 12.7% self-reported having a past-\nyear alcohol use disorder, and 15.4% had a past-year mari-\njuana use disorder. However, there is a scarcity of research\non young Native Americans who obtain addiction treat-\nment.50 Given that this population is generally younger\n(39% are 20 years) and poorer than other ethnic/\nracial groups,51 young Native Americans have great need\nfor intervention to reduce burdens from substance use.\nThere are 562 federally recognized American Indian tribes\nin the United States; the cultural diversity and geo-\ngraphic dispersion of these tribes have important impli-\ncations for research and service provision, requiring policy\nsupport to develop culturally appropriate interventions\nThe results also support rising concerns about adoles-\ncent marijuana use.25 Marijuana use disorders consti-\ntuted 74.0% of all illicit or nonmedical substance-\nrelated disorders, and 25.9% of marijuana users exhibited\na marijuana use disorder, which (along with heroin, co-\ncaine, and sedatives) represented the highest condi-\ntional rate of substance-related disorders. The high rate\ncan be related to frequency of use, as marijuana users (on\naverage) spent the most days using the drug compared\nwith other substance users. This is the first known study\nto present such findings for all substance classes, and it\nreveals cause for concern owing to the large number of\npast-year marijuana users (13.0% of all adolescents), a\nrecent increase in marijuana use, increased levels of mari-\nAlcohol or Drug Alcohol and Drug\nSubstance Use Disorders\nPrevalence, %\nWhite\nAfrican American\nNative American\nAsian or Pacific Islander\nMultiple race/ethnicity\nHispanic\nFigure 4.

The large sample helped identify analgesic opioid-\nusing adolescents of these racial/ethnic groups exhibit-\ning elevated odds of analgesic opioid use disorders. Com-\nherein support an elevated rate of nonmedical analgesic\nopioid use and analgesic opioid-related problems across\nvarious racial/ethnic groups. This finding is consistent\nwith evidence showing that one-fourth of users of non-\nmedical analgesic opioids aged 12 to 17 years had never\nused other illicit or nonmedical drugs22 and that adoles-\ncents have generally considered analgesic opioids safer\nand easier to get than illicit drugs, and reported parents'\nmedicine cabinets, family members, or friends as pri-\nmary sources.57,58 Unfortunately, analgesic opioids are\namong the most addictive and lethal drugs when used\nimproperly.59,60 Clearly, educational or prevention inter-\nventions should incorporate effective messages about\nhealth risk for nonmedical use or abuse of prescription\ndrugs, and screening for nonmedical drug use should be\nconsidered for high-risk adolescents.\nThese findings should be interpreted with caution. The\nNSDUH relies on self-reports, which can be influenced\nby memory error and underreporting. As in other sur-\nveys, substance-related disorders are surveyed in the\nNSDUH based on standardized questions designed to op-\nerationalize DSM-IV criteria for substance-related disor-\nders; these rates are self-reported estimates, not clinical\ndiagnoses. Of note, the NSDUH-based past-year 6.7%\nprevalenceofsubstance-relateddisorders(alcoholordrug)\nsubstance-related disorders among adults in the Na-\ntional Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey.34 Find-\nings also do not apply to institutionalized or homeless\nadolescents, who were not included in the NSDUH. Nico-\ntine dependence is excluded because it was not based on\nDSM-IV criteria; hence, adolescents' substance-related dis-\norder problems are greater than our findings have sug-\ngested. This study also does not address the influence of\ncommunity-level poverty or intraethnic differences (eg,\ndifferences among Hispanic groups) in substance-\nrelated disorders, as detailed measures are unavail-\nUS population, the availability of data sets for specific ra-\ncial/ethnic groups and community-level poverty in fu-\nture NSDUH would make it possible to monitor dispari-\nties in substance-related disorders for heterogeneous\nracial/ethnic groups.\nThe NSDUH also has noteworthy strengths. These re-\nsults have a higher level of generalizability than those of\na regional sample owing to high response rates and the\nlarge sample consisting of students and nonstudents or\nschool dropouts. The 3.8% proportion of nonstudents or\nschool dropouts among adolescents aged 16 to 17 years\nin this sample was similar to the 3.9% proportion of drop-\nouts among US public high school students.62 While the\nUS Census does not provide detailed information about\nracial/ethnic groups for adolescents aged 12 to 17 years,\nthis study's distributions resemble those of all ages in the\nUnited States among groups of Native American (0.6%\nFurthermore, based on continuous research efforts and\nenhancements to improve national substance-related dis-\norder estimates, the NSDUH uses the most sophisti-\ncated survey methods available to improve the quality\nof self-reported data (detailed probes, color pictures of\nprescription drugs to augment assessments for sub-\nstance use, and computer-assisted self-administration in-\nterviewing and anonymous data collection to enhance\nprivacy).31 A large reliability study63 found substantial (for\nabuse or dependence questions) to almost perfect (for\ncigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use questions) re-\nsponse agreement for key NSDUH measures; another\nNSDUH validity study64 revealed high agreement be-\ntween self-reported use and urine drug test results (84.6%\ncaine). The trend data of the NSDUH on various drug\nuse patterns among adolescents are remarkably consis-\ntent with trend data from Monitoring the Future.10,31 Given\nthe growing diversity and size of the young population\nand the scarcity of substance-related disorder indica-\ntors, this study makes a unique contribution by provid-\ning new information to elucidate the magnitude of il-\nlicit and prescription drug use disorders for understudied\nAsians or Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispan-\nics, and African Americans.\nCONCLUSIONS\nNative Americans have the highest prevalence of sub-\nstance use and substance-related disorders, adding to evi-\ndence that young Native Americans are a vulnerable group\nfacing numerous stressors, trauma, and health dispari-\nties (eg, highest rate of suicide, underfunded systems of\ncare, and lack of access to appropriate care).65 The re-\nsults herein highlight a critical need for intervention to\nreduce their burdens from substance use and for poli-\ncies to address presently underfunded systems of care and\nimprove infrastructures linking behavioral and primary\nhealth care services.54,65 In addition, high rates of sub-\nstance use and substance-related disorders among ado-\nlescents of multiple race/ethnicity provide a rationale for\nincluding them in research analysis and reporting find-\nings as appropriate. Furthermore, while health care pro-\nviders who regularly see adolescents for periodic check-\nups can have a critical role in screening for substance use\nand early intervention, substantial barriers to recom-\nmended practices exist, and research is needed to iden-\ntify incentives and means to promote screening and timely\nintervention.66,67 Finally, many addiction treatment pro-\ngrams either exclude adolescents from treatment (eg, pro-\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\ngram policies) or integrate adolescents into programs serv-\ning adults. Even within adolescent-specific programs, key\nelements for effective treatment are often inadequately\naddressed, and a lack of cultural competence is identi-\nfied as a major gap, as insensitivity to cultural differ-\nences can limit the ability to treat and retain minority\nadolescents.14,68-70 Taken together, these findings call for\nefforts to identify and expand prevention measures that\nare culturally effective and address the quality and ac-\nceptability of treatment for adolescents with substance\nSubmitted for Publication: April 5, 2011; final revision\nCorrespondence: Li-Tzy Wu, ScD, Department of Psy-\nchiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University Medi-\n@duke.edu).\nFinancial Disclosure: Dr Woody is a member of the Re-\nsearched Abuse Diversion and Addiction-Related Sur-\nveillance (RADARS) system postmarketing study scien-\ntific advisory group, whose job is to assess abuse of\nprescription medications.
