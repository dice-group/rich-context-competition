Popkin*\n Key words: China, motorized transportation, weight\ngain\nIntroduction\nInactivity is associated with a range of adverse health\noutcomes, not the least of which is obesity. In the United\nStates, an increase in the prevalence of overweight in both\nchildren and adults has continued unabated over the last two\nor three decades (1,2), and recent data suggest over 10% of\nchildren and 50% of adults are overweight (3). The direct\neconomic cost of illness in the U.S. due to lack of physical\nactivity has been conservatively estimated at 24 billion\ndollars and the cost of obesity at 70 million dollars (4).\nMoreover, obesity is second only to smoking as a contrib-\nutor to mortality (5).\nAdvances in technology and transportation are consid-\nered key explanations for greater inactivity in the population\n(6). Labor-saving devices have eliminated many of the\nback-breaking tasks of agricultural- and industrial-sector\noccupations and reduced the time it takes to complete them\n(7). These occupational sectors have also shrunk in size,\nwith more people working in service industry occupations\n(8). Occupations in this sector tend to be sedentary, pro-\nmoting weight gain (9). Technology has also created oppor-\ntunity for increasingly sedentary leisure time. For example,\ntelevision viewing has been associated with an increase in\nthe prevalence of obesity in the U.S. and the United King-\ndom (10,11). Dependence on motorized forms of transpor-\ntation is also likely to have increased inactivity by reducing\nthe need for more active forms of transportation. However,\ndespite a growing emphasis on altering land use and trans-\nport systems to encourage physical activity (12\u00ad14), evi-\ndence implicating changes from active to passive forms of\ntransportation as a cause of obesity is difficult to find. One\nreason is that in affluent countries there is virtually no\nvariation in the type of transportation used.

This offers an ideal opportunity to de-\ntermine whether motorized forms of transportation promote\nobesity, and if so, to encourage continued dependence on\nactive forms of transportation as an effective obesity pre-\nvention strategy.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nThe China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a\nlongitudinal survey of health and nutrition in China, con-\nducted jointly by the China Academy of Preventive Medi-\ncine and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe initial survey was in 1989 and included eight provinces\n(Shangdong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guizhou,\nGuangxi, and Liaoning). Follow-up surveys were conducted\ndid not participate in the 1997 survey. The survey is not\nnationally representative, but the provinces vary consider-\nably in geography, stage of economic development, and health\nstatus. This variation was achieved using a multistage, random-\ncluster sampling process. Four counties were selected within\neach of the above provinces. Within each county or urban area,\nneighborhoods were randomly selected from suburbs, town-\nships, and villages. Twenty randomly selected households\nwere targeted within each neighborhood. Health workers vis-\nited each survey household with questionnaires on sociodemo-\ngraphics, health, and nutrition that were directed at both the\nhousehold and individual level. Further details about the\nCHNS have been published (17).\nCross-sectional survey respondents included 5247 of\nthe 1997 survey. Five hundred and six participants were\nexcluded because they were missing energy-intake or work-\nrelated physical-activity data, which left a sample of 4741.\nThe questions were asked as part of a 3-day dietary recall\nthat was separate from the main survey questionnaire and\nhad a higher respondent burden. We also followed a cohort\nweight and height data collected at baseline. Those lost to\nfollow-up did not differ to those remaining in the study with\nrespect to the primary outcome (weight status) or to the\nexposure (vehicle ownership). However, they were signifi-\ncantly more likely to be male, reside in an urban area, and\nbe in the highest third of income. They were also younger.\nObesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) 25\nkg/m2, in accordance with new weight status cut-offs for\nAsian populations proposed by the International Obesity\nTaskforce and the World Health Organization (18). This is\nconsiderably lower that the definition used for the U.S.\npopulation (BMI  30 kg/m2). Height was measured with-\nout shoes to the nearest 0.2 cm, using a portable stadiom-\neter. Weight was measured without shoes and with light\nclothing to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a calibrated beam scale.\nHigh waist circumference was defined at 90 cm for men\nand 80 cm for women (18). Waist circumference was not\nmeasured in 1989. Vehicle ownership was defined at the\nhousehold level based on four categories: no vehicle, non-\nmotorized vehicle only (bicycles and tricycles), motorized\nvehicle only (motorcycles and cars), and both motorized and\nnonmotorized vehicles. Questions on work-related physical\nactivity were used to create a three-level work-related ac-\ntivity variable: light (e.g., receptionist), moderate (e.g., elec-\ntrician), and heavy (e.g., farmer). In the 1997 survey, ques-\ntions on five categories of leisure-time activity (martial\narts, dance, team sports, jogging/swimming, and court\nsports) were used to create a binary variable based on\nwhether or not an individual participated in one of these\nactivities at least 12 times in the previous year. Dietary-\nintake data were collected by nutritionists using 24-hour\nrecalls collected over 3 consecutive days, and condiments\nand added oils were measured and weighed over the same\ndays. A weekend day was not necessarily included.\nDaily-energy intake and fat intake were calculated using\nIn the cross-sectional analysis, differences in the odds of\nbeing obese according to vehicle ownership were calculated\nin Stata (Version 7.0; Stata Corp., College Station, TX)\nusing generalized estimation equations (GEE). We assumed\na binomial distribution and used a logit link function and an\nexchangeable working correlation matrix. Clustering by\nhousehold was accounted for in the model and we adjusted\nfor age (continuous in the range 20 to 55 years), work (light,\nmoderate, heavy), leisure activity (participation in at least\none of five activities such as martial arts), energy intake\n(kilocalories, continuous), smoking status (smoker, ex-\nsmoker, or nonsmoker), alcohol consumption in the past\nyear (yes/no), per capita income (low, medium, high) with\nthe income deflated to 1.0 for rural Liaoning province for\n1988, educational attainment (primary, secondary, tertiary),\nhousehold ownership of a computer (yes/no) and TV (yes/\nno), and urban or rural residence. In the cohort analysis,\ndifferences in the odds of becoming obese according to the\nacquisition of a motorized vehicle were calculated using the\nsame method, but for this analysis we adjusted for baseline\nage, weight, education, urban residence, and change in\nwork-related activity (i.e., heavy to moderate), energy in-\ntake, smoking status, alcohol consumption, income, and\ntelevision ownership. Alternative models were run where\nenergy intake was divided into fat and nonfat components to\ndetermine the specific impact of dietary fat (not shown).\nDietary fat was an important contributor to weight gain and\nobesity, but it did not confound the association between\nvehicle ownership and these outcomes differently from\nmodels where energy was not partitioned.\nMotorized Transportation and Obesity in China, Bell, Ge, and Popkin\nResults\ntransportation. Two-thirds of households had nonmotorized\nforms of transportation and 16% had no vehicles (Table 1).\nAs the mode of transportation shifted from walking (no\nvehicle) to cycling to driving, BMI (p for trend  0.001)\nand waist circumference (p for trend  0.001) increased.\nDeclines in daily-energy intake and heavy work-related\nphysical activity accompanied this trend, as did increases in\nfat intake, income, tertiary education, leisure-time activity,\ncomputer and TV ownership, and urban residence (p for\ntrend  0.001 in each case). Those who exclusively owned\nmotorized transportation were a small but unique group that\nwe do not discuss further but include in our models.\nHousehold ownership of a motorized vehicle was asso-\nciated with greater odds of prevalent obesity in men and\nwomen and a high (90 cm) waist circumference in men\n(Figure 1).

This compared with a 2% increase among\nthose who acquired a nonmotorized form of transportation\n(50 participants) and an 8% increase among the group who\nhad no change in vehicle ownership (661 participants). The\nequivalent increases in obesity for women (13%, 9%, and\n13%, respectively) were not significantly different. We ex-\ncluded 28 participants who lost or sold a vehicle. At base-\nline, those who acquired a motorized vehicle were younger\nhad a lower daily-energy intake (p  0.01, men and\nwomen). Fat intake was not significantly different. They\nwere less likely to engage in heavy work-related activity\n(p  0.05, women) but more likely to have high income\n(p  0.01, men), have at least one TV in the household (p \n0.01, men and women), and to live in an urban area com-\npared with those who had no change in vehicle ownership.\nThese differences were more obvious for men than women.\nMotorized vehicle acquisition was an important predictor\nof weight gain in men. Compared with those who had no\nchange in vehicle ownership and excluding all those who\nwere obese at baseline, men in households who acquired a\n2.83) greater weight gain after adjustment for confounders\n(Figure 2).

For this reason we investigated the odds of\nbecoming obese according to household vehicle acquisition.\nCompared with no change in vehicle ownership, the acqui-\nsition of a motorized vehicle was associated with greater\nodds of becoming obese in men (Figure 3).

These odds were attenuated somewhat by adjust-\nment for confounders, but they remained significant (OR,\nthose who had no change in vehicle ownership, but the\ndifference was not significant. Interestingly, motorized ve-\nhicle acquisition did not increase the odds of becoming\nobese for women, regardless of adjustment.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, using both cross-sectional and cohort data,\nhousehold ownership of motorized transportation was asso-\nciated with obesity in men and women, and the acquisition\nof a motorized vehicle increased the odds of becoming\nobese in men. Furthermore, these associations persisted\nafter adjustment for an array of environmental, behavioral,\nand biological factors known to influence weight.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to look di-\nrectly at the impact of motorized transportation on\nweight. Transportation is most commonly mentioned in\nthe literature as a barrier to effective nutrition-exercise\nintervention programs and not as an independent risk\nfactor for obesity (19,20). Only a handful of studies relate\ntransportation and obesity. One cross-sectional study of\n290 adults in Bahrain found that ownership of a car was\npositively associated with obesity (21). In the U.S., long-\nhaul truck drivers are known to be at risk for sleep apnea\nand other obesity-related disorders. (22,23)\nDespite this lack of evidence, the relationship we ob-\nserved between mode of transportation and obesity is an\nintuitive one, and one with an obvious etiologic pathway.\nThe health benefits of walking and other forms of aerobic\nexercise for weight control have been well-established in an\nFigure 2: Change in weight with the acquisition of nonmotorized\nMotorized Transportation and Obesity in China, Bell, Ge, and Popkin\nexperimental context (24,25). Walking has also been dem-\nonstrated to be beneficial to health in free-living contexts\n(26,27). Motorization contributes to obesity by replacing\nactive forms of transportation, such as walking or cycling,\nwith passive forms. Ecological data also support our obser-\nvations. First, the proliferation of motorized transportation\nin affluent countries has coincided with the increasing prev-\nalence of obesity (16). Second, countries that emphasize active\nforms of transportation, such as Holland, have lower levels\nof obesity than countries that don't, such as the U.S. (28).\nCities in China tend to have the high population density\nand mixed land uses (i.e., people work in walking or cycling\ndistance from home) that are conducive to nonmotorized\nforms of transportation (16). Moreover, as we have shown,\nbicycling and walking remain the dominant forms of trans-\nportation. A cost of continued economic development, how-\never, seems to be worsening conditions for cyclists and\npedestrians, as cities make way for motorized forms of\ntransportation (29). One reason could be that cars have\nbecome a symbol of economic success, and this may partly\nexplain our observation that motorized vehicle acquisition\nled to weight gain in men but not women. We did not have\na measure of vehicle use, but it is likely that men were the\npredominant users of motorized vehicles whereas women\nwere more likely to use nonmotorized vehicles. No devel-\noping country data exist on gender differences in vehicle\nuse. However, gender differences in the incidence of fatal\nautomobile crashes in the U.S. can be attributed to greater\nexposure among men (30). With evidence that declines in\nwork-related physical activity are related to weight gain in\nChina, coupled with increases in dietary-fat intake (9,31),\npeople will need to adopt more active leisure-time activities\nand maximize their opportunities for incidental physical\nactivity (e.g., walking to work or shops). Increased automo-\nbile dependence does not need to be an inevitable\nconsequence of economic development. China has the op-\nportunity to develop their traditional dependence on non-\nmotorized vehicles into an obesity prevention strategy. This\nwill require preserving existing policies and infrastructure\nthat support nonmotorized transportation and avoiding\nchanges in urban form and transportation systems that en-\ncourage motorized transportation. Ironically, the U.S. and\nother countries are now putting considerable effort into\nrecreating the type of active transportation environment that\nOur study has some limitations. The data are not nation-\nally representative. We did not have data on waist circum-\nference at the onset of study, and future analyses need to test\nthe impact of vehicle acquisition on the distribution of body\nfat. It is likely that there is a lag time between acquisition of\na motorized vehicle and the onset of obesity. However, so\nfew people acquired a motorized vehicle between 1989 and\n1993 that we were unable to demonstrate this. Also, we did not\nadequately address the issue of endogeneity (34). People may\nchoose their mode of transportation based on reasons related to\ntheir weight. We think this is unlikely in China, especially\ncompared with the U.S., but to truly address this issue, a\nprospective, randomized control trial is needed where weight\nchange is monitored in people randomly assigned to receive\na motor vehicle or to maintain their no-vehicle status.\nEncouraging active forms of transportation may be one\nway to protect against the obesity epidemic. There are\nnumerous economical and environmental advantages to lim-\niting automobile dependence. These data suggest there may\nalso be advantages in terms of public health.\n"
