Klag, MD, MPH\nBackground: The prevalence and incidence of end-\nstage renal disease in the United States are increasing, but\nmilder renal disease is much more common and may of-\nten go undiagnosed and undertreated.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study of a representative\nsample of the US population was conducted using\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nelevated serum creatinine level was defined as 141\n\u00b5mol/L or higher (1.4 mg/dL) for women (99th per-\ncentile for healthy young adults) and was the main out-\ncome measure.\nResults: Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures,\npresence of hypertension, antihypertensive medication\nuse, older age, and diabetes mellitus were all associated\nwith higher serum creatinine levels. An estimated 3.0%\n(5.6 million) of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popu-\nlation had elevated serum creatinine levels, 70% of whom\nwere hypertensive. Among hypertensive individuals with\nan elevated serum creatinine level, 75% received treat-\nment. However, only 11% of all individuals with hyper-\ntension had their blood pressure reduced to lower than\n130/85 mm Hg (the Sixth Report of the Joint National\nCommittee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nHigh Blood Pressure recommendation for hypertensive\nindividuals with renal disease); 27% had a blood pres-\nsure lower than 140/90 mm Hg. Treated hypertensive in-\ndividuals with an elevated creatinine level had a mean\nscribed one antihypertensive medication.\nConclusion: Elevated serum creatinine level, an indi-\ncator of chronic renal disease, is common and strongly\nrelated to inadequate treatment of high blood pressure.\ncontrol is widely recog-\nnized as an essential fac-\ntor in slowing the pro-\ngression of chronic renal\ndisease and preventing its main sequelae,\nend-stage renal disease (ESRD) and car-\ndiovascular disease.1-7 As a result, antihy-\npertensive blood pressure treatment goals\nare lower for individuals with both\nhypertension and chronic renal disease\nHg for individuals with 1 g/d of pro-\nteinuria) than for hypertensive indivi-\nduals without target organ damage\ndividuals with chronic renal disease are\nusually asymptomatic and often go undi-\nagnosed. Thus, hypertension may be un-\ndertreated among patients with chronic re-\nnal disease. Data on the adequacy of blood\npressure treatment in this group are criti-\ncal for preventive efforts to stem the epi-\ndemic of ESRD8 and cardiovascular dis-\nease in chronic renal disease.9\nThe Third National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\ndata offer the first opportunity to study the\nprevalence and number of people with\nchronic renal disease (detected by an el-\nevated serum creatinine level) in a nation-\nally representative sample. An initial analy-\nsis from NHANES III showed that the\nprevalence of elevated serum creatinine\nlevel was higher among non-Hispanic\nblacks than non-Hispanic whites and\nhigher among older than younger indi-\nviduals.10 The present analysis was under-\ntaken to measure the prevalence of el-\nevated serum creatinine level across\ndifferent categories of blood pressure and\nantihypertensive medication use. In ad-\ndition, we examined the number and type\nof antihypertensive medications used and\nthe achieved blood pressure among indi-\nviduals with elevated serum creatinine lev-\nels who were prescribed medicine for hy-\nThe affiliations of the authors\nappear in the "
