Using logistic regression, we calculated standard-\nized prevalence differences (PDs)--the weighted average CMV preva-\nlence among higher sexual risk groups minus CMV prevalence among the\nlowest sexual risk group--for each of several sexual activity markers (ever\nhad sex, number of sex partners [lifetime and past year], age at first inter-\ncourse, potential years of sexual activity, ever use oral contraceptives, herpes\nsimplex virus type 2 antibody, and a calculated composite marker).\nResults: Even after controlling for covariates, we found associa-\ntions between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity among non-\nHispanic black [all PDs for sexual activity markers were positive and\nand non-Hispanic white women (15 of 18 PDs for sexual activity\n18.5%).

Ex-\nperts agree that educational efforts such as highlighting the impor-\ntance of washing hands after contact with young children should\nreduce CMV infection because CMV is transmitted through contact\nwith infected body fluids (e.g., saliva, urine).7\u00ad9 Approximately 40%\nof US children acquire CMV before the age of 11 years from non-\nsexual sources including their mother (transmitted in utero,10 during\nbirth,11 or during breast-feeding12) and close contact with others,\nespecially children.13\u00ad16 For adolescents and adults, in addition to\ntransmission from close-nonsexual contact, CMV can be transmitted\nduring activities associated with sex including kissing.15,17,18 It is\nunknown whether a substantial proportion of individuals acquire\nCMV infections during sexual activities, thus it is unclear if preven-\ntion messages should include sexual activities.\nWe previously reported demographic differences in CMV sero-\nprevalence and the force of infection in the United States using\ndata from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III).16,20 CMV seroprevalence increased by age\nwas higher in women than men and it was lower among non-\nHispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Ameri-\ncans.16 This article continues this work by assessing the association\nbetween CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity markers among 15-\nto 44-year-old NHANES III participants.\nMethods\nDesign and Sample\nMethodology and response rates have been published for\nNHANES III, a cross-sectional survey of the US population.21,22\nWe thank Matthew Staras of Syzygy Graphics for graphic creation; Dr. John\nBennett of Emory University for helpful conversations; and Kay Radford,\nMinal Amin, and Ashley Schoenfisch of the CDC for serologic testing.\nThis study was sponsored by the CDC and the National Vaccine Pro-\ngram Office.

We tested sera from NHANES III\nparticipants for CMV-specific-IgG, using an enzyme linked im-\nmunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure, at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.16 We used the Triturus robot\n(Grifols USA, Inc., Miami, FL) with SeraQuest ELISA reagents\n(Quest International, Inc., Miami, FL) and validated the perfor-\nmance of the SeraQuest test with VIDAS ELISA (bioMe\n\u00b4rieux,\nDurham, NC).\nTo assess the relationship between these serologic results and\nsexual activity markers, we included 15- to 44-year-old NHANES\nIII participants who had serum available for CMV testing (95% of\nexamined participants). Data were also available for NHANES III\nyears old [herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence]\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data.htm). The\nstudy protocol was approved by ethics review boards at the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University, and\nUniversity of Florida.\nSexual Activity Markers\nWe obtained information on participant's sexual activities from\nthe questionnaire and laboratory examinations. We defined cate-\ngories of sexual activity markers differently by age and gender\nbecause (a) the NHANES III questionnaire content differed by age\nand gender and (b) strong associations existed between sexual\nactivity and age and gender in our preliminary analysis and in\nParticipants 15 years old were asked about their sexual activ-\nities. For participants 15 to 44 years old, the NHANES III dataset\ncontained serologic results for a sexually transmitted infection\n(STI) (HSV-2 glycoprotein gG-2 antibody)25 and 3 self-reported\nsexual activity markers (ever had sexual intercourse, age at first\nsexual intercourse, and potential years of sexual activity). We\nrestricted analysis of ever had sexual intercourse to 15- to 19-year\nolds because few older participants reported never having sexual\nintercourse. We categorized age at first intercourse, collected as a\ncontinuous marker, into approximate quartiles. We calculated po-\ntential years of sexual activity by subtracting age at first inter-\ncourse (years) from age at interview (years).\nAdditional markers (number of lifetime and past-year sexual\npartners) were available for individuals 17 to 44 years old; for\nthese continuously collected markers we created quartile catego-\nries. Also women reported whether they ever used oral contracep-\ntives.\nWe created a composite sexual activity marker using the sexual\nactivity markers described above except HSV-2. We restricted\nanalysis of the composite marker to 17- to 44-year olds because\nseveral sexual activity markers were not assessed among 15- to\n16-year olds. For each sexual activity marker, we assigned a value\nof 1 to the lowest category of sexual activity and a value of 0 to the\nother categories. We summed these values across the sexual ac-\ntivity markers, yielding a score of 0 to 4 for men and 0 to 5 for\nwomen, and grouped the composite marker by number of variables\nin the lowest risk category: high risk  0, intermediate risk  1,\nand low risk 1 variable in the lowest category of sexual activity.\nWe calculated the composite variable in 2 additional ways for\nsensitivity analyses: without the use of oral contraceptives for\nwomen (i.e., identical to men) and with HSV-2 for both genders.\nPotential Confounders\nBased on a priori information, we identified demographic vari-\nables (race/ethnicity, gender, age, family size, census region, coun-\ntry of origin, and education level) and children in the home as\npotential confounders.15,16 We categorized demographic variables\nsimilar to our previous analysis,16 with the following modifica-\ntions: we assessed age in 1-year categories and we combined 2\ncategories of family size (1 person and 2\u00ad4 people).\nThe presence of children in participant's homes was not directly\nprovided in the NHANES III dataset. For 15- to 44-year-old\nwhether children were present. In some families, all members\nparticipated in NHANES III; among these 4180 participants we\nobserved family members' ages. An additional 2784 participants\nresponded to a version of the questionnaire where the presence of\nchildren younger than 17 years in the home was clear. For the\nremaining 2741 participants, we inferred that those reporting a\nfamily size 6 had children (n  832), those reporting a family\nsize of 2 and a spouse did not have children (n  87), and made\nno inferences for the other 1822 participants. Characteristics were\nsimilar for participants for whom child status was and was not\ninferred. Because we could not control for the presence of children\nin the entire NHANES III population, we restricted analyses to the\n81% of participants for whom child status was recorded or inferred\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used SUDAAN software version 9.0 (RTI International)27 to\naccount for the sample design and incorporate sampling weights,\nallowing estimates to represent the US population.22,28 Early in the\nanalysis, we detected effect measure modification of sexual activ-\nity and CMV seroprevalence between age, race/ethnicity, and\ngender strata. Thus, we stratified analyses by 10-year-age groups,\nrace/ethnicity, and gender.\nFor each marker of sexual activity, we used both age-adjusted\n(1-year-age categories) and multivariate (a priori selected covari-\nates) logistic regression to estimate the association between sexual\nactivity and CMV seroprevalence. In multivariate logistic regres-\nsion, we combined categories of covariates to avoid small cells in\n7 of the 18 age-race/ethnicity-gender strata.\nUsing predicted marginals,27,29 we calculated prevalence esti-\nmates, standardized prevalence differences (PDs) (the standardized\nprevalence among higher sexual risk groups minus the prevalence\nfor low sexual risk30), and 95% confidence intervals. We chose\nstandardized PDs instead of prevalence ratios (PR) to facilitate\ncomparisons between strata with diverse seroprevalence estimates.\nFor example, comparing seroprevalence estimates between high\nand low sexual risk groups (e.g., 80% and 60% among non-\nHispanic blacks and 60% and 40% among non-Hispanic whites)\nrepresents a 20% PD. Using PR, however, would inadvertently\nshow a greater influence of sexual activity in non-Hispanic whites\n(PR  1.5) than non-Hispanic blacks (PR  1.3).\nAdditionally, we analyzed the association between HSV-2 se-\nroprevalence and sexual activity (ever had sex and composite\nsexual activity markers). We used this analysis to compare the\nassociation between sexual activity and CMV seroprevalence with\nthe association between sexual activity and a virus predominately\ntransmitted sexually.\nResults\nAmong 16-year olds, approximately 50% reported ever having\n44-year olds, the median reported number of lifetime sex partners\nwas 7 among men and 3 among women. In age-adjusted and\nmultivariate analyses, we found similar results for the association\nbetween CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity markers, thus\nonly multivariate results are shown. Similar results were also found in\nthe subset of participants who did not have children in the home.\nIndividual Sexual Activity Markers\nThe association between CMV seroprevalence and reporting ever\nhaving sex differed by gender and race/ethnicity (Table 1). We found\na significant PD comparing women who reported \"ever had sex\" to\nwomen who reported \"never had sex\" among non-Hispanic blacks.\nCMV seroprevalence was higher among non-Hispanic white and\nMexican American women who reported having sex compared with\nthose who did not report having sex.\nAmong 15- to 44-year olds, the association between CMV\nseroprevalence and the sexual activity markers differed by age-\nrace/ethnicity-gender (Fig. 1). Among non-Hispanic black women,\nall PDs were positive (Fig. 1A). Among non-Hispanic white\nwomen, we found positive PDs for most of the markers studied.\nAmong Mexican American women, we found fewer positive PDs\nand many estimates close to 0. We compared the number of\npositive PD estimates for the 3 age groups and 6 sexual activity\nmarkers (a total of 18 PD estimates for each race/ethnicity cate-\ngory) and found a higher number of positive PD estimates among\nnon-Hispanic black women compared with women of other race/\nAmong men, nearly all PDs were positive among non-Hispanic\nblacks, but many confidence intervals included 0 (Fig. 1B). We found\nlittle or no association between CMV seroprevalence and sexual\nactivity among non-Hispanic white or Mexican American men. We\ncompared the number of positive PD estimates for the 3 age groups\nand 5 sexual activity markers (a total of 15 PD estimates for each\nrace/ethnicity category) and found a higher number of positive PD\nestimates among non-Hispanic black men compared with men of the\nComposite Sexual Activity Marker\nAmong 17- to 44-year olds, each category of the composite\nsexual risk marker separated the individual sexual activity markers\nwell. For example, the median reported number of lifetime sex\npartners increased across categories of composite sexual risk (low,\nSimilarly, HSV-2 seroprevalence increased by category of com-\nWe found similar results for the association between CMV\nseroprevalence and the composite sexual activity marker regard-\nless of the inclusion of HSV-2 or use of oral contraceptives\n(women only). Thus results are shown for our primary analysis:\ncomposite marker calculated without HSV-2 and with the use of\noral contraceptives among women. Within each age stratum of\nnon-Hispanic black women, CMV seroprevalence increased by\ncategory of sexual risk (Table 2). PD estimates, the weighted\naverage of high and intermediate sexual risk minus low sexual risk,\nwere similar across age categories. The association was statisti-\ncally significant when all ages were included.\nWithin each age stratum of non-Hispanic white women, we\nfound the lowest CMV seroprevalence estimate in the low sexual\nrisk category and the highest CMV seroprevalence estimate in the\nhigh sexual risk category (Table 2). The magnitude of the PD\nvaried by age, but the association between sexual activity and\nCMV seroprevalence was consistently positive (Table 2). The\nassociation was statistically significant among 25- to 34-year olds\nand when all ages were included.\nAmong Mexican American women, we observed little differ-\nence in CMV seroprevalence with increasing category of sexual\nrisk (Table 2). We found a negative seroprevalence difference in\nthe 17- to 24-year stratum, but we observed increasingly positive\nseroprevalence differences with increasing age (Table 2). Among\nages 17 to 44 years, we found a small, borderline significant PD.\nAmong men, we found little or no association between CMV\nseroprevalence and the composite sexual activity marker (Table 2).\nWhen compared with a predominately sexually transmitted vi-\nrus among women, prevalence estimates for CMV were generally\n10% to 60% higher than prevalence estimates for HSV-2 (Fig. 2).\nHSV-2 seroprevalence among 15- to 16-year-old women who\nreported they never had sex was 5% and 4% to 16% among those\nwho reported having sex (Fig. 2).\nConclusions\nEven after controlling for several potential confounders, we found\nsexual activity was associated with CMV seroprevalence in the gen-\neral population of the United States. This suggests that sexual activ-\nities were an important source of CMV infections for women of\nchildbearing age and should be a focus of prevention efforts. Because\nwomen acquiring primary CMV infections from sexual activities are\nalso at risk of becoming pregnant, CMV infections acquired during\nsexual activity may lead to congenital infections.15\nOur finding that CMV seroprevalence and sexual activities were\nmost clearly associated among non-Hispanic blacks was consistent\nTABLE 1.

For some STIs (e.g., chlamydia and gonorrhea),\ndata support several potential explanations, such as racial/ethnic\ndifferences in sexual partner selection (including partner sexual\nrisk and race/ethnicity) and differences in vaginal flora.32\u00ad35 These\nfactors may also influence CMV transmission. From the limited\ninformation available in NHANES III, household income group\ndid not appear to be an important confounder (data not shown).\nConsistent with findings for other STIs,25,36,37 we found stronger\nassociations between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity\namong women than among men. Possible explanations for the\ndisproportionate burden of STIs among women include biologic\ndifferences and partner selection. For example, some STIs are\nmore efficiently transmitted from male-to-female than from fe-\nmale-to-male, perhaps from higher viral concentrations in semen\nthan in cervical secretions.36,38 Additionally, women may be more\nlikely than men to have a sexual partner with a STI.37\nOur estimation of the association between CMV seroprevalence\nand sexual activity was likely an underestimate for several reasons.\nFirst, there is risk of sexual transmission of organisms within the\ngroups we defined as \"low sexual risk,\" illustrated by HSV-2\nseroprevalence estimates above zero among the low sexual risk\ngroups (Fig. 2). Second, there was likely risk of sexual transmis-\nsion among individuals 17 years old (whose risk could not be\nassessed with the composite marker), illustrated by HSV-2 sero-\nprevalence estimates above zero among 15- to 16-year olds who\nreported having sex (Fig. 2). Third, many sexual activity markers\nwere self-reported and probably influenced by recall, societal\nFig. 1.

Within each race/ethnicity and gender strata, for each sexual activity variable there are\n3 PD estimates: 1 for each age category. The PD is the prevalence in the lowest sexual risk category that was subtracted from the weighed\naverage of the higher sexual risk categories.

This likely nondif-\nferential misclassification of sexual risk would bias our estimates\ntoward the null. Fourth, sexual activities with no or reduced risk of\nCMV transmission (uninfected partner or condom use39 \u00ad 41)\ncould still place a participant in a category of higher sexual risk\nbecause data were not available on condom use or partner's\nCMV excretion.\nThis study was not designed to assess nonsexual modes of CMV\ntransmission. The cross-sectional design prohibited assessment of\nwhether individuals were susceptible to CMV during reported\nsexual activities. NHANES III did not collect information about\nthe participants' childhood exposures to CMV risk factors. Evi-\ndence of CMV transmission via nonsexual modes10,11,13 and our\nsuggest that many individuals acquire CMV through nonsexual\nmodes during childhood and therefore are not susceptible to CMV\nduring sexual activities. For a rough estimate of the percent of\ninfections acquired from nonsexual activity, we assumed CMV\nseroprevalence among 15- to 16-year olds who reported never\nhaving sex was attributable to nonsexual activities. Assuming only\nsmall changes in CMV seroprevalence occurred over time (i.e.,\nlittle cohort effect), nonsexual activities would appear to account\nfor at least half of the CMV infections acquired from birth to ages\n35 to 44 years old among women (Fig. 2). For example, among\nnon-Hispanic black women, we assumed the 57% CMV sero-\npositive 15- to 16-year olds who reported never having sex\nacquired CMV from nonsexual sources. Therefore, at least half\nwomen acquired CMV from nonsexual sources. To control for\nclose, nonsexual contact with children during adulthood we\nadjusted analyses for a rough proxy, the presence of children in\nthe home.\nThis study had several important strengths. First, we demon-\nstrated an association between CMV and sexual activity in 2\nunstudied populations: the US general population as a whole and\nMexican Americans in particular. In general, our findings comple-\nment similar findings regarding CMV seroprevalence among con-\nvenience samples of women attending contraceptive and STD\nity-gender strata allowed evaluation of sexual activity within strata\nwhile controlling for several potential confounders, including chil-\ndren in the home. Third, we considered multiple sexual activity\nmarkers, including a laboratory marker (antibody to HSV-2). Fi-\nnally, inclusion of individuals who reported never experiencing\nsexual intercourse allowed partial assessment of the role of non-\nsexual transmission during childhood.\nTABLE 2.

When considered with the in-\ncreased risk of delivering a newborn with congenital CMV\ninfection among women with STIs during pregnancy,15 our\nresults suggest congenital CMV infections could be prevented\nby reducing sexual acquisition of CMV among pregnant\nwomen, especially among non-Hispanic black women. Further\nstudy is needed to estimate the number of preventable congen-\nital infections and expand upon limited studies aimed at pre-\nventing sexual transmission of CMV. In a study among human\nimmunodeficiency virus-infected women, condom use reduced\nCMV acquisition.40 Thus, behavioral modifications (e.g., prac-\nticing monogamy, condom use with new partners, avoiding\npregnancy in new sexual relationships) may reduce CMV in-\nfections among pregnant women. To eliminate congenital CMV\ninfections, however, a vaccine may be required. Nevertheless,\nthe large number of CMV-susceptible women,16 who have little\nunderstanding of CMV infection or its potential consequenc-\nes,42 should be informed about CMV acquisition from sexual\nand nonsexual sources.\nReferences\n1.
