DXA reference values for adults were normalized to age; reference values for children included\ntotal and sub-total whole body results and were normalized to age, height, or lean mass. We developed an obesity\nclassification scheme by using estabbody mass index (BMI) classification thresholds and prevalences in young adults to\ngenerate matching classification thresholds for Fat Mass Index (FMI; fat mass/height2). These reference values should be\nhelpful in the evaluation of a variety of adult and childhood abnormalities involving fat, lean, and bone, for establishing\nentry criteria into clinical trials, and for other medical, research, and epidemiological uses.\nCitation: Kelly TL, Wilson KE, Heymsfield SB (2009) Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Body Composition Reference Values from NHANES.

Heymsfield2\n1 Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts, United States of America, 2 Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey, United States of America\n Introduction\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a program designed to assess the health and\nnutritional status of adults and children in the United States.\nNHANES performs a continuous, nationally representative health\nsurvey of the civilian, non-institutionalized United States popula-\ntion, collecting data on about 5000 persons each year from\ninterviews, physical examinations, and medical tests including\nbone densitometry. Previous NHANES surveys provided a widely\naccepted DXA proximal femur BMD database [1]. In 1999\nNHANES began performing DXA whole body measurements on\nsurvey subjects 8 years old and older in three mobile examination\ncenters. DXA whole body data from the mobile exam centers was\ncompiled by the NHANES study group and released on the\nCenter for Disease Control (CDC) website. Previous studies used\nthe data to investigate age, gender, and ethnic differences in whole\nbody and regional BMD [2] or compared percent body fat to\nBMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-stature ratio in adults [3].\nWe report here on an age, gender, and ethnicity-specific DXA\nbody composition and bone mineral reference database developed\nAdditionally, we developed an obesity classification scheme by\ncalculating the prevalences of well established BMI classification\nthresholds and generating similar thresholds for Fat Mass Index\n(FMI; fat mass/height2) [4]. These prevalence-matched FMI\nclassifications should offer superior specificity because the index is\nbased on fat mass, not body weight, which is composed of both fat\nand lean constituents. The reference data reported here should be\nhelpful in detecting abnormalities in whole body bone and body\ncomposition, for establishing reference ranges, for epidemiological\nconsiderations (e.g., to establish the prevalence of obesity or\nsarcopenia), and for entry criteria into clinical trials.\nMethods\nSubjects\nReference curves were developed for the following three major\nU.S. ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic Whites (hereafter referred to as\nWhite), Non-Hispanic Blacks (hereafter referred to as Black), and\nMexican Americans. There were not enough observations to\ndevelop reference data for other ethnic minorities. Blacks, Mexican\nAmericans, low-income Whites, adolescents between 12 and 19\nyears old, and subjects 60 years old and older were oversampled to\nprovide more reliable estimates for these groups [3]. Females were\nexcluded from the DXA examination if a pregnancy test was\npositive at exam time or if they said they were pregnant. Subjects\nwere also excluded if their reported weight exceeded the DXA scan\ntable weight limit of 136 kg or if their reported height was greater\nthan the DXA scan table length of 196 cm''.\nDXA Measurements\nThe whole body DXA exams in NHANES were acquired\naccording to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer\non a QDR 4500A fan beam densitometer (Hologic, Inc., Bedford,\nMA). All subjects changed into paper gowns and were asked to\nremove all jewelry and other personal effects that could interfere\nwith the DXA exam. The DXA exams were reviewed and\nanalyzed by the University of California, San Francisco Depart-\nment of Radiology Bone Density Group using industry standard\ntechniques. Analysis of all exams was performed using Hologic\nDiscovery software version 12.1 in its default configuration. Exams\nthat contained artifacts which could affect the accuracy of the\nDXA results, such as prosthetic devices, implants or other\nextraneous objects had the regional and global DXA results for\nthese exams set to missing in the dataset. The precision of the\nDXA instrument used in the NHANES study has been reported\nBody composition measurements are technology and calibration\ndependent and hence results provided by different instruments\nvary widely. The DXA instruments used in the NHANES survey\nemployed the calibration proposed by Schoeller et al. [8], whereby\nDXA lean mass results were calibrated to lean mass measured in 7\nindependent studies utilizing total body water (4 studies),\nhydrodensitometry (1 study), and four compartment measures (2\nstudies). The seven independent studies involved a total of 1195\nsubjects (602 male, 593 female). The BMD and BMC results were\ncalibrated by the DXA manufacturer and maintained by an\ninternal reference system that periodically measures bone and soft\ntissue equivalent reference standards during the patient measure-\nment.\nThe NHANES data sets contained whole body DXA\nmeasurements of bone mineral content (BMC, g), areal bone\nmineral density (BMD, g/cm2), fat mass (g) and lean mass\nincluding BMC (g) and percent fat, calculated as (fat mass divided\nby total mass) 6100 along with demographic information for each\nsubject. The above measurements were also available for a\nnumber of pre-defined anatomical regions, including the head,\narms, legs, trunk, pelvic regions, sub-total whole body (excluding\nonly the head) and whole body. From these whole body measures\nthe following derivative values were calculated: FMI (fat mass/\nheight2), lean mass/height2, appendicular lean mass/height2. For\nadults, only total body reference values and the above derivative\nreference values were generated. For children, (subjects less than\n20 years of age), total body and sub-total body reference values\nand selected derivative reference values were generated.\nThere is increasing realization that fat distribution may be as\nimportant as total fat mass, so two indices of fat mass distribution,\n%fat of the trunk divided by %fat of the legs and fat mass of the\ntrunk divided by fat mass of the limbs (fat mass of arms plus legs)\nwere included in this analysis for adults. These indices may have a\nrole in defining metabolic syndrome or lipodystorphy [9,10].\nStatistical Methods\nOur analysis used the DXA data sets released by NHANES on\nthe Center for Disease Control website http://www.cdc.gov/\nnchs/about/major/nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm). To prevent bias in the\nsurvey due to the fact that the missing data was not completely\nrandom, missing data was multiply imputed at the National\nCenter for Health Statistics as described in the technical\ndocumentation available on the above referenced website.\nThe data was partitioned into subgroups according to gender\nand ethnicity. Ethnicity was self-reported and adjudicated by\nNHANES into the three major ethnicity groups reported on here\n(White, Black, and Mexican American). To reduce the complexity\nof the reference curve fitting procedure, we further divided the\nThe number of observations in each subgroup is provided in\nFor adult subjects, DXA measures were modeled by gender and\nethnicity using age as the independent variable. Whole body fat\nand lean mass measurements and appendicular lean mass were\nnormalized to height2 as suggested by Heymsfield et al. [11].\nTable 1. Number of observations in the reference database\nby age, gender, and ethnicity.\nAge Group Gender Whites Blacks Mexican Americans\nBody Composition Reference\nFor pediatric subjects the DXA measures were modeled against\nage, height, or lean mass as the independent variable. The\ndevelopment of skeletal reference values were based on the\nrecommendations of the ICSD task force for Pediatric Official\nPositions paper [12]. Additional soft tissue reference values\ngenerated in pediatric subjects included total body %fat and lean\nmass/height2 (kg/m2).\nA curve fitting procedure called LMS (lmsChartMaker Pro\nVersion 2.3) [13] was used to generate the reference curves\nbecause it is capable of handling the relatively common situation\nwhere the underlying reference data are skew, i.e. the data are not\nnormally distributed. It does so by normalizing the underlying\nreference data by dividing the independent measure (e.g. age) into\ngroups and then applying a power transformation which extends\none tail of the distribution and contracts the other, eliminating\nskewness in the variable under analysis. A smooth curve is fitted to\nthe normalizing power transformation for each age group,\ngenerating an optimum ``L'' (power) curve that normalizes the\ndependent measure, e.g. %fat, over the entire age range. The\nprocedure also fits Median (M) and coefficient of variation (S)\ncurves, and these three curves (L, M, and S) fully describe the\nreference data. We report the more commonly used population\nstandard deviation, s, which is S times M. The z-scores can be\ncalculated by the following equation:\nZ~\n \nLs\nor\nZ~M ln X=M\nwhere X is the physical measurement (e.g. DXA Total Body\nBMD, DXA %fat, etc.), L is the power transformation, M is the\nmedian value, and s is the population standard deviation [13].\nPercentiles can be obtained from z-scores, e.g. z-scores of 21.881,\nAs previously stated, the data were separated into pediatric and\nadult groups to simplify the curve fitting process and to lower the\nequivalent degrees of freedom required to fit a suitable curve to the\nreference data. For example, it was observed that very complex\ncurves were required to produce a satisfactory model of BMC\nversus age in the entire population, due to the exponential BMC\naccrual observed in younger subjects combined with a consolida-\ntion phase of BMC in early adulthood and then a relatively modest\ndecline in BMC that occurs during aging. When these two very\ndifferent processes (growth and aging) were modeled indepen-\ndently, much simpler models could be employed with improved\ngoodness of fit and decreased complexity.\nDuring the curve fitting process, the weighted observations from\nthe NHANES data sets were fitted by selecting more parsimonious\nmodels over more complex models so long as the goodness of fit\nwas similar, i.e. we tried to avoid over fitting the curves. Further,\nwe employed careful visual inspection of the Q statistic, a plot of\nstandardized residuals in which the data are split into groups and\nthe non-random between group variations in the estimated\nmoments of the z-scores are plotted against the equivalent degrees\nof freedom used to fit the curve. The Q-statistic was considered\nsatisfactory at or below a value of 2 for the L, M, and S curves and\nif the fitted curve was reasonably smooth and plausible for the data\nbeing fitted, as recommended by the developers of LMS [13].\nAn obesity classification scheme based on FMI was developed\nby first calculating the prevalences of established WHO BMI\nclassification thresholds (e.g. normal, overweight, obese) in the\npresent NHANES survey data using ``young normal adults'' at age\nof 25. From these prevalence values for BMI, we then generated\nclassification thresholds for FMI that gave the same prevalences as\nBMI in this population at age 25. In effect we have translated the\nWHO BMI thresholds into FMI equivalent values by matching\nthe prevalences of the two indices at each classification cut-off\npoint. The FMI classifications should misclassify fewer individuals\nbecause FMI is based on fat mass, not body weight, which contains\nboth fat and lean components and therefore misclassifies some\nmuscular subjects as overweight or obese.\nResults\nThe number of observations in the reference database by age\ngroup, gender, and ethnicity is provided in Table 1. The reference\ncurves developed from the whole body DXA measures and\nderivative values from the 2008 NHANES data set are provided in\nTable 2. Reference values for each of the DXA measures in\nTable 2 are provided in supplementary Table S1 through Table\nS20 by sex and ethnicity. Scatter plots with the fits including the\nmean, the 3rd and 97th percentiles superimposed upon the raw\ndata values are provided in the supplementary Figure S1 through\nFigure S20 for adults and children.\nAs expected, significant differences were observed between\ngenders for the various measures and these differences varied with\nage. The median %fat increased monotonically with age from 17\nto 85 in males, while in women it peaked at approximately age 65.\nDifferences between ethnicities were more modest, and varied\nwith gender. Black males had slightly less %fat than non-black\nmales at all ages. Differences in %fat between non-black males and\nnon-black females was about 11\u00ad12% and fairly constant with age;\nlarger differences of 12\u00ad16% were observed between black males\nand black females and the differences were more variable with age.\nAs can be seen from the scatter plots in the Supplementary\nFigures, some of the data were not only significantly skewed, but\nthe degree of skewness and the standard deviation varied with the\nindependent variable. The curve fitting method of LMS smoothly\nmodels both varying non-normal distributions and varying\nstandard deviations to construct reference curves which accurately\nmodel the true distribution and variance of the underlying data.\nThe LMS curve fitting procedure adjusts for skewness so that the\npercentile values and z-scores generated by the LMS values are\nrobust when the data are not normally distributed. Statistical\ntheory states that a properly fitted reference curve will generate z-\nscores very close to zero with a standard deviation very close to\nunity. Using the SAS system, we calculated z-scores for all subjects\nand all DXA measures in the NHANES dataset; average z-scores\nwere very close to zero with standard deviations very close to unity\nfor all fitted DXA measures, indicating that the LMS curve fitting\nprocedure produced robust, unbiased fits to the underlying\nreference data.\nWe employed the BMI classifications from the WHO technical\nreport on the use and interpretation of anthropometry [14,15] to\nestablish similar classifications for FMI by calculating the\nprevalences at age 25 for each of the WHO BMI classification\nthresholds (e.g. mild thinness, normal, overweight, obese class 1,\netc.) and then assigning FMI values with matching prevalences to\neach classification threshold. The FMI classification ranges were\nsimilar for the three ethnic groups even though the BMI\nclassification prevalences varied widely (see Table 3). However,\nlarge differences in FMI thresholds were observed between\nBody Composition Reference\ngenders, with women having higher FMI for all classification\ncategories, requiring the use of gender-specific FMI thresholds.\nThe final FMI classification thresholds in Table 4 were based on\nthe values for White subjects in Table 3. Although the values for\nthe three ethnic groups were similar, there were many more\nobservations for White subjects and hence the use of these values\nshould provide more robust classification estimates.\nDiscussion\nThe lack of representative body composition reference values\nhas limited their potential application in clinical and research\nsettings. The current report provides the first reference values on a\nnationally representative NHANES data set acquired using well\nestablished DXA technology. These reference values should prove\nuseful for many applications previously limited by inadequate or\nunavailable reference data. The NHANES reference values\nreported here are only directly compatible with Hologic fan beam\nDXA scanners operating software version 12.5 or higher utilizing\nthe NHANES calibration. The NHANES reference data used in\nthis study included multiply imputed data and this may be a\nlimitation of the study. As with any reference database, the\napplication of these data to generate diagnostic scores for a given\npatient or patient population should be performed with appropri-\nate measure of forethought and caution.\nThe reference data presented here may be useful in detecting\nskeletal and body composition abnormalities in children arising\nfrom a wide variety of conditions and chronic diseases including\nanorexia nervosa, growth hormone deficiency, glucocorticoid use,\nimmobilization, cystic fibrosis, hypogonadism, thalassemia, mal-\nnutrition, weight management, chronic inflammatory diseases,\nendocrine disturbances, childhood cancer, transplantation, and\nother disorders [16]. Increasing numbers of children are being\nreferred for DXA whole body measurements because of its ability\nto evaluate global and regional bone mineral and body\ncomposition.

FMI thresholds were similar among the ethnic\ngroups even though their prevalences vary considerably.\nBody Composition Reference\nare currently recommended by the ISCD for the evaluation of\nsome childhood disorders [12]. Normalizing to height is\nappropriate in children with delayed growth and maturation.\nFurthermore, sub-total (whole body less head) BMD and BMC\nreference data are necessary because the head is disproportion-\nately large in young children and may mask deficits at other\nskeletal sites. As a result, we developed whole body and sub-total\nBMD and BMC reference curves for subjects 8 to 20 years old\nnormalized to both age and height. Height is an important body\nsize adjustment in children because children mature at different\nrates and because many chronically ill children are small for their\nage. As a result, chronological age may not be the best indicator of\na child's growth and development and therefore age-matched\ncomparisons may not be appropriate. The International Society\nfor Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) also recommends the use of a\nsufficiently large sample of the general population that takes into\nconsideration gender, age, and ethnicity [17]. The present\ndatabase meets all of these conditions through the use of gender,\nand ethnicity specific reference data from NHANES including\nDXA sub-total body measures normalized to age and to body size\n(height). We also developed total lean mass versus height and sub-\ntotal BMC versus lean mass reference curves for children, as\nsuggested by the ISCD in its latest Official Positions Statement for\nPediatric DXA (see www.iscd.org). These two additional curves\nshould allow for the detection of abnormalities in lean mass\naccrual, e.g. in growth hormone deficient children, and for the\ndetection of abnormalities in the bone-muscle unit, respectively, as\nsuggested by Schoenau et al. [18]. NHANES did not collect\ninformation on pubertal development and therefore no adjustment\nto the reference values to account for delayed maturation was\npossible. As a result, clinicians should use caution when\ninterpreting DXA measures in subjects with delayed or advanced\nmaturation.\nIn adults, we normalized both fat and lean mass by height2, just\nlike BMI, which is simply weight divided by height2. Studies have\nshown that lean mass and weight scale with height to\napproximately the power of two, establishing an analytic\nframework for height-scaled indices [11]. The same study also\nfound that fat mass scaled to height2, although the association was\nweaker. The present study confirmed this observation. We\nhypothesized that comparison of a subject's FMI value to healthy\nyoung normal FMI values may be useful in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of clinical obesity, for identifying subjects with high\nobesity-disease risks, and for enrolling high risk subjects in clinical\ntrials. However, while these cross sectional data enable this\ndefinition, whether this definition is useful and appropriate will\nhave to be investigated in future studies which look at obesity\nrelated morbidity and outcomes. Defining thresholds in compar-\nison to a young adult population has been adopted in the field of\nosteoporosis research (e.g. the bone mineral density T-score) and\nhas proven itself a useful tool.\nReference curves for appendicular lean mass divided by height2\nwere developed because this DXA measure is a good surrogate for\nskeletal muscle mass and a possible index of sarcopenia [19]. DXA\nis the only widely available technology capable of providing\nregional measures of fat and lean mass, and it has been shown that\nfat and lean distribution may predict health outcomes. A study of\nelderly subjects [13] demonstrated that sarcopenia, defined as\nappendicular skeletal muscle mass (kg/height2) less than two\nstandard deviations below the mean of a young reference group,\npredicted self-reported physical disability in elderly men and\nwomen independent of other covariates such as age, obesity,\nethnicity, and income level.\nIn the present NHANES database fat comprises approximately\nAlthough these %fat values may seem quite high, they are\nconsistent with the %fat reference ranges reported by NHANES in\nvalues reported here are consistent with the secular trend of\nincreasing weight and BMI in adult Americans. However, the two\nstudies used different technologies to measure %fat, so direct\ncomparisons between the two studies are difficult to interpret.\nDXA is capable of separating body mass into fat and lean\ncomponents, thereby permitting the evaluation of fat mass without\nthe confounding influence of other tissue constituents. We propose\nthe use of FMI (fat mass/height2) as a measure of abnormally low\nor excess fat mass because FMI evaluates only the fat mass\ncomponent of body weight. Using FMI, abnormalities in fat mass\ncan be assessed without interference from other unrelated\ncomponents such as excesses or deficits of muscle or water.\nOur data reveal %fat and FMI increasing up until about age 80\nin men and age 65 in women. Increasing adiposity is an unhealthy\ntrend and hence comparing DXA measurements of %fat and FMI\nto age-matched peers may not be the most appropriate approach.\nWe postulate that it may be better to compare adults to young\nnormal gender and ethnicity-matched subjects at age 25. For\nexample, using the median value of %fat for non-Hispanic white\nmales at age 25 as an arbitrary ``healthy target'', only 25% of 45\nyear old non-Hispanic white males are at or below this target, and\nby age 69, the number falls to less than 10%. Though alarming,\nthe low percentage of subjects at or below this healthy %fat target\nprobably provides a more realistic assessment of %fat and FMI\nlevels versus comparing subjects to age-matched controls, where\nby definition 50% of subjects would appear ``normal''.\nWe selected from the present data a young adult group with a\nBMI between 18.5 and 25 to establish reasonably robust reference\nvalues for ``normal'' FMI. Following this same methodology, we\ndeveloped classifications for FMI by selecting values for FMI that\nmatched the population prevalence of the WHO BMI classifica-\ntions [14] in young adults at age 25. For example, at age 25 a FMI\nvalue of greater than 6 kg/m2 for men and 9 kg/m2 for women\nmatches the same prevalence value of ``overweight'' obtained with\na BMI of 25, the BMI cut-off point for ``overweight''. Similarly,\nFMI values of greater than or equal to 9 kg/m2 for men and\nTable 4. Fat Mass Index (kg/m2) classification ranges.\nFMI Class Severe Fat Deficit Moderate Fat Deficit Mild Fat Deficit Normal Excess Fat Obese Class I Obese Class II Obese Class III\nClassification ranges for FMI that match the prevalences of the WHO BMI classifications (see Table 3). Unlike BMI, FMI is a gender specific measure of fat not confounded\nby lean tissue.\nBody Composition Reference\n13 kg/m2 for women defines the same obesity prevalence as a\nBMI of 30 in this population. Kyle et al. [21] employed similar\nmethodology to generate FMI classifications corresponding to low,\nnormal, overweight, and obese BMI categories. Note that\nalthough the same prevalences were used for each classification,\nFMI and BMI actually classify different subjects into the various\ncategories. Were this not so, it would not be possible for one\nmethod to have an advantage over the other. Gallagher et al. [22]\nused the same approach to generate guidelines for healthy percent\nfat ranges based on BMI.\nA major shortcoming of BMI is that it provides a measure of\nexcess weight, not excess fat. Another obvious limitation of BMI is\nthat it does not account for gender or ethnicity. Table 3 clearly\ndemonstrates that BMI prevalences are heavily influenced by both\ngender and ethnicity. At age 25, the FMI data in Table 3 indicates\nthat there are substantial differences in adiposity between genders,\nwith mean values for women ranging from 8.9 to 10.9 kg/m2 and\nmean values for males between 5.6 to 6.8 kg/m2 for the three\nethnic groups. From these data it appears likely that lacking\ngender or ethnicity adjustments, BMI may be overestimating\nobesity in some groups and underestimating it in others.\nFurthermore, subjects with a high degree of muscularity, e.g.\nbody builders, are often misclassified as ``overweight'' or ``obese''\nby BMI; these same subjects would probably not fall into an\nabnormal classification range with FMI because their excess\nweight is mostly lean mass. Percent body fat (%fat) measurements\nare also complicated by increased muscularity, but here the bias is\nin the opposite direction, as increases in muscle mass offset\nincreases in fat mass, making a %fat measurement appear more or\nless normal.\nWe suggest that using these proposed FMI values for overweight\nand obese classifications will result in fewer misclassifications than\neither BMI or %fat. The FMI classifications in Table 4 should be\nconsidered guidelines that may misclassify fewer individuals than\nBMI because they are based on fat mass instead of weight. It is also\nworth noting that other technologies which measure fat mass will\nhave to be calibrated to the DXA systems used in this study in\norder to make uses of these FMI classifications.\nWhether or not the use of the proposed FMI classification\nscheme will confer benefits over BMI in terms of predicting\nobesity-related morbidity or mortality will have to be investigated\nin future studies. The FMI classifications presented here are based\non prevalence data, not disease risk, and therefore the clinical\nutility of the FMI classification scheme will not be known until\ndata relating disease risk to FMI becomes available.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Fat Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S2 Percent Fat (%) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S3 % Fat Trunk/%Fat Legs vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S4 Trunk to Limb Fat Mass Ratio vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S5 Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S6 Appendicular Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in\nadults.\nFigure S7 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S8 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S9 Percent Fat (%) vs. Age in pediatrics.\nFigure S10 Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in adults.\nFigure S11 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in Pediatrics.\nFigure S12 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in pediatrics.\nFigure S13 Sub-total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in Pediatrics.\nFigure S14 Sub-total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in pediatrics.\nFigure S15 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Height (cm) in\npediatrics.\nFigure S16 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatrics.\nFigure S17 Sub-total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Height (cm) in\npediatrics.\nFigure S18 Sub-total BMC (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatrics.\nFigure S19 Total Lean Mass (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatrics.\nFigure S20 Sub-total BMC (g) vs. Total Lean Mass (g) in\npediatrics.\nTable S1 Fat Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in adult subjects.\nTable S2 %Fat (%) vs. Age in adult subjects.\nTable S3 %Fat Trunk/%Fat Legs vs. Age in adult subjects.\nBody Composition Reference\nTable S4 Trunk to Limb Fat Mass Ratio vs. Age in Adult\nsubjects.\nTable S5 Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in adult subjects.\nTable S6 Appendicular Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in\nadult subjects.\nTable S7 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in adult subjects.\nTable S8 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in adult subjects.\nTable S9 %Fat (%) vs. Age in pediatric subjects.\nTable S10 Lean Mass/Height2 (kg/m2) vs. Age in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S11 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S12 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in Pediatric subjects.\nTable S13 Sub-total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Age in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S14 Sub-total Body BMC (g) vs. Age in pediatric subjects.\nTable S15 Total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Height (cm) in\npediatric subjects.\nTable S16 Total Body BMC (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S17 Sub-total Body BMD (g/cm2) vs. Height (cm) in\npediatric subjects.\nTable S18 Sub-total BMC (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S19 Total Lean Mass (g) vs. Height (cm) in pediatric\nsubjects.\nTable S20 sub-total BMC (g) vs. Total Lean Mass (g) in\npediatric subjects.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: TLK KEW.
