Gregg2\n1 Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\n2 Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\nRecent studies have shown that diabetic men have a lower risk of prostate cancer and that this association may\nbe related to time since diagnosis. The authors examined the association between diabetes and prostate-specific\nantigen (PSA) levels, controlling for potential confounders, in a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of\nthe US population (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001\u00ad2002). Diabetes classification was\nself-reported, and undiagnosed diabetes was determined with fasting plasma glucose measurements. Controlling\nfor age, men with self-reported diabetes had a 21.6% lower geometric mean PSA level than men without diabetes.\nThe difference increased with years since diagnosis (>10 years: 27.5% lower geometric mean PSA level). Over-\nweight men who had had diabetes for more than 10 years had a predicted geometric mean PSA level 40.8% lower\nthan that of nondiabetic, normal-weight men. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that long-term\ndiabetes is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. The mechanism of this association may involve the\nregulation of PSA by androgens, although the authors are unable to confirm this assertion. Better understanding of\nthe determinants of PSA level is needed to make the distinction between factors affecting the PSA test's accuracy\nand those altering the risk of prostate cancer.\ndiabetes mellitus, type 2; prostate-specific antigen; prostatic neoplasms; testosterone\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey; PSA, prostate-specific antigen.\nRecent studies have suggested an association between\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus and lower risk of prostate cancer\n(1, 2). It has been hypothesized that men with long-term\ndiabetes have a lower risk of prostate cancer than nondia-\nbetic men, and recently diagnosed men have a higher risk (3,\n4). In biologic models proposed to explain this association,\nresearchers note the higher concentrations of insulin and\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in early diabetes and\nthe lower testosterone and IGF-1 levels and higher estrogen\nconcentrations in long-term diabetes (5, 6). Whether diabe-\ntes influences levels of biomarkers such as prostate-specific\nantigen (PSA), which is involved in the detection of prostate\ncancer, is unknown.\nFactors influencing serum PSA levels in men include age,\nbenign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and body mass in-\ndex (BMI) (7, 8). Still, we understand little about PSA, and\nits relations with comorbid conditions remain unexplored\n(9). Diabetes and PSA screening are prevalent among men\naged 50 years or older, and no doubt many men this age with\ndiabetes undergo PSA testing (10, 11). In this analysis, we\nexamined whether PSA concentrations varied by diabetes\nstatus and duration of diabetes.\nCorrespondence to Dr. Mona Saraiya, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Mail Stop K-55, 4770 Buford\nHighway NE, Atlanta, GA 30341 (e-mail: msaraiya@cdc.gov).\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\nCopyright \u00aa 2006 by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nAll rights reserved; printed in U.S.A.\nSurvey\ntion Survey (NHANES) was weighted to provide a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian\nthe NHANES interview and medical examination were 83.9\npercent and 79.7 percent, respectively. An institutional re-\nview board approved the survey. Participants provided in-\nformed consent for PSA testing.\nPSA assays were conducted on serum samples taken from\nall men aged 40 years who did not meet any of the PSA\ntesting exclusion criteria, including current prostatitis or di-\nsured using the Hybritech assay (Hybritech, Inc., San Diego,\nCalifornia) in the Beckman immunoassay system (Beckman\nInstruments, Inc., Fullerton, California).\nSample adults were asked, ``Have you ever been told by\na doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes?'' Men answering affirmatively (n \u00bc 173) were clas-\nsified as having diabetes. We calculated time since diagnosis\n(in years) by subtracting age at diagnosis from current age,\nwho reported being diabetic were also asked whether they\nwere currently taking ``diabetic pills to lower blood sugar.''\nA subset of our 1,308 participants were instructed to fast\nbefore the medical examination (n \u00bc 605). In NHANES,\nseparate weights are assigned to ensure that this fasting sam-\nple is nationally representative.

Log PSA was used as the dependent variable for the\nbivariate and linear regression analyses. In all analyses, we\nused SUDAAN, version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, North Carolina), to account for the\ncomplex sampling design. All p values (from t tests) were\ntwo-sided. We analyzed log-transformed PSA values, and\naccordingly we present geometric means in table 1. We con-\ntrolled for age when presenting results because of the known\nassociation between PSA and age. Variables for the catego-\nries of years since diagnosis of diabetes were coded as sep-\narate terms in the multivariate analyses. In constructing the\nmultiple linear regression model (table 2), we first assessed\nvariables using a series of models containing only the vari-\nable in question, the diabetes terms, including time since\ndiagnosis, and an interaction term for the interaction be-\ntween the two. Variables that were themselves significant\npredictors in the presence of the diabetes terms were in-\ncluded in the multiple linear regression model, as were any\nconfounders that altered the predicted effect of the diabetes\nterms by more than 10 percent (19). Interactions between\nthe diabetes terms and BMI, high density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol, race/ethnicity, blood pressure, age, and benign\nprostatic hyperplasia were nonsignificant.

Together they\nare associated with as much as a 40.8 percent lower pre-\ndicted geometric mean PSA level relative to nondiabetic,\nnormal-weight men. Diabetic men have lower androgen lev-\nels than nondiabetic men, and this may partially explain\ntheir lower PSA levels (6). Our finding of a significant down-\nward trend of PSA (from no diabetes to diabetes of more\nthan 10 years' duration) is consistent with a possible asso-\nciation between progressing diabetes and decreasing testos-\nterone concentrations, which may lower the risk of prostate\ncancer (21). Despite the existence of functional androgen-\nresponsive elements upstream of the PSA gene promoter,\nprevious investigations have not shown an association be-\ntween serum testosterone and PSA levels (22). However,\nPSA may be associated with testosterone in men with sub-\nnormal levels of the sex hormone (23), as is the case with\ndiabetic men. Diabetes might also alter PSA values through\nimpaired kidney function (24) or as a consequence of di-\nabetes medication use. Metformin, a hypoglycemic agent,\nhas been shown to decrease testosterone levels in nondia-\nbetic men but not in diabetic men (25, 26). In our study,\ndiabetic men taking medication appeared to have lower PSA\nlevels than diabetic men not taking medication, but our\nsmall sample size limited our statistical power to detect a\ndifference. This association can be examined more appro-\npriately with additional data.\nIn diabetes, IGF-1 levels increase during hyperinsulinemia\nand decrease as insulin production drops (27). Previous stud-\nies have found a peak in prostate cancer risk during early\ndiabetes, and a recent study (28) found a modest positive\nassociation between serum PSA and serum IGF-1 that was\nproposed to be due to IGF-1-induced benign prostatic\nTABLE 2.

We did not observe a positive\nassociation between insulin and PSA, even after restricting\nthe analysis to men aged 60 years or older. Insulin levels may\nbe a poor proxy for long-term IGF-1, however, and this mis-\nclassification may have weakened our chances of finding\nan association. We also found no association between PSA\nand the QUICKI measure of insulin resistance (p \u00bc 0.121).\nHowever, interpreting these results is made difficult by our\ninability to control for serum testosterone, which is asso-\nciated inversely with insulin, fasting glucose, and insulin re-\nIt is unclear whether the lowered PSA levels in diabetic\nmen accurately reflect a decreased risk of prostate cancer in\nthe diabetic population or whether their lower PSA levels\nresult in a reduced likelihood of receiving a diagnostic\nworkup for detection of asymptomatic prostate cancers, as\nhas been suggested for obese men (7). If the latter were true,\ndiabetic men might well be diagnosed with later-stage tumors\nand have poorer treatment outcomes, and overweight dia-\nbetic men would have later-stage tumors than normal-weight\ndiabetic men. However, data from CaPSURE (Cancer of the\nProstate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor), a registry of\nmen with prostate cancer, have not shown later stages at pre-\nsentation or worse clinical outcomes for diabetic men (30).\nThe principal limitation of this analysis is the small num-\nber of men self-reporting with diabetes. These men had a\nlower PSA levelthan men without diabetes in both our fasting\nonly in the fasting subsample did the difference attain statis-\nExamining the trend in PSA by duration of diabetes in the two\nsubsamples revealed two different trends. We do not know\nwhether these discrepancies arise from less stable estimates\nin the separated groups, whether fasting itself influences the\nrelation between PSA and diabetes, or whether there are other\ndifferences between the groups that may explain these re-\nsults. Future data from NHANES surveys will enable inves-\ntigators to make more stable estimates of geometric mean\nPSA levels among diabetic men.\nAn additional limitation of this study is that the number of\nparticipants with undiagnosed cancer was unknown, and\nthus we do not know whether differences in PSA were due\nto undiagnosed prostate cancer in the diabetic and nondia-\nbetic groups. Furthermore, without clinical data, we cannot\nbe sure that these differences in PSA result in missed biopsy\nopportunities, nor can we recommend alternate biopsy\nthresholds for diabetic men. A third limitation is that self-\nreported measures of diabetes status have been shown to be\nhighly specific but only 66 percent sensitive (31). We ad-\ndressed this concern by analyzing the fasting subsample,\nalthough there may have been additional diabetic men in\nthe NHANES who reported being nondiabetic. This mis-\nclassification would have biased our results towards the null.\nAlthough we were unable to separate men with type 1 di-\nabetes from men with type 2 diabetes in our study, excluding\nthe six persons who were diagnosed before age 30 years and\nwere currently taking insulin did not significantly alter our\nresults. In another potential source of misclassification, par-\nticipants were given the option to report having ``borderline''\ndiabetes. We categorized these men as nondiabetic (n \u00bc 29).\nThe analysis was repeated with these men categorized as\ndiabetic; no substantial changes were noted.\nSome investigators have recommended age- and race-\nspecific thresholds for prostate cancer detection based on\npopulation-level differences (20). While this study was un-\nable to demonstrate that modified PSA thresholds for dia-\nbetic men would result in greater accuracy, future studies\nshould investigate whether diabetes status, duration of di-\nabetes, and obesity should be considered when interpreting\na PSA test result. Better understanding of the determinants\nof PSA levels is needed to make the distinction between\nfactors affecting the test's accuracy and those altering the\nrisk of prostate cancer.\n"
