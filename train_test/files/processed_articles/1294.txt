Little research has been reported about the association between ethnic\ngroup concentration and depression. This study investigated the association between neighbourhood\npoverty and neighbourhood percentage Mexican American and depressive symptoms for older Mexican\nAmericans in the south western United States.\nDesign: A population based study of older non-institutionalised Mexican Americans from the\nbaseline assessment (1993/94) of the Hispanic established population for the epidemiologic study of\nthe elderly (H-EPESE) merged with 1990 census data.\nSetting: Five south western states in the United States.\nParticipants: 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 years or older.\nMain results: There was a strong correlation between the percentage of neighbourhood residents living in\npoverty and the percentage who were Mexican American (r = 0.62; p,0.001). Percentage neighbour-\nhood poverty and percentage Mexican American had significant and opposite effects on level of\ndepressive symptoms among older Mexican Americans. After adjusting for demographic and other\nindividual level factors, each 10% increase in neighbourhood population in poverty was associated with a\nCES-D score among older Mexican Americans residing in their neighbourhoods.\nConclusions: The findings suggest a sociocultural advantage conferred by high density Mexican American\nneighbourhoods, and suggest the need to include community level factors along with individual level\nfactors in community based epidemiological health studies.\nDepression is a major health problem for older adults.1 A\nnumber of factors have been consistently identified as\npredictors of depressive symptoms including low\nformal education, low income, unemployment,2 3 and limited\nsocial contact.4\u00ad8 These individual level factors are nested\nwithin more global community level factors such as\nneighbourhood composition. As such, there has been grow-\ning interest in investigating higher order contextual factors in\nconjunction with individual level factors in an attempt to\nbetter understand the health and wellbeing of the older\nInitial studies have sought to isolate the effects of\nneighbourhood composition on health risk; that is, does\nneighbourhood composition confer health risks or benefits on\ntheir residents, independent of the individual attributes of\nthose residents? Most of the work in this area has reported on\nthe adverse effects of poor neighbourhoods on health\noutcomes, including higher cardiovascular morbidity10 11\nand all cause mortality.12 13 Yen and Kaplan14 found the risk\nof depression to be twice as high for a majority of older white\nand black people living in residential areas with high poverty\nrates, after adjusting for age and gender.\nIn this study, we examine the association between\nneighbourhood composition (that is, percentage of Mexican\nAmericans living in a community and percentage poverty of\nhouseholds with incomes below the poverty line in a\ncommunity) and depressive symptoms for a cross sectional\nsample of older Mexican Americans. Older Mexican\nAmericans are a unique group in which to study community\nlevel and individual level factors on a health outcome. This is\nan economically disadvantaged population, with 20% of older\nMexican Americans living in households with poverty level\nMexican American neighbourhoods have comparatively\nhigh rates of labour force participation, intact family\nstructures, home ownership, and residential stability.16\u00ad18 If\nthe quality of social support from community is an important\ndeterminant of health,5 6 we would expect that high density\nMexican American communities may act as a buffer,\nprotecting older Mexican Americans from some of the\nadverse consequences of poverty, such as depression. The\nstudy has three hypotheses. Firstly, increasing tract percen-\ntage poverty will be associated with increased depressive\nsymptoms. Secondly, increasing proportion of older\nMexican Americans in a census tract (a small census based\ngeographical area) will be associated with decreased depres-\nsive symptoms. Thirdly, increasing proportion of older\nMexican Americans in a census tract will moderate the\neffects of increasing tract percentage poverty on depressive\nsymptoms.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are from the Hispanic established population for the\nepidemiologic study of the elderly (H-EPESE), a population\nbased study of non-institutionalised Mexican Americans\naged 65 years or older.19 Subjects were selected from the five\nsouth western states of Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado,\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: H-EPESE, Hispanic established population for the\nepidemiologic study of the elderly; ADL, activities of daily living; CES-D\nscale, Center for Epidemioligc Studies-Depression\nwww.jech.com\nand New Mexico. The sample design was for a multistage\narea probability cluster sample that involved selection of\ncounties, census tracts (a small census based geographical\narea), and households. In the first stage, counties were\nselected if at least 6.6% of the county population was of\nMexican American ethnicity. In the second stage, census\ntracts were selected with a probability proportional to\nthe size of their older (age 65+) Mexican American\npopulation, using counts from the 1990 US census.\nThere were 206 census tracts in the analysis sample. In\nthe third stage, census blocks (very small area units\nwithin census tracts) were selected at random in order to\nobtain at least 400 households within each census tract.\nThese households were screened to identify persons in\nthe target population of older Mexican Americans. The\nsampling procedure assures a sample that is genera-\nliving in the south west. The five states in the H-EPESE\nsampling frame contain 85% of the 65 and older Mexican\nAmerican population living in the United States. The\ninterviews were conducted in Spanish or English. This study\nincluded 2710 persons where complete data were available on\nthe Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D)\nscale.\nMeasures\nPhysiological level factors\nPhysiological level factors included chronic disease and\nactivities of daily living (ADL) limitations. Subjects were\nasked at the baseline assessment if they had a physician\ndiagnosis of heart attack, stroke, cancer, or diabetes. For each\nsubject the number of individual chronic diseases reported\nwas totalled and a summary chronic disease scale was\nFigure 1 Scatterplot of neighbourhood poverty on percentage Mexican\nAmerican.\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of older Mexican Americans with mean and 95%\nconfidence intervals of CES-D Score\nTotal sample n (%)\nscore\nintervals p Value*\nTract percentage\nMexican American\nTract percentage in poverty\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nEducation (years)\nPer capita household income\nrelative to county median\nPlace of birth\nChronic medical condition\n*p Value is for two tailed t test for two sample comparison of means to first listed category.

At the baseline assessment\nchronic disease, and 8% reported two or more chronic\ndiseases. ADLs were assessed at baseline assessment accord-\ning to a modified version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living\nScale.20 Subjects were coded as ADL disabled if they reported\none or more ADL limitations: bathing, using the toilet,\ntransferring from bed to chair, walking across a small room,\npersonal grooming, dressing, and eating.20 At the baseline\nreported one or more ADL limitations.\nIndividual level factors\nIndividual level factors included age, gender, marital status,\nhighest grade of schooling completed, per capita household\nincome, and place of birth (Mexico compared with US born).\nHighest grade of schooling completed was categorised as 0 to\nhousehold income was expressed as a ratio to county median\nhousehold income to adjust for the sharp differences in cost\nof living across the study area, and was logged for the\nregression analysis to normalise the distribution of the\nvariable. Of sample respondents, 59% were women, 44%\nwere foreign born, and 44% were unmarried.\nData were missing because of item non-response for\nschooling (34 cases; 1.2% of sample) and household income\n(268 cases; 9.3%). In both cases, missing values were\nimputed using best subset regression. Education was\nimputed using information about age, gender, tract education\nlevel, immigrant status, English language ability, census\noccupation, and personal income. Household income was\nimputed using personal income, house value, number of\npersons in household, marital status, education, English\nlanguage ability, state of residence, median income of county\nof residence, and reported financial strain. There were no\nsubstantive changes in reported regression parameters when\ncases were imputed rather than excluded.\nCommunity level factors\nNeighbourhood characteristics were measured using data\nlived at baseline. Sample subjects had a high degree of\nresidential stability. The median year in which subjects\nassessment was 1974. Neighbourhood percentage Mexican\nAmerican was scaled from 0 to 1, where higher scores\nindicate greater homogeneity. Neighbourhood socioeconomic\nstatus was operationalised by the percentage of persons living\nin households with income below poverty by the census\ndefinition,21 and was scaled from 0 to 1, where lower scores\nindicate increased neighbourhood poverty.\nFigure 1 presents the scatterplot of percentage Mexican\nAmerican compared with percentage neighbourhood poverty\nfor the 206 census tracts in the Hispanic EPESE study. There\nwas a strong linear association (r = 0.62) between percentage\nMexican American and percentage neighbourhood poverty.\nCorrelations of this magnitude are common in hierarchical\nmodels of contextual effects on individual behaviours.22 This\nis the case because important dimensions of community\nstructure are typically more highly correlated than are\nindividual level variables. The variance inflation factor\n(VIF) of 1.69 that is associated with this correlation,\ncalculated for the 206 census tracts, was well below the\nthreshold (VIF = 10) that would indicate a problem of\nmulticollinearity in multivariate regression models.23 That\nis, there is sufficient independent variation of neighbourhood\npoverty and percentage Mexican American to investigate\nboth effects as distinct characteristics of neighbourhood\ncontext.\nTable 2 Regression models predicting continuous CES-D scores by percentage Mexican American and neighbourhood poverty adjusting for relevant risk factors (n = 2710)\nBaseline Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nCensus tract variables\nIndividual variables\nSchooling (0\u00ad6 years)\nPer capita income relative to county\nmedian\nNeighbourhood composition and depression 989\nwww.jech.com\nDepressive symptoms\nDepressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D\nscale.24 The CES-D consisted of 20 items where subjects are\nasked whether they have experienced certain feelings or\nsymptoms in the past week. Responses were scored on a four\npoint scale (0 to 3). Scores for the CES-D ranged from 0 to 60\nwhere higher scores indicated increased depressive sympto-\nmatology. In the analysis, the CES-D scale was used both as a\ncontinuous and a categorical variable (0\u00ad15 and >16).\nSubjects with a score of 16 or more were classified as having\nhigh depressive symptomatology.24\nStatistical analysis\nUsing descriptive statistics, sociodemographic and health\nfactors were examined for all subjects on mean CES-D score\nat the baseline assessment interview. Bivariate regression\nstatistics were used to test the strength of the association\nbetween neighbourhood percentage Mexican American and\nneighbourhood poverty. To perform this analysis, we capita-\nlised on the fact that the primary sampling units (PSUs) for\nthe H-EPESE sample design were a random sample of census\ntracts in the five south western states. Census tracts have\nbeen found to be a useful approximation for neighbourhood\nenvironments in numerous studies of contextual influences\non social behaviour and health.25\u00ad27 Thus we estimated two\nlevel random intercept linear regression models, using HLM\nsoftware distributed by Scientific Software International. The\nsecond level in this analysis, neighbourhood, are the census\ntracts that are the primary sampling units for the study. We\nregress depressive symptoms on neighbourhood tract percen-\ntage Mexican American and neighbourhood poverty, adjust-\ning for age, gender, marital status, Mexico (compared with\nUS) birth, a number of medical conditions, and ADL\nlimitations. We tested additional cross level interactions\nbetween neighbourhood characteristics and individual char-\nacteristics including age, gender, neighbourhood poverty,\nmedical condition, and ADLs using random slopes models.\nNo significant interactions were identified and these models\nare not reported. The linear regression analyses were\nweighted using post-stratification weights so that the results\nare representative of the older Mexican American population\nof the south western states.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents mean CES-D scores for neighbourhood and\nindividual level data. Community level data are presented by\nthe percentage of a neighbourhood population that was\nMexican American and also the percentage of a neighbour-\nhood that was living in poverty. There was a trend for older\nMexican Americans living in higher density Mexican\nAmerican neighbourhoods to report lower mean CES-D\nscores. No such trend appeared for the association between\ntract percentage poverty and mean CES-D score. The\nintraclass correlation (percentage of variance that occurs\nbetween neighbourhoods) for the CES-D score was 24%. For\nthe individual level data older age, female gender, being\nunmarried, and less formal education was associated with\nhigher mean CES-D scores. Additionally, having a lower per\ncapita household income relative to the county median, being\nborn in Mexico, reporting one or more chronic medical\nconditions or one or more ADL limitations were associated\nwith higher mean CES-D scores.\nTable 2 presents unstandardised b coefficients for the\nprediction of continuous CES-D scores (range 0\u00ad60) by\npercentage Mexican American and percentage neighbour-\nhood poverty, adjusting for relevant individual level factors.\nModel 1 indicates a non-significant association between\npercentage neighbourhood poverty and CES-D score with\nadjustments for age and sex. Similarly, Model 2 indicates a\nnon-significant association between percentage neighbour-\nhood Mexican American and CES-D score. In Model 3 with\nboth percentage neighbourhood poverty and percentage\nMexican American included in the model, older Mexican\nAmericans who reside in the highest percentage Mexican\nAmerican census tracts had a 5.16 point decrease in CES-D\nscore compared with those who live in the lowest percentage\nMexican American census tracts. Mexican Americans who\nlive in the highest percentage neighbourhood poverty areas\nhad a 7.64 point increase in CES-D score compared with\nthose in the lowest percentage neighbourhood poverty census\ntracts. Because the results are linear and additive, another\nway of describing the findings in Model 3 is to say that each\n10% increase in percentage Mexican American was asso-\nciated with a 0.516 point decrease in CES-D score, while each\n10% increase in percentage poverty was associated with a\n0.764 point increase in CES-D score. In the fully adjusted\nmodel results for percentage neighbourhood poverty and\npercentage Mexican American with CES-D score were similar\nto model 3 results.\nFigure 2 shows the association among percentage neigh-\nbourhood poverty and percentage Mexican American with\npercentage of subjects with high (>16) CES-D scores, with\nadjustment for individual level data. The figure indicates a\ngradient of risk for percentage Mexican American and\npercentage neighbourhood poverty on high depressive\nsymptoms (CES-D score >16). Subjects living in the lowest\ndensity Mexican American communities and in lowest\npercentage poverty tracts had the lowest risk of depression.\nAt each level of neighbourhood poverty, neighbourhoods\nwith the highest percentage Mexican American residents had\nthe lowest rates of subjects with high depression scores.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing a population based cohort, our findings indicate that\nhigh density Mexican American communities moderate the\nadverse consequences of poverty on the psychological well-\nbeing of its residents. In an unadjusted analysis no clear\npattern was observed between tract percentage poverty and\ndepressive symptoms, and a weak association was observed\nFigure 2 Predicted high depressive symptoms (CES-D >16) at\nmidpoints of quartiles of tract percentage neighbourhood poverty and\ntract percentage Mexican American. Predictions are derived from a\nhierarchical logistic regression model of high depressive symptoms\n(CES-D >16) using factors from table 2 (model 4), evaluated at the\nmean (age = 71 years, percentage county income = 18%) and mode\n(female, ,12 grades of school, US born, and no medical conditions or\nADL limitations) of individual level data.\n990 Ostir, Eschbach, Markides, et al\nwww.jech.com\nbetween tract percentage Mexican American and depressive\nsymptoms. When both factors were included in the same\nmodel both neighbourhood poverty and neighbourhood\ndensity of Mexican American were significantly associated\nwith the risk of depressive symptoms, in opposite directions.\nFor example, each 10% unit increase in tract percentage\nMexican American was associated with approximately a 0.5\npoint decrease in depressive symptom score as measured by\nthe CES-D.\nAlthough results from previous studies point to a strong\npositive association between community poverty and poor\nhealth,28\u00ad30 our current data indicate that high neighbourhood\nethnic density may buffer the deleterious effect of poverty on\nhealth. Our findings are concordant with, and suggest a\nmechanism that helps to explain, the so called ``Hispanic\nparadox'' that older Mexican Americans have many health\nindicators similar to or better than that of more advantaged\nolder non-Hispanic white people despite clear disadvantages\nin terms of income, health insurance, housing, and educa-\ntion.31\u00ad34 One hypothesis offered to explain this ``Hispanic\nparadox'' is that strong social and family support structures\nbuffer the effects of low social and economic status.35 36 Our\nresults could be seen as further evidence of the importance of\nsocial networks and social cohesiveness at the community\nlevel.\nA shared cultural identity, common language and appear-\nance may contribute to the health of the individual. A recent\ncohort study by Hjern and colleagues37 examined social\nadjustment of intercountry adopted children on mental\nhealth disorders in Sweden. The study found intercountry\nadoptees were three to five times more likely to develop\npsychiatric illnesses than native born people. One explana-\ntion offered was that discrimination and prejudice could be\nhigher for non-Swedish appearance, negatively impacting on\nthe mental health of the person.\nStrongly held community beliefs may also lead to the\nadoption or change of health practices or behaviours.\nHowever, the direction for change can either be positive or\nnegative. For example, at the individual level strong marriage\nand good friendship ties are associated with less smoking and\nalcohol intake, better nutrition, and more cancer screening,\nwhile less successful marriages or friendships are associated\nwith an increase risk for poor health behaviours.38 Lower\nrates of smoking and drinking and drug use are reported for\nMexican Americans, particularly among immigrants and\nA unique characteristic of many high density Mexican\nAmerican communities is that they are stable environments\nwhere labour force participation, intact family structures,\nhome ownership, and residential stability are all compara-\ntively high.16\u00ad18 Ross has suggested that the association\nbetween neighbourhood poverty and depression is mediated\nby increased social disorder.28 That is, in many high poverty\nneighbourhoods a resident's daily experiences are more likely\nto include exposure to crime, vandalism, noise pollution, and\novercrowding than in more advantaged neighbourhoods. If\nRoss is correct, then the negative effects of neighbourhood\npoverty on mental health may be attenuated where material\ndisadvantage is not accompanied by a high degree of social\ndisorganisation. Immigrant and ethnic enclaves present\nexamples of community contexts where concentrated eco-\nnomic disadvantage is frequently not accompanied by other\nsocial pathologies because of the offsetting buffering effects\nof high levels of group cohesion.\nInterpretation of our findings should take into account\nseveral considerations. It is possible that older Mexican\nAmericans from high density Mexican American neighbour-\nhoods may be more likely to migrate to Mexico in response to\nill health including high depressive symptoms. However,\nfollow up data on this cohort suggest that few older Mexican\nAmericans return to Mexico. The associations reported are\ncross sectional rather than longitudinal and reflect differ-\nential degrees of exposure to community environments.\nHowever, older Mexican Americans experience a high degree\nof residential stability. The median length of residence at\ncurrent address at the time of the survey was 22 years.\nFinally, no direct measure of social support variable was\nincluded in the analysis. Theoretical considerations suggest\nthat high levels of social support associated with high levels\nof tract percentage Mexican American may explain the lower\ndepressive symptoms associated with variables. However, this\nhypothesis was not directly tested in this study. The\nimportance of our findings is based on the following\nstrengths of the investigation. We collected information from\na large well defined sample, which is generalisable to 500 000\nMexican Americans living in the south western United\nStates.19 The reliability and consistency of the data collection\nprocedures in the Hispanic EPESE investigation are well\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest the need for careful\nexamination of neighbourhood effects on health. This\nexamination should go beyond negative community factors\nand include positive factors such as local resources and social\ncohesiveness and neighbourhood composition.\nAuthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nG V Ostir, K Eschbach, K S Markides, J S Goodwin, Sealy Center on\nAging, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, USA\nG V Ostir, J S Goodwin, Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine,\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston\nK Eschbach, Department of Sociology and Center for Immigration\nResearch, University of Houston, USA\nG V Ostir, K S Markides, J S Goodwin, Department of Preventive\nMedicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch at\nGalveston\nFunding: this research was supported by National Institute on Aging\ngrant AG-10939.
