    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe analyzed the discussions of Japanese municipalities in their process for obtaining certifications for the Geoparks by\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Man and the Biosphere Programme\n(MAB) by the UNESCO, and the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage systems (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO) of the United Nations. The official records at the municipality diet were analyzed in a quantitative\nmanner from 2011 to 2013. As the first step, we analyzed the eight municipalities of Noto and Sado for the GIAHS, the cities\nItoigawa and Hakusan for the Geopark, and Katsuyama Yamanouchi village from Nagano for the MAB. As individual examples,\nwe analyzed City of Suzu with GIAHS, Itoigawa (Geopark), and Yamanouchi town (MAB) with the text-mining approach. For\nthe GIAHS, it was clear that the larger municipalities with city status tended to discuss certification issues more frequently\nthan the smaller towns and villages. Terms such as conservation and certification tended to be used with GIAHS at the Suzu\nCity. The term brand was used with GIAHS and MAB but not for the Geopark. The findings using quantitative methods are\nat initial stage for analysis of municipality strategies and require further future research.\n",
