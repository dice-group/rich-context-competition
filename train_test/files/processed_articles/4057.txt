Thus, this study validates the premise of U.S. policy as it confirms the challenges faced by\ninternational broadcasting 70 years ago and today--the role key cultural indicators play when these viewers decide to turn\nto or away from Alhurra for news and other information.

The broad question is difficult to answer,\nespecially during times of regional conflict, when the United\nStates seeks to maintain friendly relationships with countries\nsuch as the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and limit damage\nin other countries more hostile to the United States, such as\nIraq. The question also assumes that people can be influ-\nenced and are capable of seeing various sides of an issue. It\nalso very clearly ignores the role that culture plays in any\ntype of conflict and the difficulties that emerge when the val-\nues of one culture clash with the values of another. Social\nidentity theory may help explain the impact of cultural dif-\nferences in such conflict situations, as people in the Middle\nEast strongly identify with their culture. Social identity the-\nory posits that identification with a group or culture often\nincludes a favorable bias toward one's own group and rejec-\nOver the years, the media, in various forms, have played\na pivotal role, often in times of conflict, in the attempt by the\nU.S. government to win the hearts and minds of those \"for-\neign peoples\" and to shape public opinion to support foreign\npolicy. This rationale led to the development of Alhurra\nTelevision, a satellite network designed to reach countries\nthroughout the Middle East with news and information from\na U.S. government perspective. Alhurra is an Arabic term for\n\"The Free One\" and offers news discussion programs, current\naffairs, and a variety of feature programming. Alhurra is\nintended to \"give its audience insights into life inAmerica and\nUsing social identity as a basis for understanding the role\nmedia play in this international communication environ-\nment, this current research adds to the limited academic dis-\ncourse on Alhurra and seeks to shed some light on whom\nAlhurra is reaching, specifically by developing a model that\npredicts cultural attributes of viewers and nonviewers. The\nchallenges faced at the beginning of U.S. international\nbroadcasting efforts were much the same as those faced by\nentities like Alhurra today.

Some nations completely\nblock U.S. broadcasting efforts by jamming our radio\nbroadcasts, satellite TV or Internet programming,\nwhile others imprison, torture, or kill both local and\ninternational journalists. (Committee on Foreign\nThe technical and programmatic problems faced by U.S.\ninternational broadcasters are not new. To put these issues\ninto perspective, it is important to look back at the founding\nof U.S. international broadcasting.\nU.S. government efforts to reach audiences through\ninternational broadcasting began with George Creel and the\nCommittee on Public Information. His committee used\nvarious propaganda techniques to influence countries\naround the world and was followed in World War II by the\nOffice of War Information (OWI). From its creation as a\ntool of public diplomacy, the OWI's mission was\nundermining morale in enemy countries; keeping alive\nthe hope of liberation in enemy occupied territories;\nwinning the moral support of people in neutral coun-\ntries; and countering enemy propaganda, promoting\nmorale, and fostering better understanding of the\nIn looking back on that time, Senator Richard Lugar\nnotes,\n[The U.S.] has always addressed two audiences. One\naudience views the United States positively, as a\ndemocracy based on the free flow of information, the\nfreedom of expression, civic discourse and active\ncitizen participation in government. This group will\nmore often than not be supportive of U.S. actions and\ninitiatives, or at least give us the benefit of the doubt.\nMembers of the second group believe that these\nstrengths are, instead, weaknesses and are predis-\nposed to assume the worst about America; they\nreject--or worse, attack--us as a result. Successful\nPublic Diplomacy (PD) keeps the first group engaged\nand increases its numbers while reducing the size and\nimpact of the second. (Committee on Foreign\nReaching two diverse audiences is a challenge. In particu-\nlar, reaching the second category of audience described by\nSenator Lugar--those who think the worst about America--\ncould be described as being hostile to American sources of\nnews information. The OWI used a simple philosophy to\nundergird its efforts to reach people overseas: \"that simple\ntruth, offered in a friendly spirit, is the best of all possible\nOperating under that philosophy, the OWI began produc-\ning radio programs in January 1942, when the Office of the\nCoordinator of Information produced its first broadcasts for\nretransmission in London over the British Broadcasting\nCorporation (BBC). Although it started later than other\ncountries (the Netherlands, Russia, and Britain, for exam-\nple, had been broadcasting for almost 20 years), the United\nStates started to catch up quickly. On February 1, 1942,\nseven programs were produced each week, but a year later\nWithin a year of starting operations, OWI was transmitting\n\"from the United States continuously--twenty-four hours a\nday to Europe and Africa alone--programs in twenty-four\ndifferent languages, over twenty-one short wave transmit-\ndisseminated to literally every country of the world,\nsave the Americas, more than two million words and\ntheir way into more than 3,500 publications and\nspread their message through uncounted leaflets,\nthrough radio broadcasts abroad, and through numer-\nThe primary radio service used by OWI was Voice of\nAmerica, which began in February 1942. Although the\nUnited States had led the world in radio broadcasting, this\nwas its first effort at government-sponsored international\nbroadcasting.\nLeonard Carlton (1943), chief of the program preparation\ndivision of the Overseas Operation Branch of the OWI rec-\nognized that understanding what international audiences\nneeded and wanted was a learning process for the fledgling\nbroadcaster. He said,\nWe have had to recognize the fact that in our most\nimportant audiences the great hunger is for very hard,\nfactual news. Even our best friends in occupied lands\ndistrust \"propaganda,\" and many of them have made\nknown that distrust to us quite clearly. They want\ninformation, hard news--the true account of what is\ngoing on, even when the news is unpleasant. American\nshort wave radio, therefore, insists upon truth in its\nnews as well as in the commentaries which are based\nupon the news. Such bitter pills as Pearl Harbor have\nOne of the main program series used by the OWI to pres-\nent information about the United States was called\n\"Answering You.\" For this program, the BBC would supply\nquestions provided by a variety of Englishmen on all aspects\nof American life and culture, which would then be answered\nby various well-known Americans such as Clifton Fadiman,\nGeorge Gallup, Henry Kaiser, John Gunther, Geoffrey\nParsons, Publisher W. W. Waymack of the Des Moines\nRegister & Tribune, Carl Van Doren, Eleanor Roosevelt,\nMargaret Mead, and Dorothy Kenyon. The series was\nClark and Christie 3\nbroadcast over the BBC in Britain \"at a peak hour [and] . . .\nan audience report show[ed] that 12.1 per cent of the English\nadult civilian population listened\" (Carlton, 1943, p. 52). A\nsimilar series of programs was started in February for the\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, and a similar series\nwas also started in Arabic.\nOther types of programming featured music and also tes-\ntimonies from immigrants in the United States directed at\ntheir former country. For example,\nTo Arabic countries, Outpost sends records of their\ncountrymen in America. Interviews with students of\nTurkish nationality in America, women's programs,\nand Hollywood interviews are sent to Turkey. To\nSweden the Outpost Division sends messages from\nSwedish Americans, and a weekly report from\nUsing individuals from different cultures in this way was\nan attempt to bridge the wide cultural gap that the United\nStates faced. It also understood that to reach an out-group, it\nwas important to not only broadcast in a way that appealed to\nthem but also use technology that was accessible and famil-\niar to them.\nThe OWI explored many different ways in which to\n\"transmit\" its programming. The first was the development\nof shortwave transmissions through Voice of America.\nHowever, the OWI also used what it termed \"relay broad-\ncasting\" where a shortwave signal was picked up and\nrebroadcast via medium wave (MW) by stations all over\nthe world. Finally, the OWI also prerecorded programs and\nthen sent those programs to MW stations in \"allied and neu-\nbroadcasts included English, Persian, Turkish, Afrikaans,\nArabic, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Swedish,\nWhat the Overseas Radio Bureau of the OWI found effec-\ntive was that through rebroadcasting it was able to \"reach\nlarge audiences listening on their own small radio sets to\nAs Carlton (1943) noted, through the broadcasts,\nFriendly and neutral nations can be told about the\nAmerican people and their institutions, their music and\ntheir general attitude on the war and the post-war\nworld. These programs, because they are our radio\nambassadors to so many people, are produced accord-\ning to the best standards of American radio. Because\nthey are not subject to the mechanical limitations\nimposed by short wave radio (fading, atmospherics,\nand jamming), Outpost programs can be more subtle\nand can use emotional techniques which are of limited\nusefulness in other phases of international radio. (p. 53)\nFinally, to broadcast to a foreign audience via shortwave,\nthe OWI and Voice of America encountered issues that the\naverage domestic station did not have to deal with. As\nAmerican domestic radio had never been called upon\nto face such problems as how to get a short wave mes-\nsage through atmospheric disturbances or through\ndeliberate enemy jamming. Certain voices excellent\non regular domestic radio were found quite unusable\nin international broadcasting. Problems of speaking\nspeed, of the use of music, of humor, and of sound\neffects had to be solved. Faced with the urgency of\nwar, the United States has had to solve these problems\nand build a world-wide radio service with great rapid-\nity. It has had to build under many difficulties and with\nlittle previous experience in the field. It stood its first\ngreat test on November 7. There will be other tests in\nthe future, and for these tests it is gathering its\nresources in technical facilities, sense of direction, and\nToday, shortwave broadcasting in the United States\nappears to be on its way out.As part of its Financial Year (FY)\n2011 budget submission, the Broadcasting Board of\nGovernors (BBG) proposed to close the last U.S.-based short-\nwave broadcasting facility, estimating that US$3.2 million\ncan be saved by the closure. This proposal to severely curtail\nshortwave broadcasts is causing concern, particularly as there\nare many people in the world who still use shortwave, and as\ncountries such as China continue and even increase their\nshortwave operations as the United States draws down\nThe challenges faced by early government broadcasting\npolicy makers have changed little in the past 70 years; how-\never, the means to reach the audiences have changed. Instead\nof using shortwave as the primary broadcast tool, the U.S.\ninternational broadcasting services are focusing on the\nInternet, terrestrial broadcasting, and satellite television.\nBut, as early government radio officials realized, the critical\nimportance of identifying with the audience to provide cred-\nible news and information has not changed, and the raison\nd'\u00eatre and the programming content is very similar today as\nTargeting the Middle East\nEast became a renewed priority for U.S. broadcasting\nefforts. The latest effort by the United States to use televi-\nsion to reach audiences in the Middle East is Alhurra.\nAlhurra is an Arabic-language television network launched\nthe Middle East using the same satellites that regional\nArabic stations use (Blaya, 2007). The network is operated\nby The Middle East Television Network, financed by the\nAmerican government through a grant from the BBG, a U.S.\nfederal agency that oversees U.S. international broadcasting\n4 SAGE Open\nefforts (About Us, 2005). Alhurra is expensive to operate\nwith a budget of about US$90 million (Committee on\nForeign Relations, 2010). According to Gary Ackerman\n(2007), chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the\nMiddle East and Asia, Alhurra was,\nCreated . . . as an alternative with a purpose, with a\nmotive, not to distort journalism, not to lie, not to\nchange the truth, not to deny real facts, but to present\na view that was prevented from being presented on\nmost of the existing media . . . It was not created just\nso that we could present both sides of the issue. We are\nthe other side of the issue, or that is what I believe the\nCongress thought at the time of establishing this. (p.\nThe station covers U.S. elections, with coverage of candi-\ndates and issues, and it has reporters who cover the White\nHouse, Congress, State Department, and the Pentagon. In\naddition, Alhurra offers current affairs programs and docu-\nmentaries that show U.S. life. For example, Inside\nWashington takes viewers behind the scenes of the political\nprocess in Washington with guests such as Supreme Court\nJustices and various politicians. The station also produces a\ndocumentary series on American culture and values,\nAmericans, and another current affairs program, Equality.\nJoaquin Blaya (2007) noted that Equality is\nhosted by a Saudi journalist, [and] discusses the rights\nof women and tackles subjects such as young girls\nbeing forced into marriage, the right of women to\ndrive and the rights of women in Islam. There has been\nremarkable feedback on this program and others, some\npraising the courageousness of this program and oth-\ners condemning Alhurra for discussing these topics.\nIn March 2009, Alhurra began airing a brand new show\ncalled Al Youm (Arabic for \"Today\"). The show is based on\nthe NBC Today Show and is a live three-hour news show,\nproduced Sunday through Thursday. Al Youm broadcasts\nfrom a studio in Dubai, and \"seeks to present the news in a\nmore relaxed, conversational environment\" (Committee on\nForeign Relations, 2010, p. 39). Journalists on the show are\nbased in five cities: Cairo, Beirut, Jerusalem, Dubai, and\nWashington, D.C., \"from where they are projected onto a\nscreen in the Dubai studio to interact with the hosts\"\nTo assess audience reception to Al Youm's 2009 launch,\nDr. Nancy Snow of Syracuse University examined sample\nmedia coverage of the program provided by the Middle East\nBroadcasting Networks (MBN; Snow, 2010). Snow also\nconducted an independent survey of online news\nstories about \"Al Youm\" in its first ten months of\noperation [and found the] response has been over-\nwhelming positive and a marked contrast to the nega-\ntive coverage that had dominated the media landscape\nAccording to Snow, there are a number of things that\nmake this program appealing to viewers in the Middle East.\nSnow (2010) reported that Al Youm uses \"a hybrid style of\nnews programming that offers breaking news, soft news,\nfinance, education, science, and other topical subjects that\nappeal to the region\" (p. 10). She also calls the program\n\"groundbreaking\" (p. 11) because \"Never in the history of\ntelevision news has a live program originated from five\nbureaus (Beirut, Cairo, Dubai, Jerusalem, Washington, D.C.)\nacross three continents\" (Snow, 2010, p. 11). Finally she says\nthe show features well-known anchors and reporters, and the\nprogramming has high production values (Snow, 2010).\nAccording to a model posited by Clark and Christie (2004),\nAlhurra and its programs such as Al Youm can be classified as\nfacilitative communication; that is, it serves to create a friendly\natmosphere and place the host country in the best possible\nlight. Martin (cited in Fisher & Merrill, 1976) believes gov-\nernments do not spend the most money on propaganda but on\n\"facilitative communication\" (p. 263) where the primary func-\ntion is to create \"a friendly atmosphere, or, as a psychologist\nmight put it, a favorable affect\" (p. 263). Such programming\nincludes newscasts, press releases, and artistic and cultural\nprograms. However, as of late it appears that the audience for\nAlhurra has dwindled (polling has not been conducted to\nassess the success of Al Youm). A recent government report\nstates that Alhurra is watched in Iraq but not really anywhere\nelse. The report states that \"given the crowded media environ-\nment of the Middle East, either greater resources must be\ndevoted to marketing and promotion or additional program-\nming changes must be enacted in pursuit of increasing the\nchannel's market share\" (Committee on Foreign Relations,\nAlhurra Reviews\nIn 2008, two universities and the U.S. Department of State\nand the BBG Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted\nreviews of Alhurra's programming, operation, and journal-\nistic practices. The University of Southern California\nreport, \"An Evaluation of Alhurra Television Programming\"\n(2008), found that there was \"A lack of news and topical\nprogramming tailored to the interests of the Arab audience\"\n(p. 4). By this, the researchers felt that Alhurra was per-\nceived as being similar to state-funded broadcasters and had\ndone little to create a unique brand, differentiating itself in\n\"style, format and breadth of coverage\" (p. 4) to attract a\nlarge audience.\nIn terms of journalistic practice, the study cited \"weak jour-\nnalism\" (An Evaluation of Alhurra Television Programming,\nClark and Christie 5\nthe product was not as good as that of its competitors, and the\nstories lacked balance and attribution. The study noted that\nWhenAlhurra was critical of a particular view of issues,\nit was six times more likely to be critical of the Arab/\nother perspective than theWestern viewpoint. Moreover,\nit was twice as likely to praise the Western outlook\nrather than the Arab/other perspective. (An Evaluation\nWhen personal opinions were expressed, they were more\nlikely to favor the West, particularly when the topics were\nIsraeli\u00adArab relations and Arab human rights.\nThe University of Southern California report stated that\nAlhurra's programming was likely to be seen as propaganda\nwhen compared with its competitors because its coverage\nwas not evenhanded. This was also observed in its reporters'\nreliance on official sources instead of independent voices or\nthose of the average Arabic citizen.\nKent Collins (2008) from the University of Missouri con-\nducted a thorough review of Alhurra stories and newscasts\nfor a study titled, \"Alhurra Television Focus Group Research\nProject.\" The study found that \"despite recent criticism in the\nAmerican media and politically biased criticism in the\nMiddle East, Alhurra Television does most things right most\nof the time\" (Collins, 2008, p. 3). The Missouri study noted\nthat development of Alhurra was without parallel in\nAmerican television history. The station was established\nvery quickly, and now more attention needs to be paid to\ncontent and journalistic practices. As the study notes,\nJournalism everywhere is subject to criticism and\nsecond-guessing and political influence. Compare the\ncurrent critique of the American media in the coverage\nof the domestic presidential campaign to the more\ncomplicated political, ethnic, religious and nationalis-\ntic environment in which Alhurra operates. (Collins,\nIn May 2008, the U.S. Department of State and the BBG\nOIG released a Report of Inspection on Alhurra's\nProgramming Policies and Procedures (2008). The report\nwas in response to a request by the House Committee on\nAppropriations. According to the OIG report (2008),\nCongress's concern dates back to at least December\n2006, when certain programs were aired on Alhurra\nthat did not appear to some to follow the editorial\nprinciples stated in the U.S. International Broadcasting\nAct of 1994. Specifically, the House Report asked for\na review of the editorial policy in place in 2006 and\n2007 regarding broadcasts involving terrorists or those\nwho support them; whether any changes were made to\nthat policy or the Alhurra's journalistic code during the\nperiod; who was responsible for enforcing the policy;\nwhat action, if any, was taken against those who vio-\nlated the policy; what management changes have been\nmade to ensure the policy and journalistic code is\nmonitored and enforced; and whether there are clear\nlines of authority at Alhurra to provide for account-\nability of journalistic decisions. (p. 4)\nThe OIG report noted that \"MBN during the past\nyear has put into place more vigorous policies, procedures,\ntraining, and tools for transparency in order to preserve its\ncredibility\" (p. 13). Credibility is critical to such an interna-\ntional broadcasting operation. If it is not deemed credible by\nits audience, the station will not achieve its foreign policy\nThe relationship between media ownership and news\nproduct integrity is a global issue, whether it involves\nthe Emir of Qatar and Al Jazeera or the U.S. govern-\nment and Alhurra . . . In the Middle East, where trust\nis a limited commodity, the issue is particularly sig-\nnificant for any news organization trying to enter or\nexpand in the market. (p. 32)\nTherefore, in the case of Alhurra, it is important to under-\nstand the influence of such broadcasting efforts and to be\nable to predict who might watch Alhurra's programming.\nThe \"injection\" of a government's message is not automatic\nor assured--a government's efforts to change hearts and\nminds starts with an understanding of the nature of the audi-\nence. Although studies have determined the basic nature of\nAlhurra use, there have been no studies integrating the cul-\nture of the viewers, and no studies have attempted to ana-\nlyze those audience characteristics that predict either\nviewing or nonviewing. Instead, studies have focused on\nestimating audience size or basic credibility. In discussing\nthe need for a greater depth of research in this area, U.S.\nTo be sure, Radio Sawa, Alhurra, Radio Farda, and\nVOA's Persian and Urdu language television play\ncrucial roles in providing news and information to\naudiences in ways they would not otherwise see or\nhear it . . . Simply measuring audience size is great,\nbut it does not tell us how much or whether our broad-\ncasting influences those who receive it. I have heard,\nanecdotally, that Radio Sawa is very popular among\nits target audience in the Arab world, but I have also\nheard that those who listen to it turn it off when the\nnews comes on because they know it is an American\nbroadcast. If that is true, how does that help us? (p. 2)\nDabbous and Nasser (2009) conducted a survey of how\nAlhurra was perceived by Lebanese university students.\nThey found that Lebanese students tended to watch Al\nJazeera and Al Arabiya much more than Alhurra. They found\n6 SAGE Open\nthat the number of hours a student spent watching Alhurra is\nnot a predictor of the student's positive attitude toward the\nUnited States. Those who knew that the station was spon-\nsored by the United States viewed it as less credible than\nthose who were unaware of its affiliation with the United\nStates.\nDouai (2010) conducted focus groups in Morocco, and\nwhen the topic of Alhurra was raised found that \"no [partici-\npant] was able to isolate Alhurra from the United States, and\nno [participant] was able to isolate the credibility of the sta-\ntion from the credibility of the United States\" (p. 86).\nTo place this study in context, it is important to under-\nstand a little more about the U.A.E., including demographic\ninformation, its relationship with the United States, and the\nmedia climate in the country.\nReaching the U.A.E.Through Cultural Understanding\nThe U.A.E. is one of the few countries in the Middle East\nthat maintains close ties with the United States and has\nactively assisted the United States in its attempts to fight\nterrorism. The U.A.E. has been an important target of the\nU.S. government in its attempt to provide its perspective on\nnews and information in the Middle East (BBG in the News,\n2004). The United States was the third country to establish\nformal diplomatic relations with the U.A.E. and has had an\nUnited States and the U.A.E. started a dialogue on virtually\nevery aspect of the bilateral relationship. In 2004, the U.A.E.\nsigned a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement\n(TIFA) with the United States and agreed to negotiate\ntoward a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United\nStates (U.S. Department of State, 2007). The U.A.E. is a key\npartner with the United States in the War on Terror. The\nU.A.E. ports host more U.S. navy ships than any port outside\nthe United States (U.S. Department of State, 2007).\nThe U.A.E. is a Middle Eastern federation of seven states\nlocated in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering\nthe Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The capital city is Abu Dhabi.\nThe U.A.E. has one of the most diverse populations in the\nMiddle East. Of the 4.45 million people living in the country,\nEmiratis, the national ethnic group, accounts only for 19%.\nOther significant ethnic groups are other Arab and Iranian\n(23%), South Asian (50%), and Westerners and East Asians\nU.A.E.'s gender imbalance is the highest in the world\nwith a ratio of 2.19 males to females. Almost 79% of the\nU.A.E.'s population is between the ages of 15 and 64, with\nthe total median age being 30.1 years (32 years for males and\n24.5 years for females). Almost 88% of the population lives\nin urban areas with the most populated city being Dubai,\nwith approximately 1.5 million people. The official language\nis Arabic, although the other widely used languages include\nPersian, English, Hindi, and Urdu. About 96% of U.A.E.\ncitizens are Muslim with 4% being Hindu or Christian (CIA,\nCharacteristics of U.A.E. Media\nThe 2007 Freedom of the Press report, published by the\nFreedom House, suggests the mass media in the U.A.E. are\nnot free (Freedom House, 2007). Formally, the constitution\nguarantees freedom of the press. However, journalists\noften practice self-censorship because of laws that prohibit\ncriticism of the government, ruling families, and friendly\ngovernments, and outlaw other statements considered a\nthreat to social or economic stability. All publications must\nbe licensed with the Ministry of Information (Freedom\nThe media industry in the U.A.E. is developed through a\nnumber of microcities, for example, Dubai Media City\n(www.dubaimediacity.com). Dubai Media City is a tax-free\nzone within Dubai and is designed to be the media hub of the\nregion. It encompasses both the creation of media and the\nadvertising and marketing industry. Numerous international\nnews organizations, such as Reuters, Associated Press,\nFrance Press, Bloomberg, Dow Jones Newswires, CNN, and\nthe BBC, have local offices in Dubai Media City.\nAlternatives to mainstream media in the U.A.E. are lim-\nited as the U.A.E. uses filtering software to block sites with\nwhat it deems to be objectionable Internet content. These\ninclude pornography, gambling, religious conversion, and\nillegal drugs sites. The state also blocks access to all sites in\nthe Israeli top-level domain (OpenNet Initiative, 2006).\nUnderstanding the media climate in the U.A.E. is impor-\ntant because if audiences within the U.A.E. perceive media\nsources from within their country to be not objective or not\ncredible, then they will look to outside alternatives for their\nsource of news and information. Conversely, audiences may\nbe happy with what they receive from the local media but\nstill be interested in what other sources have to say about\nissues around the region and the world.\nSocial identity theory may explain the use of international\nmedia in a culture markedly different from the United States.\nFor example, given the unpopularity of the U.S. involvement\nin Iraq throughout the Middle East, the Middle East popula-\ntions may feel a strong identification within their countries.\nAccording to Social identity theory, identification with a\ngroup often includes a favorable bias toward one's own\ngroup, and out-group rejection and even discrimination\ntoward the other group (Tajfel, 1978). This is increasingly\nlikely to be true when a group is very important to its mem-\nbers and when they perceive conflict with the out-group\n(Brown, 1996). Thus, due to the nature of the conflict\nbetween the United States and Iraq and other parts of the\nMiddle East, people from the Middle East may identify\nstrongly with themselves and tend to discount the ideas and\nbeliefs of the United States presented on a television network\nin their country. This identification could be followed with a\nClark and Christie 7\ncomparison with other groups on the basis of a value dimen-\nsion. Tajfel and Turner (1985) noted that classification in\nsocial identity theory is revealed though several social cate-\ngories including religion, gender, and age.\nThus, in our attempt to understand the audiences and pro-\nfile factors in viewing or not viewingAlhurra Television, key\nvariables related to these attitudinal, cultural, and media use\ncharacteristics were selected for examination, in an effort to\nanswer the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent, if any, do basic\naudience characteristics such as age, gender, edu-\ncation, and employment of the population in the\nU.A.E. predict Alhurra Television viewing/non-\nviewing?\nResearch Question 2: To what extent, if any, does gen-\neral media use predict Alhurra Television viewing/\nnonviewing?\nResearch Question 3: Do assessments of favorable\nattitudes toward the United States by audiences (as\nan out-group) predict Alhurra Television viewing/\nnonviewing?\nEven though these audience variables alone do not define an\nin-group's culture, they are indicators of patterns, behaviors,\nand values needed to gain an understanding of the audience\nsought by U.S. international broadcasting efforts. In addi-\ntion, if these indicators were found to be actual predictors of\nviewing the U.S. broadcasting outlets, the finding could\neither validate or negate the premise of U.S. international\nbroadcasting policy that has existed for more than 70 years.\nMethod\nSuch audience characteristics can best be observed through\nsurveying members of the target audience. Therefore, data\nfor this study were drawn from a July-August 2007 survey\nexploring the audiences of Alhurra Television and Radio\nSawa in the U.A.E. The survey was conducted by the Pan\nArab Research Center of Dubai, U.A.E. The sample was\ndesigned to be nationally representative of the 15- to\nThis age group was identified as an important and influ-\nential group for the U.S. government to target in their efforts\nthat, while Alhurra Television reaches all age groups, the\nyounger Arab population is a particular concern to the U.S.\ngovernment because of unemployment and disaffection,\nhaving \"few opportunities for social mobility and progress.\nThey are ripe for exploitation by radical Islamic fundamen-\ntalist ideology and elements of Arab media that seek to incite\nthem. Reaching them is key\" (p. 76).After drawing a random\nsample of the U.A.E. among Arabic respondents aged 15 to\n34 years, face-to-face interviews with respondents at their\nplaces of residence were used to complete questionnaires\ntranslated into the Arabic language.\nTo examine the effects of viewing Alhurra Television, it\nwas necessary to identify two basic groups of individuals--\nthose who viewed this source of information and those who\ndid not. The dependent variable used to answer research\nquestions ascertained the use or nonuse of Alhurra\nTelevision. Respondents were asked, \"Could you please\ntell me if you watch Alhurra Television?\" The two groups\nof viewers and nonviewers were derived from this response.\nThus, the two groups of viewers and nonviewers comprised\nthe dichotomous categories of the dependent variable in\nthis study.\nIndependent variables used to predict either viewing or not\nviewing Alhurra Television included demographic variables\nof gender, media use, age, education, and employment status.\nIn addition to these variables, the possible influence of two\nother variables was explored: use of Radio Sawa and attitudes\ntoward the United States. The Radio Sawa variable was\nworded, \"Do you listen to Radio Sawa?\" with a value of \"1\"\nassigned for listening and a value of \"0\" for nonlistening. The\n\"attitude toward the U.S.\" variable was worded, \"How favor-\nably do you feel about the U.S.A.?\" A 1- to 10-point semantic\ndifferential scale was provided for response to this question,\nwith a higher score indicating an unfavorable attitude.\nTo prepare the data for the statistical method selected for\nanalysis, responses to most demographic questions were\nrecoded as dummy variables, with values of 1 assigned to a\npositive response, and negative responses to the questions\nwere coded with a 0. The education variable contained inter-\nval-level categories, with the lowest of four values (1) assigned\nto less than a high school education and the highest value (4)\nassigned to a postgraduate education. The age variable was\ncoded by 4-year categories of the reported years of age.\nResults\nThe results are based on face-to-face survey interviews of a\nrandom U.A.E. nationwide sample of 503 adults between\nrepresent a somewhat higher proportion of females than\nwhat is found in the general population among this age\ngroup.\nMarried respondents were 43.7% of the sample, and\n56.3% reported being single. The largest group of respon-\nfollowed by Egyptian (11.5%), Jordanian (8.7%), Sudanese\n(8.5%), and Palestinian (7.6%) respondents. The remaining\nnationalities included in the survey were Lebanese, Syrian,\nYemeni, and those from other Arabic countries.\nA relatively high degree of media usage was found\namong respondents. When asked if they listen to radio, for\nand 14.1% (n = 71) said they do not listen to radio. Almost\na half of respondents (48.1%) who listen to radio reported\nlistening daily.\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

About two thirds (60.2%) of respondents\nreplied positively, and 39.8% said they do not listen to Radio\nSawa. These listeners were asked how much time on average\nare they listening to Radio Sawa. Almost one third (31.5%)\nSawa 1 to 2 times a week or less often, respectively.\nrespondents answered positively and 1.4% (n = 7) did not\nwatch television. Among respondents who watch TV, 86.9%\nwatch TV daily, 4.6% suggested they watch TV 5 to 6 times\nwatch TV 1 to 2 times a week or less often.\nRespondents who watch TV daily or 5 to 6 times a week\nHalf of respondents (50.7%) replied positively and the other\nhalf (49.3%) said they do not watch Alhurra Television.\nRespondents watching Alhurra Television (n = 230) include\nweek, 23% who watch it 3 to 4 times a week. The remaining\nviewers--almost half of the group--watch Alhurra\nTelevision 1 to 2 times a week or less often.\nWhen asked about the reasons for not watching Alhurra\nTelevision, respondents mentioned the following rationale:\n(a) prefer to watch other channels like Al Jazeera and Al\nArabia because they are more credible (33.5%), (b) do not\ncare about watching news (15.2%), (c) Alhurra is not a trust-\n(e) never heard about it (8%), (f) no entertaining programs\n(3.1%), (g) there are lots of channels to watch (3.1), and (8)\nRespondents who did not report watching Alhurra\nTelevision (n = 224) were asked to indicate where they get\ntheir television news. Two thirds of the respondents men-\ntioned Al Jazeera, and more than half of the respondents\n(54.9%) also mentioned Al Arabiya. Other TV sources that\nwere mentioned were Al Ekhbariya (5%), Al Manar (4.1%),\nDubai Sports (0.2%).\nIn responding to all three research questions, a discrimi-\nnant function analysis was used to determine the extent that\nbasic audience characteristics such as age, gender, educa-\ntion, and employment of the population in the U.A.E.; media\nlistening habits; and attitudes toward the United States\npredicted Alhurra Television viewing/nonviewing. The test\nwas conducted to investigate the importance and association\nof a set of predictor variables--gender, media use, age, edu-\ncation, employment status, Radio Sawa listening, and atti-\ntudes toward the United States--to discern Alhurra viewing\n(or nonviewing) using these variables. This test was best\nsuited to answer the research questions in this study because\nof the previously cited work that identified these two groups\nof interest to researchers and because of the test's ability to\npredict group membership (viewing or not viewing) from a\nlinear combination of variables. Discriminant function\n\"uses mathematical techniques to determine the way of\ncomputing scores that results in the best separation among\npotential predicting variables, the test can best determine\nthe set of viewer and nonviewer characteristics within those\nvariables. More commonly used statistical tests, such as\nmultiple regression, were not appropriate for this study\nbecause of the ordinal nature of the dependent variable--in\nthis case, viewing and not viewing. Actual survey results\nindicate that 57.1% of the respondents of the U.A.E popula-\ntion view Alhurra; 42.9% of the respondents did not view\nAlhurra and comprised the nonviewing group. The canoni-\ncal discriminant functions, a measure of how well the func-\ntion discerns viewing and not viewing Alhurra, revealed an\neigenvalue of .08, representing the between-groups variance\ndivided by the within-groups variance on the function for\nviewing or not viewing Alhurra (Table 1). The canonical\ncorrelation is .27 on this function, indicating discriminating\npower (predicting viewing or not viewing based on this set\nof variables).\nWith the function included in the analysis, Wilks's\nLambda is .93 for Alhurra viewing and not viewing, indicat-\ning differences between groups account for 9.2% (p < .05)\nof the variance in the predicting demographic, media use,\nand attitudes toward the U.S.A. variables. Table 2 presents\nthe standardized canonical discriminant function coeffi-\ncients of the independent variables, indicating the strength\nor weakness of the individual variables as predictors of\nviewing and not viewing. Five of seven Alhurra viewing/not\nviewing predictor variables drawn from the three research\nquestions (education, age, Radio Sawa listening, gender,\nand radio listening) rated high on this function and were\nthe stronger predictors of viewing and not viewing. Two of\nthe variables were negative predictors (education and radio\nlistening). The employment predictor was a weaker\nClark and Christie 9\npredictor, and the \"feelings about the U.S.A.\" variable was\nthe weakest predictor of Alhurra use.\nUsing this set of independent variables to predict Alhurra\nviewing, 65.5% of all cases were correctly classified by this\nanalysis.\nDiscussion and Limitations\nThis study found the high percentages of Alhurra-viewing\nclassification using the discriminant function suggest that\nthe combination of key cultural indicator variables is a\nsound predictor of viewing this news source. Thus, this\nstudy validates the premise of U.S. policy as it confirms the\nchallenges faced by international broadcasting 70 years ago\nand today--the role key cultural indicators play when these\nviewers decide to turn to or away from, in this case Alhurra,\nfor news and other information.\nU.S. international broadcasting efforts began 70 years\nago with the creation of Voice of America. The challenge\nback then was to reach two audience groups: those who\nwere friendly toward the United States and those who were\nantagonistic. The challenge was also to preserve the friend-\nship of one group while attempting to win the hearts and\nminds of those who had a less favorable view of the United\nStates. The philosophy was that if the truth was presented in\na friendly (and culturally sensitive) way, people hostile to\nthe United States might be won over. That effort, with its\nmany challenges, technical and programmatic, continues\ntoday through the use of Alhurra. Examining the traditional\nmedia use variables (Research Question 2), regular radio\nlistening appears to be a relatively strong predictor of\nAlhurra viewing or nonviewing. This suggests that Alhurra\nTelevision may be considered another media source by this\npopulation in the U.A.E.\nListening to Radio Sawa (its radio counterpart) was a\nstrong predictor of Alhurra viewing or nonviewing, suggest-\ning a possible linkage between perceptions of the two media.\nRadio Sawa listeners who also viewAlhurra may be doing so\nto find a video source to complement the information they\nhear by radio. Perhaps these viewers need more perspective\nbased on their exposure to Radio Sawa. In this case, an indi-\nvidual's value judgment of Radio Sawa may prompt Alhurra\nviewing. This suggests that, in this sense, the two media\nsources are complementary.\nThe findings related to the demographic variables exam-\nined (Research Question 1) suggest that the in-group identity\nof the population, as manifested in the age, education, gen-\nder, and employment variables, are powerful predictors of\nviewing or not viewing Alhurra. Although the exact nature of\nthis influence cannot be determined in this study, this study\nfinds that these key cultural indicator variables are core pre-\ndictors among this younger age group. From a U.S. govern-\nment programming perspective, these factors should inform\nAlhurra programming decisions. For example, creators of\ncontent on Alhurra should understand that reaching this key\nyounger demographic involves further exploration of the\ninfluence of gender, age, and educational levels on viewing.\nThe results also suggest that feelings toward the United\nStates play little or no role in predicting Alhurra viewing or\nnonviewing. This suggests that this basic attitude about a\nmajor out-group--the U.S. government (Research Question\n3)--may not affect whether or not this U.A.E. population\neither turns to or rejects Alhurra Television. For example, it\nis possible that the U.A.E. population watches Alhurra even\nif they disagree with the news presentation. Perhaps viewers\nwatch for reasons of curiosity or to confirm previously held\nnegative beliefs.\nLimitations of this study center on a need to understand\nthe audience's motivations for viewingAlhurra news. Further\nstudies could explore why these viewers watch the program-\nming, even if they dislike the United States or the U.S. source\nof programming. Qualitative research methods such as focus\ngroups on in-depth interviews would be useful in ascertain-\ning why these media choices are made. In addition, this study\nonly examined a younger demographic in the U.A.E, a nation\nhistorically friendlier to the United States than other Arabic\nnations. Surveys should also be conducted in less friendly\nnations to confirm the findings of this study. Other limita-\ntions of this study include possible audience resistance to\nsimply discussing Alhurra Television and surveying audi-\nences in this region given the prevalence of anti-American-\nAs we look back on the early efforts of the OWI, and on\nthe use of Alhurra today, what is interesting is that this study\nreveals that the criticism that OWI received back then could\napply to U.S. international broadcasting efforts in the present\ntime. In 1943, Joseph Barnes wrote, \"The charge is that our\npropaganda work is too simple, too provincially American,\nTable 2. Standardized Canonical Discriminant Function Coefficients\nAlhurra viewing\nVariable Function\nEducation \u00ad.48 (1 to 9 scale: 1 = no education, 9 = postgrad degree)\nRadio Sawa listening .49 (0 = no, 1 = yes)\nand too deeply committed to using truth as a weapon with\nwhich to confuse our enemies and give heart to our friends\"\nOne area of departure from the 1940s is that the United\nStates is now recognizing the need to reach audiences at\nhome in addition to audiences abroad. The U.S. committee\non foreign relations is considering revising the Smith\u00adMundt\nact and allowing international broadcasters to target audi-\nences within the United States. As the Senate Foreign\nRelations Committee notes,\nRussia and China and other entities currently broad-\ncast in English in the United States. Additionally,\nrecent Arabic speaking immigrants to the United\nStates are able to watch Al Jazeera but prevented by\nSmith-Mundt from viewing Al Hurra. These realities,\ncoupled with the rise of the Internet, which enables\ncomputer users in the U.S. to receive video and audio\nstreams of BBG broadcasts and readily access BBG\nWeb sites, demonstrate that aspects of the legislation\nare both anachronistic and potentially harmful.\nIn 1943, Hawkins and Pettee wrote that \"Revolutionary\ndevelopments in the media have loaded the opinion process\nwith a dynamite which it has never before possessed\"\n(pp. 15-16). The same could be said today about Alhurra.\nAny effort made by a government to influence public\nopinion needs to first take into account the audience, and in\nparticular, the specific cultural characteristics of the\naudience that predict the use of the medium conveying the\nmessage. This study reveals that media use and key cultural\nin-group variables play critical roles in predicting whether\nthe U.A.E. population turns to or away from this\nU.S.-government-funded television network. It is noteworthy\nthat existing feelings toward the United States were shown to\nplay no role in predicting Alhurra viewing or nonviewing,\nsuggesting that viewers may be drawn by the content of the\nprogramming of this outlet and not by the likes or dislikes\nof the U.S. government. As was the case in 1943, when the\nOWI realized the importance of reaching these in-groups\nby incorporating people from these groups into radio pro-\ngramming, the same challenge exists for the U.S. gover-\nnment today--the need to relate on a cultural level with these\npopulations to convey credible messages through interna-\ntional broadcasting.\nGiven the findings of this study, further studies should\nexamine the extent to which this programming results in\nmore (or less) favorable views of the United States and its\npolicies. Although Alhurra has made some major inroads in\nattracting viewers, it remains to be seen if negative attitudes\nand government policies about the United States will be\nchanged by this initiative and if the 70-year-old challenges\nof reaching a hostile audience by bridging a cultural divide\nthrough international broadcasting will be successful.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The survey was\nfunded in part by a grant from the Public Relations Society of\nAmerica Foundation.\nReferences\nAbout Us.
