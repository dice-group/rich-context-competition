The 2013 United Nations Women's\nConference focused on eliminating and preventing all forms of violence against women and\ngirls as part of its efforts to agree on a strategy to overcome all types of discrimination and vio-\nlence against women of different ages, contexts, and economic and social backgrounds (United\nNations, 2013). Gender discrimination is a historical fact that must be addressed in all kinds of\ninstitutions across the globe, including universities (Reda & Hamdan, 2015). Violence is partic-\nularly prevalent in institutions where hierarchical power relations remain predominant\n(Connell, 1987). As an institution built on power relations, the academy is a prime environment\n1University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK\n2University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain\n3University Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain\n4University Jaume I, Castello\n\u00b4 de la Plana, Spain\n5University of Warwick, Westwood Campus, Coventry, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nCarme Garcia Yeste, University Rovira i Virgili, Edifici Ventura i Gassol, 2\u00aa planta, despatx 210, Tarrgona 43007, Spain.\nEmail: carme.garciay@urv.cat\nfor gender-based violence (Farley, 1978). In academia, violence varies widely by type, victim\nprofile, and the context in which it occurs (Copenhaver & Grauerholz, 1991; Gross, Winslett,\nof the first countries to analyze and address the issue of gender-based violence in universities\n(Kirkpatrick & Kanin, 1957), as evidenced by the Campus Security Act of 1990 and the Student\nAlthough much research has been conducted on gender-based violence in universities, scant\nattention has been paid to the methodological dimension of this issue. Traditionally, studies on\nthis topic have been conducted using either quantitative or qualitative methods. However,\nresearch based on a mixed methods design has grown in popularity over the last several years,\nalong with an appreciation of the implications of this design for the field of gender-based vio-\nlence (Campbell, Patterson, & Bybee, 2011; Dardis, Kelley, Edwards, & Gidycz, 2013; Jackson,\nstudies have to some extent helped change the institutional, political, and legal landscapes of\ngender-based violence in universities. However, the path for this change has not always been\neasy to find. In this article, we present the possibility of shedding light on the political and social\nimplications of the first research conducted on gender-based violence in Spanish universities\nthrough the communicative evaluation of social impact (CESI).\nThe Communicative Evaluation of Social Impact\nThe CESI, which is framed under the communicative methodology, entails the assessment of\nactual social improvements related to research outcomes by collecting data and engaging in dia-\nlogue with manifold stakeholders. In the present study, CESI confirmed that the development\nof solidarity and promotion of awareness of overcoming gender-based violence were social and\npolitical implications of a multiphase mixed methods design conducted sequentially. The pio-\nneer research conducted in Spain on university gender-based violence was accomplished\nthrough mixed methods with a communicative approach, which allowed for an intersubjective\nprocess that transformed the university code of silence into the public recognition of this seri-\nous issue embedded in the academy.\nThe CESI involves (1) a participatory process with diverse stakeholders to make the results\nof the research available to society, (2) a communicative process that commences dialogues\nwith these stakeholders so that they can recreate the results in their own contexts, and (3) new\nfieldwork to collect evidence of the impacts achieved by this participatory and communicative\nprocess at both the individual level (i.e., changes in students' or professors' behavior) and the\ninstitutional level (i.e., changes in legislation or programs). Through the CESI, the social and\npolitical implications are revealed along the two phases of the study.\nThis article begins by explaining how studies of gender-based violence have used mixed\nmethods designs through a description of pioneering research on gender-based violence in and\nbeyond the university context. Following this explanation is a section dedicated to contextualiz-\ning the present study in the Spanish setting. Then, both the first and second phases of the\nresearch design are presented in detail. The next section identifies results and social transforma-\ntions generated by this body of research in the Spanish university context. In particular, impli-\ncations at the policy and practice levels are analyzed; for example, the CESI allowed the\nresearchers to identify how the first phase of the project led to breaking the silence on this\nissue, raising awareness, and creating bonds of solidarity. Finally, the article concludes with a\ndiscussion of the transformative power of mixed methods with a communicative orientation for\nresearch on gender-based violence in universities and emphasizes the contributions of CESI as\na new tool in mixed methods research.\n2 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\nMixed Methods Research and Gender-Based Violence\nGender-based violence is recognized as a global problem and an everyday reality for many\nwomen. Based on a survey of 42,000 women from the 28 member states of the European Union\nregarding different aspects of violence experienced by them, the Agency for Fundamental\nRights (FRA, 2014) concluded that since the age of 15 years, 1 in 10 women has experienced\nsome form of gender-based violence and 1 in 20 women has been raped. One in five women\nhas experienced physical or gender-based violence by a current or former partner. In addition to\nproviding a quantitative description of the prevalence of gender-based violence, this broad study\nalso shed light on the reasons for, consequences of, and psychological effects of violence in dif-\nferent circumstances, including childhood experiences, partner violence, and stalking. Although\nthe percentage of women suffering violence is high, this phenomenon is largely unreported\n(FRA, 2014). For instance, according to the most extensive survey, only 14% of women\nreported the violence they had suffered at the hands of partners or nonpartners. In certain parts\nof the world, gender inequalities are more apparent than ever before. Most actions to combat\nthis problem are focused on the mechanisms of prevention and response (Hadjar, Backes, &\nGysin, 2015; Vladutiu, Martin, & Macy, 2011). Different forms of community involvement,\nsuch as the bystander intervention mechanism, are more effective compared with other sexual\nIn this context, the mixed methods framework has yielded a better understanding of the com-\nplexity of the problem. As explained by Donna Mertens (2015), ``wicked problems'' require an\napproach that uses research not only to inform decisions regarding actions but also to develop\nstrategies useful for studying social inequalities. In this line, Corradi and Sto\ninstitutional involvement in and state responsibility for combatting violence against women.\nAfter presenting a thorough analysis of the mechanisms and policies regarding the role of the\nstate, social movements, and other agents involved in fighting against violence in 10 European\ncountries, these authors conclude that although the state is a powerful mechanism, it only reacts\nunder pressure from supranational bodies connected with social movements.\nA relevant strand of research implements mixed methods by integrating quantitative and\nqualitative methodologies. Creswell (2009a) notes that mixed methods can be applied from a\nvariety of perspectives and attributes different functionalities to the techniques employed.\nStudies of gender-based violence that use mixed methods share certain common features. For\nexample, such studies generally begin with quantitative data collection techniques and then use\nqualitative data collection techniques--such as interviews, life stories, or discussion groups--to\ncomplement the quantitative data (Collins & Dressler, 2008; Dardis et al., 2013; Peterson &\n(2011) analyze the impact of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program on the prosecution\nrates of adult sexual assault cases in a large Midwestern community in the United States. In that\ncase, the researchers integrate quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques following\na mixed methods design to explain certain quantitative results. For example, the researchers\nfind that study participants do not always interpret survey questions in the same manner and\nthus qualitative data collection techniques are necessary to further explore these issues.\nMurphy and O'Leary (1994) suggest that the objective scales used in quantitative studies\noften disregard subjective and contextual dimensions. For this reason, they contend that the ben-\nefits of mixed methods include the ability to combine qualitative methods designed to theorize\non the basis of knowledge extracted from social contexts and subjective perspectives with tradi-\ntional qualitative methods designed to evaluate responses according to deductive logic. Thus,\nmixed methods have advanced knowledge on gender-based violence in general and--as will be\nshown in the following section--in the university setting in particular.\nPuigvert et al. 3\nPrevious Research on Gender-Based Violence in Universities\nInternationally, previous studies of gender-based violence in universities have employed both\nquantitative and qualitative techniques without explicitly acknowledging this methodological\nintegration or synthesis of findings. In this regard, Choate (2003) attempts to explain participant\nreactions to rape prevention programs based on the Men Against vVolence model (Hong, 2000),\nwhich emphasizes the link between male socialization and sexual aggression. Choate explores\nthe success of the Men Against Violence V program by conducting a pilot study in which an\nexploratory evaluation instrument was administered to 149 fraternity members at different uni-\nversities. The instrument consisted of a ``program evaluation'' form that included questions\ncorresponding to three components: first, asking participants to record thoughts in a subjective\nway; second, implementing a 5-point Likert-type scale questionnaire; and third, once again ask-\ning participants open-ended questions in a qualitative way. The findings enabled college coun-\nsellors to obtain participants' thoughts about and reactions to the program. This manner of\norganizing their study made it possible to obtain important insights on how to improve the\nimplementation of campus rape prevention programs for men in college. These studies thus\ndraw on prominent scales (e.g., the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale) to understand a more general\ncontext (Coker et al., 2011; Cook-Craig et al., 2014; Moynihan, Banyard, Arnold, Eckstein, &\nStapleton, 2011). The results indicate that people who receive bystander training are more\nlikely to report such behavior, intervene in violent situations, and feel responsible for ending\nviolence.\nQuantitative research has generally been aimed at measuring the scope of gender-based vio-\nlence in universities (Benson & Thomson, 1982). In these studies, quantitative data collection\ntechniques primarily comprise surveys and questionnaires administered to students (Bryant &\n2012). The data are used to analyze incidence rates, types of violence, profiles of victims and\naggressors, circumstances in which violence occurs, and the reactions of victims and those\naround them (Banyard et al., 2005; Belknap, Fisher, & Cullen, 1999; Fonow, Richardson, &\nWemmerus, 1992; Kalof, Eby, Matheson, & Kroska, 2001). The outcomes of such research\nmay lead to gender-based violence prevention programs that train students to become active\nOther researchers have highlighted the problem of sexual harassment tolerance (Bryant &\nSpencer, 2003; Reilly, Lott, Caldwell, & DeLuca, 1992), which has subsequently been\naddressed through legal regulations such as the Clery Act (Cantalupo, 2012) and in university\npolicies (McMahon, 2008). Research on gender-based violence on U.S. campuses has proven\ncrucial to recent approaches to end this problem. In 2014, President Obama established the\nTask Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault (White House Task Force to Protect\nStudents from Sexual Assault, 2014); one of its first objectives was to consult studies, espe-\ncially those that could help overcome gender-based violence in universities. However, such\nstudies have failed to clearly identify how mixed methods research efforts can change unac-\ncommodating university climates (Mertens, 2015).\nTo obtain more comprehensive data regarding the causes of violence, especially among col-\nlege students (Mahlstedt & Welsh, 2005), researchers have used in-depth interviews, focus\ngroups, and essays or scripts on violent situations. These studies have greatly contributed to stu-\ndents' perceptions of social environments in which gender-based violence occurs and have\nopened up new avenues to prevent such violence (Koelsch, Brown, & Boisen, 2012; Littleton,\nTabernik, Canales, & Backstrom, 2009; Mahlstedt & Welsh, 2005). Armstrong, Hamilton, and\nSweeney (2006) highlight individual, organizational, and interactional processes that increase\nthe prevalence of gender-based violence. Through a documented revision of prevention\n4 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\nprograms (e.g., motivational interventions, dialectical behavior therapy, mindfulness, and\nbystander interventions), Shorey et al. (2012) advance methodological reflections on dating vio-\nlence prevention programs for college students. According to these authors, one of the most\nimportant methodological considerations at the time of program implementation concerns the\neffects of the treatment of longitudinal data on a program's efficacy. This type of research has\nalso helped identify those interventions that are more effective at preventing violence at such\ninstitutions and the capacities maintained and reinforced on university campuses that directly\nimpact interventions.\nOur review of the literature on gender-based violence in universities framed under a mixed\nmethods design leads to the conclusion that better integration can be sought.\nAs Testa et al. (2011) noted, mixed methods approaches to the study of gender-based vio-\nlence involve the integration of quantitative and qualitative methodologies to create synergy,\nwhich in turn leads to a more in-depth understanding. Given the evidence of the transformative\nthese designs should be of great value to researchers who aim to better comprehend and analyze\ngender-based violence within universities. Mixed methods studies can illuminate additional\nways to overcome this problem by shedding light on more effective mechanisms to prevent and\nrespond to gender-based violence and sexual victimization in universities.\nPrevious Research on Gender-Based Violence in Spanish Universities\nThe consideration of gender-based violence in Spain as a public issue to be addressed is fairly\nrecent. The Spanish parliament passed pioneering legislation in 1989 to establish domestic vio-\nlence as a women's rights issue. The first national plan, which included training, data collection,\nand restraining orders, was issued in 1998; only a couple of years later, the Spanish ``Integral\nLaw against Gender Violence'' was approved (Roggeband, 2012).\nThe first attempt to tackle gender-based violence in universities occurred in 1995, when\nProfessor Ramon Flecha of the University of Barcelona, then director of the Community of\nResearchers on Excellence for All (CREA2), wrote to the university's governing body about\nthe need to address violence against women. Flecha contended that his strategy reflected the\napproach taken by top-ranked global universities and proposed the creation of a commission to\noversee related work. Flecha never received an official reply to his request (Giner, 2011).\nAccording to a study by Roggeband (2012), the Spanish context for addressing gender-based\nviolence was framed by strong feminist mobilization and left-wing governments. In the univer-\nsity context, faculty members joined the struggle in 1999, when SAPPHO, CREA's women\ngroup, was created. Although everyone on campus discussed the issue of gender-based violence\nand claimed to have information about the perpetrators, no one dared to report them.\nSeveral researchers have proposed projects related to gender-based violence in universities\nto funding bodies. Of the 6,955 approved RTD projects (funded by the Women's Institute or\nthe Ministry of Education and Culture) conducted between 1983 and 2005, not one focused on\ngender-based violence in universities. Only in 2005 did CREA's SAPPHO obtain national fund-\ning to conduct the present research project--after proposing one in 2002--which was the first\nstudy to consider university gender-based violence in Spain and led to access to research regard-\ning sexual harassment and to recognition of the issue.\nThe project was funded within a context of broader political awareness of the need to address\ngender-based violence. In 2004, Spain passed the first Organic Law Against Gender Violence\nin Europe. CREA researchers and policy makers discussed CREA's work to prevent the sociali-\nzation of gender-based violence, which created opportunities to address the problem in Spanish\nuniversities as well. In this context, the first step entailed the accumulation of statistical data on\nPuigvert et al. 5\nthe scope and occurrence of gender-based violence at Spanish universities, which is precisely\nwhat our study was designed to do.\nBackground for Our Study\nThe present article is based on a study funded by the Spanish Institute for Women on gender-\nbased violence in universities, which was the first to shed light on this previously unacknowledged\nreality in Spain (Valls, Puigvert, Melgar & Garcia-Yeste, 2016). This research effort is also dedi-\ncated to identifying successful programs developed at some of the most prestigious universities in\nthe world and advocating for their implementation at Spanish institutions. This study represents a\nturning point in Spanish academia because for the first time in its history--and despite notable\nresistance--something is being done to address the issue of gender-based violence.\nBreaking the silence on this issue was no easy task. Leading researchers were subjected to\ncriticism and sexist remarks, most of which were delivered anonymously or disseminated\nthrough social networks. Rumors regarding the lead researchers' sexual lives were spread to dis-\ncredit their intellectual reputations. For instance, researchers were accused of using sexual rela-\ntionships to further their academic careers. This campaign focused on discrediting not only those\nresearchers who had long worked in this area but also those who had recently started supporting\nthem. Such reactions are captured by our definition of second order of sexual harassment (Vidu,\nValls, Puigvert, Melgar, & Joanpere, 2017), which is the use of physical and/or psychological\nviolence against those who support victims of sexual harassment. This pattern was identified in\nprevious research several decades ago (Dziech & Weiner, 1990). In Spain, these attacks within\nthe university community were designed to hinder the academic careers of female researchers\nand professors who dared to break the silence. These efforts provided a clear warning to the\nentire university community of the consequences of joining the efforts to break the silence. The\nexperience of one student who applied for a predoctoral fellowship to work on gender-based vio-\nlence reflects these attitudes. Professors in the student's department attempted to persuade her\nnot to work with professors from CREA, telling her that it would cause problems. This informa-\ntion turned out to be accurate. Once the student decided to work with a CREA professor, several\nfaculty members in the student's department implemented every possible barrier to prevent her\nfrom receiving a fellowship and conducting the planned work (Giner, 2011).\nDue to these personal attacks, implementing the current mixed methods research was not an\neasy journey. For instance, data collection efforts were hampered by resistance and negative\nfeedback from institutions and individuals in the university community; some even declined to\nparticipate in the study. However, these difficulties were addressed through a very focused\nsearch for key informants and by reassuring participants of their anonymity. The qualitative\ncomponent of our study helped capture this overarching context, wherein much opposition was\nencountered not only when conducting research on gender-based violence at institutions of\nhigher education but also when developing regulations designed to prevent or address such vio-\nlence. In the second phase of this mixed methods research process, a communicative evaluation\nof social impact was conducted to reveal all the transformations resulting from the first phase.\nPurpose Statement\nThe mixed methods research presented herein was developed using communicative methodol-\nogy. The European Commission has recognized communicative methodology for its ability to\ntransform studied realities and thus to overcome specific social barriers (European Commission,\n2011b). Communicative methodology has been applied in projects implemented under the\nFramework Programs and Horizon 2020 of the European Commission.3 Of these initiatives, the\n6 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\nINCLUD-ED project was selected by the European Commission (2011a) among the top 10\nresearch projects as the Social Sciences and Humanities project with the greatest social impact.\nThe methodology has demonstrated its transformative potential through these projects and in\nseveral different social contexts with diverse cultural features.\nUnder the communicative methodology framework, knowledge is constructed through inter-\nactions between science and society. This framework integrates objectivity and subjectivity by\npromoting an intersubjective and egalitarian dialogue between researchers and ``researched\nagents'' while simultaneously fostering reflection among those involved in the research process,\nwhich results in a dialogic creation of knowledge (J. Go\n\u00b4mez, Latorre, Sa\n\u00b4nchez, & Flecha,\n2006). Special emphasis is placed on conditions for dialogue throughout the entire research pro-\ncess, from research design to development, analysis, and result dissemination (A. Go\n\u00b4mez, Siles,\n\u00b4s, Garcia, de Mello, & Molina, 2011). The views of experts (or research-\ners) are not imposed on nonexperts (Beck, Giddens, & Lash, 1994). Debates are based on valid-\nity claims and not claims of power (Habermas, 1984), which is especially critical when\nanalyzing a highly hierarchical context such as Spanish academe because it gives a voice to\nthose who traditionally hold less power in the higher education environment (i.e., students, non-\ntenured faculty, and staff). Thus, scientific knowledge of gender-based violence in universities\nwas extracted from a literature review, whereas the results of surveys conducted at Spanish uni-\nversities were introduced in the qualitative phase. Through this dialogue, both researchers and\nparticipants discussed how scientific evidence could be recreated in the specific context of\nSpanish universities. In turn, specific proposals for addressing gender-based violence in Spanish\nhigher education were obtained to facilitate transformations in this context.\nThe communicative methodology distances itself from methodologies based on deficit the-\nories, focusing instead on each individual's capacity to evaluate and transform his or her own\nlife (Flecha, 2014). Such transformation is not promoted solely by researchers or participants.\nRather, transformation is possible because the subjects engaged in the communicative research\nprocess enter an intersubjective dialogue with researchers, thus prompting a series of debates\nthat lead them not only to reach agreements and generate new knowledge but also to become\nagents in changing their own reality (Roca, Go\n\u00b4mez, & Burgue\nResearch Design\nThe study was framed under a multiphase mixed methods design conducted sequentially. First,\nwe used an initial convergent design comprising a survey and semistructured interviews; then,\na second qualitative phase was conducted to explain the main findings of the first phase and to\nevaluate the social impact of these results (Creswell, 2009b; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). The\nfirst phase of the study (from 2005 to 2008) involved the combination of quantitative and quali-\ntative data collection techniques using a questionnaire; the results of this process formed the\nbasis for concrete guidelines for in-depth interviews and communicative daily life stories\n(CDLS). The second phase was qualitative and included the CESI, and CDLS were conducted\nto explain the findings of the first phase.\nIn Figure 1, we show the sequence of the research process.\nDuring the first phase, data were collected to address the following two research questions:\n(1) What is the extent of gender-based violence in Spanish universities? (2) What measures\ntaken in university contexts can help overcome gender-based violence? This part of the study\nwas the convergent quantitative and qualitative phase, during which a survey was distributed to\nstudents and semistructured in-depth interviews and CDLS were conducted (A. Go\n\u00b4mez,\nRacionero, & Sorde, 2010). The second phase involved a CESI, that is, a communicative\nassessment designed to identify the social impact of the research (Flecha, Soler-Gallart, &\nPuigvert et al. 7\nSorde\n\u00b4, 2015), particularly whether the situation of gender-based violence at universities had\nimproved. During the second phase, data were collected by means of CDLS to address the fol-\nlowing question: What is the social impact of the research on gender-based violence at Spanish\nuniversities?\nFirst Phase (2006-2008): Convergent Design Using Quantitative and Qualitative Data\nCollection Techniques\nData Collection and Analysis\nSurvey. The main purpose of the survey was to provide an overview of the cases that we\nlater recognized as gender-based violence within the university setting. The survey instrument\nwas developed based on information extracted from our review of previous literature and in\nconsideration of the Spanish university context (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 1999; Gross et al.,\n\u00b4quipe Enveff, 2003). The resulting instrument comprised\n91 questions divided into 5 sections: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) recognition of\ngender-based violence, (3) cases of gender-based violence in the university context, (4) victim\nreactions, and (5) resources, including resources that are available and measures that should be\ntaken to prevent and overcome gender-based violence in universities. All questions included in\nthe four last sections of the questionnaire were closed-ended questions, each of which had\nbetween 2 and 14 different response options. The first section (sociodemographic information)\nincluded questions related to place of birth, place of residence, and age and did not have closed\nanswer options. There were no open-ended questions in the other sections of the questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire was distributed to students. A multistage sampling technique was\nemployed to recruit participants (university students). Six Spanish universities in various geo-\ngraphic locations with diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and student body sizes\nwere selected. Then, quotas were established to ensure a diversity of student participants by\ngender, knowledge area, and degree type. Specific survey dates, times, and locations were\nestablished so that students who wished to participate could complete the survey at a specified\nlocation. The survey was publicized in advance in classrooms and cafeterias and through\nadministrative offices and student associations. The questionnaire was completed by 1,083 stu-\ndents, of which 67% were female and 33% were male. The mean age was 23 years, with a stan-\ndard deviation of 4.7 years, a margin of error of 62.97%, and a confidence interval of 95%\n(see Table 1).\nSemistructured in-depth interviews and CDLS. These techniques were applied among students,\nfaculty, and administrative staff to acquire a more thorough understanding of the problem. From\nFigure 1. Research design: Sequential mixed methods.\n8 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\n16 CDLS sessions were conducted with students. Seventeen participants were women, and 12\nwere men. In all cases, participants were affiliated with different disciplines (e.g., medicine,\nlaw, psychology, economics, education). The interviews were designed to collect the views of\nprofessionals employed at the institution and of those who represent the system, whereas the\nCDLS was intended to capture the views of students, who presented unique outlooks based on\ntheir life stages and personal experiences.\nCDLS differs from traditional daily life stories because the former involves a dialogic pro-\ncess of inquiry between the researcher and the participant that seeks mutual understanding.\nCDLS should be conducted in the participant's natural environment to avoid any distortion of\ncommunication. A dialogic interpretation is needed to project future participant expectations\nand to capture aspects of the present and of his or her immediate past, which provide an indica-\ntion of how the subject lives, thinks and behaves in her or his daily life.\nSemistructured, in-depth interviews and CDLS require a shared reflection on survey results,\nwhich contributes to a broader recognition of cases of gender-based violence. Consequently,\nmore detailed information was obtained based on the interviewees' knowledge and identifica-\ntion of gender-based violence cases and on the roles played by the institution. The information\ngathered focused on institutional responses, the effects of these responses on victims, and\nwhether the participants knew what to do when they realized that they (or someone close to\nthem) was a victim. Shared reflections about the types of measures participants would like to\nsee implemented in Spanish universities were also included (see Table 2).\nCommunicative data analysis. All the survey responses were introduced and analyzed with a\nstatistical software package. Descriptive univariate analysis was conducted. First, we ran a fre-\nquency analysis with the main data; then, we introduced a crosstab analysis based primarily on\ntwo main qualitative variables. The purpose of this crosstab analysis was to analyze the degree\nto which university students identify with gender-based violence situations. The two variables\nwere assigned to students who answered ``no'' to a question regarding ``whether they knew of\nany cases of violence against women that had occurred at their university or between individu-\nals of the university community'' (first variable) and to those who indicated that they were\naware of or had experienced one or several types of gender-based violence (second variable;\ni.e., physical aggression; psychological violence; sexual aggression; pressure to have sexual or\nemotional relationships; nonconsensual kissing or touching; discomfort with or fear of remarks,\nlooks, e-mails, phone calls, persecution, or surveillance; rumors about one's sex life; sexist\nremarks about the intellectual capacities of women or their role in society; or remarks with\nhateful or humiliating sexual connotations).\nRegarding the qualitative data used, the analysis followed the double axis of transformative\nand exclusionary dimensions (horizontal axis) and the 12 subcategories that emerged from the\nTable 1. Number of Questionnaires Administered by University Size.\nUniversity Number of students Number of questionnaires\nPuigvert et al. 9\nliterature review and questionnaire (vertical axis; Pulido, Elboj, Campdepadro\n\u00b4s, & Cabre\n\u00b4,\n2014). For the horizontal axis, the transformative dimension refers to elements that can illumi-\nnate means to transform cases of social injustice or to analyze inequality. In this study, the\ntransformative dimension refers to participants' perceptions and assessments of situations of\ngender-based violence that were resolved through university involvement, thereby creating an\nenvironment of solidarity with the victim. Information regarding the transformative dimension\nrefers to narratives of gender-based violence within university contexts in which participants\ntook a stand and defended the victim.\nThe exclusionary dimension refers to elements that reflect barriers to overcoming social\ninequalities. In this case, in particular, the exclusionary dimension refers to views held by the\nuniversity community about scenarios in which gender-based violence was considered ``natura-\nlized'' and in which ``taking a stand'' was very unlikely to occur. Elements classified as exclu-\nsionary include resistance by university authorities to establish protocols against gender-based\nviolence, which makes it difficult to report instances of violence. For the vertical axis, the 12\nsubcategories were grouped under two main categories: (1) measures implemented at presti-\ngious international universities and (2) knowledge of instances of gender-based violence and of\nthe role played by the university.\nMain Results of the First Phase. This first phase yielded groundbreaking results regarding the\nSpanish university context. Three main findings must be highlighted: the lack of identification\nand recognition of gender-based violence; institutional resistance to addressing this issue; and\nthe absence of measures to respond to this reality, especially measures to create spaces of sup-\nport for and solidarity with the victims. The quantitative results showed a clear lack of identifi-\ncation and recognition of gender-based violence in the university context. Whereas\napproximately 62% of students had experienced gender-based violence within a university set-\nting or knew someone who had experienced it, only 13% of the participants actually identified\nthese situations as gender-based violence.\nConclusions from the qualitative fieldwork emphasize university efforts to hide or discredit\ncases of gender-based violence. According to the interviewees, this attitude is attributable to the\nhierarchical structure of Spanish universities that renders those in positions of power immune to\npunishment. In conjunction with the findings of previous studies, 85% of the students and quali-\ntative fieldwork participants stressed the need to create spaces of support, assistance, and soli-\ndarity within universities to affirm victims and overcome gender-based violence. Participants\nalso indicated that introducing the results of this study to public debate was critical to provoke a\nconversation on a topic that had never before been discussed publicly.\nTable 2.

For the CESI, observations about the impact of our initial results\nwere collected over several years through dialogue with different stakeholders. Dialogue about\nthe first-phase results took place in diverse settings in the university community, at national\nand international conferences and through numerous classroom presentations; we also sent our\nresults to various regional ombudsmen, scientific publishers, and documentary filmmakers who\npublicized our findings. Introducing our research to major civil society organizations that aim\nto eradicate gender-based violence was also crucial. We followed up on our initial contacts with\nmeetings, exchanges, and working groups to introduce changes at higher education institutions\nand to develop new legislation.\nIn 2014, this participatory process was contrasted with and complemented by seven CDLS\nconducted with faculty and students to assess the implications of the research conducted during\nthe first phase. The key informants were selected based on the following two criteria: (1) in-\ndepth knowledge of our study and how it had developed and (2) explicit recognition of gender-\nbased violence in their own institutions and a commitment to addressing the problem (i.e., a\nhistory of support for the implementation of specific measures to prevent and address gender-\nbased violence in universities). Thus, all participants had previously engaged in dialogue and\nreflection on the initial results and on ways to make universities safer. For example, one student\ninterviewee had sought help from the research team and committed faculty members to address\nsituations in which she felt unsafe. Seven participants were selected (six faculty members and\none student; one male and six females).\nThe CDLS discussions focused on the results obtained in the first phase--particularly the\nrepercussions of having engaged diverse social agents in the research--as part of the communi-\ncative orientation. Data collection during the second phase centered on how changes had made\nuniversities safer in terms of gender-based violence (see Table 3).\nCommunicative data analysis. For our analysis of the CDLS, transcripts were transcribed and\ncoded. On the horizontal axis, our analysis was based on the distinction between the transfor-\nmative and exclusionary dimensions. Thus, we distinguished between elements that have sup-\nported gender-based violence prevention in Spanish universities and those that have hindered\nthis process. On the vertical axis, we differentiated between systems and agency, and several\nsubcategories were assigned to each. This categorization allowed us to identify changes made\nat the system level (i.e., legal systems, universities, schools, the public domain) and the agency\nlevel (i.e., attitudes toward the issue, relations to victims, networks).\nThese seven CDLS were contrasted with the results from the first phase using the same com-\nmunicative data analysis. The social impact achieved by the first phase was taken into account\nTable 3. Number of Communicative Daily Life Stories.\nCommunicative daily life stories\nUniversity Faculty Students Total Women Men\nin the CDLS analysis in the second phase. The interpretation of the final results was ultimately\nestablished by engaging with representatives from the different participant groups.\nResults\nThe mixed methods approach has been shown to be fruitful not only in the analysis of gender-\nbased violence in society as a whole but also in the study of this problem within the university\ncontext. Since this research project was started, the communicative orientation of this methodo-\nlogical approach has enabled major changes regarding gender-based violence in Spanish uni-\nversities. In this regard, the CESI was instrumental in promoting awareness of the issue and\ndeveloping solidarity with the victims in Spanish universities and in achieving relevant institu-\ntional changes for the prevention of and response to gender-based violence. Accordingly, this\nresearch has had implications at certain universities, especially due to students' involvement in\nthe cause. For the first time in Spanish history, students are mobilized around this cause; they\nare asking for effective measures to combat sexual harassment in university, demanding institu-\ntional support for victims, challenging university protection of perpetrators, and seeking to\nensure that victims are not forced to enroll in classes taught by their alleged harassers.\nAdditionally, the first peer-to-peer network providing support and solidarity to victims was\nestablished. Due to the emergence of this issue and the increased solidarity among certain\nfaculty and peers, the first formal reports of gender-based violence were filed at Spanish univer-\nsities. Without a mixed methods approach and communicative orientation to engage partici-\npants throughout the research process, the final repercussions would not have been possible.\nThe research described in this article also has several implications for Spain at large. The\ncommunicative process that inspired a dialogue about the present research results among mem-\nbers of the Spanish Parliament influenced the Law for the Effective Equality between Women\nand Men,4 which passed in 2007, by compelling all universities to have ``policies for the resolu-\ntion of sexual harassment in public administrations.'' As a result of this process, Spanish legisla-\ntion acknowledged for the first time that gender-based violence occurs in higher education and\nmade it mandatory for Spanish universities to deploy resources to address reports of gender-\nbased violence. Thus, ``equality units'' have been established in all universities to develop pro-\ntocols to address gender-based violence and protect the victims. Several years later, through a\nnew dialogue process, a regional Parliament decided to address the issue by discussing how it\ncould ensure that universities are actually implementing this legislation.\nThe results are also positive for the field of gender-based violence: silence is being broken,\nmore cases are being discussed, and activism is on the rise, as observed in the implementation\nof training courses for the entire university community. In addition, the first conference on vic-\ntims of second-order sexual harassment was organized, featuring scholars who had played key\nroles in this struggle in the United States; these scholars spoke about the necessity of mobilizing\npeople from below and the importance of peer-to-peer support. In the following sections, we\npresent a more thorough explanation of how the CESI contributed to the revelation of the mani-\nfold social impact achieved by the first phase of our study.\nBreaking the Silence and Overcoming the Fear of Reporting\nData collection efforts--and the CDLS sessions in particular--served as the first means of dis-\ncussing gender-based violence in the university setting. Participants' narratives showed that the\ncommunicative methodology created conditions for dialogue that encouraged students who par-\nticipated in the fieldwork to report abuse. The methodology also succeeded in creating a safe\nenvironment that avoided the traditional hierarchy between researchers and participants, making\n12 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\nit possible to engage in an extended conversation on an issue that was previously considered\n``taboo'' within the academic realm and to attach a name to a problem that had always existed.\nMoreover, these dialogue spaces involved not only research participants but also other rele-\nvant stakeholders who were involved in subsequent dissemination activities. Thus, recommen-\ndations for a ``zero violence'' policy were reiterated during public events and in private\nconversations with various stakeholders, including politicians.\nA concrete example relates to a seminar held in November 2009 at the Women's Institute, a\ngovernmental body that focuses on women's issues. Researchers presented data regarding vic-\ntims' reactions to cases of violence, noting that 91% of victims decided not to report incidents\nbut that a high percentage (66%) of them described the incidents to someone else. Among those\nwho reported incidents, the vast majority (69%) felt uncertain about receiving support from the\nuniversity (Valls et al., 2016). For many university administrators attending this seminar, these\ndata revealed student perceptions of institutional ``passivity'' regarding cases of gender-based\nviolence. Therefore, these events were of great importance because they prompted university\nrepresentatives to take a public stand and commit to recognizing the existence of gender-based\nviolence in their universities. Consequently, individuals from several universities across Spain\ncontacted the research team to obtain more information, especially about what can be done in\nuniversities to address this issue. Additionally, many professors have requested more informa-\ntion or have even invited the researchers to their respective universities to explain the results of\nthe study in order to justify attention to this issue at their institutions. Meetings, workshops, and\neven follow-up conferences were organized to widely disseminate the results and to raise aware-\nness at their regional universities. It is important that people who truly wanted to improve their\nuniversities through these mechanisms turned to us for guidance. As Gabriela, a faculty member\nwho attended the conference, explains,\nThe result of this pioneering research is that for the first time, when the issue comes up, many peo-\nple have the sense that ``I'm not alone. It's not only happening at my university, etc.'' I think it's an\nunstoppable process initiated by this study being made public. It had an impact on the national press\nand has been widely discussed. This, in turn, has encouraged people to start bringing cases forward,\nand institutions have recognized the consequences and the problems. You can agree or not, but you\nknow that legally you can be in big trouble. (Gabriela, 2014)\nThus, another important impact was the inclusion in the 2007 Law for the Effective Equality\nbetween Women and Men5 of the obligation of all universities to establish equality units to\noversee all cases of gender-based violence occurring at Spanish universities. At the time of this\nwriting, equality units at 37 Spanish public universities have implemented protocols to combat\nsexual harassment. The first such protocol was approved in 2011, showing that the process of\nchanging hierarchical university structures may be slow but change is possible and currently\nunderway.\nOverall, the data show that the first phase of the project has influenced the perception and\ntreatment of gender-based violence by Spanish authorities and universities, indicating that the\nproject successfully transformed gender-based violence at universities into a public issue.\nSolidarity With and Among Victims\nThe atmosphere described above implies a turning point for university campuses. Harassers can\nno longer rely on silence from victims and on complicity from the university community. The\nsituations described herein have created opportunities to file formal reports of gender-based vio-\nlence. According to our analysis, the implicit law of silence has changed and sexual harassment\nis no longer normalized, which has promoted more solidarity with victims. As one student parti-\ncipant noted, ``Now it is more difficult to harass'' (Luci\nCristina, one of the interviewees, is a faculty member; during the first phase of our research,\nshe was a postdoctoral researcher at a prestigious European social sciences institution. She\nexplained how this research helped her when an instance of sexual harassment occurred at her\ndormitory. Specifically, Cristina's response was to support the victim:\nWhen the incident occurred, I spoke with members of the research team. ( . . . ) I took care of her\n[the victim], and I advised her because I knew, based on your research, what campaigns were say-\ning about gender-based violence, such as ``Tell someone.'' Someone must take care of the victim\nand protect her. So, I accompanied her to her room after all dinners and parties. (Cristina, 2014)\nIn her narrative, Cristina also explained that incidents of sexual harassment within the academic\ncontext are not isolated but rather occur much more frequently than commonly believed. This\nled her to respond and to assume that her struggle against gender-based violence was not limited\nto that one concrete case. Cristina realized that she needed to do something more and decided to\nbring the results of the investigation to the entire university campus by launching a victim soli-\ndarity campaign. Thus, Cristina's case illustrates how she became both a protector of a victim\nand an agent of social transformation at her university.\nSimilarly, in late 2013, the Solidarity Network of Victims of Gender Violence in Universities6\nwas created to provide dialogue, reflection, and support. This network was founded and has\nbeen promoted primarily by students and certain faculty members (including researchers who\nparticipated in this study) as a response to institutional passivity toward gender-based violence.\nThis platform aims to support victims of gender-based violence in universities and to raise\nawareness of the problem by organizing public events and direct action. The network has been\nincluded in the ``good practices'' database of the Spanish Observatory of Gender Violence.7\nLucia, one of the founding members of the network, explained how the platform has become a\nsupport mechanism:\nAlthough victims have experienced significant pressure from the university to solve this issue with-\nout making a fuss ( . . . ), they now come together and get support from certain faculty members\nand other students. This is really working. ( . . . ) Victims have come to speak with us. . . . We have\nexplained to them what we have done and how we have confronted the issue. ( . . . ) For the vic-\ntims, it has been very motivating to find support. We see that victims are not ugly girls or sad; on\nthe contrary, they are very brave girls, capable of doing many things. (Luci\nEstablishing this first support network in Spain illustrates the agency of those who have partici-\npated in these dialogue spaces to transform their environment and bring attention to the struggle\nagainst gender-based violence in Spanish universities. Lucia highlights victims' decisions to\nunite against passive institutional responses. These environments have empowered victims to\ntake responsibility and speak up.\nIn sum, the CESI results show that using mixed methods with a communicative orientation\nand disseminating the initial results has raised awareness of this issue among individuals in the\nuniversity community and beyond and has strengthened their agency. Creating safe spaces\nwhere gender-based violence can be discussed was crucial to allow members of the university\ncommunity to reflect on their own experiences and thereby identify violent situations they may\nhave experienced. Furthermore, conversations regarding preventative measures implemented at\nprominent universities have prompted action against gender-based violence within the univer-\nsity community. Hence, this pioneering research has proven essential for encouraging\n14 Journal of Mixed Methods Research\nindividuals to denounce gender-based violence, break the silence and organize at the regional\nand national levels.\nEthical Issues\nThe fact that gender-based violence is a highly sensitive issue--that most often cannot be dis-\ncussed openly--was taken into account. Full confidentiality was guaranteed to the participants.\nMoreover, participants' preferences were respected (e.g., conducting fieldwork in a setting more\nfamiliar to the participant or meeting off campus). Another crucial element involved structuring\nquestions in the third person, asking whether a participant or someone he or she knew had expe-\nrienced gender-based violence. A participant was not required to identify himself or herself as a\nvictim if he or she did not want to do so. Consequently, victims who feared the consequences of\ntelling their stories could explain what happened without identifying as a victim. During both\nquantitative and qualitative data collection, all participants were provided with contact informa-\ntion (telephone number and email) in case they had further questions or wanted to discuss any-\nthing related to gender-based violence at Spanish universities. Providing contact information for\nfollow-up discussions was necessary for two reasons. First, because certain participants began\nto identify, throughout the research process, violent situations of which they had previously been\nunaware. Second, no mechanisms for addressing this issue existed in Spanish universities during\nthe first phase of the research; therefore, the study was their first contact with the topic.\nDiscussion\nThe CESI includes a methodological design that allows researchers to gather evidence of the\nsocial impact of the research results, as well as evidence regarding the methodological aspects\nof the study that made this impact possible. Through CDLS and the other dialogic spaces cre-\nated during the process, narratives from diverse stakeholders in the university context provided\nproof of concrete social impacts at both personal and institutional levels.\nThe present study had implications for the universities involved. The opportunity to dialogue\nwith researchers about supposed cases of gender violence in safe spaces and with guaranteed\nconfidentiality increased awareness and reporting. In addition, knowledge about the results of\nthe study has led people in academia to raise awareness of the issue and to increase solidarity\nwith the victims of sexual harassment, facilitating that others dare to take a stand and to step\nforward to support victims. Therefore, the dissemination of the results through academic, social,\nand political forums has been crucial for creating an environment within the university in which\nremaining silent in the face of this issue is beginning to be viewed as conspiratorial to harass-\nment. As one scholar and activist in the field of gender-based violence in U.S. universities has\nstated, ``If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.''\nThere are also important implications for Spain, not only for the universities involved but\nalso for the Spanish university system as a whole. The CESI revealed how the communicative\napproach to a mixed methods study on gender-based violence was crucial to sharing both quan-\ntitative and qualitative results regarding the occurrence of this problem with key stakeholders\nin policy making, who in turn changed the legislation. Since 2007, Spanish universities are\nrequired to have equality units and protocols for the prevention of and response to sexual har-\nassment. Whereas there was once a code of silence about this problem--including among staff\nmembers with academic responsibility who knew about cases and did nothing about them--this\nstudy has definitively broken the silence in Spain. For instance, the governmental agency for\nscience and technology disseminated the results of the study and asked the researchers about its\nconsequences and implications; as a result, there has been a significant impact in the general\nmedia that reaches Spanish citizens and society as a whole. All these effects are part of the\nCESI process, and as a result, there is a general consensus today that gender violence is a prob-\nlem that must be addressed in Spanish universities.\nThis study and its methodology has implications for the field of research on gender-based\nviolence. First, this study contributes groundbreaking data about the Spanish landscape--both\nquantitative and qualitative--to the international literature. It also contributes to the state of the\nart on mechanisms and processes that are effective (or not) for overcoming this problem beyond\nthe university context. The CESI helps gather evidence about changes and transformations\nachieved as a consequence of research results and processes and therefore opens up a new line\nof study on gender-based violence, not only on the identification of the problem but also on\nhow to effectively address it.\nFinally, the present study contributes to the development of mixed methods research. The\nresults of CESI presented in this article show how the communicative orientation of this\nresearch helped overcome resistance while transforming personal and institutional conditions.\nWe have shown that mixed methods research effectively creates new settings, conditions, and\nenvironments to support violence-free universities. Therefore, we present the theoretical ratio-\nnale underlying the Communicative Evaluation of Social Impact as a methodological approach\nthat helps gather evidence about both the social impact of research and the procedure and meth-\nodology that make this impact possible. Research projects often end with the publication of\nresults in academic forums and thus researchers rarely know how society has benefited from\ntheir results. However, we have shown not only that the CESI allows the accumulation of data\non the social impact of research but also that the mixed methods design and communicative\napproach can facilitate this impact. Mixed methods researchers can therefore reveal the social\nimpact of their research by conducting CESI.\nThrough this process, we have provided evidence that change within universities is possible,\nso that they can become the type of institutions where we--without any doubt--want our\ndaughters and granddaughters to study: safe spaces free of any type of gender-based violence.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or pub-\nlication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
