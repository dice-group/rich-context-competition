This article extends this study to younger children.\nWe asked two hundred seventy 5- to 11-year-olds to draw \"two children who have a romance\" and \"two children who\nare friends,\" and we subsequently interviewed each participant about the characters' relationships. The drawings were\ncoded with three scales of Pictorial Assessment of Interpersonal Relationships (PAIR), an instrument by Bombi, Pinto, and\nCannoni. Interviews were categorized by the characters' age and identity and by the distinguishing features of romance and\nfriendship: location, intimacy, activity, personal characteristics, and emotions. Scale scores were compared with variance\nanalyses, whereas the categories frequencies were submitted to chi-square. Results showed that all participants were able to\ndistinguish the two relationships, even if the descriptions increased in detail with age. Girls provided more information than\nboys about romance, but were less inclined to talk about their own romantic experiences.\n",

However, there is a type of relationship\nthat has been rarely addressed in pre-pubertal youth: chil-\ndren's \"romance\" (see Furman & Rose, 2015, for a discus-\nsion about this relationship in adolescence). An obvious\nreason for this neglect is the common idea that young chil-\ndren, being sexually immature, cannot have real love emo-\ntions and, a fortiori, they cannot form relationships based on\nan emotion they do not feel.\nIn contrast with this notion, Hatfield, Schmitz, Cornelius,\nand Rapson (1988) proposed that virtually all children can\nexperience not only \"companionate love\" (with feelings of\nfondness, liking, and interpersonal commitment) but also\n\"passionate love,\" that is, an intense desire for union with\nanother person. In a study conducted by these scholars with\nparticipants found it difficult to understand the terms \"boy-\nfriend\" or \"girlfriend,\" to remember children in their entou-\nrage who had a partner of this sort or to name a peer of the\nopposite sex they would like for a romantic engagement. To\nassess the extent to which passionate love was present at the\nvarious ages, the authors devised the Juvenile Love Scale, an\ninstrument subsequently included in the Handbook of\nSexuality-Related Measures (3rd ed.; Fisher, Davis, Yarber,\n& Davis, 2011) that requires rating the subject's agreement\nwith sentences such as \"I'd feel bad if I thought that [name of\nsubject's girlfriend or boyfriend, real or desired] liked some-\nbody else better than me\" and \"When [name] is around I\nreally want to touch him/her and be touched.\" Using this\nscale, the authors found that the intensity of love in younger\nparticipants was comparable with that of the older partici-\npants; girls older than 6 years tended to receive higher scores\nthan boys.\nMore recently, Brechet (2015) has demonstrated that chil-\ndren from 6 to 10 years of age are able to represent the emo-\ntion of love in their drawings. The author asked the\nparticipants to draw a person as a basic reference, and then\ncompared this drawing with a second figure portraying \"a\nperson who is very much in love\" (\"amoureux\" in the origi-\nnal task, a word specifically referring to romantic love).\nChildren used various pictorial devices to distinguish the\n1Sapienza University of Rome, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nEleonora Cannoni, Department of Developmental and Social Psychology,\nEmail: eleonora.cannoni@uniroma1.it\nFriendship and Romantic Relationships\nDuring Early and Middle Childhood\nEleonora Cannoni1 and Anna Silvia Bombi1\n Keywords\nfriendship, romance, middle childhood, drawing, interview\n2 SAGE Open\nperson in love from the reference figure: the symbol of heart\n(60% of the drawings), the presence of another person (39%),\nwords of love (28%), metaphoric indices of a pleasant envi-\nronment such as blue sky or little birds (18%), reddened\ncheeks (18%), heart-shaped eyes (17%), and sophisticated\noutfit (15%). The mean number of indicators increased sig-\n2.37 at 10 years), but it is noteworthy that all children, even\nthe youngest, included at least one indicator.\nTaken together, the two above studies propose an image\nof \"love-competent\" young children, even if the source and\nextent of this competence remains speculative.\nIn fact, the seminal work of Hatfield et al. (1988) was\nrepeated neither systematically, nor cross-culturally, so that\nwe do not have a great deal of information concerning young\nchildren's ideas about romance generally (Neeman, Hubbard,\nThe literature about early romantic experiences typically\nfocus on adolescents (see Furman, Brown, & Feiring, 2009,\nfor a comprehensive review), and even the studies about\nearly adolescence only take into account ages 11 (e.g.,\nBrendgen, Vitaro, Doyle, Markiewicz, & Bukowski, 2002)\nThe few researches including younger participants we\nwere able to find were concentrated on children at the thresh-\nold of puberty and were mainly sociological or ethnographic\nexplorative reports based on in-depth study of small numbers\nof children. For instance, Thorne and Luria (2004), observing\nfourth and fifth graders in two schools of California and\nMassachusetts during the less supervised moments of the day\n(in the playground, hallways, lunchroom), found that children\nengaged in \"hetherosexually charged rituals\" such as a chase-\nand-kiss game, or teasing somebody for liking a peer of the\nopposite sex; sometimes, a child revealed to a friend of hav-\ning a crush, but according to the authors, these romances were\nmore often imagined than real. Experiences of exchanging\n\"Valentines\" as indices of romantic socialization were also\nexamined by Bright (1997). Mention of romantic relation-\nships emerged, even if not explicitly requested, in a study by\nWalton, Weatherall, and Jackson (2002) who collected writ-\nten accounts of conflict episodes from fourth, fifth, and sixth\ngraders in some U.S. public schools; in a small number of\ncases (33 out of 689), the stories of conflict were focused on\nproblems arising in the context of romantic relationships.\nnographic study in two primary school classes in England,\nfound that children between 10 and 11 years old spontane-\nously talked about cross-gender interactions and relationships\nof romantic nature. Recently, a work by Holford, Renold, and\nold); their article provides an ethnographic report of some\ngames involving children's kissing, sometimes accompanied\nby proposals of marriage, but--as far one can gather from the\ndescribed examples--this behavior did not happen in the con-\ntext of dyadic relationships.\nThe studies summarized in the previous paragraph agree\nin considering the reference to romance more a way of rein-\nforcing the distinction between the separate social worlds of\nboys and girls, than genuine loving experiences of some sort.\nHowever, the children's romantic talk, teasing and play, is\nnot irrelevant for the subsequent adolescent experiences, set-\nting the stage for the different perspectives with which teen-\nagers will approach their relationships to the opposite sex.As\nChildren draw on sexual meanings to maintain gender\nsegregation--to make cross-gender interaction risky and to\nmark and ritualize boundaries between \"the boys\" and \"the\ngirls.\" In their separate gender groups, girls and boys learn\nsomewhat different patterns of bonding--boys sharing the\narousal of group rule-breaking; girls emphasizing the\nconstruction of intimacy, and themes of romance. (p. 188)\nA more systematic psychological study, involving 1,664\nparticipants from 8 to 14 years old, was conducted by Carlson\nand Rose (2007) in six U.S. Midwestern school districts;\n58.4% of third graders and 49.7% of fifth graders reported to\nhave a boyfriend or a girlfriend, which was not simply a\nfriend who happened to be a boy (for girls) or a girl (for\nboys). It may seem surprising that figures are lower for older\nchildren (seventh grade: 37%; ninth grade: 39.5%). However,\nthis might be explained by the high proportion of younger\nchildren who made non-reciprocal nominations. In fact\n(excluding children with out-of-class romantic relationships\nfor whom reciprocity could not be assessed), the percentages\nof unilateral naming was 65.4% in third grade, 54.6% in fifth\ngrade, 40.6% in seventh grade, and only 10% in ninth grade.\nAccording to the authors, young children could attribute a\nromantic meaning to friendly behaviors, which would imply\nthat their idea of romance is not well defined, and at least\npartially overlapping with cross-gender friendship.\nThis issue, however, had been examined in another psycho-\nlogical study by Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, and Pepler (1999)\nwith different conclusions. These authors asked 1,755 children\nfrom 9 to 14 years to explain the difference between cross-sex\nfriendship and romance, providing the boys with the following\nsentence stems: \"A female friend is . . .\" and \"A girlfriend is\n. . .\" (for girls, the stems were \"A male friend is . . .\" and \"A\nboyfriend is . . .\"). Only 1% of the participant denied the exis-\ntenceofdifferencesbetweencross-sexfriendshipandromance.\nDescriptions of both friends and romantic partners were coded\ninto four categories: passion (including references to special\nliking, intense caring, love, crushes, romance, physical attrac-\ntion, sexual contact), affiliation (liking, friendship, compan-\nionship, dating), intimacy (trust, self-disclosure, closeness,\nsupport), and commitment (long-term alliance, exclusivity).\nPassion and commitment were almost uniquely associated\nwith romance, while intimacy was equally present in romance\nand friendship, increasing for both relationships with age.\nBecause affiliation was preeminent in the descriptions of\nCannoni and Bombi 3\nfriends, but was mentioned quite often also for boyfriends or\ngirlfriends, the subcodes of this category were analyzed sepa-\nrately, showing that in cross-sex friendships, affiliation\nreferred only to companionship, while in romantic relation-\nships affiliation referred to both companionship and dating.\nSimilarly, the few mentions of passion in the context of cross-\nsex friendship consisted of intense liking and caring, whereas\nphysicalandsexualcontactswerementionedonlyforromance.\nInterestingly, the ability to differentiate the two types of rela-\ntionships did not depend on direct experience, which was quite\nlow for both romance and cross-sex friendship; the amount of\ninteraction with friends of the opposite sex and with romantic\npartners, however, was related to the frequency of reference to\nintimacy.\nThe Rationale for Our Study\nThe available literature, while pointing to the relevance of\nromantic love for young children, leaves almost unexplored\nthe representation of romantic relationships before late\nchildhood.\nOur study follows the lead of Hatfield et al. (1998) and\nBrechet (2015) who suggested that even very young chil-\ndren know what \"passionate love\" is. Our approach, how-\never, differs from both of these studies in that we consider it\nnecessary to begin with an in-depth descriptive account not\nonly of romance but also of friendship. One reason is that\nwe have only two systematic studies about the children's\nability to distinguish the features of these two relationships\nabout older children; moreover, they produced different\nresults. Another reason is that we lack completely young\nchildren's spontaneous accounts of what romance is,\nalthough the systematic study of friendship was developed\non the basis of detailed descriptive reports (e.g., Selman,\nviding a descriptive account of children's representation of\nboth relationships, to verify if and how young children are\nable to distinguish them. To this end, we used a combination\nof methods: drawing and interview.\nDrawing has the capacity to facilitate children's reflec-\ntion and subsequent verbal expression, as is well known by\nclinicians (see Davis, 2011, as a recent example of this clini-\ncal use of drawing); however, drawing as a complement of\nverbal expression has been used also in research contexts\n(e.g., Yuen, 2004). One reason for the drawing efficacy in\nfacilitating the child's verbalization could be its function of\nemotion regulation, as recently demonstrated by Drake and\nWinner (2013). Thanks to this function, drawing opens the\nway to talk about emotionally laden topics, which children\ntend to keep to themselves, as could be the case for romantic\nrelationships.\nPictorial representations of relationships can be interesting\nper se, and have been traditionally used in clinical settings\nHere, however, we did not apply a symbolical interpretation,\nwhich has encountered a variety of objections (see Thomas &\nSilk, 1990, for a critical analysis of traditional approaches,\nand also Shiakou, 2012, for a more recent summary of these\ncriticisms). Rather, we used drawings only for their explicit\ncommunicative potential, adopting PAIR (Pictorial\nAssessment of Interpersonal Relationships), an empirically\nbased instrument devised by Bombi, Pinto, and Cannoni\n(2007) and subsequently used by many scholars (e.g., Laghi\nMisailidi, Bonoti, & Savva, 2012; Rabaglietti, Vacirca,\nZucchetti, & Ciarano, 2012; S\u00e1ndor, F\u00fcl\u00f6p, & Sebesty\u00e9n,\n2012). PAIR requires each participant to draw one or more\npictures of two persons, to illustrate the relationship between\nthem. This way of presenting the task makes it clear the com-\nmunicative, non playful nature of the drawing to be produced.\nThe data are then analyzed with different scales, which can be\nused--according to the research aims--to evaluate the physi-\ncal and psychological affinity of the figures (Scale of\nSimilarity), their comparative importance (Scale of Value),\ntheir relationship (Scales of Cohesion and Distancing), and\ntheir emotional state (Scale of Emotion). To enhance the\nvalidity and depth of information gathered with drawings,\nBombi et al. (2007) suggested using contrastive tasks, in\nwhich children are required to represent two instances of the\nsame relationship (e.g., two friends when they get along well\nand when they have a quarrel) or two relationships (e.g., you\nand your mother; you and your father). A contrastive strategy\nis especially useful in the present study, because it allows the\ndiscovery of similarities and differences between children's\nromance and friendship, the most widely experienced rela-\ntionship with peers. In particular, the Value Scale can show if\nthe parity between partners, which is characteristic of friend-\nship (Hartup, 1989) also applies to romantic relationships; the\nCohesion and Distancing Scales can show if the partners'\nconnectedness, which in friends' dyads can coexist with the\nneed for autonomy (Bombi & Pinto, 1994), is stronger in\nromantic couples.\nThe combination of drawing and interview is especially\nimportant here, because children are not entirely at ease\nwhen talking about romantic behaviors (e.g., kissing); how-\never, children's romance cannot be understood through pic-\ntorial representations alone, because some characteristics of\npartners are not easy or are impossible to draw (e.g., feelings,\nage). In sum, a multi-method approach was more promising\nthan a single instrument to gather a rich description of chil-\ndren's romance and friendship.\nHypotheses\nUsing the joint information of drawings and interviews, we\nenlarged the scope of the study, focusing on (a) the personal\ncharacteristics of friends and romantic partners and (b) the\nfeatures of friendship and romance; for both aspects, we\nchecked for possible differences linked to age and sex.\n4 SAGE Open\nPersonal Characteristics\nWe hypothesized that friends would be more similar to each\nother than romantic partners, because homophyly and the\nattempt at achieving a balance of power are well-known fea-\ntures of friendship (Berndt, 1986; Tesser, Campbell, &\nSmith, 1984); love, however, requires complementarity, for\nexample, in terms of emotional dependence and caring for\nthe other (for a discussion of these forms of complementarity\nin love relationships, see Shaver, Morgan, & Wu, 1996).\nAnalyzing the identity attributed to friends and romantic\npartners was also a way to gain some information, albeit\nindirect, about the prevalence of personal romantic experi-\nences; we hypothesized that children would refer mostly to\nimaginary characters in the case of romance and mostly to\nreal children (including themselves) in the case of friendship.\nIn fact, friendship is a virtually universal experience during\nchildhood (Krappmann, 1996) whereas the sociological and\nethnographic studies summarized above (Holford et al.,\nthat children's romantic behavior, especially for the youngest\n(Holford et al., 2013) is mainly a ritualized way to reinforce\ngender difference and does not imply necessarily a direct\ninvolvement in sustained relationships.\nFeatures of the Two Relationships\nThese features should emerge from partners' behaviors,\nportrayed and described. Following Connolly et al. (1999),\nwe expected that children would be able to distinguish\nfriendship and romance, depicting the first as an affiliative\nand companionate bond, less intimate and emotional than\nthe second. Moreover, friendship allows a large variety of\nshared activities with the only exclusion of those carrying a\nsexual meaning; however, even if boyfriends and girl-\nfriends spend their time in a variety of non-sexual and non-\ngendered activities (Carlson, 2006), it is probable that\nchildren would use especially sexualized and more intimate\ninteractions to distinguish romantic couples from pairs of\nfriends.\nThe ability to distinguish romance and friendship should\nbe already present in children younger than those interviewed\nby Connolly et al. (1999), given the early awareness of pas-\nsionate love demonstrated by Hatfield et al. (1988) and by\nBrechet (2015); however, we expected that the representa-\ntions of young children should be less detailed than that of\nolder, more experienced children.\nFinally, in view of the different emotional socialization of\nboys and girls (Chaplin, Cole, & Zahn-Waxler, 2005) and\nespecially their different experiences in the romantic arena\nthat the characterization of \"romantic partnership\" would\ndiffer somehow in boys and girls, but the lack of previous\nresearch did not allowed us to develop more detailed\nhypotheses.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWith the consent of parents and school authorities, 270 chil-\ndren from 5 to 11 years of age participated in the study. There\nwere six age groups: kindergarten (20 boys, 24 girls; M age\nrepresent a variety of social environments, one boy and one\ngirl were randomly chosen from various kindergarten and\nprimary school classes in 24 locations in southern and central\nItaly. Categorized by parents' occupations, participants\nbelong mainly to middle- and upper-middle-class (fathers:\n12% blue-collar workers, students, or unemployed; 21%\nself-employed or shopkeepers; 33% technicians, teachers,\nemployees; and 34% professionals or white-collar managers;\nmothers: 45% housewives; 8% blue-collar workers; 30%\ntechnicians, teachers, employees; and 17% professionals or\nwhite-collar managers).\nMeasures\nTo talk about romantic relationships could be embarrassing\nfor a child, especially with an unfamiliar adult. This is why\nwe resorted to drawing, a less direct form of information,\nfollowed by a short interview based on the drawing\ncontents.\nDrawings were collected and scored with PAIR, the above\ndescribed instrument by Bombi et al. (2007). In this study,\nchildren were asked to make two separate drawings: (friend-\nship drawing, FD) \"two children who are friends\" and\n(romantic drawing, RD) \"two children who are `engaged.'\"\nNote that in Italian the masculine plural \"bambini\" is gram-\nmatically generic and gender free, applying to all combina-\ntions of gender; hence, children could interpret the request as\nto draw two girls, two boys, or a girl and a boy.\nThe interviews were conducted to complement the infor-\nmation provided by the drawings (a) about the personal char-\nacteristics of the two friends and of the two romantic partners\n(age, identity) and (b) about circumstances and distinctive\nfeatures of their relationships (places of meetings; answers to\nthe question: \"What, in your drawings, shows the difference\nbetween friendships and romance?\").\nProcedure\nData were collected individually by a research assistant in a\nquiet schoolroom. She explained to each participant that she\nneeded help to understand better various ideas about chil-\ndren's romantic relationships and friendship. After receiving\nthe child's consent to discuss these topics, she gave the par-\nticipant a pencil, 12 crayons, an eraser, and two white sheets\nCannoni and Bombi 5\n(8.5 \u00d7 11) asking him or her to draw \"two children who are\nfriends demonstrating what it means to be friends\" (FD) and\nthen \"two children who are `engaged' demonstrating what it\nmeans to have a romantic relationship\" (RD); the task order\nwas reversed for half of the sample. At the end of the two\ndrawings, the child was interviewed as described above.\nData classifying.To ensure the comparability of friendship\nand romance, the same scales and categories were used to\nscore the two drawings (FD and RD) and the interview con-\ntents pertaining to friendship (Friendship Interview, FI) and\nromance (Romantic Interview, RI).\nDrawings. In each drawing, the apparent age of each figure\nwas coded child = 1 and adult = 2, and the apparent gender,\nmale = 1, female = 2.\nThree scales of PAIR (Bombi et al., 2007) were then\napplied.\nThe Scale of Value was used to verify if the two charac-\nters in each drawing (FD and RD) were pictorially equivalent\nor not. This scale provides a score from 0 to 10 for each fig-\nure, according to its dimensions, position in the page, body\ndetails, attributes (i.e., clothing and held objects) and colors;\nthe difference between the figures' scores indicates the\ndegree of dyad value disparity; this difference also allows\ndetermining which figure is more valued of the two, or the\ndyad parity, where dyad refers to the pair of figures taken as\na unit.\nOther two PAIR scales were used to evaluate the close-\nness of the characters' relationship. The Scale of Cohesion\nmeasures the interdependence between the partners, and pro-\nvides a score from 0 to 6 to the dyad, according to the pres-\nence of six types of pictorial cues: looking, approaching,\nacting together, being near to each other, sharing a common\nlocation, touching each other, or being connected by an\nobject. The Scale of Distancing measures the autonomy of\nthe partners, and provides a score from 0 to 6 to the dyad,\naccording to the presence of six types of pictorial cues:\navoiding to look at the other, moving away, acting indepen-\ndently from the other, being far, staying in a specific space\n(not shared with the other), being separated by something.\nThe drawings were scored by two trained judges, blind to\nthe research aims, following the guidelines reported by\nBombi et al. (2007). The scores assigned by the two judges\nwere highly correlated (Pearson's r = .86, p < .001, for Value;\nDistancing). For the final score assignment, where the judges\ndiffered, a discussion followed until full agreement was\nreached.\nInterviews.All the interviews were literally transcribed. An\ninspection of two protocols per age allowed us to detect the\nfollowing interview contents about friendship (FI) and\nromance (RI): characters' age, dyad identity, place of meet-\nings, and relationship features. The information about this\nlast content was provided in response to our request to\nexplain the distinctive features of the drawings, but children\nelaborated their answers in such a way that drawings\nappeared merely the occasion for them to present their ideas\nabout the difference between friendship and romance.\nThe characters age, both for FI and RI, received a con-\ntinuous score in years.\nThe dyad identity, both for FI and RI, was classified in\nfive mutually exclusive categories, ordered by increasing\nreality and psychological proximity to the subject: 1 = two\nimaginary children (\"children I invented\"); 2 = real generic\nchildren (\"two real boys/girls\"; \"Maria and Walter\"); 3 =\nacquaintances (\"two classmates,\" \"my neighbors\"); 4 = indi-\nviduals closely related to the subject (\"two of my friends\");\n5 = a dyad including the subject (\"me and my best friend\";\n\"my girlfriend and I\").\nThe place of meetings, both for FI and RI, was classified\nin five mutually exclusive categories: 0 = do not know, 1 =\nschool, 2 = home, 3 = outdoors (park, street, etc.), and 4 =\npublic places (fast food, swimming pool, supermarket, etc.).\nFor the relationship features, both FI and RI received five\nscores from 0 to 2 for the presence of each of five features,\nnon-mutually exclusive: 1 = location, 2 = degree of intimacy,\n3 = type of activity, 4 = personal characteristics, and 5 =\nattributed emotions.\nMoreover, in each of these five scores two mutually\nexclusive subcodes could be identified, as indicated by let-\nters: (1) location could be either 1a = proximity (\"to be in the\nsame place\") or 1b = privacy (\"to be alone together\"); (2)\ndegree of intimacy could be either 2a = contact (\"to hold\nhands\") or 2b = intimate contact (\"to kiss\"); (3) type of activ-\nity could be either 3a = generic or friendly activity (\"to play\")\nor 3b = romantic activity (\"to receive a Valentine\"); (4) per-\nsonal characteristics could be either 4a = friendly character-\nistics (\"to resemble each other\") or 4b = romantic\ncharacteristics (\"to look attractive\"); (5) attributed emotions\ncould be either 5a = relational emotions (\"to be happy\") or\n5b = romantic emotions (\"to be in love\"). Scores of two new\ncategories (friendly accent and romantic accent) were then\nobtained by summing the frequency of all the (a) subcodes\nand (b) subcodes, both for FI and RI.\nThe categories and scores were assigned by the first\nauthor; the few ambiguous answers were analyzed jointly\nwith the second author and the category or subcode was\nassigned after reaching an inter-judge agreement.\nData analyses.The Statistical Package for the Social Sci-\nences (SPSS 20.0) was used for all the statistical tests.\nWhen a parametric test was applicable (drawing scores of\nValue Disparity, Cohesion and Distancing, characters age,\nscores of the five relationship features, scores of friendly and\nromantic accent), we compared the scores (in FD and RD, or\nin FI and RI) with variance analyses for repeated measures,\nwith age or sex as independent variables; Duncan's test or\nStudent's T for paired samples were used for the post hoc\n6 SAGE Open\ncomparisons. When appropriate, Pearson's r was used as a\ncorrelation index. The 2 was used for the comparisons by\nage and sex of the remaining interviews contents (dyads\nidentity and place of meetings) and for the frequencies of\nvalorization of each figure in the two drawings.\nResults\nPersonal Characteristics of Friends and Romantic\nPartners\nAge of partners. All the participants fulfilled the task require-\nments, depicting two children in each drawing. When asked\nto attribute an age to the romantic partners, 69 children were\nnot able to answer, and some (n = 12) were discarded because\nthey attributed an adult age to one or both figures, even if the\ndrawing--according to the task--represented two children;\nfor the remaining 189 children, the ages of the two romantic\nchildren who provided valid data for friends assigned also in\nthis case similar ages to the two drawn characters, r = .89,\np < .001. Romantic partners are same age in 61% of the\ncases, or differ by 1 year (29%); differences of 2 or more\nyears are 10%. Friends are same age in 64% of the cases, or\ndiffer by 1 year (27%); differences of 2 or more years are\n9%. Based on this similarity, we then computed the mean\nages of romantic partners, on one hand, and of friends, on the\nother hand. The variance analysis for repeated measures on\nthese ages (valid cases, N = 181) yielded only two main\neffects: type of dyad (romantic partners = 8.5 years; friends\npants age (M dyads age in years: 5 years = 5.7; 6 years: 7.5;\nshowed that the average age of the drawn dyads increased\nregularly from one age group to the next, with the exception\nof the 7-year-olds who did not differ from the 6-year-olds.\nGender of partners. All the RD included figures of the oppo-\nsite sex; the dyads of the FD, instead, were mainly same-\ngender, and more often composed of two boys (two boys =\np < .001. There were no age differences in these choices,\nof the boys depicted two male friends, while only 55% of the\ngirls depicted two female friends; friendly dyads composed\nof a boy and a girl appeared in 35% of the girls drawings and\nin 13% of the boys drawings; 10% of the girls represented\ntwo male friends and only 4% of the boys represented two\nfemale friends.\nPartners' value.The comparison of Value Disparity yielded\nonly a tendencial difference between the RD and FD, Fish-\nvery small and only slightly larger for the romantic partners\nIn the RD, children tended to give more value to the girl-\ngirl valued = 41%, this tendency was independent from chil-\n.65. A higher value of the female partner appeared also in the\nsex was not applicable here, due to the small number of\ncases.\nIdentity of partners. The distribution of answers to the ques-\ntion \"Who are these two characters?\" both for RD and FD is\nshown in Table 1.\nThe frequencies of the identities attributed to romantic\nRomantic couples were mostly composed of \"generic chil-\ndren\" (34%) to whom the interviewees attributed real exis-\ntence or an appropriate name; the second most frequent\ncategory was that of completely imaginary partners, which\nwe could identify as different for gender by the drawings, but\nto whom the child did not provide a name or any other quali-\nfication (28%). Acquaintances (classmates, neighbors) and\nclosely related people (typically participant's friends, and\nsometimes cousins or siblings) were mentioned, respectively,\nadmitted to be one of the depicted characters, with a generic\nchild of the opposite sex (n = 9), a classmate (n = 9), a friend\n(n = 6), and in just one case, the subject's girlfriend.\nAlso, the frequencies of friends' identities were signifi-\nsubject was very often involved (54% in total, with a class-\nmate 31%, with an imaginary child 23%); dyads composed\nby two generic children, two subject's acquaintances or two\nthe total.\nWe found no age differences in the identities attributed to\nthe 2, it was necessary to collapse the frequency of two catego-\nries, \"close relationship\" and \"subject involved,\" due to the small\nfrequency of this last category; the subsequent comparison by\nTable 1.

First of all,\nwe resorted to the Cohesion and Distancing scores to com-\npare the closeness of the two relationships. The variance\nanalysis for repeated measures (scores of Cohesion and Dis-\ntancing in the RD and FD) showed that the overall number of\npictorial cues (M of Cohesion scores and Distancing scores\nin the two drawings) increased with age (5 years: 1.59; 6\nhoc comparisons showed that the scores increased signifi-\ncantly from 5 to 6 years and again from 9 to 10 years. The\nprogression, however, was not identical for Cohesion and\nDistancing, yielding an interaction between age and scale,\nregular for the Cohesion scores, with significant increases\nbetween 5 and 6 years of age and between 9 and 10 years of\nage; for Distancing, instead, the only significant difference\nappeared between 5 and 9 years of age, with non-significant\nfluctuations in the remaining ages.\nConsidering the mean scores of the two drawings,\nCohesion was significantly higher than Distancing\n.001, as shown in Figure 1. Post hoc comparison showed that\nCohesion was significantly higher in the RD, while\nDistancing was significantly higher in FD.\nPlace of meetings.Drawings were not always sufficient to\nunderstand which places children deemed appropriate for\nromantic or friendly meetings, but this issue was clarified\nduring the interview. Several children were unable to locate\nthe partners meetings (24% for the romantic couples; 19%\nfor friends); however, several children provided more than\none possible location. The summed frequencies (n = 278, for\nfriends' meetings; n = 249, for romantic meetings) were only\nqualitatively compared. We found that the most frequent\nplace for children meetings was outdoors, for friends (37%)\nand especially for the romantic partners (47%); the less com-\nmon were public places, such as coffee shops or fast food\nrestaurants (friends = 9%; romantic partners = 11%). The\nsecond most common location was school, both for friends\n(29%) and for romantic partners (26%). Home, instead, was\nindicated quite often as a place for meeting friends (25%),\nbut much more rarely for romantic meetings (16%). All con-\nsidered, children seemed to prefer those places that offer a\ncertain freedom of action (gardens, parks, streets, and some-\ntimes public places) and are not so directly supervised by\nadults, such as schools and especially homes. This was true\nfor friendship, but was more often reported for romantic\nmeetings.\nTo estimate the possible differences by sex and age, we\napplied the 2 to the children's first answers, combining the\nrelatively rare category \"public places\" to the category \"out-\ndoors.\" These comparisons did not yield significant differ-\nand only marginally significant for romantic couples, 2(15)\n= 23.68, p = .07; an analysis of residuals showed that younger\nchildren were more often unable to locate the romantic meet-\nings than were their older peers, who in turn mentioned out-\ndoors/public places slightly more often.\nFeatures of the two relationships in children's verbal\ndescriptions. Finally, we compared the five scores of relation-\nship features obtained in FI and RI with age as an indepen-\ndent variable. This variance analysis with repeated measures\nyielded three main effects: age, FI versus RI, and type of\nrelationship feature. The average score of the five relational\nshowed a significant jump from 5 to 6 years and a slower\nprogression between 6 and 10 years, resulting in a significant\ndifference between 6 and 10 years only. The mean score of\nthe five relational features resulted higher for RI (1.32) than\nsignificant difference between the five relationship features\nfact, activity (.88) was mentioned more often than any other\nfeature, followed by emotions (.65) and proximity (.52);\nthese latter two were significantly more often mentioned\nthan location (.26), which in turn was more frequent than\npersonal characteristics (.17). Finally, an interaction emerged\nbetween relationship features and the two relationships chil-\nThe post hoc comparisons on the data of Figure 2 showed\nthat degree of proximity, emotions, and location was\nFigure 1.

The low frequencies of romantic sub-\ncategories attributed to friendship made not possible to com-\npare six age groups. Age, type of relationship, and type of\naccent yielded three main effects strictly corresponding to\nthose presented above in the paragraph about the relational fea-\ningly, two interactions emerged: type of accent by relationship,\nand type of accent by relationship by age, Fisher's F(1, 268) =\nAll the means of Figure 4 are significantly different from\neach other, but it is evident that romantic relationship admits\nthe basic relational properties of friendship, although friend-\nship is definitely not romantic. In fact, a closer look at the\nsubcodes in each relational feature reveals that the kind of\nlocation was never \"private\" for friends, as happens for\nromantic partners; in addition to their closer contact, three\nquarters of the activities and emotions attributed to the boy-\nfriend\u00adgirlfriend dyad were \"romantic,\" while this happened\nonly rarely for friends.\nFigure 5 shows that older children differ from younger\nonly in the quantity of use of the appropriate accent, both for\nromance and for friendship; instead, the inappropriate use of\nromantic accent to describe friendship is significantly lower\nthan any other score at both ages. A variance analysis with\nthe same design, with sex instead of two age groups as inde-\npendent variable, did not show main effects of sex, but only\na tendential interaction between sex and type of relationship,\nalready shown in Figure 3.\nDiscussion\nThe data presented above demonstrate that 5- to 11-year-olds\ndo not confuse romantic engagement with friendship, lend-\ning support to the findings by Connolly et al. (1999) possibly\nbecause their study also used a contrastive procedure, which\ntends to emphasize differences. However, the open-ended\nverbal questions and the non-leading pictorial task allowed\nchildren also to show similarities when they deemed it appro-\npriate: in fact, differentiation was evident in the features\nattributed to each relationship, but much less evident in the\npartners' characteristics.\nOur hypothesis that friends would be more similar to each\nother than romantic partners did not receive a strong support,\nbesides the fact that RDs always included a boy and a girl\n(but 25% of the FDs did so as well). The partners' ages were\nas highly correlated for romance as for friendship, and the\nValue Disparity was only tendentially higher for romantic\npartners. Moreover, the fact that this disparity was due to a\nhigher valorization of the female figure with respect to the\nmale figure, and that this happened also in those FDs includ-\ning a boy and a girl, make it unlikely that the tendential Value\nDisparity should be attributed to the romantic relationship\nper se. It may be that children's romance still shares more\n\"friendly\" functions than adolescents' and adult's romance\nand has not yet come to the complementarity that is implicit\nin mature sexual roles.\nWe expected that the identity attributed to the depicted\nfriends and romantic partners would help us to detect the\ndegree of direct participant involvement in each of these two\nrelationships. Our hypothesis that children's ideas would not\nbe the reflection of direct romantic experiences gains support\nfrom the fact that participants had more difficulty in attribut-\ning a precise age and identity to romantic partners, as com-\npared with friends. Romance is attributed to imaginary\nchildren more often than friendship, and above all, very\nFigure 2. Scores of relationship features for friendship and\nromance.\nFigure 3. Scores of boys and girls for relational features of\nfriendship and romance.\nCannoni and Bombi 9\nrarely includes the self, which is often represented in the\nFDs. Nevertheless, romantic relationships seem to be part of\nchildren's culture, not only because of the ease with which\nthe participants in this study accepted and completed the task\nof portraying them, but also because the romantic partners\nthey describe are typically children of their same age. This is\nreflected in the characteristics of the boyfriend\u00adgirlfriend\ndrawings even though the participants do not explicitly iden-\ntify themselves with these drawings.\nThe hypothesis that friendship would be presented as an\naffiliative and companionate bond, less intimate and emo-\ntional than romance has been confirmed by several results. In\nthe drawings, friends are portrayed with less Cohesion and\nmore Distancing than boyfriend\u00adgirlfriend dyads, that is,\nwith less indices of partner connection and more cues of inde-\npendence. In the interviews, friendship was characterized\nabove all by shared activities, while emotions, physical prox-\nimity, and search for privacy were much more typical of\nromantic dyads, which children also described as meeting\naway from adult supervision more often than friends. These\nresults are coherent with the notion that \"passionate love\" is\nunderstood by young children (Brechet, 2015; Hatfield et al.,\n1988) and possibly part of their direct experience, even if the\nslightly older mean age attributed to romantic couples might\nbe interpreted as an indication that romance is somehow more\nadult than friendship. The more detailed information obtained\nby comparing the impact of romantic or friendly accent in\nchildren's descriptions of the two relationships showed that\neven if romantic partners share relational activities and emo-\ntions, friends are almost never portrayed as involved in\nromantic situations. This latter result confirms the notion that\nfriendship allows a large variety of shared activities, with the\nexclusion of those carrying a sexual meaning, while a roman-\ntic relationship does not exclude more ubiquitous relational\nfeatures (Carlson, 2006), and is in agreement also with older\nchildren's description (Connolly et al., 1999).\nIn terms of developmental differences, we hypothesized\nthat young children's representations would be less detailed\nthan that of older children. In fact, cues of Cohesion and\nDistancing increase with age, as well as the amount of ver-\nbal information; however, it is worth noting that even the\nsimpler drawings and descriptions of our younger partici-\npants were sufficient to distinguish between romance and\nfriendship.\nFigure 4. Romantic and friendly accent by type of relationship.\nFigure 5. Younger and older children's use of romantic and friendly accent to describe romance and friendship.\nFinally, our expectation of gender differences received\nsome support. Girls provided more information than boys\nabout romance, but were less likely than boys to present\nthemselves in a romantic role. In other words, girls appeared\nmore interested in (perhaps more competent about) romance\nthan boys, but shyer or more defensive about their own\ninvolvement in this type of relationship. This result is coher-\nent with the function of children's romance in their acquisi-\ntion of sex roles as portrayed by the above mentioned\n1986). The fact that girls depicted fairly often a boy\u00adgirl\nfriendship is another gender difference, but which is not easy\nto interpret. Girls, in general, are more diligent in their draw-\ning tasks (Lange-K\u00fcttner, 2011), and it is possible that some\nof them have interpreted the requirement of comparing\nromance and friendship as comparing romance and \"boy-girl\nfriendship,\" in this way, imposing on themselves a more dif-\nficult task. Finally, the pictorial valorization of the female\nfigure in the drawings including mixed dyads was not differ-\nent in boys and girls, and may be the effect of the pictorial\nprocess itself: Characterizing a figure as feminine often\nimplies adding facial details such as evidencing eyelashes or\nreddened cheeks or more elaborated clothes (Cox, 1993).\nConclusion\nWe can conclude, then, that this study addresses a phenom-\nenon which has received up to now little or no attention in\ndevelopmental psychology, even if the first hints of its pos-\nsible relevance date back almost three decades (Hatfield\net al., 1988). Studies focusing on older children (Carlson &\nvance of cross-gender relationships before adolescence as a\nterrain for experiences that prepare children for subsequent\nromantic encounters. It is then noteworthy that even younger\nchildren are attentive to and develop ideas about romantic\nrelationships, even if their direct involvement remains\nquestionable.\nWe believe that drawing has been especially useful to\nexplore young children's ideas of romantic relationships as\ncompared with friendship, not only for what we gathered\nfrom the pictorial representations per se but also for the ver-\nbal information that emerged through comments about their\ndrawings.\nThis study has several limitations. First, it is only a\ndescriptive report, which could have been better understood\nif we had had access to more information about the partici-\npants, especially about the source of their ideas. To answer\nthis question, future research should identify children who\nhave (or who have had in the past) some personal romantic\nexperience, information that could be obtained either through\npeer nomination as in Connolly et al. (1999) or with the help\nof parents and teachers, before collecting drawings and inter-\nviews. Information about children's exposure to romantic\nmodels, especially via TV programs (Valkenburg & Janssen,\nSecond, direct observation of children's behavior in groups,\nas well as indirect information through parents and teachers,\nis still needed to complement the children's reports. Multi-\ninformant studies should be included in the future agenda.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBerndt, T.
