Many were the Africanist histori-\nans who followed up his steps, some opting for more literal\ninterpretations of these traditions, others proposing more\nmetaphorical and analytical approaches (see Miller, 1980).\nThe incursion of the structuralist analysis in the midst of this\ndebate, launched by Luc de Heusch in 1972 with his Le roi\nivre ou l'origine de l'\u00e9tat, brought a complete new universe\nof understanding to these oral narratives--considering them\nas \"myth\" rather than historical sources--and became a pil-\nlar of subsequent studies.\nIn this article, I shall not go into the prolific controversy\nthat opposed historians and structuralists--the latter mainly\nrepresented by de Heusch's writings--in the interpretation of\nthese foundation narratives for I have long taken my standing\ndiscussing--for much the same reason--the extensive litera-\nture that uses oral traditions for the reconstruction of early\nAfrican history (such as in the works of Joseph Miller, David\nSchoenbrun, or Christopher Wrigley, among many others).\nHowever, interest on the motif of the \"stranger-king\"--\nwhich was once considered by Marshall Sahlins (1981) a\nmeans of conflict resolution in the context of foreign colonial\ninfluence in the Pacific--has been re-awaken in anthropo-\nlogical literature, mainly in relation to the Austronesian-\nspeaking world but also in other contexts, African included\n(see Caldwell & Henley, 2008). It is again a very different\napproach from the one I shall take, often drawn from the\nsocial and political spheres. And yet, the minute mythical\nanalysis undertaken here can interact with this latter litera-\nture in that it addresses the basic opposition between the cat-\negories of \"outsider\" and \"insider\", of \"rulers\" and \"those\nwho are ruled,\" on which it relies (see, in particular, Fox,\n2008). Moreover, it is exactly because this is an underlying\nopposition in most of these writings that the theme of the\nstranger-king deserves careful scrutiny by re-analyzing it\nwithin the corpus of oral traditions from which it originally\nstems.\nIn my book Of Alien Kings and Perpetual Kin, I share\nwith de Heusch two main assumptions. The first is that\nCentral African narratives of foundation--the Ruwund\n(Lunda)1 epic, which I studied in detail, included--are of\nmythical and ideological nature. This means that, with de\nHeusch, I steer away from readings of these oral texts as his-\ntorical sources. The second is that Ruwund oral traditions\nshare with other Central African narratives a common frame-\nwork of thinking and, therefore, should be placed and under-\nstood within a wider symbolic continuum. They are, at times,\nable to mutually elucidate each other's meaning.2\nNotwithstanding this convergence, however, I have long\nbeen a critic of the structuralist framework of analysis as\napplied to Central African foundation traditions for I believe\nit inhibits the full understanding of these narratives, as well\n1Universidade do Minho, Braga, Portugal\n2The State University of Zanzibar, Tanzania\nCorresponding Author:\nManuela Palmeirim, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Sociais, Universidade do Minho,\nEmail: mpalmeirim@hotmail.com\nDo \"Culture Heroes\" Exist?

De Heusch\n(2009) believes that \"African sacred kingship is ruled every-\nwhere by the same logic\" and that \"the notion of transforma-\ntion accounts for the incontestable flexibility of the African\nsymbolism\" (p. 122). The question is has de Heusch really\nsucceeded in grasping that \"logic\"?\nI should make here a preliminary statement: Luc de\nHeusch's work has always been an endless source of inspira-\ntion to me. Hence, despite the fact that my studies on the ide-\nologyofkingshipamongtheAruwund(ornuclearLunda)--on\nwhom I worked for more than 20 years--point out the wrongs\nand limitations of the structuralist approach to myth, they can,\nby the same token, be viewed as a tribute to de Heusch--who\nhas left us not long ago--as well as to the immensely fruitful\nhorizons that structural analysis opened up to the study of\nsymbolic thinking and without which my reasoning and argu-\nments would have never gained existence.\nIn his last book, Pouvoir et religion (Paris, CNRS\n\u00c9ditions/\u00c9ditions de la Maison des Sciences de L'Homme,\n2009), de Heusch includes a short text under the title \"La\nroyaut\u00e9 chez les luba et les lunda (r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Manuela\nauthor aims at discussing my approach to Ruwund myths and\nsymbolism as I presented it in 2006, in this way launching in\nwriting a dialogue that we had long pursued in person. The\npresent article wishes to pursue this \"dialogue\"; a dialogue\nwhich I feel can be extremely enlightening of the complexity\nof the symbolic mechanisms that are built, in Central African\ncontexts, around the foundation of kingship, the state, and\nthe motif of the stranger-king. To push such discussion fur-\nther can also draw, I am led to believe, new paths into the\nunderstanding of these overwhelming productions of human\nand collective thinking, which are indeed myths.\nFor the non-specialist reader, let me resume the Ruwund\nepic of kingship origin, which became the center of this\ndebate. This narrative recounts that Ruwund kingship was\nfounded in the sequence of the arrival of a foreign hunter of\nLuba origin, called Cibind Yirung (or Tshibinda Ilunga, in\nsome of the literature), at the lands of the princess Ruwej\n(Lueji). She was then the leader of the Aruwund--organized\nin an egalitarian and simple society based on kinship ties--\nand ruled with the help of her close relatives and fellow\nchiefs, the atubung, at the sacred land of the river Nkalaany.\nHowever, she comes to fall in love with the stranger, to\nwhom she ends up entrusting the symbol of ancestral chief-\nship, a bracelet of human sinew called rukan. In the version\nmost often collected, and that which is most widely told at\nthe Ruwund capital today, Ruwej proves to be sterile after\nmarrying the hunter. Cibind Yirung then marries a second\nwoman, Kamong, with whom a son is conceived. It was the\nson of Cibind Yirung (named Yaav) who would instate a\nmore sophisticated order and become the first king (or para-\nmount chief). He was the first holder of the dynastic title of\nMwant Yaav, a title which was subsequently bestowed upon\nall Ruwund kings.\nIn his Le roi ivre, de Heusch asserts--and I agree with\nhim--that the hunter hero of the Ruwund epic is a homolo-\ngous figure of the hunter of the Luba narrative of foundation,\nMbidi Kiluwe. He also proclaims that Ruwej's order is\nopposed to the new order founded by Cibind Yirung and his\nson. The theme of the sterility of Ruwej (present in some, but\nnot all, versions of the epic) plays here a crucial role as the\nfirst king is indeed Cibind Yirung's son, not Ruwej's. These\ntwo mythical characters engage, for de Heusch, in a radical\nwhich opposes the discourteous, ill-mannered, uncivilized,\nand primitive order of Ruwej and her fellow chiefs called atu-\nbung (an order associated to sterility, the moon, terrestrial\nwaters, and the dry season) to the new and sophisticated order\nrepresented by the hunter hero of Luba origin (who appears,\nin his turn, associated to fecundity, to the sun and celestial\nDe Heusch does sustain that the alliance through marriage\nof Ruwej and Cibind is essential to trigger the emergence of\na new order. However, in the good structuralist manner, he\naffirms this alliance to be one between mutually exclusive\nopposites, doomed of utter symbolic irreconcilability. As a\nconsequence of this interpretation, the new order which was\nnature from that which preceded it, \"a rupture of a sociologi-\ncal kind\" having taken place.\nOther corollaries of this structuralist emphasis on \"oppo-\nsition\" are the ideas that kingship is an order symbolically\nconstrued as coming from outside the primitive society (de\np. 115), in which process Cibind Yirung plays the role of\n\"culture hero,\" the true mentor of social change and bearer of\n192). Ruwej and the autochthonous people, however, are rel-\negated to a passive kind of behavior. The non-cultural profile\nof Ruwej (which, once again, is seen to stress the radical\ndichotomy instituted between the native princess and the for-\neign hunter) would gain sturdier prominence when analyzing\nthe Ruwund epic in the context of a broader \"system of trans-\nformations,\" by means of which Ruwej can be seen as the\nhomologous counterpart of the uncouth and incestuous Luba\nmythical king, Nkongolo.\nOur main point of dissention resides precisely on the\nstress placed by de Heusch on the heuristic and theoretical\nvalidity of the concept of \"opposition\" as capable of supply-\ning the key for the whole understanding of Ruwund (and\nother Central African) symbolic constructs. In my book\n(Palmeirim, 2006, ch. 2 mainly), I point out that de Heusch's\nemphasis on the opposition between the old order of Ruwej\nand the new political system installed by Yirung's son is a\nmere consequence of his structuralist standpoint and that\nRuwund material cannot be straitjacketed into such a rigid\nframework. If opposition and dichotomous thinking indeed\nPalmeirim 3\nappear to be, at times, features of these narratives--and of\nRuwund overall symbolic ideology--the stress on the same-\nness and closeness of both terms of the opposition is equally\nforceful, thereby originating a mythical and symbolic think-\ning of extreme ambiguity and fluidity, and indeed of over-\nwhelming complexity. De Heusch affirms, for instance, that\nwe can oppose the hyperexogamy of Yirung to the hyperen-\ndogamy of Ruwej. However, if Ruwej was indeed engaged--\nin one of the versions that I collected in the field--in a\nrelationship with a close relative of hers before the arrival of\nthe Luba hunter (the dignitary Mwant Rumang), she finally\nengages in a hyperexogamous relation with Cibind Yirung.\nHer profile is, thus, one of ambiguity. De Heusch (2009) is\nready to admit that he has \"no doubt put too much emphasis\non the negative aspects of Ruwej\" (p. 122) based on the idea\nthat Ruwej is a homologous of the Luba hero Nkongolo.\nHowever, then he seems to discard this by attributing it to a\nmechanism of \"inversion\"--again, a mere formal device of\nthe structural model is used to interpret the mythical text.\nIndeed, Ruwund ideological thought constantly plays on\ndifference and likeness, affirming mythical heroes as both\nantagonistic and accomplices, kin and allies, and creating, by\nthis token, a complex of blurred identities that yield the\nduplicity and ambiguity claimed, in my book, to be the very\nessence of Ruwund mythical constructs and kingship ideol-\nogy. The fixity of the structuralist framework cannot capture\nsuch ductility and intricacy of thought. Let me resume here\nsome of my arguments.\nThe Theme of the Sterility of Ruwej\nDe Heusch considers the mytheme of the sterility of Ruwej\ncritical in conveying the sharp opposition between the two\nmythical heroes, the Ruwund princess and Cibind Yirung,\nthe Luba hunter, who assume in the myth the old and new\norders, respectively. Indeed, being sterile in most versions\ncollected (and indeed the ones which are given privilege in\nde Heusch's analysis), Ruwej sees herself unable to conceive\nthe first king and founder of the dynastic title of Mwant Yaav\n(this undertaking is entrusted to Kamong, the hunter's sec-\nond wife). It is as if Ruwej would set herself aside from the\nrise of the new order associated to the foreign hunter, by this\ngesture instating a disjuncture between the autochthonous\norder within which she ruled and the new system that was to\nbe installed after the arrival of the Luba hunter.\nThis interpretation invites us--in line with de Heusch's\nthinking--to build a system of oppositions which would, at\nthe symbolic level, contrast the inferior, ancestral, and\nautochthonous political organization (associated with steril-\nity) to the (so-called) new civilization, brought about with\nthe arrival of the foreigner, more sophisticated and instating\nfecundity. These are indeed the two principles which, accord-\ning to the author, would characterize the dualistic ideology of\nsovereignty in this and other Central African kingdoms. We\nwould thus be facing a perfect dichotomous system of\nthought. Moreover, as a consequence of this structuralist\nframework of analysis--I will stress this once more--the\nrole of Ruwej in the foundation of the new order would of\nnecessity be diminished, the hunter appearing as the \"culture\nhero\" (h\u00e9ros civilisateur), that is, the genuine promoter of\nsocial change and of a more cultured order (de Heusch, 1972,\nHowever, as I tried to demonstrate (Palmeirim, 2006, ch.\n2, in particular), the Ruwund princess is essentially an\nambiguous figure, an ambiguity that challenges rigid dichot-\nomies such as those proposed by de Heusch, as well as a\nmodel of analysis in which the terms of an opposition are in\na relationship of the type a/negation of a. For indeed, the\nRuwund ideology of kingship appears more complex and\nductile than that, moving constantly in the midst of\nambiguity.\nTo begin with, not all versions of the myth of kingship\norigin associate Ruwej with sterility. Variants are there in\nwhich the princess is fertile (Dias de Carvalho, 1890, pp.\np. 23), and, in these, she is clearly in a relationship of con-\njunction, not disjuncture and opposition, with Cibind Yirung.\nI also pointed out that there are different levels of specificity\nin the narration of the myth (Palmeirim, 2006, ch. 1). If nar-\nrators residing at the capital of the kingdom (Musumb) will\nbase their story on the title histories of the main dignitaries\nwho live at the royal court--and might then produce a vari-\nant which stresses Ruwej's sterility--at the periphery of the\nkingdom title histories of minor dignitaries may be included\nin the narration, hence disclosing other facets of Ruwej's\nbehavior. I myself collected in the field accounts which claim\nthat Ruwej had, before the arrival of the foreign hunter, a\nprevious consort from whom she conceived a son (this son is\nnowadays perpetuated at the king's court by the notable with\nthe title of Mutiy). Narrations may indeed incorporate a\nlesser or a greater number of title histories and, by this token,\nbecome more schematic or else richer and more detailed.\nNarrators, however, may also give different emphases to the\nnarration to argue a point or negotiate a position. In this pro-\ncess, they may include, or else omit, certain title histories\nfrom their account. The act of narration is, actually, more of\na dynamic process than we would gather from de Heusch's\nwritings. In addition, if it is true--as de Heusch argues--that\nin the versions in which Ruwej is sterile she places herself in\nclear opposition to Yirung, these very same versions insist\nthat Ruwej's consent is absolutely needed for Yirung to take\nsome variants, it is the princess herself who appoints Kamong\n(a close relative) to conceive, on her behalf, he who would\nRuwej is therefore an equivocal being: She appears to set\nherself aside from the new order (and indeed the dignitary\nwho represents Ruwej at the royal court nowadays is seen as\nrepresenting the ancestral order), and yet she generates all\nthe necessary conditions for its emergence. In Dias de\n4 SAGE Open\nCarvalho's (1890), variant this is particularly obvious: It is\nthe princess who seduces Yirung by offering the hunter her\nown house to stay, and it is her who persuades the atubung,\nthe chiefs with whom she ruled Ruwund land, into accepting\nthe newcomer. In this version--and in others also--it is\nagainst her brothers' will that she hands the sacred bracelet,\nsymbol of power, to the foreign hunter (Dias de Carvalho,\nself who prompts Kamong into marrying the foreigner. The\nrelationship between Ruwej and Cibind Yirung is, thus, from\nthe very first moment, a relationship of complicity, and\nRuwej's willing participation in the whole process is as\ninstrumental as that of Cibind Yirung, whom the literature on\nculture heroes appears to indicate as the sole bearer of the\nnew order.\nThe two spouses of Yirung are thus accomplices in the\nfoundation of kingship. In previous writings (Palmeirim,\nallow us to affirm that Kamong appears in the myth as a mere\n\"double\" of Ruwej, the bigamy of the hunter (also a feature\nof Luba foundation myths) being a way of emphasizing the\ndouble-edged nature that characterizes the attitude of the\nprincess in the Ruwund ideology of kingship. De Heusch\n(2009) is wrong when he implies that a clear opposition\nbetween Ruwej and Kamong is maintained and reinforced in\nthe royal court nowadays by the sterility of the dignitary who\nperpetuates the mythical princess, the notable with the title\nof Nswaan Murund. It might have escaped de Heusch--who\ndid not do fieldwork among the Aruwund--that both the\nNswaan Murund and the Rukonkish (who perpetuates\nKamong) are strictly sterile dignitaries at the court. This fea-\nture, thus, brings them together rather than opposing them.\nAs a matter of fact, the duality of Ruwej is clearly codified\nin the power insignia of the dignitary who represents her now-\nadays at the king's court. The Nswaan Murund's insignia\nexhibits a hybrid nature, including at once elements present in\nthe symbols of office of the atubung, the dignitaries associ-\nated with autochthony and the primitive system, and elements\nthat characterize the regalia of the ayilol, the nobles who rep-\nresent the innovative political and symbolic order. In this way,\nthe princess seems to embody both the egalitarian ideology,\nwhich is a feature of the original system, and the hierarchical\nprinciple characterizing the new order (see Palmeirim, 1998).\nThis very same twofold profile is once more superbly con-\nveyed by the mask representing Ruwej that I have analyzed in\na short text titled As Duas Faces de Ruwej (\"The two faces of\nCokwe artist for a Lunda initiation ceremony and photo-\ngraphed by Manuel Jord\u00e1n during his fieldwork in Zambia in\noriented in opposite directions. As I hope to have shown, the\nmask is indeed the flawless plastic and metaphoric represen-\ntation of the intrinsic ambiguity that I have argued to define\nthe Ruwund ideological thinking concerning royalty and, in\nparticular, the behavior of the mythical figure Ruwej. The\nprincess encompasses, on her own, the whole of the duality\nthat de Heusch attributes to the pair Cibind Yirung/Ruwej.\nShe remains attached to the ancestral order of the atubung\n(only to Ruwej do these chiefs owe any allegiance), and yet\nshe engages, herself or through Kamong (depending on the\nversions we consider), in the inception of kingship; she\ndeclares herself sterile, yet she is fertile in some variants; she\nrepresents the egalitarian principle of the atubung, yet her\ninsignia also exhibits the hierarchical ideology of the innova-\ntive order. As I shall argue next, she can be seen as the king's\nspouse, and yet she is also one of his kin. She is indeed a two-\nfaced heroine for she seems to blur and fade, at times, into the\nfeatures that appeared, at the eyes of de Heusch, to fit in a\nclear-cut manner Cibind Yirung alone.\nUnsolved Paradoxes From the\nStructuralist Point of View\nIt is \"paradoxes\" such as the above that are of impossible\nresolution were we to adopt the structural framework of anal-\nysis. And yet, for the Aruwund, statements that appear con-\ntradictory to the Western mind co-exist peacefully. What is\nescaping our understanding then?\nRuwund mythical figures are perpetuated nowadays--\nthrough a system of \"positional succession\" similar to that\nof Northern Zambia--by living dignitaries who inhabit the\ncapital of the Ruwund kingdom as well as villages in the\noutlying domains. A new incumbent to a \"position,\" or to an\noffice, so to speak, inherits the status and past experiences of\nearlier incumbents, as well as the kinship relationships that\nlinked his predecessors to other titled dignitaries (this sys-\ntem, named \"perpetual kinship\" by Ian Cunnison [1956],\nwas first described by this author for the Luapula peoples or\nEastern Lunda). It is so that the chiefs and close relatives of\nRuwej, who are said in the myth to have ruled with her before\nthe arrival of the foreign hunter, are represented nowadays in\nRuwund land by a set of dignitaries called atubung.\nThe atubung, together with the noble who perpetuates\nRuwej at the court (the Nswaan Murund), embody the\nautochthonous and ancestral power, that is, the original\nsocial system. These chiefs follow an egalitarian ideology\nand set themselves aside the complex and highly hierar-\nchized political system that the first Mwant Yaav, son of\nYirung, would establish with the foundation of kingship and\nthe state. For the \"original chiefs,\" the Mwant Yaav will for-\never remain, as Cibind Yirung himself (his father and prede-\ncessor), a being coming from outside, alien to the primitive\nand local culture that they themselves represent. As a result,\nthe atubung do not participate in the life of the royal court at\nthe capital. They inhabit the distant lands between the rivers\nNkalaany and Kajidij, considered the cradle of the Ruwund\nkingdom and the scenario of the events recalled by the oral\ntraditions as leading to the emergence of kingship.\nPalmeirim 5\nNotwithstanding the fact that the atubung represent an\norder that they often claim to be \"non-submissive\" to that of\nYirung and the Mwant Yaav, they are--\"paradoxically\" once\nmore--the ritual investors of the king. It is the atubung who\nofficiate the healing and purification ceremonies that will\nmake the heir a new king, and it is them who, in the enthrone-\nment ceremony, hand over to the king to be the sacred brace-\nlet, symbol of royal power. The \"opposition\" between the\nautochthonous system and the hierarchy of the new order can\nonly be, therefore, part of the whole picture. It is the atubung\nwho initiate the heir into kingship and the Nswaan Murund,\nthe ultimate representative of the autochthonous order,\nexhibits in her regalia some insignia that connects her directly\nto the new order of the Mwant Yaav (a crown, for instance).\nMost conclusive of all is the fact that the term \"kabung\"\nitself, used to designate a chief who ruled with Ruwej before\nthe arrival of Cibind Yirung, means \"he who performs\nubung,\" that is, \"he who performs the ritual action at a king/\nchief's investiture,\" thus implying that the category of \"atu-\nbung\"--and the term itself--did not exist prior to the instal-\nlation of kingship. The intrinsic overlapping between the two\norders becomes undeniable. Only occasionally--and artifi-\ncially--can they be separated, as they are indeed part of one\nand the same whole.\nThese ritual officers, the atubung, are--just like all other\ntitleholders of the kingdom--linked to each other, and to the\nking, by symbolic kinship ties of a perpetual nature. In trying\nto register, while doing fieldwork, the maze of relations gen-\nerated by the perpetual kinship system, I came across a con-\ntradiction which baffled me. In different moments of the\nresearch--and as I talked to different informants--I had\nwritten in my field books two statements that seemed to me\nentirely irreconcilable. Some of my informants had told me\nthat the atubung were, at the symbolic level, the \"brothers-\nin-law/cousins-in-law\" (ankwed) of the Mwant Yaav. On\nother occasions, however, other--or even the very same\ninformants--would state that they were the king's \"maternal\nuncles\" (amantu). The two avowals sounded to me incom-\npatible: Were they, after all, in-laws of the sovereign, or else\nhis \"maternal uncles\" (and, therefore, of his own kin)?\nHad it not been for the persistence of the Aruwund in\naffirming that both assertions were accurate, I would never\nhave ventured into trying to make them intelligible. But\nindeed, puzzles of this sort are not uncommon when dealing\nwith the system of perpetual kinship. Jeffrey Hoover (1978)\nrefers to this particular feature when he writes,\n. . . perpetual kinship ties among individual titles are not\nstructured in a logical, coherent system. Each title has its own\nmaze of relationships with its peers, ties which become\ncontradictory when pursued as in a once popular American\nsong: \"I Am My Own Grandpa.\" (p. 121)\nContrary to what we could be led to believe at a first\nglance, however, apparently incompatible statements (such\nas the one just mentioned about the perpetual kinship tie\nbetween the atubung and the sovereign) are not the result of\nincoherent and ludicrous thinking. Instead, as I hope to dem-\nonstrate, they form--as well as emanate from--a scrupu-\nlously structured whole, responsible as it were for a vast and\nelaborate array of meanings.\nAs we try to make sense of this twofold symbolic relation\nbetween the atubung and the sovereign, we should be\nreminded that, according to the oral traditions, the first\nMwant Yaav (whom the present incumbent represents) was\nCibind Yirung's son, not the hunter himself. This statement,\nhowever, does not invalidate the fact that the Mwant Yaav is\nequally avowed by the Aruwund to represent Cibind Yirung\nhimself bearing in mind that, being his heir, Yaav identifies\nwith his father (and predecessor) by means of the system of\npositional succession.\nIn the light of what has just been said, the double nature of\nthe tie that unites the king to the atubung becomes easily\nintelligible. Should we consider the Mwant Yaav as the suc-\ncessor of Cibind Yirung, then the dignitary who, at the court,\nrepresents Ruwej is expectedly seen to perpetuate the rela-\ntionship of \"spouse\" of the king. As a consequence, the atu-\nbung, whose perpetual kinship relation toward the princess is\nthat of \"siblings/cousins\" (anamaaku), are \"affines\" (\"broth-\ners-in-law/cousins-in-law,\" ankwed) of the sovereign.\nHowever, should we consider the king as being the son of\nYirung instead (a statement which, due to positional succes-\nsion, makes equal sense to the Aruwund), then Ruwej\nbecomes his maaku (a kinship term used for both \"mother\"\nand \"aunt\"). Even in the versions in which it is Kamong the\nbiological mother of the first sovereign, Kamong's son would\naddress both her mother and Ruwej by the same kinship term\nfor Kamong is said to be Ruwej's \"sister/cousin\" (mwana-\nmaaku). Hence, if Ruwej is maaku of the Mwant Yaav, then\nthe atubung, as her \"brothers/cousins,\" become the king's\nkin (his \"maternal uncles,\" amantu).4\nIn fact, the ambiguity and ductility generated by the per-\npetual kinship system allow Ruwund dignitaries a wide mar-\ngin of maneuvering when in need of stating their link to the\nking and other court notables. But, above all, this ambiguity\nis a vehicle of meaning. As the king's \"brothers-in-law/cous-\nins-in-law,\" the atubung proclaim a relationship of alliance\nor affinity toward the sovereign, in this way emphasizing that\nthe new order installed results essentially from the alliance\nwith a foreigner, an alliance marked by difference. As his\n\"maternal uncles,\" on the contrary, they declare themselves\nengaged in an order in which the king is seen as their close\nrelative, that is, as an autochthonous being, \"son\" of Ruwej\nand, therefore, a direct descendant of the local chiefs (the\natubung) and a native of the original lands at the Nkalaany.\nThe universe of symbolic thinking of the Aruwund takes up\nconstantly the idiom of \"kin and affine,\" of the \"identical\"\nand the \"different,\" to highlight what are two absolutely\ninextricable sides of the same ideology: that the king is both\nan \"outsider\" and \"one of us.\"\n6 SAGE Open\nDo \"Culture Heroes\" Exist?\nHowever, the discourse built on ambivalence, apparent para-\ndoxes, enigmas, and seemingly logical ruptures unveils other\ninsights into the Ruwund ideology of kingship.\nContrasting Ruwej and Cibind Yirung in his analysis, de\nHeusch considers the alien hunter to be what became com-\nmonly named in the specialized literature as a \"culture hero.\"\nIn his view, Cibind Yirung appears as the bearer per excel-\nlence of the new royalty, conceptualized as a more refined\nand culturally higher system of organization. This theme of\nthe \"civilizing hero\" (h\u00e9ros civilisateur) indeed crosses all\nliterature on Central African oral traditions of foundation of\nkinship. As a result--and as an outcome of the structuralist\nstandpoint, as seen before--the contribution of the autoch-\nthonous power to the foundation of kingship is, by opposi-\ntion, minimized, the role of Ruwej being seen of a passive\nkind. De Heusch's argument, consequently, has us believe\nthat kingship is conceived in the myth as an order alien to the\nindigenous population which, coming from outside, pene-\ntrates one other more rudimentary civilization, presided over\nby the Ruwund princess. It is as though the two orders are of\na totally different nature, and the process is essentially car-\nried out by the foreigner himself.\nHowever, whereas the above interpretation--that king-\nship is construed ideologically as an order introduced from\nthe exterior--has indeed clear echoes in Ruwund context,\nthe opposite idea is maintained by the Aruwund with equal\nforcefulness. As a matter of fact, the oral narratives do not\npresent the process of \"foundation\" of kingship as a mere--if\nundesired--submission to a foreigner and the principles of\nan alien civilization. Ruwej is actively involved in the proj-\nect, so I claimed. Also, despite the fact that in some versions\nRuwej is herself willing to entrust the symbol of power to\nmake of the foreign hunter their first sovereign. Kinship ties\nhave to be forged with autochthony, that is with the native\npeople and land, before kingship is founded and a king pro-\nclaimed. The sovereign who inaugurates the dynasty of the\nAnt Yaav is not Cibind Yirung, but his son. Moreover, if the\ndescent from Yirung confers to the king, no doubt, a strong\nelement of otherness, he is also seen as a native being for he\nis able to claim unquestionable links, on the maternal side, to\nRuwej, her sister/cousin Kamong and the original people of\nthe Nkalaany. The Aruwund, hence, find sturdy grounds on\nwhich to contend both the king's alien nature and his filiation\nto the autochthonous culture.\nRuwund ideological thinking, thus, due to its richness and\nintrinsic ambiguity, cannot be made to fit submissively de\nHeusch's statement that the myth conceptualizes the king\nand kingship itself as \"coming from elsewhere\" (as re-\nasserted in his 1991 article). This being so, the concept of\n\"culture hero\"--central as it has become in the relevant lit-\nerature--might call for some serious rethinking.\nFurther to what has been said, Dias de Carvalho's version\nof the myth tells us that Cibind Yirung arrives at the land of\nthe Aruwund in possession of the Luba insignia of royalty\n(the cimbuuy, a small hatchet). However, the hunter explic-\nitly renounces this hatchet (which he returns to his brother in\nLuba country) to embrace instead, as insignia of the new sov-\nereignty, the sacred bracelet of the Ruwund ancestors called\nrukan (Dias de Carvalho, 1890, p. 69). It is therefore in the\nold society of Ruwej and the atubung that Yirung finds the\nultimate source of the \"new\" power!\nIn previous writings, I have set forward a whole argumen-\ntation to justify why, in view of these and other apparently\nparadoxical data, it is no longer legitimate to conclude, with\nde Heusch, that the Ruwund myth speaks of the introduction\nin the sense that the essence of sovereignty would be sym-\nbolically conceptualized as having penetrated from another\ntial to the founding of this renewed order, it is the symbol of\nthe autochthonous power (the bracelet called rukan) that is\ntaken to become the insignia of kingship. Instead, I have\nargued (on the basis of other lengthy empirical data which I\nthis narrative is, in Ruwund symbolic thinking, less of a\n\"foundation myth\" and more a tale on re-creation or re-\nbuilding of the autochthonous society.\nSome Additional Data\nRuwund kingship ideology is not solely characterized by\nblurredness and merging of characters and by the intricate\ninterplay between conjunction-disjunction, fluidity, and\nambiguity. The Aruwund speak constantly of ujindj,\n\"secrecy.\" Statements contained in symbolic formulae and\nthe dignitaries' praise-names (nkumbu) often conceal a dou-\nble reading, a secret meaning which only some are aware of.\nThey are two-faced statements, or else they resort to deceiv-\ning forms that conceal an unspoken truth, not to be disclosed\nto all. Multiple discourses can hide behind each other or\nwithin each other and be constantly played against each\nother. Let me illustrate with some data.\nThe major court dignitary Rukonkish, heir of Kamong\n(the second wife of the hunter who was to give birth to the\nfirst king), is considered the symbolic \"mother/aunt\" (maaku)\nof the sovereign by the perpetual kinship system. However,\nas some of my informants remarked, this perpetual tie aims\nat concealing that the Rukonkish, being the heir of Cibind\nYirung's second wife, is also the sovereign's spouse (as by\npositional succession the king is both the son and the father,\nto whose office the former succeeds). In this view, the\nRukonkish is indeed a rival of the Nswaan Murund, the nota-\nble who represents Ruwej at the court, for they can both be\nseen as \"wives\" of the sovereign. Only by playing down the\nRukonkish's role as \"wife\" and emphasize that of \"mother\"\nPalmeirim 7\ncan the system obscure her importance and elude the clash\nwith Ruwej. In her turn, the heir of Ruwej (the Nswaan\nMurund), who can again be seen as both the king's \"wife\"\nand his maaku (Kamong being Ruwej's sister/cousin), sees\nher first role highlighted in detriment of the second. By doing\nthis, the perpetual kinship system deals with the intrinsic\nambiguity of Ruwund ideological thought. Nevertheless, the\nunderlying complexity remains the knowledge of many and\nis never meant to be completely dissolved. One of my infor-\nmants bluntly stated that the Rukonkish is \"a hidden spouse,\ncloaked as a mother.\"\nRuwej, we saw, is a two-faced heroine. Likewise, two-\nfaced are the chiefs (ayilol) who constitute the group of the\niin mazemb, the descendants of the original people of the\nNkalaany who inhabit the quarters just behind the royal pal-\nace, at the capital. They represent, in Musumb, the Ruwund\nancestors and the local rule and are considered the original\nowners of the rukan. After the death of a king, it is the people\nof the mazemb (with Ruwej) who select the new king, and it\nis their main chief (the Sakawaat Nkwaany) who will occupy\nthe Mwant Yaav's throne during the interregnum. Being the\nsuccessor of Cibind Yirung, the foreign hunter, the king is\nseen by the mazemb as an \"intruder\" in Ruwund land and,\ntherefore, the former represents a constant threat to the\nMwant Yaav. It is from the mazemb that the Ruwund sover-\neign fears betrayal, and this is the reason why the people of\nthe mazemb are praised as ampumb a mazu maad (\"the two-\nfaced traitors\").\nThis built-in ideological conflict between the people of\nthe Nkalaany, said to be at the origin of Ruwund power (and\nconsidered the legitimate holders of its utmost ancestral\nsymbol, the rukan), and the rule which came to be installed\nin association with an alien figure, the foreign hunter Cibind\nYirung, produces an overriding duplicity and concealment in\nthe way praise-phrases of Ruwund dignitaries are often ver-\nbalized and construed.\nThe dignitary from Nkalaany Mwant Kawungul, for\ninstance, is praised as cipepil da mazemb, ikuny wapepa\nkasu, ing kukamekeneaku ant ajim (\"the lighter of the\nmazemb, the man who lit the fire from which the big chiefs\noriginated\"). The fire is inextricably associated with chief-\nship and kingship. It is indeed around the fire, inside the\nseclusion hut called masas, that the heir to an office is to\nundertake the therapeutic process which will make him or\nher a chief, or a king. The ceremony lasts all night, and the\nfire should never extinguish itself. However, this praise is\noften uttered differently by notables at the royal court (at the\ncapital), interested as they are in hiding or minimizing the\nmajor role of this Nkalaany chief, who may be seen to ques-\ntion the decisive and crucial character of Cibind Yirung's\naction in the foundation of kingship. It is so that this nkumbu\nis often recited as cipepil da mazemb, ikuny wapepa kasu ni\nmatakwa (\"the lighter of the mazemb, the man who lit the fire\nwith his buttocks [through the release of intestinal gases, it is\nmeant]\"). Still, disguised in these shameful words, intended\nto ridicule, is the idea that the essence of royalty should ulti-\nmately be traced to the original and autochthonous chiefs of\nthe Nkalaany, not to the foreign hunter, as it could appear at\nfirst sight or be implied on other occasions.\nA Call for a New Approach to Myth\nI have highlighted the main arguments that point to the insuf-\nficiency of the structuralist approach in the analysis of\nCentral African \"foundation myths.\" De Heusch seems to\nthink, however, that my view of the Ruwund narrative as\nconveying more of a \"process of social renewal\" than an \"act\nof foundation\" is an assertion on my part about the specificity\nof the Ruwund epic within the wider set of other Central\nAfrican homologous narratives, which, in his opinion, I fail\nto consider. In his words,\n. . . she refuses to believe that the ideology conveyed by this\nnarrative [the Ruwund epic], recurrent in the rather diverse (fort\ndiverse) mythical history of Black Africa, could be susceptible\nof the same interpretation everywhere. She thinks that the\nprovidential arrival of Tshibinda [\"Cibind,\" in my text] can only\nbe interpreted by going deeper into the Lunda [Ruwund] epic\nitself. She therefore opposes my approach, which consists in\ntaking a look (jeter un regard) at neighbouring peoples or even\nAlthough my analysis in Of Alien Kings was mainly cen-\ntered on Ruwund material, I did not lose sight of neighboring\ncontexts, as I claimed at the beginning of this text. The ambi-\nguity, suppleness, pliability, and blurredness of Ruwund\nmythical characters and discourse, as well as their conse-\nquent disavowal to fit models of a dichotomous nature, are\nnot necessarily a specificity of the Ruwund context. Indeed, I\ndare making the bold suggestion that it might be an intrinsic\nfeature of \"mythical thinking,\" wherever we may find it.\nAllen Roberts, in an article written in 1991, elaborates on\nthe dual nature of Mbidi Kiluwe's plastic representations.\nMbidi Kiluwe is, in Luba oral traditions, the counterpart of\nCibind Yirung in Ruwund narratives. Also a hunter coming\nfrom elsewhere, Mbidi Kiluwe marries--just like his\nhomologous figure--two autochthonous princesses and, by\nthis token, originates a new Luba dynasty founded by his\nson, Kalala Ilunga. The statues representing Mbidi Kiluwe\nare also Janus-faced (Roberts, 1991), just like Ruwej's mask\ncollected by Manuel Jord\u00e1n in Zambia, to which a discourse\non ambiguity is explicitly associated. The latter and similar\nother data make us suspect that deeper fieldwork--and, in\nparticular, one unconstrained by binary models of think-\ning--might indeed reveal data pertaining to analogous con-\nclusions in Central African contexts other than that of the\nAruwund.\nThe structuralist concept of \"opposition\" appears to be\ntoo rigid a concept to be able to grasp the complexity of\nRuwund thinking: mythical heroines who are at once \"moth-\ners\" and \"spouses\" of the king; perpetual titleholders who\n8 SAGE Open\ncan be defined both as the sovereign's \"kin\" and as his \"in-\nlaws\"; a king who is simultaneously declared an alien and a\nnative, the son, and the father; an order in which power can\nbe viewed as \"coming from outside\" as well as generating\n\"from within\"; autochthony both preceding and being the\noutcome of kingship. It is indeed as if the ideological uni-\nverse of the Aruwund would claim this intrinsic ambiguity\n(what to Western eyes appears as \"contradiction\" or sheer\n\"paradox\") as the very mechanism on which their thinking is\nbuilt. Derrida's deconstruction of the logic of opposition\nbased on the endlessly imbricated interplay between dif-\nf\u00e9rence and diff\u00e9rance could find here solid grounds for exis-\ntence: Signs forever merging and overlapping each other;\nsigns that appear to produce--and yet are also the effect--of\nother signs. In this philosophical frame, kingship could be\nsaid \"autochthony deferred,\" \"the other deferred,\" as the\n\"old\" order is simultaneously the origin and the effect of the\ninstallation of the \"new\" order.5\nOne cannot play down such lushness of data (along with\nall the intricate and subtle meanings it conveys) in the name\nof a comparative structural analysis with \"homologous\" con-\ntexts. Instead, meticulous attention has to be devoted to this\nkind of material, and new research in contexts neighboring\nthe Aruwund may indeed unveil similar mechanisms of\nthought. In fact, authors working with mythological con-\nstructions in geographical areas very distant from the Central\nAfrican contexts have disclosed ways of building mythical\nthinking that recall--and some even resemble--those\npointed out here for the Aruwund. Manuel Ramos (2006), for\ninstance, points out similar mechanisms in Christian mythol-\nogy epitomized in the merging of the God-Father (the\nCreator) and the God-Son (Jesus Christ, the Savior). In the\ncontext of Indian narratives, Gomes da Silva (2010) talks of\ncharacters fading into one another, about \"consubstantiality\"\nof apparently opposed mythical heroes and deities repeatedly\ninvolved in tales of \"mutual creation\" or \"mutual parent-\nhood\" (pp. 88, 162, for example), about stories built within\nstories. Indianist authors try to grasp the astounding intricacy\nof devices used in the creation of mythical thought in oral\nand written texts by resorting to such multifaceted configura-\ntions as the hologram (Gomes da Silva) or the growth of\ncrystal strata (Ramanujan, cited by Gomes da Silva, 2010).\nBlurredness, ambivalence, \"consubstantiality,\" fluidity, and\nsuppleness appear to constitute, in Central Africa as else-\nwhere, the array of logical and symbolic instruments able to\nconvey--as well as create and recreate--the prodigious\nintricacy and sophistication of meanings that emanate from\nmythological thinking.\n"
