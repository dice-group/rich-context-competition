Much of the focus is on the preva-\nlence and correlates of binge drinking. Relatively few studies explore reductions in drinking,\nand these generally focus on reductions that occur during college.\nAims: We examined the transition between high school and college and sought to understand\nthe characteristics and behaviors of students that are related to reductions in the consumption\nof alcohol during this transition.\nMethods: We used data from all four rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health's College\nAlcohol Survey and logistic regression models to relate the status of reduced alcohol consump-\ntion to five groups of variables: demographic and parental variables, other substance use, social\nenvironment, student activities, and alcohol policies.\nResults: A number of characteristics were related to reductions in drinking. Students whose\nfathers did not attend college were more likely to reduce alcohol consumption (odds ratio\nor heavy (OR =0.72; CI =0.53\u00ad0.96) drinkers were less likely to reduce alcohol consumption.\nConclusion: The results highlight the importance of family background and social environ-\nment on reductions in drinking.\nKeywords: binge drinking, College Alcohol Study, college drinking, reductions in alcohol\nconsumption\nIntroduction\nHigh rates of alcohol consumption among college students have been shown to have\nsignificant consequences.1\u00ad5 For example, alcohol-related deaths among 18 to 24-year-old\ncollege students in the United States are estimated to have increased from 1,442 in 1998\nsome type of assault by other students who had been drinking.5 Of particular concern\nis \"binge drinking\", defined throughout this paper as the consumption of five or more\ndrinks by men and four or more drinks by women on one occasion. Using this definition,\nsurveys of US college students indicate that over 40 percent are binge drinkers.6\nA number of studies have looked at factors associated with increases in drinking\nbetween high school and college in the US. These studies consider, for example, the\ninitiation of any drinking7 and the initiation of binge drinking8 between high school and\nfreshman year of college; lifetime exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs and\nThis article was published in the following Dove Press journal:\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation\nNumber of times this article has been viewed\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nSwann et al\nsubsequent patterns of use before and during college;9 and\nincreases in men's drinking behavior, including binge \ndrinking,\nbetween high school and the first month of college.10\nDespite the potential to learn about students' drinking\nbehavior by studying students who reduce their consumption,\nthere are relatively few studies of reductions in drinking, and\nmost of these consider reductions that occur during college\nrather than during the transition to college.These include US\nstudies of changes in alcohol consumption during college\nallowing for increases and decreases in consumption11 and of\nthe cessation of binge drinking.12 Research has also explored\nthe roles of alcohol education, social norms campaigns,\nalcohol counter-marketing, and alcohol control policies on\nUS colleges and universities in reducing consumption by\ncollege students during college.13\nIn contrast to these studies of reductions during college,\na few studies consider reductions between high school and\nfactors associated with changes in binge drinking behavior\nbetween high school and college and found that approxi-\nmately 15 percent of all students were binge drinkers in high\nschool but not in college. Of students who were binge drink-\ners in high school, 31 percent were categorized as not being\nbinge drinkers in college. Their analysis found that social\nvariables such as networks of friends and the importance of\nparties were significant factors in continuing versus stopping\nbinge drinking in college.\nIn a similar spirit, we seek to identify the characteristics\nand behaviors of students that are related to reductions in\nalcohol consumption between senior year of high school and\nfreshman year of college. It is important to understand this\nrelationship because, as noted by Reifman and \n\"... to get high school binge drinkers to abandon this\n\nbehavior, health educators should know the psychosocial\nfactors that are associated empirically with transitions in\nstudent drinking.\" In comparison with this earlier study,\nwhich was based on data from a single school, our analysis\nuses all 4 years of the Harvard School of Public Health\n\nCollege Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative data\nsource, and we expand our analysis to include non-binge\ndrinkers, thereby allowing us to study reductions in alcohol\nconsumption by all drinkers.\nMethods\nand 2001 rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health's\nCollege Alcohol Survey.6,16\u00ad18 Each year, surveys were sent\nto random samples of students at up to 140 universities and\ncolleges in the US. Over the 4 years, the number of schools\ninformation on student life, beliefs about alcohol policies,\nown alcohol consumption, use of alcohol by other students,\nother personal behaviors, student activities, and background\ninformation.\nMeasures of alcohol consumption\nRespondents were asked two questions about their alcohol\nconsumption during senior year of high school. The first\nquestion asked how many times a month the student usually\nconsumed alcohol, and the second asked the number of drinks\nusually consumed. We consider students who report never\ndrinking when answering both questions to be \"nondrinkers\"\nduring high school. Female students who usually consumed\nfour or more drinks and male students who usually consumed\nfive or more drinks are considered high school binge drinkers.\nAlthough binge drinking typically refers to occasional rather\nthan usual behavior, we call high school students who usually\nconsume four or five drinks binge drinkers for consistency\nwith the description of college drinkers. Those who drank\nbut did not usually binge drink are considered high school\nnon-binge drinkers.\nAdditionally, a number of questions were asked about\nalcohol consumption during college. Students were asked how\nmany times they consumed exactly four drinks or five or more\ndrinks within the past 2 weeks. Women who had consumed\nfour or more drinks and men who had consumed five or\nmore drinks are classified as binge drinkers during freshman\nyear. Students who did not binge drink but who had reported\nconsuming alcohol within the past 30 days are classified as\nfreshman non-binge drinkers, and students who had not con-\nsumed alcohol within the past 30 days are classified as fresh-\nman non-drinkers. Questions about non-binge drinking were\nasked, with recall periods of 1 week and 30 days, and most\ndrinking over 30 days rather than 1 week.\nGiven these definitions, a reduction in drinking can\nhappen in one of three ways. First, a student who drinks\nbut does not usually binge drink in high school can stop\n\ndrinking. \nSecond, a student who binges in high school can\nstop drinking. Third, a student who usually binge drank\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation 2014:5 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nReductions in alcohol use between high school and college\nduring senior year can cut back to non-binge drinking. We\ndo not distinguish among these different changes. Across\nall 4 survey years, we find that 11.3 percent of all students\n(including those who do not drink) reduced drinking between\nsenior year of high school and freshman year of college,\nand that 21.6 percent of high school binge drinkers reduced\ntheir consumption during freshman year. These figures are\nsimilar to, but smaller than, those reported by Reifman and\nExplanatory variables\nIn the existing literature, explanatory variables are typically\ngrouped into a number of categories where the specific\ncategories depend on the question of interest. Because we\nare exploring a number of different possible relationships,\nwe use variables from a number of different categories:\nother substance abuse,9 the consequences of other students'\nalcohol use,6,16\u00ad18 the social environment (including living\nalcohol policy and exposure to alcohol education.8,13\nBackground variables include indicators for male; race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-\nHispanicAsian, non-Hispanic other race, and Hispanic); reli-\ngion (catholic, protestant, other religion, and not religious);\nwhether the student reported that the student's mother or\nfather was not a drinker or was a light, moderate, or heavy\ndrinker; whether the student's family approved of alcohol\nuse; and whether the student's mother or father had a high\nschool education or less.\nAlthough students were asked to provide only one race,\na handful of individuals provided more than one answer.\nBecause there were not enough of these individuals to include\na separate category for multiple race, race for these individu-\nals is coded as the category having the least representation\nin the data. In the analysis below, female is the omitted\ncategory for sex, non-Hispanic white for race/ethnicity, not\nreligious for religion, and mother and father not drinking for\nthe parental drinking variables.\nTo allow for the fact that some substances may be comple-\nments, we next considered the use of cannabis, cigarettes, and\npowder cocaine. For each of these substances, two variables\nwere created. The first indicates that the student has never\nused that substance, and the second that the student has used\nit within the past 30 days. Thus, for each substance, the base\ngroup is students who have used the substance at some point\nin their lives but not in the past 30 days. Additionally, to\ncapture the possibility that negative consequences of others'\nbehavior may affect reductions, we include an indicator\nof whether the drinking of others led to the student being\npushed, hit, or assaulted, and an indicator of whether the\ndrinking of others resulted in an argument.\nSocial variables include the number of good friends a\nstudent reports having (categorized as zero to two, three or\nfour, and five or more), whether the student reports knowing\na faculty member or administrator to whom he or she could\ntalk about problems, membership in a fraternity or sorority,\nand living in a coed dorm, other on-campus housing, off\ncampus but not with parents/other relatives, and off campus\nwith parents/other relatives. Other social variables include\nindicators equal to one if participation in parties or fraternity/\nsorority life is very important or important to the student, an\nindicator equal to one if the student has had multiple sexual\npartners in the past 30 days, and the average number of hours\nper day spent on social activities.\nA number of variables measure participation in, and atti-\ntudes toward, student activities. These include the average\nhours per day studying, working for pay, watching television,\nworking with organizations, engaging in physical activity,\nand volunteer activities. Each of the time use variables is\nare indicators for whether it is important or very important\nfor the student to participate in academic work, religious\nactivities, the arts, or political activities.\nThe last group of variables measures whether the stu-\ndent believes that the legal drinking age should be less\nthan 21 years, his or her exposure to a number of alcohol\neducation messages, and the avenues through which the\nalcohol education was received. The alcohol education\nmessages include information about where to obtain help\nwith alcohol problems, the long-term effects of alcohol use,\nthe dangers of alcohol use, and how to recognize problems\nwith alcohol.The ways in which the messages were received\ninclude attending lectures, meetings, or workshops; mailings\nor handouts; posters or signs; announcements or articles in\nstudent newspapers; or through a special course on alcohol\nand other student life issues.\nStatistical methods\nSampling weights are available in the College Alcohol\nSurvey, and all analyses use these weights. The statistical\nanalysis was conducted using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP,\n\nCollege Station,TX, USA) using the svy suite of commands\nto accommodate the nonrandom sampling.\nTwo approaches were used to analyze the data. The first\nis a comparison of proportions (except for a few \nvariables\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nSwann et al\nmeasuring time spent in various activities, which are \nmeasured\nin hours) for students who do and who do not reduce their alco-\nhol consumption using the \"svy: mean\" command in Stata. For\neach variable included in the analysis, we tested the hypothesis\nthattheaverageforthegroupthatreducesconsumptionisequal\nto the average for the group that does not reduce consumption,\nand we report the P-value for each hypothesis test. Hypothesis\ntesting is conducted using the \"test\" command in Stata. The\nresults of this analysis are reported in Table 1.\nTesting for differences in proportions ignores the fact\nthat many of these characteristics are related to each other,\nand we use a logistic regression model to allow for multiple\nvariables to jointly affect the decision to reduce drinking\nor not. The explanatory variables are entered in groups. As\ndescribed previously, the groups of variables (background\ncharacteristics, other substance use, the consequences of\n\nothers'alcohol use, social environment, student activities, and\npolicies) are motivated by the previous literature. The order\nof inclusion moves broadly from more personal variables\n(eg, background and substance use) to variables that measure\nuniversity activities (eg, policy variables). Logistic regression\nmodels are estimated using the \"svy: logit\" command.\nThe results of logistic regressions are reported as odds\nratios (ORs).An OR greater than 1 indicates that an increase\nin the characteristic is associated with an increase in the odds\nof cutting back on alcohol, whereas an OR less than 1 indi-\ncates that an increase in the characteristic is associated with\na decrease in the odds of reducing alcohol consumption. In\naddition to the OR, the tables include 95 percent confidence\nintervals for each OR, and the P-value for the hypothesis test\nthat the OR is equal to 1.\nThe results are reported inTables 2\u00ad6.Table 2 reports the\nresults of a model that includes only background variables,\nand Tables 3 through 6 each add one group of variables\nin turn. Each model includes all of the variables included\nin the previous models, but, to conserve space, the tables\nreport only the OR for the newly added variables. To assess\nwhether the groups of previous variables remain statisti-\ncally relevant, each table includes an F-statistic for each\npreviously added group of variables. The null hypothesis\nis that the OR for each variable in the group under test is\njointly equal to 1.\nDescriptive statistics\nWe limited our analysis sample to students who are 18 or 19\nyears old, unmarried, and not missing data on key variables.\nBecause we wished to understand reductions in alcohol\nconsumption between high school and college, the analysis\nsample was also limited to students who reported drinking\nalcohol during their senior year of high school.The resulting\n(n=1,101) reduced their alcohol consumption as previously\neither continued to drink at their previous level (eg, was\na non-binge drinker in both high school and college) or\nincreased their consumption in college (eg, was a non-binge\ndrinker in high school and a binge drinker in college).Table 1\nprovides descriptive statistics for those who reduced their\nalcohol consumption and those who did not.The two samples\ndiffer significantly in almost all characteristics considered.\nFor example, students who reduced consumption were more\nlikely to be female, less likely to be white, more likely to have\nparents who did not approve of drinking, and more likely to\nabstain from other substance use.\nResults from adjusted logistic\nregression models\nDemographic and parental variables\nTable 2 presents the results of the adjusted model, which\nincludes the demographic or background variables.\nThe results indicate that being male and catholic or another\nreligion was associated with lower odds of reducing alcohol\nconsumption. Compared with having parents who abstained,\nstudents with parents who drank moderately or heavily had\nlower odds of reducing their alcohol consumption. In contrast,\nbeing Asian, Hispanic, or black (relative to non-Hispanic\nwhite); having parents who disapprove of alcohol consump-\ntion; and having a father who did not attend college were all\nassociated with increased odds of cutting back on alcohol\nconsumption.\nOther substance use\nWe next added variables describing the student's use of other\nsubstances and his or her experience with the consequences\nof other students' drinking during college. These results are\npresented in Table 3. Having never smoked marijuana or\nused cocaine was associated with increased odds of reduc-\ning alcohol consumption, whereas having smoked ciga-\nrettes or marijuana in the past 30 days decreased the odds.\nHaving been hit or assaulted by, or in an argument with,\nsomeone due to their drinking was associated with lower\nodds of reducing consumption. Although the ORs for the\nbackground variables are not displayed, the results for the\nbackground variables were generally similar to those in\nTable 2, and the background variables remained jointly\n\nstatistically significant, as measured by the F-statistic.\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation 2014:5 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nReductions in alcohol use between high school and college\nTable 1 Descriptive results by alcohol consumption statusa\nCut back Did not cut back P-value\nProportionb Standard error Proportionb Standard error\nDemographic and parental\nOther substances and consequences of others' use\nSocial environment\nStudent activities\n(Continued)\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nSwann et al\nTable 2 Adjusted logistic regression of reduced alcohol\nconsumption: background variablesa\nVariable Adjusted\nodds ratio\ninterval\nP-value\nParents do not approve\nof alcohol\nF-statistic \u00ad background\nvariables\nNote: aDependent variable is equal to 1 if the student reduces alcohol consumption\nand 0 otherwise. n=5,106.

Relatively few of the student activi-\nties variables were statistically associated with reductions in\ndrinking. Believing that participating in community service\nactivities is important or very important was associated with\nan increase in the likelihood of drinking less, as was time\nspent working and watching television. The effects of the\npreviously considered variables were largely unchanged.\nPolicy variables\nFinally, Table 6 adds variables describing alcohol education\npolicies the student has been exposed to, the setting in which\nthe student has been exposed to these messages, and the stu-\ndent's belief about whether the legal drinking age should be\nless than 21 years. Students who believed that the drinking\nage should be less than 21 years were significantly less likely\nto reduce their alcohol consumption (recall these students\nare all 18 or 19 years old). The only statistically significant\neffect of alcohol education was that receiving information\nthrough posters on campus reduces the likelihood of drink-\ning less.The F-statistics showed that each group of variables\nremained statistically related to reductions in consumption,\neven with all other variables included.Although ORs are not\nreported for all of the variables for each of the models, we\nnote that being male, having a mother who was a moderate\ndrinker, having a mother who was a heavy drinker, never\nhaving smoked marijuana, and living off campus were no\nlonger statistically related to reducing alcohol consumption\nin the full specification, even though they were in earlier\nspecifications.\nPredicted probabilities\nEstimates from the logistic regressions can be used to con-\nstruct predicted probabilities for different combinations of\nexplanatory variables.As an alternative way to characterize\nsome of the results, we construct predicted probabilities for\nTable 4 Adjusted logistic regression of reduced alcohol\nconsumption: social environmenta\nVariable Adjusted\nodds ratio\ninterval\nP-value\nHave 5 or more good\nfriends\nKnow a faculty member\ncould talk to\nMember of fraternity\nor sorority\nMultiple sexual partners\nFraternity/sorority life\n(very) important\nF-statistic \u00ad substance\nuse variables\nF-statistic \u00ad background\nvariables\nNote: aDependent variable is equal to 1 if the student reduces alcohol consumption\nand 0 otherwise. n=5,106.

However, the average predicted probabilities\nwere not statistically different from each other, as measured\nby the 95% confidence intervals represented by the \"error\nbands\" in the figure.\nThe remaining two bars show the probabilities assuming\nfirst that all students have a father who did not attend college\nand then assuming that all fathers had at least some college\neducation.

Across all models, we found\nthat the odds of reducing alcohol consumption were signifi-\ncantly higher for Asian and African-American students and\nfor students whose fathers did not attend college. The odds\nof reducing alcohol consumption were significantly lower for\nstudents whose fathers were moderate or heavy drinkers, and\nthere is some evidence that it was lower for students whose\nmothers were moderate drinkers. Additionally, we found\nsome evidence that male students have lower odds of reduc-\ning alcohol consumption. Because being male is frequently\nfound to be a risk factor for increases in drinking,26 it is\nnotable that the effect of being male weakened in magnitude\nand statistical significance as other predictors were added to\nthe model, and became statistically insignificant at conven-\ntional levels in the final specification (not reported inTable 6,\nOur finding that the odds of reducing alcohol consump-\ntion were significantly higher for students whose father did\nnot attend college is notable and might reflect a number\nof things. First, because we do not control for family income,\nthis result may capture an inverse relationship between family\nincome and the probability of reducing alcohol consumption.\nSecond, our finding may reflect differences in attitudes and\nexpectations about the college experience for those students\nwhose fathers did not attend college versus those whose\nfathers did. It is worth further investigating why this is the\ncase, because this finding persisted even after controlling for\nmany other characteristics.\nOur results further suggest that recent use of cigarettes and\nmarijuana lowered the odds of reducing alcohol consump-\ntion, whereas recent use of cocaine was not associated with\nreductions. At the same time, students who had never used\ncocaine were significantly more likely to reduce their alcohol\nconsumption. These results suggest that using cocaine was\ndifferent from using the other substances and that drinking\nalcohol and smoking either tobacco or marijuana tended to\noccur together. Although we are unable to disentangle the\ntiming of exposure to different substances, there is evidence\nthat exposure to alcohol is almost universal by college (with\ntobacco and marijuana not far behind), whereas exposure to\ncocaine is much lower.9 Interestingly, negative consequences\nof others' drinking appeared to reduce the likelihood of\ncurtailing alcohol consumption. This result likely reflects a\nreverse causality where heavy drinkers were exposed to more\narguments and other negative consequences.\nConsistent with the previous literature, we find that the\nsocial environment matters a great deal for drinking \nbehavior.\nThe variable with the largest effect on maintaining or increas-\ning drinking levels from high school was having the attitude\nthat it is important or very important to participate in parties\nduring college.Also significant were membership in a Greek\norganization, believing that participating in fraternity and\nsorority life was important or very important, having five\nor more good friends, living in a coed dorm, and spending\nmore time in social activities. These results were robust to\nthe inclusion or exclusion of additional control variables.\nIn contrast to the relationship between drinking and atti-\ntudes toward parties and Greek life, there was little relation-\nship between student priorities and activities and reductions\nProbability of reducing alcohol\nconsumption\nFemale,\nno Greek,\nno party\nMale,\nno Greek,\nno party\nFemale,\nGreek,\nno party\nMale,\nGreek,\nno party\nFemale,\nno Greek,\nparty\nMale,\nno Greek,\nparty\nFemale,\nGreek,\nparty\nMale,\nGreek,\nparty\nFigure 2 Estimated effects of sex, Greek affiliation, and the importance of parties.\nNotes: Greek indicates membership in a social fraternity or sorority and belief that participation in Greek life is important or very important.

It is\nperhaps not surprising to find that working more was associ-\nated with a reduction in drinking, but it is also the case that\nspending more time watching television was associated with\na reduction in drinking.\nThe strong finding that students who believed that the\nlegal drinking age should be less than 21 years old were less\nlikely to reduce their alcohol consumption is consistent with\nthe literature and reinforces the theory of social norms where\nthe students believe that the normative behavior should be the\nsame as their behavior.\nLimitations\nIt is important to keep in mind a number of limitations of\nour analysis. First, although we used 4 years of data, our\nanalysis was fundamentally cross-sectional with retrospec-\ntive reporting of high school alcohol use. To the extent that\nstudents did not accurately remember their consumption\nof alcohol or chose to misrepresent it, the analysis will be\nbiased. Second, the measures of alcohol used and the time\nframes covered varied between high school and college and\nfor binge and non-binge drinking in college. High school\ndrinking was constructed from questions asking about usual\ndrinking behavior during senior year of high school, whereas\ncollege drinking behavior was assessed more precisely over\nthe previous 2 weeks or 30 days. Students categorized as\nbinge drinkers in high school were those who reported \nusually\nbinge drinking, and there may have been students who occa-\nsionally binge drank in high school who were not counted\nas binge drinkers. However, measurement error in classify-\ning the level of drinking was somewhat moderated because\nwe were looking at reductions in drinking. Thus, a student\nwho was an occasional but not usual binge drinker was still\nincluded in the analysis. Third, as noted earlier, we grouped\ntogether students who were high school binge drinkers and\ncollege non-binge drinkers, students who were high school\nbinge drinkers and college abstainers, and students who were\nhigh school non-binge drinkers and college abstainers. To\nthe extent that different characteristics affected those groups\ndifferently, those distinctions were lost in this analysis.\nFourth, because we used cross-sectional data without\n\nrandomization over any of the explanatory variables such as\nalcohol policies and membership in Greek organizations, we\nwere unable to uncover causal relationships. Finally, given\nthe exploratory nature of our secondary data analysis, we\ncould not conduct a priori power analyses, so it is possible\nthat some of our results are underpowered.\nConclusion\nHigh rates of alcohol consumption have been shown to have\nsignificant consequences for college students, including\nassaults and deaths. Consequently, a significant amount of\nresearch has investigated the individual, family, and school\ncharacteristics that are associated with increases in drinking\nbefore and during college.A smaller number of studies exam-\nined the factors associated with decreases in consumption\nduring college. We explore the characteristics and behaviors\nassociated with reductions in alcohol consumption between\nhigh school and college.\n2001 rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health College\n\nAlcohol Survey. Twenty-two percent of the sample reduced\ntheir consumption of alcohol between high school and\n\ncollege. We group the explanatory variables as demographic\nand parental background characteristics, other substance use,\nsocial environment, student activities, and alcohol education\n\nexperience. Using logistic regression models, we find that a\nnumber of characteristics, including race, father's education,\nsmoking tobacco and marijuana, the social environment, and\nattitudes toward alcohol policy, affect reductions in drinking.\n"
