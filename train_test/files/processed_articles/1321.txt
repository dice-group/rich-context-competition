Mays4\n Introduction\n\"Living Apart Together\" (LAT) relationships are gaining visibility in Western countries\namong scholars and the general public (ABC News 2006, Brooks 2006, Casper et al.\nbetween unmarried partners who live in separate households but identify themselves as\npart of a couple. These relationships are sometimes referred to as \"non-residential\npartnerships\" (Castro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and Mart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2008).\nReasons for forming LAT relationships are diverse and are likely to vary across\nthe life course (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008). Some young\ncouples may intend to marry, but live apart due to the constraints of school and the\nlabor market (Levin and Trost 1999). Others form non-residential partnerships as part\nof the dating process; typically, these unions involve less long-term commitment. In\nolder age, individuals may choose to live apart from their partners to facilitate contact\nwith adult children from previous unions and to maintain privacy and autonomy (de\nthemselves may be uncertain about what their relationship means (Castro-Mart\u00edn,\nDom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and Mart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2008).\nIn addition to life course variation in the reasons for forming LAT relationships,\nthere also may be differences by sexual orientation. Lesbians and gay men may live in\nseparate households to maintain privacy about their relationship, to facilitate an\negalitarian partnership, or to foster intimacy while remaining self-sufficient (Peplau and\nCochran 1990, Weston 1997). Sharing a residence might also be a less defining feature\nof same-sex relationships because childrearing is less common among same-sex couples\nNew data, such as from the Generations and Gender surveys, are accumulating to\ndescribe LAT relationships in Europe (Vikat et al. 2007), but U.S. data on non-\nresidential partnerships remain very limited. Most U.S. surveys solely collect data on\ncouples who live together, which prevents researchers from distinguishing individuals\nwho are single from those in LAT unions. The dearth of data on LAT relationships in\nthe United States is matched by the limited national data on couple relationships among\nlesbians and gay men. The most widely used national data on same-sex couples come\nfrom the U.S. census, which cannot identify individuals in unmarried non-residential\npartnerships, regardless of sexual orientation. The U.S. census also lacks information\nabout sexual orientation that would allow researchers to compare single lesbians and\ngay men to those in unions.\nMotivated by the limited data on LAT unions in the United States, and especially\namong lesbians and gay men, we address three questions in this paper: Who is in a non-\nresidential union and are these relationships more common among lesbians and gay\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 179\nmen than among heterosexual women and men? What are the attitudes and values of\nindividuals in non-residential unions? Finally, what emotional and instrumental benefits\nare LAT relationships likely to provide when compared to the benefits individuals\nreceive when they live with a partner? We use data from the 1996 and 1998 General\nSocial Surveys supplemented by data on lesbians, gay men, and heterosexual women\nand men from the 2004-05 California Quality of Life Survey I.\nWe begin by contextualizing the rise of non-residential partnerships in Western\ncountries, describing variation in LAT unions, summarizing U.S. research about LAT\nrelationships, and considering the potential importance of LAT relationships among\nlesbians and gay men. The next sections describe our data, methods, and results. We\nconclude by speculating about the significance of LAT relationships for contemporary\nfamily life, as well as considering the conceptual and methodological issues that must\nbe addressed to learn more about LAT unions in the United States.\n2. Background\n2.1 Living apart together and the Second Demographic Transition\nThe label \"Living Apart Together\" challenges the longstanding assumption of most\nWestern demographic research that two people must live in the same household to be\nconsidered a couple.5 Sharing a residence signals commitment, facilitates the sharing of\nexpenses and work of daily life, and fosters intimacy. Individuals in LAT unions,\nhowever, also treat the relationship with their partner as important and identify as being\npart of a couple even though their partner lives in a separate household (Bawin-Legros\nand Gauthier 2001, Haskey and Lewis 2006). LAT relationships appear to be part of the\nSecond Demographic Transition, which marked a change in the demography and\nmeaning of couple relationships in Western societies. These changes include the rise in\nsexual relationships outside of marriage, increases in non-marital cohabitation, and high\nrates of divorce \u00ad the behavioral manifestations of a long-term normative shift toward\nindividualism and egalitarianism (Lesthaeghe 1995, van de Kaa 1987). Although the\nSecond Demographic Transition is characterized by a decline in lifelong marriages, the\nrise of non-marital cohabitation suggests that individuals are not rejecting partnerships\nper se. They still seek significant intimate relationships, but not necessarily marriage or\nrelationships that involve sharing a household.\n5In contrast, \"visiting\" unions in non-Western cultures have long been recognized (e.g., Ariza and de Oliveira\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n180 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographers' attention to cohabitation might have increased the salience of the\ndistinction between being a part of a couple and living together, and thus indirectly\nfostered new data collection on LAT relationships (Bawin-Legros and Gauthier 2001).\nThese emerging data show that in a wide range of countries there are small but\nsignificant percentages of people who have LAT partners (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier,\nand Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Caradec 1996, Castro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and\nFertility and Family Surveys, Kiernan (2000, Table 3.3) finds that the prevalence of\nLAT relationships among women 20-39 years old who have never married or cohabited\nranges from 32% in France to 47% in Switzerland. Notably, non-residential unions\noccur in settings in which cohabitation is institutionalized, such as in northern Europe\n(Levin 2004, Levin and Trost 1999), as well as in southern Europe where cohabitation\nis relatively uncommon (Castro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and Mart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda\noccurrence of LAT unions.\n2.2 Variation in living apart together unions\nEstimates of the prevalence of non-residential partnerships vary, suggesting that stage\nin life, attitudes, social and economic constraints, and cultural context affect the\nformation and stability of non-residential partnerships (Castro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-\nmore likely to be in LAT relationships than are older people (Beaujouan, Regnier-\nLoilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008 for France, Haskey 2005 for Britain, Milan and\nPeters 2003 for Canada). Compared to those who are older, young people in LAT\nrelationships are more likely to live with other adults, often their parents (Haskey\n2005). Young people are also more likely to expect to live with their partner in the\nfuture (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Milan and Peters\n2003), suggesting that LAT relationships among the young are often a step on the\npathway to cohabitation or marriage. In addition, education distinguishes those in non-\nresidential and co-residential unions: Individuals in LAT unions are likely to have more\nschooling than those who live with their spouse or a cohabiting partner (Castro-Mart\u00edn,\nDom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and Mart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2008 for Spain, Haskey and Lewis 2006 for\nBritain).\nQualitative evidence from Europe is consistent with quantitative findings about life\ncourse variation in the reasons for LAT relationships. Interview data suggest that\nmiddle-aged and elderly people view living apart together as a way to balance aspects\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 181\nof a shared, intimate life with autonomy and independence in taking care of children or\nolder parents (Haskey and Lewis 2006, Levin 2004). In older age, those who form LAT\nunions may do so to remain in a long-held residence or to stay near family and friends\nIn-depth interviews indicate that divorced persons may prefer non-residential\npartnerships because they are reluctant to give up their autonomy and want to avoid\nfalling into habits that they associate with their previous relationship (Haskey and\nand Lewis' (2006) study also explained their decision to live apart from their intimate\npartner as an effort to achieve greater gender equity in the division of household work.\nThe expressed goals of autonomy, personal fulfillment, and a more egalitarian\nrelationship reinforce the claim that LAT unions are part of the Second Demographic\nTransition's normative change in the value and meaning of couple relationships\nIntimate partners also may live apart due to economic constraints rather than\nchoices (Kiernan 2002). In a recent French study almost three fifths of individuals in\nLAT relationships said they were living apart from their partner because of\ncircumstances out of their control, such as financial pressures (Beaujouan, Regnier-\nLoilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Table 8). Economic constraints are likely to differ\nacross the life course; Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp (2008) find\nthat young adults are much more likely than those who are older to say that financial\nconstraints are the reason they are in a LAT relationship. For young people who live\nwith their parents, transitioning from a LAT union to a co-residential union is costly\nbecause it requires sufficient economic resources to relinquish the intergenerational\ntransfers associated with living with parents (Castro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and\nMart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2008). Labor market opportunities, housing costs, and partners'\neconomic circumstances affect young people's ability to move in with a partner. These\neconomic factors are akin to those that affect marriage decisions among cohabiting\ncouples (Smock, Manning, and Porter 2005). In contrast, for older persons who have\nalready established independent households and have greater economic security, the\ntransition from a LAT union to a co-residential union may be guided more by lifestyle\nchoices, such as a desire to preserve autonomy.\n2.3 Non-residential partnerships in the United States\nInformation about non-residential partnerships in the United States is much more\nlimited than in Europe and Canada. In its earliest incarnation, U.S. research on non-\nresidential partnerships focused on married couples who were living apart in\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n182 http://www.demographic-research.org\n\"commuter marriages\" (Gerstel and Gross 1984). Commuter marriages are uncommon;\nonly 3.1% of married persons are \"married, spouse absent\" to use Census Bureau\nparlance (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2006). Rindfuss and Stephen (1990) use data on\nyoung adults to show that marriages are more likely to break up when spouses do not\nlive together. At least for married couples who live apart, the state of being in a non-\nresidential partnership may be short-lived.\nMore recent U.S. efforts to study non-residential partnerships adopt the European\nfocus on non-marital unions, as we do in our study. These studies find that most non-\nmarital LAT relationships are also of short duration. Binstock and Thornton (2003) use\ncohabitation histories for White young adults to examine transitions between living\nwith a partner, periods of separation, and then returns to a shared home. They find\nrelatively high rates of movement between co-residential partnerships and what they\ninfer are non-residential partnerships. Other research investigates non-residential unions\namong parents to assess the stability of children's contact with fathers. Data from the\nFragile Families and Child Wellbeing project, a U.S. birth cohort study of parents and\ntheir young children, show that only 14% of parents in a \"romantically involved but\nliving apart relationship\" were still living apart one year later (Carlson, McLanahan,\nand England 2004: 245). There are no U.S. studies to our knowledge that investigate the\nprevalence or characteristics of non-residential partnerships for a broader age range and\nfor both parents and non-parents.\n2.4 Sexual orientation and LAT relationships\nThere also has been very little research on non-residential partnerships among lesbians\nand gay men in the United States. In fact, demographic research on same-sex couples is\neven more limited by data availability than is research on heterosexual couples (Casper\net al. 2008). However, theory and data exist which provide possible insights about LAT\nrelationships among lesbians and gay men. The same normative changes associated\nwith the Second Demographic Transition contributed to greater approval of\nheterosexual cohabitation and fostered more acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex\ncouple relationships. For example, individuals in cultural settings that emphasize the\nvalue of self-expression are more accepting of homosexuality (Adamczyk and Pitt\n2009). In an environment that encourages autonomy and personal fulfillment, lesbians\nand gay men are likely to form LAT unions for the same reasons that heterosexuals do \u00ad\nto balance desires for intimacy and personal autonomy or because of economic\nconstraints.\nDespite growing acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex unions, there is still\nconsiderable stigma associated with homosexuality and same-sex relationships (Loftus\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 183\n2001, Peplau and Fingerhut 2007). For example, approximately half of American adults\nin 2003 reported a \"mostly unfavorable\" or \"very unfavorable\" opinion of lesbians and\ngay men (Pew Research Center 2003). Policies also limit the opportunities of same-sex\ncouples. For example, same-sex couples cannot marry in most U.S. states and cannot\nadopt or foster children in some states (Gates et al. 2007).\nThis social context is likely to make non-residential partnerships more attractive to\nlesbians and gay men than to heterosexual women and men. Stigma may increase the\ndesirability of forming a LAT relationship because non-residential partnerships keep\nsexuality more private than does moving in together (Peplau and Cochran 1990, Steven\nand Murphy 1998). Two other factors may contribute to a higher prevalence of non-\nresidential unions among lesbians and gay men compared to heterosexuals. First,\nindividuals' expectations that part of being a couple includes sharing a household may\nbe much stronger for heterosexual unions than for same-sex unions. An example of the\nemphasis on co-residence for heterosexual unions includes major theories of family life\nheterosexual couples who live with children. Because lesbians and gay men are less\nlikely than heterosexuals to express interest in having children (Gates et al. 2007), and\nbecause same-sex couples are less likely to have children (Black, Sanders, and Taylor\n2007), sharing a residence may be a less salient feature of same-sex than heterosexual\nunions. Second, if LAT relationships facilitate an egalitarian division of labor (Haskey\nand Lewis 2006), and if gay men and lesbians are more likely than heterosexual women\nand men to seek equality in their intimate relationships (Kurdek, 2005) then LAT\nunions may be more common among gay men and lesbians than among their\nheterosexual counterparts.\nThe recent article by Carpenter and Gates (2008) presents some insights on the\nprevalence and demographic correlates of LAT unions among self-identified lesbians\nand gay men in the United States. Their article focuses on how lesbians and gay men\nwho register as domestic partners differ from people whose partnerships are not\nregistered with the State. Using data from the 2003 California LGBT Tobacco Survey,\nyears old are in non-residential partnerships. These non-residential partnerships are of\nshorter duration than cohabiting unions, especially for lesbians. The Tobacco Survey\nresults also show that lesbians in non-residential unions are younger than are lesbians\nwho are living with their partner and than their single counterparts, but among gay men\nthere is little or no difference in mean age by union status.\nIn addition, Carpenter and Gates (2008) find that lesbians and gay men differ in\nthe association between education and whether or not they live with their partner.\nLesbians in non-residential partnerships are less likely to have completed college than\nare cohabiters, but for gay men college completion and type of partnership appear\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n184 http://www.demographic-research.org\nunrelated. Because the younger adults in the Tobacco Survey sample may still be\nenrolled in school, it is unclear if the gender difference is due to differences in the\ntiming of LAT relationships in lesbians' and gay men's lives, or to differences in how\neducation affects union status. We build on the work of Carpenter and Gates (2008) by\ncomparing lesbians and gay men with heterosexual women and men who are likely to\nhave completed their educations, examining perceived support from LAT partners\ncompared to support from residential partners, and investigating the demographic\ncorrelates of being in a non-residential union within a multivariate context.\n3. The present study\nWe begin by describing how individuals in LAT unions differ demographically from\nmarried, cohabiting, and single people. We examine a variety of demographic\ncharacteristics initially, but later focus on three that are not \u00ad or are unlikely to be \u00ad\ninfluenced by union status: age, education, and race-ethnicity. Next, we shed light on\nwhat heterosexual women and men in LAT unions may be seeking in their relationships\nby examining union status differences in attitudes about work, individualism, and\ngender roles. These attitudes provide suggestive evidence on the extent to which people\nform LAT unions out of a desire to combine individualism with companionship.\nAlthough these attitudes can be both causes and consequences of a person's union\nstatus, studying the attitudinal correlates is a useful way to determine whether those in\nLAT unions are more like cohabiters or single people. We also examine whether\nheterosexuals in cohabiting and LAT unions expect to marry their partner. These\nexpectations provide insight into the extent to which living apart together is a precursor\nto marriage. Finally, we describe the potential benefits of LAT unions for lesbians, gay\nmen and heterosexual women and men by examining how much emotional and\ninstrumental support individuals in marital, cohabiting, and LAT unions perceive from\ntheir partners.\nWe use data from two complementary population-based data sources, one a national\nsample and the other a state sample. The national data source is the U.S. General Social\nSurvey (GSS) from 1996 and 1998. The GSS consists of cross-sectional, multistage\nprobability samples of the non-institutionalized adult population of the United States.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 185\nThe GSS is rare in its inclusion of questions about non-residential partnerships\naddressed to adults in a broad age range.6 GSS interviews were conducted face-to-face\nin English and had response rates of about 76% in both years (National Opinion\nResearch Center 2007, Table A.6). We combine the two years when possible to increase\nthe number of individuals in cohabiting and LAT relationships. We restrict the analysis\nsample to adults age 23-70. The younger age boundary is to reduce the chance that\nrespondents are still in school, and the older age boundary is to match the cut-off for the\nsecond dataset we use (described in the next paragraph). We weight the GSS data to\nadjust for differential selection by household size and for survey non-response, and use\nthe svy procedures in Stata 10 to adjust for the complex sampling design of the GSS.\n1,721 in 1998) who were in the random subsamples of the GSS survey that included the\nquestion about LAT status. This sample excludes 66 cases with missing data on the\nrelationship status or socio-demographic questions. The sample sizes in the second part\nof the analysis, which examines attitudes and values, vary because the GSS asked some\nquestions only of random subsamples.\nWe supplement the GSS data with data from the 2004-05 California Quality of\nLife Survey I (Cal-QOL, Cochran and Mays 2007). The Cal-QOL is a population-based\nsample of lesbians, gay men, and heterosexual women and men in California. It\nincludes a measure identifying those in LAT relationships and assesses respondents'\nperceptions of support from their relationship partner. The Cal-QOL is a follow-back\nsurvey conducted in English and Spanish that interviewed individuals who originally\nparticipated in the 2003 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). The 2003 CHIS is\na computer-assisted telephone survey of a multistage probability sample of the non-\ninstitutionalized California population.7 When weighted, the CHIS data are\nrepresentative of the adult population of California living in households.\nAt the conclusion of the CHIS interview, respondents were asked if they were\ninterested in participating in future surveys. The Cal-QOL attempted to re-interview\nevery CHIS respondent who agreed to participate and indicated a lesbian, gay, or\nbisexual identity, or who reported same-sex sexual activity in the year prior to\ninterview. A random sample of the remaining respondents 18-70 years was also\n6 Some U.S. national studies, such as the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), include questions about dating or \"going steady\"\nrelationships, but these questions identify more casual relationships than the designation LAT implies. The\nNSFG and Add Health also sample a narrower age range than does the GSS.\n7 The overall CHIS response rate was 34%, calculated as the screener completion rate (56%) multiplied by the\ncompletion rate (60%, California Health Interview Survey 2005). This response rate is comparable to the\nCalifornia 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n2005) and only slightly lower than the 44% response rate in California for the National Survey of American\nFamilies, which used monetary incentives (Westat Corporation 2003).\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n186 http://www.demographic-research.org\ninterviewed as a heterosexual comparison group. Fifty-six percent of those selected for\nthe Cal-QOL were successfully re-interviewed 6 to 18 months after they agreed to be\nre-contacted (Cochran and Mays 2007). Individuals who changed telephone numbers,\nincluding those who moved, were not reachable due to the highly restricted identifying\ninformation available on the original CHIS participants. We use weights to adjust for\nhousehold size and survey non-response in all analyses.8\nThe Cal-QOL analysis samples we use in this paper are defined by individuals'\nsample sizes exclude 74 individuals with missing data on socio-demographic variables\nand 106 individuals with inconsistent information about sexual orientation in the CHIS\nand the Cal-QOL surveys.10 In the analysis of perceived support, we exclude another 3\ncases with missing data on the support variables, as well as 32 cases who were\nadministered a shorter instrument that excluded the support questions as part of a\nrefusal conversion experiment included in the Cal-QOL sampling methodology\nThe GSS and Cal-QOL have complementary strengths for studying LAT unions in\nthe United States. The GSS is a national sample and includes questions about\nexpectations of marriage and attitudes toward work, individualism, and gender roles\nthat are components of the shift in value orientation associated with the Second\nDemographic Transition. The Cal-QOL contains relatively large numbers of lesbians\nand gay men and also asks about perceived support from partners to provide insight on\npotential benefits of non-residential partnerships. The two studies identify individuals in\nLAT relationships using a similar approach. They differ, however, in the populations\nfrom which the samples were drawn. The Cal-QOL data are more recent than are the\nin many aspects of the Second Demographic Transition than other U.S. states\n(Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006). We consider these differences in interpreting our\n8 The Cal-QOL weights are constructed using the following characteristics: age, sex, race-ethnicity,\ngeographic variables, presence of people under age 18 in the household, home ownership, and education. We\ndo not use the svy procedure in Stata with the Cal-QOL data because of the small samples of lesbians and gay\nmen.\n9 We exclude bisexual women and men because of small sample sizes and because bisexuals may be\npartnered with someone of the same or opposite sex.\n10 A person's sexual orientation might be classified inconsistently in the CHIS and Cal-QOL for two\nindistinguishable reasons: measurement errors in questions about sexual behavior and identity and true\nchanges in sexual orientation. Among the 106 individuals with inconsistent information on sexual orientation\nacross the two surveys, 102 were classified as having a minority sexual orientation in the CHIS but identified\nthemselves as heterosexual in the Cal-QOL. The remaining 4 cases were classified as heterosexual in the\nCHIS but identified as gay or lesbian in the Cal-QOL. Measurement of sexual orientation and its stability is\nan important topic, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 187\nfindings. Together the datasets provide a more complete picture of LAT relationships\nthan either dataset provides separately.\nUnion status. The GSS used a standard question on current marital status. Those not\ncurrently married were asked about heterosexual non-marital unions: \"Do you have a\nmain romantic involvement \u00ad a (man/woman) you think of as a steady, a lover, a\npartner, or whatever?\" Respondents who answered affirmatively were then asked if they\nlived with their partner. Using this information, we created five mutually exclusive\ncategories: married, cohabiting, LAT, previously-married single, never-married single.\nThe GSS did not ask about sexual orientation in these survey years so we restrict the\nGSS analysis to heterosexual unions. We refer to women and men in the GSS as\n\"putatively heterosexual\" to indicate our assumption about sexual orientation. This\nassumption is reasonable given estimates that less than 3% of adults self-identify as\nlesbian, gay, or bisexual (Black et al. 2000).\nIn the Cal-QOL, respondents were first asked, \"Are you now married, living with a\npartner in a marriage-like relationship, widowed, divorced, separated, or never\nmarried?\" Those neither married nor cohabiting were later asked, \"When we began the\ninterview, you indicated that you were not married or currently living with a partner. Do\nyou have a relationship partner but maybe the two of you don't live together?\" We\nidentify three relationship statuses in our analysis of lesbians and gay men: cohabiting,\nLAT, and single. We limit the analysis to these statuses because same-sex marriage was\nnot legally recognized in California at the time of the survey, and because the small\nsample sizes prevent us from distinguishing between single people who have never\nbeen married and those who were previously married.11\nCovariates. We consider several demographic characteristics of respondents in the\nGSS and Cal-QOL. Age is measured in years. In the GSS, we distinguish three race-\nethnic groups: Whites, Blacks, and other races. A more fine-grained division of race-\nethnic groups is not possible because the GSS did not have a separate question to\nidentify Hispanic respondents in 1996 and 1998. In the Cal-QOL analyses, we treat\nrace-ethnicity as a dichotomy distinguishing non-Hispanic Whites from all others\n(\"non-Whites\") because of the small sample sizes of lesbians and gay men. Close to\ntwo thirds of the non-Whites in the Cal-QOL samples we use identified themselves as\n11 The larger CHIS sample from which the Cal-QOL sample was drawn did not obtain information about non-\nresidential unions. Neither the CHIS nor the Cal-QOL asked about official domestic partnership status.\nCalifornia requires a shared residence as a criterion for domestic partner registration.\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n188 http://www.demographic-research.org\nHispanic. In the GSS and the Cal-QOL analyses, education is coded as a dichotomy\ncomparing individuals with a college degree to those who acquired less schooling. We\nalso distinguish individuals who report any children under 18 living in the household\nfrom those without children in the household. Individuals who report working for pay\nfull-time or part-time are compared to those who are not working. We define GSS\nrespondents who live in areas with a population of 100,000 or more as living in an\nurban area. Finally, the GSS asked respondents if they lived with both of their \"own\"\nparents at age 16. We distinguish individuals who lived with their own mother and\nfather from those who had a different family structure (e.g., single parent, parent and\nstepparent).\nindividualism, and gender roles. We examine union status differences in agreeing or\nstrongly agreeing with the statements: \"Work is a person's most important activity\"\n(1998), and \"Personal freedom is more important than the companionship of marriage\"\nemotional dependence in couple relationships, regardless of respondents' current\nrelationship status. We examine union status differences in whether individuals prefer a\ngender-specialized division of labor or an arrangement in which men and women share\nmarket and non-market work. We also examine the association between union status\nand whether individuals prefer that members of a couple be emotionally independent or\ndependent.12 Finally, using GSS data from both years, we examine whether respondents\nthink it is \"very\" or \"somewhat\" likely that they will marry their cohabiting or LAT\npartner.\nPerceived support from partner. The Cal-QOL assessed emotional and\ninstrumental support from romantic partners using three questions (Brim et al. 1995-\nspouse (partner) understand the way you feel about things?\"; \"How much can you rely\non your spouse (partner) for help if you have a serious problem?\"; and \"How much can\nyou open up to your spouse (partner) if you need to talk about your worries?\" Response\noptions were: \"Not at all,\" \"A little,\" \"Some,\" and \"A lot.\" We examine respondents'\nreports of \"a lot\" of support vs. less support by union status.\n12 Question wording was: \"Next, we have some questions about the kind of relationship you would like with a\nspouse or partner. It doesn't matter whether you are now married or living with someone. For each pair of\nitems on the card, which type of relationship would you prefer?\" The interviewer then handed the respondent\na card with paired options. The first pair we use is: \"1. A relationship where the man has the main\nresponsibility for providing the household income and the woman has the main responsibility for taking care\nof the home and family. 2. A relationship where the man and woman equally share responsibility for\nproviding the household income and taking care of the home and family?\" The second pair we use is: \"1. A\nrelationship where the man and woman are emotionally dependent on each other. 2. A relationship where the\nman and woman are both emotionally independent?\"\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 189\nThe analysis has three parts. In the first, we describe the prevalence and demographic\ncorrelates of different union statuses for putative heterosexuals using the pooled 1996\nand 1998 GSS data, and for gay men, lesbians, and heterosexual men and women using\nthe Cal-QOL data. We begin with cross-tabulations for the men and women in the GSS\nand for the four gender-sexual orientation groups in the Cal-QOL. We then estimate\nfour multinomial logistic regressions of union status on age, race-ethnicity, and\neducation, separately for putative heterosexual women and men in the GSS and for\nlesbians and gay men in the Cal-QOL. For parsimony, we do not present the\nmultivariate results for the Cal-QOL heterosexual sample. Instead we comment briefly\non similarities and differences between the results for the GSS and Cal-QOL\nheterosexual samples. Although the initial cross-tabulations include a wide range of\ncharacteristics to provide a more complete description of individuals in LAT\nrelationships, we restrict the multivariate analysis to a limited number of characteristics\nthat are not, or are unlikely to be, influenced by union status. In both the GSS and Cal-\nQOL models, we conduct tests for the joint significance of the covariates, where the\nnull hypothesis is that all the coefficients equal zero for the particular outcome\ncomparison (e.g., LAT vs. married).\nIn the second part of the analysis, we use information available in the GSS to\ninvestigate differences by union status in individualistic attitudes, family ideals, and,\namong heterosexuals in cohabiting and LAT unions, expectations of marriage, adjusting\nfor potentially confounding factors. We summarize these analyses by reporting\npredicted probabilities from logistic regressions in which each attitude item is a\nfunction of union status, gender, age, education, and race-ethnicity. We also explored\ninteractions between union status and gender. With one exception, the interactions were\nnot statistically significant. We describe the exception in the text.\nIn the third part, we use information from the Cal-QOL to describe variation in\nindividuals' perceptions of support from their partners among those in marital,\ncohabiting, and LAT unions. We conduct the analyses separately by sexual orientation\nand, as in the GSS analysis, we report predicted probabilities from logistic regressions\nof each support item on union status, gender, age, race-ethnicity, and education.\n4. Results\n4.1 Differences in demographic characteristics by union status\nIn Table 1, we present the distribution of union status and the characteristics of\nindividuals in different types of unions for putatively heterosexual women and men\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n190 http://www.demographic-research.org\nusing weighted GSS data. Seven percent of U.S. women and 6% of U.S. men report that\nthey are in a LAT relationship, representing 35% of all individuals who are not married\nor cohabiting. These individuals would be classified as \"single\" in conventional studies\nthat focus exclusively on co-residential unions.\nTable 1: Socio-demographic characteristics by gender and union status,\nWOMEN\nTotal Married Cohab.

For both women and men, individuals in LAT unions are\nyounger than those who are married. Those in LAT unions are almost twice as likely to\nhave a college degree as those in cohabiting unions (33% vs. 18% for women; 29% vs.\n16% for men). As a group, women in LAT relationships are more ethnically diverse\nthan those who are married or cohabiting. For example, 58% of women in LAT unions\ndescribe themselves as White compared to 85% of those who are married, and 80% of\nthose who are cohabiting. Among men, 75% of those in LAT unions identify\nthemselves as White, higher than the 58% of women in LAT unions. But without\ninformation about partners' characteristics, we cannot determine whether LAT\nrelationships, like cohabiting unions, are more heterogamous on race-ethnicity than are\nAmong women, there is little difference by union status in the percentage living\nwith children: 45% of those in LAT unions live with children, compared to 50% of\nmarried women and 52% of cohabiting women. Among men, however, only 9% of\nthose in LAT unions live with children, compared to 49% of married men and 39% of\nmale cohabiters. There are few differences by union status in whether individuals are\nemployed, although married and previously married women are slightly less likely to be\nemployed than are other women and all men. Women and men in LAT unions are more\nlikely than are married people to live in an urban area. Like cohabiters, those in LAT\nrelationships are also less likely to have grown up living with both of their parents than\nare their married counterparts. Those in LAT unions closely resemble single people\nwho have never been married: the two groups have similar mean ages, amounts of\nschooling, and racial composition.\nIn the next table we present results for similar analyses of self-identified lesbians,\ngay men, and heterosexual women and men using the weighted Cal-QOL data. Table 2\nshows that 15% of lesbians and 17% of gay men are in LAT relationships.13 As is true\nfor putative heterosexuals in the GSS, lesbians and gay men who are in non-residential\npartnerships are a substantial minority of lesbians and gay men who would be classified\nas single by conventional indicators of relationship status, 37% and 27%, respectively.\nCompared to lesbians and gay men, slightly lower percentages of heterosexual women\nand men in the Cal-QOL sample report that they are in a LAT relationship, 12% of\n13 The prevalence of LAT unions among lesbians and gay men in the Cal-QOL is slightly higher than reported\nby Carpenter and Gates using data from the 2003 California LGBT Tobacco Survey (2008, Table 3). Our\nstudies differ in the age ranges in the analyses and the questions used to identify non-residential partnerships.\nThe Tobacco Survey asked a more restrictive question, and this might contribute to the slightly lower\npercentages in non-residential unions reported by Carpenter and Gates. This survey asked respondents about a\nprimary partner, someone described as the person \"you love more than anyone else and feel a unique\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n192 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwomen and 13% of men. The sexual orientation difference was marginally statistically\nsignificant among men (t = 1.68; p = .09) but not statistically significant among women\nTable 2: Socio-demographic characteristics by sexual orientation,\ngender and union status, 2004-05 California Quality of Life Survey\n(percentages unless noted)\nLESBIANS\nTotal Cohab.

The percentages of heterosexual\nwomen and men in non-residential unions in California are higher than in the United\nStates as a whole and the differences are statistically significant (12% vs. 7% for\nreflect both period increases in LAT relationships and California's more liberal\nenvironment, as indicated by the state's greater prevalence of other non-traditional\nfamily forms (Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006).\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n194 http://www.demographic-research.org\nLesbians in LAT unions are younger than those who are single, a finding\nconsistent with Carpenter and Gates (2008). This is in seeming contrast to the pattern\nfor heterosexual women for whom the ages of those in LAT relationships and the never\nmarried single women are similar. Because of small sample sizes, however, the single\ncategory in Table 2 combines never married and previously married women, who are\ntypically older.14 There is no statistically significant age difference between lesbians in\ncohabiting and LAT relationships, although lesbians in cohabiting relationships are five\nyears older on average than lesbians in LAT relationships. Notably, there are no age\ngradients by union status among gay men, also consistent with Carpenter and Gates\n(2008). In contrast to the patterns for heterosexual women and men in the GSS, for\nlesbians and gay men there are no statistically significant education or race-ethnic\ndifferences between those in LAT unions and those in cohabiting unions. The data\nsuggest, however, that gay men in LAT relationships are somewhat more ethnically\ndiverse than are cohabiting gay men: 36% of gay men in LAT relationships are non-\nWhite compared to 21% of cohabiting gay men.\nThe bottom two panels of Table 2 show the demographic characteristics of\nheterosexuals in the Cal-QOL by union status. These results are generally consistent\nwith those in Table 1. For example, women and men in cohabiting and LAT\nrelationships are younger than those who are married. There are, however, two\nexceptions to this similarity. In the Cal-QOL sample, heterosexual women in LAT\nrelationships are much less likely to live with a minor child compared to married or\ncohabiting women, but in the GSS sample there are no differences among women in the\npresence of children by union status. In addition, although the GSS data suggest an\nassociation between education and union status, there are no significant education by\nunion status differences in the Cal-QOL samples of heterosexual women and men.\n4.2 Multivariate analysis of demographic correlates\nIn Table 3 we present results of multinomial logistic regressions of union status on age,\neducation, and race-ethnicity, stratified by gender and sexual orientation. The results in\nthe two top panels of Table 3 are based on GSS data from putative heterosexuals. The\nnet associations are largely consistent with the gross associations in Table 1. Age\nincreases the log odds that a person will be married instead of in a LAT union. For\nwomen, having a college education reduces the log odds of being married rather than\nbeing in a LAT union. There is no statistically significant association between\neducation and being married vs. in a LAT relationship for men. Other associations are\n14 Thirty-seven percent of single lesbians report being previously married.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 195\nsimilar for women and men. Blacks are less likely than Whites to be married than in a\nLAT relationship. Age is not associated with being in a cohabiting vs. a LAT union.\nHaving at least a college degree decreases the log odds of cohabiting vs. being in a LAT\nunion.\nTable 3: Parameters from multinomial logistic regressions predicting union\nstatus by gender and sexual orientation\nMarried vs. LAT Cohabiting vs. LAT\nSingle (previously married)\nvs. LAT\nSingle (never married)\nvs. LAT\nWomen   / s.e.   / s.e.\nMen\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n196 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: (Continued)\nCohabiting vs. LAT Single vs. LAT\n  / s.e.   / s.e.\nJoint significance of covariates 2 (3) = 3.3\nSources: Weighted data from the 1996 and 1998 General Social Surveys, adults 23-70 years old. Weighted data from the California\nResults are from four multinomial logistic regressions, one for each gender and sexual orientation. Reference group for each\ncovariate is in parentheses.\nTests of the joint significance of covariates suggest that women and men in LAT\nunions do differ demographically from those in marital or cohabiting unions. But the\ntests for the joint significance of covariates for the contrast between being single never-\nmarried and being in a LAT relationship are not statistically significant. This is\nconsistent with the gross associations in Table 1 suggesting that those in LAT unions\nand single never-married people are demographically similar.\nWe compared these results to results from the same model estimated for\nheterosexual women and men in the Cal-QOL (not shown). In these models, we\ncombined previously married and never married single people. The associations\nbetween age and union status were similar for the two samples. However, the Cal-QOL\nand GSS results differ in the education-union status association. The GSS findings, as\nshown in the top two panels of Table 3, indicate that having a college education reduces\nthe log odds of being in a cohabiting vs. LAT relationship for both women and men.\nBeing college educated also reduces women's log odds of being married vs. in a LAT\nunion. But in the Cal-QOL sample of heterosexuals, there is no statistically significant\nassociation between education and union status. This is consistent with the absence of a\nzero-order association in Table 2. We speculate about the difference between the GSS\nand Cal-QOL results in the discussion section.\nThe last panel of Table 3 includes the results for lesbians and gay men from the\nCal-QOL survey. Among lesbians, age increases the log odds of being single vs. being\nin a LAT union (p < .01) and also may increase the log odds of being in a cohabiting vs.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 197\nLAT union (p = .11). There are no statistically significant associations between age and\nunion status among gay men, a pattern consistent with the results in Table 2 and with\nthose reported by Carpenter and Gates (2008). Among lesbians, the test of joint\nsignificance of covariates is statistically significant for the single vs. LAT union\ncomparison, but not for the cohabiting vs. LAT union comparison. For gay men, neither\nof the tests of joint significance is statistically significant.\n4.3 Union status differences in attitudes and expectations about marriage among\nheterosexuals\nUsing GSS data, we show in Table 4 the predicted probabilities of agreeing with four\nattitudes about work, individualism, and gender roles by union status. For individuals in\nLAT or cohabiting unions, we also show the predicted probability that individuals\nexpect to marry their current partner. Probabilities are arbitrarily evaluated for a 35\nyear-old White woman who did not complete college. The parameters from the models\ngenerating these predicted probabilities are in Appendix Table A-1. As a group,\nheterosexuals in LAT unions have more individualistic attitudes, are more work-\noriented, and are more likely to prefer that women and men share market and non-\nmarket work than their married counterparts. The predicted probability of preferring\nthat men and women share responsibility for paid work and family care giving, for\nexample, is .78 for those in LAT unions but .67 for married people.\nHeterosexual cohabiters and those in heterosexual LAT unions also hold different\nattitudes about the division of family labor and emotional dependence between men and\nwomen. Individuals in LAT unions are less likely than are cohabiters to prefer that men\nand women share responsibility for paid work and family care giving. Those in LAT\nrelationships are more likely than are cohabiters, however, to prefer that men and\nwomen be emotionally dependent. We anticipated that people in LAT unions would\nhold more individualistic values than cohabiters. Although the predicted probability of\nagreeing or strongly agreeing that \"Personal freedom is more important than the\ncompanionship of marriage\" was higher for cohabiters than for those in LAT unions,\nthe difference is not statistically significant (p = .14).\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n198 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: Predicted probabilities of agreeing with statements about\nindividualism, family ideals, and expectations about marriage\nby union status\nN Married Cohabit.

See Appendix Table A-1 for model parameters.\nThese union status differences in attitudes are similar for women and men, with\none exception: Women in LAT unions are more likely than are their married\ncounterparts to agree that \"Work is a person's most important activity.\" In contrast,\nmen in LAT unions and married men hold similar attitudes about the importance of\nwork (results not shown).\nIndividuals in LAT relationships are less likely than cohabiters to expect to marry\ntheir current partner. The predicted probability of expecting marriage is .61 for those in\nLAT relationships, compared to .76 for cohabiters. These predicted probabilities are\nvery close to the unadjusted weighted percentages, 60% vs. 75%, respectively.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\n4.4 Union type differences in perceptions of support from partners for\nheterosexuals, gay men and lesbians\nWe used the Cal-QOL data to investigate how much support individuals in different\ntypes of unions perceive from their partners. We conducted two separate analyses, one\nfor heterosexual women and men and one for lesbians and gay men. Table 5 includes\nthe predicted probabilities by union type that individuals report \"a lot\" of support from\ntheir partner, adjusting for gender, age, education, and race-ethnicity. As in Table 4, we\nreport the predicted probabilities of each type of support for a 35 year-old White\nwoman who did not complete college. The full models are reported in Appendix Table\nTable 5: Predicted probabilities of reporting \"a lot\" of support from partner,\nby union status and sexual orientation\nPartner understands\nfeelings\nCan rely on partner for help\nwith serious problems\nCan open up to partner\nHeterosexual women and men\nLesbians and gay men\n* Test of difference from LAT statistically significant at p  .05\nPredicted probabilities are from logistic regressions of reporting \"a lot\" of support on union status, gender, age, education, and race-\nethnicity and evaluated for a 35 year-old White woman who did not complete college. See Appendix Table A-2 for model\nparameters.\nIndividuals in LAT unions perceive moderate to high levels of support from their\npartners, but they report less instrumental support than do those who are married or\ncohabiting. Among heterosexuals, for example, the predicted probability of being able\nto rely on a partner \"a lot\" for help with a serious problem is .87 for a married person,\n.82 for a cohabiter, and .59 for someone in a LAT union. The differences between\nindividuals in marital and LAT unions and between those in cohabiting and LAT unions\nare statistically significant at p  .05.\nLike heterosexuals in LAT unions, lesbians and gay men in LAT unions are less\nlikely than are cohabiters to say that they can rely on their partners \"a lot\" for help with\na serious problem. Notably, for heterosexuals and for lesbians and gay men, there is no\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 199\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n200 http://www.demographic-research.org\nstatistically significant difference between those in LAT relationships and cohabiters in\nhow much individuals say their partners understand their feelings or that they can open\nup to their partners.\nIn a separate analysis (not shown), we investigated interactions between gender\nand union status. Although heterosexual men reported higher levels of support from\ntheir partners than did heterosexual women, we found no evidence that the association\nbetween union status and perceived support is different for women and men within each\nsexual orientation group.\n5. Discussion\nDemographic data that focus only on household-based relationships ignore the fact that\nsome couples live apart but maintain significant ties to each other. By expanding\nconventional union categories to include \"Living Apart Together\" (LAT) unions for\nboth heterosexual and same-sex couples, our study illustrates the diversity of couple\nrelationships in the United States. These non-residential unions are part of a broad shift\nin how individuals organize their family relationships. By ignoring non-residential\npartnerships, researchers miss sources of support that may enhance individuals' well-\nbeing. How serious an omission this is depends on how common LAT relationships are:\nOur finding that one third of individuals who would be classified as \"single\" by\nconventional measures of union status are actually in LAT relationships suggests that\nignoring these relationships is a serious problem.\nEstimates of the prevalence of LAT relationships in the heterosexual population\nvary for the two data sources we use. With national data from the late 1990s, we\nestimate that 6% of men and 7% of women were in non-residential relationships\ncompared to 13% and 12% of heterosexual men and women, respectively, for\nCalifornia in the mid 2000s. The higher prevalence estimates for the more recent data\nfrom California can be interpreted as either an increase in non-residential unions over\ntime or as attributable to California's more advanced stage in the Second Demographic\nTransition (Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006). Without more recent national data on LAT\nunions, we cannot distinguish between these two interpretations.\nOur data from California provide mixed support for our speculation that LAT\nrelationships are more common among gay men and lesbians than among heterosexual\nmen and women. We find that LAT relationships are somewhat more common among\ngay men than among heterosexual men. Lesbians and heterosexual women do not differ\nsignificantly in the prevalence of LAT relationships, although the marginally higher\npercentage of lesbians in LAT relationships is consistent with our suggestion that LAT\nrelationships are a way for lesbians and gay men to keep their sexual identities private.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 201\nPrevalence estimates from both of our cross-sectional data sources may understate\nthe importance of LAT relationships in individuals' lives if there are high rates of\ntransition between LAT and other union statuses (Binstock and Thornton 2003).\nLongitudinal data are needed to estimate the incidence of LAT unions and to determine\nfor whom LAT is a transitional arrangement and for whom it is a long-term way of life.\nTaking account of movements in and out of relationships might be especially important\nfor comparisons among lesbians, gay men, and heterosexuals in light of the higher rates\nof disruption that characterize same-sex co-residential unions (Andersson et al. 2006,\nKalmijn, Loeve, and Manting 2007). If lesbians and gay men experience more rapid\ntransitions out of co-residential unions, they are likely to spend relatively more time\nsingle or in relationships that are sometimes, but not always, less committed, such as\nLAT unions. This may account for our finding that LAT relationships are more\ncommon among gay men than among heterosexual men in cross-sectional data.\nOur findings also shed light on the significance of LAT relationships throughout\nthe life course. Among heterosexual women and men and among lesbians, age\ndecreases the chance of being in a LAT union compared to a co-residential union\n(marriage for heterosexual women and men, cohabitation for lesbians). This pattern in\nboth the national and California samples is consistent with qualitative evidence that\nLAT relationships are a way for young people to balance a desire for intimacy with the\npursuit of education, work, or financial goals (Levin 2004).\nThe absence of association between age and LAT union status for gay men is\nconsistent with Carpenter and Gates' (2008) finding using another sample from\nCalifornia. Our combined findings suggest that non-residential partnerships are a\nsignificant union type throughout the lives of gay men. Gay men may be better able\nthan lesbians or heterosexual women and men to afford the financial costs of\nmaintaining two separate households. Determining why LAT relationships do not\nappear to be a life course phenomenon for gay men is an important question for future\nresearch.\nResearch on life course variation in LAT unions also could fruitfully examine the\nrole of economic constraints at different life stages. That young people are more likely\nthan older people to say they live apart due to economic constraints (Beaujouan,\nRegnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008) probably reflects the lower incomes of\nyoung adults. In addition, economic constraints may have different effects on whether a\nperson is in a LAT union at different ages. When housing costs are high, for example,\nyounger persons still living with their parents may delay moving in with their LAT\npartner. For older persons already living on their own, high housing costs may have the\nopposite effect, all else being equal, motivating persons in LAT relationships to live\ntogether to save money. Future studies on non-residential unions should take account of\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n202 http://www.demographic-research.org\nindividuals' economic resources throughout life as well as contextual factors such as\nemployment opportunities and housing markets.\nWe find that for the United States as a whole, as in Europe, education is positively\nassociated with being in a non-residential partnership compared to cohabitation (for\nwomen and men) and compared to marriage (for women) (Haskey and Lewis 2006,\nCastro-Mart\u00edn, Dom\u00ednquez-Folgueras, and Mart\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2008). For California,\nhowever, there is no statistically significant association between education and LAT\nunion status once age and race-ethnicity are taken into account. The absence of an\neducation-union status association holds for heterosexual men and women as well as for\ngay men and lesbians in California. The different results for the United States as a\nwhole and California suggest the intriguing possibility that educational gradients in the\nprevalence of non-residential relationships erode with more widespread acceptance of\nthe diverse ways that members of couples can share their lives beyond the context of\ntraditional marriage.\nConsistent with findings from in-depth interview studies in other countries\n(Haskey and Lewis 2006, Levin 2004), we found that in the United States heterosexuals\nin LAT unions place a higher value on independence and are more likely to expect both\npartners to contribute to paid work and family care giving, compared to married people.\nThis finding is compatible with the portrait of LAT heterosexual couples as being more\nwork-oriented, individualistic, and egalitarian than married people. The lack of parallel\ndata for lesbians and gay men on attitudes toward work, individualism, and gender roles\nposes a problem for research on same-sex relationships. A question about sexual\norientation on future versions of the General Social Survey core questionnaire will\nprovide much needed information about the attitudes of lesbians and gay men.\nRegardless of union type or sexual orientation, high percentages of individuals in a\nrelationship said that they can count on their partners for support. Nevertheless, married\npersons reported more support than did those in LAT unions. There was little difference\nbetween individuals in LAT and cohabiting relationships in perceptions of emotional\nsupport from partners, but individuals in LAT unions perceived less instrumental\nsupport from their partners than did cohabiters. We observed this pattern for\nheterosexuals, lesbians, and gay men. This finding might reflect the relative ease of\nfostering emotional bonds without living together, compared to the difficulty of\nobtaining instrumental support from a partner who lives in a different household. If\nLAT relationships are more transitory than cohabiting relationships, the short-term\nnature of the union also might contribute to the lower levels of expected help with\nserious problems reported by those in LAT unions. Longitudinal data are necessary to\ndetermine whether living together has a causal effect on perceptions of support, or\nwhether a couple chooses to live together because the partners want to provide more\nsupport and think they can count on each other for support.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 203\nOverall, our findings reinforce the view of LAT relationships as heterogeneous.\nThat less than two thirds of heterosexuals in LAT unions expect to marry their current\npartner is only one illustration that LAT relationships, like cohabitating unions, are not\nalways a stepping stone to marriage. The diversity of couple types is part of the long-\nterm movement away from lifelong marriage and the growing number of choices\nindividuals are able to make about their personal lives (Bumpass 1990, Surkyn and\nLesthaeghe 2002). It is tempting to treat these emerging couple types, such as LAT\nunions, as less consequential than more established union types such as marriage or\ncohabitation. To be sure, living together almost always entails some degree of economic\nand social interdependence. But couples may maintain significant ties even if they do\nnot live together (Haskey and Lewis 2006); in our study, for example, individuals in\nLAT and cohabiting unions reported similar levels of emotional support. And even\nwhen a couple lives in the same household, the individuals may have only marginal\nconnections to each other's lives (Cross-Barnet, Cherlin, and Burton 2008).\nAppreciating the role of LAT relationships throughout the life course \u00ad particularly\nas an arrangement that enables individuals to balance autonomy with the obligations of\nintimate relationships \u00ad is critical for understanding family ties in the 21st century.\nIntegration of LAT relationships into theories of family change, however, is hampered\nby the lack of data on non-residential unions. One reason for the lack of data is the\ninherent ambiguity about whether a couple is \"Living Apart Together\" or in a less\ncommitted dating relationship (Levin and Trost 1999, Sobotka and Toulemon 2008). To\naddress this problem, the wording of questions about relationship status should\ndistinguish LAT unions from less committed relationships in a way that is meaningful\nto respondents (Kiernan 2002). Survey questions about LAT status use the following\nterms: \"main romantic involvement\" (GSS), a \"relationship partner\" (Cal-QOL), an\n\"intimate relationship\" (the 2001 Canadian Social Survey), or a \"regular partner\" (the\nOmnibus Survey in Great Britain). It is unknown, however, whether individuals in LAT\nunions would describe their unions using these terms and whether these terms elicit\nresponses that distinguish serious unions from more casual dating unions. The difficulty\nof determining the most appropriate phrase is similar to the problem of describing\ncohabiting \"partners\" (Manning and Smock 2005).\nThere also may be differences in the interpretation of these terms by sexual\norientation, gender, and age. Questions that ask about LAT or cohabiting relationships\nas \"marriage-like\" may misclassify important subgroups, for example, members of\nsame-sex couples who might not view their relationship as similar to marriage (Stiers\n1999). Men and women may differ in how they distinguish casual from serious\nrelationships. Further, the term \"intimate relationship\" suggests a sexual relationship,\nwhich older individuals may not be as comfortable addressing in a survey. In-depth\nStrohm et al.: \"Living Apart Together\" relationships in the United States\n204 http://www.demographic-research.org\ninterviewing and cognitive interviewing should inform new data collection on LAT\nrelationships.\nA second reason for the lack of data on LAT relationships is the household-based\norientation of most demographic surveys that neglect couple relationships when both\npartners are not in the sampled household. Identifying LAT unions in survey data\nrequires information about union status that is not conditional on whether an individual\nSurveys is a good example of how to do this. In these years, the survey asked unmarried\nrespondents if they have a \"main romantic involvement;\" if the respondent answered\naffirmatively, the survey then asked if the respondent was living with the partner. This\nquestion ordering means that all individuals who are part of a couple are identified in\nthe same way. Questions about a couple's relationship, such as the amount of shared\nleisure time or frequency of disagreements, should be asked in the same way regardless\nof whether the partners live together. Adopting this strategy is more difficult for some\naspects of the relationship than for others, as is evident in studies of parent-adult child\nResearchers should also develop better ways to identify who lives together. Most\nresearch treats co-residence as a dichotomy: people either live with their partner or they\ndo not. For a significant minority of the population, however, residence is not a\ndichotomy and may be better conceptualized as a continuum (Martin 2007).\nDetermining where and with whom a person lives is especially challenging for\nresearchers studying both LAT and cohabiting unions because these unions are often\nFamily demographers have long recognized that parents and children do not\nalways live in the same household, and that people who are not kin may live together\n(Seltzer et al. 2005). Extending this observation to recognize that couples do not always\nlive together will enhance understanding of families in the 21st century.\nDemographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 205\n6.
