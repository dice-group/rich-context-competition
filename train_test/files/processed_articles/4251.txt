A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate\nthe association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity susceptibility.\nMethod: All eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases\nthrough April 2013 according to a predefined criteria.\nResults: Fourteen case-control studies including 3371 cases and 4490 controls were recruited for the analysis of the\nassociation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity susceptibility. A significant association was\nobserved between DD genotype and overweight/obesity risk in overall populations and Africans (p=0.014 and 0.010,\nrespectively). D allele was associated with the risk of overweight/ obesity in Africans (p=0.026). However, II genotype\nmight not be a protective factor against overweight/obesity risk in overall populations, Africans, Caucasians and Asians.\nConclusions: DD genotype is a risk factor for the overweight/obesity susceptibility in overall populations, particularly\nin Africans. D allele is a risk factor for the overweight/obesity susceptibility in Africans. Further larger studies are needed\nto confirm our findings.\n",

In addition, an association of body mass\nindex (BMI) with ACE I/D gene polymorphism was\nobtained in a Tunisian population.10 In this sense, it is rea-\nsonable to postulate that ACE I/D gene polymorphism may\nA meta-analysis of the association\nbetween angiotensin-converting\nenzyme insertion/ deletion gene\npolymorphism and the risk of\noverweight/obesity\nSong Mao and Songming Huang\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, overweight/obesity, gene polymorphism, meta-analysis\nDepartment of Nephrology, Nanjing Children's Hospital,Affiliated to\nNanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China\nCorresponding author:\nSongming Huang, Department of Nephrology, Nanjing Children's\nHospital, Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, 72 Guangzhou road,\nOriginal Article\n688 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nbe associated with susceptibility to overweight/obesity.\nHowever, a number of investigations regarding the associa-\ntion between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/\nobesity risk have generated mixed results in human stud-\nto the onset of overweight/\nobesity is still unclear. Meta-\nanalysis of the association betweenACE I/D gene polymor-\nphism and overweight/obesity risk is rare. Thus, we\nperformed this meta-analysis to investigate the association\nbetween ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight /\nobesity susceptibility with the aim of providing a much\nmore reliable finding on the significance of this issue.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy\nWe searched the published literature through April 2013 for\nrelated studies that investigated the association between\nACE I/D gene polymorphism and the risk of overweight/\nobesity using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases.\nThe search in PubMed or Embase was limited to English\nlanguage. The followings were search terms: (1) over-\nweight, obesity, and central obesity; and (2) angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme, insertion/deletion, ACE I/D, and gene\npolymorphism. We also reviewed the reference lists of\nretrieved articles and reviews. If multiple publications of\nthe same subjects occurred, we recruited the study with the\nmost complete analysis.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria: (1) case-control study; (2) the outcome\nof interest was overweight/obesity; (3) at least two com-\nparison groups (overweight/obesity group vs. control\ngroup). Exclusion criteria: (1) case reports, editorials and\nreviews; (2) relationship between other genes and over-\nweight/obesity risk; (3) multiple publications of the same\ndata; and (4) study of the role of ACE I/D in diseases.\nData extraction and synthesis\nCharacteristics for each study were extracted and data were\nrecorded as follows: first author's surname, year of publica-\ntion, ethnicity of study population, number of cases and\ncontrols for ACE I/D genotype. Frequencies of D allele\nwere computed for case and control groups from the cor-\nresponding genotype distribution. Two authors indepen-\ndently conducted the data extraction and synthesis, with\nany disagreements resolved by discussion.\nStatistical analysis\nOdds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of the association\nbetween ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obe-\nsity risk across studies. Heterogeneity of ORs among stud-\nies was tested by using the Q statistic (significance level at\np<0.05). The I2 statistic, a quantitative measure of incon-\nsistency across studies, was also calculated. The pooled\nORs were computed using either fixed-effects model or, in\nthe presence of heterogeneity, random-effects model.\nMoreover, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also com-\nputed. In order to avoid excessive comparisons, the OR was\ncalculated using three methods: method 1, allele compari-\nson (D allele vs. I allele); method 2, comparing DD\nhomozygous with the other two combinations (DD vs.\nDI+II); and method 3, comparing II genotype with the other\ntwo combinations (II vs. DI+DD). A chi-square test using a\nweb-based program was used to determine whether geno-\ntype distribution of the control population reported con-\nformed to Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) (HWE\nsignificance level at p<0.05). A sensitivity analysis was\nconducted when studies with controls did not conform to\nHWE, or HWE was not available due to the lack of data.\nPotential publication bias was assessed by Begg's test and\nEgger's test (p<0.05 was considered significant) when the\nnumber of the studies included was more than 10. All anal-\nyses were conducted using STATA version 12.0 (Stata\nCorp, College Station, TX); p<0.05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant, except where otherwise specified.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nWe initially extracted 526 unique references from the\nOf these, 512 publications were excluded according to the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria.

For Asians, the\naverage frequency of the D allele was 58.99% in the case\ngroup and 46.82% for controls. For Africans, the average\nfrequency of the D allele was 64.84% in the case group and\n57.68% for controls.

However, there\nwere only two studies included for the meta-analysis in\nAfricans, which made it difficult to draw a robust conclu-\nsion for Africans. More studies in Africans are needed for a\nrobust result. We also found that II genotype seemed not to\nplay a protective role against the risk of overweight/ obe-\nsity in overall populations, Africans, Caucasians and\nAsians.\nSeveral factors may account for our findings regarding\nthe association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and\noverweight/obesity risk. First, the renin\u00adangiotensin sys-\ntem (RAS) has been hypothesized to inhibit adipogenesis,22\nwhich limits the storage capacity of adipose tissues and\nallows ectopic lipid storage that results in lipotoxicity. ACE\nis expressed in adipose tissue, which indicates that ACE\nmay be involved in adipocyte growth and metabolism\nresulting in the regulation of obesity-related traits.23\nAngiotensin II, the major effector of RAS, inhibits adipo-\ncyte differentiation and promotes myocytic lipid deposi-\ntion.24 Moreover, angiotensin receptor blockers activate\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma\nactivity and adiponectin secretion.25 Second, ACE I/D gene\npolymorphism may be a major determinant of serum ACE\nlevels.26 Serum ACE levels are markedly higher in the DD\ngenotype than those in the DI or in II genotype; the number\nof the D allele corresponds to increasing concentrations of\nserum ACE,27 consistent with our results that the DD geno-\ntype was associated with overweight/obesity risk in overall\npopulations and Africans, and the D allele was associated\nwith the susceptibility to overweight/obesity in Africans.\nThird, as many genes and polymorphisms contribute to\nRAS activity, the interaction between ACE I/D gene poly-\nmorphism and other functional sequence variants might\naffect the results.28 Finally, comorbidities, gender, and\nethnic background may affect the results. For example, one\nstudy by Settin et al.8 showed that there was no marked\nassociation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and non-\ncomplicated overweight/obesity risk, and two studies5,20\ndemonstrated that the association between ACE I/D gene\npolymorphism and overweight/obesity risk was gender\ndependent. All these prove at least the existence of other\nfactors affecting the role of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in\nthe onset of overweight/obesity, which offers an insight\ninto investigating the association between ACE I/D gene\npolymorphism and overweight/obesity risk in different\npopulations.\nThere have been a number of meta-analyses and studies\nreporting the association between ACE I/D gene polymor-\nphism and the risk of obesity-related diseases. A meta-\nanalysis by Xi et al.9 reported that the D allele was\nassociated with the risk of metabolic syndrome. A meta-\nanalysis by Li29 showed that the D allele was linked with\nessential hypertension in the whole Chinese population. A\nmeta-analysis by Niu et al.30 showed that the D allele was\nassociated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. One study\nby Celik et al.31 showed that the DD genotype was associ-\nated with an increased insulin resistance in women with\npolycystic ovary syndrome. A study by You et al.32 showed\nthat the D allele was closely associated with reduced high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A study by Passaro\net al.33 showed that a gene interaction existed between\nPPAR-2 and ACE I/D polymorphism on BMI and fat\nmass. These previous findings strongly suggest that ACE\nI/D gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of disor-\nders related to overweight/obesity.\nIn our meta-analysis, we found that DD genotype was\nassociated with the risk of overweight/obesity in overall pop-\nulations and Africans. The D allele was correlated with over-\nweight/obesity risk in Africans. However, these findings\nFigure 4.Association between D allele and overweight/obesity risk in Africans. CI: confidence interval; OR: odds ratio.\nshould be interpreted with caution; first, heterogeneities\nacross studies included might affect the results of our meta-\nanalysis, although a random-effects model had been con-\nducted. Second, the variable study designs and small sample\nsize limited the statistical power. Third, although the defini-\ntion of overweight/obesity in the majority of included studies\nence and serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol or low-\ndensity lipoprotein as standards of overweight/obesity. The\nrelationship between these factors and genotype and pheno-\ntype merits attention. For example, Passaro et al.33 reported\nthat ACE DD subjects had a higher BMI and fat mass. Min\net al.34 reported that ACE II genotype was associated with a\nhigher blood pressure. Kotaska et al.35 reported that the ACE\nD allele was the most frequent genetic variant in risk groups\nof dyslipidemic patients. Borzyszkowska et al.36 reported\nthat ACE DD genotype carriers had higher total cholesterol,\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels. Meta-regression analysis was\nunavailable due to the limited data. More association studies\nshould be performed in the future. Finally, the interaction\nbetween ACE I/D gene polymorphism and other loci\ninvolved in the development of overweight/obesity might be\npresent.\nIn conclusion, DD genotype is a risk factor for suscepti-\nbility to overweight/ obesity in overall populations and\nAfricans. The D allele is a risk factor for susceptibility to\noverweight/obesity in Africans. The II genotype might not\nbe a protective factor against the overweight/obesity risk in\noverall populations, Africans, Caucasians and Asians.\nHowever, more case-control studies are needed to elucidate\nthe role ofACE I/D gene polymorphism in overweight/obe-\nsity risk in different populations.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
