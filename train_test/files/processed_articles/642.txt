Based on decades of research, negative school\nexperiences are known risk factors for substance use (Hawkins, Catalano,\nnegative school experiences (including low academic achievement, low\nmotivation, truancy, or acting out in the classroom) are more likely than\nthose with more positive school experiences to use alcohol, cigarettes, and\nmarijuana (e.g., Bachman, Johnston, & O'Malley, 1981; Bryant, Schulen-\ntime when substance use typically begins and then escalates (Johnston,\nO'Malley, & Bachman, 2002), and patterns of behavior related to both\nacademic difficulties and substance use are likely to be established over\nthe course of adolescence, setting the stage for subsequent other problem\nbehaviors and multiple health risks.\nDespite the extensive literature on substance use and academic failure,\nmany important gaps remain. In general, a fuller understanding of the\nimpact of academic experiences on adolescent substance use requires a\nmore in-depth consideration of which academic factors are most\nimportant (and for whom) and how these factors relate to both concurrent\nsubstance use and, particularly, to increased use over time. In the present\nstudy, we addressed three gaps in the literature, including the lack of\nempirical emphasis on (a) diverse indications of academic success and\nfailure, including motivation and school attitudes as well as students'\nperceptions of the academic beliefs of parents and peers; (b) change in\nsubstance use over multiple time points during adolescence; and (c)\npopulation-based variations across gender, ethnicity, and achievement\nlevel. Using our conceptual model, we examined adolescents' academic\npsychosocial background, motivational system, and perceptions of\nparents and peers as they relate to the course of substance use from age\n14 to age 20 in a nationally representative sample, focusing on similarities\nand differences as a function of gender, ethnicity, and eighth-grade\nachievement level.\nFrom a human ecological perspective, adolescents' problem behaviors\nand attitudes are linked across multiple developmental contexts including\nfamily, school, and peer settings (Brofenbrenner, 1979). Jessor and Jessor's\n(1977) problem behavior theory suggests that such school-related\nbehaviors as acting out or skipping classes are likely to be related to\nproblem behaviors in other contexts such as using substances or other\ndelinquent acts. When students are not behaviorally or psychologically\nengaged in the classroom, they tend to cut class, fail to complete their\nmisbehavior may transfer to other settings and provide adolescents with\nmore opportunities to use substances. Beyond connections among\nbehaviors, Jessor and Jessor's theory also highlights how demographics,\nmotivation and belief structures, and students' perceptions of their peer and\nfamily environments provide linkages among problem behaviors, creating\na web of beliefs and behaviors that extends across contexts. By focusing\nonly on academic and substance use problem behaviors, we may overlook\nadolescents' academic beliefs and perceptions of their environment.\nFigure 1 illustrates the conceptual model for the present study. The key\nconcepts are drawn from Jessor and Jessor's (1977) problem behavior\ntheory, including school problem behaviors, motivation and school\nbeliefs, perceived environment, and demographics. As shown in\nFigure 1, academic beliefs and behaviors and demographics are expected\nto be directly related to concurrent adolescent substance use as well as to\nchanges in substance use over time. Ethnicity, gender, and perceptions of\none's ability are associated both with how adolescents negotiate\ndevelopmental transitions and also with adolescents' decision-making\n1994); thus, one would expect these factors to moderate the extent to which\nexperiences and beliefs affect the course of change in substance use.

This decision was based\non previous research indicating that academic achievement and other\nacademic variables (particularly grades) are stable during adolescence\nacademic difficulties typically occur before substance use initiation, and\nthat over time academic variables such as grades and school misbehavior\nare more predictive of substance use than vice versa (Bryant et al., 2000).\nTo some extent, especially during high school, it is likely that adolescents'\nacademic beliefs and behaviors are reciprocally related to their beliefs and\nbehaviors regarding substance use. Nonetheless, it appears that the\npreponderance of the influence works from academic variables to\nsubstance use (Bryant et al., 2000; Schulenberg, Bachman, O'Malley, &\nJohnston, 1994). Thus, the focus of the current article is on the impact of\nadolescents' academic beliefs and behavior on concurrent substance use\nand change in use over time. Such an analysis may help to clarify the role\nthat academics may play in preventing substance use increases over time.\nThe following sections summarize the research literature and expectations\nfor the current research based on the direct and interaction effects on\nadolescents' substance use presented in Figure 1.\nAcademic Achievement\nMany theories explaining substance use during adolescence, such as\nfamily interaction theory (Brook, Whiteman, & Gordon, 1983), the social\ndevelopment model (Hawkins & Weis, 1985), and problem behavior\ntheory (Jessor & Jessor, 1977), have associated adolescents' academic\nachievement and skills with substance use (Petraitis et al., 1995). In\nempirical studies, school failure has been well documented as a risk factor\nfor problem behaviors in general (Dryfoos, 1990) and for substance use\nspecifically (Bachman et al., 1981; Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, &\nFogg, 1978). Relatively few studies, in comparison, have associated\nadolescents' achievement levels with change in substance use over time\n& Cushing, 1997). Consistent with previous research, we expect that\nadolescents who report low academic achievement will report higher\nconcurrent use of substances and, to a lesser extent, increased substance\nuse over time. Some studies revealed links between academic achieve-\nment and change in substance use over time (e.g., Bryant et al., 2000;\nLuthar & Cushing, 1997) whereas others have not (e.g., Bryant &\nThe direct effects of achievement on substance use may be moderated\nby demographic factors. Previous studies have indicated that males and\nWhites have higher rates of substance use compared with their adolescent\ncounterparts (Johnston et al., 2002) and that there are demographic\ndifferences related to school failure as a risk factor for substance use.\nResearch suggests that White adolescents may be more vulnerable than\nAfrican American adolescents to the impact of school-related risk factors\non substance use (Wallace & Muroff, 2002). In general, girls report higher\ngrades than boys (Frome & Eccles, 1998), and low achievement seems to\naffect girls more negatively than boys. Girls with low levels of academic\nachievement are more at risk than boys with low levels of academic\nachievement for psychological distress and low academic self-concept\nthat school failure may put girls at more risk than boys for problem\nbehaviors such as substance use. Thus, in the current research we expected\nthat low academic achievement would be a stronger risk factor for\nsubstance use for White adolescents than for ethnic minority adolescents\nand for girls than for boys.\nPsychosocial Background\nProblem behaviors such as psychological distress and a propensity to act\nout and misbehave are likely to co-occur during adolescence (Jessor &\nJessor, 1977). A number of studies have linked truancy and psychological\ndistress with adolescent substance use and abuse (Dryfoos, 1990; Hawkins\nfew studies, in comparison, have associated negative school behaviors and\npsychological distress with change in substance use over time (for\nthese studies, we expected to find stronger positive associations between\nschool misbehavior and concurrent substance use, weaker positive\nassociations between loneliness and concurrent substance use, and\nweaker positive associations between these two factors and change in\nsubstance use over time.\nDemographic and achievement differences may moderate the links\nbetween psychosocial background and substance use. For example, with\nrespect to achievement differences and distress, research suggests that the\nimpact of self-esteem on substance use varies by achievement level (Eccles\net al., 1997). Regarding ethnicity and academic behaviors, research on\nurban adolescents indicates that truancy is a risk factor for some\nsubstances for African American adolescents and for other substances\nfor White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Concerning gender\ndifferences, females tend to report less school misbehavior and more\npsychological distress than males, and truancy and problem behavior in\ngeneral appear to be less predictive of increased substance use for females\nthese same differences in the current national study. Research on urban\nadolescents also suggests that psychological distress as a risk factor for\nsubstance use varies by both ethnicity and gender, although findings are\nnot always consistent: School stress has been identified as a risk factor for\nconcurrent substance use for females but not for males (Brunswick &\nand for White, suburban females (not males) but not for urban males or\nfemales who were predominantly African American or Hispanic (Way,\nStauber, Nakkula, & London, 1994). The present study allowed us to\nconsider these mixed findings regarding gender and ethnic differences as\nwell as achievement level differences in a nationally representative\nsample.\nMotivation and School Attitudes\nConsistent with problem behavior theory, adolescents' beliefs about\nschool and their academic expectations appear to be related to problem\nmentioned earlier, there are some gaps in the research linking measures\nof motivation and school attitudes to adolescents' involvement in\nsubstance use. Youth with high levels of achievement motivation and\npositive attitudes who report that they like and are interested in school\nand have high self-perceptions of academic competence and academic\nvalues are less likely to engage in substance use (Brook, Whiteman,\nsuch as planning to graduate from college, is a protective factor associated\nwith less substance use among adolescents (Bachman et al., 1981;\nSchulenberg et al., 1994). As is true for research on adolescents' school\nbehaviors, the research examining school beliefs and change in substance\nuse over the course of adolescence is limited. Adolescents' school beliefs\nand motivation--including their perceptions of school importance, value\nof school experiences, academic self-efficacy, school bonding, and college\nplans--appear to be strongly associated with concurrent substance use,\nbut evidence is mixed about whether they are strongly associated with\nchange in substance use during high school (Bryant et al., 2000; Bryant &\nZimmerman, 2002). In the current study, we expected to find links\nbetween motivation and concurrent substance use, and we considered the\nmixed previous findings regarding change in substance use, as well.\nSome research suggests that positive attitudes toward academics are\nparticularly protective against substance use for high-achieving students\ncompared with low-achieving students, indicating an interactive effect of\nachievement (as included in Figure 1; Evans & Skager, 1992). It is likely\nthat it is the combination of high achievement, high motivation, and\npositive attitudes that protects against increases in substance use over\ntime (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Generally, girls' academic self-\nperceptions are lower than boys' self-perceptions, even though girls'\nreports of achievement are higher (Frome & Eccles, 1998; Pomerantz et al.,\n2002); therefore, gender differences may exist in the association between\nmotivational beliefs and substance use, as well. Positive school attitudes as\nprotective factors against substance use may be less important for African\nAmerican or other minority adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002).\nExamining these interactive effects in a nationally representative sample\nshould help us to understand their meaning--we expected that measures\nof achievement motivation would have greater association with substance\nuse for high-achieving youth, females, and White students than for their\npeers.\nPerceived Environment: Peer and Family Influences\nAdolescents who have positive attitudes toward school and whose\nparents and peers support their education are less likely to use substances\nthan are youth from less education-oriented environments. In general,\nwhen parents are aware of and monitor their adolescents' daily activities,\nadolescents are less likely to engage in problem behavior (Hawkins et al.,\naspect of parental monitoring is knowledge of and involvement with\nadolescents' schoolwork (Adalbjarnardottir & Hafsteinsson, 2001; Chen,\nwith nonusers' parents, parents of adolescents who use substances\nmonitor their schoolwork less and have fewer rules about how they\nspend their time (Coombs & Paulson, 1988). Some research suggests that\nalthough adolescents' perceptions of their families are important for\neducational outcomes, perceptions of peers (peers' substance use, in\nparticular) may be more strongly associated with substance use outcomes\nConsiderable research has shown that adolescents who use cigarettes,\nalcohol, and marijuana are more likely to have friends who also use\nsubstances (Hawkins et al., 1992), reflecting both selection and socializa-\nSchulenberg et al., 1999). Adolescents who perceive that their friends use\nsubstances and skip school are more likely to use substances and\nmisbehave in school than students who perceive that fewer of their\nfriends are involved in deviant behaviors (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002;\nFuligni, Eccles, Barber, & Clements, 2001). A positive network of friends\nwho model and encourage positive behaviors can provide a shield against\nrisks for students who may be having trouble in school (Brown, Dolcini, &\nRegarding the relationship between adolescents' perceptions of parents\nand peers and change in adolescents' substance use over time, recent\nfindings based on growth modeling analyses indicate that adolescents\nwho perceive that peers and parents are using fewer substances and that\ntheir parents monitor their activities are less likely to increase their own\nsubstance use over time (Barnes, Reifman, Farrell, & Dintcheff, 2000;\nShinar, 2001). Much less is known about how adolescents' perceptions of\nparental and peer attitudes and behaviors regarding academics are\nassociated with change in substance use over time. In the current research,\nwe expect, given previous findings, that adolescents' perceptions of peer\ndisapproval of misbehavior and approval of academic success will have\nstronger negative effects on adolescent substance use and change in use\nover time than adolescents' perceptions of parents' school help.\nResearch involving an urban sample of youth provides suggestions\nregarding the interaction effects of academic achievement and demo-\ngraphics on perceived environment. The perception that friends believe\ndoing well in school is important may be particularly protective against\nusing alcohol and other substances for low-achieving students compared\nwith those who are doing better academically, and for African American\nadolescents compared with White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman,\n2002). In addition, the social support from friends may be a more\nimportant protective factor against substance use for girls than for boys\n(Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Finally, research suggests that the negative\neffects of peer pressure and the positive effects of parental monitoring\non adolescent substance use may be stronger for females than for\non a nationally representative sample should help to clarify whether\nthese differences generalize beyond urban samples of adolescents--we\nexpected that peer effects would be stronger for low-achieving and female\nadolescents, and that parent effects would also be stronger for females\nthan for males.\nOverview\nThe main focus of this study was on links between youths' academic\nexperiences and their substance use over the course of adolescence. In\nparticular, we examined how academic experiences, attitudes, and\nperceptions are related to changes in substance use in a nationally\nrepresentative panel of students followed from age 14 to age 20. The study\naddressed the gaps in the existing research by linking motivation to\nsubstance use, considering change in substance use over time, and\nincluding a close examination of achievement and demographic differ-\nences in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. We sought to\ndescribe and explain how initial levels of substance use and intraindivi-\ndual changes in substance use are predicted by interindividual factors\n(psychosocial, motivation, and perceived environmental variables) in the\ntotal sample and as a function of ethnicity, gender, and level of academic\nachievement. Growth curve analysis using hierarchical linear modeling\n(HLM) is an advantageous strategy for examining this multilevel model in\nwhich interindividual factors are included to predict differences among\nindividuals in their initial levels of substance use and rates of change in\nuse over time.\nMETHOD\nThis study used data from the Monitoring the Future project, an ongoing\nstudy of adolescents and young adults (Johnston et al., 2002). The project\nhas surveyed nationally representative samples of 12th-grade students\n(from the 48 contiguous United States) each year since 1975, using\nquestionnaires administered in classrooms. In 1991, the project was\nexpanded to include 8th- and 10th-grade students. Of the approximately\nselected in each cohort for follow-up surveys by mail. Participants were\nsurveyed in school in eighth grade and then surveyed by mail biennially\nfor three additional time points (i.e., average ages 16, 18, and 20). Not all\nstudents were 14 in eighth grade; thus, age was included as a predictor in\nthe models.\nSample\nThe final panel sample used for the analyses included 1,897 students from\n(Corrective weights were used to adjust for the oversampling of\nindividuals estimated to be at high risk for school dropout in the panels\nso that the samples best represent the original national samples.)\nThe original sample included 4,000 eighth-grade participants. There are\ntwo forms of the questionnaire; based on within-classroom random\nassignment, approximately half of the students completed one form\nwho completed the first form were included in the present sample because\nthe variables of interest were only on this form.\nor other minorities (15.1%). The sample is 51.8% female. On average,\nparticipants reported that either their mother's or their father's highest\nlevel of schooling was ``some college.'' Most youth came from two-parent\nBecause of the requirements of HLM, it is necessary to exclude\nrespondents who are missing data on any of the predictors; incomplete\ndata are permitted for dependent variables, although information is\nrequired for at least one time point (see Table 1 for sample sizes for\ndependent variables at each time point). Of the 1,975 respondents, 78 were\nmissing data on gender or ethnicity, and 661 were missing data on one or\nmore of the other eighth-grade predictors. (For numbers for each of the\npredictors, see Table 2. Note that loneliness, peer support for misbehavior,\nand status of academic success had sizeable missing data--these items\nwere on the last page of the questionnaire.) Rather than excluding a sizable\nportion of the sample for the present HLM analyses, we imputed missing\ndata for all of the predictor variables except for gender and ethnicity.\nMultiple imputation (MI) techniques provide methods for handling\nmissing data where m values are imputed for each missing variable to\ncomplete the data (Rubin, 1987). In following standard procedures, MI\nwas performed for the predictor variables using multiple linear regression\nplus a random component to produce the imputed values (missing value\nanalysis in SPSS 10.0 was used). Predictor variables used in the estimation\nprocess included all of the eighth-grade data for each participant. Five\n(m 5 5) imputed data sets were generated; the value of m 5 5 was chosen to\nyield estimates that were approximately 95% efficient (Rubin, 1987;\nSchafer & Graham, 2002).1 Separate HLM analyses were performed using\nall five of the imputed data sets, and the HLM results represent the effect\nsizes averaged across the five sets of estimates. We excluded students who\nwere missing gender or ethnicity information, bringing the final sample to\nMeans, Standard Deviations, and Skewness of Adolescents' Monthly Substance\nAge\nCigarettes\nAlcohol\nMarijuana\nNote. Responses ranged from 1 to 7.\n1 According to Rubin (1987), the efficiency of an estimate based on m imputations\n(compared with an infinite number) is (11l/m)\u00c0 1, where l is the rate of missing data. When\nrevealed that adolescents who were eliminated from the analyses because\nof missing gender and ethnicity data (n 5 78; 3.9%) reported lower grades\nat age 14 than adolescents who were included in the analyses (n 5 1,897);\nno other significant differences were found.\nMeasures\nTwo levels are included in growth curve models. Level 1 represents\nrepeated measures that vary within the individual over time--in this case,\nsubstance use. Level 2 represents factors that vary between individuals--\nin this case, eighth-grade predictor variables that include demographic,\npsychosocial background, motivation, and contextual factors.\nLevel 1--Intraindividual change. Means, standard deviations, and\nskewness information for Level 1 substance use variables from age 14 to\nage 20 are presented in Table 1.

These measures, which have been used in national panel studies\nfor decades, have adequate psychometric properties (O'Malley, Bachman,\nLevel 2--Interindividual factors. Means, standard deviations, and\nscale information for Level 2 (individual) psychosocial background,\nmotivation factors, school attitudes, and perceived environment variables\nare reported in Table 2. All variables were measured at eighth grade.\nEthnicity, gender, and age. Students reported their gender, a description\nof their ethnicity, and their age in years. Possible ethnicity responses\nwere Native American or American Indian, Black or African American,\nMexican American or Chicano, Cuban American, Puerto Rican\nAmerican, Other Latin American, Oriental or Asian American, White or\nCaucasian, or other. Groups used in the analyses included White\n(comparison group), African American, Latino, and other (because of\nthe relatively small subsamples, all of the other minority students were\nincluded in the other minority group for the analyses). Students reported\nrepresent years of age.\nParental education. Participants reported the highest completed\nlevel of schooling of their father and of their mother separately, and\nthe higher of the two was used in the analyses. Possible responses\nincluded: 1 5 completed grade school or less, 2 5 some high school,\n3 5 completed high school, 4 5 some college, 5 5 completed college,\n6 5 graduate or professional school after college, 7 5 don't know or does\nnot apply (categorized as missing data).\nAcademic achievement. Academic achievement was measured by a\nsingle item--youths' self-report of their average grade during the\nSchool misbehavior. This composite consisted of a mean of students'\nstandardized reports of school suspensions in their lifetime (3-point scale),\ndays of school skipped (7-point scale), and classes skipped (6-point scale)\nduring the previous 4 weeks, as well as reports of how often in the past\nyear respondents were sent to the office or had to stay after school because\nthey misbehaved (5-point scale; four items, Cronbach's alpha 5 0.66;\nLoneliness. Students reported on a 5-point scale how much they agreed\nor disagreed with two statements about loneliness (i.e., ``A lot of times I\nfeel lonely, I often feel left out of things''; Cronbach's alpha 5 .72;\nSchulenberg, Wadsworth, O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 1996).\nSchool interest. Students reported on a 5-point scale how often over the\nprevious year they found their course work interesting (one item).\nPerceived school difficulty.

Students reported on a 5-point scale how often over the previous\nyear they tried to do their best work in school (one item).\nSchool bonding. Respondents indicated on a 5-point scale how much they\nenjoyed, and how much they hated (reverse coded), being in school during\nCollege plans. Students reported on a 4-point scale how likely it is they\nwill graduate from college (four-year program; one item).\nParental school support. Respondents reported on a 4-point scale how\noften their parents (or stepparents or guardians) check on whether they\nhave done their homework and provide help with their homework when it\nis needed (two items, Cronbach alpha 5 0.83).\nPeer support for school misbehavior. This was a composite of adolescents'\nreport of how they think most of the students in their classes would feel if\nthey (the respondents) cheated on a test or intentionally did things to make\nthe teacher angry (two items: 1 5 they would like it very much, 5 5 they\nwould dislike it very much; reversed coded) and how often they find that\ntheir friends encourage them to do things that their teachers would not\nlike (one item: 1 5 never, 5 5 almost always; total of three items, Cronbach\nStatus of academic success at school. Respondents reported how im-\nportant good grades and college plans are for being looked up to or having\nhigh status at school (1 5 no importance, 5 5 very great importance; two\nitems, Cronbach's alpha 5 .83).\nData Analytic Approach\nIn HLM growth curve models, intraindividual factors (Level 1 factors) are\nthe occasions of measurement (Time 1, Time 2, etc.) nested within\nindividuals; interindividual factors (Level 2) are demographic, psychoso-\ncial, motivational, and family and peers variables (Bryk & Raudenbush,\n2002). At Level 1 in the current research, adolescent substance use was\ninitial use at age 14 (eighth grade) as the intercept. At the interindividual\nlevel (Level 2), demographic, psychosocial background, motivational, and\nfamily and peer factors were entered to explain differences in adolescents'\nsubstance use at age 14 (concurrent use), and rates of intraindividual\nlinear and quadratic change in substance use from ages 14 to 20. The linear\nfactor describes the linear growth in substance use, and the quadratic\nfactor describes acceleration in the rates of change. The growth models\nwere estimated separately for cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana using full\nML estimation in HLM. In the final set of analyses, interaction effects of\nethnicity, gender, and achievement level were examined. The interaction\nmodels were estimated using full ML estimation including z-scored\npredictors for noncategorical variables; consistent with standard practice\nin the literature, all dummy variables (gender and ethnicity) were reco-\nded (\u00ad1,1), and interaction terms were created where each predictor\nwas multiplied in turn by ethnic minority status, then gender (e.g., Afri-\nachievement status at age 14 (standardized age 14 academic achievement;\nAiken & West, 1991). Omnibus tests were performed to reduce the\nprobability of Type I errors. Details regarding the analyses are presented in\nthe Appendix.\nRESULTS\nUnconditional Model (Average Growth Models)\nResults from the unconditional growth model for cigarettes, alcohol, and\nmarijuana are presented in Table 3 (described in Equations A1\u00adA4 in the\nAppendix). The results from the unconditional model indicated a\nsignificant linear increase for all three substances and a significant\nquadratic effect in rates for alcohol and marijuana use (see the mean\nLinear Model of Growth in Substance Use (Unconditional Model)\nFixed Effect Coefficient SE t ratio df p value\nRandom Effect Variance Component w2 df p value\nReliability of OLS Regression Coefficient Estimates\ngrowth rates and mean acceleration in the fixed effects portion of\nTable 3). The significant linear effect for all three substances was posi-\ntive, indicating that adolescents, in general, increased their use over\ntime; the significant quadratic effect for alcohol was positive, indicating\nan acceleration in the rate of increase over time; and the significant\nquadratic effect for marijuana was negative, indicating a deceleration in\nthe rate of increase over time. The random effects portion of Table 3\nindicates that adolescents differed significantly in their initial (age 14)\nlevels of cigarette and alcohol use (po.0001), that the rates of\nlinear increases in cigarette and marijuana use differed significantly\nacross individuals, and that acceleration in rates of alcohol use and\ndeceleration in rates of marijuana use differed across individuals.\nAlthough 4.1% of the adolescents reported some use of marijuana\nat age 14 (and the mean was significantly different from zero as indi-\ncated in the top portion of Table 3), there was no significant variation\n(p4.50) in the means on the 7-point scale. The reliabilities for\nestimating the intercepts and slopes were acceptable, though not very\nhigh, especially for the marijuana use intercept (whereas the relia-\nbilities for estimating the linear and quadratic change rates of marij-\nuana use were high).

Based on the model including all eighth-grade\npredictors, and as indicated in the first column of Table 4, eighth-grade\n(age 14) cigarette use was higher for females than for males, and higher for\nWhite students than for African American and Latino students. In terms of\npsychosocial background, eighth-grade cigarette use was higher for\nstudents who reported lower academic achievement and higher school\nmisbehavior than their counterparts; likewise, regarding motivation and\nschool attitudes, cigarette use was higher for students who reported lower\nlevels of effort, school bonding, and college plans compared with their\ncounterparts. In terms of perceived environment, eighth-grade cigarette\nuse was higher among students who perceived that their peers would\nsupport their school misbehavior than those who did not.\nIn regard to predicting variation in change in cigarette use over time, the\nlinear increase in cigarette use from age 14 to age 20 was greater for Whites\nthan for African Americans and Latinos, and was greater for those with\nlower eighth-grade academic achievement.\nAlcohol use. Based on the model including all eighth-grade\npredictors, eighth-grade (age 14) alcohol use was higher for females\nthan for males, and higher for White students than for African American\nstudents (see Table 4). Students who reported higher levels of school\nmisbehavior and lower levels of loneliness reported higher concurrent\neighth-grade alcohol use. In terms of motivation and school attitudes,\nadolescents who reported lower levels of school interest and college plans\nreported higher concurrent alcohol use in eighth grade compared with\n2 Because the substance use was not normally distributed (see skewness and kurtosis in\nTable 1), and because the measure of substance use in this study was not an equal unit scale,\nmultiple approaches were used to examine whether results were robust to assumption\nviolations.

Details\nregarding these analyses are available from the first author.\ntheir counterparts. Regarding the perceived environment, students who\nreported that their peers supported misbehavior and that they received\nless school help from parents were more likely to report concurrent eighth-\ngrade alcohol use.\nIn terms of quadratic growth, females' rates of increase in alcohol use\nshowed less acceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with males, and\nAfrican American adolescents' rates of increase in alcohol use also showed\nless acceleration over this period compared with White students. With\nregard to psychosocial background, for adolescents who reported more\nschool misbehavior, their rates of increase in alcohol use showed less\nacceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with adolescents who\nreported less school misbehavior. At age 14, adolescents who reported\nhigh school misbehavior were already using more alcohol than adoles-\ncents who reported low misbehavior; therefore, their trajectory starts off\nmuch higher and has a slower rate of increase. In contrast, adolescents\nwho reported higher3 college plans reported less alcohol use at age 14, but\ntheir alcohol use rates accelerated quickly from age 14 to age 20 compared\nwith youth with lower college plans (see Figure 2). As Figure 2 indicates,\nadolescents with college plans at age 14 actually were using more alcohol\nby age 20 than their peers without college plans (it is likely that most of\nthese students were at age 20 in college where alcohol use is common; e.g.,\nMarijuana use. The data in Table 4 indicate that, for linear growth in\nthe model including all eighth-grade predictors, females increased their\nmarijuana use more than males, and other minority students (not African\nAmericans or Latinos) increased their marijuana use less than White\nstudents. In terms of psychosocial background, students who reported\nhigher levels of school misbehavior and lower levels of academic\nachievement and loneliness increased their marijuana use more than\ntheir counterparts. Adolescents who reported higher levels of school\ndifficulty in eighth grade increased their marijuana use less than those\nwho reported lower levels of school difficulty. In addition, adolescents\nwho reported that more friends condoned misbehavior in eighth grade\nincreased their marijuana use more than those who reported that their\nfriends condoned misbehavior less.\nThe quadratic results for marijuana use indicated that females\ndecelerated their rates of increase in marijuana use more than did males\nduring this period. Compared with White students, other minority\n3 When ``high'' and ``low'' are used in the figures, they refer to 1 SD above or below the\nmean.\nstudents increased their use less yet accelerated their use more from age 14\nto age 20. In addition, low-achieving students increased their marijuana\nuse more than did high-achieving students, but their marijuana use rate\nhad more deceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with high achievers\n(see Figure 3). The findings for high-misbehaving students mirrored those\nfor low achievers: High-misbehaving students increased their use more\nAge\nAlcohol Use\nLow College Plans\nHigh College Plans\nFIGURE 2 Monthly alcohol use from age 14 to age 20 for adolescents reporting low and high\ncollege plans at age 14.

Because\nthese models included 73 predictors to model both substance use at age 14\nand rates of linear and quadratic change in substance use, the possibility of\nmaking a Type I error was high. Thus, an omnibus test was performed for\nthe set of interactions as a whole for the intercept and each of the slopes\nacross each of the substances (with p set at .05); in addition, only\nindividual effects significant at the po.01 level were considered. The\nomnibus test for all interactions (the null hypothesis was that no\ninteractions exist) was significant for the cigarette use intercept, w2(57) 5\nFor the cigarette use intercept (monthly cigarette use at age 14), two\ninteractions were significant at the po.01 level. As reported earlier, eighth-\ngrade school misbehavior was a risk factor for concurrent cigarette use,\nbut the significant interaction revealed that it was more of a risk factor for\nWhites than for African American students (po.001). In addition, a gender\ninteraction revealed that high-achieving females use more cigarettes than\nmales in general and than low-achieving males (po.01). A Gender \u00c2\nAchievement interaction was also found for the linear slope, where low-\nachieving girls use fewer cigarettes in eighth grade but increase their use\nmuch more than boys or high-achieving girls over time (po.01; similar to\nthe quadratic effect described next for alcohol use and shown in Figure 4).\nAn Achievement \u00c2 School Misbehavior interaction revealed that having\nhigh grades was protective only for students with low school misbehavior;\nadolescents reporting high levels of misbehavior did not differ in their\nmarijuana use by achievement level (po.01; similar to the quadratic effect\ndescribed next for alcohol use and shown in Figure 5).\nFor the alcohol use intercept, two achievement interactions were found:\nHigh levels of school bonding and college plans were actually risk factors\nfor adolescents who reported high grades but were more protective for\nthose who reported low grades (po.01). For the acceleration in alcohol\nuse from ages 14 to 20 (quadratic term), ethnicity and achievement\ninteractions were found. As noted previously, college plans at eighth\ngrade were associated with an acceleration in the rate of increase in alcohol\nuse; however, this risk factor held for White students but not for the other\nminority group of adolescents (po.01). Although we found that females in\nAge\nAlcohol Use\nFemales High Achievement\nFemales Low Achievement\nMales High Achievement\nMales Low Achievement\nFIGURE 4 Gender \u00c2 Achievement interaction on quadratic growth (acceleration) in alcohol\nuse from age 14 to age 20.

Second, although\nfemales tended to have greater increases in marijuana use over time\n(compared with males), this was a particular tendency of females who\nreported at eighth grade that they put higher effort into their schoolwork\n(po.01). These results suggest that for females, putting effort into doing\ntheir best work in school could be stressful, or it could be that both using\nmarijuana and reporting increased effort to do good work in school is\nassociated with social desirability for females.\nDISCUSSION\nKey challenges for advancing our understanding of difficulties during\nadolescence concern how various domains of young peoples' lives\ninterrelate concurrently, how risk and protective factors unfold over time,\nand how key formative experiences vary in their impact as a function of\npurpose in this study was to advance the understanding in these areas by\naddressing three specific gaps in the literature: the lack of empirical\nemphasis on (a) diverse indications of academic success and failure,\nincluding motivation and school attitudes as well as students' perceptions\nof the academic beliefs of parents and peers; (b) change in substance use\nover multiple time points during adolescence; and (c) population-based\nvariations across gender, ethnicity, and achievement level.\nThis study provides new and needed evidence that school-related\nfactors beyond low academic achievement contribute to both concurrent\nsubstance use and changes in substance use over time. As expected from\nproblem behavior theory, high levels of reported school misbehavior and\nlow levels of academic achievement early in adolescence were associated\nwith high concurrent cigarette use and increased cigarette and marijuana\nuse over time. These findings build on problem behavior theory in their\nattention to the relation between problem behaviors rather than clustering\nproblem behaviors together (Jessor & Jessor, 1977). The study also\nprovides some support for including motivation and school attitudes in\ncurrent models regarding academics and substance use (e.g., Hawkins &\nlevels of school interest, school effort, school bonding, and college plans,\nthey were less likely to report concurrent cigarette and alcohol use. We\nfound evidence that Jessor and Jessor's (1977) perceived environment\nfactors likely play a part in the link between academic difficulties and\nsubstance use. Adolescents' perceptions of their parents' provision of\nschool help and their peers' attitudes regarding misbehavior were\nassociated with concurrent substance use and change in use over time.\nThis helps to show that the perceived environment includes school\nbehaviors as well the substance use values and behaviors of parents and\npeers, whose effects on adolescent substance use have been well\ndocumented.\nAlthough these results do not establish causal connections among these\nexpanded academic factors and substance use, they provide strong\nsupport for models of problem behavior and of substance use prevention\nthat include consideration of adolescents' academic beliefs and behaviors.\nAccounting for these different behavioral, motivational, and perceived\nenvironment factors related to school may help us tap into the low school\nindicates a lack of structure in adolescents' lives. Adolescents with a\ncombination of negative school experiences and negative attitudes may\nmiss out on formative academic experiences in the classroom and, instead,\nmay affiliate with other delinquent peers and skip school. This lack of\nstructure and exposure to delinquent peers is likely to permeate multiple\ncontexts of development and be associated with increased substance use\nWe expand on previous research regarding academics and substance\nuse by providing information about how the different academic factors\nwere associated with change in substance use from early to late\nadolescence. Notably, the patterns of change in substance use from age\n14 to age 20 varied depending on the type of substance, yet similarities\ncould be identified in terms of predictors of change. Adolescents who\nreported higher grades in early adolescence were less likely to increase\ntheir cigarette and marijuana use over time. The study provided little\nsupport, however, for the motivation variables as predictors of change in\nsubstance use over the course of adolescence. This suggests that the\nprotective effects of enhanced achievement motivation and positive\nschool attitudes early in adolescence do not provide added value at the\nend of and beyond high school, beyond their possible indirect contribu-\ntion via early educational success. The context of substance use is altered\nduring these latter years, when more of the adolescents who were high\nachievers in early adolescence may be using substances--particularly\nalcohol and, to a lesser extent, marijuana. It may be that early experiences\nof achievement and high levels of motivation are protective factors against\nincreased cigarette use over time but not as protective against alcohol and\nmarijuana use. Well-adjusted and motivated young adolescents may be\nless inclined to initiate alcohol and marijuana use early but have the\npotential to increase their alcohol and marijuana use at a faster rate during\nthe transition to the college years (Schulenberg & Maggs, 2002). Entering\ncollege, for many adolescents, is associated with major developmental\ntransitions regarding social relationships with peers, contexts of social\ninteraction, and self-regulation and self-perceptions, all of which could\nalso be associated with alcohol use (Bachman, Wadsworth, O'Malley,\nIn the nationally representative sample used here we found that the\nresults were generally, but not entirely, robust with respect to adolescents'\ngender, ethnicity, or achievement level. The close attention to context,\nhowever, emphasized by Steinberg, Darling, and Fletcher (1995), adds\ndepth to our understanding of the links between academics and substance\nuse and may provide information for more context-specific prevention\nmodels. Some evidence indicated that school misbehavior was a risk\nfactor for concurrent cigarette use more for Whites than for African\nAmerican students, suggesting that school misbehavior and cigarette use\nmay have stronger associations in terms of problem behavior for White\nyouth, or that the contexts of use may be different for African American\nand White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002; Wallace & Muroff,\n2002). We also found that the protective effects of school attitudes vary by\nachievement level, supporting some previous limited evidence (Bryant &\nZimmerman, 2002). College plans and bonding to school were more\nprotective in terms of concurrent alcohol use for adolescents reporting low\ngrades and more of a risk factor, even at eighth grade, for concurrent\nalcohol use for students with higher grades. For youth who are having\ndifficulty in school, bonding to school and having plans for college may\ncompensate for the increased risk due to their school difficulties. In terms\nof the high achievers, Evans and Skager's (1992) work also suggests that\nacademically successful substance users have high educational aspira-\ntions during early adolescence. The gender differences indicated that\nlow-achieving girls, in particular, those who have difficulty in school, may\nbe at risk for increased cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use over time.\nThis suggests that low-achieving girls may cope differently with school\nstresses or difficulties or have different social supports or peer groups\ncompared with boys or high-achieving girls. Replicating some of the\nsubgroup findings from urban samples in the national sample, as well as\nidentifying additional subgroup differences, helps to validate the\ninclusion and examination of contextual factors in models of substance\nuse etiology and prevention.\nSimilar to the findings regarding concurrent substance use, the results\nregarding change in substance use were largely the same across ethnicity,\ngender, and achievement level. The interactions regarding acceleration in\nthe alcohol use slope provide additional information vis-a\n`-vis varying\nlevels of risk for alcohol use increases, particularly for low-achieving\nstudents. Low-achieving females and low-achieving adolescents who\nreported low school misbehavior also reported lower levels of alcohol at the\nfirst wave, but both groups were more likely to increase their alcohol use at\nfaster rates over time. Together, these results suggest that although low\nachievement may not be a salient marker for risky concurrent alcohol use\namong young adolescents, it may indicate heightened risk for alcohol use\nincreases over time for females and for students who do not exhibit other\nschool problem behaviors. The ethnicity interactions brought to light the\nfact that the risk for accelerated future alcohol use associated with having\nhigh college plans discussed previously may not apply to students from\nsome ethnic minority groups (not African Americans or Latinos). Indeed,\nhaving difficulty with school and low college plans are risk factors for these\nother ethnic minority students for faster substance use increases over time.\nStrengths and Limitations\nSeveral strengths and limitations--including issues related to general-\nizability, measurement, and longitudinal designs and methods--need to\nbe recognized in the current research. In the understanding of develop-\nmental phenomena, large-scale longitudinal survey research can help\nprovide a needed emphasis on populations and important subgroups. The\ncurrent study involves a nationally representative sample of adolescents\nfrom the United States, permitting conclusions to be generalizable across\nthis population and defined subgroups; furthermore, youth are followed\nover multiple time points, permitting the consideration of trajectories of\nsubstance use. The conclusions, however, must be considered in light of\nmissing data and attrition, a limitation ubiquitous to large-scale long-\nitudinal studies. Youth who were missing substance use data at the last\ntime point were more likely to use substances earlier, resulting in less\nvariation in the outcome variables. Thus, the effects of predictors may, in\nfact, be underestimated. In addition, the same model was used for the\nmissing data imputation as in the HLM data analysis. Although this is\nstandard procedure, using different multiple imputation models (for\nexample, using additional variables to predict missing values, but not\nusing those variables in the analysis) could conceivably strengthen the\nHLM results and better meet the assumption of multiple imputation that\ndata are missing at random (Schafer & Graham, 2002).\nThough extensive in scope, the study is limited to some degree by the\nmeasurement of the predictors and of substance use. All of the measures are\nbased on adolescents' self-report and some are based on single-item\nmeasurement. Including more reliable measures and additional informa-\ntion from peers, parents, and teachers regarding the nature of adolescents'\nexperiences in peer, home, and school contexts would help us understand\nschool and substance use connections. Collecting substance use data more\nfrequently (rather than at 2-year intervals) would also help provide a\nmore accurate representation of substance use among youth during\nadolescence.\nAlthough we considered predictors of change in substance use over\ntime, we did not consider issues of causality or reciprocal effects. Many\naspects of adolescents' academic trajectories, including beliefs and\nbehaviors, have been established before eighth grade and may have\nalready contributed to and been affected by adolescents' behaviors and\nbeliefs about substance use before the study began. Nonetheless, we were\nable to consider correlates of change in substance use over the course of\nadolescence with some suggestions as to how these may be related to\nadolescents' academic experiences and beliefs.\nAs suggested earlier, a major strength of the study is the longitudinal\ndesign covering middle to late adolescence when extensive change in\nsubstance use tends to occur. This research could be extended by\nexamining how change in, in addition to the static influences of, academic\nexperiences and beliefs relates to change in substance use over time. For\nexample, Hawkins, Guo, Hill, Battin-Pearson, and Abbott (2001) showed\nhow school bonding (which we found to be one of the more powerful\npredictors of concurrent, but not change in, substance use) changes over\nthe course of adolescence, and it would be beneficial to see how these\nvarious ``moving targets'' work together. Our study helps set the stage for\nsuch future efforts by covering an extensive range of academic factors and\nshowing how these factors relate to substance use among adolescents in\nthe United States.\nImplications\nThe results indicate that multiple dimensions of adolescents' academic\nexperiences, more than just school failure, relate to substance use and\nchange in substance use over time. Prevention implications from Hawkins\net al.'s (1992) review of the literature on risk and protective factors for\nsubstance use included promoting academic achievement and commit-\nment to school. The findings presented here underscore those efforts and\nfurther suggest that school misbehavior is a key risk for substance use, and\nmultiple dimensions of motivation and school support from parents and\npeers are additional protective factors that may help promote positive\nyouth outcomes. The current findings expand on current research by\nconsidering models of substance use change over time and draw attention\nto the fact that risk factors for change in use over time may not be the same\nas risk factors for concurrent use, particularly during times of multiple\ndevelopmental transitions (Schulenberg et al., 2001). Developmentally\nappropriate interventions that target the needs of the different age levels\nand groups may help youth negotiate transitions to high school or\ncollege and avoid health risks (Schulenberg & Maggs, 2002). Preparing\nyouth before they make transitions can buffer them against social and\nacademic stressors they may face in the new school environments.\nTargeting the school behavior and attitudes of adolescents and the\ncontexts of peers and family will also contribute to healthy outcomes for\nadolescents and the reduction of problem behaviors. School-based\nsubstance use prevention programs that have multiple targets and\nmultiple points of intervention are most likely to be effective (Botvin,\n1996). The results support the enrichment of education, the improvement\nof achievement (e.g., increased grades, graduation rates), and reduction of\nschool misbehavior and truancy as desirable outcomes of prevention\nprograms in schools.\nOur results suggest that some risk and protective factors differ in their\nsalience depending on the substance, on whether we refer to concurrent\nuse or changes over time, and on the background characteristics of the\nadolescents. The challenge, then, for researchers, prevention scientists,\nand those interested in promoting healthy outcomes for youth is how to\ndesign programs that best target these risk and protective factors for\nvulnerable young people at developmentally appropriate times.\nAPPENDIX\nDetails regarding the hierarchical models are described as follows.\nModels of Intraindividual Change (Level 1)\nIn the intraindividual change or Level 1 model, occasions of measurement\nare nested within the individual. The following equation specifies the\ngrowth model within students:\nYti\nati\nti\n\u00fe eti\nwhere Yti\nis the observed status (substance use) at time t for individual i;\nis the intercept (initial status at age 14) or the substance use of\nindividual i at ati\nis the yearly rate of change in substance use for\nis the linear term where 0 is age 14, 2 is\nindividuals); p2i\nis the rate of acceleration in the change (or the curvature of\nthe change); and ati\n2 is the quadratic term, which is the linear term\nsquared. Errors are represented by eti\nwith common variance s2; the\nassumption of homogeneity of this variance at Level 1 (across the time\npoints) is described in the Results section.\nInterindividual Models (Level 2)\nThe first step in a growth curve model is to estimate a Level 1\n(intraindividual) model that is unconditional at Level 2 to examine\nwhether there are significant linear and quadratic increases in substance\nuse across all students (fixed effects), and whether students differ in their\ninitial status (p0i\n) and their rates of change (p1i\n; random effects). These\nunconditional models were estimated using full maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimation in HLM for each of the substances (cigarettes, alcohol,\nand marijuana) separately. In the interindividual level, or Level 2, model,\nthe growth parameters (p0i\n) become outcomes modeled as a\nfunction of student characteristics. In the unconditional model, no\nindividual-level predictors were included. That is,\nwhere significant bs indicate that initial substance use (b0 0\n) and linear\n) and quadratic (b2 0\n) increases in use are significantly greater than\nzero. Significant between-student variance in r0i\n, the errors at\nthe individual level, indicates that students differ significantly in their\ninitial status and rates of change.\nIndividual-level predictors were introduced into the Level 2 models in\nthe next step, which was estimated using full ML estimation in HLM, to\nmodel the significant variance in the intercepts (initial status at age 14) and\nlinear and quadratic slopes (rates of change and acceleration or\ndeceleration in rates of change between ages 14 and 20):\n\u00f0African American\u00de \u00fe 0 3\n\u00f0Latino\u00de\n\u00f0Other Minority\u00de \u00fe 0 5\n\u00f0Parental Education\u00de\n\u00f0Academic Achievement\u00de \u00fe 0 7\n\u00f0School Misbehavior\u00de\n\u00f0School Interest\u00de\n\u00f0Parents0 School Help\u00de\n\u00f0Peer Misbehavior\u00de\n\u00f0Status of Academic Success\u00de \u00fe r0i\n\u00f0Status of Academic Success\u00de\n\u00f0Status of Academic Success\u00de\nwhere the bs in Equation A5 represent the individual effects on initial (age\n14) rates of substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana use) and the bs\nin Equations A6 and A7 (the patterns are the same as in Equation A5)\nrepresent the individual effects on linear and quadratic rates of change in\nsubstance use.\n"
