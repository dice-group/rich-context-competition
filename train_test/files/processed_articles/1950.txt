Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \n \nChildhood abuse can dismantle relationships and\nwell-being over the life course. Experience of parental\nabuse during childhood has detrimental implications not\nonly for childhood health and well-being but also for health\nand well-being in adulthood (e.g., Corliss, Cochran, &\nBanyard, 2006). Despite these repercussions of childhood\nabuse, not all victims end up psychologically and physically\nunhealthy. In fact, resiliency from the effects of abuse may\nbe true of some victims (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno, Papa, &\nexamined resilience following child abuse.\nMany factors may play a role in resilient functioning fol-\nlowing childhood abuse, including psychosocial resources\n(e.g., personal control, support; Cromer & Sachs-Ericsson,\nKrause, 2002). Findings from prior studies suggest that\nlower levels of psychosocial resources account for poorer\noutcomes. Yet, surprisingly absent from the literature is\nconsideration of individuals who experienced childhood\nabuse but who were able to secure critical psychosocial re-\nsources, thus fostering resilience to the abuse. Therefore,\nthis study examines whether the presence of psychosocial\nresources in adulthood is associated with better well-being\namong victims of childhood parental abuse.\nChildhood physical abuse: a conceptual\ndefinition\nThe literature generally classifies three types of abuse:\nsexual, emotional, and physical, and oftentimes, physical and\nsexual abuse are examined together (Chapman, Dube, &\nLipman, MacMillan, & Boyle, 2001).Yet, assessments find the\nindependent effects of physical abuse are just as detrimental\nto well-being as sexual abuse (Chapman et al.; Rodgers et al.,\n2004), and physical abuse may occur more often than sexual\nabuse (16% vs. 9%; U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2008). Therefore, we consider independent effects\nof parental physical abuse in childhood.\nMeasurements of childhood physical abuse often refer to\ninstances of extreme abuse (e.g., kicking, biting, punching,\nhitting, choking, or burning a child) by one or both parents\nther demarcation also occurs between severe forms (e.g.,\npushing, grabbing, or shoving; slapping) and very severe\nforms (Corliss et al., 2002; Irving & Ferraro; Pepin &\nBanyard, 2006). These distinctions are important for under-\nstanding abuse among adults of different ages. The use of\nphysical punishment across cohorts suggests that accept-\nable forms of discipline for children in the early part of the\n20th century may now be considered \"severe\" forms of\nphysical abuse (e.g., slapping; Forehand & McKinney,\n1993). \"Very severe\" abuse, however, has not been consid-\nered a widespread form of discipline for people of any ages.\nTherefore, we examined the impact of very severe physical\nabuse by parents in childhood due to its long-reaching\neffects across different cohorts.\nResilience and potential long-term effects of\nchildhood abuse\nTheories of resilience and cumulative disadvantage may of-\nfer explanations for why some victims of parental childhood\nphysical abuse have poor health and well-being in adulthood\nand why other victims report relatively better health and well-\nbeing. Though cumulative disadvantage posits that negative\nevents can set an individual on a trajectory of poor outcomes\nare not unchangeable over the life course (Ferraro & Shippee,\n2009). That is, some adults may be resilient to the effects of\nparental physical abuse in childhood and maintain healthy and\nPsychosocial Resources and Associations Between\nChildhood Physical Abuse and Adult Well-being\nLindsay M. Pitzer and Karen L. Fingerman\nChild Development and Family Studies, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\nChildhood physical abuse is often associated with detrimental physical and psychological consequences in adult-\nhood. Yet, some adults appear to overcome effects of very severe parental physical abuse in childhood. This study\nconsidered whether psychosocial resources (i.e., emotional and instrumental support, personal control) explain\nvariability in well-being for adults who experienced childhood physical abuse by their parents. Participants in-\ncluded 2,711 adults aged 25\u00ad74 years from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS I) study. Moderation models\nrevealed that high levels of personal control were associated with better physical and psychological functioning\namong adults who were physically abused as children. Thus, personal control may be a key factor to health and\nwell-being and thus resilient functioning following childhood abuse.\nKey Words: Adulthood well-being--Childhood physical abuse--Psychosocial resources.\nPitzer and Fingerman\nstable levels of psychological and physical functioning\ntraumatic events during childhood may impede the develop-\nment of psychosocial resources for many individuals (Bowlby,\nresources, avoidance of other traumatic events, and/or access\nto other supportive adults during the abuse may foster resil-\nience, thus making room for optimal levels of well-being\n(Houshyar & Kaufman, 2005). This support in childhood may\nbe a precursor to other positive and protective events, including\nthe development of effective personal control, social networks,\nand the ability to take advantage of critical turning points and\nopportunities across the life course (e.g., a good marriage,\nwork stability, educational attainment; Masten et al., 2004).\nTherefore, we wanted to understand how the presence of\npsychosocial factors may foster resilience in adults who ex-\nperienced very severe parental physical abuse in childhood\nand how the lack of such resources may be detrimental to\nhealth and well-being. Although there are numerous re-\nsources to examine, the benefits of personal control and so-\ncial supports (emotional and instrumental) warrant\nconsideration because of their positive associations with\nwell-being (Irving & Ferraro, 2006; Ross & Mirowsky,\n2003). We chose to focus on perceived constraints (or lack\nof personal control) because perceived constraints do not\ndepict the person's sense of efficacy or effectiveness in car-\nrying out goals but represent beliefs that there are uncon-\ntrollable obstacles or factors that may interfere with those\ngoals (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). These thoughts may be\ntrue for victims of childhood physical abuse, and overcom-\ning such \"obstacles\" may be important to health and well-\nbeing. For example, perceived constraints may affect\nassociations between abuse and well-being and precipitate\nbeliefs that health and happiness are unattainable. A lack of\nperceived constraints (or strong personal control) may be\nkey in fostering health and well-being among victims of\nvery severe parental physical abuse in childhood.\nFurthermore, prior studies have found that victims of pa-\nrental physical abuse in childhood typically fare worse than\nindividuals who did not experience such abuse because of a\nlack of close relationships (Pepin & Banyard, 2006; Shaw &\nKrause, 2002). Close relationships are important for happi-\nness and life satisfaction (Rook, Mavandadi, Sorkin, &\nZettel, 2007) and particularly beneficial for those who have\nsuffered adversity (Cohen, 2004). Because the negative im-\npact of stressors is diminished for people with stronger so-\ncial supports (Antonucci, Birditt, & Akiyama, 2009), the\nperception of such support may decrease the psychological\nand physical responses to the abuse and may be important in\npromoting resiliency in later life (Cohen; Fuller-Iglesias,\nSellars, & Antonucci, 2008). Therefore, because of the po-\ntential impact of these psychosocial resources, we consider\nthe implications of current levels of personal control, emo-\ntional support, and instrumental support on well-being for\nvictims of very severe parental physical abuse.\nChildhood physical abuse: potential\nmoderating effects of psychosocial resources\nPrevious literature has already established the mediating\neffects of psychosocial resources and finds that psychoso-\ncial resources weaken the link between childhood physical\nabuse and adult well-being (Horwitz, Widom, McLaughlin, &\nFor example, Shaw and Krause's (2002) examination of\nchildhood abuse in the National Survey of Midlife in the\nUnited States (MIDUS I) suggested that individuals physi-\ncally abused by parents as children had higher levels of de-\npression and reported more chronic conditions and that\npersonal control and emotional support in adulthood medi-\nated this association. Therefore, the effects of parental\nphysical abuse in childhood may vary based on the avail-\nability of psychosocial resources, specifically personal con-\ntrol and support.\nAlthough previous literature enhances our understanding\nof how psychosocial resources may foster resilience in\nadulthood well-being for victims of childhood physical\nabuse, these findings raise the question of variability among\nindividuals who experienced very severe childhood physi-\ncal abuse by their parents. Indeed, it is possible that psycho-\nsocial resources exert moderating associations between\nearly childhood abuse and adult well-being. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that when levels of emotional support, instru-\nmental support, and personal control are higher, victims of\nvery severe childhood physical abuse will exhibit resilience\nto the abuse, thus exhibiting better health and well-being\noutcomes. Conversely, very severe physical abuse in child-\nhood paired with lower levels of support and personal con-\ntrol may result in poorer well-being in adulthood.\nMethods\nSample and Design\nData were from the larger Midlife in the United States\n(MIDUS I), a nationally representative study designed to\nassess how different factors mesh to affect physical health\nand well-being during the transition from early adulthood to\nmidlife and to old age. The protocol included a 30-min\nphone interview and two self-administered questionnaires.\nThe MIDUS oversampled men and older adults. Analyses\nfor this article will only focus on the psychosocial variables\nin adulthood as the MIDUS has only limited retrospective\ndata regarding participants' childhood.\nSample for This Study\nAlthough there were 3,487 main respondents included in\nthe MIDUS I, we limited our study to 2,711 who answered\nkey questions on very severe childhood physical abuse by\nparents and who identified having a mother and a father fig-\nure in childhood. The following section includes a discus-\nsion of the sample creation.\nThe first step in sample creation was to cull participants\nwho answered two of the very severe physical abuse ques-\ntions from the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, 1979). Each\nquestion asked how often (a) a mother or (b) a father\n\"kicked, bit, hit with a fist; hit or tried to hit with something;\nbeat-up; choked; and/or burned or scalded\" the participant\nduring childhood. The second step in sample creation was\nto also select participants who identified two parental fig-\nures during childhood. Including participants who only had\none parental figure may confound the number of parents\nwith the frequency of exposure to physical violence (e.g.,\nShaw & Krause, 2002) and may introduce other factors,\nsuch as death and separation of parents.\nTherefore, of the original MIDUS I participants, 776\n(22%) were dropped from the sample because (a) partici-\npants did not report having both a mother and a father figure\nduring childhood and adolescence (n = 650, 19%) and (b)\nparticipants did not respond to any of the parental very se-\nvere abuse items (n = 126, 3%). The final sample for this\nstudy includes 2,711 adults who either never experienced\nabuse (n = 2,057) or experienced abuse from either one or\nboth of their parents (n = 654), all of whom identified a\nmother and father figure in childhood. Analyses that follow\nused listwise deletion of missing values to deal with item\nnonresponse (e.g., Shaw & Krause, 2002).\nDependent Variables\nNegative affect.--Negative affect was the average of six\nitems assessing current bad mood through the examination\nof negative feelings. The question asked, \"During the past\n30 days, how much of the time did you feel: so sad nothing\ncould cheer you up, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless,\nthat everything was an effort, and/or worthless,\" rated from\n1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time), a = .88. Prior\nresearch on the MIDUS I has also used the average of\nPhysical health status.--For parsimony in analyses, current\nphysical health was represented by an index composed of two\nmeasures: a single item assessing self-rated health, rated from\n1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) and a count of 31 chronic health con-\nditions (e.g., asthma, hypertension, cancer; Shaw & Krause,\n2002). To ensure the health index variable indicated that high-\ner scores reflected better health, we took the \"additive inverse\"\nof the chronic condition score. Using z scores, we standard-\nized the self-rated physical health and chronic condition mea-\nsures and summed them together to create a health problem\nindex (see Antonucci, Ajrouch, & Janevic, 2003).\nIndependent Variable\nVery severe physical abuse.--We created a dichotomous\nvariable (0 = did not experience abuse and 1 = experienced\nabuse) from the original scale used for the two parental abuse\nitems (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = often).\nOur variable represented people who either never experi-\nenced abuse at all during childhood from either parent (e.g.,\nthey responded \"never\" for both items and were coded as\n\"did not experience abuse\") or who experienced abuse from\none or both of their parents (i.e., the respondent answered\n\"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"often\" for either both parents or\nfor just one of his or her parents; these participants were\ncoded as \"experienced abuse\"). Other studies that have used\nthe MIDUS have operationalized their abuse variable as\nexperiencing abuse from one or both of their parents (Corliss\nconsidered different operationalizations of the abuse variable,\nwe conducted the final models using abuse as a continuous\nvariable, as a categorical variable (i.e., 1 = never, 2 = rarely/\nsometimes,3=often),andasthedichotomousvariabledescribed\nearlier. The pattern of findings was identical for each, so we\npresent the final models using the dichotomous variable.\nReasons for dichotomization were threefold. First, much\nof the abuse literature differentiates between experiencing\nthe abuse at all and never experiencing it (e.g., Berenson &\nBanyard, 2006). Second, items comprising the very severe\nabuse variable were skewed toward never (~80%). Third,\nwe found meaningful differences between individuals who\n\"rarely\" and those who \"never\" experienced abuse (i.e., those\nwho were \"rarely\" abused had lower levels of physical\nhealth). Finally, this dichotomy best represents our theo-\nretical perspective that even one experience of very severe\nabuse is a trauma in childhood.\nModerating Variables\nEmotional support.--Participants completed two 4-item\nscales assessing current emotional support from friends and\nfrom family in adulthood (Rossi, 2004). Questions included\n\"How much do members of your family (not including your\nspouse or partner)/friends really care about you?\"; \"How\nmuchdotheyunderstandthewaythatyoufeelaboutthings?\";\n\"How much can you rely on them for help if you have a seri-\nous problem?\"; and \"How much can you open up to them if\nyou have a serious problem?\" Each was rated from 1 (not at\nall) to 4 (a lot). The mean of the eight items was estimated to\ncreate an index of emotional support. Higher scores indicate\nInstrumental support.--Instrumental support was as-\nsessed by the number of hours per month the individual re-\nceived unpaid assistance (not including assistance from the\nPersonal control.--Assessment of personal control in-\ncluded eight questions on perceived constraints (Lachman &\nPitzer and Fingerman\nWeaver, 1998). Example items included \"I have little con-\ntrol over the things that happen to me\" and \"I sometimes\nfeel as if I'm being pushed around in my life.\" Items were\nrated from 1 (agree strongly) to 7 (disagree strongly); thus,\nhigher scores reflect lower levels of perceived constraints.\nThe scale consisted of the mean of the eight items, a = .85.\nResults\nPreliminary Analyses and Analytic Strategy\nDescriptive statistics for the sample are shown in Tables 1\nand 2. Table 1 depicts mean group differences assessed\nusing independent t tests between the abused and nonab-\nused groups. Consistent with other studies investigating\nchildhood abuse using the MIDUS I (e.g., Shaw & Krause,\nabuse by one or both parents. Half of the respondents were\nwomen, and the average age of all participants was 47 years.\nIn general, the mean level for most resources was signifi-\ncantly lower for adults who experienced very severe child-\nhood abuse. Overall, abused respondents had poorer levels\nof personal control and emotional support, as well as poorer\nphysical health and higher levels of negative affect.\nNot all victims of childhood physical abuse had low lev-\nels of resources, however. In fact, we found that there are\nabused individuals who had higher levels of personal con-\ntal support (n = 294). Therefore, Table 2 depicts an analysis\nof mean differences between abused individuals who had\nhigh levels of resources and abused individuals who had\nlower levels of resources. Individuals who were abused\nand who had high levels of personal control and emotional\nsupport generally reported higher mean levels of physical and\npsychological health than abused people with lower levels\nof personal control and emotional support. Additionally,\nabused individuals higher in personal control also had\nhigher mean levels of emotional support. Likewise, abused\nindividuals high in emotional support had higher levels of\npersonal control.\nRegarding high and low scores for support, we used me-\ndian splits to distinguish between low and high levels of\ncontrol and support. Although we recognize limitations\nwhen employing the use of median splits (e.g., loss of\npower; MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002), we\ndid not use the dichotomous median split variables in\nregression analyses where the loss of power would be prob-\nlematic. Rather, we used this split in the figures and Table 2\nbecause we are simply trying to get a glimpse of the differ-\nences among abused individuals who have \"low\" and \"high\"\nlevels of resources. Other studies use a similar approach\n(e.g., Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,\nTo test our research questions, we conducted two ordi-\nnary least squares regression models where negative affect\nand the physical health index were analyzed separately as\ndependent variables. The key independent variable in each\nmodel was very severe physical abuse by parents in child-\nhood. Moderating variables included current levels of emo-\ntional support from friends and family, instrumental support,\nand personal control. For each dependent variable, we esti-\nmated models that included interactions between very se-\nvere physical abuse by parents in childhood and each of the\nTable 1.Descriptive Information for Variables in Models\nExperienced very severe physical abuse\nby one or both parents (n = 654)\nNever experienced Very severe physical\nabuse by one or both parents (n = 2,057)\nM (SD)\nProportions\naComposite physical health scores range from -2.88 to 1.50.

We\ngrand-mean centered the moderating variables prior to esti-\nmating interactions. The abuse variable was not centered\ndue to its dichotomous nature (Jaccard & Turrisi, 2003).\nGiven the large age range of the sample, participant age was\nalso considered in three-way interactions with abuse and\nresources. Patterns did not differ between age groups, how-\never, so we simply controlled for age, along with sex, edu-\ncation, and mother or father still living (i.e., we did not want\nto confound the memories of abuse with the subsequent\ndeath of a parent) in the final models.\nSevere Physical Abuse and Well-being\nModels with significant findings for very severe physical\nabuse in childhood and subsequent well-being in adulthood\nare presented in Table 3. One significant interaction effect\nemerged from each model: Parental Physical Abuse \u00d7\nPersonal Control. In the model predicting physical health, we\nfound significant main effects for parental physical abuse,\npersonal control, emotional support, and instrumental sup-\nport. This indicated that people who were very severely\nphysically abused in childhood by their parents had lower\nlevels of physical health and those who had higher levels of\npersonal control and emotional support reported better\nhealth. Conversely, individuals who reported more instru-\nmental support reported lower physical health levels. In the\nmodel predicting negative affect, we also found significant\nmain effects for abuse, personal control, and emotional sup-\nport. That is, the experience of very severe childhood phys-\nical abuse was associated with worse psychological\nwell-being, whereas higher levels of personal control and\nemotional support were associated with better psychological\nwell-being.\nTable 2.

Regression for Very Severe Physical Abuse, Personal Control, Emotional Support, and Instrumental Support Predicting Adult Physical\nPhysical health Negative affect\nB SE B t B SE B t\nPitzer and Fingerman\nTo explore significant interactions, we estimated post hoc\ntests that included plotting simple regression lines for high\nand low values of the moderator variables (Aiken & West,\nthe control variables, two main effects, and the interaction\nterm. We inserted the unstandardized regression coefficients\nfor the bs and y-intercept and used all possible combina-\ntions of high (+1 SD) and low (-1 SD) values for the mod-\nerators. For the dichotomous abuse variable (the predictor),\nwe inserted 0 to estimate lines for nonabused and 1 for\nabused individuals (Aiken & West). From these analyses,\nwe created \"abused-high,\" \"abused-low,\" \"nonabused-low,\"\nand \"nonabused-high\" values and plotted the predicted val-\nues for each independent variable. The error bars on the fig-\nures represent the standard error of the plotted points or the\naverage deviation from the actual y from the predicted y.\nWith regard to physical health, Figure 1 illustrates the\nsignificant interaction between Parental Physical Abuse \u00d7\nPersonal Control. Individuals with high personal control\nwere in better physical health overall. Specifically, physical\nhealth levels were somewhat comparable between individu-\nals who experienced parental physical abuse and who had\nhigh levels of personal control and their nonabused counter-\nparts. Additionally, the figure shows that very severe abuse is\nassociated with diminished physical health, particularly when\nan individual has lower levels of personal control. These in-\ndividuals exhibited the lowest levels of physical health overall.\nNote that in this figure, the y-axis is restrained to show the\neffect, and the true range of the y-axis is from -2.88 to 1.50.\nFigure 2 depicts the significant interaction between\nparental physical abuse and personal control with regard to\nnegative affect. We found that people who were parentally\nphysically abused as children and who had higher levels of\npersonal control looked comparable with their nonabused\ncounterparts. That is, they too exhibited lower levels of neg-\native affect. Yet, the detrimental association between lower\nlevels of personal control and negative affect seemed par-\nticularly pronounced for individuals who were abused as\nchildren. That is, these individuals seemed to have some of the\nlowest levels of personal control overall. Again, note that\nthe y-axis has been restricted to show the effect, and the true\nrange of the y-axis is 1\u00ad2.24 as the negative affect variable\nwas square root transformed because of high skew.\nTo understand differences between abused and nonab-\nused individuals on physical health and negative affect\nbased on the level of personal control, we employed the\nJohnson\u00adNeyman technique (Hayes & Matthes, 2009;\nJohnson & Neyman, 1936). This technique identifies re-\ngions in the range of personal control where the effect of\nparental physical abuse on negative affect and physical\nhealth is statistically significant and nonsignificant. What\nwe found was that in each model, with the exception of very\nhigh levels of personal control (6.54 and above [out of a\nscale of 7] for the physical health model and 6.32 and above\n[out of a scale of 7] for the negative affect model), abuse\nwas a significant predictor across most levels of personal\ncontrol. Figures 1 and 2 also show that this effect was larger\nfor low values of personal control than for higher values.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether psy-\nchosocial resources are protective against the effects of\nchildhood physical abuse. Prior research has shown that in-\ndividuals who suffered abuse from their parents in child-\nhood suffer poorer physical and psychological health\ncompared with people who did not suffer such abuse (Afifi,\nBrownridge, Cox, & Sareen, 2006; Sachs-Ericsson, Kend-\nthermore, other studies have substantiated mediating effects\nof psychosocial resources and suggested that a lack in re-\nsources can predict poorer well-being in adulthood for\nFigure 1. Physical health and interaction between very severe abuse by one\nor both parents in childhood and personal control.\nFigure 2. Negative affect and interaction between very severe abuse by one\nor both parents in childhood and personal control.\nYet, prior studies had not considered heterogeneity in the\npopulation of adults who were abused as children, not all\nsuch adults incur lack of resources or poorer outcomes.\nConclusions from this study highlighted two important rev-\nelations: (a) very severe parental physical abuse in child-\nhood does not always lead to poor health and well-being in\nadulthood and (b) personal control is a key resource in buff-\nering against detrimental effects of childhood physical\nabuse. These results, therefore, extend prior research by\nshowing that not only did the mean level of resources differ\nfor adults who suffered very severe parental physical abuse\nin childhood versus those who did not, but the potential im-\nplications of these deficits in resources may be worse for\nvictims of parental physical abuse.\nFurthermore, these results are consistent with prior re-\nsearch on resiliency. Resilience to a traumatic event is charac-\nterized by the ability to maintain stable levels of psychological\nthough this study cannot address the \"maintenance\" of stable\nlevels of well-being, the findings suggest that a sense that one\ncan achieve his or her goals is a source of strength for victims\nof childhood physical abuse. The long-term maintenance of\nhealth and well-being after childhood abuse is facilitated by\nthe perception that one can overcome obstacles and barriers\nto goals, which may include a healthier lifestyle.\nPersonal Control and Well-being\nThe importance of personal control was not surprising\ngiven previous research linking personal control to psycho-\nlogical and physical health (Prenda & Lachman, 2001; Ross &\nMirowsky, 2003). Not only may personal control beliefs\nmotivate health behaviors (Skaff, 2007), but personal con-\ntrol and the presence of stable and close relationships were\nmajor factors in children's resilience to abuse in prior stud-\nResults from the present study suggest another component\nin the connection between parental physical abuse in child-\nhood, personal control, and adulthood well-being. From\npreliminary analyses on mean differences, we found that\nindividuals physically abused by their parents in childhood\nwho had higher levels of personal control had higher mean\nlevels of emotional support from friends and family than\nthose who experienced parental physical abuse in childhood\nwith low personal control. These differences suggest that\nemotional support may play an important role in the forma-\ntion of personal control. Although this study did not follow\nparentally abused children over time, findings suggest that\nstable parents, guardians, and other close individuals may\nprovide support to some abused children, fostering develop-\nment of personal control (Ross & Mirowsky; Shaw, Krause,\nChatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004; Uchino,\n2009). This underlying link between emotional support and\npersonal control may explain why emotional support was\nnot a significant moderator.\nContrary to expectations, we did not find that instrumen-\ntal support makes a difference for well-being. Previous lit-\nerature suggested that social support is only effective in\nreducing the effects of stressful events when the form of\nsocial support matches the demands of the event (Cohen,\n2004). Therefore, instrumental support (e.g., help around\nthe house, transportation, childcare) may not be appropriate\nor useful for someone who was physically abused as a child.\nThese individuals may need emotional supports to help fos-\nter a sense of personal control to dampen the long-lasting\neffects of abuse.\nLimitations\nAlthough this study provides new insights on the role of\npersonal control for victims of childhood abuse, it has some\nlimitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the study im-\nplies that we can only speak to associations and not causality.\nFuture research should examine associations among vari-\nables over time to see if the continued presence of personal\ncontrol aids in the maintenance of healthy levels of well-\nbeing for victims of childhood physical abuse. Second, the data\ncollection method confounded reports of physical health and\npsychological well-being with reports of childhood physical\nabuse. Most recent evidence suggests, however, that memo-\nries of specific childhood experiences are highly stable and\nnot subject to mood (Yancura & Aldwin, 2009) and retro-\nspective memories tend to be fairly accurate when remem-\nbering childhood abuse (Hardt & Rudder, 2004).\nFinally, this study is an initial foray in considering how\nindividuals who experienced very severe childhood physi-\ncal abuse vary from one another. Although we examined\ncurrent levels of support and personal control in adulthood,\nthe life course perspective suggests that those psychosocial\nresources may reflect other factors associated with the con-\ntext of abuse in childhood. Presence or absence of resources\nat this measurement point in adulthood is not necessarily\nindicative of the presence or absence of those resources\nthroughout life. There may be many other resources and\nevents that could influence the formation or lack of forma-\ntion of the current resources. Thus, future research should\nconsider psychosocial and social resources received early in\nlife and currently.\nOverall, this study indicates that very severe physical\nabuse in childhood does not suggest that health and well-\nbeing will be poor in adulthood. This study extended prior\nresearch by considering variation in adulthood outcomes of\nearly childhood abuse. Individual differences in health and\nwell-being likely reflect differences in personal control. The\npresence of personal control appears to partially explain\nwhy some individuals are resilient to abuse and why others\nexperience disadvantage. It is important to note, however,\nthat this study only examined the resources that were cur-\nrently present in adulthood. We consider these findings im-\nportant in understanding how events that unfold over the\nPitzer and Fingerman\nlife course have implications on the effects of childhood\nabuse in adulthood. An important next initiative will be to\nexamine the presence of psychosocial resources in child-\nhood and adolescence, understanding whether stability in\nresources plays an important role in stability of well-being\nover time for parentally abused individuals.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship and by\nchology of Intergenerational Transfers\") awarded to K.L.F., principal\ninvestigator.\n"
