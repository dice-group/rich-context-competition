Because of the increasing rates of adult obesity\nand obesity's association with insulin resistance and type\n2 diabetes, the NCEP panel stated that the metabolic syn-\ndrome will soon have a greater impact on premature coro-\nnary artery disease than does tobacco.8 According to re-\ncent estimates, the metabolic syndrome affects 22% of\nthe US adult population overall, including 7% of men and\nAs childhood overweight increases,10,11 its medical\ncomplications are becoming more common and more fre-\nquently recognized.12-14 For example, the prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes has risen dramatically among adoles-\ncents in the past 20 years.13 Studies suggest that a sub-\nstantial percentage of overweight children and adoles-\ncents may be afflicted with the metabolic syndrome\nbecause many have 1 or more of the following: an el-\nevated triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, and\nhigh blood pressure.15,16 Many overweight children also\nhave elevated insulin levels, indicating an increase in in-\nsulin resistence.16 When one considers that autopsy stud-\nies have revealed that overweight in adolescence is as-\nsociatedwithacceleratedcoronaryatherosclerosis,17 recent\ntrends become even more troubling.\nThe purpose of the current study is to estimate the\nprevalence and distribution of a metabolic syndrome in\nadolescents using a nationally representative sample of\nthe US population.\nMETHODS\nData from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-\nNHANES III used a complex, multistage design to provide a\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian\npopulation of the United States. Approximately 40000 per-\nsons aged 2 months to 65 years or older were studied. Young\nand old persons and ethnic minorities such as African Ameri-\ncans and Mexican Americans were oversampled.18 After being\nevaluated in a home interview to determine family medical\nhistory, current medical conditions, and medication use, par-\nticipants were randomly assigned to undergo a morning, af-\nternoon, or evening examination at the mobile examination\ncenters. Morning participants were asked to fast for 8 hours;\nafternoon and evening participants were asked to fast for 6\nhours.\nThe details of the determination and analysis of triglyc-\neride levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and glucose values have\npreviously been described.9,19 For adolescents aged 17 years\nand older, 6 seated blood pressure readings were taken in 2\nseparate settings. The household interviewer took 3 measure-\nments at the participant's home, and the study physician took\n3 during the evaluation in the center. The first and fifth Korot-\nkoff sounds were used to represent the systolic and diastolic\nvalues.18 We used the mean of these 6 measurements in these\nanalyses. Adolescents aged 12 to 16 years did not have their\nblood pressure taken at home, and thus this age group had\nonly the 3 measurements taken by the physician. Again, the\nmean was used. Height was measured in an upright position\nwith a stadiometer, and weight was measured at a standing\nposition using a self-zeroing scale (Mettler-Toledo, Inc, Co-\nlumbus, Ohio). The waist circumference measurement was\nmade at the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage and\nabove the top of the iliac crest. Measurements of waist circum-\nference were made for each subject at minimal respiration to\nthe nearest 0.1 cm.18 The Tanner stage of pubic hair develop-\nment was used as an indicator of sexual maturity because it\nwas obtained for both sexes.20 There was standardized train-\ning for physicians performing these examinations, and photo-\ngraphs and written descriptions were available for reference.\nPubic hair was staged from 1, representing immaturity, to 5,\nfor full maturity.20\n19 years, to whom the following exclusion criteria were ap-\nplied: (1) had not fasted for 6 hours, (2) was currently preg-\nnant, or (3) was taking medication classified as a blood glu-\ncose regulator, such as insulin, androgens or anabolic steroids,\nor adrenal corticosteroids. The final sample numbered 2430,\nincluding some individuals with 1 or more excluding factors.\nNo children younger than 12 years were instructed to fast as\npart of NHANES III.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe criteria for the metabolic syndrome in adults specified by\nNCEP's ATP III and the adapted definition used in this analy-\nsis for adolescents aged 12 to 19 years are shown in Table 1.7\nBecause these criteria have never been formally defined or ap-\nplied in children or adolescents, we modified the adult criteria\nto the closest representative values obtainable from pediatric\nreference data. In developing a definition for metabolic syn-\ndrome in adolescents,21 we considered reference values from\nthe NCEP Pediatric Panel report,22 the American Diabetes As-\nsociation statement on type 2 diabetes in children and adoles-\ncents,23 and the updated Task Force report on the diagnosis\nand management of hypertension in childhood as well as ATP\nIII.8 Because no reference values for waist circumference exist\nfor adolescents or children, we analyzed all adolescents in the\ndata set who had a waist circumference recorded. We classi-\nfied participants with a waist circumference at or above the\n90th percentile value for age and sex from this sample popu-\nlation as having abdominal obesity. Elevated systolic or dias-\ntolic blood pressure was defined as a value at or above the\n90th percentile for age, sex, and height.21 If subjects reported\ncurrent use of any antihypertensive drugs, they were labeled\nas participants with elevated blood pressure. This approach of\ncounting participants taking medications was also used for\nexamining the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in adults\nTable 1.

Therefore the midpoint value for HDL choles-\ncentile value, and the midpoint value for triglycerides (110\nmg/dL [1.24 mmol/L]) was taken as the 90th percentile\nvalue for age.

Comparisons of means of continuous variables were done\nwith the t test. Children identified in the racial/ethnic cat-\negory \"other\" were included in the overall sample analyzed, but\nthis subsample was too small for meaningful analysis sepa-\nrately. To account for the complex sampling design, SAS24 and\nSUDAAN25 statistical software were used in the analysis, and\nSUDAAN was used to apply sampling weights to produce na-\ntional estimates.\nRESULTS\nDemographic characteristics associated with the meta-\nbolic syndrome in bivariate analyses are shown in\nTable 2. The overall prevalence of the metabolic syn-\ndrome in adolescents was 4.2%. It was more common in\nmales (6.1%) than in females (2.1%) and was more fre-\nquent in Mexican Americans (5.6%) and whites (4.8%)\nthan black subjects (2.0%). By region of the country,\nthe rate was highest in the West and Midwest and low-\nest in the Northeast.

The proportion of subjects with\n1 or more abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome is\npresented in Table 3. In this sample, 41% of subjects\nhad 1 or more of these risk factors, whereas 14% had 2\nor more. There were no subjects who had all 5 of these\nrisk factors.\nThe prevalence of the metabolic syndrome by sex\nand race/ethnicity is shown in the Figure. The preva-\nlence among white (7.1%) and Mexican American\nmales (7%) was nearly the same, whereas black males\nhad the lowest rate at 2.6% (P=.003). Among females,\nMexican Americans (4.1%) had the highest rate,\nwhereas black females (1.4%) had the lowest rate\nThe distribution of each element of the metabolic\nsyndrome is shown in Table 4. Overall, high triglycer-\nide levels and low HDL cholesterol levels were most com-\nmon, whereas high fasting glucose levels were the least\ncommon. White adolescents had the highest rates of high\ntriglyceride levels (25.5%) and low HDL cholesterol lev-\nels (26.1%). Mexican American subjects had the high-\nest rate of abdominal obesity by waist circumference\n(13.0%). Black adolescents had the highest proportion\nof elevated blood pressure (6.2%).

The World Health Organization used \"meta-\nbolic syndrome\" in their 1998 report on diagnosis and\nclassification of diabetes mellitus.27 Both the World Health\nOrganization and ATP III chose this title for their con-\nsensus definitions.7,27 We believe that this is the first study\nto examine the prevalence and distribution of a meta-\nbolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of\nUS adolescents. Perhaps 4% of adolescents overall and\nnearly 30% of overweight adolescents meet the criteria\nfor this syndrome, suggesting that almost 1 million ado-\nlescents in the United States are affected.\nThe metabolic syndrome affects an estimated 47 mil-\nlion American adults.9 The syndrome emerges when a\nperson's predisposition for insulin resistance is wors-\nened by increasing adiposity; dyslipidemia, elevated blood\npressure, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic prop-\nerties result.28 Adults with this syndrome frequently\nprogress to type 2 diabetes and demonstrate markedly\nincreased risk for morbidity and mortality from cardio-\nvascular disease.29-31 The metabolic syndrome in adults\nis largely confined to the overweight population32 and rep-\nresents a subgroup of obese persons who bear a level of\nrisk for cardiovascular disease that exceeds that of the\nobese in general. An estimated 7% of men and 6% of\nwomen aged 20 to 29 years are affected with the meta-\nbolic syndrome,9 so our finding that 4% of those aged\n12 to 19 years may have this syndrome should not be sur-\nprising. Four previous regional studies of children that\nrelied on US and international samples demonstrated the\nclustering of the risk factors for the metabolic syn-\nOverweight has important implications for the fu-\nture health of our young people, especially in terms of\ncoronary heart disease and diabetes. The Pathobiologi-\ncal Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth research\ngroup, for example, found that overweight (by BMI) in\nyoung men was associated with fatty streaks, raised le-\nsions, and low-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries.17\nIn addition, studies have established that child and ado-\nlescent obesity tracks into adulthood and also predicts\nthe metabolic syndrome in adults.37-39 Results of one of\nthe many reports from the Bogalusa Heart Study40 show\nthat when insulin concentrations are increased in child-\nhood they tend to remain elevated in adulthood, and those\nadults with consistently elevated insulin levels tend also\nto have increased rates of obesity, hypertension, and dys-\nlipidemia. In the present study, adolescents with the meta-\nbolic syndrome had a mean BMI just above the 95th per-\ncentile; thus, they represent a fairly common clinical\nproblem, one likely to be encountered routinely by gen-\neral pediatricians.\nAbdominal or centrally distributed fat is associated\nwith type 2 diabetes and a poor cardiovascular profile in\nadults.41-45 In children, an increased waist circumfer-\nence has been shown to correlate with abnormal sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressures and elevated serum\nlevels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein,\ntriglyceride, lipoprotein, and insulin, as well as lower\nthe clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and waist cir-\ncumference is not only a reflection of the degree of obe-\nTable 3.

In fact, BMI is a\nless sensitive indicator of fatness in children and fails to\naccount for fat distribution.51 Perhaps for these reasons,\nan American Heart Association statement has recom-\nmended the inclusion of waist circumference measure-\nments in evaluating children for insulin resistance or those\nwho manifest features resulting from insulin resistance\nthat constitute much of the metabolic syndrome.49\nGiven the growing concern about metabolic syn-\ndrome, coupled with the alarming increase in the preva-\nlence of overweight in children and adults, it is not sur-\nprisingthattheAmericanHeartAssociationsetforthaseries\nof guidelines for promoting cardiovascular health as part\nof comprehensive pediatric care.49,52,53 Evidence shows that\nobesity and insulin resistance has already started \"the clock\nof coronary heart disease\" in some adults, even before the\nonsetofdiabetes.29 Wecannotdefinitelystatethatthiswould\nbe the case for overweight adolescents with the metabolic\nsyndrome according to our definition, but this seems likely\nfor many because the syndrome is a constellation of car-\ndiovascularriskfactors.Cluster-trackingstudieshaveshown\nthat multiple cardiovascular risk factors persist from child-\nshowedthatsubjectswhoeitherdevelopedorlosttheirrisk\nfactor clustering over time had significant changes in their\nadiposity and lifestyle behaviors related to nutrition and\nphysical activity.55\nThe first limitation of the data we present is to con-\nsider how to define the metabolic syndrome for pediatric\npatients. The intent was to create a definition for meta-\nbolic syndrome in adolescents for initial epidemiologic in-\nvestigation and for possible future clinical consideration.\nThe concept was to identify borderline high (or border-\nline low in the case of HDL) values for each criterion from\nestablishedguidelinesforchildrenandadolescents.Insome\ninstances, as with BMI, age- and sex-specific criteria are\nrecommended to identify abnormal patients.56,57 In con-\ntrast, in the case of glucose and serum cholesterol, screen-\ning guidelines give single specific cutoff values for iden-\nabnormal cholesterol values in adolescent subjects may\nseem higher than expected, 30% of adults from the same\ndata set had hypertriglyceridemia and 37% had a low HDL\ncholesterol value according to the ATP III criteria for the\nmetabolic syndrome.9 There might also be concern that\nthe cholesterol cutoff values used might lead to some over-\nestimation or underestimation, but there was no differ-\nence in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome between 12-\nagers were stratified by Tanner stage, there was also no\nstatistical difference in the rates of this syndrome pheno-\ntype, but rates increased among Tanner 2 and Tanner 3\nindividuals and decreased among Tanner 4 and 5 sub-\njects. Although no national definition of the metabolic syn-\ndrome in adolescents currently exists, obesity treatment\nguidelinesrecommendidentifyingyouthwithmedicalcom-\nplications of their obesity.56,57 Even recent scientific state-\nments on cardiovascular disease prevention or obesity and\ninsulin resistance in children have not presented a defi-\nnition of metabolic syndrome for research or clinical\nSome other limitations to consider include the\ncross-sectional nature of these data, which do not allow\ncausal inferences and limit any assumptions about the\nduration of the existence of any of the criteria, such as\nblood pressure or cholesterol level. Also, since NHANES\nIII was conducted, both obesity and type 2 diabetes have\nbecome more common among adolescents,13,60 which may\nmean that this clustering of risk factors may have a higher\nprevalence now than it did during data collection. De-\nspite subjects 12 years and older being instructed to fast,\njust more than 700 subjects from the original sample had\nto be eliminated for not fasting for at least 6 hours. Al-\nthough 6 hours of fasting may not be ideal, it allowed\na larger sample size to be analyzed by having subjects\nfrom afternoon and evening examinations included.\nTable 4.

All rights reserved.\nFinally, it should be noted that owing to the low preva-\nlence of the metabolic syndrome, some cell sizes were\nsmall when stratified by demographic characteristics. Mul-\ntiple prospective reports confirm that the clustering\nof risk factors for the metabolic syndrome are develop-\nbolic syndrome in adults show that its prevalence in-\ncreases with age.9\nOur findings highlight a high percentage of over-\nweight adolescents who may bear a heightened risk for\nfuture metabolic syndrome in adulthood with subse-\nquent increased risks for premature cardiovascular dis-\nease and type 2 diabetes. Consistent with recent com-\nmentaries that have called for better ways to define\noverweight in children,62 use of a consensus definition\nfor the metabolic syndrome to assess overweight adoles-\ncents might be a useful strategy to target a group at in-\ncreased risk. Targeting adults with glucose intolerance\nand other markers of the metabolic syndrome has been\nemployed in trials to prevent type 2 diabetes in adults.63-65\nThe high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in over-\nweight adolescents, however, emphasizes the need for ef-\nfective preventive and therapeutic strategies that rely on\ndiet, exercise, and lifestyle modification rather than medi-\ncations. Otherwise, the financial burden imposed by obe-\nsity may be matched by the costs of treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates that a metabolic syndrome phe-\nnotype may exist in perhaps 4% of the US adolescent popu-\nlation and almost 30% of overweight adolescents. Of those\nadolescents with metabolic syndrome, the great majority\nwere overweight. This syndrome may affect almost 1 mil-\nlionadolescentsintheUnitedStates.Theimpactofthemeta-\nbolicsyndromeinadolescentsonsubsequentmorbidityand\nmortality has not, however, been explored, nor has the po-\ntential to reduce these risks by weight loss, increased ac-\ntivity, or pharmacological alteration of associated meta-\nbolic derangements. Nonetheless, these data indicate that\na substantial percentage of US adolescents may be at sig-\nnificantly heightened risk for the metabolic syndrome in\nadulthood and the subsequent risks for type 2 diabetes\nandprematurecoronaryarterydisease.Perhapstheyshould\nbe considered candidates for aggressive therapeutic inter-\nventions to maintain healthy lifestyle into and through-\nout adulthood.\nThisstudywassupportedbyFacultyDevelopmentinPri-\nand Services Administration, Rockville, Md (Dr Cook).\nCorresponding author and reprints: Stephen Cook, MD,\nUniversity of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, De-\nester,NY14642(e-mail:stephen_cook@urmc.rochester.edu).\nREFERENCES\n1.

Re-\ncently, the metabolic syndrome has been shown to affect\nmore than 20% of the age-adjusted adult population and\nis closely related to the obesity epidemic. It is a cluster-\ning of metabolic derangements that reflect or portend in-\nsulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and premature cardio-\nvascular disease. To date, there has been no estimate of\nthe potential disease burden for children or adoles-\ncents.\nThis study suggests that the phenotype of the meta-\nbolic syndrome may affect 4% of adolescents in the United\nStates, with nearly 80% of adolescents who meet the cri-\nteria employed for the metabolic syndrome being over-\nweight. Almost 30% of the overweight youth in this\nsample have 3 or more of the risk factors for the meta-\nbolic syndrome, thus qualifying under the criteria em-\nployed. Because metabolic syndrome significantly in-\ncreases the risk of type 2 diabetes and premature coronary\nartery disease in adults, adolescent subjects who con-\ntinue to manifest this risk factor profile may constitute\na subgroup of overweight teenagers to target for life-\nstyle behavior changes.\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.
