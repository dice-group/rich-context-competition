    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe attempt to elucidate whether there might be a causal connection between the socioeconomic status (SES) of the rearing\nenvironment and obesity in the offspring using data from two large-scale adoption studies: (1) The Copenhagen Adoption\nStudy of Obesity (CASO), and (2) The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families (HOLT). In CASO, the SES of both biological\nand adoptive parents was known, but all children were adopted. In HOLT, only the SES of the rearing parents was known,\nbut the children could be either biological or adopted. After controlling for relevant covariates (e.g., adoptee age at\nmeasurement, adoptee age at transfer, adoptee sex) the raw (unstandardized) regression coefficients for adoptive and\nbiological paternal SES on adoptee body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) in CASO were -.22 and -.23, respectively, both statistically\nsignificant (p = 0.01). Controlling for parental BMI (both adoptive and biological) reduced the coefficient for biological\npaternal SES by 44% (p = .034) and the coefficient for adoptive paternal SES by 1%. For HOLT, the regression coefficients for\nrearing parent SES were -.42 and -.25 for biological and adoptive children, respectively. Controlling for the average BMI of\nthe rearing father and mother (i.e., mid-parental BMI) reduced the SES coefficient by 47% in their biological offspring\n(p#.0001), and by 12% in their adoptive offspring (p = .09). Thus, despite the differing structures of the two adoption\nstudies, both suggest that shared genetic diathesis and direct environmental transmission contribute about equally to the\nassociation between rearing SES and offspring BMI.\nCitation: Fontaine KR, Robertson HT, Holst C, Desmond R, Stunkard AJ, et al.

Research is needed to further understand the\nimpact of socioeconomic status on the development of obesity.''\nThe inverse association observed in developed societies between\nobesity and indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), such as\noccupational status, income, and education has been well\nestablished [1\u00ad4] for nearly a half century [5,6]. However, the\nnature and magnitude of the causal connection implied by the\nword ``impact'' in the quotation above is less clear.\nThere are multiple plausible causal relations underlying the\nSES-obesity association [7]. These include the hypotheses that:\n(a) lower SES causes an increased likelihood of development of\nobesity [8,9]; (b) obesity causes a decline in SES through factors\nsuch as cognitive and educational difficulties [10\u00ad12] downward\nmarriage, lost earnings due to sickness, or employment and wage\ndiscrimination [13]; and (c) obesity and low SES share some\ncommon genetic or environmental causes. Because both obesity\ncontrol, both pleiotropic effects and correlated genetic effects\nmay be considered, the latter possibly due to assortative mating\nof wealthy and thin people [20]. Thus, because obesity is\ngenetically influenced and may lead to low SES, the observed\nassociation between low SES in the rearing environment and the\ndevelopment of obesity in the offspring may be only an\nepiphenomenon due to genetic transmission of the predisposition\nAlthough these hypotheses are neither mutually exclusive nor\nexhaustive, it is important to distinguish between hypothesis (a)\nand the others. That is, if it is true that low SES increases the\nlikelihood of obesity through a direct causal effect then efforts to\nidentify and subsequently modify the causative aspects of a low\nSES rearing environment would be justified. Alternatively, if the\nassociation is due to obesity causing a decline in SES then policies\ndesigned only to modify SES may not be effective.\nVoluntary adoptions, in which young children are randomly\nassigned to rearing environments differing in SES, can be thought\nof as `natural experiments' that can be used to estimate whether\nthere are potential causal effects of the SES of the rearing\nenvironment on subsequent obesity. A Danish adoption study\nthat implemented this notion found that the parental SES of both\nbiological and adoptive parents was inversely associated with\nBMI in the adult offspring [21]. Previous analyses of these\nadoption data showed that the BMI of the adoptees was\nassociated with the BMI of the biological parents, but not of\nthe adoptive parents [14]. Under the general assumptions of\ntypical adoption studies, if a trait in the offspring is correlated\nwith a trait in their biological parents who did not raise them, the\ncause of that correlation is generally presumed to be genetic. In\ncontrast, when a trait in the offspring is correlated with a trait in\nthe adoptive, biologically unrelated, parent who raised them, that\ncorrelation is generally presumed to be due to environmental\nfactors. Herein we searched the literature for relevant adoption\ndatasets and combined analyses of parental BMI and SES data to\nevaluate the extent to which associations between SES of the\nrearing environment and offspring obesity are consistent with the\nnotion that, besides any common genetic effects, SES causally\ncontributes to obesity.\nSpecifically, if the SES of the rearing parents does causally\naffect the child's BMI and there were no other ways of generating\nthis association, then a correlation should exist between the\nrearing parents' SES and the BMI of the children they raise,\nindependent of biological parental BMI. Moreover, the magni-\ntude of correlation should be the same whether the child is a\nbiological or adopted offspring. In contrast, if the correlation\nis partly or fully due to a shared genetic diathesis between\nSES and BMI, then (i) the correlation between the rearing\nparents' SES and the child's BMI should be smaller for the\nadopted offspring than for the biological offspring, (ii) a\ncorrelation should exist between the SES of the biological\nparents and the BMI of the adopted-away offspring, and (iii) the\ncorrelation between parental SES and biological offspring BMI\nshould be reduced in absolute value when parental BMI is\ncontrolled (see Appendix S1 which further elucidates a model\nunderlying these expectations).\nIn summary, our primary goal was to investigate whether the\nassociation between rearing parent SES and adoptee BMI was\nstatistically significant, and whether it remained so even after\ncontrolling for rearing parents BMI. We then sought to\ndisentangle the respective contributions of environmental and\nbiological components of the association of SES of the rearing\nenvironment and obesity in the offspring (Figure 1).\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThis study was declared non-human subject's research by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at\nBirmingham.\nInclusion Criteria and Dataset Search Procedures\nWe define a family unit to be a collection of any analyzable\ncombination of adopted offspring, biological offspring of parents in\nrearing household, adoptive/rearing parents, and biological\nparents as defined in the text. We used data from adoption\nstudies that met the following criteria: (1) the study provides\ninformation on the weight, height, and/or BMI (measured or self-\nreported) of persons raised in adoptive families (adoptees); (2) the\nstudy provides information on the weight, height, and/or BMI\n(measured or self-reported) of either adoptive siblings (defined here\nas the biological offspring of the adoptive parents) or both the\nadoptive rearing parents and the biological parents of the\nadoptees; (3) the study provides information on the SES of the\nrearing environment (variables such as income, occupational\nprestige, and education); (4) the data is publicly available or readily\nobtainable; and (5) if data were available on the biological\noffspring of the adoptive parents, the regression of the adoptee\nBMI on their parents' SES indicators had to be negative in sign\nand statistically significant. The reason for including criterion #5\nis because we did not wish to assess whether the SES-obesity\nassociation is present in every available dataset (the association\ndoes not necessarily exist in all populations [3,4,22]). Rather, we\nwished to study samples where such an association existed in order\nto investigate whether we could disentangle the various contribu-\ntions of environmental and biological components to the\nassociation. In Appendix S1, we describe simulation studies which\nshow that criterion #5 is unlikely to have induced any non-trivial\nbias.\nTo obtain data from adoption studies that met the aforemen-\ntioned criteria, we searched the following electronic sources: Inter-\nUniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (http://\nwww.icpsr.umich.edu); the National Center for Health Statistics\nFigure 1. Differences in two study designs.\nSocioeconomic Status and Obesity\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/express.htm); the Economic and So-\ncial Data Service, United Kingdom (http://www.esds.ac.uk/\naccess/access.asp); the UK Data Archive (http://www.data-\narchive.ac.uk/); the Henry A. Murray Research Archive (http://\nwww.murray.harvard.edu/); and the National Library of Medi-\ncine's Medline and pre-Medline dataset (http://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov). We also contacted colleagues to ask if they were aware of\nany adoption studies that might meet our inclusion criteria.\nOur search yielded eight datasets, two of which (The Survey of\nHolt Adoptees and Their Families, 2005 [HOLT] and The\nCopenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity [CASO]) met our\ninclusion criteria. The 6 other datasets (the National Health\nInterview Survey, 1987 Adoption Supplement; the National Child\nDevelopment Study, UK; the Colorado Adoption Project; the\nIowa Adoption Project; the Family Life Project; and the Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics (PSID) Childbirth and Adoption\nHistory) did not meet all criteria (i.e., did not contain weight/\nheight or BMI information on adoptive siblings or the adoptive\nrearing parents and the biological parents of the adoptees).\nOverview of Datasets Used\nThe two datasets used, the Copenhagen Study of Obesity\n(CASO) and the Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families\n(HOLT), are described below and in Tables 1 and 2. For both\ndatasets, there was no minimum SES level required to adopt a\nchild.\nThe Copenhagen Study of Obesity (CASO). Based on the\nDanish Adoption Register, the CASO [15] consists of non-familial\nAround 1980, height, weight, and highest weight ever were\nthe basis of their BMI as probands representing the extremes and\nthe central part of the distribution. The biological and adoptive\nfamilies of the proband adoptees were identified, and their weight\nand height were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Parent reports\nof height and weight were used if available. If data from parents\nwere unavailable, due to death or some other circumstance, the\ninformation was obtained from the offspring (i.e., adoptive\noffspring for adoptive parents and biological offspring for\nbiological parents). Three-hundred and ninety (36%) of the\nadoptive offspring provided adoptive parental data, while 208\nbiological offspring (19.2%) provided biological parental data.\nThis potentially introduces uncertainty and hence dilution of the\ncorrelations, but hopefully no systematic bias [23]. Information\nabout the occupation of the biological and adoptive fathers was\navailable in the original adoption records for granting the\nadoption. The occupation was converted to a prestige-based\nSES score, developed in the late 1950s by Kaare Svalastoga, from\n3,000 Danish occupations that were rated on a validated 8-point\nscale, ranging from 0 (unskilled worker) to 7 (advanced\nprofessional positions) [17\u00ad19]. The prestige of a given\noccupation associates moderately well with variables such as\nincome and educational attainment [17]. Only paternal (both\nadoptive and biological) SES was used because in that time period\nin Denmark, far fewer women, especially of the age considered,\nthan men would have had occupations that characterized the\nhousehold's SES. The range and variability of SES is considered a\nreasonable representation of the general Danish population at the\ntime the data were collected [17]. The distribution of SES values\nof the adoptive fathers was as follows: unskilled worker (14.5%),\nsemiskilled worker (10.4%), skilled worker (26.5%), subordinate\nclerk (14.4%), skilled worker with own business (20.9%), sub-\nacademic professions (8.5%), academic positions (4.5%), and\nadvanced professional positions (0.3%). Though not definitive, it is\npossible that adoptive fathers in CASO may have a higher mean\nSES than the general population while adoptees have a mean SES\nthat is comparable to the general population [17,18]. Age at\ntransfer of the adoptee to the adoptive family was also available in\nthe original records. Thus, the BMI and SES of both the biological\nand rearing parents were fitted as predictor variables; this adjusted\nfor any shared genetic diathesis between BMI and SES.\nThe Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families\n(HOLT). The study focused on families who adopted a\nKorean-American child through Holt International Children's\nassigned to families in infancy using a queuing policy (i.e., on a first\ncome, first served basis). The agency conducted a follow-up\nsurvey, HOLT, for family members when the adoptees had grown\ninto adulthood [24]. The HOLT was conducted from January\neducational attainment, and socioeconomic status of adult\nKorean-American adoptees and their adoptive families. Adoptive\nparents and a small subset of adult adoptees were surveyed, and\neach case represented an adopted or non-adopted child in the\nfamily. Adoptive parents provided their age, sex, marital status,\noccupation, education level, household income, height, weight,\ntobacco and alcohol usage, and the number of children they had.\nAdoptive parents also provided similar information on their\nTable 1.

Fifty-eight percent of families\nadoptive mothers had 16 or more years of education; and 64.2%\nof fathers had 16 or more years of education. The overall survey\nresponse rate was 27%.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe opted to use traditional regression modeling, as opposed to\nstructural equation modeling, for the following reasons: (1) ease of\nimplementation, (2) ease of communication, and (3) robustness.\nRegarding robustness, structural equation modeling is more\nsensitive to violations in assumptions or normality than ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) regression. Moreover, OLS regression also\nafforded us the opportunity to perform sensitivity analyses and\ndiagnostics (i.e., bootstrapping, residuals analyses) to examine\nrobustness. In each dataset, missing data were handled by multiple\nimputation [25] as described in Appendix S1.\nThe Copenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity (CASO).\nThe dependent variable modeled was adoptee BMI. Residuals\nfrom models with adoptee BMI as the dependent variable were not\nnormally distributed. Hence, adoptee BMI data were normalized by\na log transformation and then re-scaled to have the same mean and\nvariance as the original data. Covariates included adoptee age at\nmeasurement, adoptee age at transfer, adoptee sex, and age of all\nparents (adoptive and biological) at the time of the adoptee's birth.\nThe primary independent variables were adoptive and biological\npaternal SES. The difference between the regression coefficients for\nadoptive versus biological paternal SES were tested as described by\nNeter et al. [26]. Investigating this difference allows us to assess\nwhether there is a possible causal effect of the SES of the rearing\nenvironment. Specifically, if the magnitude of the regression\ncoefficients for the biological and the adoptive father's SES are\nsimilar and not significant, it would suggest that the genetic\ninfluence on BMI and its influence on SES of the rearing\nenvironment each accounted for roughly half the correlation\nbetween rearing environment SES and BMI. This was\naccomplished by using a simple linear reparametrization of the\nmodel such that one of the original two predictor variables (adoptive\nand biological paternal SES) are replaced in the model by their sum\nand the other variable is retained in its original form. Under this\nparameterization, the test of whether the raw (unstandardized)\nregression coefficient for the variable retained in its original form is\nnot zero is arithmetically identical to a test of the equality of the\nregression coefficients for the two original predictor variables.\nChanges in parameter estimates when additional variables were\nincluded in the models were tested as described by Clogg et al. [27].\nClogg et al showed that in linear regression analysis, if a regression\ncoefficient for a predictor (X1\n) is not zero in a univariate model with\nY as a response variable and if X1\nis also significantly correlated with\nanother variable, X2\n, then if the coefficient for X2\nis significant when\nadded into a regression model also containing X1\n, this is equivalent\nto showing that the coefficient for X1\nchanged significantly with the\ninclusion of X2\nin the model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted via\nbootstrap to ensure that any departure from normality due to the\nextreme sampling plan used by CASO (see above) did not lead to\nbiased inference.\nThe Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families\n(HOLT). Because data on multiple children from the same\nfamily were available, a linear mixed model (LMM) with\ncorrelated residuals in a compound symmetric structure was\nused to account for within-family effects. HOLT included 2,886\nchildren from 1,207 families. The predictor variables for HOLT\nincluded the child's age and gender, the adoptive family's SES, the\nadoptive mother's BMI, and the adoptive father's BMI. The\nchild's BMI was regressed on these variables. The adoptive\nfamily's SES was computed through Principal Components\nAnalysis (PCA). The PCA incorporated the mother's education\n(highest completed grade), the father's education (highest\ncompleted grade), and household income. Z-scores from the\nstandardized first principal component were used as predictors.\nResults\nThe Copenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity (CASO)\nIn the regression of adoptee BMI on biological and adoptive\npaternal SES, after controlling for covariates (i.e., adoptee age at\nmeasurement, adoptee age at transfer, adoptee sex, and age of all\nparents (adoptive and biological) at the time of the adoptee's birth),\nTable 2.

In the population overall, the prevalence of obesity was roughly 4% at the time the data were collected [14].\nSocioeconomic Status and Obesity\nthe joint regression coefficient of adoptive and biological paternal\nSES (that is the value if the regression coefficient estimated for\nboth adoptive and biological parents' SES is constrained to be\nequal) was statistically significant (p = 0.011). The difference\nbetween the regression coefficients for the biological and the\nadoptive father's SES was not significant (p = 0.982) and the two\ncoefficients were very similar (-.22 and -.23, respectively). This\nsupports the notion of a possible causal effect of the SES of the\nrearing environment in that the correlation between the genetic\ninfluence on BMI and its influence on SES each accounted for\nroughly half the correlation between rearing environment SES\nand BMI (see Appendix S1 for an elaboration of the model\nunderlying this conclusion).\nControlling for parental BMI (both adoptive and biological)\nreduced the coefficient for biological paternal SES by roughly half\n(reduced by 44% in absolute value). Given that biological parent\nBMI is significantly correlated with both parental SES and with\nadoptee BMI, this reduction was statistically significant (p = 0.034;\ncf. 25). In contrast, controlling for parental BMI (both adoptive\nand biological) hardly changed the coefficient for adoptive\npaternal SES at all (reduced by 0.7% in absolute value). This is\nconsistent with the idea that controlling for biological parental\nBMI controls for the correlated genetic diathesis, but not for any\ncausal effect from SES (See Figure 2, panels A & B).\nThe Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families (HOLT)\nThe rearing parents' BMI was positively associated with the\nBMI of biological children, but not with adopted children, which is\nconsistent with a genetic influence on BMI [12]. In the regression\nof biological offspring BMI on rearing parental SES (i.e., the SES\nof their biological parents who reared them), the regression\ncoefficient was -.42 (p = .0004). By comparison, in the regression of\nadopted offspring BMI on rearing parental SES, the regression\ncoefficient was smaller in absolute value (-.25), but also statistically\nsignificant (p = .0096). To assess the difference in association for\nbiological and adopted children, we conducted tests that\ncontrasted coefficients within models by following the general\napproach described by Neter et al [26] and also with conventional\ninteraction terms as applicable. The difference between the slopes\nof the regressions of offspring BMI on rearing parent SES was not\nsignificant (p = .22), but a test of whether the coefficient for\nadopted offspring was different than half the value of the\ncoefficient for biological offspring (as would be predicted from\nthe CASO results) was also not significant with a much larger p-\nvalue (p = .75). This suggests that SES and a correlation between\nthe genetic influences on BMI and the genetic influences on SES\neach accounted for roughly half of the correlation between rearing\nenvironment SES and BMI.\nAmong biological offspring, when mid-parental BMI (the average\nof mother and father BMI) was added to the model, the absolute\nadjusting for mid-parental BMI; p,.0001 for the reduction in\nvalue). In contrast, for the adopted offspring, when the mid-parental\nBMI of rearing parents was added to the model, the coefficient was\nvirtually unchanged, from -.25 to -.22 (p = .09 for the change), and\nremained statistically significant (p = 0.02). In other words, the effect\nFigure 2. Effect of SES on biological and adopted children in the CASO and HOLT studies.\nSocioeconomic Status and Obesity\nof SES was reduced in the presence of mid-parental BMI for\nbiological children but was not significantly reduced for adopted\nchildren. After adjusting for mid-parental BMI, the apparent effect\nof rearing-parent SES was essentially the same in biological and\nadopted children (see Figure 2, panels C & D).\nDiscussion\nOur results, from two well-characterized adoption datasets, are\nconsistent with a model in which both the rearing parents' SES\nand the genetic influence on BMI and its relation to SES\ncontribute equally to the association between rearing parents' SES\nand the adiposity of their offspring.\nBeyond the aforementioned publication examining the CASO\nstudy, we know of no other studies which have taken the approach\nwe have to consider adoption as a form of `natural randomization'\nto better assess the extent to which the SES association with\nobesity represents an effect of SES causing obesity. However, there\nis an existing literature discussing multiple alternative causal\nhypotheses and the fact that the nature and direction of causation\nis not known [16,28]. Despite this, it is generally taken for granted\nthat the SES obesity relationship represents causation from SES to\nobesity. For example, after analyzing an ordinary observational\nepidemiological study [29], one author wrote ``There appears to\nbe a protective effect of higher SES on the weight status of children\nand adolescents and it is likely that a wide range of socio-cultural\nfactors influence the risk of obesity, including typical social\ndeterminants of health such as income, education, access to\nnutritious food, access to and affordability of sporting facilities,\nhealth literacy, outdoor environment, and cultural norms of\neating, exercising and ideal weight. As such, the prevention of\nchildhood obesity is most likely to succeed if these sociocultural\ndeterminants are addressed in interventions targeting schools,\ncommunities and other areas of social and economic disadvan-\ntage.'' In addition, components embedded within the environ-\nment, factors such as crime, financial hardship, violence, and\nparental neglect may also influence the SES-obesity association.\nBefore we make definitive causal statements, however, we need to\nbetter assess these potential underlying causal mechanisms\n(something that cannot be easily accomplished). Our approach\nto using adoption data is one method of doing so. Another may be\nthe use of studies randomizing persons to receive additional\nthough we are unaware of any which specifically assessed effects\non weight, BMI, or obesity (except for birth weight). Ironically,\neven in present time people are randomized to have more or less\nmoney every day by casinos and lotteries and acquiring data on\npersons who participate may be natural ways to further attempt to\nassess causation. There is also importance in assessing fundamen-\ntal mechanisms of causation. This includes the mechanisms by\nwhich obesity may lead to lower SES, the common genetic\nunderpinnings, and the mechanisms by which SES may cause\nobesity.\nWith respect to obesity potentially leading to lower SES, obesity\nappears to reduce wages given equal qualifications [31], reduce the\nlikelihood of being hired even given equal qualifications [32],\nreduce the probability of attending college even given equal\nqualifications [33], predispose toward marrying men of lower SES\namong women [34], and may impair cognitive functioning and\nhealth over many years leading to reduced earning capacity [35].\nWith respect to the potential effects of SES on obesity, common\nthinking is that the economic aspects per se (e.g., the relative costs\nof various foods) are driving factors [36]. However, we hypothesize\nthat the `socio' as much or more than the `economic' in\nsocioeconomic status may cause the connection to obesity. That\nis, the self-perception of being low in a social hierarchy, apart from\nany specific economic factors, may lead to physiologic, cognitive,\nand behavioral changes that ultimately result in the anatomical\nchanges we call obesity. As evidence of this, consider that\nsubordinate status birds across many species (willow tit, great tit,\ngreenfinch, chickadees, titmouse, nuthatch) carry greater fat\nreserves than dominant status birds [37,38], subordinate status\nrats are hyperphagic and gain more fat mass when removed from\ndominant status rats, subordinate hamsters and monkeys consume\nmore and increase body weight during hierarchical interactions\n[39\u00ad41] and in humans, lower subjective social status appears to\nbe associated with higher waist to hip ratio and BMI levels to a\ngreater degree than are objective economic indicators [42].\nFinally, with respect to ideas about common mechanisms\nunderlying SES and obesity, consider the work of Chib et al.\n[43] who found reciprocal relations between ``...the incentive\nvalue of food and of money'' in several experiments in which the\nhunger levels of human subjects were manipulated suggesting\nconnections between the biological mechanisms of drives for\nmoney and food as has also been indicated in fMRI research.\nOur study has several strengths. First, the study made new use of\nadoption data to address a set of important questions that could\nnot be ethically investigated via a randomized experimental trial\n(c.f., [44]). Second, we used data from two large, well-\ncharacterized datasets related to voluntary adoption. In both\npopulations, it appears reasonable to assume that the SES of the\nrearing environment was independent of the genetic predisposition\nto adiposity. Third, we used thorough statistical analyses\npermitting us to tease out the associations of interest while\ncontrolling for covariates and other sources of potential bias.\nFourth, despite differences in the time the data were collected, the\ncountry of origin, and the race/ethnicity of the samples, the results\nwere remarkably consistent. This consistency suggests that the\nfindings are durable and supports the validity of the causal\ninferences we made from the observed associations.\nThe limitations of this study include: the datasets relied upon\nself-reported height and weight as opposed to direct measure-\nments, and moreover, some of the parental weight and height data\nwere derived by proxy self-report by the children; the age at which\nadoptee BMI was assessed was quite different in the two studies;\nthe two populations studied had relatively low rates of obesity;\ncertain biases may have been introduced by the use of mail\nquestionnaires; the adoptees in the CASO study did not come\nfrom abroad, raising the possibility that some adoptees were, in\nfact, familial adoptions (however, while we cannot eliminate this\npossibility entirely, the Danish Adoption Register sought to filter\nout all adoptions where there was some relationship between the\nchild and the adoptive parents); and we did not investigate the role\nadditional variables such as neighborhood factors (e.g., stress,\ncrime, violence) might have had upon the results.\nGiven these limitations, despite the fact that the two study\npopulations we analyzed samples from were quite different (e.g.,\nHOLT study parents were better educated, offspring BMI was\nmeasured in the CASO study many years after they left their\nrearing environment), it should be examined whether our finding\nholds in other groups and time periods because the relation\nbetween SES and obesity does not appear to be constant across\npopulations or within populations across time [3,4]. Hence,\nreassessing with more recent data may be valuable, especially if\nobesity is more prevalent, although the shorter the follow-up, the\nmore limited the ability to study long-term effects.\nIn comparison with the previous analyses conducted with\nCASO [21], the present study adds important evidence elucidating\nSocioeconomic Status and Obesity\nthe nature of the association between SES and adiposity. First and\nforemost, the inverse correlation between adoptive parental SES\nand offspring BMI was confirmed in independent and in very\ndifferent study populations. Second, the present study demon-\nstrated that this correlation was essentially independent of the BMI\nof the adoptive parents, which was only indirectly inferred in the\nprevious study. Third, the present study provided consistent\nestimates of the contribution of the established genetic parent-\noffspring correlation in BMI to the observed inverse correlation\nbetween parental SES and offspring BMI in natural families in\nwhich the biological parents rear their own biological offspring.\nThe finding that the association between the SES of the rearing\nenvironment and offspring adiposity has a component that is\nindependent of the BMI of the rearing parents strongly suggests\nthat the mechanism is not to be found in the frame of what is\nconsidered `cultural transmission' of obesogenic factors in the\nfamily environment. It is possible that the SES or related\npsychosocial factors (e.g., cognition and educational proficiency)\nof the offspring are mediating the effects of parental SES by being\nrelated to both the SES of the rearing parents and the subsequent\nformer analyses of CASO, the inclusion of the SES of the adoptees\nin the analysis only partly reduced the correlation between\nparental SES and adoptee BMI [21]. Assessment of the association\nbetween SES of the rearing environment and BMI of the adoptees\nin childhood, when the parent-offspring correlations in BMI are\nestablished [16], would allow estimation of influences that are not\ndriven by the SES of the adoptees themselves. The SES of the\nrearing environment may also be a proxy for more specific\nenvironmental or psychosocial factors that contribute to adiposity\nsuch as those that under extreme conditions may make parental\nneglect of their offspring a very strong predictor of later\ndevelopment of obesity [45]. Future research should seek to\nidentify those factors that are causal and may be amendable and to\nassess if and how they may interact with the genetic predisposition\nIn conclusion, across two different datasets collected during two\ndifferent time periods, in two different countries, and for two\ndifferent ethnicities, we found remarkably similar results. These\nresults suggest that roughly half of the association between the SES\nof the rearing parents and the subsequent BMI of their biological\noffspring whom they rear is due to a potential causal influence of\nthe rearing parents' SES and that roughly half is an association\ndue to a genetic correlation between BMI and SES. On the one\nhand, implication of some degree of causation is positive because it\nsuggests that if we can identify the specific aspects of low SES that\npredispose to obesity, we may be able to influence such factors to\nachieve reductions in obesity risk. On the other hand, the results\nsuggest that the effects of any such manipulations should be\nexpected to, at most, have an effect equivalent to half of that which\nwould be expected if the association were all causal.\nSupporting Information\nAppendix S1 Simulation Studies.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: DBA TIAS KRF HTR.\nPerformed the experiments: HTR RD CH DBA TIAS.
