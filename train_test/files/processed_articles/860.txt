Controlling\nfor education or occupational status had\nminimal eVects on this association. When\nother risk factors were controlled, race/\nethnicity was not significantly associated\nwith type 2 diabetes prevalence. Among\nmen, the age adjusted odds ratio associ-\nated with African-American race/\nvariables only modestly aVected the odds\nratio for African/American race/ethnicity\namong men, while adjusting for other risk\nfactors increased the racial/ethnic diVer-\nences.\nConclusions--Economic disadvantage\nmay explain much of the excess preva-\nlence of type 2 diabetes among African-\nAmerican women, but not among men.\nRacial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes are an important public health\nissue in the United States. All major racial/\nethnic minority groups in the United States\nhave higher prevalences of diabetes than\nnon-Hispanic white people.1 2 Diabetes preva-\nlence is increasing in all population groups in\nthe United States, but this increase seems to be\ngreater in minority groups.3 The excess preva-\nlence of type 2 diabetes is particularly striking\namong African-American women, and contrib-\nuted to their declining life expectancy during\nIn contemporary industrialised societies,\nincluding the United States, there is an inverse\nrelation between socioeconomic status (SES)\nand type 2 diabetes prevalence.5 Given the\nracial/ethnic disparities in SES in the United\nStates, SES diVerences could account for some\nof the racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes\nprevalence. However, several studies have con-\ncluded that racial/ethnic disparities in type 2\ndiabetes continue to be significant after con-\ntrolling for SES as well as other risk factors.6 7\nWe tested the eVects of controlling for three\nmajor SES variables--income, education, and\noccupational status--on the racial/ethnic in-\nequalities in type 2 diabetes observed between\nAfrican-American and non-Hispanic white\nwomen and men aged 40 to 74 years in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (NHANES III). In addition, we\nexamined the extent to which risk factors that\nare often identified as potential targets for pub-\nlic health intervention, including body size,\nphysical activity, diet, and tobacco and alcohol\nuse, mediated the association between race/\nethnicity and type 2 diabetes after controlling\nMethods\nNHANES III is the most recent in a series of\nsurveys conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics designed to assess the health\nand nutritional status of the non-\ninstitutionalised civilian population of the\nUnited States. NHANES III was carried out\nand subjects aged 60 and over were oversam-\npled. Face to face interviews were conducted in\nthe households selected, and all subjects were\ninvited to participate in medical examinations\nconducted in mobile examination centres con-\nvenient to the subjects' residences. Medical\nexaminations in the mobile examination cen-\ntres for subjects aged 40 to 74 years included\noral glucose tolerance tests, unless the subject\nreported use of insulin.9\nPopulation Studies\nCenter, University of\nLocust Walk,\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJ M Robbins\nDepartment of\nEpidemiology and\nPublic Health, Yale\nUniversity, USA\nV Vaccarino\nH Zhang\nS V Kasl\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Robbins\n(Jessica_Robbins@\npop.upenn.edu)\nAccepted for publication\nwww.jech.com\nRace/ethnicity\nEach respondent was asked whether the\nsubject's national origin or ancestry was\nMexican/Mexican-American or other Latin\nAmerican or Spanish, and which of four\nchoices (Aleut, Eskimo, or American Indian;\nAsian or Pacific Islander; Black; and White)\nbest described the subject's race. Those who\nanswered no to the first question and chose\n\"Black\" were classified as African-American;\nthose who answered no to the first question\nand chose \"White\" were classified as non-\nHispanic white. All others were excluded from\nthese analyses.\nSocioeconomic status\nEducation was categorised based on the\nsubject's reported number of years of educa-\ntion. Categories used were: 0\u00ad8 years (less than\nyears (high school graduate); and 13 or more\nyears (some college). Years of education were\nunknown for 26 subjects; they were excluded\nfrom analyses including education.\nIncome was ascertained by asking respond-\nents to select one of 28 categories as best rep-\nresenting total combined family income for the\npast 12 months. Each subject's income (taken\nas the midpoint of the selected range) was then\ndivided by the applicable federal poverty line\n(which varies by calendar year and family size)\nto arrive at the poverty income ratio.10 For these\nanalyses, poverty income ratio was categorised\nas: less than 1.000 (that is, below the federal\nthe sample.\nOccupational status scores were assigned\nbased on the subject's reported usual occupa-\ntion. The scores assigned to each subject were\nthe mean Duncan socioeconomic index scores\ncalculated for the major occupational grouping\n(as defined by the US Census Bureau in 1980)\ninto which the subject's usual occupation fell.11\nThese scores were then modelled as tertiles.\nSubjects who did not report an occupation\nanalyses using this variable. For women,\nalternative models using head of household\noccupation or including a category of \"no\noccupation\" were examined; the results were\nsimilar to those presented.\nType 2 diabetes\nSubjects who reported use of anti-diabetic\nmedications were classified as having prevalent\ntype 2 diabetes, except that subjects who\nreported a physician diagnosis of diabetes and\nuse of insulin prior to age 40 were classified as\ntype 1 diabetics and excluded from the study.\nOral glucose tolerance tests with a 75 g oral\nload were conducted to ascertain diabetes sta-\ntus for the remaining subjects. Subjects exam-\nined in the morning were instructed to fast for\n12 hours before the examination, and standard\nWorld Health Organisation criteria were used\n(fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to\n7.8 mmol/l or two hour plasma glucose greater\nthan or equal to 11.1 mmol/l). Subjects who\nscheduled afternoon or evening examinations\nwere instructed to fast for six hours before the\nexamination, and a modified two hour plasma\nglucose criterion (greater than or equal to 13.9\nmmol/l) suggested by the National Diabetes\nData Group was used.9 Some analyses were\nrepeated using the 1997 American Diabetes\nAssociation criteria for diabetes.12\nCovariables\nA number of variables that are known or\nsuspected risk factors for type 2 diabetes were\nexamined as possible mediators of the relations\nbetween race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes.\nThese included three measures of adiposity:\nbody mass index (weight in kilograms divided\nby the square of height in metres); waist\u00adhip\nratio (the ratio of waist circumference to hip\ncircumference); and self reported weight at age\n(3.2 per cent) of the subjects included in these\nanalyses, weight or height measurements were\nnot obtained, and values were imputed by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics using\nstratum specific regression models. Sex specific\ntertiles were used to model each of these\nvariables. Physical activity was assessed\nthrough a series of questions regarding walking\n(\"In the past month, how often did you walk a\nmile or more at a time without stopping?\") and\nrecreational exercise during the past month.\nEach activity was assigned an intensity rating\n(defined as metabolic work rate divided by\nresting metabolic rate) based on standard\nclassifications.13 The authors calculated a total\nexercise score by multiplying the number of\ntimes that each activity was reported by its\nintensity rating and summing the total for all\nactivities; the log of the score was used in\nanalyses. Dichotomous variables for whether or\nnot the subject engaged in any vigorous physi-\ncal activity (defined as an intensity rating >\n6.0) during the preceding month and whether\nthey reported being more active or less active\nthan 10 years previously were also included in\nanalyses controlling for physical activity. Di-\netary variables (based on 24 hour dietary\nrecall) included total kilocalories consumed\nand saturated fat and total fat as percentages of\ntotal kilocalories. Cigarette smoking (ever\nsmoker, current smoker, number of cigarettes\nsmoked currently, and lifetime pack years of\nsmoking) and alcohol use (any in past 12\nmonths, frequency of drinking, and quantity\nconsumed on each occasion) were also exam-\nined as potential mediators.\nSeveral confounders were controlled in the\nanalyses. Age (in years) was controlled in all\nanalyses. Time of year was controlled because\nthere was evidence in the literature that season\nand/or ambient temperatures could aVect the\nresults of oral glucose tolerance testing.14\u00ad21\nBoth time of day (categorised as morning,\nafternoon, or evening) and reported fasting\ntimes (categorised as low--less than six hours\nfor morning examinees or less than 4.5 hours\nfor afternoon and evening examinees, average,\nor high--13 or more hours) were controlled as\nwell. Day of the week (weekend versus\n840 Robbins, Vaccarino, Zhang, et al\nwww.jech.com\nweekday) was controlled because of its poten-\ntial association with patterns of diet, physical\nactivity, and stress that are associated with gly-\ncaemic control. The recorded number of min-\nutes between the initial and the \"two hour\"\nwas controlled as well.\nData analysis\nAll analyses (except the descriptive data shown\nin table 1) use sample weights that adjust both\nfor diVerential probabilities of selection and for\nnon-response.22 The association between race/\nethnicity and type 2 diabetes was assessed\nusing logistic regression models in SUDAAN,\nversion 7.5.2, which uses generalised estimat-\ning equations to adjust for complex sample\ndesigns.23 Three sets of models were examined:\nmodels adjusted only for examination related\nconfounders and age; models in which one or\nmore of the SES variables was included in\naddition; and models in which potentially\nmediating risk factors were also controlled.\nMulticollinearity and stability of results were\nsensitivity analyses were conducted, such as\nexcluding subjects whose diabetes status was\nascertained by non-standard methods (after-\nnoon and evening examinees), excluding im-\nputed data for body mass index, and using head\nof household occupation or a separate category\nfor \"no occupation\" in analyses of occupational\nstatus in women. There were no meaningful\ndiVerences in the results observed.\nResults\nHispanic white subjects aged 40 to 74 years\ninterviewed in NHANES III, 749 did not com-\nplete an examination in the mobile examina-\ntion centre. Overall response rates were higher\nfor African-Americans than for non-Hispanic\nwhites, and were inversely associated with SES,\nbut did not vary with self reported health\nstatus. Subjects who reported previously diag-\nnosed diabetes were only slightly less likely\nthan others to be examined (85% as compared\nwith 89%), and SES diVerences in rates of\nexamination were small. Fifteen subjects who\nreported a physician diagnosis of diabetes and\nuse of insulin before age 40 were excluded as\npossible type 1 diabetics. Another 540 subjects\n(who did not report use of anti-diabetic medi-\ncations) failed to complete the oral glucose tol-\nerance test and were excluded from these\nanalyses. Among those who completed physical\nexaminations, African-Americans were less\nlikely to complete the oral glucose tolerance\ntest, but within racial/ethnic strata there was\nlittle diVerence in income, education, or self\nreported health status between those who\ncompleted the oral glucose tolerance test and\nthose who did not.\nThe resulting study sample included 2602\nwhites). The characteristics of the study sample\nare summarised in table 1. African-American\nwomen and men had less education, lower\nincomes, and lower occupational status than\nnon-Hispanic white women and men. African-\nAmerican women had a less favourable distri-\nbution of most of the established risk factors\nfor type 2 diabetes. African-American men had\na more favourable distribution of body sizes\nthan non-Hispanic white men, but reported\nsignificantly less exercise. There were also\nsignificant racial/ethnic diVerences in several of\nthe examination related variables. There was a\nhigher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among\nTable 1 Characteristics of the study population aged 40\u00ad74 years by sex and race/ethnicity, Third National Health and\nWomen Men\nAfrican-American\nAfrican-American\nExamination time (%)\nFasting time (%)\nSeason of examination (%)\nExcess type 2 diabetes in African-Americans 841\nwww.jech.com\nAfrican-American women and men than\namong non-Hispanic white women or men.\nWOMEN\nAmong women (table 2), when only age and\nexamination variables were controlled, African-\nAmerican race/ethnicity was associated with a\n76 per cent excess type 2 diabetes prevalence\neducation were evaluated together, the odds\nratio for African-American race/ethnicity was\nling for occupational status produced almost\n2.28). When poverty income ratio rather than\neducation or occupational status was added to\nthe model, the excess prevalence of type 2\ndiabetes among African-American women was\nand/or occupational status to models including\npoverty income ratio was not significant and\ndid not substantially change the results (data\nnot shown).\nWhen body size variables were controlled,\nrace/ethnicity was not significantly associated\nwith type 2 diabetes if any one of the three SES\nvariables was included in the model. Including\npoverty income ratio in the model almost com-\npletely eliminated the excess prevalence associ-\nated with African-American race/ethnicity,\neach of the other potentially mediating vari-\nables was examined individually (data not\nshown), there was no impact on the association\nbetween race/ethnicity and diabetes. Models\ncontrolling for all the mediating variables\nfurther reduced the odds ratios associated with\nAfrican-American race/ethnicity (table 2).\nWhen we repeated our analyses using the\n1997 American Diabetes Association criteria\nfor type 2 diabetes, based solely on fasting glu-\ncose values, the excess prevalence of diabetes\namong African-American women was notice-\nably greater than in the analyses using World\nHealth Organisation criteria, which are based\non both fasting and two hour glucose values.\nDespite this, when both poverty income ratio\nand other risk factors were controlled, the odds\nratio associated with African-American race/\nethnicity was no longer statistically significant\nBecause the finding that race/ethnicity was\nnot an independent risk factor for type 2\ndiabetes among women after SES variables or\nother risk factors were controlled diVers from\nanalyses were conducted to explore possible\nexplanations for this discrepancy. Because the\nother studies did not control for the examina-\ntion related variables included here, we re-\npeated the analyses without controlling for\nthese variables (time of day, time of year, day of\nweek, reported length of fast, and the recorded\nnumber of minutes between the administration\nof the glucose solution and the \"two hour\"\nblood draw). The apparent risks associated\nwith African-American race/ethnicity were\nsubstantially greater in all cases. In the model\nadjusted for age only, the odds ratio associated\nwith African-American race/ethnicity was 2.16\nFurther exploration showed that in this\nstudy, subjects examined during the summer\nwere less likely to have type 2 diabetes than\nthose examined during the rest of the year. This\nreduced prevalence of type 2 diabetes among\nsubjects examined in the summer was found in\nall four regions of the country, and among both\nAfrican-Americans and non-Hispanic white\nsubjects. African-Americans were significantly\nless likely than non-Hispanic white subjects to\nbe examined in the summer (table 1), both in\nthe South (where a majority of African-\nAmerican subjects lived, and very few examina-\ntions were conducted in the summer) and in\nother regions of the country. The timing of the\nexamination was therefore an important con-\nfounder in analyses examining the association\nbetween race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes.\nMEN\nAfrican-American race/ethnicity was associ-\nated with a 43 per cent excess prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes among men in models adjusted\nonly for age and confounders (table 3, odds\nTable 2 EVect of race/ethnicity on type 2 diabetes prevalence in women aged 40\u00ad74 years,\nControl variables OR* (95% CI*) p Value\nConfounders only\n+ socioeconomic status\n+ body size\n+ other mediators\u00a7\n*OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence intervals; PIR, Poverty income ratio; SEI, socioeconomic index.\nAdjusted for examination related variables (time of day, season of year, weekend/weekday,\nreported length of fast,and number of minutes between fasting and two hour venipuncture) and\nfor age.

Body size\nvariables were again the important added vari-\nables, but among the men central obesity (as\nmeasured by waist-hip ratio) was clearly most\nimportant (data not shown), accounting for\nabout 80 per cent of the diVerence in odds\nratios produced by controlling for all of these\nvariables.\nWe also tested these results when examina-\ntion related confounders were not controlled\n(data not shown). As with the results among\nwomen, the association between African-\nAmerican race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes\nprevalence was inflated, with an age adjusted\nthe addition of SES and other variables to the\nmodels were essentially the same as in the\nmodels described above.\nDiscussion\nTwo studies based on earlier data investigated\nthe question of whether SES accounts for the\nexcess prevalence of type 2 diabetes in African-\nAmericans and concluded that it does not.6 7\nNeither of these studies presented gender spe-\ncific analyses, and neither examined income\nadjusted for family size as a measure of SES.\nDavey Smith et al found that among the volun-\nteers screened for the Multiple Risk Factor\nIntervention Trial, excess mortality from\ndiabetes among African-American men was\nsubstantially explained by area level income,\nand completely explained when other risk fac-\ntors were controlled.27\nA previous analysis of data from NHANES\nIII, the same dataset examined here, concluded\nthat African-American race/ethnicity was sig-\nnificantly associated with increased prevalence\nafter controlling for SES.26 Several diVerent\nanalyses were performed. There are a number\nof methodological diVerences that could ex-\nplain why the findings of Winkleby et al were\ndiVerent from those reported here for women.\nThe most important seems to be that we con-\ntrolled for the season of the year when the\nexaminations were conducted, as well as time\nof day, day of the week, and fasting times. Win-\nkleby et al excluded subjects who reported fast-\ning times of less than eight hours and did not\ninclude any other examination related variables\nin their analyses. Season of the year was an\nimportant confounder of the association be-\ntween race/ethnicity and diabetes prevalence in\nthe data we analysed. When examination\nrelated variables were not controlled in our\nanalyses, the association between African-\nAmerican race/ethnicity and type 2 diabetes\nprevalence was inflated, although still not\nstatistically significant after adjustment for\npoverty income ratio and mediating variables.\nThe finding that income, modelled as\npoverty income ratio, is more strongly associ-\nated with type 2 diabetes prevalence and a\nmore important factor in explaining the excess\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes among African-\nAmerican women than other SES variables is\nconsistent with other studies, including that of\nWinkleby et al.26 Years of education may be less\neVective as a control for socioeconomic diVer-\nences between African-Americans and white\nsubjects because most of the African-\nAmericans surveyed were raised in the South\nand attended segregated schools characterised\nby inadequate resources, undertrained teach-\ners, and truncated school years. Years of\neducation in such schools provided educational\nopportunities grossly unequal to those aVorded\nto white subjects.28\nControlling only for age and examination\nrelated confounders, the excess prevalence of\ndiabetes among African-American men was\nsubstantially less than that among women. This\nhas been observed in previous studies,29\u00ad31\nalthough there are also conflicting findings.7\nControlling for SES substantially reduced the\nexcess prevalence of diabetes among African-\nAmerican women, but not men. Additional\nadjustment for possible risk factors for diabetes\nhad diametrically opposite eVects among\nwomen and men on the association between\nrace/ethnicity and diabetes, reducing the excess\nprevalence of diabetes among African-\nAmerican women, while substantially increas-\ning it among African-American men. This\nreflected the diVerent racial/ethnic distribution\nof these risk factors by gender. African-\nAmerican men in NHANES III had lower\nbody mass index, waist\u00adhip ratio, and weights\nat age 25 than non-Hispanic white men, while\nAfrican-American women had substantially\nhigher values for all of these body size variables\nthan non-Hispanic white women.

Obesity is a\nparticularly important risk factor for diabetes\nthat is associated with both African-American\nrace/ethnicity and low SES among women, but\nnot men.36 37 There is also some evidence that\nstress, which is widely hypothesised to play an\nimportant part in the associations between\nrace/ethnicity, SES, and health,38 39 has diVer-\nent psychological and metabolic eVects on\nwomen and men.40 The relative unimportance\nof SES as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes\namong men has also been observed in studies\nA number of limitations of this analysis\nshould be emphasised. Despite extensive ef-\nforts in NHANES III to maximise response\nrates, substantial non-response did occur.22\nNon-response bias occurs where the associ-\nation being examined varies by response status.\nThere is no obvious reason to anticipate such a\npattern. None the less, the potential for\nnon-response bias cannot be discounted.\nThere are important elements of SES that\nwere not examined in this study. Direct\nmeasures of childhood SES or SES through the\nlifecourse and measures of economic assets,\nincluding home ownership, were not available.\nBecause African-Americans have far fewer\neconomic assets than non-Hispanic white peo-\nple at the same levels of income or education,\ncontrolling for these variables might further\nreduce the apparent excess of type 2 diabetes\namong African-American women. It is also\npossible that these aspects of SES would\nimpact on type 2 diabetes prevalence among\nmen. In addition, the cross sectional nature of\nthe NHANES III data does not permit us to\nexclude the possibility of reverse causality, with\ndiabetes prevalence impacting family income.\nBy limiting the diagnosed cases defined as\ntype 2 diabetes to those reporting use of\nanti-diabetic medications and excluding those\nwho were diagnosed and initiated insulin use\nbefore age 40, this study may have excluded\nsome type 2 cases. Because the numbers of\ndiagnosed diabetes cases excluded was small,\nthis is unlikely to have had any important eVect\non the results.\nThis is the only study of which we are aware\nin which variables relating to the timing and\nconditions of oral glucose tolerance tests have\nbeen so extensively controlled. Controlling for\nthese variables--especially the time of year in\nwhich the examination was conducted--results\nin conclusions diVerent from those found by\nother investigators, raising the question of\nwhether there was uncontrolled confounding\nin the previous studies. We would argue that\nfuture epidemiological studies should attempt\nto control for these variables, unless examina-\ntion of the data shows that they are not\nconfounders in the given study. Our findings\nalso underline the sex diVerences in the impact\nof a number of diVerent risk factors on type 2\ndiabetes, and the importance of examining sex\nspecific models.\nThe results of this analysis suggest that the\nwell established finding of higher prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes among African-American\nwomen than among non-Hispanic white\nwomen in the United States may reflect the\neconomic disadvantage suVered by African-\nAmericans, rather than any race specific\ngenetic susceptibility. They underscore that the\nfailure to find socioeconomic or environmental\nexplanations for factors in the explanations for\nracial/ethnic disparities in health in any given\nanalysis is not meaningful evidence that these\ndiVerences are genetic in origin. The tools we\nuse to measure the eVects of SES on health are\nlimited.3 Residual confounding may explain\nthe persistence of race/ethnicity eVects in many\nanalyses.43 The health eVects of stressors\nrelated to racial and ethnic discrimination are\nanother, largely unexplored possible cause of\nracial/ethnic inequalities in type 2 diabetes and\nother health outcomes in the United States\nmay require not the tools of the biomedical\nlaboratory, but those of social, political, and\neconomic action to reduce economic inequali-\nties and social injustice.\nFunding: this work was supported by US Public Health Service\nMental Health.\nConflicts of interest: none.\n1 Kumanyika SK.
