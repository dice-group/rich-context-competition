Information about the behav-\niour and appearance of individuals can be shared among people who have not interacted with each\nother directly (e.g. gossip) as face recognition involves the mental tagging of individuals with labels\nwhich are then used as guides in future encounters (Anderson, Siegel, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett, 2011;\nSommerfeld, Krambeck, Semmann, & Milinski, 2007).\nSeveral studies have addressed the question as to whether we recognize faces of cooperators bet-\nter than faces of cheaters or vice versa, since both types of responses are plausible from an evolu-\ntionary point of view: social animals rely on cooperation, but need to detect cheaters efficiently to\navoid exploitation (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Trivers, 1971). Such duality is reflected in the com-\nplexity of previous results. Some studies showed small biases towards faces of cooperators (Barclay,\nexchanges require an enhanced recognition of cheaters for subsequent avoidance or punishment (Bar-\nfailed to find biases in the recognition of cheaters or cooperators (Buchner, Bell, Mehl, & Musch, 2009;\nMehl & Buchner, 2008) or reported biases towards faces associated with threatening rather than cheat-\ning information (Bell & Buchner, 2012). The reasons underpinning the discrepancy in those results are\nnot clear, but they may be related to the different experimental paradigms used in those studies.\nMany social encounters and exchanges involve multiple and simultaneous interactions, whereby\ngroups of faces are encoded rapidly (e.g. robberies). However, to date, remarkably few studies presented\ngroups of tagged faces for encoding. Previous studies employed individual face encoding, since during\nfree-viewing group encoding different parts of the visual field (i.e. fovea and periphery) are stimulated\nconcomitantly, and perceptual anisotropies in the vertical and horizontal planes have been widely reported\n1984; Yovea, Tambini, & Brandman, 2008) and an upper visual field (Carlson, Hogendoorn, Fonteijn, &\nVerstraten, 2011) advantage has been linked with face processing. Contextual face recognition biases in\nSpatial location in brief, free-viewing face encoding\nmodulates contextual face recognition\nSpatial location of encoding affects face recognition 353\nthe vertical plane might be small and hard to tear apart, since such recognition involves widely distributed\nsemantic, visual and even emotional processing.\nIn most of the previous recognition studies faces were not tagged with relevant social informa-\ntion and they were presented individually rather than in groups. Given the wide range of reported\nperceptual anisotropies, the question as to whether contextual face recognition after group encoding is\naffected by such anisotropies remains open.\nThis study investigated whether the spatial location of tagged faces in the visual field during brief\nencoding (10 s/group) affected subsequent face recognition. Due to the brief encoding time, it would\nbe difficult for participants to split the time equally between the visual hemifields. Based on scanning\nstudies during the reading of Western languages and biases in lighting preferences, it is predicted that\nthe recognition of faces encoded in the upper hemifield would be better than faces encoded in the\nlower hemifield. On the other hand, if such biases do not modulate the encoding of groups of faces,\nmemory biases in the horizontal plane should not be observed. Significant anisotropies related to the\nright or left visual hemifields were not expected during free-viewing encoding.\nParticipants\nsampling at two university premises. Five participants were left-handers, and four participants did not\nspecify their handedness. No financial compensation was given, but some participants received bonus\ncourse credits. Participants were informed that the experiment was about memory for faces, but no\nfurther experimental details were given. Written consent in accordance with the ethical guidelines of\nthe British Psychological Society and as approved by the university ethics committee was given by\nparticipants prior to testing. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nMaterials\nAn equal number of photographs of male and female faces (N 5 24) was selected from the XM2VTS\ndatabase. The colour, frontal head-shot photographs (227 3 181 pixels) stood against a dark blue\nbackground and had neutral expressions. In a pilot study (N 5 6), half of the faces were judged to\nbelong to actors aged over 35 years old and the other half to actors aged between 18 and 30 years old.\nThe faces were associated with one of three behaviours: cooperator, cheate, or neutral. Twelve faces\nhad to be memorized in groups of four faces (Figure 1), which were presented in one of four positions\nin the visual field: upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right. Each face set contained two males\nand two females. The remaining 12 faces were used in the recognition test.\nThe faces in each of the three categories varied across some of the participants (e.g. the \"coop-\nerator\" in one test could be the \"cheater'\" in another one). Faces were allocated to one of the three\nbehaviour groups using a simple randomization procedure (www.random.org).\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the \"old (yes)/new (no)\" recognition test. Three sets of faces were memorized\nin conjunction with behaviours linked to descriptions of cheating, cooperation and neutral behaviours. A brief\nconsolidation task (multiplications) followed the encoding phase. Afterwards, a memory test was presented\nwhereby participants saw a face and had to answer whether they had seen that face before or not.\n354 Felisberti F M, McDermott M R\nThe viewing angle was approximately 7 3 6 degrees at 60 cm from the centre of the monitor.\nE-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to design and present the face\nrecognition test.\nProcedure\nAfter reading and signing the consent forms, participants were told that the experiment would be test-\ning their memory for faces. Participants were tested individually and according to the following core\nexperimental protocol: (i) encoding of 12 faces with correspondent behaviours; (ii) distracter task\nduring memory consolidation (10 multiplications); and (iii) \"yes\u00adno\" face recognition test (48 trials:\n24 faces--12 encoded and 12 new ones--in two cycles of trials).\nIn the encoding phase, a screen introduced the social scenario, followed by another screen with\na behaviour. The information about people was obtained indirectly, i.e. participants did not suffer\nany direct financial loss. The template for the conditional rule was of the form: \"If you take benefit\nP, then you must satisfy condition Q.\" Note that the descriptors did not contain the words \"cheater,\"\n\"cooperator\" or \"neutral.\"\nThe introductory screen in the program read: \"Before you continue, it is important to know that\nJohn is a successful businessman. Through his hard work, he has managed to build a very good life\nfor himself and his family. He is also quite generous. He is willing to help out his long-time friends by\noffering them loans when needed. In the next three screens, you will meet John's friends. Press any\nkey to continue.\" The following screen read: \"You will see three groups of people. The groups have\ndifferent behaviours, which are specified in a screen before their photos. Press any key to continue.\"\nBefore the participants saw the groups of faces, the tags for cooperators, cheater, or neutrals were\nintroduced. The tags contained the following information:\n\u00b7\n\"This group of friends borrowed \u00a325,000 from John and paid it back with interest within a year;\"\n\u00b7 \"This group of friends borrowed \u00a325,000 from John and never paid it back;\"\n\u00b7 \"This group of friends did not borrow money from John.\"\nThe time allowed for reading the tags was not restricted; when participants finished reading them,\nthey simply pressed a key or clicked the mouse to move to the next screen, which contained the four\nfaces to be memorized in conjunction with the previous behaviour. The four faces in each of the groups\n(e.g. cheaters, cooperator, and neutrals) were displayed around a centred fixation point (two faces on\ntop and two below it). The faces were spaced from each other by approximately 0.2 degree of visual\nangle. The duration of encoding for each group of four faces was restricted to 10 s and participants\nwere free to move their eyes.\nThe order of encoding of the groups was randomized and counterbalanced as optimally as pos-\nsible: 27 participants encoded cooperators first; 26 participants encoded cheaters first and 27 partici-\npants encoded neutrals first. The encoding order of the second group of participants was as follows:\n25 encoded cooperators, 29 encoded cheaters and 26 encoded neutrals. Finally, the encoding order of\nthe third group of participants was as follows: 27 encoded cooperators, 25 encoded cheaters and 28\nencoded neutrals.\nThe encoding of faces and correspondent behaviour was followed by a memory consolidation\nphase, which consisted of a series of multiplications that lasted between 2 and 5 minutes. Answers\nwere entered with the keyboard and feedback after each trial was provided.\nThe recognition test started with a black fixation cross presented on a blank screen for 1 s. It was\nfollowed by another screen with a face and the question \"Have you seen this face before?\" Half of the\nfaces had been memorized in the encoding phase, and half of the faces were new faces, absent from the\nencoding phase. Participants answered by pressing a key (1 5 yes; 2 5 no). Feedback was provided\nafter each trial. To continue to the next trial, participants just pressed any key or clicked the mouse.\nTwo cycles of 24 faces (12 tagged and memorized, 12 new) were presented in randomized order to\neach participant (N 5 48 trials). The whole procedure lasted approximately 20 minutes.\nData analysis\nParticipants' performance was measured as response sensitivity (d9) and reaction time (RT) for cor-\nrepeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) had the descriptors tagged to faces (cooperator,\nSpatial location of encoding affects face recognition 355\ncheater, neutral) and the visual hemifields (upper vs. lower or left vs. right) as the within-subject\nfactors. The dependent variables were the d9 and the RT. The performance or quadrant was not ana-\nlysed statistically due to the relatively small sample size or quadrant/behaviour. Greenhouse\u00adGeisser\nadjustments to the degrees of freedom were performed when sphericity could not be assumed (Mauchly's\nsphericity test). All pair wise comparisons were carried out using Bonferroni adjustments. Partial eta-\nsquared (p2) was used to refer to effect size.\nThis experiment was designed to investigate whether the spatial location of faces during encoding\naffected the subsequent face recognition task. As mentioned previously, groups of four faces were\ntagged with one of three behaviours (cooperators, cheaters or neutrals). All faces in a group were\npresented simultaneously for encoding (10 s/group), but each face was presented in a different visual\nquadrant (upper left, upper right, lower left, or lower right).\nThe analysis of the d9 across all visual quadrants showed significant differences related to the\nThe response latency also differed according to the behavioural tags.

Equally, data from the upper-right and upper-left quadrants\nwere aggregated into an upper (\"Up\") hemifield and the data encoded in the lower-right and lower-left\nquadrants were aggregated into a lower (\"Lo\") hemifield.\nUpper (Up) versus lower (Lo) hemifield\nA significant interaction was observed between behavioural tag and the two encoding hemifields\ninverse occurred with the d9 for cheaters, which was lower in the Up (d9 5 1.30, SE 5 0.13) than in the\nboth hemifields (d9\nUp\nLo\nPairwise comparisons between faces encoded in the Up hemifield showed that participants were\nmore sensitive to cooperators than cheaters (p , 0.001) and neutrals (p 5 0.002).

However, like in this study they also reported that participants looked\nlonger at cheaters than cooperators. Some differences in the two experimental designs make it difficult\nto explain some of the contradictory results. For example, in their study, faces were encoded indi-\nvidually, encoding time was not restricted, and the rules of the social contract were explicit, whereas\nin this study, no social contract rule was specified, encoding time was restricted to 10 s, faces were\nFigure 2.

The quadrants were paired into two hemifields: upper vs.\nlower hemifield (a, c) and left vs. right hemifield (b, d). Line bars indicated the SE. Significant differences within\nthe same category are shown by asterisks close to the bars, whereas differences between categories are shown by\nSpatial location of encoding affects face recognition 357\npresented in groups and the tags did not contain explicit words related to moral aspects of the behav-\niours described.\nDifferences in d9 and RT linked to the hemifield of encoding were recorded for the first time. The\nrecognition of cooperators was markedly better than of cheaters and neutrals when faces had been\nencoded in the upper hemifield, whereas no differences in d9 were observed for faces encoded in the\nlower hemifield. It is possible that participants' scanning patterns during reading (Heath, Rouhana,\nencoding and subsequent recognition. In such case, faces in the upper hemifield would have had more\nencoding time than faces in the lower hemifield, since the group encoding was restricted to 10 s and it\nwould have been difficult to allocate an equal share of time to each of the four faces in the group. In\naddition, the three groups of faces were interleaved with written behavioural descriptors, which could\nhave acted as priming or masks. In pilot studies from this lab, contextual memory biases were attenu-\nated or eliminated when faces were encoded individually rather than in groups and encoding time was\nraised to up to 9 s/face. Further studies are being carried out to confirm those preliminary results.\nAs mentioned previously, the order of face encoding was randomized and counterbalanced, but\nthe overall advantage for cooperators over cheaters was observed independently of whether coopera-\ntors were the first, second or third group to be encoded. Furthermore, in a larger study (N 5 153; under\nreview), we showed a similar advantage for cooperators over cheaters even when the encoding order\nwas fixed.\nThe findings in this study are also in line with the results showing a right-upper advantage in face\nmatching tasks (Hagenbeek & Van Strien, 2002). They are also in line with the results from Raymond\n(2002), who reported an advantage for information encoded in the upper hemifield for branded images\nin relation to non-branded ones. Indeed, an advantage of the upper hemifield for visual encoding has\nbeen proposed by Previc (1990), whereby images viewed above the point of gaze would be prefer-\nentially associated with perceptual categorization and an \"offline\" analysis and storage of images,\nwhereas images viewed below the point of gaze would be linked to the ongoing motor control of one's\nlimbs (e.g. \"online\" processing).\nIn addition to the idea of anisotropies related to one's reading habits and peripersonal space,\nthe advantage of visual processing in the upper hemifield may be also linked to prior visual knowl-\nedge about the environment (e.g. light comes from overhead). Such knowledge seems to be used\nto disambiguate scenes and leads to processing biases towards upper, left-lit stimuli (Gerardin, de\nThe d9 for cooperators, cheaters and neutrals encoded in the left or the right hemifields was simi-\nlar, since visual scanning in the horizontal plane is a more common task during reading than the scan-\nning in the vertical plane. The lack of left versus right encoding differences in relation to the same\nbehaviour may be related to the fact that both semantic and visual processing play a fundamental role\nin contextual face recognition, which activates different systems in the right and left hemispheres\n(Goel, Shuren, Sheesley, & Grafman, 2004). In addition, bilateral face processing has been shown to\nbe more prominent in females (Bourne & Hole, 2006; Proverbio, Riva, Martin, & Zani, 2010), who\nwere the majority of the participants in this study.\nThe spatial anisotropies in face recognition results did not explain why cheaters were not remem-\nbered as well as cooperators and neutrals, but they showed that contextual face recognition was flex-\nible and finely tuned not only to changes in the social context but also to changes in the spatial location\nin which faces were encoded.\nThe findings indicate that the spatial location of faces during brief, free-viewing encoding modu-\nlated contextual face recognition significantly in the horizontal visual plane. The findings in this study\nare particularly relevant to cases where several faces are encoded in a brief period of time (e.g. eye\nwitness cases). The results are likely to reflect participants' scanning patterns associated with reading,\ntop-left bias in lighting preference and/or the perception of their peripersonal space.\n"
