Novak-Leonard*, Michael K. O'Malley and Eileen Truong\nCultural Policy Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA\nA growing gap between national metrics of arts participation and the many, evolving ways in\nwhich people participate in artistic and aesthetic activities limits the degree to which such data\ncan usefully inform policy decisions. The National Endowment for the Arts' Survey of Public\nParticipation in the Arts (SPPA) is the primary source of arts participation data in the USA, but\nthis instrument inadequately evaluates how members of minority and immigrant communities\nparticipate in the arts. As the USA nears a historic demographic shift to being a majority\u00ad\nminority nation \u00ad non-Hispanic White individuals will no longer be a demographic majority\nby about 2041 \u00ad obtaining more accurate measures of artistic activities that are meaningful\nto a more diverse population will be of increasing importance for public policy-making. To\nbetter understand the extent to which the SPPA's questions capture the range of artistic\nactivities engaged in by members of immigrant communities, we cognitively tested a subset\nof the survey's questions with Chinese immigrants to the USA as a pilot case. We found\nthat interviewees participate in a range of culturally specific and non-culturally specific arts\nactivities that they did not report in response to the survey's questions. In this article, we\ndraw upon these interviews to discuss the reasons underpinning the gap and suggest\nimplications for updating research tools and future research. A better understanding of the\ngap between measured and actual \"arts participation\" will lead to improved measures and\ninformation to support artistic expression and arts more reflective of contemporary society.\nKeywords: arts participation; cultural participation; cultural practice; immigrants; cognitive\ninterviewing; survey design\nIntroduction\nIndividuals express themselves artistically through many means and engage with art in numerous\nways. Such expression includes attending arts events, consuming artistic products, and creating,\ncollecting, curating and practicing cultural traditions that involve aesthetic expression. Although\nthe domain of artistically expressive activity is evolving due to technological advances and is\ncomplex due to the varied contexts and motivations for these behaviors, available survey data\ncapture only a fraction of this activity. In general, available survey data provide a largely reduc-\ntionist view that places disproportionate emphasis on the consumption of cultural products stem-\nming from a Western European tradition. The origins of such bias are that consumptive activities\ncan be relatively straightforwardly defined and thus measured (UNESCO Institute for Statistics,\n2012, p. 11). While the challenges associated with reliably measuring the broad domain of artis-\ntically expressive activity are readily acknowledged, the growing gap between what is measured\nand what people value and do with art is a growing concern.\n*Corresponding author. Email: jnovak@uchicago.edu\nIn the USA, the National Endowment for the Arts' (NEA) periodic Survey of Public Partici-\npation in the Arts (SPPA) is the primary source of data on adult arts participation. The SPPA has\nbeen fielded approximately every five years since 1982 and while questions have been amended\nand expanded over time, the changes made to the most recent survey instrument fielded in 2012\nare the most substantial to date. In particular, the NEA added questions designed to collect infor-\nmation on new ways that individuals create and interact with arts online in order to measure a\nbroader array of arts participation behaviors taking place in the USA. However, the SPPA's instru-\nment continues its emphasis on arts attendance, which was originally intended to provide insights\nto non-profit arts organizations about their health (Novak-Leonard et al., 2014; Orend, 1977;\nTepper & Gao, 2008). The SPPA's aggregate measure of attendance at benchmark arts \u00ad which\nincludes having attended a ballet, classical music, jazz, opera, musicals or plays, or visiting an\nart museum during the prior 12 months \u00ad has remained consistent throughout the survey's\nhistory and makes the survey unmatched in its facilitation of long-term trend analysis of arts\nattendance in the USA (Pettit, 2000). Nonetheless, the focus on measures of consumptive behav-\nior is problematic for measuring arts-related behaviors within minority1 and immigrant commu-\nAs the USA nears a historic demographic shift to being a majority\u00adminority nation, more\ninclusive and accurate measures of arts participation within minority and immigrant communities\nbecome increasingly important for empowering cultural researchers and informing public policy-\nmaking. By approximately 2041, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that non-Hispanic Whites will\nno longer comprise the majority of the American public (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b). Hispanics\nare projected to comprise approximately 30 per cent of the US population, Blacks/African Amer-\nicans about 13 per cent and Asians/Pacific Islanders about 8 per cent (Farrell & Medvedeva,\n2010). Historically, the data captured by the SPPA have suggested that arts participation is dispro-\nportionately undertaken by non-Hispanic Whites and early analysis of the 2012 SPPA's data\nsuggests the same (DiMaggio & Ostrower, 1992; National Endowment for the Arts, 1999,\nThe SPPA has been deemed inadequate for measuring arts-related behaviors within minority\nand immigrant communities for two key reasons. First, the SPPA's emphasis on arts attendance,\ngiven that members of immigrant communities tend to favor participatory forms of engaging with\nstein (2005, p. 3) argues that \"the relatively narrow and passive definitions of arts participation\nused in the [SPPA] disproportionately affect the results measured among Hispanics and people\nwho are not white, systematically producing lower rates of arts participation among these\ngroups\". Additionally, studies using attendance measures typically find that higher levels of edu-\ncational attainment and income strongly predict participation while race and ethnicity have little\nnet predictive power (Love & Klipple, 1995; Welch & Kim, 2010), but recent research that looks\nclosely at measures of participatory forms of engaging with art finds that identifying as a minority\nor as an immigrant has significant net effects on participation (Novak-Leonard, Reynolds,\nEnglish, & Bradburn, 2015). A second reason is the implied meaning of the term \"arts partici-\npation\", which connotes Western artistic forms, and the practical emphasis on these forms,\ngiven significance of the benchmark arts for trend analysis (Novak-Leonard et al., 2014). In\nsome minority and immigrant communities, the concept of \"art\" is not distinct from the aesthetic\nelements of daily, cultural or ritual practice (Brown, 2001; Jones, 1971; Novak-Leonard et al.,\n2014). However, relatively little research has looked at this in depth or as it relates to studying\n\"arts participation\".3 While this lack of clarity between what is artistic and what is a meaningful\nactivity or object that embodies aesthetic qualities or creative expression applies across society,\nunderstanding how these distinctions are meaningful is particularly important for \"arts partici-\npation\" research relevant to racial and ethnic minority groups within the USA.\nIn this investigation, we applied cognitive testing to the 2012 SPPA in order to elucidate the\nprocess by which immigrants perceive and respond to these questions about arts participation.\nThe SPPA's instruments have previously been subject to pilot testing with general population\nsamples, but, to our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore how members of immigrant com-\nmunities understand the SPPA's questions (Keegan, 1987; Robinson, Keegan, Karth, & Triplett,\n1987; Triplett, 2011). Specifically, we sought to understand whether immigrants would report cul-\nturally specific activities in response to the SPPA's questions and if not, why not. As researchers\nand federal agencies seek to update their surveys of arts participation and develop complementary\nforms of research, on the basis of our pilot case, we argue that greater attention needs to be paid to\nthe forms of artistic and aesthetic expression that are happening within and across diverse popu-\nlations. This pilot study thus provides a foundation for developing improved and different\nresearch tools for understanding and measuring \"arts participation\".\nMethodology\nThe objective of our study was to discover the extent to which the SPPA captures arts engagement\nwithin immigrant communities and to describe the reasons underlying any identified gaps. As a\ncase for studying immigrants in the USA more generally, this article draws upon interviews con-\nducted with 14 adult Chinese-Americans and Chinese immigrants who reside, work or utilize\nimmigrant social services in Chinatown in Chicago, Illinois in the USA.4 Eleven interviewees\nwere recruited with the help of the Chinese American Service League, a social service agency\nfor Chinese-American immigrants, and three interviewees were recruited by the Chinese-Amer-\nican Museum of Chicago. Both organizations are located in the heart of Chicago's Chinatown.\nInterviews were conducted onsite at each location in February and March 2014, and were con-\nducted with the assistance of translators who spoke English, Mandarin and Cantonese. Intervie-\nwees were paid a $10 incentive to participate and each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes.\nInterviewees were asked a subset of questions from the 2012 SPPA's question series about\nattendance at arts events and about making art. Given the importance of the benchmark arts\nthroughout the SPPA's history, these questions were used in the interviews. The subset of ques-\ntions about making art were primarily selected on the basis that they had been used relatively con-\nsistently across the SPPA's waves. Table 1 lists the SPPA's questions tested in the interviews.\nAlthough the question about social dancing is new to the 2012 SPPA, it captured one of the\nhighest rates of arts participation at 32 per cent (National Endowment for the Arts, 2014).\nInterviews were semi-structured and used probing questions in an attempt to establish context\nand motivation for the responses. Interviewers used concurrent and retrospective verbal probing\ntechniques (Willis, 1999). The probes included asking interviewees to describe specific instances\nor events that they thought about before answering the question, and specific instances or events\nthey excluded from their response. Interviewees were asked about where, with whom, and at what\ntime of year the activities occurred, and about why the interviewee engaged in the activity\n(Brown, 2006; McCarthy, Ondaatje, Zakaras, & Brooks, 2004). In addition, we asked an open-\nended question about the interviewees' involvement in any activities that they considered to be\n\"creative, cultural or artistic\" (Novak-Leonard et al., 2015).\n\"Does this count?\"\nFrom the interview data, we find a gap between what interviewees reported they do in terms of\narts participation in response to the SPPA's questions and the reality of what they do. While inter-\nviewees' direct answers to the SPPA's questions suggested low levels of arts participation, all the\ninterviewees revealed that they participated in additional artistic and creative activities via\nsubsequent probes. The gap between the direct responses given to the SPPA's questions and inter-\nviewees' actual activities seemed to stem from interviewees' uncertainty about what the SPPA's\nquestions implied about what counts as \"arts participation\". Interviewers were instructed to accept\nall responses and to clarify for interviewees that they were welcome to share anything that came to\nmind during the interview. However, despite this openness, interviewees projected awareness that\nthey were operating without a clear understanding of what was intended by the survey questions.\nA third of the interviewees explicitly asked \"does [this] count?\"\nIn response to a question about visiting an art museum or a gallery during the past year, a middle-\naged man who primarily spoke Mandarin in the interview, quickly replied \"yes\", and listed the Field\nMuseum, the Chicago Children's Museum, Adler Planetarium and the Chicago History Museum.\nThe interviewer then asked him whether he visited any galleries in the past 12 months. He\nreplied that he attended an exhibition of Chinese calligraphy at a library, but that he was not sure\nwhether that could be counted as a visit to a gallery. Once probed about his own thoughts, he con-\ncluded that it should count as a visit to a gallery and ultimately added that he thought of things with\nhistorical and cultural significance when he heard the terms \"museum\" and \"gallery\".\nWhen a middle-aged interviewee was asked if she took any \"photographs as an artistic\nactivity\", she wanted to know whether pictures of \"daily life when she goes outside\" counted.\nShe qualified her responses by saying that she was not sure if she would have the \"right\nanswers\", and although the interviewers tried to reassure her, there was no right answer, she\nappeared to remain unconvinced. In her later comments, she implied that she thought there\nwere correct answers to questions about arts participation.\nTable 1. Interview questions drawn from the 2012 SPPA.\nThe following questions are about your activities during the last 12 months between {date of interview},\nQuestions about art-making\n... did you take any photographs as an artistic activity?\n... did you create any other visual art, such as paintings, sculpture, or graphic designs?\n... did you work with pottery, ceramics, or jewelry?\n... did you do any leatherwork, metalwork or woodwork?\n... did you do any weaving, crocheting, quilting, needlepoint, knitting, or sewing?\n... did you play a musical instrument?\n... did you do any acting?\n... did you perform or practice any dance?\n... did you do any social dancing, including dancing at weddings, clubs, or other social settings?\n... did you perform or practice any singing?\nQuestions about attending arts events\n... did you visit an art museum or gallery?\n... did you visit a crafts fair or a visual arts festival?\n... , with the exception of elementary or high school performances did you go to a live classical music\nperformance such as symphony, chamber, or choral music during the last 12 months?\n... , with the exception of elementary or high school performances did you go to a live ballet performance\nduring the last 12 months?\n... , with the exception of elementary or high school performances, did you go to a live dance performance\nother than ballet, such as modern, contemporary, folk, traditional, or tap dance during the last 12 months?\n... , with the exception of elementary or high school performances, did you go to a live musical, or\nnonmusical, stage play during the last 12 months\n... , with the exception of elementary or high school performances, did you go to a live opera during the last\n... did you visit an outdoor festival that featured performing artists?\nSource: National Endowment for the Arts (2012a).\nOne interviewee explained more explicitly that certain activities would not count as a\nresponse to the SPPA's questions because the activity was not adequately formal. For example,\none older male interviewee believed that for an activity to count as a response it \"must be a\npublic event\". He added that private activities were too ambiguous to define, as they were\nsubject to the personal definition of the participants and could be either artistic or not. Throughout\nthe interview, he remained firm in his belief, further elaborating that for acting and singing per-\nformances, the performance must be on a public stage.\nFrom an etic perspective, these examples suggest that the interviewees are engaged in artistic\nand cultural activities; however, these individuals are uncertain whether these activities are legit-\nimate activities when responding to the SPPA's questions. In one case, the interviewee is adamant\nabout the kinds of activities that do not fit within the implied definitional boundaries of the SPPA's\nquestions. In the following sections, we discuss reasons underlying the uncertainty that emerge\nfrom the interview data.\nQuestioning culturally specific activities\nChinese culture is generally recognized as one rich in arts, in both traditional and contemporary\nforms. Multiple interviewees reported engaging in activities rooted in Chinese culture, yet only a\nfew explained that they included these activities when formulating direct responses to the SPPA's\nquestions.\nSix interviewees shared that they do calligraphy, but they shared differing views as to whether it\ncounts as art. When asked if he had created any \"visual art, such as paintings, sculpture or graphic\ndesigns\", a middle-aged interviewee quickly answered \"no\". However, when the interviewer asked\nhim if he could \"extend the realm of visual art to anything he did in the past 12 months involving\nvisual or graphic works\", he answered that he did Chinese calligraphy. In response to the same\nSPPA question, another interviewee who immigrated over 10 years ago hesitated before answering\n\"no\". Later in the interview, she shared that she did calligraphy. The interviewer asked her why,\nsince she practiced calligraphy, did she answer \"no\" to the previous question asking about\nvisual arts in the last 12 months. She responded that she was unclear about what \"visual art\"\nentailed. She explained, \" ... calligraphy is extremely dependent on the hand and gestures from\nthe hand, ... whereas visual art is something that you look at\". This same interviewee shared\nthat she tied knots as a traditional Chinese art form. She finds the knots to be visually pretty and\nenjoys looking at and trying to replicate them, but seemed uneasy about considering it to be a\nmeans of engaging with art despite her appreciation of its aesthetics. She initially learned knot\ntying as physical therapy for her fingers while she was in the hospital back in Hong Kong. She\nsaid she found the activity fun and especially enjoyed the handmade aspect. Knot tying also\ngave her an opportunity to interact with friends. She said that when she gathers with her friends,\neveryone shares what they have learned and shows the knots they have already completed.\nIn another interview, when asked, \"During the last 12 months, did you do any acting?\", the\nmiddle-aged interviewee answered in Chinese, and the translator responded, \"she [the intervie-\nwee] mentioned Tai Chi, but no acting\". The interviewer then asked if she considered Tai Chi\nas more of a dance, or if she does it for exercise. The translator responded after the interviewee\nspoke, \"For fitness \u00ad she does that every night\".\nMany of the activities interviewees engage in are hard to classify using Western definitions of\nart forms. As both Rosenstein (2005) and Moriarty (2004) point out, the culturally rooted arts activi-\nties of immigrant communities differ from the benchmark arts activities in the sense that they are\noften more participatory. Furthermore, individuals from immigrant communities show \"clear differ-\nence[s] in attitudes about artistic or creative engagement\" when compared to others from the\nmajority culture of a host country (Rosenstein, 2005, p. 3). Therefore, their activities do not fit\nneatly into the categories of a survey instrument that has not been designed with such activities in\nmind. As a result, these activities may show up as survey responses in an unexpected place, such as\nTai Chi being given in response to a question about acting, or they may not show up at all.\nQuestioning the importance of artistic intentions\nA second explanation for the uncertainty about \"what counts\" as a response to the SPPA's ques-\ntions is questioning whether activities undertaken for reasons besides expressing one's self artis-\ntically or to consume others' artistic creations count. This relates to our first suggested\nexplanation, but goes beyond culturally rooted activities. In cases such as these, one might\nlook at the motivation behind an activity to determine the degree of its creative or artistic\nnature or intent, but as has been found in other research, motivations are mixed, and not\nalways conscious (Belfiore & Bennett, 2007). The following responses were offered with some\nreluctance.\nIn response to the question, \"In the last 12 months, did you do any work with leather, metal, or\nwood?\", a middle-aged interviewee responded that she built a desk for her daughter. When asked\nabout her reasons for building the desk, the interviewee explained she did it for functional and\ncreative reasons,\n... I think it's more satisfying for myself so I get what I want, and cheaper, and more comfortable for\nmyself because I know what I want and what I need. If I want a special design, it's more expensive, so\nwhy not do it? Because, I can.\nAnother middle-aged interviewee gave a similar response in discussing photographs she took of a\nchildren's performance of traditional Chinese dances. She noted that, on the one hand, the chil-\ndren were wearing traditional costumes, and they looked very beautiful, and she wanted to pre-\nserve the celebration of Chinese culture. On the other hand, \"children grow up very quickly and I\nwanted to be able to capture the moment and have good memories\".\nOf the 14 respondents, seven interviewees reported practicing weaving, crocheting, quilting,\nneedlepoint, knitting, or sewing, but for differing motivations. One interviewee, a middle-aged\nwoman, shared that she really liked sewing and explained that she makes hair accessories for\nher daughter and other embellishments for her daughter's clothes, such as flowers that can be\nattached to skirts. However, another respondent explained that the sewing she had done in the\npast 12 months was only to help mend a garment if someone at home had a tear in his or her\nclothes and wanted to know if that \"counted\". Fixing things was also the motivation for\nanother interviewee. Also of middle age, when asked about leatherwork, metalwork or wood-\nwork, he answered that he rarely did these works for artistic purposes. For practical reasons,\nthough, the interviewee had worked with metal or wood more than 10 times in the past 12\nmonths. When asked to describe his work with metal and wood, he mentioned using nails to\nfix things. As for woodwork, he mentioned that he sometimes mends furniture and chairs.\nThree interviewees cited health benefits as their main motivation for engaging in Tai Chi, tra-\nditional lion dancing, and kung fu, but also recognized each of these as a culturally based art. One\ninterviewee began lion dancing with a performance group about 10 years prior, while she was still\nliving in Hong Kong. Since coming to Chicago, however, she no longer performs at public events,\nbut practices lion dancing as a way to exercise. Another interviewee explained that she practices\nTai Chi and light kung fu exercise every morning, as she explained \"[to] feel the energy flow all\nover the body\".\nThree of our interviewees were parents who reported that their only motivation for attending\nmuseums or concerts was to expose their children to the arts and spend time with them. In\nresponse to a question asking about attending any museum or gallery in the last 12 months, one\ninterviewee responded that she had visited multiple museums with her daughter and that the learn-\ning opportunities for her daughter were important to her. Another respondent confirmed that she\nattended concerts in the park during the summer. When the interviewer asked her why she and her\nfriends wanted to go with their children, she replied that she and the other parents wanted to\nexpose their children to as many kinds of culture and music as possible.\nSix of the 14 interviewees reported singing karaoke when asked if they have sung in the past\n12 months. One interviewee mentioned that he goes to his friend's house for karaoke every other\nmonth. An older interviewee thinks that karaoke is especially important as it allows her to spend\ntime with people who matter to her.\nThe interviewees' responses suggest some ambiguity about how central the \"arts\" must be to\nthe activity or experience to qualify it as counting for a response to the SPPA's questions. This\ncreates an interesting juxtaposition with existing literature that discusses the range of motivations\nfor engaging in various arts-related activities, including promoting one's physical and mental\nhealth and, namely, social interactions (Blume-Kohout, Leonard, & Novak-Leonard, 2015;\nLena & Lindemann, 2014; Moriarty, 2004). Understanding the broad range of ways that experi-\nences with arts and culture bring value to individuals is an explicit priority for the NEA (National\nEndowment for the Arts, 2012b); however, the interview data suggest that individuals may be fil-\ntering their responses to the SPPA's questions based on these same values and motivations when\nthey feel that the \"art\" in the activity does not meet an implied threshold of artistic intention or\nawareness.\nLimitations\nThis study takes an initial step toward elucidating the gap between what the SPPA captures in\nterms of arts engagement within immigrant communities and the reality. However, we recognize\nthe limitations of this pilot study. The primary limitations to this study are considerations about\ntranslation and its limited sample. For the interviews, a subset of the SPPA's questions was trans-\nlated into Mandarin and Cantonese and we acknowledge the complications introduced when\ntranslating a survey instrument (Berkanovic, 1980; Davidov & De Beuckelaer, 2010). As is the\nchallenge with translations generally, direct translation does not always clearly convey the\nintended meaning. Further research is warranted to understand how well the terminology used\nin the SPPA translates, literally and conceptually, into other languages.\nOur sample is limited to one specific community of immigrants and is modest in its size. The\nemergent themes from this pilot study should be tested with larger samples and refined through\nadditional interviews with other immigrant communities. Additionally, while questions about the\nartistic intent of an activity emerged from our interviews with an immigrant sample, further testing\nis warranted to understand the generalizability of this finding to the whole of the US population.\nDiscussion\nWhile this article focused on immigrant communities, several core concepts apply to the US\npopulation at large. Across society, addressing the gap between measured arts participation and\nactual engagement in artistic expression represents a contemporary policy priority (Rife, King,\nThomas, & Li, 2014). Given that many policy decisions are reliant on quantitative measures of\narts participation, greater clarity about the strengths and limitations of tools measuring arts par-\nticipation is important for well-informed public policy.\nIn this study, we summarize a pilot set of cognitive interviews with members of the Chinese\nimmigrant community as a case of immigrant communities. The results help inform why there is a\ngap between the arts participation behavior captured by the SPPA's data within minority and\nimmigrant communities and actual engagement with arts and culture. Even though this research\nis a pilot, it identifies several important questions that should be considered for measuring \"arts\nparticipation\".\nWhat is currently being measured? The SPPA serves as the preeminent source of data on how\nadults in the USA engage in art and cultural activities; however, it is important to understand the\nextent to which it captures the true nature of people's engagement with arts and culture. In this\npilot study, we determined that even describing the survey as one about \"arts participation\"\nevoked notions about a limited set of qualifying activities and biased responses. Multiple inter-\nviewees did not think that their activities qualified as appropriate activities to report in response\nto the survey questions, despite the interviewees explicitly valuing the aesthetic and creative\naspects of the activity, which seem like characteristics germane to much \"arts participation\".\nAt a minimum, this pilot investigation suggests that future surveys on arts participation should\ninclude questions worded in a broader and more inclusive fashion. Currently, the SPPA's ques-\ntions about attendance at arts events largely ask about events of specific artistic genres, such as\nballet or classical music, as opposed to asking more generally about dance or music, respectively.\nWhen more broadly stated arts participation survey questions have been employed in other\nresearch, the distribution of participants more closely reflects the racial and ethnic composition\nof the population (Novak-Leonard et al., 2015; Rosenstein, 2005), suggesting that such\nbroader question phrasing reduces racial and ethnic bias in survey responses.\nBut, this alsoraises questions aboutthe types of research needed as society and\"art\" evolve to be\nclear about what is being measured with existing survey tools, what information is needed for\npolicy-making purposes, and what are the most appropriate methods for developing this knowledge.\nWhat needs to be understood? If research and policy communities are aiming to understand\nthe range of ways that people in the USA engage in art and cultural activities, then this pilot study\nsuggests that more research is needed to understand multiple cultural frames of reference; what\nactivities are considered to be artistic, creative and cultural within those frames; and the values\nthat people derive from those experiences. This pilot suggests that interviewees were operating\nwith an awareness that they did not have a good grasp of what might be deemed American\narts participation, and in their survey responses, these individuals endeavored to describe their\nown activities with respect to that perceived frame of reference. As the demographic composition\nof the USA shifts to majority\u00adminority, what might be deemed as American arts participation\nmay shift and more research is needed to understand what creative and cultural activities\nmatter to people living within the USA.\n"
