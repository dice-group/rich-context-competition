Although prior studies\nshow these cells become activated during experimental\nalphavirus encephalitis in mice to generate cytokines and\nchemokines that influence virus replication, tissue inflam-\nmation and neuronal survival, the specific PRRs (pattern\nrecognition receptors) and signalling intermediates con-\ntrolling microglial activation in this setting remain\nunknown. To investigate these questions directly in vivo,\nmice ablated of specific TLR signalling molecules were\nchallenged with NSV (neuroadapted Sindbis virus) and CNS\nviral titres, inflammatory responses and clinical outcomes\nfollowed over time. To approach this problem specifically\nin microglia, the effects of NSV on primary cells derived\nfrom the brains of wild-type and mutant animals were\ncharacterized in vitro. From the standpoint of the virus,\nmicroglial activation required viral uncoating and an intact\nviral genome; inactivated virus particles did not elicit\nmeasurable microglial responses. At the level of the target\ncell, NSV triggered multiple PRRs in microglia to produce a\nbroad range of inflammatory mediators via non-overlap-\nping signalling pathways. In vivo, disease survival was\nsurprisingly independent of TLR-driven responses, but still\nrequired production of type-I IFN (interferon) to control\nCNS virus replication. Interestingly, the ER (endoplasmic\nreticulum) protein UNC93b1 facilitated host survival\nindependent of its known effects on endosomal TLR\nsignalling. Taken together, these data show that alpha-\nviruses activate microglia via multiple PRRs, highlighting\nthe complexity of the signalling networks by which CNS\nhost responses are elicited by these infections.\n",

These receptors detect common replication intermedi-\nates of most viral pathogens, including double-stranded RNA\n(TLR3), single-stranded RNA (TLR7 and TLR8) and unmethylated\nDNA (TLR9). Along with TLR2 and TLR4 that can respond to\ncertain viral proteins, these receptors form a critical network of\nsensors that activate innate host responses against viruses.\nIndeed, six human TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9)\nand five murine TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9) can\ntrigger the production of type-I IFN (interferon) that is central\nto antiviral host defence (Zhang et al., 2007; Barbalat et al.,\n2009).

Over the last decade, mice with\ndefects in these various nucleotide-sensing TLRs or their\ndownstream adaptor molecules have been shown to exhibit\ndiverse outcomes when challenged with different viral\nintracellular TLRs (e.g. TLR13) that detect and respond to\nviruses continue to be identified (Shi et al., 2011).\nRecently, a point mutation of the ER protein, UNC93b1,\nwas found to ablate TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 signalling in mice\nstudies showed that the mutant protein fails to transfer these\nTLRs from the ER to their expected location in endosomes\n(Kim et al., 2008). This 3d (triple defect) causes macrophages\nfrom these mice to be profoundly impaired in their responses\nto ligation of the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs as measured by\nthe production of multiple cytokines, including IFNa/b\nmice) proved highly susceptible to a systemic viral infection\nthat normal mice survived (Tabeta et al., 2006). Parallel\nstudies showed that humans with similar germline mutations\nPBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) that do not\nproduce IFNa/b in response to TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9 ligands,\nPBMCs with reduced IFNa/b production following exposure\nto different viruses, and high lethality from HSE (herpes\nsimplex encephalitis) (Casrouge et al., 2006). Conversely,\nthese same individuals mount effective immune responses\nagainst other viruses, verifying the presence of redundant\npathways that drive type-I IFN production previously shown\nto exist in rodents (Casrouge et al., 2006).\nSince the susceptibility of UNC93b1-mutant mice to CNS\n(central nervous system) viral infection has not been well\nstudied, we challenged these animals with an NSV (neuroa-\ndapted Sindbis virus) that causes a highly lethal encephalo-\nmyelitis. Titres of infectious virus, local inflammatory\nresponses and clinical disease outcomes were compared with\nwild-type hosts. To characterize how CNS-derived myeloid\ncells known to express the nucleotide-sensing TLRs respond to\nNSV, primary microglia isolated from wild-type and\nUNC93b1-mutant animals were exposed to virus or synthetic\nTLR ligands in vitro. Our data show that multiple PRRs\n(pattern recognition receptors) and downstream signalling\npathways, including but not limited to the endosomal TLRs,\ndrive the breadth of microglial cytokine and chemokine\nproduction in response to NSV. Nonetheless, host survival\nfrom infection appears largely independent of these TLR-\ndriven responses, even though it requires production of type-I\nIFN to control CNS virus replication. Furthermore, the\nheightened susceptibility of UNC93b1-mutant mice to NSV\ninfection is likely explained by a mechanism other than a\ndefect in endosomal TLR signalling, in large part because\nredundant pathways driving type-I IFN production keep early\nCNS virus replication in check. In this light, therapeutics\ndirected at these receptors and their signalling intermediates\nfor the treatment of acute alphavirus encephalitis in humans\nmust be carefully considered.\nAnimals\nWild-type C57BL/6 mice and TLR3-deficient mice were\npurchased from The Jackson Laboratory. C57BL/6-\nUnc93b13d/3d mutant mice were obtained from the Mutant\nMouse Regional Resource Center at the University of\nCalifornia. Mice rendered genetically deficient in the TLR\nadaptor protein, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation response\ngene 88) were a gift from Dr Steven Kunkel (University of\nMichigan). IRF7 (IFN response factor 7)-deficient mice were a\ngift from Dr Gabriel Nunez (University of Michigan). All\nanimals were bred, housed and used on-site under specific\npathogen-free conditions in strict accordance with guidelines\nset by the National Institutes of Health and protocols\napproved by the University Committee on the Use and Care\nof Animals. Mice were housed on a 10 h light/14 h dark cycle\nin ventilated cages containing not more than five animals per\ncage. Food and water were available ad libitum.\nInduction of experimental viral encephalitis and\nother animal manipulations\nTo induce encephalomyelitis, 5\u00ad6-week-old mice were\nanaesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories) and\nof PBS were inoculated directly into the right cerebral\nhemisphere of each animal. Some infected mice received\n0.25 ml of clodronate liposomes intraperitoneally on days\n1\u00ad5 post-infection to deplete circulating monocytes as\ndescribed (King et al., 2009). Clodronate liposomes and PBS\nliposomes were both gifts from Roche Diagnostics. In other\ninfected cohorts, mice were injected with 0.5 mg of RB6\n(anti-Gr-1) or a control IgG on days 1, 3 and 5 post-infection\nto deplete circulating neutrophils as described (Carlson et al.,\nwere both gifts from Dr Benjamin Segal (University of\nMichigan). Most cohorts of infected mice were monitored\ndaily for survival in accordance with approved animal\nprotocols. Some groups of animals were killed at defined\nintervals post-infection to collect brain and spinal cord tissue\nfor further analysis. Following intra-cardiac perfusion with\nice-cold PBS, the left cerebral hemisphere and the lower half\nof the spinal cord were isolated from some animals, snap-\nfrozen on dry ice and stored at 280\u00b0C for virus titration\nassays (see below). Remaining brain and spinal cord tissues\nfrom these mice were frozen at 280\u00b0C and used to generate\nN.

In other groups,\nPBS-perfused CNS tissue was used to isolated mononuclear\ncells for flow cytometric analysis (see below).\nVirus titration assays\nTen percent (w/v) homogenates of each tissue sample were\nprepared in PBS, and serial 10-fold dilutions of each\nhomogenate were assayed for plaque formation on mono-\nlayers of BHK-21 cells, as previously described (Irani and\nProw, 2007). The results are presented as the geometric\nmeans\u00a1S.E.M. of the log10\nnumber of pfu per gram of tissue\nderived from a minimum of three animals at each time point.\nCytokine and chemokine assays\nFrozen tissue samples were thawed, minced and homogenized in\n0.5 ml of PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail and an\nRNase inhibitor (Sigma\u00adAldrich). After homogenates were\ncentrifuged to pellet all remaining tissue debris, total protein\ncontent was measured in each extract and supernatants were\ndiluted in PBS to a normalized total protein concentration.\nMicroglial culture supernatants were used undiluted in these\nassays without further manipulation. Levels of individual\ncytokines and chemokines were measured directly in samples\nusing commercial sandwich ELISA kits according to the\nmanufacturers' instructions. The results for tissue samples reflect\nthe means\u00a1S.E.M. of pg of chemokine/mg of tissue extracted\nprotein derived from a minimum of three animals at each time\npoint, while for culture supernatants reflect the means\u00a1S.E.M.\npg of chemokine/ml of culture supernatant derived from triplicate\ncell culture wells. Quantification of TNFa (tumour necrosis factor\na), IL (interleukin)-12p40, and CCL (CC motif ligand) 2 levels was\nperformed using mouse OptEIA kits (BD Biosciences). IFNa, CCL3,\nCCL5 and CXCL13 (C-X-C motif ligand 13) levels were measured\nusing Duoset mouse ELISA kits (R&D Systems). The lower limit of\ndetection for all these assays was 5 pg/ml.\nAnalysis and separation of CNS-infiltrating\nimmune cell populations by flow cytometry\nPerfused brains and/or spinal cords were minced into small\nfragments and pressed through a 70-mM mesh sieve into\nHBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution) containing 10% FBS\n(fetal bovine serum) before digestion with collagenase\n(0.2 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemicals) and DNase (28\nunits/ml; Sigma\u00adAldrich) for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. Mononuclear\ncells were then isolated over a 30%/70% Percoll gradient (GE\nHealthcare Life Sciences) and washed with HBSS. All cells\nwere resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS and stained with\nfluorescently conjugated primary antibodies followed by flow\ncytometric analysis on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD\nBiosciences). To quantify individual cell populations, cell\nsuspensions were stained with antibodies against CD3, CD4,\nminimum of 10000 events within a defined forward and side\nscatter gate containing all CD45+ cells were analysed to\ndetermine the proportion of each cell type in each\nexperimental sample. The total number of each cell\npopulation present in individual brain or spinal cord speci-\nmens was then calculated by multiplying the total number of\ngradient-isolated cells from each sample (counted on a\nhaemocytometer) by the proportion of cells labelled with\neach antibody. The results presented reflect the absolute\nnumbers of cells collected from a minimum of three animals\nat each experimental time point. For intracellular cytokine\nstaining, CNS mononuclear cells were cultured for 5 h in\n20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate, 1 mg/ml ionomycin and 5\nmg/ml brefeldin A, fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/\nCytoperm kit (BD Biosciences), and stained with directly\nconjugated anti-CD4, anti-IFN-c and anti-IL-17 antibodies\n(eBiosciences). For cell sorting, CNS myeloid cells were stained\nwith a combination of CD45 and CD11b, and then separated\nusing a MoFlo XDP High-Speed Cell Sorter (Beckman-\nCoulter). Individual cell populations pooled from 10 animals\nwere stored at 220\u00b0C in PrepProtect RNA stabilization\nsolution (Miltenyi Biotec) until RNA isolation was performed.\nqPCR (quantitative PCR) analysis of type-I IFN\nexpression by distinct CNS-derived mononuclear\ncell populations\nLysates of flow sorted myeloid cell populations were thawed\nand carefully removed from the PrepProtect solution. Total\nCD11b+ cells pooled from the brains of ten nai\n\u00a8ve or NSV-\ninfected mice using QIAshredder Kit and the RNeasy Mini Kit\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNA\nwas then generated using the SuperScriptH III First Strand\nSynthesis System for reverse transcriptase\u00adPCR (Invitrogen).\nqPCR was undertaken to measure ifnb1 mRNA transcripts\nusing the MyiQ Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System\n(Bio-Rad) and the ifnb1 primer/probe set in the TaqManH\nGene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems). Data were\nanalysed using the D/DCt calculation, and the ifnb1 results\nwere normalized to the D/DCt values for b-actin mRNA.\nPreparation and use of primary microglial\ncultures\nPrimary microglia were isolated and cultured from the\ncortices of 2\u00ad3-day-old mice as described (Esen and Kielian,\n2005).

Some experiments were conducted in the\npresence of 20 nM of Baf A1 (bafilomycin A1) (Sigma\u00ad\nAldrich) to prevent the acidification of endosomes and thus\nblocking virus uncoating by inhibiting acid-induced fusion\nof viral envelopes and the endosomal membrane (Jan and\nGriffin, 1999). Pilot studies were performed using UV light-\ninactivated NSV generated by exposing the virus to a\ngermicidal lamp (wavelength5254 nm) at a distance of\n5 cm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Heat inactivation of NSV was\naccomplished by maintaining the pathogen at 60\u00b0C for\n15 min before use. Inactivation of viral infectivity was\nconfirmed via the plaque titration assay described above. At\nthe end of the 24-h microglial treatment period, culture\nsupernatants were collected and stored at 280\u00b0C until\ncytokine and chemokine analyses could be performed by\nELISA assays. Microglial viability was assayed using well-\n2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Prism 5.0 software package (GraphPad Software) was used\nfor all statistical analyses. Differences in survival among\ncohorts of mice were measured using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox)\ntest. Unpaired Student's t test was used to assess differences\nbetween different experimental groups at single time points. A\ntwo-way ANOVA test was applied when comparing different\nexperimental groups over time. In all cases, differences at a\nP,0.05 level were considered significant.\nRESULTS\nEffects of UNC93b1 mutation on the course of\nNSV encephalitis in mice\nHumans with germline Unc93b1 mutations were found to\nexhibit endosomal TLR signalling defects and have high\nsusceptibility to HSE even as they mounted more normal\nimmune responses against other viruses (Casrouge et al.,\naffects CNS viral pathogenesis, wild-type and UNC93b1-\nmutant mice were challenged with NSV, a neuroadapted\nmember of the alphavirus family that causes lethal\nencephalomyelitis in rodents and is closely akin to the\nneurotropic alphaviruses that infect humans. Outcome in this\nmodel is highly dependent on an effective type-I IFN response\nto control early CNS virus replication (Byrnes et al., 2000;\nRyman et al., 2000). In vivo challenge experiments showed\nthat UNC93b1-mutant animals were very susceptible to\ninfection, with significantly accelerated death compared with\nwild-type controls (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, however, this\npoorer outcome was not explained by impaired type-I IFN\nproduction in the CNS (Figures 1B and 1C), or by excessive\nvirus replication in target tissues (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus,\nthe wild-type UNC93b1 protein must regulate some host\nresponse that protects mice from NSV encephalitis via a\nmechanism other than one either directly targeting the\npathogen itself or the main antiviral immune effector.\nCNS host responses in wild-type and UNC93b1-\nmutant mice during NSV encephalitis\nTo investigate the effects of UNC93b1 mutation on CNS host\nresponses elicited during NSV encephalitis, brain and spinal\ncord leucocytes were characterized by flow cytometry.\nQuantification of T-cells and myeloid cells was emphasized,\nsince these populations constitute the bulk of the parenchy-\nmal infiltrate elicited during infection (Moench and Griffin,\nleucocytes isolated from the CNS of infected animals was\nsimilar between UNC93b1-mutant mice and wild-type\ncontrols (Figure 2A). Tissue-infiltrating CD3+ T-cells were\nalso found in comparable numbers between the two hosts\n(Figure 2B), and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets occurred in\nequal proportions (data not shown). Within the CD4+ T-cell\npopulation, cells capable of making IFNc or IL-17 were\ndetected with equivalent frequencies (data not shown). These\ndata would seem to exclude a role for UNC93b1 in T-helper\ncell differentiation in this disease model. Conversely, fewer\nCD11b+ myeloid cells were isolated from both the brains and\nspinal cords of UNC93b1-mutant animals at later stages of\nNSV infection (Figure 2C). These CD11b+ cells were both\nCD45high, likely infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils or\nhighly activated microglia, as well as CD45low, likely microglia\nin a more quiescent state (Figure 2D). Separation of these\ndiscrete CD11b+ populations via flow sorting followed by\nanalysis of the mRNA content via qPCR of cells pooled from\nmultiple animals revealed that both CD45low and CD45high\ncells were important sources of type-I IFN in the CNS during\nthe early stages of infection (Figure 2E). The observed\ndifferences in CD11b+ cell numbers found in the CNS\nsuggest that the accelerated mortality seen in UNC93b1-\nmutant mice could be due to impaired recruitment of a\nprotective myeloid cell population from the periphery.\nAlternatively, the local tissue microglial response to infection\ncould differ in some way other than type-I IFN production\nthat influences overall host survival.\nEffects of CD11b+ monocyte or neutrophil\ndepletion during NSV encephalitis\nSince higher numbers of CNS myeloid cells were asso-\nciated with the improved outcome of wild-type versus\nN.

Flow cytometry\ndemonstrated that CD45high/CD11b+ monocytes had largely\nbeen eliminated from the CNS of clodronate liposome-treated\nanimals compared with controls that received PBS liposomes\non day 6 post-infection (Figures 3A and 3B). Likewise, Ly-6C+\nmonocytes were virtually undetectable in the blood of these\nanimals 24 h after their last clodronate liposome treatment\n(data not shown). Nonetheless, the two cohorts of animals\nshowed no difference in overall disease survival (Figure 3C). In\nthe second set of experiments, wild-type mice were treated\nwith the monoclonal antibody, RB6, used to deplete circulating\nGr-1+ neutrophils in vivo (Carlson et al., 2008; Daley et al.,\n2008). Treatment was highly effective in eliminating the\ndesired population from the CNS on day 6 post-infection\ncompared with animals given a control antibody (Figures 4A\nand 4B), but depletion of these cells also had no effect on\ndisease outcome (Figure 4C). Anti-RB6-treated mice had\nalmost no Ly-6G+ cells present in circulation at the same time\nthat CNS tissues were collected (data not shown). These data\nexclude the involvement of the two main circulating CD45high/\nCD11b+ cell populations in NSV pathogenesis. By extension,\nthey suggest that wild-type UNC93b1 may act through an\nendogenous CNS cell-type to slow disease progression.\nFigure 1 Mutation of the ER protein, UNC93b1, alters the pathogenesis of NSV encephalitis in mice\nUNC93b1-mutant animals are more susceptible to fatal NSV infection than wild-type controls (n520 mice per group) (A). This\nheightened disease susceptibility is not associated with altered type-I IFN levels in the brain or spinal cord as measured by ELISA\n(B, C), nor is it due to unrestrained viral replication in either tissue compartment as determined by plaque assay (D, E). Type-I IFN\nlevels and viral titres in these experiments were measured in triplicate CNS samples collected at each time point from a single cohort\nof mice.\nAlphavirus-induced microglial activation\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCytokine and chemokine responses generated by\nUNC93b1-mutant microglia in vitro\nAs microglia express multiple TLRs and become activated early\nduring NSV encephalitis (Irani and Prow, 2007; Prow and\nIrani, 2007), primary cultures of these cells were prepared\nfrom wild-type and UNC93b1-mutant animals for in vitro\nstudy. When directly exposed to NSV at an infectious particle-\nto-cell ratio of 10:1, primary microglia did not become\nproductively infected or show any loss of cell viability over a\n24-h culture interval (data not shown). Still, both NSV and\nvarious synthetic TLR ligands triggered a broad range of\ninflammatory mediators in wild-type cells. This included\nproduction of a subset of pro-inflammatory cytokines\n(Figures 5A and 5B), type-I IFN (Figure 5C) and multiple\nchemokines (Figure 6). Since many of these mediators are\ninduced in the CNS during NSV encephalitis in vivo\nmay be important early integrators of the host response to\ninfection.\nFigure 2 Analysis of CNS infiltrates in wild-type and UNC93b1-mutant mice during NSV encephalitis by flow cytometry and qPCR\nAlthough the total numbers of CD45+ leucocytes (A) and CD3+ T-cells (B) present in brain and spinal cord are comparable between\nthese two hosts during NSV infection, fewer CD11b+ myeloid cells accumulate at both CNS sites over time in UNC93b1-mutant mice\n(C). Tissue cell numbers were determined as described in Materials and Methods section in a single cohort of mice using samples\ncollected from three animals at each time point. By flow cytometry, these CD11b+ cells in the brains of wild-type mice on day 6\npost-infection include both CD45high and CD45low populations (D). Flow sorting of these individual cell populations pooled from\nbrains of nai\n\u00a8ve or day 3 post-infection mice shows that both CD45low/CD11b+ and CD45high/CD11b+ cells contain type-I IFN mRNA\nby qPCR analysis (E).

LPS, a TLR4 ligand that acts at the cell\nsurface rather than in endosomes, stimulated equivalent\nproduction of all mediators in both cell types (Figures 5 and\n6). IFNa and various CC chemokine ligands were also\ngenerated at similar levels by cells of both genotypes in\nresponse to NSV or poly(I:C) (Figures 5C, 6A and 6C),\nalthough virus-induced production of CXCL13 was signifi-\ncantly reduced in mutant versus wild-type cells (Figure 6D).\nIn addition to being a known TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C) also\ntriggers the cytoplasmic RNA sensor, MDA5 (melanoma-\ndifferentiation-associated gene 5) (Kato et al., 2006). The\nactivation of this pathway could explain why both poly(I:C)\nand NSV still provoked certain responses in UNC93b1-mutant\ncells. Nonetheless, these data show that NSV induces the\nproduction of a broad range of inflammatory mediators by\nprimary microglia and that such responses are activated\nthrough non-overlapping pathways, only some of which are\ntriggered by the endosomal TLRs.\nViral determinants that activate microglial\ncytokine and chemokine production\nPilot assays showed that NSV particles exposed to heat or UV\nlight did not trigger microglial cytokine or chemokine\nproduction (data not shown). This suggests that damage to\nthe viral genome prevents its recognition by these cells.\nAt the onset of the alphavirus replication cycle, receptor-\nmediated endocytosis brings the virus into early endosomes\nwhere exposure to an acidic pH induces conformational changes\nthat allow fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal\nmembrane and delivery of the single-stranded viral RNA\ngenome into the cytoplasm (Strauss and Strauss, 1994). Since\nneurons can detect and respond to NSV at the time of cell entry\n(Jan and Griffin, 1999), we tested whether blockade of viral\nfusion had any effect on microglial cytokine and chemokine\nproduction. Baf A1, a selective inhibitor of the vacuolar proton-\nATPase (Drose and Altendorf, 1997), blocks endosomal acidifica-\ntion and prevents NSV from uncoating in neuronal cells (Jan and\nGriffin, 1999). We found that wild-type microglia pretreated for\n30 min with 20 nM Baf A1 prior to virus exposure were\nsignificantly impaired in their capacity to generate IL-12p40,\nIFNa and several CC chemokine ligands compared with\nuntreated control cells (Figure 7). Drug treatment had no effect\non cell viability or on the capacity of microglia to trigger IFNa\nproduction in response to poly(I:C) (data not shown). We\nconclude that NSV must uncoat itself in primary microglia in\norder to trigger innate immune signalling. This suggests that\nintact viral nucleic acids, rather than viral envelope glycopro-\nteins, are the main stimuli that activate these cells.\nUnfortunately, any subsequent requirement for endosomal\nversus cytosolic signalling pathways cannot be inferred from\nthese data since all events downstream of virus entry are\nblocked in Baf A1-treated cells.\nDownstream signalling intermediates involved in\nthe microglial response to NSV\nTo further understand how various microglial PRRs signal in\nresponse to NSV, cells derived from other mutant animals\nwere examined. All TLR signalling pathways except ones\ndownstream of TLR3 converge on the common intracellular\nTLRs and the cytoplasmic RLRs (retinoic acid-inducible gene\nI-like receptors) also activate the IRFs, particularly IRF3 and\nFigure 5 In vitro cytokine production by primary microglia cultures\nderived from either wild-type or UNC93b1-mutant mice\nCultures were prepared as outlined in Materials and Methods section.

We\nfound that virus-induced production of IL-12p40 was fully\nablated in primary microglia derived from MyD88-deficient\nhosts (Figure 8A). Since this defect was also observed in\nUNC93b1-mutant cells (Figure 5A), it is likely that TLR7 and/or\nTLR9 signalling stimulate release of this particular mediator in\nresponse to NSV. The production of IFNa, on the other hand,\ndepended entirely on IRF7 activation (Figure 8B), which could\nbe induced via upstream TLR3 and/or RLR activation. However,\nbecause TLR3-deficient cells generated significant levels of\nIFNa in response to both NSV and poly(I:C) (Figure 8C),\ncytoplasmic RLR pathways such as those triggered by MDA5\nare presumably involved. Virus-induced production of CCL2 by\nmicroglia was partially MyD88-dependent (Figure 8D). Since\nits release was unaffected in UNC93b1-mutant cells exposed to\nNSV (Figure 6A), signals delivered by a non-endosomal TLR as\nwell as some non-TLR pathway must both be involved in the\ninduction of this mediator. Finally, NSV actually triggered\naugmented production of CXCL13 in the absence of IRF7\n(Figure 8E), suggesting that type-I IFN might negatively\nregulate this chemokine. Overall, these data confirm that\nmultiple PRRs and downstream signalling pathways drive the\nbreadth of cytokine and chemokine production by primary\nmicroglia in response to NSV (Table 1).\nImpact of specific PRR signalling defects on the\noutcome of NSV encephalitis\nGiven both the redundancy and breadth of virus-induced PRR\nactivation in cultured microglial cells, involvement of these\nsignalling intermediates during NSV encephalitis was exam-\nined in vivo. As was observed in UNC93b1-mutant mice\n(Figure 1A), IRF7-deficient animals were highly susceptible to\nfatal NSV infection (Figure 9A). In this case, however, CNS\nvirus replication was poorly controlled; upwards of 100-fold\nmore infectious NSV was found in the brains and spinal cords\nof mutants compared with wild-type animals (Figures 9B\nand 9C). These IRF7-deficient mice failed to generate any\nmeasurable amount of type-I IFN in the CNS over the course\nof infection (data not shown). In contrast, the survival of\nboth MyD88- and TLR3-deficient mice was not significantly\ndifferent from wild-type controls (Figures 9D and 9E), and\nneither of these mutant hosts showed any defect in type-I\nIFN production within the CNS over the course of NSV\ninfection (Figure 9F). These findings reinforce the importance\nof type-I IFN for the control of NSV replication and host\nsurvival, as previously reported during infections caused by\nless virulent viral strains (Byrnes et al., 2000). Although it is\npossible that TLR3- and MyD88-dependent responses fully\ncompensate for one another during NSV infection, our in\nvitro data strongly implicate the actions of a non-TLR-\ndependent pathway in the type-I IFN response (Figures 5C\nand 8C). This suggests that TLR-dependent responses do not\ncontribute to disease outcome, and by extension, that the\nwild-type UNC93b1 protein confers protection via some\nmechanism independent of endosomal TLR signalling.\nDISCUSSION\nAlphaviruses infect neurons of the brain and spinal cord,\nand neuronal survival controls in vivo outcome in acute\nonly can these pathogens directly kill the target cells they\ninfect, but they also provoke substantial bystander damage to\nuninfected neurons (Havert et al., 2000; Nargi-Aizenman\nbystander neuronal damage greatly reduces NSV-induced\nmortality without affecting CNS viral replication or clearance\nresponses arising from activated microglia trigger changes in\nadjacent astrocytes that drive this bystander neuronal injury\nresponse, however, causes unrestrained CNS virus replication\nearly in disease that is rapidly lethal to the host (Byrnes et al.,\n2000). Thus, early activation of innate immunity is crucial in\nalphavirus pathogenesis. We sought to identify the signalling\nreceptors triggering microglial production of type-I IFN\nand other inflammatory mediators that influence disease\noutcome. Our data show that NSV activates microglia via\nmultiple PRRs, that these cells are an important source\nof type-I IFN in the CNS during early stages of disease, that\ntype-I IFN production occurs independent of TLR signalling\nand that the ER protein, UNC93b1, plays an unexpected and\nstill poorly understood protective role during infection.\nAlthough other investigators have shown that RNA viruses\ncan trigger microglia to produce inflammatory cytokines\n(Olson and Miller, 2004), our studies reveal a previously\nunreported breadth and complexity of this response. Not only\ndo microglia make a wide range of cytokines and chemokines\nfollowing exposure to NSV, but it is clear that such responses\nare driven by non-overlapping signalling pathways activated\nrequired for generating certain pro-inflammatory cytokines\nendosomal pathway utilizing TLR7 and/or TLR9 is involved.\nThe CC ligand chemokine responses, on the other hand, occur\nindependently of UNC93b1 and are only partially dependent\non MyD88 (Figures 6A\u00ad6C and 8D), demonstrating that signals\ndelivered by a non-endosomal TLR and some non-TLR pathways\nand 8E), but this chemokine is also negatively regulated via an\nIRF7-dependent mechanism (Figure 8E). Most importantly,\nproduction of type-I IFN absolutely requires IRF7 and is not\nactivated by any of the classical endosomal TLRs (Figures 5C,\n8B and 8C). This complexity presents opportunities to subvert\nan individual pathway for therapeutic purposes during\ninfection. In particular, interventions that target the pro-\ninflammatory cascades resulting in bystander neuronal injury\nmight be feasible without disrupting the type-I IFN response.\nN.

IFNa/b receptor null mice\nare highly susceptible to a number of viruses, including the\nmosquito-borne alphaviruses (Muller et al., 1994; Huang\ntype SV is strongly inhibited by IFNa in vitro (Depres et al.,\n1996), and SV encephalitis generates large amounts of type-I\nIFN within the CNS in vivo (Vilcek, 1964; Sherman and Griffin,\n1990). Mice deficient in the IFNa/b receptor rapidly succumb\nto attenuated strains of SV; direct intracerebral inoculation\nresults in uncontrolled CNS virus replication and death that\nnormal mice survive (Byrnes et al., 2000), while systemic\nchallenge causes fatal disease with expanded tissue tropism\nand high peripheral and CNS tissue viral titres not seen in\nreceptor-sufficient hosts (Byrnes et al., 2000; Ryman et al.,\n2000). Our data show that for the virulent NSV strain, the\ntype-I IFN response within the CNS is triggered via TLR-\nindependent pathways (Figures 8B, 8C and 9F). Furthermore,\nearly type-I IFN production arises from both microglia and\ninfiltrating myeloid cells (Figure 2E), and is highly IRF7-\ndependent (Figure 8B and data not shown). Mice incapable of\nmaking type-I IFN have high lethality and uncontrolled CNS\nvirus replication following NSV challenge (Figures 9A\u00ad9C).\nFigure 8 In vitro chemokine production by primary microglia cultures derived from either wild-type, MyD88-, IRF7- or TLR3-deficient\nmice following exposure to either NSV (A, B, D, E) or NSV or poly(I:C) (C)\nCultures were prepared as outlined in Materials and Methods section.

Cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured by ELISA in culture supernatants\n24 h later using ELISA-specific for IL-12p40 (A), IFN-a (B, C), CCL2 (D) and CXCL13 (E). The production of these mediators was\nmeasured using primary cells prepared on two separate occasions.\nTable 1 NSV triggers the production of inflammatory mediators in primary microglia via multiple non-overlapping signalling pathways\n* Inhibitory.\nAlphavirus-induced microglial activation\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nSince expression of IRF7 is restricted to haematopoietic cells\nand can be induced by various external stimuli (Ning et al.,\n2011), it is possible that the early type-I IFN response could\nbe augmented by manipulating IRF7 levels. Our findings shed\nimportant light on this critical antiviral host defence pathway\nduring alphavirus encephalitis.\nBecause of their capacity to detect common DNA and RNA\nreplication intermediates of many viral pathogens, the\nendosomal TLRs are considered central to innate host defence\nagainst viral infections. Recently, a point mutation of the ER\nchaperone protein, UNC93b1, was found to ablate TLR3, TLR7\nand TLR9 signalling in mice because the mutant protein fails\nto transfer the receptors from the ER to their natural location\nKim et al., 2008). Macrophages from these mice have\nprofoundly impaired cytokine responses, including type-I\nIFN production, when exposed to synthetic ligands that\nactivate the endosomal TLRs (Tabeta et al., 2006; Brinkmann\net al., 2007). Such animals are also highly susceptible to viral\npathogens such as murine CMV (cytomegalovirus) due to\nuncontrolled systemic virus replication (Tabeta et al., 2006).\nTogether, these data suggested that UNC93b1-mutant mice\nshould be highly susceptible to NSV challenge because of\ntheir impaired host response to infection. Although enhanced\ndisease susceptibility proved to be true, mutant animals\nmounted a surprisingly normal type-I IFN response and fully\ncontrolled NSV replication in the CNS (Figure 1). We have not\nyet identified a mechanism through which the wild-type\nUNC93b1 protein prolongs survival in this disease. Looking at\nother models, however, animals carrying this mutation have a\nFigure 9 Pathogenesis of NSV encephalitis in IRF7-, MyD88- and TLR3-deficient mice\nIRF7-deficient mice are highly susceptible to fatal NSV infection compared with wild-type controls (n510 per group) (A). This\nheightened disease susceptibility is associated with unrestrained viral replication in the brain (B, P50.0009 by two-way ANOVA) and\nspinal cord (C, P50.0002 by two-way ANOVA). Neither MyD88- nor TLR3-deficient mice show altered disease susceptibility\ncompared with wild-type controls (n512 per group) (D, E). Both MyD88- and TLR3-deficient hosts generate equivalent levels of\ntype-I IFN in the CNS over the course of infection compared with wild-type controls (F).\nN.

On the other hand,\nUNC93b1-mutant mice were recently found to have\nunrestrained parasite replication during experimental\nToxoplasma gondii infection fully independent of their TLR\nsignalling defects (Melo et al., 2010). These data, in\nconjunction with our findings, reveal that this chaperone\nprotein serves some critical TLR-independent function in the\nsetting of intracellular infection.\nAnother notable result among the data reported here is the\napparent role of IRF7 in dampening microglial production of\nthe lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13 (Figure 8E). This finding\nsuggests that type-I IFNs act in either an autocrine or\nparacrine manner to negatively regulate the generation of\nthis mediator within the CNS. Under normal circumstances\nCXCL13 helps form germinal centres in lymphoid organs\nbut its ectopic expression has been reported around B-cell\naggregates that develop in the inflamed meninges of mice\nwith EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and\nPerivascular mononuclear cells and parenchymal microglia\nwithin active multiple sclerosis plaques also express CXCL13\n(Krumbholz et al., 2006), and cerebrospinal fluid levels of the\nprotein are elevated in samples from patients with the RRMS\n(relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis) and decline\nwith successful therapy (Sellebjerg et al., 2009; Piccio et al.,\nproduction of CXCL13 is pathogenic during EAE by sustaining\nmyelin-specific CD4+ T-cell responses, and in vivo neutral-\nization of CXCL13 ameliorates disease (Bagaeva et al., 2006).\nSince subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of IFNb\nhas been convincingly shown to reduce relapse rate, disability\nprogression and the formation of new brain and spinal cord\nlesions in patients with RRMS (The IFNB Multiple Sclerosis\nStudy Group, 1993; UBC MS/MRI Study Group and The IFNB\nMultiple Sclerosis Study Group, 1993; The Multiple Sclerosis\nCollaborative Research Group, 1996; Prevention of Relapses\nand Disability by IFNb1a Subcutaneously in Multiple Sclerosis\nStudy Group, 1998; The Multiple Sclerosis Collaborative\nproduction may be an explanation for its mechanism of\naction in this complex neuroinflammatory disease. Further\nstudies are underway to address this important question.\nIn summary, data presented here show that microglial\nactivation in response to a neurotropic alphavirus is a\ncomplex process involving multiple, non-overlapping PRRs.\nAlthough endosomal TLR, non-endosomal TLR and non-TLR\npathways all contribute to virus-induced cytokine and\nchemokine production by these cells, the type-I IFN response\nis activated in a TLR-independent manner. Microglia are an\nimportant source of type-I IFNs within the CNS during the\ninitial stages of infection, and this response is critical for both\nearly control of virus replication within the target tissue and\nsubsequent host survival. Recent studies show that activated\nmicroglia trigger a cascade of cellular events, including\ndisruption of the homoeostatic support provided by astro-\ncytes that augment neuronal injury during NSV encephalo-\nselectively target such pro-inflammatory mediators by means\nof disrupting the receptors and pathways that activate them,\nwithout impacting the type-I IFN response, raises hope that\nmore precisely targeted immunotherapies can be developed\nfor these life threatening human infections.\n"
