This dispropor-\ntionate representation of racial and ethnic minorities remains a source of\nmajor concern, largely because it suggests the possibility of discrimination in\nthe criminal justice system (Blumstein, 1982). Given the value we place on\nequal treatment under the law (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997) and our increasing\nunderstanding of the potentially deleterious effects of incarceration on family\ntion in a representative democracy (Uggen & Manza, 2002), it is critical that\nthe overrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in the criminal justice system\nnot be further exacerbated by legal decision-making that unfairly disadvan-\ntages racial and ethnic minorities vis-\u00e0-vis other racial-ethnic groups.\nOver the last three decades, state and federal legislatures have enacted\nsentencing guidelines designed to reduce the discretion of legal agents in order\nto assure that persons with comparable criminal records convicted of the same\ncriminal charges receive similar sentences under the law (Tonry, 1996). Central\nto these guidelines is the notion that defendant characteristics such as race and\nethnicity are considered extralegal factors that should not be considered at the\nsentencing stage. However, even with sentencing guidelines in place, extralegal\ndisparities appear not to have been eliminated (Everett & Wojtkiewicz, 2002).\nAlthough a great deal of research has examined the impact of race and gender\non sentencing outcomes (see, for a review, Chiricos & Crawford, 1995; Daly &\nBordt, 1995; Spohn 2000), fewer studies focus on the influence of ethnicity (e.g.,\nMotivans, 2000) at the sentencing stage. Furthermore, only recently have\nresearchers empirically examined the possible joint effects of multiple status\ncharacteristics on court decisions (e.g., Spohn & Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier,\nIn the present study, we use data compiled by the United States Sentencing\nCommission (USSC) to examine the independent and joint effects of race/ethnic-\nity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length decisions in U.S.\nfederal courts. In particular, we focus on the treatment of Hispanic defendants\nrelative to black and white defendants. Considering that Hispanics (of all races)\nnow comprise the largest racial-ethnic minority group in the USA (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2000), there is a relative paucity of sentencing research that examines\nthe outcomes of Hispanic defendants, especially when compared to the sizeable\nliterature on black\u00adwhite differences. On theoretical grounds, there are reasons\nto believe that Hispanic defendants may be treated more harshly than white and\neven black defendants at the sentencing stage. Hispanics face many of the same\nsocial and structural disadvantages as blacks (e.g., poverty, unemployment,\ncrime, discrimination) as well as additional burdens, such as language barriers\nand concerns surrounding citizenship and cultural values, which might have\nThe federal sentencing data are ideally suited for such an analysis because:\n(1) they contain more detailed legal, extralegal, and contextual information\nthan is often available in state court data sets enabling a more robust test of the\nexistence of extralegal disparities, (2) the large data set provides sufficient\nnumbers of cases to perform a rigorous analysis of all defendant subgroups--in\nparticular, the data include a large number of Hispanic and female defendants\nwho are often excluded because of small sample sizes, and also (3) prior studies\nexamining the joint effects of defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes\ncourts (e.g., Pennsylvania) where sentencing guidelines may be more flexible\nthan in federal courts and judges may not be as insulated from community and\npolitical forces as their federal counterparts (see discussion in Steffensmeier &\nDemuth, 2001). The analysis of multiple, combined extralegal disparities in the\nfederal courts undertaken in the present study provides insight into the potential\ninfluence of multiple defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes under a\nrelatively more restrictive guideline system than has been previously examined.\nPrior Research\nThere is a substantial amount of variability in sentences given to convicted\noffenders. Prior research demonstrates that differences in legally relevant case\ncharacteristics such as offense severity, criminal history, multiple charges, and\nmode of conviction (i.e., guilty plea versus trial) account for the bulk of this\nmore, jurisdictional differences in the law, as well as differences in the structural\norganization and cultural norms of courtroom communities and workgroups,\ncontribute to some of the variation in sentencing outcomes across similarly\naccount these legal and contextual factors, there is evidence that sentencing\ndecisions are also influenced by extralegal factors, including the defendant's\nrace/ethnicity, gender, and age (Spohn, 2002).\nRace/Ethnicity Effects\nThe primary focus of past sentencing disparity research has been on differences\nin the outcomes of black and white defendants. In a review of past race and\n(state court) sentencing studies, Chiricos and Crawford (1995) concluded \"race\nis a consistent and frequently significant disadvantage for blacks when in/out\ndecisions are concerned\" (p. 297). They report no consistent black disadvantage\nregarding sentence length decisions. More recent studies of black\u00adwhite\nsentencing differences in state and federal courts also find that black defen-\ndants tend to receive harsher sentences than similarly situated white defen-\nimportant to note that there are some studies that find no main effects of race\nUnfortunately, we know much less about how Hispanic ethnicity influences\ncriminal justice decision-making. Steffensmeier and Demuth (2000) show that\nwhite defendants are least likely to be incarcerated in federal court, and they\nreceive shorter sentences than black and especially Hispanic defendants, partic-\nularly in drug cases. Albonetti (1997) also finds that Hispanic and black defendants\nconvicted of federal drug crimes receive more severe sentences than white defen-\ndants and that Hispanic and black defendants benefit less from guideline depar-\ntures than white defendants. Everett and Wojtkiewicz (2002) also show that\nHispanic and black defendants receive more severe sentences than white defen-\ndants in the federal courts after controlling for legally relevant factors.\nGender Effects\nA fairly persistent finding in the sentencing literature is that female defendants\nare treated more leniently than male defendants (Bickle & Peterson, 1991; Daly\nhowever, there are some researchers who report no differences (Kruttschnitt &\nare 2.5 times greater for male offenders than for female offenders after\ncontrolling for legally relevant factors. Research on sentencing in Pennsylvania\nof other factors, has an effect on sentencing outcomes with female defendants\nsentenced less harshly than male defendants. Similarly, Griffin and Wooldredge\n(2006) find that women are sentenced more leniently than men in Ohio courts\nboth before and after recent sentencing reforms (see also Koons-Witt, 2002).\nAge Effects\nMany prior sentencing studies statistically control for the age of the defendant,\nbut few actually make age the focus of their analyses (see, for an exception,\nMotivans, 2000). Overall, the findings suggest that older offenders are\nsentenced more leniently than younger offenders. For instance, Steffensmeier\net al. (1995) find that in Pennsylvania courts older offenders are somewhat less\nlikely to be imprisoned than younger offenders and if imprisoned they receive\nshorter sentence lengths. Yet, because offenders under the age of 21 also\nreceive some leniency in sentence outcomes in relation to offenders in their\nmid-20s, the age-sentencing relationship may not be strictly linear, but curvilin-\near. They conclude that the peak ages for sentencing severity are 21\u00ad27. After\nthis period, severity declines gradually with advancing age (see also Steffens-\nThe Joint Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age\nZatz (1987) argues that the nature of racial and ethnic biases in sentencing has\nchanged over time. As a society that is now more sensitive socially and legally to\nthe equal treatment of different racial/ethnic groups, it is much less likely that\nlarge, uniform differences in the treatment of minority groups in the courts will\nemerge today than in the past. Instead, biases will emerge in more subtle and indi-\nrect ways, some that are detectable as main or direct effects, but others that are\nonly visible through indirect or interaction effects of race/ethnicity with other\nfactors or at certain stages of the criminal justice system (Zatz, 2000; see also\nfor a discussion of the conceptualization of race and ethnicity in studies of crime\ndiscusses the disparate racial impact that may be embedded in our laws (e.g., the\ndifferent punishments for crack and powder cocaine). And, Demuth (2003) notes\nthat while racial/ethnic differences in pretrial detention may not necessarily be\ncaused by racial bias (although there is evidence of this, as well), de facto racial/\nethnic differences may emerge nonetheless due to associated socioeconomic\ndifferences. These disadvantages faced at the pretrial release stage may carry\nAnother way in which race/ethnicity may act to more subtly affect legal\noutcomes is the focus of the present study: the joint impact of race/ethnicity\nwith other status characteristics. Among the small number of studies that exam-\nine the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender or the intersection of race/\nethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing outcomes, there is evidence that joint\neffects are often considerably larger than individual main effects and that they\nalso reveal extralegal disparities that are otherwise hidden when examining only\nSpohn, Welch, and Gruhl (1985) find that black women are sentenced more\nleniently than black men, but receive sentences that are comparable to those of\nwhite men. However, there were an insufficient number of white females in\ntheir analysis to allow for a comparison of white males and white females. Stef-\nfensmeier and Demuth (2006) report the existence of important interactive\neffects of gender and race/ethnicity in the sentencing of criminal defendants in\nlarge urban state courts. They find that racial/ethnic differences exist for men,\nbut not for women. Their findings do not support the traditional view that\nchivalry or leniency in court sanctioning typically bypasses `women of color'\nSteffensmeier et al. (1998) examine the main and interactive effects of race\n(black vs. white), gender, and age on sentencing outcomes in Pennsylvania\ncourts. In addition to finding statistically significant main effects of race,\ngender, and age, they also report several notable extralegal interaction effects.\nFor instance, within-sex comparisons show that the effect of race is stronger for\nmale defendants than for female defendants--i.e., black males are sentenced\nmore harshly than white males, but black females are sentenced only slightly\nmore harshly than white females. Also, age has a greater effect on the sentenc-\ning of males than females. And, race and gender differences are smaller among\nolder defendants and greater among younger defendants. Most importantly,\nyoung black males are sentenced considerably more harshly than any other\ndefendant group.\nSpohn and Holleran (2000) extend the research done by Steffensmeier et al.\n(1998) by looking at the effects of race/ethnicity, age, gender, and employment\nstatus on sentence outcomes in state courts in Chicago, Miami, and Kansas City.\nA general pattern emerges whereby defendants who are male, black or\nHispanic, aged 21\u00ad29, and unemployed are more likely to be incarcerated. Nota-\nbly, the four defendant characteristics interact to produce harsher sentences\nfor certain offenders. Overall, their results are consistent with the findings of\nSteffensmeier et al. (1998), but they note that there are `constellations of char-\nacteristics' other than `young black male' such as Hispanic and unemployed that\nneed to be examined because they may receive especially harsh treatment in\nthe criminal justice system.\nTheoretical Framework and Research Expectations\nLegal decision-making is complex, repetitive, and frequently constrained by\ntime and resources in ways that may produce considerable ambiguity or uncer-\ntainty for arriving at a fully informed decision (Albonetti, 1991; Farrell &\nHolmes, 1991). To reduce uncertainty, decision-makers may rely not only on the\ndefendant's present offense and prior criminal conduct, but also on attributions\nlinked to the defendant's race, gender, age, or other social positions (Steffens-\nlimit the impact of these extralegal factors on sentencing outcomes through the\nuse of sentencing grids, there remains considerable room for extralegal factors\nto influence sentencing decisions within the cells of the sentencing grid as well\nas through the use of departures from the guidelines (Steffensmeier & Demuth,\nThe focal concerns perspective developed by Steffensmeier and colleagues\nfactors such as race/ethnicity, gender, and age might continue to influence\nsentencing decisions despite the implementation of formal guideline systems.\nThey outline three focal concerns that are important to judges and other crimi-\nnal justice actors in reaching sentencing decisions: blameworthiness, protection\nof the community, and practical constraints and consequences. Steffensmeier\nand colleagues argue that defendant status characteristics may influence\nsentencing decisions insofar as stereotypes and behavioral expectations linked\nto these characteristics relate to the focal concerns of legal agents.\nBlameworthiness follows the principle that sentences should depend on the\noffender's culpability and the degree of injury caused. Women are believed to\nbe less dangerous, less blameworthy, less likely to recidivate, and more likely to\ndant's race/ethnicity to notions of dangerousness and recidivism.\nProtection of the community typically focuses on the need to incapacitate\nthe offender or to deter future crime. In recent years, the public's fear of crime\nand especially the crime of young minority men has increased (Anderson, 1995).\nYoung black males in the U.S. are often portrayed in the mass media as hostile,\nbrutal, aggressive, and violent (Majors & Gordon, 1994), and also as deviant,\ndangerous, and dysfunctional (Gibbs, 1988). Hispanic offenders evoke similar\nattributions (Anderson, 1995). In addition, because of the context of Hispanic\nimmigration in the U.S., Hispanic defendants may seem even more culturally\ndissimilar and unpredictable than their black counterparts (Steffensmeier &\nPractical constraints and consequences relate to how sentencing decisions\nimpact the functioning of the criminal justice system as well as the circumstances\nof individual defendants and their families and communities. Young offenders,\nespecially those who are racial minorities, are less likely to be seen as being\nharmed by a prison term (Kramer & Steffensmeier, 1993; Steffensmeier, et al.\n1998). In addition, the court's concern with breaking up families and protecting\nthe innocent may more often apply to women than men (Daly, 1987).\nGuided by the focal concerns framework and the findings of past research on\nstereotypes and sentencing outcomes, we expect to find independent effects of\nrace/ethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing outcomes, as well as larger joint\neffects based on multiple defendant characteristics. For example, we expect\nthat defendants who are young, male, black, or Hispanic will receive harsher\nsentences than those defendants who are older, female, or white. Moreover, we\nexpect that defendants who are young, black or Hispanic, and male will receive\nsentencing outcomes that are disproportionately severe vis-\u00e0-vis other racial/\nethnic-gender-age subgroups.\nData and Methods\nIn the present study, we use data from the 2001 Monitoring of Federal Criminal\nSentences compiled by the USSC. The data include all cases received by the USSC\nwere assessed as constitutional (N = 59,897). These data are especially appropri-\nate for this study as they contain some of the richest and most detailed informa-\ntion available on the processing of cases at the sentencing stage. Indeed, many\nstate-level data sets used in prior studies lack the large number of legal control\nvariables found in the federal guidelines data that enable us to more adequately\nrule out alternative explanations for extralegal effects on sentencing outcomes\nrigidity (i.e., it is more formal and allows for less judicial discretion) of the\nfederal guidelines vis-\u00e0-vis many state guidelines provide a more conservative\ntest of the impact of extralegal factors on sentencing outcomes.\nFor this analysis, we eliminate several defendant groups from the sample.\nFirst, noncitizens are deleted from the analysis (approximately 33% of the\nsample). The federal cases of noncitizens often differ from those of citizens in\nsubstantial ways that make comparisons of sentencing outcomes between them\ndifficult (Demuth, 2002). For example, a large percentage of noncitizen cases\ninvolve immigration offenses that cannot be directly compared to citizen cases.\nFurthermore, because noncitizens can be deported, the sentencing process for\nnoncitizens is often qualitatively different (e.g., its goal is not punishment, per\nse, but rather to expel the defendant from the country) from that of U.S. citi-\nzens. And, case information provided for noncitizens may be incomplete result-\ning in an underestimation of prior criminal history. Most importantly,\nnoncitizens in the data set are overwhelmingly of Hispanic origin. Because the\nfocus of our study is on the treatment of race and ethnicity in the sentencing\nprocess, we do not want to conflate the effects of ethnicity with the effects of\ncitizenship status.\nSecond, defendants under the age of 18 are excluded from the analysis\nbecause their cases are substantively and legally different due to their juvenile\nstatus. Third, defendants who indicate their race/ethnicity as `other' are\ndeleted from the analysis. This is done to better focus the present analysis on\nwhite, black, and Hispanic subgroups. Those claiming `other' as their race/\nethnicity make up approximately 4% of the defendant sample. Fourth, using\nlistwise deletion, all cases with missing information for any variable used in the\nanalysis are deleted. The number of missing values is small and the exclusion of\nthese cases from the analysis does not significantly change the findings. The\nsize of the analytical sample used in the present study is 33,505.\nDependent Variables\nSentencing outcomes are the result of a two-stage decision-making process: the\ndecision to incarcerate and, if incarcerated, the sentence length decision (see, for\ndiscussion, Spohn, 2002). In the present study, we use logistic regression to model\nthe incarceration (in/out) decision. The in/out decision variable is coded dichot-\nomously, with 1 indicating those defendants who receive a prison sentence and 0\nindicating those who receive a non-incarceration sentence (e.g., probation). The\nsentence length decision is modeled using OLS regression and includes only those\ndefendantswhoreceiveaprisonsentence.Sentencelengthisacontinuousvariable\nrepresenting the logged length of the prison sentence in months. Logging sentence\nlength helps to normalize the distribution and taking the antilog of the coefficient\nin the logged sentence length model provides a useful proportional interpretation.\nSentence length is capped at 470 months and is considered life in prison.1\nExtralegal Variables\nThe extralegal variables of interest in the present study are race/ethnicity,\ngender, and age. Race/ethnicity is coded as three dummy variables: white non-\nHispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic of any race. The information provided\nabout the race/ethnicity of the defendant comes from the Presentencing Report\n(PSR) generated by the defendant's probation officer. Defendant gender is a\ndummy variable coded 1 if the defendant is female and 0 if the defendant is male.\nDefendant age is coded consistent with Steffensmeier et al. (1998) as a series of\nand over. The reference groups used for much of the analysis are white, male,\nLegal Variables\nThe federal sentencing data include a number of important legal measures that\naccount for much of the variation in sentencing outcomes across cases. The\nfederal courts operate under a guidelines system in which judges sentence\ndefendants according to prescribed ranges but also may depart from the\nsuggested guidelines range (Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000). Sentence ranges\nare determined using a grid that takes into account the severity of the current\noffense on one axis and the defendant's criminal history on the other. In turn,\nmost prior federal sentencing studies include separate variables for criminal\nhistory and offense severity in their regression analyses (e.g., Albonetti, 1997;\nHowever, Engen and Gainey (2000) argue that a more appropriate strategy for\nmodeling the effects of criminal history and offense severity on sentencing\n1. Many sentencing studies model the sentence length decision including a correction term for\nselection bias stemming from the decision to incarcerate (Berk, 1983). This involves controlling for\nthe \"hazard\" of incarceration (estimated in the in/out model) in the sentence length model. The\nhazard variable represents for each observation the instantaneous probability of being excluded\nfrom the sample conditional upon being in the pool at risk. However, Stolzenberg and Relles (1997)\nand Bushway, Johnson, and Slocum (2007) find that this correction term can often introduce more\nbias into the sentence length model than it eliminates due to high levels of collinearity between the\ncorrection term and other predictors of sentence length. This is especially likely when the predic-\ntors of incarceration are very similar to the predictors of sentence length as in the present study.\nThe highest correlation we uncovered was between the correction term and the measure of\npresumptive guideline sentence length (r = 0.6). Also, Stolzenberg and Relles (1997) argue that a\ncorrection term is often unnecessary when there is a low level of selection. In the current data,\nbecause only 19% of defendants avoid incarceration, it is unlikely that a selection bias will strongly\ninfluence the sentence length findings. For these reasons, we do not include a correction term for\nselection bias in the sentence length model.\noutcomes is to instead include a variable representing the presumptive guideline\nsentence (i.e., the expected sentence prior to any modifications). In essence,\nthe presumptive sentence represents the combined effects of criminal history\nand offense severity in a single measure. Furthermore, Engen and Gainey (2000)\nshow that the presumptive sentence measure actually explains more of the vari-\nation in sentencing outcomes than the sum of the two separate measures. This\nanalytic strategy is also used by the USSC (2004). In the present study, we\ninclude a variable representing the guideline minimum sentence, in months. We\nalso include a measure of criminal history using a variable that ranges from 1 to\n6 and indicates the final criminal history score of the defendant. According to\nUlmer (2000), in a rejoinder to Engen and Gainey, measures of offense severity\nand prior record have important main, curvilinear, and interactive influences on\nin/out and length that cannot be reduced to the effect of presumptive sentence\nmeasures. This suggests that it is statistically and substantively important to\ninclude offense severity and prior record even if one is including a presumptive\nsentence measure. However, Ulmer also points out that including all three\nlegally prescribed variables results in problematic multicollinearity in the OLS\nmodels of sentence length. As a result, an offense severity score variable is not\nincluded in the analysis because it is highly collinear with the guideline minimum\nsentence variable.\nThe federal sentencing statute includes provisions that permit judges to\ndepart from the sentence prescribed by the guidelines.2 The dilemma for agents\nof social control concerns the balance between the principle of uniformity that\ndemands that offenders committing similar crimes receive similar sentences\n(i.e., formal rational law) and individualized justice that tailors sanctions to the\nparticular characteristics and circumstances of individual offenders (i.e.,\nconstitute approximately 35% of all sentences. Downward departures initiated\nby judges make up about 37% of all departure cases and substantial assistance\n(SA) downward departures, which are initiated by prosecutors in cases where\ndefendants provide assistance to the government, comprise about 63% of all\ndeparture cases. SA departures reflect a unique combination of judicial and\nprosecutorial discretion that is less constrained by the Sentencing Commission\nguidelines than regular downward departures. The number of cases involving an\nupward departure total only 0.6% of the overall sample (N = 213), and are\ndeleted from the sample. As a result, defendant's departure status is coded as a\nseries of dummy variables for no departure (reference group), regular down-\nward departure, and SA downward departure.\n2. There is some disagreement among researchers about how to account for departures in the\nmodeling of sentencing outcomes (see Steffensmeier & Demuth, 2000). For example, are departures\na simultaneous part of the sentencing decision, a selection process, or simply a predictor of\nsentences? It has become common practice to treat departures as a predictor and this practice is\nsupported by the USSC in their study on 15 years of sentencing guidelines (2004). Resolving this issue\nis beyond the scope of the present study, but it is noteworthy that controlling for departure status is\nlikely to produce conservative estimates of extralegal disparities.\nCase disposition is a dichotomous variable, which indicates whether the\noffender's case is settled by plea agreement or trial. It is coded 0 for guilty plea\nand 1 for trial. We also include a measure of multiple counts. A dummy variable\nis coded 0 for cases involving a single count and 1 for cases that involve multiple\ncounts. And, prior research suggests that a small portion of the variation in\nsentencing outcomes is explained by court context (Kautt, 2002; Ulmer &\nJohnson, 2004). An examination of jurisdictional differences is important, but\nbeyond the scope of the present study. Nonetheless, we include controls for judi-\ncial district (see also, Albonetti, 1997). A series of dummy variables representing\njudicial districts are included in the models, but are not shown in the tables.\nResults\nIn the first stage of our analysis, we examine the independent effects of race/\nethnicity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length outcomes\nafter controlling for important legal factors and differences across judicial\ndistricts. Second, we investigate whether the effects of race/ethnicity, gender,\nand age on sentencing outcomes are similar or different across racial/ethnic\nand gender groups. Third, we examine the joint effects of race/ethnicity and\nage (e.g., 18\u00ad20-year-old black defendants) on sentencing outcomes separately\nfor male and female defendants. Finally, we compare and contrast the\nsentence outcomes of specific race/ethnic-gender-age-specific defendant\nsubgroups.\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 presents the percentages and means of all variables used in the\nanalyses. The descriptive statistics are partitioned by race/ethnicity and\ngender.\nAmong male defendants, blacks (91%) and Hispanics (89%) are more likely to\nreceive imprisonment than whites (78%). For females, Hispanic (69%) defendants\nare more likely to receive incarceration sentences than black (59%) and white\n(62%) defendants. Of those incarcerated, black defendants receive the longest\nsentence lengths for their respective gender groups (91 and 36 months for males\nand females, respectively). The racial/ethnic sentence length gap is much\nsmaller for females than males; white and Hispanic females receive average\nsentences only 4\u00ad5 months shorter than black females, but white and Hispanic\nmales receive average sentences that are 30\u00ad35 months shorter than black\nmales.\nThe greater punishment of black and Hispanic defendants compared to white\ndefendants may be explained by differences in legally relevant factors between\nthe groups. Black defendants, and black men in particular, tend to have the\nmost extensive criminal histories, the longest presumptive sentences (although\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for female and male defendants by race/ethnicity\nMales Females\nIndependent variables Total White Black Hispanic Total White Black Hispanic\nAge\nDependent variables\nthis does not hold for black women), and are the group least likely to receive\ndownward departures. Hispanic defendants more closely resemble white defen-\ndants on these legal factors, although Hispanics have longer average presump-\ntive sentences than whites. In addition, Hispanics, both male and female, are\nmost apt to receive downward departures, while they are the least likely to\nreceive SA departures.\nIndependent Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age\nTable 2 shows the main effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on in/out and\nsentence length outcomes controlling for important legal factors and judicial\ndistrict. Notably, prior criminal history and guideline minimum are strongly\nassociated with sentencing outcomes and prove to be important statistical\ncontrols (standardized coefficients are available from the authors upon\nrequest). Defendants with more extensive criminal histories, more serious\noffense conduct, and conviction at trial are more likely to receive harsher\nTable 2 Independent effects model--logistic model of in/out and OLS model of logged\nsentence length\nIn/out Ln (length)\nVariable Odds ratio b\nMale1 -- --\nWhite1 -- --\nNo departure1 -- --\n1Represents the reference category.\nNote.

The odds of incarceration are about 33%\nhigher for Hispanic defendants than for white defendants. Female defendants\nare significantly less likely to receive incarceration sentences than male defen-\ndants. The odds of incarceration for female defendants are approximately 42%\nlower than the odds of incarceration for male defendants. Turning to age\neffects, the youngest defendants are the most likely to receive prison\nsentences. The odds of incarceration among defendants ages 60 and over are\nTurning to the sentence length decision, black and Hispanic defendants\nreceive sentences that are about 5% (exp[b]) longer than white defendants.\nFemale defendants receive sentence lengths that are about 25% shorter than\nmale defendants. Consistent with the age-in/out relationship, sentence length\ndecreases with age.

Among men, Hispanic and black defendants are more likely to receive an\nincarceration sentence (odds ratios of 1.49 and 1.16, respectively) than white\ndefendants. However, among women, there are no racial/ethnic differences in\nthe likelihood of incarceration. A similar pattern emerges for sentence length\noutcomes. While black and Hispanic men receive longer sentences than their\nwhite male peers (about 7.5% and 5% longer, respectively), there are no statisti-\ncally significant racial/ethnic differences in sentence length among women.\nHowever, it is notable that similar to men, Hispanic women receive sentences\n3. We also examined whether race/ethnicity, gender, and age effects were offense-specific. It was\ndifficult (if not impossible) to undertake our full analysis for many of the specific offense types\nbecause of the small sample sizes for many of the race-gender-age-specific subgroups. Nonetheless,\nwe explored the data for some general patterns especially in light of prior studies that sometimes\nfind that race effects are larger in drug cases than in nondrug cases. There were an insufficient\nnumber of cases to fully explore the analysis of joint effects even for such a broad category as\n\"drugs.\" However, we did examine the main effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age and found\nsome differences between drug and nondrug cases. Although the gender and age effects were not\nconsiderably different, the race/ethnicity effects were somewhat larger in drug cases than in\nnondrug cases (but, the race effects remained in nondrug cases). It is important that future studies\nexplore the specific locations of extralegal disparity in the federal courts. But, to fully examine\noffense-specific differences is beyond the scope of this study.\nthat are about 5% longer than white women. This finding is not statistically\nsignificant due, in part, to the reduced power of the model, but helps to explain\nthe similar sizes of the white and Hispanic gender gaps in the race/ethnicity-\nspecific sentence length results discussed next.\nTo provide an alternative perspective, we also examine the effect of gender\nin models partitioned by race/ethnicity (left side of the table). We find that the\ngender gap for incarceration decisions is the largest (and similar) for black and\nHispanic defendants and the smallest for white defendants. For black and\nHispanic defendants, the odds of receiving an incarceration sentence (for both\ngroups) are about 50% lower for women than they are for men; for whites, the\nTable 3 Race/ethnicity, gender, and age effects partitioned by race/ethnicity and\ngender\nLogistic models of in/out: odds ratio\nAge group White Black Hispanic Male Female\nMale1 -- -- -- -- --\nWhite1 -- -- -- -- --\nOLS models of Ln (sentence length): b\nAge group White Black Hispanic Male Female\nMale1 -- -- -- -- --\nWhite1 -- -- -- -- --\n1Represents the reference category.\nNote.

Regarding sentence length\noutcomes, the gender gap is largest for black defendants (i.e., women's\nsentences are 36% shorter than men's) and smallest for Hispanic (17%) and white\nNext, we examine the effect of age on sentencing outcomes by race/ethnic-\nity and by gender. Looking first at the effect of age on sentencing outcomes by\ngender (right side of the table), there are few age differences among female\ndefendants for either in/out or sentence length outcomes. The only statistically\nsignificant difference is the lower likelihood of incarceration (odds ratio = 0.37)\namong women ages 60 and over compared to the youngest defendants. For men,\nthe pattern of age differences in the likelihood of incarceration is similar to that\nof women; only the oldest male defendants have a lower odds (odds ratio =\n0.66) of receiving a prison sentence. But, age differences in sentence length\namong men are larger than among women and punishment is more concentrated\namong younger defendants. For instance, male defendants ages 60 and over\nreceive sentences about 17% shorter than the youngest male defendants.\nTurning to the effect of age on incarceration (in/out) outcomes across racial/\nethnic groups (left side of the table), the age pattern for white and black defen-\ndants is very similar. Results indicate that only the oldest defendants are\ntreated more leniently; whites 60 and over and blacks 50 and over are treated\nmore leniently than their younger counterparts. However, among Hispanics a\ndifferent pattern emerges. Not only do the odds of incarceration for Hispanic\ndefendants decline at a younger age (40 years old), but the likelihood of incar-\nceration also drops off more precipitously. Hispanic defendants ages 40 and\nover already have incarceration odds that are about 40% lower than those of\nLooking at sentence length, white and Hispanic defendants more closely\nresemble each other. There are few statistically significant age differences,\nalthough there does appear to be somewhat of an inverted-U shape to the age-\nsentence length profiles of white and Hispanic defendants. Except for the oldest\ndefendants, white and Hispanic defendants ages 18\u00ad20 (i.e., the youngest\ndefendants) receive the shortest sentences, net of controls. Among black defen-\ndants, harsher sentences are heavily concentrated among the youngest defen-\ndants with sentences dropping off sharply with increasing age. The oldest black\ndefendants receive sentences that are about 23% shorter than the youngest\nblack defendants; for whites and Hispanics, the `youngest\u00adoldest' sentence\nlength gaps are considerably smaller (about 7 and 11%, respectively).\nJoint Effects of Race/Ethnicity and Age by Gender\nTables 4 and 5 present the results of analyses that examine the joint effects of\nrace/ethnicity and age on sentence outcomes separately for males and females.\nLooking at the results for males (Table 4), there is a high degree of uniformity in\nsentencing outcomes across most racial/ethnic-age subgroups; however, there\nare some notable pockets of punishment and leniency (Note: the reference\ncategory is white males ages 18\u00ad20 years old). First, young Hispanic defendants\nare the most likely to receive prison sentences. The odds of incarceration for\nHispanic men ages 21\u00ad29 also have a higher likelihood of receiving a prison\nsentence (odds ratio = 1.82). Black men ages 21\u00ad29 are more likely to receive\nprison sentences than the youngest white men (odds ratio = 1.40), as well.\nSecond, only the oldest white male defendants are significantly less likely to\nreceive prison sentences compared to the youngest white male defendants.\nThird, looking at sentence length outcomes, the youngest black men (ages 18\u00ad20\nwhite men ages 18\u00ad20. Similarly, yet less severely than young black men, a\nlonger than the youngest white men.\nTable 5 replicates the above analysis for female defendants and reveals few\nnotable findings (Note: white female defendants ages 18\u00ad20 serve as the\nTable 4 Males: race-age groups--logistic model of in/out and OLS model of Ln (sentence\nlength)\nIn/out Ln (Length)\nVariable Odds ratio b\n1Represents the reference category.\nNote.

First, there are fewer statistical differences among\nfemales than among males; however, this is partly due to the reduced statistical\npower in the regression model examining female defendants. Nonetheless, with\nthe exception of the oldest defendant groups, the sentence outcomes of\nfemales of all ages are not significantly different from the reference category.\nSecond, there are few black-Hispanic-white differences. One notable (although\nnot statistically significant) finding is that young black women who receive an\nincarceration sentence are sentenced to terms about 8% shorter than similarly\naged white women.\nJoint Effects of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Age on Sentencing\nTable 6 displays the incarceration and sentence length outcomes for all racial/\nethnic-age-gender subgroups ranked from most severe to least severe. White\nmale defendants ages 18\u00ad20 are the reference category. Importantly, the results\nreveal the existence of joint effects that are considerably larger than the effect\nTable 5 Females: race-age groups--logistic model of in/out and OLS model of Ln\n(sentence length)\nIn/out Ln (Length)\nVariable Odds ratio b\n1Represents the reference category.\nNote.

All legal, extralegal, and contextual variables are included in the models.\nof any one defendant characteristic and bring to light extralegal disparities that\nare otherwise hidden when examining only additive models. We highlight here\nsome of the important findings.\nFirst, it is readily apparent that the youngest Hispanic and black men receive\nthe harshest sentence outcomes among all defendant subgroups. Young Hispanic\nmen are the most likely to be sent to prison (odds ratio = 1.80 compared to\nyoung white men) and young black men receive the longest prison sentences\n(42% longer than young white men) after taking into account important legal\nand contextual factors. Importantly, racial/ethnic differences are considerably\nlarger among the youngest men than is apparent when examining the average\neffects of race/ethnicity across all defendants (see Table 2). Indeed, analyses\nthat do not consider the joint effects of multiple statuses risk underestimating\nthe influence of race/ethnicity for specific subgroups of defendants.\nSecond, when taking into account multiple defendant statuses, there is\nconsiderable variation in the sentences received by defendants. Comparing the\nmost disparately sentenced groups, the odds are about six times greater that a\nyoung Hispanic male will receive a prison sentence as compared to the oldest\nwhite female defendants. Similarly, the youngest black males (between the\nages of 18 and 20) receive prison sentences that are about 80% longer than black\nfemale defendants in their 50s. It is important to point out that the sample sizes\nfor female defendants ages 60 and over, especially blacks and Hispanics, are\nquite small (n = 30 and 22, respectively). Therefore, comparisons involving\nthese defendant groups should be undertaken with caution.\nThird, although sentence severity rankings for incarceration are higher on\naverage for male defendants (and especially Hispanic male defendants) than\nfemale defendants, there are some exceptions. For instance, Hispanic female\ndefendants ages 18\u00ad20 rank 11th in terms of incarceration sentence severity.\nThat is, they are as likely to receive a prison sentence as similar-aged white\nmales. In contrast, black female defendants appear to receive sentencing\nbenefits that are not as readily available for Hispanic female defendants. All age\ngroups of black female defendants are found at the bottom of the rank ordering.\nA similar relative ordering between Hispanic and black women exists for\nsentence length outcomes. On average, black women receive shorter sentences\nthan Hispanic women after controlling for legal and contextual factors. This is\nparticularly notable given that black men receive the longest sentences overall.\nDiscussion\nThis work contributes to a growing body of research that considers the\ncombined impact of multiple defendant statuses on sentencing outcomes. In\nthis paper, we examine both the independent and joint effects of race/ethnic-\nity, gender, and age on incarceration and sentence length outcomes using\nfederal court data collected by the USSC. Importantly, the data used in the\npresent study are some of the best available for this kind of examination\nbecause they are rich with important legal control variables and contain\nsufficient numbers of female and Hispanic defendants to enable a more robust\nanalysis of defendant subgroup than has been previously performed.\nConsistent with prior research on sentencing, we find that legal factors are\nthe most important predictors of sentencing outcomes; defendants with more\nextensive criminal histories and more serious offense conduct are more likely to\nreceive harsher sentences than those with less extensive criminal histories and\nless serious offense conduct. However, we also determine that, net of legal and\ncontextual controls, race/ethnicity, gender, and age have significant indepen-\ndent effects on sentencing outcomes. Furthermore, when examined in combina-\ntion, the findings reveal that there is a considerable amount of variation in the\nsentencing outcomes of defendants depending on their relative social-structural\nposition in society, and that particularly harsh punishments are focused dispro-\nportionately on select defendant groups.\nMore specifically, our results show that (1) Hispanic defendants and black\ndefendants receive harsher sentences than white defendants, (2) males receive\nharsher sentences than females, (3) younger defendants receive harsher\nsentences than older defendants, (4) race/ethnicity differences in sentencing\nare larger among men than among women, (5) harsher sentences are more\nconcentrated among the young for Hispanic defendants (for in/out) and black\ndefendants (for sentence length) than for white defendants, (6) harsher\nsentences tend to be more concentrated among the young for male defendants\nthan for female defendants, (7) harsher sentences are more concentrated\namong young black and Hispanic defendants for males than for females, and (8)\ndefendants who are young, Hispanic or black, and male receive the harshest\nsentences of all racial/ethnic-gender-age subgroups. Overall, our results from\nthe federal courts are consistent with those of other researchers examining the\nimpact of multiple defendant statuses on sentencing outcomes in state courts\n1998). That is, even in a sentencing system with a relatively rigid set of formal\nguidelines (i.e., compared with many state systems), unexplained extralegal\ndisparities persist and are, in many cases, quite large.\nSeveral findings are particularly noteworthy. First, across all the compari-\nsons, young Hispanic male defendants are the most likely to be sentenced to\nprison and young black male defendants receive the longest sentence lengths.\nApparently, similar to young black males, young Hispanic males also pay an\n\"imprisonment penalty\" at sentencing (see Spohn & Holleran, 2000). In other\nwords, there is a significant interrelationship among race/ethnicity, gender,\nand age that produces substantially harsher sentences for these categories of\ndefendants. Second, although racial/ethnic differences are smaller overall\namong women than among men, it is notable that the youngest Hispanic\nwomen receive sentences that are more similar to those received by male\ndefendants than to other female defendants. In contrast, compared to the\nharsher punishments given to black men vis-\u00e0-vis white men, black women are\ntreated similar to or more leniently than white women. In this sense, Hispanic\ndefendants are more broadly subjected to harsh punishments than black\ndefendants. Third, substantial differences in sentencing outcomes exist when\ncomparisons are made between the most dissimilar groups. For example, the\nodds of incarceration are over six times greater for young Hispanic males than\nfor the oldest female defendants. And, the youngest black males receive\nprison sentences that are 80% longer than similarly situated older black\nfemales.\nThe results of the present study are consistent with the focal concerns perspec-\ntive (Steffensmeier et al. 1998) that argues that legal decision-making is orga-\nnized around concerns of blameworthiness, dangerousness, and other practical\nconstraints. Indeed, the primary determinants of sentencing decisions are the\npast and present criminal behaviors of defendants. However, it is also possible\nthat legal attributions of culpability and criminal risk are influenced by commonly\nheld perceptions of membership in various racial/ethnic, gender, and age groups.\nThat we find unexplained extralegal sources of sentencing disparity is suggestive\nthat stereotypes may be influential and inequalities in the application of the law\nmay occur in court proceedings despite the existence of structured guidelines\ndesigned to avoid such unequal treatment.\nIt is important to emphasize that we are not suggesting that these dispari-\nties necessarily result from a conscious or overt hostility toward certain defen-\ndant groups or that these disparities are even unwarranted. For instance, it is\npossible that the limited time and information available to legal agents at\nsentencing may result in sentencing disparities that unconsciously and uninten-\ntionally disadvantage some defendants relative to others. It is also possible\nthat the disparities uncovered in our analysis are an artifact of model\nmisspecification (e.g., omitted variable bias). That is, we may be lacking rele-\nvant information that, if included in our models, would explain the racial/\nethnic, gender, and age disparities in our models. For example, women may\nbe sentenced more leniently than men because they are, on average, more\nremorseful than men. If we have not adequately controlled for these gender\ndifferences in remorse in our models, then any apparent gender disparity may\nnot be \"real.\" Nonetheless, these data are among the best suited for the anal-\nysis undertaken here.\nOne limitation of this study is that socioeconomic status (SES) information is\nnot included in the analysis. Prior research indicates that social class may play a\nrole at the sentencing stage (e.g., see impact of unemployment, Spohn &\nHolleran, 2000). However, it is not unusual for measures of SES to be absent in\nsentencing studies. In prior years of federal data, over 50% of defendants list\ntheir incomes as $0, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of race/\nethnicity (or gender or age) and social class (see Steffensmeier & Demuth,\n2000). In the data set used in the present study, a variable representing defen-\ndant income is not even available. Being able to differentiate between race/\nethnicity and SES would help us to \"fine tune\" our theoretical explanations, but\nwould not reduce the significance of our findings in that both racial and social\nclass disparities are unwarranted under the guidelines. Future research needs to\nexplore the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities are truly a function of\nracial perceptions versus economic constraints that limit the ability of defen-\ndants to resist legal sanctions. In addition, future research should explore the\nuse of education as a predictor for defendant income/SES to determine if this\nextralegal factor further influences sentencing outcomes.\nA final limitation of the present study is that we only examine the outcomes\nof citizen defendants. Noncitizen defendants are eliminated from the analysis\nbecause information provided for them may be incomplete, and there is often an\nunderestimation of prior criminal history. In addition, the federal cases against\nnoncitizen defendants differ significantly from citizen defendants, which make\ncomparisons of sentencing outcomes difficult. Our understanding of the treat-\nment of Hispanic defendants (which comprise the majority of noncitizens in the\nfederal system) would benefit from the exploration of differences not only\nbetween citizens and noncitizens, but also between illegal aliens and residential\naliens. It is important to examine these differences because of the potential for\nperceptions surrounding ethnic threat and foreign status (i.e., notion of being an\nillegal alien) to influence the treatment of Hispanics, U.S. citizens or not.\nDespite the limitations that we have discussed here, all of the results point in\none direction--to the robust findings that (1) defendants appear to be treated\ndifferently based on race/ethnicity, gender, and age to the detriment of\nHispanic, black, male and young defendants and that (2) the interactive effects\nof race/ethnicity, gender, and age have a larger combined impact than the\nindependent effects such that young black and Hispanic males bear the dispro-\nportionate brunt of sentencing in the federal courts.\nConclusion\nThe analysis of extralegal sentencing disparities in the federal courts under-\ntaken in the present study provides insight into the combined influence of\nmultiple defendant characteristics on sentencing outcomes under a relatively\nmore restrictive guideline system than has been previously examined. Our find-\nings are consistent with those of past studies that demonstrate the importance\nof considering joint effects of race/ethnicity, gender, and age on sentencing\noutcomes and, furthermore, suggest that particularly harsh sentences are\nfocused on a narrow segment of the defendant population--that is, young\nHispanic and black males. The harsher treatment of young male racial/ethnic\nminorities at sentencing is consistent with the focal concerns perspective on\njudicial decision-making and supports the notion that differences in criminal\npunishment are only partially explained by differences in criminal behavior. Not\nonly is there a great deal of variation in the sentencing outcomes of different\nracial/ethnic-gender-age subgroups, but the findings of the present study add\nnew information to a growing body of literature on sentencing that suggests that\nHispanic defendants, like black defendants, may be disadvantaged within state\nand federal court systems.\nAlthough recent investigations have improved our knowledge of the extrale-\ngal, legal, and contextual determinants of sentencing outcomes, our under-\nstanding of the impact of these factors on the broader case process remains\nincomplete. There is still a need to examine the multiple decision-making\nstages that both precede and follow sentencing. For example, future research\nwould benefit from applying the methods used in the present study to the\npretrial release stage and to parole/violation decisions. Furthermore, it is\nimportant that future studies of legal decision-making explore the role of\nunderexamined defendant characteristics such as unemployment, education,\npoverty, and citizenship status. Future research should also take advantage of\nqualitative techniques, such as gathering more detailed interview and observa-\ntional information from judges and other court personnel (e.g., see Smith,\nRodriguez, & Zatz, 2006, for a study on the role of extralegal attributions in\njuvenile court decision-making). This would help us to better understand court\ndecisions, including how information is processed, how extralegal factors might\ninfluence case outcomes, and whether the focal concerns of legal agents\ninfluence decision-making.\n"
