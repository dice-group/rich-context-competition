Mindfulness has been described as an\nawareness that emerges through purposefully paying atten-\ntion to what is taking place in the present moment with a\nnonjudgmental attitude (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The effects of\nmindfulness training through meditation have been investi-\ngated, with results suggesting that it is beneficial to mental\nhealth (e.g., reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and\nstress--Schreiner & Malcolm, 2008). Other researchers have\nfound that mindfulness meditation assisted in weight loss\nobserved that although mindfulness meditation was effective\nin terms of assisting weight loss, the practice was not contin-\nued once weight loss had been achieved. It would appear that\nmindfulness meditation was used in the same way that\nrestrictive diets are used, that is, achievable as a short-term\nsolution for weight loss, but difficult to adhere to in the lon-\nger term. The authors considered that an alternative, event-\nbased and eating-specific mindful method might assist\npeople more effectively in both weight loss and maintenance\nHowever, mindfulness adapted to fit into an eating con-\ntext was described earlier in literature as mindful eating,\nwhich was defined as an association between eating and a\nnonjudgmental awareness of physical and emotional sensa-\ntions (Framson et al., 2009). Present moment attention of\ntaste, texture, and smell, as well as satiety cues and the pres-\nence of thoughts and emotions associated with the eating\nexperience were described as key characteristics of eating\nmindfully. Mindful eating has been associated to lower body\nmass index (BMI; Moor, Scott, & McIntosh, 2013), lower\nservings of energy-dense foods (Beshara, Hutchinson, &\nWilson, 2013), and healthier food choices (Kidd, Graor, &\nMurrock, 2013), which are relevant to obesity prevention\nand applicable to various weight groups. Therefore, in many\nways, the event-based and eating-specific mindful method\nthat was developed by Mantzios and Wilson (2014) assimi-\nlates the definition and characteristics of mindful eating,\nalthough these assumptions lack empirical findings.\nMore specifically, Mantzios and Wilson (2014) combined\nmindfulness with construal-level theory to develop a diary,\n1Birmingham City University, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nMichail Mantzios, Faculty of Business, Law and Social Sciences,\nDepartment of Psychology, Birmingham City University, Room C307, The\nCurzon Building, 4 Cardigan Street, Birmingham B4 7BD, UK.\nEmail: michael.mantzios@bcu.ac.uk\nMindful Construal Diaries: A Less\nAnxious, More Mindful, and More\nSelf-Compassionate Method of Eating\nMisba Hussein1, Helen Egan1, and Michail Mantzios1\n Keywords\nmindfulness, self-compassion, anxiety, mindful concrete construals, mindful eating\n2 SAGE Open\nand found that the use of these mindful construal diaries\n(MCDs) provided similar results in weight loss when com-\npared with a group that used mindfulness meditation for 5\nweeks, and delayed weight regain over meditation at a\n3-month follow-up. Construal-level theory describes an\nidentification on a close or distant continuum (Liberman &\nTrope, 1998). Whereas close objects, events, or individuals\nare represented as concrete, distant objects, events, and indi-\nviduals are portrayed as abstract. Abstract construals con-\nsider \"why\"' actions are being performed, whereas concrete\nconstruals focus on \"how\" they carry out behavior (Freitas,\nsuggested that concrete construals (a) promoted attention to\nthe present behavior and (b) they focus on the how of the cur-\nrent behavior rarely required or prompted further judgment\nor self-critical attitudes, factors that theoretically link mind-\nfulness and self-compassion to concrete construals, and\nmake it a suitable tool for cultivating mindfulness and self-\ncompassion outside the traditional routes of meditation.\nTheir results demonstrated that concrete construal diaries are\nsignificantly more effective in improving mindfulness and\nself-compassion than abstract construal diaries, which served\nthem with justification as to how the diaries can assist weight\nmanagement. Although the diaries have been found to assist\nweight regulation, the specific conduit of the effect, whether\nthey decrease anxiety, depression, or increase mindfulness\nand self-compassion during each meal, are presently\nunknown and warrant further research.\nThree topics are explored in the current study as possible\nmechanisms of aiding weight regulation with the use of\nMCD, namely, mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxiety.\nFirst, the original study used the Mindful Attention and\nAwareness Scale (MAAS), which measures an increase in\npresent moment awareness, but does not explore the non-\njudgmental component of mindfulness. The authors and\ndevelopers of this diary suggested that further research\nshould be conducted with the help of other psychometric\ntools. Therefore, further research incorporating a more holis-\ntic measure of mindfulness was used to observe increases in\nmindfulness, and further explain previous weight regulation\nfindings.\nSecond, previous research suggested that the use of the\nMCD could, over a period of 5 weeks, increase self-compas-\nsion (Mantzios & Wilson, 2014). Self-compassion is\ndescribed as taking a kinder approach to oneself with a mind-\nful awareness and consideration of personal difficulties as\nbeing part of a shared human experience (Neff, 2003). The\ndiary prompted people to be more self-compassionate\nthrough priming, through the inclusion of self-compassion-\nate questions. Adams and Leary (2007) conducted the initial\nresearch, which used priming (i.e., activation of the self-\ncompassionate concept through text that was read to partici-\npants to elicit changes in later behaviors) to increase\nself-compassion. They replicated another original experi-\nment, whereby people who broke their diet increased their\nfood intake afterward (i.e., disinhibition--see Herman &\nMack, 1975), but primed half of their participants to be more\nself-compassionate. They found that those who were induced\nwith a self-compassionate message did not increase their\nfood intake. Therefore, self-compassion can be used as a\ncoping mechanism with personal failings (without overeat-\ning), and in turn, aid in weight regulation.\nThe role of self-compassion has been highlighted in relation\nto mindfulness and eating. For example, research has found that\nparticipation in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)\nprograms increased self-compassion levels, which mediated\nreductions in stress (Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, & Cordova, 2005),\nalthough stress has been found to increase food consumption\n(Greeno &Wing, 1994).While self-compassion may strengthen\nthe effectiveness of mindfulness, further research suggested that\nself-compassion relates to mindful eating (Webb, Jafari,\nSchoenefeld, & Hardin, 2013), intuitive eating (Schoenefeld &\nWebb, 2013), and increasing health behavior intentions (Sirois,\n2015). Therefore, the increase of self-compassion may be a\nhelpful component to assist and support mindfulness, which\nmay further assist weight regulation. As such, recent research\nhas found that interventions combining both mindfulness and\nself-compassion assist people in weight loss more than interven-\ntions involving mindfulness alone (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015a;\nMantzios, Wilson, Linnell, & Morris, 2015). The present study\nfurther investigated whether using the diary in one session\nincreases state levels of self-compassion.\nThird, the possible reduction of anxiety, which is, the ten-\ndency to perceive stressors as threatening, therefore causing\nemotional,cognitive,andphysiologicalreactions(Spielberger,\nGorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), may be another\nmechanism of the success of MCD that merits further\nresearch. Research has demonstrated that an increase in both\nmindfulness and self-compassion has been associated with\nreductions in trait and state anxiety (e.g., Bergen-Cico &\nCheon, 2013), while anxiety has also been found to predict\nweight gain and obesity (Ostrovsky, Swencionis, Wylie-\nRoberts & Duong, 2016). Therefore, the possibility of lower-\ning anxiety through the MCD may further explain positive\nweight-related outcomes.\nThis study significantly differs in three ways from the orig-\ninal research conducted with MCD. First, the present research\nexplores increasing mindfulness and self-compassion, and\ndecreasing anxiety through state scales during a single meal\n(compared with a 5-week intervention). If one session can\ninduce these elements and reduce distress, this would enable\nthe reduction of training and cost in contemporary health care\nto treat and prevent problematic eating and overeating. To\ndate, mindfulness interventions require several weeks or\nmonths of committed practice (e.g., Daubenmier et al., 2011),\nand single intervention sessions have been unsuccessful in\nimproving eating behaviors, although vigorous methodologies\nand higher sample sizes may offer further support for single\nintervention sessions (e.g., Jacobs, Cardaciotto, Block-Lerner,\nHussein et al. 3\n& McMahon, 2013). Second, measuring anxiety may provide\nanother explanation for why the diaries may work given the\npositive relationship to overeating, and the negative relation-\nship to mindfulness and self-compassion explored earlier.\nThird, participants were asked only to consider the questions,\nrather than write them down in their diary. The rationale for\nthis change in methodology was to make the use of such dia-\nries as easy as possible, and to create more of a priming tool.\nThis consideration is more conducive to mindful eating, where\ncommitment to writing in the diaries may be more likely to\ndistract from the actual behavior performed. Previous research\nhas demonstrated that distractions such as watching television\nor socializing can lead to mindless eating behaviors (Ogden\net al., 2013). Overall, this type of engagement with the diary is\nmore user friendly, requires even less effort, and may, there-\nfore, improve the adherence to mindful eating after weight\nloss in future interventions.\nTherefore, the present study explored whether MCD can\nimprove state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state\nanxiety. The following was hypothesized:\nHypothesis 1: The use of the MCD will increase levels of\nstate mindfulness and state self-compassion, and reduce\nstate anxiety.\nMethod\nParticipants\nForty-five students attending a university in Birmingham,\nthe United Kingdom, were invited to participate in the pres-\nent study via email invitations or were approached face to\nface. Three participants did not meet the set BMI (i.e., BMI\n< 18.5), and were excluded from the final analyses. Another\ntwo participants were excluded, one did not complete any\npost questionnaires, whereas another failed to engage with\nthe diary and adhere to the study protocol (i.e., participant\nhad a phone conversation throughout the entire duration of\nthe study, which created a multitasking and mindless con-\ntext). As a result, five participants were excluded in total\nfrom the final analysis. The final sample consisted of 28\n(SD = 2.92 years). The sample consisted of different ethnici-\nties: White British (n = 8), Black (n = 6), Mixed (n = 2),\nIndian (n = 9), Pakistani (n = 13), and Arab (n = 2).\nEligibility. Participants were not eligible to participate if they\nhad been diagnosed with an eating disorder and if they were\nbelow the age of 18.\nInstruments\nParticipant information form. This form asked for participant's\nage, weight, height, gender, and ethnicity, as well as the last\ntime they ate a meal and their smoking/exercising habits.\nState Mindfulness Scale.The State Mindfulness Scale is a\n21-item self-report measure that assesses mindfulness with\nscores ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very well), with total\nThis scale reflects on traditional and contemporary psycho-\nlogical science models of mindfulness. It includes items such\nas I noticed emotions come and go and I felt in contact with\nmy body. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mindful-\nness, and the scale has shown to be stable over time when\ninvestigated in mindfulness interventions, as well as high\nconstruct and predicted criterion validity (Tanay & Bern-\nState Self-Compassion Scale.\nThe State Self-Compassion\nScale is an adapted version of the Neff's (2003) original\nState Self-Compassion Scale with an internal consistency of\nthe statements to the present moment. For example, instead\nof stating \"I'm trying to be kind and reassuring to myself,\"\nthe statement was worded as \"Right now, I am trying to be\nkind and reassuring to myself.\" The scale is composed of six\nsubscales: Self-Kindness, Self-Judgment, Common Human-\nity, Isolation, Mindfulness, and Overidentification. It con-\nsists 16 items and is reworded to reflect a state scale. It\nincludes items such as Right now, I am trying to be under-\nstanding towards myself or It's okay to make mistakes, and\nresponses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly\nagree), with overall scores ranging from 16 to 112 (Breines\nintervention and .758 postintervention.\nState Anxiety Scale.A shortened version of the Spielberger\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch,\n& Lushene, 1970) was used, which consisted of six items to\nmeasure state anxiety. Responses range from 1 (not at all) to\n4 (very much) and overall scores range from 6 to 24, with\nhigher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety (Marteau &\nBekker, 1992). Sample items are I am tense or I feel content.\nIn the current study, the alpha was .836 preintervention and\nMindful concrete construal diary.A diary of questions based on\nconcrete construals, mindful awareness, and self-compassion-\nate messages was given to participants during a mealtime,\nwhich required them to consider how to eat, with questions\nsuch as, \"How does it smell?\" \"How do I show kindness to\nmyself now that I am eating healthily?\" or \"How do you feel\nand what passes through your mind now that you are eating this\nmeal?\" (Mantzios & Wilson, 2014; please see the appendix).\nProcedure\nParticipants either responded to an advertisement of a study\nregarding state psychological dimensions of personality and\n4 SAGE Open\neating behavior or were approached face to face. Participants\nreceived a participant information sheet and those who\nagreed to take part in the study gave informed consent before\nthe start of the experiment. Once informed consent was\ngained, a set of demographic questions and three scales on\nstate mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety\nwere given to participants before their meal. Next, partici-\npants were given a food diary to use during their mealtime\nand were asked to consider the questions in the diary while\neating their own provided meal in the laboratory. To avoid\nany distractions, the experimenter was sitting behind the par-\nticipant during the meal to allow full engagement with the\ndiary and food, and tested one participant at a time. The food\nconsumed varied among participants, as the researcher\ninstructed them not to change or alter their usual eating\nbehaviors and choices. Most participants chose to purchase\ntheir meal while on university grounds, which consisted of a\nsandwich, with or without a small bag of chips, and a soft\ndrink or water. Other participants brought in other foods that\nwere purchased from local supermarkets or homemade\nmeals, such as couscous with roasted vegetables, pasta sal-\nads, pasta with sauce, or different curries with rice. A record\nof food and amounts consumed during the experiment was\nnot kept. Once they considered the questions in the diary and\nfinished their meal, they were then asked to complete another\nset of the state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state\nanxiety scales. The initial advertisement of the study and\ninformation in the participant information sheet about the\ntrue purpose and aim of the study was intentionally left vague\nto prevent participant bias. Therefore, a funneled debriefing\nalso occurred with four questions, beginning with a general\nformat (\"During the process of completing the question-\nnaires, did you notice anything in particular?\") to more spe-\ncific questions (\"If you were to guess, what would you\nassume the aim of this study was?\") to inform the researchers\nwhether or not participants were aware of the aims of the\nstudy. Finally, the participants were debriefed and thanked\nfor their participation. Note that participants volunteered and\ndid not receive any incentives.\nDesign and Statistical Analysis\nThree repeated measures analyses (paired sample t tests)\nwere conducted on pre- and postdiary scores of self-compas-\nsion, mindfulness, and anxiety.\nResults\nThe funneled debriefing procedure indicated that the partici-\npants were not aware of the aims of the study. Three separate\npaired sample t tests were conducted between pre- and post-\nmeasurements on mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxi-\nety. For mindfulness, the paired sample t test showed that\nnificantly increased from pre\u00adstate mindfulness scores (M =\nence between the pre- and posttime conditions was 10.45\nmated population mean differences is between 4.91 and\nFor self-compassion, the paired sample t test showed that\nsignificantly increased from pre\u00adstate self-compassion\nmean difference between the pre- and postconditions was\neffect was moderate (d = 0.48).\nLast, for anxiety, the paired sample t test showed that\npost\u00adstate anxiety scores significantly improved (M = 20.66,\n95% confidence interval for the estimated population mean\n(d = 0.59). Note that controlling for BMI and gender did not\ndiffer the outcomes reported above.\nDiscussion\nThe present study suggests that the mindful concrete con-\nstrual diary intervention increased state mindfulness and\nstate self-compassion and decreased state anxiety. Current\nfindings are significant for three main reasons. First, past\nresearch found that the participants who report greater mind-\nfulness in everyday life have positive eating behaviors and\nhealthier eating practices (Bowlin & Baer, 2012) and are able\nto regulate their weight (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b;\nMantzios, Wilson, Linnell, & Morris, 2015). Mindfulness-\nbased interventions targeting eating behaviors have gained\npopularity in recent years with a specific focus placed upon\nobesity-related behaviors (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b). Such\ninterventions aim to facilitate the repatterning of automatic\nbehavior by encouraging oneself to distinguish between\nemotional arousal and physical hunger cues (Sojcher, Gould-\nHowever, for such interventions to be successful, they\nrequire several weeks or months of sessions (Daubenmier\ncises employing a single intervention session have found to\nbe ineffective in improving eating behaviors (Jacobs et al.,\n2013). This research, although practically different from pre-\nvious studies, has been found to be effective after a single\nsession. Second, this experiment attempted to test the effec-\ntiveness of the diary without writing the answers, but by sim-\nply considering the items. The use of priming has become a\nprevalent method of inducing state psychological dimen-\nsions of personality such as mindfulness and self-compas-\nsion (Leary, Tate, Adams, Batts-Allen, & Hancock, 2007;\nHussein et al. 5\nParticipants are often required to think about items or nega-\ntive events and are then prompted to write, think, or listen to\nmessages in a mindful or self-compassionate manner. For\nexample, when inducing a self-compassionate state to evoke\na common humanity perspective, participants would be\nrequired to write about the event in ways that other people\nwould also experience a similar event (Leary et al., 2007;\nZabelina & Robinson, 2010). The findings from studies uti-\nlizing such methodologies of priming were found to signifi-\ncantly increase levels of self-compassion (Leary et al., 2007;\nZabelina & Robinson, 2010). However, the act of writing\nmay be felt as consciously effortful, and in turn, may not be\nadhered to. A study found that listening to a speech endorsed\nwith components of self-compassion was substantial to\nincrease levels of self-compassion, and in turn, improved\nrestrictive eaters' attitudes toward eating after a preload of\nunhealthy food (Adams & Leary, 2007). Similarly, in the cur-\nrent study, it was found that the simple method of consider-\ning items was sufficient to induce mindfulness and\nself-compassion and to reduce anxiety. This makes the mind-\nful concrete construal diary more user friendly as it requires\nless conscious effort. Not writing and eating may allow the\nparticipants to place a higher focus upon their food, and in\nturn, be more mindful. Research has shown that the act of\nmultitasking may lead to participants' cognitive processes\nbecoming less mindful and more automatic, which partially\nexplains the strict adherence and exclusion of participants in\nthe current study.\nLimitations and Future Direction\nOverall, six limitations have been identified that require fur-\nther research. First, future research should use a compari-\nson/control group, to enhance our understanding of variances\nbetween a diary and nondiary group. Second, the use of stu-\ndents, who tend to be more anxious than the general popula-\ntion (Bayram & Bilgel, 2008), which in turn, may make\nthem less self-compassionate and mindful as a group may be\nproblematic. In addition, the ethnic diversity further limits\nthe generalization of results, especially when considering\nthe variety of foods, at times atypical of Western diets, as\nwell as homemade meals that were consumed during the\nexperiment. However, the food was typical to their everyday\neating behaviors, which adds some ecological validity to the\nclassic laboratory setting that is utilized in these types of\nexperiments. Generalizing and interpreting the current\nresults should occur with caution until further research\nbecomes available.\nThird, the current study did not investigate the amount of\nfood consumed, and therefore, was unable to investigate the\nextent and potential relationship between mindfulness, self-\ncompassion, anxiety, and overeating during the experiments.\nPast research has revealed differences in food intake between\nrestrictive and nonrestrictive eaters in terms of the disinhibi-\ntion effect (i.e., the shame of consuming high caloric food and\nin turn overeating; Herman & Mack, 1975). Self-compassion\nhas in turn shown to mediate the effect of disinhibition among\nhighly restrictive eaters (Adams & Leary, 2007).\nFourth, the majority of the participants within the current\nstudy had a healthy weight, and follow-up research with\noverweight and obese individuals is required. Finally, as the\nparticipants in the current study did not write out answers,\nthey may not have fully adhered to the guidelines of the\nexperiment, in terms of possibly failing to adequately con-\nsider the questions 5 min before the meal or rereading the\nquestions once completing the first set.\nFuture research needs to methodologically control for\nsuch possible nonengagement, to allow for the possibility of\nexclusion from the final analyses of experiments. Keeping a\ntime record would allow for a fuller understanding of the\ninteraction of time taken to complete the meal with other fac-\ntors such as anxiety, mindfulness, and degree of engagement.\nFurthermore, future research investigating the effectiveness\nof the mindful concrete construal diary intervention should\nutilize both restrictive and nonrestrictive eaters, conducting\nthe experiment at similar times and days, and provide a stan-\ndardized meal to each participant recruit members of the\ngeneral population.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the use of an MCD with self-compassionate\nmessages in the present study was significantly effective in\nimproving state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and\nstate anxiety. However, further research is required, experi-\nmental and with populations of a higher weight, given the\nlimitations suggested earlier. Possible explanations of why\nthe diaries work may assist in making recommendations of\nimprovement and effectiveness, which may assist implemen-\ntation of future weight regulation tools in clinical practice.\nAppendix\nMindful Construal Diary (Mantzios & Wilson, 2014)\nPlease try answering the following questions with as much detail as you can, considering emotions and thoughts that come up\nduring the meal.\nSome questions may not relate to the food, but are there for you to consider what you might think or feel during the meal.\nPlease try answering the following questions with as much detail as you can, considering your emotions and thoughts that\ncome up during the meal.\n6 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, C., & Leary, M.
