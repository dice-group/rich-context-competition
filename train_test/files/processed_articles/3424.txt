However, results on\nwhich allele predisposes to disease susceptibility remain controversial in Asian populations. This study was performed\nto evaluate the association of the common ACE I/D gene polymorphism with both T2DM and CVD susceptibility in an\nArab population.\nMethods: We genotyped the ACE I/D polymorphisms by direct allele-specific PCR in 183 healthy controls and 400 CVD\npatients with diabetes (n=204) and without (n=196). Statistical analysis comparing between the different groups were\nconducted using R statistic package \"SNPassoc\".\nResults: Two genetic models were used: the additive and co-dominant models. The I allele was found to be associated\nwith T2DM (OR=1.84, p=0.00009) after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. However, there was no association\nwith CVD susceptibility (p>0.05).\nConclusion: The ACE I allele is found to be associated with T2DM; however, no association was observed with CVD.\nThe inconsistency between studies is suggested to be attributed to genetic diversity due to the existence of sub-\npopulations found in Asian populations.\n",

The prevalence is 40% in groups\naged 40\u00ad59 years old according to a recent report from the\nAmerican Heart Association.1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n(T2DM) is a common risk factor of CVD, with studies\nshowing the risk of CVD higher in patients with T2DM\ncompared with those without.2 It has also been reported\nthat about 50% of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)\npatients have diabetes, with the risk of death of AMI with\ndiabetes 3-fold higher compared with AMI without diabe-\ntes.3 The prevalence of T2DM has increased 30% between\nFederation, Kuwait is ranked third among the top 10\ncountries with highest diabetes prevalence worldwide.2\nThis is alarming, especially considering that the\nAssociation of the insertion allele of the\ncommon ACE gene polymorphism with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus among Kuwaiti\ncardiovascular disease patients\nAhmad Al-Serri1, Fatma G Ismael2, Suzanne A Al-Bustan2\nand Ibrahim Al-Rashdan3\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, diabetes, T2DM, cardiovascular disease, CVD, Kuwait, genetic\npolymorphism\nHuman Genetics Unit, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine,\nKuwait University, Safat, Kuwait\nDepartment of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kuwait\nUniversity, Safat, Kuwait\nDepartment of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat,\nKuwait\nCorresponding author:\nAhmad Al-Serri, Human Genetics Unit, Department of Pathology,\nKuwait.\nEmail: ahmad.alserri@hsc.edu.kw\nOriginal Article\nprevalence of obesity, another well-known risk factor for\nCVD, is 48% in the Kuwaiti population.4\nACE is involved in converting angiotensin I into angioten-\nsin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.5,6 The insertion/deletion (I/D)\nenzyme gene (ACE) is a 287-bp ALU repeat DNA sequence\nfound on intron 16.7 The DD and ID genotypes have been\nassociated with 60% and 30% higher ACE plasma levels\ncompared with the II genotype.7,8 The I/D polymorphism has\nbeen found to be associated with increased risk of CVD9 and\nT2DM;10 however, results are still inconsistent, with studies\nfinding no association11 or an inverse association.12,13 This\nobserved inconsistency seems to be attributed to gene\u00adenvi-\nronment interactions and population differences. Therefore\nwe aimed to investigate the association between the ACE I/D\nand T2DM in patients from Kuwait.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy subjects\nA total of 583 Kuwaiti nationals including both patients\nthey were asked to sign an informed consent for the pur-\npose of the study. The samples were collected from various\nhospitals in Kuwait during the period February to April\n2010. Relevant phenotypic data was recorded and docu-\nmented for each sample (Table 1). This study has been\napproved by the Local Ethical Committee at Kuwait\nUniversity as well as the Ministry of Health Ethical Board\nKuwait following the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.\nClinical diagnosis and blood biochemical\nanalysis\nThe CVD patient samples (n=400) were recruited mainly\nfrom the Chest Hospital, Al-Amiri Hospital and Mubarak\nHospitals. The mean age of patients was 55 years old,\nwas provided from the medical profile according to the\npresence of typical chest pain, echocardiogram and previ-\nous history of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty\nor percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\ncoronary artery bypass graft. The CVD patient samples\nwere further divided into two groups: with confirmed\nT2DM (n=204), based on the criteria suggested by\nAmerican Diabetes Association,14 and those without\nT2DM (n=196). The control group included a randomized\nsample of Kuwaiti nationals who are confirmed to be free\nof CVD based on angiography indicating a normal coro-\nnary artery with no evidence of plaque, smooth and no evi-\ndence of peripheral vascular disease, and medical records.\nA peripheral venous whole-blood sample (10 ml) was\ncollected from all the subjects under complete aseptic condi-\ntions by a certified hospital laboratory staff following a mini-\nmum of 12 hours of fasting. Quantitative measurements of\nblood plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined in 3 ml of\nblood by enzymatic methods with commercially available\nkits (Synchron System Reagents, Beckman Coulter, USA)\nanalyzed on a UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical Systems\n(Beckman Coulter, USA) in the clinical chemistry laborato-\nries at the relevant hospital, Ministry of Health. The normal\nvalues of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDLused as\nmmol/l, 0.0\u00ad40 mmol/l, respectively. The lipid profile for\npatients who were under medication and treatment was not\nprovided, since their lipid profiles were post treatment and\nhence were of normal values; however, the medical history\nof dyslipidemic patients was recorded and, if available from\nthe medical records, old profiles were used.\nGenotyping\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from 7 ml of whole\nblood by the salting-out method as previously described\nTable 1.

The D allele has been reported to\nhave a higher chance for amplification than the I allele, render-\ning potential mistyping of ID heterozygous, and in some cases\nits suppression yielding mistyping as DD.17 Although the\nmechanism for this suppression is not fully understood, the\nmistyping is considered a serious concern. Therefore, all hete-\nrozygous ID and homozygous DD were re-genotyped by a sec-\nond round of amplification using an insertion-specific primer\nthat recognizes the inserted sequence.18 The amplified PCR\nproducts were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel (routine use-\nmate the size of the PCR products.

Hardy\u00adWeinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was\ntested using the web-based calculator available at www.\ntufts.edu/, which confirmed the population to be in equi-\nlibrium. The genetic association was analyzed and con-\ntrolled for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) using the\nSNPassoc package from R software.19 The results are\nexpressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter-\nvals (CI). A power > 80% at alpha = 0.05 was achieved\nin this study assuming an average OR of 2.5 and minor\nallele frequency of 11% using the statistical software\npackage StatCalc (version 7.1.2.0; Epi InfoTM, Atlanta\nResults\nThe clinical and demographic characteristics of controls\nand CVD patients are reported in Table 1. Among the 400\npatients with CVD, 204 were classified as CVD with\nCVD patients was higher than that in controls and there-\nfore was controlled for in all statistical analysis along with\nBMI and sex. The frequency of genotypes were found in\nHWE in the control samples (p=0.78) whereas it deviated\nin the CVD samples (p=0.007). The minor allele (I) fre-\nquency in controls was 31% compared with 42% in CVD.\nA positive association of the ACE I allele with CVD\nwas observed (Table 2). Association of the I allele was\nobserved in all genetic models as well with p<0.01 after\nadjusting for BMI, age and sex (Table 2). The frequency of\nthe II genotype was higher in CVD patients compared with\ntive model (Table 2). However, there was no association\nobserved after controlling for T2DM (p>0.05). The results\nremained significant in all genetic models after controlling\nAssociation was diminished after controlling for\nT2DM, and therefore we compared the association of the\nCVD patients with T2DM (Table 3).

The frequency of the II\ngenotype was higher in the patients group compared\nwith controls (24% compared with 10.9%, respectively)\nadditive model (Table 3). The lack of association\nbetween controls and CVD patients without T2DM is\nsummarized in Table 4 in which no association was\nobserved in all studied genetic models (p>0.05) (Table\n4). Although the frequency of II genotype was higher in\nCVD patients without T2DM compared with controls\nfailed to reach significance (p>0.05).\nFurthermore we compared the distribution of the ACE\nwithout T2DM (Table 5). The association between\nthe ACE I allele and CVD was found associated with\nCVD patients with T2DM compared with CVD without\nT2DM in both the dominant and additive genetic models\n(p>0.05) (Table 5). The frequency of the ACE II geno-\ntype was higher in CVD patients with T2DM compared\np=0.02) in the additive model (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nWe observed a positive association between the ACE I\nallele and T2DM. The observed association between the\nACE I allele and CVD was diminished once controlled for\nT2DM. Our findings support that the initial association\nobserved with CVD is mediated through the presence of\nT2DM. This was confirmed when a significant association\nof the ACE I allele in CVD patients with T2DM compared\nwith those without T2DM was detected. Recent findings\nhave shown the association between the ACE D allele and\nrisk of developing CVD and T2DM.20\u00ad23 On the other\nTable 3.

A recent meta-analysis on Asian populations\ndemonstrated the D allele and the II genotype was associ-\nated with the risk of T2DM patients developing T2DM\nnephropathy (T2DN).13 Another study, by Vijayan et al.,\ndemonstrated an association of the ACE I allele with an\nincreased risk of ischemic stroke among males in south\nIndia.12 However, a meta-analysis on Arab populations\ndemonstrated the D allele to be associated with T2DM.23\nInconsistency can be attributed to the heterogeneity among\nthese studies, and therefore differences in ethnicity and\nstudy design are the most likely explanation according to\nvarious authors.12,13 In the current study all samples were\nof Kuwaiti nationality, suggesting homogeneity. However,\nthree genetic subgroups have been previously defined in\nthe Kuwaiti population, and therefore future studies may\nOur association of the ACE I allele with T2DM can be\nexplained by understanding the complexity of the rennin\u00ad\nangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS) as reviewed by\nRahimi et al.27 Angiotensin II is converted by ACE, result-\ning in aldosterone secretion and elevated blood pressure.27\nA study using intravenous infusion of angiotensin II\nshowed an enhanced blood flow resulting in insulin sensi-\ntivity.28 This is consistent with previous findings showing\nthat homozygous carriers of the I allele of the ACE gene\nhave greater insulin resistance compared with carriers of\nthe DD genotype.29\u00ad31 A study by Katsuya et al. demon-\nstrated that subjects with the DD genotype were more\ninsulin sensitive.32 Another study demonstrated that DD\nand ID genotypes were associated with lower insulin\nresistance compared with II genotypes,31 and that doses of\nangiotensin II increase insulin sensitivity in healthy sub-\nhigher ACE plasma levels compared with the II genotype,\nsupporting the association with insulin resistance.7,8 Such\nfindings suggest a potential risk to T2DM in subjects car-\nrying the I allele of the ACE gene, which is consistent with\nour findings. Due to the inconsistency in findings and\ncomplexity of the RAAS it is possible that gene\u00adgene\ninteractions play a major role within this system,34 and\ntherefore it would be useful to investigate the interactions\nof other genetic markers in the RAAS in patients with\nThe inconsistency in association studies observed with\nthe ACE I/D polymorphism may also be attributed to epi-\ngenetic mechanisms, which are alterations in gene expres-\nsion due several modifications that include DNA\nmethylation, histone modifications and RNA-based mech-\nanisms that are not caused by changes in DNA\nsequences.35,36 A recent study by Rangel et al. demon-\nstrated an interaction between DNA methylation and the\nACE I/D polymorphism.37 The DD genotype was found to\nbe associated with a decrease in DNA methylation, which\nwas associated with higher ACE activity.37 Environmental\nfactors such as nutrition and physical activity have been\nassociated with modifying a gene's epigenetic status.38,39\nDifferences in nutrition and levels of physical activity dif-\nfer between populations. Therefore such interaction\nbetween epigenetic modifications and polymorphisms\ndescribes the complexity of the genetic architecture which\ncan underlie the inconsistency in association studies\nobserved with the ACE I/D polymorphism in different\npopulations.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the present study is the first to find an asso-\nciation of the ACE I allele and T2DM in an Arab popula-\ntion. More association studies with a stratified population\nare required to confirm this finding. Our results suggest\nTable 5.

The limitation of our\nstudy is the absence of measurement of ACE plasma level\nand its correlation with the ACE genotype.\n"
