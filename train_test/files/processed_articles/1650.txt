In the context of the social scientific study of\nimmigrant incorporation, this emphasis is concordant with\na well-documented relationship linking ethnic residential\nenclaves with the maintenance and intergenerational trans-\nmission of ethnic-specific cultures(11\u00ad13).

Compared\nwith non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-Americans have lower\nmortality rates from all causes, and from leading causes\nincluding CVD and cancers at most common sites(13\u00ad18).\nMexican-American mortality rates are consistently reported\nto be lower for immigrants than they are for Mexican-\nare lower for a Mexican-American population that is\non average socio-economically disadvantaged has been\ndescribed as an epidemiological paradox(20,21).\nOne of the leading hypotheses about the better than\nexpected health and mortality outcomes for Mexican-\nAmericans, as well as the apparently poorer outcomes\nfor US-born Mexican-Americans compared with immi-\ngrants from Mexico, points to protective aspects of health-\nrelated behaviours among immigrants, including healthier\ndiets, lower rates of smoking, substance and alcohol use,\nstudies of acculturation have documented a relationship\nbetween acculturation and less healthy lifestyles in the\nMexican origin population, although effects of accul-\nturation are not entirely negative. Notably, both health-\ncare access and use of screening improves with greater\nacculturation.\nA small but growing number of studies have examined\nthe hypothesis that a high concentration of Mexican\npopulations in residential communities is associated with\nbetter health outcomes. To date, results have been mixed.\nSome studies report evidence of lower mortality, lower\nchronic disease morbidity, better mental health and\nhigher self-rated health(23\u00ad31). Others report weak, con-\nIn the present study we investigate the relationship\nbetween ethnic residential concentration of Mexican-\nAmericans and dietary intake. Specifically, we investigate\nthe hypothesis that there is a strong relationship between\nethnic concentration, e.g. residence in a barrio commu-\nnity, and types of foods consumed. This hypothesis has a\nhigh degree of plausibility, because a high level of ethnic\nconcentration in a local community creates a context for\nthe supply of ethnic-specific food products and for the\nmodelling of dietary practices. The Mexican-American\npopulation lives in very diverse residential settings, ran-\nging from homogeneous ethnic environments in near-\nborder areas in the south-west, to neighbourhoods\nthroughout the USA where they are highly integrated with\nnon-Hispanics. Do dietary practices among Mexican-\nAmericans in different neighbourhood settings differ in\nways that suggest that integration with other groups leads\nto deterioration of dietary practices that help explain the\nincreasing rates of chronic disease prevalence among\nmore acculturated Hispanics?\nMethods\nData source\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III), a large US survey conducted from\nnutritional and health status of the US population aged\n2 months or more(34). The strength of this survey is that\nit used the same stratified multistage probability design\nas previous National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys(34). Weights indicating the probability of being\nsampled were assigned to each respondent, enabling\nresults to represent the US population for each group.\nMexican-Americans were over-sampled to produce sta-\ntistically reliable health estimates for the largest ethnic\nminority subgroup in the USA. The data were collected\nvia standardized questionnaires administered by health\nprofessionals at participants' homes; standardized medi-\ncal examinations by physicians, medical technicians and\nother health professionals at the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centres\n(MEC); and laboratory tests on whole blood and sera.\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish after\ninformed consents were obtained at the initial home\ninterview. The interviewer gave each person selected for\nthe survey a brochure which described the survey pro-\ncedures using a question-and-answer format and inclu-\nded photographs of people being examined in the MEC\nrooms. The final page of the brochure was a paper that\nrequired the signature of each participant 18 years of\npleted both the home interview and the medical exam-\nination. To get the percentage of Mexican-Americans\nat the census tract level, the NHANES III was merged\nwith the 1990 US Census data. To avoid any potential\nidentification of subjects, the merge of the NHANES III\npublic database(36) with neighbourhood data (US Census\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) Research Data Center (Hyattsville,\nMD, USA). We sent the statistical models needed for\nour analyses and the NCHS remote system sent us back\nthe results. The study protocol was approved by the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Review\nBoard.\nStudy sample\nThe sample for our analyses included 5306 Mexican-\nAmerican men and women aged 17\u00ad90 years who completed\nboth the home questionnaire and medical examination.\nMeasurements\nThe outcomes were food frequencies and serum levels\nof nutrients.\nFood frequencies were assessed by a 1-month quali-\ntative FFQ(38,39).

To ensure\nthe accuracy of the nutrient contents of foods, substantial\ncare was taken to include a wide variety of traditional\nMexican foods (e.g. red chilli peppers)(41,42). The FFQ,\nadministered during the household interview, was used\nto ask respondents about the average number of times\nfoods were eaten during the 1-month period preceding\nthe interview date. Frequencies of consumption of foods\nfrom the following food groups were ascertained: fruits,\nvegetables, grains and legumes.\nSerum levels of nutrients have been shown to correlate\nwell with dietary intake of respective nutrients(43). The\nmicronutrients examined included those considered to\nbe of potential public health significance and thought to\ndecrease the risk of cancer or CVD(44\u00ad48). Serum levels of the\nfollowing nutrients were obtained: lycopene, Se, vitamin E,\nvitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B12\n, folate, a-car-\notene and b-cryptoxanthin. Serum levels of nutrients were\ndetermined by nutritional biochemistry. MEC collected\nblood samples and used the following assay or instru-\nmentation methods for laboratory assessments: `Quanta-\nphase Folate' RIA Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,\nUSA) for folate; HPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA,\nUSA) for vitamins A, C and E and carotenoids (lycopene,\na-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin); INCSTAR 25-OH-D RIA Kit\n(INCSTAR, Stillwater, MN, USA) for vitamin D (25-hydroxy-\nvitamin D3\n; and\ngraphite furnace atomic absorption using Perkin\u00adElmer\nNorwalk, CT, USA) for Se(34).\nA measure of contextual acculturation, the percentage\nof Mexican-Americans at the census tract level (a higher\npercentage indicates more isolation or less integration\nwith other ethnic groups)(25) was used as a continuous\nvariable. Other variables were age (years, used as a\ncontinuous variable) and gender (male and female).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical\nsoftware packages SAS for Windows version 9?1 (SAS\nInstitute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN version 7?11\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,\nUSA). All analyses incorporated sampling weights that\nadjusted for unequal probabilities of selection. Because of\nthe complex survey design used in NHANES III, tradi-\ntional methods of statistical analysis based on the\nassumption of a simple random sample may not be reli-\nable. Sample weights are needed to produce correct\nestimates of population quantities. Other aspects of the\nsample design (e.g. PSU (primary sampling units) pair-\nings) should be taken into account to obtain correct\nstandard errors and significance levels for hypothesis\ntesting(49,50). With continuous outcome variables, fre-\nquency of foods (e.g. cereals, tomatoes) or serum levels\nof nutrients (e.g. Se, lycopene), we used age- and gender-\nadjusted linear regression analyses (REGRESS procedure)\nto examine the independent association of the percentage\nof Mexican-Americans at the census tract level with food\nfrequencies and serum levels of nutrients.\nResults\nThe study population comprised 2682 Mexican-American\nyears and 4?8 % were 75 years of age and older. Age\ngroup distributions did not differ by gender. Eighty-eight\nper cent of subjects came from three of the four\nUS\u00adMexico border states: California, Texas and Arizona.\nThese states correspond to the south-west area of the USA\nwhere the majority of Mexican-Americans reside.\nTable 1 shows the multivariate linear regression ana-\nlyses for the relationship between consumption of spe-\ncific foods (more detailed description is provided in\nthe table) and percentage of Mexican-Americans at the\ncensus tract level.

The\nemphasis on spatial characteristics of residential com-\nmunities as a possible correlate of changes in nutrition is\nconsistent with a very old social science research finding\nthat residential concentration of immigrant and ethnic\npopulations serves to maintain ethnic-specific cultural\npatterns(11,12). It is also consistent with a recent research\nstream in epidemiology that investigates the socio-eco-\nnomic characteristics of neighbourhoods of residence in\nrelation to health-related behaviours and health out-\ncomes(51). It also identifies a variable with a broad range\namong Mexican-Americans, who are distributed across a\nbroad spectrum of residential environments, ranging from\na high degree of ethnic segregation in the border region\nof Texas, to full integration with non-Hispanics in urban\nand suburban communities throughout the USA(52).\nDietary patterns including vegetables and fruits have\nbeen associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality using\ndata from the National Health Interview Surveys(53) and the\nTable 1 Multivariate analysis results* for frequency of foods as a function of the percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level:\noutcome data in Mexican-American men and women (n 5306) were obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nPercentage of Mexican-Americans at\ncensus tract level (continuous)\nOutcomes (times/month) b SE P\nb, unstandardized beta coefficient; SE, standard error of the beta coefficient.\n*Adjusted for age and gender.\nTable 2 Multivariate analysis results* for serum levels of nutrients as a function of the percentage of Mexican-\nAmericans at the census tract level: outcome data on Mexican-American men and women (n 5306) were obtained from\nPercentage of Mexican-Americans at census tract level (continuous)\nOutcome (serum level) b SE P\nb, unstandardized beta coefficient; SE, standard error of the beta coefficient.\n*Adjusted for age and gender.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In addition, case\u00adcontrol and cohort studies\nshowed that vegetables and fruits have been associated with\nreduction in the risk of some cancers including mouth and\npharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, larynx, lung,\nbreast (vegetables only), ovary (vegetables only), bladder\nHowever, higher concentrations of Mexican-Americans\nin a neighbourhood are correlated with poverty and\ndisadvantage; therefore, the pattern of low consumption\nof some fruits (e.g. cherries, berries) and some vegetables\n(e.g. broccoli) in our study may reflect unaffordable costs\nfor foods or lower availability in a neighbourhood food\nenvironment(26). Indeed, in another study, Bodor et al.(63)\nreported that greater fresh vegetable availability within\n100 metres of residences was a positive predictor of\nvegetable intake.\nStudies of health and mortality patterns of Mexican-\nAmericans living in the USA have previously reported\nfiles(64) for Mexican-American immigrants residing in the\nUSA compared with non-Hispanic whites and US-born\nMexican-Americans. US-born Mexican-Americans appear\nto have mortality rates and biological risk profiles similar to\nor not much worse than those of non-Hispanic whites,\nwhich some commentators appear to ascribe as unexpected\nbecause of the much lower average socio-economic\nstatus of US-born Mexican-Americans compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites.\nThe explanation of the lower mortality and better than\nexpected biological risk profiles of Mexican-Americans\nremains a matter of investigation and debate. Recent\nwork has substantially removed data quality concerns\nA second hypothesis suggests that the greater propensity\nto immigrate of persons with better health may play a\nleading role, although direct evidence for this hypothesis\nremains weak. A third set of explanations points to\nhealthier socio-cultural risk profiles as a contributing\nelement. More nutritious diets for immigrants, lower rates\nof smoking and substance use, and stronger social sup-\nport, are frequently hypothesized to contribute to the\nMexican-American mortality advantage. These hypoth-\neses are concordant with evidence showing decreases in\nthe quality of diets and health-related behaviours with\nOn the other hand, high consumption of legumes\n(especially beans) and hot red chilli peppers may reflect\ncultural preferences and more affordable foods for this\nMexican-American population(41,42). It has been reported\nthat dietary patterns are different and generally less healthy\nfor US-born compared with immigrant Mexican-Americans.\nDixon et al.(41) reported that US-born Mexican-Americans\nconsumed significantly more fat and less fibre and vitamins,\nand were less likely to meet dietary guidelines than were\nimmigrant Mexican-Americans. Also, Guendelman and\nAbrams(67) reported that first-generation Mexican-American\nwomen had higher average intakes of protein, vitamins A\nand C, folic acid and Ca than second-generation Mexican\nwomen, whose nutrient intake resembles that of white non-\nHispanic women. Other studies have shown that accul-\nturation to the US culture among Mexican-Americans was\nassociated with increased dietary fat and sugar along with\nA potential explanation on how acculturation affects diet\namong Mexican-Americans is related to a higher food store\navailability and consumption of fast food in inner-city\nneighbourhoods(72,73). The consumption of these other\nfoods may influence the selection of a healthier diet profile\nin our study population of Mexican-Americans.\nSo the question we asked was whether there was evi-\ndence of dietary advantages in more rather than less\nethnically homogeneous Mexican-American communities\nthat could help explain lower rates of incidence and\nmortality for some chronic diseases for Mexican-Amer-\nicans as a population group. Therefore, consumption of\nhigher amounts of legumes (beans, lentils or chickpeas)\nmay protect the health of a population with high con-\ncentration of Mexican-Americans in the neighbourhood.\nIndeed, consumption of higher amounts of legumes may\nhave a protective effect against cancer. Kolonel et al.(74)\nreported that intake of legumes (whether total legumes,\nsoya foods specifically, or other legumes) was inversely\nrelated to prostate cancer risk. Also, Correa(75) examined\ndata from forty-one countries and found a significant\ninverse correlation between bean consumption and\nmortality due to prostate, breast and colon cancer. In\nother human or animal studies, high consumption of dry\nbeans has been associated with lower rates of myocardial\ninfarction among Costa Ricans or fewer colon adeno-\ncarcinomas among rats(76,77). These findings may be part\nof the explanation why those Mexican-Americans living\nin neighbourhoods with a high concentration of Mexican-\nAmericans exhibit lower cancer incidence or lower\noverall mortality(25,26). In Mexico, common beans are the\nsecond source of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and\nminerals after corn(78,79). Beans contain complex carbo-\nhydrates and are rich in Mg, Cu and a-linoleic acid; these\ncomponents may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid\nprofiles(76). Beans are also an excellent source of non-\nnutritive constituents such as fibre, protease inhibitors,\nphytic acid, isoflavonoids, lignans and polyphenols\nsuch as tannins. These compounds have antioxidant,\nantimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities and are also\nfree radical scavengers(78\u00ad82). In addition, capsaicin, the\nmajor pungent ingredient in red peppers, decreases the\ngrowth (e.g. inducing the apoptosis) of human and\nin vitro prostate cancer cells(83), human leukaemic\ncells(84), gastric(85) and hepatic carcinoma cells in vitro(86).\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Dietary assessment tools also have\ninherent limitations. A serum level of nutrients and\n1-month qualitative FFQ are not representative of indivi-\ndual nutrient intakes because of day-to-day variation in\nfood consumption. However, serum levels of nutrients\nare an objective measure, and we included a proxy for\ncontextual acculturation \u00ad i.e. neighbourhood density\n(percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract\nlevel) \u00ad that may capture other contextual factors related\nto the environment where Mexican-Americans live(25\u00ad28).\nThe NHANES III questionnaire does not distinguish\nbetween traditional and non-traditional fruits (e.g. papaya\nor mango v. apricots) or other foods (e.g. corn tortillas v.\ncorn muffins) among Mexican-Americans; this may lead\nto biased estimations or underestimations of some tradi-\ntional foods in this population. In addition, NHANES III\nincludes a mixed group of unprocessed-corn products\nsuch as bread or muffins but, with the exception of corn\ntortillas, does not include the consumption of processed-\ncorn and specifically masa products that are essential\nfoods in the diet of countries of Hispanic origin in the\nAmericas. Masa is used to make tortillas (or tortillas\nchips), tamales, pozole, arepas and empanadas(90,91).\nMasa is obtained after thermal-alkaline treatment, or a\nnixtamalization process, of the corn kernels. It involves\nlime-cooking (calcium hydroxide solution), followed by\nsteeping for 12\u00ad16 h, washing and stone-grinding the\ncorn grains to produce masa. Cooking the corn with lime\nsignificantly increases its Ca (.700 %), P and Fe con-\ntent(91). Ca from masa acquires great relevance because it\nrepresents almost the only source of Ca in some Latin\nAmerican countries. Masa products provide an important\nsource of energy, proteins, dietary fibre, antioxidants and\nnutrients such as phytochemicals and carotenoids (e.g.\nlutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin)(92). However, lime-\ncooking affects the amount of resistant starch and the\nquality of protein. For example, the partial removal of the\npericarp or bran leads to finished products that are con-\nsidered as semi-whole grain foods(92). Also, digestibility\nof the protein is decreased slightly, possibly because\nhydrophobic interactions, protein denaturation and cross-\nlinking of proteins occur during maize processing that\nchange the solubility of these components, which could\naffect amino acid release during enzymatic digestion(93).\nThe Hispanic population is the largest minority group in\nthe USA, and Mexican-Americans constitute the majority of\nthis group. Isolated Mexican-American communities tend to\nmaintain many of their traditional foods; however, public\nhealth campaigns are necessary not only to promote these\ntraditional foods but also to make accessible other essential\nfoods in their diet. On the other hand, more research is\nneeded to assess potential health-protective effects of\ntraditional Mexican-American foods such as avocados or\nspecific kind of beans (e.g. pinto, black).\nIn conclusion, an increased percentage of Mexican-\nAmericans at the census tract level was associated with\nless consumption of selective or non-traditional foods\n(e.g. some fruits such as melons, apples, berries; or\nvegetables such as broccoli) and low levels of serum Se\nand vitamin C, but it was associated with more con-\nsumption of traditional foods such as corn products,\nlegumes (beans, lentils and chickpeas), tomatoes and hot\nred chilli peppers. Thus, consumption of these traditional\nfoods may make a difference to the health risk profiles in\nthis population. Further studies are needed to determine\nif other nutrients or foods (e.g. masa products) that were\nnot include in the data may influence dietary profiles in\nhigh-density Mexican-American neighbourhoods. Also,\nresearch is needed to explore whether unhealthier prac-\ntices such as the consumption of fast foods or sedentary\nlifestyles are common among isolated Mexican-American\nneighbourhoods.\n"
