Opioid and non-opioid drugs\nare often used to treat postoperative shiver-\ning, but they have potential side effects,\nincluding hypotension, hypertension, sed-\nation, respiratory depression, nausea and\nvomiting.2,3 More recently, 5-HT3 receptor\nantagonists have emerged as a means of\npreventing postoperative shivering. We\nundertook a meta-analysis of controlled clin-\nical trials of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for\nthe prevention of postoperative shivering to\nassess their efficacy.\nMaterials & methods\nInclusion criteria\nWe identified randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) of patients undergoing elective sur-\ngery under general or spinal anaesthesia. The\nintervention in the experimental group was\nan intravenously administered 5-HT3 recep-\ntor antagonist; the control groups included\nan intravenous injection of placebo (physio-\nlogic saline), or meperidine. The main out-\ncome indicator in eligible studies was the\noccurrence of postoperative shivering.\nExclusion criteria\nWe excluded studies in which 5-HT3 antag-\nonists were administered in combination\nwith other drugs to prevent shivering,\nthose with incomplete information or data,\nand articles for which we could not obtain\nthe full text.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched articles published from incep-\ntion to May 2016 in the Cochrane Library,\nPubMed, EMBASE and Web of\nKnowledge. A combination of subject\nheadings with keyword searching was\nemployed and document types were not\nrestricted. English search terms included\n``ondansetron'', ``5-HT3receptor antago-\nnists'', ``Lpalonosetron'', ``granisetron'',\n``tropisetron'', ``postoperative shivering'',\n``postanaesthetic shivering'', ``Lshivering''\nand ``anesthesia''. et cetera.\nLiterature screening and quality evaluation\nTwo researchers independently screened\nstudies and extracted data, then cross-\nchecked with each other. The two resolved\ndisagreements by discussion or consulted a\nthird party when consensus could not be\nreached. We evaluated methodologic quality\nof the RCTs identified using a modified\nJadad scale.4 Evaluation included random-\nization, allocation concealment, and blind-\ning of implementers and participants.\nData extraction\nTwo researchers independently extracted\ndata using tables designed in advance, and\nthen cross-checked with each other. The two\nresolved disagreements by discussion or con-\nsulted a third party when consensus could not\nbe reached. Extracted data included: names\nof the researchers, year of publication, study\ndesign, interventions, control measures, out-\ncome indicators, target events and the overall\nsample size.\nStatistical methods\nStatistical analysis was conducted via using\nthe RevMan 5.2 program, provided by the\nCochrane Collaboration (London, UK).\nFirst, heterogeneity was tested using the\nchi-squared and I2 tests: when there was no\nively), we adopted a fixed-effects model.\nWhen we detected heterogeneity, we\nemployed a random-effects model and we\nsubsequently made an assessment of stability\nby undertaking further meta-analyses while\neliminating studies one by one. For continu-\nous variables, the weighted mean difference\nwas used, and for enumeration data, relative\nrisk (RR) was calculated. All effect sizes were\nrepresented by 95% confidence intervals (CI),\nand when P< 0.05, the results were considered\nstatistically significant. We used funnel plots to\nestablish whether there was publication bias.\nResults\nSearch results\nWe identified 248 articles using our search\nstrategy; 17 were selected for further screening\nagainst our inclusion and exclusion criteria\nafter reading the titles and checking for dupli-\ncate publication. One was excluded as the full\ntext was not available,5 another because the 5-\nHT3 antagonist was administered in combin-\nation with other drugs6 and another because\nthe number of shivering patients was not\nprovided.7 Ultimately, 14 RCTs were included\nin the meta-analysis.8\u00ad21 Figure 1 shows our\nliterature screening process.\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe included studies comprised 980 partici-\npants, 499 of whom were allocated to\nexperimental groups and 481 to control\ngroups.

Shivering is a\ncommon complication of emergence from\nanaesthesia. Shivering is generally considered\nto be a thermoregulatory phenomenon, a\nphysiologic response to lowering of core\nbody temperature during anaesthesia.\nNonetheless, heat preservation and adminis-\ntration of warmed fluids does not eliminate\nshivering.22 Under spinal anaesthesia, shiver-\ning occurs as a thermoregulatory response to\nlowering of core body temperature and\nreductions in blood supply to the upper\nbody. Thermoregulation is controlled by\ncentral nervous system neurotransmitters in\nthe hypothalamus; the preoptic area of the\nhypothalamus releases 5-HT3 to activate\nheat production pathways, and thus increase\nbody temperature. In mouse models, intra-\nvenous administration of 5-HT3 reportedly\nprovokes vaso-dilation and shivering,23 sug-\ngesting that 5-HT3-mediated pathways play\nan import-ant role in the control of post-\noperative shivering. 5-HT3 antagonists may\nFigure 3.

Funnel plot.\nprevent postoperative shivering by inhibiting\nreuptake of 5-HT in the preoptic area.1\nShivering after general anaesthesia and\nafter spinal anaesthesia may have different\ncauses. General anaesthesia likely impairs\ncentral thermoregulation, while spinal\nanaesthesia impairs peripheral and central\nthermoregulation by increasing the inter-\nthreshold range, increasing the sweating\nthreshold, and reducing the shivering and\nvasoconstriction thresholds.24 Core tem-\nperature reduction reportedly peaks 3 \u00ad 4\nhours after induction of general anaesthesia,\nbut no such peak occurs after spinal anaes-\nthesia; vasoconstriction will occur when the\ncore temperature reaches the vasoconstric-\ntion threshold in general anaesthesia, but\nnot in spinal anaesthesia.25 Interestingly,\ndespite the potential differences in mechan-\nisms, our meta-analysis found that 5-HT3\nantagonists effectively prevent postoperative\nshivering after general anaesthesia and\nspinal anaesthesia. We found no significant\ndifference between the efficacy of 5-HT3\nantagonists and meperidine for the preven-\ntion of shivering. However, our study had\nsome limitations. First, only 14 RCTs were\nincluded. Second, a variety of 5-HT3 recep-\ntor antagonists were used at different doses\nand times in the experimental groups. These\nfactors may have introduced bias and\naffected the reliability of our results.\nConsequently, more rigorously designed,\ndetailed, high-quality RCTs are needed to\nverify our conclusions.\n"
