While scholars have noted various social and political differences (e.g.,\nage, partisanship) between MTurk and population-based samples, the breadth and depth of these variations remain unclear.\nWe investigate the extent to which MTurk samples differ from population samples, and the underlying nature of these\ndifferences. We do so by replicating items from the population-based American National Election Studies (ANES) 2012 Time\nSeries Study in a survey administered to a sample of MTurk respondents. With few exceptions, we not only find that MTurk\nrespondents differ significantly from respondents completing the 2012 ANES via the Web but also that most differences are\nreduced considerably when controlling for easily measurable sample features. Thus, MTurk respondents do not appear to\ndiffer fundamentally from population-based respondents in unmeasurable ways. This suggests that MTurk data can be used to\nadvance research programs, particularly if researchers measure and account for a range of political and demographic variables\nas needed.\n",

At the same time, a number of sig-\nnificant developments over the past few decades have\ntransformed survey methodology. One notable develop-\nment is the rise of Web-based surveys (see Baker etal.,\n2010). With increased public accessibility of the Internet,\nresearchers collect survey data from thousands of partici-\npants at a lower cost and quicker pace than ever before\nAmazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is one example\nof a useful Internet-based resource. MTurk allows researchers\nto easily recruit participants and administer surveys at little\ncost: Consequently, it has emerged as a prominent data source\namong researchers of U.S. public opinion (e.g., Arceneaux,\nples include only individuals who opt into MTurk and com-\nplete a given survey, leading to samples that are typically\nunrepresentative of the U.S. population.Afair amount of work\nshows that MTurk samples consistently differ from popula-\ntion-based samples of the American public on many demo-\ngraphic and political variables (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz,\nLeeper, Freese, & Druckman, 2015).1 Nevertheless, a growing\nliterature focusing on the generalizability of experimental\nresearch using MTurk data finds that with some exceptions,\nresearchers can make credible, generalizable experimental\ninferences with some confidence (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012;\nWe update and expand on this body of work by compar-\ning an MTurk sample and a population-based sample\ndesigned to be representative of the U.S. population on a\nlarger range of demographic and political variables than\nmost previous work, namely, a host of attitudinal and behav-\nioral measures. Of greater importance, we address whether\neasily measurable features can explain raw descriptive sam-\nple differences; that is, can differences between the samples\nin more specific variables be explained by more basic and\nwell-known demographic and political variables? If so,\nMTurk samples could provide a fruitful resource for hypoth-\nesis generation and testing for observational researchers of\n1Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA\n2Stanford University, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJames N.

If not,\nMTurk respondents may fundamentally differ from those in\npopulation-based samples in ways that will misdirect infer-\nences in observational studies and that cannot be corrected\nsimply by weighting the sample by measurable features. In\neither case, researchers of public opinion, including experi-\nmentalists, will gain more clarity about when and how they\nmight adjust their sampling strategy and procedures to meet\ntheir particular needs.\nTo address these issues, we replicate items from the\nAmerican National Election Studies (ANES) 2012 Time\nSeries Study in a survey administered to a sample of MTurk\nrespondents. We compare MTurk respondents with a popu-\nlation-based sample who completed the 2012 ANES survey\nvia the Web. We document numerous and many less-noted\nraw differences, though most are consistent with one another\nand extant research. Yet, we also find that, with some excep-\ntions, once we control for a short set of relevant variables,\napproximately nine, the effects of being an MTurk respon-\ndent diminish considerably. In short, most differences\nbetween respondents in our MTurk and population-based\nsamples do not seem to reflect unobservable distinctions,\nbut rather variation on factors that researchers might expect\nand can easily capture.\nOur results suggest that, if used with care, observational\nresearchers can use MTurk for developing a research program\nin that the data will generate useful inferences on which to\nbuild (i.e., they should not generate an unusual number of false\nnegatives or false positives). However, we do not suggest that\nMTurk is a wholesale substitute for population-based samples,\nnor that controlling for the covariates we identify here is a uni-\nversally effective formula. In addition to some evidence show-\ning that MTurk samples might under- and overrepresent some\ngroups differently at distinct points in time, we also find some\ninexplicable and less well-noted differences. Our point, then,\nis that if researchers account for most basic sample features,\nthey can effectively use these measures to adjust observational\ndata (e.g., using sampling weights) so that inferences can\noften, though not always, be generalized to larger populations\n(see Callegaro etal., 2014, for discussion).2 In other words,\nwhile perhaps not ideal for observational research, with exten-\nsive and careful measurement, MTurk can be used with some\nconfidence for theory development.\nIn addition, our results further clarify when experimental-\nists expecting heterogeneous treatment effects by some char-\nacteristic should be more or less careful when using MTurk.\nAlthough by no means definitive, our findings suggest that\neven where MTurk underrepresents individuals with a given\ncharacteristic, these researchers can proceed with some con-\nfidence that increasing the number of people with that char-\nacteristic in their sample might be sufficient for properly\nestimating treatment effects across or among those individu-\nals. In any case, researchers of all kinds should always\nanalyze and situate their findings in the context of their sam-\nple, both in process and composition.\nWe begin with a brief discussion of MTurk and the ways in\nwhich samples drawn with MTurk most commonly differ\nfrom population-based samples. Next, we describe our data--\nhow we recruited and collected data from our MTurk sample,\nas well as the features of our comparison population-based\nsample who completed the 2012 ANES. We then present the\nresults of our analysis, showing a number of basic raw obser-\nvational differences, but also evidence that many, though not\nall, of these differences are reduced considerably with the\ninclusion of easily measurable covariates. We conclude with\nsuggestions for researchers interested in using MTurk to con-\nduct surveys who might be concerned with MTurk sample\ncomposition.\nMTurk and MTurk Samples\nMTurk is an online crowdsourcing labor market launched\nby Amazon.com in 2005. Individuals and organizations\n(requesters) use MTurk to hire humans (workers) to com-\nplete various computer-based tasks (Human Intelligence\nTasks or HITs). Requesters post HITs on the MTurk site and\ncan make HITs available to all MTurk workers or only\nworkers who meet a given set of requirements (e.g., an IP\naddress located in a specific geographic area). Upon com-\npletion of a HIT, requesters then either reject or accept indi-\nviduals' work and reward them accordingly. Given that\nMTurk now boasts a large number of workers willing to\ncomplete any number of computer tasks for small sums of\nmoney, it has become a popular resource among survey\nresearchers, as surveys can be posted as HITs for comple-\ntion. For example, a Google Scholar search of \"Mechanical\nNevertheless, MTurk respondents include those who opt\nin to MTurk and a given survey, meaning that MTurk sam-\nples are unrepresentative of many specified populations.\nThis also means calculating respondents' chances of being\nsampled is virtually impossible (see Baker et\nCouper, 2011). Thus, as reviewed in more detail below,\nwhile MTurk samples are usually more representative than\nother commonly used convenience-based samples, such as\ncollege students (Berinsky etal., 2012; Buhrmester etal.,\n& Ipeirotis, 2010), they consistently and clearly differ from\npopulation-based samples aiming to be representative of the\nU.S. population. Indeed, the use of MTurk has sparked con-\nsiderable debate, though there is emerging consensus that\nMTurk is largely suitable for experimental work (Berinsky\net\netal., 2010). There is no such consensus when it comes to\nobservational work, however.\nLevay et al. 3\nHow do MTurk samples usually differ from the U.S.\npopulation? Extant work shows a number of stable demo-\ngraphic differences between MTurk samples and U.S. pop-\nulation-based samples. MTurk samples tend to have lower\naverage incomes, higher average education levels, lower\naverage ages, and much smaller percentages of most non-\nWhite groups, especially Blacks (Berinsky et\n2014).3 Similarly, differences in political identity appear to\nbe mostly stable, with MTurk samples frequently contain-\ning many more Democrats and liberals than population-\nbased samples (Berinsky etal., 2012; Krupnikov & Levine,\nExisting comparisons are useful, but they do not consis-\ntently capture all potentially relevant differences between\nMTurk and U.S. population-based samples, nor do they\nconsider relationships between differences. This is espe-\ncially true when it comes to specific political attitudes (e.g.,\ngovernment spending preferences, opinions about climate\nchange, gun control, etc.) and/or behaviors (e.g., contacting\na government official; although, see Berinsky etal., 2012,\nwho include some political variables, but do not analyze\nrelationships between differences on these and other vari-\nables). These gaps are notable, given that researchers using\nMTurk most often want to make observational and/or\nexperimental inferences about attitudes and behaviors, as\nwell as about and across subgroups with particular\ncharacteristics.\nHow consistent are the various differences of MTurk sam-\nples? Do MTurk samples differ in other ways than those that\nare most often measured? More importantly, do they differ in\nmore specific attitudes and/or behaviors, and if so, can these\nbe explained by more basic demographic and political differ-\nences, or are they reflective of fundamental, potentially\nunmeasurable features of MTurk respondents? If the former,\nMTurk could be a relatively useful data source even among\nobservational researchers, as they can account for factors\nthat differentiate MTurk respondents from others. If the lat-\nter, the ability of researchers using MTurk to make infer-\nences would be more limited, particularly those wishing to\nmake observational inferences of various kinds, but also\nresearchers wishing to draw inferences about specific sub-\ngroups or who expect treatment effects to differ among spe-\ncific subgroups who are less well represented among MTurk\nrespondents.\nData and Method\nTo address our questions, we turn to the ANES 2012 Time\nSeries Study. The ANES Time Series Study has been con-\nducted in every national election year since 1948 and is\none of the most extensive social and political surveys of\nthe American electorate. In 2012, for the first time in its\nhistory, the Time Series Study was conducted both face-to-\nface and over the Internet with two independent samples.\nThe sample who completed the Internet survey were mem-\nbers of GfK's (formerly Knowledge Networks)\nKnowledgePanel, a sample of U.S. households drawn\nusing random digit dialing and address-based methods.\nSampled households were drawn randomly from a listing\nof addresses from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery\nSequence File and U.S. residential landline telephone\nnumbers. Households without a computer and/or Internet\naccess were offered a laptop and free monthly Internet\naccess from GfK in return for participation. A sample of\nKnowledgePanel members, who were U.S. citizens and at\nleast 18 years old by the time of the 2012 presidential elec-\ntion (November 6, 2012), was sent invitations to partici-\nindividuals who completed the 2012 ANES during the\n2012 U.S. presidential election in four waves, two con-\nThe 2012 ANES is well suited for our purposes. To begin,\nit provides data from a population-based sample that, with the\nuse of weights, is representative of the U.S. population. As\nimportant, it offers data on a number of variables of direct rel-\nevance to political and social science researchers and that\nremain largely unexplored with respect to MTurk. Finally,\ngiven completion of the survey via Internet by an indepen-\ndently drawn, population-based sample, we can analyze and\ncompare the data from the 2012 Web ANES sample with data\nfrom an MTurk sample while controlling for survey mode (see\nmode effects).\nWe designed and administered a survey on MTurk replicat-\ning numerous questions from the 2012 ANES. While limited\nby timing (i.e., not during or directly after the 2012 campaign;\nsee below), our survey included a range of questions, many of\nwhich do not appear in extant work, thereby allowing us to\noffer one of the broadest sample comparisons to date and to test\nwhether a number of sample differences can be captured by a\nhost of basic demographic and political variables. In addition to\na number of commonly measured demographics, such as age,\nincome, and racial and ethnic identification, we included less\nconsistently measured, as well as more specific demographics,\nsuch as employment status, home ownership, and both reli-\ngious identity and group affiliation. We also included a number\nof opinion measures on salient topics, such as abortion, gun\ncontrol, government spending in numerous areas, lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) rights, the environment,\nand the general role of government, as well as behavioral mea-\nsures, such as contact with an elected official, volunteering, and\nmedia consumption habits. All questions were worded and\n4 SAGE Open\nrandomized identically to the 2012 ANES, as well as ordered\naccording to the order in which they appeared in the survey\nquestionnaire.5\nWe made our survey available to MTurk workers on\nthree requirements for participation: a HIT Approval Rate\ngreater than or equal to 90, at least 50 HITs approved, and\nan IP address based in the United States. The survey was\nadvertised to workers as a national public opinion survey\nthat would take 20 to 30 minutes to complete, terms similar\nto that of other work.6 We closed the HIT after 2 days, on\ncompletions.\nGiven the advertised completion time, and to gather data\nas quickly as possible, participants were compensated\nUS$2.50 upon completion of the survey. Although relatively\nhigh, this amount is smaller than some (e.g., Huff & Tingley,\n2015) and the rate per minute based on the advertised survey\ncompletion time is roughly comparable with most other work\n(e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012). Moreover, though not studied\nsystematically, there is little evidence to suggest that higher\ncompensation rates do more than decrease the amount of\ntime it takes to recruit participants (Buhrmester etal., 2011;\nIn short, given comparable recruitment methods, we believe\nthat our findings can be reasonably compared with those of\nextant work.\nBelow, we first assess the breadth of social and political\ndifferences between the samples and then consider the extent\nto which they can be explained by measured characteristics.\nWe do so using regression analyses, first without covariates\nso as to calculate the simple differences between MTurk and\n2012 ANES Web respondents on various items--which we\ncall the \"raw\" differences--and then with basic covariates to\nestimate whether and how much this resolves those differ-\nences. For all analyses, we exclude respondents for which no\nresponse was given or \"Don't Know\" was chosen. We also\nweight the ANES data to be representative of the U.S.\npopulation.\nResults\nRaw Socio-Demographic Differences\nTable 1 presents descriptive data for socio-demographic vari-\nables among each sample, as well as coefficients for an MTurk\ndummy variable used in regression models of each variable\nwith no controls. The latter provides the size of a given differ-\nence between the samples and whether it is statistically signifi-\ncant by conventional standards. Table 1 mostly confirms\ndifferences found in prior work; the MTurk sample is younger,\nmore likely to be unmarried, lower income, and much less\nracially and ethnically diverse than the ANES sample. The\naverage age of the MTurk sample is almost 20 years younger\nlarger share of the MTurk sample has also never been married\nthe MTurk sample is about US$10,000 less than the ANES\nsample (~US$54K vs. ~US$65K) and a significantly smaller\npercentage of MTurk respondents owns a home (37.8% vs.\n72.1%). Finally, compared with the ANES sample, the MTurk\nsample contains about the same percentage of Whites (71.8%\nvs. 70.5%), but significantly smaller percentages of Blacks\nIn addition, many more MTurk respondents report no race or\nethnicity at all (7.1% vs. 1.9%) or something other than only\nthose categories (8.6% vs. 3.7%).7 We also find a much larger\npercentage of MTurk respondents are students (22.3% vs.\n6.4%). Thus, as others find, despite being less well-off eco-\nnomically, the MTurk sample is much more educated than the\nANES sample, with 45% of the MTurk sample possessing at\nleast a bachelor's degree versus only 29.5% of the ANES\nInterestingly, while some earlier work highlights that\nMTurk samples underrepresent men (e.g., Ipeirotis, 2010;\nPaolacci etal., 2010), our data exhibit the opposite pattern\n(53.9% male). This finding, however, is consistent with\nmore recent work (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012; Casler etal.,\nconsistently measured across studies, our data appear to\ncontrast when it comes to religious identity. We find no dif-\nferences between the samples in any organized religious\ngroup identifications (also see Berinsky et\nHowever, we do confirm previous findings on religious\nbeliefs and religiosity; a strikingly substantial percentage\nof the MTurk sample--over 40%--identifies as agnostic or\natheist, whereas only 10% of ANES respondents does and\nmany fewer MTurk respondents attend church or religious\nGiven comparable recruitment methods, though specu-\nlative, the above suggests that the composition of the\nMTurk worker population might shift over time, at least on\nsome variables. Also, MTurk samples might differ at differ-\nent points in time on particular variables more than on oth-\ners, even where measured characteristics might seem\nrelated (e.g., wider and more stable differences in religious\nbeliefs/religiosity vs. organized religious group identifica-\ntion). While these are generally beyond researchers' con-\ntrol, as we discuss in the conclusion, it underscores the\nutility of regularly measuring multiple demographic fea-\ntures in multiple ways when using MTurk.\nRaw Political Differences\nTables 2 and 3 include descriptive data for political variables,\nas well as the MTurk coefficients for regression models of\nLevay et al. 5\nTable 1.

Consistent with previous\nwork, our MTurk sample is significantly more liberal and\nDemocratic than theANES sample. The mean ideology of the\nMTurk sample is almost a full point lower on a scale of 1 to 7\nMTurk sample identifying as between slightly liberal and\nextremely liberal compared with only 27.8% of the ANES\nsample. Similarly, a significantly larger percentage of MTurk\na smaller percentage identifies as Republican (14.6% vs.\nOur MTurk sample also differs significantly in political\npreferences, though in ways that are consistent with other\nwork (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012) and the samples' broader\npolitical differences (i.e., preferences reflect the more lib-\neral, Democratic composition of the MTurk sample).\nRelative to the ANES sample, the MTurk sample more\nstrongly favors environmental regulation of business, guar-\nanteed jobs and income by government, increased spending\nand services by the government, and a government health\ninsurance plan, as well as increased government spending\nin many specific areas (e.g., on science and technology). In\naddition, the MTurk sample expresses stronger support of\ngay and lesbian marriage, abortion with no restrictions, and\nstricter gun control laws than the ANES sample. Finally,\nmore respondents in the MTurk sample oppose offshore\nLevay et al. 7\ndrilling, deporting immigrants, increasing immigration\nrestrictions, and the death penalty than in the ANES sam-\nple, as well as agree that global warming is happening, ris-\ning temperatures are bad, and climate change is caused\nmostly by humans.\nThe MTurk sample differs less in terms of political\nbehavior. Similar and statistically indistinguishable per-\ncentages of MTurk and ANES respondents are likely to\nples are similar in terms of whether they have any say in\nwhat government does, as indicated by virtually equal\nmeans of 3.3 among the samples on a scale of 1 to 5.\nAlthough these findings appear to contradict those showing\nthat MTurk respondents are less politically active (e.g.,\nBerinsky etal., 2012), they are likely due to measurement\ndifferences. Others have mostly gauged activity with mea-\nsures of voter turnout and registration, activities for which\nsocio-demographic characteristics, namely age, are both\nstrongly related to being an MTurk respondent and less sig-\nnificant predictors of the political activities measured here\nThat said, the samples differ when it comes to news media\nconsumption, though in ways similar to recent work (Huff &\nTingley, 2015). The difference between the samples in the\naverage number of days spent getting news during a typical\nweek is higher for the MTurk sample, but only with respect to\nInternet news (4.9 vs. 3.7). Alternatively, this average is about\na day higher for both print and TV news for the ANES sample\nage level of attention paid to news among those who gather it\nfrom print or television at least 1 day or more during a typical\nvs. 3.2, respectively, on a scale of 1-5), but higher when it\ncomes to Internet news gatherers (3.1 vs. 2.8 on a scale of 1-5).\nThese findings not only confirm previous work but also under-\nscore that even as it underrepresents some groups, MTurk\nmight be useful for attracting subgroups with more specific\nqualities. That is, MTurk samples might do relatively well at\nattracting large numbers of younger people who are highly\ninterested in news and older people who are not, at least com-\npared with population-based samples (see Huff & Tingley,\nMultivariate Analyses of Socio-Economic\nDifferences\nWe now turn to the important question of whether differ-\nences diminish when including measured covariates or\nreflect some fundamental and unmeasured distinction of\nMTurk respondents. We select sets of the broadest, most\ncommonly measured covariates for which one can reason-\nably expect effects on more specific socio-demographic and\npolitical variables.\nTable 4 reports the coefficients for MTurk sample mem-\nbership (vs. ANES) from regressions of every socio-\ndemographic variable, adding respondents' age, age2, gen-\nder, and race and ethnicity as covariates; income and educa-\ntion are covariates in all models except for when they are\noutcomes.9 For categorical outcomes, reported coefficients\nrepresent the average discrete change in the predicted prob-\nability resulting from being an MTurk respondent. We also\nreport the percentage reduction of the coefficients from the\nmodels without any controls.\nA quick glance at Table 4 suggests that differences\nbetween the samples are not simply a by-product of their\nmore basic demographic characteristics. Indeed, being an\nMTurk respondent remains a significant predictor for 21 of\nTable 3.

However--perhaps\nmore revealingly--there are substantial reductions in the\nsize of the MTurk coefficient across the models for most\nevery variable (i.e., the substantive difference of being an\nMTurk respondent becomes quite small). The main excep-\ntions are for employment status, earnings, and health\nassessment. Thus, while remaining statistical differences\nTable 4.

We run regression\nmodels for each variable, now adding nine covariates: age,\nage,2 gender, race and ethnicity, income, education, whether a\nrespondent has never been married, whether a respondent\nidentifies as atheist or agnostic, political ideology, and parti-\nsanship (the latter two are excluded when each is an outcome\nvariable).\nThe results in Table 5 show that, as with socio-demo-\ngraphic variables, being an MTurk respondent remains\nstatistically significant for most of the variables, 25 of\n39. Nevertheless, the size of the coefficients is also\nreduced considerably across the models for nearly every\nvariable, except for the number of days an individual\nspends gathering news from the Internet during a typical\nweek. Even when statistically important, both the rela-\ntive substantive impact of being an MTurk respondent is\nmuch smaller than other variables and these other vari-\nables predict outcomes in expected ways. For example,\nwhile statistically significant, an MTurk respondent is\nonly 0.25 points more supportive of government insur-\nance than an ANES respondent on a scale of 1 to 7, a\nsmall increase not only by itself, but also compared with\nthe impact of other variables on such support, such as\nideology (see the appendix). There are only a few nota-\nble exceptions to this pattern, such as death penalty atti-\ntudes and Internet news consumption. Overall then, as\nwith our analysis of demographics, MTurk respondents\ndo not appear to fundamentally differ (in terms of the\nsubstantive size of the effect) on political variables once\nwe control for just a handful of variables, particularly\nideology and partisanship.10\nTo summarize, our samples differ in ways that are simi-\nlar to previous work, though not exactly. In line with past\nwork, for example, our MTurk sample is much younger,\nless racially and ethnically diverse, and more liberal and\nDemocratic than the ANES Internet sample. However, the\nsample differs less or differently from previous work when\nit comes to gender and organized religion. We also identi-\nfied other less well-explored, though expected differences,\nnamely, attitudes on a number of different political issues\nand policies. As important, we showed that the importance\nof being an MTurk respondent is reduced in most instances\nand negligible in many when controlling for relatively few,\nbroad, and relevant factors. In other words, the MTurk\nsample differs from the ANES sample but this is explained\nfairly well by measurable differences.\nConclusion\nAmazon's MTurk allows researchers to recruit large samples\nquickly at low cost. In turn, its presence among many types\nof behavioral science research has rapidly expanded\n(Bohannon, 2011). However, the relative representativeness\nof MTurk samples raises some concerns over inferences\nbased on MTurk data, at least compared with those based on\ndata from population-based samples, namely, generalizabil-\nWe sought to update and extend our knowledge of\nMTurk samples by comparing an MTurk sample with a\nnationally representative one on a large range of demo-\ngraphic and political variables. Our samples differed on\nvariables in similar ways as in past work, but also some not\nincluded in extant scholarship. More importantly, these dif-\nferences are significantly reduced when accounting for nine\nbroad, measurable features by which MTurk samples differ\nstarkly: age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, education,\nmarital status, religion, ideology, and partisanship.\nImportantly, this set of variables is slightly broader than\nthat most commonly identified as most consequential (e.g.,\nage and ideology).\nAs a whole, these results imply that observational\nresearchers of public opinion can profitably use MTurk,\nas long as they measure at least the nine covariates we\nidentify. Doing so will allow for the development of sam-\nple weights commonly employed when using other types\nof opt-in samples. As Callegaro et\nthose who use non-probability samples (e.g., opt-in)\n\"argue that the bias in samples . . . can be reduced through\nthe use of auxiliary variables that make the results repre-\nsentative. These adjustments can be made with . . .\n[w]eight adjustments [using] a set of variables that have\nbeen measured in the survey\" (p. 13). What we have\ndone, then, is identified those variables that allow obser-\nvational researchers to weight data from MTurk and\nreduce potential biases.\nStill, measuring the covariates identified here is not a uni-\nversal, foolproof solution for observational researchers inter-\nested in using MTurk. We employed a particular recruitment\nmethod and while broad in approach, nevertheless explored\nparticular variables. Moreover, differences remain, however\nnegligible, and some can apparently be inconsistent. Taken\ntogether, this suggests that additional covariates are more or\nless important to include depending upon the question at hand\nand the timing of sampling.\nOur results are also useful for experimentalists of pub-\nlic opinion concerned with treatment effects that are\nexpected to differ by particular characteristics. While the\nrepresentativeness of MTurk does not threaten experimen-\ntal inferences in most cases (e.g., Mullinix etal., 2015),\none might nevertheless misestimate treatment effects if\ngroups who are expected to respond to an experimental\ntreatment differently than others are underrepresented\nand/or differ in unmeasurable ways from others like them\nTable 5.

Importantly, however,\nwe find not only that the impact of being an MTurk\nrespondent is reduced when controlling for other factors,\nbut also that these factors behave in expected ways. While\nnot definitive by any means, this provides at least some\nevidence that even while underrepresented, individuals\nbelonging to groups who opt into being an MTurk worker\nthat are underrepresented might not differ all that much\nfrom those who do not. As such, researchers can proceed\nwith some confidence that increasing the number of peo-\nple with a given characteristic in their sample might be\nsufficient for properly estimating treatment effects across\nor among those individuals. In any case, researchers\nshould always analyze and situate findings in the context\nof their sample, both in process and composition.\nWith the above in mind, as highlighted by others (e.g.,\nHuff & Tingley, 2015), a promising approach for researchers\nconcerned with representativeness or with specific sample\nneeds is to employ software and sampling procedures aimed\nat creating larger and/or targeted survey pools. While vary-\ning in the type and amount of resources required, programs\ndeveloped by researchers and other programmers, such as\nMTurk R (see Leeper, 2013) and TurkPrime, as well as\nimplementing multiple demographic surveys on MTurk with\nunique samples of workers, readily provide a means of creat-\ning samples with more diverse and/or specific demographic\nand political characteristics. Thus, depending upon research-\ners' needs, these methods can be usefully leveraged to\naddress potential sampling issues introduced by using\nMTurk.\nTo be sure, we reiterate that MTurk does not provide a\nsubstitute for population-based samples; indeed, as men-\ntioned, even with our set of covariates, sample differences\nremained. However, with proper care and measurement\napproaches, researchers can use it to adequately build research\nprograms. Our identification of key sources of sample differ-\nences offers a blueprint for what scholars can do in using\nMTurk and in turn, maximize the likelihood that they can\ndraw useful inferences from MTurk. In sum, as with any\nsource of data, to get the most out of MTurk, researchers\nshould critically examine their sampling strategy and compo-\nsition in relation to their expectations and the question at\nhand.\nTable A1.
