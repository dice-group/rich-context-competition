    "abstract": "Abstract\nCommunication measures can raise protective behavior regarding climate change, natural hazards, and other health risks.\nFor being effective in such communication, we designed a five-steps methodology and applied it to health-protective behavior\nduring heat extremes in Austria. The five steps are as follows: (1) target group selection, a multicriteria assessment (MCA)\nto identify the most important target group(s)--this led to the identification of mobile health care nurses as our primary\ntarget group; (2) target group analysis by interviews to identify drivers of and barriers to protective behavior--for the mobile\nhealth care nurses, the drivers were their climate change perceptions, control beliefs, perceptions of role models, and extent\nof thinking about heat and health, and the barriers were fatalism and work stress; (3) development of target group specific\ncommunication formats addressing the identified drivers and barriers--for the nurses, we designed a workshop format,\nanimated videos, and two print formats; (4) pretest of formats in focus groups--these revealed our formats were effective in\nincreasing heat risk awareness, competence, and protective behavior among the nurses; (5) improvement of formats based\non pretest results--for example, we modified the workshop format to become a venue for mutual learning. These five steps\ncan be applied to other projects where awareness, competence, or behavior shall be increased by means of communication.\n",

The heat wave in the summer of 2003\nin Europe resulted in more than 70,000 deaths,1 in particular\nof the elderly (Robine et al., 2008). Morbidity and mortality\nof the elderly increase during and after heat periods, as has\nbeen shown for several locations in Europe (e.g., Fouillet\net al., 2008) and the United States (e.g., Anderson & Bell,\n2009). Climate change models project near-term increases in\nthe duration, intensity, and spatial extent of heat waves and\nCommunication of climate change risks and adaptation\noptions--including procedures for education and participa-\ntion--can play an important role in increasing protective\nbehavior and thereby decreasing vulnerabilities to climate\nchange (Grothmann, 2014). Related to the risk of increasing\nheat waves, the most widely documented policy for reducing\nheat vulnerabilities to date is the adoption of heat warnings\nand air quality alert systems to trigger emergency responses\n(Harlan & Ruddell, 2011). Nevertheless, in their review\nstudy on the effectiveness of public health interventions in\nreducing morbidity and mortality during heat episodes,\nBassil and Cole (2010) conclude that the evidence for a posi-\ntive impact of communicative public health interventions\n1Carl von Ossietzky Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg, Germany\n2Environment Agency Austria, Vienna, Austria\nCorresponding Author:\nTorsten Grothmann, Carl von Ossietzky Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg,\nEmail: torsten.grothmann@uni-oldenburg.de\nA Five-Steps Methodology to Design\nCommunication Formats That Can\nContribute to Behavior Change: The\nExample of Communication for\nHealth-Protective Behavior Among\nElderly During Heat Waves\nTorsten Grothmann1, Markus Leitner2, Natalie Glas2,\nand Andrea Prutsch2\n Keywords\npublic health, climate change, adaptation, heat waves, communication, behavior change, elderly\n2 SAGE Open\nduring heat waves is limited and that the most vulnerable\ngroups are not being adequately reached.\nWith this in mind, we aimed at developing communica-\ntion formats, which have the potential to be more effective\nthan previous communicative public health interventions\nduring heat waves, in the project CcTalk!2 We focused on the\ndevelopment of communication measures only, as other vul-\nnerability reduction measures (e.g., urban greening to\ndecrease air temperature in urban areas) have not been pos-\nsible within the scope of this project.\nIn addition to developing communication formats that\ncontribute to reducing vulnerabilities of the elderly during\nheat waves, we also wanted to address the following three\ngaps in previous scientific work and communication\npractice:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Publications in the heat and health domain mostly\naddress either perceptions of health risks and options\nfor protective behavior (e.g., Abrahamson et al., 2008;\nFitzGerald, Aitken, Verrall, & Tong, 2013) or com-\nmunication interventions such as heat warnings to\nincrease risk awareness and protective behavior (e.g.,\nBassil & Cole, 2010; Bouzid, Hooper, & Hunter,\net al. 2014). Publications that link knowledge about\ninfluential perceptions (e.g., those which act as driv-\ners of or barriers to protective behavior in a particular\ngroup) with the development of communication inter-\nventions that are able to change these influential per-\nceptions (e.g., by increasing perceptions that motivate\nprotective behavior) are lacking. Making this link is\nan integral step in marketing approaches that develop\ntheir marketing instruments for specific target groups\n(e.g., television spots) from systematic analyses of\nthese groups. It is surprising that such marketing\napproaches have been used in several projects to\ninfluence mitigation of climate change (primarily to\nreduce household energy use; see Maibach, Roser-\nRenouf, & Leiserowitz, 2008), but have rarely been\nused to influence adaptation to climate change such as\nprotective behavior during heat extremes. Therefore,\nit was an objective of the CcTalk! project to systemati-\ncally use the results of target group analyses on influ-\nential perceptions to develop effective communication\nformats that are able to change these influential\nperceptions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Much of the development of communication formats,\nnot only in the domain of adaptation to climate change\nbut also the public health domain, lack a systematic\nunderstanding of the drivers of and barriers to protec-\ntive behavior. Psychological research on perceptions\nand behavior regarding natural hazards and other health\nrisks has identified a number of determinants (e.g., risk\nperceptions, self-efficacy beliefs, etc.) of protective\nbehavior, including self-protective and altruistic behav-\nior, and has systematized these determinants in theories\nsuch as Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers,\nModel (HBM; Champion & Skinner, 2008; Hochbaum,\n1958), and Norm-Activation Theory (NAT; Schwartz,\n1977). Furthermore, psychological intervention\nresearch has identified a number of effective interven-\ntions to change people's risk awareness and behavior\n(e.g., Mosler & Gutscher, 1998). The CcTalk! project\naimed to make use of this scientific knowledge to\ndevelop target group specific communication formats.\nIt was not the aim of CcTalk! to test, compare, or\nimprove psychological theories of protective behavior\nor effective interventions. Therefore, this article aims at\npresenting the use (not a test, comparison, or improve-\nment) of psychological knowledge and theories (such\nas PMT, HBM, NAT) for the design of communication\nmeasures that have the potential to contribute to behav-\nior change.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Most of the current practices in communication of cli-\nmate change adaptation have not been empirically\nevaluated regarding their effectiveness in creating\nawareness for climate change risks and stimulating\nadaptation action (Wirth, Prutsch, & Grothmann,\n2014). \"Although there are many guidelines for cli-\nmate communication, there is little empirical evidence\nThe same situation seems to apply to interventions\nregarding health risks of heat waves. Eight years ago,\nthe World Health Organization (WHO; 2009) stated,\n\"There is a lack of targeted, systematic reviews to\nidentify and assess the effectiveness of interventions\nto control key climate-sensitive health risks, for\nexample, for the control of vector-borne diseases, or\nheat health action plans\" (p. 9). Since then, some stud-\nies tried to evaluate the effectiveness of heat wave\nearly warning systems (Bassil & Cole, 2010; Lowe\net al., 2011), but it remains largely unclear which\ncommunication formats work for reducing vulnerabil-\nities and which do not. Furthermore, evaluations have\nfocused on heat wave early warning systems. Other\nmethods of communication such as education tools to\ntrain professionals like mobile health care nurses for\nheat waves have not yet been evaluated. Hence, fol-\nlowing the claim \"it should be no more acceptable to\nrelease an untested communication than an untested\ndrug\" by Fischhoff (2007), a further objective of the\nCcTalk! project was to evaluate its communication\nformats prior to their broad dissemination (p. 190).\nIn sum, the overall aim of the project was to develop com-\nmunication formats that have the potential to be more effective\nthan previous communicative public health interventions dur-\ning heat waves. The specific aims were to (a) systematically\nGrothmann et al. 3\nuse results of target group analyses on perceptions that influ-\nence behavior to develop effective communication formats\nthat are able to change these influential perceptions, (b) pres-\nent the benefits of using scientific psychological knowledge\nfor the design of communication formats, and (c) evaluate\ncommunication formats prior to their broad dissemination.\nTo address these objectives, we developed a five-steps\nmethodology for designing communication formats that sup-\nport the motivation of protective behavior in various risk\ndomains (e.g., climate change, natural hazards) and applied it\nto health-protective behavior during heat extremes inAustria.\nThe methodology strongly builds on psychological knowl-\nedge about determinants of protective behavior regarding\nhealth risks (e.g., Prentice-Dunn, McMath, & Cramer, 2009)\nand on psychological methods for designing behavior change\ninterventions (e.g., Abrahamse & Matthies, 2012). The five\nsteps can be applied to various risks domains and are there-\nfore meant as a general approach for communication\ndesign--especially in the context of climate change adapta-\ntion and protective behavior regarding heat extremes, where\nsuch systematic methodologies are as yet very rare.\nPaper Structure and Overview\nThe five-steps methodology includes the following:\n1. target group selection by a MCA,\n2. target group analysis by interviews based on psycho-\nlogical knowledge of determinants of protective\nbehavior,\n3. development of communication formats based on\nresults of the target group analysis and on psycho-\nlogical knowledge of effective behavior change\ninterventions,\n4. pretest of communication formats by focus group\nworkshops, and\n5. improvement of formats based on pretest results.\nIn the following sections, these steps are presented in\ndetail. Every section first describes the methods applied in\nthe respective step and then presents our results related to the\ndesign of effective communication formats for reducing the\nvulnerability of the elderly during heat waves--the specific\ntopic addressed in the CcTalk! project.\nStep 1--Target Group Selection:\nSelecting the \"Right\" Target Group\nMethod\nA systematic selection of the target group(s) is essential to\nreach the communication aims. In the project CcTalk!, we\nfirst compiled a list of potential target groups for communi-\ncation aimed primarily at changing behavior to reduce vul-\nnerabilities to heat waves. This list, specific to the health\nsector in Austria, included groups such as the elderly, public\nhealth authorities, pharmacies, health insurances, doctors,\nkindergarten teachers, and mobile health care services.3\nSecond, we conducted a MCA to select our target groups.\nEach of the groups identified in the first step was assessed\nbased on the following 10 criteria, which were developed in\nthe CcTalk! project and appear generalizable to other proj-\nects aiming at increasing awareness, competence, and pro-\ntective behavior regarding risks such as climate change,\nnatural hazards, or other health risks.\n 1. Negative future impacts of the risk (in this case, heat\nwaves) on the group\n 2. Options for protective behavior in the group\n 3. Low level of current protective behavior in the group\n4. Low probability for future increase of protective\nbehavior in the group without additional measures\n(like communication measures addressing the group)\n 5. Urgency of protective behavior by the group (because\nnegative impacts have to be expected in the near\nfuture)\n 6. Relevance of the group to increase awareness of the\nrisk beyond the group (role as \"awareness multipli-\ners,\" opinion leaders)\n7. Relevance of the group to increase awareness of\noptions for protective behavior beyond the group\n(role as \"behavior multipliers,\" behavioral models)\n\n8. Reachability of the group by communication\nmeasures\n 9. Existing contacts to the group\n10. Willingness of group members to take part in focus\ngroup workshops for a pretest of communication\nformats\nThe first criterion applies to direct impacts (e.g., health\nimpacts of heat waves for the group of the elderly) as well as\nindirect impacts (e.g., increasing workload for mobile health\ncare nurses during heat waves). Its assessment should be\nbased on current scientific knowledge.\nCriteria 2 to 5 are closely linked to the aim of ensuring a\nhigh level of protective behavior within the group. Criteria 6\nand 7 assess the potential of group members to act as multi-\npliers and therefore address social network\u00adlevel drivers of\nThe eighth criterion requires an assessment whether a\ngroup can be reached and influenced by communication for-\nmats. Some groups seem relatively insensitive to communi-\ncation formats. For example, public health authorities appear\nto react mainly to laws and regulations, and less to commu-\nnication measures such as flyers or brochures that are sent to\nthem.\nThe ninth criterion was included due to economic rea-\nsons. A good and trustful contact to a group is often a neces-\nsary condition for the willingness of group members to take\npart in target group interviews (see Step 2) and in pretests of\n4 SAGE Open\ncommunication formats (see Step 4). Establishing such a\ncontact to a new group often requires a lot of time and effort,\nbut the CcTalk! project had a restricted budget. The tenth\ncriterion is closely linked to the specific method used in the\nCcTalk! project for the pretest of the communication formats\n(see Step 4). A focus group workshop requires that members\nof the group are taking part, and for some groups, the will-\ningness to attend such a workshop can be expected to be\nlower than for others.\nThe 10 criteria were assessed for all identified target\ngroups in the heat risk domain by all 10 project team mem-\nbers individually (rating 0 = \"criterion is probably not ful-\nfilled\" or 1 = \"criterion is probably fulfilled\"). In a subsequent\ndiscussion by the project team, those assessments were dis-\ncussed for which there was a high level of disagreement.\nThese were assessments for which about half of the team\nmembers had given a rating of 0, whereas the other half had\nchosen a 1. Individual assessments could be changed after\nthe discussion. Finally, the ratings of all team members were\nadded for all criteria and those target groups were selected\nthat gained the highest rating sums.\nResults and Discussion\nMobile health care nurses and kindergarten teachers got the\nhighest rating sums and were therefore selected as the pri-\nmary target groups. In this publication, only the results for\nthe mobile health care nurses are presented. Mobile health\ncare nurses visit people in need of care--most of them are\nolder than 65--on a regular basis (once or twice a day).\nOne important reason for selecting mobile health care\nnurses and not the elderly themselves as a primary target\ngroup was that several publications (Abrahamson et al.,\nself-perception as vulnerable among the elderly--obviously\nleading to a lack of self-protective behavior (Bassil & Cole,\ndetect such a lack of self-perception as vulnerable, the major-\nity of studies indicate that older people are probably difficult\nto reach by communication formats on heat-related health\nrisks, which led to low ratings for the elderly regarding\nCriterion 8. As many of them, due to their lack of self-per-\nception as vulnerable, do not see any need to read or listen to\nheat-related communication measures, these measures would\nhave no or only a minor effect on their risk awareness or\nFurthermore, the following considerations were relevant\nfor selecting mobile health care nurses as a primary target\ngroup. They can act as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Protectors\": They can directly reduce the vulnerabil-\nity of the elderly (e.g., by giving them something to\ndrink or by measures to cool down patients' bodies)\nand thereby partly compensate for the lack of self-\nprotective behavior among the elderly;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Multipliers\": They have regular personal contact\nwith the elderly and their relatives and know the med-\nical conditions of the patients. Hence, they can act as\nawareness and behavior multipliers (see Criteria 6 and\n7), who can tailor their communication to the specific\nmedical conditions of the patients;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Motivators\": Due to their regular personal contact to\nthe elderly, they are also in a good position to moti-\nvate self-protective behavior of the elderly, as studies\n(e.g., Mosler & Gutscher, 1998) have shown that\ndirect face-to-face forms of communication are better\nsuited to change people's behavior than nonpersonal\nforms of communication such as flyers or brochures,\nespecially if the communicators are known and\nrespected for their expertise regarding an issue.4\nWhile the health care nurses were selected as a primary\ntarget group in the CcTalk! project, the elderly and their rela-\ntives were planned to be addressed as secondary target\ngroups--mainly via the health care nurses in their roles as\nmultipliers and motivators. The self-protective behavior of\nthe elderly was seen as essential to reduce their vulnerabili-\nties. Hence, they had to be addressed by the communication\nformats as well. Furthermore, the social context of the\nelderly, primarily their relatives, was regarded as an impor-\ntant secondary target group because they can act as protec-\ntors, multipliers, and motivators like the nurses.\nStep 2--Target Group Analysis\nMethod\nA recent WHO (2011) publication states, \"one must know\nwhat people think in order to design successful messages\"\n(p. 28). Accordingly, the aim of a target group analysis is to\nfind out as much as possible about the properties of the target\ngroup that are of relevance for the design of the communica-\ntion formats.\nAlthough the analysis of publications (scientific or media\narticles) that relate to the target group in question can be a\nuseful method for gathering data on a target group, in most\ncases, a survey with members of the target group--by indi-\nvidual or group interviews or by questionnaires--is neces-\nsary. Most of the important questions about knowledge,\nattitudes, opinions, preferred communication channels, and\nso on in the target group can only be answered in this way. In\nthe CcTalk! project, we conducted half-standardized tele-\nphone interviews with 30 female mobile health care nurses in\nthe provinces of Lower Austria and Burgenland, which\nalready had experienced heat waves in the past. The nurses\nwere identified and contacted via the higher management\nlevels of two major mobile health care providers in Austria\n(Red Cross Austria, Caritas). Hence, the interviewed nurses\ndo not constitute a random sample. We interviewed the\nnurses during the working time of the mobile nurses.\nGrothmann et al. 5\nInterviews took on average 40 min. Answers of the inter-\nviewees were documented in note form by the interviewer\nduring the interviews.\nThe interview guideline (see the appendix) included 22\nquestions, was pretested, and was slightly adjusted based on\nthe pretest results. Similar to target group analyses in mar-\nketing research, we asked for information needs of the inter-\nviewees (Questions 17/18), perceived information needs of\nthose affected (Question 22), preferred information chan-\nnels (Question 19), and potential multipliers for heat and\nhealth information (Questions 20/21). Different from many\ntarget group analyses in marketing research, we tried to\nidentify determinants of the current protection, multiplying,\nand motivation behavior of the nurses (cf. differentiation of\nthree behavioral roles above: protectors, multipliers, and\nmotivators). We developed the respective questions mostly\nfrom current scientific knowledge regarding potential driv-\ners of and barriers to the three types of behavior. Primarily,\nthree theories guided the questions included in the inter-\nNAT (Schwartz, 1977). PMT has already been successfully\napplied to explain self-protective behavior regarding cli-\nmate change and natural hazards (e.g., Grothmann & Patt,\n2005). HBM is \"one of the most widely used conceptual\nframeworks in health behavior research\" (Champion &\nSkinner, 2008, p. 45) and has already been successfully used\nto explain self-protective behavior regarding heat extremes\nin Australia (Akompab et al., 2013). NAT has proven to be a\nvery useful theory to explain helping behavior in various\nsocial settings so that we expected some explanatory power\nalso for protective behavior of mobile health care nurses\nduring heat extremes.\nIt was not the aim of the target group analysis to test spe-\ncific theories of behavior or compare their explanatory\npower. Instead, the various theories and publications on pro-\ntective behavior were used to generate a list of potential\ndeterminants of protection, multiplying, and motivation\nbehavior to identify the statistically significant determinants,\nso that these could be addressed in the design of target group\nspecific communication formats. Mainly from PMT, HBM,\nand NAT, we included 14 potential determinants--drivers\nand barriers of the three types of behavior. Every potential\ndeterminant was addressed by one specific question (see\nthe appendix).\nFurthermore, the interviews included an open-ended\nquestion on the current behavior of the nurses (see Question\n14 in interview guideline). By this question, we expected to\ncapture information regarding all three types of behavior we\nwere interested in. Unfortunately, the answers of most inter-\nviewees related almost exclusively to protection behavior\nregarding their patients, not to multiplying and motivation\nbehavior. Hence, we could not calculate quantitative mea-\nsures of multiplying and motivation behavior, and in the\nstatistical analyses of the answers, we could only calculate\ncorrelations of one type of behavior, protection behavior,\nwith the potential determinants (see \"Results and Discussion\"\nof \"Target Group Analysis\" section).5\nAs the behavioral measure relied on self-reported infor-\nmation only, we were concerned about getting biased answers\ndue to a potential tendency of the interviewees to give\nsocially desirable answers (in this case: to report more pro-\ntection behavior than actually conducted). Therefore, we\nincluded also a question measuring the tendency to give\nsocially desirable answers (see Question 11 in interview\nguideline). As there was no correlation between the answers\nto this question and the self-reported behavior, we concluded\nthat the behavioral measure was not biased by a social desir-\nability tendency.\nAll answers to the open-ended questions were categorized\naccording to qualitative content analysis (Mayring, 2000).\nWe then quantified potential behavioral determinants\n(Questions 1, 4, 15, 16) and the behavioral measure (Question\n14). For example, the behavioral measure was generated by\ncounting the number of performed behavioral categories\n(e.g., shading the apartment, giving the patients something to\ndrink).\nFinally, we calculated Kendall correlations6 between the\nquantitative levels of the behavioral measure (Question 14)\nand the quantitative levels of the potential behavioral deter-\nviewed nurses. Multiple regressions could not be computed\ndue to the small sample size (N = 30) and the high number of\npotential determinants.\nResults and Discussion\nThe statistically significant correlations in Table 1 indicate\nthat the current protective behavior of the nurses is probably\ndriven by a perception of climate change, high control\nbeliefs, perceived role models for protective behavior, and\nprevious thinking about heat and health (positive significant\ncorrelations), whereas fatalism and perceived work stress\nobviously act as barriers to protective behavior (significant\nnegative correlations).7 We do not interpret these results as\ndirect influences of the statistically significant drivers and\nbarriers on the behavior. For example, the perception of cli-\nmate change might have led to an increased thinking about\nheat and health, which then led to an increase in protection\nbehavior.\nBecause almost all nurses (25 out of 30) answered with\nthe highest possible rating (6 = totally agree) to the question\nmeasuring the perceived personal norm for protective behav-\nior during heat, there was a lack of variance in this variable\nresulting in rather low correlations. Nevertheless, due to the\nvery high reported levels of this personal norm, we expect\nthat it also plays a role in causing protective behavior of the\nnurses. To the open question on barriers to protection behav-\nior, six nurses named financial limitations of their patients,\n6 SAGE Open\nfive named financial limitations of the mobile health care\nservice, and three mentioned the apartments of their patients\nthat are not adapted to heat.\nThe results also indicated that all interviewed nurses had\nexperienced heat events in the past, that most of them per-\nceive that their old patients suffer from heat, and that most of\nthe nurses also suffer from heat. They feel exhausted and/or\nstressed during heat waves because they have to work hard\n(e.g., lifting heavy patients) and their company car is heating\nup strongly as they often have to park in the full sun and\ndrive only short distances from patient to patient so that air-\nconditioning in the car has almost no effect or the company\ncars do not have air-conditioning yet.\nIt is likely that their experience of heat events in the past\nhad contributed to their relatively high existing awareness of\nheat-related health risks and to the result that all of the inter-\nviewed nurses reported at least two types of protection\nbehavior. Nevertheless, we detected strong interindividual\ndifferences: Some health care nurses seem to conduct much\nmore protective behavior than others. Hence, we regarded\nthe development of communication formats to further\nstrengthen and increase the protective behavior of the nurses\nas useful, especially of those who as yet show only low lev-\nels of such behavior.\nStep 3--Development of Target Group\nSpecific Communication Formats\nMethod\nThe design of communication formats to further increase the\nprotection, multiplying, and motivating behaviors of the\nmobile health care nurses strongly built on the results of the\ntarget group analyses and followed the logic to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 fulfill the expressed information needs and to reduce\nidentified gaps in knowledge and behavior,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 use the preferred information channels and multipli-\ners, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 address the identified drivers of and barriers to the\nbehavior. Hence, the communication formats that are\ndeveloped in Step 3 primarily target those perceptions\nand beliefs that proved influential as drivers of or bar-\nriers to behavior in Step 2.\nTable 1.

None of the interviewed nurses mentioned the\nregular measurement of the patients' body temperature or\nmedicine-related measures (heat-adapted dosing and stock-\ning of medicine) as their current behavior to protect their\npatients from heat-related health effects. Therefore, we\nwanted to develop communication formats that could pro-\nvide such detailed information (e.g., brochures and/or train-\ning workshops).\nOnly very few interview statements related to multiplying\nand motivating behavior. We concluded that, as yet, most\nnurses do not see themselves as multipliers (of knowledge on\nhealth risks and options for protective behavior) or motiva-\ntors of protection behavior among the patients and the\npatients' relatives. On the contrary, five interviewees men-\ntioned the relatives of their patients and three interviewees\nnamed the patients as barriers to the implementation of health\nprotection measures before and during heat extremes.\nTherefore, we identified the need to strongly support the\nnurses in their intended roles as multipliers and motivators.\nBased on these results, we intended to develop communica-\ntion formats that motivate the nurses for taking the roles as\nmultipliers and motivators (e.g., by stressing the high mortal-\nity among the elderly during heat waves in the past and by\neliciting feelings of solidarity with the elderly). Furthermore,\nthe communication formats should assist them in being\neffective in these roles (e.g., by training them in persuasive\nforms of communication and providing them with communi-\ncation formats such as flyers, which they could use in their\ninteractions with the patients and their relatives in motivat-\ning them to take protective actions).\nTo address mobile health care nurses as the primary target\ngroup and to also reach the secondary target groups, the\nelderly and their relatives, we selected and designed four\ncommunication formats: an expert workshop, a brochure,\nanimated videos, and a flyer. All formats have the same\nheading/slogan (\"Healthy Despite Heat\") and all visual for-\nmats (invitation letter for expert workshop, brochure, flyer,\nanimated videos) have a similar graphical design to allow the\nuse of the formats in an integrated communication campaign.\nThe formats are presented in more detail in Table 2. The\nselection of these specific formats was guided by the follow-\ning rules from communication practice:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 create a combination of formats that is suited to reach\nthe different target groups via established communi-\ncation channels,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 reach the target groups via various senses and activi-\nties (reading, listening, watching, speaking, etc.), and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 appeal to people on both the emotional and intellec-\ntual level (emotions were mainly targeted by the\nanimated videos whereas the other formats rather\naddressed knowledge aspects; cf. Slovic, Finucane,\nFurthermore, the selection of the four formats was deter-\nmined by the available financial and time resources for their\ndevelopment.\nTo address the identified statistically significant drivers of\nand barriers to the protection behavior of the nurses (see Table\n1), we included the following information in the communica-\ntion formats: Climate change and its relation to the increase of\nheat extremes is mentioned in all four communication for-\nmats to increase perceptions of climate change, which was\nidentified as a probable driver of protection behavior. To\nincrease control beliefs and decrease fatalism, the longest sec-\ntions of all four communication formats are devoted to pre-\nsenting the many options for protection, multiplying, and\nmotivating behavior. To increase the perception of role mod-\nels for protective behavior, we included a mobile health care\nnurse, who is very experienced in dealing with heat-related\nhealth issues, as one of the leaders of the expert workshop.\nThe animated videos were designed to present the risks and\nprotective options regarding heat extremes in a visually\nappealing way and to provide links to further information, so\nthat thinking about heat and health, another identified driver\nof protection behavior, is stimulated. To reduce the barrier of\nperceived work stress, which is probably partly related to the\nfact that the nurses themselves suffer from heat (see \"Results\nand Discussion\" of \"Target Group Analysis\" section), we\nincluded a section in the expert workshop devoted to the fol-\nlowing question: How can mobile health care nurses protect\nthemselves from heat-related health impacts and work stress\nduring heat events? Nevertheless, the high negative correla-\ntion between perceived work stress and protective behavior\nalso indicates that communication formats aiming at increas-\ning nurses' protective behavior will probably not suffice. In\naddition, interventions aiming at improving nurses' working\nconditions and reducing work stress appear necessary (cf.\nMcLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988)--interventions\nthat could not be planned in the CcTalk! project, which\nfocused on the development of communication formats.\nTo use the preferred information channels and multipliers\nmentioned by the nurses in the target group interviews, we\nfocused on distribution channels via the work hierarchy of the\nnurses. Twenty-four of the 30 nurses mentioned their superi-\nors as potential multipliers for heat and health information; 20\nnamed these superiors as very influential in their work area.\nHence, to reach the mobile health care nurses (the primary\ntarget group), we planned for communication formats to be\nsent to them by mail or email via superiors. To reach the sec-\nondary target groups--the elderly and their relatives--the\nmobile health care nurses are seen as important multipliers\n(see Step 1), for example, to distribute the flyer to their\npatients and relatives. Furthermore, the elderly can be reached\nby animated videos if these are shown on TV, depending on\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

Heat-risks-video, 2. Tips-for-heat-\nvideo.\nGrothmann et al. 9\ntheir health status. In the interviews, the nurses named TV as\nthe information channel mostly used by their patients.\nAs a central portal providing access to all developed\ncommunication formats, an existing Austrian website for\ninformation related to climate change adaptation (www.kli-\nmawandelanpassung.at/kwa_hitzevideos) is used. Here, the\nanimated videos (available only in German) can be watched\nvia an embedded YouTube link; the flyer, brochure, and the\nconcept for the expert workshop can be downloaded.\nIn the development of the four communication formats, a\ndefinition of specific objectives for each format has proven\nto be useful. Through the formulation of these format-spe-\ncific objectives, the work on the formats could be carried out\nin a more focused manner than without such objectives. The\ndefinition of these objectives was also a crucial basis for the\nsubsequent pretest of the communication formats, as this\npretest evaluated to what extent the objectives were achieved.\nThe objectives for the four communication formats are\nincluded in Table 3.\nStep 4 and 5--Pretest and Further\nImprovement of Communication\nFormats\nMethod\nNot only for a target group analysis, but also for a pretest of\nthe communication formats, a survey with members of the\nTable 3.

I think I would like to participate in it.\nI find it very convincing that the expert workshop shall be led by a medical doctor\ntogether with an experienced mobile health care nurse, who has a lot of experience\nwith health protection during heat events.\nNote. Objectives defined for the respective formats are marked by italics.\naDue to the restricted time frame for the focus groups, the concept of the expert workshop could only be presented and discussed superficially. Hence,\ninstead of assessing whether the workshop is reaching its objectives, the respective questionnaire assessed the willingness to take part in the workshop\nand the acceptance of the lead by a medical doctor together with an experienced health care nurse. Objectives of the workshop were (a) building further\nexpertise and motivation for protection, multiplying, and motivating behavior; (b) discussing and giving answers to questions related to health protection during heat;\nand (c) exchange of experiences and good-practice examples related to health protection during heat.\ntarget group(s) is necessary in most cases. In the CcTalk!\nproject, we chose to conduct focus group workshops (a form\nof group interview, which is often used in marketing research)\nas the concrete method for pretesting and gathering ideas for\nfurther improvement of our four communication formats\nfrom members of the target group. Only members of the pri-\nmary target group (mobile health care nurses) were included\nin these focus group workshops. Due to resource restrictions,\nwe could not conduct focus group workshops with members\nof the secondary target groups, the elderly and their relatives.\nTherefore, we did not only ask the mobile health care nurses\nin the focus group workshops how they evaluate the suitabil-\nity of the four communication formats for themselves but\nalso requested their opinions whether the formats are proba-\nbly suited for the elderly and their relatives.\nThe advantage of focus group workshops is that their imple-\nmentation is usually more cost-effective and less time-consum-\ning than performing individual interviews. Furthermore, such\nworkshops are well suited to developing new ideas for the\nimprovement of communication formats.Adisadvantage com-\npared with individual interviews is that the group process is\noften characterized by evolving conversation from initial topics\nof discussion, often meaning other topics are not discussed. To\nminimize the influence of such group specific discussion pro-\ncesses on the pretest results, we conducted two focus group\nworkshops with two groups of mobile health care nurses (one\nwith seven participants from Red Cross Austria, and another\nwith 11 participants from Caritas). Another disadvantage of\nfocus group workshops is that the evaluations of persons, who\nare shy in a group situation, are generally underrepresented in\nresults.\nTo utilize advantages and compensate for respective\ndisadvantages, we used a combined individual and group\nsurvey method in the CcTalk! project: closed-ended ques-\ntionnaires, which were completed individually by the par-\nticipants of the focus group workshops (to gather the\nindividual evaluations of the four communication formats),\nand open-ended discussions (to gather the collective evalu-\nations and develop ideas for further improvement of the\nfour communication formats). The 2-hr focus group work-\nshops were divided into four format-specific blocks of dis-\ncussion. At the beginning of each block, the format (e.g.,\nthe expert workshop) and respective target group(s) (e.g.,\nmobile health care nurses) were presented. Each partici-\npant of the workshop was then asked to individually com-\nplete a format-specific questionnaire, which assessed the\nextent to which the objective of the respective format was\nfulfilled according to her or his opinion (for questionnaire\nitems, see Table 3). Hence, the format specific objectives\nthat were defined in Step 3 of the five-steps methodology\nto carry out the design of the communication formats in a\nfocused manner were \"reused\" as evaluation criteria here\nin Step 4 of the methodology.\nFinally, the professional moderator of the workshop led a\ndiscussion on the following questions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What aspects (graphics, content, etc.) of the format do\nyou like?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What aspects do you not like?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What suggestions do you have for the improvement of\nthe format?\nThe discussions were tape-recorded and observed by two\nindependent observers who focused particularly on emotional\nexpressions (verbal and nonverbal) of the workshop partici-\npants, because emotions can indicate whether behavior is\nmotivated--the primary aim of the CcTalk! communication\nformats.8 The moderator visualized the main results of the dis-\ncussion on a flip chart, which helped to organize the discus-\nsion and also served as a summary of the discussion results.\nThe quantitative results of the questionnaire were ana-\nlyzed statistically (see Table 3). The two observer protocols\nand the flip chart protocol by the moderator were content-\nanalyzed (Mayring, 2000). Only if contents of these three\nprotocols were unclear or contradictory, the respective parts\nof the transcripts9 of the tape-records were included in the\ncontent analysis.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of the pretest indicated that most of the objectives\nof the communication formats could be reached (including\nthe motivation of protection behavior) but that some modifi-\ncations to the formats would be useful to further improve\ntheir effectiveness and practical usability. Table 3 includes\nthe individual questionnaire evaluations of the formats and\nindicates that most of the format objectives were largely ful-\nfilled in the opinion of the mobile health care nurses that\nparticipated in the focus group workshops. Only the fulfill-\nment of the brochure objective, to provide new information\nto the nurses, got an average rating of lower than 3 in one\nfocus group--a result which can be explained by the fact that\nthe participating nurses already showed a very broad knowl-\nedge regarding heat and health issues.\nThe results of the discussions indicated that the collective\nevaluations of the four formats were generally quite positive.\nRather drastic animations of heat-related deaths in the heat-\nrisks-video were received positively. Although the many\ndying animated characters were perceived as \"brutal\" or\n\"threatening,\" the nurses expressed that these drastic pictures\ncaught their attention but did not discourage them from tak-\ning protection measures. Accordingly, the observer protocols\nindicated that, of all communication formats, the animated\nvideos resulted in the highest number of expressed emotions.\nAfter showing signs of surprise and shock following the high\nEurope, the nurses expressed joy and hope watching later\nparts of the heat-risks-video. They also mainly expressed joy\nand hope watching the tips-for-heat-video.\nThe workshop participants had several ideas for further\nimproving the different formats. One idea was attractive to\nmany participants. It related to including a graphical presen-\ntation of the sun as an intuitive symbol of heat in the bro-\nchure, the flyer, and the invitation letter for the expert\nworkshop. Hence, in the revised versions of these formats, a\nsun symbol was included and acted as a further design ele-\nment present in all formats, thereby contributing to the\npotential use of different formats in an integrated communi-\ncation campaign.\nAn interesting and unexpected result of the discussions\nwas that some nurses disapproved of the idea to include a\nphysician in the expert workshop. They felt very well\ninformed and competent regarding heat-related health risks\nand health-protective measures so that they seemed uninter-\nested in listening to a physician in an expert workshop. Based\non this result, we decided to stress in the invitation letter for\nthe expert workshop that all participants of the workshop are\nseen as experts, and that the workshop is a venue for copro-\nduction of knowledge and mutual learning processes regard-\ning heat-related health risks and health-protective measures.\nOverall Discussion\nOne of the aims of the CcTalk! project was to develop com-\nmunication formats that have the potential to be more effective\nthan previous communicative public health interventions dur-\ning heat waves, which had only limited impacts and could not\nreach the most vulnerable groups (Bassil & Cole, 2010). The\nfocus group pretest of our communication formats indicated\nthat they were regarded as effective on various dimensions,\nincluding the motivation of protection behavior. We believe\nthat this positive evaluation in the focus groups was very much\nbased on our systematic five-steps methodology for develop-\ning communication materials, which build on a psychological\nunderstanding of determinants of protection behavior.\nNevertheless, we could not test whether our communication\nformats were more effective than conventional public health\ninterventions during heat waves, because the realization of a\ncontrol group with conventional communication formats was\nnot possible within the scope of this project.\nFurthermore, we wanted to address three gaps in previous\nscientific work and communication practice:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To address the lack of publications that link knowl-\nedge about influential perceptions (e.g., influential as\ndrivers of or barriers to protective behavior during\nheat extremes) in a particular group with the develop-\nment of communication formats that are able to\nchange these influential perceptions (e.g., increase\nthose perceptions that motivate protective behavior),\nwe have shown how the CcTalk! project--by building\non existing marketing methodologies (e.g., Maibach\net al., 2008)--systematically used the results of target\ngroup analyses on influential perceptions to develop\neffective communication formats that have the poten-\ntial to change the influential perceptions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Communication, not only in the domain of adaptation\nto climate change but also the public health domain,\noften lacks a systematic psychological understanding\nof the drivers of and barriers to human protective\nbehavior. Furthermore, results of psychological inter-\nvention research are not adequately used. We have\npresented how the CcTalk! project made use of results\nand theories of psychological research on human per-\nceptions and behavior regarding natural hazards and\nother health risks by including potential psychological\nbehavioral determinants known from psychological\nliterature in our interviews of the target group analy-\nsis. We then addressed the statically significant deter-\nminants in the design of our communication formats.\nFurthermore, we made use of results from psychologi-\ncal intervention research in the development of our\ncommunication formats (e.g., by including face-to-\nface forms of communication; cf. Mosler & Gutscher,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To address the lack of evaluations of communication\nformats in the domain of climate change adaptation\nand interventions regarding health risks of heat waves,\nwe presented how we evaluated our communication\nformats in focus group workshops (by using a com-\nbined individual and group survey method).\nAnother aim of this publication was to portray a five-steps\nmethodology to design communication formats that support\nthe motivation of protective behavior in various risk domains\n(e.g., climate change, natural hazards). Our application of the\nmethodology to design communication formats for stimulat-\ning health-protective behavior during heat extremes in\nAustria has shown that it proved useful for developing for-\nmats that are effective in raising awareness, building compe-\ntence, and motivating protective behavior with regard to\nheat-related health risks.\nOne particularly interesting result of the target group\nanalyses (Step 2) was that perceived work stress of the nurses\nobviously negatively influences their protective behavior.\nThis indicates that communication formats aiming at increas-\ning nurses' protective behavior will probably not suffice. In\naddition, interventions aiming at improving nurses' working\nconditions appear necessary (cf. McLeroy et al., 1988) so\nthat they have the time to conduct heat protective behavior\nsuch as washing patients' bodies with cool water.\nNevertheless, the five-steps methodology has some limi-\ntations. It does not provide exact rules, neither for the selec-\ntion and development of communication formats based on\nthe target group interview results nor for the improvement of\nthe formats based on the focus group workshop results. Here,\nthe CcTalk! project has shown that the development and\nimprovement of the communication formats do not only rely\non rational and scientific interpretations of the interview and\nworkshop results but also very much on the experience and\ncreativity of the designers of the formats.\nA further limitation of the methodology, as it was applied\nin the CcTalk! project, considers the samples of the target\ngroups. Neither the nurses in the target group interviews nor\nthe nurses participating in the focus group workshops consti-\ntuted representative random samples of all mobile health\ncare nurses in Austria. Generally, interviewing a representa-\ntive sample of a target group is possible (e.g., by representa-\ntive telephone surveys like they were conducted in the project\nKommEx10 in Germany), but is often relatively costly and\nwas therefore not possible within the resources of the CcTalk!\nproject.\nA final limitation we want to note here is that the pretest of\ncommunication formats by focus group workshops does not\nconstitute a valid effectiveness evaluation of communication\nformats. The evaluation of the formats in such a workshop is\nan artificial setting. In reality, formats such as flyers or bro-\nchures are not distributed and read in a workshop but people\nfind these in their mail or they are handed to them by col-\nleagues or friends.Amore valid evaluation of communication\nformats is a communication campaign evaluation that assesses\nthe level of awareness, competence, and/or behavior in a rep-\nresentative sample of the target group before and after a com-\nmunication campaign and controls for other factors that might\ncontribute to changes in awareness, competence, and/or\nbehavior. Such a communication campaign evaluation is pos-\nsible but is often not carried out due to its high costs.\nConclusion\nDespite its limitations, the five-steps methodology presented\nhere could and should be used by authorities when trying to\naffect people's behavior in a positive way by means of com-\nmunication--especially in the context of climate change\nadaptation or protective behavior regarding heat extremes,\nwhere such systematic methodologies are as yet very rare.\nSecond, the results also indicate that communication mea-\nsures alone will not suffice. Work stress decreased the nurses'\nprotective behavior. Therefore, also interventions improving\nnurses'working conditions appear necessary. This highlights\nthat communication measures should be part of systemic\nintervention strategies directed at changing interpersonal,\norganizational, community, public policy factors (McLeroy\net al., 1988), and infrastructures (e.g., urban greening to\ndecrease air temperature in urban areas) to reduce vulnerabil-\nities comprehensively.\nAppendix\nCcTalk!

The identification of target groups based on similarities in\nknowledge, awareness, and attitudes within each group--so\ncalled \"segmentation\"--is a more elaborate method for cre-\nating a list of target groups and is also recommended for\neffective health communication campaigns (Slater, 1996).\nNevertheless, segmentation is costly and was not possible in\nthe CcTalk! project.\n 4. The differentiation of these three behavioral roles--protectors,\nmultiplicators, and motivators--was developed in the CcTalk!\nproject.\n 5. Other studies that would like to build on the interview guide-\nline developed in the CcTalk! project should ask more explic-\nitly for the various types of behavior in question than it was\ndone here.\n6. Kendall correlations were better suited for our data than\nSpearman correlations due to our small sample size (N = 30)\nand the appearance of outliers in the data.\n7. This table also includes many interesting statistically signifi-\ncant correlations between the potential drivers of and barriers to\nbehavior.Asthesewereonlymarginallyrelevantforthedevelop-\nment of target group specific communication formats (see \"Step\n3--Development of Target Group Specific Communication\nFormats\" section), we do not discuss them there.\n8. The observers used a standardized manual of emotions for\nidentifying and coding the reactions of the participants.\nAlthough the observers were trained in identifying emotions\nand using the manual, it became clear during the focus group\nworkshops that it was very difficult to identify emotions by\nthe participating mobile health care nurses. Many of them did\nnot express any emotions, neither verbally nor nonverbally,\nprobably because they thought that this would be regarded as\nunprofessional.\n 9. All verbal statements during the focus group workshops were\ntranscribed. This work-intensive procedure proved unneces-\nsary in the course of the content analysis, which showed that\nthe two observer protocols and the flip chart protocol were suf-\nficient to document the main contents of the discussion.\n10. For information on this project (full title \"Ans\u00e4tze und\nErfolgsbedingungen in der Kommunikation zum Umgang mit\nExtremereignissen\") see https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/\npublikationen/ansaetze-erfolgsbedingungen-in-der-kommuni-\nkation (German only).\n11. These abbreviations refer to the theories of protective behavior,\nin which the respective potential behavioral determinants are\nincluded (see \"Method\" of \"Target Group Analysis\" section).\n12. The answers to this question had to be erased from the statisti-\ncal analyses because it measured a reasonable self-assessment\nof the knowledge regarding health risks and protective behav-\nior options rather than a maladaptive coping response.\n13. There was no theoretical foundation for including work stress\nin the interview guideline but the knowledge in the project\nteam of the working conditions of mobile health care nurses\nin Austria. We knew that work stress was an issue for many\nmobile health care nurses and hypothesized that this stress\ncould become a barrier to their protection, multiplicating, and\nmotivation behavior during heat waves.\n14. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Health Belief Model\n(HBM), and Norm-Activation Theory (NAT) differentiate\nself-efficacy and outcome-efficacy beliefs. To keep the inter-\nview guideline short, we decided to measure control belief,\nwhich measures self-efficacy and outcome-efficacy beliefs in\nan integrated manner.\n15. As the answers to the according question were highly depen-\ndent on the previous question regarding the current behavior\nof the interviewees, this confounded variable was not included\nin the correlation analyses (see \"Results\" of \"Target Group\nAnalysis\" section).\n16. The answers to this question were very limited because the\ninterviewees showed signs of interview fatigue when this\nquestion was asked. Consequently, the data on perceived barri-\ners were not included in the correlation analyses (see \"Results\"\nof \"Target Group Analysis\" section).\nReferences\nAbrahamse, W., & Matthies, E.
