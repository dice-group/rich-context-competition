Over a period of 30 weeks, the ABC showed fulminant\nlocal progression, with destruction of the bone, which led to an abrupt loss of function of the left\nhip. The standard tumour treatment protocol was followed. We performed embolisation of the\ntumour followed by a biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. The outcome was negative\nwith total destruction of the proximal third of the femur, despite repeating the embolisation.\nBecause of the unfavourable local progression, a second biopsy was performed and we recon-\nfirmed the initial diagnosis. The final decision regarding the therapeutic approach was total hip\narthroplasty with femoral reconstruction with a prosthesis. Following this treatment, the patient's\noutcome was favourable, with complete recovery of function and no local relapse.\n",

If\nABC has a large dimension, it tends to\ndeform the anatomy of the affected\nregion. When the aneurysmal cyst is in-\ncreased in volume, the main symptom may\nbe nonspecific pain in the concerned area.\nAll bones can be affected by this pathology,\nbut the proximal femur is most frequently\ninvolved.5 From a histopathological point\nof view, ABC can be classified into three\ntypes: conventional (vascular) type, which\nis a rapidly growing, extensive, damaging\nlesion, leading to cortical breach and soft\ntissue aggression; solid type, and a third\nmixed type of the other two types.6\nThe most commonly used radiological\ninvestigation for ABC is plain radiography.\nRadiography often reveals an extensive\ntumour-like osteolytic lesion, located in\nthe metaphyseal area of the long bones,\nwith no invasion of the growth cartilage,\nand is well separated from the adjacent\nsoft tissues.7 Magnetic resonance imaging\nscans regularly show an extensive tumour\nwith eccentric osteolysis and a polylobu-\nlated aspect with fluid-fluid levels.6 The dif-\nferential diagnosis for an aneurysmal cyst\ncan be essential bone cyst, giant cell\ntumour, osteoblastoma, and telangiectatic\nosteosarcoma.2 A biopsy is mandatory for\nan aneurysmal cyst because telangiectatic\nosteosarcoma needs to be considered as a\ndifferential diagnosis.\nThe classic procedure for ABC is a direct\napproach with opening of the cyst and its\ncurettage. However, because of the high re-\ncurrence rate associated with this type of\npies are added to the procedure. These ther-\napies include surgical cryotherapy,9 alcohol\nsclerotherapy,10 selective arterial embolisa-\nDenosumab is an innovative therapeutic\napproach, which inhibits osteoclast func-\ntion, and can have positive effects on the\ndevelopment of ABCs. The purpose of\ntreatment is to stop extension of the\nlesion, prevent pathological bone fractures,\nreduce relapse, and most importantly, stop\nThis case report describes the aggressive\ndevelopment of an ABC in a paediatric pa-\ntient. Regardless of the initial treatment, the\noutcome was unfavourable, which led to\nuse of a mega-prosthesis for replacing the\ntumour.\nCase presentation\nWe report a case of an 11-year-old girl who\npresented to the Emergency Department for\ndiffuse pain of the left hip after a fall. Her\nmedical and family history was unremark-\nable. A clinical examination showed mild,\ndiffuse swelling of the left hip. The swelling\nwas firm and non-tender, with moderate to\nsevere painful manipulation. This was asso-\nciated with pain-related decreased mobility\nof the hip. The patient was unable to walk.\nPlain radiography of the left hip in the fron-\ntal and lateral views showed an extensive\nosteolytic lesion in the proximal metaphy-\nseal femur and femoral neck with thin scle-\nrotic margins, with no invasion of the\ngrowth plate (Figure 1). Magnetic reso-\nnance imaging and a computed\ntomography (CT) scan of the hip showed\nthe presence of an ABC in the proximal\nthird of the left femur, with no extension\nin the adjacent soft tissue. Selective arterial\nembolisation was performed to devascular-\nise the tumour, promote healing, and de-\ncrease the risk of high bleeding during the\nbiopsy procedure. For this purpose, absorb-\nable gelatine sponge particles were used.\nA biopsy was achieved through a lateral\napproach centred on the greater trochanter.\nA hole was drilled at the inferior pole of the\ncyst, thus reaching the haemorrhagic lesion\nwhere blood and cystic soft tissue were\nobtained for a histopathological exam.\nAfter the diagnosis was confirmed,\nwe performed a second selective arterial em-\nbolisation to limit development of the ABC.\nThe patient's progress was favourable, with\ndecreased local pain, and she gradually\nregained mobility.\nOne month later, local progression of the\nABC was favourable. Radiographic find-\nings showed osteosclerotic margins at the\ntumour site. Pain in the left hip was further\ndiminished and the full range of motion was\nregained. At the 8th and 12th weeks of\ncheck-up, plain radiography was performed\nand showed no progression of the bone\ncyst. After approximately 16 weeks, the pa-\ntient experienced moderate local pain. An\nX-ray showed that the osteolytic process\nwas expanded (Figure 2). A second biopsy\nwas performed to exclude a potential malig-\nnant diagnosis, which could have been\nmissed. A biopsy specimen was also sent\nto another histopathological diagnosis\ncentre and the initial diagnosis was recon-\nfirmed (ABC vascular type). Furthermore,\nprogression of ABC was unfavourable.\nMassive growth of the lesion had resulted\nin total destruction of the proximal third of\nthe femur. The lesion expanded from the\ngrowth plate to 1 cm distally of the lesser\ntrochanter, with severe local pain and func-\ntional impairment. Three-dimensional CT\nFigure 1.

Unfortunately, the cyst\ncommunicated with the surrounding soft\ntissues. Therefore, sclerotherapy was\ncontraindicated.\nConsidering the fulminant evolution of\nthe lesion throughout 8 months (Figure 4),\nwe decided to perform radical treatment for\nthe tumour. We chose to excise the tumour\n(Figure 5). We used a reconstructive\nprosthesis of the proximal femur and total\nhip arthroplasty. The resection was wide,\nreaching approximately 2 cm distally to\nthe inferior pole of the cyst. The implant\nhad to insure the possibility of needing to\nreinsert the local muscular structures. For\nhip arthroplasty, we used a total unce-\nmented prosthesis. The acetabular cup was\nattached without a requirement for any par-\nticular preparation of the acetabulum.\nAt the 3rd week of follow-up, the\npatient's recovery was favourable and pas-\nsive movement of the left hip was regained.\nEight weeks later, the full range of motion\nand full weight-bearing were achieved\n(Figure 6). The 1-year follow-up showed\ngood progress with total recovery of func-\ntion, no local pain, and total weight-bearing.\nThe patient provided verbal consent for\ninclusion in this report. Approval for this\nreport from the ethics committee was not\nrequired.\nDiscussion\nAlthough the initial treatment of our pa-\ntient was in accordance with surgical proto-\ncols, development of the ABC was atypical.\nIn our case, there was rapid progression of\nthe lesion, leading to massive bone destruc-\ntion. Acute pain experienced by the patient\nFigure 3. Three-dimensional computed tomogra-\nphy reconstruction of the hip affected by aneurys-\nmal bone cyst\nFigure 4.

(d) Anteroposterior view after resection and reconstruction.\nwas resilient to medication and there was\ntotal loss of function.\nBlock resection has the best outcome and\nthe lowest rates of relapse for ABC, provid-\ning the best control over the lesion.\nHowever, this method has the highest mor-\nbidity rate because of intra- and\npostoperative complications, such as mas-\nsive haemorrhage, a high risk of infection,\npost-resection persistent pain, shortening of\nthe limb, growth defects, and muscular hy-\npotonia.13 Considering the high risk of local\ncomplications associated with open sur-\ngery,14,15 many surgeons choose less inva-\nsive techniques, such as sclerotherapy and\nEmbolisation is a minimally invasive\ntechnique that devascularises the tumour.\nEmbolisation can promote healing of the\ntumour and reduce intra- and postoperative\ncomplications of open surgery, offering the\nsurgeon a better approach in cases of total\nresection.18 Embolisation for ABC has a re-\nwith cysts that are larger than 5 cm.\nRepeated embolisation can have favourable\noutcomes in recurrent lesions. In our case,\nthe lesion persisted and became more ag-\ngressive, even though it had favourable pro-\ngression for a while after repeated\nembolisation. This finding is in contrast to\nsimilar cases where repeated embolisation\nFigure 5. Intraoperative photographs showing the macroscopic appearance of the lesion.

Post-reconstruction X-ray of the pelvis\nshows total hip arthroplasty with a tumour\nprosthesis.\nof ABC led to a successful outcome.19,20\nRossi et al.8 showed that 102 patients with\nABC treated by selective arterial embolisa-\ntion with N-2-butyl-cyanoacrylate had a\nhealing rate of 81.8% and a complication\nrate of 4.5%. They also concluded that, to\nbe effective, this procedure must be per-\nformed by an experienced practitioner\nwith good technical skills.\nSclerotherapy is a minimally invasive\ntherapeutic procedure for ABC with good\nlong-term results. This therapy slows devel-\nopment of the cyst and also lowers the risk\nof relapses. The most commonly used sub-\nstances for sclerotherapy are Ethibloc,\n9-Aetoxisclerol, doxycycline, pure alcohol\nin a liquid or gel state, and liquid nitrogen.9\nConsidering the high risk of soft tissue ne-\ncrosis due to pure alcohol, this procedure is\nnot indicated in cases where imaging data\nreveals a cortical break.21 In our case, three-\ndimensional CT reconstruction indicated\ncortical breakage, which was confirmed\nintraoperatively by fluoroscopic imaging\nafter administrating a contrast-enhancing\nagent.\nWith regard to the standard treatment\nfor ABC, reconstruction of the affected\narea with a tumour prosthesis of the\nfemur and total arthroplasty of the hip is\ninfrequent. This method is reserved for ag-\ngressive malignant tumours with a fulmi-\nnant evolution. The reason for postponing\nresection of the tumour mass is its location.\nThis situation is common and has specific\nIn paediatric patients, finding implants\nthat have the right size for the age group\nis difficult. Additionally, development of a\ndiscrepancy in lower limb length during\ngrowth leads to a series of re-interventions\non the implant to elongate it.23,24 Because\nof the small size of paediatric patients, they\nwould benefit from a custom-made endo-\nprosthesis. Additionally, in pathologies\nwhere removal of large portions of the skel-\netal structure is required, a customised\nimplant would be a possible solution.\nUnfortunately, we do not have this thera-\npeutic option in our clinic.\nThe system that we used in our patient\nwas a modular system that enabled the fem-\noral component to be extended.\nTherapeutic management started with a\nminimally invasive approach, attempting\nto conserve the bone capital and trying to\navoid complications associated with open\nsurgical techniques. Successive embolisa-\ntion excluded the possibility of using a vas-\ncular bone graft because of insufficient\narterial sources for grafting. In our patient,\ntotal arthroplasty of the hip was preferred\nover bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The reason\nfor this is because, in paediatric patients,\noccurrence of laminar coxitis is frequent,\nand revision of the implant might be re-\nquired in the near future with rehabilita-\ntion.25 Dysplasia, which appears in the\nremodelling phase, can produce supero-\nexternal migration of the prosthesis and\nmuscular imbalance between the hip's\nadductors and abductors.26 In a study on\n111 patients who underwent total hip re-\nplacement before 20 years old, the 10-year\nsurvival rate (without revision) was 70%,\nand the complications of osteolysis and at-\nrophy were observed.27\nConclusions\nThe therapeutic plan that was applied to\nour patient was in accordance with the\nlatest treatment protocols of minimally in-\nvasive techniques of embolisation.\nHowever, the unfavourable outcome of\nour patient led to block resection and pros-\nthetic replacement as a final solution.\nRepeated embolisation can achieve local\ntumour control, even in ABCs that show\nprogression after the first embolisation.\nHowever, in the present case, severe local\nsymptomatology and massive destruction\nof the proximal third of the femur led to a\nradical therapeutic approach.\nEven though there is a standard treat-\nment protocol for ABC, which uses a min-\nimally invasive procedure, treatment should\nbe individualised for each patient. This is\nespecially the case with aggressive local pro-\ngression of the tumour that disturbs the\npatient's function and quality of life for a\nlong time. A radical therapeutic approach\nprevents the risks of local recurrence and\npathological fractures.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
