Given the importance and\nwidespread use of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data for obesity\nresearch, we developed and tested the feasibility and validity of an empirically derived statistical correction for self-\nreport bias in wave 1 (W1) of Add Health, a large panel study in the United States.\nMethods: Participants in grades 7\u00ad12 with complete height and weight data at W1 were included (n = 20,175). We\nused measured and self-reported (SR) height and weight and relevant biopsychosocial factors from wave 2 (W2) of\nAdd Health (n = 14,190) to identify sources of bias and derive the most efficient sex-specific estimates of corrected\nheight and weight. Measured, SR, and corrected W2 BMI values were calculated and compared, including sensitivity\nand specificity. Final correction equations were applied to W1.\nResults: After correction, weight status misclassification rates among those who underestimated their weight status\nwere reduced from 6.6 to 5.7 % for males and from 8.0 to 5.6 % for females compared to self-report; and the\ncorrelation between SR and measured BMI in W2 increased slightly from 0.92 to 0.93. Among females, correction\nprocedures resulted in a 3.4 % increase in sensitivity to detect overweight/obesity (BMI  25) and 5.9 % increase in\nsensitivity for obesity (BMI  30).\nConclusions: Findings suggest that application of the proposed statistical corrections can reduce bias of self-report\nheight and weight in W1 of the Add Health data and may be useful in some analyses. In particular, the corrected\nBMI values improve sensitivity \u00adthe ability to detect a true positive--for overweight/obesity among females, which\naddresses a major concern about self-report bias in obesity research. However, the correction does not improve\nsensitivity to identify underweight or healthy weight adolescents and so should be applied selectively based on\nresearch questions.\n",

Self-reported (SR) height and\nweight are often used in population surveys when direct\nmeasurement is cost prohibitive, or when obesity is not\nthe primary focus of study, and have been found to have\nacceptable validity [3]. However, concerns about the val-\nidity of self-reported height and weight among adoles-\ncents remain, especially when BMI and weight status are\nthe main outcomes of interest. Researchers have consist-\nently noted that SR height and weight lead to underre-\nporting of obesity prevalence [4\u00ad6].\nObjective measurement of height and weight using a\nstandardized protocol is more reliable than self-report\nand should be incorporated in study designs whenever\npossible [5]. However, large cohort studies that began\ndata collection prior to the rapid rise in obesity \u00adand\nthat have since increased the rigor of biometric\nmeasurement \u00ad often contain information not available\nelsewhere. An example of valuable self-reported height\nand weight data is in the first wave of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add\nHealth). Add Health is the largest on-going national co-\nhort study of adolescents originally enrolled in US public\nsource of information and potential knowledge about\npsychosocial and biological risk and resilience related to\nweight trajectories, weight loss behaviors, obesity, car-\ndiovascular health, diabetes risk, and metabolic syn-\ndrome. Although both measured and self-reported data\nwere collected in Waves 2, 3, and 4, Wave 1 (W1) con-\ntains only self-reported height and weight data. This\nlimitation has plagued obesity researchers because of the\npressing need for longitudinal analyses of these types of\nunique cohort data collected prior to the rapid rise in\nobesity in the US. The foresight of the Add Health study\nteam to begin collecting measured height and weight in\nW2, and yet to also continue collecting self-reported data\nfor comparisons, provide unique opportunities to study\nthe relationship between measured and self-reported\nheight and weight that have not yet been fully exploited.\nSeveral prior studies have examined the validity of\nself-reported height and weight in the Add Health data\n[3, 8] but none have proposed a statistical correction.\nFor example, using W2 of the Add Health data, Goodman\nand colleagues found a high correlation between self-\nreport and measured weight (r = .95), height (r = .94), and\nthat self-report height and weight in W1 of the Add\nHealth data were sufficiently valid [3]. Although it found\nthat girls underestimated their weight by an average of\nparticular recommendations for a statistical adjustment to\ncorrect for the observed self-report bias were made at that\ntime [3]. In contrast, statistical corrections of SR bias have\nbeen recommended [9] and widely disseminated for many\nAdditionally, the high average correlation between\nself-report and measured BMI among a large sample of\nadolescents may be falsely reassuring \u00ad it may cover up\nvalidity issues among known subgroups for whom the\ncorrelations between measured and self-report data are\nhigher or lower than average. For example, numerous\nstudies have found that overall, self-report tends to over-\nestimate height and underestimate weight relative to\nmeasured values, and weight underestimation is highest\namong those with overweight or obesity [1, 4, 9]. Given\nthe increasing public health importance of the Add\nHealth data as a source of characterizing obesity trajec-\ntories and risk factors over time and the value of using\nall waves of available data, identifying and testing statis-\ntical correction equations for reducing self-report height\nand weight bias in W1 of Add Health would enable re-\nsearchers to determine if and under what conditions it\nmay be warranted to apply a correction.\nPurpose of study\nWe sought to examine the feasibility and validity of a\nproposed statistical adjustment to correct or mitigate\nbias in self-reported height and weight in a large, widely\nused nationally representative panel study of adolescents\nin the US. Specifically, this study aimed to adjust statisti-\ncally for the self-report bias in W1 BMI, based on empir-\nical knowledge of the relationship between self-reported\nand measured BMI at W2. Candidate predictors in-\ncluded demographic, biometric, and psychosocial vari-\nables. First (H1), we hypothesized that by using\nmeasured and self-reported (SR) height and weight and\na wide range of relevant background in wave 2 (W2), it\nwill be feasible to identify efficient regression models to\npredict measured height and weight at W2 from self-\nreported values at W2 for males and females.\nSecond (H2), we hypothesized that the corrected\nheight and weight values at W2 will provide a better es-\ntimate of true (i.e., measured) height and weight than SR\ndata alone. Third (H3), when corrected height and\nweight values are used to calculate BMI percentiles and\nclassify cases by weight status, this will result in a lower\nrate of misclassification of weight status classification\nthan would SR data alone in W2 among those who\nunderestimated their weight status. Finally, the correc-\ntion procedures developed from W2 can then be applied\nto SR height and weight in W1 to generate corrected\nheight, weight, BMI, and weight status at W1. The pro-\nposed corrections (H4) are expected to reduce bias in\nSR height and weight and if so, will mitigate the obesity\nunderreporting bias from self-report that has been docu-\nmented in the literature.\nMethods\nData and participants\nWe used Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health,\nwere in grades 7\u00ad12 at W1. In order to maximize the util-\nity of the proposed procedure for a wide range of Add\nHealth data users, as few exclusion criteria as possible\nwere applied. Participants with complete height and\nmissing values on candidate predictors used for statistical\nshown in Table 1. The use of secondary data was approved\nand deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at\nthe authors' institution.\nMeasures\nDemographics\nAge was calculated in months from date of birth and\ndate of interview at W1 and W2. Sex at W2 was used\nTable 1 Sample characteristics at Wave 1 among participants with complete self-reported height and weight information at Wave 1,\nshown by sex\nTotal Female Male\nCharacteristics (range) N % or M(SD) N % or M(SD) N % or M(SD)\nRace/ethnicity\nParent education\nWeight status\nBody size estimation\nHigher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and self-esteem. Weight status at Wave 1 is based on body mass index calculated\nfrom self-reported height and weight. Sample sizes do not always equal 100 % due to missing values. Sample sizes are shown in raw numbers; percentages are\nweighted to the US population\nM Mean, SD Standard deviation, HS High school, NH Non-Hispanic, AA African American, CES-D Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\nbecause the variable was cleaned by Add Health staff\nand is the most complete; all descriptive tables are strati-\nfied by sex. Race/ethnicity at W1 was by self-report. Par-\nent highest education was drawn from the parent survey\nat W1 and missing data were filled in with the adoles-\ncent's report of parents' highest education at W1. All\nother candidate predictors were measured at both time\npoints.\nHeight, weight, and body mass index\nSelf-reported height and weight were collected at both\nwaves. Measured height and weight were also collected\nat W2. Height and weight were examined separately to\nobtain predictive regression equations for each variable.\nBody mass index was calculated by the standard formula\n(kg/m2); for participants under age 20, SAS macros were\nused to apply the US sex and age adjusted growth charts\n[14, 15] to obtain age and sex specific BMI percentiles\nand weight status classifications as follows: underweight\n(UW < 5th percentile for age and sex); healthy weight\n(HW = 5th to < 85th percentile); overweight (OW = 85th\nto < 95th percentile); and obesity (OB > = 95th percentile).\nFor this study, calculations of BMI (or BMI percentile)\nand weight status assignment were made based on mea-\nsured height and weight at W2, self-reported height and\nweight at W1 and W2, and corrected height and weight at\nPuberty\nPerceived physical maturity was measured with a self-\nassessment item (range 1\u00ad5) of pubertal development\namong males and females as follows: How advanced is\nyour physical development compared to other boys/girls\nyour age? Response set included: I look... younger than\nmost, younger than some, about average, older than\nsome, older than most. Although other indicators of\npuberty were available (e.g., menarche for girls, voice\nchange for boys), subjective physical maturity taps into\nself-image [16] in that could affect self-reported weight\nor height, and it provides a common assessment for both\nsexes.\nPsychosocial factors\nBody size estimation was assessed with the following\nitem: How do you think of yourself in terms of weight?\n[very underweight (UW), slightly UW, about right,\nslightly overweight (OW), very OW]. Very and slightly\nUW were collapsed, and very and slightly OW were col-\nlapsed to yield a three level class variable for body size\nestimation (UW, About right, OW). Accuracy and in-\naccuracy of body size estimation were tested for inclu-\nsion in the prediction model but were dropped as non-\ncontributing factors. Depressive symptoms were assessed\nat each wave with the Center for Epidemiological Studies\nDepression Scale (CES-D) [17]. Self-esteem was mea-\nsured with a 6-item adaptation of Rosenberg's 10-item\nself-esteem scale scored on a 4-point scale [18]. The 6-\nitem adapted scale was developed by the Add Health re-\nsearch team [19], and has been found to be unidimen-\nsional and have good reliability [20]. Sample items were:\nYou have a lot of good qualities and You have a lot to be\nproud of. Response categories ranged from 1 to 5\n(Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree), and items were\nrecoded as needed so that higher scores reflected higher\nself-esteem. Self-rated health was assessed with a single\nitem, developed by the original Add Health research\nteam and scored on a 5-point scale: In general, how is\nyour health? Would you say... Response categories\nranged from 1 to 5 (excellent, very good, good, fair,\npoor) and were reverse coded so that higher scores re-\nflect greater self-rated health. This item is nearly identi-\ncal to that used in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item\nShort Form (SF-36): \"In general, would you say your\nhealth is\" with the same response categories [21]. Diet-\ning to lose weight was assessed with two items. First, all\nparticipants were asked, \"Are you trying to lose weight,\ngain weight, or stay the same weight?\" [Response cat-\negories: lose weight, gain weight, stay the same weight,\nnot trying to do anything about weight]. If participants\nmarked that they were trying to \"lose weight\" or \"stay\nthe same weight\" then they were asked a follow up ques-\ntion: \"During the past seven days, which of the following\nthings did you do in order to lose weight or to keep from\ngaining weight?\" Participants then marked yes/no to a\nlist of weight loss strategies, including dieted, exercised,\nmade yourself vomit, took diet pills, or took laxatives in\nthe past 7 days. If participants marked \"dieted in the\npast 7 days,\" they were coded as dieting to lose weight.\nStatistical analysis plan\nAll final analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2.\nLongitudinal population sample weights and survey pa-\nrameters were applied to adjust for the complex survey\ndesign of Add Health. We exploited the availability of\nboth measured and self-reported height and weight in\nW2 to develop a statistical correction for the self-\nreported weight and height in W1. First, we fit the W2\nmodel and conducted model selection; we then applied\nthe W2 model to W1 data to obtain statistically cor-\nrected values, as described in more detail below.\nIn the first stage, we fit two linear regression models\nwith response variables being W2 measured weight and\nmeasured height and we used all candidate predictors.\nCandidate predictors were characteristics known to\ninfluence perceived body weight or height, including\nself-reported height and weight, sex, age, puberty status,\nrace/ethnicity, parent education, depressive symptoms,\ndieting, body size estimation, self-rated health, and\nself-esteem at W2. We then used the Akaike Information\nCriterion (AIC) to select the most efficient predictors of\nmeasured height and weight values without overfitting the\ndata. We also tested two-way interactions between all\nsignificant predictors for each regression model. Cat-\negorical predictors were treated as class variables in\norder to generate a single regression equation. Final\nmodels for weight (model 1) and for height (model 2)\nare shown in Table 2.\nIn the second stage we applied the final two regression\nmodels to W1 SR weight and height in separate analyses.\nThen, we calculated a corrected BMI score from the cor-\nrected height and weight values for each case. We then\nused the corrected BMI scores to estimate corrected\nweight status. For adolescents under age 20, we used\nBMI percentiles derived from the CDC sex and age ad-\njusted growth charts [14] and SAS macro program [15]\nto calculate BMI percentile and assign weight status. For\nthose 20 years and older, we used the standard formula\nto calculate BMI [kg/m2] and adult cutoffs for weight\nstatus.\nFinally, we calculated Pearson correlations, sensitivity/\nspecificity, and misclassification rates between measured\nand corrected weight status among males and females.\nMisclassification rates are presented in a contingency table\ncomparing weight status based on actual (measured) vs.\ncorrected BMI. In this context, the misclassification rate is\ndefined as the proportion of subjects whose self-reported\nTable 2 Final multiple regression models predicting measured height and weight at Wave 2 from self-reported height, weight, and\nother candidate factors at Wave 2\nMeasured weight at wave 2 Measured height at wave 2\nWeight status by SR (HW)\nBody size estimation (About right)\nRace/ethnicity (White)a\nReference groups are shown in parentheses.

Rates of weight status misclassifica-\ntion after correction among males and among females can\nbe summed overall or across each type of misclassification\n(over or under estimation) by summing values above or\nbelow the diagonal that represents \"true\" classification\n(see Table 4). For example, weight status underestimation\ncan be calculated by summing misclassification rates from\nthe upper diagonal of the contingency table (Table 4).\nResults\nFindings provided support or partial support for each\nhypothesis. Our first hypothesis concerned the feasibility\nof identifying an efficient model for predicting true\nheight and weight in W2. To adjust for bias in self-\nreported (SR) weight and height, we used measured\nweight and height at W2 as the response variables, and\nregressed against candidate predictors (demographic,\nbiometric, and psychosocial) at W2 using linear regres-\nsions (Table 2). A range of factors influenced measured\nweight (Table 2, Model 1) and height (Model 2). After\nAIC model selection, 9 contributing factors were\nretained in Model 1 for weight: self-reported weight,\nage, puberty, weight status, body size estimation, dieting,\ndepressive symptoms, self-rated health, and self-esteem\n(R2 = 0.91). Race/ethnicity did not contribute to the effi-\nciency of the prediction of measured weight in Model 1\nand so was removed. For predicting measured height at\nW2 (see Table 2, Model 2), all candidate predictors\nshown in Table 2 were contributing factors (R2 = 0.89).\nIn addition, we tested two-way interactions between all\nsignificant predictors for each model, but none were\nretained during the AIC selection process as contribut-\ning factors and so are not shown in Table 2.\nOur second hypothesis was also supported. We hy-\npothesized that when the above correction procedures\nwere applied to SR data in W2 and used to compute\ncorrected BMI, the corrected BMI values would provide\na better estimate of measured BMI than SR data\nalone at W2. Pairwise Pearson correlations between\nBMI scores \u00adderived from measured, self-reported,\nand adjusted height and weight in W2\u00ad were calculated.\nBefore correction, the correlation between self-reported\nplying the correction procedure, the correlation between\nmeasured BMI and corrected BMI increased slightly to\n0.93, indicating the proposed correction yielded estimates\nthat were closer to the true values than SR alone.\nWe also calculated and compared sensitivity and speci-\nficity of self-report and corrected BMI in W2 using\nmeasured BMI W2 as the reference. Table 3 shows the\nsensitivity and specificity before and after applying\nthe correction. For males with overweight or obesity\n(BMI  25), the sensitivity increased slightly from 87.7\nto 88.0 % (<1 % increase); for males with obesity\n(1.8 % increase) with a small loss in specificity. Among fe-\nmales, after correction the sensitivity increased 3.4 % for\noverweight or obesity, and increased 5.9 % for obesity. In\naddition, the confidence intervals (SR and corrected) in\nTable 3 show no overlap among females in the over-\nweight/obesity group but a slight overlap among females\nin the obesity group. However, non-overlap in confidence\nintervals may not be a reliable method alone to assess stat-\nistical significance [22] because they are heavily influenced\nby standard deviations. Thus both percent change and\nconfidence intervals should be considered. With the in-\ncrease in sensitivity after correction, we found small de-\ncreases in specificity among females for overweight/\nobesity group (1.8 %) and obesity group (0.6 %); and these\ndifferences are smaller than the percent gains in sensitiv-\nity, suggesting an overall improvement of the proposed\ncorrection. Since the general concern is that SR bias un-\nderestimates incidence of overweight and obesity [1, 6],\nand there are tradeoffs with sensitivity and specificity, im-\nprovement in sensitivity is the most desirable change we\nwould expect when attempting to correct for SR bias in\nheight and weight.\nThe third hypothesis was that using the proposed cor-\nrected SR height and weight to calculate a corrected\nBMI would result in a lower rate of misclassification of\nweight status than would SR data alone in W2 among\nthose who underestimated their weight status, and this\nwas partly supported. As shown in Table 4, overall the\npercentage of misclassification for each weight status\ncategory was small after applying the correction. Using\nmeasured BMI as the standard, the cumulative misclassi-\nfication rate after the correction among underestimators\nwas reduced to 5.7 % for males and 5.6 % for females,\nwhich was lower than the misclassification rate based on\nSR alone (6.6 % and 8.0 %, respectively, not shown).\nFinally, our fourth hypothesis was that the correction\nprocedure \u00adderived from empirical prediction models in\nW2 using both measured and SR data \u00ad could be ap-\nplied to the SR height and weight data in W1 to yield\ncorrected height, weight, BMI, and weight status vari-\nables that may reduce the SR bias documented in the lit-\nerature among adolescents. The correction procedure\nwas applied to yield W1 corrected BMI values and W1\ncorrected weight status classifications. Since there is no\nobjective reference to W1 true height and weight, only\ndescriptive weight classifications based on W1 SR and\ncorrected BMI are shown in Table 5. As shown, 3 %\n(n = 295) of females who self-reported as HW were\nwho self-reported as OW were reclassified as OB after\nthe correction. Among males, less than 1 % (n = 86) were\nreclassified from HW to OW and 1 % (n = 101) of males\nTable 3 Sensitivity and specificity of BMI based on self-reported and on proposed corrected height and weight at Wave 2 by sex, using measured values at Wave 2 as the\nreference standard\nSensitivity (%) [95 % CI] Specificity (%) [95 % CI] Positive Predictive Value [95 % CI] Negative Predictive Value [95 % CI]\nSR Corrected SR Corrected SR Corrected SR Corrected\nMale\nFemale\nProposed statistical adjustments were applied separately to height and weight prior to calculating the corrected BMI.

We described a rigorous statistical approach\nto mitigate the bias introduced by self-reported height and\nweight in Wave 1 of the Add Health data through statis-\ntical adjustment. Because the Add Health longitudinal\nstudy provides a sufficiently large sample size, many\ncandidate predictors, and both self-reported and mea-\nsured weight and height in W2, we were able to for-\nmulate a comprehensive model based on the most\nsalient predictors of discrepancy between self-reported\nand measured values. We then tested the sensitivity\nand specificity of the W2 corrected BMI, compared\nto the W2 true (measured) BMI, and identified the\nmost efficient prediction model to apply to self-reported\nvalues at W1.\nAlthough numerous statistical corrections for self-\nreported height, weight, or BMI have been developed\nand published for other population data sets among ado-\nfound none that were recommended for Add Health. It\nis critical that statistical adjustment models and predic-\ntion equation coefficients be dataset specific, or at least\ncountry and population specific [24], unless the samples\nare truly comparable (e.g., nationally representative of\nsame population in the same year).\nThe statistical correction described here can be used\nin two ways. First, if a study intends to draw from the\nfull W1 sample and overweight or obesity are the out-\ncomes of interest, the equations and coefficients (Table 2)\ncan be applied as described. Second, if an obesity ana-\nlysis is planned that will draw upon a smaller, distinctive\nanalytic sample, such as foster youth or youth with\nsame-sex partners, then the procedures outlined here for\nbuilding, testing, and applying sex-specific prediction\nmodels to obtain corrected BMI scores can be followed\nbut tailored to a particular subpopulation in Add Health.\nFinally, studies based on other sources of data can use\nthese general principles and procedures to develop BMI\ncorrections for other datasets.\nA limitation of the study is that there was a one year\ndifference between W1 and W2, so although the predic-\ntion models were based on W2, it is possible that factors\ninfluencing self-reported height and weight at W1 and\nW2 were not the same. Another limitation was missing\ndata: the W2 correction equation could only be built\nupon cases with complete data. Finally, these statistical\ncorrections are conservative and so have a relatively\nTable 5 Weight status classification comparison between BMI\nbased on corrected and self-reported height and weight at\nWave 1, shown by sex\nCorrected W1\nSelf-reported\nn % n % n % n % Total\nMale\nFemale\nBolded values on the diagonal represent the the number and percent of cases\njointly classified as that weight status by both methods (self-report and\ncorrected self-report BMI)\nUW underweight, HW healthy weight, OW overweight, OB obesity, BMI body\nmass index\nTable 4 Weight status classification comparisons between\nmeasured and corrected BMI by sex at Wave 2\nMeasured BMI weight status W2\n(%)\nCorrected BMI weight status W2 UW HW OW OB Total\nMale\nFemale\nBolded values on the diagonal represent the percent of cases that were jointly\nclassified in the same weight status category by both methods (measured and\ncorrected BMI).

Despite limitations, when obesity\nis modeled as an outcome, applying this statistical correc-\ntion does appear to reduce SR bias and improve sensitivity\nfor detecting obesity in W1 of the Add Health data, par-\nticularly among females. If the outcome of interest is de-\ntecting underweight or normal weight only, the correction\nwould offer little advantage.\nConclusion\nIn summary, findings in this study address a growing\nconcern about bias in self-reported height and weight\namong adolescents, specifically the underreporting of\nobesity. Using unique features of a well-known and\nwidely used US national data set, we developed and\ntested a formula to statistically adjust for observed self-\nreport bias in height and weight among adolescents,\nusing a wide variety of characteristics to account for\nhow each affects self-report bias on average among male\nand female adolescents. The resulting corrections were\nused to compute corrected BMI scores and weight status\nclassification. Corrected values improved sensitivity \u00adthe\nability to detect a true positive--for obesity among\nfemales, which addresses a major concern about self-\nreport bias in obesity research. Corrections did not im-\nprove sensitivity to detect underweight or healthy weight\nin adolescents of either sex, so the correction should be\napplied selectively, depending on the research questions\nand outcomes of interest.\nAbbreviations\nBMI: Body mass index; HW: Healthy weight; OB: Obesity; OW: Overweight;\nSR: Self-reported; UW: Underweight; W1: Wave 1; W2: Wave 2\n"
