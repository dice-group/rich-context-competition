Social\nmedia have become closely embedded in the routines of millions of users, blurring for-\nmerly distinct boundaries between private and public information and between produc-\nplatforms open up possibilities for users to inform themselves about what is happening,\nthey also provide avenues to engage with such information within their social networks,\nfor instance through commenting, liking, or sharing. This way, social media can act as\nspaces for \"public connection,\" providing users with shared frames of reference that\nenable them to engage and participate within their cultural, social, civic, and political\nnetworks in everyday life (Couldry et al., 2010).\nThis article explores the various ways in which social media, messaging apps, and\nFacebook groups, in particular, facilitate people's public connection within groups,\nfocusing on the significance of news and journalism. Traditionally, news has been con-\nsidered one of the primary tools to create shared frames of reference to public life, foster-\ning community between individuals and facilitating social integration within groups\ngence of social media platforms and their connective potentialities give rise to questions\nof how this relationship is impacted (Hermida, 2014). Although Facebook remains the\nmost frequently used social network worldwide and thus attracts most scholarly attention\n(Stoycheff et al., 2017), studies such as the 2017 Reuters Digital News Report show that\npeople are increasingly using messaging apps for news (Newman et al., 2017). Covering\n36 countries, it notes that while the uptake of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger varies\nsignificantly between regions, overall, 23% of respondents indicated they find, share, or\ndiscuss news through messaging platforms; the trend is toward people moving from rela-\ntively open (i.e. Twitter, public Facebook timeline) to more closed (i.e. messaging apps)\nsocial media. While undoubtedly informative, the individualized, survey-based limita-\ntions of such studies mean we still know very little about the experiences and rationales\nunderlying people's engagement with news in those spaces. A complicating factor is that\nmessaging apps are what Madrigal (2012) describes as \"dark social media\": sites that\nhandle user traffic without adding referral data when a user clicks a link. This makes it\ndifficult to track what type of news content is shared on them, much less how it is\ndiscussed.\nThis study therefore employs focus groups to gain greater insights into how and why\npeople use news and journalism to connect in such semi-private spaces, which by their\nnature oftentimes involve more \"active\" sociability and communicative participation\nthan open social media. Moreover, focus groups allow more explicit consideration of the\nSwart et al. 3\nimpact of community type and social norms on such practices. As Heikkil\u00e4 and Ahva\n(2015) note, detailed studies on news practices that take social contexts into account\nremain scarce. This study therefore bases its focus groups on three common types of\nnetwork in which people know each other both online and offline--geographic (local-\nity), work-related, and leisure-based groups--to uncover the individual and group-based\nexperiences of news use, the impact of social media, and how these interweave and influ-\nence one another. Capturing the significance of news and journalism for continuing to\nfoster public connection demands considering not only what issues people connect over\nand the practices they engage in to do so, but also how connection is embedded in their\neveryday lives and the value that connecting has for them. This article accordingly\nfocuses on four analytical angles to the concept of public connection (inclusiveness,\nengagement, relevance, and constructiveness) to emphasize these lived experiences,\nallowing us to capture if and how news becomes meaningful rather than starting from\nnormative presuppositions on why it should be (see Swart et al., 2016).\nPublic connection, news, and social media\nTraditionally, news has functioned as an important avenue for public connection (Couldry\nthemselves as almost obligatory points of passage to find out what is happening outside\npeople's private worlds. Social media are not that different, in that respect. However, on\nsocial network sites, the patterns of news use sustaining public connection are less pre-\ndictable. News use in the era of mass media witnessed many people connecting through\nthe same product, distributed at relatively the same time, raising awareness and sparking\nconversation through people's relatively shared patterns of exposure to news content\n(Couldry, 2003). On social media, however, people co-create individualized timelines by\nfollowing specific accounts and adjusting personal settings, and the distribution of infor-\nmation is subject to greater variance. That exposes them to a composition of content\nthat--at least theoretically--can be unique for every user. Such shifts take on greater\nsignificance when considering how people engage with public affairs. Previous research\nsuggests that people tend to make sense of public issues within their personal networks\n(Barnhurst, 1998; Ekstr\u00f6m, 2016). The way people communicate using digital technolo-\ngies potentially changes those dynamics of public connection.\nThe concept of public connection starts from the assumption that people do not navi-\ngate through everyday life as atomized individuals, but are part of larger networks. For\nexample, they may share a language (cultural frameworks), vote for the same party\n(political), volunteer at the same organization (civic), or enjoy leisure activities together\n(social). Public connection is about the general orientation that individuals share toward\none or multiple of those public frameworks, which oftentimes overlap (Kaun, 2012; Ong\nand Caba\u00f1es, 2011).1 Previous literature on public connection has highlighted such\nshared frames of reference as necessary starting points for public engagement and par-\nticipation (Couldry et al., 2010; Dahlgren, 2000). While the idea of public connection is\nemployed beyond the field of communication and media studies, a significant body of\nwork focuses on the role of (news) media as tools to connect individuals to public life\nWhile such connection through news can happen individually, studies show that many\nmediated public connection practices take place within social groups (Barnhurst, 1998;\nHeikkil\u00e4 and Ahva, 2015). A long tradition of scholarly work has addressed those social\ncontexts in which news is used (Peters, 2012), the connective potentialities it may have\n(Couldry et al., 2010), and the dynamics between journalism and the communities it\nMeans, which concluded that newspapers are not only important to readers because of\ntheir content but also the daily sense of connection to the world they provide, and Katz\nand Lazarsfeld's (1955) Personal Influence, which stressed the critical function of inter-\npersonal communication and social networks for issue awareness. Such considerations\nstill hold sway in the digital era: recent studies confirm that people continue to make\nsense of news within specific social contexts that are essential to their public connection\n(e.g. McCollough et al., 2017; Schr\u00f8der, 2015). The use of news as a tool for public con-\nnection, in other words, dates back far before the launch of MySpace or Twitter.\nLikewise, while the rise of social media has highlighted the potentialities of news to\ncreate a sense of community within social groups, the idea that mediated news practices\ncan facilitate social connections between individuals is far from new (Hess and Gutsche,\n2018). For instance, the integrative role that television has traditionally played within\ndomestic settings, supporting the relational structure of the family, has been widely dis-\nbeen found to serve as \"a catalyst for conversation and human contact\" (Bogart, 1989:\n169) within social groups, particularly in local communities (see Hoffman and Eveland,\n2010 for an overview). However, the digitalization of the news media landscape and the\nrise of social media alter these connective potentialities of news.\nThis article builds upon and applies a conceptual framework we developed to study\nrecent shifts in mediated public connection (Swart et al., 2016). We specifically consider\nfour key aspects which transform through the ways digital technologies allow people to\nbridge their private and public worlds. The first is the notion of inclusiveness: what\nissues do citizens connect over within their communities and who is part of such connec-\ntion? Earlier research has found that people frequently discuss and make sense of national\nand international news, local affairs and economic issues with others, within a variety of\nsocial settings (Wyatt et al., 2000). Social media allow such discussions to occur continu-\nously, regardless of physical co-presence, and can demarcate spaces for mediated public\nconnection, for example through closed Facebook and WhatsApp groups. This poten-\ntially affects the news'socially integrative function, although it is important to recognize\nthat participating in news discussions is not always affirmative (Couldry, 2003); discuss-\ning public affairs can serve to challenge social norms within groups or be perceived as\nsomething that potentially precipitates social disharmony (Ekstr\u00f6m, 2016; Thorson,\nSecond, social media have opened up new forms of engagement with news. People\ncan choose from a large array of platforms that support following others and exchanging\npublic information to foster sociability within one's social groups. Those platforms, in\nturn, facilitate a myriad of emergent news practices (Costera Meijer and Groot Kormelink,\nSwart et al. 5\nresembling community journalism (cf. Reader, 2012) to sharing news articles with col-\nleagues on WhatsApp as conversation starters (Van Damme et al., 2015).\nThird, because social media involve novel patterns of engaging with and consuming\nnews, it obtains a different place within the flow of daily life, changing the relevance of\nconnecting publicly. Earlier studies show that people engage in news talk to support vari-\nousrelationalstructures,fromthefamilytogroupsoffriendsandcolleagues(Boczkowski,\n2010). Social media facilitate such connection, continuously and anywhere. Also,\nthrough mobile technology groups can use social media to constantly monitor the issues\nthat may affect those in their community (cf. Schudson, 1998; Zaller, 2003). That may\nfoster a sense of security, similar to the rituals of daily newspaper reading observed by\nBerelson (1949). Moreover, social media allow people to easily share such concerns and\nquickly reach everyone within their networks (Hermida, 2014).\nFinally, new opportunities for engagement and the increase in publicly available\ninformation may affect the constructiveness of public connection, changing what inter-\nests connecting through news may help people advance within various social groups\n(Couldry et al., 2010). For instance, private Facebook groups centered around common\ninterests or other shared characteristics such as location can serve as tailored news feeds\nthat automatically filter the news for information that is most useful for people in that\nsocial group (Hess and Gutsche, 2018). Such spaces for \"news curation\" can help users\nto avoid news overload and minimize the user activity required to reach articles of inter-\nThese transformations encourage renewed attention to the ways that people perceive\nthe efficacy of social media to connect to public life, and the role that news and journal-\nism play in this regard. A vast body of literature discusses how media in general (Deuze,\nbecome closely and inextricably embedded in everyday life (e.g. Baym, 2015; Jenkins\net al., 2013; Lu and Hampton, 2017). Of course, news is only part of the information that\nis spread on social media. That said, Reuters' Digital News survey found that 54% of\nrespondents report using social media for news every week (Newman et al., 2017).\nPrevious work has extensively analyzed the importance of social media relative to other\nnews sources and the extent to which people use them to find news (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and\nValenzuela, 2011; Nielsen and Schr\u00f8der, 2014). Until now, however, limited attention\nhas been paid to the communicative and social meanings of news within people's every-\nday networks and the influence of social media in that respect.\nMethodology\nSix focus groups were conducted in three different cities across The Netherlands, from\nSeptember to November 2016. Focus groups help uncover how people construct and\nnegotiate meanings collectively within groups about a certain topic by simulating every-\nday forms of conversation and generating both points of consensus and difference\n(Kitzinger, 1994; Lunt and Livingstone, 1996). In this case, our research interest was in\nhow news on social media may or may not be valuable for groups as a tool for public\nconnection. The Netherlands is an interesting context to study mediated public connec-\ntion on dark social media platforms, as it is one of the countries where SMS and MMS\nwere expensive for a long time. Therefore, the use of messaging apps to share informa-\ntion quickly became widespread with their emergence as a cheap alternative (Van der\nVeer et al., 2016). For accessing news in particular, The Netherlands ranks in the middle\ncategory below countries such as Malaysia, Brazil, and Spain, but far above the United\nKingdom and the United States (Newman et al., 2017).\nEvery group consisted of participants who knew each other personally and communi-\ncated through social media at least twice a week. We selected a variety of groups, includ-\ning both territorial/geographical and relational/interest-based communities (Gusfield,\n1975), and incorporating both groups that were formed by members themselves and\ngroups created in a top-down manner. Two were work-related (high school teachers, IT\ncustomer support department), two were organized around leisure activities (football\n[soccer] team, a student association) and two were location-based (local volunteers,\ngroup of neighbors).3 Five groups used WhatsApp as their major social network to com-\nmunicate, the neighbors used Facebook, and some groups relied on other media to com-\nplement their communication (i.e. Google Hangouts, Slack, and email).\nIn total, 40 people participated, equally divided in terms of gender. The youngest\nrespondent was 18 years old, the oldest was 66. People with higher vocational or univer-\nsity-level education were overrepresented in the sample. The first and fourth focus group\nconsisted of six participants, the second, third, and fifth had eight, and the final had four.\nParticipants were recruited through snowball sampling (Heckathorn, 2011), focusing on\nrecruiting individuals who were then asked to encourage their colleagues, friends, neigh-\nbors, or acquaintances to participate. The focus groups took place at locations that were\nmost convenient for the group (e.g. participants' homes, offices, and club house). On\naverage, the sessions lasted 100 minutes. Snacks and soft drinks were provided. In return\nfor their participation, each participant received a 20 gift card.\nThe sessions were moderated by the first author, using semi-structured questions to\nguide the discussion. As an ice breaker, participants were all asked to introduce them-\nselves and describe how they knew each other and formed the group. Then, four main\nthemes were addressed: (a) patterns of social media use by the group, (b) the role of\nsocial media in facilitating public connection, (c) the content shared on those platforms\nthey felt was relevant and important to others in the group, and finally (d) the role of\nnews and journalism for facilitating public connection on social media. Thus, only in the\nsecond half of the session was the discussion focused on news and journalism, to avoid\npresupposing its centrality for people's everyday public connection (Couldry, 2003).\nAlso, the concept of news was not defined beforehand, to allow participants to construct\nand negotiate their own interpretation.\nAll sessions were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and then coded line-by-line using\nAtlas.ti to identify central themes. Second, focused codes were developed by testing the\nmost frequent of these initial codes against the entire data set. Finally, rereading the\nmaterial, theoretical codes were formed and tested. Multiple themes emerged throughout\nthe process, for example relating to social media group dynamics, the various affordances\ndifferent social media platforms have for users, and the informative uses of social media.\nThis article specifically focuses on the role of news for facilitating connection within\nthese groups' social networks. For privacy reasons, the names of the participants have\nbeen replaced by pseudonyms.\nSwart et al. 7\nResults\nOur results show that understandings and practices of public connection vary consider-\nably between different communities, depending on the communicative aims of the group\nand associated deployment of social media platform affordances. In turn, how group\nmembers experienced the four dimensions of mediated public connection we distin-\nguished--inclusiveness, engagement, relevance, and constructiveness--also differed.\nInclusiveness\nThe dimension of inclusiveness considers the issues people connect over and who they\nconnect with. The groups of social media users selected for the focus groups all under-\nstood themselves as communities, displaying a sense of personal relatedness, a feeling of\nmattering to the group, and a belief that members shared a connection through mutual\nexperiences, common places, and time spent together (cf. McMillan and Chavis, 1986).\nAlthough social media were only one avenue facilitating that sense of community, they\nwere vital to the daily communication between members in all focus groups. Moreover,\nthose digital conversations were closely interwoven with the group's social contact in\nnon-virtual situations, mediating shared offline experiences by taking pictures and vid-\neos at get-togethers or linking back to discussions on social media in face-to-face\nsettings.\nAll groups mentioned how exchanging information on social media fostered sociabil-\nity. However, they showed great variation in the content sustaining that sense of belong-\ning and what was considered \"news\" within their community. Sometimes, shared content\nwas based on common interests: news in the Facebook group of the neighbors, for exam-\nple, included upcoming events at the local community center, local crime, and other\nissues that in principle could be reported in local news media but were typically too\nsmall-scale to generate media attention. Their Facebook group was a way to stay on top\nof local issues and increase community attachment (cf. Hoffman and Eveland, 2010).\nLikewise, for the teachers, the topics discussed--for example, refugees, human rights,\nand environmental issues--strongly related to the content of their classes. In other\ngroups, however, type of community and the topics of the conversations were unrelated.\nFor the IT colleagues, discussing public issues had little to do with their job, but was\nsimply considered an enjoyable activity part of being a team. Topics therefore could be\nvery broad, seamlessly flowing from personal conversation to public affairs topics (cf.\nWyatt et al., 2000) and ranging from science to feminism to the US elections. Similarly,\nthe soccer team rarely discussed sports news. Their social media communities had a dif-\nferent purpose: arranging logistics, organizing team activities, and sharing gossip to fos-\nter sociability. The soccer team considered sharing journalism content irrelevant exactly\nbecause it was news: thus, everyone would already have heard about it.\nWhile Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Valenzuela (2011) suggest that large and heterogenic net-\nworks tend to generate more civic activity, our results were mixed. For the IT team, their\ndiverse personal interests and political affiliations were a reason to discuss news in their\nWhatsApp group: it was generic enough that all members in the group could talk along.\nMoreover, others were likely to have different points-of-view and could thus provide\nalternative perspectives. The soccer team, however, thought that in a large group with\ndiverse interests, news was unlikely to interest everyone. Thus, they would rather forward\nstories to specific group members instead of posting it in their WhatsApp community.\nThe content connected over also varied between social media platforms, depending on\ntheir degree of openness. The privateness of WhatsApp made it suitable for socializing\nand discussing interpersonal news and stories about shared personal interests without fear\nof embarrassment, fostering togetherness within the group. To connect beyond the group's\nboundaries, however, participants employed more open platforms such as Twitter, the\npublic Facebook timeline, or LinkedIn, both actively by posting information about charity\nevents (soccer team), promoting their businesses (volunteers) or sharing vacancies (teach-\ners), and more passively, scrolling through their feeds to monitor news (Schudson, 1998;\nZaller, 2003). Regarding the latter, the teachers and IT team discussed how on Facebook\ncontent does not necessarily stem from one's own connections and liked pages, but can\noriginate from outsiders too. Although they worried Facebook's filter bubble may shield\nthem from alternative political information, they also noted the platform made them stum-\nble on \"surprise content\" (Kim et al., 2013) they might not have normally discovered. The\nprivate Facebook group of the neighbors was a compromise, enabling them to limit mem-\nbership to people in the area making members feel safe to post, while still creating a\ndiverse community that would bring in different types of information.\nThe extent to which news and journalism were included in everyday communications\non social media thus varied per group and platform. Yet, even in communities where\n\"news\" was close to traditional journalistic conceptualizations, only a selection of stories\nwould be included:\nStephanie:\nWhen I open my NOS [public broadcaster] app now, there\nare five things that make me think: it's interesting, but I'd\nnever post it in the group, because it [...] may be news\nwithin The Netherlands, but it's not news for us. [...]\nCharlotte:\nJust like these two cops and the chokehold, then I think: I\nknow about this, but I won't share it, because it's already on\nthe news, I'd say. I think that's it, because the articles we\nshare aren't on the news or the news bulletin.\nMarloes (approvingly): Uh-huh.\nNicole:\nThose don't have news value, because they're too silent.\n(Teachers)\nPreferably, stories would address long-term developments and allow members to\nexplore multiple perspectives or aspects of a certain problem. The IT team, for instance,\ndiscussed a news story about the Dutch parliament voting for a bill making all adults\norgan and tissue donors unless they explicitly opt out, exploring not only its political, but\nalso ethical and legal dimensions:\nLisa:\nI think it's logical that everyone wants to become a donor. But when\nwithin my own group people already say: I have a different opinion,\nthat's much more interesting, because I didn't expect that. I understand\nthat people are against, but-\nSwart et al. 9\nNiels:\nBut the fun thing about our group is that you can just say that. Like I\nsaid, there were people who thought their right of self-determination\ngot compromised, with a whole story behind it. There's a principle\nunderlying that. They aren't necessarily against people becoming a\ndonor, or whatever, there's a principle behind it I think everyone of us\ncan relate to. (IT team)\nRather than considering separate news reports, participants made sense of public affairs\nby connecting several news events and weaving them into one coherent story. One-time\nincidents that did not invite any further engagement were seen as less appealing. What\nnews becomes included in communities' shared frames of reference thus depends both on\ngroup considerations--what news it considers to be of collective interest, and norms about\nwhat news should be consumed collectively or individually--and content characteristics.\nEngagement\nThe dimension of engagement pertains to the question of which forms of accessing and\ninteracting with news people perceive as \"engaging\" or \"disengaging.\" The group of the\nneighbors considered reading and liking each other's contributions in the Facebook\ngroup to be ways of being engaged within their local community. Likewise, the IT staff\nused their WhatsApp debates about public issues as a means to become integrated in the\nteam and get to know each other better through \"playful connection\" (Kaun, 2012). For\nthe fraternity and soccer team groups, however, engaging with news or public informa-\ntion was perceived as an individual practice completely detached from their groups'\nmain communicative purpose for using social media. That did not mean they had less\ninterest in current affairs: most of them were frequent news consumers, just not in that\nparticular social context. Conversely, many teachers considered the news boring, yet\nthey would frequently share public issues on social media. Thus, as other studies have\nfound (Andersen and Kristensen, 2006; Swart et al., 2016), interest in public issues and\nnews use did not necessarily relate. Moreover, group dynamics evidently shaped the\nperceived appropriateness of engaging with news in those contexts.\nBeyond context and group dynamics, differences in technological affordances of the\nused social media platforms also contributed to distinct patterns of engagement. Most\ngroups employed specific social platforms for a designated purpose: the teachers, for\ninstance, used Google Hangouts to ask quick work-related questions, but would discuss\nlong-term tasks via email. Similarly, Slack helped the IT team to retrace and archive job-\nrelated conversations, and the leisure-oriented groups employed private Facebook groups\nfor organizing group activities so they could tag members to assign tasks. Interestingly,\ngroups would sometimes interpret the same technical affordances of platforms differ-\nently. For example, WhatsApp groups present users with a single stream of messages in\nwhich posts easily get buried under the hundreds of other daily messages. For the student\nassociation, this lack of hierarchy made the medium unfitting for discussing public\nissues, as they could only reply to all group members instead of tagging specific people.\nFor the IT team, however, it supported the explorative nature in which they would dis-\ncuss news. For them, discussing news events was typically part of a longer-lasting con-\nversation: topics of interest, such as the US elections, would come into the dialogue\nwhen relevant news would appear, move out again, to be referred back to during a next\nevent. WhatsApp supported that form of public connection.\nAcross all focus groups, the relative publicness of the Facebook timeline made par-\nticipants cautious when engaging with content. Replicating previous studies (Ekstr\u00f6m,\n2016; Marwick and boyd, 2014), our respondents perceived posting on public Facebook\ntimelines as expressing one's unconditional opinion, forever retraceable for potentially\nanyone:\nKim:\nI'm only inclined to share something when I feel really certain about it.\n[...] Sometimes people think I'm making a statement, while [I'm not].\nThen I'm sort of entering into a debate, and then it seems you're the\none with the statement. And then I think: that's not what I meant. [...]\nMichelle:\nSometimes I haven't fully read an article. Then I'd like to discuss it\nwith someone, but I don't want to come across as--\nKim: A know-it-all.\nMichelle: Yes.\nIris: Or someone who doesn't fully understand it. (Soccer team)\nEven liking posts was perceived a considerable endorsement, as liked content also\nshows up on others timelines and affects one's online image. Tagging, presenting stories\nas completely detached from oneself, was more common. Contrary to the definitive\nstatements on Facebook, discussions on WhatsApp were more explorative in nature.\nSharing a news story here did not automatically equate to approval, but could simply be\na conversation starter:\nJelle:\nIn our group, when something is shared, it's shared because someone wants\nto discuss it.\nLisa: Yes, by someone who holds a strong opinion.\nMark: More to talk about it than to share it, I think.\nNiels:\nThat's what I like: something is shared that practically everyone already\nknows in our app group, but the nice thing is that people will discuss it and\nyou can see what others think. (IT team)\nParticipants rarely shared news on WhatsApp to be the first to report breaking events;\nthey were more likely to hear first through Facebook or other platforms. Rather,\nWhatsApp provided a safe space to make sense of news (Chambers, 2017), discover the\neveryday impact of stories and discuss potential solutions. While being engaged in the IT\nteam community thus required frequent posting and responding, for the neighbors, read-\ning and liking others' contributions already constituted active engagement.\nRelevance\nThe dimension of relevance addresses how and why news becomes embedded within the\nflow of everyday life. In some social media groups, such as the teachers', the relevance\nof shared news was closely tied to the group's identity. Not being able to talk along with\nother staff, parents, or students made them feel unprofessional. Since they had joined\nsocial network sites, they felt better informed about public issues and more confident and\nengaged. This knowledge benefit arose from passive scanning and observing (Schudson,\n1998; Zaller, 2003) rather than from active uses that expressly deploy the communicative\ncapabilities of social media platforms to create informational networks, such as in the\nneighbors' community. For them, actively sharing information about local affairs was a\nway to be a considerate neighbor (cf. Hoffman and Eveland, 2010; Reader, 2012), a favor\nto others that was expected to be returned. For the soccer team and volunteers, conversa-\ntions were not so much linked to the group's goals, but instead centered around fostering\na sense of community:\nJacob:\nYou share experiences more frequently. When you're not here tonight,\nyou will receive a few messages via your phone that we are there and hav-\ning fun. So when you're not there, you still feel connected to the group.\n[...]\nPieter:\nWe're immediately informing everyone in the entire club. [...]\nAlbert:\nWe're getting everyone involved. Everyone becomes part. That's a huge\nadvantage. (Volunteers)\nThe soccer team and student association likewise used WhatsApp to mediate shared\nexperiences and activities, foster friendship, and involve group members.\nThe platform most closely embedded in everyday life was WhatsApp. The soccer\nplayers and IT team would exchange hundreds of messages per day, nurturing almost\ncontinuous online socialization with colleagues and peers next to frequent offline\nencounters. For the teachers and volunteers too, conversations originating on WhatsApp\nwould regularly extend into offline talk or vice versa, blurring boundaries between online\nand offline togetherness (Bakardjieva, 2003). While facilitating sociability, this practice\nalso sometimes caused feelings of information overload, and a feeling that constant par-\nticipation was expected. Group communication on Facebook, compared to WhatsApp,\nwas much less frequent and more formal. Finally, the public parts of Facebook were used\nto connect individually to people outside participants'communities, by monitoring time-\nlines passively. For instance, most teachers checked Facebook daily to stay on top of the\nnews, but posted a screenshot or link on WhatsApp to share a story.\nConsistent across groups was a shift in the relevance of social media platforms for\nconnecting socially. Participants noticed their friends would rarely update their Facebook\nstatus anymore. Instead, their timeline had become heavily institutionalized:\nStephanie:\nI check my Facebook timeline twice a day. Nowadays there are few\npeople who say something personal. Most often, it's articles, and of\ncourse it depends on which friends share things, but often I find them\ninteresting.\nMarloes: I do that too, but not through Facebook.\nEsther:\nYes, I hardly check Facebook anymore. [...] There's so much coming\nin within a day. I'm happy that the people I know don't share articles\nthrough [Facebook], that'd be just too much. (Teachers)\nWhile still convenient for some participants' in their daily routines, for others, this\nperceived shift diminished Facebook's relevance, driving them away and disconnecting\nthem from the everyday life connections it formerly helped to afford. Talk on chat apps,\nalternatively, having technological boundaries preventing pushed content going viral\nwere viewed primarily and positively for their sociality. Although users shared links to\nnews stories, WhatsApp discussions focused on participants' own opinions rather than\nthird-party content. Although such a shift to closed social media environments may knit\npeople's interpersonal networks closer together, it simultaneously constrains possibilities\nfor linking communities to wider spheres. \"Dark platforms\" might therefore limit the\ndiversity of news sources and political opinions that users are exposed to, raising ques-\ntions about the democratic value of connecting through those spaces (cf. Thorson, 2014).\nConstructiveness\nFinally, social media serve as additional information sources and offer many new modes of\nengagement. The dimension of constructiveness addresses what ends this may help users\nachieve. For the teachers and neighbors, connecting through social media had direct ben-\nefits in line with the group's raison d'\u00eatre. The news stories the teachers shared through\nWhatsApp would sometimes be used as educational material in class. The neighbors\nexchanged upcoming events in the area to encourage local participation, from leisure activ-\nities to more politically oriented meetings. One participant recalled how another neighbor\nhad informed her of a municipality meeting on new cycling routes through the neighbor-\nhood, which she had attended to voice her opinion. For the volunteers, the constructiveness\nof social media news was not linked to their identity as charity workers, but to many mem-\nbers being entrepreneurs. While news was rarely discussed within their group, individually\nthey employed Twitter and Facebook to follow niche sources, keep an eye on their compe-\ntition, and promote their companies. For other groups, the constructiveness of connecting\nthrough news was less self-evident. The IT department considered discussing public issues\nand trying to understand the way news events relate to each other entertaining in itself. For\nthe soccer players, news--although rarely shared within their group--indirectly helped to\nestablish common grounds they could link to in conversations (cf. Boczkowski, 2010;\nBogart, 1989; Couldry et al., 2010). Finally, for the student association, using news was an\nindividual activity separate from their social engagement. They rarely discussed public\naffairs online or offline, nor in other social contexts, and found that news had little every-\nday value beyond the practicalities of weather and traffic information:\nNick:\nWhen you don't know what has happened, you don't need to spend any\ntime on it. It's not like [news] makes you do or not do certain activities.\nKoen:\nOften it doesn't, but for example, we were in Utrecht for the weekend\nand the trains weren't running. [...] If I'd read it in advance, I could've\ntaken it into account. So it's more the small, practical things that you\ntake away from it. Whether Trump or Clinton won a debate, that\ndoesn't matter to me. (Fraternity)\nA distinction can be made between the constructiveness of platforms for connecting\nwithin one's community and connecting individually transcending the group's\nboundaries. The work-related groups mentioned news stories in their WhatsApp chats\nonly occasionally, as a conversation starter or to illustrate a point. In the neighbors'\nFacebook group however, they were central to discussion. On the public Facebook time-\nlines, news media were even more dominant, showing up even when participants did not\nactively follow or search for them. They felt Facebook had evolved into an information\nhub rather than a space for public engagement, making the teachers and IT team move to\nWhatsApp for those purposes. The soccer players perceived the increasing presence of\nnews companies in their timelines as troublesome: Facebook for them primarily fulfilled\na social function. Moreover, they criticized news media for focusing on harvesting clicks\ninstead of providing valuable information.\nAt the same time, across focus groups, participants mentioned their difficulty of\ndefining the trustworthiness of news on social media, as it would frequently originate\nfrom unknown sources (cf. Tandoc Jr. et al., 2017). Moreover, several groups discussed\nhow the acceleration of the news cycle on digital platforms increased the risk of errors.\nGroups like the IT team therefore regarded the presence of journalists and news media\non social media to be essential: without having anyone distinguishing facts from fiction\nand protecting people from misinformation, they noted, news would lose its value, as\nthere was little opportunity for users to define news stories' accuracy. To them, journal-\nists' selection gave news a privileged position relative to other content. That position\nmade news a common ground, constructive for everyday talk and participation both\ninside and outside the groups' communities.\nConclusion\nThe specific practices of news audiences on dark social media, in terms of topic selec-\ntion, story preference, sharing, and so forth, are challenging to measure through conven-\ntional analytics software, meaning that research has had trouble generating meaningful\ncomparisons with other ways that people \"get the news.\" Moreover, our understanding\nof the experiential and meaning-making aspects for people encountering news on mes-\nsaging apps and in Facebook groups is nearly non-existent. What research has revealed\nto date tends to analyze the personal, informative uses of social media for news on the\nlevel of the (aggregated) individual through surveys (Newman et al., 2017; Nielsen and\nSchr\u00f8der, 2014). However, the results above emphasize the continuing importance of\ncommunities and social interaction for the way people encounter and make sense of news\n(Barnhurst, 1998; Heikkil\u00e4 and Ahva, 2015), their public connection practices on dark\nsocial media included. Our results show that some of these communities act as safe\nhavens or spaces of encouragement to share or discuss news, even though the collective\nrationales underlying these practices differ. This article accordingly argues that engage-\nment with current affairs on messaging apps and Facebook groups cannot be reduced to\nusers' individual behavior, but is foremost a social practice whose meaning needs to be\nconsidered at the level of the group.\nEmploying WhatsApp and Facebook groups, our participants created their own online\nspaces to facilitate continuous connection within their communities through the exchange\nof information, each with their own understanding of inclusiveness, engagement, rele-\nvance, and constructiveness. Although community type (geographic, work-related, and\nleisure) played some role in shaping how members conceived of and engaged with news\nwithin the group, the uptake and the experiences of discussing journalism within these\ncommunities more strongly depended on the groups' communicative aims. For the IT\nteam, playfully discussing current affairs was a means to social integration. The fleeting\nnature of WhatsApp supported their explorative ways of making sense of public issues.\nFor the neighbors, sharing local affairs was a substitute for community journalism.\nFacebook allowed them to connect a large, weak-tied group through neighborhood news\non a platform they all already used actively as individuals. The teachers' WhatsApp\ngroup similarly acted as a news curation service, but with a stronger focus on utility,\nforming a highly specialized news channel with potential class content. Dark social\nmedia use by the volunteers or fraternity, however, viewed the sharing of news as a clear\nbreach of social norms--a means to public disconnection. For those group members,\nsocial media was meant to facilitate relaxed sociability, and news didn't fit these aims.\nLikewise, the soccer players' messaging app was primarily a logistical tool, where\ndebates about news would distract from the pragmatic goal of organizing the team. In\nsum, groups specifically employ dark social media for designated purposes, which shape\nnorms about the value of news and journalism in such communities.\nWhile studies indicate an international trend of users moving to dark social platforms to\nget news (e.g. Newman et al., 2017), this study helps to specify and qualify exactly what\nthis means in terms of experiencing and relating to public issues through such practices.\nDark social media allow users to discuss news with people they trust in a private environ-\nment. Their technological affordances thus may cater to people's identities as colleagues,\nfriends, or neighbors, but their relative detachment from broader \"publics\" simultaneously\nmakes them less suitable for connecting beyond community boundaries, complicating the\nnotion of public connection itself. Similar to the face-to-face news discussions in private\nsettings that dark social media communities supplement, classic democratic functions\nattached to news media, such as allowing the public to witness oneself and facilitating con-\nnection between various communities (Coleman and Ross, 2010), are less self-evident\nwhen engagement with news occurs behind closed doors. The democratic implications of\nthe increasing popularity of dark social media for news, thus, still remain unclear.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: This article is part of the research project \"The New News Consumer:\nUser-based Innovation to Meet Paradigmatic Change in News Use and Media Habits,\" funded by\nThe Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and 10 leading news organizations,\nunder grant number CI1-12S027.

For instance immigrants often manage multiple orientations, circulating between different sen-\ntiments regarding the homeland and host country (Ong and Caba\u00f1es, 2011). Likewise, one's\ngender, religion or ethnicity may traverse political, civic, social, and/or cultural boundaries.\n2. Although few authors explicitly use the term \"public connection,\" the concept is employed\nimplicitly in a wide range of scholarly work within media and journalism studies, political\ncommunication and related fields, for instance in work on civic culture, cultural citizenship,\nsocial capital, civic engagement, and participatory democracy. These are discussed at length\n3. While the main reasons for the groups'existence, in practice, these were not hard distinctions:\nfor instance, some colleagues would engage in leisure activities from time to time.\nReferences\nAndersen J and Kristensen N (2006) Between individualism and community.
