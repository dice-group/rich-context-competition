It is therefore important to identify\nfactors that influence hematocrit. Although androgens are known to\nstimulate hematopoietic cells, it is unknown whether circulating sex\nsteroid hormones affect hematocrit. The association between serum\nsex steroid hormone concentrations and hematocrit in men aged\n$20 years was evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 1273 men in\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad\npercentile), and mean hematocrit. Men with low free testosterone\nlevels had a lower hematocrit than men with normal free testosterone\nlevels (P 5 .03), although no relationship was found between total\ntestosterone level and hematocrit. The relationship between sex\nhormone\u00adbinding globulin (SHBG) and hematocrit was complex, with\nboth low (P , .001) and high (P 5 .01) SHBG levels associated with\nlower hematocrit in men aged $20 years and only high (P 5 .01)\nSHBG levels in men aged $50 years.

Specifically, anemia, defined as low hemo-\nglobin (,13 g/dL), is associated with an increased risk of\nfalls and fractures, cognitive impairment, mortality, and\ndecreased physical ability (Penninx, 2007). Anemic men\nolder than 85 years had more than twice the risk of\ndeath than men without anemia (Izaks et al, 1999).

It is well documented that with increasing age,\nserum testosterone concentrations decline in men and\nthe prevalence of clinically low testosterone levels\nincreases (Harman et al, 2001). There is some evidence\nthat suggests that androgens raise hematocrit.

However, these\nstudies have focused on select populations (eg, pubescent,\nhypogonadal, castrated, and elderly men), effectively\nassessing the association among men with very high or\nlow levels of testosterone. Estrogen levels also decline\nwith age in men, although not to the same extent as\ntestosterone levels (Orwoll et al, 2006). There is no known\nmechanism by which estradiol directly increases hemat-\nocrit; however, estradiol may blunt the effects of hypoxia-\ninduced erythropoietin expression (Mukundan et al,\n2002). In addition, men have higher age-matched hemo-\nglobin concentrations than women at particular altitudes;\nthis effect is seen after puberty but is not evident at\npostmenopausal ages (Leon-Velarde et al, 2000).\nWe hypothesized that sex steroid hormone levels in\nmen, in both diseased and healthy populations, are\nassociated with hematocrit levels, leading to alterations in\nrisk of clinical and subclinical disease, respectively\n(Figure). In this study, we evaluated the association\nof serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and their\nmain binding globulin, sex hormone\u00adbinding globulin\n(SHBG) with hematocrit across the full male adult age\nrange using data from a national population-based study.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population\nNHANES III, a cross-sectional study of the US population\nNational Center for Health Statistics.

Whole blood was collected in tubes containing\nEDTA, and a complete blood count was performed (Gunter,\n1996). Hematocrit was calculated using a Coulter S-Plus Jr\nelectronic counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Florida)\nSex Steroid Hormones\nSex steroid hormone concentrations were measured in blood\nsamples that were centrifuged, aliquoted, and subsequently stored\nat 270uC in Dr Nader Rifai's laboratory (Children's Hospital,\nBoston, Massachusetts). Competitive electrochemiluminescence\nimmunoassays were performed on a 2010 Elecsys autoanalyzer\n(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) to measure serum\nconcentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG. Laboratory\ntechnicians were blinded to sample identifiers and participant\ncharacteristics. The lowest detection limits of the assay were\ntestosterone, 20 ng/dL; estradiol, 5 pg/mL; and SHBG, 3 nmol/L.\nCoefficients of variation for quality control specimens were\nIn a separate quality control sample run for this study, the\ninterassay coefficient of variation was 2.5% for an estradiol\nconcentration of 39.4 pg/mL, which is in the range of typical male\nestradiol concentrations. Serum hormone concentrations detected\nin the men in NHANES III were generally within the range of\nL [Fauci et al, 2008]). Serum total testosterone, total estradiol,\nSHBG, and albumin concentrations were used to estimate free\ntestosterone and free estradiol levels with mass action equations\nAssessment of Covariates\nCovariates considered in the analysis were those known to\ninfluence either hormone concentrations or hematocrit.\nParticipants in NHANES III provided information on age,\nrace/ethnicity, smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked\nper day, and physical activity. A standardized method was\nused to code and classify each type of physical activity by rate\nof energy expenditure (Ainsworth et al, 1993; Rohrmann et al,\n2005). Weekly frequency of moderate and vigorous walking,\njogging, or running; biking; swimming; aerobics; dancing;\ncalisthenics; gardening; and lifting weights was measured.\nOther physical activities were considered to be at the\nmoderate level if they met age-specific cutoffs of the\nmetabolic equivalent (MET) of the activity when compared\n$1.26 METs for ages $79 years. Levels of moderate physical\nactivities were categorized as follows: 0, 0 to 4.7, and $4.8\ntimes/week. Additionally, those who were able to walk 1 mile\nwithout stopping, irrespective of whether the intent was\nexercise, were categorized as being physically active (.0\ntimes/week). Percent body fat was calculated from bioelectric\nimpedance, height, and weight measurements using previously\npublished formulas (Plan and operation of the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1994; Chumlea\net al, 2002). A trained examiner measured height and weight.\nBioelectrical impedance was estimated using a 1990B Bio-\nResistance body composition analyzer (Valhalla Scientific,\nSan Diego, California).\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN (Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina) as implemented in SAS version\n9.1 (Cary, North Carolina) software. In each analysis, we\napplied sampling weights. Those in the highest 10th percentile\nof hematocrit ($47.7%) were categorized as having high\nhematocrit, those in the lowest 10th percentile of hematocrit\n(,41.0%) were categorized as having low hematocrit, and\ncategorized as having normal hematocrit. Select participant\ncharacteristics were compared among those with low, normal,\nand high hematocrits. Both crude and age-adjusted means and\nproportions were calculated.\nTotal testosterone, total estradiol, SHBG, free testosterone,\nand free estradiol levels were categorized into tertiles based on\nthe distributions among all men included in the analysis.\nMultivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds\nratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of low hematocrit\ncompared with normal hematocrit and high hematocrit\ncompared with normal hematocrit by tertile of hormone\nconcentrations, with the lowest hormone tertile as the\nreference group. The models were adjusted for age, race/\nethnicity, smoking status (current, former, never) and number\nof cigarettes smoked per day by current smokers, physical\nactivity, percent body fat, and other hormone levels (tertiles of\ntotal estradiol, total testosterone, and SHBG levels were\nsimultaneously included in a model, free testosterone was\nadjusted for tertiles of total estradiol, and free estradiol was\nadjusted for tertiles of total testosterone).\nThe mean hematocrit levels of men with low and high\nconcentrations of testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, free testos-\nterone, and free estradiol were compared with the mean\nhematocrit levels of men with normal concentrations of these\nhormones. Cut points for low hormone concentrations were\nbased on either clinical cut points or the 10th percentile of\nthe distribution: total testosterone, ,250 ng/dL (Greenspan,\npercentile). The cut points for high hormone concentrations\nwere defined as $90th percentile as follows: total testosterone,\nL; free testosterone, $160 ng/dL; and free estradiol, $1.37 pg/\nmL. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate mean\nhematocrit concentrations, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity,\npercent body fat, current smoking status and number of\ncigarettes smoked per day by current smokers, and frequency\nof physical activity and mutually adjusted for other hormones.\nA subanalysis was carried out, restricting the analysis to men\naged $50 years because these men were more likely to have\nlower testosterone, estradiol, and hematocrit levels.\nWe repeated the analysis excluding men with chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD) because this condition is a common cause of\nanemia and then further stratified by the presence or absence\nof major chronic diseases to assess whether prevalent disease\nexplained the association between hormones and hematocrit\n(ie, reverse causation) based on our hypothesis in the Figure.\nWe considered prevalent chronic disease to be a history of\ndiabetes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, stroke, myocardial\ninfarction, or congestive heart failure.\nResults\nSelected characteristics of this study population are\nshown in Table 1. After age adjustment, the mean\nhematocrits in those with low, normal, and high levels\nage was 41.5 years. Men with low hematocrits were\nsignificantly older (51.3 years) than those with normal\nhematocrits (40.5 years), and men with high hematocrits\nwere significantly younger (39.4 years) than those with\nnormal hematocrits (P , .05). After adjustment for age,\nmen with low hematocrits were more likely to be non-\nHispanic African American and less likely to be non-\nHispanic white or Mexican American than those with\nnormal hematocrits (P , .05). There was no difference\nin percent body fat by hematocrit category. Men with\nhigh hematocrits were more likely to be current\nsmokers, in agreement with prior analyses (Whitehead\net al, 1995). After age adjustment, those with high\nhematocrits were less likely to be physically active than\nthose with normal hematocrits (P , .05), consistent with\nprevious findings (Wannamethee et al, 2002).\nTable 2 presents ORs of low (,41%) and high\nhematocrits ($47.7%) across tertiles of total and free\nestradiol, total and free testosterone, and SHBG levels\nafter multivariable adjustment. Men with concentra-\ntions of total estradiol in the highest tertile had almost 3\nin the lowest tertile. The odds of high hematocrit also\nincreased with increasing tertiles of free estradiol level (P\ntrend 5 .09). Although not statistically significant, there\nwas a suggestion that men in the highest tertiles of total\nand free testosterone and total estradiol levels had\ndecreased odds of low hematocrit (Table 2).\nWe repeated these analyses excluding men with CKD,\nand the results were similar (see Supplemental Table,\navailable online at www.andrologyjournal.org). When\nwe excluded men with CKD and then stratified by\nprevalent chronic disease, the associations of total (P\nwith high hematocrit in men without prevalent chronic\ndisease were similar to the overall findings, whereas\nthese associations were not present in men with\nprevalent chronic diseases (Table 3).\nMean hematocrit did not differ in men who had low,\nnormal, or high total testosterone concentrations\n(Table 4). However, men with low free testosterone\nconcentrations had a lower hematocrit (43.6%) com-\npared with men in the normal range of free testosterone\nanalysis was restricted to men aged $50 years (42.4% vs\nsignificantly lower in men with both low SHBG\nSHBG levels (hematocrit, 44.4%). For men aged\n$50 years, those with high SHBG concentrations had\nlower hematocrits than men with normal SHBG levels\nTable 5 summarizes the most important findings in\nthis manuscript.\nDiscussion\nBoth low and high hematocrit levels have detrimental\nhealth effects. Increased mortality has been documented\nin patients with anemia, as well as those with\nerythrocytosis, which may increase predilection for\nthrombosis through multiple mechanisms (Gagnon et\nPenninx, 2007). Thus, it is important to identify\npredictors of both high and low levels of hematocrit\namong men. In this nationally representative sample of\nmen, we found that men with clinically low free\ntestosterone levels had lower hematocrits than men with\nthe normal range of free testosterone. We also observed\nthat high total and free estradiol concentrations were\nassociated with high hematocrit. In addition, both low\nPaller et al N Sex Steroid Hormones and Hematocrit 1335\nand high SHBG levels were associated with low\nhematocrit; the association between high SHBG level\nand low hematocrit was similar when the analysis was\nrestricted to men aged $50 years, whereas the associ-\nation between low SHBG level and hematocrit was\nnonsignificant. Although the observed differences in\nhematocrit were often small (1% to 3%), they were\nstatistically significant, and changes of as little as 2% in\nhematocrit have been shown to be associated with\nsignificant increases ($20%) in the frequency of major\nischemic heart disease events (Carter et al, 1983;\nOur finding that men with clinically low concentra-\ntions of free testosterone (,5 ng/dL) had significantly\nlower hematocrits than those with free testosterone in\nthe normal range is compatible with findings in clinical\nstudies that consistently show an association between\nlow total testosterone level, via surgical or chemical\ndepletion, and low hematocrit (Weber et al, 1991;\nFonseca et al, 1998). Our findings are also consistent\nwith those of Ferrucci et al (2006), who in the Tuscany\nInCHIANTI study of men aged $65 years, found that\nthose with low total and bioavailable testosterone\nconcentrations had a higher odd of anemia as assessed\nby hemoglobin and that men with low baseline\nbioavailable testosterone had an increased risk of\ndeveloping anemia. In that study, men with lower total\ntestosterone levels had 5 times the odds of anemia than\nTable 1.

The smaller OR for total testosterone levels seen\nby Ferrucci et al (2006) and the lack of significant effect\nof lower total testosterone levels in our study could be\nexplained by the high variability of older men in SHBG\nand albumin levels, both of which have strong effects\non the bioactive portion of total testosterone. With\nrespect to men aged $50 years in our analysis, low free\ntestosterone levels were also associated with a lower\nhematocrit. The stronger associations observed in the\nInCHIANTI study than in our study may be due to the\nolder age and thus lower testosterone levels of the men.\nUnlike clinical studies in which pharmacological doses\nof exogenous testosterone were administered, resulting\nin an elevated hematocrit (Tenover, 1992; Sih et al,\nobserve an increased risk of high hematocrit levels in\nthe highest free or total testosterone tertiles. Similar to\nour analysis, Yeap et al (2009) explored a cross-\nsectional analysis of 492 men from Australia aged 30\nto 94 years and found that overall, hemoglobin and\nSHBG levels were inversely correlated. In addition, free\ntestosterone levels were associated with hemoglobin\nlevels, consistent with our findings (Yeap et al, 2009).\nWe hypothesized that androgens would be associated\nwith hematocrit because they are known to activate\nhematopoietic stem cells and stimulate erythropoietin\nproduction, thereby regulating hematopoiesis (Besa,\n1994). We did not have a hypothesis about the asso-\nciation between estradiol and hematocrit because to\nour knowledge, there is no direct mechanistic link\nbetween estradiol and erythropoiesis. Yet, we found\nthat men with higher concentrations of total and free\nestradiol were less likely to have low hematocrits and\nmore likely to have high hematocrits, even after adjust-\nments for total testosterone level and percent body fat.\nWe adjusted for testosterone, which is converted to\nestradiol via catalysis by aromatase in fat, to be able to\ndetermine the independent association for estradiol.\nOur results for estradiol are compatible with a clinical\nstudy of testosterone supplementation in hypogonadal\nmen that found that 12 of 14 men with an elevated\nhematocrit also had elevated estradiol levels (Dobs et\nal, 1999). As previously mentioned, estradiol blunts the\neffects of hypoxia on erythropoietin production in\nwomen but has unclear significance in men and would\nnot explain our findings; thus, another possibility is\nthat these findings occurred by chance.\nTable 2.

Prevalent chronic disease\nincludes history of diabetes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, stroke, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure.\nThe relationship between SHBG and hematocrit\nappears to be complex. Consistent with a prior Japanese\nin our study, high SHBG levels were associated with\nlower hematocrit levels overall and among men aged\n$50 years. The finding that low SHBG concentrations\nwere associated with lower hematocrit in our overall\nstudy population is a novel finding to our knowledge.\nThere is no known mechanism for this finding; however,\nthe different trends seen with age could relate to the fact\nthat SHBG starts to rise in the fourth and fifth decades\nin men (Feldman et al, 2002) and steroid negative\nfeedback is known to change as men age (Winters and\nWang, 2009). In addition, the association between\nSHBG and hematocrit could be affected by confounding\ndisease states such as liver disease.\nBased on previous analysis of the NHANES III data,\nanemia appears to be related to a deficiency in iron,\n, and/or folate in one-third of cases, renal\ninsufficiency in one-third, and unexplained anemia in\nthe remaining third of patients (Guralnik et al, 2004).\nAlthough renal insufficiency is a known cause of low\nerythropoietin production, in multivariable-adjusted\nmodels, the odds of a glomerular filtration rate\nhormones with the exception of high free estradiol levels\nhaving 3 times the odds of a decreased glomerular\nfiltration rate (Yi et al, 2009). In sensitivity analyses, we\nexcluded men with chronic kidney disease and the result\nwas not remarkably changed (see Supplemental Table).\nIn healthy men, altered hematocrit may mediate the\nassociation between hormones and health outcomes;\nhowever, in men with chronic disease, the disease may\nalter both hematocrit and hormone levels. Thus, we\nstratified by the presence of major chronic disease. In\nmen without prevalent chronic disease, the association\nbetween high estradiol levels and high hematocrit was\nsimilar to that of the main analysis; however, in the men\nwith prevalent chronic disease, no associations were\nobserved between any of the hormone levels and\nhematocrit. Thus, there was no evidence supporting\nour hypothesis that disease status will alter both\nhematocrit and hormone levels; however, we could not\ntake into account the duration or severity of these\ndiseases or the nature or success of the treatments for\nthese diseases.\nTable 5.

The men in this study\nwere aged $20 years, allowing the association between\nhormones and hematocrit to be evaluated in an age\nrange wider than that in previous studies of older men.\nSimilarly, this analysis benefited from the standardized\nmeasurement of demographic characteristics, anthropo-\nmetric measures, and laboratory analytes. The large\nsample size and resulting power of the NHANES III\nanalysis provided us with a unique opportunity to detect\nsmall differences even after adjustment for relevant\ncovariates, including measures of smoking. Analyses of\nhemoglobin showed results similar to those for hemat-\nocrit (data not shown). However, the study was limited\nby insufficient power involving men with prevalent\ndisease (Table 3) and men aged .50 years (Table 4). An\nimportant limitation of our study is that the cross-\nsectional design did not allow for discerning the\ntemporality of the observed associations of sex steroid\nhormones and SHBG with hematocrit.\nIn this nationally representative study of men, sex\nsteroid hormones, in particular total and free estradiol,\nfree testosterone, and SHBG, appeared to influence\nhematocrit levels. Although causal relationships cannot\nbe determined from our analysis, future studies should\nbe conducted to address whether it might be beneficial\nto treat older men who have low circulating testoster-\none, estradiol, or SHBG levels to increase hematocrit\nlevels and general well-being.\nReferences\nAinsworth BE, Haskell WL, Leon AS, Jacobs DR Jr, Montoye HJ,\nSallis JF, Paffenbarger RS Jr. Compendium of physical activities:\nclassification of energy costs of human physical activities.
