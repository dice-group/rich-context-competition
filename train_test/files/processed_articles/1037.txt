    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPURPOSE Many family doctors provide care to patients with occupational injuries\nand illnesses, but little is known about the type of medical services provided, or\nhow they compare with services provided by other types of physicians. This study\nused national data to develop a statistical profile of office-based medical care\ndelivered by family physicians to patients with work-related disorders.\nMedical Care Survey, we classified visits for patients with work-related conditions\naccording to patient and physician characteristics, services provided, and other\nvisit characteristics. For comparison, we also compiled profiles for visits to other\ntypes of physicians for treatment of work-related disorders, and for visits to family\nphysicians for treatment of nonoccupational conditions.\nA majority of visits made to family physicians for occupational conditions involved\npatients seeing their regular primary care doctor. Possibly for this reason, patients\nat these visits were more likely to have their blood pressure taken, receive diag-\nnostic and screening services, and have prescription drugs prescribed or admin-\nistered, compared with patients seeing other types of physicians. Only 73.3% of\nvisits to family physicians for work-related disorders were expected to be paid for\nby workers' compensation insurance.\nCONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the distinctive types of care provided by\nfamily physicians to injured workers may be related to their role as the patients'\nregular physician. This finding is relevant to the proposals being considered by\nmany states to expand employers' and insurers' ability to choose the treating phy-\nsician in workers' compensation cases.\nINTRODUCTION\nMedical care for patients with work-related injuries and illnesses in\nthe United States is generally governed by state workers' compen-\nsation laws. In about one half of the states, injured employees are\nfree to choose their initial treating physician.1 Recently, many states have\ngiven employers and insurers greater control over the choice of physician,\nin hopes of improving care and reducing workers' compensation costs.2,3\nPartly as a result, patients receiving primary care for a work-related\ncondition often are not treated by their regular doctor. Only one quarter\n(25.6%) of visits for care of work-related conditions are provided by the\npatient's regular primary care physician, compared with 51.2% among\npatients being treated for nonoccupational conditions.4 Family physicians\ntraditionally have played an important role in providing care for patients\nwith occupational disorders, nevertheless. Approximately 22.9% of office\nvisits for care of work-related conditions are provided by family physicians.4\nJong Uk Won, MD, DrPH1,2\nAllard E.

This exploratory study aimed\nto develop a nationally representative statistical profile\nof the ambulatory medical care provided by family\nphysicians to patients with work-related conditions.\nMETHODS\nThis study used data from the National Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NAMCS), a survey of physi-\ncians providing office-based medical care in the United\nStates. NAMCS has been conducted annually since\n1973 by the US National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS). NAMCS participants included both primary\ncare physicians and specialists providing direct patient\ncare in office-based settings. Our analyses used infor-\nsurveys, which were aggregated to yield sufficient sam-\nple sizes for a cross-sectional analysis of visits for work-\nrelated conditions by physician type. Responses from\nitems were generally less than 5%.5\nNAMCS collected information on patient and\nphysician characteristics, the clinical practice setting,\nreason for the visit, patients' symptoms and diagno-\nses, medical services provided, medications ordered\nor administered, and the expected source of payment\nfor the visit. Information was provided by the treating\nphysician or the physician's clinical staff using a written\nvisit record form.5 Additional information regarding the\nclinical practice setting was obtained through personal\ninterviews with participating physicians conducted by\nthe US Census Bureau, on behalf of NCHS.\nNAMCS used a multistage probability sampling\ndesign based on geographically related primary sam-\npling units, physician practice characteristics within\neach of these units, and a systematic random sample\nof patient visits within each physician practice. This\nsampling procedure was designed to select respondents\nrepresentative of those providing office-based services\nin various regions, practice settings, and populations\nthroughout the United States.6\nThe NAMCS target population included all physician\npractices providing office-based patient care as classified\nby the American Medical Association and the American\nOsteopathic Association.5 NAMCS classified physicians\ninto 15 major groupings and 129 specific types based\non information supplied by the reporting physician or\nclinical staff, applying codes developed by the Ameri-\ncan Medical Association and the American Osteopathic\nAssociation. The general practice category contained 4\nphysician subtypes: family practice (coded as FP), family\npractice\u00adgeriatric medicine (FPG), family practice\u00adsports\nmedicine (FSM), and general practice (GP).\nWe classified each office visit as to whether it was a\nvisit for a work-related condition. Information collected\non the patient record form allowed us to identify those\nvisits in 2 ways: listing of workers' compensation as the\nprimary expected source of payment for the visit, or\na physician's answering yes to the question, \"Was this\nvisit related to injury or poisoning?\" followed by an\naffirmative response to a follow-up question, \"Was this\ninjury work-related?\" Of 13,191 patient visits made to\nfamily physicians, 326 involved treatment for work-\nrelated conditions.\nThe basic unit of analysis for this study was the\npatient visit. Visit weights were calculated by the NCHS\nbased on the sampling strata adjusted for response rates\nin each survey year. Descriptive statistics for patient\nwhether the visit was made to a family physician for\ntreatment of a work-related condition (FP-WR visits),\na physician other than a family physician for treatment\nof a work-related condition (OP-WR visits), or a family\nphysician for treatment of a non\u00adwork-related condition\n(FP-NWR visits). We also calculated these statistics for\npatient visits to occupational medicine physicians (Occ-\nMed-WR visits), to establish a comparative benchmark\nof how specialists in the treatment of work-related con-\nditions care for patients. To examine how certain factors\naffect family physicians' care for patients with work-\nrelated conditions, FP-WR visits were further stratified\nby whether care was paid for by workers' compensation\ninsurance, the family physician was the patient's regu-\nlar primary care physician, and the patient was a new\npatient (ie, one not seen previously by the physician).\nWe performed t tests for continuous variables and\n2 tests for discrete variables to assess the statistical\nsignificance of differences between the various visit\ncategories. Because estimates derived from our analy-\nses were based on a sample rather than on the entire\ntarget universe of office visits, our results were subject\nto sampling error. To account for the complex sample\ndesign of the NAMCS, calculations were performed\nby the Taylor series approximation method using the\nSURVEYMEANS procedure in SAS software version\n9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with Strata and Cluster\nvariables specified.7 The reported P value ranges reflect\nthis adjustment for the effect of sampling design.\nRESULTS\nThe distribution of office visits by each of 15 major\nphysician groupings is summarized in Table 1. Family\nphysicians provided care at 22% of visits nationally for\npatients with work-related conditions, second only to\northopedic surgeons (33.7% of those visits). Visits for\npatients with work-related conditions represented 2.5%\nof all office visits and thus accounted for only a small\nproportion of family physicians' total visit load.\nDescriptive statistics for patient visits, stratified by\ntype of visit, are summarized in Tables 2 through 4.\nTable 2 shows the demographic characteristics of the\npatients. The majority of patients at FP-WR visits were\nmale, white, and non-Hispanic. Patients seen for work-\nrelated conditions, in general, were more likely to be\nmale and to be of working age (15-64 years old) than\nthose seen for non\u00adwork-related conditions.\nThe characteristics of the medical care provided for\neach type of physician visit are summarized in Table 3.\nThe distribution of diagnoses for OP-WR visits was gen-\nerally similar to that for FP-WR visits, involving mostly\nacute injuries (eg, cuts and bruises) and musculoskeletal\ndisorders. The physician was the patient's regular pri-\nmary care physician at the majority (59.2%) of FP-WR\nvisits. Compared with OP-WR visits, FP-WR visits were\nmore likely to be for treatment of acute problems and\nto involve diagnostic and screening services, the taking\nof patients' blood pressure, surgical procedures, and the\nadministration or ordering of prescription medications.\nThey were less likely to involve follow-up services, men-\ntal health counseling, or psychotherapy. On average, FP-\nWR visits lasted 17% fewer minutes than OP-WR visits.\nPatients seen during OccMed-WR visits had diag-\nnoses similar to those of patients seen during FP-WR\nvisits, but were more likely to be administered fol-\nlow-up treatment, therapeutic and preventive services,\ninjury prevention counseling, and physiotherapy. They\nwere less likely to be treated for chronic problems than\npatients at FP-WR visits. FP-WR visits were consider-\nably less likely than either OP-WR or OccMed-WR\nvisits to be paid for by workers' compensation insur-\nance, require insurer authorization for care, and be set\nup through a referral from another physician. On aver-\nage, FP-WR visits were substantially shorter than either\nOP-WR or OccMed-WR visits.\nFP-NWR visits had a diagnostic mix that differed\nnoticeably from that of FP-WR visits and had a dis-\nsimilar patient population (eg, a greater proportion of\npatients who were not of working age). Consequently,\nthe care provided at FP-WR visits differed considerably\nfrom that provided at FP-NWR visits. Despite these\ndifferences, the average time spent by family physicians\nfor either a work-related or a non\u00adwork-related condi-\nminutes, respectively).\nTable 4 itemizes the types of medications\nprescribed or administered at office visits. In gen-\neral, medications were prescribed or administered\nto patients less often at visits for work-related\nconditions than at visits for non\u00adwork-related\nconditions. Slightly less than one half of the medi-\ncations prescribed or administered at FP-WR and\nOP-WR visits were for pain relief, compared with\n60.8% for patients seeing occupational medicine\nphysicians. The distribution of type of medications\nat FP-NWR visits differed significantly from that\nat FP-WR visits, presumably because of the under-\nlying differences in diagnostic and patient mix.\nAmong FP-WR visits, the pattern of pre-\nscribing or administering medications differed\nsomewhat between new patients and established\npatients. New patients had a drug prescribed or\nadministered at 51.9% of these visits, compared\nwith 68.5% of visits made by patients who had\nseen that doctor previously (P = .06).\nOn average, prescription medications were\nmore likely to be ordered or administered at FP-\nNWR visits than at other types of visits. Specifi-\ncally, the mean number of medications ordered\nor administered was 1.39 per FP-NWR visit,\nOccMed-WR visit, and 0.64 per OP-WR visit.\nTable 1.

Compared with visits paid for\nby private health insurance or other sources, visits paid\nfor by workers' compensation insurance were more\nlikely to require insurer authorization for care and to\ninvolve new patients. Those visits were less likely to\nhave involved follow-up services, and the treating phy-\nsician was less likely to be the patient's regular primary\ncare physician.\nWhen a family physician was the patient's regu-\nlar primary care physician, visits were more likely\nto involve treatment for chronic (rather than acute)\nconditions and to include therapeutic and preventive\nservices. Those visits were less likely to be paid for by\nworkers' compensation insurance, to require insurer\nauthorization, or to involve new patients or patients\nreferred from other physicians. Similarly, FP-WR visits\ninvolving new patients were less likely to be made\nfor routine chronic problems or musculoskeletal dis-\norders than were visits by patients who had seen the\nphysician previously. Those visits were more likely to\ninvolve a referral from another physician, to be paid\nfor by workers' compensation, and to require insurer\nauthorization for payment.\nInterestingly, stratifying the FP-WR visits by work-\ners' compensation payment, new patient status, and\nprimary care physician status had little effect on the\ndistribution of services provided during the visit. The\nonly difference was a slightly greater likelihood among\npatients seeing their regular primary care doctor to\nreceive therapeutic and preventive services. Otherwise,\nno significant differences between visit categories were\nobserved with respect to the types of services provided.\nDISCUSSION\nThis exploratory study has produced a profile of\nmedical care visits provided by family physicians for\npatients with work-related injuries and illnesses. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the nation's first study\nfocusing specifically on the types of\nmedical care and services provided by\nfamily physicians to injured workers.\nThe use of nationally representative\nNAMCS data allowed us to describe\nthese visits according to key patient\nand medical care characteristics.\nOur data indicate that family phy-\nsicians play a leading role in treating\ninjured workers in the United States,\ndelivering nearly one quarter of the\noffice visits for patients with work-\nrelated injuries and illnesses. Family\nphysicians provide approximately\n3 times as many visits each year to\ninjured workers as do occupational\nmedicine specialists. Because only\na small proportion (2.5%) of office\nvisits are made by patients with work-\nrelated conditions, however, many\nfamily physicians may not be aware\nof their substantial contribution to\nthe care of America's injured workers.\nOur study found that the majority\n(59.2%) of patients with work-related\nconditions who see a family physician\nare receiving care from their regular\nprimary care doctor, compared with\nonly 13.1% of injured workers seen\nby other types of physicians. One rea-\nson is that many injured workers are\ntreated by specialists, such as orthope-\ndic surgeons and occupational medi-\nTable 2.

Also, many\nstates now allow employers\nand insurers to choose the\ntreating physician in work-\ners' compensation cases,\nmaking it less likely that a\npatient will see his or her\nregular primary care physi-\ncian. Recently, many states\nhave expanded employers'\nand insurers' control over\nthe choice of physician\nin workers' compensation\ncases, in hopes of thereby\nconstraining costs.1-3 Worker\nand advocacy groups have\nexpressed concerns about\nthis trend, believing that it\ndetracts from effective coor-\ndination and continuity of\ncare, and could jeopardize\nthe quality of care by direct-\ning patients to physicians\nwho will inappropriately\nlimit patient services in\nresponse to employer and\ninsurer interests.7-9\nOur study's findings may\nbe relevant in this regard.\nTable 3. continued\nMedical Care Characteristic\nVisit Type\nOccMed-WR\nPrimary expected source of payment for the visit\nPrivate insurance\nMedicare\nMedicaid\nSelf-pay\nWorkers' compensation\nNo charge\nOther\nUnknown\nNAMCS = National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; ICD-9 = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; FP-WR = visit to family practice physician for work-related\ncondition; OP-WR = visit to non\u00adfamily practice physician for work-related condition; OccMed-WR = visit to occupational medicine physician for work-related condition; FP-\nNWR = visit to family practice physician for non\u00adwork-related condition; RN = registered nurse; LPN = licensed practical nurse; HMO = health maintenance organization.\n* Reference category for comparison.\nTable 4.

Similarly, injured workers\nseeing a family physician were 27.6% more likely to\nreceive diagnostic and screening services, and 39.6%\nmore likely to have a drug administered or prescribed\ncompared with patients seeing other types of physi-\ncians. This pattern suggests that family physicians care\nfor patients with work-related conditions in a broader\ncontext than do physicians who merely see a patient\nTable 5.

Perhaps fam-\nily physicians give comparable emphasis (as other phy-\nsicians) to treating the specific work-related injury, but\nadditionally place greater emphasis on general health\nscreening and diagnosis during the visit. Similarly, it is\nconceivable that family physicians' greater tendency to\nprescribe or administer drugs during the visit reflects\ntheir attention to their patients' comorbidities and the\nneed for their \"regular\" patients to have prescriptions\nrefilled while at the office. Indeed, new patients seeing\nTable 5. continued\nMedical Care Characteristic\nVisit Characteristic*\nWas Paid For by\nWorkers' Compensation\nPhysician Was Patient's\nRegular Primary Physician\nPatient Was\na New Patient\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nTherapy provided during visit\nMedical professionals seen during the visit\nPhysician was patient's regular primary care\nphysician\nPrimary expected source of payment for the visit\nPatient was referred by another physician/health\nplan\nNAMCS = National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; ICD-9 = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; FP-WR = visit to family physician for work-related condi-\ntion; OP-WR = visit to non\u00adfamily physician for work-related condition; OccMed-WR = visit to occupational physician for work-related condition; FP-NWR = visit to family\nphysician for non\u00adwork-related condition; RN = registered nurse; LPN = licensed practical nurse; HMO = health maintenance organization.\n* Comparisons were between No column and corresponding Yes column.\nfamily physicians for treatment of a work-related con-\ndition had a drug prescribed or administered at 51.9%\nof visits, compared with 68.5% of visits among patients\nwho had seen that doctor previously.\nOnly 73.3% of FP-WR visits were expected to be\npaid for by workers' compensation, compared with\nof those to occupational medicine physicians. These\nfindings are consistent with other studies indicating\nthat many legitimate cases of work-related conditions\nare not reported to workers' compensation insurers\nand thus are not reflected adequately in data based on\nworkers' compensation claims filings.10-13 It has been\nestimated that 10% to 40% of cases are not reported.\nSuggested reasons for underreporting include fear of\nreprisal from employers, lack of knowledge about how\nto file claims, physicians' failure to correctly identify\nwork-relatedness, and inappropriate denial of claims\nby workers' compensation insurers. The differences in\nworkers' compensation payment observed in this study\nbetween family physicians and other types of physi-\ncians may indicate that patients seeing their regular\nprimary care doctor are more likely to seek payment\nthrough conventional private or public health insurance\nthan to try to secure coverage and reimbursement from\nthe employer's workers' compensation insurer. Although\npotentially expedient for both patient and doctor, this\npractice should be discouraged for several reasons: (1)\nthe resulting underestimation of occupational injuries\ndetracts from the usefulness of workers' compensation\ndata for surveillance and prevention, (2) this practice\ncould make it more difficult for the worker to obtain\nwage replacement and other workers' compensation\nbenefits, (3) it may necessitate patient copayments or\nother out-of-pocket expenses that would otherwise be\ncovered by workers' compensation, and (4) physicians\nmight be less likely to provide prevention, return-to-\nwork, and impairment determination services that are\nnormally covered in workers' compensation cases.\nOur comparison of the care provided by family\nphysicians with that provided by occupational medi-\ncine specialists suggests that there are ways in which\nfamily physicians can enhance their services for injured\nworkers. For example, compared with family physi-\ncians, occupational medicine specialists were nearly\n3 times more likely to provide injured workers with\ninjury prevention counseling and education. Interest-\ningly, family physicians were equally as likely as occu-\npational medicine specialists to provide their patients\nwith exercise counseling and education. This finding\nsuggests that family physicians caring for injured work-\ners might need additional training and familiarity with\neffective injury prevention techniques that can be\nused by the patient or suggested by the patient to the\nemployer. Several commentators have noted the bar-\nriers doctors face in incorporating injury prevention\ncounseling into primary medical care.14-17 Providing\ninjury prevention advice is an important goal, however,\nespecially for patients with work-related disorders who\nmay continue to face injury hazards when they return\nto their jobs.\nOur results suggest that family physicians often\nuse a patient's visit for a work-related condition as an\nopportunity to assess the patient's overall health and\nprovide care for other nonoccupational comorbidities.\nIn theory, combining both types of services in a single\nvisit could enhance continuity of care and improve\nthe quality of care for work-related conditions, for\nexample, through better understanding of the relation-\nship between the patient's underlying medical condi-\ntion and their work-related disorder, and by identifying\npotentially dangerous drug interactions. Additional\nresearch is needed to examine this issue thoroughly and\nto assess its implications for states' efforts to control\ninjured workers' choice of physicians and limit their\nability to see their regular family doctor.\nAnother topic for additional research suggested by\nthis preliminary study is whether providing injury pre-\nvention counseling and education to the injured worker\nduring the visit affects the type of medical services\ndelivered, the likelihood of follow-up visits, and even-\ntual patient outcomes, such as recovery of vocational\nfunction and reduction of pain. Some of these ques-\ntions could be investigated by further analysis of the\nNAMCS data, for example, the relationship between\nproviding injury prevention counseling during the visit\nand the delivery of medications, physiotherapy, and\nother services during the visit. Using NAMCS data, it\nwould also be possible to examine the effect of provid-\ning counseling on the length of visit. We suspect that\nproviding injury prevention counseling would reduce\nthe need for certain other medical services (eg, physio-\ntherapy) while only slightly lengthening visit duration.\nOther data sources would be needed to examine\nlonger-term follow-up issues, such as the relationship\nbetween injury prevention counseling and the likeli-\nhood of return visits or additional therapeutic services.\nIdeally, it would be useful to investigate the extent to\nwhich the delivery of particular services (blood pres-\nsure monitoring, injury prevention counseling, prescrip-\ntion drug use) is related to physician type, diagnosis,\npractice characteristics, workers' compensation status,\ngeographical region, and patient characteristics (sex,\nage, race/ethnicity). It would also be desirable to ana-\nlyze the relationship between the observed patterns\nof care and long-term patient outcomes, including\nfunctional recovery, return to work, costs, and patients'\nexperience with care. In this preliminary study, we did\nnot have access to potentially important information\nthat would be relevant, such as the patient's employ-\nment status, occupation, and general health status; the\nmechanism of injury; the severity of the patient's condi-\ntion; costs of care; or the patient's eventual functional\nand vocational outcomes.\nOur exploratory analysis had other limitations. It\nwas based on self-reported information from physi-\ncians and clinical staff, and thus was subject to possible\nreporting errors or omissions. There was no way to\nindependently verify the data contained in NAMCS.\nSpecial training provided to participating physicians by\nNCHS about how to complete the survey forms pre-\nsumably helped mitigate such potential errors.\nThe data compiled in this preliminary study will\nbe useful for establishing benchmarks to help family\nphysicians assess the extent and type of services cur-\nrently provided for work-related conditions, relative\nto national norms. The data should help state workers'\ncompensation officials better understand family physi-\ncians' role in caring for injured workers. Additionally,\nthe study highlights gaps in knowledge that can be\naddressed through additional research. The goal of\nresearch in this area is to identify ways of improving\ncare for workers with occupational injury, to deliver\ncare in an efficient manner, and, ultimately, to promote\nbetter overall health outcomes for patients.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/4/2/138.\n",
