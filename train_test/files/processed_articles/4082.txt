The\naxiomatic argument behind this emphasis is that, for these\nprograms to be effective, the people for which a program is\nintended should have a voice in the design and implementa-\ntion of these interventions, as people's participation depends\non what they consider meaningful and relevant in the con-\ntext of their visions, experiences, and values (Jackson et al.,\nPublic institutions have echoed these community and par-\nticipatory principles throughout Canada, and they are part of\nmost official documents. For example, the Provincial Wellness\nPlan (PWP) in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) asserts that\nit \"reflects an increased focus on a shared responsibility for\nhealth and provides direction for promoting health, preventing\nillness and injury, and increasing the capacity of individuals,\ngroups, communities and sectors to take action for wellness\"\n(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2006).\nAlthough practitioners and researchers in the fields of\nhealth promotion and disease prevention have earnestly\nembraced the rhetoric of community capacity building and\nthe related notions of community organizing, community\ndevelopment, and social capital, working with a community\napproach is not as straightforward a task as some literature\narticle addresses some of these challenges through a case\nstudy of two projects funded by the Provincial Wellness\nGrants in NL, a province where community ties and support\nsystems have been traditionally strong and important. Our\nresearch aim was to explore how this sense of community\nwould respond to proactive involvement in health and well-\nness activities as suggested by the PWP, and how this cor-\nresponds to our academic notions of community capacity\nbuilding.\n1Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMartha Traverso-Yepez, Faculty of Medicine, Division of Community\nEmail: mtraverso@mun.ca\nCommunity Capacity Building\nfor Health:A Critical Look\nat the Practical Implications\nofThis Approach\nMarthaTraverso-Yepez1,Victor Maddalena1,William Bavington1,\nand Catherine Donovan1\n Keywords\ncommunity, community capacity building, health, health promotion, qualitative research\n2 SAGE Open\nTheVarious Meanings\nof Community and\nCommunity Capacity Building\nChaskin (2001) defines community capacity building as \"the\ninteraction of human capital, organizational resources, and\nsocial capital existing within a given community that can be\nleveraged to solve collective problems, and improve or main-\ntain the well being of that community\" (p. 295). Most related\nliterature elaborates on the multiple dimensions involved in\ncommunity capacity as well as discusses pathways for its\nimplementation and/or evaluation (Baker & Teaser-Polk,\n2001). Where the positivist approach prevails, the goal is\nmainly the measurement of these dimensions (Goodman\nMaclellan-Wright et al., 2007). The participants in most\nempirical, quantitative studies have usually been volunteers\nor staff from health promotion agencies or organizations\nand have rarely involved grassroots members of society\nFrom a more critical perspective, other authors have ques-\ntioned the use of the community capacity building approach\nin research and intervention, highlighting the contested\naspects of community and community capacity building\nis that projects that promote \"capacity\" and \"self-sufficiency\"\nmay be guises through which governments minimize their\naccountability for larger social ills. Community capacity\nbuilding projects may act as a means to boost the reputations\nof politicians and government officials, playing upon the well-\nintentioned connotations that surround the concepts of com-\nmunity, community capacity, and social capital (Mowbray,\n2005). This diverts attention from the larger causes of socio-\neconomic disparities to the responsibility of the individuals\nliving in lower income communities, thereby placing blame\non the victim and focusing on \"defective\" populations (Craig,\nAn intermediate position considers that community capac-\nity and its various dimensions are operational guidelines to\nbe monitored or evaluated with participants (Labonte &\nLaverack, 2001a). From this perspective, the ideas of pro-\ncess and outcome are interdependent, mutually benefiting\nthe outcomes of health promotion programs and the partici-\nWoodard, Chad, & Laverack, 2002). According to Labonte\nand Laverack (2001a), community capacity can be more\nadequately defined as a descriptor of \"social and organiza-\ntional relationships . . . with dynamic qualities rather than\nstatic properties\" (p. 112). This creates an extra challenge for\nthe health promotion planning process, as it involves incor-\nporating a capacity building relationship. This relationship\nimplies a kind of interaction that favors values of equity and\nrespect, and facilitates participation, leadership, organiza-\ntional structures, resource mobilization, and critical assess-\nment. These qualities depend not only on internal aspects of\nindividuals and social groups but also on the availability and\nquality of public infrastructure (Hawe et al., 2000; Labonte\nThe underlying assumption of community in most com-\nmunity capacity building endeavors is of a definable, homo-\ngeneous group or a social unit with some kind of affiliation\n(geographical, social/institutional, and psychological), work-\ning with external agents that provide support. The problem\nwith this assumption is the romanticized way the term com-\nmunity tends to be used (Labonte, 2007). As expressed by\nLabonte (2007), \"community ceased to be a subject (a group\nof people acting with their own intent), and became an object\n(community as a target of health programs) or an adjective\naccompanying the real subjects\" (p. 83).\nThis objectification of the term community usually under-\nestimates cultural complexities existing in any group of peo-\nple, such as different interests, perspectives, and experiences.\nIt also ignores the power relations as well as the fluid and\nsituational nature of human groups (Chiu, 2008). We agree\nwith Walter (2007), who suggests approaching community\nas a \"multi-dimensional-dynamic system (people and orga-\nnizations, consciousness, actions, and context) of which we\nare a part\" (p. 68). This approach, Walter asserts, \"enables us\nto see ourselves and each other as part of a dynamic system\nthat is continually being created and re-created and that\naffects and is affected by our consciousness and actions\" (p.\n70). Consciousness, as part of our subjectivity, involves life\nstories, sense of identities, language and cultural values, as\nwell as awareness of power relations. All of these play a cen-\ntral role in our social interactions and the kind of social com-\nmitments we get involved in (Freire, 1974). It is also clear\nthat by living in social relations, every person or organiza-\ntion is potentially a part of different communities.\nFor the purpose of this research, we defined community\nas an orientation for action, as the research dynamic was\nintended to be a facilitating process to foster assets, resources,\nand networking possibilities (Simpson et al., 2003; Smith\nMethod and Methodology\nMethodology:A Qualitative\nResearch Paradigm\nConsidering that every community group has unique cir-\ncumstances, we chose to study local dynamics through a\nparticipatory action-research agenda that was framed as\nstrengths-based, focused on the process, and sustained in\nnotions of sharing power or power/with through open dialog\nlar features characterize participatory action research: shared\nTraverso-Yepez et al. 3\nownership of the research project, community-based identi-\nfication and analysis of social problems, and an orientation\ntoward using research results to facilitate community action\nand change (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000). Incorporating\nthese features ensures that research is conducted in a manner\nconsistent with community values and that the research pro-\ncess and findings are relevant to the people involved.\nMethod:The Research Process\nIn the first stage, we performed a literature review, with a\nspecial focus on the different community capacity building\nframeworks and evaluation tools that have been developed\nboth in Canada and internationally. We also contacted pro-\nvincial and regional health and wellness authorities to form\nan advisory committee to support the research team. This\nresearch was approved by the Human Investigations\nCommittee of Memorial University in August 2009.\nSelecting community group participants. The selection criteria\nas defined in the research proposal were (a) a community group\nthat is fairly conscious of/experienced in the affirming and\nchallenging elements inherent in the process of community\ncapacity building and that will welcome additional support\nfrom the research-intervention process and (b) a community\ngroup relatively inexperienced in community capacity building\nand uncertain of how to form relationships that will enhance\ntheir initiative, contribute to its successful execution, and dis-\nseminate the knowledge and experiences acquired.\nNotably, within these criteria, the selection of the pro-\ngrams submitted was solely based on the quality of the\nfunded proposals, as evaluated by the Provincial Wellness\nCommittee. After a thorough study of 32 health promotion\ninitiatives from the region funded by the PWP for 2010, we\nselected two community initiatives from one of the nine rural\nregions in the province: (a) one focused on a community\nkitchen program at a community center in a social housing\nneighborhood of the largest town (about 4,000 inhabitants)\nin the region and (b) another more generally focused on\nwellness activities developed at the community center of a\nsmall town in an isolated area of the same region. To pre-\nserve the confidentiality of the individuals and their places of\nresidence, we refer to the two participating community\ngroups as \"Site A\" and \"Site B.\"\nA Provincial Wellness consultant facilitated initial con-\ntact, and we prepared a two-page informative summary for\nour first meeting with the two groups. The meeting included\na motivational presentation of the research and objectives,\nhighlighting the tenets of the participatory-action research\napproach and an open discussion to enable the groups to\ndetermine their interest in participating in the research\nproject.\nResearch methods. In addition to the literature review, we\ncollected data through participant observation, informal con-\nversations, group interviews, and individual interviews. Two\nkey informant interviews provided the opportunity for\nservice providers from the region to expand on their personal\nexperiences (Murray, Pullman, & Rodgers, 2003).\nParticipants signed informed consent forms before every\ngroup discussion at both sites. The attendants were usually\ndivided into smaller groups of three or four to discuss the\nquestions and later presented their answers to the entire group.\nThe data from this later group discussion were recorded\nand transcribed. In each new meeting, the principal investi-\ngator (PI), responsible for the data collection process, sys-\ntematically presented the main points from the previous\nmeeting for participants to confirm or comment on. From\nMay to December 2010, we held four group discussions\nand six individual interviews at Site A, with a variable\nnumber of participants ranging from 6 to 13. At this site, in\naddition to the PI and a research assistant, the community\nkitchen facilitator and a staff member from the neighbor-\nhood attended the group meetings. Most of the group par-\nticipants at this site were female, with the exception of\nthree males in one of the sessions (1 staff member and\n2 participants).\nAt Site B, all participants were female and the two mem-\nbers of the research team were the only nonresidents.\nParticipants at this site decided to have only group sessions,\nand we jointly planned and held four meetings with a vari-\nable number of participants (5-34). A possible explanation\nof this preference may be that they felt they had greater\ncontrol and confidence over setting the agenda by publicly\nrevealing the extent to which their views were shared by\npeers. However, a known drawback to group discussion and\nfocus groups is that participants may not be as candid in\ngroup settings as they would be in private, clinical settings\n(Wilkinson, 1998). Also, the moral dimension of health\ntends to limit the degree of disclosure in public settings, as\nopposed to private, face-to-face interactions (Radley &\nConsidering the differences between the sites, we have\norganized the data from each place according to the guid-\ning themes: participants' ideas about personal and com-\nmunity health, how they framed community capacities or\nstrengths, and how they felt with regard to their funded\nprogram.\nFrom the beginning, we realized that although we\nexpressed our openness to work with the participants in a\nparticipatory action-research agenda and they accepted,\nthis was still our idea rather than theirs. Because the\nresearch was not an initiative coming from the partici-\npants, we were seen as authority figures no matter how we\nframed our role in the research process. On occasion we\nfelt that participants' responses were being tailored to fit\nwhat they believed the researchers wanted to hear.\nTherefore, the analysis of the data will explore interactions\nbetween participants' accounts and the research context,\nthe institutional health agenda, and the ways the social and\ninstitutional environment has built particular forms of sub-\njectivity and citizenship.\n4 SAGE Open\nOverview of Findings\nGeneral Social Background\nThe area where both research sites are located is one of the\nnine regions of the Rural Secretariat in NL. Almost half of\nthe population is concentrated within the two central towns,\nlocated near one another, and the other half is widely dis-\npersed in the vast region. The main economic activities\ninclude tourism, seafood processing plants, and one medium-\nsized industry. Like other rural areas, the region faces many\nchallenges, including a stagnant economy, increasing out-\nmigration rates, decreasing employment levels, and an aging\nInterviews with regional service providers highlighted\nthat members of communities in the region generally adopt a\nskeptical attitude toward newcomers. This is most noticeable\namong the older population. Communities tend to remain\nisolated due to geography and shy away from talk of amalga-\nmation. We found that mistrust came from the struggle to\nallocate scarce resources. However, participants recognized\nthat the amalgamation of schools has promoted contact and\nacceptance among youth from different communities.\nAnother barrier they identified was the lack of public trans-\nportation in the area. Specifically, public transportation was\nrestricted to a local taxi service. In addition, people do not\nwant to travel after dark or in the winter due to road condi-\ntions and isolation. In other cases, individuals are unable to\nafford travel due to cost or limited access to vehicles.\nRelevant social networks are limited to family and friends.\nThe only grassroots organization at Site A is the Tenants\nAssociation, but members asserted that participation was\nrather limited. At Site B, there is a \"Recreation Committee\"\nand a \"Come Home Committee,\" but the two committees\nconsist of many of the same people.\nMost participants recognize that the older generation experi-\nences technological barriers, as knowledge of the Internet is\ngenerally limited to the younger generations. The inconsistency\nof Internet access and a lack of computer skills were acknowl-\nedged as problems by participants from both research sites.\nProgram at Site A\nThe program's main focus was on a community kitchen, but it\nalso examined other areas related to health and well-being such\nas physical activity, tobacco control, and environmental health.\nThe community center, mainly funded by the Newfoundland\nand Labrador Housing Corporation, was responsible for run-\nning the program. The center provides services for approxi-\nmately 110 families living in the neighborhood, of which fewer\nthan 25% of the family heads are employed.\nSummary of the Collected Data\nProgram Background. The community kitchen program was\nstarted by volunteers in 2007, with a small group of consistent\nparticipants both from within the neighborhood and from\nwithout. The program was, at the time of the research (2010),\nfacilitated by a paid community kitchen coordinator in\nbiweekly sessions with four to six participants per session due\nto the limited size of the kitchen. Although they received the\nfunding from the Provincial Wellness Grants Program, partici-\npants emphasized that the main problem was the sustainability\nof the kitchen due to the loss of momentum when funding\nexpires. This was a permanent concern, as organizations can\nonly apply for grants once per program. A staff member\nexpressed that for the past 3 years, each time the community\nkitchen exhausted its funding it also lost connections with the\npeople who had been attending its cooking sessions. A lack of\nfunding might result in the loss of the kitchen program coordi-\nnator, which could be another setback to maintaining relation-\nships with participants of the program.\nHealth Concerns. The first session focused around the ques-\ntion \"What things are most important to me in terms of my\nhealth?\" The main issues identified by the group interviews\nincluded (a) quitting smoking, (b) healthy eating, (c) more\nvolunteering and involvement in community life, (d) exercise/\nactive lifestyle, and (e) access to sports and recreation activi-\nties. In all of the sessions, people highlighted how important\nthe kitchen gatherings were for their mental health. Other\naspects mentioned included a good social life, caring for older\npeople, having regular checkups, laughter, meditation, being\ncareful to prevent injuries, and knowledge and awareness.\nThroughout the research, participants emphasized healthy\neating as a priority, but it became clear that the social envi-\nronment plays a strong role in defining eating habits and\nfood choices. In one interview, we learned that a participant\nin her late 50s had never eaten uncooked greens in her life\nand was not about to begin. Another interviewee explained\nthat she had a preference for boxed macaroni and cheese\nbecause it tasted good and was affordable. In a group discus-\nsion, it was also emphasized that not having private transpor-\ntation (and having no public transport available in town)\nresults in many people in the neighborhood relying on frozen\nor canned food rather than fresh items.\nWith regard to health in the community (\"What things are\nmost important when we think about health in our communi-\nties?\"), participants mentioned both the high number of\n\"youth with problems\" and vandalism as ongoing issues.\nConcerns about youth were mainly related to substance abuse\nproblems. Arguments to explain substance abuse included\neasy access to drugs and alcohol in the neighborhood and lack\nof services to help people with addiction problems. The com-\nmunity center staff hope to counteract the problem through\ninformation sessions with local police and health authorities.\nThey noted that they expect things to improve with the\narrival of a new addictions and outreach counselor recently\nhired by the regional health authority.\nConcerns over the health and isolation of some seniors\nwere also expressed, remarking that seniors often find it too\nTraverso-Yepez et al. 5\ndifficult \"to cook just for themselves.\" Participants also dis-\ncussed the need for outdoor and indoor spaces for physical\nactivity and recreation. However, one participant commented\non the difficulties of engaging people in healthy lifestyles:\ndespite the existence of gym equipment in the same building\nwhere the kitchen sessions were held, the equipment was\nrarely used. There is also a walking trail about six blocks\ndown the hill from the community center, but most partici-\npants have only taken short walks in the past, complaining\nthat they suffer from \"shortness of breath,\" due to smoking\nand being overweight. When one of the youngest women in\nthe group was vocal about her success in quitting \"because\nof medical advice regarding lung problems,\" a few others\nexpressed a wish to stop smoking as well, which shows the\nrelevance of local role models.\nIn two of the four group sessions, participants lamented\nthe lack of involvement of many people in the neighborhood,\narguing that \"there is a lack of community togetherness.\"\nIssues of trust were mentioned, for example, while discuss-\ning the failure of the Block Parent program for promoting\nneighborhood safety, commenting that getting involved\n\"could be dangerous.\"\nCommunityAssets.The second group meeting focused on the\nstrengths and assets of the community. When participants were\nasked about what they considered to be positive community\nresources, it was difficult for them to reflect on \"community\nstrengths or assets.\" When we prompted them to express their\npersonal strengths, a different range of ideas came easily, from\nbeing a supportive/caring person and volunteering to helping\nelders and having good housekeeping abilities.\nHowever, the only thing that the group mentioned with\nregard to \"community capacity\" was \"community together-\nness,\" referring to the large event Come Home Year 2008,\nwhich brought many of the people in the town together.\nDuring this event, the community kitchen set up a booth to\nprovide snacks, increasing the group's visibility in the com-\nmunity. As in the previous session, participants felt events\nand gatherings are needed \"to catch the interest of others in\ncommunity actions to promote health\" and to make a con-\ncentrated effort in finding alternative funding to sustain the\ncommunity kitchen. They also emphasized as positive a\n6-week program designed by the community center staff to\nprepare people for working opportunities, which has been\nbeneficial \"in raising self-esteem.\"\nWhen prompted again to think of other community\nstrengths, group participants highlighted needs instead, includ-\ning (a) more personal commitment and community participa-\ntion; (b) finding ways to help the community; (c) helping kids\nto stay in school, achieve higher education, and have better\njob opportunities; (d) knowing how to get a job or having\nmore incentive for people to get off income support; (e) a new\nliteracy program for all ages; (f) skills development for all\nages; (g) supporting elders, youth, single parents, and minori-\nties; (h) a neighborhood watch; (i) education for parents/\npolicy support; (j) social outings and recreational activities\nfor all ages; (k) home support for new mothers; (l) more\ninvolvement in community well-being from government,\ngeneral population, and youth; (m) fighting against drugs\nand alcohol; and (n) implementing a community van or pub-\nlic transportation. Their lack of power to tackle these com-\nplex issues themselves was evident throughout the research.\nThe Challenges of CommunityTransportation and Par-\nticipatory Engagement. During the third meeting, we\ninvited participants to choose a priority out of the main areas\nof interest discussed in the previous session. Participants\nchose to discuss the need for a community van, as the lack of\npublic transportation is a major issue for the people in the\nneighborhood. However, it was a challenge to get people to\ntackle this issue and engage in the solutions to their own\nproblems. The common response was \"let's talk to [the direc-\ntor of the center] about it to see what he can do.\" Participants\nfelt discouraged: in a previous attempt a couple of years\nbefore, they had had a van serving the neighborhood for a few\nweeks, but the service was shut down due to the influence of\nthe local taxi company. Events such as this illustrate how\ninstitutionalized power relations hamper a community's sense\nof control and reinforce a \"why bother\" attitude.\nSelf-evaluation survey. The final session involved a written\nevaluation of the kitchen program and brainstorming of ways\nto add the community garden idea to the community kitchen\nproject to apply for a further institutional grant. The evalua-\ntion and consultation with community members was sug-\ngested by the researcher, but only five participants and three\nstaff members were present in the final session.\nThe community kitchen was not only valued as a space for\nhealth education and nutrition, but more importantly, it also\nacted as a place for socializing and recreation, which might be\na far more relevant outcome to judge from people's expres-\nsions and experiences. Still, a main drawback was the pro-\ngram's sustainability due to the lack of consistent funding.\nParticipants considered the greenhouse and the community\ngarden positive adds-on to the community kitchen program.\nThey recommended that the garden be located close to the\ncommunity center so that everyone would benefit from it.\nHowever, they also suggested fencing the garden due to pos-\nsible vandalism and a lack of trust in some of their neighbors.\nReflection on Research Site A\nThe community center staff care about the community par-\nticipants, and community members consider staff \"nice at\ndoing their jobs.\" In the service provider\u00adclient dynamic\nthat we observed, community members tended to rely on\ncommunity center staff to handle problems, as was noted\nwith the transportation issue and, previously, with the addic-\ntions and vandalism problems in the area. Another evidence\nof the participants' lack of initiative is the way the kitchen\n6 SAGE Open\nprogram is organized. To guarantee participation in the\nkitchen sessions, the kitchen coordinator telephones to ask\nwho is available for the next day as a sort of invitation or\nreminder. When there is only a calendar of sessions or when\nthere is no reminder, people tend to simply forget.\nStaff members feel immense pressure to show the results of\ntheir hard work. With inconsistent, limited, short-term fund-\ning, service providers tend to develop proposals based on what\nis offered by the funding agencies. With this in mind, they\noften write proposals for neighborhood programs with little or\nno consultation from the potential participants. As they cannot\nbe sure that they will get the funding, they argue that they pre-\nfer not to create expectations in the participants. Considering\nthe institutional setting of social assistance, the risk of devel-\noping patronizing relationships with participants is perma-\nnent, perpetuating the cycle of dependency. The complexity of\nthis dynamic is clearly expressed by a staff member:\nHere, their parents were in the system, they're in the\nsystem, their children are in the system. And that cycle\nnever seems to be broken . . . they can't live without\nthe government now because they do not make\nenough. If they go out to work for minimum wage,\nthey're making less than being home on social ser-\nvices because then they got to pay their own rent, their\nown drugs, their heat and lights.\nFor different reasons, lack of trust among neighbors is com-\nmon, and although some families live in the neighborhood for\ngenerations, mobility is also high due to the transient nature of\nthe subsidized housing program. This poses another problem in\ngaining consistent participation, as some people may move as\nsoon as they can afford a different living arrangement.\nDue to the complexity of problems arising from low-\nincome sectors, a focus on healthy eating proved to be very\nlimited in its approach, and thus it is also important to explore\nways to improve the unequal distribution of access to social\nand economic resources.\nProgram at Site B\nFollowing the call for grant applications, the program at Site B\nfocused on all the priorities of the Provincial Wellness Grant\nProgram, seeking to promote general good health and well-\nbeing. The Recreation Committee, who presented the proposal,\nwelcomed the research project and expressed its decision to use\nthe grant money to support wellness activities such as seniors'\nmobilization, catering for outreach events, buying sports equip-\nment such as basketballs, and for transporting people to and\nfrom a swimming pool in another community.\nSummary of the Collected Data\nProgram Background. The Recreation Committee, formed\nby 12 women in this small community of about 200 persons,\nwas determined to keep the community center running and\nto provide wellness activities, as the center is the only\nplace for socializing in the area. About 25 years ago, the\nchurch donated the community center building to the town\nand for a long time, it was used only occasionally for danc-\ning or darts.\nThe community is one of a group of four very small iso-\nlated towns in the area with a total population of 870 people.\nAlthough there is no history of cooperation between these\ncommunities, things may change for the new generation as\nchildren from all four communities now share a K-12 school.\nAlmost half of the population between ages 18 and 64 have\nnot finished high school. Out-migration has been high, and\npersonal income per capita (after tax) was Can$10,800 in\nin the region. A total of 65.9% worked seasonally and sup-\nplemented this income with employment insurance, whereas\nratio--a measure of the community's dependence on gov-\nernment transfers--was 54.8% (Newfoundland and Labrador\nHealth Concerns. As at the other research site, the focus of\nthe first session was to discuss the question \"What things are\nmost important to me in terms of my health?\" The three dis-\ncussion groups during this session noted three areas of impor-\ntance: (a) getting exercise; (b) enjoying outdoor activities,\nsuch as gardening--a self-sustaining activity for some of the\nparticipants; and (c) eating healthy, home-cooked food. Other\nimportant aspects included being around their children and\ndoing activities with them, getting enough sleep, volunteer\nwork, cooperative living and support for each other, access to\ncommunity services, socializing, stress-free life, and the free-\ndom of living in a small community: \"a safe place for chil-\ndren to grow up.\" Some participants smoked, but only one of\nthe participants, in private, mentioned quitting smoking.\nIn response to the question \"What things are most impor-\ntant when we think about health in our communities?\" par-\nticipants focused on caring for their physical environment\nand the outdoors. A couple of gardeners who grew vegetables\nand flowers every summer suggested starting a community\ngarden to get children and seniors engaged in active living.\nParticipants also considered organizing a wellness fair to\nshare their ideas and experiences with the other communities\nnearby, with the expectation that people in these towns may want\nto join in on activities at the local recreation center or set up well-\nness activities in their own towns. Like in Site A, they also con-\nsideredsocialeventsagoodstrategyforbringingpeopletogether,\nas a recurrent complaint was the lack of participation.\nCommunityAssets.During the second meeting, there were 25\nparticipants and the focus was on strengths and assets in the\ncommunity. They felt positive about (a) the Entertainment/\nRecreation Committee; (b) the fire brigade; (c) a small church\nTraverso-Yepez et al. 7\ngroup; (d) the \"Come Home\" Committee, which was organiz-\ning a gathering for 2012; (e) celebrating holidays with dances\n(i.e., Halloween, Canada Day, Christmas, New Year's Eve,\nValentine's, and St. Patrick's Day); and (f) hobbies such as\nfishing and gardening. In addition, they were glad that (thanks\nto the community center) seniors, who were rarely active, had\nbecome engaged in activities such as storytelling and Bingo.\nA significantly gendered attitude toward active living was\nhighlighted. Participants asserted that when men retire or are\nwithout work, they tend to be more sedentary than women.\nAs some of the women commented, they \"just watch TV or\nhang with friends.\" They spoke fondly of a now-defunct\nsoftball team in the community, and shared the concern of\ntrying to engage men and youth in outdoor activities.\nConflict and Loss of Leadership. In an informal meeting\nat Memorial University with the two leaders of the Recre-\nation Committee before the next scheduled group meeting,\nthe leaders expressed great expectations about the following\ngroup discussion to define the activities to be developed dur-\ning the next months. Unfortunately, the scheduled meeting\nwas canceled because of conflict and division in the Recre-\nation Committee. These two leaders and primary contacts, as\nwell as two other members, resigned and stepped down from\nthe committee, creating a leadership void.\nMeeting the Remaining Members.After the PI contacted\nthe remaining committee members, we organized a new\nmeeting with them. They discussed the positive outcomes of\nthe Wellness Grant, which had given them resources for\nkeeping the community center functioning, allowing them to\ndevelop activities with seniors and children, to celebrate\nevents, and to hold an exercise class on Mondays and Thurs-\ndays. They emphasized that seniors enjoy meeting at the\ncommunity center and it may be the only activity outside\ntheir home available to them. Committee members insisted\non the idea of bringing in more participants and encouraging\ncommunity members to become vocal about the future of the\nRecreation Committee. They suggested a forum, decided in\nfavor of a written evaluation, and anticipated a high number\nof participants to the event. The date was set for a week later,\nand they agreed to invite a well-known regional physical\neducator as a motivational guest speaker. However, without\nleadership, there was less enthusiasm.\nSite B self-evaluation survey and public forum. It was\nnotable that instead of doing the organizing themselves, the\ncommittee decided to hire a former committee chair not liv-\ning regularly in town to organize and facilitate the public\nforum, prepare the draft of the survey, and be responsible for\nthe reports for the Wellness Grant authorities. The limita-\ntions for engaging participants were again evident, as only\n13 local adults and 6 children attended. They handed in the\nself-evaluation survey at the end of the meeting. All the\ncommunity members considered the community center a\npositive asset, and with different expressions agreed that\nthey enjoy the community center events and the sense of\ncommunity these events provide. When asked about\nimprovements to community programs and events or sug-\ngestions for new programs, most participants requested the\ntraditional programs and information sessions encouraging\nhealthy lifestyles, such as healthy cooking classes and exer-\ncise programs.\nParticipants acknowledged in the survey that structured\nprograms and improvements to the community center require\nparticipation in and commitment to administrative tasks.\nHowever, only 2 out the 13 participants expressed willing-\nness to help in the tasks involved, and none of the partici-\npants wanted to assume a leadership role.\nReflection on Research Site B\nWhen visiting the areas near Site B, there is a sense of how\nisolated these rural communities are. Many of the houses are\nonly inhabited in the summertime. However, among those\nwho stayed year-round, it was evident that they enjoy the\nisolation of the community and \"living their way.\" At the\nbeginning, a sense of mistrust was expressed in informal\nconversation, as a couple of participants asked the PI, \"Why\ndo you bother coming this far?\"\nExcept for the most outspoken leaders (who resigned), the\nother members openly resisted getting involved in leadership\npositions. However, despite the conflicts within the Committee\nBoard, a sense of community is evident in the informal rela-\ntionships they maintain. They all know their neighbors, who\nare often family related and are open to help in critical situa-\ntions, especially with the elderly population.\nDiscussion of Research Findings\nAlthough Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are often known\nfor their sense of community, we questioned whether this sense\nof community held the same connotations as the rhetoric\naround the often reified terms of community and community\ncapacity found in some academic definitions and official docu-\nments. This research endeavor faced limitations: the geograph-\nical distance of the research site, the short-term funding of the\nprograms, and the ambivalence of the programs' funding\nagency with regard to involvement in the research. Our status\nas \"outsiders\" placed additional limits on our research with\nboth funding agencies and community groups.\nOther research efforts conducted in this rural area (Eastern\nregions of rural NL (Close, Rowe, & Wheaton, 2007; Gray\ncautious attitude toward outsiders as well as an evident\naversion to formal community involvement and/or assum-\ning leadership roles. Critical international literature on this\ntopic argues that organized grassroots groups are usually\npart of the \"better-off\" sectors of society, whereas in many\nsmall communities and low-income sectors, informal cul-\ntures of engagement prevail (Williams, 2004).\n8 SAGE Open\nThe evaluations of the Newfoundland and Labrador\nHeart Health Program (2002; Holmes, Neville, Donovan,\n& MacDonald, 2001) and the subsequent PWP (Department\nof Health and Community Services--Government of\nNewfoundland and Labrador, 2008) also identified that\nthere is a need for continued resources and efforts to\nenhance leadership and the capacity to mobilize communi-\nties, to recruit and train participants, and to maintain ongo-\ning communication of shared knowledge and experiences.\nAs these concerns remain part of the PWP's rhetoric, the\nresearchers juggled this challenge with the main research\nagenda, focusing on whether the PWP programs could ade-\nquately engage local people within the unique context of\neach group. Instead of simply accepting the official rhetoric,\nthe social complexities of community groups prompted the\nmain researcher to focus on studying the particular commu-\nnity dynamic (i.e., geographic and social background) of\neach program in these two different sites and explore the spe-\ncific situational context as related to both institutional public\nhealth practices and to the way services and programs are\nprovided. We also investigated how much participation is\ninfluenced by the particular forms of subjectivity and citi-\nzenship that the sociocultural environment is generating with\nsocial context, institutional practices, and forms of subjectiv-\nity are intricately interdependent, and recognizing this com-\nplexity might help us to reflect on ways to develop more\nefficient intervention practices.\nThe Social Context\nIn the case of Site A, the program was designed as a service\nto a particular neighborhood, characterized by low-income\nresidents and exposure to different degrees of social exclu-\nsion and vulnerability (Stephens, 2008). Our research shows\nthat a sense of cohesion and a sense of control are very lim-\nited among people living on social assistance. Although their\nhealth is highly influenced by the conditions in which they\nlive, people often seemed powerless to make any kind of\nchange about \"the way things are,\" as clearly evidenced in\nthe case of the public transport issue. Dependency on others\nto provide for them is a learned behavior and influences their\nability to make changes in their lives. They usually rely on\nwhat paid community center staff, as intermediaries in the\nprovision of these programs, can provide.\nWe witnessed that the most popular programs in the\nneighborhood are those addressing more vital services for\nfamilies, such as early childhood and children's school sup-\nport, and those that provide work experience, as most of our\nparticipants wanted to find a job. Nonetheless, the way fund-\ning is provided forces community center staff, as much as\nother service providers, to offer the services within a top-\ndown relationship. As funding is not always guaranteed, they\nare hesitant to consult with community members for fear of\ncreating expectations that may go unfulfilled.\nStaff are usually constrained by limited economic resources\nas well as by the complexity of the problems involved. People\nopen to receiving services tend to passively avail of what is\noffered. Still, for some socially disadvantaged groups, health-\nfocused programs may even be perceived as an additional\nsource of stigma and therefore a space for resistance; this is\nlikely one of the reasons why some people refuse to partici-\npate (Stead, McDermott, MacKintosh, & Adamson, 2011).\nThe sense of community was often expressed in informal\nways through \"looking out for the elderly people in the neigh-\nborhood\" and \"caring for family and friends in need.\" The fact\nthat grassroots members in these community groups often do\nnot fit with our academic conceptions does not by any means\nimply a lack of skill on the part of residents or even staff. More\nvulnerable sectors of society are more likely to engage in\n\"informal\" community relationships (Chappell, Funk, &\n2004). While these informal supportive interactions are not\noften identified by community members as social capital or\ncommunity capacity, they still have beneficial effects for the\npeople involved. Failing to see this different kind of engage-\nment, as Williams states, \"not only underemphasizes a culture\nof community participation that is widespread but also ends up\nimposing onto less affluent groups a relatively foreign form of\ncommunity involvement that does not mirror their current par-\nSimilarly, there are challenges often faced by rural, iso-\nlated communities in NL that were observed at Site B. One\ndifficulty encountered is community members conditioned\nto staying within small, familial networks, \"minding only\ntheir own business.\" While we uncovered much evidence of\nhow important informal social relationships have been for\nthe well-being and survival of community members, there\nwas an overt rejection of engagement in the Recreation\nCommittee's tasks, which ended with the resignation of the\nmain leaders of the organization.\nHowever, as Mowbray (2005) argues, government-funded\ncommunity programs may not be adequately tailored and/or\nappropriate for populations with low levels of formal social\ncohesion. In these cases, capacity building strategies to\nengage people in the programs must be part of the human\ninvestment, both in the case of nongovernmental organiza-\ntions as well as less-structured groups lacking the necessary\nThis fact moves us to analyze the institutional background.\nThe Institutional Public Health Practices\nResearch findings reveal that there are challenges to\nparticipatory-action endeavors without structural support,\nlocal resources, and contextual considerations of the manner\nin which health promotion services and programs are pro-\nvided (Carr, Lhussier, Wilkinson, & Gleadhill, 2008).\nThe broad mandate of the government funding agency\nand the prevailing biomedical model of public health have\nTraverso-Yepez et al. 9\ninstitutionalized vertical forms of intervention (Bunton,\napproach prevails, and both service providers and lay peo-\nple have in mind this expert\u00adhealth consumer relationship.\nWhile participants were discussing the youth with prob-\nlems in the neighborhood, for example, the focus was on\npathologizing the condition, disregarding the social, eco-\nnomic, and political environment of the issue. The expec-\ntation for a solution was then placed upon the addictions\nexpert. Also evidenced in the selection process and the\nofficial literature of the PWP is the fact that the health pro-\nmotion interventions that receive funding are mainly\naddressed to change individual lifestyles and behaviors.\nThe challenge remains to incorporate the role of the socio-\neconomic and cultural environments influencing the\n\"unhealthy\" choices.\nDuring the research process, we experienced firsthand\nthat without a joint commitment with programs' funding\nagencies, our ability to support the capacity building of both\nresearch sites was limited, as the two groups were only\naccountable to the agencies from which they received fund-\ning. Although Wellness Consultants maintained sporadic\ncontact with both community groups throughout the research\nprocess, Newfoundland's geography and other structural\nlimitations (i.e., consultants' workloads and other institu-\ntional priorities) prevented the consultants from being per-\nsonally involved with the researchers and participants in\nthese communities and from developing a parallel \"empow-\nering\" track, as suggested by Labonte et al. (2002), Laverack\nWe contend that the level of commitment for capacity\nbuilding should function both ways: a political, top-down\nconviction on what is facilitated and a bottom-up involve-\nment in what is likely to be achieved. This relationship is\nalways interdependent, as neither group can achieve its\ngoals without the other (Laverack & Labonte, 2000). To\nvisualize this experience, Figure 1 depicts the research\nenvironment.\nThe Social Environment and Forms\nof Subjectivity and Citizenship\nHaving highlighted the local and institutional constraints, we\nwould also like to highlight the strong macroeconomic forces\nat work against the formation of meaningful relationships in\nthe society. Globalization has made governments more likely\nto submit to the pressures of transnational market forces,\nwhere policies tend to be neoliberal/market driven, encourag-\ning people to see themselves as consumers of services, rather\nthan as participant citizens with rights and responsibilities. In\naddition to consumerism, wherein well-being is expected to\ncome from external sources--for example, buying and using\nproducts and services produced by professionals and\nexperts--individualism is another stronghold of the market-\ndriven economy, as human beings are considered self-made\nagents whose plans, intentions, and behaviors take place in\nisolation from others and their broader environment\nwe lose a sense of being able to work with fellow citizens\ntoward a common goal, the more the notion of community\nbecomes nothing more than an idealized dream.\nThere is a contrast between the health promotion rhetoric\nof participation and capacity building and the individualism\nand consumerism trends encouraged by the economic sys-\ntem. Apart from health care, vital services and programs\nrelated to wellness in neoliberal societies like Canada's are\ntreated as an individual/private concern, and the current\ninstitution of health promotion programs with limited, short-\nterm funding seems to mainly target the most vulnerable sec-\ntors of society. This minimalistic approach does not favor the\ncreation and development of a sense of community.\nThere is also a culture of dependence on government ser-\nvices, which reflects the unanticipated effect of the provision\nof the social safety net in the postwar period of the 1950s; and\nmore importantly, in the case of rural NL, after the collapse of\nthe cod fishery and the moratoria imposed by the federal\nrural communities moved away from self-sufficiency and\nbecame more dependent on services provided by govern-\nment agencies.\nFinal Considerations\nOur research demonstrates that communities are dynamic,\nmobile systems formed through the specific motivations of\nparticipants, with the power to avail (or not) of organiza-\ntional resources and human and social capital to engage in\nhigher levels of commitment. Consequently, it is clear that\ncommunity capacity building cannot be designed or planned\nfrom outside, but must be consensually built by the stake-\nholders involved.\nIn our work with Sites A and B, we witnessed a demand\nfor a broader approach to health and more intersectoral part-\nnerships at the local, municipal, regional, and provincial\nFigure 1.Visualization of relationship between researchers and\nother parties\nlevels. Distant/isolated communities and low-income sectors\nof NL may benefit from partnerships between the health sec-\ntor, the Rural Secretariat, and local municipalities to support\nmore integrated capacity building efforts. However, the\nhealth sector and the Rural Secretariat continue working\nwithin their own domains.\nAs these expectations were also beyond our power as\nresearchers, we experienced firsthand the importance of a\nflexible program structure in addressing the unique circum-\nstances of the two specific community groups (Carr et al.,\n2008). We learned once again that, considering the power\nrelations and conflicts that are present in any social interac-\ntion, whenever immersed in community actions and working\ntoward a common good, it seems more appropriate to think\nabout \"community capacity building\" in terms of a dynamic\nset of values involving different degrees of commitment,\nsolidarity, and, most importantly, openness to negotiating\ndifferences.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research has\nbeen funded by grants to Martha Traverso-Yepez from the Industrial\nMemorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) Medicine Start-Up\nReferences\nBaker, E.
