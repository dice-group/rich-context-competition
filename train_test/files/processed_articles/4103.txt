Across occupations, workers' ability\nto control their schedules decreases their job-related stress. The results show that different dimensions of worktime control\n(WTC) affect workers in different occupations in distinctive ways, offering a corrective to prior work that combines workers\nwho occupy different locations in the system of social stratification. Among nursing assistants--the most socially marginalized\ngroup in the study--the relationships between particular aspects of WTC and job stress were distinct from those associations\namong the other three occupations, reinforcing the importance of examining these relationships in occupationally specific\ncontexts. This kind of comparative perspective illuminates the ways distributions of intangible resources such as WTC both\nemerge from and reinforce existing patterns of social stratification.

Wal-Mart's automated system alerts managers when\nworkers approach 40 hours, so those managers can send\nworkers home before they would qualify for either full-\ntime benefits or overtime (Negrey, 2012). At the same time,\nmore and more workers are classified as \"exempt\" from\novertime pay and are pushed to work longer hours without\nadditional compensation (Negrey, 2012). As the American\neconomy becomes increasingly bifurcated into these two\nkinds of employment, an ever-growing proportion of workers\nface diminishing control over their work time. This loss of\ncontrol is of particular concern because control over one's\nworking environment is associated with both physical and\nmental health--critical elements of well-functioning econ-\nomies and societies (Marmot, Bosma, Hemingway, Brunner,\nControlling work hours has long been a point of conten-\ntion between workers and employers. Economic conditions\nsince the beginning of the \"Great Recession\" have only made\ndisputes over work time more intense. Although both those\nwho struggle to find sufficient hours and those who contend\nwith long hours and overwork feel economically trapped and\nsocially coerced, the nature of these disputes vary across a\nences in the ways differently situated workers are impacted\nby different kinds of struggles for worktime control (WTC)\nthat are the focus of this article. I investigate how the lives of\nworkers in a stratified labor market are differently affected\nby varying distributions and kinds of control over their work\ntime. The simultaneous examination of the effects of different\nkinds of control on different kinds of workers will contribute\nto our understanding of how processes related to WTC are\nimplicated in maintaining social inequality.\n1University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJackie Stein, Department of Sociology, University of Massachusetts,\nEmail: jacklyn@soc.umass.edu\nThe Impacts of Worktime Control\nin Context: A Comparison Across\nOccupations in the U.S. Health Care\nIndustry\nJackie Stein1\n Keywords\nwork hours, schedule control, gender, class, occupational stratification\n2 SAGE Open\nThis study is grounded by JoanAcker's concept of inequal-\nity regimes. Acker (2009) holds that persistent inequalities\nare created, maintained, and reproduced through \"the every-\nday practices of organization participants\" (p. 213). The\nworkers in this study are all from the health care industry,\nworking under conditions of unpredictable demands in a\n24-hr cycle of care, where navigating control over working\ntime is a central \"everyday practice.\" Drawing upon Acker,\nthe driving question underlying this article is as follows: In\nwhat ways is the availability and distribution of WTC impli-\ncated in the processes of stratification? More concretely, this\nstudy was guided by three research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the relationships between\nvarious dimensions of WTC and job-related stress?\nResearch Question 2: How do these relationships differ\nacross health care occupations differentiated by class,\ngender, and race?\nResearch Question 3: What do these different relation-\nships reveal about the role of WTC in organizational\nprocesses of stratification?\nI expect that worker control over work time is an impor-\ntant predictor of worker distress across occupations, net the\ntotal number of hours worked. Furthermore, I argue that the\ncharacter of this relationship between WTC and distress\nvaries across these occupations in ways that reflect the gen-\nder, class, and race systems that shape these occupations.\nBecause control over work time, like other social resources,\nis distributed based on systems of social stratification, its\nconsequences for worker health and well-being arguably\nperpetuate this societal stratification. The distribution of\nthese material consequences can impact workers' lives in a\nway that shapes their paths in the labor market and their life\ncourses, more broadly.\nBackground: Stratification Within the\nU.S. Health Care Industry\nIn the United States, the health care industry provides a par-\nticularly appropriate setting in which to study variations in\ncontrol over work time. It is an industry known for its 24/7\nschedule and thus the continuous temporal demands it places\non its workers. The industry is also rapidly growing, both in\nworkers and in cost. It was one of the largest industry sectors\nservices sector is projected to have both the largest and the\nlion new jobs expected during that time (Torpey, 2014).\nHealth care spending is projected to comprise more than\n25% of the total federal budget in fiscal year 2015 (National\nPriorities Project, 2015). With this kind of growth, and due to\nwidespread publicity over the recently enacted health care\nlaw (the Affordable Care Act), the health care industry is\nunder increasing budgetary scrutiny. This scrutiny, in turn,\nputs pressure on health care\u00adproviding organizations to\nlower costs--among which worker pay features prominently.\nImportantly, in addition to being increasingly dominant\nforces in the landscape of work, these organizations in the\nhealth care industry are also places of visible segmentation\nby gender, race, and class, making them crucial sites for\nstudying the processes that maintain inequality.\nThis study focuses on four occupations within this indus-\ntry: physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians\n(EMTs), and certified nursing assistants (CNAs)--jobs that\nare highly stratified by gender, class, and race (Glazer, 1991;\nall registered nurses and CNAs are women (about 90% of\neach), while women make up 36% of physicians and sur-\nThe annual median wage nationally for family- and general-\npractice physicians (who are among the lower paid physi-\nour data, more than 30% of nurses and EMTs have bache-\nlor's degrees, compared with fewer than 4% of CNAs.\nMoreover, all physicians have master's degrees plus addi-\ntional graduate-level education, the minimum required by\nthe American Medical Association to practice (American\nMedical Association, 2012). Thus, in their gender, education,\nand income profiles, these occupations are quite distinct.\nCNAs are particularly distinct from the other three occu-\npations. In addition to being predominantly female and hav-\ning the lowest incomes and educations, CNAs are the only\noccupation of the four that is not majority White. Whites\nmake up fewer than half of these workers, nationally, and\nAfrican Americans about 36%. By contrast, 83% of EMTs\nare White. Nurses and physicians fall in between with 75%\nand 68% of these occupations, respectively, represented by\nracial minority representation among nurses, African\nAmericans make up about half, whereas among physicians\nthe predominant minority race is Asian (Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2013a). In health care, as in other industries, peo-\nple of color (especially African Americans and Latina/os) are\ndisproportionately represented in the lowest paid jobs (Slack\nThe distinct social locations of these occupations within\nthe same industry--and in some cases, within the same orga-\nnizations--provide a unique opportunity for comparison. The\nliterature about work time suggests that the same societal\nhierarchies that divide these occupations are also manifested\nin distinct patterns of work hours and schedules for each of\nthese groups of workers (Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Clawson,\ncomparisons with one another. CNAs are in a particularly\ndisadvantaged position compared with the other occupations\nin facing race, class, and gender marginalization, and thus we\nexpect this group might have a unique pattern in the relation-\nship between WTC and worker outcomes.\nUsing this comparative lens across occupations, this study\nextends the current literature by looking specifically at how\naccess to control over work hours and schedules impacts\ndifferently-situated workers, net the total hours themselves.\nIt also explores the implications for workers of this differen-\ntial access to WTC--both as a reflection of worker power\nand as a mechanism reinforcing the processes that maintain\noccupational stratification.\nLiterature Review\nControl Over Work Time\nControl over the conditions of work has long been associated\nwith worker stress and distress outcomes. Theories generally\nhold that greater control over one's job reduces worker\nstress (Collins, Karasek, & Costas, 2005; Hausser, Mojzisch,\n& Willemsen, 2004). Control over the time one spends work-\ning is integral to a sense of control at work and, over the past\ndecade, scholars have begun to separate out, theoretically,\nworkers' control over working time from control over other\nwork conditions. Employee control over work time or WTC\ngauges the discretion individual workers feel in determining\nthe amount and scheduling of their working time (Beckers,\nKompier, Kecklund, & H\u00e4rm\u00e4, 2012; Berg, Appelbaum,\nBailey, & Kalleberg, 2004; H\u00e4rm\u00e4, Kompier, & Vahtera,\ncontrol over starting and ending times, break times, vacation\nor time off, distribution of workdays over the week, quantity\nof hours, and whether and when to work overtime (Geurts,\nBeckers, Taris, Kompier, & Smulders, 2008; Moen et al.,\nSeveral long-standing theories tie WTC to worker well-\nbeing. Effort-recovery theory suggests that WTC enables\nworkers to balance effort with recovery, whether through the\ncontrol of break times while at work or recuperation through\ncontrol of time spent away from work (Meijman & Mulder,\n1998). Looking at WTC as a subdimension of general auton-\nomy, self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), the job\ncharacteristic model (Hackman & Oldham, 1976), and the\ndemands-control model (Karasek, 1979; Karasek & Theorell,\n1991), all suggest that increased WTC may stimulate worker\nmotivation, improve health and performance, and prevent\nstress. These effects of greater WTC are proposed to derive\nfrom at least two processes: utilization, where workers actu-\nally change their working time, or through perception, where\nthe opportunity to self-determine work hours helps workers,\nregardless of an actual change in amount of working time\n(Beckers et al., 2012). Finally, theories of work\u00adhome interac-\ntion suggest that greater WTC might improve work/nonwork\nbalance (and thus prevent stress) through workers' ability to\nadjust working time to meet the needs and obligations of their\nA broad literature in fields ranging from applied ergo-\nnomics to management to public health and sociology offers\nevidence to support these theories, suggesting a positive rela-\ntionship between workers'control over the timing and length\nof their work hours and their well-being. Outcomes related to\nincreased WTC include reduced physical and psychological\ndistress (Costa, Sartori, & \u00c5kerstedt, 2006; de Jonge,\nVegchel, Shimazu, Schaufeli, & Dormann, 2010; D'Souza,\nStrazdins, Lim, Broom, & Rodgers, 2003; Takahashi et al.,\n2011), reduced sense of work\u00adfamily conflict (Fenwick &\net al., 2008), a greater feeling of income adequacy (Moen\nreduced rates of sickness-related absence from work (Ala-\nMursula et al., 2006; Ala-Mursula, Vahtera, Linna, Pentti, &\nDespite the myriad ways WTC seems to benefit workers,\na recent systematic review of the literature suggests that\nthere are still important gaps in our understanding of the rela-\ntionship between WTC and worker well-being (Nijp et al.,\n2012). Indeed, a recent study of hospital employees across\nEuropean countries found no effect of worktime autonomy\non workers' health (Pisljar, van der Lippe, & den Dulk,\n2011). Recent reviews suggest that prior research did not\nspecify the particular subdimensions of WTC and worker\nwell-being nor did it consider the differential benefits to\nworkers in different social positions (Hausser et al., 2010;\nNijp et al., 2012). These reviews suggest that teasing apart\nthe different aspects of control over work time would further\nour attempts to understand the buffering effects of WTC on\nworker well-being. This study begins to fill this gap in the\nliterature by looking at the effects of different aspects of\nWTC on workers in different occupations.\nOccupational Differences in Worktime\nExperiences\nThe effects of various aspects of WTC on well-being likely\ndepend on workers' different social positions (Nijp et al.,\n2012). In particular, the social stratification of power across\noccupations means schedule control is likely more available\nto workers in some jobs than others (Negrey, 2012). Recently,\ncross-country comparative studies have begun to explore the\nimpacts of social and institutional context on the relationship\nbetween WTC and worker well-being (Berg et al., 2004;\nbut comparison across social contexts within a society is still\nrare. When they are taken into account, these intrasocietal\nsocial contexts, such as occupation, are often added to a\nmodel as control variables, rather than a lens through which\n4 SAGE Open\nto look at the relationship between WTC and worker well-\nbeing outcomes (see, for example, Pisljar et al., 2011). In one\nexception the buffering effects of worker job control (includ-\ning WTC) on worker well-being were examined across\ndifferent occupational sectors in the Netherlands (de Jonge,\nDollard, Dormann, Le Blanc, & Houtman, 2000). They\nfound that the interactive relationship between job demands\nand job control depended on the occupational sector,\nsuggesting that looking at occupational context might\nimprove our understanding of specific WTC\u00adworker well-\nbeing relationships.\nFew studies explicitly compare the effects of WTC across\noccupational contexts differentiated by gender, class, and\nrace. However, some studies do compare the relationship\nbetween WTC and worker well-being at an individual\nlevel--across individuals with different positions in these\nsocial systems. For example, Takahashi et al. (2011) find that\nmost of the effects of WTC (control over daily working hours\nand days off) on well-being outcomes were the same regard-\nless of an individual's gender. In the exception, insomnia\nsymptoms decreased with control over daily working hours\nfor men, but not for women. Lyness et al. (2012) find that\nlack of control over work hours has greater negative conse-\nquences for women than for men. However, their analysis of\nthe relationship between schedule control and a particular set\nof worker consequences (work\u00adfamily conflict, job satisfac-\ntion, and organizational commitment) suggests that this rela-\ntionship might not vary by workers' social class (Lyness\net al., 2012). Nevertheless, low-wage or lower class workers\ntend to have less schedule control than workers in higher\nsocial class positions, both in the United States and cross-\nLooking at gender and class at an occupational level\nrather than an individual level is practically and analytically\nimportant because those compositions shape organizational\npolicies as well as the practices and responses of both\nand race do not simply serve as characteristics of individuals\nbut also as operating principles that shape the social ecolo-\ngies of occupations. Thus, rather than examining either a het-\nerogeneous collection of individuals scattered across a range\nof occupations or comparing men and women in the same\noccupation, this study's design takes as its central point of\ncomparison occupations that are segregated by race, gender,\nand class.\nAccording to both theory and empirical research, not only\nis the class location of an occupation associated with varied\nwork conditions, but an occupation where workers are pre-\ndominantly women tends to have a mode of operation that\ndiffers from an overwhelmingly male occupation and differs\nas well from one that is closer to gender balanced; so, too, an\noccupation that is racially segregated differs from one that is\n2012). This study's design maximizes the ability to explore\ndifferences in workers' experiences across these occupa-\ntional ecologies, thereby extending the models that are\ncurrently used to understand the relationship between WTC\nand worker well-being.\nThis occupational perspective also reflects a focus on the\norganizational processes shaping workers' lives. These pro-\ncesses sort jobs into types according to class, gender, and\nrace through everyday management practices that racialize\nand sexualize definitions of \"good\" job performance and\n\"skill\" (Acker, 2006). Such definitions are then used to jus-\ntify pay and other job characteristics, such as level of worker\ncontrol or autonomy (Acker, 2006). Thus, the activities asso-\nciated with each occupation are bound up with larger social\nand organizational processes and we look at occupations as\necologies shaped by these processes instead of controlling\nfor job characteristics individually. In other words, by\ncomparing experiences across occupations, rather than indi-\nviduals, this project focuses on the consequences of these\nsorting and tracking processes, specifically those related to\ncontrol over work time.\nHealth Care Occupations and WTC\nThis article looks specifically at health care occupations that\nvary in their gender, class, and racial composition. Health\ncare occupations are similar in that they generally require the\nphysical presence of the worker, which presents a set of\nunique scheduling demands. However, even among these\noccupations that require a physical presence, challenges to\nschedule control differ due to the gendered expectations of\nthe workers, the resources available to workers in different\noccupations, and the power balance between workers and\nemployers. Comparing occupations in health care can help\nus understand how workers in different social contexts and\nlocations are affected by WTC.\nGendered expectations of workers can compound differ-\nences in material resources among workers and these can\ntranslate into different scheduling needs. For example,\npredominantly male physicians are often able to enact a\n\"breadwinner\" paradigm. As salaried workers, they struggle\nagainst the constant pressure to work more hours (Jacobs &\nGerson, 2004), but they earn high enough wages that they\ncan either pay someone else to take care of their obligations\noutside of work--such as child care or cleaning--or have\nspouses who can manage the household because they often\ndo not work for wages or work part-time.\nHowever, predominantly female nurses, despite earning\nmoderate wages and being employed full-time, face gen-\ndered expectations to manage their children and household\nlife in addition to working for pay. Because their spouses\nalso typically work full-time, nurses often balance the cost of\nservices and the negotiation of work schedules so that they\ncan take care of home and care obligations themselves.\nCNAs--who are low-wage, predominantly female, and often\nwomen of color--frequently cannot afford to pay someone\nto take care of their obligations outside of work and also can-\nnot afford the loss of wages that would come with cutting\ndown on work time to take care of those obligations them-\nselves. They are often forced to choose between handling\nfamily emergencies--such as picking up a sick child from\nschool--and losing wages or possibly their job. In these\nways and others, gender and class forces interact to create\nnot only different levels of schedule control but also different\nneeds for control among different health care workers\nIn addition to being caught between the imperatives of\nfamily and wages, low-wage care workers, such as CNAs,\nalso continue to have the least access to policies that would\ngive them greater control over their schedules (Bond &\n2009). This lack of access to schedule control is of particular\nconcern for these workers who already have less control over\nother aspects of their jobs. As well as being paid less, nursing\nassistants are often marginalized by gendered and racialized\noccupational segregation into the \"dirty work\"--bearing the\nprimary responsibility for the \"dirtiest\" and most physically\nchallenging aspects of caregiving such as bathing, dressing,\nfeeding, and changing briefs and bedpans (Duffy, 2007;\nGlenn, 1992). Nurses' work, by contrast, typically involves\nmore managerial and less hands-on work: developing and\nmanaging nursing care plans, controlling and delivering\nmedicine, and assisting physicians during treatments and\nexams. With their physically demanding work, nursing assis-\ntants have some of the highest nonfatal injuries and illness\nrates for all U.S. occupations, the fourth highest in 2012\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013c). These factors all suggest\nthat the relationship between WTC and well-being for CNAs\nmight be unique among the four occupations.\nWorker Characteristics Affecting WTC\nThis study grounds itself in the perspective that workers'\nneeds for schedule control will differ across occupations that\nare divided in their gender and class compositions. We sug-\ngest that occupations themselves are systems sufficiently\nstratified by gender, race, and class that workers'experiences\nacross these occupations will reflect these dominant social\ndivisions, thus obviating the need to measure these as indi-\nvidual worker characteristics. However, the literature also\nsuggests accounting for other worker characteristics that\naffect access to WTC. A worker's age and marital and family\nstatus are often associated with use of \"flexible\" worktime\npolicies. Younger workers seem to use flexible scheduling\nmore than older workers (Allen, Herst, Bruck, & Sutton,\nhave less control over the timing of their work than married\nworkers, but the causal direction of this relationship is\nunclear because the effect seems largely attributable to the\nhigher schedule control found among workers with young\nchildren at home (especially women with preschool\u00adaged\nHermsen, & Billings, 2002). Single parenthood, as might be\nexpected, leads to much greater competition between work\ntime and family time than partnered parenthood (Kendig &\nBeyond partnership and parental status, some other work-\ning conditions seem likely to affect workers'access to sched-\nule control and the consequences of such control on worker\nwell-being. Unionized workers may have greater access to\nschedule control because they are likely to have better infor-\nmation about policies regulating such control than nonunion-\nized workers (Budd & Mumford, 2006). Workers whose\nhours include weekend work may have more stress associ-\nated with lack of WTC because weekend hours have been\nfound to be particularly stressful for workers in general\n(Clawson & Gerstel, 2014). Finally, workers whose paid\nwork hours come from more than one job (more than 60% of\nthe EMTs in this study) might be expected to have a different\nrelationship between WTC and well-being. We account for\neach of these factors in our analysis.\nResearch Agenda\nAs this review argues, an emerging wave of research has\nfocused on the effects that worker control over working\nhours has on worker quality of life, but this research is just\nbeginning to look comparatively across intrasocietal occupa-\ntional contexts and to tease apart the effects of particular sub-\ndimensions of WTC. The present study contributes a unique\nperspective to this emerging body of comparative work by\nlooking within the same country and industry at differences\nin worker experiences across occupational locations that are\nmarked by gender and class stratification. Furthermore, this\nstudy differentiates several dimensions of WTC, uniquely\ncreating an opportunity to examine how workers in specific\nsocial locations have both different needs and differential\naccess to particular manifestations of WTC.\nMethod\nData\nThe data for this project come from a mail survey of CNAs,\nnurses, physicians, and EMTs conducted in 2004 (for meth-\nodological discussion, see Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Gerstel,\nClawson, & Huyser, 2007). Since the survey was conducted,\ntime and money pressure on the health care industry and on\nworkers have only become more intense, and thus the find-\nings from these data likely represent a conservative estimate\nof the relationships we explore. The sample was drawn from\nMassachusetts, chosen to be demographically representative\nof the national population but also within easy driving dis-\ntance of the investigators' location (for the interview portion\n6 SAGE Open\nof the larger project of which this survey is a part). Because\nthe state requires workers in these occupations to register to\nmaintain legal certification, the sample frame was a current\nlist of all those legally certified for each occupation, allow-\ning the selection of a true random sample. Three waves of the\nsurvey were sent out. Of the 800 surveys, only 9.6% were\nreturned as not having accurate addresses, indicating that the\nlists were current and well maintained. Of the delivered\nsurveys, the overall response rate was an excellent 64.5%\nDescriptive statistics are in Table 1. In their income, edu-\ncation, and gender, participants' characteristics generally\nreflected the national populations of these workers. Racially,\na higher proportion of all the occupations among the survey\nparticipants were White than nationally, but this is represen-\ntative of the New England region. EMTs in this sample also\nhad slightly higher annual incomes than nationally. This may\nbe due to the high rate of second-job holding among EMTs,\nfor whom we report total income from all jobs.\nHaving a second job meant significantly higher total work\nhours among CNAs and EMTs, but not for physicians and\nnurses. CNAs who had second jobs worked an average of 19\nhr more per week than those who did not. EMTs with second\njobs worked an average of 14 hr more per week than those\nwithout. CNAs with second jobs averaged 35 hr per week at\ntheir main jobs and 23 hr per week at their second jobs.\nEMTs with second jobs averaged 43 hr per week at their\nmain jobs and 18 hr per week at their second jobs.\nAs discussed, this study uses occupations as the lens of\ncomparison, treating them as organizational ecologies, shaped\nby the gender, class, and race of the workers who predominate\nin that occupation. To illustrate this stratification to the reader,\nindicators of gender, race, and income are included in the\ndescriptive statistics. However, because of the study's design,\nthe regression models do not contain indicators of individual\nrespondents'class, gender, or race status. Instead, models were\nrun either within each occupation or including an occupation\nvariable as indicator of a particular social location.\nDependent Variable: Worker Job-Related Stress\nFollowing the WTC literature, reduced job stress is used to\nindicate increased worker well-being. Job stress was opera-\ntionalized as the response to the statement, \"My job really\nwears me out.\" Responses were captured on a 5-point Likert-\ntype scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree).\nIndependent Variables\nWTC variables\nControl over work time.Informed by the major theories\ntying WTC to worker well-being, four survey items measure\ndifferent subdimensions of the central explanatory concept:\nperceived control over work time. The first three measures\nare responses to various statements about work hours and\nschedules. On the survey, the following instructions intro-\nduced these items:\nSome people can choose their work hours and schedules and\nsome can't. Please rate the following statements on the following\nscale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree based on your\nmain job as a [occupation].\nTo measure workers' perceived ability to alter their\nwork schedules, the analysis includes responses to the\nstatement, \"I can change my schedule when I need to, even\non short notice.\" A second item measures workers' ability\nto adjust working time to meet the needs and obligations of\ntheir nonwork lives, using responses to \"I can always work\nextra hours when I want to,\" which touches on both time\nand monetary needs. To measure workers' sense of their\nability to self-determine their schedules, responses to \"My\nsupervisor pressures me to work additional hours\" are\nincluded. Each of these measures is coded such that higher\nnumbers indicate increased agreement with the statement,\nso a higher number on the \"I can change my schedule\"\nvariable indicates greater control, whereas a higher number\non the \"my supervisor pressures me\" indicates less control.\nThese items were standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) for easier\ncomparison.\nTo measure control over the amount of time spent away\nfrom work (a dimension of WTC associated with Effort-\nRecovery theory) and ability to balance work/ nonwork\ntime, a fourth measure compares workers' preferred quantity\nof hours with their actual reported work hours. This con-\ncept is sometimes called \"hours mismatch\" (Golden, 1996;\nReynolds, 2003). Unlike the other three measures of WTC,\nwhich asked somewhat explicitly for workers' perceptions\nof their own control over their work hours and schedules,\nthis variable attempts to capture workers' control over the\nquantity of hours they work in a more implicit way, based\non the differences between their realities and their prefer-\nences. The variable was constructed by combining two\nseparate self-reports of work hours. First, respondents\nreported the number of hours of paid employment they\nwould prefer to work each week. Several pages later, they\nreported the number of hours they worked last week (or\nusually). Using these two responses, we constructed a\ndichotomous dummy variable to differentiate those respon-\ndents who want to work fewer hours than they currently\nwork (coded 1) from those who want to work the same or\nmore hours than they currently work (coded 0).\nEach of these items captures different manifestations of\nWTC, which may have different relationships to distress.\nFactor analysis confirmed that these items tapped different\nconcepts, as they did not form a single scale. Thus, each is\nincluded in the model individually.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics (N = 420).\nVariable\nM SD Minimum Maximum M SD Minimum Maximum M SD Minimum Maximum M SD Minimum Maximum\nNote.

The analysis includes items measuring\nrespondents'age, union status, whether or not the respondent\nhas a second job, and their partnership and parental status.\nBased on previous research indicating the intertwined effects\nof partnership and parental status, I have combined these two\nfactors into a single measure with four values. Thus, single\nparents of young children (<6 years old) are compared with\nmarried or partnered parents of young children, married or\npartnered individuals who do not have young children, and\nsingle individuals who do not have young children.\nInteraction variables\nInteraction terms.To examine the different relationships\nbetween WTC and worker stress in different occupations,\nI created a set of multiplicative interaction terms, crossing\neach of the four occupations with each of the four main time\ncontrol variables.\nStatistical Methods\nThe baseline model for each occupation predicts worker job\nstress based on weekly work hours, controlling for some\nworker personal characteristics (Table2). This allows for an\nevaluation of the main effects of work hours on worker\njob stress. To this model for each occupation, I added WTC\nvariables to evaluate their effects on job stress and on the\nmain effect of work hours.\nIn addition, I ran an interactive model for each of the sub-\ndimensions of WTC (Table 3). These models include all four\noccupations, with dummy variables for each occupation and\ninteraction variables between each occupation and each\nWTC variable, to allow me to explore the differentiated\neffects of WTC on worker stress for different occupations. In\nthis kind of multiplicative interaction analysis, an \"omitted\"\nor base category forms the basis for comparison (CNAs in\nModels 9-11 and physicians in Model 12). Thus, the coeffi-\ncient for the WTC variable that is included in the interaction\nterm (e.g., supervisor pressure in Model 9) reflects the effect\nof this variable on job stress only for the base occupation\n(e.g., in Model 9, the coefficient of 0.227 reflects the rela-\ntionship between supervisor pressure and job stress only\namong CNAs). The coefficients for the interaction terms\n(e.g., \"Supervisor pressure \u00d7 EMT\") reflect the difference in\ncoefficient between the base occupation and the occupation\nin the interaction term. A positive and significant interaction\nterm indicates a significantly stronger relationship between\nthat WTC variable and job stress for the occupation in that\ninteraction term than for the base occupation (e.g., in Model\n9, nurses have a significantly stronger relationship between\nsupervisor pressure and job stress than do CNAs).\nWorker job stress is an ordered categorical variable with-\nout a fixed distance between categories. Thus, following\nLong (2004), I used ordinal logistic regression, the recom-\nmended model for this kind of variable (similar results were\nfound when the models were run as ordinary least squares\n[OLS] regressions). To maintain sample size and statistical\npower, I used multiple imputation (via chained equations; the\nICE command in Stata 12) to impute values for those that\nwere missing on several variables. To confirm that ordinal\nlogistic regression would be appropriate for the dependent\nvariable, I verified that the data do not violate the propor-\ntional odds assumption using a likelihood ratio test (omodel\nin Stata), which was nonsignificant (Institute for Digital\nResearch and Education, n.d.).\nResults\nThese results show that WTC does have a significant impact\non worker well-being. Importantly, the findings also show\nthat different dimensions of WTC affect the four occupations\nin distinctive ways, offering a corrective to prior work that\ndoes not distinguish between workers who occupy different\nlocations in the system of social stratification.\nTwo WTC measures significantly affected all groups\nexcept the CNAs: Feeling supervisor pressure to work more\nhours significantly increased stress, whereas workers' per-\nceived ability to change their work schedules significantly\ndecreased stress among physicians, nurses, and EMTs\n(Table 2). Some dimensions, however, affected only one\noccupational group: Wanting to work fewer hours signifi-\ncantly increased job-related stress only among CNAs,\nwhereas feeling able to \"always\" work extra hours signifi-\ncantly increased job-related stress only among physicians.\nWhen tested with an interaction model, this variation by occu-\npation was statistically significant only in the cases of the rela-\ntionships between work-related stress and either supervisor\npressure or wanting fewer hours (see next section).\nIn the base model without WTC variables, partnership\nand parental status was significantly associated with job\nstress among CNAs and physicians. For CNAs, being a sin-\ngle parent of young children was associated with the most\njob stress of any of the partnership/parental status combina-\ntions. CNA single parents' level of job stress was signifi-\ncantly higher than that of CNAs who were single and had no\nchildren or had older children. Among physicians, those who\nwere married or partnered with young children reported sig-\nnificantly less job stress than single physicians with either no\nchildren or older children. Interestingly, when WTC vari-\nables are added to the model, the significant effect of partner-\nship and parental status disappears for CNAs but intensifies\nfor physicians.\nTable 2.

One shows no\nrelationship for CNAs between one aspect of WTC (supervi-\nsor pressure) and job stress where the other occupations did,\nand another result shows a significant relationship for CNAs\nbetween job stress and a different aspect of WTC (hours mis-\nmatch) where other occupations did not. Table 3 contains\nfour models with interaction terms--one for each WTC vari-\nable. Only the first two (Models 9 and 10) show statistically\nsignificant differences between occupations in the WTC\u00adjob\nstress relationship.\nSupervisor pressure (Model 9).CNAs are the only occupa-\ntional group for whom there is not a significant relationship\nbetween increasing supervisor pressure to work more hours\nand job stress (Table 2, Model 2; Table 3, Model 9). The\npositive and significant interaction term for nurses in Model\n9 indicates that, for them, supervisor pressure has a signifi-\ncantly stronger relationship to job stress than for CNAs.\nFigure 1 illustrates these different relationships using pre-\ndicted probabilities of a worker agreeing that their job causes\nthem stress for varying levels of supervisor pressure. As\nsupervisor pressure to work more hours increases, so does\nthe probability of workers agreeing that their job wears them\nout for all occupations except for CNAs. The difference\nbetween CNAs and the other occupations in the relationship\nbetween supervisor pressure and job stress can be seen in the\nrelative flatness of the slope of the CNA line compared with\nthose of the three other occupations.\nWorker expectations for autonomy might be one possible\nexplanation for this finding. This variable captured workers'\nperceived ability to self-determine their schedules. As the\nleast powerful occupation out of the four studied, CNAs may\nhave lower expectations than the other three occupations\nfor their level of discretion at their workplace and thus not\nexperience greater stress when pressured by a supervisor.\nAlternatively, the chronic underemployment of CNAs--who\nare often seeking additional hours to have the income to pay\ntheir bills--might make supervisor pressure to work more\nhours a lesser source of job stress than, say, supervisor\nHours mismatch (Model 10).Among CNAs, there was a\nuniquely significant relationship between wanting to work\nfewer hours and job stress, different from all the other three\noccupations. CNAs who want to work fewer hours than they\ncurrently work reported significantly more job stress than\nthose CNAs who wanted the same or more hours than they\nwere working. This association was small and nonsignificant\nfor the other three occupations (Table 2). The negative and\nsignificant interaction terms in Model 10 (Table 3) show that\nthe relationship between wanting fewer hours and increased\nEMT\nPhys\nCNA\nNurses\nPredicted Probabilies of Agreeing with \"My job really wears me out\"\nSupervisor Pressure to Work More Hours (SD)\nFigure 1. Worker job stress by supervisor pressure to work more hours (moderated by occupation).\nNote. EMT = emergency medical technician; CNA = certified nursing assistant.\njob stress was significantly weaker among the other three\noccupations than for CNAs. Figure 2 presents a visual illus-\ntration of these differences. The line marking the drop in\nstress between workers who want to work fewer hours and\nthose who want the same or more hours is markedly steeper\nfor CNAs than for any of the other occupations.\nHours mismatch captures an aspect of WTC related to\nworkers' ability to recover from work through time away\nfrom work and their ability to balance work and nonwork\nobligations--related to both time and money. Workers across\nclass social locations report hours mismatches in the litera-\nture, but higher status and lower status workers tend to lack\ncontrol over this aspect of scheduling in opposite ways.\nMiddle- and upper-class workers tend to report excessive\nhours whereas lower-class workers tend to report deficient\nhours (Lyness et al., 2012). Thus, for higher wage workers, a\nsense of control is often more closely tied to being able to\nlimit one's hours, whereas for lower wage workers, a sense\nof control might emerge instead from being able to acquire\nenough hours to meet financial needs.\nThe unique salience of hours mismatches for CNAs may\nbe due to their unique position of marginalization compared\nwith the other occupations. Physicians and EMTs who want\nto cut back on their hours might be buffered from the stress\nof overwork by other mechanisms, such as the satisfaction of\nfitting in with the social norm of breadwinning. Nurses--\nwho face similarly gendered time demands as CNAs--may\nalso have greater material resources (because of their own\nwages and those of their partners) with which to deal with\nexcessive work hours. Although more research is needed to\ninvestigate this unique relationship among CNAs, the find-\nings here suggest that these workers' exceptionally draining\nwork experience results from a combination of an inability to\ncut back on hours of strenuous, low-paid work and having\nlittle social or financial buffer with which to cope with this\nlack of control.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis study analyzes the relationship between WTC and\nworker well-being in the context of specific occupations that\nare shaped by class, gender, and race. It teases apart both the\ndifferent relationships between control and distress across\noccupational ecologies and the different aspects of WTC that\nmight be relevant in each of those settings. The results sug-\ngest that the buffering effects of WTC depend on a match\nbetween the specific aspect of control and the kinds of\ndemands workers face, both of which depend on occupa-\ntional context. Importantly, this project's results also cor-\nroborate previous work that finds beneficial effects for\nworker well-being of worker-controlled scheduling flexibility\n(e.g., the ability to leave work early to pick up a sick child),\nrather than the kind of employer-controlled flexibility (e.g.,\ncalling people in or sending them home on short notice) that\noften creates unpredictability in workers'schedules (e.g., see\nCNA\nNurses\nPhysicians\nWant Fewer Hours Want More or Same Hours\nPredicted Probabilies of \"Agree\" with \"My job really wears me out\"\nFigure 2. Worker job stress by hours preference (moderated by occupation).\nNote. EMTs = emergency medical technicians; CNAs = certified nursing assistants.\nThis study's findings of the unique time control needs\namong CNAs illustrate why attention to particular aspects of\nWTC in specific occupational contexts is important. CNAs\nare the most socially marginal group of workers examined in\nthis study. They are the lowest paid, are predominantly\nfemale, and have an overrepresentation of women of color.\nAt this intersection of race and gender, workers are dispro-\nportionately likely to be employed in low-wage work (Jensen\n& Slack, 2003) and thus more likely than those in higher\nwage occupations to seek additional work hours to meet\nbasic family financial needs (Geiger-Brown, Muntaner,\nfinancial pressures may be especially acute for CNAs, many\nof whom are single parents or the sole or primary earners in\ntheir households (Kahn, 2006; Rakovski & Price-Glynn,\n2009). Attention to occupational context is critical to illumi-\nnating how the struggles of socially marginalized workers,\nsuch as CNAs, are compounded by the limited control this\narticle elucidates.\nThe financial exigencies that go into work hours calcula-\ntions for CNAs are emphasized by our finding that (a) for\nthese workers alone, the desire to cut back on hours was a\nsignificant predictor of stress but (b) supervisor pressure to\nwork additional hours had no relationship with job stress. In\nother words, something other than supervisor pressure keeps\nCNAs who are overworked in that situation. In interviews\nfrom the larger study of which this article is a part, CNAs\nwere torn between the trade-off between time and money\nembedded in this kind of hours mismatch. They simultane-\nously worried about not working enough to support their\nfamilies financiallyand also about not spending enough time\nwith their families. Unlike nurses, their wages were not suf-\nficient to make them comfortable choosing family time over\nadditional income. Although many workers struggle with\noverwork, it seems that CNA's experience is exacerbated by\nthis sense of ambivalence and the limited resources they\nmight use to buffer themselves.\nFrom this angle, looking at the case of CNAs suggests\nsome relatively straightforward--albeit politically charged--\nsolutions to improve conditions for these workers. Their fun-\ndamental bind is that their wages are too low to meet their\nfamilies' needs, but the very insufficiency of those wages\nincreases those needs, by requiring CNAs to maintain longer\npaid work hours instead of having the time to, for example,\nprovide their own child care. When combined with employer-\ncontrolled scheduling, these low wages leave CNAs in a par-\nticularly vulnerable position. CNAs report being regularly\nassigned fewer weekly hours than they would prefer, leaving\nthem in a constant search for extra hours to add to their\nschedules (Clawson & Gerstel, 2014). Employers save\nmoney through this kind of lean staffing. Furthermore, by\nkeeping weekly hours low, employers create a pool of work-\ners eager for more hours--workers they can call in whenever\nthey need extra labor, but who will not earn overtime wages\nwhen they pick up these extra shifts (Henly et al., 2006).\nRaising wages, providing subsidized child care, and giv-\ning workers paid sick leave are solutions that would benefit\nnot only these health care workers but also those for whom\nthese workers are providing care (Gornick & Meyers, 2008).\nKahn (2006) reports that strict attendance requirements at\nnursing homes lead some CNAs to \"report to work when\nthey themselves are ill, sometimes with contagious illnesses,\nin order to conserve possible discipline-incurring absences\nfor the occasions when they have sick children\" (p. 105). In\nthe larger study, we found the same patterns (Clawson &\nGerstel, 2014). Despite the danger to patients, management\nnot only permitted this practice of showing up to work sick\nbut even indirectly encouraged it because it might save\nmoney (Kahn, 2006). Thus, giving workers more control\nover their time in the form of paid leave for \"routine and non-\nroutine caregiving\" (Gornick & Meyers, 2008) is not only\nthe right thing to do for low-wage workers, it also benefits\nthe people for whom these workers care.\nIn addition to paid family leave, free or subsidized child\ncare and preschool would help all workers, especially those\nwho are forced to choose between time to earn money (often\nused to pay for child care) and time to spend with their chil-\ndren. Because these workers are often women, such policies\nwould particularly help to address gender- and class-based\ninequalities in terms of work time (Gornick & Meyers, 2008;\nWilliams, 2010). The United States, we should note, is shock-\ningly behind in this regard; ranking below most other devel-\noped nations in the provision of subsidized child care and pay\nUltimately, worktime scheduling is a way that workers bal-\nance many competing demands in their lives. Thus, policy\ncan and should address not only workers' control over work\ntime itself but also the pulls of those competing demands such\nas child care that are experienced by all workers.\nDespite a political and economic climate that might seem\nhostile to these worker-friendly policies, recent evidence\nsuggests cautious optimism. For example, although national\nlegislation on paid sick leave has proved elusive, states and\ncities have recently begun to take action on the issue. In\n2014, California and Massachusetts passed statewide paid\nsick days laws, joining Connecticut (which passed the only\nother statewide measure in 2011) and more than a dozen cit-\nies with such legislation (Ness, 2014). Movements toward a\nhigher minimum wage have also received widespread atten-\ntion in recent years. In 2014, President Obama supported a\nstates increased their minimum wages, as did 10 city and\ncounty governments. Seattle voted to raise its citywide mini-\nYork, Los Angeles, and Chicago have all backed a US$13\nwage floor. These actions are relevant to CNAs, whose\nMany forms of worker organizinghave played a critical\nrole in advancing these demands for wages and benefits, and\nsuch organizing might be the most promising route to imple-\nmenting the kinds of changes in worktime policy outlined\nhere. Unions--such as Service Employees International\nUnion (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers--continue to\norganize CNAs despite the obstacles created by employer\nresistance to collective bargaining and a climate of relatively\nhigh unemployment in the United States. Unionized CNAs\nearn higher wages than their nonunionized counterparts\n(Wicks-Lim, 2009). The faster-than-average job growth for\nnursing assistants and the consequent shortage of skilled\nlong-term care workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014;\nStone & Harahan, 2010) would seem to put CNAs in a stron-\nger position to collectively organize; however, CNAs who\nare members of a union remain a minority--only about 14%\nof nursing assistants, nationally (Wicks-Lim, 2009).\nNevertheless, collective actions by low-wage workers\nboth inside and outside of union models have intensified and\ngained national attention in recent years--most famously\namong fast-food workers. Home health care workers (who\nhave roles similar to that of CNAs, but do not have the for-\nmal training) have begun to join fast-food workers in these\nwidespread strikes and the only-slightly-less-marginal CNAs\nmight find inspiration in these kinds of actions. The case for\nbetter working conditions for CNAs is bolstered by evidence\nthat nursing home resident well-being is greater where CNA\njob satisfaction is higher (Bishop et al., 2008).\nAn alternative form of worker organization--worker-\nowned businesses--also offers promise in terms of improv-\ning working conditions for workers such as CNAs by creating\nstructures that give workers control over the institutions that\naffect their lives (Majee & Hoyt, 2010). The intimate nature\nof their jobs leads care workers to feel a strong emotional\nattachment to the work they do (Dodson & Zincavage, 2007;\nRakovski & Price-Glynn, 2009). Rather than allowing\nemployers to exploit this attachment as a means to motivate\nan undercompensated workforce (Dodson & Zincavage,\n2007), worker-owned care businesses can transform this\nattachment into mutually-beneficial, patient-worker, busi-\nness models. Indeed, the worker-owner model for home\nhealth care has been found to benefit both workers and cli-\nents (Majee & Hoyt, 2010). Further evidence of the potential\nof worker-owned home health care cooperatives comes from\nBologna, Italy, where as much as 60% of home health care\nservices are provided by employee cooperatives (Logue,\n2006). A handful of successful examples exist in the United\nStates (including Bronx-Based Cooperative Home Care\nAssociates, Home Care Associates in Philadelphia, and\nPartners in Personal Assistance in Ann Arbor) and this prom-\nising model would benefit from additional research and\npolicy that supports funding and incubation.\nResearchers concerned with the consequences of workers'\ncontrol over their work time must acknowledge long-\nstanding patterns of occupational segregation that leave\nworkers in different social locations with very different\nneeds and also very different resources on which to draw to\nmeet those needs. The variation found in this study in the\nrelationships between specific elements of WTC in specific\noccupational contexts remind us that bringing an awareness\nof stratification patterns into our research designs can create\nopportunities to better understand workers' experiences.\nResearch has already begun to move in the direction of\ndisentangling subdimensions of WTC but could pay more\nattention to the ways these aspects have different valences\nacross occupational ecologies.\nPolicymakers, too, should account for the ways work-\nscheduling policies can have different implications for dif-\nferently situated workers. The contrasting pulls of overwork\nfelt by salaried workers and underemployment by hourly\nworkers suggest that maintaining such a system benefits\nemployers at the expense of all workers. Nevertheless,\nchoices between income and time are much more constrained\nfor some. Recently, a prominent worktime scholar (Schor,\n2010) argued for distributing time in the labor market more\nevenly--reducing labor market time for high-hours workers\nto increase income for low-hours workers. Demands to redis-\ntribute work time as a way of countering unemployment\nand sharing the available wages arose during the Great\nDepression, but such solutions have yet to be broached in the\ncurrent economic recovery (Negrey, 2012).\nThe negative impact that a lack of WTC can have on\nworkers' health and well-being should give us new impetus\nto consider alternative and innovative solutions to worktime\nregulation. Control, like other resources in society, is not dis-\ntributed evenly across social locations. For the least powerful\nworkers, challenges to health and well-being due to a lack of\nWTC promise to compound the disadvantages of their social\nlocation and reinforce, even bolster, existing inequalities.\nLimitations\nAlthough this study makes important contributions to the\nstudy of WTC and its consequences, it also has several\nlimitations. The cross-sectional, nonexperimental design\ndoes not allow for causal conclusions. Reverse causality is a\npossibility--that feeling control over work time is a result of\nfeeling less job-related stress. In their review, Hausser et al.\n(2010) find that longitudinal studies showed weaker support\nfor the job-demand control model predicting job-related\nwell-being than did cross-sectional studies. Incorporating an\noccupationally comparative model into future longitudinal\nand experimental research designs might be a fruitful avenue\nof research. A small sample size within each occupation also\nlimited statistical power in making comparisons. In addition,\nalthough some might consider using single-item measures as\na limitation, it also leads to useful insights regarding the\ndifferent aspects of WTC that would otherwise be concealed\nby combining these items into a scale.\nAnother limitation is that class and race are clearly entan-\ngled in this study, as they are in American society. Without a\nlow-wage, predominantly female, and predominantly White\ncomparison group, I can only speculate about the ways\nCNAs' racial composition contributes to the distinct\noutcomes for that group. Also, as noted, Massachusetts has a\nhigher proportion of Whites in the workplace than the\nnational average. The results might have been different if\nthe study was based in a state with a higher population of\npeople of color.\nEMTs and CNAs held second jobs at much higher rates\nthan physicians and nurses and worked significantly more\nhours in those jobs than the other two occupations. Stress\nlevels in these second jobs are likely tied to stress levels in\nprimary jobs, and lacking a measure of \"second job stress\" is\na limitation of this study. However, holding a second job was\nnot a significant predictor of worker stress in our models.\nThe self-report nature of the data could also be seen as\nproblematic. But, as I was interested in workers' perceptions\nof their own control and their own well-being, I felt that a\nself-report measure was appropriate, especially because the\nsame measure was used across occupations. However,\nthe self-report nature of these measures raises some ques-\ntions for future research. For example, to what degree do\nworker expectations of control differentially impact their\nself-assessment of stress? Also, how does attitude about\none's work affect that self-assessment? In other words, does\na sense of \"doing good\" buffer workers from feeling stressed\nabout a lack of control over their work time?\n"
