Our aim\nwas to contribute to the understanding of explicit and implicit attitude formation by studying the effects of elaboration\nand repetition as strategies for the formation of positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward novel brands in unfamiliar\ncategories. Across three studies, results indicated that explicit attitudes may form with both elaboration and repetition, but\nthe presence of competing products interfered with positive explicit attitude formation. Elaboration was not an effective\nstrategy for implicit attitude formation, but repetitive exposure of an object coupled with a positive valence was successful in\nthe formation of positive implicit attitudes. There may be dual routes to explicit and implicit attitude formation with different\nconsequences for managerial action. Limitations and managerial implications are discussed.\n",

In the absence of hav-\ning past experiences or products to compare with, consumers\nwould be more dependent on marketing materials in forming\nboth explicit and implicit attitudes toward such products.\nThe goal of the current series of studies was to investigate the\neffects of message elaboration and repetition on explicit and\nimplicit attitudes formation toward a novel product or brand.\nConsumers typically rely on prior experience with the cat-\negory of product when making judgments about an instance\nof novel product (Sujan, 1985). But if consumers lack famil-\niarity with the category of the product itself, the marketing\nmaterial may be the consumer's only source of information,\nand hence, have a strong influence in shaping the formation\nof attitudes. Existing literature address aspects of this pro-\nto our knowledge, studies have rarely examined the pattern\nof explicit and implicit attitude formation when consumers\nencounter a novel object in a novel category. Such under-\nstanding is necessary because the two types of attitudes\nappear to effect different consumer outcomes. Whereas\nexplicit attitudes are associated with planned purchase\nbehavior, implicit attitudes are associated with purchase\nbehavior where cognitive resources are limited (Friese,\nW\u00e4nke, & Plessner, 2006). If the pattern of explicit and\nimplicit attitude formation depends on the presentation of\nnovel objects, this implies different managerial implications,\ndepending on which kind of attitude formation is sought.\nOur focus was on implicit attitude formation, and we\nattempt to outline the conditions under which implicit atti-\ntudes form, and provide reasons for why explicit attitudes\nmay or may not form concurrently with implicit attitudes.\nThe particular implicit attitude measurement model adopted\nfor this study was the Implicit Association Test (IAT;\nGreenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998; see De Houwer,\nTeige-Mocigemba, Spruyt, & Moors, 2009, for a discussion\nof the nature of the \"implicitness\" of such measures). The\ngeneral pattern of findings using the IAT is that implicit atti-\ntudes appear to be a function of the frequency with which\nconcepts are paired in one's environment, and hence, a func-\ntion of the frequency with which concepts are perceived\n(consciously or not) by the individual (Greenwald & Banaji,\nconsumer behavior domain in that the frequency of use of a\n1Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA\n2Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea\nCorresponding Author:\nDo-Yeong Kim, Graduate Department of Global Management, School\nof Business Administration, Ajou University, San 5, Wonchun-Dong,\nEmail: kimd@ajou.ac.kr\nSeeing Something New: Effects of\nElaboration and Repetition on the\nPattern of Explicit and Implicit Attitude\nFormation\nDaisung Jang1 and Do-Yeong Kim2\n Keywords\nattitude formation, consumer attitude, social cognition\n2 SAGE Open\nproduct reflects implicit attitude strength (Perkins, Forehand,\nHowever, the studies along this line of research offer lim-\nited implications for understanding the pattern of explicit\nand implicit attitude formation toward novel products in\nnovel categories because there has been a lack of focus on\nstrategies, other than frequency of presentation, in inducing\nimplicit attitudes for novel objects. Specifically, despite the\ndefinition of implicit attitudes hinging on repeated associa-\ntions between concepts, Gregg et al. (2006) and Perkins et al.\n(2008) were able to induce implicit attitudes with exposure\nto a single instance of a message, by invoking salient inter-\ngroup processes (i.e., social identity processes, cf. Tajfel,\n1982). A possibility based on these findings is that a single\nbut salient marketing message about a novel object could be\na sufficient condition for implicit attitude formation.\nAlthough this proposition seems plausible, the presentation\nof a novel object in an unfamiliar category, by definition, has\nno meaningful relationship to any of the consumer's existing\nset of knowledge, and may not serve as a cue to trigger salient\nintergroup processes. More generally, without access to a\nconsumer's existing set of associations, a novel object in an\nunfamiliar category is unlikely to evoke stored associations,\nor be a trigger for interpersonal or intrapsychic processes\nlikely to increase the salience of the object.\nThus, one of the few plausible ways in which a single\nexposure of a novel object in an unfamiliar category could\ninfluence implicit attitudes would be the salience of the mar-\nketing message itself. The literature suggests that the level of\nelaboration may play a role in attitude formation toward\nnovel objects because when a piece of information does not\nrelate to one's existing set of knowledge, an increase in the\namount of provided information facilitates the degree of\ninfluence of that information (Schwarz, 2004). If we extend\nthe logic to consider a consumer's response to multiple novel\nobjects in a novel category, it is possible that greater elabora-\ntion of one object relative to another object (i.e., a brand\nabout which the perceiver has just received information\nabout vs. an unknown brand) may influence attitude forma-\ntion, given that consumers base their purchase decisions on\nthe relative familiarity of an object (Hoyer & Brown, 1990;\nWe investigated the above propositions in Study 1. Red\nwine was selected as a category that would be relatively\nunfamiliar to the South Korean participants recruited because\nit is not traditionally consumed, and consumers have little\ninformation about specific products or the category in gen-\neral. That is, the participants would be relatively naive in\ntheir conceptualization of wine, which implies participants\nwould rely solely on the materials presented to them in atti-\ntude formation. Experiments 1a and 1b tested whether atti-\ntudes toward a brand could be formed after a single exposure\nto marketing material, whereas Experiment 1c sought to\ndetermine if greater familiarity toward one brand relative to\nanother would influence implicit and explicit attitude\nformation.\nAn alternate mode of attitude formation may lie in\nrepeated exposure to concepts. Investigations by Olson and\nthat repeated exposure to pairs of concepts could result in\neither the formation or increase in the salience of implicit\nattitudes. However, they do not speak directly to attitude for-\nmation, as both studies investigated objects that had existing\nassociations with either positive or negative valences, and\nneither were systematic about measuring explicit and implicit\nattitudes at pretest and posttest. To overcome these limita-\ntions, we directly test if implicit attitudes could be formed\nthrough repeated exposure to a neutral object (novel product\nin an unfamiliar category), and measure both explicit and\nimplicit attitudes at pretest and posttest to detect the pattern\nof explicit and implicit attitude formation.\nWe investigated the role of repeated exposure in attitude\nformation in Studies 2 and 3. In Study 2, to directly evaluate\nthe effects of frequency, we simulated the effect of repeated\nexposure to marketing material through evaluative condi-\ntioning. In Study 3, we attempted to determine whether such\nrepetition effects would be reflected in relation to existing\nbrands, by assessing the attitudes toward a national brand\nversus a comparable foreign brand.\nExperiments in Study 1 address the following question: Does\nsalience of the material influence implicit attitude forma-\ntion? Three experiments were conducted. Experiment 1a\ntestedtheeffectofsimulatedmarketingmaterials,Experiment\n1b tested the effect of visiting an authentic-looking website,\nand Experiment 1c tested the effect of having an unknown,\ncompetitive product in the evaluation set. The study had one\ndesideratum--that marketing messages include no refer-\nences to already valenced attitude objects, to prevent indirect\nvalence transfer, as observed by Perkins et al. (2008).\nMethod\nParticipants. Participants were recruited from a private South\nKorean university. One hundred and thirty-nine students (59\nSD = 1.97) in Experiment 1c. Overall, participants generally\nreported minimal familiarity with wine. We attempted to\neliminate the effects of participants' preconceptions of wine\nby measuring prior familiarity of wine, wine purchase, or\nsupposed familiarity with the brand of the wine at pretest. The\nexclusion of participants who indicated any familiarity or\nprior purchase of wine did not affect the pattern of results, so\nall participants were retained in the analyses.\nJang and Kim 3\nOverview of procedure. All studies followed a pretest/posttest\ndesign with explicit and implicit measures collected at both\nphases. In Experiment 1a, elaboration of marketing material\nabout a fictional brand of wine (Cultura) was manipulated.\nAfter completing the pretest measures, participants were\nassigned to one of four conditions: control, low, medium, and\nhigh elaboration groups. In the low elaboration group (n =\n33), participants were given a brochure (double-sided A4\nsize) containing information about the region in which the\ngrapes were cultivated, a short description about the wine,\nand color photos of the wine bottle. In the medium elabora-\ntion group (n = 36), participants were given the same bro-\nchure accompanied by a bottle of wine with a fake, but\nhigh-quality label. In the high elaboration group (n = 34),\nparticipants were provided with an enhanced brochure, in\naddition to being shown the bottle of wine. Inspection time\nacross these conditions was 5 min. The price of the wine was\nomitted across conditions as it could be interpreted as a sig-\nnal of quality (Lecocq & Visser, 2006). Participants in the\ncontrol group (n = 36) were instructed to take a 5-min break.\nThe inclusion of this no-activity control group assured\nagainst practice effects known to occur with pretest/posttest\nuse of an IAT-type measure.\nThe objective of experiment 1b was to replicate experi-\nment 1a, while avoiding confounds present in the manipula-\ntion materials. Most importantly, the authenticity was\nenhanced by having participants search for the brand on\ngoogle.com and then visiting the supposed corporate website\n(when in fact, the participants were actually directed to a\nwebsite controlled by the experimenters), providing authen-\nticity to the marketing message. Another potential confound\nwas that different modalities of marketing material (i.e., bro-\nchures and wine bottles) could result in different consumer\noutcomes (Kardes, Cronley, & Kim, 2006), so no tactile\nmaterials were provided to the participants in Experiment 1b.\nFinally, instead of presenting different kinds of information\nacross conditions, quantity of information was varied by\nhaving participants view a website that was complete versus\nthose still under construction.\nParticipants assigned to the low (n = 26) and high (n = 28)\nelaboration groups were told to perform a Google search on\na real, foreign brand of wine called Penfolds. The query\nresulted in a large number of search results for the Penfolds\nbrand, which was visible to participants, affirming its status.\nParticipants were directed to click on the first of those search\nresults. Lab computers were configured such that clicking on\nthe top search result would redirect the participants to a web-\nsite controlled by experimenters. In the low elaboration con-\ndition, participants were exposed to a website that was not\ncomplete, with placeholder notices (\"under construction\") in\nplace of content. In the high elaboration condition, partici-\npants were exposed to a website that was fully furnished with\ncontent in all sections of the website. Both versions of the\nwebsite were visually identical, with the difference in the\nlevel of content available to the participant. In keeping with\nthe notion that Penfolds is a foreign brand, the website was\npresented in English, but the participants were provided with\na Korean translation. In addition, to ensure that participants\nwould digest the information, they were given a short work-\nsheet of questions to complete while browsing the website.\nParticipants were permitted 5 min to inspect the website\nunder low elaboration and high elaboration conditions.\nParticipants in the no-activity control group (n = 28) were\ntold to take a 5-min break.\nThus the aim of Experiment 1c was to determine the effect\nof competing brands within an unfamiliar category. It is often\nthe case that when investigating a new category, consumers\nare aware that there is more than one brand from which to\nselect. Our question was whether greater elaboration of one\nbrand relative to another would result in explicit and implicit\nattitude formation. We minimally altered the protocols of\nExperiment 1b, such that participants expected to be exposed\nto two competing brands--Penfolds and Yalumba. Directly\nafter being exposed to the Penfolds brand, participants com-\npleted the posttest questionnaires. Twenty-three participants\nwere in the control group, 21 participants were in the low\nelaboration group, and 23 participants were in the high elab-\noration group.\nExplicit measures\nSemantic differential. To assess the cognitive component of\nthe participants' attitudes toward Cultura/Penfolds/Yalumba,\nthe participants completed a semantic differential scale\n(Experiment 1a, Cultura  = .85; Experiment 1b, Penfolds\nconsisting of the following eight pairs of words: Like/Dis-\nlike, Satisfied/Dissatisfied, Mild/Cold, Joy/Sad, Luxury/\nLowbrow, Graceful/Abject, Sophisticated/Trite, Happy/\nUnhappy. The participants listed their answers on a 1 to 7\nscale, with higher scores indicating positive cognitive evalua-\ntions. Such semantic differentials have been used in previous\nresearch, using the IAT (e.g., Brunel, Tietje, & Greenwald,\nadjective pairs to reflect evaluative dimensions relevant to\nconsumer choice in Korea.\nThermometer scale. To assess the affective component of\ntheir attitudes toward Cultura/Penfolds/Yalumba, the par-\nticipants completed a thermometer scale consisting of one\nitem ( = n/a; single-item scale), in which they indicated a\ntemperature between -50 to 50 degrees that reflected their\naffects toward the brand, with higher scores indicating more\npositive affective evaluations. We used this scale because it\nmade more intuitive sense to mark cold and hot tempera-\ntures, given the use of the metric system in Korea. For ease\nof interpretation and compatibility with previous uses of the\nthermometer scale, we transformed this scale to range from\nFor Experiment 1c, we assessed the extent to which par-\nticipants favored Penfolds over Yalumba. Therefore, the\n4 SAGE Open\ndifference scores between the two semantic (Penfolds  =\n.90; Yalumba  = .89) and thermometer ( = n/a; single-item\nscale) scales were used as the dependent variables. Higher\nscores indicated a more favorable evaluation of the Penfolds\nbrand.\nImplicit measures\nIAT.The IAT methodology (Greenwald et al., 1998)\nwas adopted to assess implicit attitudes toward Cultura\n( = .79). Because there was only one object to judge, there\nwere two target categories: a Cultura category and a blank\ncategory. Conceptually, if there is no contrasting concept, a\nsingle-category IAT is the logical operationalization of the\nKim, 2004). In essence, the blank category can be regarded\nas a neutral baseline against which the Cultura concept can\nbe assessed. The evaluative categories were \"Good\" (with\nwarm, refined, birthday, happy, friendly, joy, and freedom\nas stimuli) and \"Bad\" (with failure, ruin, tire, pain, dan-\nger, shortage, sadness, and poverty as stimuli). The newer\nd-score scoring method (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003)\nwas used in the final analysis. For Experiment 1b, a similar\nmeasure was used, but with the Cultura category and stimu-\nlus renamed to Penfolds ( = .89). For Experiment 1c, the\nblank category was replaced with a Yalumba category ( =\n.88). In all cases, the IAT scores were calculated such that\npositive scores were reflective of greater preference toward\nCultura/Penfolds (i.e., the positively exposed brand).\nResults\nA series of ANCOVA procedures were conducted with the\nposttest measures as the dependent variable, pretest mea-\nsures as covariate, and a condition main effect (compar-\ning the different levels of treatment) as a between-subjects\nvariable. The critical result was the main effect of the\ncondition main effect. Table 1 shows the pretest and post-\ntest means of the measures in each of the experiments in\nCognitive attitude formation.Overall, the pattern of results\nsuggested that favorable cognitive attitudes toward a brand\ncould form toward a novel brand with only a single exposure,\nbut only if one novel object was presented. In Experiment 1a,\nthe analysis revealed a significant effect of condition, F(3,\np < .001, d = .87) being significantly higher than controls\n(adj. M = 4.49, SE = .11). However, there were no differences\nbetween the manipulation conditions.\nIn Experiment 1b, there was again a significant effect of\nwere significantly more positive than in the controls (adj.\nM = 4.63, SE = .11), there was no difference between the low\nand high conditions.\nThe introduction of an unknown competing brand resulted\nin a different pattern of data.

Analyses for\nExperiment 1c revealed a nonsignificant effect of condition,\nImplicit attitude formation. The pattern of results suggests that\na single exposure to a novel object did not result in implicit\nattitude formation, even after increasing the elaboration of\nthe material. Across Experiments 1a, 1b, and 1c, none of the\ncondition main effects were significant--Experiment 1a:\nDiscussion\nWith only one encounter, marketing materials may bear only\nlimited implications for explicit and implicit attitudes toward\nnovel consumer objects. In general, formation of explicit\nattitudes could be achieved by providing marketing mes-\nsages about a single product, but the presence of a competing\nobject appeared to neutralize the effectiveness of elabora-\ntion. In contrast to the partially successful formation of\nexplicit attitudes, implicit attitudes could not be formed with\na single exposure to marketing message, despite attempts at\nincreasing elaboration. These results discount the role of\nsalience in implicit attitude formation and point to presence\nof repeated associations between concepts being a more\nplausible way to form implicit attitudes toward novel objects.\nThe aim of this study was to directly test if an evaluative\npriming procedure would be successful in inducing implicit\nattitudes about a novel object. A crucial consideration is that\nrepeated exposure to an unknown brand may not, in and of\nitself, form the basis for implicit attitude formation. This is\nbecause the presentation of an unvalenced concept unaccom-\npanied by other stimuli is a context in which associative pro-\ncesses should not be activated, and thus, should not lead to\nthe formation of an implicit attitude. A strong test of this\nhypothesis would be that implicit attitudes would not form\ntoward a brand that was exposed with the same frequency\nbut without simultaneous presentation with positive valences.\nUnlike previous studies, we do not make comparisons\nbetween two objects conditioned with either positive or neg-\noperationalization is unrepresentative of the idea of novel\nobjects in an unfamiliar category.\nThe frequency of exposure to an attitude object with posi-\ntively valenced concepts may also result in the formation of\nexplicit attitudes. Previous studies show repetitions of adver-\ntisements enhance explicit attitudes toward the novel object\n(Haugtvedt, Schumann, Schneier, & Warren, 1994; Schwarz,\n2004), so compared with the presentation of a brand without\nvalences, the presentation of a brand with positive valences\nshould receive favorable evaluations by comparison.\nMethod\nParticipants and overview of procedure. Fifty-five students (14\nKorean university were recruited. After completing explicit\nand implicit measures of their attitudes toward two brands\nwith which they were unfamiliar, the study participants were\nrandomly assigned to either the Penfolds or the Yalumba\nexposure groups. After the manipulation, the participants\ncompleted identical explicit and implicit measures at pretest.\nAs in Study 1, participants generally reported low familiarity\nwith wine or either of the brands. Moreover, as in Study 1,\nexcluding participants who had familiarity with wine, had\npurchased wine, or expressed that they had previous knowl-\nedge of the test brand had no impact on the pattern of data,\nand thus were retained in the study.\nManipulation. In both conditions, participants were instructed\nto memorize the pairs of words shown on the screen, as a\nmemory test would ostensibly be administered at the end of\nthe presentation. Participants were exposed to 100 pairings\nof either Penfolds or Yalumba with one of five positive eval-\nuative stimuli not presented in the IAT task (good, happy,\njoy, hope, success--although some of these stimuli overlap\nthe stimuli for the IAT, they were close synonyms in Korean;\nno direct English equivalent translations); one drawback of a\nprevious study of implicit attitude formation toward novel\n6 SAGE Open\nobjects was that the concepts used in evaluative conditioning\nand implicit attitude measurement were identical, thus con-\nfounding attitude formation with practice effects (Mitchell,\n2004). The word pairings were presented such that the brand\nname would be presented on either the left or right half of the\nscreen, and an evaluative word would appear on the other\nhalf of the screen. The pairings were presented for 1 s each\non a computer screen, after which the word pairing was\nobscured by an opaque white rectangle. The participant then\npressed a key on the keyboard to advance to the next pairing.\nPresentation of the concept word and the positive evaluative\nword was fully counterbalanced across different sides of the\nscreen. This procedure continued until the participant had\nbeen exposed to all 100 brand-evaluative word pairings. This\nprocedure closely mimics the procedure used by Karpinski\nand Hilton (2001), with the difference being that the current\nstudy used pairs of novel objects with either positive or neu-\ntral valences, whereas Karpinski and Hilton (2001) paired\nknown concepts with either positive or negative valences. In\naddition, to ensure that mere exposure to the brand did not\ninfluence the formation of the attitude, in the Penfolds expo-\nsure group, the concept Yalumba was presented paired with a\nwhite blank rectangle rather than an evaluative word for 100\nexposures, and in the Yalumba exposure group, a white blank\nrectangle was presented with the word Penfolds for a total of\n100 exposures. Thus in each condition, participants were\nexposed to 200 presentations of brand names. A separate\nnonexposure control group was not included because the\nquestion we wished to ask was if repeated positive exposure\nto a brand would facilitate the formation of implicit attitudes,\ncompared with unvalenced repeated exposure.\nExplicit and implicit measures. Measures were identical to those\nin Experiment 1c. The difference score between the Penfolds\n( = .81) and Yalumba ( = .63) semantic differential and ther-\nmometer ( = n/a; single-item scale) scales and IAT ( = .89)\nwere adopted as the dependent variables, with higher scores\nrepresenting greater favorability toward the Penfolds brand.\nResults\nExplicit and implicit attitudes toward Penfolds versus\nYalumba.\nANCOVA was conducted with the posttest\nmeasures as the dependent variable and pretest measures as\ncovariates, with a between-subjects factor of condition (Pen-\nfolds vs. Yalumba exposure). Table 2 shows the pretest and\nposttest means of the measures.\nResults showed that cognitive attitudes form for brands\npresented with positively valenced concepts. Analysis on the\nsemantic differential showed that the effect of condition was\nthereby indicating that participants in the Penfolds (adj.\nM =.92, SE = .27) and Yalumba exposure groups (adj.\nM = -1.13, SE = .28) reported higher cognitive evaluations\nof the brand to which they were exposed.\nAffective attitudes showed a similar pattern. The effect of\n2 = .34, which indicates that participants in the Penfolds\nhad been exposed.\nImplicit preference for the exposed brand was also\nobserved. The effect of condition was shown to be signifi-\nindicating a preference toward the positively exposed brand\nin the Penfolds (M = .22, SE = .07) and Yalumba exposure\nDiscussion\nFormation of explicit attitudes was facilitated by repeated\nexposure to positively valenced concepts, with cognitive and\naffective evaluations being favorable following exposure to\na simulation of repeated marketing messages. But merely\nbeing seen (even repeatedly) is an insufficient condition for\npositive implicit attitude formation. Viewed in the context of\nthe previous findings, the data indicate that favorable implicit\nattitudes are dependent on the frequency of positively\nvalenced exposures, rather than on the salience of the\nmaterial.\nAlthough Study 2 showed that the frequency of exposure\ncoupled with positive valences could result in the formation\nof implicit attitudes, it remains to be seen if the effects of\nTable 2.

IAT = Implicit Association Test.\nJang and Kim 7\nfrequency on implicit attitude formation can be inferred\nfrom implicit attitudes toward existing brands. One case in\nwhich a clear difference in the frequency of exposure might\nbe expected is between a dominant national brand and a less\ndominant foreign brand. Specifically, we compared explicit\nand implicit attitudes toward comparable brands that are\nwell-known among Koreans--namely Samsung (a Korean\nbrand) and Sony (a Japanese brand). Both brands represent\nlarge, multinational firms that compete in similar categories\nand have a significant consumer presence. The data were\ncollected in the Korean city of Suwon, which also serves as\nthe headquarters for their electronics division, and it also\nsponsors the local national-league soccer team. In addition,\nSamsung is the largest company in Korea, accounting for a\nconsiderable portion of the goods sold and economic activ-\nity in the country. We believed Koreans to have a higher\nfrequency of positive exposure toward Samsung as com-\npared with Sony, and anticipated that Koreans would have\nmore favorable implicit attitudes toward Samsung than\ntoward Sony.\nMethods\nParticipants and overview of procedure. One hundred and thirty\nrecruited from a private university in South Korea and com-\npleted explicit and implicit measures of Samsung and Sony\nas well as demographic questions.\nExplicit and implicit measures. The explicit and implicit mea-\nsures mirrored those in Study 2, except that Samsung and\nSony were the target concepts in both the semantic differen-\ntial (Samsung,  = .87; Sony,  = .86), thermometer scales (\n= n/a; single-item scale), and IAT ( = .91). In all cases, posi-\ntive scores represented greater preference toward Samsung.\nIf greater positive exposure to Samsung does lead to positive\nattitudes, we would expect the means of the measures to be\npositive and significantly different from zero.\nResults and Discussion\nWe analyzed Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward\nSamsung versus Sony by subjecting the difference scores on\neach of the measures to a one-sample t test. Cognitive atti-\ntudes showed a preference for Samsung, M = .33, SD = .88,\nOverall, the pattern of data is consistent with that of Study\n2, indirectly suggesting that repeated exposure to paired con-\ncepts could account for the formation of implicit attitudes.\nThe difference, however, is that the current study used famil-\niar brands. One interesting point is that participants would\nhave encountered the marketing materials showing each of\nthe brands in a positive manner. If merely being associated\nwith positive valences is responsible for implicit attitudes,\nthen Koreans should be indifferent in their comparative\nimplicit attitudes toward Samsung and Sony. The clear pref-\nerence for one brand indicates the importance of relative\nexposure frequency.\nOne plausible alternative explanation was that ethnocen-\ntrism may have been a factor in the implicit attitudes observed\nWatson & Wright, 2000). However, IAT-type measures are\nrelatively sensitive to the stimuli presented to the participant\nsuch that, even with the same target concept, different\nimplicit attitudes may arise as a function of differently\nvalenced stimuli used in the measure (Bluemke & Friese,\nIAT we used did not contain references to national identities,\nthe associative link between one's country and brand may\nnot have been reflected in the responses. Although we\nacknowledge that all sources of confounding effects cannot\nbe ruled out, it is difficult to eliminate such effects when\ndealing with data on objects that exist in the wild.\nGeneral Discussion\nSummary of Results\nAcross the experiments in Study 1, single exposures to mar-\nketing material were shown to be effective in forming explicit\nbut not implicit attitudes toward novel attitude objects (new\nbrands). Furthermore, we detected some differences in\nresponses in the pattern of explicit responses. Although cog-\nnitive attitudes could be induced, the degree of elaboration\ndid not result in differentiated attitudes (Experiments 1a and\n1b), and the presence of competing brands (Experiment 1c)\nresulted in no preference toward a novel brand about which\nmarketing efforts were expended. By way of contrast, we\nobserved that authenticity appeared to induce affective evalu-\nations (Experiment 1b), but it was also insensitive to the\namount of elaboration. The presence of a competing brand\nappeared to erase the effects of authenticity, however. With\nrespect to implicit measures, single exposures to novel objects\ndid not appear to lead to the formation of implicit attitudes.\nStudies 2 and 3 provided evidence that repeated presenta-\ntion of a brand with positive valences could result in positive\nimplicit attitudes. Both controlled repeated exposures in the\nlaboratory and theorized differences in frequency of expo-\nsure to one brand appeared to yield favorable implicit atti-\ntudes.These studies also demonstrated that repeated exposure\ncontributed to favorable cognitive and affective attitudes.\nThe Pattern of Explicit and Implicit Attitude\nFormation\nIn attempting to organize the current findings in the light of\nprevious research, we offer the following analysis. In our\nstudies, where the salience of the judgment was low, implicit\nattitude formation was not influenced by single exposure to\n8 SAGE Open\nstimuli, but where sufficiently salient cognitive processes,\nsuch as intergroup classification are invoked, a single expo-\nsure may result in derivation of valence (cf. Gregg et al.,\nsubject to influential cognitive processes, consumers may\nrequire substantial exposure to novel brands paired with pos-\nitive stimuli before implicit attitudes form.\nWe speculate that this picture may not be so simple\nbecause explicit and implicit attitude formation may interact.\nBrands with a heightened public profile may be judged as\nhaving been socially validated, thereby indicating that the\nbrand (even if novel) offers goods that people prefer to con-\nsume (Baker, Hutchinson, & Nedungasi, 1986), heightening\nthe salience of such information and implying an associative\nlink between the product and an ingroup. Furthermore, a\nconscious decision to alter one's engagement to include more\nexposure to certain associations (e.g., routinely choosing to\nwalk past an attractive billboard) could alter the availability\nof the associations themselves. In short, although frequency\nof exposure may directly lead to implicit and explicit attitude\nformation, a variety of mediating and moderating effects\ncould exist.\nTheoretical and Managerial Implications\nWe contribute to the literature on implicit attitudes by dem-\nonstrating the pattern of explicit and implicit attitude forma-\ntion. It has long been suggested that implicit attitudes are the\nproduct of repeated associations between concepts\n(Greenwald et al.,, 1998). Subsequent investigations have\nshown that invoking salient intergroup processes can lead to\nthe formation of implicit attitudes (Gregg et al., 2006), but\nrelatively little attention has been given to how implicit and\nexplicit attitudes arise toward a relatively unfamiliar object.\nUsing the consumer behavior context allowed us to study\nboth explicit and implicit attitude formation, and to demon-\nstrate divergence in the formation of explicit and implicit\nattitude formation. The key to understanding the formation\nof attitudes is that implicit attitude formation is dependent\nnot on salience but on the relative frequency of the presenta-\ntion of an object and a valenced concept, whereas explicit\nattitudes can arise as a function of frequency and salience.\nThis pattern is strongly consistent with multiple routes to\nattitude formation, one through elaboration and another\nthrough repetition, with different consequences for explicit\nand implicit attitude formation.\nBased on our findings, we suggest an important caveat to\nmarketing actions. Managers who are interested in creating\nfavorable implicit attitudes, which appears to be associated\nwith nondeliberative purchase behavior (Perkins et al.,\n2008), could adopt a marketing strategy focused on repeated\nexposure of the product to the consumer. Focusing on elabo-\nrate presentations to form implicit associations may not be as\neffective without invoking salient intergroup processes.\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research\nA few points in these studies merit further consideration. We\nrecruited exclusively from a private South Korean university,\nwhich is a relatively homogeneous population. We do not\nknow how the results would be affected by recruiting more\ndiverse populations and explicitly accounting for group dif-\nferences. Furthermore, we did not exhaustively vary the\nsalience of materials, nor did we define the boundary condi-\ntions under which explicit and implicit attitudes form. In par-\nticular, although we decided on 100 exposures of a brand\ncoupled to a positive valence in Study 2, this number was\narbitrary. Previous investigations have met with success in\ninducing implicit attitudes after associating concepts in a\nrange from 20 to 200 exposures (Baccus, Baldwin, & Packer,\nPerkins et al., 2008). Future research should seek to deter-\nmine the point at which implicit attitudes form. In addition,\nwe note that the vast majority of participants in Study 1 and\n2 preferred alcoholic beverages other than wine. Therefore,\nthe participants in those studies may differ qualitatively from\ntypical consumers who are consistent in their preferred brand\nof product and purchase behavior (Cobb & Hoyer, 1986).\n"
