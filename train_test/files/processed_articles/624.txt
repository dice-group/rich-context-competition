Infection in immunocompromised hosts\nresults often in severe local disease and occasionally in dis-\nseminated disease. Infection during pregnancy, particularly\naround the time of delivery (4\u00ad7), places the infant at risk\nfor neonatal herpes, a frequently devastating disease with\nhigh mortality and a high rate of permanent neurologic\nimpairment among survivors (8, 9). This virus is spread\nthrough intimate contact and is often unrecognized; infec-\ntion is commonly asymptomatic, and viral shedding may\noccur intermittently for years in the absence of symptoms\nSince the early 1970s, public awareness and concern\nabout genital herpes have increased considerably, in part\nbecause of the impression that the burden of HSV-2-related\ndisease has been rising (12). From the late 1960s to the mid-\n1990s, the annual number of outpatient visits for genital her-\npes in the United States increased steadily from 20,000 to\nprevalence of antibody to HSV-2 in US residents aged 12\nyears or older had increased from 16.4 percent in the late\nincrease in prevalence was greatest in White teenagers and\nyoung adults.\nThere are no nationally representative data on the inci-\ndence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. Direct mea-\nsurement of incidence is difficult because infection is most\noften asymptomatic and unrecognized. Furthermore, geni-\ntal herpes infection is not reportable in most states.\nDetermining seroconversion rates in a large, representa-\ntive cohort would be possible but costly. A more practical\napproach is to estimate the past incidence of infection\nfrom existing seroprevalence data by means of \"catalytic\nmodeling\" (16\u00ad20). We applied a variation of this method-\nology to data from the Second National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) and the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) to estimate the incidence of HSV-2 infec-\ntion in the general population as well as the risk of infec-\ntion during pregnancy.\nData sources\nNHANES II and NHANES III were conducted from 1976\nsurveyed multistage, stratified, clustered samples of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population to provide nation-\nally representative prevalence estimates for a variety of\nhealth measures and conditions. From among participants\naged 12 years or older from whom serum samples were\nNHANES II and 13,094 from NHANES III) was tested for\nthe presence of antibody to herpes simplex virus type 1\n(HSV-1) and HSV-2 (15). Sera from both surveys were\ntested in a single laboratory by using an antigen specific to\nculture-proven, recurrent genital herpes, the sensitivity and\nspecificity of this assay are more than 98 and 99 percent,\nrespectively (24). The prevalence of HSV-2 antibody in\nthese samples has been described previously (14, 15).\nGeneral description of the incidence models\nMathematical details of the models are given in the\nAppendix. What follows is a general description of how the\nmodels function.\nThe models estimated force of infection (25), which, for\nthe purposes of this paper, is considered synonymous with\nannual incidence in the susceptible (i.e., seronegative) pop-\nulation. Force of infection was always modeled indepen-\ndently for males and females and for three race/ethnic\ngroups: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and\nothers (including Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and\nPacific Islanders), referred to in this paper as Whites,\nBlacks, and others, respectively.\nThe past force of infection was modeled iteratively. At the\nbeginning of each iteration, the modeled force of infection\nfrom the previous iteration was used to calculate what the\nprevalence of antibody to HSV-2 would be at the time of\nNHANES II and NHANES III (the \"modeled prevalence\").\nThe modeled prevalence was then compared with the actual\nprevalence according to the two surveys, and the force of\ninfection was adjusted by using mathematical algorithms.\nThis process was repeated until further adjustments resulted\nin no further improvement of the goodness of fit of the model\nas measured by the weighted deviance (a lower weighted\ndeviance indicates a better fit of the model).\nBecause the seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased from\nNHANES II to NHANES III, we assumed that incidence\nhad also increased. To model this increase, we assumed that\nthe force of infection had been constant up to a certain date,\n), and increased linearly thereafter. The values for\nand for the rate of increase after yr0\nwere determined\nempirically by determining which values resulted in the best\nfit of the modeled prevalence to the actual prevalence.\nThe age-specific force-of-infection curve was determined\nby regression analysis and was assumed to have a constant\nshape but to increase in height after yr0\n. The shape of this\ncurve was modeled by using three different methods, all of\nwhich gave similar results. Results presented in this paper\nare from the third model, which functioned much like a\nlocally weighted smoothing algorithm (26) in that the force\nof infection estimated at a certain age depended most on the\nprevalence of antibody to HSV-2 in survey participants who\nwere close to that age and little or not at all on the preva-\nlence in survey participants who were much older or much\nyounger. Because acquisition of HSV-2 by pregnant women\naround the time of birth increases the risk of neonatal HSV-\n2 infection (7), we estimated the force of infection in women\nduring pregnancy by assuming that it would not change as a\nresult of the pregnancy.\nStandardization\nIn most instances, force of infection was averaged across\nages, races, and genders after weighting with the 1990\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population and adjusting for\nthe estimated prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the year of\ninterest. The number of infections in 1985 was estimated by\nusing the intercensal estimate of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population in that year. To estimate the risk of\nseroconversion during pregnancy, force of infection in\nwomen was weighted by using the 1996 US natality data\nRESULTS\nThe three models produced similar estimates of age-,\nrace-, and gender-specific force of infection. In all instances,\ndifferences between the models were small relative to the\nestimated standard errors. Therefore, only those results from\nthe third model, which best fit the data, are presented here.\nAs with the others, this model fit the observed seropreva-\nlence well, especially that from the much larger NHANES\nIII survey (figure 1).\nChoice of time-dependent parameters\nThe estimated force of infection in any year varied with\nthe placement of yr0\n(figure 2). Nonetheless, the annual\n(figures 2 and 3). Therefore, this paper provides\nThe goodness of fit was relatively insensitive to the\nchoice of yr0\nwas not chosen solely on the\nbasis of statistical considerations. Rather, 1970 was chosen\nbecause published data showed that outpatient visits for\nThe model fit best when the annual rates of increase in\nforce of infection were set to 7, 2, and 9 percent of the pre-\n1970 baselines for Whites, Blacks, and others, respectively.\nWithin each race/ethnic group, the estimated rates of\nincrease, as a percentage of the baseline force of infection,\nwere equal for males and females.\nFIGURE 1.

In the\noverall population (aged 0 years or older), prevalence would\nand 1985, a relative increase of only 16 percent. Taking into\naccount the increasing seroprevalence, the incidence aver-\naged over the entire US population (i.e., the combined HSV-\n2-seronegative and -seropositive population) would have\na relative increase of 78 percent.\nThe age-specific force of infection in 1985 increased with\nin men and women aged 50 years or older (table 1). In all\nage groups, the force of infection was higher in Blacks than\nin Whites and higher in women than in men (figure 5). The\ndisparity between men and women was greatest for adoles-\ncents and young adults and least at the extremes of ages.\nIn 1985, the estimated number of new HSV-2 infections\nin the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population was\ntotal of 56 percent of the infections were estimated to have\noccurred in women and 44 percent in men. The largest pro-\nportion of infections occurred in those aged 20\u00ad29 years (38\nIn seronegative women, the risk of acquiring HSV-2 dur-\nall women giving birth in 1985 would have been seronega-\ntive for HSV-2 infection, the overall rate of HSV-2 infection\nduring pregnancy among all pregnant women would have\nDISCUSSION\nUsing a novel adaptation of a method to model infection\nrates from seroprevalence data, we estimated that the annual\nincidence of new HSV-2 infections in uninfected persons in\nper 1,000. Rates were higher in women than in men, higher\nin Blacks than in other race/ethnic groups, and, in general,\nhighest during the third decade of life.\nThe results of this model are consistent with other pub-\nlished estimates of incidence in European and North\nAmerican populations.

This finding may reflect the chronic nature of\nthe infection, in that a person infected at a young age who\ncontinues to shed the virus intermittently may infect others\nfor many years, even long after entering into a stable,\nmonogamous relationship. Thus, as birth cohorts age, the\npool of potentially infectious persons increases.\nThe high estimated incidence in the second and third\ndecades of life underscores the need to focus prevention\nefforts on both teenagers and young adults. Prevention mes-\nsages should include practicing healthful sexual behavior\nsuch as reducing the number of sexual partners. Promoting\nregular condom use is prudent, although few data support\ntheir effectiveness in preventing HSV-2 transmission (31,\n34). An effective vaccine against HSV-2 would provide an\ninvaluable prevention tool; developing an HSV-2 vaccine\nremains a field of active investigation despite disappointing\nresults thus far from published large-scale clinical trials (35,\nWe estimate that the rate of HSV-2 seroconversion per\nmillion US livebirths that year (37) and the estimated preva-\nlence of HSV-2-susceptible mothers (81 percent, data not\nshown) implies that 51,000 women would have become\nnewly infected with HSV-2 during their pregnancy in that\nyear. The prevalence of antibody to HSV-1 in HSV-2-\nnegative women would have been 39 percent (data, not\nshown, from NHANES III); thus, 20,000 would have repre-\nsented primary infections (i.e., HSV-2 infections in women\nwithout prior HSV infection), and 31,000 would have repre-\nsented nonprimary first infections (i.e., HSV-2 infections in\nwomen with prior HSV-1 infections). Children of these\nwomen would be at the highest risk for neonatal infection if\nthey were born during the time window between infection and\nHSV-2 seroconversion. If viral shedding during this window\nlasts 11.4 days in primary infection and 6.8 days in nonpri-\nmary first infection (38), and a constant risk of acquisition of\nneonates would be at risk each year as a result of new mater-\nnal HSV-2 infections. Approximately 37 percent of these (6,\n7), or 600, would become infected. Neonatal HSV-1 infection\nwould account for approximately half as many cases (6\u00ad8),\nbringing the total to 900 neonatal herpes infections annually\nas a result of primary and nonprimary first maternal infec-\ntions. This figure is consistent with another estimate of\nStates (39) and is higher than the rate of neonatal herpes\nobserved in King County, Washington, in the early 1980s\nThese rates of seroconversion per pregnancy are predicated\non similar forces of infection in pregnant and nonpregnant\nwomen. However, pregnant women may engage in sexual\nintercourse less often, may be less likely to change partners,\nand may have other characteristics that put them at lower risk\nFIGURE 3. Dependence of the age-specific force of infection (annual incidence in the susceptible (i.e., seronegative) population) of herpes\nsimplex virus type 2 on year 0 (yr\n), United States. Age-specific estimates of force of infection showed the least dependence on yr\nin the time\nperiod before yr\nand in the mid-1980s. The estimated force of infection in the late 1970s (not shown) and in the 1990s was much more depen-\ndent on the choice of yr\n.\nfor HSV-2 infection relative to nonpregnant women.\nConversely, other factors, such as decreased condom use or\nincreased partner changing, could increase this risk.\nPersons citing our results should understand their limita-\ntions. As with any model, the estimates and confidence inter-\nvals are conditional on the assumptions of the model. The\nconfidence intervals, for example, do not account for uncer-\ntainties in yr\nand the rate of increase over time or for uncer-\ntainties about the dynamics of this increase. Also, estimates of\nincidence in the oldest age groups should be considered less\nreliable than those in younger age groups, since the preva-\nlence in the former can be greatly affected by the incidence in\nyounger age groups. Thus, the prevalence in older age groups\nmay be subject to cohort effects not taken into account by the\nmodel. Furthermore, recent studies have documented that\nHSV-2 antibody levels in infected persons occasionally fall\nbelow the level of detection (41). Such seroreversion would\ncause our model to underestimate incidence.\nWe chose to model the increase in force of infection over\ntime as a simple linear function; our model included data\nfrom only two points in time and thus did not allow a more\ncomplex analysis. In reality, the increase was almost cer-\ntainly nonlinear and may have varied by age group. For this\nreason, and because the estimates of incidence in the late\n1980s depended greatly on the value chosen for yr\n, it would\nbe a mistake to extrapolate our results beyond the mid-\n1980s. Furthermore, since the incidence of gonorrhea,\nsyphilis, chlamydia, and primary human immunodeficiency\nvirus infection has probably decreased since the early 1990s\n(42\u00ad44), the upward trend in the incidence of HSV-2 infec-\ntion may also have reversed, although condom use, which\nmay account for much of the decline in the incidence of sex-\nually transmitted disease, is probably less effective in pre-\nventing HSV-2 transmission.\nto 1985 is considerably greater than the 16 percent relative\nincrease in prevalence we estimated to have occurred during\nthis time or the 34 percent relative increase in HSV-2 sero-\nprevalence between the time that NHANES II and\nNHANES III were conducted (15). Trends in the overall\nseroprevalence of infectious diseases generally lag behind\ntrends in incidence and may not reflect them accurately. For\nexample, if the incidence of HSV-2 infection increased sub-\noverall seroprevalence may currently be increasing even if\nincidence has stabilized or is decreasing slightly. Factors\nother than increasing incidence could have contributed to\nthe observed increase in HSV-2 seroprevalence, although\ntheir effects would likely have been very small: a decreasing\nage at acquisition or a decreasing mortality rate among\nFIGURE 4.

Although the mod-\nels did not take into account the effects of prior HSV-1\ninfection on HSV-2 acquisition, the prevalence of HSV-1\ndid not change between NHANES II and NHANES III;\ntherefore, any effects from HSV-1 would have been stable\nduring this time. The models assumed that force of infec-\ntion, , was both age and time dependent and could be\nexpressed as a product of two functions:\n(a,yr)  f(a)*g(yr)\nin which f(a) was the baseline age-specific force of infection\nat age a and g(yr) was the time-dependent multiplier in year\nyr. Estimated prevalence at any given age A in the year of a\nsurvey, yrs\n, P(A,yrs\n), was estimated as\nin which yr  yrs\n\u00ad A  a.\nA\nWe modeled f(a) separately with three different functions,\nwhich were chosen because they allowed force of infection\nto increase with age, then decrease, and finally to level off\nat older ages. In all models, several parameters were mod-\neled by regression analysis, including the age at which force\nof infection peaked, the force of infection at this peak, and\nthe force of infection in the oldest age groups.\nThe first model assumed that infection did not occur\nbefore age 10 years and that the baseline force of infection\nwas constant with respect to age in persons aged 50 years or\nolder. Baseline force of infection between ages 10 and 50\nyears was described by a polynomial,\nin which the s were coefficients that could be estimated in\na generalized linear model.\nThe second model assumed that\nin which \nmax\nwas the maximum baseline force of infection,\napeak\nwas the age at which this maximum occurred,  was a\nparameter inversely related to the width of the age range at\nhighest risk for infection, \nlate\nwas the baseline force of\ninfection at older ages, and STEP(apeak\n) was a Heavyside\nfunction equal to 0 before apeak\nand 1 thereafter. The four\nparameters were estimated by using nonlinear regression\nanalysis after specifying a large grid of starting values.\n \nlate\n*STEP1apeak\nmax\n \nlate\n*STEP1apeak\n \n*a  \nIn the third model, the mean baseline force of infection\nwas taken from K different submodels. In each submodel,\nf(a) was modeled as a step function with a finite number of\nsteps of width K years, followed by a final step of variable\nwidth. The first step began at age 0 years in the first sub-\nmodel, age 1 year in the second model, age 2 years in the\nthird model, and so on. In the nth step of the kth submodel,\nf(k,a)  \nk,n\n. After each of the K submodels was fit inde-\npendently to the data, f(a) was taken as the mean of the s\nthat included that particular age. K was varied from 6 to 20\nto find the minimum value that produced a smooth, age-\nspecific, force-of-infection curve.\nIn all models, g(yr) was assumed to be 1.0 prior to a cer-\ntain year, yr0\n, and to increase linearly thereafter by m per-\ncent of the baseline. yr0\nand m were determined empirically\nby varying yr0\nm that produced the best fit of the model for each yr0\n, and\nthen charting goodness of fit by yr0\n.\nThe modeling was performed with SAS software (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, North Carolina). The models were fit with\neither PROC GENMOD, a generalized linear modeling pro-\ncedure (first and third models), or PROC NLIN, a nonlinear\nmodeling procedure (second model), such that the estimated\nprevalence, P(A,yrs\n), matched the actual prevalence\nobserved in the two surveys. Goodness of fit was assessed\nby the weighted deviance (minus two times the logarithm of\nthe unconditional binomial likelihood ratio, weighted with\nthe normalized survey weight). Variance was estimated by\nusing Faye's variation of the balance repeat replicate\nmethod (45). Replicate weights were calculated with WES-\nVARPC software (WESTAT, Rockville, Maryland)."
