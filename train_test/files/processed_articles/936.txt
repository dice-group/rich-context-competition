    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPURPOSE Clinical studies have shown strong family influences on individual\nhealth, but the aggregate importance of family effects for population health is\nunknown. Our objective was to estimate, at a population level, the variance in\nindividual health status attributable to the family.\nMETHODS Secondary data were used from the Community Tracking Study, a strat-\nified random sample of the US population. Hierarchical linear modeling was used\nto estimate the individual and family components of health status. The setting was\n60 US communities, which account for approximately one half of the population.\nParticipants were US residents aged 18 years and older who shared a household\nwith family members in the study (N = 35,055). Main outcome measures were\nthe Short Form-12 (SF-12) self-reported physical and mental subscales.\nRESULTS Depending on the family configuration, 4.5% to 26.1% of the variance\nin individual health status was derived from the family. The proportion was high-\nest for older married persons. The family effect on health status was generally\nsimilar for physical and mental health. Including age, family income, and health\ninsurance status in the regression equations moderately reduced the family vari-\nance component.\nCONCLUSIONS At a population level, the family contribution to individual health\nstatus is measurable and substantial. The shared characteristics of income and\nhealth insurance account for only a modest portion of the effect. Health policy\nand interventions should place more emphasis on the family's role in health.\nINTRODUCTION\nSince its publication in 1977, George Engel's biopsychosocial model\nhas provided the conceptual underpinning for family medicine and\nother primary care disciplines.1 Writing in response to the biomedi-\ncal reductionism that had taken hold in mainstream medicine, Engel\nunderlined the importance of understanding health and illness in a multi-\nlevel context. The contribution of the biopsychosocial model has been to\nemphasize the embeddedness of each person in a continuum of hierarchies\nfrom the molecular to the societal and the role that each level of organiza-\ntion plays in determining health outcomes. Despite its theoretical power,\nhowever, the complexity of the biopsychosocial model has made it difficult\nto test empirically in a multilevel framework.\nNevertheless, a large body of research has addressed both family\nand community influences on health. Family-level influences on health\nderive from 3 main sources: genetics, a shared physical environment, and\na shared social environment.2 The last 2 factors become more important\nwhen family members inhabit the same household. The shared social\nenvironment includes functional relationships, such as caregiving; shared\nsocioeconomic circumstances, such as income and wealth, that are linked\nto barriers and opportunities for healthy living; and shared relationships,\nRobert L.

Family effects have been\nidentified for a wide variety of specific health out-\ncomes in both adults and children.3-10 In addition, a\ngrowing body of research during the last 2 decades\nhas demonstrated the effects on individual health out-\ncomes of community-level characteristics above and\nbeyond the effect of individual-level variables.11 Mor-\ntality, cardiovascular disease, violence, and other out-\ncomes are influenced by the economic, racial/ethnic,\nand social characteristics of neighborhoods and larger\nIn this study, we ask a different question: instead of\nconsidering specific disease outcomes for individuals,\nwe ask what the contextual effects of family and com-\nmunity on individual health status are at a population\nlevel. That is, across the US population, what propor-\ntion of general health status can be attributed to indi-\nvidual-, family-, and community-level determinants?\nOur intent is not to disentangle the contribution of\nspecific family and community environmental deter-\nminants, but to estimate the public health importance\nof the pathways taken as a whole. To our knowledge,\nthis study is the first to address this question. From a\npopulation or public health perspective, addressing this\nquestion is important to understand the determinants\nof illness and well-being and also to inform policy on\nhealth interventions.\nMETHODS\nData Source\nThis study is a secondary analysis of data from the\nCommunity Tracking Study (CTS), which was admin-\nistered to a stratified random sample of the US popula-\ncompleted an automated telephone survey; provision\nwas made to respondents without telephones by allow-\ning them to access the survey by cellular telephone.\nSurvey questions covered demographics, health insur-\nance, satisfaction with health care, use of health ser-\nvices, and health status. The response rate was 65%.\nBecause only adults completed the health status ques-\ntions, we limited our analysis to responses from persons\naged 18 years or older who shared a household with a\nMeasures\nThe health status questions administered included the\nShort Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12), a validated health\nstatus instrument with 2 subscales that cover mental\nand physical health status.14 The overall SF-12 score is\nscaled to have a mean of 50 with a standard deviation\nof 10. The physical component summary and mental\ncomponent summary scores were used for this study.\nThe physical component summary scale is constructed\nfrom SF-12 items covering physical limitations, role\nfunctioning, pain, and general health status. The men-\ntal component summary scale is constructed from items\non emotional problems, role functioning, and mood.\nAnalysis\nIn the CTS data set, 3 nested levels can be used to\ndefine families.15 The most restricted definition, the\nfamily insurance unit, includes an adult head of house-\nhold, a spouse (if present), dependent children up to\nthe age of 18 years who are living in the household, or\nchildren aged 18 to 22 years who are in school even if\nthey are living elsewhere. A census family, so named\nbecause it most closely corresponds to the definition\nused by the Census Bureau, includes all persons related\nto the head of household by blood or marriage. Finally,\na household includes all persons residing together.\nWe chose to use the census family definition for\n3 reasons. First, we wanted to include relatives who\nshared the residence with the family insurance unit.\nSecond, because there was no relationship code other\nthan \"spouse\" for cohabiting adults, the household defi-\nnition had the potential for misclassifying respondents\nas family members when they were actually housemates\nor boarders. Third, a family-level weight was available\nfor census families, but not households, thus allowing\nmore accurate population-level point estimates. We\ntested the sensitivity of our analysis to the choice of\nhousehold vs census family definition by rerunning the\nanalysis; the results were nearly identical.\nWe defined family configurations according to a\nCTS-constructed variable that categorized persons as\nbelonging to 1 of the following family classifications:\n\"single,\" \"single with kids,\" \"married, no kids,\" \"married\nwith kids,\" or \"non-nuclear family.\" The CTS further\nsubdivided households into single-family households\n(84% of households) and multiple-family households\n(16%), depending on whether there was more than 1\nfamily insurance unit in the household. Most (55%)\npersons in the additional family insurance units within\nhouseholds were either parents or grandchildren of the\nadult head of household. We chose to analyze multiple-\nfamily households separately because we hypothesized\nthat these varied living arrangements might materially\nalter the family environment.\nCommunities were defined as the 60 CTS sites--\ngenerally cities or aggregations of rural counties.\nAlthough we recognized this definition of community\nto be coarse, smaller geographic units were not avail-\nable in the public-use data set. We analyzed the indi-\nvidual-, family-, and community-level influences on\nself-rated health in a hierarchical linear model by using\nMLWin (Centre for Multilevel Modelling, London)\nsoftware. The hierarchical linear\nmodel accounts for the nested\ndata structure of individuals\nwithin families and families within\ncommunities.\nAll analyses applied person-\nlevel and family-level weights\nappropriate for making estimates\nrepresentative of the nonin-\nstitutionalized US population.\nBecause currently available hier-\narchical linear model software\ndoes not account for the design\neffect from clustered sampling,\nin which the actual variance is\ngreater than what it would be\nunder the assumption of simple\nrandom sampling,16 we recom-\nputed all standard errors before\ncalculating statistical significance.\nThe average design effect across\nthe CTS variables is 3.7 (ie, the\nactual variance is 3.7 times what\nit would be if the survey were a\nsimple random sample),15so we\nrechecked statistical significance\nafter multiplying the estimated\nsquare root of 3.7).\nThe Multilevel Model\nWe used the hierarchical linear\nmodel to examine health status in\nindividuals, families, and commu-\nnities. The individual-level model\n(level-1) is a fixed-effects linear\nmodel that predicts health status\nfor each individual as a function\nof the family-specific mean plus\nan error term. The family-level\nmodel (level-2) expresses the\nfamily-specific mean as a function of the mean of all\nfamilies plus an error term. By substituting the level-2\nequation into the level-1 equation, a combined multi-\nlevel model is generated, and a similar procedure gen-\nerates the community-level model (level-3).17 Within\nthe combined model, the variance at each level is cal-\nculated and can be used to compute an intraclass corre-\nlation coefficient, which, for this study, is equal to the\nfamily-level variance divided by the sum of the indi-\nvidual- and family-level variances. It is a measure of the\nproportion of the variability in health status between,\nrather than within, families.\nOur initial analysis used the combined level-3\nmodel to partition the variance of the SF-12 scores into\n3 components: individual (level-1), family (level-2),\nand community (level-3). Because the community level\naccounted for less than 1% of the total variance in\nhealth status scores in initial analyses, however, subse-\nquent analyses were limited to the individual (level-1)\nand family (level-2) components. The second analysis\nwas a series of multilevel regression equations that\nsequentially added age, family income, and then health\ninsurance status as predictors of SF-12 scores. For this\nset of equations, we were interested in assessing the\nproportion of family-level variance accounted for as\neach covariate was added to the model.\nTable 1.

The family (level-2) variance compo-\nnent ranged from 4.5% to 26.1% for the physical health\nscore. All the level-2 variance components for physi-\ncal health were statistically significant except for single\npersons with children in multiple-family households.\nAll the level-2 variance components for mental health\nwere statistically significant except for single persons\nwith children in single- or multiple-family households.\nThe level-2 variance component was generally similar\nfor mental and physical health status. Level-2 variances\nbetween single- and multiple-family households were\ncomparable. For this reason, only single-family house-\nholds were used in the regression models\nIn the multilevel regression models, age and income\nwere significant predictors of\nphysical health status in all\nfamily configurations (Table\n4). The effects were in the\nexpected direction; older age,\nlower income, and lack of\ninsurance were associated with\nworse physical health status.\nAge accounted for approxi-\nmately 30% of the level-2 vari-\nance for physical health status\nin the \"married, no kids\" group,\nreducing the family-level vari-\nto 16.2% of the total variance.\nThis magnitude of effect was\nnot observed in the \"married\nwith kids\" or the \"single with\nkids\" groups. Adding income to\nthe regression equations further\nreduced the level-2 variance\nall family configurations. After\nadjustment for age and income,\ninsurance status only slightly\nimproved the model.\nThe multilevel regression\nmodels for mental health status\ndisplayed a different pattern\n(Table 5). Income remained\na significant predictor in all\nfamily configurations, but age\naccounted for a very small\namount of level-2 variation and was significant only\nin the \"married, no kids\" families. Insurance status also\naccounted for little of the level-2 variance. Adjustment\nfor covariates had smaller effects on the level-2 variance\ncomponents for mental health than for physical health.\nDISCUSSION\nAt the population level, the contribution of the family\nunit to self-rated health status is substantial: the family-\nlevel variance accounts for 4.5% to 26.1% of the total\nvariance in individual physical and mental health status.\nThe family-level effect is most pronounced in married\npersons without children living in the household, prob-\nably because this group has the oldest average age of\nyears for \"married with kids\" and 33.2 years for \"single\nwith kids\") and thus contains persons who have had the\nlongest exposure to the shared family environment. This\nhypothesis is supported by the observation that including\nage as a covariate in equations predicting health status\nTable 2.

As\nexpected, income is an important feature of the family\nenvironment, exerting a measurable independent influ-\nence on the level-2 variance component, whereas insur-\nance status has smaller effects. With our limited number\nof predictors, 40% to 80% of the family-level variance\ncomponent remains unexplained in our models.\nNumerous studies have found family-level effects on\nhealth behaviors and illness. For example, spouses have\nTable 4.

For example,\nalthough the traditional gathering of family history has\nemphasized seeking genetic linkages, the strength of\nspousal concordance for many chronic diseases empha-\nsizes that shared environmental risks are also important;\nthus, a spouse's illness profile is useful for predicting risk.\nThe influence of genetic factors on concordant\nhealth status in this study was probably small for meth-\nodologic reasons. Spouses constituted the great major-\nity (87%) of adults whose health status was evaluated\nin the multilevel model. Most of the family-level effect,\ntherefore, derived from shared features of the family\nenvironment rather than from shared genetics. Of note\nis that the only nonsignificant level-2 variances were\nobserved in the subgroup with potentially the closest\ngenetic relationship--\"single with kids\"--whose intra-\nfamily correlations were derived mainly from single\nparents and their young-adult children. Many of these\nchildren could be assumed to be living outside the\nhousehold. The effect of a shared physical environment\nand more frequent interactions is thereby lost.\nFamily environmental factors take many forms,\nincluding mutually practiced health beliefs and behav-\niors, shared physical environments, common stresses\narising from family illnesses or deaths, instrumental\nsupport for obtaining health care, and interpersonal\nrelations that can be either beneficial or deleterious to\nhealth.18-20 The cumulative population-level effect of\nthe family environment on health will be determined by\nthe epidemiology of these family-level factors. One of\nthe most powerful determinants of family risk (which is\nevident in our analysis) is socioeconomic position,21-23\nwhich is generally shared by cohabiting family mem-\nbers and which strongly stratifies many nongenetic\nrisk factors. The effect of socioeconomic position is to\nstructure a set of life circumstances--quality of housing,\nneighborhood conditions, transportation, and access\nto medical care--each of which carries health implica-\ntions.24,25 Family systems research has documented that\ndifferent patterns of family dynamics predict different\nhealth outcomes.26 We do not know, however, how the\nepidemiology of family dynamics cumulates into popu-\nlation patterns of morbidity and mortality.\nWith the exceptions of income and health insurance\ncoverage, this study does not elaborate on the contri-\nbution of the various family environmental pathways;\nrather, it seeks to estimate the public health importance\nof the pathways taken as a whole. By understanding\nthe relative contributions to health of various levels of\nthe biopsychosocial continuum, proper weight can be\ngiven to these levels in designing policy and interven-\ntions. Although it does not automatically follow that\nthe solution to a family-level problem has to be applied\nat the family level (for instance, spouses concordant\nfor depression or obesity can individually be offered\nbehavioral counseling or medication), there may be\nfruitful ways to manage common risk for multiple\nmorbidities in multiple family members through family\ninterventions; the emphasis on individual clinical care\nhas impeded exploration of such interventions.\nThis study is subject to several important limitations.\nFirst is our definition of family. Defining family can be\nan elusive task, but a generally accepted definition is a\ngroup of intimates who have a history and a future as a\ngroup.27 Using data from a large epidemiologic study,\nwe instead had to rely on fixed-category self-reports of\nfamily configurations. Second, we lacked information on\nhow long respondents had been in their current family\nconfiguration. To the extent that there is a true family\neffect, attempting to measure that effect in persons who\nhave been in a family constellation for brief periods will\nunderestimate its importance. Third, because the CTS\nlimited its geographic identifiers in the public-use data set\nto the level of cities and counties, our definition of commu-\nnity was coarse, and we almost certainly underestimated\nthe effect of communities (neighborhoods) on health sta-\ntus. A robust array of studies has documented pervasive\nFourth, we examined only 1 category of health outcomes\n(self-reported health status) and can make no inferences\nabout the population-level contribution of family to other\nimportant outcomes, such as mortality, functional status,\nand specific morbidities. Fifth, assortative mating--the\ntendency for people who share traits to form couples--\nmay account for part of the family effect, although the\nlesser family variance component for young couples\nsuggests that assortative mating has limited explanatory\npower for health status. Finally, the amount of variation\nattributed to a particular hierarchical level in a multilevel\nmodel does not necessarily predict the strength of the\nexplanatory variables that operate at that level.29 For\ninstance, if there were little between-community vari-\nability in health status, then the model would assign little\nvariance to that level, even though community-level vari-\nables might exert strong effects on health status.\nIn conclusion, using data from a nationally repre-\nsentative US sample, we found a substantial population-\nlevel contribution of the family to health status. With\nthe availability of multilevel modeling as an analytical\ntool, further refinements in the understanding of the\nfamily's role in population health status should follow\nand contribute both to the basic science of family prac-\ntice and to the development of policy and interventions.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/3/2/102.\n",
