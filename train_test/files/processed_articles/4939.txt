The analysis suggests that Antony Duff's normative vision of\npunishment as moral communication may be difficult to realise in practice because of\nthe inevitable pressures on defendants in the courtroom and on prisoners during their\nincarceration. In the court, the men's attention was focused on the length of the sen-\ntence imposed; they were often overwhelmed by emotion and did not interact with the\ncourt as a moral arena. Within prison the men tended to accept their sentence in order\nto make bearing their incarceration easier. Comparing these men's lived experiences of\npunishment with Duff's normative theory highlights problems with the theory's poten-\ntial implementation but also reveals normative problems with current practices of\nsentencing and sanctioning.\n",

Many authors have pointed out the importance\nof examining offenders' views of the criminal justice process. It has been argued\nCorresponding author:\nMarguerite Schinkel, ESRC Future Leader Research Fellow, School of Social and Political Sciences, University\nof Glasgow, Ivy Lodge, 63 Gibson Street, Glasgow, G12 8LR, UK.\nEmail: marguerite.schinkel@glasgow.ac.uk\nthat soliciting offenders' accounts is necessary in order to describe the criminal\njustice system accurately, examine and possibly change it (Casper, 1972), to pro-\nmote respect for the system (McGinnis and Carlson, 1981) because disrespect for\nthe system may lead to further crime (Alpert and Hicks, 1977; Sherman, 1993) and\nto make rehabilitation more likely (Larson and Berg, 1989). Several authors have\nalso highlighted the need to investigate the lived (subjective) experience of punish-\nment in relation to normative theories, in order to understand what it is that the\ntheory is aiming to justify (Kolber, 2009; Rex, 2005). This article examines for the\nfirst time to what extent one influential theory, namely Antony Duff's theory of\npunishment as moral communication, matches up with conditions in the `real\nworld' of sentencing and sanctioning. Based on 27 narrative interviews with\nlong-term prisoners, it discusses whether punishment can serve as a form of\nmoral communication in the context of court and prison experiences. By compar-\ning a normative theory of what punishment should be with an empirical analysis of\nwhat sense the punished make of punishment, this article aims to shed light on both\nquestions and ultimately to contribute to debates about the relationships between\npurposes and practices of punishment.\nThe philosophy of punishment and moral communication\nThere are two main schools of thought in the justification of punishment: conse-\nquentialism and retributivism. Consequentialist theories state that punishment is\njustified if, and to the extent that, it has a positive effect on the world by reducing\ncrime (e.g. through deterrence, reform, rehabilitation or incapacitation).\nRetributive theories justify punishment with reference to the crime committed.\nThey hold that there is an intrinsic link between wrongdoing and punishment,\nwith the sentence seen as the offender's `just deserts', and argue that consequen-\ntialist justifications fail because they do not explain the necessary link between the\noriginal crime and the punishment. However, others have argued that many\nretributive theories, in turn, fail to make sense of the idea that punishment\nward-looking element of punishment.\nOne influential theory that attempts to explain both the connection to the crime\ncommitted and the need for possible positive impact is Antony Duff's (1996, 1999,\n(2001: 95) argues that when serious wrongs are committed, more is needed than\njust verbal censure and an apology: `To think that [the offender] could just apolo-\ngise, and then return to her normal life, would be to portray the wrong as a rela-\ntively trivial matter that did not seriously damage the victim or their relationship.'\nHe thereby explains the link between crime and punishment: the wrong com-\nmitted requires some kind of redress. This redress is delivered through `hard treat-\nment' or punishment, which is intended as a two-way communication. It\ndemonstrates to offenders the extent to which they have done wrong and focuses\ntheir attention on their crime and its consequences. At the same time, the hard\ntreatment constitutes a message from the offender. Duff (2003a: 300) writes that it\nis `a material and forceful expression of the apology that [the offender] owes to\nthose whom she wronged \u00ad to the direct victim of her crime, if there was one, and to\nthe wider community whose values she flouted'.\nThe wording here is important: hard treatment is an expression of the apology\nthat is owed, but this does not make it necessary that the offender is actually\nrepentant. When this is not the case, the sentence is still seen as having given\nadequate weight to what happened. The forward looking element of Duff's\ntheory, however, depends on the hard treatment being capable of bringing about\nrepentance and behavioural change. Besides having a communicative function hard\ntreatment is also an enforced secular penance (Duff, 2003a), which ideally leads to\nthe offender accepting responsibility and changing their ways (Duff, 1999).\nHowever, while this is an aim of the punishment, it is not the justification (this is\nnot a consequentialist theory) and the enforced penance cannot be continued\nsimply on the basis that the offender has not repented.\nDuff's (2003b: 192) account of criminal punishment focuses on community\npenalties, which he argues are by far the best suited to fulfilling the role of `com-\nmunicative penance' and should be used much more extensively. Imprisonment\nshould only play a very small role in the kind of criminal justice system he envis-\nages, as punishment for the most serious of crimes. He writes:\nThe message of imprisonment is that the offender has not just damaged or threatened,\nbut has broken, the normative bonds of community. He has made it impossible for us\nto live with him in the ordinary community of fellow citizenship unless and until he\nhas undergone this penitential punishment. (Duff, 2001: 150, emphasis in original)\nImprisonment, on Duff's account, communicates a need for exclusion to the offen-\nder, although he stresses this exclusion should always be temporary.\nThe relevance of lived experience\nAs Rex (2005: 3) has written, the views of those affected by criminal justice deci-\nsions cannot disprove normative theories: `you cannot prove an ``ought'''. Even a\nfinding that no prisoner has ever felt rehabilitated does not show that criminal\npunishment should not be justified by its rehabilitative function. Besides, Duff\n(2003a) has unequivocally stated that his account does not justify punishment as\nit is practised in our current society. Does the lived experience of punishment\nmatter, then, to normative theories in general and Duff's theory in particular?\nVarious writers have pointed out that, even if theories only justify an ideal\nsystem of punishment, they do need to be applicable to the world we live in. For\nexample, Murphy (1994: 58) writes `a theory may be formally correct (i.e. coherent\nor true for some possible world) but materially incorrect (i.e. inapplicable to the\nactual world in which we live)'. Moreover normative theories have been used to\nchange penal practices. For example, Duff's emphasis on the moral education of\nthe offender has found an expression in the cognitive behavioural programmes that\nare now being run for offenders on probation as part of the `What Works' agenda\n(Robinson, 2008). This type of influence, where aspects of a theory are taken on\nboard or borrowed by policy makers, necessitates examination of whether the\npractice is actually true to the theory (see also McNeill, 2012) and whether all\naspects of the theory that the justification of punishment depends upon are in\nplace. If either of these conditions is not fulfilled, then the practice cannot be\njustified with reference to the theory. It is clear that Duff (2001: 201) wants current\npractice to be examined against his theory, when he writes: `the task of justifying\ncriminal punishment . . . is the task of so transforming the content and context of\ncriminal punishment that it can become what it ought to be'.\nIn examining the lived experiences of punishment against this normative theory,\nthen, this article is intended both to highlight problems with the theory and provide\ninsight into how our system might need to change in order to deliver punishments\nthat can be justified as moral communication.\nPerceptions of the purpose of punishment\nFew studies have focused specifically on the purpose of prisons in offenders' eyes.\nOf the ones that have been conducted, most have found that prison is seen as\nPatrick and Marsh, 2001). Prisoners feel that, because they are confined with\nother offenders, they learn about crime, making them more likely to offend\n(Halsey, 2007; Kolstad, 1996). Deterrence has also been found to be only partially\nsuccessful. Halsey's (2007) narrative research with incarcerated young men in\nAustralia, found that while they saw deterrence as an intended effect of their impris-\nonment, they felt it was not achieved because the environment was not sufficiently\naversive, was familiar and provided respite from a more difficult life on the outside.\nOther research has found that (ex)prisoners do want to avoid further punishment,\nindicating that they have been deterred by their previous sentence(s) (Burnett,\n2004). In relation to the punitive function of sentences, Sexton (2012) found that\namong long-term prisoners in the USA perceptions of punishment increased when\nconditions were seen as symbolic (e.g. lack of health care as symbolic of lack of\nconcern for inmate's well-being) and when the salience of punishment was high.\nIn studies touching on perceptions of punishment, the criminal justice system as\na whole has been found to be positioned as a mighty adversary in the accounts of\nviolent offenders in the USA (Presser, 2008) and remand prisoners in Norway\n(Ugelvik, 2013), with experience of punitive regimes sometimes increasing feelings\nof hostility towards the criminal justice system (Franke et al., 2010). The well-\ndeveloped literature on legitimacy (Beetham, 1991) of prisons in the UK, on the\nother hand, suggests that some features of the prison environment might make a\ncritical examination of one's sentence difficult. Carrabine (2004) and Sparks et al.\n(1996) have pointed out that the reality and imposed routines of imprisonment can\nmake power relations in the prison seem inevitable, which means that these often\ngo unquestioned. Crewe's (2009) ethnography of HMP Wellingborough suggests\nthat the actual sentence may also remain unexamined by many prisoners, because\nmany are either resigned to a life of imprisonment, take their situation for granted\nor accept their sentence as fair. In his typology of reactions to imprisonment, it is\nonly the `stoics' and `players' (less than a third of prisoners in the study) who might\noppose their sentence on moral grounds. The literature on the legitimacy of impris-\nonment has also linked staff\u00adprisoner relationships, the provision of material goods\nand visits, and the way in which power in prison is operationalised to the legitimacy\nof the regime in prisoners' eyes (Carrabine, 2004; Sparks et al., 1996). Research on\nthe quality of life in prisons has found that prisoners additionally need to be able to\ngive their experience meaning, and to feel trusted and recognised as human beings\nStudies examining communicative aspects of sentencing have tended to be obser-\nvational studies, which did not seek the perspective of offenders. Generally, com-\nmunication between the judge and the offender has been found to be more common\nin youth courts (or Children's Hearings in Scotland) than in adult courts, although\neven in the former any such communication tends to be formulaic and fails to take\nin problem-solving courts (Dzur and Mirchandani, 2008), but the focus is often on\nthe progress made by the offender, meaning that communication is supportive and\nencouraging, rather than censorious (McIvor, 2009). The findings described here\nare intended to address this lack of knowledge about how any moral messages\ncontained in sentencing are perceived. However, the focus is not only on the\nmoment of sentencing, but also on the ongoing experience of serving the sentence.\nMore specifically, this article examines the experiences of men serving prison sen-\ntences of four years or longer (long-term sentences) in Scotland.\nMethodology\nTwenty-seven adult male long-term prisoners were interviewed at different stages of\ntheir sentence. Table 1 gives some basic information about each of the men, along\nwith the pseudonyms they chose, which will be used in the remainder of this article.\nThose who were still incarcerated were interviewed in two Scottish prisons, and\nthose on licence in two criminal justice social work offices near Glasgow. Most\ninterviews lasted between one and one-and-a-half hours, with the shortest interview\n39 minutes and the longest two hours and 20 minutes. A combined methodology\nwas used for all the interviews. The initial stage of the interviews was narrative,\nwith a focus on the way the men interpreted their sentence and incorporated it in\ntheir wider life story. Then, if they had not touched upon questions of legitimacy\nand purpose, they were asked specifically about these topics through semi-struc-\ntured questions. This methodology was not meant to uncover `what really hap-\npened'. It is now well acknowledged that qualitative interviews do not simply\ntransfer information held by the participant on what happened to the researcher\nTable 1.

Adapted\nfrom Schinkel (2014) with permission from Palgrave.2\n(e.g. Holstein and Gubrium, 1997; Riessman, 2008). Instead, interviews are sites of\nmeaning construction, where the active interpretation and selective description by\nparticipants of their experiences is influenced by the interview setting, context, audi-\nence and issues of what can be remembered and put into words (Polkinghorne, 2007).\nIssues of memory are especially significant for the men on licence and the men at the\nend of their sentence. Their descriptions of their experiences of the court case (and,\nfor those on licence, the sentence) may have been less than perfectly accurate, as it is\ndifficult for people to remember their attitudes and beliefs over long periods (Ruspini,\n2000). In addition, being interviewed by a researcher, who is ostensibly not herself\ninvolved in offending, and the fact that they were interviewed in criminal justice\npremises, is likely to have put pressure on the interviewees to distance themselves\nfrom their past behaviour (see also Presser, 2008). Accordingly, the findings below do\nnot aim to describe actual moral communication that took place in the courtroom or\nthe prison; that is a task for which observational studies are better suited. The men's\nrecollections of what happened in the courtroom will have been influenced by their\nsubsequent experiences, problems with recall and more active processes of selecting\nmaterial to fit their view of themselves or their life. But by examining prisoners'\nperceptions of moral communication it becomes possible to ascertain the salience\nof such communication for its recipients and to examine how the pressures of pris-\noners' situations, as well as their motivations and (desired) identities impacted on the\nway they narrated their experiences of moral communication.\nFindings\nMoral communication was much less salient than most other possible purposes,\nnotably reform, rehabilitation and deterrence, in the interviewees' accounts. Most\nof the men did not spontaneously refer to communication at all, and it loomed\nlarge as a purpose for only one of the men. In what follows I focus on themes\ndeveloped across interviews, usually in response to targeted questions about moral\ncommunication.\nMoral communication in the courtroom\nMany of the men remembered the attitude of the judge, if not his or her actual\nwords. More often than one would perhaps expect of long-term prisoners, they felt\nthe judge had shown a (partially) positive attitude towards them. Censure was far\nfrom the only content of the communication, nor could the court process often be\ncharacterised as a degradation ceremony, in which the whole offender was con-\ndemned (see also Daly and Bouhours, 2008; Presser, 2008). In several of the men's\naccounts the judge was described as highlighting the positive, rather than censuring\nconduct:\nI was expecting him to say like something like `this was a brutal, barbaric attack' or\nsomething like that, you know but he never even said anything like that . . . I can\nremember him saying `it shows here this report that you (.) eehm, (.) it shows extreme\nremorse' know what I mean and I can't remember him saying anything bad about me\nor anything like that, no. (Doug)1\nDoug and others expected more censure than was delivered. Others even por-\ntrayed the judge as being on `their side', describing how the judge's comments\nduring their court case made it clear that they disapproved of the proceedings.\nTim was very young when he was charged with murder and recalled how the\njudge questioned whether he could have been the sole person responsible for\nwhat Tim described as `15 to 20 people mobbing and rioting in the street'. Tim\nportrayed the judge as having been reluctant to imprison him:\nHe said `it saddens me tae see two families ruined (2) wi' this' and he says `I need tae\ncompose myself tae pass this sentence' so he went away for five minutes and came\nback after he composed himself and says (3). But he was bound by law that I was\nfound guilty wi' my peers and he had tae sentence me, so. And that aspect I think\nthat's how the eight years came into it as well.\nIn this description of the sentencing comments, the judge, rather than censuring\nTim and appealing to his morality, limited the censure that may have been per-\nceived as inherent in the hard treatment imposed, and also limited this hard treat-\nment as much as he was able.\nOthers, like Tim, positioned the judge as being bound by guidelines. Despite the\nabsence of sentencing guidelines in Scotland and the only mandatory sen-\ntences being those for murder and third convictions of class A drug offences\n(Jamieson et al., 2010), several of the men said the judge had no choice in their\npunishment:\nM: What do you think the purpose of giving you this prison sentence was for the\njudge, like why did he give you six years in prison?\nPaul: Well that's [clears throat] judging by the crime, that's the guidelines he's went\nwith, nothing else (.) guidelines.\nThe way that Paul frames his answer suggests a need to neutralise the judge as a\nmoral arbiter. He emphasised that the guidelines determined the judges' actions, in\nsaying that nothing else played a role, thereby denying any kind of moral judgement\nor censure.\nThis neutralisation of the judge also sheds a different light on the previous\nparagraphs, which discussed the positive communication and attitude of the\njudge in some of the accounts. Participants might have selected positive rather\nthan negative aspects of communication, both in what they remembered\nand what they chose to tell me, because being censured is likely to be painful.\nThe following exchange with Jack shows that, at least sometimes, selective remem-\nbering was intentional:\nM: Did the Judge say anything when he sentenced you?\nJack: Not that I can remember no, it's just like a kinda blank. I kinda just shove that\n(2) see if you had a wee box in your heid an it was a box that if you fling somethin' in it\nnever gets opened up again, I have like something like that. I flung it in it and forget/\ntry and just/never, know what I mean, just kid on it never even existed, it never\nhappened and just get on wi it.\nM: Okay so what kind of things do you put in the box then?\nJack: Just like whatever/like `aye you've got nine year, you've been a bloody this and a\nthat to society' or whatever. Whatever, it just/you know what I mean, he can say\nwhatever else he wants, because I'm no interested. I'm goin' doon the stair tae get on\nwi my sentence.\nBy bracketing the judge's comments in this way, Jack consciously avoided any\ncensure directed at him, illustrating how identity and processes of meaning\nmaking affect the impact of moral messages.\nAlthough Jack was the only one to describe his own defence mechanisms, several\nothers also resisted the judge's censure. Of those who remembered being censured,\nmost rejected the judge's moral communication, for different reasons. Some felt\nthat the judge's reading of the situation in which they had offended was unrealistic.\nHe said `taking into consideration the way you've been living your life, it's been on the\nstreets' and it was/he was like that `but you could have walked away from the boy',\neven though the boy was shouting and cursing and swearing at a girl I was with, he\nwas like `you could have walked away from it, instead of, instead of knocking him\nout'. (Graham)\nGraham disagreed with the judge's reading of the situation, objecting that it is\nnot possible to walk away when someone is `shouting and cursing and swearing' at\na girl. Others rejected the judge's censure because they felt the judge did not know\nthem sufficiently and only judged them on their record, or because they felt the\njudge attributed too many harmful consequences to them as an individual (e.g. in\nrelation to drug dealing). It is interesting that censure was resisted even if, as in the\nexample above, the judge condemned the offence committed, but not the whole\nperson, as recommended by Braithwaite (2000) in his theory or reintegrative sham-\ning. Conversely, when the judge engaged in stigmatisation, the condemnation of\nthe offender instead of the offence (Braithwaite, 2000), the men were not always\nopposed to this, even though it has been predicted this should lead to defiance,\nespecially for poorly bonded individuals (Sherman, 1993). Some of those who did\nnot reject or neutralise the censure directed at them in the courtroom were con-\ndemned as people by the judge.\nJames: Where the judge talked to me was in the XTC [ecstacy] one, because he had all\nthe records from the High Courts, all the previous High Courts and he called me an\nevil man.\nM: And what did you think of that?\nJames: In a way, aye, you ken what I mean. A lot, a lot of previous, about three or\nfour pages. So in a way, aye.\nIt is clear, though, that after the initial statement made by the judge, James has\nhad no further input from the criminal justice system in the way he thinks about his\ncrime or punishment. The tentativeness with which he comes to his conclusion\nstrongly suggests that he has never before reflected on the judge's message despite\ndescribing having long stretches of time for reflection in prison, which he saw as\nhaving changed him. While censure was evident in the judge's comments, they seem\nto have had no further impact on James or his thinking, but instead have been left\nbehind in the courtroom.\nIs moral communication in the courtroom possible?\nJack's earlier quote, where he said the judge `can say whatever else he wants because\nI'm no interested, I'm goin' doon the stair tae get on wi' my sentence' illustrates a\nproblem with moral communication in the courtroom. For those who are expecting\nand receiving long sentences, there is so much at stake that they are unlikely to hear\nmuch beyond how long they have to spend in prison. Devan described vividly the\nemotional impact hearing his (unexpectedly long) sentence had on him:\nJudge turns around and looks at me and goes `Mr. X, you're getting (.) seven and a\nhalf years', BOOM. [Laughs.] And I'm that `No way'. At that moment in time, I\nthought he was joking, like. And then, I was frozen, I was still standing up there and\nhe was just talking, talking and talking and saying whatever he was saying. I was just\nstill standing there. I was just like `No way, man'.\nIt is telling that almost all of the men described the moment of sentencing with a\nsense of real drama. Many struggled with the knowledge they were going to prison\nfor years, even when the sentence was (less than) expected.\nYou're gutted, but you know it's going to happen. When you're out robbing people\nyou know you're going to jail sooner or later. . . . But when I got this sentence I was\ngutted because the wean was only three weeks old at the time. That's when you realise,\nyou know what I'm talking about? I'm going away for a while, but I don't think you\nrealise it at the time. (Ian)\nIan's quote illustrates that there are different ways of `knowing': rationally\nknowing versus realising viscerally that you will not see your family again; that\nthis is a certainty and no longer just a likelihood. Being shocked, like Devan, or\ntrying to assimilate the emotional reality of an expected sentence, like Ian, means\nbeing deaf to anything going on in the courtroom. As Hudson (2002: 631) has\nnoted, what the judge says `is almost inevitably lost on the offender as he gives\nhis attention to the sentence'. In order to take on the meaning of a message, in a\nway that leads to long-term attitude change, the recipient needs to be free\nnot true of someone who has just heard they are sentenced to long-term\nimprisonment.\nFurthermore, given the huge personal investment my interviewees had in the\noutcome of their court case, it is not surprising that they did not submit to the court\nas a moral arena but tried to manipulate the process in order to minimise their\nsentence. Lino linked his untruthful `not guilty' plea directly to the length of the\nsentence he faced:\nBut, there was no way I was daein' that [pleading guilty], the longest I'd spent in\nprison was six months I think and that was/that felt like forever so I was like, there\nwas no way I was gonnae put my hands up to this.\nThe men's sense that the courtroom did not have any great moral standing was\nintensified by their view that the lawyers, and even the judges, were playing the\nsame game:\nPeter: See, if I hadnae pled early, I would have walked fucking the eight year.\nM: But why is that, usually if you plead early you get less, don't you?\nPeter: Aye, you get a third off your sentence, I know, but because they'd heard I'd put\nin an early plea, they put my sentence up.\nThis replicates Casper's (1972) finding that judges and prosecutors, like the\npolice, were seen by defendants as workers who sometimes take shortcuts, rather\nthan neutral or impartial actors and Ugelvik's (2013) finding that remand prisoners\nin Norway constructed the criminal justice system as an adversary that does not\nplay by its own rules. Carlen (1976), in an observational study, found that court\npersonnel often colluded with each other and were more concerned with their own\nstanding than with the case. This collusion of professionals was recognised\nby Devan, who felt this, along with much of what went on in court, made for an\nunfair system:\nBecause, another thing that is crazy about this system and how things are up here\nare/I know you and you know me, right, for instance. I represents the defendant,\nyou represents the Crown, the prosecutor. Me and you work in the SAME office,\nright? We go to the same nightclubs or whatever, we go to the same bars or what-\never. I actually speak to you ALL THE TIME. I actually know you, we're friends,\nand YOU'RE UP AGAINST ME. Is that not a JOKE AND A HALF, man?\nWhen court actors attempt to manipulate outcomes, bargain with the defendant\nfor a guilty plea or collude in a visible way, this not only reduces the moral standing\nof the courts in offenders' eyes, but also problematises the communication of cen-\nsure through sentencing. Weijers (2004) has noted that moral communication is less\nlikely to take place in an adversarial system than in an inquisitorial system, because\nin the former most of the proceedings take the form of a contest between prosecu-\ntors and defenders. In this research, some of those who had been defendants pos-\nitioned themselves, too, as active participants in the court contest. But the more\ncourtroom proceedings become (or are interpreted as) an adversarial game, the\nweaker any moral communication becomes. How the moral element is lost is\nclearly described by Mohammed:\nI think at the time during the trial, all I'm interested in is getting away wi' it. It's after\nthe trial's done wi' and you're doing the time and you kinda look at it and you think\n`that was a lot more serious than I kinda thought at the time'.\nIf the sentence is settled upon for reasons of expediency (avoiding the expense of\na trial) or through manipulation of the rules and processes by court actors (as well\nas defendants themselves), then the link between the amount of censure inherent in\nthe sentence and the initial offence is surely lost.\nThere are three main reasons, then, why moral communication is problematic\nin a court with the power to impose long-term prison sentences. So much\ndepends on the exact length of the sentence and the emotional impact of being\nimprisoned is so great that the offender is unlikely to attend to any moral com-\nments made by the judge. Second, the stakes are so high that offenders are highly\ntempted to manipulate the outcome, thereby rejecting the moral dimension of\ncourt proceedings. Finally, analogous manipulation by court actors lessens the\nmoral standing of the court and diminishes the extent to which the sentence can\nbe seen as censure deserved for the initial offence. With the court such a prob-\nlematic site of moral communication, the next section examines whether the\nmoral dimensions of crime and punishment were more successfully explored\nwithin the prison.\nMoral communication in prison\nMost interviewees commented that the only time their offence, their sentence and\nquestions of morality were discussed within the prison was during cognitive\nbehavioural courses. For example, Dan said `the only people who spoke to me\nabout my offence here were the people in the courses'. Some of the men had not\nbeen assessed as needing these, and were therefore left without any discussion of\nmoral questions or the meaning of their sentence. Robinson (2008: 438) has\nargued that some of the cognitive behavioural courses used in criminal justice\naspire to Duff's `transparent persuasion': censure of the offending behaviour is\nexpressed and offenders are encouraged to reflect morally on their offence.\nHowever, the fact that attendance of courses is made compulsory for progression\nwithin the prison means that real persuasion is problematic (see also Schinkel,\n2014). Most of the men reported only attending them to secure their progression\nwithin the prison:\nNo, it's sort of that, up there, it's just a numbers game. And they sort of try to frighten\nyou with, you don't do that, you don't get your parole. People do it and people just go\non and sit in a class and just say nothing. And they cannae do nothing because the\nboy's just sitting there, y'know. (Graham)\nBy making courses compulsory for progression, formal compliance (meeting the\nminimum requirements, i.e. `just sitting there') rather than substantive compliance\n(actively engaging with what is on offer) (Robinson and McNeill, 2008) is\nencouraged.\nThe general absence of an intentional and meaningful dialogue about crime and\npunishment initiated by prison staff is best illustrated by some of the men's com-\nments on the experience of being interviewed. For example, Alan said `you've\nlistened to me but I don't get asked these questions anywhere else in the jail so\nnobody really (.)'. This silence around questions of wrongdoing and legitimacy of\npunishment (which has also been noted in the French context (Herzog-Evans,\n2011)), makes it very easy for prisoners not to engage with these questions.\nA further limiting factor on moral communication taking place within the prison\nwas the way in which the men adapted to their prison sentence. In order to make\nbearing their confinement easier, the men adopted a strategy of `getting your head\ndown' \u00ad limiting thoughts to events within the prison. As Doug said `when you've\ngot years tae go and you just don't think aboot it and it's just (.) your head's in\nhere, this is your life in here you know what I mean, in this wee small surrounding'.\nThis strategy included accepting one's sentence:\nYou have to say `this is it, this is me for the next x amount of years, I'm not going out\nanyway, so (.), you know, just get on with it, try to make the best of it. (Neil)\nIt's still fair, I'm here, I'm doing it. It doesn't have to be fair, that's how I'm dealing with\nit. (Peter, emphasis added)\nAs Peter's quote illustrates, however, this strategy had the effect of further\nsilencing normative questions around their offence and their sentence. Because\nthere was such pressure on the men to accept their sentence in order to make\nsurviving it easier, this acceptance was decoupled from their thoughts on their\ncrime and punishment. Even those who maintained they were innocent neverthe-\nless acquiesced in their sentence by linking it to past or possible future\nwrongdoing:\nMaybe a sentence was just waiting to happen. Maybe no/maybe not as much\nor as long a sentence, but with the crowd I was running about with at the time,\npretty much, see, there was maybe a sentence in the making, you know what I\nmean? (Gordon)\nUnder such circumstances, any normative message meant to be conveyed by the\nprison sentence will be rendered irrelevant.\nNone of my interviewees perceived the communicative meaning of a need for\nexclusion that Duff ascribes to prison sentences. Why this might be the case can be\nusefully explored by referring to the men's views on incapacitation. Incapacitation\nwas only perceived by the men as a purpose of their imprisonment when they saw\nthemselves as dangerous, or when it was explicitly mentioned as a purpose by the\ncourt, as illustrated by the following two quotes:\nI think my sentence at the time did achieve its purpose, they just wanted me off the\nstreet at the time, cause AT THE TIME I was very dangerous. (Stephen)\nThat was in the judge's report, basically if I'm locked away then the public has less\nchance of getting harmed. And the witnesses or whatever. (Gordon)\nPerceptions of other purposes were also generally due to either a perception of\nneed (notably rehabilitation and reform) or information from other sources, usu-\nally the judge's comments or the court report. As none of the court actors or\nreports framed the sentence as communicating a need for exclusion, none of the\nmen were induced by the court to see their sentence as such. And while some of the\nmen felt they needed to be incapacitated because of what they might otherwise do,\nnone saw themselves as needing to be excluded because they had already broken the\nbonds of society. It is likely that this is at least in part because this conceptualisa-\ntion of imprisonment is not part of the public discourse and common understand-\nings of criminal punishment. However, it may also be because the men, like many\nin relation to incapacitation, had no reason to see themselves as needing to be\nexcluded (see below).\nConclusion\nThis article has looked in some depth at the way in which long-term prisoners'\naccounts of their sentence resonated with portrayals of criminal punishment as\nmoral communication. It has highlighted important aspects in which current prac-\ntice and Duff's theory of punishment diverge. First of all, little explicit moral\ncommunication was perceived by the men. They described any moral dialogue\nand censure as patchy at best and there was no consistent moral message attached\nto long-term imprisonment. My interviewees had had very little guidance in think-\ning about their crime and their punishment, instead being left to create their own\nmeanings. The findings here furthermore suggest that any censure in the courtroom\nis unlikely to be taken on board, at least when long-term sentences are imposed.\nMoral censure from the judge was generally either not perceived (sometimes wil-\nfully so) or opposed. Moreover, with long-term prison sentences looming, the men\nwere not able or willing to pay much attention to moral communication or to\nengage with the court as a moral arena.\nWithin the prison, the only consistent communicative input came from struc-\ntured group-work programmes. The question is whether moral communication\nshould be delivered solely through such programmes. Burnett (2004) has argued\nfor a return to one-to-one counselling for offenders in order to support the desis-\ntance process. More one-to-one input would also seem welcome in order to get\nprisoners to reflect on their sentence and to give it a meaning within their lives.\nHowever, the extent to which moral communication could be delivered through\nlong-term sentences was limited by the adaptation strategy adopted by the men. In\norder to cope, they shrunk their world down to the prison walls and accepted their\nsentence. The importance of accepting the sentence in this context means that any\ndiscussion that leads to a more critical understanding of the sentence would either\nbe resisted or make the sentence harder to bear. In the case of the former, the\ncommunication will not have had an impact; in the case of the latter it will exacer-\nbate the pains of imprisonment precisely for those who have reason to oppose it,\nwhich cannot be a desired outcome. I do not want to suggest that the adaptation\nprocess described here is necessary for all (long-term) prisoners. Different prisons\nand different conditions within them will support different adaptations. For exam-\nple, Liebling et al. (2011) have recently described how prisoners in Whitemoor,\nwhere surveillance was all-pervasive and staff\u00adprisoner relations poor, tried to\nforget they were in prison as much as possible, rather than forgetting the outside\nworld. They also were much more likely than my interviewees to oppose their\nsentence. Similarly, remand prisoners in Norway, who are still involved in an\nadversarial process with the criminal justice system generally saw the system in\nnegative terms (Ugelvik, 2013). What this shows, though, is that different forms\nand environments of imprisonment create their own pressures, which are likely to\ntake precedence over the need to reflect on the punishment in relation to the crime\ncommitted. This means that such sentences are less than ideally suited for the\ncommunicative purpose ascribed to them by Duff (2001). Applying Duff's theory\nin the `real world' of sentencing might require us to cap explicitly the length of\nimprisonment that can be imposed, as this article has shown that longer sentences\ncreate emotional reactions and pressures to cope that overshadow any communi-\ncation inherent in the sanction. Duff's (2001: 151, emphasis in original) character-\nisation of three years' imprisonment as a `very harsh punishment' shows that a limit\non the length of sentences is already evident in his work, if not explicit.\nFurthermore, for current practice to come closer to realising Duff's theory, the\nfindings reported here suggest court processes and the content of prison sentences\nwould need to be changed. If the court is to be experienced as a moral arena, its\nprocesses need to be re-imagined so that the outcome is more straightforwardly\nrelated to the offence. The adversarial nature of the process, plea-bargaining, giving\ntime off for an early guilty plea and other elements would have to be re-considered,\nand there could be greater involvement of the offender in the determination of the\nappropriate punishment (Weaver, 2009). Equally, the moral-dialogical aspect of\npunishment might need to be more carefully attended to in the execution of sen-\ntences, perhaps as an alternative to pedagogical forms of rehabilitation. Even in the\ncontext of shorter sentences, a facilitated dialogue about the moral connection\nbetween crime and punishment could complement the court process in facilitating\nmoral reflection, without making this overly painful for those for whom this con-\nnection is less secure.\nMost seriously, however, current practice falls short of Duff's theory in the kinds\nof offences for which imprisonment is imposed. Duff (2001: 151) has not attempted\nto define precisely what offences break the bonds of community to the extent that\ncommunicating a need for exclusion is appropriate. He writes:\nAny answer depends on the community's understanding of what kinds of wrong make\ncommunity impossible. But that understanding can change, and itself depends not\nmerely on the character of the wrongs involved but on the willingness of other mem-\nbers of the community to live with those who commit them.\nWhen this statement is applied to the crimes committed by some of the men I\ninterviewed, it would seem that its criteria do not apply. One obvious candidate\nfor `the gravest of crimes' would be murder, but while several of my interviewees\nhad caused someone else to die, it is not clear that their acts would cause others to\nshun them. Graham threw one punch, and only caused death because of an unlucky\nfall and previous health issues of the deceased. While the consequences were tragic,\nit is unlikely that he would be condemned as `beyond the pale' by the wider com-\nmunity. Tim and Mohammed both injured (and in one case killed) someone who\nwas simultaneously attacking them. When two boys or young men with knives\nattack each other, society at large may be horrified that such things happen, but\nis less likely to be horrified by the actions of the accused alone, given that the victim\nwas also actively involved in the violence. Other offences more obviously did not\nbreak the bonds of community, including carrying a knife (Lino) and selling small\namounts of drugs (many others), especially since, on Duff's (2001) account,\ncriminal history should generally not be taken into consideration. Most of the\ninterviewees who had conceivably committed crimes that broke the bonds of com-\nmunity tended to be men who had not benefited from inclusion in the community in\nTo suggest that those who have been systematically excluded or unjustly disadvan-\ntaged may not be bound by the law . . . is not to suggest that their criminal actions are\njustified, permissible or excusable . . . It is, rather, to suggest that their actions are not\nwrong qua criminal: that they are not to be judged (justified, excused, or condemned)\nby the law, in terms of its demands and requirements.\nFor both these groups of men, then, imprisonment as an expression of their\nwrongdoing, intended to make them reflect and repent, cannot justify their sen-\ntence, according to Duff's theory. Sentencing will need to be re-examined, and the\nsystematic exclusion of those who (go on to) offend taken more seriously, so that it\nis only those who have been sufficiently part of the community and committed acts\nthat merit exclusion from this community who are imprisoned.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G013012/1].\n"
