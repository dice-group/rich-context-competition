    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground The purpose of this study was to examine\nattitudes towards attempts to limit second-hand smoke\n(SHS) in five Eastern European nations.\nMethods The data consist of a Eurobarometer (64.3)\nsurvey distributed from November to December 2005.\nLogistic regression was employed to investigate support\nlevels for indoor smoking bans across the five political\nunits.\nResults Across nations, there is more support for\nsmoking bans in offices and indoor work spaces and\nindoor public space as opposed to restaurants and bars\nand pubs. Personal smoking behaviours are linked\nstrongly with the smoking bans. Most importantly, it is\nspecific knowledge about the health dangers of smoking\nwhich fosters support for indoor smoking bans.\nConclusion Policy implications suggest that government\nand the media must disseminate accurate information\nabout the harm of smoking to broader segments of the\npopulation to gain support for policies that affect the\ndangers of SHS in these nations.\nEastern European nations have higher smoking\nrates than their Western European neighbours;\nsimilarly, countries in the East lag behind the West\nin implementing smoking bans.1e5 The purpose of\nthis brief report is to assess support for bans on\nindoor smoking in five nations with high levels of\ntobacco use and comparatively few restrictions on\nlimiting second-hand smoke (SHS). These nations\nare Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Turkey and the\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\nIn Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey, there\nare complete smoking bans in healthcare, education\nand government facilities. Theatres and cinemas\nalso ban smoking in these nations. The most\npermissive smoking facilities include pubs and bars.\nThere are no restrictions in Romania and Turkey\nwhile Bulgaria and Croatia have partial restrictions.\nAfter 6 months of experimentation, Croatia\npartially eased their smoking ban in cafes in\nresponse to complaints from smokers and business\nowners. There are complete bans in indoor work-\nplaces and offices in Bulgaria and Croatia, but only\na partial restriction in Turkey and virtually no\nrestrictions in Romania.2 Despite these legal\nrestrictions, compliance and enforcement have\noftentimes been lax.6\nMETHODS\nThe data consist of a Eurobarometer (64.3) survey\neach nation, the sample design consisted of\na multistage random probability sample.7 The\nsurvey research teams carried out a comparison\nbetween the sample and the universe in each\nnation. The universe description was based on\nEurostat population data or was drawn from\nnational statistical offices. For all countries, the\nsurvey team used a national weighting procedure,\nusing marginal and intercellular weighting, based\non the universe description. The iteration procedure\ntook into account gender, age and size of locality.\nWe used the STATA V.10 subprogram SVY: Logistic\n(regression) to adjust for the complexities of the\nsampling design. This allowed the application of\nsample weights for each nation. While the findings\nare similar when the weights were not utilised, the\nweighting procedure resulted generally in more\nconservative estimates and probability levels for the\nsample size. Further details on the universe sizes\ncan be obtained.6 The response rates are as follows:\n(89.8%). For the dependent variables, respondents\nwere asked to express their support for bans on\nsmoking in one of four locations: restaurants; bars\nor pubs; offices and other indoor workspaces; and\nany indoor public space such as metros, airports\nand shops. The specific question is, \"Are you in\nfavour of smoking bans in the following places?\"\nThe dependent variable originally consisted of\nfive categories (totally opposed to totally in favour);\nhowever, an initial ordered logit analysis did not\nmeet the assumption of parallel regressions as\nindicated by Brant tests in all equations. Thus, we\nused a logistic regression analysis where 1\u00bctotally\nin favour or somewhat in favour, and 0\u00bctotally\nopposed, somewhat opposed or don't know.\nFor the explanatory variables, we first measured\ncountry-specific effects with dummy variables that\nwere created for Bulgaria, Croatia, Northern\nCyprus and Turkey (1,0). Romania serves as the\nreference (comparison) nation. Two binary vari-\nables were created for ex-smokers and non-smokers.\nThe reference category is current smokers. Five\npossible responses (never to often) were utilised to\nmeasure how often an individual was bothered by\nexposure to tobacco smoke in their daily lives.\nAssertiveness on SHS was measured by a five-\ncategory question (also never to often) that queried\nwhether the respondent ever asked a smoker not to\nsmoke because it bothered him/her. Ideology was\ncaptured in a 10-point question where high values\nrepresented the right and low values represented\nthe left. Government role legitimacy in health was\ntapped by a five-category question (totally disagree\nto totally agree) that asked whether government\nshould \"encourage people to eat a healthy diet and\ntake plenty of exercise\". A satisfactory diet\n1College of Public Health,\nUniversity of Georgia, Athens,\nGeorgia, USA\n2School of Public and\nInternational Affairs, University\nof Georgia, Athens, Georgia,\nUSA\nCorrespondence to\nJerome S Legge Jr, School of\nPublic and International Affairs,\nUSA; jlegge@uga.edu\nPublished Online First\nThis paper is freely available\nonline under the BMJ Journals\nunlocked scheme, see http://\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com/site/\nabout/unlocked.xhtml\nBrief report\nconsisted of five categories (no, not good at all to yes, very good)\nin answer to the statement \"what I eat is good for my health\".\nGeneral health was measured by five categories (very bad to very\ngood). We utilised a five-point question (totally disagree to\ntotally agree) to assess whether the respondent believed that\nsmoking \"in the presence of a pregnant woman can be dangerous\nto the baby\". We used a binary variable to determine if the\nrespondent believed that SHS is \"harmless\" or \"harmful\". The\nresearchers constructed binary variables for gender, manual\nworker and unemployment. Women, manual workers and the\nunemployed were coded \"1\" with the remainder of the sample\ncoded as \"0\". We measured education by the total years spent in\nschool.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 lists the percentages of those \"totally in favor\" or\n\"somewhat in favor\" of the smoking bans. Across nations, the\ngreatest level of support for the antismoking measures is found\nconcerning smoking in indoor workplaces and indoor public\nspaces. There is much less support for smoking bans in restau-\nrants and bars and pubs. Overall, Romania demonstrates the\nleast support for indoor smoking bans except for smoking bans\nin bars and pubs, where the Croatians are less likely to be\nsupportive.\nTable 2 shows the results of the four multivariable logistic\nregressions. There is evidence of a strong, consistent nation-\nspecific effect, consistent with the results in table 1. Non-\nsmokers and ex-smokers are more amenable than current\nsmokers towards indoor smoking bans, with higher odds ratios\nfor restaurants and bars and pubs.\nOn three of the four dependent variables, being bothered by\nSHS was associated with increased support for smoking bans.\nMore important is individual assertiveness concerning SHS; if\na respondent would ask a smoker not to smoke, the ORs are\nfrom 1.27 to 1.34 times greater that they would support indoor\nsmoking bans of all types.\nTable 1 Support for indoor smoking bans in Romania, Bulgaria, Northern Cyprus and Croatia and Turkey\nNation\nRomania Bulgaria N Cyprus Croatia Turkey\nPer cent \"Totally in favor\" or \"Somewhat in favor\"\n*Indoor public spaces include metros, airports and shops.\nTable 2 Logistic regression explaining attitudes towards indoor smoking bans (ORs)\nExplanatory variables\nRestaurants Bars and pubs Offices Indoor spaces\nNation dummies\nSmoking behaviour\nRole of government\nHealth\nSmoking belief knowledge\nDemographics\nSHS, second-hand smoke.\nBrief report\nIdeology was significant only in the case of smoking in offices\nwith those on the right somewhat less likely to support the ban.\nThose who view government as having a strong role in health\nare more likely to support the smoking bans across all categories,\nexcept for the marginal 0.055 level of significance for indoor\nspaces. Higher general health was associated with greater\nsupport for smoking bans in restaurants and offices.\nKnowledge of the general harmful effects of smoking and the\nnegative effects of SHS on pregnancies is strongly and consistently\nrelated to increased support for the indoor bans.\nThe present analysis demonstrates no strong demographic\neffects, with one exceptiondage; the older the individual, the\ngreater the support for bans in restaurants and bars.\nDISCUSSION\nThe limitations of this study include the fact that the data on\nsmoking behaviour are self-reported. Given that tobacco use is\na somewhat sensitive social issue, there may be some impreci-\nsion in the responses. In addition, the results can be generalised\nonly to the nations included in this study, which have a history\nof high tobacco consumption.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the findings have impor-\ntant implications for policy and practice. First, although\nsmoking is a huge public health problem among these nations,\nthere are important differences in support. Romania has the\nlargest problem in attaining acceptance of the bans. With the\nexception of Croatia in the case of bars and pubs, support for the\nindoor bans is stronger across every nation and for each depen-\ndent variable. Nonetheless, it is important to note that there\nwas major support in each country for bans in restaurants, bars\nand pubs, indoor workspaces, and indoor public places (the only\nexception being support for smoke-free bars and pubs among\nCroatians), and the support was greater than 70% in 13 of the 20\ncombinations of locations and country (see table 1). These\nfindings should be advertised to the general population, and to\npolicy makers and other key opinion leaders.\nSecond, as has been well-documented in the literature, indi-\nviduals' attitudes are associated with their own smoking\nbehaviour.8 9 Smokers are less supportive of bans that limit\ntheir behaviour. Those who reported better health in general are\nmore supportive of smoking bans.10 Further, younger respon-\ndents are less likely to support smoking bans than older\nThe best potential for increasing support for indoor smoking\nbans appears to be respondents learning about the harmful\neffects of SHS.17e19 The analysis has demonstrated that indi-\nviduals who know about the harmful effects of SHS are more\napt to support bans on indoor smoking than others. Media and\ngovernment must disseminate accurate information on the\nhealth effects of SHS if there are to be substantial changes in\nbehaviour. Current efforts include those by the World Health\nOrganization in these nations that encourage utilisation of\nprimary care providers, advocate strong leadership in commu-\nnity and government organizations, and media campaigns to\nrelay information that will increase knowledge and decrease\nsmoking.20 This information will continue to compete against\nstrong cultural norms that encourage smoking in these Eastern\nEuropean nations.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge the following sources: Papacostas,\nAntonis. 2007.

Age, gender, class, education and employment\nstatus have been strong predictors of support for antismoking\npolicies and tobacco use in general.\n< In this analysis of indoor smoking bans in Bulgaria, Croatia,\nNorthern Cyprus, Romania and Turkey, demographic variables\nare of little importance. Instead, knowledge of the potentially\nharmful effects of tobacco emerges as the more important and\nconsistent explanation of support for these policies. Our\nfindings suggest that public health practitioners in these\nnations should focus on widely disseminating accurate\ninformation on the health effects of second-hand smoke.\nBrief report\n17.
