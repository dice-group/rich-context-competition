On the other hand, evi-\ndence points out that chronic systemic inflammation plays a\nmajor role in the pathological process associated with the MS.\nThe serum levels of an inflammatory marker, C-reactive pro-\ntein (CRP), not only correlate with all components of MS but\nalso correlate with insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction,\nand impaired fibrinolysis (5,6). It is likely that the proinflam-\nmatory state of obesity induces insulin resistance, triggers a\nvicious cycle of positive reinforcement between inflammation\nand insulin resistance, and leads to clinical and biochemical\nmanifestations of MS (7,8).\nPrevious attempts to explore and model the complex inter-\naction among the metabolic components were attempted with\nvarious statistical models, such as principal component and\nfactor analysis. Haffner and colleagues verified the existence of\na single factor that linked all of the core components (9). Also,\nFord showed that patterns of factors of variables, often asso-\nciated with MS, tended to be similar among whites, African\nAmericans, and Mexican Americans (10). However, the inter-\naction among various components of MS is far more com-\nplicated than what conventional statistical methods can deal\nwith.

Anthropometric measurements, biochemical profiles,\nand high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed\nto elucidate a pathway in which obesity initiated the cascade leading to full MS. The results of SEM demonstrated\nthat obesity was positively associated with elevated CRP level (B = 0.05, P < 0.001). This higher inflammatory state\ndirected to insulin resistance (B = 0.32, P < 0.001), which in turn was positively associated with dyslipidemia (B = 0.06,\nP < 0.001). Obesity could also directly and positively affect blood pressure (B = 0.51, P < 0.001), without the mediation\nof insulin resistance and/or inflammation. The results of the cross-sectional analysis in the white subjects have shown\nthat obesity has a strong influence on hypertension that obtains little additional influence from inflammation or insulin\nresistance. The metabolic profile in the NHANES group has been confirmatory with the statement that there is a\nsequential effect from obesity to inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This approach has allowed to\ninferring important biological insights about the nature of the relationships among the components of MS.\n1Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; 2Cardiovascular Center,\nNational Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin Branch, Dou-Liou City, Taiwan; 3Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Chung-Cheng University, Chia-Yi, Taiwan.\nCorrespondence: Jou-Wei Lin (jouweilin@yahoo.com)\narticles\n \nbe considered as a whole, which is the superiority of struc-\ntural equation modeling.

Detailed Survey Operations\nManuals, Consent Documents, and Brochures of the NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2002 are available in the NHANES website. None of the authors has a\ndirect involvement in the NHANES study.\nAnthropometric and biochemical data\nData were collected at all study sites by trained personnel according to\nstandardized procedures. Sociodemographic information such as age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity was collected during the household inter-\nview. Laboratory measurements were performed in a mobile examina-\ntion center. Weight and height were measured using standard methods\nand digitally recorded. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of height in meters. Waist circumference was\nmeasured at the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1cm. Three and sometimes\nfour blood pressure (BP) determinations were taken using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer by a physician. BP was measured in the right arm\nunless otherwise specified. Averaged SBP and DBP were obtained.\nFasting blood was sampled, processed locally, then stored and shipped\nto central laboratories for analysis. Levels of total serum cholesterol and\nTGs (measured in the morning examination session only) were measured\nenzymatically, levels of HDL-C were measured using precipitation, and\nlevels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were calculated\nusing the Friedewald equation. Plasma glucose levels were processed by\nusing hexokinase enzymatical method. Serum insulin levels were deter-\nmined by radioimmunoassay. Serum CRP levels were measured by latex-\nenhanced nephelometry.\nData restriction\nLipid and glucose profiles in the African Americans and the Hispanics\nintheNHANESdatasetweremostlyincomplete.Therefore,theanalysis\nwas restricted to the white participants aged 19. Subjects with medica-\ntion, such as antihypertensive, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, and\nlipid-lowering agents, were excluded so as not to distort the estimation\nof the relationship among CRP, glucose, lipid profile, and BP.\nStatistics\nThe comparison between anthropometric and biochemical measure-\nments was made between men and women by Student's t-test. The prev-\nconducted, and individual components was compared with 2-test.\nSEM\nA SEM was used to confirm the hypothesis that obesity (OBE) played\nthe initiating role and was sequentially followed by inflammation\n(INF), insulin resistance (IR), and then dyslipidemia (DYSLIPID).\nHypertension (HTN) could be directly associated with OBE or related\nto OBE through the intermediation of INF or IR. The model depicted\na biological pathway from OBE to INF, from INF to IR, and then from\nIR to DYSLIPID. On the other hand, OBE, INF, and IR could associate\nwith HTN directly. Potential confounding factors, including sex, age,\nand smoking status were adjusted by controlling their effects on the five\nlatent variables (OBE, HTN, INF, IR, and DYSLIPID) (Figure 1a).\nThe latent variable OBE loaded on both BMI (\n) and waist circum-\nference (WC, \n), indicating that an increased waist size might provide\nadditional information for defining obesity. Inflammation (INF) could\nbe solely represented by serum CRP level (CRP, \n). Insulin resistance\n(IR) loaded on insulin level (INSULIN, \n) and the homeostatic model\nassessment (HOMA, \n). Fasting glucose level was not used because it\nwas already a part of calculation of HOMA. Dyslipidemia (DYSLIPID)\nwas represented as serum levels of TG (\n), LDL (\n), and HDL (\n).\nHypertension (HTN) loaded on both SBP (\n) and DBP (\n). Each\nlatent variable might be interpreted as a linear combination of manifest\nvariables of relative significance. Loading factors ( s) are allowed to have\nvalues >1 after correlation adjustment.\nThe correlation matrix between the manifest variables (BMI, waist\ncircumference, CRP, INSULIN, HOMA, TG, LDL, HDL, SBP, DBP, AGE,\nSEX, and SMOKING) was calculated with the execution of a SIMPLIS\ncode on a pair-wise basis. Pearson correlation, polyserial correlation,\nand polychoric correlation were used for two continuous variables,\nBMI\nOBE\nINF\nIR\nOBE\nINF\nIR\nAge, sex, smoking\nAge, sex, smoking\nDYSLIPID\nDYSLIPID\nHTN\nHTN\nWC\nCRP\nINSULIN\nHOMA\nBMI\nWC\nCRP\nINSULIN\nHOMA\nSBP\nDBP\nTG\nLDL\nHDL\nSBP\nDBP\nTG\nLDL\nHDL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) A structural equation model shows the relationship among\nobesity (OBE), inflammation (INF), insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia\n(DYSLIPID), and hypertension (HTN).

The links between any two latent variables were\nremoved when the regression coefficients did not reach statistical signifi-\ncance (P > 0.05). The model was repeated stepwise until all the links were\nsignificant. Another iteration process began and set the errors between\nany two manifest variables correlated rather than independent if statistical\nsignificance was found. The correlation specification between error terms\nwas iterated until the goodness-of-fit index was >0.90, the non-normed\nfit index was >0.90, and the root mean square error of approximation was\n0.05. The regression coefficients between latent variables (B), the loading\nfactors from the latent variables onto the manifest variables (), model\nfitness, and the residual correlation matrix were reported.\nResults\nDemography\nA total of 3,596 whites were included for following analysis. No\nsubject was further excluded on a list-wise basis due to incom-\nmeasurements and the laboratory results were shown in Table 1.\nData completion rate ranged from 29 (LDL) to 87% (CRP). Men\nhad significantly higher serum insulin, higher fasting glucose, but\nlower CRP levels compared with those of women. BMI, waist, BP,\nand lipid profiles were not different between men and women.\nThe prevalence of abnormal metabolic components and MS were\nsummarized in Table 1. Based on ATP III (2001) criteria, a higher\nproportion of women had central obesity, whereas a higher pro-\nportion of men reached the definition of elevated BP and glucose\nintolerance. The crude prevalence of MS was 21.5 and 20.5% for\nmen and women, respectively.\nSEM\nThe results of the complex interactions between the main com-\nponents of MS were conceptualized in Figure 1b.

Many reports have linked\ninflammatory response to the development of insulin resist-\nance (15,16). Also, inflammatory cell infiltration within adi-\npose tissue may be involved in altering adipocyte lipid and\ncytokine production, which may in turn have downstream\neffects on other metabolically important tissues (17).\nIn addition, there is a positive direct association between\nincreased body component and elevated BP. Arterial hyper-\ntension in obesity is thought to be related to high circulating\nvolume (18), reduced bioavailability and lower production of\nnitric oxide, increased vascular tone (19), upregulated sympa-\nthetic tone (20), and increased expression of angiotensinogen\nby adipose tissue (21). The SEM analysis here is not sensitive\nto the possibility that insulin resistance and BP are interrelated\nthrough a mechanism other than obesity (9). Development of\nhypertension has been linked to chronic low-grade inflam-\nmation, but it is not clear whether the connection is direct or\nmediated by features of MS (22). In a Dutch study aiming to\ninvestigate the relationship between CRP and MS components,\nthe association between CRP and BP was weak and not statisti-\ncally significant after careful stratification by overweight status\n(23). Our model has suggested that the relationship between\nhigh BP and insulin resistance/inflammation could be attrib-\nuted to sharable common causes, i.e., obesity.\nTable 2 Parameter estimates, model fitness, and residual correlation matrix of the structural equation model\nParameters Estimates Meaning\nRegression coefficients\n B\n0.05*** Positive link from OBE to INF\n B\n0.32*** Positive link from INF to IR\n B\n0.06*** Positive link from IR to DYSLIPID\n B\n0.51*** Positive link from OBE to HTN\nFactor loadings\n \n0.54a Positive loading from OBE to BMI\n \n1.66*** Positive loading from OBE to WC\n \n1.05a Positive loading from INF to CRP\n \n0.82a Positive loading from IR to INSULIN\n \n1.12*** Positive loading from IR to HOMA\n \n0.38a Positive loading from DYSLIPID to TG\n \n0.80*** Positive loading from DYSLIPID to LDL\n \n-0.14*** Negative loading from DYSLIPID to HDL\n \n1.46a Positive loading from HTN to SBP\n \n0.21*** Positive loading from HTN to DBP\nModel fitness\nResidual correlations BMI Waist CRP Insulin HOMA TG LDL HDL SBP DBP\n BMI --\n Waist 0 --\nGFI, goodness-of-fit index; NNFI, non-normed fit index; RMSEA, root mean square error of approximation.\naIndicates an anchoring factor that gives the latent variable an interpretable value.

Although the essence of SEM is to verify\na model based upon cross-sectional data, a precise causal rela-\ntionship should be relied on further prospective studies. In\naddition, the good fit in our model does not rule out other\nequally good fit by another model consistent with a different\nhypothesis. For example, clear evidence also shows that glu-\ncose challenge and increased free fatty acids could increase\ninflammatory response (24\u00ad26). Although it is confirmatory\nthat obesity leads to a chronic inflammatory state that inter-\nferes with metabolic signal transduction, the reverse could\nalso apply where aberrant metabolic control and inflamma-\ntory consequences accelerate obesity. We did try to modify\nour model by switching the sequence between OBE, INF, and\nIR. However, the SEM did not obtain a convergence in param-\neter estimation, indicating a lack of confirmation that insulin\nresistance precedes inflammation or obesity in the NHANES\ndata set.\nDue to plenty of missing data in the lipid profiles of other\nethnic groups, only the white adults were included for analysis.\nHowever, the authors later applied the same model to the met-\nabolic profiles in a group of Taiwanese obese population and\ncross-validated the model.
