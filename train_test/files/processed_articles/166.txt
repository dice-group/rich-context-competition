Markides, PhD3\nThe population of the United States, like that of\nmost other nations of the world, will age rapidly well\ninto the twenty-first century. The consequences of\nthis population aging have been debated in numer-\nous arenas, most recently in conjunction with the\ngrowing cost of medical and long-term care of the\nelderly (Mendelson & Schwartz, 1993; Newhouse,\n1993). It is clear that we are entering a new era in\nhuman history in which aging populations present\nunique problems to both developed and developing\nnations. For the most part, scholarly debate over the\neffect of aging populations has focused on the con-\nsequences of the relative size of the older population\non aggregate spending for social welfare (World\nBank, 1994). Clearly, the fact that both the number of\nolder individuals and the proportion of the popula-\ntion they represent is rapidly increasing has impor-\ntant implications for all aspects of social policy. Yet\nthe relative size of the older population is not the\nonly, and perhaps not even the most important,\nfactor that will affect social policy relating to long-\n1 An earlier version of this study was presented at the Population Associa-\ntion of America Meeting, San Francisco, CA, April 7,1995.

As impor-\ntant as the size of the elderly population is for policy\nplanners, the consequences of the increasing racial\nand ethnic heterogeneity among the population over\n65 may be even more important.\nBecause of higher fertility and differential immigra-\ntion patterns among certain groups, an ever larger\nfraction of the older population consists of individ-\nuals who are members of racial and ethnic minority\ngroups (Angel & Hogan, 1992). The long-term medi-\ncal care needs and preferences in living arrange-\nments of these subgroups of the elderly population\nmay differ significantly from those of the majority\ncare policies that are based on the assumption that\nthe elderly are homogeneous in terms of their health\ncare needs and preferences in living arrangements\nare very likely to be plagued by inefficiency (Wil-\nliams, 1994). In this article, we argue that in order to\ndevelop long-term care options that optimize the\nquality of life among older individuals in a politically\nrealistic and cost-effective manner, we must first un-\nderstand the needs and preferences of specific sub-\ngroups. In the present case, we look at older Mexican\nAmericans. A major focus of the study is to examine\nthe extent to which culturally conditioned norms\nconcerning children's obligations to care for their\naging parents explain the well documented tendency\nfor older Mexican Americans to remain in the com-\nmunity and not to enter nursing homes (Burr, 1990;\nEribes & Bradley-Rawls, 1978; Espino, Neufeld, Mulvi-\nThe Growing Cost of Long-term Care\nSince 1965, when Medicare was introduced, the\nrate in the growth of expenditures for medical care\nunder that program has increased dramatically\n(Feder, Rowland, Holahan, Salganicoff, & Heslam,\n1993). In addition, Medicaid expenditures for hospi-\ntal and physician services and long-term care for the\nelderly have grown at an ever-increasing rate in re-\ncent years (Rowland, Feder, Lyons, & Salganicoff,\nvides coverage to only one third of the older popula-\ntion in poverty (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). Those not\ncovered by Medicaid must rely on Medicare alone,\nmanaging somehow to cover the premiums, deducti-\nbles, and copayments out of current income, or they\nmust do without services. Providing supplemental\ncoverage to all poor elderly Americans, either\nthrough Medicaid or some other program, will add\ngreatly to aggregate health care costs and divert\nmoney from other uses. For the foreseeable future,\ntherefore, the forces propelling the growth in health\ncare costs, including advances in technology and\nan aging population, will make it difficult, and per-\nhaps impossible, to contain the growth in health\ncare expenditures (Mendelson & Schwartz, 1993;\nIn the context of an aging population with an ever\ngreater need for hospital and home health care ser-\nvices, the containment of the growth in expenditures\nfor the care of older individuals will require innova-\ntions that maximize the use of less expensive commu-\nnity mechanisms of support (Bass & Noelker, 1987).\nNumerous experiments in home- and community-\nbased care have been tried and will no doubt form a\ncentral part of any innovations in long-term care for\nthe elderly (Rivlin & Weiner, 1988; Rowland & Lyons,\nInitial hopes were that community-based care would\nbe less expensive than institutionalization, but the\nevidence indicates that this is not necessarily the case\nVertrees, Manton, & Adler, 1989; Weiner & Hanley,\n1992). Because of the large number of individuals in\nthe community who might benefit from community\nservices but who do not receive them, providing such\nservices could increase use among these individuals\nand result in higher program costs (Hanley, Weiner, &\nHarris, 1991). Nonetheless, in light of the continuing\ngrowth in health care costs, especially those associ-\nated with long-term care, community-based pro-\ngrams continue to hold great potential for the support\nof individuals with intermediate levels of need.\nIt is clear that the family shoulders the greatest\nburden in caring for infirm older individuals, espe-\ncially among minority elderly persons (Brody, 1985;\nthey suffer from fairly serious disabilities, older indi-\nviduals prefer to live alone or in the community\nrather than enter a nursing home (McDowell,\nAlthough many receive some form of home health\ncare, many others simply do without care or rely\nmainly on the assistance of family members (Soldo,\nWolf, & Agree, 1990; Wallace, Levy-Storms, & Fergu-\nson, 1995). Many programs for assisting the family by\nproviding support to elderly parents in the commu-\nnity have been proposed in recent years and it is\nlikely that in the future such proposals and programs\nHorwitz & Shindelman, 1983). Due to the aging of\nthe baby boom generation, it is imperative that we\ndetermine how such informal mechanisms of sup-\nport might be augmented, rather than replaced, by\nformal sources (Brody, Poulshock, & Masciocchi,\nMost long-term care policy proposals are based on\nthe assumption that the elderly population is homo-\ngeneous in its needs (e.g., Ladd, 1995). Fernando\nTorres-Gil, who is currently the Assistant Secretary\nfor the Department of Health and Human Services\nAdministration on Aging, notes that, while \"Long-\nterm care programs and benefits generally rely on\nage and/or functional ability as the criteria for receiv-\ning services and assume the aged population is ho-\nmogeneous . . . it is clear that the minority elderly\npopulation is increasing and their cultural, social,\nand linguistic uniqueness will require that more than\nage and functional ability be considered in the devel-\ngrowing cultural heterogeneity among the elderly\npopulation will influence personal and family prefer-\nences in living arrangements and affect the long-\nterm care needs of different segments of the older\nAlthough most individuals prefer to live in the com-\nmunity as long as possible, one's ability to do so, and\nthe quality of one's life in the community, are affected\nby numerous factors. One's family situation and liv-\ning arrangements determine the number of individ-\nuals available to help with basic physical activities of\ndaily living, such as dressing and bathing, as well as\nwith more complex instrumental tasks, such as shop-\nping and handling finances (Litwak, 1985). Racial and\nethnic groups differ significantly in living arrange-\nments and family size, factors that influence the avail-\nability of informal support (Angel & Angel, 1992).\nIn addition, there is mounting evidence that cul-\ntural factors influence the role of the family in the\ncare of elderly individuals, thereby affecting the\noverall assistance package that elderly individuals\ntempts to develop a rational system of managed care\nfor the elderly must be informed by a better under-\nstanding of the total package of pathology different\ngroups of elderly individuals experience, as well as\nan understanding of the ways in which cultural, eco-\nnomic, and health care system factors influence the\nextent of need for long-term care and specific home\nhealth care services.\nThe Mexican American Elderly and Family Support\nMama Elena, you know perfectly well that being the\nyoungest daughter means you have to take care of me\nuntil the day I die. ... but in my opinion, you don't\nhave an opinion, and that's all I want to hear about it.\nFor generations, not a single person in my family has\never questioned this tradition, and no daughter of\nmine is going to be the one to start. . . (Laura Esquivel,\nThe Mexican American population, like all other\ncultural groups, is unique in ways that can potentially\naffect the health and welfare of its elderly members.\nBecause of high fertility and historically high levels of\nboth legal and illegal immigration, the Mexican\nAmerican population is among the fastest growing\nminority groups in the United States (Bean & Tienda,\n1987). Mexican Americans are also on average youn-\nger than blacks or non-Hispanic whites. Yet, like the\npopulation at large, Mexican Americans have experi-\nenced decreases in mortality from both acute and\nchronic diseases and, consequently, the number of\nMexican Americans over the age of 65 is growing\nrapidly. By the year 2010, the number of Hispanics in\nthe United States over the age of 65, of whom Mexi-\ncan Americans are the largest group, is projected to\nincrease by approximately two and a half times (An-\ngel & Hogan, 1992). Like their non-Hispanic white\ncounterparts, older Mexican Americans will be living\nlonger and will suffer from the chronic illnesses that\naccompany aging. This fact means that the cost of\ncaring for older infirm Mexican Americans will inevi-\nAlthough Mexican American fertility rates have\ndropped along with those of the rest of the popula-\ntion, the Mexican American population continues to\nhave larger-than-average families. Furthermore,\nthere is evidence to suggest that a traditional orienta-\ntion may instill in both parents and children alike a\ndesire for greater contact and expectations that chil-\ndren should be responsible for aging parents (Sub-\ncommittee on Aging, 1994). In what follows, we ex-\namine patterns in living arrangements and, for those\nwho live with their children, their reasons for doing\nso. The data suggest that for older Mexican Ameri-\ncans, living with children is still a desirable and viable\noption. We also examine responses to the question\nof where an older individual would care to live in the\nevent of incapacity. Our ultimate objective is to get at\nleast a rudimentary idea of the long-term health care\nneeds and desires of the older Mexican American\npopulation. Up until now, those desires have been\npurely a matter of specification or have been as-\nsumed to be identical to those of other groups.\nTraditional portrayals of the Mexican-origin family\nconvey the image of a multigenerational household\ngoverned by norms of mutual assistance and primary\nreliance on the family (Cratton, 1987; Griswold del\nCastillo, 1984). Indeed, a highly familistic orientation\namong Mexican Americans has been documented by\ndemographers, ethnographers, and sociologists (Be-\nservers find that, on average, Mexican Americans do\nindeed have more cohesive family support systems\nthan non-Hispanics (e.g., Angel & Angel, 1992; Be-\n1981). Yet, everyone is affected by social and eco-\nnomic change, and it is clear that for older Mexican\nAmericans, the decision to live alone, to live with\nfamily, or to enter a nursing home is influenced by a\ncomplex set of objective factors, as well as by one's\nattitudes and life experiences (Weeks & Cuellar, 1981 ;\nWilliams, 1990). As among non-Hispanics, many\nMexican American adult children are unable to pro-\nvide either financial or instrumental aid to their aging\nand infirm relatives (Grebler, Moore, & Guzman,\ntance, low income, and inadequate housing make it\ndifficult for the family to play the role it may have\nplayed in previous years.\nThe family, though, continues to offer great possi-\nbilities for the care of the elderly. Recent evidence\nfrom the Canadian Survey of Aging indicates that\nelderly parents would like to live with their children if\nthey could feel certain that they would be welcome\n(Connidis, 1983). Many researchers have suggested\nthat extended households may represent a response\nto poverty and provide the possibility of mutual aid\nand assistance among family members. In some\ncases, living with relatives may be a realistic substi-\ntute for formal care (Angel & Tienda, 1982; Kane &\nfamilies tend to live near relatives and close friends,\nhave frequent interactions with family members, and\nexchange a wide range of goods and services that\ninclude babysitting, temporary housing, personal\nadvice, nursing during times of illness, and emo-\ntional support (Muller & Espenshade, 1985).\nMethod\nIn the following analyses, we employ data from the\nHispanic Established Population for Epidemiological\nStudies of the Elderly (H-EPESE), a large, multistage\nprobability sample of Mexican Americans 65 and\nolder who reside in the southwestern states of Texas,\nCalifornia, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado\n(Markides, Rudkin, Angel, & Espino, in press). The\npresent analysis is based on the first wave of the\nstudy, which consists of a survey of 3,050 individuals.\nThe overall response rate for the respondents is 86%.\nAll subjects were interviewed in their home for ap-\nproximately two hours by trained interviewers who\nassessed the respondent's functional capacity and\ncollected information on nativity status, demograph-\nics, household structure, and socioeconomic status.\nIn the following analyses, we employ variables that\ncapture aspects of economic and structural con-\nstraints on choices in living arrangements. For those\nindividuals who were too cognitively or physically\ndebilitated to participate in the study, information on\nobjective questions was obtained from a proxy famil-\niar with the subject. Ten percent of the completed\ninterviews were with proxy respondents. These cases\nare dropped from analyses in which subjective infor-\nmation is employed.\nMeasures and Analyses. -- In the first stage of the\nanalysis, we present descriptive statistics to show the\nassociation between living arrangements, prefer-\nences in long-term care arrangements, and func-\ntional disability among native and foreign-born el-\nderly men and women. In order to characterize their\nliving arrangements, we employ a detailed typology\nof living arrangements with eight categories based\non household size, marital status of the respondent,\nand the relationship of the respondent to the head of\nthe household. For married individuals, the living\narrangements we examine include (1) those who live\nonly with their spouse; (2) those who live with\nothers, but in a situation in which neither of the older\ncouple is the head of household; and (3) those who\nlive with others in a situation in which the older\ncouple is the head of the household. Among the\nunmarried, we compare the living arrangements of\n(4) unmarried individuals living alone to those who\nlive with others in four different arrangements based\non sex and household headship status, (5) unmarried\nwomen heading their own household, (6) unmarried\nwomen living with someone else who is the head of\nthe household, (7) unmarried men heading their\nown household, and (8) unmarried men living with\nsomeone else who is the head of the household.\nWe assess functional limitations using three\nstandard scales that tap separate dimensions of dis-\nability. Two scales tap dimensions of physical dis-\nability, and the third assesses problems with more\ncomplex daily social activities. The first physical dis-\nability scale measures an individual's capacity to\nperform basic physical activities of daily living\n(PADLs) without help, and includes questions con-\ncerning bathing or showering, dressing, personal\ngrooming, eating, transferring (getting in and out of\nchair), walking across a room, getting outside, and\nusing the toilet. The second physical functioning\nscale (ROSOW) is a modified version of the Rosow-\nBreslau scale and includes three questions on gross\nmobility, whether the respondent needs help with\nheavy housework, walking up and'down stairs or to\na second floor, and walking half a mile (Rosow &\nBreslau, 1966). The third scale measures problems\nassociated with social activities of daily living\n(SADLs), and includes questions concerning diffi-\nculty performing routine household chores, using a\ntelephone, shopping for groceries, driving an auto-\nmobile or traveling alone on public transportation,\ndoing light housework, taking medicine, preparing\nmeals, and handling money.\nResults\nTable 1 contrasts the native-born to the foreign-\nborn on the basis of the eight arrangements listed\nabove. What emerges is a clear picture of a greater\nfamilial orientation among the foreign-born. Fewer of\nthe married foreign-born than the native-born live\nwith only their spouse (living arrangement 1), and\nalthough only a small fraction of married couples live\nwith someone else in a situation in which they are not\nthe heads of the household, a larger fraction of those\nTable 1.

In a\nmajority of these cases, the head of household is an\nadult child. Among unmarried females, a smaller frac-\ntion of the foreign-born are heads of household and a\nlarger fraction live with someone else, again usually\nan adult child. Although relatively few single males\nlive with someone else when they are not the head of\nhousehold, a larger fraction of those who do are\nforeign-born. These data, therefore, suggest that the\nforeign-born elderly are more likely to live with their\nchildren than are the native-born.\nTable 2 contrasts the native-born to the foreign-\nborn in terms of sociodemographic characteristics,\nhealth, and disability. The data reveal a profile that is\nconsistent with the lesser degree of structural and\neconomic assimilation that is typical of recent immi-\ngrants. The foreign-born live in larger households\nand have less education and lower household and\npersonal incomes than the native-born. In addition,\nthe table reveals that foreign-born elderly individuals\nare more likely than their native-born counterparts\nto report problems with mobility and instrumental\n(social) activities of daily living (Rosow and SADL).\nThe greater difficulty with social functioning among\nforeign-born individuals is accounted for largely by\nthe problems they encounter with driving or obtain-\ning transportation, areas in which the foreign-born\nare clearly handicapped. These data indicate, there-\nfore, that the foreign-born are at a clear socioeco-\nnomic disadvantage and are handicapped in terms of\ntheir ability to get around. These disadvantages al-\nmost certainly increase their reliance on family.\nThere has been a great deal of speculation as to\nwhat accounts for the tendency of older Mexican\nAmericans to live with their children. Our data allow\nus to go beyond speculation and examine responses\nto questions concerning preferences in current liv-\ning arrangements and where one would care to live\nin the event of seriously diminished health. The first\nresponse we examined was one to a question con-\ncerning why those older individuals who live with\ntheir children choose to do so. The responses to this\nquestion for married and unmarried native-born and\nforeign-born respondents are presented in Table 3,\nseparately for men and women. A respondent could\nhave chosen more than one reason, so the propor-\ntions do not add to 100%, therefore we do not\npresent tests of significance. This table reveals that a\nTable 2.

Differences between\nnative and foreign born.\nlarger proportion of foreign-born than native-born\nmen and women who live with their children say that\nthey live with them because both parties want it that\nway. Again, this difference between the native- and\nthe foreign-born reveals a more traditional orienta-\ntion toward the family and the duties of children to\naging parents among the foreign-born.\nThe data also show that a larger fraction of foreign-\nborn than native-born men and women live with\ntheir children because the parents provide their\nadult children with financial or child care assistance.\nOn the other hand, a significantly smaller fraction of\nforeign-born than native-born men and women re-\nport that they live with children, or rather that their\nchildren live with them, because they are the head of\nrespectively). These data suggest, therefore, that\namong the foreign-born, it is more often the case\nthat parents move in with their children than that\nchildren move in with their parents.\nIn order to extend this analysis, we examined re-\nsponses to a question that asked respondents\nwhether they were satisfied with their current living\narrangement and if not, where they would prefer to\nlive. The most striking finding was that only 115\nindividuals indicated that they were unsatisfied with\ntheir present living arrangement and would prefer to\nlive somewhere else (data not shown). An additional\n36 respondents stated that they would prefer to live\nsomewhere else but did not specify where that might\nbe. Of course, a question of this sort cannot elicit\nsubtle dissatisfactions with current living arrange-\nments and, we suspect, most people normalize their\nsituation if, in fact, some other arrangement is unre-\nalistic. Nonetheless, the answers to this question\nsuggest that most individuals are quite satisfied with\ntheir current living arrangements.\nIn Table 4, we examine another facet of the issue\nand present data on where the older respondent\nwould care to live in the event that he or she could no\nlonger take care of him- or herself. Nearly 20% of\nforeign-born in comparison to 13% of native-born\nMexican American couples who are currently living\nonly with their spouse state that they would want to\nlive with their children in the event that they could\nno longer take care of themselves. On the other\nhand, native-born elderly individuals who are living\nTable 3.

Regardless of their current living\narrangement, then, these data indicate that in con-\ntrast to the native-born, foreign-born older persons\nexpect to live with their children in the event of\nincapacity.\nOur objective so far has been to shed some light on\nthe reasons that certain older Mexican-origin indi-\nviduals choose to live with their children. The data so\nfar appear to suggest that it is because the older\nperson, at least, wants it that way. Of course, such a\nresponse may mask some other reason, such as pov-\nerty or poor health, on the part of the elderly person.\nAn individual who is living with his or her child be-\ncause he or she cannot afford to live alone or because\nhe or she is physically unable to care for himself or\nherself may well normalize the situation and report\nsatisfaction with a situation that is really made neces-\nsary by other factors. In order to get some idea as to\nthe extent to which this phenomenon occurs, in Table\n5 we compare our three functional status measures\namong individuals who state various reasons for liv-\ning with their children. (Recall that an individual\ncould have given more than one reason, so he or she\nTable 4.

Yet,\ninterestingly, a substantial fraction of those who cite\ndesire as a reason for living with children also suffer\nfrom functional limitations and poor health, as do\nthose who state some other reason. These data at\nleast suggest that among Mexican American elders,\nliving with one's child is a culturally legitimate way of\ncoping with poor health. Among older Mexican\nAmericans who state that they want to live with\nfamily, culturally based values may interact with ne-\ncessity to determine living arrangements.\nOur next and final step in the analysis is to examine\nliving arrangements in a multivariate framework in\norder to determine whether other demographic fac-\ntors, either economic need or health, are significant\ndeterminants of living arrangements for the native\nand foreign born. In Table 6, we present four logistic\nregression models that assess the impact of house-\nhold economic status and an older person's func-\ntional status on the probability of extended living\narrangements for both the native and foreign born. In\nModel 1 (columns one and two), we predict the likeli-\nhood of living alone versus the probability of living\nwith others among native- and foreign-born unmar-\nried individuals. Model 2 focuses on native- and\nforeign-born married individuals and assesses the\nprobability of living with only one's spouse as op-\nposed to living with one's spouse and children. In\nthese models, we control for various socioeconomic\nand other risk factors, including age, sex, education,\nhousehold income, and the functional status varia-\nbles. These models also include a global health rating.\nModel 1 reveals no clear independent effect of\ndisability, i.e., PADLs or mobility (Rosow), on the\nprobability that a single person lives alone or with\nothers. In contrast, this model reveals that low in-\ncome is associated with an increased probability of\nliving alone, regardless of nativity status. Almost by\ndefinition, those who live alone have lower house-\nhold incomes than those who live with others. Joint\nliving arrangements, therefore, serve to increase an\nolder person's economic status. Model 2, which fo-\ncuses on married individuals, reveals that for both\nthe native and foreign born, those individuals who\nlive with their spouse only have lower family incomes\nthan those who live with their spouse and others.\nAgain, as in the case of single individuals, net of\nincome and functional status measures have no sta-\ntistically significant effect on the probability of living\nwith others. For both single individuals and couples,\ntherefore, living with children increases overall eco-\nnomic welfare. It also appears that functional inca-\npacity is not an overriding factor in determining\nextended living arrangements among older Mexican\nAmericans. However, as these data and previous\nstudies show, it is clear that for older persons, health\nand economic need are interrelated (see Burr &\nDiscussion\nIf behavior is an indicator of preference, most older\npeople prefer to live with their spouse while he or she\nis alive and alone or with family members after the\nspouse dies. Our data also show that in the event of\nincapacity, many older Mexican Americans, and espe-\ncially the more traditionally oriented, foreign-born\namong them, living with their children is a desirable\nalternative. Only a minority of our respondents ex-\npressed the desire to enter a nursing home in the\nevent of incapacity, although among those who live\nalone, approximately one third stated that they would\nchoose a nursing home in the event of incapacity,\nperhaps reflecting the lack of an alternative.\nFuture long-term care policy should make use of\nthese potential family resources and optimize the\nfamily's options for the care of their infirm elderly\nparents. We certainly do not advocate forcing older\nparents onto unwilling children. Rather, we advocate\nthe effective use of culturally based options that\nincrease the choices available to elderly men and\nwomen and their families. Such options would in-\nvolve formal systems that complement, rather than\nreplace, the family as the main source of long-term\ncare for older persons. If the objective of long-term\ncare policy is to optimize well-being while containing\ncosts, we must take individual and family prefer-\nences into account (Wiener, Hanley, & Illston, 1992).\nOur data suggest that a more traditional cultural\norientation, measured in terms of nativity, is associ-\nated with a greater reliance on family, and perhaps\nwith norms and values that dictate that older parents\nshould rely on their children for instrumental if not\nnecessarily financial assistance. The data also suggest\nthat among native-born individuals, these norms and\nvalues may be weakened, although they do not dis-\nappear. As among other groups, the family remains\nthe main source of instrumental support for older\nMexican Americans, and policies that weaken the\ncommitment of one generation to the next should be\navoided.\nEven for groups such as Mexican Americans who\nhave traditionally been portrayed as familistic,\nthough, social change and cultural and structural\nassimilation take their toll on family life. For Mexican\nAmericans, as for everyone else, economic con-\nstraints limit options in living arrangements, and the\nnecessity for women to work limits their availability\nas full-time caregivers for older parents. It is also\nclear that the motivations for extended living ar-\nrangements are complex and that the needs and\ndesires of everyone involved play a role. In our\nsample, a significant number of older Mexican Amer-\nicans took their children into their households be-\ncause of the children's needs. In 1982, Angel and\nTienda posed the question as to whether extended\nliving arrangements represent a response to poverty\nor whether they reflect a cultural orientation. They\nconcluded that both sets of factors play a role. These\nnewer data suggest that this is still the case among\nthe elderly and their families.\nOur findings carry certain implications for public\nTable 6.

The\nobjective of such policy is to provide the highest\nquality health care and community support at a rea-\nsonable cost (National Academy on Aging, 1994).\nIdeally, we wish to allow people to remain in their\nhomes and in the community for as long as they are\nable. Institutionalization is an option of last resort,\nand one which most individuals and families resist\nuntil there is no longer a choice. If it were possible to\nmaintain even a fraction of the elderly in the commu-\nnity for longer periods at a reasonable cost, the\npayoff in terms of quality of life alone might well be\nworth the expense. In order to reach this objective,\nhowever, a better understanding of the family and\nliving situations of the elderly, as well as their prefer-\nences, is necessary. We must also begin to identify\nthe health resource needs of local communities if we\nas a society are to help provide effective services to\nthe elderly.\nThe optimal use of culturally specific family and\ncommunity resources for the care of the elderly may\nin the future become a central goal of health care\nareas, especially those currently lacking basic pri-\nmary care and mental health services, the barriers\nthat impede the introduction of more efficient health\ncare delivery and formal support systems will be\nformidable (Yeatts, Crow, & Folts, 1992). Although\nefficient mechanisms for financing and organizing\nhealth care delivery to underserved areas have not\nyet been fully developed, there is reason for at least\nmodest optimism that such mechanisms can be de-\nveloped. Although we have no hard data, there is\nenough anecdotal experience with outreach pro-\ngrams that make use of nurse practitioners and other\nhealth care professionals, as well as primary care\nphysicians who are familiar with the culture of the\nclientele they serve, to suggest useful avenues to\npursue in developing effective health care delivery\nsystems. Many of these involve the patient's family.\nProviding care to poor older individuals in urban\nareas presents us with an entirely different set of\nissues. The availability of kin and formal community\nsupport mechanisms differs greatly between the in-\nner city and more rural areas. In recent years, we\nhave become increasingly aware of the role of the\nfamily in the care of the chronically ill, whether they\nbe the chronically physically ill, the severely and\npersistently mentally ill, or the infirm elderly. Given\nthe economic and social stresses that many families\nmust endure, their commitment to care for needy\nfamily members is admirable and should be aug-\nmented by formal services designed to ease the bur-\nden of care and to improve the quality of life for all\ninvolved. The accomplishment of this goal will re-\nquire a much more sophisticated understanding of\nthe potential role of families and the constraints that\nthey face in the care of their elderly members.\nReferences\nAngel, J.
