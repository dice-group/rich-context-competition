Ford and Richard S. Cooper\nHypertension continues to be a major public health problem in the United States. We used data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Study\nhypertension at the baseline examination. The follow-up period averaged 10 years. Body mass\nindex was positively related to the probability of hypertension developing among white men\nwas inversely associated with the probability of hypertension developing among white women\nand was of borderline significance among white men and black women. In a subanalysis of\nquestionnaire, dietary consumption of sodium, calcium, and potassium did not predict the\ndevelopment of hypertension. The failure of our study to support findings relating intake of\ndietary cations to the development of hypertension may be attributable to imprecision in the\nmeasurement of dietary data and misclassification of hypertension status. These data reinforce\nthe importance of weight control in the primary prevention of hypertension. (Hypertension\nHypertension is a major public health problem\nAmericans estimated to have the disease.1\nDespite extensive research into the etiology and\ncontributing causes of essential hypertension, the\npathogenesis of the condition is still not explained.\nNonpharmacological approaches to the treatment of\nhypertension have included a reduction of salt intake\nand increases in dietary potassium and calcium con-\nsumption, weight loss, and increased physical activity.\nAlthough the small reductions in blood pressure\nfrom these nonpharmacological measures could the-\noretically have important beneficial public health\nconsequences,2 it has not been shown that these\napproaches can serve as primary measures to retard\nor prevent the onset of hypertension in the general\npopulation.\nMost of the available data have come from cross-\nsectional and experimental studies. However, determi-\nnants of blood pressure have been examined in few\nprospective studies. We studied the relations of several\nsociodemographic, behavioral, and biochemical param-\neters on the incidence of hypertension among a group\nFrom the Division of Diabetes Translation, Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease\nControl, Atlanta, Ga., and the Department of Preventive Medicine\nand Epidemiology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, 111.\nAddress for correspondence: Earl Ford, MD, MPH, Division of\nDiabetes Translation, Centers for Disease Control, 1600 Clifton\nof participants followed from the first National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I),\nMethods\n25-74 years participated in the NHANES I study.\nThe plans and operations for the NHANES I and\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study have\npants who were 25-74 years old at baseline and\nAmong the participants, a more detailed examination\nwas performed on 6,913 persons. These included\na random sample of participants examined from 1971\nthrough 1974. Survivors and proxy respondents for\ndeceased participants and participants incapable of\nresponding were interviewed, and blood pressure\nmeasurements were obtained from survivors. Mean\nfollow-up time was 10 years for traced participants\nstill alive, with a range of 5-12 years. The study and\nthe confidentiality of the data from the study were\nthoroughly discussed with the participants. By agree-\ning to participate in the study, participants gave\nimplied consent.\nBy design, various subgroups of the final sample\ncompleted different study components and question-\nnaires. A detailed medical examination was per-\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nFord and Cooper Risk Factors for Hypertension 599\npersons from the augmentation survey that was con-\nwell as 3,854 randomly sampled persons from partic-\ninformation is available for each respondent. For\nexample, dietary data were available only for 11,348\nparticipants, serum calcium data for 6,913 partici-\npants, and serum potassium and sodium data for\n3,059 participants, whereas serum magnesium data\nwere available for all participants.\nAt the baseline examination, a single blood pres-\nsure measurement was obtained in accordance with\nAmerican Heart Association criteria.9 We defined\nhypertension at baseline as a systolic blood pressure\n(SBP) of greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg, a\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or\nequal to 95 mm Hg, or using antihypertensive medi-\ncation. The latter factor was determined at the\nbaseline examination, when all participants between\nthe ages of 12 and 74 years were asked, \"During the\npast 6 months, have you used any medicine, drugs, or\npills for high blood pressure?\" Participants who\nresponded that they regularly or occasionally used\nantihypertensive medications were eliminated from\nthe analysis, as were participants with missing infor-\nmation that precluded the establishment of hyperten-\nsive status. For participants receiving the more de-\ntailed examination, the wording of the follow-up\nquestionnaire differed from the original question-\nnaire. First, respondents were asked if they had ever\nbeen told by a doctor that they had hypertension or\nhigh blood pressure. Those who responded affirma-\ntively were then asked, \"Has a doctor ever prescribed\nmedicine for your (high blood pressure/hyperten-\nsion)?\" Those who responded affirmatively to this\nquestion and replied to a subsequent question that\nthey used antihypertensive medication all the time,\noften, or once in a while, were classified as hyperten-\nsive and excluded from the analysis.\nAt the follow-up examination between 1980 and\n1982, three blood pressure measurements were ob-\ntained from each living participant where this was\npossible. The average SBP and DBP data from the\nlast two readings were used to determine hyperten-\nsive status. The same definition (SBP ^160 mm Hg,\nDBP s95 mm Hg, or the use of antihypertensive\nmedications) classified participants as hypertensive.\nIndependent variables were age, income, educa-\ntion, leisure-time physical activity, non-leisure-time\nphysical activity, body mass index, blood cholesterol\nlevel, resting pulse rate, alcohol use, and serum\nmagnesium level. For the dietary subanalysis, dietary\nintakes of sodium, potassium, and calcium and total\nnumber of calories were examined. The continuous\nvariables of age, income, education, body mass index,\nand alcohol use were divided into discrete categories,\nas shown in Table 1. Body mass index was divided\ninto three categories. Normal weight was defined as\nfor women. Obesity was defined as 27.8 to less than\nScxnm\nTotal Diet catfom\nDelete raca other than white or black\nDelete km to foDowup\nDelete penon wtm hypcrteuioo\natt\nDdete reconb with r'f'Hiig data\nFIGURE 1. Sample sizes available for analysis after various\ndeletions, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nfor women. Severe obesity was defined as 31.1 kg/m2\nor greater for men and 32.3 kg/m2 or greater for\nwomen.10 Alcohol use was calculated as the number\nof drinks of alcohol consumed per day. This variable\nwas categorized as less than 1 drink/day, 1-2 drinks/\nday, and 3 or more drinks/day. Dietary calcium,\npotassium, and sodium data were divided into quar-\ntiles based on the distribution of the entire sample,\nand the quartile with the lowest consumption was\nused as the reference category. Similarly, serum\nlevels of calcium, potassium, and sodium were di-\nvided into quartiles based on the distribution of the\nentire sample, with the lowest serum values used as\nthe reference category.\nTo describe differences in categorical baseline\nvariables among the four race and sex groups, we\nused log-linear modeling. To test for differences in\ncontinuous variables among the four race and sex\ngroups, we used analysis of variance. The relation-\nship of the study variables to the development of\nhypertension was examined in several ways. For each\nrace and sex group, we determined the incidence of\nhypertension for each level of each study variable.\nDuferences in hypertension incidence were exam-\nined with x1 tests. Furthermore, we used logistic\nregression analysis to examine the relation between\neach individual study variable and hypertension sta-\ntus. To examine the independent association be-\ntween the study variables and hypertension status,\nmultiple logistic regression analysis was used.\nThe NHANES I study was designed as a multistage,\nstratified probability survey. Oversampling of certain\ngroups (women of childbearing age, the elderly, and\npersons living in low-income areas) was performed.\nRather than producing national prevalence estimates,\nwe wished to examine relations between risk factors\nand mortality in a large community sample and, there-\nfore, we did not use sample weights.\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nVariable\nAge(yr)\nIncome\nEducation (yr)\nNonleisure-timc physical activity\nVery active\nModerately active\nInactive\nLeisure-time physical activity\nMuch exercise\nModerate exercise\nLittle or no exercise\nWeight\nNormal weight\nObese\nSevere obesity\nAlcohol use (drinks/day)\nBlack\nmen\nn\n%\nWhite\nmen\nn\n%\nBlack\nwomen\nn\n%\nWhite\nwomen\nn\n%\nRace\np Value\nSex\nInteraction\nResults\navailable for analysis not involving serum or dietary\ndata after exclusions (Figure 1). Because of the\nrelatively small number of black participants in-\nvolved, some of the results, especially for black men,\nare based on small numbers; therefore, the findings\nshould be interpreted with caution.\nThe distribution of categorical variables and means\nwith standard errors of continuous variables at base-\nline for the four race and sex groups are presented in\nTables 1 and 2, respectively. The four groups are\ncharacterized by differences in race or sex or both\nrace and sex distributions of all study variables.\nThe 10-year incidence of hypertension increased\nwith age and body mass index in all four groups and\ndecreased with increasing education in all groups\nexcept black men (Table 3). Except among white\nwomen, the incidence of hypertension was higher\namong the least active group during leisure time than\namong more active participants. The incidence of\nhypertension varied little across serum magnesium\nand alcohol consumption levels.\nMean systolic blood pressure was 123.0 mm Hg at\nbaseline and 125.1 mm Hg at follow-up. The change\nin systolic blood pressure ranged from a decrease of\n65 mm Hg to an increase of 91 mm Hg. Mean dia-\nstolic blood pressure was 78.5 mm Hg at baseline and\n76.0 mm Hg at follow-up. The change in diastolic\nblood pressure ranged from a decrease of 61 mm Hg\nto an increase of 68 mm Hg.\nThe univariate relations were examined simultane-\nously by multiple logistic regression analysis (Table\n4). Increasing body mass index was the only variable\nthat was consistently associated with the develop-\nment of hypertension in all groups. In models where\nwe categorized body mass index, the odds ratios for\nmen with a body mass index of 27.3 or greater and\nwomen with a body mass index of 27.8 kg/nr or\ngreater compared with those who had a smaller body\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nFord and Cooper Risk Factors for Hypertension 601\nTABLE 2.

Education was inversely related to\nthe probability of hypertension developing among\nwhite women and was of borderline significance\namong white men and black women. Serum magne-\nsium levels were inversely related to the incidence of\nhypertension. White men who consumed 3 or more\ndrinks/day were at increased risk for hypertension\ndeveloping compared with white men who drank 1-2\ndrinks/day (odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence limits\nuse among black men suggested a similar association\nbut were not statistically significant. This is in con-\ntrast to white women, who had a lower risk of\nhypertension if they consumed less than 1 drink/day.\nPhysical activity did not predict the development of\nhypertension.\nFor the dietary analysis, 4,772 white subjects free\nfrom hypertension at baseline and with complete\ndata for the dependent and independent variables\nwere available for analysis (Table 5). Because of\nsmall numbers, the analyses were restricted to white\nparticipants. Among white men (n = 1,709), no signif-\nicantfindingswere observed in statistical models that\nadjusted for age or age and caloric intake. Among\nwhite women (n=3,063), calcium, potassium, and\nsodium intake were all inversely related to hyperten-\nsion in statistical models that adjusted for age only.\nHowever, in models that adjusted for age and caloric\nintake, no significant results were found. Body mass\nindex appears to confound the relation between\ncalcium and potassium intake and hypertension but\nnot that of sodium intake.\nThere was no evidence that baseline serum levels\nof calcium, potassium, or sodium were predictive of\nthe future risk of hypertension in either univariate or\nmultivariate analysis (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nRelatively few epidemiological investigations have\nprospectively examined potential causes of hyperten-\nsion. We examined the relation of a number of\nvariables to hypertension development after a mean\nfollow-up period of 10 years. Education and body\nmass index were the two variables that most consis-\ntently predicted the incidence of hypertension across\nall four race and sex groups.\nA hypertension threshold of 160 mm Hg or more\nfor SBP or 95 mm Hg or more for DBP was chosen\nfor two reasons. First, during the period of this study,\nthe prevailing definition of hypertension was based\non this threshold. Only in 1984 was the definition\nchanged to a SBP of 140 mm Hg or more or a DBP of\n90 mm Hg or more.1 Second, only one blood pressure\nmeasurement was obtained at baseline. Conse-\nquently, the possibility of misclassifying a participant\nas hypertensive is greater at the lower threshold of\nhypertension.\nVarious anthropometric measures have been asso-\nciated with blood pressure.11 Our study demonstrates\nthat, independent of age, body mass index was a risk\nfactor for hypertension. Data from the NHANES II\nstudy showed that the prevalence of obesity (com-\nbined overweight and severe overweight categories)\nblack women.10 If the odds ratios for obesity previ-\nously calculated are assumed to be approximations of\nthe relative risk, then the population attributable risk\nfor white women, and 28.8% for black women. These\ndata underscore the importance of weight control in\nthe prevention of hypertension, especially among\nblack men and women.\nSeveral studies have shown that socioeconomic\nstatus is inversely related to blood pressure.12-13 Our\nresults also show that participants with more ad-\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nTABLE 3.

Also, the questions asked\nof the augmented sample used to classify participants\nas hypertensive differed somewhat. This difference may\nhave resulted in some people (but probably not very\nmany) being misclassified as normotensive.\nThe measurement of several of the independent\nvariables poses greater concerns. Dietary data were\ncollected at a single 24-hour recall. With this method,\nthe intraindividual variability exceeds the interindi-\nvidual variability and therefore, it may not be suffi-\nciently accurate to classify persons correctly. The\nimpact of measurement error using this technique on\npotential associations has been discussed previous-\nly.3940 We tried to minimize misclassification by\nperforming a quartile analysis, but the results from\nthis analysis did not give strong support for any effect\nof intake of dietary cations (Table 5).\nThe classification of physical activity levels in this\ndata set is unsophisticated and probably resulted in\nsignificant misclassification. Participants were simply\nasked to classify themselves, without a frame of\nreference, in one of three activity categories. There-\nfore, each participant's belief of what constituted\nbeing active or sedentary dictated an answer. The\nreliability of these answers has not been tested, and\nthe indirect validity of these data in the NHANES I\nstudy is limited.41 The usefulness and limitations of\nsimplified physical activity questionnaires have been\nFinally, the relatively small numbers of black men\nand women reduced the power of the study to detect\nassociations in these groups.\nIn conclusion, body mass index and education were\ngenerally the most consistent predictors for the de-\nvelopment of hypertension after an average of 10\nyears of follow-up among the four race and sex\ngroups. These data confirm the importance of weight\ncontrol in the prevention of hypertension and pro-\nvide a clear target for intervention by both the\nphysician in his or her daily practice and by persons\nin the public health sector. No strong evidence for an\neffect of dietary sodium, potassium, or calcium intake\non the incidence of hypertension was observed. How-\never, the failure of our study to support findings\nrelating intake of dietary cations to the development\nof hypertension may be attributable to imprecision in\nthe measurement of dietary data and misclassifica-\ntion of hypertension status. Future longitudinal stud-\nies using better quantification of dietary variables\nshould address the importance of dietary intake of\ncations on hypertension in the general population.\nReferences\n1.
