Approximately 90% of these\nindividuals had fasting glucose 100 mg/dl. Older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black\nrace/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia, higher BMI, and lower attained education were\nsignificantly associated with having a higher A1C level even among individuals with\nnormal fasting glucose (100 mg/dl) and after multivariable adjustment.\nCONCLUSIONS -- A single elevated A1C level (A1C 6%) is common in the\ngeneral population of adults without a history of diabetes and is highly reliable for the\ndetection of elevated fasting glucose. Nondiabetic adults with elevated A1C are likely to\nhave impaired fasting glucose and an array of other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and\ncardiovascular disease.\nA1C is an integrated measure of circu-\nlatingglucoselevelsandtrackswellin\nindividuals over time. Epidemiologi-\ncal studies have shown that A1C values in\nnondiabeticadultspredictincidentdiabetes\n(1\u00ad5),cardiovasculardiseasemorbidityand\nmortality (6\u00ad10), and total mortality (7). In\nthese studies, A1C values well within in the\n\"normal\" range (i.e., A1C 6%) were inde-\npendently associated with clinical out-\ncomes. There is currently renewed interest\nin using A1C for diagnosis and/or screening\nfor diabetes (11); however, there have been\nfew epidemiological investigations of A1C\nin nondiabetic adults. The objective of the\npresent study was to examine the preva-\nlence and correlates of elevated A1C in a\nlarge, nationally representative sample of\nU.S.adultswithoutdiagnoseddiabeteswho\nparticipated in the National Health and Nu-\ntrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nevated A1C levels (e.g., A1C 6%) are\ncommon in the general population of non-\ndiabetic adults in the U.S. and 2) A1C levels\nwould be associated with risk factors for\ntype 2 diabetes and its complications even\nin the absence of elevated glucose levels.\nMETHODS -- NHANES is an ongoing\ncross-sectional, multistage, stratified,\nclustered probability sample of the U.S.\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population\nconducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS), a branch of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion (12).

For the present study,\nwe excluded those individuals who re-\nported that a doctor or health care profes-\nsion had ever told them they had diabetes\ntion on diabetes status (n  288), or who\nprotocols of conduct for NHANES were\napproved by the NCHS institutional re-\nview board, and informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nFasting plasma glucose subsample\nApproximately one-half of NHANES par-\nticipants were sampled to attend the\nmorning session. These participants were\ninstructed to fast at least 9 hours before\nthe appointment time. Fasting plasma\nglucose (FPG) values are available for\nthose adults aged 20 years who at-\ntended the morning examination and\nanalyses of fasting glucose were limited to\nthe fasting subpopulation of adults with-\nout diabetes who were not missing A1C\nfasting subsample, we conducted analy-\nses comparing A1C levels among individ-\nuals with normal fasting glucose (100\nmg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG)\ntolerance test (OGTT) was added to the\nlaboratory protocol.

We\ngenerated weighted and smoothed histo-\ngrams (kernel density estimator) to com-\npare the distribution of A1C in individuals\nwith normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undi-\nagnosed diabetes.\nFor the purposes of this study, we de-\nfined \"elevated A1C\" as A1C 6% in this\npopulation without a history of diabetes.\nHowever, we also assessed the prevalence\n7.0%. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and\ntheir corresponding 95% CIs were esti-\nmated from logistic regression models to\nassess the association between potential\nrisk factors and elevated A1C levels. We\nconducted multivariable logistic analyses\nmodeling A1C 6% as the outcome in\nthe overall population. In the population\nof adults with normal A1C (6%) and\nnormal fasting glucose (100 mg/dl) lev-\nels, we modeled the association between\nrisk factors of interest and A1C level\nabove the weighted median A1C level in\nthis population (5.2%).

Approximately 45% of these indi-\nviduals have IFG and 45% have fasting\nwere particularly common among older\nadults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese\nindividuals. We found that demographic\ncharacteristics and risk factors for type 2\ndiabetes and its complications including\nolder age, male sex, nonwhite race/\nethnicity, lower attained education level,\nadiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were\nassociated with elevated A1C even in the\npresence of normal fasting glucose.\nSignificant advantages of adopting A1C\nfor the screening and diagnosis of diabetes\nare the high repeatability of the measure-\nment (17,18) and the high specificity of el-\nevated values for detecting undiagnosed\ntions have stated that diagnosis based on\nA1C should be confirmed using a glucose-\ndependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a\nsecond A1C (11). However, glucose-\ndependent tests are less reliable (repeatable)\nthan A1C (17). Requiring confirmation of a\nhighly reliable test by one that is less reliable\nposes problems for the interpretation of any\ndiscrepancy between the two values. In a\nprevious study, we analyzed repeated mea-\nsurements taken 2 weeks apart on an un-\nselected sample of individuals without\ndiabetes and found that 100% of individu-\nals with A1C 7% had a second A1C mea-\nlevel 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r \nrepeating the A1C test within a short (sev-\neral week) time period.

Addi-\ntional advantages to using A1C for screen-\ning and/or diagnosis of diabetes include\nnational standardization of the assay\n(22,23), the low analytic variability (high\nmethodological quality of the assay, even\nwhen compared with glucose) (24), the\nwidespread availability of the A1C test and\nitscurrentuseinthemanagementandtreat-\nment of diabetes, and the fact that the pa-\ntient does not need to fast.\nIt is unclear why nondiabetic non-\nHispanic blacks have consistently higher\nA1C values even in the setting of normal\nfasting glucose levels and after adjustment\nfor demographic and clinical characteris-\ntics. Further research should be con-\nducted to determine whether this\ndisparity stems from racial differences in\npostprandial glycemia or from racial dif-\nferences in the tendency of hemoglobin to\nundergo glycosylation.\nThis study has several strengths includ-\ning the large, nationally representative sam-\nple of healthy, nondiabetic individuals.

Impor-\ntant limitations include the cross-sectional\ndesign, which limits our conclusions re-\ngarding the temporality of the observed as-\nsociations. In addition, we had only a single\nmeasurement of fasting glucose. The Amer-\nican Diabetes Association recommends re-\npeating an elevated fasting glucose\nmeasurement to confirm the diagnosis of\ndiabetes (13).
