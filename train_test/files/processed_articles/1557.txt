If so, what factors\ninfluence the place where these chil-\ndren die?\nA growing body of evidence sug-\ngests that for pediatric patients who die\nof terminal illnesses, the location at the\ntime of death has important implica-\ntions. In addition to many pediatric pal-\nliative care clinicians attesting that\n\"home is almost always the preference\nof the child, who can be in familiar sur-\nroundings,\"1 when care is provided in\nthe home setting, parental satisfaction\nwith care appears to be greater,2 and\nsubsequent adaptation and outcomes\nfor parents and siblings may be im-\nproved.3,4 Additionally, the delivery of\nend-of-life care at home may also re-\nflect the nature of preceding medical\ncommunication and decision making.\nIn studies of children who died of\ncancer, earlier parental understanding\nregarding the child's prognosis of no re-\nalistic chance for cure has been asso-\nciated with a greater likelihood of death\noccurring at home.5,6\nThree interrelated developments\nmake questions regarding the place of\ndeath timely and germane.7,8 First, ad-\nvances in hospital-based pediatric medi-\ncal and surgical care are enabling more\nchildren to survive longer with what\npreviously were swiftly lethal condi-\ntions, with the likely result that the\nprevalence of children living with life-\nthreatening conditions is increasing, but\nto an unknown degree.9-11 Second, the\nbroadening use in the home setting of\nnew and often sophisticated medical\nAuthor Affiliations: The Pediatric Advanced Care Team\n(Drs Feudtner and Kang), the Pediatric Generalist Re-\nsearch Group (Drs Feudtner and Feinstein, Ms Satchell),\nthe Biostatistics and Data Management Core (Mr\nZhao), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadel-\nphia, Pa; Division of General Pediatrics (Drs Feudtner\nand Feinstein, Ms Satchell) and Oncology (Dr Kang),\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania\nSchool of Medicine; The Leonard Davis Institute and\nthe Center for Bioethics, University of Pennsylvania\n(Dr Feudtner).\nCorresponding Author: Chris Feudtner, MD, PhD,\nThe Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 34th and Civic\nCenter Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (feudtner\n@email.chop.edu).\nContext The place where children with complex chronic conditions are dying may\nbe shifting toward residential homes due to the evolving epidemiology of life-\nthreatening childhood conditions, advances in home-based medical technology, and\nchanges in attitudes about pediatric palliative care and hospice services.\nObjectives To determine whether pediatric deaths attributed to complex chronic con-\nditions are increasingly occurring in the home and to assess race and ethnicity dispari-\nties in the location of death.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Retrospective national-level case series drawn\nfrom the National Center for Health Statistics' Multiple Cause of Death Files spanning\nwith a complex chronic condition excluding injury and noncomplex chronic condi-\ntions (as classified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or In-\nternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision).\nMain Outcome Measure Place where death occurred.\nto a complex chronic condition between 1989 and 2003, the percentage of individu-\nals dying at home increased significantly (P.001) over time for infants (aged 1 year)\nto 19-year-olds (18.4% and 32.2%). Adjusting for decedent characteristics, the odds\nof dying at home increased significantly each year (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence\ninterval, 1.03-1.04) and were reduced among both black and Hispanic decedents (odds\ndence interval, 0.50-0.54, respectively) compared with white decedents.\nConclusions Children who die with underlying complex chronic conditions increas-\ningly are dying at home. Racial and ethnic disparities regarding place of death may\nrepresent important limitations and opportunities for improvement in the current sys-\ntems of pediatric chronic and palliative care.\nregimens and technologies, ranging\nfrom complex polypharmacy to me-\nchanical ventilators, may be increas-\ning the residential population of medi-\ncally fragile children who at any given\nmoment are at an increased risk of\ndeath.12,13 Third, recent efforts to fa-\ncilitate the delivery of pediatric pallia-\ntive care or hospice may be enabling a\nlarger percentage of terminally ill chil-\ndren to be cared for at home.14 In com-\nbination, these 3 trends might be con-\ntributing to an increase in the number\nof deaths occurring at home, whether\nunexpected or anticipated.\nWhereas a variety of studies have ex-\namined the place of death for adults who\ndied due to medical diseases,15-29 popu-\nlation-level data regarding the place of\ndeath for children and young adults are\nthus far limited to 2 published studies.\nattributed to either congenital anoma-\nlies or conditions of the perinatal pe-\namong children who died with an un-\nderlying complex chronic condition,the\nplaceofdeath(especiallyforinfants)was\npredominantly the hospital but an in-\ncreasingpercentageweredyingathome,\nrising to 41% among the children who\ndiedaftertheirfirstbirthday.31 Addition-\nally, this study found that a decedent's\nrace and ethnicity, the geographic loca-\ntionoftheirhome,andthelocalarealevel\nof income all affected the likelihood of\nachilddyingathome,withpoorer,black,\nand Hispanic children being more likely\nto die in the hospital than at home.31 If\nconfirmedtobeamoregeneralphenom-\nenon, a significant shift in the site of\ndeath from the hospital to home (result-\ning from some combination of unex-\npected and anticipated deaths) would\npresent several challenges to health care\npracticeandpolicy.Inbothinstances,en-\nsuring that children living with life-\nthreatening diseases are receiving high-\nquality care--whether this care seeks\ncure, life extension, or palliation--is im-\nperative.\nWe conducted a retrospective\nnational-level case series of all deaths\nattributed to a complex chronic con-\ndition that occurred before the dece-\ndents' 20th birthday in the United States\ncally sought to test the hypothesis that\nthe percentage of complex chronic\ncondition-related deaths occurring at\nhome increased over the 15-year ob-\nservation period.\nMETHODS\nData Sources and Variables\nThe Children's Hospital of Philadel-\nphia Committee for the Protection of\nHuman Subjects reviewed and ap-\nproved the conduct of this study. We\nused National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics Multiple Cause of Death Files\ncompiled from national death certifi-\ndividuals who died between birth and\ntheir 20th birthday. The files included\ndata regarding decedents' age (classi-\nyears), sex, race (classified as white,\nblack, or other), Hispanic ethnicity,\nstate of residence (classified into the 4\nmajor geographic regions defined by the\nUS Census), underlying cause of death\nidentified with International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)\ncodes, and place of death (reclassified\ninto 3 major categories of home resi-\ndence; hospital, clinic, or medical cen-\nter; and all other places). Data regard-\ning place of death were excluded for\nlying complex chronic conditions in\ncoding of the place of death. For the\n2.2% of decedents in the sample who\nwere missing data regarding Hispanic\nethnicity, we imputed the missing val-\nues on the basis of a multivariate tech-\nnique (implemented using the Stata-\nfitting a sequence of 5 regression mod-\nels that imputed the missing value and\ncombining the resulting data sets to per-\nform the regression models described\nin \"Statistical Analyses.\"\nCase Selection and Classification\nComplex chronic conditions were de-\nfined as medical conditions that can be\nreasonably expected to last at least 12\nmonths (unless death intervenes) and\nthat involve either several different or-\ngan systems or 1 organ system se-\nverely enough to require specialty pe-\ndiatric care and probably some period\nof hospitalization in a tertiary care\ncenter. To identify whether an indi-\nvidual died from a complex chronic\ncondition, we used our previously\npublished classification scheme based\non ICD-9 codes, which assigns diag-\nnoses to 1 of 9 categories: neuromus-\ncular, cardiovascular, pulmonary, re-\nnal, gastrointestinal, hematologic/\nimmunologic, metabolic, malignancy,\nand genetic/other congenital defect con-\ncodes listed for the underlying cause of\ndeath, we recoded the ICD-10 codes as\nICD-9 codes and then classified the\ncases into complex chronic condition\ncategories.\nWe were able to make 2 assessments\nof these classification procedures using\nwhichwaspreparedforpublicusebythe\nNational Center for Health Statistics, in\norder to contain for each decedent both\nICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for the under-\nlying cause of death and up to 15 addi-\ntional secondary diagnoses.35 Using this\nfile, we first assessed the adequacy of\nusing only the single ICD-9 code listed\nas the underlying cause of death to clas-\nsifycases.Comparedwithusingallavail-\nable primary and secondary cause of\ndeath codes, the single underlying cause\nof death detected 96% of the decedents\nwithcomplexchroniccondition-related\ndeaths. Given this high level of detec-\ntion,weperformedallanalysesusingthe\nunderlying cause of death ICD code as\nthe basis of classification of a dece-\ndent's complex chronic condition sta-\ntus. Next, we compared for each dece-\nFile the complex chronic condition\nassignment based on the ICD-9 and\nICD-10 underlying cause of death codes,\nwith 99% agreement of the assignment\nto 1 of the 9 specific complex chronic\ncondition categories.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using\nStata/MP 9.2 statistical software (Stata-\nCorp, College Station, Tex). First, the\nabsolute counts and proportions of\ndeaths that occurred at the sites of in-\nterest were examined and tested for\ntrends using univariate logistic regres-\nsion, regressing the occurrence of home\ndeath on the year of death and exam-\nining the significance of the coeffi-\ncient for the year of death, which we\nmodeled as a continuous variable.\nNext, a multivariable logistic regres-\nsion model was constructed with selec-\ntion of covariates based on the authors'\nprior research,31 specified a priori to\ninclude year of death, age at death, sex,\nrace, Hispanic ethnicity, type of com-\nplex chronic condition (using malig-\nnancy as the referent), and geographic\nlocation of the home (using the North-\neastasthereferent).Thefinalmodeldem-\naCstatisticof0.78.Todeterminethesig-\nnificance of interactions between spe-\ncific states and race and ethnicity char-\nacteristicsontheoddsofdeathoccurring\nathome,weusedthelikelihoodratiotest\nofnestedreducedmodelswithandwith-\nout the interaction terms.\nGraphic depictions of data for the\nnual counts of decedents who died at\nthe specified sites or the proportions of\ndeaths occurring at home, with lines\nand 95% confidence intervals fitted\nusing fractional polynomials that can\nmodel in a nonlinear manner the pro-\nportion of deaths at home for each of\nthespecifiedstratifyingvariables.

Of these\ncomplex chronic condition-related\nwere younger than 1 year of age, and\ndren died in the hospital and 15% died\nin the home setting (TABLE 1). Ninety-\ntwo percent of infants aged younger\nthan 1 year died in the hospital, whereas\n70% of children and adolescents aged\n1 to 19 years died in the hospital.\nAmong infants, the predominant cause\nof death was cardiovascular condi-\ntions (32%), followed by congenital or\nneuromuscular (14%) conditions. In\nthe older age categories, the leading\ncause of death was malignancy (43%),\nfollowed by neuromuscular (23%) and\ncardiovascular (17%) conditions.\nOver the 15-year observation period,\nwhilethenumberofdeathsattributedto\ncomplexchronicconditionsdeclined(in\nkeeping with an overall decline in the\ntotal number and rate of pediatric\ndeaths36), the number of deaths occur-\nringathomeremainedsteadyforinfants\nTable 1.

The odds of dying at home\nwere reduced among black and His-\npanicindividuals(oddsratio[OR],0.50;\npared with whites, and were greatest in\nthe western region of the United States\ncompared with the northeastern region\nof the United States. Across all age cat-\negories, individuals with malignancy,\nneuromuscular,metabolic,orcongenital/\ngeneticcomplexchronicconditiontypes\nwere consistently associated with the\ngreatest likelihood of death having oc-\ncurred at home.\nThe racial and ethnic disparities re-\ngarding the percentage of deaths among\ndecedents with complex chronic con-\nditions were evident across the entire\nstudy interval (FIGURE 4).

Stratifying by the\nrace and ethnicity of the decedents, sig-\nnificant variation in the percentages of\nhome deaths exists both within states\nand between states (P.001 for tests re-\ngarding both state-level differences and\nfor interactions between specific states\nand race/ethnicity). For instance,\namong white non-Hispanic infants dy-\ning in Texas with a congenital/genetic\ncondition, 14.1% died at home, while\namong comparable white Hispanic and\nblack non-Hispanic infants, only 8.9%\nand 7.4% died at home, respectively. In\ncontrast to the typical pattern of home\ndeaths being less common among black\nand Hispanic individuals, Florida chil-\nyears who died of neuromuscular con-\nditions did so at home more often if they\nwere black non-Hispanic (45.8%) than\nif they were white Hispanic (40.0%) or\nwhite non-Hispanic (36.8%) children\nand adolescents (P=.04).\nCOMMENT\nUnited States, the place of death shifted\nfrom predominantly the hospital in-\ncreasingly toward the home setting\namong children whose deaths were at-\ntributed to a complex chronic condi-\ntion. Among this group, which com-\nprised one fifth of all pediatric deaths,\nsignificant racial and ethnic dispari-\nties were observed in the likelihood\nof death occurring at home, with these\ndifferences persisting even after adjust-\nment for decedents' age, sex, complex\nchronic condition type, geographic\nlocation, and the overall temporal\ntrend.\nBefore considering the implications\nof the shift in the place of death to-\nward home, the racial and ethnic dis-\nparities, and implications regarding\nboth the structure and equity of pedi-\natric chronic and end-of-life care, the\nstrengths and weaknesses of this study\nwarrant consideration. Three charac-\nteristics of the findings support the\nstrength of this study. First, the prin-\ncipal results of this national study ac-\ncord with a previous study that was lim-\nited to only Washington State from\nFigure 3.

The curved lines represent the temporal trend in the percentage of deaths that occurred\nat home as estimated by the best fitting fractional polynomial model, which also estimated the 95% confidence intervals indicated by the shaded areas.\ntern of the findings, an increasing pro-\nportion of deaths due to chronic ill-\nness occurring at home with notable\ndifferences across racial and ethnic\ngroups, is similar to what has been\nnoted for adults.22,27 Third, the magni-\ntude of the temporal trends and the ra-\ncial and ethnic disparities regarding\nwhere children die are not only statis-\ntically significant but substantial and\npronounced.\nTwo limitations may have influ-\nenced the detailed precision of the re-\nsults of this study. First, a small pro-\nportion of deaths may have been\nmisclassified as being associated (or not\nassociated) with a specific complex\nchronic condition category because (1)\nthe data source relies on the original\ndeath certificates, some of which may\nhave recorded diagnostic information\nerroneously (a known problem among\nadult decedents, especially the elder-\ndition classification was based only on\nthe primary underlying cause of death\nICD-9 code, which probably resulted in\nthe exclusion of an estimated 4% of\ndeaths associated with complex chronic\nconditions but which on the death cer-\ntificate had the complex chronic con-\ndition listed only as a secondary cause;\nand (3) ICD-10 codes were converted\ntion error of 1%. Second, race or eth-\nnicity may have been misclassified for\nsome decedents due to errors in the\noriginaldeathcertificates.Arecentcom-\nmunity-based study of adults, how-\never, found 97% agreement between\nrace and ethnicity recorded on the death\ncertificate and the decedents' prior self-\nreported race and ethnicity.39 Such er-\nrors though are unlikely to account for\nthe main finding of the study regard-\ning the increasing percentage over time\nof complex chronic condition-related\ndeaths occurring at home or to have in-\ntroduced significant bias into the age-,\nrace-, or ethnicity-specific associa-\ntions that were observed in this study.\nWhat might explain a greater pro-\nportion of children with complex\nchronic conditions increasingly dying\nat home and the likelihood of home\ndeath being associated with the child's\nrace or ethnicity? Currently, the mecha-\nnisms underlying the observed shift in\nthe place of death are unknown and\nwarrant clarification. First, improve-\nments in the medical management of\npediatric complex chronic conditions\nmay be prolonging survival, both in-\ncreasing the prevalence of children liv-\ning with life-threatening complex\nchronic conditions and providing more\ntime for advanced decision making.\nSimilarly, advances in medical technol-\nogy in the home setting, ranging from\ngastrostomy feeding tubes to home ven-\ntilators, may be enabling an increas-\ning percentage of medically fragile or\ntechnologically dependent children to\nspend longer periods of time living at\nhome; hence, the possibility of dying\nat home (either foreseen or acciden-\ntal) has risen. Finally, broad shifts in\nattitudes and decision-making pro-\nTable 2.

Changes in any of these\n3 possible underlying mechanisms may\nalso explain the observed racial and eth-\nnic differences, whereby differential ac-\ncess to health care services or medical\ntechnology, divergent cultural atti-\ntudes or approaches to palliative and\nend-of-life care decision making, or dif-\nfering levels of financial or other sup-\nport within the patient's or family's so-\ncial network may make dying at home\nConsideringthefindingsofthisstudy,\nseveral issues require attention.
