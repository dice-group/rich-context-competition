    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study is a first attempt to experimentally test the impact of two specific social factors,\nnamely social conformity pressure and a sense of being watched, on participants' judgments of the\nartistic quality of aesthetic objects. We manipulated conformity pressure with a test form in which a\nphotograph of each stimulus was presented together with unanimously low (downward pressure) or\nhigh quality ratings (upward pressure) of three would-be previous raters. Participants' sense of being\nwatched was manipulated by testing each of them in two settings, one of which contained an\neyespots stimulus. Both social factors significantly affected the participants' judgments--\nunexpectedly, however, with conformity pressure only working in the downward direction and\neyespots leading to an overall downward shift in participants' judgments. Our findings indicate the\nrelevance of including explicit and implicit social factors in aesthetics research, thus also reminding us\nof the limitations of overly reductionist approaches to investigating aesthetic perception and\nexperience.\n",

I threw the bottle rack and the urinal in their faces and now\nthey admire them . . .\nMarcel Duchamp\nWhen strolling through a museum, we see artworks and we somehow react to what we are\nseeing, emotionally and cognitively (e.g., Kreitler, & Kreitler, 1972). We form opinions and\nwe judge the artworks, for instance, with regard to aesthetic appeal, interestingness, or\nartistic quality. As empirical aesthetics research has shown, such aesthetic judgments are\nnot determined by properties of the artworks alone, but also by a variety of external\nfactors (i.e., factors that are not actual properties of the artworks). Mere exposure, for\ninstance, is capable of increasing recipients' preferences for artworks, and even of\npromoting whole artistic canons (Cutting, 2003). Aesthetic judgments are further affected\nor modulated by semantic and physical context (Locher, Smith, & Smith, 2001; Muth, Raab,\n& Carbon, 2017), training and experience (e.g., Nodine, Locher, & Krupinski, 1993), as well\nas expertise (e.g., Pihko et al., 2011), to name just a few. Besides, judgments of artistic quality\nare relatively easy to manipulate by providing information about an artwork's authenticity\n(Wolz & Carbon, 2014). Even the perceived artistic quality of an acclaimed masterpiece such\nas Leonardo's La Gioconda can be sabotaged, simply by making recipients deeply elaborate\nan alternative version of the painting (the rediscovered and restored ``Prado version,''\nAccording to several theoretical accounts, social variables are being incorporated into\naesthetic reception and the formation of aesthetic judgments (e.g., Muelder Eaton, 1995;\nMukar ovsky\nnotion stems from observations in museums. For instance, Tro\n\u00a8 ndle, Wintzerith, Wa\n\u00a8 spe,\nand Tschacher (2012) found that companionship and conversation of museum visitors\naffected their reception of the exhibited artworks. In a recent field study carried out by\nCarbon (2017), these two types of social behavior were shown by many of the observed\nmuseum visitors. However, empirical and especially experimental inquiries into the role of\ndifferent social variables with regards to aesthetic reception and judgments are sparse.\nMadden (1960) made one of the rare experimental attempts and tested whether judgments\nof facial beauty could be modified by exertion of social conformity pressure. The paradigm\nused in the experiment was a modified version of the paradigm used by Asch (1956). In a now\nclassic series of experiments, Asch investigated how strongly judgments in a simple perceptual\ncomparison task conform to or are independent of the judgments of a unanimous majority.\nParticipants were tested in groups of 8 to 10 men; they had to compare a standard line against\nthree comparison lines, one of which most obviously had the same length as the standard line.\nIn the most basic variant of the paradigm, judgments had to be stated aloud in front of the\ngroup. All participants but one were in fact confederates of the experimenter and had been\ninstructed beforehand to give unanimously wrong answers in certain trials. Thus, the only\n``real'' tested individual, who always was the second-to-last to announce his judgment, faced\nconformity pressure directed counter the correct answer in these trials. Madden (1960)\nmodified the Asch paradigm in that the group exerting social conformity pressure was not\nphysically present in the experimental setting; instead, this social background was simulated\nby presenting ratings that were labeled as ``given by previous raters.'' Each participant was\nasked to judge several profile drawings of female heads with regards to beauty on a scale from\n1 (homely) to 7 (beautiful), and to indicate his judgments by writing them onto a rating form\nwhich had been prepared by the experimenter to look as if it had already been used by some\nprevious participants. The number of these simulated or made-up participants was either one\n2 i-Perception\n(for two subsamples), three (for eight subsamples), or five (for two subsamples). On 15 critical\ntrials, the simulated ratings were either two scale points higher than the average that the\nrespective stimulus had received in a pre-study (upward conformity pressure, exerted for one\nhalf of the subsamples) or two scale points lower (downward conformity pressure, exerted for\nthe other half of the subsamples). The results indicate that the experimentally induced social\nconformity pressure swayed the participants' beauty judgments toward the manipulated\naverage, working especially well in the downward direction.\nBesides judgments of facial beauty, music preferences of adolescents (Inglefield, 1968)\nand judgments of present and future fashionability of clothing (Davis & Miller, 1983) were\nshown to be affected by social conformity pressure in experimental settings. With the present\nexperiment, we transpose the research on the impact of social conformity pressure to another\ndomain of aesthetics, the reception and judgment of aesthetic objects, or more specifically to\nthe judgment of their artistic quality. We hypothesize that similar to judgments of beauty,\njudgments of artistic quality are likewise influenced by social conformity pressure. To test\nthis, we adopted Madden's (1960) paradigm of exerting social conformity pressure on our\nparticipants while they were making judgments of artistic quality. This allowed us to conduct\na modified replication of Madden's study. Moreover, it allowed us to use perceived artistic\nquality as a dependent measure, thus going beyond mere ratings of preference or impressions\nof beauty. Although related to preference, artistic quality goes beyond, as it is a\nmultidimensional construct, determined by, inter alia, originality and ambiguity (see\nHaertel & Carbon, 2014). As stimuli, we used photographs of objects with indifferent (i.e.,\nmedium) artistic quality, which had been assessed in an earlier baseline study. This is in line\nwith Madden, who showed female profiles of, previously rated, medium beauty. We\nhypothesized that participants would reorient their judgments in the direction of the social\nconformity pressure.\nAs past research has shown that normative behavior can be increased by observation\n(Munger & Harris, 1989), we exerted conformity pressure under two different conditions.\nEither we merely displayed manipulated ratings of would-be previous participants, or we\nadded a photograph of a pair of eyes to these fake ratings. Images of eyes or, more generally,\neyespots stimuli can serve as cues eliciting a sense of being seen or watched (Pfattheicher &\nKeller, 2015). The mere presence of eyespots was found to be effective in enhancing various\nkinds of pro-social behavior in the laboratory as well as in real-world settings (e.g., Bateson,\nNettle, & Roberts, 2006; Haley & Fessler, 2005). In contrast to the confrontation with fake\nratings of additional would-be raters, which represents a quite explicit cue to the social\nembedding of the participants' judgments, eyespots stimuli are considered as rather\nimplicit social cues or triggers (see, e.g., Panagopoulos & van der Linden, 2017). Including\nan eyespots-present condition in the present experiment, we thus introduced a second,\nqualitatively different source of social influence. We accordingly hypothesized that the\nconformity pressure would be further increased by the presence of eyespots so that the\ndifference between judgments made under downward versus upward conformity pressure\nwould be higher in the eyespots-present setting than in the eyespots-absent setting.\nIt has been theorized and shown that aesthetic judgments may be moderated by person-\nrelated variables such as art expertise (e.g., Kreitler, & Kreitler, 1972; Pihko et al., 2011).\nResponsiveness to social cues and pressures, on the other hand, may vary due to individual\ndifferences in certain personality factors. DeYoung, Peterson, and Higgins (2002), for\ninstance, assessed conformity in terms of socially desirable responding and found\nconformity to be positively related with stability, but negatively with plasticity, both of\nwhich are, according to them, higher-order factors of the Big Five. In order to be able to\ntest, in a secondary analysis, whether results obtained in the present experiment were also\nHesslinger et al. 3\naffected by individual differences in the named variables (art expertise, social desirability,\nstability, and plasticity) we decided to measure them by means of questionnaires.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 48 students of the University of Bamberg (13 men; age M \u00bc 23.0 years, range:\n18\u00ad34 years) took part in the experiment. They all showed normal or corrected-to-normal\nvisual acuity and normal color vision. The participants were treated in accordance with\nthe declaration of Helsinki and gave written informed consent before the experiment.\nThey received a monetary compensation for their participation (E5 each).\nDesign\nThe present experiment followed a 2 \u00c2 2 repeated measures design testing the impact of the\nfactors conformity pressure (upward, downward) and eyespots (present, absent) on the\nperceived artistic quality of aesthetic stimuli. The design was fully crossed. Please note\nthat, for the factor conformity pressure, we followed the approach of Madden (1960) and\nreferred to previously collected baseline data on the artistic quality of the stimuli (Haertel &\nCarbon, 2014) instead of including a control group. The sample used for assessing the\nbaseline data stemmed from the same participant pool as the sample used in the present\nexperiment; both samples exclusively comprised students of the University of Bamberg with a\nyears, our sample: see section above). The levels of the factor eyespots were implemented\nin a blockwise way with the order of levels being counterbalanced across participants. The\nlevels of the factor conformity pressure were varied within the blocks with eyespots being\npresent and absent, respectively. Each block comprised, in pseudo-randomized order, five\ntrials with upward and five trials with downward conformity pressure being exerted.\nApparatus\nAesthetic stimuli. As aesthetic stimuli, we used color photographs of 20 different objects, 13 of\nwhich were contemporary art objects, and 7 of which were everyday objects. A brief\ndescription of each stimulus and, in the case of art objects, artist, title, and year of\nproduction are listed in Table 1. The 20 stimuli were chosen out of a larger set of\nphotographed objects such as to avoid extreme average artistic quality ratings that might\nsuffer from ceiling effects. Thus, we chose stimuli that had received a medium rating with\nregards to this variable in a previous study by Haertel and Carbon (2014), more precisely an\naverage rating for artistic quality of minimally 3 and maximally 5 on a scale ranging from 1\n(very low artistic quality) to 7 (very high artistic quality). The 20 selected stimuli were grouped\ninto two parallelized subsets (Set A, Set B) of 10 stimuli each. To ensure comparable levels of\nartistic quality in both subsets, this was done by generating 10 pairs of stimuli with matching\nbaseline ratings for artistic quality (Table 2). Mean artistic quality ratings of the two subsets\nSetting used for manipulating presence of eyespots. The experiment was conducted in the\nBehavioral Lab at the University of Bamberg, which comprises an anteroom and two test\ncabins. The test cabins were furnished in a mirror-symmetric way with the permanent\npartition between the cabins being the axis of symmetry. Each cabin comprised a window\n4 i-Perception\nvis-a\n` -vis its entrance as well as two tables installed along the wall opposite the partition.\nThe seat next to the window in the left and right cabin, respectively, was used for testing.\nHere, a pin board (29.5 cm \u00c2 41.5 cm) was fixed to the wall above the tabletop, roughly at the\neye level of an average adult seated at the table. Several small notes (e.g., ``Close window\nwhen leaving the room!'') were attached to the pin boards in both cabins to make the\nparticipants believe that these boards were not part of the experiment, but used for regular\nTable 1.

The number of notes was the same in both cabins, but the\ncontent differed slightly. In the left cabin, a gray-scale close-up photography of a pair of male\neyes staring through a shutter was further added to the pin board (eyespots-present). The\nphotograph had a height of 110 mm and a width of 150 mm which is equal to the width of the\nwatching-eyes images used by Bateson et al. (2006). In the right cabin, the respective space on\nthe pin board was left blank (eyespots-absent). A view into the test cabins is depicted in\nFigure 1(a). Figure 1(b) shows the two pin boards.\nTest form used for exerting conformity pressure. We created and used a test form in which the\naesthetic stimuli were presented together with ratings of three would-be previous participants\n(cf. Madden, 1960). Our test form comprised an introductory instruction as well as two\nseparate rating booklets containing one of the two parallelized subsets of aesthetic stimuli\neach. The introductory instruction told the participants that they were part of the pre-study\nof another experiment, which required gathering ratings for artworks from a large art\ndatabase. The experimenter told each participant that they were the fourth out of a\ngroup of six raters judging a specific selection taken from this database. In each booklet,\none of the 10 aesthetic stimuli of the respective subset was printed on an individual page\ntogether with six scales to indicate the artistic quality of the presented object. Each scale was\nreserved for one of the (would-be) raters in the actual participant's group. In line with the\ncover story, in the first three scales, ratings had already been marked. This had been done by\nthe first author beforehand, using a different pen and marks of a specific size for each of the\nthree raters such that it looked as if different persons had already worked on the ratings. The\nTable 2. Baseline and ``Fake'' Artistic Quality Ratings for the Aesthetic Stimuli Used in the Present\nExperiment.\nBaseline ratings Fake ratings upward Fake ratings downward\nMatch\npair Set A Set B Mbase\nNote. The left part of the table shows the baseline ratings for the aesthetic stimuli used in the present experiment (10 per\nset; each line in the columns ``Set A'' and ``Set B,'' respectively, represents the average baseline of one specific stimulus\nobtained in a previous study). The ratings have been obtained and published by Haertel and Carbon (2014). Please note that\nwe have transformed the original ratings by multiplication with 9/7 as we did not use the 7-point scale of the earlier study\nbut a 9-point scale for assessing artistic quality. The columns ``Set A'' and ``Set B,'' respectively, indicate the transformed\nvalues. The middle and the right part of the table show the fake ratings that were presented to the participants as ratings\nmade by three other raters (made-up raters/``fake raters'' FR1, FR2, and FR3)--but were in fact made up in order to exert\nan upward (middle part of table) or downward (right part of table) conformity pressure on the participants. For reasons of\nbetter comparability, both stimuli of a specific match pair were combined with the same fake ratings. The arithmetic mean\nof the baseline, and the upward and the downward fake ratings, respectively, for each match pair is indicated by the columns\nMbase\n, Mfake\u00fe\n, and Mfake\u00c0.\n6 i-Perception\nactual participants were asked to use the next free (i.e., the fourth) scale to indicate their own\njudgment of artistic quality. The scale ranged from 1 \u00bc very low artistic quality to 9 \u00bc very\nhigh artistic quality. Our scale thus had a wider range than the 7-point scale previously used\nby Haertel and Carbon (2014) for gathering the baseline ratings. This allowed us to exert up-\nand downward conformity pressure on our participants' judgments while keeping the risk of\nfloor and ceiling effects low. Conformity pressure was exerted by shifting the averaged\nbaseline ratings for each of the 10 match pairs of aesthetic stimuli by two categories on\nthe 9-point scale. Concretely, we systematically selected the ratings of the made-up\nprevious raters so that their average equaled about the averaged baseline ratings of the\nmatch pair in question plus 2 (upward conformity pressure) or minus 2 (downward\nconformity pressure). If, for example, upward conformity pressure should be exerted and\nthe match pair had an average baseline of 4.6, the ratings of the would-be previous raters\nhad to result in an arithmetic mean of about 6.6. Accordingly, we chose, for example, the\nFigure 1.

For reasons of comparability,\nthe same fake values were taken for both stimuli of a specific match pair. Baselines and fake\nratings for the 10 match pairs of aesthetic stimuli are listed in Table 2. Up- and downward\nconformity pressure was induced for half of the 10 match pairs, respectively (i.e., for half of\nthe stimuli in each rating booklet). To prevent confounding effects, we systematically varied\nthe combination of specific stimuli with the direction of conformity pressure as well as the\ncombination of stimulus set with setting (eyespots-present vs. eyespots-absent) over the\nsample. Table 3 gives a systematic overview of the different combinations that were used\nand the number of participants tested under each of these combinations. The sequence of the\naesthetic stimuli in the rating booklets was pseudo-randomized (in sum, we had 32 different\norders that were used for the sample).\nQuestionnaires used for assessing person-related variables. To identify individuals with high or low\nexpertise, respectively, we assessed our participants' art expertise by means of several\nquestions concerning their direct contact with the arts (e.g., ``Wie oft haben Sie im letzten\nJahr Kunstausstellungen besucht?/How often have you attended art exhibitions last year?'';\n``Wie viele Bu\n\u00a8 cher u\n\u00a8 ber Kunst/Ku\n\u00a8 nstler besitzen Sie?/How many books about the arts or\nartists do you own?'').\nIn order to be able to control whether potential conformity effects with regards to\njudgments of artistic quality can also (at least partly) be traced back to social desirability,\nand whether it is further related to the two higher-order Big Five factors stability and\nTable 3.

The\nintroductory phase and the first test phase were realized either in the left (eyespots-present,\n\u00bc 24) or the right cabin (eyespots-absent, n2\n\u00bc 24) of the lab, and the second test phase was\nconducted in the other cabin. During the break, which was introduced to temporally separate\nthe test phases and to distract from the change of cabins, the participants were asked to come to\nthe anteroom of the laboratory. In the introductory phase, participants read the instructions\nand received the monetary compensation for taking part in the experiment. The money was\n10 \u00c2 10\u00a2). If the participants had any questions concerning the procedure, these were answered\nby the experimenter. In the first test phase, participants worked through the first rating booklet\njudging the depicted aesthetic stimuli one after the other, in the given order without time\nconstraints. During the break, the experimenter tested the participants' visual abilities via a\nSnellen eye chart and an Ishihara color vision test (short version); furthermore, the participants\nwere requested to fill in the personality and art expertise questionnaires. In the second test\nphase, they worked through the second rating booklet, just as they had done in the first test\nphase. At the end of the second rating booklet, after all ratings had been finished, they found an\nadditional short note asking whether they would like to spend part of the monetary\ncompensation they had received at the beginning of the experiment for a municipal social\nproject (Lebenshilfe Bamberg). They were instructed to put the according amount of money\n(ranging from E0 to E5 in steps of 10\u00a2) into an envelope lying on the table next to them and\nthen throw the envelope into a black box so that the experimenter did not know whether or\nhow much the individual participant had spent. We included the measure of donation behavior\nto enable a comparison with the results of previous studies that have shown an enhancing effect\nof eyespots on various pro-social behaviors such as donating (e.g., Keller & Pfattheicher,\n2011). Except for the introductory phase and the break, the participants were left alone to\nprevent potential confounding effects related to the presence of the experimenter who might,\ndespite any precautions, be perceived as watching or observing by the participants (concerning\nthe role of real potential observers with regards to eyespots effects; see, e.g., Ekstro\nParticipants took about 20 to 30 minutes to complete the entire experiment.\nResults\nIn order to test the impact of our experimental manipulations on judgments of artistic quality, we\nran a 2 \u00c2 2 within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors conformity pressure\n(upward, downward) and eyespots (present, absent). As dependent measure, we used the delta\nbetween our participants' judgments and the baseline rating. This is in line with the approach of\nMadden (1960), and further accounts for the fact that, in the present experiment, the fake ratings\nused for exerting conformity pressure were relative to the baseline.1 For each participant and\ntrial, the delta value was calculated by the formula \u00c1 \u00bc (participant's judgment \u00c0 baseline\nrating); accordingly, a positive delta value indicates that participants' judgments were higher\nthan the baseline, and a negative delta value indicates that participants' judgments were lower\nHesslinger et al. 9\nthan the baseline. Our results show significant main effects of conformity pressure, F(1,\nrespectively. There was no significant interaction of the two factors, F(1, 47) < 1, p \u00bc 0.6348,\nns. Judgments were significantly lower under downward conformity pressure (M\u00c1\nSD \u00bc 0.88) than under upward conformity pressure (M\u00c1\nvalues were negative on a numerical basis--in the case of downward conformity pressure, that is\nwhat we had expected, in the case of upward conformity pressure, however, we had expected our\nparticipants' judgments to be higher than the baseline.

The descriptive\ndata further show that the mere presence of eyespots reduced ratings of artistic quality (Figure 2).\nThe data assessed with the art expertise questionnaire showed that only one participant\nmet the criteria for high expertise, thus standing out from the remainder of the sample.\nThe latter was quite homogeneous with art expertise at low to medium levels.\nRecalculating the above analysis without the data of the expert participant did not lead to\nany changes in the reported results.\nPotential modulating impacts of the assessed personality variables were tested by means of\ntwo separate multiple linear regression analyses, one for the eyespots-present setting and one\nFigure 2.

As predictors, we included the following\nmeasures: the two higher-order factors of the Big Five defined by DeYoung et al. (2002),\nnamely stability (comprising emotional stability/inverted neuroticism, agreeableness, and\nconscientiousness) and plasticity (comprising extraversion and openness), and the two\ncomponents of social desirability according to Paulhus (2002), that is, self-deception and\nother-deception. All predictors were z-standardized. As dependent measure, we used the\ndelta between judgments of artistic quality made under upward conformity pressure minus\njudgments made under downward conformity pressure. Neither for the eyespots-present\nobtain a significant model; none of the predictors contributed significantly to explaining\nvariance in the dependent measure.\nIn a last step, we analyzed the donation data, assessed at the end of the second test phase.\nDonations were made in the eyespots-present setting by one half of our participants, and in\nthe eyespots-absent setting by the other half (Table 3). A two-tailed t test revealed that the\ntwo groups did not differ significantly with regards to the mean amount of money donated,\ngroups did not differ with regard to the probability of donating money either, z \u00bc \u00c01.485,\nDiscussion\nBourdieu (1968) defined art perception as a deeply sociological phenomenon. Other authors,\nsuch as Muelder Eaton (1995) and Mukar ovsky\n\u00b4 (2015), likewise pointed to the relevance of\nsociological and social factors with regards to aesthetic response and judgment. The present\nstudy is a first attempt to experimentally apply this notion to judgments of artistic quality, as\nopposed to mere preference ratings or impressions of beauty. We tested the impact of two\nspecific social factors, social conformity pressure and a sense of being watched, as induced by\nthe presence of eyespot stimuli, on judgments of artistic quality. Social conformity pressure\ndid modulate judgments of artistic quality. This finding, however, was restricted to pressure\nin the downward direction, meaning our participants gave lower ratings of artistic quality for\na stimulus, if would-be previous raters had unanimously judged this stimulus as being of low\nartistic quality. They did not give higher ratings, however, when the would-be previous raters\nhad unanimously judged the stimulus as being of high artistic quality. Such asymmetry would\nbe compatible with the results of Madden (1960) who tested the impact of social conformity\npressure on judgments of facial beauty, and found more pronounced effects of downward as\ncompared with upward conformity pressure. Madden argues that this asymmetry might trace\nback to a lowering of the participants' equilibrium point on the scale or continuum of artistic\nquality, which could be caused by the introduction of a social background and an increased\ndefensiveness in making choices, related to the more public nature of the situation. According\nto this rationale, downward conformity pressure, going in the same direction as the shift of\nthe equilibrium point, would be especially effective in the presence of a social background.\nNote, however, that the asymmetry could also be caused by differences between the reference\ngroup and the current sample. Following Madden (1960), we used baseline ratings from an\nexternal reference group. Although this reference group stemmed from the same participant\npool as the sample of the present experiment and had a comparable age-composition, it is not\nguaranteed that our participants would have given the same or similar baseline ratings as the\nreference group. This point is related to the potential subjectivity of aesthetic judgments in\ngeneral (cf. statistical differentiation of private and shared taste, Ho\nhigh proportion of private as compared with shared taste in judgments of abstract artworks,\nHesslinger et al. 11\nLeder, Goller, Rigotti, & Forster, 2016) and should be kept in mind as a limitation of the\npresent results.\nAnother aspect to be discussed is the size of the conformity pressure effect. It is likely that\nfor a wider range of stimulus material, the effect of conformity pressure might be smaller than\nthe very large effect found for the present stimulus set. We had selected 20 stimuli that had\nreceived medium ratings of artistic quality in a pre-study run by Haertel and Carbon (2014).\nTheir original stimulus set comprised 213 photographed everyday objects and contemporary\nart objects ranging from an ordinary cracked wine bottle to the Lobster Telephone created by\nSalvador Dali\u00b4 in 1936. Our set was not only smaller, but also more homogeneous with\nregards to artistic quality, as we had cut the lower as well as the upper tails of the\ncommon distribution. Therefore, it may not have provided a sufficient frame of reference,\nwhich might have led our participants to seek a more informative external frame of reference,\nthus paying particular attention to the would-be raters' judgments. Confronted with a more\nheterogeneous stimulus set that offers more of a frame of reference participants might be less\nprone to using such external, social information. A question more or less directly related to\nthis point is whether the conformity pressure or social influence at work in the present\nexperiment was rather informational or normative (cf. Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). As had\nbeen stated, a larger and more heterogeneous stimulus set would offer the participants a more\nrealistic and representative frame of reference regarding the range of artistic quality that\nartworks potentially have. Even participants without extended art knowledge or expertise\nwould thus have a more informed and less vague basis for their judgments than with the\nrestricted and homogeneous stimulus set of the present experiment, which would also render\nthem less dependent on using other raters' judgments as orientation. If, in this changed\ncontext, participants' ratings conformed less to those of the would-be raters, this would\nindicate that the conformity effect found in our experiment was based on informational\nrather than normative influence. If, however, the participants strongly conformed to the\nwould-be raters' judgments again, this would indicate that the found conformity effect was\nrather normative than informational. Still another question is whether the conformity\nexpressed in the participants' ratings reflects an actual change of their individual and\nprivate opinions or merely public compliance. One step to get some indication in a future\nstudy would be to reassess participants' judgments of artistic quality for the presented stimuli\nafter a certain delay, in the absence of conformity pressure.\nAgainst our assumptions, the presence of eyespots did not further strengthen the\nconformity effect--there was no interaction of the factors: The spread between judgments\nmade under downward versus upward conformity pressure was not increased in the eyespots-\npresent setting. Nonetheless, the presence of eyespots significantly affected judgments of\nartistic quality in terms of an overall downward shift (Figure 2). Panagopoulos and van\nder Linden (2017) recently reported that eye-cues can induce higher levels of negative\nemotions such as distress and anxiety. As individuals also refer to their own emotional or\naffective states when assessing the value of to-be-judged objects (cf. affect-as-information,\ne.g., Clore & Huntsinger, 2007), a negative emotion or affect can lead to devaluation. We\nsuppose that this might have been the path that led to the overall downward shift of artistic\nquality judgments when eyespots were present in our experiment. This might also explain the\ntrend why our participants numerically donated less money in the eyespots-present than in\nthe eyespots-absent setting. A crucial question that remains open, however, is: Why did\nvarious other studies find positive and enhancing effects of eyespots on pro-social\nbehavior? As Panagopoulos and van der Linden suggest, negative emotions elicited or\nincreased by the presence of eyespots may lead to pro-social behavior through triggering\nreputational concerns or fear of being sanctioned when violating social norms. In our\nexperiment, in contrast, the affect-as-information effect that negativized the aesthetic\njudgments might have overshadowed on the participants' donating decision and behavior.\nAnother possibility is that our participants were less responsive to the pro-sociality triggering\neffect of the eyespots than were participants in other studies, for instance, due to a weak\nchronic public self-awareness. As Pfattheicher and Keller (2015) showed, this variable\npotentially moderates the effect of eyespots or watching eyes on individuals' pro-social\nbehavior in that individuals with weaker chronic public self-awareness are less prone to\nshow pro-social behavior in response to the presence of watching eyes than individuals\nwith stronger public self-awareness.\nAs it seems, there is more but one possible path leading from the emotions or affect elicited\nby the presence of eyespots to specific affective, cognitive, or behavioral outcomes. The task is\nnow to systematically investigate whether the presence of eyespots is principally related to\nmore negative emotions or affect, or whether different kinds of eyespots maybe induce\ndifferent emotional or affective responses, and, more generally, whether (depicted) eyespots\nelicit responses comparable with or different from those elicited by real observers. In the\npresent experiment, the depicted eyes looked rather frightening, and likely conveyed a\nnegative affect or an unpleasing impression (which might have directly factored in with the\njudgments). In addition, it would be important to gain more insight into the factors that\ndetermine which path is taken from there to a final affective, cognitive, or behavioral\nmanifestation.\nConclusion\nIn the present experiment, we showed that social conformity pressure and a sense of being\nwatched induced by the mere presence of eyespots have an impact on judgments of artistic\nquality. The results underline the importance of including social factors in aesthetics research,\nthus adding to Makin's (2017) ``Gestalt nightmare.'' It becomes obvious that overly\nreductionist approaches to investigating aesthetic perception and experience will fall short,\nnot only due to the wholeness and Gestalt character of aesthetic or artistic objects but also\ndue to their embedding in a larger contextual and social Gestalt.\n"
