Knowledge is typically\ntacit and embodied in individual employees. Production processes are complex and in-\nvolve many different employees. The efficient organization of knowledge is therefore a\nkey ingredient for firms' success. It determines in which part of the production process\nemployees specialize, and to whom they turn for help if they encounter a problem that\nthey are not able to solve. Firms organize knowledge to match the problems that arise in\nproduction to the employees with the knowledge to solve them.\nA growing body of literature studies the organization of knowledge in firms. So far,\nthe literature assumes that the costs of communication between employees are constant\nthroughout a firm, so searching for help is equally costly for all employees. This assump-\ntion is a good approximation for the interaction of employees in small firms, active in a\nsingle location. However, it is likely to be overly simplistic in the study of large firms\nwith production plants in different locations, and it certainly does not apply to multina-\ntional firms, a very important subgroup of firms.1 Multinational firms have headquarters\nin their home country that communicate with plants in the home country and in for-\neign countries. The communication costs between the headquarters and the plants vary\nacross countries. Language barriers, time zone differences, and lack of face-to-face in-\nteraction render cross-border communication within a multinational production network\nmore difficult than communication within a domestic firm. Such communication frictions\nimpede the diffusion of knowledge within multinational firms and hamper the access of\nforeign plants to headquarter knowledge. Yet, the question of how multinational firms\noptimally organize knowledge in the presence of heterogeneous communication costs is so\nfar unexplored.\nThis paper provides the first in-depth study of the organization of knowledge in multi-\nnational firms. The paper develops a theory and confirms its predictions using novel data\non the flows of corporate transferees between countries and data on German multinational\nfirms.\nIn particular, I construct a stylized model of multinational firms in the spirit of\nthe knowledge hierarchies framework (e.g., Antr`\nCaliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012; Garicano, 2000). To keep the model analytically\ntractable and make the special features of multinational firms' organization transparent,\nI assume that the total knowledge level of firms is exogenously given and fix the number\n1The share of multinational firms in all firms is low, but they account for a substantial fraction of\naggregate output and employment: less than 1% of U.S. manufacturing firms are multinationals, but\nthey account for a third of manufacturing output and 26% of manufacturing employment (Bernard and\nof hierarchical layers. Firms consist of two layers: managers in the domestic corporate\nheadquarters and workers in production plants that can be located in the same country as\nthe headquarters, or a foreign country, or both. Firms endogenously choose the number\nof managers and workers, as well as the proportion of the total knowledge that they learn.\nTo derive the consequences of the organization of knowledge for firm behavior, I embed\nthe model of the organization of knowledge in a heterogeneous firm model of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) similar to Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004). I assume that firms are\nheterogeneous with respect to their total knowledge level. Each firm optimally organizes\nits knowledge. The organization of knowledge yields endogenous marginal production\ncosts that are heterogeneous across firms. This makes it possible to derive predictions on\nfirms' sales and on the self-selection of firms into FDI.\nThree results summarize the main insights on the optimal organization of knowledge\nin multinational firms. First, the optimal knowledge level at a plant increases with the\ncommunication costs between the plant and the headquarters. A multinational firm thus\nassigns more knowledge to its foreign plant than to its domestic plant to avoid the higher\ncross-border communication costs. Foreign plants master a higher share of the production\nprocess by themselves and approach the headquarters for help less frequently.\nSecond, multinational firms assign less knowledge to their headquarters than non-\nmultinational firms (i.e., purely domestic firms or exporters). This is because foreign\nplants use headquarter knowledge less frequently than if they were domestic plants due to\ntheir higher knowledge level. Consequently, the utilization rate of headquarter knowledge\nin multinational firms is lower than the utilization rate in non-multinationals. Providing\nknowledge at headquarters is costly, though. A multinational firm chooses to maintain a\nlower level of knowledge at its headquarters to balance its utilization rate and its costs.\nThird, the lower level of knowledge at the headquarters of a multinational firm also\naffects its domestic production plants: Multinational firms assign more knowledge to their\ndomestic plants than non-multinational firms. Multinationals' headquarters have less\nknowledge than the headquarters of non-multinational firms, so multinationals' domestic\nplants have to learn more knowledge to ensure the efficiency of production. The knowledge\nlevel of a multinational's domestic plants is typically still lower than the knowledge level of\nthe foreign plants, so the optimal knowledge levels at the different plants of a multinational\nfirm are heterogeneous.\nThe optimal organization of knowledge yields endogenous marginal production costs.\nThe marginal costs depend on the total knowledge level of the firm and home and for-\neign country characteristics because these variables affect the organization of knowledge.\nA special feature of multinational firms with foreign and domestic production plants is\nthat their marginal costs are interdependent across countries. This result arises because\nseveral production plants share common headquarters. In consequence, and consistent\nwith the empirical evidence (Antr`\nnon-multinational firms with the same marginal costs endogenously coexist in the home\nand the foreign country, unlike in models that assume firms to be heterogeneous in pro-\nductivity. Through the endogenous marginal costs, the organization of knowledge helps\nexplain distinct stylized facts concerning multinational firms.\nIt is well-known and empirically documented that multinational firms pay higher wages\nto their production workers than equally productive domestic firms (so-called \"resid-\nual multinational firm wage premiums\", see, e.g., Aitken, Harrison, and Lipsey, 1996).\nNonetheless, theoretical explanations are scarce. The organization of knowledge helps ex-\nplain the residual multinational wage premiums: Multinationals assign more knowledge\nto their production plants than non-multinationals, and this knowledge is remunerated.\nThe wage premiums vary with home and foreign country characteristics because these\naffect the organization of knowledge. The model thus explains why multinational wage\npremiums depend on the nationality of the acquirer (as found by Girma and G\u00a8\nThe self-selection of firms into FDI reinforces the wage premiums.\nLikewise, it is a well-known stylized fact that foreign sales and investment probability\ndecrease with the distance of a country from a multinational's home country (e.g., Antr`\nas\nand Yeaple, 2014).2 The organization of knowledge provides a novel explanation for this\nempirical regularity. The endogenous marginal costs increase with the communication\ncosts between a foreign plant and the headquarters of a multinational firm. Foreign sales\nand the probability of foreign entry correspondingly decrease with the communication\ncosts, that are correlated with geographic distance. The organization of knowledge thus\nhelps understand distinct features of multinational firms' behavior that have hitherto been\nanalyzed separately in the literature.\nIt is difficult to test the model predictions of the organization of knowledge as know-\nledge is intangible and typically proprietary. Knowledge flows within multinational firms\nare very hard to observe. To overcome this problem, I use unique data on the flows\nof corporate transferees between countries. The data are ideally suited to testing the\nmodel because multinationals use corporate transferees predominantly to transfer know-\nhow (e.g., Djanani, L\u00a8\nosel, and L\u00a8\nosel, 2003). To the best of my knowledge, I am the first to\nexploit corporate transferees as a visible reflection of firms' organization of knowledge. I\nfind that the proportion of corporate transferees in the employment of multinationals sys-\ntematically increases with the communication costs between two countries, as measured\nby the overlap in office hours, linguistic proximity, communication technology and flight\n2The pattern is often called the \"gravity of FDI\", see, e.g., Irarrazabal, Moxnes, and Opromolla (2013),\ntime. This finding is consistent with the prediction that the optimal level of knowledge\nat a foreign plant increases with the communication costs with the headquarters.\nUsing firm-level data for German multinational firms, I provide evidence consistent\nwith the interdependence of marginal costs of multinational firms across countries. Fur-\nthermore, I confirm the implications of the model for the geography of multinationals' sales\nand investments. In line with the model predictions, German multinationals have higher\nsales in countries that are characterized by lower communication costs with Germany,\neven after controlling for firm heterogeneity. The findings hold for regressions including\ngeographic distance and other trade cost measures, and are robust to adding further deter-\nminants of foreign sales, e.g., the quality of the investment climate. Sector-level analyses\nof the choice between exporting and FDI confirm that higher communication costs dis-\ncourage foreign investment: The ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to aggregate exports in a\nsector and foreign country decreases with higher communication costs between Germany\nand the foreign country, and increases with higher trade costs. The predictions for wages\nare not testable due to the lack of appropriate data.\nThe paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, the paper adds to the\nliterature on firms as knowledge hierarchies (Garicano, 2000; for a survey, see alsoGaricano\nand Rossi-Hansberg, forthcoming).3 Within this literature, the paper is closest to that of\nAntr`\nas et al. (2006), who study the formation of cross-country teams, a form of vertical\nFDI, and to the work on the organization of exporters by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg\n(2012) and Caliendo et al. (forthcoming). To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the\nfirst to study heterogeneity in the communication costs within firms and show that this\nheterogeneity can be useful to understand the specific features of the behavior of firms\nwith several plants.\nSecond, the paper provides new insights into the emergence of multinational firm wage\npremiums (for surveys of the empirical evidence, see Harrison and Rodr\u00b4\nMalchow-M\u00f8ller, Markusen, and Schjerning, 2013).4 By focusing on the particular fea-\ntures of the organization of knowledge, the paper proposes an explanation that is specific\nto multinational firms and distinct from the scale-related arguments used to explain ex-\nporter wage premiums.5 Previous theories on residual MNE wage premiums build on fair\n3For related work on information processing in organizations, see Radner (1993); Bolton and Dewa-\n4Many papers document that affiliates of multinational firms pay higher wages than domestic firms.\nThe wage premium decreases, but remains significant if regressions control for firm and industry charac-\nteristics, and account for the endogeneity of foreign take-overs. It tends to be higher in developing than\nin developed countries (e.g., Aitken et al., 1996; Hijzen, Martins, Schank, and Upward, 2013). Although\nworker heterogeneity accounts for part of the variation, it does not fully explain the multinational wage\npremium (Malchow-M\u00f8ller et al., 2013). Likewise, multinational parent companies pay higher wages than\ndomestic firms (Heyman, Sj\u00a8\n5In particular, the mechanism differs from that of Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012), who show\nwage preferences (Egger and Kreickemeier, 2013).\nThird, the paper contributes to the literature on the role of headquarter inputs for local\naffiliate production (Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Irarrazabal et al., 2013). Previous papers\nin this literature focus on the geography of FDI and extend the framework in Helpman\net al. (2004) to incorporate productivity-shifting mechanisms.6 This paper is distinct in\nmodeling the organization of multinational firms. It introduces a novel angle to the study\nof multinational firms as it endogenously determines how firms adjust the characteristics\nof their headquarters to their mode of internationalization.7 The paper thus provides a\ncoherent rationale for both the geography of FDI and MNE wage premiums.\nFourth, the paper adds a theoretical perspective to a series of predominantly empiri-\ncal papers showing that communication costs inhibit investments by multinational firms\nFinally, the paper contributes to the literature on the spatial diffusion of knowledge\n(for a comprehensive survey, see Keller, 2004). Investments by multinational firms are\nan important channel of international knowledge diffusion.9 The paper highlights that\nspatial communication frictions have a substantial impact on multinational firms. Conse-\nquently, investment promotion policies should not only improve the business climate inside\na country, but also reduce communication costs with source countries of FDI. Improving\nlanguage training, investing in the communication infrastructure and other targeted mea-\nsures to facilitate bilateral communication may prove useful in attracting FDI and thus\nbringing new technologies to a country.\nThe following section develops the model of the organization of knowledge and consti-\ntutes the core of the paper. Section 3 derives the model implications for multinationals'\nthat increased demand after trade liberalization leads to adjustments in the organization of knowledge\nthat explain why exporter wage premiums may emerge. The exporter wage premium is thus based on\nsize, whereas the multinational wage premium proposed here results because several plants share common\nheadquarters.\n6In Keller and Yeaple (2013), firms can either produce intermediaries locally but subject to efficiency\nlosses due to sector-specific communication frictions with the headquarters, or import intermediaries from\nhome, subject to transport costs. Irarrazabal et al. (2013) assume that headquarter inputs are required\nin the production process of affiliates, but decay due to iceberg-type transport costs. In both papers,\nthe marginal costs of production are independent across countries and do not vary with the production\nquantity.\n7Earlier papers assume that headquarter services are public goods, i.e., foreign affiliates can use\nthem without additional investment (e.g., Helpman et al., 2004; Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Irarrazabal\net al., 2013), or study the impact of constraints to the managerial capacity or span of control (e.g.,\nin a monitoring hierarchy.\n8Fort (2014) studies the impact of communication technology on the fragmentation of production\nprocesses.\n9Take-overs of domestic firms by multinational firms cause productivity increases in take-over targets\nthrough restructuring and the introduction of new technologies (Arnold and Javorcik, 2009). Knowledge\nspillovers lead to productivity gains for multinationals' suppliers and customers (Harrison and Rodr\u00b4\niguez-\nsales and the probability of investment, as well as their wage setting behavior. Sec-\ntion 4 describes why data on corporate transferees provide evidence on the organization\nof knowledge in multinational firms and presents the regression results. Section 5 con-\ntains the empirical evidence concerning the geography of multinational firms' sales, and\nexplains how the analyses allow discrimination between a knowledge based mechanism\nand a monitoring model. The last section concludes.\n2 The optimal organization of knowledge\nThe model economy consists of two countries, the home country j = 0 and the foreign\ncountry j = 1. The countries are populated by Nj\nagents each endowed with one unit\nof time. The analysis abstracts from capital market and contractual imperfections for\nEstablishing firms. Agents choose between supplying their time in the labor market\nand being entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur in the home country hires f units of labor in\nthe domestic labor market to pay the entry cost and establish a firm. The entry cost is\nthereafter sunk. Upon paying the entry cost, each entrepreneur receives the blueprint of\na differentiated product, a level of knowledge \u00af\nzi\nand the option to establish a corporate\nheadquarters. The knowledge level \u00af\nzi\ncorresponds to the state of a firm's technology.\nMathematically, knowledge is an interval ranging from zero to a firm-specific upper bound\n\u00af\nZi\n. \u00af\nzi\ndenotes the length of a knowledge interval [0, \u00af\nZi\n] (i.e., its Lebesgue measure).\nKnowledge levels \u00af\nzi\nfollow a known distribution G(\u00af\nz), which is symmetric in the two\ncountries. Given \u00af\nzi\n, the entrepreneur decides whether to establish headquarters and\nproduce, or instead to provide his time in the labor market.\nIf the entrepreneur decides to set up a corporate headquarters and produce, he spends\nhis unit of time providing leadership services in the headquarters. He decides whether\nto sell in the domestic country, the foreign country, or both, and whether to set up a\nproduction plant at home, in the foreign country, or in both countries. He hires em-\nployees in the headquarters and the production plant(s) and determines the organization\nof knowledge. These activities capture non-rival headquarter services similar to those\nin Markusen (1984) and the subsequent MNE literature. The entrepreneur receives the\nmarket wage as well as profits.11\n10Fuchs, Garicano, and Rayo (forthcoming) is an example of recent work on the emergence of hierar-\nchical structures similar to the knowledge hierarchies studied in this paper in a contracting framework.\n11The entrepreneur receives the market wage because his outside option is to supply time to the labor\nTo study the differences between the optimal organization of knowledge of domestic\nand multinational firms in a transparent manner, I restrict the parameter space so the\nentrepreneur always finds it optimal to hire employees in the headquarters and the pro-\nduction plant(s) (see Appendix A). All firms thus consist of employees in the headquarters\nand at least one production plant. The nh\nemployees hired in the headquarters are called\nmanagers and the nj\nemployees working in the production plant(s) are called workers.12\nThe term \"multinational firm (MNE)\" refers to any firm with a foreign production plant.\nTo simplify the exposition, section 2 focuses on a single firm established to produce output\nusing the knowledge level \u00af\nz. Section 3 extends the analysis to many firms indexed by i\nwith heterogeneous knowledge levels \u00af\nzi\n.\nProducing output. Production is a problem solving process based on labor and know-\nledge (as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012; Garicano, 2000). For each unit of labor\nemployed in production, problems are realized with a mass 1. Transforming labor into\noutput requires that the problems be solved. An agent solves a problem if it is realized\nwithin his knowledge interval. The problems are distributed according to an exponential\nprobability distribution function:\nf(z) = e-z\nwhere z  [0, ) refers to the domain of possible problems and  > 0 denotes the problem\narrival rate. A higher value of  implies that the mass of the probability distribution is\nconcentrated close to zero. Intuitively, this means that the production process is more\npredictable as problems in the tail of the probability distribution occur with lower prob-\nability, so more output can be produced with a given amount of labor and knowledge.\nThe output qj\nof nj\nunits of labor input with knowledge \u00af\nz can be calculated as nj\ntimes the value of the cumulative distribution function:\nqj\n= nj\nz).\nLearning and communicating. The firm's knowledge \u00af\nz is only useful if its employees\nlearn it. The underlying idea is that employees have to know how to employ production\ntechnologies to use them fruitfully. The knowledge can be learned by workers or man-\nagers.13 Learning knowledge is costly: Employees have to hire teachers to train them.\nmarket.\n12Managers are hired only at the headquarters. This assumption can be micro-founded by assuming\nthat the entrepreneur provides a moderation service in the headquarters that decreases the communication\ncosts between the headquarters and the plants below the level of communication costs that prevails in the\neconomy. Alternatively, unit constraints at the managerial level provide a micro-foundation for domestic\nmanagement.\n13The entrepreneur's time is fully used to provide leadership services.\nTeachers have to spend cj\nzk\nunits of time to train an employee to learn a knowledge\ninterval of length zk\n, k = h, j. In equilibrium, all agents receive the market wage wj\nper\nunit of time they spend working. Correspondingly, employees pay teachers the remuner-\nation wj\ncj\nzk\n. The entrepreneur remunerates his employees for the time they spend in\nproduction and for their learning expenses (as in Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg, 2012).14\nThe workers and the managers can communicate and leverage the potentially different\nknowledge levels. Communication is costly. As is standard in the literature (e.g., Bolton\nand Dewatripont, 1994; Garicano, 2000), the receiver of a message bears the communi-\ncation costs: he has to spend time listening. The communication costs, i.e., the amount\nof time that the receiver spends listening, depends on whether the sender is located in\nthe same or another country. The receiver in country j spends kj\n 0 units of time\nlistening to senders in country k. The assumption that 10\ncaptures the fact that there are frictions in cross-border communication compared to\ncommunication within a country.\nOrganizing knowledge. The entrepreneur designs the optimal organization of know-\nledge, i.e., he decides which part of the firm's knowledge is learned by the workers and\nwhich part is learned by the managers. Analogous to the results for firms with a single\nproduction plant in Garicano (2000), only workers supply labor and managers use their\ntime solely for communication because this specialization makes it possible to achieve\nthe optimal utilization rate of costly knowledge. The production process thus works as\nfollows. During each unit of time that they spend in production, the workers immedi-\nately solve the problems realized in their knowledge interval and produce output. The\nworkers communicate all problems that are not covered by their knowledge interval to\nthe managers. The managers solve all problems covered by their knowledge interval. Any\nproblems that are not covered by the knowledge intervals of either the workers or the\nmanagers remain unsolved.15\nBoth workers and managers are optimally characterized by knowledge levels that are\nuniform within each group and different between the two groups. Uniform knowledge\n14I follow Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) as their approach allows a straightforward general\nequilibrium analysis. The results of my paper do not depend on these specific assumptions. They merely\nrequire that the entrepreneur remunerates the employees for the learning of knowledge. One could\nalternatively assume that there are multiple time periods and that firms have to hire and remunerate\nemployees during a training period. Very low search costs then suffice to ensure that firms find it optimal\nto pay trained employees higher wages.\n15The model describes production processes in which workers execute routine tasks, and consult an\nexpert if non-routine problems arise. For example, manufacturing firms teach workers the common\nfunctionalities of machines, but employ experts for exceptional applications. In service firms, counter\npersonnel deals with common requests of clients, and refers them to specialists for particular needs. As\nGaricano and Hubbard (2007) show, the framework describes how law firms split tasks between associates\nand lawyers.\nlevels reduce communication time by diminishing the time spent searching for a competent\ncontact. Workers know that only managers may know solutions to problems that they\nthemselves cannot solve, and that it does not matter which manager they approach. To\nminimize the probability that costly communication is necessary, the knowledge level of\nworkers covers the solutions to more frequently occurring problems, whereas managers\nknow the solutions to problems that occur more rarely (Garicano, 2000). The knowledge\ninterval of workers correspondingly starts at 0, where the mass of the problem density is\nhighest, and ranges to an endogenous country specific upper bound Zj\ndenotes\nthe length of the knowledge interval of workers [0, Zj\n]. The managers learn to solve\ninfrequent problems. Under the parameter restrictions imposed above (see Appendix A), it\nis never optimal that the employees do not learn part of the firm's knowledge interval [0, \u00af\nZ].\nMore knowledge enables the firm to produce more output with a given amount of labor\ninput and thus decreases marginal costs. The upper bound of managerial knowledge and\nthe upper bound of the knowledge interval of the firm coincide. The knowledge interval\nof managers ranges from a lower bound Zh\nto \u00af\nZ. zh\ndenotes the length of this interval\n[Zh\n, \u00af\nZ].16 The entrepreneur chooses the knowledge levels zj\nand zh\nas well as the number of\nworkers nj\nand managers nh\n. By choosing zj\nand zh\n, the firm determines the upper bound\nof the workers' knowledge interval(s) Zj\nand the lower bound of managerial knowledge Zh\n.\n2.2 The optimization problem\nThe entrepreneur chooses the optimal organization of knowledge to minimize the pro-\nduction costs.

In contrast, a firm with two production plants additionally takes the production\nquantity into account in allocating knowledge.

Appendix B.2 contains the\nresults for the number of workers nj\nand managers nh\n.\nProof. See Appendix B.2.\nThe optimal organization of knowledge varies with the characteristics of the home and\nforeign countries. The firm may have a production plant in the home country, or in the\nforeign country, or plants in both countries. In this case, the knowledge constraint may\nbe binding at both plants, or binding at one and slack at the other plant. The country\ncharacteristics usually have similar effects on the organization of knowledge of the firm in\nthe different cases.\nMost importantly, higher communication costs j0\nalways increase the knowledge level\nof workers zj\nto reduce the number of problems that need to be communicated to the\nheadquarters.21 Managerial knowledge zh\ndecreases in the communication costs if the\nknowledge constraint zj\n= \u00af\nz - zh\nis binding, and is independent of the communication\ncosts if it is slack.\nHigher learning costs cj\nincrease the remuneration for every single worker, so it is\noptimal to reduce the knowledge they hold to mitigate cost increases. Correspondingly,\nmanagerial knowledge increases in the learning costs, except if the knowledge constraint\nis not binding. This result may seem counterintuitive at first. If the knowledge level of\nworkers decreases, the number of problems sent to headquarters increases. This entails\n21This prediction is consistent with empirical findings in Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012) who\nshow, using survey data, that plant managers have fewer responsibilities if the CEO is on site than if he\nis off site.\nan incentive to reduce the marginal costs of using the headquarters w0\nzh\n), which is\nachieved by decreasing managerial knowledge. This is possible as the knowledge constraint\nis not binding. Analogously, higher wages wj\ndecrease the knowledge level of workers and\naffect managerial knowledge in MNEs.22\nIf a larger quantity qj\nis to be produced, more workers need to be hired, each of\nwhom receives wj\nzj\n). A firm with two production plants can mitigate this cost\nincrease by adjusting the optimal organization of knowledge within its organization.23 The\nproduction quantity does not affect the workers' optimal knowledge level for firms with\nonly one production plant. An increase in the production quantity leads to a proportional\nincrease in the number of workers, which in turn causes a proportional increase in the\nnumber of managers. Similarly, wages scale the total costs of production for a firm with\nonly a domestic production plant. The effect of learning costs and communication costs\nis different. The entrepreneur faces a trade-off also if he produces at a single location:\nAssigning more knowledge to the workers increases the costs at the production plant, but\ndecreases the costs that accrue due to communication between workers and managers.24\nThe knowledge level of the workers and the knowledge level of managers both increase\nwith the total knowledge of the firm \u00af\nz. The problem arrival rate  has an ambiguous\neffect on the knowledge level of workers and managers. A higher value of  decreases the\nprobability that the workers do not find the solution to a problem for a given value of zj\n.\nThis sets an incentive to reduce workers' knowledge to save costs. At the same time, a\nhigher value of  implies that the number of managers responds more strongly to changes\nin zj\n. More managers need to be hired if zj\nis decreased, which dampens the negative\neffect of  on zj\n.\nTaking the first order conditions for managerial knowledge (9), (10), and (11), and\nthe comparative statics together reveals that the optimal level of managerial knowledge\nin MNEs is systematically different from the optimal managerial knowledge in domestic\nfirms.\nProposition 2. Multinational firms systematically choose lower levels of managerial\nknowledge than domestic firms if 00\n.\n22If the knowledge constraint is binding at both plants, the comparative statics only apply to foreign\nworkers' knowledge. Managerial knowledge decreases in domestic wages. The domestic workers' know-\nledge level thus increases. The domestic learning costs have an ambiguous effect on managerial and\ndomestic workers' knowledge.\n23MNEs with asymmetric worker knowledge levels always decrease the workers' knowledge zj\nwhen qj\nincreases. MNEs with symmetric knowledge levels decrease the workers' knowledge if zj\nis the country\nwith the higher ratio of wj cj\nand increase it otherwise. They thereby reorganize towards asymmetric\nworkers' knowledge.\n24The results for domestic firms match the results for single-establishment firms in Bloom, Garicano,\nProof. See Appendix B.3.\nIntuitively, MNEs choose a lower level of managerial knowledge than domestic firms\nto ensure an efficient utilization rate of knowledge. Workers in foreign plants have higher\nlevels of knowledge than if they were employed in a domestic plant because of the higher\ncross-border communication costs. They thus turn to headquarters for help less frequently\nthan workers in domestic firms. This decreases the utilization rate of managerial know-\nledge. At the same time, managerial knowledge is equally costly for domestic firms and\nMNEs. MNEs consequently decrease the amount of managerial knowledge to balance its\nutilization rate and its costs.25\nIn summary, section 2 shows that the optimal organization of knowledge in firms differs\nwith the firm's multinational status. MNEs assign systematically higher levels of know-\nledge to their workers and systematically lower levels of knowledge to their headquarters\nto avoid the higher communication costs with the foreign market. MNEs with two pro-\nduction plants may choose asymmetric knowledge levels for their domestic and foreign\nworkers. Their organization of knowledge depends on the foreign and domestic produc-\ntion quantities, whereas the production quantity does not influence the organization of\nknowledge in single-plant firms.\n3 The implications for MNEs' foreign sales and wages\n3.1 The self-selection of firms into foreign investment\nThe analysis of the choice between domestic activity, exporting, and FDI focuses on a\nfirm in the home country j = 0, and analogously applies to firms in the foreign country\nj = 1.

The location decision affects the optimal organization\nof knowledge, so each choice is associated with distinct endogenous marginal production\ncosts. Each option entails fixed costs in units of domestic labor. Firms can sell their\noutput in the home country at fixed costs fD (\"domestic firms\"). With additional fixed\ncosts fX, \"exporters\" ship output to the foreign country. Alternatively, the entrepreneur\ncan establish a foreign production plant solely to sell output abroad at fixed costs fI, and,\nfor additional fixed costs of fV , export output back to the home country. Such firms are\ncalled \"vertical MNEs\" what follows. To ship output from country k to country j = k,\nthe firm incurs iceberg transport costs  > 1.26 \"Horizontal MNEs\" serve consumers from\ntwo local production plants at fixed costs fD + fI.\nI assume that fI > -1fX > Q1P-1\nfI. It is thus never\noptimal to export but not to serve the domestic market, or to establish only a foreign\nproduction plant and not export back home.\nThe entrepreneur first determines the optimal production quantities and then chooses\nthe location(s) of the production plant(s) associated with the maximum resulting profits.\nIn what follows, optimal quantities are characterized by the mode, using the superscripts\nD for domestic firms, X for exporters, V for vertical MNEs, and I for horizontal MNEs.27\nProduction quantities and sales.

The foreign marginal costs 1\n(\u00af\nzi\n) of vertical MNEs increase with\nthe communication costs 10\n, the foreign wages w1\n, and the foreign learning costs c1\n.\nConsequently, foreign production quantities and sales are higher in countries with lower\ncommunication costs 10\n, lower wages w1\nand lower learning costs c1\n.\nProof. See Appendix C.1.\nAs equation (19) shows, the optimal foreign production quantity of a vertical MNE\nvaries negatively with the foreign marginal costs. The foreign marginal costs increase\nwith the communication costs 10\n, the foreign learning costs c1\n, and the wages w1\n, so the\nforeign quantity decreases with these country characteristics.\nProposition 4. The foreign marginal costs 1\n(\u00af\nzi\n, qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n, qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n) of horizontal MNEs\nincrease with the communication costs 10\n. They decrease with the foreign production\nquantity qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n) and increase with the domestic production quantity qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n). Analogously,\ndomestic marginal costs 0\n(\u00af\nzi\n, qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n, qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n) decrease with the domestic production\nquantity qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n) and increase with the foreign production quantity qI\n(\u00af\nzi\n). Consequently,\nthe foreign production quantities and sales are generally higher in countries with lower\ncommunication costs 10\n.\nProof. See Appendix C.2.\nExamining equation (16) indicates that the optimal production quantities of horizontal\nMNEs vary negatively with the marginal costs of production. However, the relationship\nbetween foreign country characteristics and the optimal production quantities is more\ncomplex than in the case of vertical MNEs. The marginal costs depend on the domestic\nand foreign production quantities due to their influence on the optimal organization of\nknowledge.\nA horizontal MNE chooses the optimal organization of knowledge in such a way that\nfavors plants with larger output: the larger the output of a plant j, the lower the marginal\ncosts j\nat the expense of higher marginal costs k\n, k = j. The foreign country charac-\nteristics thus have a direct and an indirect effect on the production quantities. Higher\ncommunication costs increase the foreign marginal costs of production. This exerts a\ndirect negative effect on foreign output. As the output affects the optimal organization of\nknowledge, higher communication costs also have an indirect positive effect on the foreign\nmarginal costs of production. The entrepreneur adjusts the organization of knowledge\ndue to the lower foreign production quantity, so the foreign marginal costs increase even\nfurther, depressing foreign output and foreign sales.28\nIt is more difficult to determine the impact of the foreign learning costs and wages on\nthe optimal foreign production quantities of horizontal MNEs because it is not possible\nto determine their effect on the foreign marginal costs of production in an unambiguous\nmanner. Foreign wages w1\nand learning costs c1\nhave a positive direct effect on the\nforeign marginal costs of production, but changes in wages and learning costs also affect\nthe organization of knowledge. These adjustments work against the direct positive effect,\ni.e., they decrease the marginal costs.29 The total effect of foreign wages and learning\ncosts on the marginal costs is thus analytically ambiguous.\nCommunication frictions between two countries arise due to foreign languages, time\nzone differences, or weak communication infrastructure. Some of these factors are cor-\nrelated with the geographic distance between two countries. The negative effect of the\ncommunication costs between the home and the foreign country on the foreign sales thus\nprovides a novel explanation for the stylized fact that MNEs' foreign sales decrease with\nthe distance between the foreign country and the home country of the MNE (e.g., Antr`\nas\nInvestment decision. Given the optimal production quantities, the entrepreneur chooses\nthe production mode (D, X, V , I) with the maximum total net profits.\nThe different production modes affect the organization of knowledge and thus the\nmarginal production costs. In particular, horizontal FDI leads to the reorganization of\nknowledge in the firm compared to the case with only one production plant. Unlike\nprevious models of horizontal FDI (e.g., Helpman et al., 2004), the marginal production\ncosts are interdependent across countries. Domestic (or, in the case of vertical FDI,\nforeign) marginal costs are affected by the decision to set up a second plant, so total net\n28The indirect adjustments through the production quantities lead to an analytically ambiguous overall\neffect of the foreign communication costs on the foreign production quantity only if the workers' knowledge\nlevels are symmetric and w1\n. The effect is always negative in simulations.\n29The adjustment effect is positive if workers' knowledge levels are symmetric and 00\n.\nprofits--domestic and foreign net profits--with two plants have to exceed the total net\nprofits of exporting or producing only abroad.\nThe choice between exporting and purely domestic activity only depends on whether\nthe foreign variable export profits exceed the fixed costs of exporting. The firm produces\nadditional output without adjusting its organization, so domestic profits are not affected.\n3.2 Aggregate exports and foreign sales\nThe general equilibrium analysis determines how MNEs' organization of knowledge affects\nthe aggregate foreign investment flows between countries. For simplicity, I assume that\nthe foreign and the domestic country are symmetric with respect to the learning costs\n= c and the population N1\n= N. This implies that equilibrium outcomes\nare symmetric in both countries. Serving both countries using a foreign production plant\ncannot be optimal as the positive effect of communication costs on marginal costs is not\noutweighed by differences in the other country characteristics. Firms either sell their\nproduct only domestically, or export it to the foreign market, or conduct horizontal FDI,\nand have to incur the fixed costs associated with each of these options. fD, fX and fI\nare such that domestic firms, exporters and foreign investors co-exist. As indicated at the\nbeginning of the theory section, each entrepreneur draws the blueprint of a differentiated\nproduct and a firm-specific knowledge level \u00af\nzi\nupon paying the sunk entry costs f. The\nknowledge levels follow a known distribution G(\u00af\nz) that is defined for an interval [\u00af\nzmin\n, \u00af\nzmax\n]\ndetermined by the parameter restriction in Appendix A.\nThe general equilibrium conditions determine the symmetric cut-off knowledge levels\nfor activity \u00af\nz, for exporting \u00af\nzX, and for FDI \u00af\nzI, the mass of firms M, wages w, and total\nincome Q. The domestic price index is normalized to unity, so the foreign price index is\nequal to one: P1\n= 1. The parameters , c, kj\nand N are exogenous. Appendix C.3\ncontains the proofs.\nThe question of interest is how the frictions in cross-border communication affect\nthe aggregate export and foreign investment flows. Three zero-cut-off profit conditions\ndescribe how firms self-select into the different options, based on the results of subsec-\ntion 3.1. The least productive active firm is indifferent between producing domestically\nand remaining inactive: its variable profits are equal to the fixed costs of production fD.\nThe first zero cut-off profit condition determines the knowledge level \u00af\nz of the marginal\nentrant as a function of wages w.\nwfD =\n\n\n(\u00af\nThe density of the knowledge levels of the active firms is \u00b5(\u00af\nz) = g(\u00af\nz)\nz)\n. The marginal\nexporter is indifferent between exporting and not exporting: the variable foreign export\nprofits are equal to the fixed costs of exporting. The second zero cut-off profit condition\ndetermines the exporting cut-off \u00af\nzX.\nwfX =\n\n\n(\u00af\nThe marginal MNE is indifferent between exporting and FDI. The net total export profits\nof exporting are equal to the net total profits earned from FDI. The multinational cut-off\n\u00af\nzI is determined by the third zero cut-off profit condition:\n\n\n(\u00af\nzI, qI\n(\u00af\nzI), w, qI\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\nzI, qI\n(\u00af\nzI), w, qI\n(\u00af\nzI), w)1- - wfI =\n\n\n(\u00af\nInspection of the zero-cut-off profit conditions shows that MNEs have a higher know-\nledge level \u00af\nzi\nthan exporters, which in turn are more knowledgeable than domestic firms:\n\u00af\nzI > \u00af\nzX > \u00af\nz. Manipulation of equations (24) and (25) permits to derive\n(\u00af\nzX, w) =\nfD\nfX\n\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\nz, w),\nso exporters have lower marginal production costs than domestic firms, as in Melitz (2003).\nAs the marginal costs 0\n(\u00af\nzi\n, w) strictly decrease with \u00af\nzi\n, \u00af\nzX > \u00af\nz results. Taking wages\nas given, an increase in  implies that the exporting cut-off knowledge level \u00af\nzX increases:\nIt is profitable to export to more distant destinations only for firms with lower marginal\ncosts.\n\u00af\nzI > \u00af\nzX results because the fixed costs of FDI are higher than the fixed costs of\nexporting by a factor of more than -1, so firms have to have a higher knowledge level to\ncarry out FDI profitably. Domestic profits decrease in the case of FDI as the headquarters\nare no longer tailored to domestic needs but balance domestic and foreign requirements.\nCompared to a model with independent marginal costs of production, the marginal costs\ncut-off is thus shifted downwards.\nGiven wages, the knowledge cut-off \u00af\nzI increases with the communication costs 10\nbetween the host country and the MNE's home country, and decreases with the trans-\nportation costs  between the home and the host country because export profits decrease\nwith  and profits from FDI decrease with 10\n.\nTo determine the other equilibrium variables, it is necessary to consider the remaining\nequilibrium conditions. Entrepreneurs enter up to the point at which the net value of\nentry is zero. The free entry condition is given by30\nwf =\n\u00af\nzI\n\u00af\nz\n\n\n(\u00af\nz, w)1- - w(1 + fD)dG(\u00af\nz)\n+\n\u00af\nzI\n\u00af\nzX\n\n\n(\u00af\nz, w))1- - w(1 + fX)dG(\u00af\nz)\n+\n\u00af\nzmax\n\u00af\nzI\n\n\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\n(\u00af\n-w(1 + fD + fI)dG(\u00af\nThe labor market clearing condition determines the number of firms M.

Equilibrium wages decrease\nwith higher transport costs  and communication costs 10\n, because they decrease the net\nvalue of entry. The decrease in wages dampens the increase in the export knowledge cut-\noff with transport costs and the increase of the FDI cut-off with communication costs. It\namplifies the negative effect of higher transport costs on the FDI cut-off, and leads to a\ndecrease in the export cut-off with higher communication costs. In sum, the export know-\nledge cut-off thus increases with transport costs and decreases with the communication\n30The free entry condition assumes a unique cut-off knowledge level for FDI. As both the export and\nFDI profits are strictly increasing and concave in \u00af\nz, several cut-offs may exist. The results hold, but are\nless tractable.\n31By symmetry, the demand for domestic labor from domestic MNEs and MNEs from the foreign\ncountry sum to the total demand for labor from a domestic MNE.\ncosts, and the minimum knowledge level required for foreign investment decreases with\nthe transport costs and increases with the communication costs. MNEs' aggregate foreign\nsales thus increase relative to aggregate exports if the transport costs rise, and decrease\nwith higher communication costs.\n3.3 Multinational wage premiums\nIn addition to the results for the geography of MNEs' investments, the model provides\nnovel insights into MNE wage premiums. Consistent with empirical evidence (e.g., Harri-\nson and Rodr\u00b4\nremuneration to workers than non-MNEs both in the home and the foreign countries.32\nThe wage premiums arise via two different channels: due to firm organization and due to\na selection effect.\nFirm organization provides a new and MNE-specific explanation for residual MNE\nwage premiums, i.e., for wage premiums paid by MNEs compared to non-MNEs with\nthe same observable characteristics such as sales. As outlined in section 2, MNEs choose\nan organization of knowledge with higher levels of worker knowledge than if they were\nnon-MNEs. The higher communication costs involved in foreign production increase the\noptimal level of knowledge at their foreign plant. MNEs therefore decrease managerial\nknowledge to balance the utilization rate and costs, and increase the knowledge level of\ntheir domestic workers.\nEmpirical studies typically compare MNEs and non-MNEs with the same observable\ncharacteristics. As the marginal costs decrease with total firm knowledge, a non-MNE\nwith the same marginal costs as an MNE has lower knowledge \u00af\nz than the MNE. This\nreinforces the difference in workers' knowledge levels. Thus, MNEs pay higher remunera-\ntion to workers than non-MNEs with the same marginal costs of production and the same\nsales.\nProposition 5 summarizes the results.\nProposition 5. Vertical MNEs pay higher remuneration to foreign workers than non-\nMNEs in the foreign country with the same marginal costs and foreign sales. Horizontal\nMNEs pay higher remuneration to domestic workers than non-MNEs in the home coun-\ntry with the same marginal costs and domestic sales if 00\n. They pay\nhigher remuneration to foreign workers than non-MNEs in the foreign country with the\nsame marginal costs and foreign sales if 00\n. The parameter\nrestrictions are sufficient, but not necessary conditions.\n32The model abstracts from contractual imperfections, which are relevant in understanding the evolu-\ntion of managerial wages (e.g., Marin, Schymik, and Tarasov, 2014). This section therefore focuses on\npredictions for workers' remuneration.\nProof. Follows from Proposition 2, see also Appendix B.3.\nInspection of the parameter restriction 00\nshows that the model pre-\ndicts residual MNE wage premiums both for developed to developed and developed\nto developing country FDI. Foreign wages and learning costs must not exceed domes-\ntic wages and learning costs by more than the friction in cross-border communication:\n. This includes the case w0\n, which is likely to apply to FDI from\ndeveloped countries to other developed countries. Learning costs are likely to be higher in\ndeveloping than in developed countries, for example due to lower literacy rates. Market\nwages are typically much lower. Wage premiums occur whenever the difference in market\nwages outweighs the difference in learning costs. Higher communication frictions increase\nthe likelihood that this is the case. The wage premium in the foreign country is higher\nthe greater c1\nis. Consistent with the empirical evidence (e.g., Aitken et al., 1996; Hijzen\net al., 2013), MNE wage premiums are thus predicted to be stronger for developing than\nfor developed countries. As the communication costs and relative wages and learning\ncosts are heterogeneous across countries, the model explains why wage premiums vary\nwith the nationality of the acquirer, as found in Girma and G\u00a8\nThe organization of knowledge is an MNE-specific explanation of MNE wage pre-\nmiums. The mechanism is reminiscent of but different from that of Caliendo and Rossi-\nHansberg (2012), who study exporter-wage premiums using a knowledge-hierarchy model.\nIn their framework, firms reorganize after an increase in output due to trade liberalization.\nIn contrast, the residual MNE wage premium stems from an organizational friction--\ndomestic headquarters for potentially multiple production plants--that is characteristic\nof MNEs.\nIn addition, the model features MNE wage premiums due to the self-selection of firms\ninto FDI. Only firms with a higher knowledge level \u00af\nz become MNEs.33 These firms pay\non average higher wages than non-MNEs to managers and workers, both in their home\ncountry and the foreign country, due to the positive effect of \u00af\nz on zh\n(see\nProposition 1). This wage premium does not stem from multinationality per se, but\nfrom a firm characteristic--knowledge--that favors FDI and leads to higher wages. The\nchannel is similar to explanations that attribute MNE wage premiums to differences in\nfirm characteristics between MNEs and non-MNEs, such as differences in labor demand\nvolatility or closure rates (see the survey in Malchow-M\u00f8ller et al., 2013).\nz firms select into vertical FDI whenever V\n(\u00af\n) < (fI + fD)w0\n.\n4 Corporate transferees and the organization of know-\nledge\nProposition 1 describes how the optimal organization of knowledge in MNEs varies with\nthe communication costs between a plant and the headquarters, as well as country and\nfirm characteristics. Its predictions are very difficult to test: Knowledge is intangible in\nnature, and typically proprietary. Within-MNE knowledge flows are thus very hard to\nobserve.\nTo overcome this problem, I use unique and novel information on the flows of corporate\ntransferees between pairs of countries. Corporate transferees are employees who MNEs\ntransfer from their regular place of work to operations of the MNE in another country for\na limited period of time, for example from the headquarters to a foreign affiliate.34 Trans-\nferring knowledge is the predominant motive for such within-MNE employee relocations\n(e.g., Bonache and Brewster, 2001). In recent surveys of Canadian and German firms,\nthree quarters of firms state that they use corporate transferees for knowledge transfer,\nmaking knowledge transfer their most frequent purpose (Canadian Employee Relocation\ncorporate transferees to transfer knowledge compared to 79.5% in the group with 501 to\nthus a visible reflection of the organization of knowledge in MNEs, and information on the\nflows of corporate transferees can be used to obtain evidence concerning the predictions\nof Proposition 1.\nProposition 1 shows that the optimal knowledge level at a foreign plant increases with\nthe communication costs between the plant and the headquarters. MNEs have two options\nto increase knowledge at a foreign plant through corporate transferees: Either they send\nknowledgeable employees to the foreign operations, or they train foreign employees at the\nheadquarters. In either case, Proposition 1 predicts that the observed share of corporate\ntransferees in MNEs' employment should increase with the communication costs between\n34Many countries provide special visa for corporate transferees, for example the US L-1 visa. Such\nvisas are typically available only for managers, specialists, and trainee employees (e.g., European Union,\n35The Canadian Employee Relocation Council (CERC) conducted a survey of Canadian firms in Octo-\nallowed multiple responses. Though firms also use corporate transferees for other purposes--to support\nthe establishment of foreign operations (65.3%) and improve communication within the firm (55.8%) in\nGermany, and to address talent shortages in the local labor market (61%) and for career development\n(43%) in Canada--Bonache and Brewster (2001) argue that only knowledge transfer consistently explains\nthe use of corporate transferees by MNEs, in particular why their use has increased despite advances in\ncommunication and information technologies.\nthe two countries.\nPrediction 1. The share of corporate transferees from country j in country k in MNEs'\nemployment increases with the bilateral communication costs jk\nbetween the two countries.\nObtaining evidence for Prediction 1 requires data on the bilateral flows of corporate\ntransferees and MNEs' employment, as well as measures for the bilateral communication\ncosts.\nCorporate transferees. The data on the corporate transferees come from Finaccord,\na market research company. The data contain information on the number of corporate\ntransferees from 25 source countries in 29 host countries, as well as selected source-host\ncountry pairs with significant expatriate populations for the year 2009. The information\ncovers transfer periods of between one and five years.36 The data are left-censored at 100,\nand do not distinguish between transferees sent from the headquarters to the foreign op-\nerations and foreign employees being trained at the headquarters. Appendix D.1 provides\na list of source and host countries.\nMNEs' employment. To measure bilateral FDI flows, I use data on employment by\nMNEs from country j in country k provided by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD). Although the data are comprehensive, they do\nnot contain information on all country pairs in the corporate transferee data. Bilateral\nemployment is available for 316 country pairs. Appendix D.1 provides details concerning\nthe variable construction.\nCommunication costs. To approximate the bilateral communication costs jk\n, I em-\nploy the overlap of office hours, the flight time between the main economic cities of the\nsource and host countries, several measures for the similarity of languages, and the in-\nternet bandwidth as a measure of communication technologies. I refrain from generic\nmeasures with various alternative interpretations, such as distance. Table 2 provides an\noverview of the model parameters, their empirical analogs, and the data sources.\nThe office hours overlap captures the fact that time zone differences inhibit communi-\ncation between the foreign operations and the MNEs' headquarters. Personnel at either\nlocation may have to work overtime to communicate. Using e-mail as a time-independent\n36Back of the envelope calculations using the survey data from Djanani et al. (2003) suggest that more\nthan two thirds of corporate transferees are transferred for periods longer than one year.\nTable 2: Overview of the model parameters, their empirical analogs and data sources\nParameter Definition Empirical analog Data source\nCommunication costs\njkt\nBilateral\ncom-\nOffice hours overlap Author using\nwww.timeanddate.com\nmunication\ncosts\nFlight time (between main cities/\nFrankfurt for Germany)\nwww.weltinfo.com, www.meine-\nflugzeit.de, main city: CEPII\nCommon official/native/spoken\nlanguage, linguistic proximity\nLinguistic proximity to German\n(only section 5)\nAuthor using CEPII, Ethnologue,\nInternet bandwidth (Mbit/s) ITU's ICT Indicators Database\nForeign country characteristics (only section 5)\nQjt\nMarket size GDP, GDP per capita IMF\ncjt\nLearning\ncosts\nAverage years of schooling Barro and Lee (2013)\nwjt\nWage Unit labor costs OECD\njt\nTrade costs Distance (population weighted) CEPII\nEffectively applied tariffs by sector WITS\nCosts of importing/enforcing con-\ntracts\nWorld Bank Doing Business\nAdditional controls (only section 5)\nInvestment Statutory tax rate IBFD\nclimate Rule of law/ regulatory quality/\ngovernment effectiveness/ corrup-\ntion\nWorld Governance Indicators\nFixed costs\nof FDI\nCosts/time/# procedures of start-\ning a business\nWorld Bank Doing Business\nBilateral investment treaty UNCTAD\nMonitoring\ncosts\nBilateral trust Eurobarometer 46.0\nThe table contains an overview of the model parameters, the variables employed in the empirical analyses\nand the data sources.\nmeans of communication only mitigates the problem because questions cannot be ad-\ndressed directly, which causes delay. The lower the office hours overlap, the higher the\nproportion of problems is that a foreign plant has to address on its own. The lower the\noffice hours overlap, the higher the share of corporate transferees should be. The variable\nis computed as max{10 - |time difference in hours|, 0}.\nThe flight time captures how quickly managers can travel to the foreign operations\nand address potential issues in the production process on site.37 Despite technological\nadvances, face-to-face communication is often indispensable to ensure successful produc-\ntion (e.g., UNCTAD, 2004). As higher flight times impede communication, the share of\ncorporate transferees should increase with the flight time.\n37I use Frankfurt for the flight times from and to Germany for consistency with section 5.\nLinguistic proximity captures difficulties in the direct communication between two\nindividuals. I employ the common official language indicator, the common spoken and\ncommon native language measures, as well as the linguistic proximity index from Melitz\nand Toubal (2014). \"Common spoken language\" measures the probability  [0, 1] that two\nrandomly chosen individuals from two countries speak the same language, and \"common\nnative language\" encompasses the probability that they share their native language. The\nvariable \"linguistic proximity\" captures the notion that it is easier to learn a language and\nto express oneself precisely the closer that language is to one's mother tongue. Undoubt-\nedly, international business communication often takes place in English. Still, non-native\nEnglish speakers tend to develop their own English dialect, strongly influenced by their\nnative languages and often difficult for native English speakers to understand (Gardner,\n2013). Linguistic proximity is therefore appropriate to capture frictions in communication\ndespite the use of English in business contexts.\nTo measure the quality of communication technologies, I use data on the internet\nbandwidth. Internet bandwidth is comparable across countries, which is not the case for\nprice data that may capture the unobserved quality of service. It is available for many\ncountries, and is arguably exogenous to bilateral FDI flows, unlike the telecommunications\ntraffic for example.\nSummary statistics are provided in Appendix D.2.\n4.2 Empirical specification\nI specify the following regression equation to provide evidence concerning Prediction 1:\nln\n# corporate transfereesjk\nEmploymentjk\n+ Employmentkj\njk\ndcens\n+ k\n+ j\n+ jk\nThe dependent variable is the share of corporate transferees in the total bilateral employ-\nment of MNEs in countries j and k. I take the log because the distribution of the share\nin levels is right-skewed. As indicated above, MNEs may send corporate transferees from\nthe headquarters to foreign operations, or train foreign employees at the headquarters.\nThe transferee data do not distinguish between the two modes, so I put the sum of em-\nployment by MNEs from the source country j in the host country k, Employmentjk\n, and\nemployment by MNEs from country k in country j, Employmentkj\n, in the denominator.\nThe explanatory variable of interest is jk\n, the communication costs between the two\ncountries. The expected sign of 1\ndepends on the measure of jk\n. dcens\nis a dummy for\nobservations with censored information on the transferee flows. j\n, k\ndenote source and\nhost country dummies to capture other determinants of the corporate transferee flows.\nProposition 1 shows that the host country learning costs and wages affect the knowledge\nlevel at an affiliate. However, it is difficult to derive their impact on the flow of corporate\ntransferees without information on whether the transferees are sent from headquarters to\naffiliates or vice versa. More generally, the host and source country fixed effects capture\nany factors that generally increase or decrease the number of corporate transferees sent\nfrom or to certain countries. jk\nis an error term.\nAlternatively, I could specify a Tobit model with the number of corporate transferees\nas the dependent variable. I prefer the above specification for two reasons. First, the\nspecification permits the use of source and host country fixed effects. A Tobit model\nwith fixed effects entails an incidental parameters problem: around 60 fixed effects are\nestimated from around 300 observations. Second, the employment of MNEs is a control\nvariable in the Tobit specification, resulting in simultaneity bias because the size of foreign\noperations depends on the organization of knowledge reflected in the corporate transferees.\nAppendix D.3 reports the results of Tobit regressions without fixed effects that are in line\nwith the main results.\n4.3 Descriptive evidence and regression results\nFigure 1 provides graphical evidence of the relationship between the share of corporate\ntransferees in total bilateral employment by MNEs and the communication costs. The\nfigure plots the mean share of corporate transferees for the quartiles of the communication\nFigure 1 lends strong support to Prediction 1: As expected, the share of corporate\ntransferees in the total employment of MNEs increases with higher bilateral communica-\ntion costs. The mean share of corporate transferees is lower for higher quartiles of the\ndistribution in office hours overlap. Likewise, it is lower for higher quartiles of the prob-\nability that two randomly chosen individuals speak the same language, and for higher\nquartiles of the log internet bandwidth. The mean share of corporate transferees is higher\nfor higher quartiles of the flight time.\nThe regression results in Table 3 confirm the graphical evidence. Columns 1 to 4\nseparately include the different measures for the communication costs. The regression\nresults imply that an overlap in office hours of one hour longer is associated with a\ndecrease in the share of corporate transferees of 12%. A one hour longer flight time\nleads to an 8% increase in the share of corporate transferees. The language variables\nall enter negatively. Only common spoken language and the linguistic proximity index\n38Figure 1 provides bar plots as scatter plots are difficult to interpret for three of the four communication\ncost measures: the office hours overlap is categorical, the internet bandwidth takes on a limited number\nof values as it is a host country characteristic, and the common spoken language variable has a point\nmass at 0. Appendix D.3 provides the scatter plot for the flight time.\nFigure 1: Share of corporate transferee flows vs. bilateral communication costs\nFigure 1a: Office hours overlap\nMean share of corporate transferees\nOffice hours overlap\nFigure 1b: Flight time\nMean share of corporate transferees\nFlight time\nFigure 1c: Common spoken language\nMean share of corporate transferees\nCommon spoken language\nFigure 1d: Log bandwidth\nMean share of corporate transferees\nLog bandwidth\nFigures 1a-1d plot the share of corporate transferees in total bilateral employment by MNEs for quartiles\nof communication cost measures: office hours overlap (1a), flight time (1b), the probability that two\nrandomly chosen individuals speak the same language (1c), and log bandwidth (1d). The figures include\nonly uncensored observations.\nare (marginally) significant, consistent with the ease of communication being decisive for\ncorporate transferee flows.39 Quantitatively, a higher probability of 10 percentage points\nthat two randomly chosen individuals speak the same language is associated with decrease\nin the share of corporate transferees of 5%. Linguistic proximity only takes four values:\n0.75 if two languages belong to the same sub-branch and not only the same branch of\na language tree--increases the share of corporate transferees by 7%. An increase in the\ninternet bandwidth of 10% leads to a 3% decrease in the share of corporate transferees.\nIn column 5, the significant covariates from columns 1 to 4 are jointly included. Signs\nare robust, but the significance levels decrease, reflecting that the different measures are\n39Jointly included in regressions, common official, native, and spoken languages capture different as-\npects of language: common native language captures the impact of common ethnicity and trust, common\nofficial language the effect of institutions, and common spoken language the ease of communication (Melitz\nTable 3: Regression results for the log share of corporate transferees\nSource country dummies N N N N N Y Y Y\nHost country dummies N N N N N N N Y\nDependent variable: log share of corporate transferees in MNE employment.

As overlap and flight time are most strongly correlated, the models\nseparately include the two variables and restore their significance levels. The common\nspoken language variable turns insignificant, but the significant linguistic proximity vari-\nable shows that language matters. Column 8 adds host country dummies. The bandwidth\ndrops as it is a host country characteristic. As before, only one of office hours overlap\nand flight time is significant. Common spoken language is insignificant, but linguistic\nproximity is negative and significant.\nIn summary, the findings confirm Prediction 1: The share of corporate transferees\nincreases with the communication costs. As corporate transferees are predominantly used\nfor knowledge transfer, the findings imply that MNEs assign higher levels of knowledge to\nforeign affiliates if their communication costs with the headquarters are higher, consistent\nwith Proposition 1.\n5 Communication costs and MNEs' foreign sales\nI use detailed firm-level data on German MNEs to obtain empirical evidence concerning\nthe model implications for the distribution of MNEs' foreign sales derived in section 3. I\naugment the data with sector-level export data. The data are uniquely suited to studying\nthe model predictions. Germany has long been one of the largest source countries of both\nexports and FDI worldwide: According to WTO and UNCTAD information, Germany\nwas the largest or second largest exporter in the world and held the fourth largest foreign\ninvestment position during the 1999-2010 sample period. The communication costs be-\ntween the home and the foreign country are the main driver of the model predictions, so\nthe empirical analyses put particular emphasis on them. The implications for wages are\nnot testable due to the lack of appropriate data.\nForeign sales. I use the German central bank's Microdatabase Direct investment (MiDi).\nThe database consists of a panel of yearly information on virtually the universe of foreign\naffiliates of German MNEs from 1999 to 2010. German residents are legally obliged to\nreport information on the financial characteristics of their foreign investments once these\nmeet the reporting requirements (Lipponer, 2009). The database contains detailed bal-\nance sheet information, including the sales, the number of employees, and the financial\nstructure of every affiliate. The data also include parent and affiliate sectors, mostly at\nthe two-digit level. From 2002 onwards, information on the domestic sales and the number\nof employees is available.\nI clean the data (see Appendix E.1 for details), and restrict the sample to majority-\nowned affiliates. The model applies to situations in which the parent is actively involved\nin the local production. This is unlikely if other shareholders own the majority of the\naffiliate. The great level of detail in the MNE data makes it possible to obtain evidence\nconcerning the model predictions for the distribution of foreign sales both at the firm and\nthe sector level.\nExports. I use data on German exports from BACI, a trade database provided by\nCEPII and containing cleaned trade information from the Comtrade database. The data\nare at the six-digit product level. The database does not contain firm information. I\ntranslate the product codes into two-digit sector codes using conversion tables from the\nUnited Nations Statistics Division to use the export data and the foreign sales data in\nsector-level analyses.\nCommunication costs and other covariates. I employ the same communication\ncost measures as in section 4, with the exception of linguistic proximity. The linguistic\nproximity variable in Melitz and Toubal (2014) only takes four values. The classification\nof languages by Ethnologue provides seven linguistic nodes for German, so I construct\na refined linguistic proximity measure as a function of the number of linguistic nodes\ncommon to German and each language spoken by at least 20% of people in the host\ncountry following Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009). I take the simple average in the case of\nseveral languages.40\nThe home country k is Germany for all MNEs in my sample. As the communication\ncost measures are mostly time-invariant, using host country fixed effects is not possible. I\ntherefore control for the other model parameters and potential omitted variables. Table 2\nprovides an overview of the model parameters, the empirical analogs, and the data sources.\nI use data on GDP and GDP per capita to measure variation in demand due to\ndifferences in the market size and income across countries. I measure the learning costs\nusing the average years of schooling41 and employ information on the unit labor costs to\nI employ data on the bilateral geographic distance, the average effectively applied\ntariffs in the parent sector, and the costs of importing and of enforcing contracts to\nmeasure trade costs. Taken together, these data cover many of the aspects of trade costs\nthat Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) list in their survey.43 To account for factors that\nmay influence sales but are not included in the model, I add measures of the investment\nclimate: the statutory tax rate and indicators on the rule of law, government effectiveness,\ncorruption, and regulatory quality.\nI take the logarithms of the covariates if their distribution in levels is skewed. Ap-\npendix E.2 provides summary statistics.\n40Specifically, I use # common nodes-7\n, slightly modifying the formula in Spolaore and Wacziarg\nIn unreported regressions, I use the public expenditure on education and PISA scores, and obtain similar\nresults.\n42I have experimented with the Occupational Wages around the World Database by Freeman and\nOostendoorp. However, its overlap with the MiDi database is limited. Data are available for only 20%\nof observations.\n43Data on cif/fib\u00advalues are not available for Germany, so the physical transport costs are difficult to\ncapture.\n5.2 Communication costs and the within-firm distribution of\nsales\nThe high level of detail in the MiDi database makes it possible to provide empirical\nevidence concerning the MNE-level predictions of the model. Propositions 3 and 4 show\nthat both horizontal and vertical MNEs' foreign sales decrease with the communication\ncosts between the headquarters and the foreign plant. This yields the second empirical\nprediction.\nPrediction 2. An MNE's foreign sales in a host country j decrease with the bilateral\ncommunication costs jk\nbetween country j and the home country k of the MNE.\nTo ensure consistency in the level of analysis of the model, I aggregate the affiliate\u00adlevel\ninformation at the parent\u00adcountry\u00adyear level. The data set contains 164,604 parent\u00ad\ncountry\u00adyear observations. I log-linearize the theory expression for sales pj\n(\u00af\nzi\n)qj\n(\u00af\nzi\n):\nln (pj\n(\u00af\nzi\n)qj\n(\u00af\nzi\n)) = (1 - ) ln \n+ ln Qj\n+ ( - 1) ln Pj\n+ (1 - ) ln j\n(\u00af\nzi\n). I\nestimate a reduced-form version of the resulting equation. Due to the non-linear nature\nof the original equation, it is not possible to provide a structural interpretation of the\nresulting parameter estimates.\nln foreign salesijt\nQjt\ncjt\nwjt\n+ Xjt\n+ it\n+ ijt\nThe dependent variable is the natural log of the foreign sales of firm i in country j and year\nt.

The MNE\u00adyear fixed effects absorb the effect\nof \u00af\nzi\nand, more generally, of any MNE characteristics that may influence performance\nacross destinations. To account for correlations of sales across countries and over time,\nthe standard errors are clustered by MNE.\nThe empirical approach controls for firm heterogeneity as source of differences in\nMNEs' performance across markets and thus mitigates bias due to the self-selection of\nfirms across countries. Nonetheless, the set of locations is a choice variable of the firm\nand does not vary exogenously. It is difficult to guarantee that the estimation conditions\nall information available to the MNE, so the results may be biased due to unobservable\nMNE\u00adcountry-specific factors. Subsection 5.3 addresses the issue of self-selection. It is\nnecessary to keep it in mind when interpreting the regression results in this subsection.44\nTable 4 presents the regression results for Prediction 2. The table displays seven specifica-\ntions. Columns 1 and 2 contain the model parameters: the communication and learning\ncosts, the wages, and the market size. The specifications are displayed separately because\nthe wage data are only available for OECD countries, so the sample size decreases once\nwages are included. Columns 3 to 5 add the trade costs. Columns 6 and 7 additionally\ninclude measures for the quality of the investment climate.\nTable 4 displays the number of MNEs, the number of country combinations, and the\nnumber of countries in the regression sample, together with the number of observations.\nThe number of country combinations is the number of distinct combinations of countries in\nwhich the MNEs in the sample are active. The number is decisive because the variation\nwithin MNEs across countries drives the regression results.45 The number of country\ncombinations exceeds the number of MNEs because MNEs change the set of investment\ndestinations over time.\nThe regression results lend strong support for Prediction 2. The office hours overlap\nhas a positive effect on foreign sales typically significant at the 5% or 1% level. The flight\ntime generally has a highly significant negative effect on foreign sales. The two measures\nare not always both significant, as they are strongly correlated, similar to the regression\nresults in section 4. At least one of the language variables has a significantly positive effect\nthrough specifications, except for column 5, where the sample size is low. Higher internet\nbandwidth significantly increases foreign sales. The coefficient is positive and of a similar\nsize, but insignificant in column 5, which probably also stems from the smaller number of\nobservations. Consistent with the model, the regressions show that communication costs\naffect MNEs' foreign sales, even if other determinants of foreign sales are controlled for.\nThe other covariates have plausible effects. Foreign sales tend to be higher in larger\ncountries as measured by log GDP. Log GDP per capita has a negative effect on foreign\nsales once labor costs are controlled for. Given the market size and the labor costs,\nMNEs tend to sell less in less populous countries. Lower learning costs, as measured\n44A natural experiment, i.e., an exogenous change in the communication costs with a subgroup of\ncountries, would help to address this problem. Estimating a Heckman selection model, as in Keller and\nYeaple (2013), is an alternative option, but would not permit a focus on within-MNE variation across\ncountries as using firm\u00adyear fixed effects is not possible.\n45Due to missing values for the covariates, not all the countries are always included in the regression\nsample.\nby higher average years of schooling, significantly increase foreign sales, as do lower unit\nlabor costs. In terms of the impact of learning costs and wages on foreign sales discussed\nin subsection 3.1, this finding implies that the direct negative effect of these variables is\nnot outweighed by indirect adjustments to the organization of knowledge.\nHigher trade costs--as reflected by higher distance and higher tariffs--increase for-\neign sales, consistent with a horizontal motive of foreign investment. The positive effect\nof distance is notable: Once communication costs are controlled for, distance does not\ndecrease foreign sales. The trade cost measures are all insignificant in column 5, which\nis most probably driven by the low number of observations as the costs of importing and\nenforcing contracts are only available for a relatively small number of countries and years.\nMNEs tend to sell more in countries with a higher statutory tax rate. This probably\nreflects the fact that higher sales are necessary to produce profitably despite the higher tax\nrates. MNEs also tend to sell more in countries with better governance. One coefficient\nis surprising: The rule of law measure enters as significantly negative. Taken together,\nthough, the investment climate measures still speak in favor of a better investment climate\nincreasing foreign sales.\nTable 4: Regression results: within-firm differences in log foreign sales across countries\nand parent\u00adyear dummies included. Dependent variable: log foreign sales per MNE, country, and year.\nCovariate definitions: see Table 2. # MNEs: number of MNEs. # country combinations: number\nof combinations of countries with MNE activity. Regressions include 105 countries in column 1 and\n5.2.3 Evidence of the interdependence of MNEs' sales\nThe comprehensiveness of the MiDi database also makes it possible to provide evidence\nconcerning the prediction that MNEs' sales are interdependent across countries.\nPrediction 3. An MNE's foreign sales in a host country j decrease with the production\nquantities at other investment destinations qk\n, k = j of the MNE.\nPrediction 3 is based on the second implication of Proposition 4: The sales of an MNE\nin different countries are interdependent because the affiliates share common headquarters.\nThe MNE organizes knowledge such that the marginal costs of production are lower the\nlarger an affiliate, at the expense of higher marginal costs in other locations. Consequently,\noutput in country k = j, ceteris paribus, has a negative impact on the sales in country j.\nProviding evidence regarding this prediction entails several difficulties. First, regress-\ning sales in j on sales in k is subject to endogeneity bias due to simultaneity. Second,\nfirms non-randomly establish and shut down affiliates. Finally, an MNE's output and\nsales depend on total firm knowledge. The model takes knowledge as given, but in prac-\ntice, MNEs may have an incentive to innovate if their affiliates grow. Thus, high sales\nin k may lead to high sales in j through adjustments in firm knowledge.\nTo address these issues, I focus on foreign affiliates of German MNEs in one foreign\ncountry. I choose France, because it yields the highest number of observations for the\nfollowing analyses. I follow the French affiliates from the first year in my sample and study\nwhether their sales growth is negatively correlated with the sales growth of their parents'\naffiliates in other countries. I focus on sales growth rather than sales in levels to take\naccount of the fact that high foreign sales may lead to adjustments in firm knowledge that\nincrease sales across countries. To address the simultaneity bias, I apply an identification\nstrategy proposed by Desai, Foley, and Hines (2009) and use GDP growth as an exogenous\ndeterminant of the sales growth in instrumental variable (IV) regressions. I instrument\nthe observed sales growth of an MNE in other countries with the GDP growth at the 1999\nlocations of the firm. Thus, the estimation is robust to non-random entry and exit.\nSpecifically, I estimate the following regression:\nSales growthi France t\nSales growthi j=France t\n+ s\n+ t\n+ uit\ni.e., I regress sales growth in France on sales growth at the MNE's other locations, and\na set of sector and year dummies s,t\n. I estimate two variants of the equation. First, I\nuse the difference in log sales in France as the dependent variable and the log difference\nof average sales at the MNE's other locations as the independent variable. I instrument\nthe latter with the log difference of average GDP at the MNE's 1999 locations. Second, I\nTable 5: Regression results: within-firm interdependence\n log sales Sales growth rate\nSpecification OLS IV IV IV\nInstrument \u00ad GDP GDP GDP per capita\ndummies included. Dependent variable: log difference of foreign sales in France per MNE and year in\ncolumns 1 and 2, sales growth rate in France per MNE and year in column 3 and 4.

The sales growth\nrates in France and other countries are the ratios of changes in sales between years to averages of the\nbeginning and end of period values.\ncalculate sales growth rates following Desai et al. (2009), and instrument the sales growth\nrates at the MNE's other locations using GDP growth rates and, to make them directly\ncomparable, the growth rates of GDP per capita.\nTable 5 displays the regression results. Higher sales growth at the other locations of\nthe firm is associated with higher sales growth in France according to the OLS regression\nin column 1. The magnitude of the coefficient is similar to the coefficients found in\nDesai et al. (2009). Column 2 presents the results of the IV specification that takes the\nendogeneity of the sales growth at the other locations due to simultaneity and due to\ninnovations in the knowledge level into account. Consistent with the predictions of the\nmodel, I find that higher sales growth at the other locations of an MNE is associated with\nlower sales growth in France. The coefficient is marginally significant with a P-value of\nThe results support Prediction 3: Higher growth at an MNE's other foreign locations\nis associated with lower growth in France. This finding may seem at odds with the finding\nof Desai et al. (2009), who show that higher foreign employment and asset growth are\nassociated with higher domestic growth in these variables. In fact, though, the different\nfindings are easily reconcilable within the model of the organization of knowledge in\nMNEs. On the one hand, Proposition 4 predicts that the sales of an MNE decrease\nwith the production quantities at the MNE's other location, consistent with Table 5. On\nthe other hand, foreign activity may lead to employment growth in the home country--\neven if the domestic production quantity decreases--because the MNE hires additional\nmanagers at headquarters. In addition, multinational parents may expand domestic assets\nand employment because foreign growth entails an incentive to innovate, as also pointed\nAlthough Table 5 thus supports the predictions of the model in this paper, it is im-\nportant to note that various forces may drive the results. Other than the organization of\nknowledge, financial or managerial constraints may lead to a negative association in sales\nacross countries (see, e.g., Manova, Wei, and Zhang, forthcoming; Yeaple, 2013). Unfor-\ntunately, disentangling the sources is not possible as it requires more detailed information\non MNEs' organization and activities.\n5.3 Communication costs, aggregate exports and affiliate sales\nThe effect of the bilateral communication costs on single MNEs, together with the model\npredictions on the self-selection of firms into foreign destinations, implies that communi-\ncation costs have an important impact on aggregate foreign investment flows.\nPrediction 4. The ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to aggregate exports in a host country j\ndecreases with the communication costs between country j and the home country k, jk\n.\nIt increases with the trade costs between country j and the home country k, jk\n.\nTo test Prediction 4, I aggregate the affiliate-level information on foreign sales in the MiDi\ndata at the country\u00adaffiliate sector\u00adyear\u00adlevel. I aggregate across affiliate sectors because\nthe model predicts that foreign affiliate sales and exports are substitutable. I merge the\naggregate affiliate sales data with the sector level export data from the BACI database.\nI specify a regression equation similar to Helpman et al. (2004) and Oldenski (2012):\nln\nAffiliate salessjt\nExportssjt\nQjt\ncjt\nwjt\nXjt\n+s\n+t\n+ sjt\nThe dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the ratio of total affiliate sales to\ntotal export sales in a sector s in country j and year t. The covariates of interest are\nthe bilateral communication costs j0t\nand the trade costs j0t\nbetween a foreign country\nj and Germany, country 0. The other covariates are defined as above. s\nis a vector\nof sector fixed effects that capture sectoral differences in the fixed costs of exporting\nand FDI, differences in the size dispersion of firms across sectors, and other sectoral\ncharacteristics that may affect the choice between exporting and FDI (for the impact of\nis a vector of year\nfixed effects. sjt\nis an error term.\nThe model predicts that higher communication costs have a negative effect and higher\ntrade costs have a positive effect on the ratio of affiliate sales to exports. One component of\nthe trade costs are information costs (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004). The measures\nfor the bilateral communication costs are likely to be correlated with the information\ncosts. In fact, both language and flight time empirically affect trade flows (e.g., Melitz and\nToubal, 2014; Hummels and Schaur, 2013), although Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein\n(2008) have shown that language predominantly affects the self-selection of firms into\nexporting. This introduces a bias against finding an effect from the communication costs\nbecause the negative effect of the communication costs on the aggregate foreign sales has\nto outweigh the positive influence of information costs on exports.\nThe sector-level regressions mitigate the bias due to the self-selection of MNEs into\nforeign countries that may be present in the MNE-level regressions. Aggregating over firms\nintegrates out random unobservables that affect both the performance and the investment\ndecision of firms. At the same time, the sector level regressions may still be biased if\nexports or foreign sales are zero for some sector\u00adcountry combinations: Observed zeros\nare non-random and result if no firm in a sector is sufficiently productive to invest in\nor export to a certain country (Helpman et al., 2008). I observe positive exports in all\nsectors to all foreign countries with a full set of covariates, so I do not need to account for\nself-selection into exporting. However, I do not observe positive foreign sales in all sector\u00ad\nforeign country pairs. I therefore adapt the two-stage estimation procedure in Helpman\net al. (2008) and estimate a selection equation for foreign investment using the costs, time,\nand number of procedures of starting a business and the existence of a bilateral investment\ntreaty as exclusion restrictions (see Appendix E.3 for details). I then insert non-linear\ntransformations of the predicted probability to conduct FDI in estimation equation (33).\nSpecifically, I insert the Mill's ratio and polynomials of the sum of the Mill's ratio and\nthe inverse predicted probability of FDI, as Helpman et al. (2008).\nTable 6 displays the regression results. Columns 1 to 3 contain the measures for the trade\ncosts, market size, learning cost, and wages, i.e., only known determinants of the export\u00ad\nFDI trade-off. Column 4 adds the communication costs. Columns 5 and 6 additionally\ninclude investment climate measures. Column 7 takes selection into foreign investment\nConsistent with the literature, higher trade costs--as reflected in greater geographic\n46The number of observations drops in column 7 because the costs of starting a business used as an\nexclusion restriction are only available from 2003, and all MNEs invest in all countries in three sectors,\nso it is not possible to estimate a selection equation including sector dummies for these sectors.\nTable 6: Regression results on the aggregate affiliate sales vs. exports by sector\nConstant, year, and sector dummies included. Dependent variable: log ratio of aggregate affiliate sales\nto aggregate exports in a sector, foreign country and year. Covariate definitions: see Table 2. Selection\ncorrection in column 7.\ndistance and higher tariffs--shift the decision between exporting and affiliate sales towards\naffiliate sales. The effects are significant, with the exception of column 3. Column 3 in-\ncludes the costs of importing and enforcing contracts as additional trade cost measures.\nThe costs of importing take up the effect of distance and tariffs. Higher costs of enforcing\ncontracts, although listed as trade costs in Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), have a\nstronger negative effect on affiliate sales than exports, most likely reflecting their correla-\ntion with the quality of the investment climate. Notably, the effect of the average tariffs is\nof similar size throughout the specifications, whereas the coefficient of distance increases\nsubstantially once the communication costs measures are included. This finding is consis-\ntent with the interpretation that distance picks up the effect of omitted communication\ncost measures in gravity regressions of foreign affiliate sales, which leads to a negative\ncoefficient of distance in the gravity regressions and a downward bias in the coefficients\nThe results for the impact of the communication costs strongly support the model\npredictions. A larger overlap in office hours increases the ratio of affiliate sales to exports.\nThe effect is highly significant and of similar magnitude throughout the specifications. A\nlonger flight time has the predicted negative effect on the dependent variable. The effect\nis insignificant if the specification accounts for selection into foreign investment, although\nthis is probably driven by a loss of precision reflected in the much larger standard error. A\nhigher probability of a common spoken language or higher linguistic proximity increases\nthe ratio of affiliate sales to exports. A common native and official language are mostly\ninsignificant, consistent with communication being the decisive driver of the effect of\nlanguage on foreign affiliate sales (see also the discussion in section 4). The positive effect\nof linguistic proximity in column 7 is particularly noteworthy: Helpman et al. (2008)\nfind that language does not affect exports once the selection of firms into exporting is\ntaken into account. In contrast, higher linguistic proximity increases affiliate sales even\nif the regressions account for the self-selection into FDI. This underlines the relevance\nof communication costs for MNEs. Higher internet bandwidth has a positive effect on\nthe dependent variable. Internet bandwidth has a positive effect on firms' self-selection\ninto foreign countries (see Table E.2 in Appendix E.3), but does not affect the ratio of\naffiliate sales and exports once the self-selection is accounted for. The regression results\nthus confirm that communication costs have a substantial effect on the aggregate foreign\ninvestment flows.\nConcerning the other covariates, GDP has a positive effect, as has the average years\nof schooling. GDP per capita and foreign wages have negative effects, all as in the MNE-\nlevel regressions. GDP is less significant and GDP per capita is insignificant in column 7,\nindicating that much of their effect in columns 1 to 6 is driven by the self-selection of firms\ninto exporting and FDI. Higher regulatory quality and lower corruption increase foreign\nsales relative to exports, which is plausible, but they are not robustly significant.\nIn summary, the estimates strongly support that communication costs are an impor-\ntant determinant of aggregate foreign sales and make a convincing case in support of the\ngeneral equilibrium implications of the model of the organization of knowledge in MNEs.\n5.4 The organization of knowledge vs. monitoring\nOne could be concerned that the empirical results capture the effect of monitoring and not\nthe effect of the organization of knowledge on MNEs' behavior, for example because the\ncommunication costs measures are correlated with monitoring costs. Two recent papers\nfind that investment in a plant increases after a new airline route between the firm's head-\nquarters and the plant location is introduced (Giroud, 2013), and that greater distance\nbetween the establishment and headquarters is associated with shorter establishment sur-\nvival (Kalnins and Lafontaine, 2013). Both articles attribute their findings to monitoring\nproblems and information asymmetries between firm headquarters and establishments.\nWhile I do not deny that monitoring is an important factor in firm efficiency, I would like\nto stress that monitoring does not fully explain the behavior of MNEs for three reasons.\nFirst, the data on corporate transferees provides direct evidence that higher communi-\ncation costs increase within-MNE knowledge transfers. Monitoring is not even mentioned\nas a motivation for the use of corporate transferees in the surveys of German and Canadian\nfirms.\nSecond, a monitoring model does not explain why MNE wage premiums emerge. In-\nstead, the predictions of monitoring-based models are at odds with the empirical evidence.\nAssume that the costs of monitoring vary across countries and that the cross-border mon-\nitoring costs exceed the within-country monitoring costs. Then, only firms with better\nmonitoring technology self-select into FDI. This implies that MNEs pay lower wages in\nthe home country than domestic firms: Firms with better monitoring technology are able\nto implement optimal effort levels with lower wage payments. This is at odds with em-\npirical evidence on home country wage premiums. Likewise, a monitoring model cannot\nexplain residual MNE wage premiums in the foreign country because it predicts that for-\neign affiliates and domestic firms in the foreign country with the same marginal costs pay\nthe same wages. Appendix F sketches a formal analysis of this argument.\nThird and finally, the bilateral communication costs have an effect on foreign sales\neven if the monitoring costs are controlled for by including bilateral trust as a proxy\nvariable in the regressions. Higher bilateral trust decreases monitoring costs and allows\nfirms to decentralize more easily (Bloom et al., 2012). Table 7 displays regression results\nincluding bilateral trust between countries from the Eurobarometer survey as a covariate.\nBilateral trust does not have a significant effect on the MNE-level distribution of sales\nor on the ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to exports. I obtain similar estimates for the\ncommunication costs, even though the number of observations is substantially reduced.\nThus, monitoring cannot explain the communication cost estimates in subsections 5.2\nIn summary, the empirical analyses provide convincing evidence in favor of the predic-\ntions in the model of the organization of knowledge in MNEs. Evidence concerning the\nflows of corporate transferees between countries confirms the prediction of the effect of\nthe bilateral communication costs on the organization of knowledge. MNE-level analyses\nsupport the predictions regarding the relationship between the communication costs and\nMNEs' sales, and the interdependence of sales across countries. The effect of the bilateral\ncommunication costs on aggregate foreign sales and exports is likewise consistent with\nthe model. Finally, the analyses confirm that alternative possible explanations, such as\nmonitoring, cannot explain the estimation results.\nTable 7: Regression results on the impact of bilateral trust\nMNE level Sector level\nClustered (robust) standard errors in parentheses in column 1 (column 2). + p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,\n p < 0.01,  p < 0.001.

Dependent variables: log foreign sales per MNE, country and year\nin column 1; log ratio of aggregate affiliate sales to exports in a sector, country, and year in column 2.\nCovariate definitions: see Table 2.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper provides the first systematic analysis of the organization of knowledge in\nMNEs. It shows that the optimal organization of knowledge in MNEs differs from the\norganization of knowledge in domestic firms: MNEs assign higher knowledge levels to pro-\nduction workers than if they were non-multinational. The knowledge levels of production\nworkers increase with the communication costs between the plant and the headquarters,\nand they are interdependent across countries. These features of the organization of know-\nledge in MNEs are useful in understanding why MNEs' sales and their probability of\nentry decrease with the distance of a country from the home country of the multinational\nfirm. They also explain why MNEs pay higher wages than equally productive domestic\nfirms in the home and the foreign countries, and why MNE wage premiums vary with the\nnationality of the parent firm. The paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence in\nsupport of the different aspects of the model using novel data on the flows of corporate\ntransferees between countries and data on German multinational firms.\nThe paper offers relevant insights for the design of policies aimed at promoting in-\nvestment and the diffusion of knowledge across countries. Creating well-paid, relatively\nknowledge-intensive new jobs is one of the main objectives of investment promotion efforts\n(Javorcik, 2012). The results of this paper generally support the presumption that employ-\nment in MNEs is likely to be more knowledge intensive and better paid than employment\nin domestic firms. In their efforts to reap these benefits, countries may be tempted to\nfocus on investing in targeted information campaigns and a good investment climate in\nterms of administration, governance, and the education of their workforce. As this paper\ndemonstrates, targeted foreign language training and good communication infrastructures\nmay be equally relevant in fostering FDI inflows as they facilitate multinationals' task of\nefficiently organizing knowledge across countries.\nAppendix\nA Parameter restriction\nAssumption 1.

The\nsame information has to be provided on branches or permanent establishments if their operating\nassets exceed the reporting threshold (Lipponer, 2009).\nI drop observations on 26,042 affiliates (7.9% of all observations) of investors that are govern-\nment institutions, private households, agriculture or mining companies and housing enterprises.\nI drop agriculture and mining companies because natural resources are decisive for their invest-\nments, but ignored in the theory and the empirics. I drop housing enterprises because they often\nreport sales of zero, even though they are not small, which would lead to measurement error in\nthe analysis.\nI restrict the data so that all observations meet a uniform threshold: I keep reports on\naffiliates with a balance sheet total of at least 5 million euro and a degree of participation of at\nleast 10%, or with a balance sheet total between 3 and 5 million euro, but parent stakes of at\nSome affiliates are reported several times, because an investor has direct and indirect inter-\nests, or because multiple investors hold participating interests in them. I therefore aggregate\ndirect and indirect participation shares per affiliate before restricting the sample to majority\nowned affiliates. 22,425 observations (8.3% of the remaining observations) drop from the sample\nbecause the affiliates are not majority owned. The resulting data set contains 246,394 affiliate\u00ad\nyear observations.\nE.2 Descriptive statistics\nTable E.1: Summary statistics, section 5\nThe table provides summary statistics of the variables employed in the empirical analysis. Variable\ndefinitions: see Table 2. pX, X  {5, 25, 50, 75, 95}: Xth percentile. The number of observations varies\ndue to differences in country coverage. Maximum possible number of observations: 164,604.\nE.3 Selection correction in sector-level regressions\nThe dependent variable in the sector level regressions is the log of the ratio of aggregate affiliate\nsales to aggregate exports in an affiliate sector, country and year. The model predicts that\nln\nAffiliate salessjt\nExportssjt\n= ln\n\u00af\nzmax\n\u00af\nzI\nQ\n\nj(\u00af\nz), w, q1(\u00af\nz), w)\ndG(\u00af\nz)\n- ln\n\u00af\nzI\n\u00af\nzX\nQ\n\nz, w)\ndG(\u00af\nz)\n= ln Q + ln\n\n+ ln\n\u00af\nzmax\n\u00af\nzI\nj(\u00af\nz), w, q1(\u00af\nz), w)1-dG(\u00af\nz)\n- ln Q - ln\n\n- ln\n\u00af\nzI\n\u00af\nzX\nz, w))1- dG(\u00af\nz)\n= ln\n\u00af\nzmax\n\u00af\nzI\nj(\u00af\nz), w, q1(\u00af\nz), w)1-dG(\u00af\nz)\n- ln\n\u00af\nzI\n\u00af\nzX\nz, w))1- dG(\u00af\nz)\n V I\nj\n- V X\nj\n,\nassuming symmetry of the foreign country j and the home country j = 0. The market size ln Q\ndrops from the equation. It is straightforward to show that the equation can be generalized to\nseveral and potentially asymmetric countries. The foreign market size then influences the trade-\noff because the foreign marginal costs 1(\u00b7) are a function of the foreign production quantity and\nthus of market size.\nHelpman et al. (2008) show that selection bias arises if V X\nj\n= 0 because \u00af\nzX > \u00af\nzmax, i.e.,\nbecause no firm has sufficient knowledge to export profitably. As there are positive exports in\nall sector-country-year pairs with a full set of covariates, such a selection problem does not arise.\nAnalogously however, selection bias arises if \u00af\nzI > \u00af\nzmax, i.e., if no firm has sufficient knowledge\nto invest abroad profitably.\nFollowing Helpman et al. (2008), it is possible to address this bias by estimating a selection\nequation for the self-selection of firms in sector s into FDI in country j in year t. I use the costs,\ntime and number of procedures of starting a business and the existence of a bilateral investment\ntreaty, denoted by the vector Zjt. I specify the selection equation\nsjt = Pr(Affiliate salessjt > 0|observed variables)\nand, as Helpman et al. (2008), include the following transformations of the predicted probability\n^\nsjt in the regression equation (33):\n^\nsjt =\nsjt))\n^\nsjt\n^\nsjt\nsjt) + ^\nsjt\n^\nsjt\nsjt) + ^\nsjt\n^\nsjt\nsjt) + ^\nsjt\n.\nTable E.2: Regression results, selection equation\nPr(Affiliate salessjt\nand sector dummies included.

Covariate definitions: see Table 2.\nF Sketch of a monitoring based model\nA MNE consists of nh managers in the headquarters in the home country, and nj production\nworkers in the home country j = 0 and the foreign country j = 1. Production workers input\nlabor to the production process and the managers supervise them.\nAs in Qian (1994), output depends on the effort level aj exerted by the production workers\nin country j: qj = njaj. Exerting effort is costly. The cost of effort is described by the function\ng(a) with g (a) > 0. The managers supervise the production workers to ensure that they exert\na sufficient amount of effort. I assume that the managers exert full effort ah = 1 in supervision,\nas in the literature. Production workers know that they are monitored at any point in time with\nprobability Pj.\nThe workers receive the wage wj if they are monitored and exert a sufficient amount of effort\naj  a\nj\nor if they are not monitored, and nothing if they are supervised and found to exert\ninsufficient effort aj < a\nj\n. It is necessary to assume that they receive the wage whenever they\nare not monitored because the firm would otherwise have an incentive to claim that they are\nnever monitored. If workers can prove whether they are monitored or not, the first best solution\nThe optimal wage is determined by the incentive compatibility constraint that\nwj - g(a\nj\n)  Pj \u00b7 0 + (1 - Pj) \u00b7 wj - g(aj) aj < a\nj\n,\nPj\ng(a\nj\n). Wages increase in the optimal effort level a\nj\nand decrease in the monitoring\nprobability Pj.\nThe firm chooses the country and firm specific optimal monitoring probabilities Pj and the\noptimal effort levels a\nto minimize the overall costs of production, which are made up of\nfactor input costs and monitoring costs. The costs j to monitor a worker vary by country. It is\ngenerally assumed that 1  0, so foreign workers are more costly to monitor. The monitoring\ncosts are influenced by the firm specific monitoring technology , where lower  corresponds to\na better monitoring technology. The cost minimization problem of a MNE is given by\n{Pj,a\nj\nnj(wj + jPj) + nh\ns.t. nja\nj\n qj j\nnh \nnjPj\nwj =\nPj\ng(a\nj\n)\nj\nThe remuneration of managers is normalized to 1.\nThe optimal effort levels are uniform across countries:\na\nj\n=\nj\n)\ng (a\nj\n)\nThe optimal monitoring probabilities are given by\nPj =\ng(aj)\nThe optimal monitoring probabilities thus decrease in the monitoring costs j, and increase in\nbetter monitoring technologies -1. Within firms, foreign workers consequently receive higher\noptimal wages, and the marginal costs of production are higher, in countries with higher cross\nborder monitoring costs. The mechanism is therefore suitable for rationalizing the within-firm\ndifferences in sales revealed in subsections 5.2 and 5.3.\nAs foreign marginal costs increase in j, only firms with better monitoring technolgies -1\nare able to profitably invest abroad. Consequently, the remuneration of domestic production\nworkers of MNEs is lower than the remuneration of production workers of domestic firms, as\n)\n2 decreases in  and w0 decreases in P0. Workers at foreign affiliates of MNEs\nand workers at domestic firms in the foreign country with the same marginal costs receive the\nsame wages. These implications are at odds with the empirical evidence.\nReferences\nAitken, B., A. Harrison, and R. E. Lipsey (1996).
