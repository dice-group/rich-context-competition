We illustrate the sensitivity of the effect of\nfertility on household consumption with respect to the equivalence scale in a unitary\nhousehold framework. Using the propensity score matching method, the analysis sug-\ngests that a newborn child decreases household consumption per person by 20 percent\nwithin four years. When the estimates of equivalence scales implied by the Indonesian\nsample are applied, the effect of a child on household consumption is still negative, but\nthe magnitudes are in the range of 20 to 65 percent of that found with the per-capita ex-\npenditure as a measure of consumption. Therefore, it is suggested that analysis based\non the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the effect of fertility on\npoverty at least because of neglect of the proper equivalence scale. Given that household\npreference for consumption of private goods such as children's education is negatively\nassociated with fertility, the test for household bargaining supports the model of the uni-\ntary household as a valid assumption for examining the relationship between fertility and\nhousehold consumption.\n1 Korea Development Institute, Cheongnyangni-dong Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-740, Korea,\n2 Otto-Friedrich-Universit\u00e4t Bamberg, Professur f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungswissenschaft, Lichtenhaidestra\u00dfe 11,\nE-mail: henriette.engelhardt-woelfler@sowi.uni-bamberg.de.\n3 Institute for Mathematical Methods in Economics (Research Unit Economics), Vienna University of Tech-\nnology, Argentinierstr. 8/4/105-3, 1040 Vienna, Austria and Vienna Institute of Demography, Wohlleben-\nE-mail: afp@econ.tuwien.ac.at.\n4 Universita Bocconi, Viale Isonzo 25, Department of Decision Sciences, 20135 Milano, Italy, Phone: +39\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 623\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\n1.

While the estimates of the effect of fertility on poverty range\nfrom being significantly positive to insignificant, a growing body of literature suggests\nthat the true relationship is likely to be more complicated than unidirectional (e.g. Bird-\nsall et al. 2001). The relationship between poverty and fertility is not unidirectional\nbut dependent on the stage of economic development (McNicoll 1997, Schoumaker and\nTabutin 1999). While in most contemporary developing countries this relationship is\npositive, a negative relationship has been reported within the poorest countries. The lat-\nter results are associated with lower reproduction capability and higher rates of infertility\namong extremely poor households (Lipton 1998, Livi-Bacci and De Santis 1998). Clearly\nmany factors that influence fertility also determine well-being. These include education,\nhealth services and family planning policies. In addition to joint causation, reverse causa-\ntion may also take place. Among poor households, the demand for children is high since\nthose households rely on their children's labor supply and often the child's support is crit-\nical when parents become old. Higher fertility in turn is associated with lower investment\nin education (i.e. demand for quantity rather than quality of children) and consequently\nlower earnings potential for children, which in turn fosters intergenerational transmission\nThe theoretical perspectives suggest various mechanisms linking fertility and poverty.\nEmpirical studies that tried to identify the causal relationship between fertility and poverty\nhave so far relied on aggregate level data and cross-sectional micro level data (cf. the re-\nview by Merrick 2001). With these data, it is difficult to provide robust causal information\nabout fertility and well-being because fertility and household income are jointly deter-\nmined. Recent longitudinal household surveys in developing countries that incorporate\nthe timing of fertility together with information on consumption expenditure, income and\nother measures of well-being allow researchers to identify the dynamic relation between\npoverty and fertility. So far, these data sets have not been used to study the link between\npoverty and fertility, which is the goal of this paper. In particular, we examine the Indone-\nsian experience for which we have excellent longitudinal information on both fertility and\nhousehold expenditure, together with a range of other background information.\nThe most commonly used measure of poverty is a dichotomous variable that indi-\ncates whether a household's consumption expenditure is below a certain poverty thresh-\nold level. Although this poverty measure is useful in comparing the standard of living\nacross countries or over time, its analysis cannot measure the magnitude of the effect of\nfertility on household consumption. Moreover, the thresholds are often set in an arbitrary\nway. Therefore, we examine the relationship between fertility and household consump-\ntion directly. It should be noted that the level of consumption is not the only measure\n624 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nof household welfare. In addition, parents may enjoy having children and children may\nmake the consumption of other goods more enjoyable. However, in light of the Mil-\nlennium Development Goals, set out by the United Nations, the materialistic measure of\nwelfare is clearly of interest.5 As a result, we examine here whether and how much having\nan additional child decreases household consumption.\nOne difficulty in establishing a relationship between fertility and household consump-\ntion is related to the measure of consumption (Ravallion 1996). As argued in Lanjouw and\nRavallion (1995) \"Despite extensive work on welfare measurement in economics, there\nis still no preferred method for making inter-personal comparisons across households of\ndifferent size and/or composition.\" For instance, a common measure of well-being at the\nhousehold level is expenditure per adult equivalent. However, assigning equal weight to\nall household members and overlooking economy of scale with household size ignores\nthe compositional and size effect of households on the measure of well-being. As shown\nin Lanjouw and Ravallion (1995) for Pakistan, the measure of poverty is sensitive to the\neconomy of scale parameter that is assumed. In this paper we investigate whether the\ncausal relation between fertility and household consumption is sensitive to two dimen-\nsions of equivalence scale frequently discussed in the literature: the weight of a child's\nconsumption relative to an adult's and the economy of scale (Banks and Johnson 1994;\nA further complication in verifying the relationship between fertility and poverty is the\nissue of measuring a variation of fertility that is exogenous with respect to the measures\nof well-being. Two approaches have been adopted in the existing literature. The first one\nis to use the context of a natural experiment such as samples of twins or the sex composi-\ntion of the first two children as an instrumental variable for fertility (e.g. Rosenzweig and\nWolpin 1980; Angrist and Evans 1998). Although these instruments are reasonably valid,\nRosenzweig and Wolpin (2000) note that this approach requires restrictions on the utility\nfunction (e.g. the separability of leisure and consumption, etc.). The second approach is to\nuse the residual from a fertility regression as a measure of unobserved fecundity (Rosen-\nzweig and Schultz 1985). Measuring female fecundity is certainly a useful approach, but\nthe result is less intuitive. As an alternative approach, we apply here a matching method in\norder to estimate the effect of an additional child on household consumption in the short\nrun. This approach assumes that the event of childbearing is independent of household\nconsumption given observable characteristics. However, our focus is on illustrating the\nextent to which the effect of fertility on poverty depends on the measure of equivalence\nscale under a reasonable estimation strategy, and we minimize any possible bias due to\n5 The first goal of the Millennium Development Goal is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.

However, the effect of fertility on con-\nsumption is highly sensitive to the choice of the equivalence scale. When we apply the\nestimated equivalence scale parameters with further assumptions on household welfare,\nthe magnitude of the effect of fertility on consumption is in the range 20 to 65 percent of\nthat found with the per-capita consumption. Therefore, it is suggested that the analysis\nbased on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the effect of fertility\non poverty at least because of the neglect of the proper equivalence scale. On the other\nhand, the household preference for consumption of private goods such as children's edu-\ncation is found to be negatively correlated with fertility. Further, the results of the tests for\nthe household bargaining process supports the framework of a unitary household model,\nwhich is a basic assumption for the analysis of equivalence scale.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the measure of\nhousehold consumption and summarizes estimates of the equivalence scale implied by\nthe data. The method of analysis is discussed in section 3. Section 4 describes the in-\nstitutional background, data and variables used in our study. The results on whether and\nin which direction fertility causes household consumption are presented in section 5. We\napply household consumption expenditure per person and investigate the sensitivity of\nthe results depending on the way in which household size and household composition\nare taken care of. Section 6 examines the effect of private goods share of expenditure\non fertility and the effect of bargaining power on the share of private goods in household\nexpenditure. In section 7 we conclude.\n2. Measuring household consumption\nThe most commonly used measure of welfare is household expenditure per person. A\ncritical issue when considering the effect of a new born child on household consumption\nis the definition of the equivalence scale (Lanjouw and Ravallion 1995). One approach\nis to directly estimate the cost of a child in terms of an adult's consumption (e.g. Deaton\n626 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nand Muellbauer 1986). A limitation of this approach is that the calculation is based on\nhouseholds of a specific demographic type. Therefore, the result is not directly applicable\nto households of various demographic types. Unlike developed countries where nuclear\nhouseholds are common, there are 67 different types of households in our sample with\nthe numbers of children and adults ranging from zero to ten and from one to twelve, re-\nspectively. Although, in principle, it is correct to calculate the cost of a child for each\nhousehold type separately, it seems more appropriate here to estimate the effect of a new-\nborn child in an average household.\nOne way of estimating the equivalence scale is to use a complete demand system and\nto estimate the equivalence scale for a particular type of household compared to a base-\nline household (e.g. De Santis and Maltagliani 2003). Our approach is to estimate two\nparameters of equivalence scale in a functional form, which can be applied to all house-\nholds with different demographic composition. It has the disadvantage of assuming a\nparticular functional form for the equivalence scale, but, at the same time, has an impor-\ntant advantage since it allows us to evaluate the effect of a birth on individual household\nconsumption, on average, under the equivalence scale implied by the data. The functional\nform is widely used, and in this sense we are in line with the majority of the previous\nliterature.\nThere are two dimensions of the equivalence scale to be considered: 1) the weight\nassigned to children relative to adults, and 2) the economy of scale in household con-\nsumption. We adopt a simple form of a welfare measure incorporating these dimensions,\nW =\nH\n(A + K)\nwhere H denotes total household expenditure, and A and K denote the number of adults\nand the number of children respectively. A measure of household consumption per equiv-\nalence scale, W, is the measure of household consumption when the cost of each member\nis taken into account. Therefore, if two households of different demographic character-\nistics have the same level of W, then it can be argued that they have the same level of\nwelfare. In equation (1), the weight for a child relative to an adult is , and the economy\nof scale is reflected through the parameter . Both  and  take values between zero\nand one. Using the expenditure per person as a measure of household consumption im-\nplies that a child consumes as much as an adult and that there is no economy of scale in\nconsumption of goods ( = 1,  = 1).\n7 We are aware that the functional form used in the paper is not the only one used, but this version is a frequently\nused specification in the literature (e.g. Banks and Johnson 1994; Koulovatianos et al. 2005).\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 627\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nSince estimating the equivalence scale requires a set of assumptions about the household\npreference structure, we first study the effect of a child on consumption expenditure for\ndifferent values of the equivalence scale ( = 1/2, 1;  = 1/2, 1), and then apply our\nestimates of equivalence scale to illustrate the range of the effect of a child on individual\nconsumption.\nOne way to estimate  and  in equation (1) is to use experimental data as in Koulo-\nvatianos et al. (2005). Given the lack of the data on direct compensation for an additional\nchild or an adult, we take an alternative approach using the Engel curve estimation as in\nDeaton and Muellbauer (1986).8 That is, under the assumption that the inverse of food\nshare of expenditure correctly indicates the welfare of household members, we calcu-\nlate the amount of consumption that is needed in order to compensate for the additional\nmembers of the household compared to the baseline household. A household with two\nadults is taken as the baseline, and the estimated equivalence scales for households with\ndifferent demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The estimation procedure\nis described in Appendix A. The second row in Table 1 states that a household with two\nadults and a child needs 126 percent of the consumption of the reference household in\norder to have the same level of welfare, suggesting that a child costs 52 percent of an\nadult's consumption.9\nIt is notable that the estimation procedure taken in the paper considers food as having\na private good aspect. This assumption is not against the finding by Deaton and Paxson\n(1998). They show that conditional on the per capita expenditure the food expenditure\nper person as a private good should increase as household size increases but that data\nsuggest the opposite. Since food having a public good aspect did not prove to be a good\nexplanation for their puzzle, our assumption seems to be reasonable with regard to their\nfindings.\nAs Blundell and Lewbel (1991) pointed out, the conditional demand equation can be\nused to identify the cost of living indices for different household compositions but not the\ntrue equivalence scale. Restoring the equivalence scale requires an identifying assumption\nsuch as independence of base utility, or the assumption that unconditional preference\norderings depend on demographics only through Barten scales. With this limitation, we\nuse the relative magnitudes of the costs of additional household members in order to\nestimate the parameters of equivalence scale.\n8 The Engel curve refers to the demand for a good (food in this case) as a function of income when the prices\nare fixed.\npercent of an adult's consumption using Engel's method.\n628 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nTable 1: Equivalence scale for different household types\nScale(S) Household type No. adults (A) No. children (K)\nNotes: 1) Data source: The 1993 Indonesian Family Life Survey.\n2) A child is defined as a household member under age 15.\n3) The estimation is conducted under the assumption that the inverse of food share of expenditure cor-\nrectly indicates the welfare of household members.\n4) The estimated scale indicates the amount of consumption (compared to that of the baseline household)\nneeded to make the household as well-off as the baseline household.\nGiven that there is a wide variety of household types in the sample, we run the fol-\nlowing non-linear regression to find a set of parameters of equivalence scale, using the\nequivalence scales for eight different household types as shown in Table 1. We do this\ninstead of estimating the equivalence scale for every household type separately.\nS = (A + K) + , (2)\nwhere S represents the estimated total equivalence scale, and  is an additional scale\nparameter. Because we have only eight observations for estimating the parameters of\nthe equivalence scale function, the estimates are often out of the range implied by the\ntheory. By introducing additional parameter of  we search for the range of estimates of\n and  satisfying the theoretical prediction. Although  is not identified, it should be\nnoted that the parameter  does not affect the comparison of two households of different\ndemographic types. The purpose of our study is not to estimate the exact equivalence scale\nfor a specific practical application (such as a tax policy) but to find a range of reasonable\nestimates of  and  that is implied by the data. The estimation procedure is that the values\nof  and  are estimated for a fixed value of . Then, we find a range of  that produces\nthe estimates of  and  between zero and one as indicated in Table 2. In the following\nsections, we estimate the effect of a newly born child on household consumption per\nequivalence scale for the range of the estimates in Table 2.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 629\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nTable 2: Estimated parameters of equivalence scale\n  t-ratio ()  t-ratio () Residual R2\nNotes: 1) Data source: Table 1.\n2) The estimation is conducted under the assumption that the inverse of food share of expenditure cor-\nrectly indicates the welfare of household members.\n630 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\n3. Statistical methods\nIn order to estimate the causal effect of fertility on material wellbeing, we apply a match-\ning approach based on the treatment effect literature following the counterfactual model\nof causal inference. This approach is based on the intuitively attractive idea of contrast-\ning the outcomes of a treatment group, Y1\n, with the outcomes of a `comparable' control\n, conditional on a set of characteristics of individuals, X. The outcome in this\nstudy is the household consumption expenditure per equivalence scale in 1997, and the\ntreatment is defined as the birth of a child between 1993 and 1997. The control variable,\nX, includes the observable characteristics of households in 1993. Differences in the out-\ncomes between the two groups are consequently attributed to the treatment, D. Matching\nmethods for estimating causal effects have several advantages. First, they make no as-\nsumptions about the functional form of the dependence between the outcome of interest\nand the control variables. Second, matching ensures that the control variables of interest\nin the treatment group are similar to those in the control group and, thus, only similar units\nare compared. Third, since fewer parameters are estimated than in a traditional regression\nmodel, matching may be more efficient. This can be especially important if samples are\nsmall.\nThe matching method is based on the identifying assumption that, conditional on X,\nthe outcome of the control group Y0\nis independent of the treatment D. Using the notation\nof Dawid (1979), the assumption of strongly ignorable treatment assignment\n\n D | X, (3)\nis sufficient to identify the mean effect of treatment on the treated, or ATT (Rosenbaum\nATT = E(Y1\nAssumption (3) produces a comparison group that resembles the control group of an ex-\nperiment in one key aspect: conditional on X, the distribution of Y0\ngiven D = 1 is the\nsame as the distribution of Y0\ngiven D = 0:\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 631\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nIn general, the households that experience the event of childbearing are likely to be differ-\nent from those who do not in many respects. Examples include educational achievement,\nworking status, preference for having children, and so forth. Thus a simple tabulation\nof the treatment and controls will most likely yield biased estimates of the treatment ef-\nfect. In other words, these differences are going to affect the total household consumption\nexpenditure, which induces a bias of the estimate due to selection. By matching the\nhouseholds based on a set of control variables, ATT in equation (4) corrects for the selec-\ntion bias due to the correlation between childbearing and the observable characteristics\nof households (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Strictly speaking, the matching method\ndoes not resolve any selection bias due to the unobservable characteristics (Heckman and\nRobb 1985). However, in so far as the observed variables used for matching also cap-\nture outcomes due to unobserved heterogeneity, this bias will be reduced. Hence, the set\nof variables included in the matching should be as extensive as possible, including both\nexogenous and endogenous variables. To further refine our estimates, we consider the\n) | D = 1)\nThe ATT in equation (6) is the so-called difference-in-difference estimator, and corrects\nfor the selection bias due to the fixed component of unobservable characteristics. That\nis, if the effect of the unobservable characteristics of a household such as the preference\nfor childbearing on individual household consumption is present in both 1993 and 1997\nand if its magnitudes are the same, it is removed in equation (6) as the change in the\noutcome variable is considered. It should be noted that the identifying assumption for\nATT in equation (6) has a weaker form implying that the change in the outcome of the\ncontrol group is independent of the treatment.\n\n D | X. (7)\nHowever, our analysis is still prone to selection bias due to the time-varying component\nof the unobservable characteristics.\nFor estimating the mean effect of treatment on the treated, many matching estimators\nhave been proposed that exploit assumption (7) for alternative matching methods. For\nall matching methods, the average treatment effect for the treated in equation (6) can be\n632 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\n| D = 1) =\niT\nwi\n\n-\njC\nWi,j\n\nthat is, the average (weighted by wi\n) of the differences between the events, Y1i\n, of the\ntreatment group T and the events, Y0j\n, of the control group C weighted by Wi,j\n. The\ndifferent matching algorithms differ in the construction of the comparison weights, Wi,j\n.\nTraditional matching methods pair the non-treated with the treated persons that are\n`close' in terms of X using different metrics, e.g. caliper matching of different widths,\nMahlanobis distance matching, or kernel-based matching. In practice (i.e. with samples\nof typical size) it is often difficult to match on high dimensional X. Instead it is easier\nto do the matching based on individuals' probability of treatment, or in other words the\npropensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). We define P(X) as the propensity score\nwith P(X) = P(T = 1 | X). If the balancing property\nD \n X | P(X) (9)\nis satisfied, i.e. X and D are independent conditional on P(X), observations with the\nsame propensity score must have the same distribution of observable and unobservable\ncharacteristics independent of treatment status. In other words, for a given propensity\nscore, exposure to treatment is random. A theorem of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)\ndemonstrates that if assumption (7) is satisfied, then\n\nprovided 0 < P(X) < 1, so that there is a positive probability that the events D = 1\nand D = 0 occur. This insight shows that matching can be performed on P(X) alone,\nprovided that the balancing property (9) holds.\nPropensity scores are implemented in the matching techniques by defining the close-\nness of propensity scores and the control variable X in different ways. Since estimates\nare sometimes sensitive to the choice of matching technique, we implement several ap-\nproaches. In particular we apply nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, kernel\nmatching, and stratification matching based on the propensity score (Becker and Ichino\n2002). With nearest neighbor matching, each member of the treatment group is matched\nto a non-treated unit using the closest propensity score. With radius matching, the treated\nunits are only matched with non-treated units within a pre-specified range around their\npropensity scores. With kernel matching, the propensity score of each treated unit is\nmatched with the kernel-weighted average outcome of all non-treated units.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 633\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nFinally, with stratification matching, the range of variation of the propensity score is di-\nvided into intervals such that within each interval, treated and control units have on aver-\nage the same propensity score.\n4. Institutional background and data\n4.1 Background and data description\nIn many developing countries we observe that fertility declines often come along with re-\nductions in poverty. Indonesia is perhaps the most striking example of this pattern. Over\nthe last four decades, Indonesia has experienced unprecedented economic growth together\nwith a dramatic fertility decline. Table 3 shows that the real GDP per person increased by\nmore than three times over the period 1970 to 1995, and total fertility rate fell by around\n50% over the same period. This dynamic nature of the socio-economic change combined\nwith a large population and its vast geographical diversity has attracted considerable inter-\nest among demographers and policymakers alike. We focus on the period between 1993\nand 1997, which is at the end of the fertility transition and before the Asian Financial\nTable 3: Total fertility rate and GDP per capita in Indonesia\nPeriod TFR GDP per capita\nNotes: 1) Source of TFR: World Population Prospects: The 2000 Revision, Vol. I, United Nations Population\nDivision (requoted from World Resources Institute)\n2) Source of GDP per capita: World Development Indicators 2004, The World Bank.\n3) GDP per capita is in constant 1995 US dollars, and indicates the value in the last year of each period.\n10 The field work of the second wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS2) was conducted between\nAugust and December of 1997. Although there had been a modest increase in the exchange rate for that period,\nthe real financial crisis took off in January 1998. Frankenberg et al. (2003) also point out that the growth rate of\nprices and wages in Indonesia started to jump in January 1998. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that\nthe IFLS2 was not severely affected by the financial crisis.\n634 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nOur study is based on data from the Indonesian Family and Life Survey (IFLS). The\nfinancial crisis. The second wave of the IFLS was conducted shortly before the event. We\ndo not use any of the waves after 1997 in order to prevent estimates from being driven\nby the financial crisis. The IFLS is of exceptional quality and is ideal for the purpose\nof constructing a quasi-experiment of the type implemented here, as the survey contains\nextensive questionnaires on a range of aspects of household economy covering a period of\nsteady economic growth. The survey has been conducted by RAND Corporation in col-\nlaboration with UCLA and Lembaga Demografi, University of Indonesia (Frankenberg\nand Karoly 1995). The sample is representative of about 83% of the Indonesian popula-\ntion and contains over 30,000 individuals living in 13 of the 27 provinces in the country.\nIFLS1 has 7,224 households, and subsequent waves targeted all the split-off households\nas well as all the original households previously interviewed. The response rate for the\nIFLS2 was 94 percent of the original sample (Frankenberg and Thomas 2000). The survey\ncontains a wealth of information collected at the individual and household levels, includ-\ning multiple indicators of economic well-being such as consumption, income, and assets.\nIt also includes information on education, migration, labor market outcomes, marriage,\nfertility, contraceptive use and health. Information on relationship among co-residents\nand non-co-resident family members and inter-generational mobility are included as well.\nAnother outstanding feature of the IFLS is the quality of information provided at the com-\nmunity level. The panel has information concerning the physical and social environment,\ninfrastructure, employment opportunities, food prices, access to health and educational\nfacilities, and the quality and prices of services available at those facilities.\n4.2 Control variables\nOur unit of analysis is the household. 6,742 households were interviewed in both waves.\nAfter dropping observations that have missing values for relevant variables, the final sam-\nple consists of 4,852 households.

Household consumption expenditure and fertility\nThis section presents our estimates of the effect of a new born child on household con-\nsumption using the average treatment effect model. The estimation is conducted in two\nstages. The first stage involves estimating the probability of receiving the treatment, in\nthis case, having a child born between two waves is estimated. In the second stage, the\naverage treatment effect is estimated by comparing households with and without the treat-\nment that have similar propensity scores.\nSince the main purpose for probit estimation is to construct a set of variables that can\nbe used as a basis for matching households, the specification includes an extensive set of\nvariables representing a household's demographic characteristics, educational attainment\nand working status including the head's characteristics. However, there still remains an\nissue of unobservable characteristics such as cultural norms that might affect female la-\nbor force participation and fertility. The identifying assumption for the matching method\nis that the treatment (i.e. to have a newborn child between 1993 and 1997) is indepen-\ndent of the characteristics observed in 1993 including female working status and female\neducation. This assumption is not testable, and it is true that in the presence of unobserv-\nable characteristics such as cultural norms, two households identical with respect of all\nthe variables except the treatment assignment may be different in a way unobserved by a\nstatistician. Therefore, we try to minimize the bias in matching households by including\nas many variables as possible, including endogenous variables, and by including quadratic\nterms and interaction terms of those variables.\nTable 5 presents the results of estimating a probit model for having a child between\n1993 and 1997 with a set of variables satisfying the balancing property. Among the de-\nmographic variables, the age of previous children is an important determinant in addition\nto the number of previous children to explain a further childbearing. The households that\nhave more children under five face a higher likelihood of a new birth as the household\nhead ages. When there are more children aged 10 to 14, a household is less likely to\nexperience a birth and the tendency is mitigated as the number of children of 10 to 14\nincreases. When more generations live together, a household has higher chance of having\na birth.\nThe household head's characteristics turn out to be an important predictor for new\nchildbearing. As a household head becomes older, a household is more likely to have\na newly born child, and this tendency becomes stronger as the head gets older. Muslim\nhouseholds are associated with a higher chance of having a birth, whereas those heads\nwho worked in the previous year are associated with a lower chance. The educational\nlevel of household head is negatively correlated with childbearing only when the head is\nfemale.\n638 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nExplanatory variables Coefficients Std.

The fact that higher female education is correlated with\nchildbearing suggests that female education reflects higher income in the context of In-\ndonesia.\nRegarding the working status of household members, the only significant variable is\nthe number of men working, which is positively associated with a new birth. This again\nsuggests an income effect where higher labor income leads to more children.12\nTable 6 presents the effect of a newly born child on expenditure in a household using\nthe matching method described in Section 4 for the whole sample. The outcome is the\ndifference in the household real monthly expenditure per equivalence scale.13 A child\nis defined as a household member of age below fifteen. When the expenditure per per-\nson is used as a measure of individual household income, as in the first column, a newly\nborn child has a significant negative impact on expenditure per person. Using the nearest\nneighbor matching method, the households with a new born child between the two waves\nexperienced a decrease in consumption per person by 7,600 Rupiah, or 20 percent of con-\nsumption per person in 1997. This implies a substantial impact of fertility on household\neconomy. Other matching methods produce similar results in terms of magnitude.\nWhen a child is counted as half of an adult, as in the second column, the ATT is\nsignificant and negative, and the magnitude is in the range of 4,200 to 4,800 Rupiah. This\nis around 40% less than the per-capita reduction in expenditure. Although this result is\nexpected, the level of change is surprising. The cost of a child is calculated to be 52% of\nthat of an adult based on the comparison of the baseline household and the household of\ntwo adults and one child in Table 1. Therefore, the assumption that the weight of a child's\nconsumption is one half is not totally unrealistic. The point is that the effect of a new\nborn child on the individual household consumption can decrease by 40% when a child\nconsumes a half of what an adult consumes.\n12 Strictly speaking there is no theoretical justification for having the number of adults working rather than the\nproportion of them as an explanatory variable. In principle the number and the proportion convey the same\ninformation. However, we are careful in introducing nonlinear variables in the specification because those\nvariables seem to be hard to interpret for the marginal effects. Moreover, the specifications with nonlinear\nvariables tend to make the balancing property unsatisfied. Therefore, we stick to the linear specification.\n13 If a birth took place near the time of the survey in 1997, then the consumption expenditure might be measured\nbefore the birth (thereby measuring the outcome before the treatment). To address the issue, we conducted the\nfollowing analysis dropping from the treatment group the households whose newly born child is measured as\nzero years of age in 1997. The qualitative result remains the same as presented in the Table 6.\n640 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nTable 6: Effect of fertility on household expenditure\nper equivalence scale I\nEquivalence scale Cons. per Case A Case B Case C\nperson\nMatching method n(T) n(C)\nNotes: 1) The dependent variable is the difference in real expenditure per equivalent scale between 1993 and\n2) Standard errors (S.E.) are computed using bootstrap.\n3) 179 households with more than one newborn child were dropped.\n5) n(T) and n(C) denote the size of treatment group and controlled group, respectively.\n6) * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.\nNext, the role of economy of scale is examined. The third column in Table 6 deals\nwith a case where the economy of scale parameter is one half with a child consuming as\nmuch as an adult. The ATT is still negative but not significant. The magnitude of the ATT\nper-capita expenditure. That is, the effect of new childbearing on individual household\nconsumption almost disappears when the parameter of economy of scale is one half. Un-\nder this assumption, the expenditure of a household with three adults increases by 32%\ncompared to a household of two adults at the same level of utility.14 The estimated equiv-\nalence scale in Table 1 suggests that the expenditure increases by 16% from a household\nof two adults to that of three adults. Therefore, the size of one half as a parameter of\neconomy of scale is reasonable.\n14 The calculation is based on the comparison of\n\n\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 641\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nWhen both the relative weight of a child and the economy of scale parameter are set to\nbe one half as in column (4) of Table 6, the ATT becomes positive but insignificant. The\nresult is well expected from columns (2) and (3), but it is still surprising that the individual\nhousehold consumption can increase even after a new birth under a different equivalence\nscale. When the significance of the estimates in Table 6 is considered, the exercise at least\nsuggests that the negative effect of a new birth on individual household consumption can\ndisappear for some range of realistic values of the equivalence scale. 15 16\nNext we estimate the effect of a child on household consumption applying the es-\ntimates of the equivalence scale obtained in Table 2. The results are presented in Ta-\nble 7. The first column is the case where expenditure per person is used as a measure of\nhousehold consumption. The effects of a newly born child on consumption per estimated\nequivalence scale in the other columns are all negative although the estimates in column\n(3) and (4) are not precisely estimated. The magnitudes of the ATT are in the range from\n20 percent to 65 percent of that estimated when the per-capita expenditure is used as a\nmeasure of consumption. Since the estimates of both equivalence scale parameters in Ta-\nble 2 are between 0.5 and 1, the ATT in column (4) of Table 6 serves as an upper bound\nof the effect of a birth on individual household consumption. On the other hand, when\nit is used as a measure of individual consumption, the expenditure per person is likely to\nexaggerate the effect of a new born child on individual household consumption at least by\n15 Given the huge geographical diversity in Indonesia, one might expect a systematic difference between rural\nand urban samples due to the differences in relative prices or in the child care cost. However, it is found that\nthe patterns of estimates with different equivalence scales in rural and urban samples are similar to that from the\ntotal sample.\n16 One observation is notable. The average treatment effect estimated using nearest neighbor matching method\ntends to be greater than the other estimates in both sub-samples. Further, the estimates seem to be ranked in the\norder of nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, kernel matching, and stratification matching. However, to\nour knowledge, no studies are able to verify that there is a systematic difference in the magnitudes of the average\ntreatment effect from different matching methods.\n642 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nTable 7: Effect of fertility on household expenditure\nper equivalence scale II\nEquivalence scale (ES) Cons. per Implied Implied Implied\nMatching method n(T) n(C)\nNotes: 1) The dependent variable is the difference in real expenditure per equivalent scale between 1993 and\n2) Standard errors (S.E.) are computed using bootstrap.\n3) 179 households with more than one newborn child were dropped.\n5) n(T) and n(C) denote the size of treatment group and controlled group, respectively.\n6) * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.\n6. Private expenditure on child and intra-household bargaining\nThe finding of the previous section has implications on the relationship between fertility\nand the expenditure on private-public goods. Our results indicate that fertility affects\nhousehold consumption differently depending on the assumption about the economy of\nscale and the relative weight of a child consumption to that of an adult (see Table 6).\nThese findings in turn, imply that the characteristics of household consumption is likely\nto affect fertility.17 In particular, the composition of the expenditure on private and public\ngoods may reflect the price of having a child. For example, the share of private goods\nsuch as children's education in household expenditure can be interpreted as indicating a\n17 We owe this section to two anonymous referees, who suggested adding the discussion on fertility, the con-\nsumption of public-private goods and the intra-household bargaining.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 643\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nhousehold's preference for quality of a child. The larger share of educational expenditure\na household has, the less likely it is to give birth. We test this hypothesis using a probit\nmodel as used in Table 5. As a measure of the expenditure on private goods, three vari-\nables are used: share of educational expenditure, educational expenditure per person and\neducational expenditure per child.18\nThe results are displayed in Table 8. The basic specification in column (1) shows\nthe result similar to that of Table 5. Most variables representing household characteristics\nand provinces are abbreviated in order to keep the focus on educational expenditure. Total\nhousehold expenditure per capita does not exhibit any significant impact on fertility in the\nsample of all the households, whereas a positive income effect is found for the group of\nhouseholds with any child in column (4).\nTable 8: The effect of educational expenditure on fertility (Probit Model)\nDependent variable: Index for (1) (2) (3) (4)\nhaving a newly-born child All All All HH with\nShare of educational expenditure - -0.864 - -\nlog Educational expenditure - - -0.084 -\nlog Educational expenditure - - - -0.072\nNotes: 1) Standard errors are in parentheses.\n2) * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.\n3) The unit of observation is a household.\n4) All the explanatory variables denote the values in 1993.\n5) 179 households with more than one newborn child were dropped.\n6) Household characteristics and province dummies are included in all specifications.\n18 The educational expenditure as a part of the information on consumption expenditure is measured at the\nhousehold level, and it is not separated for adults' education and children's. Therefore, both results with the\neducational expenditure scaled in terms of per capita and per child are presented below.\n644 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nColumn (2) of Table 8 indicates that a household spending more on education is less\nlikely to give birth as expected. The implied marginal effect suggests that one percent\nchange in educational share of expenditure is associated with a quarter percent change in\nthe probability of giving birth between 1993 and 1997. The absolute level of educational\nexpenditure per person also has a negative effect on the likelihood of having a new child\nas in column (3). Using the educational expenditure per child as a measure of the educa-\ntional expenditure generates the similar result, where only households with any child are\nconsidered (column (4)). The changes in probability of giving birth associated with one\npercent change in educational expenditure per person and per child are 0.25 percent and\n0.23 percent, respectively. Therefore, it may be inferred that those households with more\nexpenditure on private goods like education are less likely to give birth.\nIn examining the relationship between fertility and household consumption so far, we\nhave assumed that a household makes a decision the same way as an individual does.\nIf a household behaves collectively through a bargaining process among its members,\nthe specification for equivalence scale needs to be modified accordingly as suggested by\nBrowning et al. (2006). Therefore, it would be informative to investigate whether the\nframework of a unitary household is supported by the same data.\nIn understanding the relationship between household preference and fertility, the de-\nmand for private goods may be determined by household members with different prefer-\nence and bargaining power (Browning and Chiappori 1998). Specifically, the expenditure\non children's education may be determined by the husband and wife's collective decision.\nIt is a common conjecture that mothers tend to care more about children's education, or\nthat mothers at least have different preference from fathers. Therefore, we focus on in-\nvestigating the differences in preferences of husband and wife with regard to children's\neducation in the context of Indonesia. Using the first wave of the IFLS, the effect of the\nbargaining power on the educational share of expenditure is examined.\nOne measure of bargaining power suggested in the literature is nonlabor income\nconstructed by combining income from pension, scholarship, insurance claim, lottery or\ngift from family, friends and charity. One limitation is that the percentage of the house-\nholds with positive nonlabor income is relatively small (17% for husband's nonlabor in-\ncome, 22% for wife's at household level). Another measure indicating bargaining power\nis premarital assets (Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003; Park 2007). The IFLS has the infor-\nmation on premarital assets, but there is a substantial attrition (48%) due to the availability\nof premarital assets and the relevant price indices.\nIn addition, we consider the share of the current asset as a measure of bargaining\npower assuming that the individual shares of current assets are exogenously given. Three\nkinds of assets are used: farm business, non-farm business and house. Because the\nrecorded values of assets are not reliable, the relative ownership of an asset is taken as\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 645\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\na measure of bargaining power. That is, the sum of shares of ownership between husband\nand wife is set to be one. A husband's share of one asset, for example, farm business\nshould be interpreted to be valid among households with farm business since it is, in fact,\nthe interaction term between farm business owner dummy and the husband's share.\nAs discussed in the literature, we test for unitary versus collective household decision\nprocess by investigating whether the individual resources of husband and wife have the\nsame effect on educational expenditure. Also we examine whether husband's share of\nassets have any impact on the expenditure on education.19\nRegarding the dependent variable, there are two sources for educational expenditure\nin the IFLS. The first is the information on educational expenditure as a part of the house-\nhold consumption expenditure. The educational expenditure for a household includes the\nexpenditure on adults' education as well as children's education. The second is the ed-\nucational expenditure for a particular child. The IFLS has a special section on children\nunder age 14, which was conducted for two randomly chosen children per household.\nThe educational expenditure on a child was collected only for those attending school. We\nuse both pieces of information. First, the household educational expenditure per person\nis used as a measure of educational expenditure with the assumption that the expenditure\non adults' education is negligible. Second, the results using the expenditure on a school\nchild as a measure of educational expenditure in a sample of children are presented.\nThe results using the data at the household level are presented in Table 9. According to\ncolumn (1), households with non-farm business tend to spend less on education, whereas\nhouseholds with farm business or house do not exhibit any difference. Husband's share\nof three assets does not have any impact on educational spending. Households with larger\ntotal household expenditure per person tend to spend more on education. One percent\nincrease in per capita household expenditure is associated with 2.5 percent increase in\nshare of the expenditure on education. This magnitude is roughly consistent in column\n(2) and (3). In column (2) the husband's and wife's premarital assets have an impact on\neducational spending with different direction, but the result does not reject the hypothesis\nthat they have the same impacts at the conventional level of significance. Husband's\nand wife's nonlabor income does not show any effects significantly different from each\nother as in column (3). When the log of educational expenditure per person is used as a\ndependent variable in column (4) to (6), the results remain qualitatively the same.\n19 Under the null hypothesis that the resources of a husband and a wife have the same effects, the husband's\nshare should have no effect on educational expenditure.\n646 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nTable 9: Household bargaining and educational spending I\nDependent variable Share of educational log Educational expenditure\nexpenditure per person\npremarital asset(1\npremarital asset(2\nnonlabor income(3\np-value for:\nNotes: 1) White heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors are in parentheses.\n2) * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.\n3) The unit of observation is a household.\n4) All the explanatory variables denote the values in 1993.\n5) 179 households with more than one newborn child were dropped.\n6) Household characteristics and province dummies are included in all specifications.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 647\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\nThe results from the child level data are shown in Table 10. In column (1), households\nwith non-farm business tend to spend more on children's education in contrast to column\n(1) in Table 9. The difference is likely to be due to the selection of samples. Households\nwith other assets do not spend on education any differently. Husband's share of the three\nassets do not have any significant effects on children's educational spending. In column\n(2) the premarital assets of a husband and a wife do not have any significant impact on\neducation nor are their effects different from each other. Nonlabor income of a husband\nand a wife in column (3) is associated with a larger spending on education, but the result\ndoes not reject the hypothesis that their effects are of the same magnitude.\nOne limitation of the analysis is that the size of samples vary over the specifications\ndue to the availability of data. However, data at both household and child level produce\nresults in favor of a unitary household model. The results are consistent with Park (2007),\nwho did not find a clear evidence that a parental household bargaining plays an impor-\ntant role in the decision of expenditure on children's education using the third wave of\nIFLS.20 Therefore, the framework of a unitary household seems to be valid at least in\nunderstanding the relationship between fertility and household consumption.\nTable 10: Household bargaining and educational spending II\nDependent variable:\nlog Educational expenditure for a child\nNon-farm business husband's share 0.043 - -\n20 Park (2007) also found a consistent evidence in favor of a collective household model examining the children's\nnutritional status, and suggested that the decision process may differ depending on the type of decision.\n648 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\nTable 10: (Continued)\nDependent variable: log Educational expenditure\nfor a child\nlog Husband's premarital assets (1\nlog Wife's premarital assets (2\nlog Husband's nonlabor income (3\nlog Wife's nonlabor income (4\np-value for:\nNotes: 1) White heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors are in parentheses.\n2) * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.\n3) The correlation between children from the same household is allowed when the standard errors are\ncalculated.\n4) The unit of observation is a child.\n5) All the explanatory variables denote the values in 1993.\n6) 179 households with more than one newborn child were dropped.\n7) Household characteristics and province dummies are included in all specifications.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 649\nKim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?\n7. Conclusion\nThis paper describes the causal effect of fertility on household consumption in Indonesia\nat the end of a fertility transition in a unitary household framework. Using the nonpara-\nmetric propensity score matching method, it is found that a newly-born child leads to a\nreduction of consumption by 20 percent within four years, when consumption expendi-\nture per person is used as a measure of household consumption. This effect, however, is\nextremely sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale. Using the estimates of equivalence\nscale based on the assumption that food share inversely indicates the level of household\nwelfare, it is shown that the effect of a child on household consumption is still negative\nbut the magnitude is in the range from 20 to 65 percent of that obtained when per-capita\nconsumption is used as a measure of household consumption. Hence, the results suggest\nthat the analysis based on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the\neffect of fertility on poverty at least because the equivalence scale is not properly taken\nThe prevalence of poverty measure based on consumption per person is mainly due\nto its practical convenience and the strong assumptions required for alternative measures.\nOur analysis presents a reasonable and practical way of estimating the equivalence scale\nand applying it to the question on the relationship between fertility and poverty. The\nincreasing quality of survey data in recent years enables one to incorporate the equivalence\nscale in the poverty analysis in demographic research at least within a certain country.\nThe sensitivity of the effect of fertility on household consumption with respect to the\nequivalence scale generates two theoretical implications. First, it illustrates the impor-\ntance of separating public from private consumption. The expenditure on private goods\nsuch as children's education reflects the price of having a child. Second, our analysis pro-\nvides an empirical bridge between unitary and collective models of the household. The\nresults suggest that the expenditure share of private goods can be used to test for a collec-\ntive decision making process in a household. Although the data are limited, our finding\nis that the demand for children's education does not seem to be affected by the parental\nbargaining process.\nThere are a couple of directions suggested for future research. First, since the choice\nof welfare indicator may make a considerable difference in the estimation as Anand and\nHarris (1994) suggested, it is worthwhile to extend the analysis in the paper by using other\nmeasures of household welfare including income or body mass index. Secondly, because\npoverty is measured as an aggregate variable in a household in this study, it is not clear\nhow fertility is going to affect total household income. Therefore, estimating the effect of\nfertility on the elements of household income, such as the working hours or earnings per\nhour of household members in a structural model, will be a fruitful way of investigating\nthe causal relationship between fertility and household welfare.\n650 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26\n8.
