Divani, PhD\nBackground and Purpose--We developed a model to estimate the costs incurred by ineffective primary and secondary\nprevention in terms of excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a nationally representative sample of the US\npopulation.\nMethods--Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine the effect of inadequate risk factor control on the\nincidence of fatal stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) during a follow-up period of 13.43.6 years after adjusting for\ndifferences in age, gender, and ethnicity in a national cohort of 9252 adults who participated in the Second National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Mortality Follow-up Study. Inadequate risk factor modification\nwas defined by presence of either blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, serum cholesterol 200 mg/dL, or active cigarette\npercent and associated cost incurred (expressed as proportion of total 1-year cost incurred for CVD mortality in year\nResults--CVD mortality risk increased in a stepwise manner for persons with no previous MI or stroke and 2\ninadequately controlled risk factors (2); and previous history of MI and stroke and adequately controlled risk factors\n(2.6), 1 inadequately controlled risk factor (4.3), and 2 inadequately controlled risk factors (5.7). The PAR was\n14% (estimated cost incurred $13.2 billion) among persons with 2 inadequately controlled risk factors without\nprevious MI or stroke (estimated 17% of total US population). Among persons with previous MI or stroke, the PAR was\n7% (cost incurred $6.2 billion) and 8% (cost incurred $7.4 billion) for 1 inadequately controlled risk factor and 2\ninadequately controlled risk factors, respectively. An excess of cost of $13.6 billion was spent on 4% of the total\npopulation (persons with inadequate secondary prevention).\nConclusions--The model demonstrates the differential risk of mortality from inadequately controlled cardiovascular risk\nfactors in primary and secondary prevention settings. The large financial cost incurred by inadequate primary and\nsecondary prevention justifies intensive efforts directed toward detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors.\nKey Words: cigarette smoking  hypercholesterolemia  hypertension  mortality  primary prevention\n secondary prevention\nstroke in the year 2002.1 Improved control of modifiable risk\nfactors such as hypertension, cigarette smoking, and hyper-\nlipidemia remain an important component of any efforts to\nreduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).2\u00ad5 It is\nimperative to determine the financial burden of CVDs result-\ning from inadequate risk factor control in population subsets,\nso that cost-effective interventions can be developed for ideal\ntarget populations. We examined the financial burden of\ncardiovascular mortality incurred by inadequate control of\ncardiovascular risk factors in the setting of both primary and\nsecondary prevention in a representative sample of US\npopulation.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nWe used the data from the Second National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Follow-up Study and\ncohort data on a large nationally representative sample of the US\npopulation.\nNHANES II Baseline Evaluation: Assessment of\nCardiovascular Risk Factors Status\nThe baseline survey of NHANES II was conducted between 1976\nmonths to 74 years.6 Blood pressure measurements, physical exam-\ninations, health and dietary interviews, and serum cholesterol mea-\nsurements were performed as described previously.6\u00ad8 The diagnosis\nFrom the Zeenat Qureshi Stroke Research Center (A.I.Q., J.F.K., A.A.D.), Department of Neurology and Neurosciences, University of Medicine and\nDentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ; and the Department of Neurology (M.F.K.S.), Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.\nCorrespondence to Dr Adnan I.

This\ncriterion is based on threshold for defining hypertension in previous\nstudies.7 Uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia was defined on the\nbasis of serum cholesterol 200 mg/dL. The definition was chosen\nto represent value considered elevated by the Adult Treatment Panel\nIII guidelines.9 Current smoking status was determined based on\nself-report.\nNHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study: Incident\nCardiovascular Mortality\nMortality follow-up was conducted for the cohort of 9252 NHANES\nII participants who were aged 30 years or older at the time of\nenrollment through ascertainment of the vital status of each partici-\nrecorded in the National Death Index and the Social Security\nAdministration Death Master File 9. Underlying cause of death\naccording to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) code was recorded.\nEvents of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and MI were\ndetermined by death certificate diagnoses that included 1 or more of\nto 414 (for MI). Subarachnoid hemorrhage was not included because\nof the small number of events (n3) observed in NHANES II\nparticipants.\nCalculation of Relative Risk of Incident\nCardiovascular Mortality\nCox proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate the relative\nrisks (RR) and 95% CIs for all CVDs including stroke and MI in the\nfollowing 6 categories of persons according to adequacy of risk\nfactor control: (1) No inadequately controlled risk factors and no\nprevious history of stroke or MI (reference group); (2) 1 inadequately\ncontrolled risk factor and no previous history of stroke or MI; (3) 2\nor more inadequately controlled risk factors and no previous history\nof stroke or MI; (4) No inadequately controlled risk factors and a\nprevious history of stroke or MI; (5) 1 inadequately controlled risk\nfactor and a previous history of stroke or MI; and (6) 2 or more\ninadequately controlled risk factors and a previous history of stroke\nor MI. The analysis was adjusted for differences in age, gender, and\nethnicity.\nNational Health and Nutrition Survey 1999 to\n2000: Recent Evaluation of Prevalence of\nInadequately Controlled Risk Factors\nThe model for calculation of financial cost incurred with inade-\nquately controlled cardiovascular risk factors is dependent on the\nproportion of the population in each subset stratified by adequacy of\nrisk factor control. The baseline data for the NHANES II data were\nbeen modified based on the educational activities to develop and\nimplement guidelines for treatment of elevated cholesterol by the\nNational Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)10 and recent stud-\nies documenting the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in pa-\ntients with isolated systolic hypertension and hypertension among\ndiabetic patients.11 The most recent nationally representative sample\ntion of patients in strata based on previous history of MI or stroke\nand adequacy of risk factor control to estimate population attribut-\nable risk (PAR) as described below. Statistical analysis was carried\nout using WesVar (version 4.2; Westat). Variance estimation was\ncalculated using the delete 1 jackknife method. The calculated\nproportions of the population exposed to inadequate control of risk\nPopulation Attributable Risk\nTo estimate the impact of inadequately controlled risk factors on\nincident fatal CVD, we calculated the population-attributable risk\npercent.13 PAR expresses the proportion of disease (fatal CVD) in\nthe study population that is attributable to the exposure (inadequately\ncontrolled risk factors), and thus, could be eliminated if the exposure\nwas eliminated. The PAR percentage was calculated using the\nfollowing formula: where Pe represents the proportion of the\npopulation exposed to the risk factor (inadequate control of risk\nfactor):\nCost Incurred With Incident Cardiovascular\nThe financial burden of inadequate control of risk factors of\ncardiovascular mortality was estimated as the sum of cost incurred\nfor fatal strokes and fatal MIs during short-term hospitalization and\nloss of productivity due to premature death for 1 year. Estimated\nestimated using the formula for calculating inflation and is (P2/\nPrice Index-Urban (CPI-U),16 and P1 is the base value. The total\ndirect cost associated with fatal strokes and fatal MIs was estimated\nas the product of cost incurred per fatal stroke or MI and total\nnumber of fatal strokes or MIs that occurred in year 2001. The cost\nincurred due to loss of productivity for 1 year was calculated by\ndividing the estimated cost due to loss of productivity attribute to all\ncardiovascular deaths as provided by the American Heart Associa-\ntion.1 The cost incurred for each risk category was the proportion of\ncardiovascular mortality that would be reduced if that risk category\nwere eliminated (calculated as PAR). We performed sensitivity\nanalyses by calculating the cost for the upper and lower limit (based\non 95% CIs) of both the RR of fatal cardiovascular events and\nprevalence of inadequate risk factor control, and report the range of\nresults in each of the 6 categories of persons according to adequacy\nof risk factor control. For example, the lowest possible estimate for\ncost incurred in any category is based on PAR% derived from lower\nvalues of 95% CI of the RR and Pe. These analyses were performed\nto analyze the impact of relevant assumptions and statistical varia-\ntions on cost estimates.\nEffect of Inadequately Controlled Risk Factors on\nYears of Life Lost\nWe performed Cox proportional hazards analyses to estimate the RR\nand 95% CI for all cause mortality in 6 categories of persons\naccording to adequacy of risk factor control. We used the coeffi-\ncients from the regression model and US life tables for 2001\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_14.pdf) to esti-\nmate the years of life lost as described previously.17 The number of\nDemonstration of data sources used for construction of the\nmodel.\nQureshi et al Inadequate Prevention on Cardiovascular Mortality 2347\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nyears lost was the difference in expected ages between the 5\ncategories of persons with various risk factor control status and\nexpected age of the person without a previous history of MI or stroke\nand adequately controlled risk factors.\nResults\nTable 1 demonstrates the baseline characteristics of 9252\nparticipants enrolled in the NHANES II Mortality Follow-up\nStudy according to previous history of MI or stroke. A total\nMI and 126 were stroke during a mean follow-up period of\nThe results of the analysis are shown in Table 2. Compared\nwith persons without a previous history of MI or stroke and\nadequate risk factor control, the risk of incident cardiovascu-\nlar mortality increased in a stepwise manner for persons with\na previous history of MI and stroke and (1) adequately\ncontrolled risk factors (2.6), (2) 1 inadequately controlled\nrisk factor (4.3), and (3) 2 inadequately controlled risk\nfactors (5.7). The RR for all-cause mortality is presented in\nTable 2. The years of life lost ranged from 1.9 years for\npersons with no previous MI or stroke and 1 inadequately\ncontrolled risk factor to 8.9 years for persons with a previous\nhistory of MI and stroke and 2 inadequately controlled risk\nfactors.\nThe PAR was 14% for persons with 2 or more inadequately\ncontrolled risk factors in the absence of previous MI or stroke\n(17% of the US population; Table 3). Among persons with\nprevious MI or stroke, the PAR was 4% in the absence of any\ninadequately controlled risk factor and increased to 7% and\n8% in the presence of 1 and 2 risk factors, respectively.\nAnother way to interpret the results is that 14% of the incident\ncardiovascular mortality in the population is related to inad-\nequate control of multiple risk factors in persons without\nprevious MI or stroke. The estimated annual cost incurred, or\nthat which could be saved in this category because of\ncardiovascular mortality, is estimated to be $13.2 billion.\nAmong persons with previous MI or stroke (2% of the US\npopulation), 2 inadequately controlled risk factors ac-\ncounted for 8% of the incident cardiovascular mortality (total\ncost incurred is $7.4 billion; Table 3). An estimated 7% of\nincident cardiovascular mortality is related to 1 inadequately\ncontrolled risk factor among persons with previous MI or\nstroke (2% of the US population) leading to a total incurrent\nSensitivity analyses estimated the cost incurred ranging\ninadequately controlled risk factors in the absence of previous\nMI or stroke. The estimated cost incurred ranges between\nTABLE 1.

Among persons with previous MI or\nstroke, 2 inadequately controlled risk factors accounted for\nincurred cost ranging between $4.1 to 12.2 billion.\nDiscussion\nSalient Findings of the Study\nWe have developed a model that defines the population\nattributable mortality risk associated with failure to control\nmodifiable risk factors. When the excess risk and cost\nincurred is computed, persons with inadequate secondary\nprevention efforts incur a cost of cardiovascular mortality\npersons with 1 and 2 or more inadequately controlled risk\nfactors, respectively). This is almost the same as the cost\nincurred by inadequate primary prevention efforts estimated\nto $54.4) billion incurred by inadequate primary and second-\nary prevention of CVDs represents 3% of the $1.3 trillion\nspent on health care in the United States in 2001 (http://\nwww.cms.hhs.gov/). Our results call for major efforts di-\nrected toward primary and secondary prevention in subsets of\nthe population at highest risk for cardiovascular events.\nRelative Impact of Primary and Secondary\nPrevention on Survival\nThe years of life lost ranged from 1.9 years to 8.9 years for\npersons in various categories of inadequately controlled risk\nfactors. Two prospective studies18 evaluated the long-term\nmortality for persons with low risk defined as serum choles-\nand no current cigarette smoking. Estimated greater life\nexpectancy for low-risk groups ranged from 5.8 years to 9.5\nyears compared with those who had elevated cholesterol\nlevel, or blood pressure, or smoked. Grover et al19 compared\nthe potential years of life saved between high-risk patients\n(presence of hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and hyper-\ntension) and low-risk patients (presence of hypertension or\nhyperlipidemia). The forecasted benefits of lipid-lowering\ntherapy were substantially greater among high-risk groups\nversus low-risk groups in primary prevention (4.7 years\nversus 2.5 years, respectively) but similar in secondary\nprevention group, (4.6 years versus 3.8 years, respectively).\nThe results for hypertension therapy also demonstrated\ngreater benefits for high-risk versus low-risk patients under-\ngoing primary prevention therapy (1.3 years versus 0.9 years,\nrespectively), and the forecasted benefits in secondary pre-\nvention were similar (1.3 years versus 1.0 year, respectively).\nThe investigators concluded that the expected benefits of\ntherapy among patients without cerebrovascular diseases are\ngreatest in the presence of other risk factors.\nIssue related to Data Interpretation\nThe definitions of MI and stroke used to identify participants\nwith previous CVDs were based on self-reported physician\ndiagnoses. Bergmann et al20 compared interview reports with\nhospitalization records in 10 523 participants from the\nNHANES I. A true positive rate of 83% was observed for the\n294 self-reported MIs. O'Mahony et al21 validated the accu-\nracy of assessing lifetime history of stroke in a random\ntionnaire. Participants were asked whether they ever had a\nstroke. Response accuracy was confirmed by medical records\nreview. The question had a sensitivity and specificity of 95%\nand 96%, respectively.\nWe did not include diabetes mellitus as a modifiable\ncardiovascular risk factor in the analysis. Whether aggressive\nglucose control independently reduces the risk of cardiovas-\ncular events is debated.22 Certain other limitations of obser-\nvational studies including selection bias, missing data, mea-\nsurement errors, and lack of independent ascertainment of\nevents need to be considered in the interpretation of data. We\ncannot rule out the possibility that mortality with CVDs\nestimated from NHANES II may be lower in 2001 because of\nimprovement in treatment strategies independent of risk\nfactor control and, therefore, the cost incurred may be lower\nthan the estimated cost. We have provided the lowest and\nhighest estimation of the cost incurred as mentioned above.\nPAR is calculated from estimates of the relative risk and\nthe prevalence of the risk factor.13,23 However, if the risk\nfactors are clustered within individuals, PAR is an overesti-\nmate of the effect of a risk factor. Because cardiovascular risk\nfactors do cluster within individuals, PAR may overestimate\nthe effect of a single risk factor. In addition, adequate\ntreatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may not\nreduce the risk of CVDs to that observed in nonhypertensive\nTABLE 3.

Therefore, the actual cost\nbenefit may be lower than the estimated value.\nConclusion\nThe model demonstrates that the cost benefits with interven-\ntions to treat hyperlipidemia or hypertension or reduce\ncigarette smoking may be substantial, particularly when the\ncombined benefits on fatal cerebrovascular and coronary\nevents are considered together.\nReferences\n1.
