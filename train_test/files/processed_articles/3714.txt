Specifically, this article aims to highlight the significance of\nsiblings for children moving from homes to foster homes and back to their original homes again. Most children participating\nin this study emphasized the continuity of biological relations with their siblings as important for their identity and sense of\nbelonging. At the same time, social ties to both siblings and foster siblings had significance for their perception of themselves.\nA sense of belonging and identity are, thus, shown to develop in relation to both biological siblings and foster siblings.\n",

Although kinship place-\nments have become more common in recent years, most of\nthese children live in non-family foster care for a long time:\nIt is estimated that approximately 40% of children in foster\ncare live in foster homes for 4 years or more (Clausen &\nKristofersen, 2008). While there are no reliable statistics\nshowing how many foster children are returned to their par-\nents annually, children who remain in long-term foster care\nare seldom returned to their parents.\nFoster care systems and procedures pay little attention to\nchildren's perceptions of the mutual significance of biologi-\ncal and foster siblings (Backe-Hansen, Egelund, & Havik,\nFor children living with their parents and siblings, there is a\nmerging between biological and social relations, which gives\nreason to presume that biological ties give a sense of belong-\ning and identity (Midjo, 1998). In cases in which there is no\nsuch merging, the process of acquiring this sense of belong-\ning and identity is less obvious. Studies based on children's\nown views about sibling contact and how it affects them are\nscarce, despite their obvious value (Herrick & Piccus, 2005).\nBased on Norwegian social policy, this article discusses dif-\nferent relations between siblings and elaborates on the sig-\nnificance of biological and social ties to siblings for foster\nchildren's sense of belonging.\nUp until the 1980s, studies of relations between siblings\nwere uncommon, and sibling relationships were considered\nrelatively unimportant from a developmental perspective\n(Boer & Dunn, 1992). Family relationships were considered\ncollectively, as a unit: The family was seen to exert a homo-\ngeneous influence on all its members. During the last decade,\nthis traditional view has been challenged (Edwards, Hadfield,\nrelations among siblings for developing identity and inner\nlife has been considerably emphasized (Lucey, Mauthner,\nThere is now research on how sibling relationships\ndevelop throughout life; for example, Victor G. Cicirelli\npresents the first comprehensive resource on examining the\ncourse of a sibling relationship, from its beginnings in child-\nhood to the end of life, and the factors that influence it. This\nwork includes a hermeneutic study of the relationships of a\nsingle large family of adult siblings that provides new under-\nstandings of how adult sibling relationships are maintained\n(Cicirelli, 1995). However, we have Rebecca Hagars's\nreviews of 17 studies from across several countries, address-\ning definitions and descriptions of sibling groups in care,\ncharacteristics of children placed together or separately, and\noutcomes of sibling placements. Most studies examining\noutcomes suggest that joint sibling placements are more sta-\nble than placements of single children or separated siblings,\n1University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nBj\u00f8rn \u00d8ystein Angel, University of Agder, Post boks 422, Kristiansand,\nEmail: bjorn.o.angel@uia.no\nFoster Children's Sense of Sibling\nBelonging: The Significance of Biological\nand Social Ties\nBj\u00f8rn \u00d8ystein Angel1\n Keywords\nfoster care, siblings, identity, child development, sense of belonging\n2 SAGE Open\nand that children do well or better when placed with siblings\n(Hegar, 2005a). Cicirelli's and Hagars's studies emphasize\nthe developmental importance siblings have for each other.\nA Scottish study explores the ways in which children\nunderstand sibling relationships and how the negotiation of\nsibling roles varies according to birth order, age, and gender\n(Punch, 2005). This piece of research considers the extent to\nwhich children draw on siblings as a source of support--both\ninside and outside the family. The author has since gone on\nto investigate the ways in which children consider siblings to\nbe a source of problems (in the forms of rivalry and conflict)\nand how they negotiate outcomes to such tensions (McIntosh\nThe experience of new family arrangements is not exclu-\nsive to children in foster homes. Children in stepfamilies also\nhave to deal with new carers' children in some cases. The\nexisting research on stepfamilies documents a wide range of\nchildren's experiences in adjusting to the presence of steps-\niblings and full brothers and sisters. Many studies have found\nthat stepchildren can define their family very differently than\ndo non-stepchildren, as they incorporate new and old rela-\ntionships into their new family concept (Berge Fj\u00f8sne, 2007;\nresearch concerning foster care, there has been little focus on\nexisting sibling relationships, despite the fact that the\nMinistry of Children, Equality, and Social Inclusion intro-\nduced the idea that biological siblings should be placed\ntogether in foster homes as a main principle (The Ministry of\nChildren, Equality and Social Inclusion [BFD], 1997). This\ndecision was motivated by the understanding that it would be\nin the best interest of the children. Anfinnsen (1998) and\nGjerdevik (2005) examine foster children's understanding of\nfamily, but their discussion of siblings' mutual significance\nfor one another is very limited. Bunkholdt (2004) discusses\ndifferent challenges and dilemmas concerning placing sib-\nlings together. Egelund and Hestb\u00e6k's (2003) research sur-\nvey about the placement of children outside of their homes\npoints out, among other things, the need for knowledge of\nsiblings' significance to be reflected in the foster care proce-\ndures themselves.\nBritish research is relatively in agreement that it is best to\nplace siblings together (Berridge & Cleaver, 1987; Thoburn,\n1988). However, doing so incurs certain costs and risks\neffectively sums up newer British research by saying that\nsibling relationships are of great importance for both better\nand worse. Similarly, Gillian Schofield writes extensively\nabout the lived experience of children in foster care and their\nsense of identity and belonging (Schofield, 2003). Sibling\nrelations can be harmonious and a source of safety and com-\nfort, but they can also be destructive. There is a chronologi-\ncal component to this matter as well. At one point, relations\nbetween siblings can foster a sense of belonging and continu-\nity, while at a later point, they may also prove obstacles for\ndevelopment. Siblings may hold onto old loyalties and\ndefinitions, which, in turn, may bar them from embracing\nnew possibilities for development afforded by the foster\nhome environment.\nThis article's empirical starting point is the interview\nmaterial that forms the basis of the research project: Moving\nHome After Having Lived in Foster Homes--An Analysis of\nChildren's Self-Perception and Life Stories (Angel, 2009).\nThe aim of this article is to explore children's sense of\nbelonging to siblings and to discuss the significance of bio-\nlogical and social ties among reunited foster children in the\nNorwegian family services model. Whom do the children\nperceive to be siblings, and what does this mean for their\nidentity and sense of belonging? Answers to these questions\nwill be illuminated by discussing three dimensions of sibling\nrelations: (a) a mutual sense of belonging and care, (b) an\nambiguous sense of mutuality and care, or (c) no sense of\nmutuality and care.\nTheory\nIn this article, the concepts \"identity,\" \"social ties,\" and \"bio-\nlogical ties\" are central. Identity is, in this article, based on\nreflexive interpretation of his or her life story is important.\nIdentity is socially constructed, and people can reflect on the\nsocial world and their position therein (Jenkins, 2008), simi-\nlar to the notion of \"the social self\" (Mead, 1934), which\nasserts that the self is inseparably attached to society.\nAccording to Mead, the self is constructed by two parts: I\nand Me. Me can be called the Self's social role or expectation,\nwhile I is the spontaneous, creative and acting component.\nThe tension between Me and I leads people to consciously\nanalyze themselves. Me is social and represents knowledge\nof others' behavioral expectations. In essence, per this view,\nthe self is socially constructed, as it is influenced and devel-\noped through interaction with other people (Charon & Cahill,\ntained. To have a sense of who we are, we must have a notion\nof where we come from and how we have become what we\nling connections are extremely important to children in out-\nof-home care; children need to know their identity and\nbelonging.\nBiological ties are more desirable than social ties. Social\nties are acquired through interaction with other people.\nBiological ties are given social and cultural content, though\nbiological ties are seen as fixed as they are ascribed at birth\nto children (Schneider, 1984). The various types of families\ncan make it necessary to redefine the sense of family belong-\ning to include family ties acquired and based on social ties,\nindependent of biological origin (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim,\nhave become more important than ties of kinship and law as\nfoundations for a sense of belonging. Every member of the\nfamily can have his or her own perception of who belongs to\nthe family. Familial belonging is no longer limited in the\nways it once was. Identity and sense of belonging are contex-\ntual and relational entities (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002).\nChildren in foster homes can establish their identity and\nsense of belonging both in relation to their biological and\nfoster families, together with biological and social ties\n\"Belonging\" describes a sense of \"belonging to\" or\n\"belonging with\" someone. \"A sense of belonging\" can be\nunderstood as an experience of equality and intimacy, and\nthus, it is closely linked to \"social identity.\" The concept is\noften used to indicate belonging to place(s) (e.g., home/fos-\nter home), nationality, or culture (Giuliani, 2003). Individuals\ncan, to a certain extent, choose to whom or what they may\nwant to belong. The different relationships people enter can\nlikewise be significant to their sense of belonging (Midjo,\n1997). Sense of belonging is developed in different contexts.\nThis situational sense of belonging gives the individual\nopportunity to enter changing phases of belonging and asso-\nciated processes. Different forms of belonging may include\nboth biological and social ties. Foster children who have\nmoved homes, for example, may have a sense of belonging\nto their biological siblings, to their foster siblings, and to\nother children.\n\"Sense of belonging\" refers to the experience of commu-\nnity and social integration, while \"identity\" emphasizes indi-\nviduality (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Both concepts\nthematize how people find a place in society (Jenkins, 2008).\nIdentity consists of both expressing what is unique for the\nindividual and, at the same time, showing a sense of belong-\nrefers to how we understand and present ourselves and to\nhow we understand and pass on a sense of belonging. In the\nsame way, foster children's sense of belonging to siblings is\npart of the foundation of their identity.\nMethod\nParticipants and Data Collection\nThe children participating in this study each experienced the\nintervention of child welfare services, placement in a foster\nhome, and a subsequent return to their original home at a\nlater date. The sample comprises 10 children, 3 boys and 7\ngirls, who were taken into custody when they were between\nthe ages of 4 and 12 years old. The children lived outside\ntheir homes for periods ranging from 2\u00bd to 12 years. On\naverage, the children lived more than 5 years in the foster\nhome. At the time of the interview, the youngest had just\nturned 11, while the oldest was 17.All the children lived with\nfoster siblings: 8 children had biological siblings placed in\nfoster care, 5 children had biological siblings remaining with\nthe birth family, and 3 children had biological siblings born\ninto their birth family after entering care. There were 3 sib-\nling groups in the sample. In total, these 10 children had 34\nfull and half brothers and sisters. During the children's time\nin foster homes, they established contact with a total of 28\nfoster siblings.\nThe chief reasons for the children's placement in foster\nhomes related to their parents' inability to care for them\n(owing primarily to addictions and mental health problems).\nThe county social welfare boards decided that each of the\nchildren should be taken into care and placed in a foster\nhome. Subsequently, these boards prescribed the return of\nthese children to their parents. The children had been moved\nfrom their homes against their wishes and those of their par-\nents, and they had moved back home again according to their\nown and their parents' wishes.\nA half-structured interview guide was used to investigate\nthe research question: What is the significance of social and\nbiological ties to foster children's sense of belonging and\nidentity? The guide contained topics I wished to illuminate,\nformulated as descriptive questions. The interviews were\ncarried out in the children's homes with one exception,\nwhich was conducted in the corner of a caf\u00e9 according to the\nchild's wishes. All the interviews were recorded and then\ntranscribed.\nA study requires the free and informed consent of its\ninformants (Hill, 2005; National Committee for Research\nEthics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities [NESH],\n2006). Ethical matters were considered in the recruitment of\nand Punch (2002), particularly concerning children's free-\ndom to consent and confidentiality. The project was approved\nby the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD;\n2000). I contacted the children through the Department of\nChildren, Youth, and Family Affairs' foster home services in\nsix counties (108 municipalities total), in addition to directly\ncontacting the child protection services in 14 of these munic-\nipalities. These services sent out the invitation, which also\ndescribed the nature of the project, to parents whose children\nhad been returned to them from foster care. My address and\nphone number were included, in addition to a consent form\nwith a stamped return envelope, which parents and children\ncould send me if they wanted to participate in the study. The\nchildren expressed interest at the letter stage in participating.\nAt our first meeting, I offered the children further opportuni-\nties for information exchange and gained their signed con-\nsent to participate. Fluid consent (the freedom to withdraw\nfrom the study at any time) was assured during the interview.\nTo protect the anonymity of participants throughout the text,\nI have excluded the children's names or other identifiable\ncharacteristics.\nData Analysis\nThe interviews, which are analyzed as life stories (Hatch &\nWisniewski, 1995), thus have a hermeneutic interpretive char-\nrized, so that the meaning of the text is concentrated, and the\n4 SAGE Open\noriginal text is shortened (Silverman, 2011). The children's\nlife stories are analyzed to reveal their most important themes.\nThe analysis of qualitative data involves posing questions to\nthe material, as well as organizing the answers in a systematic\nand relevant way (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994). The analysis has\nfour developmental stages: (a) forming a general impression,\n(b) identifying the significant units, (c) abstracting the con-\ntents of the different significant units, and (d) extracting the\nmost important elements (Miles & Huberman, 1994).\nThis is a grounded theory approach analyzing informants'\nstories and perspectives. The transcribed material is divided\ninto categories that made sense when they were taken out of\ncontext, and which emerged inductively during analysis. The\nchildren each describe their life stories in relation to their\nsiblings and foster siblings with different distance, symme-\ntry, and depth. In the material, we can see two different\ndimensions. One dimension, called mutuality, includes striv-\ning for balance. This dimension may include mutuality in\nemotions, such as liking or not liking one another; in influ-\nence, which is decided upon by both sides; and in content,\nthat is, having the same interests, which concerns what James\n(1993) calls \"to be friends with.\" The other dimension can be\ncalled care. This dimension ranges from giving to receiving\ncare. Here, one party in the relationship is dependent on the\nother. In such relational patterns, what one does together\nwith others is important to create a background of common\nexperience. Based on mutuality and care, the analysis will\nthus concentrate on isolating three dimensions: a mutual\nsense of belonging and care, an ambiguous sense of mutual-\nity and care, or no sense of mutuality and care. We find chil-\ndren who clearly and distinctly fit into the above-identified\ncategories, while there are others who are less easily classi-\nfied, but who still fit a category type.\nThree Dimensions of Mutuality and Care\nIn a family with more than one child, there are usually three\nsets of relations: the relationship between the spouses, the\nrelationships between parents and children, and the relation-\nships among the siblings (Jensen, Moen, & Clausen, 1991).\nSibling relationships are different from the other types in that\nthey generally last the longest; we often have siblings our\nwhole lives. This is not necessarily true in the case of foster\nsiblings. Who foster children consider to be their siblings\ndepends on various circumstances, such as social ties, living\nin the same home, intimacy, and meeting regularly. To under-\nstand a child's relationship with brothers and sisters, it is\ntherefore necessary to think beyond biology and include the\nchild's experiences (Rushton et al., 2001).\nDuring the time the study participants spent at their origi-\nnal homes, during their time in foster care, and again during\nthe time after their return home, all were involved in different\nsocial and communicative processes that contributed to the\ndevelopment of their respective siblings-orientation. When a\nchild is placed in a foster home, it is generally foster family\nmembers who become that child's daily interaction partners,\nwhile interactions with biological parents and siblings in that\nhome environment become more (or entirely) limited.\nIn my conversations with study participants, I asked with\nwhom they lived and asked them to tell me about themselves\nwithout defining what was implied. As the children's views\non and evaluations of biological siblings and foster siblings\nare complex, it is not possible to evaluate too precisely\nwhether or not they \"liked\" their siblings, or whether or not\ntheir siblings \"meant something\" to them. To categorize on a\nsympathy\u00adantipathy scale would be to use a \"still photo\" as\na starting point, which would give a distorted view of ever-\nchanging relations. For example, one of the children\nexplained that she wanted to move into her first foster home\nbecause the foster parents' own daughter was at her same\nage. They played well together when she stayed only at\nweekends and before she moved in \"for real.\" As time went\nby, this child's perception of her relationship with her foster\nsister changed and became more ambivalent.\nNormally, children who are born to the same parents and\nlive together do not problematize whether they are siblings\nor not. Such a relationship is normally taken for granted and\nwoven into our imagined worlds (Smart & Silva, 1999).\nWhat has significance for whether social relations become\nuseful social resources for children has more to do with\nmutual obligations, expectations, and credibility. Children\ncan do things for other children, whereby trust relations are\nformed that, in turn, generate expectations and obligations.\nThis type of belonging depends on two factors: On the one\nhand, credibility to the social surroundings, which means\nthat one keeps one's promises; and on the other hand, the\nactual scale of the obligations one has.\nA Mutual Sense of Belonging and Care\nThis subgroup includes children who identify with and count\nas brothers and sisters: (a) their biological siblings who lived\nat home when they were in foster homes themselves, and/or\n(b) their foster siblings. One of the children said this about\nher biological siblings:\nMy older sister lived with mummy all the time, and then mummy\nhad my younger sister. It was strange that they lived at home\nwhile Gro and I lived in a foster home. When we were at home\nwith mummy, we did a lot of girl stuff . . . We have always\nbeen a family. It is here I belong.\nInterviewer: What do you think about your older and your\nyounger sister?\nChild: I love them, and they love me. I know that.\nAnother child said this about his foster sister:\nThe [the foster parents'] daughter and I had a really good\nrelationship, and she lives in X-city and I really like to visit her.\nI meet her now and then, send mail and call, and . . . She is 6\nyears older than me . . . She is that kind of a sister to me, and\nshe has a boy and a girl that I am kind of an uncle to. I notice that\nthey like me, and I like them, too. We belong to each other.\nIn his story about himself and his foster siblings, this par-\nticipant conceives of himself as an acting, experiencing, and\nanalyzing subject. His analyses are complex, as he takes into\naccount others' perspectives, while analyzing his own con-\nsiderations of himself. He reflects critically over his own\nway of being, and he has clear perceptions of the social con-\nsequences of what he said and did during the time he lived in\nthe foster home. Mead's identity theory (1934) includes a\nhigh degree of choice, as identity is based on one's reflexive\ninterpretations with one's biography as a starting point. In\nthis same vein, this boy now calls his foster siblings \"his\"\nsiblings. They have influenced his identity and his under-\nstanding and experience of belonging.\nIn the following, first, a biological older sister speaks\nabout her biological younger sister, and then this younger\nsister tells us about her relationship with her older sister:\nAnd I have promised to come and tell it to her class, as she\nthinks it is so embarrassing talking about it (that she has lived in\na foster home). She says it is embarrassing, but I think she is\nscared of telling, that it is a bit scary . . . she says that it is\nembarrassing . . . I care for her, and we are connected to each\nother.\nThe younger sister talks of telling others how it was for\nher older sister to be in the foster home.\nAnd then she asked almost every day if I wanted to join her and\nplay with dolls, for she was so alone. She loves me.\nThese biological sisters, who are only about a year apart\nin age, had always been together, and they talked about\nmutual care for each other from early on. The quotes also\npoint out the mutuality the sisters felt. When they talked\nabout important events in the interviews, they used the \"we\"-\nform: \"we endured\" and \"we managed\" and \"we stuck\ntogether.\" Both girls talked about each other with joy--\nsimultaneously as they expressed joy and respect for an older\nbiological sister who had lived at home all the time. This\nrelationship between these sisters was confirmed and\nstrengthened by the time they had together, and their com-\nmon history and biography strengthened their identity. Their\nrelations evidence balance or mutuality, according to the lan-\nguage adopted in this study. This may include the idea that\ncare is shown mutually, and balance is created through both\nparties presenting themselves as intentional, as shown in the\nexcerpts.\nIn the transcribed interviews, there are also examples of\nthe other dimension, care. The children both looked after and\ncared for each other in different ways. We saw one variant of\nthis in the example above, a testimony to the girls' mutual\nrelationship. The care between them was characterized by a\ndeep, symmetrical intimacy. They alternated between giving\nand receiving care, depending on who needed it. They were\nthere for each other freely without letting it put limitations on\ntheir lives.\nThe children who participated in interviews in this study\ncan be said to have known a \"risk situation,\" as children who\nenter into custody in our society often show signs of diffi-\nculty. In many risk situations, feeling useful, taking responsi-\nbility, and experiencing control can be factors that contribute\nto increased competence and the formation of a positive\nidentity (Gr\u00f8holt, Sommerschild, & Gj\u00e6rum, 1998). In this\nlight, the children's experience of caring may strengthen the\nrelations and sense of belonging among them.\nThere are also examples in the transcripts of how care\ntook the form of one of the siblings distinctly going in and\ntaking responsibility for the other without it being clear that\nthe other should give anything in return (as we saw in the\nprevious excerpt). Another informant provided an example\nof how such a relationship can turn out:\nI came to the other family [her second foster home] before him.\nI said that I wanted my brother up there, rather than having him\nstay with them [the old foster home]. Then he also moved.\nThis excerpt says much about caring for a younger bio-\nlogical brother and taking responsibility. This subject took\nresponsibility in their changing situations--in her first foster\nhome and in transitioning to a new foster home--by ensuring\nthat her brother stayed with her. In the conversations with her\nbrother, when we touched upon the issue of moving, he said,\n\"She is the one who fixes things.\" The texts contain a num-\nber of themes mentioned by both subjects: visiting with one\nanother when apart, taking responsibility, adjusting, and\ntrusting one another.Another informant, who is also included\nin this dimension, expresses these notions explicitly when\nshe talks about her biological sister:\nShe looks up to me so much, only talks about me, like all the\ntime. I know that if I had died, she would never have made it . . .\nShe is so attached to me.\nThe sister responds,\n. . . when she sees that I need something, she helps me. She cares\nfor me.\nHence, this second pattern can be described as asymmetric,\nin which one of the sisters does tasks that are usually associ-\nated with parenthood in our culture. If the act of taking care of\nanother disturbs one's own functioning, this could be a form of\nthe practice that specialists of different disciplines and with\ndifferenttheoreticalstandingscall\"parentification\"(Haugland,\n2006). Normally, the term parentification is used in situations\nwhen children enter adult roles in relation to their own parents,\nbut it could also include situations when children fulfill clear\n6 SAGE Open\nadult roles in relation to other family members. In my mate-\nrial, it is children who perform actions or \"practices\" in which\none occupies a care-receiving position and the other a respon-\nsible care-giving position in continual care relations. In the\ntype just discussed, there is dominance in the relationship, and\none has influence on the other; simultaneously, there can be\nmutuality in interest. Parentification can be incompatible with\nthe establishment of a healthy feeling of intrinsic value and\nmay prevent positive self-development (Haugland, 2006).\nAmbiguous Mutuality and Care\nThese children were uncertain whether to name their foster\nsiblings among their \"siblings.\" Here, we also find children\nwho are uncertain of whether their biological siblings--who\nwere born while they lived in foster homes themselves--\nwere their real siblings. An informant told me about his bio-\nlogical sister who was born while he lived in a foster home:\nShe [the subject's younger sister] said that it was strange that I\ncame there [home]. It was Me and Me. I was a bit difficult during\nthat period when I came home. I think that I kind of have not got\nso much attention from my mother, as I have been away so much.\nAnd when she [the sister] also demanded attention, I wasn't very\nhappy with that . . . don't really know if she really is my sister.\nThe sense of belonging within a group of children that\nfosters intimacy depends on both the physical presence of the\nchildren and the amount of attention they give each other.\nEven though children may be physically there for each other,\nthere is a shortage of intimacy between the children if no\nstrong bond exists between them. One of the children\nexpressed her feelings for her sister as follows:\nIn a way we do not fit together. But at the same time, we belong\ntogether. I don't know what to say.\nKinship ties are no longer necessarily biological. As these\nties are no longer taken for granted, they undergo negotiation;\nby contrast, in previous times, basic trust was taken for granted\nin family relations. The relation builds on what the partners\nobtain in their relationship with each other, more than building\non forced commitment. Here, it is mutuality and intimacy that\ncount--both of which are missing in the excerpt above.\nNo Mutuality and Care\nThe third subgroup embraces two subcategories. The first\nsubcategory is made up of respondents who do not consider\ntheir foster siblings as siblings. One of the children in my\nstudy expressed it like this:\nTheir kids, they got a key when they were going home after\nschool, but I waited a couple of hours now and then, to get home\nand such. That really sucked. We did not care for each other . . . .\nNote the child called his foster siblings \"their kids.\" He\nalso used the term the other non-foster-children. This was his\ndescription of his foster siblings from his first foster home.\nConcerning the foster siblings in his other foster home, he\nbarely mentioned that the foster parents had some grown-up\nchildren. He related to me,\nI have never been . . . familiar with them [the foster siblings],\nthey . . . kept . . . to themselves. I can't say that they are my\nsiblings. Not what I put into it.\nInterviewer: When are people siblings of each other then?\nThe child: It is when you have the same parents and have grown\nup together, and we care about each other.\nIn sum, this participant does not consider his foster fami-\nly's children as his siblings with significance for his sense of\nbelonging and identity. Another child in my study said,\nI felt that the foster parents' children looked down on me. I\ndidn't like them either.\nWhen one of the children recounted her life story, she\nmentioned that her foster parents had a daughter after she\nhad been there for 4 years, and then a son 3 years later. In\nconversation, we touched upon the contact she had with her\nprevious foster home:\nInterviewer: Do you have any contact with your previous\nfoster home today?\nChild: Yes.\nInterviewer: Tell me a little bit about this contact.\nChild: It is like going to people you know from before.\nBut it gets weirder when you go there, and then the\nlittle kids are there.\nInterviewer: What do you think about the little kids over\nthere, then?\nChild: They are much nicer now; they are not so annoying\nany more. They do not cling onto you all the time. My\nprevious foster parents tell me that they talk about me,\nlike, all the time.\nInterviewer: I can imagine that. Do you think they see you\nas their sibling?\nChild: I don't know.\nInterviewer: Do you think of them as your siblings?\nChild: No, not at all. We do not have the same parents and\nwe have not grown up together. There is nothing that\nties us together.\nThus, in her reflections on her foster home, she did not\nconsider herself as sister to these children because she was\nnot related to them. Nonetheless, she did not reject the pos-\nsibility that her previous foster siblings might view her as\ntheir older sister.\nThe other subcategory covers those who do not consider\ntheir biological siblings as siblings. One informant describes\nand analyzes her relationship with her biological brother as if\nthere is distance between them:\nAnd then he decided to become a Christian once. And now he\ngoes around and testifies, and that is okay. We never figured it\nout with each other, we are so different. In fact, I do not think of\nhim as my brother, just that we are so different.\nIn her elaboration, she said that there had always been a\ncertain distance between her and her biological brother.\nWhen she lived in the foster home, they lived there together,\nbut they never had a very close relationship with each other.\nTo a query about understanding her relationship with her\nbrother, she says in response that she has never thought much\nabout him, even when young. He found his place in the foster\nhome, while she longed to get back home to her mother.\nAccording to the informant, the foster home favored her\nbrother. She thinks that the difference in treatment that took\nplace in the foster home contributed to maintaining the dis-\ntance or at least prevented them from becoming closer to\neach other. After she moved back home, things did not\nimprove; rather the opposite occurred. She presumed that\nthere was a sense of mutuality in how her biological brother\nwould describe the relationship between them.\nThis section has shown three dimensions of mutuality and\ncare as reflected in the informants' life stories. In the next\nsection, I summarize and conclude the article's key points.\nDiscussion and Summary\nThe starting point of this study is children's understandings\nof their own situation, as well as the significance of social\nand biological ties to the development of a sense of belong-\ning and identity. Responding to calls from scholars such as\nHerrick and Piccus (2005), among others, this study attempts\nto address the lack of research examining children's under-\nstanding of themselves--in this case, specifically regarding\nsibling relations and their significance to children.\nThis article has focused on a particular aspect of sibling\nrelations: an exploration of the significance of biological and\nsocial ties among reunited foster children and what can be\ndescribed as the creation of sibling relationships. All children\nneed a sense of belonging and identity, a sense which is derived\naccording to both biological and social ties. This is also true\nfor children who have lived in foster homes, though such chil-\ndren may have more complex patterns of biological and social\nties owing to their experiences in different home environ-\nments. The authority of the child welfare system can have the\neffect of giving sibling relations a high degree of intensity and\ndensity, but diversity and distance may also result.\nThe study shows that foster children may have biological\nsiblings with whom they live in the same foster home, who\nare in different foster homes or with whom they live after\nthey have moved back home again. Furthermore, the study\nshows that more foster children from different families may\nlive in the same foster home, and the foster family may have\ntheir own biological children. The children participating in\nthe study revealed different types of relations to their bio-\nlogical and foster siblings. One group experienced a mutual\nsense of belonging and care, another group experienced\nambivalent mutuality and care, and a third group experienced\nno mutuality and care at all. Because children are active\nagents in their own lives (Angel, 2010), they use the signifi-\ncance of their relationships with biological and foster sib-\nlings to negotiate their understandings of themselves. In this\ncontext, siblings'reciprocal relation to each other establishes\na sense of belonging and care. In turn, belonging and care are\nambivalent or absent when children define their relational\nexperiences in other ways.\nThe majority of the children in this study feel a sense of\nbelonging to their biological family. To have a comprehen-\nsible identity and a consistent biography, these children\nchose to distance themselves from their foster siblings. Those\nwho were placed in foster homes together chose each other,\nwhile those who were placed alone chose siblings who lived\nwith their mother. There were also children who were closely\nattached to their foster siblings and to their foster families as\nif these ties would last. There were even children who did not\nclaim any relation to their biological siblings and did not\nexperience any sense of belonging to them. Clearly, both bio-\nlogical and foster siblings can be important for a child's\ndevelopment, identity, and sense of belonging. The strict\ndefinition of \"sibling\" can vary according to a child's experi-\nence. My summarizing conclusion is that, for the children in\nthe study, biological siblings are the most important sibling\nrelation. At the same time, the study shows that, for some\nchildren, the sibling relation to other children is more impor-\ntant than the relation to the biological siblings. There is noth-\ning in the children's lives that immediately and objectively\nindicates which sibling relation is most meaningful to them;\nthis can only be understood through conversations with each\nindividual child.\nThe majority of the children in the study tended to display\nan either\u00ador sense of belonging vis-\u00e0-vis their siblings.\nSibling relationships vary according to whom they live with\nand how they perceive their social interactions, echoing\nMead's theory of the social self (Mead, 1934). Biological\nand social ties which can be re-created and maintained\nsocially become significant for sibling relations. For some\nchildren in the study, relations to other children could be\ncharacterized as \"pure relations\" (Giddens, 1992), in which\nthe children choose which relations they call siblings. For\nsome children in the study, social relations have precedence,\nwhile for others, biological ties are more significant.\nAccording to Mead's theory, to have a sense of who we are,\nwe must have a notion of where we come from and how we\nhave become who we are (Mead, 1934). This is the case for\nthe children in my study.\n8 SAGE Open\nChanges in environment, caregivers, and siblings show\nthat children's positions in relation to each other are not\n\"static.\" This observation agrees with the changing positions\nthat Mauthner (2002) describes in his research on sistering,\nwherein role reversals take place between the \"big sister\"\nrole of caregiver and \"little sister\" position of receiving care.\nChanges in sibling status may reflect strategic interaction, as\nThe study shows that sibling relations play a significant\nrole in children's developmental situations, particularly\nregarding how they take responsibility for and care for each\nother, and how they perceive and understand themselves.\nHaving to move back and forth between parents' homes and\nfoster homes precipitates a perceptual shift in which the\naffected children can no longer take common family rela-\ntionships for granted, and in turn become more conscious\nabout themselves and their siblings. We have also seen that\nsome foster children attach themselves to foster siblings in a\npositive way, and that this relation significantly affects their\nself-perception. Others, however, maintain distance from\ntheir foster siblings to clearly establish that they belong to\nanother family. The study by Cicirelli (1995), as well as\nfirms these findings about the construction of meaning in\nsibling relationships. Hegar (2005b) further shows that sib-\nling placements are more stable than situations where chil-\ndren are placed separately. Although my study did not\nspecifically focus on this distinction, it does show how\nimportant the biological sibling relationship may be for\nchildren.\nTo have continuity in one's own story--and to be able to\ninterpret this story--is important for everyone. This identity\ndepends on the biography as the individual reflexively under-\nstands it (Mead, 1934). The stories and perceptions revealed\nby the children in my study confirm this theory. Another\nfinding from the interviews was that most children do not\ntalk much about their foster siblings and their relations with\nthem in positive terms. Furthermore, the study shows that the\nfoster children negotiate the siblings' roles in relation to sib-\nlings who live back home, siblings who are born while they\nthemselves live in foster homes, and the foster parents' own\nchildren. This builds on Punch's (2005) finding that siblings'\nroles vary in relation to the children's gender, age, and posi-\ntion in the sibling group. Caring about biological siblings,\nrivalry and conflict with biological siblings, or having to\ncompare oneself with the foster parents' own children\nstrengthens the children's perception of themselves and their\nidentity, and a sense of belonging becomes a central feature.\nSimilarly, in line with McIntosh and Punch's (2009) finding\nthat children may view their siblings as a source of rivalry\nand conflicts, the children in my study define their sibling\nrelations from biology, relations, intimacy, and whether or\nnot they have cohabitated. These findings confirm and build\nupon findings from prior research on siblings and stepfami-\nThese findings highlight a number of challenges in plac-\ning siblings in the same foster home. Many child welfare\nservices in Norway are experiencing a growing housing cri-\nsis, as they struggle to place children in a time of financial\nretrenchment, staff turnover, and other procedural difficul-\nties. Similar challenges have been reported both in the\nUnited States (Schorr, 2000) and Great Britain (Randall,\nCowley, & Tomlinson, 2000). Despite these trying circum-\nstances, expectations dictate that siblings should be placed\ntogether. Many foster children had siblings, or half-siblings\nwho may not have shared a home, prior to their removal by\nthe social welfare services. The diverse situations of chil-\ndren in the public child welfare system make it very chal-\nlenging to place children with their siblings (Hegar, 2005b).\nThey often come into care at different times, and sometimes\nsocial welfare services may not have a complete picture of\nthe children's relationships. Members of several sibling\ngroups have individual needs that may require different\nlevels of care. Some are part of large sibling groups with\nwide age spans, which poses a challenge to placing them all\nin a single home. Despite these challenges, it is encourag-\ning that sibling placements have become a priority for child\nwelfare services in Norway.\nSome of the limitations of the present study include the\nself-recruitment of the informants and their relatively small\nnumber. Furthermore, the age range of informants is rela-\ntively large. Although it is widely understood that siblings\nwill fare the best by being placed together, lack of foster\nhomes can lead to placement in separate homes. Despite this,\nmy findings have several practical implications. Child wel-\nfare services should acknowledge the importance of getting\nto know each individual child and his or her sibling\nrelationship(s), of learning what they represent for each\nchild, and of considering each child's point of view.\nChildren's relationships with siblings must be addressed,\nboth before and during the process of choosing foster homes.\nFurthermore, this perspective must be maintained through-\nout the entire foster care period. Children's relationships\nwith siblings--biological as well as foster siblings--seem to\nbe important to them. While we still do not know enough\nabout the significance of contact with siblings during stays in\nfoster homes, my study shows that children develop their\nidentity and sense of belonging through ties with both bio-\nlogical siblings and foster siblings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlderson, P.
