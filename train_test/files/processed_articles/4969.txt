    "abstract": "Abstract: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the\ngastrointestinal tract. Treatment options include biologic therapies; however, a proportion\nof patients lose response to biologics, partly due to the formation of anti-drug antibodies\n(ADAbs). Concomitant immunosuppressive agents reduce the development of ADAbs. This\nreview article aims to assess the immunogenicity of biologic therapies and their clinical\nimplications. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for articles published January\n2009 to August 2015 reporting immunogenicity to adalimumab (ADM), certolizumab pegol\n(CZP), golimumab, infliximab (IFX), ustekinumab, and vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD). Eligible articles were reviewed and quality assessed by independent reviewers.\nOverall, 122 publications reporting 114 studies were assessed. ADAbs were reported for\nall agents, but the percentage of patients developing ADAbs was extremely variable, with\nthe highest (65.3%) being for IFX administration to patients with IBD. ADAb presence was\nfrequently associated with a reduction in primary efficacy and a loss of response, and, for\nIFX, an increase in adverse events (AEs). Lower serum levels of ADM, CZP and IFX were\nseen in ADAbs-positive rather than ADAbs-negative patients; pharmacokinetic data were\nunavailable for other therapies. Little information was available regarding the timing of ADAb\ndevelopment; studies reported their detection from as early as 10\u00ad14 days up to months after\ntreatment initiation. Biologic therapies carry an intrinsic risk of immunogenicity, although\nreported rates of ADAbs vary considerably. The clinical implications of immunogenicity are a\nconcern for effective treatment; further research, particularly into the more recently approved\nbiologics, is required.\n",

Both are chronic,\nimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders of the\ngastrointestinal tract, characterized by abdominal\npain, rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and fatigue.1\u00ad3 In\n(North America) and 322 (Europe) people per\nprevalence of both diseases reported to be increas-\ning in both regions.4\nAgents currently approved for the treatment of\nIBD include 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticoster-\noids, methotrexate (MTX), the thiopurines\nazathioprine and mercaptopurine and biologic\ntherapies targeting tumour necrosis factor\n(TNF)-alpha and integrins.5\u00ad7 Both the American\nCollege of Gastroenterology and European\nCrohn's and Colitis Organisation guidelines advise\nthat treatment should be tailored to the individual,\nconsidering disease severity and location, with bio-\nlogic therapies considered for those with moderate\nto severe disease who do not respond to, or are\nintolerant of, conventional therapy.5\u00ad9\nImmunogenicity of biologics in inflammatory\nbowel disease\nS\u00e9verine Vermeire, Ann Gils, Paola Accossato, Sadiq Lula* and Amy Marren\n Keywords: anti-drug antibodies, biologic therapy, Crohn's disease, immunogenicity,\nulcerative colitis\nCorrespondence to:\nS\u00e9verine Vermeire\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology,\nUniversity Hospitals\nLeuven, Herestraat 49,\nseverine.vermeire@\nuzleuven.be\nAnn Gils\nDepartment of\nPharmaceutical and\nPharmacological Sciences,\nKU Leuven, Leuven,\nBelgium\nPaola Accossato\nPfizer Innovative Health,\nPfizer S.r.l, Rome, Italy\nSadiq Lula\nMarket Access Solutions,\nEnvision Pharma Group\nLtd, London, UK\n*Employee of Envision\nPharma Group at time of\nstudy\nAmy Marren\nPfizer Innovative Health,\nPfizer Inc, Collegeville,\nSystematic Review\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 \n2 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nAlthough biologic therapies represent a major\nadvance in the treatment of IBD, and a high\nproportion of patients with moderate or severe dis-\nease respond well to biologics, at least 30% of\npatients fail to meet primary endpoints in clinical\ntrials,10,11 and a proportion of patients lose response\nover time.12 Immunogenicity is recognized as a\nleading contributor to the loss of response to biologic\ntherapies; as biologic agents are large, complex\nproteins, they trigger the formation of anti-drug\nantibodies (ADAbs) specific to the agent adminis-\ntered.13 Therefore, it is recommended that patients\nwho develop ADAbs to a biologic therapy, with a\nconsequent loss of response, should switch to a dif-\nferent agent with either the same or a different\nStudies of the immunogenicity of biologics have\nreported variability in the rate of formation of\nADAbs, and in the time post-exposure that\nADAbs develop, possibly due to differing immu-\nnogenicity assay methodologies.13 A number of\ndifferent techniques with varying specificity, sensi-\ntivity and cost are currently available to measure\nADAbs. Assay techniques include enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmu-\nnoassay (RIA) and electrochemi-luminescence\n(ECL), with some methods optionally incorporat-\ning an acid-dissociation step to improve sensitivity\nand increase the chances of detecting ADAbs even\nin the presence of high levels of antigen.17\u00ad20\nAim\nThe objective of the current analysis was to evalu-\nate and contextualize the immunogenicity of\napproved biologic therapies used to treat IBD in\norder to understand the clinical implications of\nthe rate, timeline and impact of the development\nof an immunogenic response to biologics.\nMethods\nThe methodological approach was described in a\nprotocol and followed the recommendations and\nstandards required by the UK National Institute\nfor Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\nand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.\nLiterature search\nA comprehensive search strategy was developed,\nand online searches were conducted for relevant\narticles published in the period January 2009 to\nA number of electronic sources were searched:\nMedline\u00ae and Embase\u00ae via the Ovid interface;\nCochraneCentralRegisterofTrials(CENTRAL);\nCochrane Database of Systematic Review\n(CDSR); NHS Economic Evaluation Database\n(NHS EED); Health Technology Assessment\n(HTA) Database; and Database of Abstracts of\nReviews of Effects (DARE) via the Cochrane\nLibrary. In addition to the online search, key con-\ngresses, published systematic literature reviews\n(capturing suitable studies published prior to\n2009) and the references in articles relevant to the\ntopic of interest were hand-searched. Details of\nthesearchstrategiesareincludedasSupplementary\nStudy eligibility and screening\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs\nand observational studies of patients with CD or\nUC were eligible. Case reports, case series, litera-\nture reviews, letters, commentaries and editorials\nwere excluded. Studies were included if they\nreported data for the biologics adalimumab\n(ADM), certolizumab pegol (CZP), golimumab\n(GLM), infliximab (IFX), ustekinumab (UST)\nand vedolizumab (VDM), administered to\npatients with CD or UC either as monotherapy or\nin combination with conventional therapy.\nAbstracts identified from the online search were\nscreened for eligibility by a reviewer. A second,\nindependent reviewer checked 10% of screened\nabstracts. Articles considered eligible were\nobtained and subjected to full-text review; any\nineligible studies were excluded, with the ration-\nale for exclusion documented. A second inde-\npendent reviewer screened 20% of excluded\npublications and all eligible publications; any dis-\ncrepancies between reviewers were resolved by\nconsensus.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nRelevant information was defined at the start of\nthe study, and a data extraction table\n(Supplementary Table 3) was developed to col-\nlect information obtained on full review of the\nselected articles. Selected articles were assessed\nfor quality in accordance with the recommended\nmethodology for systematic literature reviews.21\nS Vermeire, A Gils et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nOne reviewer screened all citations and full-text\npapers, which were then double-checked by an\nindependent reviewer. Likewise, data extraction\nwas conducted by a single reviewer, and subse-\nquently validated by an independent reviewer.\nFor RCTs, the quality of selected articles was\nassessed according to the NICE single technology\nappraisal manufacturer's template22 and the\nJadad scoring system.23 The quality of selected\nnon-RCTs and observational studies was assessed\nusing the Downs and Black instrument.24\nAbstracts from conference proceedings were\nassessed using a modified version of the Downs\nand Black instrument. Studies scoring poorly on\nany of the quality assessments were excluded\nfrom the main analyses.\nResults\nLiterature search\nscreened for eligibility; 938 articles were retrieved\nfor full-text review, and 114 studies reported in\n122 publications were finally assessed (Figure 1\nand Supplementary Table 4).\nBased on the full-text review of selected articles,\nfive studies were excluded due to low-quality\nassessment scores. Details of these studies, and\nthe reasons for their exclusion, are provided in\nSupplementary Table 5.\nOver 90% of studies included in the review\ninvolved administration of ADM or IFX. Only a\nfew studies were available for other agents; four,\ntwo, one and four studies were identified con-\ncerning CZP, GLM, UST and VDM treatment\nin IBD, respectively.\nRates of immunogenicity in patients receiving\ntreatment with biologics\nRates of ADAb formation were extremely varia-\nble (Table 1). A brief summary of factors affect-\ning the formation and detection of ADAbs is\nprovided in Supplementary Table 6. A total of 12\nRCTs and 62 non-RCTs or observational studies\nof IFX were reviewed, and rates of over 60% were\nobserved in six of these studies. The highest rates\nof ADAb formation were associated with IFX in\npatients with CD or UC (Table 1). The highest\nrate for any other agent was 38% for ADM in one\nretrospective cohort study (Table 1).\nRates of immunogenicity in patients receiving\ntreatment with infliximab\nIn total, 82 publications were identified, repre-\nsenting 78 studies on the immunogenicity of IFX;\nthe majority of these (87.2%) were observational\nstudies. Of the 78 studies reviewed, 74 reported\nthe percentage of patients developing ADAbs to\nIFX. One of these studies25 was excluded from\nthe analysis, as it reported a very high rate of\nimmunogenicity (79%) based on a small sample\nsize (n = 28). The percentage of patients with\nADAbs to IFX varied widely, from 0% to 65.3%\n(Table 1 and Figure 2(a)).\nRates of immunogenicity in patients receiving\ntreatment with adalimumab\nA total of 25 publications were identified, repre-\nsenting 23 studies. As was the case with IFX, the\nmajority of these (43.5%) were prospective obser-\nvational studies.

Two RCTs\nof GLM use in UC were identified, reporting that\npatients (Table 1). In the single identified study\nof UST immunogenicity, 0.7% of patients in an\nRCT of UST in CD developed ADAbs (Table 1).\nImpact of ADAb formation on treatment efficacy\nIn most of the included studies that evaluated\nefficacy, the presence of ADAbs was associated\nwith a reduction in efficacy. Efficacy was assessed\nin a variety of ways, including Crohn's Disease\nActivity Index (CDAI) response/remission, Mayo\nresponse, endoscopic improvement and treat-\nment discontinuation. In studies of IFX, the\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 \n4 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nproportion of patients achieving and maintaining\na response was generally lower for patients with\ndetected ADAbs than those without detected\nADAbs (Supplementary Table 7). ADAbs to\nADM were also associated with reduced efficacy\nand a loss of response, together with a high rate\nof secondary treatment failure; these associ-\nations were shown to be statistically significant in\nFigure 1.

In one\nstudy,26 discontinuation of ADM treatment was\nreported to be very high (83.3%) in patients with\nADAbs (Supplementary Table 8).\nImpact of ADAb formation on treatment safety\nIn studies of IFX, AEs were more common in\npatients with ADAbs than in those without\nADAbs. AEs observed included a higher propor-\ntion reporting infusion-related reactions. The\nstudies for ADM, CZP, GLM, VDM or UST\nreported either no safety data segmented by\nADAbs status or no increased safety concerns\nassociated with the development of ADAbs.\nImpact of ADAb formation on treatment\npharmacokinetics\nFor studies included in this review in which serum\nlevels of biologics were reported \u00ad ADM, CZP\nand IFX \u00ad ADAbs-positive patients had lower\nserum levels of the biologic than ADAbs-negative\nTime course of immunogenicity\nMinimal information was available regarding\nthe earliest time at which immunogenicity was\ndetected. Furthermore, the timing of dosing\nand subsequent testing for ADAbs varied\nbetween studies. The majority of studies\nreported ADAbs testing in serum taken prior to\nthe next infusion (trough). ADAbs can occur as\nearly as 10\u00ad14 days post-dosing, and this find-\ning has been reported in some studies. However,\nADAbs can also take months to reach detectable\nPharmacoeconomics\nWe identified only one study that addressed phar-\nmacoeconomic issues related to the development\nof immunogenicity to biologic therapy in IBD; this\nDanish study involved 69 patients with CD with\nsecondary IFX failure receiving either IFX dose\nintensification (5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or inter-\nventions based on serum IFX and IFX antibody\nlevels.62 The authors concluded that monitoring of\nADAbs to IFX in patients with CD was more cost-\neffective than dose escalation without drug moni-\ntoring and immunogenicity assessment.\nDiscussion\nDevelopment of immunogenicity occurs with all\nsix of the biologic agents investigated in patients\nwith IBD. Huge variability in the rate of immuno-\ngenicity was observed, depending on the timing\nof sampling, the assay technique (drug sensitive\nversus drug tolerant), the study population (agent-\nna\u00efve or experienced and concomitant medica-\ntionstaken),thesetting(RCTsversusobservational\nstudy), and the criteria for a positive finding (a\nsingle sample or multiple samples above the\ndefined threshold). Care must therefore be taken\nin the interpretation and comparison of these\nfindings.\nThe timing of sampling (prior to or just after the\nnext administration) greatly influences the detec-\ntion rate. Most assays do not detect ADAbs in the\nTable 1.

This might be one expla-\nnation for the formation of ADAbs being reported\nto be lower in RCTs than in observational studies.\nOften, a limited number of time points were stud-\nied, and insufficient time was allowed for drug lev-\nels to decrease prior to sampling. However, it is\nalso likely that improved assay techniques used in\nobservational studies, together with the selection\nof patients with loss of response, led to higher lev-\nels of detection of ADAbs than in RCTs.\nThe immunogenicity reported for biologic agents\nused in IBD may adversely impact pharmacoki-\nnetics, efficacy and safety. Development of\nADAbs to biologic therapy may therefore have a\nsubstantial impact on patients with IBD, as the\nFigure 2.

Neutralizing\nADAbs produced in response to TNFi bind to\nthe epitope binding (Fab)2\nregion of the TNFi,\nthereby reducing the agents' therapeutic activ-\nity.65 By contrast, non-neutralizing antibodies do\nnot prevent binding of the agents to target mole-\ncules, and hence do not reduce the efficacy of bio-\nlogic agents; they do, however, impact the\npharmacokinetics, by accelerating clearance of\nthe agent.66 It is also known that some ADAbs are\ntransient in nature. These may appear at any time\nduring treatment and seem to be of little clinical\nGiving biologic therapies in combination with\nconcomitant immunosuppressive agents has been\nshown in several studies to reduce the development\nof ADAbs.67,68 One meta-analysis demonstrated\nthat the use of concomitant immunosuppressants,\nprimarily MTX, reduced the proportion of\npatients on IFX and ADM with detectable ADAbs\nby about 41% in those with rheumatoid arthritis,\nspondyloarthritis, psoriasis and IBD.67 However,\nthe mechanism for this attenuation is not fully\nunderstood.68 Therefore, reducing the likelihood\nof a patient developing an immunogenic response\nto a biologic therapy may influence decisions\nmade by the clinician in regard to the treatment\nprescribed for patients with IBD. There is evi-\ndence that scheduled treatment with IFX not only\nresults in improved efficacy69 compared with epi-\nsodic treatment, but that this is associated with a\nreduced level of immunogenicity.70 Clinicians\nshould also consider administering a loading dose\nof a biologic at the commencement of therapy,\nbecause, in addition to achieving therapeutic levels\nrapidly, this has been reported to reduce immuno-\ngenicity,71 as has intravenous hydrocortisone treat-\nment immediately prior to infusion with IFX.72\nPotential limitations of the present study include\nthe diversity of study design, patient populations,\ndisease severity, concomitant therapies, assay\nmethods and timing of the studies reviewed. This\nlack of standardization limited comparison across\nstudies and between therapies. In addition, limited\ninformation was available for a number of the bio-\nlogic agents included in the systematic literature\nsearch, with over 90% of studies reporting on IFX\nand ADM, reflecting the time these agents have\nbeen on the market compared to the other agents\ninvestigated. Not all studies reported data for some\nof the immunogenicity-related outcomes related to\nefficacy and safety, limiting conclusions on the\nimpact of the development of ADAbs. It is also\npossible that rates of immunogenicity, as well as\nsafety and efficacy outcomes, may have been under-\nestimated in a number of the studies included in\nthe review, due to insufficient sensitivity of the\nassay techniques used, small sample sizes, and lim-\nited follow-up of sampling (after wash-out of the\nbiologic agent).\nThe potential clinical implication of lower biologic\nserum concentrations, reduced efficacy, and\nincreased safety issues in the presence of immuno-\ngenicity is a concern for effective treatment and\nrequires further study. In particular, more studies\nare required to assess the immunogenic potential\nof the more recently approved biologics. However,\nthis analysis suggests that agents that elicit the\nlowest rate of immunogenicity may be preferential\nfor treating CD and UC. Immunogenicity is one\nof the major causes for loss of response to biologic\ntherapy,13 but immunogenicity must be assessed\nand interpreted in an appropriate manner. It is\nessential that research to improve understanding\nof immunogenicity and identify agents with lim-\nited immunogenic potential continues, in order to\nprovide safe and effective treatment options.\n"
