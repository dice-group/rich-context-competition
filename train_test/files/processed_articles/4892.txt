They may be tempted to identify such pressure as being\nexerted by the business interests of their university, driven in\nturn by student demands to make courses easier. The view of\nSadler (2009) is that \"grade inflation occurs when high\ngrades are awarded for progressively lower and lower\nachievements\" (p. 823). It also implies that some students,\nwho would not otherwise do so, will pass assessments. He\nargues for grade integrity, which\nis defined as the extent to which each grade awarded, either at\nthe conclusion of a course or module of study, or for an extended\nresponse to an assessment task, is strictly commensurate with\nthe quality, breadth and depth of a student's performance.\nA number of harmful consequences of grade inflation have\nbeen identified. It leads to a compression of grades, making it\ndifficult for employers to distinguish between students of dif-\nferent abilities. Different degrees of grade inflation lead to\nuneven, and hence unfair, assessment (Abbott, 2008). The\ncredibility of grades can be undermined so that employers turn\nto other methods of evaluating job applicants (Wongsurawat,\na graduate owns a degree at a particular grade would be send-\ning a misleading signal to potential employers.\nIt is understandable in such situations to regard teaching\nstaff as defending academic standards on largely ethical\ngrounds in opposition to business interests, which would be\nserved by easier degree courses. This would be unfortunate.\nBy broadening the perspective and looking at some of the\neconomic forces that influence demand for degrees, it can be\nseen that well-established and validated marketing theory\ndoes not suggest that there will always be this conflict\nbetween academic and business interests.\nTo test this theory in the context of online education, we\nconducted a survey aimed at online students who were just\nabout to complete their online master's degrees offered by\nthe University of Liverpool. The participants were asked\nabout the effect on the perceived value of their degrees of a\nnumber of changes which were directly or indirectly associ-\nated with grade inflation. These changes were generally seen\nas reducing the value of their degrees, thus potentially harm-\ning the business interests of the university.\nTheory\nPricing and the Sacrifice\nKotler andArmstrong (2010), in their classic work, Principles\nof Marketing, state that \"consumers usually perceive higher-\npriced products as having higher quality\" (p. 317).

Teas and Agarwal (2000) write about extrinsic product\ncues, such as price and brand name, affecting in a positive\nway perceptions of quality. Andr\u00e9 Gabor, one of the pioneers\nin the field of research about price as an indicator of quality,\ngives examples of products that increased their sales when\nthey put up their prices. He maintains that such judgments\nabout quality are based more on consumers' experience than\non their ignorance.\nthe customer bent on a purchase will approach the market with\ntwo price limits in mind: an upper limit beyond which he would\nconsider the item too expensive for his purposes. And a lower\nlimit below which he could not trust the quality (p.254).\nBetween this upper and lower limit, price will not act as\nan absolute barrier to purchase (Gabor & Granger, 1966).\nThis builds on earlier insights by French researchers whose\nwork is not quite as accessible to those working in the English\nMarketing theory is flexible enough to realize that there\nare costs that are not related to financial price involved in the\nacquisition of goods and services. These total perceived\ncosts, financial and non-financial, are often referred to as the\ngive or sacrifice (Zeithaml, 1988). The latter term is particu-\nlarly pertinent to university students taking a degree. The\nstress involved in balancing competing demands on time can\nbe considerable. The suffering involved in acquiring a degree\nis particularly acute among part-time mature students who\nhave so many more commitments than their younger full-\ntime counterparts. These are the kind of students who are\ntaught on completely online master's degree programs run\nby Laureate Online Education on behalf of the University of\nLiverpool. The university is believed to be the biggest pro-\nvider of online master's degrees in Europe. The students\nhave an average age of around 38, and are drawn from all\nparts of the world.\nThe current authors' research focused on the question of\nwhether it is possible that, in certain circumstances, degrees\nthat involve greater sacrifice are perceived as having more\nvalue. Conversely, those degrees which involve few sacri-\nfices could be seen as being of poor quality. If this is so, then\nthere may well be an alignment of academic and business\ninterests. The teacher who protects academic standards could\nbe maintaining the value and economic desirability of the\nproduct.\nPerceived Value\nAlves (2010) conducted a wide ranging review of the litera-\nture on perceived value in higher education. Sancjez-\nFernandez and Iniesta-Bonillo (2007) performed a similar\nservice in looking at perceived value in general. Some of the\nliterature treats perceived value as the net value of a product\nafter all the pluses and minuses have been added up. In the\ndefinition of Zeithaml (1988), perceived value is \"the con-\nsumer's overall assessment of the utility of a product based\non perceptions of what is received and what is given\" (p. 14).\nThe weakness of this is that it hides much of the detail. In\nparticular, it does not tell us whether a high level of sacrifice\nis perceived as a plus or a minus. Too often, the sacrifice is\nseen as unambiguously negative, ignoring the obvious exam-\nple of luxury goods where a high price is often seen as a posi-\ntive feature.\nAdjuncts\nThe term adjunct is peculiar to certain countries, particularly\nthe United States, and it is not in widespread use in the\nUnited Kingdom. It usually refers to a part-time teacher\nwithout security of employment. A number of studies have\nsuggested that the greater use of adjuncts, particularly in\nonline classes, has contributed to the increase in grade infla-\ntion. Because there is no convenient British equivalent, the\nterm adjunct will be used here.\nIf grade inflation is the result of inexorable pressures on\ndegrees that rely on the use of adjuncts, then this would tend\nto undermine the argument in this article. This is because the\nUniversity of Liverpool qualifications delivered by Laureate\nOnline Education are taught almost exclusively by adjuncts.\nThe evidence must therefore be considered.\nKezim, Pariseau, and Quinn (2005) looked at grades at an\nAmerican college over a 20-year period and concluded that\nadjuncts contributed to additional grade inflation. A popular\nexplanation of this phenomenon is that adjuncts are judged\nlargely or exclusively on student evaluations, and higher\ngrades are a means of trying to increase popularity. The inse-\ncurity of employment experienced by adjuncts is suspected\nof increasing this desire to curry favor.\nEwing (2011) found there was a positive correlation\nbetween students' expected grades and their evaluations of\nteachers. The study of Love and Kotchen (2010) concludes\nthat \"increased institutional emphasis on teaching evalua-\ntions can exacerbate the problems of grade inflation and\ninadvertently lower faculty teaching effort\" (p. 162).\nThe research of Langbein (2008) discovered that actual\nand expected grades had an effect on student evaluations of\nteaching. Because of the widespread use of such evaluation\nmethods in the United States, she feared that they would fuel\nuniversal grade inflation, although this would be particularly\nacute in private colleges. Eiszler's (2002) examination of\nwere significantly related to expected grades. Crumbley,\nFlinn, and Reichelt (2010) feel that student evaluations\nencourage a range of unethical behavior in teachers aimed at\nimproving ratings without increasing learning.\nBar, Kadiyali, and Zussman's (2009) study reports that\n\"in the spring semester of 1998, Cornell University started\npublishing median course grades on the Internet. Our\nKingsley and Sharon 3\nanalysis finds that the provision of grade information online\ninduced students to select leniently graded courses\" (p. 107).\nIn assessing the impact of such practices on adjuncts,\nSonner (2000) finds that adjunct instructors, keen to improve\ntheir evaluation results, did give higher grades than full-time\nteachers. Cavanaugh's (2006) research suggests that a typical\nstudent would receive a B grade from an adjunct and a C\nfrom a full-time member of staff. It is not perhaps an accident\nthat most of the evidence for grade inflation is coming from\nthose who teach undergraduates in the United States.\nThe degrees which are featured in this current article are\nnormally taught by teachers who are all adjuncts. Their mod-\nule managers, faculty managers, and directors of online stud-\nies are also adjuncts. A large number of these come from the\nUnited States, where grade inflation might well be a daily\nreality of their teaching on campus. All online teachers are\nsubject to student evaluations at the end of every module. At\nthe same time, there has, to date, been a strong culture of\nopposing grade inflation.\nThe degree programs described in this article apply very\nstrict grading criteria. Only around 20% of the students could\nexpect to receive A or A* grades. This can be contrasted with\nthe case at Princeton University, which reported as a success\nthe fact that the proportion of A+, A, and A- grades on\ndents are generally advised that a Grade C at Liverpool is\nequivalent to Grade B in the United States. There is no inter-\nnal evidence that grades have increased over the decade in\nwhich the oldest of the University of Liverpool online\ndegrees have been provided. How is that possible?\nThe answer is that instructors can normally gain no advan-\ntage by providing higher grades to students in the absence of\nevidence that work of superior quality has been produced.\nAlthough student evaluations are used, they constitute just\none of many indicators of performance for online teachers.\nAlongside such evidence, a faculty manager will consider\nwhether the grading profile of a teacher is significantly dif-\nferent from his or her peers. It would certainly be considered\nundesirable if popularity had been bought, intentionally or\notherwise, by the offering of higher grades. Thus, a teacher\ndemonstrates that he or she is valuable to the university\npartly by showing that he or she does not award higher grades\nwithout justification.\nThe conclusion is that there is nothing inevitable about\ngrade inflation in circumstances where there is an intensive\nuse of adjuncts subject to student evaluations. The negative\nconsequences are purely the result of specific academic or\nbusiness decisions, which in turn seem to be the result of\nvery poor management. If a university chooses to make\nappointment and promotion decisions based solely or pre-\ndominantly on student evaluations, particularly in the face of\nevidence that undergraduates respond to those who grade\ngenerously, then it should expect to be embarrassed.\nIn the world of online education, where all interactions\ncan be stored in a virtual learning environment, there is no\nexcuse for lazy management. A broad range of data is typi-\ncally available in an electronic form so that more rounded\nevaluations of teachers can take place. Teaching in a goldfish\nbowl, where teachers realize that everything they have ever\nwritten to any student in the last 10 years is available to\nexternal regulatory bodies such as the Quality Assurance\nAgency for Higher Education (QAA), is not always comfort-\nable. It does, however, provide relatively unambiguous evi-\ndence of who did and said what to whom. Unjustified\ncriticisms of instructors can be refuted by documentary evi-\ndence, and teaching staff are less reliant on receiving positive\nfeedback in circumstances where difficult decisions have to\nbe made.\nOleinik (2009) pessimistically concludes that \"grade\ninflation results from the substitution of criteria specific to\nthe search for truth by criteria of quality control generated\noutside of academia\" (p. 156). He did not foresee that certain\nsystems of quality control would be aimed at preventing\ngrade inflation on the understanding that courses with\ninflated grades are of reduced quality.\nAreas for Investigation\nIn this study, the approach was to isolate a number of vari-\nables to see whether something interesting, and possibly\nunexpected, could be identified. A cluster of three issues was\nidentified, which might be seen as associated with grade\ninflation and a lowering of academic standards.\n1. The level of sacrifice involved in obtaining a stu-\ndent's degree. We asked respondents to ignore the\ncost of fees and concentrate on other sacrifices they\nhad made. The question of tuition fee costs as a sign\nof quality was tested separately.\n2. The proportion of students who failed their degree or\nindividual modules (a module is an intensive class\nlasting 8 weeks). The survey asked about the case\nwhere the number of failures was very low. It was\nreasoned that where grades were uniformly inflated,\nthe number of failures would fall, and that questions\nsuch as this would be the easiest way of testing atti-\ntudes toward grade inflation.\n3. The numbers of students who dropped out of their\ndegree. Ormond Simpson (2003), in a book based on\nhis experiences at the Open University in the United\nKingdom, expresses the opinion that \"an institution\nthat awarded its own qualifications and had zero\ndropout might have difficulty in persuading both its\nstudents and the general public that its qualifications\nwere worth having\" (p. 11). Part of the current\nauthors' research was aimed at establishing how far\nthis was true.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe responses to some of the questions would probably\ndepend on the current situation. The reaction of students\ncould be different if they were enrolled on a degree course\nwhere grades were already inflated. As has been noted, the\nbaseline position was that grade inflation was not a problem,\nand students would therefore be expected to work hard for\ngood grades. It could not be considered easy to pass the\ndegrees in question. This is consistent with what colleagues\nin marketing would call the positioning of the degrees.\nTwo authors who pioneered the programs, Kalman and\nLeng (2007), write about \"the widespread public suspicion\nthat this educational [online] paradigm will be associated\nwith low standards and quality.\" They concluded that, in\novercoming this perception, \"quality cannot be bought\ncheaply\" (p.59). Computing colleagues, Grasso and Leng\n(2005), state that \"we believe firmly that the successful pro-\ngrammes of the future will be those that focus on pedagogy,\nand give precedence to academic standards and quality\nassurance, rather than those that emphasize technological\naspects or focus on low-cost delivery\" (p. 2386). This meets\nthe concerns expressed by Thirunarayanan (2001) a decade\nago that online education might lead to people receiving\ndegrees who did not really deserve them.\nA decision was taken to gather students' views through\nthe medium of an anonymous online survey. What the survey\nsought to measure was perceived value. Students were not\nasked to apply a range of objective criteria in making their\njudgments. In general, they were simply asked whether cer-\ntain things increased or decreased the value or quality of\ntheir degree in their eyes.\nMethod\nAn online survey was carried out in 60 small Research\nMethods classes of the University of Liverpool's online mas-\nter's degree programs. The main subjects were computing,\nbusiness administration, and management, with smaller\nnumbers from public health and clinical research administra-\ntion. Research Methods is the module students take toward\nthe end of their degree immediately before attempting their\ndissertation, and after completing 8 other modules (a module\nis an 8-week class). Some 369 students completed the survey\nanonymously with a response rate of 44.8%.\nOne of the concerns of using a publicly visible online sur-\nvey is that, either through misplaced enthusiasm or malice,\nthe web address could be made available to those outside the\ntarget audience. There is then a danger that the sample could\nbe corrupted by the presence of large numbers of respon-\ndents whom the researchers did not want to take part.\nTo reduce the risks of this happening, and to limit the\ndamage if it did, the authors used what they called, some-\nwhat tongue in cheek, the New Titanic Method. It will be\nrecalled that the RMS Titanic was meant to have a number of\nwatertight compartments which would help it stay afloat if\nthe hull was breached. In practice, the compartments were\nnot watertight, and the damage inflicted by a collision with\nan iceberg was so severe that the vessel sank.\nThe response was to divide the online survey into a number\nof compartments that were a little more watertight than those\non the Titanic. For each of the 60 classes that were surveyed, a\nblackboard message (internal email) was sent to every mem-\nber of a particular class inviting them to take part in the survey.\nEach class was directed to a separate web address.\nThe service that was used, SurveyGizmo, made it easy to\ngenerate new instances of the survey, each of which had its\nown web address. Hence, there were 60 copies of the survey\nresiding at 60 web addresses, and generating 60 separate data\nsets. These data sets were combined during the analysis.\nThe consequence of adopting this approach was that if a\nsingle web address was leaked to a wider audience, only one\ncompartment in our survey ship would be flooded by invalid\ndata. It could then be disregarded without corrupting the\nwhole survey. In the event, there is no evidence that such a\nleak occurred. The numbers responding to the survey never\nexceeded, or even approached, the number of students in\neach class.\nMany respondents did not have English as their first lan-\nguage, and so they were asked to indicate whether any ques-\ntion in the survey was so difficult for them to understand that\ntheir reply might not reflect their true opinion. Where a stu-\ndent indicated that a question fell into that category, the\nresponse to that question was discounted.\nStudents were asked for their age and gender, and the sur-\nvey service that was used, SurveyGizmo, identified their\nlocation from their IP address. Students were asked about the\nactual sacrifices they had made compared with the sacrifices\nthey expected to make; how important it was to them that\ntheir degree was being awarded by the University of\nLiverpool; their level of satisfaction with their degree course;\nand the survey asked about their views on the relationship\nbetween tuition fees and course quality.\nThe core of the survey addressed questions of perceived\nvalue in situations where changes were made that would gener-\nally make the course easier. These were grouped as follows:\n1. Questions that asked about the effect on the perceived\nvalue of the degree if, shortly after the student's grad-\nuation, changes were made that resulted in modules\nbeing much easier to pass, students being unlikely to\ndrop out of their degree because it was too difficult,\nor students finding that gaining a degree involved far\nfewer sacrifices.\n2. Questions about the effect on the perceived value of\nthe degree if it involved very little non-monetary sac-\nrifice, students hardly ever failed, or the drop-out rate\nwas close to zero.\n3. Questions about the effect on the University of\nLiverpool's reputation if students rarely failed mod-\nules or rarely dropped out because the work was too\nhard.\nKingsley and Sharon 5\nFor the most part, semantic differential questions were\nused, with possible options ranging from 7 (increased value/\nhigher reputation) to 1 (decreased value/lower reputation).\nThis has been treated as interval data for which the mean\nscore can legitimately be calculated. The choice by partici-\npants of the mid-point value 4 was assumed to indicate a\ndegree of neutrality or indifference toward the issue in ques-\ntion; scores of 5 to 7 were interpreted as being broadly posi-\ntive, and scores of 1 to 3 negative. The results which were\nconsistent with the authors' expectations would involve a\nmixture of high and low scores.\nResults\nSacrifice and Tuition Fees\nSome 79% of students indicated that their degree had\ninvolved greater sacrifices than they had expected. Only 5%\nthought it involved less sacrifices. The mean score was 5.5.\nAt the same time, 88% of the sample were satisfied with their\ndegree (M = 5.7) and 88% would recommend their degree to\nothers (M = 5.9). It can therefore be seen that there is no\nincompatibility between high student satisfaction and a\nhigher than expected degree of sacrifice.\nThe assumption had been that high tuition fees would not\nbe a strong indicator of course quality, and that other aspects\nof the give or sacrifice involved in obtaining a degree would\nbe more important. This was confirmed by the survey. When\nasked whether courses with high tuition fees were typically\nof better quality than those with lower tuition fees, respon-\ndents produced a mean score of 3.8 (median = 4). The num-\nbers of positive, neutral, and negative responses were almost\nprecisely equal.\nChanges to Degrees After Graduation\nPossibly the most significant results from the survey were\nproduced by the questions that asked about future changes\nthat would make degrees easier in certain specified respects\nafter the student had graduated. The general conclusion was\nthat students would see such changes as devaluing their\ndegree. This would be likely to generate significant negative\nword-of-mouth (as well as negative social network and email\ntraffic) about their degree program.\nIf, in future, it would be much easier to pass each module\non the degree, 69% of the respondents felt that this would\ndecrease the value of their degree and only 14% believed that\nits value would increase (M = 2.8, median = 3). Similarly,\n66% saw a future degree that would involve far fewer sacri-\nfices on the part of students as involving a lowering of value.\nJust 12% of the sample thought this would increase the\ndegree's value (M = 3.0, median = 3).\nThroughout the survey, respondents were less concerned\nabout low drop-out rates as a negative indictor, but 52% of\nthe sample believed that a future in which students would be\nunlikely to drop out of their degree because it was too diffi-\ncult would signal a qualification that had less value. Twenty-\nfive percent took the contrary view (M = 3.4, median = 3).\nThe mean scores for these three questions are highlighted in\nFigure 1. The percentage of respondents who thought these\nchanges would be positive or negative is represented in\nLess Sacrifice, Low Failure/Drop-Out Rates\nThe next set of questions involved subtle differences in\nwording. Instead of being asked about failing modules, stu-\ndents were quizzed about their view if people hardly ever\nfailed their degree. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents felt\nthis would decrease the value of the qualification. This repre-\nsented a slight softening of attitudes, because degree failure\nwas clearly a harsher penalty than module failure, and hence\na higher price to pay for degree quality. However, the polar-\nity of student opinion was clear, with only 14% feeling the\ndegree would increase in value (M = 3.2, median = 3).\nWhen asked how they would rate their degree if it involved\nvery little sacrifice on their part, 60% said their qualification\nwould decrease in value, with 15% taking the contrary view\nFigure 1. Mean values for the assessment of future changes.\nFigure 2. Percentages of those who saw changes as having a\npositive or negative effect on the value of the degree.\n6 SAGE Open\n(M = 3.1, median = 3). A drop-out rate close to zero was seen\nas a negative thing by 46% of the respondents, whereas 23%\nsaw it as positive (M = 3.6, median = 4). In this case, the rea-\nson for dropping out was not mentioned in the question. A\nsummary of the relevant percentages is set out in Figure 3.\nThe University's Reputation\nThe University of Liverpool brand proved to have been an\nimportant factor in attracting students to their degree pro-\ngram. Many online degrees are offered by institutions whose\nnames are not immediately recognizable. Liverpool is one of\nthe older British civic or redbrick universities formed around\nthe turn of the 20th century. It is a member of the Russell\nGroup, a collection of research-intensive universities in the\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the survey, 85% of the students indicated that the fact\nthat the University of Liverpool was offering their degree\nwas important or very important. Only 6% thought this fac-\ntor was unimportant (M = 5.9, median = 6). Students were\ntherefore asked about the effect of certain scenarios on the\nLiverpool brand. The result of students rarely failing mod-\nules on their degree course would, in the opinion of 49% of\nthe respondents, lower the reputation of the university (M =\nA very significant 29% of the sample opted for the mid-\npoint value on the scale, indicating some degree of indiffer-\nence. If that assumption of indifference is correct, then the\nnatural conclusion is that the university does not need to\nworry about the reaction of a certain proportion of its stu-\ndents to modules getting easier. The reaction is likely to be\nneither positive nor negative. The focus will therefore switch\nto the proportions of students who react positively (22% in\nthis case) and negatively (49%). On balance, therefore, it\nwas concluded that modules that are rarely failed would\ndamage the reputation of the university.\nThe sample was also asked about the effect on the\nUniversity of Liverpool reputation if students rarely dropped\nout because the work was too hard. Here the results were\ninconclusive. The split meant that 35% thought this change\nwould lower the reputation of the university, 36% thought it\nwould give Liverpool a higher reputation, and 29% were\nindifferent (M = 4.0, median = 4).\nAlthough the question did specify a particular reason why\nstudents might drop out of degree courses, informal feedback\nsuggested some participants might have taken account of\nother reasons, such as illness or a change in personal circum-\nstances. The retention of students under these difficult cir-\ncumstances would be seen as a positive sign. It was also\nlikely that the reputation of the university was considered so\nrobust that changes were less likely to damage its image.\nIt was concluded that the use of drop-out rates as a signal\nof perceived value was problematical and any future research\nwould require more incisive questioning to separate out the\nvarious factors involved.\nDemographics\nGender, geography, and age. Just 33% of the survey sample\nwas female. There were no statistically significant differ-\nences (p < .05) with the one- or two-tailed test in the answers\nprovided by men and women.\nIn analyzing the sample according to the part of the world\nin which students were resident, the only significant differ-\nences were between the 21% of students who came from\nAfrica and the rest. The results of this analysis are presented\nin Table 1. African students were more likely to believe that\nthe sacrifices they had had to make were greater than\nexpected (p = .0001) and to value the Liverpool brand in\nchoosing their degree (p = .00003). They were less likely to\nbelieve that future changes after their graduation that would\nmake their degrees easier would reduce the value of those\ndegrees. In the case where it would be much easier to pass\neach module, p = .002; where it would be unlikely for stu-\ndents to drop out because the degree was too difficult, p =\n.0007; where gaining a degree in the future would require far\nfewer sacrifices, p = .01. African students were more satis-\nommend it to someone else (p = .002). In almost all cases,\nthe polarity of African and non-African students' views was\nthe same, meaning they were both positive or negative in\nrelation to any particular question, but one group's attitudes\nwere stronger to a statistically significant degree. The two\nquestions where there was an opposite polarity were the\nabove mentioned case about future changes where students\nwould be less likely to drop out (African M = 4.1, non-Afri-\ncan M = 3.3), and the question that asked about the effect on\nLiverpool's reputation if students rarely dropped out (African\nAn examination of correlation results showed that the\nrelationship between age and other variables was almost\ncompletely random. Although age was not generally a deter-\nminant of outcomes, there were a few statistically significant\nFigure 3. Percentages of those who saw features as having a\npositive or negative effect on the value of the degree.\nKingsley and Sharon 7\ndifferences when comparing students who were above 40\n(38% of the sample) with the rest (the mean age of students\nwas 38). The older group felt in Q4 that the damage to the\nuniversity's reputation where students rarely dropped out\nwould be greater than it was in the eyes of younger students\n(p = .04). Similarly, the above 40s were in Q8 more con-\ncerned by future changes that would make it easier to pass\neach module (p = .02). They were a little more inclined in\nQ13 to believe that degrees with high tuition fees are of bet-\nter quality (p = .04). In Table 2, the lower scores indicate a\nlower perceived value or greater damage to the university's\nreputation.\nDegree comparisons. In comparing the results across degree\nprograms, the most noticeable feature was that there were\nrelatively few statistically significant differences. To isolate\nany variations that were peculiar to a particular degree pro-\ngram, a series of t test comparisons were conducted in which\nthose in Degree X were compared with a combined group\nconsisting of those not in Degree X.\nComputing students felt that they had made slightly fewer\nsacrifices to obtain their degree than other students (p =\n.006). With respect to future changes after graduation that\nwould make it easier to pass each module (p = .04) and make\nit unlikely that students would drop out because their degree\nwas too difficult (p = .03), computing students were a little\nmore likely to see these changes as negative. The level of\nwhich students could not recommend their degree to others\nwas higher than among non-computing students.\nManagement students were studying for an MBA or an\nMSc in management. These two groups did not display statis-\ntically significant differences, except in two less crucial\nareas--the latter felt the Liverpool brand was more important\nin choosing their degree, and they were more satisfied with\ntheir program. They were therefore treated as one group.\nIn a kind of mirror image of the computing students, the\nrespondents taking management degrees felt they had made\ngreater sacrifices than expected (p = .0008). In choosing a\nlevel at which the module failure rate was too high to recom-\nmend their degree to others, management students named a\nlower figure than other respondents (p = .006).\nClinical research administration students were a little less\nlikely to recommend their degree to others (p = .005). In\nother respects, they were very similar in their views to those\nof other students taking other degrees.\nPublic health students had a higher average age of 41.\nThey made up just 10% of the total sample, and therefore, the\ncomparisons should be treated with some caution because of\nthe relatively small numbers involved. However, it was noted\nthat public health students were rather less concerned about\nthe effect of low drop-out rates on the value of their degree\n(p = .03) or on the reputation of the university (p = .05). They\nwere similarly less bothered by the effect of lower module\nfailure rates on the university's reputation (p = .0006), to the\nextent that, on this question, they actually saw the change as\nslightly positive (M = 4.2). They were even more likely to\nrecommend their degree to others (p = .04). The percentage\nat which module failure rates cast doubt on the quality of\ntheir degree is lower for public health students (p = .02), as is\nthe percentage drop-out rate at which the degree could not be\nrecommended to others (p = .03).\nNot Enough Sacrifice?\nThe authors wanted to get an idea of when the level of stu-\ndent module failures and dropouts due to the difficulty of the\ndegree was considered too high or too low. To answer these\nTable 2. Comparison of Students Above 40 With the Rest of the Sample.\nQuestion Above 40 M  40 M p (one-tailed) p (two-tailed)\nTable 1. Comparison of African Students With the Rest of the Sample.\nQuestion African M Non-African M p (one-tailed) p (two-tailed)\n8 SAGE Open\nquestions, use was made of some techniques employed in the\nPrice Sensitivity Meter of the Dutch economist Peter van\nWestendorp. The typical use of the Price Sensitivity Meter is\nto establish when the price of a product or service is consid-\nered to be too high or too low by potential consumers. It\noften helps in setting the price of a new product or in estab-\nlishing whether the current price of a product is appropriate\n(Lipovetsky, Magnan, & Zanetti-Polzi, 2011).\nThe approach of van Westendorp was adapted to the\nslightly different situation being addressed by ourselves.\nWhereas the original technique would ask when the price\nwas too low for it to be of good quality, in this study, respon-\ndents were asked about the average percentage of students\nwho fail each module:\nQ14: At what percentage would you consider the failure\nrate to be so low that the degree's quality would be\ndoubted?\nIn relation to the percentage of students who decide to\nwithdraw from their degree course (drop out) before the dis-\nsertation stage because the degree is too hard, the corre-\nsponding question was as follows:\nQ16: At what percentage would you consider the drop-\nout rate to be so low that the degree's quality would be\ndoubted?\nThe application of the Price Sensitivity Meter would then\nnormally involve asking respondents when the price was so\nhigh that they would not consider buying the product. The\ntwo questions that were asked in this survey to test the case\nwhere values were deemed to be too high were as follows:\nQ15: At what percentage would you consider the failure\nrate to be so high that the degree could not be recom-\nmended to others?\nQ17: At what percentage would you consider the drop-\nout rate to be so high that the degree could not be rec-\nommended to others?\nIn all cases, respondents were asked to select a value from\na drop down menu. The values available were in a range\nfrom 0% to 100% with 5% increments. The very first option\non the menu was \"No figure is too low\" in the case where we\nwere asking about values that were too low and \"No figure is\ntoo high\" when we were asking about values that were too\nhigh. Thus, participants were given every opportunity to\nindicate that they were not concerned about this issue.\nAlthough these questions were in a well-established for-\nmat, and the wording was as clear as it could reasonably be\nmade, the concepts involved were not necessarily easy to\ngrasp. The authors therefore included an optional question at\nthe end of the survey:\nWere any of our questions so difficult to understand that your\nreply might not reflect your true opinion?\nFor most of the survey questions, the numbers indicating\nthis degree of difficulty in understanding a question were\nvery small. In the case of Questions 14 to 17, it was more\nsignificant. The percentages indicating a degree of difficulty\nThe analysis of the data erred on the side of caution by\ndiscounting the replies to questions where respondents had\nindicated that their reply might not reflect their true opinion.\nHowever, a statistical examination of the replies to Questions\n14 to 17 of those who did and did not indicate this difficulty\nshowed that the difference between the mean values was not\nstatistically significant (p < .05) for any of the four questions.\nIn terms of the median scores, the inclusion of respondents\nwho had doubts about their reply reflecting their true opinion\nwould not have changed the median at all in the first three\nquestions. For Q17, the effect would have been to increase\nthe median from 45 to 50. The conclusion was that the doubts\nthat some respondents experienced had affected their\nresponses in the most trivial of ways. The exclusion of those\nwho had doubts did not affect the median or mean scores to\nany significant degree.\nThe right hand column in Table 3 has been interpreted as\nthe proportion of students who were indifferent to module\nfailure or drop-out rates in assessing degree quality (Q14 and\nQ16) or in deciding whether to recommend their degree to\nThe replies to Questions 15 and 17, which asked about\nwhen values were too high, were something of a surprise,\nbut were consistent throughout the phased conduct of the\nsurvey. They indicated that the level of satisfaction students\nfelt with their degree course was such that only when fail-\nure or drop-out rates were approaching 50% would a major-\nity begin to stop recommending their degree to others in\nTable 3. Students Who Were Indifferent to Low or High Failure or Drop-Out Rates.\nQuestion M Median % who replied \"no figure is too low (too high)\"\nKingsley and Sharon 9\nlarge numbers. The results did indicate a high tolerance of\nsignificant failure and drop-out rates on the part of the more\nretainable students.\nIn Questions 14 and 16, the authors have taken a cautious\napproach in drawing conclusions about minimum module\nfailure and drop-out rates by focusing on the median values.\nIt does seem clear that if these rates were to fall below 10%,\nthen large numbers of students are likely to see this as indi-\ncating a reduction in degree quality. A reasonable interpreta-\ntion of the data in Table 3 is that an average of 0% module\nfailures would be interpreted as a reduction in degree quality\nby 87.5% of the students. A drop-out rate of 0% would be\nsimilarly interpreted by 84.1% of the participants.\nPark and Choi (2009) outline a number of ways in which\nretention can be improved by legitimate means without grade\ninflation. There is, however, likely to be a level beyond\nwhich it is unwise to go if the perceived value of degrees is\nto be maintained.\nIn other questions, participants were asked about a drop-\nout rate that was close to zero, or where students rarely\ndropped out because the work was too hard. It was felt that\nasking about the situation where no-one dropped out would\nbe tantamount to asking about a situation that would never,\nin practice, happen. Respondents would have probably not\nseen this as a credible scenario. Although those taking the\nsurvey might not have difficulty in assessing the effect on\nperceived value of drop-out rates that were close to zero, or\nsituations where students rarely dropped out, there was\nalways the danger that they would privately define those\nterms differently.\nQ16, inspired by the Price Sensitivity Meter, showed that\na large majority of students were able to nominate a drop-out\nrate at which the degree's quality would be doubted, and just\n15.9% rejected the notion that there was any such figure.\nIt does seem to be a requirement of students' willingness\nto undergo a certain amount of suffering to obtain their\ndegree that such hardship is not seen as unjust or unreason-\nable. The degree satisfaction rates revealed in this survey\nsuggest that there is no such perception. Theoretically, this\ncan be linked back to the work of Andr\u00e9 Gabor (1967), who\nmaintained that a price (sacrifice) that was seen as neither\ntoo high nor too low by buyers and sellers could be regarded\nas a just price for a product or service.\nThe authors do acknowledge that where a university has a\nreputation for recruiting the most talented and motivated stu-\ndents in a particular country, such as is the case with the\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge in the United\nKingdom, the perceptions of what constitutes an acceptable\nminimum drop-out rate may well be much lower. In the\nabsence of such exceptional factors, it has been concluded\nthat there will routinely be minimum failure and drop-out\nrates below which it would be unwise for a university to fall.\nDegrees where everyone passes and nobody drops out\nbecause the work is too hard will typically be viewed as qual-\nifications of poor quality.\nUntil around the 1960s, there was a reasonably wide-\nspread belief that a lower price was always better for the cus-\ntomer. This was not based on strong empirical evidence, and\nwhen empirical studies were carried out, it was soon discov-\nered that prices could be too low as well as too high, and that\nthis finding was not limited to the special case where rich\nbuyers were trying to impress their friends (Gabor & Granger,\nverge of acknowledging the business problems created by\nuniversities whose degrees are obtained at a level of suffer-\ning that is too low.\nCorrelation Analysis\nWhere students were satisfied with their degree, they would\ntypically recommend it to others. A correlation of .76\nbetween these two variables underlined this close relation-\nship. The results of the correlation analysis are shown in\nThe key questions in the survey, which asked about how\nchanges or different scenarios would affect the quality of\ndegrees or the reputation of the university, were Q2 to Q9.\nIn Questions 8, 9, and 10, respondents were asked to indi-\ncate whether the suggested change would increase or\ndecrease the value of their degree. It will be recalled that in\neach case, students were presented with a 7-point semantic\ndifferential scale. See the Appendix for the wording of\nquestions.\nAn analysis showed that there were a few questions where\nreplies were quite well correlated (> .40) with other responses.\nA key question was the following:\nTable 4. Correlation Matrix.\nQ6: If students on your degree rarely failed modules, how\nwould that affect the University of Liverpool's\nreputation?\nRespondents were asked to select a point on a scale indi-\ncating whether the university would have a higher or lower\nreputation. The replies were well correlated with six out of\nseven similar questions, indicating that it was a reasonable\npredictor of other attitudes. Knowing the answer to this ques-\ntion would provide a fair indication of (correlation figures in\nbrackets) the value of the student's degree if people hardly\never failed (.59); its value if the drop-out rate was close to 0\n(.46); the effect on the university's reputation if students\nrarely dropped out because the work was too hard (.52); the\nrespondent's attitude if, in the future, each module was much\neasier to pass (.43); the attitude toward a future change where\nstudents would be unlikely to drop out because their degree\nis too difficult (.41); and the student's attitude toward a\ndegree that would in future require far fewer sacrifices (.45).\nEstablishing the relationship between concepts by math-\nematical means is sometimes a little like typing a letter wear-\ning boxing gloves, but the mathematical relationships can be\nsuggestive. For the authors, the cluster of correlations around\nQ6 pointed to the centrality of the Liverpool brand and to\nanything that would damage the university's reputation.\nIt has already been seen that the brand was an important\nfactor in students choosing their degree. The most natural\ninterpretation of the data is that if a degree's becoming easier\nis seen as damaging the brand, then similar changes (as\ndescribed in other questions) would also be seen in a nega-\ntive light. Only where the change was not seen as damaging\nthe brand would it be viewed as having no harmful effect on\nthe quality of a degree. This is also true of future changes that\nmight be made after graduation. Such changes were likely to\nbe seen as diluting the value of a Liverpool degree obtained\nat some point in the past.\nThe other area with the highest correlations was that relat-\ning to future changes after graduation. The correlations were\ntended to see such changes as being distinctly all positive or\nall negative.\nDiscussion\nReduced Value\nThe results of the survey show that, at least in certain circum-\nstances, students do perceive high pass rates, low drop-out\nrates, and degrees that involve very little sacrifice on their\npart as reducing the value of their qualification. This percep-\ntion is particularly strong in the case where post-graduation\nchanges are proposed that would make the degree easier to\nobtain. Students who have made great sacrifices to gain a\nmaster's degree would be particularly unhappy at seeing\ntheir degree devalued.\nThe survey sample consisted of students who were survi-\nvors. Those who had dropped out (typically in the first or\nsecond module of the degree) could have a different view.\nHowever, the authors'informed conjecture is that the support\nservices offered to online students by Laureate and Liverpool\nare gradually eliminating avoidable dropouts. Those who\nleave are increasingly likely to be those who see how hard\nthe online program is and realize that they cannot fit it into\ntheir schedule.\nIf this is true, then at least some of these early dropouts\nare possibly a necessary evil in proving that this example of\nonline education is not an easy option. It would seem a far\nbetter business option to appeal to those who are similar to\nthe people in the sample who had demonstrated that they\nwere retainable. Their desire is for degrees that, through the\nsacrifices involved, indicate their high value.\nThe authors' research highlighted a cluster of interesting\nvariables. It is possible that other variables will have an\neffect on students'attitudes toward degrees that are challeng-\ning. Further research in comparing the influence of different\nvariables would be welcomed.\nThe high proportion of students who felt that their degree\nhad involved greater sacrifices than they expected does sug-\ngest that, at the time of their enrolling for the degree, the\nmarketing and other university literature did not prepare\nthem satisfactorily for what was to come. This may have\nchanged in more recent times.\nThis does point to the dangers of being unduly positive in\npromotional material. It can inflate avoidable drop-out rates.\nFirst, because those who have believed the myths about\nonline education being an easy option do not have those\nmyths sufficiently dispelled by what they read about their\ndegree. This encourages applications from people who are\nnot suited to the workload or the pedagogical/andragogical\nmodel used. Such people might not apply if promotional\nmaterial consistently pointed out how difficult study was\nlikely to be.\nSecond, being more realistic in public statements would\nreduce the number of avoidable dropouts among students\nwho felt that they were failures because they found online\neducation extremely challenging. A university can say, \"This\ndegree course is going to be very difficult, but ultimately\nrewarding. You will experience many problems in balancing\nall your commitments, but we have the support services that\ncan help you.\"\nSuch an approach would tend to engender different expec-\ntations, so that the student might think, \"I have problems, but\nthis is normal. It does not mean that I am inadequate.\" It is\nalso likely that there are strong potential students who have\nbelieved the stories about online education being an easy,\nlow-quality option (which in some cases might be true). It is\npossible that more honest marketing, telling them that they\nwill have to suffer to gain a degree, would actually have a\npositive appeal. It could open up new markets by astute prod-\nuct positioning. In terms of signaling theory, it could be said\nKingsley and Sharon 11\nthat the university would be sending a signal to potential\nbuyers that its products were of high value (Spence, 2002).\nThe data suggest that retainable students taking the mas-\nter's degrees discussed in this article see factors that add to\nthe difficulty in obtaining their qualification as increasing its\nperceived value. This will inevitably influence their word-\nof-mouth recommendations (and these days that includes rec-\nommendations made by electronic means of communication).\nIn this case, there is strong evidence that academic and busi-\nness interests are aligned. Pressures for grade inflation and a\ndegree obtained with fewer sacrifices are likely to undermine\nthe value of the product and make it less attractive in the eyes\nof retainable students.\nA business manager who was asked \"How difficult is it to\nresist the temptations of grade inflation?\" could reasonably\nreply, \"It is quite easy. Grade inflation would damage our\nbusiness by making the product less attractive.\"\nThe Potential Scope of These Findings\nUnder what circumstances are these factors likely to apply?\nWhat is the scope of these conclusions? Marketing theory\nsuggests that when an organization is selling a high value,\nhigh price product, the high price can be a positive attraction.\nThis is because it makes the product exclusive. The owner\npossesses something that others do not have.\nIn education, it is the total sacrifice involved in obtaining\na degree, rather than the level of fees, that provides this\nexclusivity. Conversations between the authors and online\nstudents after graduation ceremonies suggest that it is pre-\ncisely because students have suffered to gain their degree\nthat they regard it as having a high value. Under no circum-\nstances would they accept that studying online was an easy\noption.\nAre all degrees likely to engender this feeling in their stu-\ndents? Almost certainly not. A master's degree, particularly\none from a reputable university (one with a strong brand) is\nstill something that sets an employee apart from others. It\ndoes, in many circumstances, still provide a career advan-\ntage. It is exclusive because large numbers of people do not\nhave a master's degree. In such circumstances, the business\npressures to combat grade inflation are likely to be strong.\nAlthough the amount of fees charged is not in itself crucial in\nindicating the quality or value of the degree, it is likely that\nstudents who perceive their degree as having a high value are\nmore willing to pay high fees.\nOn the other hand, where the possession of certain kinds\nof degrees becomes commonplace (a bachelor's degree in\nsome countries, for instance), the product takes on more of\nthe features of mass-produced consumer goods. Here there\nare more pressures to drive the price down. In education\nterms, the emphasis switches to the importance of the grade\nthat is obtained, because the mere possession of a degree has\na reduced value. The pressure here is often to reduce the\namount of sacrifice involved in getting a good grade.\nPressman (2007) would identify this as demand-pull infla-\ntion, where too many students are chasing too few jobs.\nIt is clearly much easier to prevent grade inflation that has\nnot historically taken place than it is to reduce grades that\nhave become inflated. Once the proportion of A grades has\nrisen above 40%, it is difficult to get the genie back in the\nbottle. However, the business case for doing so is suggested\nby the results of this research. There is a market for high-\nvalue degrees, the acquisition of which involves a significant\namount of suffering on the part of the student. Indeed, it is\npossible to argue for the necessity of suffering. The student\nwho has suffered is likely to believe that he or she has\nobtained a prize of great value.\nWhere degree programs require a high level of student\nparticipation, such as in the numerous assessed asynchro-\nnous online discussions favored by Liverpool, a campaign\nagainst grade inflation might also be a good way of getting\nstudents to work harder and participate to the desired extent.\nBabcock (2009), in surveying a large number of students at\nthe University of California, San Diego, concluded that\nholding fixed instructor and course, classes in which students\nexpect higher grades are found to be classes in which students\nstudy significantly less. Results indicate that average study time\nwould be about 50% lower in a class in which the average\nexpected grade was an \"A\" than in the same course taught by the\nsame instructor in which students expected a \"C.\" (p. 983)\nAlthough the University of Liverpool degrees are deliv-\nered in conjunction with an American private sector organi-\nzation, Laureate Online Education, the authors have noted no\npressures for grade inflation from their paymasters in their\nday to day teaching. There is therefore little cost-push pres-\nsure for grade inflation where teachers are encouraged to\ngive higher grades by their institution (Pressman, 2007).\nWhy? Because it would be bad for business.\nThe pressure is likely to be in the opposite direction, par-\nticularly in the case of Americans and other instructors who\nmight be operating in on-campus courses characterized by\nrampant grade inflation. When they become online teachers\nat Liverpool, they have to adjust quickly to their new\nenvironment.\nOn the demand side of the equation, Liverpool students\nmay wish that the assignment they are currently completing\nwere not so time-consuming. In the passing moment, they\nmay wish for an easier life. However, in the longer term, they\nvalue the suffering they have had to undergo. This may not\nbe universally true, but it would be surprising if there were\nnot general lessons to be learned here. The sacrifice is transi-\ntory, but positive recommendations persist over the long\nterm.\nLedden and Kalafatis (2010) highlight the fact that\ndegrees can have a different perceived value at different\ntimes. Therefore, when we ask students about perceived\nvalue might be important. Asking students during a\ntemporary period of suffering might give a distorted view of\nthe long-term benefits of such experiences to students who\nwill, in graduating, gain a prize of great value.\nConclusion\nPricing theory suggests that the price of a product can be too\nlow as well as too high. That price can include non-financial\ncontributions the buyer has to make in acquiring the product.\nIt can, for instance, include the sacrifices the student makes\nin acquiring a degree. The greater the sacrifice, the greater\nthe perceived value of the product can be.\nIt therefore does not follow from this body of theory that\nthere are inexorable pressures to reduce student sacrifices by\nmaking degrees easier to obtain. There are theoretical\ngrounds for believing that, at least in certain circumstances,\na high level of sacrifice will increase the perceived value of\na degree. This suggests that there are some situations where\nthe ethical demand of teachers to maintain academic stan-\ndards could be quite compatible with the business goals of a\nuniversity in maintaining the value of the product it sells.\nTo test the applicability of this body of theory to the online\ndegree programs of a prominent British university, the\nauthors conducted a survey among students coming toward\nthe end of their master's degrees and asked what their reac-\ntion would be if certain changes were introduced that would\nmake their degrees easier to obtain. These changes included\na reduction in failure rates, a reduction in drop-out rates, and\na reduction in the sacrifices made in obtaining the degree in\nquestion.\nA lower percentage of failures and fewer sacrifices were\nclearly seen as reducing the value of the degree. Lower drop-\nout rates did, on balance, suggest the same conclusion, but\nwith some ambiguity. The results showed that failure and\ndrop-out rates would need to reach very high levels before\nstudents would stop recommending their degree to others.\nThe conclusion was that positioning a degree successfully\nas a high-value, high-cost product that is difficult to obtain\nwould produce a situation where the business interests of a\nuniversity would lie in combatting grade inflation. The busi-\nness and academic interests of the university in maintaining\nstandards would tend to coincide.\nAppendix\nList of Survey Questions\nQuestion number Wording of question Labels on Semantic Differential Scale\nQ1 Compared with the sacrifices you expected to make to get your\ndegree, the actual sacrifices have been . . .\nMuch Greater\u00adMuch Less\nQ2 If your degree involved very little sacrifice on your part, how\nwould that affect the value of the degree in your eyes?
