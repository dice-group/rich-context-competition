Those who apply these\nmethods may also aspire to use them to augment the\navailable arsenal of research methods, offer surrogates\nfor existing research designs, and re-orient research\n(Edwards et al., 2013). Moreover, we can critically\nexamine the direct and indirect societal and political\neffects and conditions of the institutionalization of\nBig Data methods (Law and Ruppert, 2013).\nThe primary objective of this article is to elaborate\nconclusions on how Big Data methods, not only by\nmeans of their `social life' (Law and Ruppert, 2013)\nbut also their `political life' (a notion that will be\nexplained in the next section), influence the institution-\nalization of social research with special reference to pol-\nitical research. To support its pursuit of its primary\nobjective, the article also pursues a secondary objective,\ncomprised of the re-examination of a study of budget-\nary legislation in 13 countries carried out by means of\nBig Data methods. The purpose of this re-examination\nis to elaborate conclusions on the augmentation of the\narsenal of research methods, the surrogation of existing\nresearch designs, and the re-orientation of research.\nThe following two sections elaborate the theoretical\nrationale of this article and reproduce the research\nhypotheses of the study that the article re-examines.\nThe subsequent section and Appendix 1 introduce the\nBig Data methods and the research material of the re-\nexamined study. Utilizing the re-examined study as a\ncontext, this article examines in its next two sections\ntwo methods of Big Data analysis, comprising a\nmethod of unsupervised latent trait scaling and a\nmethod of topic modeling.

Making its pick from among this multitude, the\narticle follows authors starting from Berger and\nLuckmann but principally comprising John W Meyer\nand his colleagues and followers (see Powell and\nstood institutionalization to take place by means of\nhabituation and resulting taken-for-grantedness (p. 72):\n`Institutionalization occurs whenever there is reciprocal\ntypification of habitualized actions by types of actors.\nPut differently, any such typification is an institution.'\nThis article shares the assumption that not only\nhuman beings but also artifacts and therefore also Big\nData methods and Big Data itself play active roles in\nresearch and other institutionalized action (generally\nsee, for instance, Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2014;\nattention to institutionalization related to Big Data\nmethods in an analogous although not identical way\nto Law and Ruppert (2013), who elaborate the\nexamination of the `social life' of methods by means\nof characterizing what they call the relevant `patterned\nteleological arrangements'. Moreover, this article\nagrees with boyd and Crawford (2012) that mytholo-\ngies of institutionalization in Big Data contexts need\nstudy, and therefore pays attention to the examination\nof `rationalized myths' of Big Data, which rather than\nfulfilling common explicit promises to contribute to\nrationality support institutional legitimation (Meyer\nThis article not only seeks to examine the habitually\ninstitutionalized social life of Big Data methods but\nalso the `political life' of disruptions and radical trans-\nformations related to these methods. The article shares\nthe `art of dealing with the contingent event,. . . with\npure, uncontrolled, and unlegitimated contingency',\nand also fixes its attention to the role of performativity\n(Austin, 1975) that catalyzes the disruptions and trans-\nformations indicated. We find analogous arguments on\nperformativity in political theory (Skinner, 2009), sci-\nLatour, 2005), and organization research (D'Adderio,\n2009). The authors indicated locate disruptive, radical\ninstitutional change in situations in which contentious\nactors, finding that unprecedented opportunities have\nopened up, mobilize performatives by means of which\nthese actors may successfully de-legitimate the incum-\nbent actors and those performatives that have helped\nentitle the latter actors to their positions.\nThe rationale of this article also pushes it to exam-\nine chances to augment the arsenal of existing meth-\nods, offer surrogates for known research designs, and\nmore generally re-orient research (see Edwards et al.,\n2013). A common motivation to use Big Data meth-\nods is to try to reap economies of scale in managing\nlarge datasets, data dredging, and implementing\nresearch designs. Moreover, Big Data methods may\nlead researchers to transcend boundaries between\nresearch fields and re-orient research in other ways\nThe hypotheses proposed in the study\nthat this article re-examines\nBig Data methods can be used either in exploratory\nanalysis (O'Neil and Schutt, 2013) or explanatory\nresearch, the latter being the case in the study that\nthis article re-examines. The empirical subject matter of\nthe study indicated comprised a ubiquitous trite prac-\ntice, namely government budgeting. However, the\nobjectives of the study that this article re-examines\nhad pushed it away from entrenched research on\nbudgetary governance (de Haan et al., 2013;\nHallerberg et al., 2007) or adaptations of generic\nresearch on public sector reform adapted to examine\ngovernment budgeting (see, for instance, Hyndman\net al., 2013). Instead, the study indicated examined his-\ntorical legal traditions as possible influences on govern-\nment budgeting.\nThe study that this article re-examines started with\nobservations that despite indications that legal trad-\nitions are dead (Lindahl and Schadewitz, 2013;\nPargendler, 2012), research acknowledging these trad-\nMoreover, heterogeneity between national systems of\ngovernment budgeting despite decades of global har-\nmonization called for explanation (International\nindicated study proposed hypotheses that legal system\ntraditions indeed explain differences in government\nbudgetary legislation according to entrenched histor-\nical, social, cultural, and political divisions in\ncommon law with British origins, Napoleonic civil\nlaw first codified in France, civil law of the German\ntype, and Nordic law resembling German law in\nmany respects (Glenn, 2010; Zweigert and Ko\n\u00a8 tz,\n1998). The study that this article re-examines\napproached differences between the legal systems\ntaking the less common inroad of examining differences\nin legal language (Brake and Katzenstein, 2013;\nThe first three hypotheses proposed in the study\nthat this article re-examines were tested by means of a\n2 Big Data & Society\nBig Data method of unsupervised latent trait scaling.\nThe first two of these three hypotheses were:\nHypothesis 1: A grand division into common law legal\nsystems and civil law legal systems explains differences\nin government budgetary legislation.\nHypothesis 2: Within countries of civil law traditions,\nfiner divisions into Napoleonic, German and Nordic\nlegal systems explain differences in government budget-\nary legislation.\nThe longer-term harmonization efforts of government\nbudgeting indicate countries with common law trad-\nitions as the foremost present-day global ideal models\nwas proposed:\nHypothesis 3: The older the budgetary legislation is in a\ncivil law country, the wider its differences from budget-\nary legislation in common law countries.\nThe last two hypotheses of the study that this article re-\nexamines were tested by means of a Big Data method of\ntopic modeling. These hypotheses were:\nHypothesis 4: Divisions into legal system traditions\nexplain divisions into topics in government budgetary\nlegislation.\nHypothesis 5: Divisions within government budgetary\nlegislation according to different topics explain differ-\nences in the vocabularies of these topics in the legisla-\ntion indicated.\nResearch methods and the research\nmaterial in the study that this article\nre-examines\nMethods\nThe foremost methods of the study that this article re-\nexamines comprised a method of unsupervised latent\ntrait scaling and a method of topic modeling.\nA brief background characterization follows, and\nAppendix 1 gives more details.\nLatent trait scaling first appeared in social research\nof the political science variety in the shape of supervised\nlatent scaling (Laver et al., 2002), which requires the\nresearcher first to feed a `seed text' and next utilize\nmachine learning algorithms to do the scaling. Later,\nunsupervised scaling evolved (Proksch and Slapin,\n2008), using machine learning algorithms throughout\nthe research process. First and foremost, both two scal-\ning methods have been applied to examine ideological\npolarization in politics by means of using such Big Data\ntextual materials as parliamentary speeches, political\nstatements of government ministers, or political party\nTopic modeling found its way into social research at\nabout the same time as unsupervised latent trait scaling\nevolved within the political science variety of this research\n(Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). Rather than within polit-\nical science research (Clark and Lauderdale, 2010), this\nmethod has found applications in sociological research\n(see, for instance, DiMaggio et al., 2013; Fligstein et al.,\nResearch material\nThe research material in the study that this article\nre-examines comprised legislation on federal or\nnational government budgeting in the stable and\nhighly developed Western democracies of Australia,\nAustria, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland,\nItaly, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Spain,\nand the United Kingdom (Table 1). It would have been\nboth relevant and interesting to examine the United\nStates, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, but these\ncountries were omitted because of their complex federal\nstructures. The corpus examined had 13 documents\nMost of the materials were derived from a World\nBank (2013) website with legal texts in English or\nEnglish translation. Two texts derived were from gov-\nernmental websites, in English translation (Austria,\nwas translated into English. Applying a common and\nallowable practice of Big Data research for the UK and\nFinland, two separate legal documents were merged\ninto a single text.\nExamining augmentation, surrogation,\nand re-orientation in research by means\nof Big Data methods\nExamining unsupervised latent trait scaling\nThe method of unsupervised latent trait scaling used in\nthe study that this article re-examines (for technical\ndetails see Appendix 1) enables delivering estimating\nand testing results on what the developers of this\nmethod have named the fixed effects related to individ-\nual words (, theta), the fixed effects related to each\ndifferent document included in the data (, alpha), the\nword weights (, beta), and the positions taken in the\ndocuments (!, omega). The notion of `fixed effect' is\ngeneric to many varieties of quantitative analysis, indi-\ncating that a variable is treated for the technical pur-\nposes of quantitative analysis as if it were non-random.\nAll that is specific to estimating fixed effects by means\nof latent trait scaling derives from the character of this\nmethod as a Big Data method of textual analysis. The\nresults obtained by means of using this method are typ-\nically uninteresting as concerns the fixed effects, the cal-\nculation of which therefore plays only a subordinate\ntechnical role to enable the calculation of the word\nweights and the positions taken in the documents.\nMoreover, the calculation of the fixed effects may essen-\ntially enhance the possibilities graphically to display the\nestimation of the word weights, the positions taken in\nthe documents, or both the weights and the positions.\nWords best discriminating between the documents\nexamined and therefore between the countries from\nwhich these documents derive situated themselves at\nthe extreme ends of  values, as is generally expected\nin applications of the unsupervised latent trait scaling\nmethod. This pinpoints an asset of this method: it\nemphasizes rare as opposed to frequent words discrimi-\nnating between text documents. This very characteristic\nalso eliminates the confounding effects of the different\nlengths of the texts examined. However, the assets of\nthe unsupervised latent trait scaling examined must be\nweighed against its less outstanding characteristics,\nwhich included a graphical output plot with no fewer\nthan 2992 different words according to their weights\n(), or far too many either to present meaningfully or\nto make subject to a sensible substantive interpretation.\nIn their turn, the  (alpha) fixed effects, related to docu-\nments and the countries behind these documents, are of\nno interest for the model interpretation, but the dimen-\nsion they represent usefully takes visually apart the pos-\nitions taken in the documents, or the important !\n(omega) values (Figure 1).\nAs proposed in Hypothesis 1 of the study that this\narticle re-examines, a grand division indeed prevails\nbetween countries with common law traditions and\ncountries with civil law traditions. Hypothesis 2 could\nalso be sustained, although the countries examined do\nnot arrange themselves quite neatly into the\nNapoleonic, German, and Nordic variants of civil\nlaw. Certain countries sharing legal system traditions\nreceived resembling ! (omega) values, such as Spain\nand Italy, or Sweden and Finland, but there were\nexceptions such as Iceland more resembling Spain and\nItaly than the two other Nordic countries of Sweden\nand Finland. Moreover, Austria, one of the two repre-\nsentatives of the German tradition in the analysis,\nreceived a resembling ! (omega) value with Sweden\nand Finland. The Netherlands, with its Roman\u00ad\nNapoleonic\u00adGerman legal characteristics (Glenn,\n2010), comprised a unique case as could be expected.\nThe fact that budgetary legislation was old at the time\nof the investigation both in Estonia and Iceland sug-\ngested the acceptance of Hypothesis 3 on differences\nbetween civil law countries with older as opposed to\nmore recently reformed budgetary legislation.\nIn the study that this article re-examines, statistical\ncredibility intervals were calculated for the ! (omega)\nTable 1.

Australia and New Zealand did not\ndiffer statistically from each other, nor did Austria,\nFinland and Iceland, or Estonia and Spain. The other\ncountries, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands,\nSweden, and the United Kingdom, were empirically\nmore unique.\nExamining topic modeling\nThe topic modeling program library used in the study\nthat this article re-examines would have set no technical\nlimits to estimating high numbers of topics, but\nHypotheses 4 and 5 and their background argumenta-\ntion indicated a maximum of four topics that could\nbe given a substantive interpretation. However, a\nGerman topic and a Nordic topic did not evolve separ-\nately in the four-topic estimation, although this is\nunderstandable given the closeness of the two civil\nlaw varieties. Only a three-topic solution is presented\n(Table 3).\nThe topic modeling results (Table 3) allowed\nHypothesis 4 to be sustained, revealing three topics: a\njoint topic of `German and Nordic law', a topic of\n`common law', and a topic of `Napoleonic law'. As is\ncommonplace in topic modeling, many words appear in\ntwo or all three topics. However, some of these words\nonly illustrate that the corpus comprised legal texts (for\ninstance, `law', `must', `shall', and `may'), or indicated\nreferences and cross-references common in legal texts\n(for instance, `section', `article', or `paragraph').\nLooking at words of substance that characterize cer-\ntain topics rather than others, Hypothesis 5 on differ-\nences between the legal vocabularies of different legal\nsystems could be sustained (Table 3). Words dealing\nwith the contents of budgeting can be observed in the\nfirst topic of `German and Nordic law', such as\n`budget', `finance', `financial', `expenditure' (both in\nthe singular and the plural), `cash', `assets', and `provi-\nsions'. In the `common law', topic words were found to\nomega\nalpha\nFrance\nIceland\nSweden\nAustralia\nAustria\nCanada\nEstonia\nFinland\nItaly\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nSpain\nUK\nFigure 1.

Finally, words\ncharacterizing accountability received emphasis on the\nthird, `Napoleonic' topic: `accounts', `accounting',\n`report', and `auditing'. Unfortunately, the relation-\nships between different regimes of budgetary govern-\nance and different textual frames of budgetary\nlegislation were too under-researched to receive an\nelaboration proper in the study that this article re-\nexamines, and have to await future study.\nIn the study that this article re-examines, the distri-\nbution of the three topics in the documents examined\nand, respectively, in the countries that these documents\nrepresent gave further support to Hypothesis 5\n(Table 4). In the Austrian document, only the\nGerman-Nordic topic was present. This was almost\nthe case in the Swedish and Finnish documents,\nwhereas the weight of this same topic in the Icelandic\ndocument was about two-thirds. In Estonia, despite its\npredominantly German legal heritage (Glenn, 2010),\nmore than two-thirds of the vocabulary examined rep-\nresented the `Napoleonic law' topic. Only future studies\ncan examine the reasons for this aberration.\nThe countries in which only the second, `com-\nmon law' topic was present comprised Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Australia, and this topic also\npredominated in the United Kingdom with a weight\nover half of the total. According to the estimation\nresults, in Spain and Italy only the third, `Napoleonic\nlaw' topic was present. France, in its turn, represented\nitself rather as a hybrid between the Napoleonic topic\nand the German-Nordic topic, possibly reflecting the\nhistorical influence of German legal traditions in\nnorthern France and the characteristics of the Code\nTable 2.

In Estonia, France, and Iceland a domin-\nant topic and a minor topic could be found, and in the\nUnited Kingdom and the Netherlands the study that\nthis article re-examines revealed a dominant topic and\ntwo minor topics.\nBaseline comparisons concerning the Big Data\nmethods that this article examines\nBaseline comparisons have been carried out before\nbetween traditional methods and the unsupervised scal-\ning method that the study that this article re-examines\nutilized (see, for instance, Gru\nLowe and Benoit, 2013). The performative struggles\nbetween researchers using traditional methods (see,\nhand, and researchers using Big Data methods\nand Slapin, 2008) on the other, also offer lessons for\nbaseline comparisons.\nThe baseline comparisons in this article receive\nsupport from long-time researcher familiarity with\nboth quantitative research and semiotic and rhetorical\ntextual analysis. During the preparation of an\ninternational refereed article that went into press in\n2014, extending a three-country study (Hyndman\net al., 2013) to cover a fourth country, the laborious\nmaterial collection, the tedious and error-prone manual\ncoding and dissatisfaction with the analysis of word\nfrequencies made methods of Big Data analysis attract-\nive (for the methods actually chosen, see Appendix 1).\nGiven this modest baseline, the study that this article\nexamines, once completed, represented a substantial\nimprovement.\nWhile preparing the study indicated above, the path\nled to the best-evolved Big Data methods to examine\nideological polarization, comprised of methods of\nlatent trait scaling. An additional interest to learn\nwhat unsupervised rather than supervised scaling\nwould deliver made the Wordfish program (Proksch\nand Slapin, 2009) the choice. The study that this article\nre-examines was driven towards topic modeling by two\nadditional forces. The former of these comprised\nresearcher familiarity with the classical rhetorical exam-\nination of (Aristotle, 2006) and the resulting curiosity\nto learn about the performance of a Big Data method\nthat steps forward as an inheritor of the classical trad-\nition. The latter driving force was a technical interest in\nusing two methods of Big Data analysis as baselines in\nrespect to each other in examining the same research\nmaterial.\nConclusions and discussion\nAugmentation, surrogation, and re-orientation\nof research\nFrom among the two types of Big Data methods that\nthis article has examined, latent trait scaling has\nevolved with the explicit purpose of augmenting\n(Edwards et al., 2013) earlier methods. The authors of\nboth supervised latent trait scaling (Laver et al., 2002)\nand unsupervised latent scaling (Proksch and Slapin,\n2008) have been critical towards the conventional\nmethods applied in a minor international research pro-\nject started in the mid-1980s to examine political pref-\ncountries (MARPOR 2015). Although sensitizing\nMARPOR representatives towards vulnerability in\ntheir methods, the altercations have ended in\nparative examinations of the merits of the traditional\nand Big Data methods (see, for instance, Lowe and\nBenoit, 2013) have failed to resolve the fundamental\ndisputes.\nBig Data methods of topic modeling originate from\nwithin hybrids of computer science and statistics rather\nthan from within social research. Topic modeling expli-\ncitly augments traditional latent variable modeling\nTable 4.

However, researchers with classical\nhumanist inclinations may want to critically consider\nhow much topic modeling actually augments the\n2500-year rhetorical tradition of examining topics or\nother procedures of classical humanist textual interpret-\nation (see, for instance, Biernacki, 2014).\nThe results of this article suggest agreement with\nEdwards et al. (2013) that Big Data methods may not\neasily provide surrogates for conventional research\ndesigns of social research despite the fact that such\nadvances are not ruled out (see, for instance, Hale\nstudy that this article has re-examined, the research\ndesign was cross-sectional and comparative by modest\ndefault rather than by explicit design. A possible future\nstep forward would lead to longitudinal Big Data\nresearch of texts of budgetary legislation in a number\nof countries (for analogous examples of longitudinal\nBig Data analysis, see, for instance, DiMaggio et al.,\nEdwards et al. (2013) indicate that the re-orientation\nof research by means of Big Data methods may start\nfrom where their mere augmentation of conventional\nmethods stops. The empirical results on government\nbudgetary legislation in the study that this article has\nre-examined suggest that latent trait scaling has poten-\ntial in empirical research over and above the study of\nthe ideological dimensions of politics (Laver et al.,\n2008). More specifically, in the study indicated, a spe-\ncific method of unsupervised latent trait scaling was\nused to discern latent traits of legal traditions in gov-\nernment budgetary legislation in 13 countries by means\nof examining the texts of this legislation. Big Data\nresearch has been evolving within legal research\nproper (see, for instance, Hildebrandt, 2012; Surden,\n2014), but the study that this article has examined indi-\ncates re-orientation within political science research on\ngovernment budgeting and legal policy-making rather\nthan legal studies.\nThe foremost contribution of the topic modeling\napplication in the study that this article has re-\nexamined was confined to social research of the polit-\nical science variety. This is possibly a contribution in\nitself, as topic modeling has been applied within politi-\ncal science research comparatively rarely thus far (but,\nsee, for instance, Clark and Lauderdale, 2010), whereas\nit has been substantially more common within socio-\nlogical research (DiMaggio et al., 2013; Fligstein et al.,\nThe social and political life of Big Data methods\ninfluencing the institutionalization of research\nAs indicated at the beginning, as its foremost objective\nthis article examines the `social life' and the `political\nlife' of Big Data methods as influences on the institu-\ntionalization of research. The social structures, the\norganization and the identity of Big Data research,\nand its researchers within the social and political sci-\nences were still weak rather than entrenched in most\ncountries and most research fields in the mid-2010s.\nAt the same time, mainstreaming of Big Data methods\nwas still advancing within statistics proper rather than\nhaving been fully accomplished (see, for instance,\nEMC, 2015). Genuine innovations in social and\npolitical research concerning Big Data methods have\nbeen relatively few thus far although not nonexistent\n(see, however, Grimmer and Stewart, 2013; Laver\nBig Data activism of distinguished social and political\nscientists (see, for instance, DiMaggio et al., 2013;\nging the situation.\nAccording to one scenario, social and\npolitical research utilizing Big Data methods will insti-\ntutionalize itself, that is, it will become habitual and\ntaken-for-granted in social and political research.\nHowever, should this institutionalization take place, it\nwould also generate its `rationalized myths' (Meyer and\nRowan, 1977) with the exaggeration of the merits and\ncontributions of these methods and formal rather than\nsubstantive commitment to them. We would also\nwitness not only the enhancement of the rationality of\nthe core analytic processes of research by means\nof the Big Data methods, but also the strengthening\nof the external legitimation of institutions of research\nby the same means.\nFor a social researcher in political science, particu-\nlarly interesting characteristics of the political life of the\nBig Data methods include the performative roles that\nthese methods and their applications may play in\ndisrupting the achieved institutionalization of research\nand, possibly, in catalyzing institutional transform-\nations. This article has indicated two specific\nperformative struggles. The first one of these struggles\nhas revolved around a long-term international project\nexamining ideological political polarization\n(MARPOR, 2015), and has been waged between\nthose who defend traditional methods (Budge, 2013;\nVolkens et al., 2013) on the one hand, and those who\napply Big Data methods (Laver et al., 2002; Proksch\nand Slapin, 2008) on the other. As indicated above,\nproposals of appeasement (Lowe and Benoit, 2013)\nhave reaped little success so far. The other performative\nstruggle, which to this date has been milder, has been\n8 Big Data & Society\nwaged between those who apply Big Data methods\nincluding topic modeling (DiMaggio et al., 2013;\nFligstein et al., 2014) on the one hand, and those who\nprioritize methods derived from classical humanistic\ntraditions (Biernacki, 2014) on the other.\nIn the mid-2010s, time has generally been working to\nthe advantage of those social and political researchers\nwho apply or promote Big Data methods, as observa-\ntions accumulate that in many countries public sector\nand private sector funding authorities have placed\nheavy emphasis upon Big Data research projects.\nExhibiting a `vivid awareness of the relationship\nbetween personal experience and the wider society'\nbetter known as `sociological imagination' (Mills,\nkeenly acute not only for numerous global colleagues\nbut also for the research team from among whose prod-\nucts this article is one.

Next, the corpus com-\nprised of these texts was pruned by means of a text\nmining program library included in the R system of\nprogram libraries (Feinerer, 2013), such as eliminating\nnumbers, punctuation marks, stopwords, and all words\npresent in only one or two of the 13 texts of the corpus,\nUnsupervised latent trait scaling. The unsupervised latent\ntrait scaling applied a version of the Wordfish program\nincluded in the R library system (Lowe, 2011; Proksch\nand Slapin, 2009). Wordfish supports the examination\nof word frequencies in texts on the assumption that the\nnumber of times that a word, j, is present in a document\nderives from a Poisson distribution. The general form\nof the Wordfish model is:\nyij $ Poisson\u00f0ij\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nij\n\u00bc exp i\n\u00fe j\n\u00fe j\nx !i\nIn equation (1), yij\nis the count of word j in docu-\nment i, and in equation (2),  is the set of fixed effects\nrelated to a document, is the set of fixed effects\nrelated to words,  is the set of estimates of word-spe-\ncific weights to capture the importance of each indivi-\ndual word in discriminating between positions that the\ntexts represent, and ! is the set of estimates for the\nposition that each document represents (for explana-\ntions of these notions see the text proper of this article).\nIn the Wordfish method of unsupervised latent trait\nscaling, the estimation and testing of the fixed effects,\n and j,\ntechnically control for the common possibility\nthat different documents may include some words\nrather than others, and that some documents have\nmore words than others. Moreover, the estimation\nresults of the fixed effects are instrumental in visually\ndisplaying the results of Wordfish unsupervised latent\ntrait scaling (see the text proper of this article and, for\nan example, see Figure 1). Unsupervised latent trait\nscaling first and foremost estimates the s, indicating\nthe words that differentiate between the positions taken\nin the documents examined, and the !s, indicating the\npositions of each document derived from the positions\nthat its constituent words express.\nThe right-hand side of equation (2) is estimated by\nmeans of an expectation maximization algorithm to\ncompute maximum likelihood estimates for the latent\nvariables (Proksch and Slapin, 2009). First, starting\nvalues for , , , and ! are obtained. Second, the\ndocument parameters ! and  are estimated condi-\ntional on the expectation for the word parameters\nand  by maximizing a log-likelihood function for\neach of the documents examined. Third, the word para-\nmeters and  are estimated conditional on the expec-\ntation of the document parameters ! and , obtained in\nstep 2. For each word, a log-likelihood function is max-\nimized. Fourth, the log-likelihood of the model is cal-\nculated as the sum of the individual word\nlog-likelihoods obtained in step 3. Fifth, steps 2\u00ad4 are\nrepeated until the model converges. Last, credibility\nintervals are calculated for the scaling estimates of the\ns and !s by means of a parametric bootstrap with a\nWordfish default of 500 iterations. As is commonplace\nwith Big Data methods, the Wordfish latent trait scal-\ning method in some respects utilizes analogous elements\nas older statistical methods on the one hand, but adds\ncertain new elements and procedures on the other let\nalone represents a novel combination of its constituent\nelements (more generally, see EMC, 2015).\nTopic modeling. `Topics', first evolved in classical rhetoric\n(Aristotle, 2006), comprise devices that language users\ninvent or innovatively transfer from other uses to those\nof their own to influence the cognitions, emotions, and\nperceptions of their audience, including their opponents\nmethods of topic modeling support the detection and\ninterpretation of topics in texts. The study that this\narticle re-examines applied program scripts of probabil-\nistic topic modeling called `latent Dirichlet allocation'\nApplications of LDA discern latent topics that sup-\nport the persuasive capacity of texts by means of inclu-\nsions and emphases and exclusions and omissions in\nthese texts. LDA builds on the understanding that the\ndocuments examined comprise mixtures of topics that\nregulate the probability that different words find their\nway into these documents. The topics and their prob-\nability distributions in documents are understood to\ncomprise hidden random variables, which are built into\na hierarchical probabilistic model, and estimated by\nmeans of approximating the conditional distribution\nof these variables in the documents. In the topic mod-\neling program library used in the study that this article\nre-examines (Gru\nmeans of Gibbs sampling and constructing a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm (Blei, 2012). These char-\nacteristics comprise another example on how Big Data\nmethods combine elements of known earlier methods\nThe examination advanced as follows in the study\nthat this article re-examines. First, the probability dis-\ntribution of words, , was determined for each topic,\nassuming a Dirichlet probability distribution, :\n $ Dirichlet \nSecond, the topic distribution, , was determined for\neach document w, also assuming a Dirichlet distribu-\ntion, :\n $ Dirichlet \nThird, for wi\n, or each of the N words, each topic, zi\n,\nwas chosen on the assumption of the multinomial dis-\ntribution of this topic:\nzi $ Multinomial \nFourth, wi\n, each of the N words, was chosen on the\nassumption of a multinomial prior distribution of these\nwords, each of which is conditioned on the topic, zi\n:\nzi\n: p\u00f0wijzi\nAfter the four steps, the log-likelihood of the\nresearch material, calculated as the sum over the log-\nlikelihoods of all documents included, was maximized\nwith respect to the model parameters  and .\nHowever, no mathematical criteria are available to\ndecide how many topics, k, the researcher should dis-\ntinguish, but he or she has to decide the number of\ntopics based on the study objectives, the background\ntheory, and the hypotheses proposed. In the study that\nthis article re-examines, the model was fitted using the\nfunction LDA included in the program library utilized\nin the analysis. The fitting required assigning an initial\nvalue to the Dirichlet prior , defining the number of\niterations to reach as stable estimates as possible, and\nintroducing a random `seed word' with which to start\nthe estimation to ensure the reproducibility of the\nresults (Gru\n\u00a8 n and Hornik, 2013). Last, a topic model\nfunction called `posterior' was used to obtain the dis-\ntribution of words on each topic and the distribution of\ntopics in each document.\n12 Big Data & Society"
