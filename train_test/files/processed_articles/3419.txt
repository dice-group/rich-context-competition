    "abstract": "Abstract\nA large number of studies have assessed human mate preferences using lists of characteristics. To date, there is little data\nregarding mate preferences in Iran. The present study aimed to investigate dimensions in mate preferences among Iranian women\nand to validate a female-specific instrument in Iranian context. Three studies were designed and conducted. The first study was an\ninterview-based qualitative analysis of women's mate preferences. The second study provided a psychometrically sound list of 26\ncharacteristics in a potential mate. The third study confirmed the five-factor structure of the instrument. In sum, five dimensions\nof mate preferences among Iranian women are kindness/dependability, status/resources, attractiveness/sexuality, religiosity/\nchastity, and education/intelligence, as measured by the newly developed 26-item scale.\n",

There are several differences in long- and short-\nterm relationships (Li & Kenrick, 2006) as well as gender dif-\nferences. Buss (1985) noted two major gender differences\nregarding mate preferences, indicating that women are more\nconcerned with a potential partner's earning ability while men\nare more interested in physical characteristics, such as potential\npartner's attractiveness and cues for fertility. Therefore, it is\ncrucial to consider gender differences in examining human mate\npreferences (Buss, 1989), which have been confirmed across\ndifferent cultures and methodologies (Buss et al., 1990; Buss,\nShackelford, Kirkpatrick, & Larsen, 2001; Li, Valentine, &\nMoreover, there are a number of female-specific variables that\ncan alter mate preferences (cf., Frederick, Reynolds, & Fisher,\n2013). For example, it has been shown that mate preferences\nmay vary according to menstrual cycle (Gangestad, Garver-\nThere are also some similarities between genders regarding mate\npreferences. For instance, both women and men value charac-\nteristics such as ``good disposition,'' ``emotional stability,'' and\n``kind and understanding'' (Buss, 1989).\nMate preferences among females vary by culture (Buss,\n1989). Yet, a number of studies have suggested the most impor-\ntant factors in a potential mate for a female. Furnham (2009)\nasked young people to rate 14 desirable factors under five\nbroader categories (ability, personality, physical, social, and\nvalues). Females rated intelligence, stability, conscientious-\nness, height, education, social skills, political compatibility,\nand religious similarity significantly higher than males. A\nstudy in India also suggested that characteristics such as\nhealthy, kind and understanding, intelligent, and good earning\ncapacity were among the most important factors in choosing a\nmate (Kamble, Shackelford, Pham, & Buss, 2014). Moreover,\nthe role of height has attracted a great deal of attention from\nresearchers (Frederick & Jenkins, 2015; Mueller & Mazur,\n1 Department of Psychology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran\n2 Department of Psychology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad\nUniversity, Tehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammad Atari, Department of Psychology, University of Tehran, Tehran,\nIran.\nEmails: mohammad.attari@yahoo.com; atari@ut.ac.ir\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nstudies have also highlighted the role of age, social class,\nethnicity (Furnham & McClelland, 2015), and intelligence\n(Prokosch, Coss, Scheib, & Blozis, 2009) in females' mate\npreferences.\nMost of the existing literature on human mate preferences\nrelies on questionnaire-based surveys of participants who value\na certain characteristic to a certain extent. The number and\nquality of characteristics vary across different studies (Shack-\nelford et al., 2005). The most widely used mate preference\nlisting includes 18 characteristics, first used in 1930s by Hill\n(1945). Over the past seven decades, this list has been used in\nmany seminal studies (e.g., Buss, 1989). Other studies have\nalso used different lists of mate preferences with different num-\nA considerable number of studies that aimed to identify\nthe dimensions of mate preferences are methodologically\ndifferent regarding the content of items, number of items,\nsize of samples, and demographic details of samples. Yet, a\nnumber of dimensions have uniformly been identified in the\nliterature. For example, dimensions of ``social status and\nfinancial resources'' (e.g., Buss & Barnes, 1986; Fletcher,\nSimpson, Thomas, & Giles, 1999; Furnham & McClelland,\nCate, 2000), ``kindness and warmth'' (e.g., Buss & Barnes,\net al., 2000), ``attractiveness and health'' (e.g., Fletcher et al.,\nelford et al., 2005) have been previously identified.\nA number of studies have used factor analytic techniques to\nidentify the underlying dimensions of mate preferences. Good-\nwin and Tang (1991) subjected 15 characteristics to a factor\nanalysis and found three dimensions, that is, kindness/consid-\neration, extroversion, and sensitivity. Another factor analysis\non ratings of 15 characteristics identified two dimensions of\nmate preference, that is, personal/parenting qualities and attrac-\ntiveness/social visibility (Simpson & Gangestad, 1992).\ncharacteristics to factor analyses and reported three major\ndimensions (warmth-trustworthiness, vitality-attractiveness,\nand status-resources). Furthermore, Buss and Barnes (1986)\nfound nine dimensions of mate preference (kind-considerate,\nsocially exciting, artistic-intelligent, religious, domestic, pro-\nfessional status, likes children, politically conservative, and\neasygoing-adaptable). More recently, a factor analytic study\nreported 12 dimensions of mate selection preferences (kind and\nunderstanding, dominant, pleasant, intellectual, wealthy and\ngenerous, physically attractive, cultivated, humorous, sociable,\ncreative and domestic, reliable, and similar) using a list of\nShackelford (2008) reported four clusters of characteristics in a\npotential male (good gene indicators, good investment ability\nindicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner indica-\ntors) and argued that more attractive women desire all these\nindicators in potential mate.\nUsing a large archival database, Shackelford et al. (2005)\nsubmitted 18 previously mentioned characteristics to a princi-\npal components analysis and identified four cross-culturally\nuniversal dimensions (love vs. status/resources, dependable/\nstable vs. good looks/health, education/intelligence vs. desire\nfor home/children, and sociability vs. similar religion) that\nexplained 35% of the total variance. Trade-off model (Gang-\nestad & Simpson, 2000) was used to explain the grouping of\nitems into components. These authors also recommended con-\nducting within-culture analyses to identify specific dimensions\nand constituent preferences that best capture the preference\nratings for that particular culture. Of note, data from Iran were\nexcluded from this investigation due to small sample size.\nThe present research aimed to investigate dimensions of\nlong-term mate preference among Iranian females through\nthree studies. This research would be important considering the\nfollowing: (a) Iran has been excluded from large-scale cross-\ncultural studies investigating mate preferences (e.g., Schmitt,\ncal investigations is available from Iran, (c) very small sample\nsizes have been drawn from Iran in large-scale international\nstudies (e.g., Buss et al., 1990), and (d) to date, there is no\nstandardized measure for assessment of Iranian females' mate\npreferences.\nThis qualitative study aimed to prepare a preliminary list of\ncharacteristics in mate preferences among Iranian women. We\nused individualized sessions to provide a list to be subjected to\nquantitative analyses.\nMaterial and Method\nForty-seven heterosexual women aged between 19 and\nnience sampling method. Twenty-one of the participants were\nselected randomly in a premarriage consulting clinic. These\nwomen were about to get married in near future. A total of\n19 participants were recruited in university settings. Seven\nparticipants were selected in work settings from the popula-\ntion of working women. All participants were asked about\ntheir socioeconomic status on a 5-point scale ranging from\n1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Eleven women rated 5, 15\nparticipants rated 4, 14 participants rated 3, 6 participants\nrated 2, and 1 participant rated 1.\nTwo interviewers were involved: one woman and one man.\nCharacteristics of a potential long-term mate were discussed in\n10-min individualized sessions. First, an overview of long-term\nrelationship was presented by the interviewer; then, partici-\npants were asked about their preferences in choosing a long-\nterm mate. Each participant reported between 10 and\n20 desirable characteristics. Qualitative information were\ncoded and analyzed following a standard procedure (Boyatzis,\ninterviews. Meaning units are constellation of words or\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nstatements that relate to the same central meaning (e.g., ``I\ndefinitely want my future long-term partner to be honest because\nlying makes me sick''). Then, meaning units were analyzed to\nform condensed meaning unit (e.g., ``wanting an honest partner\nwho doesn't lie''). Finally, condensed meaning units were coded\nas single characteristics (e.g., ``honest and truthful'').\nResults\nA total of 205 characteristics were acquired. Fetish-like\nresponses related to specific body parts were excluded. For\nexample, one participant said: ``I wouldn't possibly think about\na guy, unless he has a six pack.'' Of course, many women are\nattracted to muscular men (Frederick & Haselton, 2007; Gray\n& Frederick, 2012), but this item represented an extreme\nanswer. Repeated characteristics (e.g., ``kind'' was present in\n42 interviews) were also excluded and a final pool of 45\ncharacteristics was formed, 37 of which were present in the\nconsidering the aforementioned literature, and domestic stud-\nies (e.g., Khoei, Ziaei, Salehi, & Farajzadegan, 2013), an item\npool of 39 characteristics (see Table 1) was prepared to be\nused in Study 2.\nTable 1. Mean, Standard Deviation, and Original Source of the 39 Characteristics in Study 2.\nNo. Item's Content Main Source M (SD)\n24 Qeiratia (protective against unwanted sexual\nattention and any possible danger)\naThis adjective was drawn from our qualitative analyses. To our knowledge, there is no precise translation of this word into English. Therefore, we decided to\npresent a definition in parentheses. In meaning, this characteristic may be considered associated with ``jealousy,'' ``honor,'' ``confrontativeness,'' ``intrasexual\nrivalry,'' and ``protectiveness''; however, neither of these translations conceptually capture the meaning of ``Qeirati'' in Persian language (This paragraph was\nreviewed and confirmed by two professionals in translation).\nAtari and Jamali 3\nThis quantitative study aimed to finalize the scale by conduct-\ning an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on previously pre-\npared items. Additionally, we secured evidence for the\nconvergent validity of the scale. The internal consistency coef-\nficients (Cronbach's a) of the subscales of the measure were\nalso examined.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nInitially, 350 participants completed the survey. Excluding par-\nticipants with 15% of missing values (n \u00bc 34) and married\nparticipants (n \u00bc 16), a total of 300 participants was used in\nthis study. We recruited convenience samples from various\nlocations (university settings, National Library of Iran, a hos-\npital, a school, a company, and a gym) and systematically\nrecruited groups of single bachelor of arts/bachelor of science\n(BA/BS) students, single master of arts/master of science\n(MA/MS) students, single doctor of philosophy/doctor of med-\nicine (PhD/MD) students, and nonstudent working women to\nensure a diverse sample of women. The sample size was suf-\nficient for factor analytic purposes (Henson & Roberts, 2006).\nThe data were gathered from Tehran, Iran. Generally, Tehran\nmay be considered the cultural and political center of Iran with\nover 14 million residents.\nAge of participants ranged between 15 and 47 with mean of\nMS/MA, 43 had PhD/MD, and 5 participants did not report\ntheir educational level. Minimum desired age for marriage was\npreferred age difference was 4.92 (SD \u00bc 2.66). In the present\nsample of women, the desired number of children was 1.86 (SD\nMeasures\nDemographics. A set of demographic questions was developed\nfor this study. Demographic details included age, educational\nbackground, ideal age difference with partner (minimum and\nmaximum), ideal age of marriage (minimum and maximum),\ndesired number of children, weight, and height. The latter two\nwere used to compute body mass index (BMI).\nItem pool. The prepared item pool of 39 characteristics was\nadministered on the sample. In this survey, participants were\nasked to rate the importance of each item on a 4-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from 1 (unimportant) to 4 (very important).\nPreferences concerning potential mates questionnaire (PPMQ). This\nranking instrument includes 13 characteristics in a potential\nmate (Buss & Barnes, 1986). Participants were requested to\nrank each characteristic from 1 to 13. The most desirable char-\nacteristic is ranked as 1 while the least desirable is ranked as 13.\nProcedure\nParticipants were administered the questionnaire in public\nplaces of universities and National Library of Iran after being\ninformed of the voluntary nature of participation. Participants\nwere not remunerated.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn order to identify the underlying dimensions of mate prefer-\nence among Iranian females, descriptive statistics for each item\nwere first computed. Then, a preliminary EFA was carried out.\nConsidering descriptive indices, items' content, and the pre-\nliminary EFA, appropriate items were subjected to a principal-\naxis EFA with varimax rotation. Parallel analysis was per-\nformed to determine the number of factors. Moreover, Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients were used. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS 22.\nResults\nThe final 39-item list of long-term mate preferences, their\nsources, and their descriptive statistics are presented in Table\n1. Item 1 (i.e., good cook and housekeeper) had the lowest mean\nand was considered the least important characteristic in choosing\na mate in the present sample. On the other hand, Item 27 (i.e.,\nloyal) was the most important characteristic in a potential mate.\nA preliminary EFA was conducted and highly cross-loading\nitems were subsequently identified. Considering the theoretical\nbackground of items' content and exclusion of psychometri-\ncally problematic items, a battery of 26 items was selected to be\nsubjected to EFA. Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) measure of\nsampling adequacy was very high (KMO \u00bc 0.858). Moreover,\np < .001. These findings suggested that the 26 items had suf-\nficient common variance to be subjected to EFA (Worthington\n& Whittaker, 2006). Six factors had eigenvalues of 1 or higher.\nYet, in order to determine the number of factors, parallel anal-\nysis was used. Parallel analysis has proved to be an accurate\nway of determining the number of factors (Patil, McPherson, &\nFriesner, 2010) compared to other methods, such as retaining\nfactors with eigenvalues greater than 1 (Guttman, 1954) or the\nallel analysis suggested extraction of five factors. Therefore, a\nprincipal axis factoring with fixed number of five factors and\nvarimax rotation was performed. These five factors explained\n5.29%, respectively). The rotated factor matrix for 26 items\nof the scale is presented in Table 2.\nAll factors had conceptually consistent items. Factors were,\nrespectively, labeled as ``kindness/dependability,'' ``status/\nresources,'' ``attractiveness/sexuality,'' ``religiosity/chastity,''\nand ``education/intelligence.'' The correlation coefficients\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nbetween the five subscales are presented in Table 3. All sub-\nscales were moderately correlated. Except for the correlation\ncoefficient between Factor 2 (status/resources) and Factor 3\n(attractiveness/sexuality), all subscales were correlated with\nan approximate effect size of 0.2 to 0.3. Moreover, all subscales\nwere internally consistent (see Table 3).\nThe correlation coefficients between the five factors and\ndemographic details are presented in Table 4. Furthermore, Pear-\nson correlation coefficients were calculated between the five\nsubscales and 13 items of the PPMQ. Since the PPMQ is a\nranking instrument, it was hypothesized that related subscales\nand items would be significantly negatively correlated (see\nTable 5). The mean rank of each characteristic is also summar-\nized in Table 5. The characteristic ``kind and understanding'' had\nthe lowest mean rank (i.e., the most important characteristic),\nand ``good housekeeper'' was the least important characteristic.\nTable 2.

We expected the previous structure (see Table 2) to\nhave acceptable fit indices in a distinct sample.\nMaterial and Method\nThe final 26-item version of the scale was completed by\nparticipants were recruited using snowball sampling. Gener-\nally, snowball sampling method is a nonprobability sampling\nstrategy in which one or more individuals are recruited and then\nthey recruit one or more individuals, and so on. It has been\nshown to be an effective sampling strategy to access hidden\ngroups of participants scattered sparsely in large populations.\nIn this study, four individuals (three men and one woman)\nwere assigned and instructed to survey 25 women. Fundamen-\ntally, CFA is used to determine whether an instrument's factor\nstructure derived from exploratory factor analytic approaches\ncan hold up with another respondent sample (Mvududu & Sink,\n2013). We used CFA to examine the previously identified fac-\ntor structure of the scale (see Table 2). All factors were per-\nmitted to co-vary. As fit indices for the CFA, the w2 over degree\nof freedom (w2/df), the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA), the root mean square residual (RMR), the Tucker\u00ad\nLewis Index (TLI), and the comparative fit index (CFI) were\nanalyzed (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Maximum likelihood was used\nas the estimation method. The analysis was performed using\nResults\nThe five-factor model fits the data fairly well (w2/df \u00bc 1.41;\nThere is no complete agreement regarding interpretation of fit\nindices (Mvududu & Sink, 2013), but using relatively conser-\nvative criteria (four or lower for w2/df, 0.90 or higher for CFI\nand TLI; lower than 0.10 for RMR and lower than 0.08 for the\nRMSEA), all current indices fell within acceptable range. It has\nbeen reported that RMSEA may over-reject good models at\nsmall sample sizes. As a result, this is less preferable when\nanalyses are performed on small sample sizes; however, the\nRMSEA was acceptable in the present sample. Of note, in this\n.79 for ``Kindness/Dependability,'' ``Status/Resources,''\n``Attractiveness/Sexuality,'' ``Religiosity/Chastity,'' and\n``Education/Intelligence'' subscales, respectively. The correla-\ntion matrix between subscales also suggested that subscales\nwere relatively independent (rmean\nGeneral Discussion\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the dimensions\nof long-term mate preferences among Iranian women. Follow-\ning a qualitative study and a comprehensive literature review,\nan item pool of 39 items was prepared and quantitatively tested.\nA 26-item scale had the most interpretable factor structure.\nFinally, a CFA on a different sample of participants provided\nrobust psychometric characteristics for the scale. Since gender\ndifferences play a significant role in mate preferences, an all-\nfemale sample was used in this study in order to investigate the\ndimensions of long-term mate preferences among Iranian\nwomen. Developing such female-specific lists of characteris-\ntics can help intrasexual research on mate preferences in future.\nFive dimensions of mate preferences emerged in this study.\nThe first factor, ``kindness/dependability,'' is conceptually\nsimilar to dimensions of ``kindness, warmth'' and ``sociability''\nas previously identified in previous studies (Buss & Barnes,\net al., 2005). The second factor, ``status/resources,'' is concep-\ntually similar to dimensions of ``status/resources'' and ``social\nstatus, financial resources'' (Buss & Barnes, 1986; Kenrick,\nness/sexuality,'' conceptually resembles the dimensions of\n``good looks'' and ``attractiveness'' identified in previous work\nGangestad, 1992). The fourth factor, ``religiosity/chastity,'' is\nvery similar to ``religious'' component of mate preference in\nBuss and Barnes' study (1986). The fifth factor, ``education/\nintelligence,'' is very similar to ``education/intelligence'' pole\nin work of Shackelford and colleagues (2005). While the cor-\nrelation coefficients between these factors were moderate in\nStudy 2; Study 3 suggested that these five factors are relatively\nindependent. Therefore, it may be concluded that these factors\nare tapping relatively independent robust dimensions of mate\npreference among Iranian women.\nStudy 1 revealed a number of culture-related characteristics\nthat were previously underrecognized (i.e., having housing,\nintellectual, honest, and truthful; having a good financial status,\nhigh self-confidence, tall, similar cultural background; and\nhaving a high income level and supportive) or unrecognized\n(i.e., Qeirati). ``Having housing'' is obviously an indicator of\nfinancial resources and a recent qualitative analysis found it to\nbe important in Chinese culture (Zhang, Teng, Chan, & Zhang,\n2014). ``Intellectual'' has also been reported in previous\nresearch (Schwarz & Hassebrauck, 2012). ``Honesty and truth-\nfulness'' and ``supportive'' are indicators of good personality\nand are preferred by most women. This preference may be\nexplained by the fact that negative personality characteristics\nincrease the possibility of future infidelity in a potential mate\nser, & Goetz, 2008). Interestingly, responses in the qualitative\ninterviews emphasized on ``current'' financial/social status\nrather than ``potential'' status. For example, ``having a good\nfinancial status,'' ``having housing,'' and ``having a good\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nincome level'' are suggesting the importance of current status\n(compare with potential). The characteristic ``tall'' has been\nrecently recognized as a particularly important characteristic\nfor females (Stulp et al., 2013) and this was reflected in our\nqualitative analyses. ``Similar cultural background'' also\nresembles characteristics which measure similarity (e.g., simi-\nlar political background).\n``Qeirati'' is a newly discovered important characteristic\nwith cultural value. As mentioned before, to our knowledge,\nno single adjective in English can completely capture the\nmeaning as perceived in Persian. This adjective is a male-\nspecific characteristic, which implies protecting female\nmembers of the family from unwanted sexual attention or any\npossible danger. Research suggests that, in perceived danger-\nous environments, women show a preference for protective and\nphysically formidable mates (Snyder et al., 2011). Therefore,\nthe present findings call for research on the relationship\nbetween choosing Qeirati mates and other variables such as\ndomestic violence, childhood trauma, social perceptions, and\nfear of crime.\nThe relationship between five factors of mate preference\nand demographic details revealed that age was inversely asso-\nciated with all factors meaning that older women set lower\nstandards in choosing a mate. This finding may be explained\nconsidering that the supply of available mates decreases with\nage for women (Oppenheimer, 1988) and therefore they expand\ntheir preferences in a potential mate (South, 1991). Also, it may\nbe explained by the fact that older women may have a weaker\nbargaining hand in mating market (Fales et al., 2016). Yet,\nprevious research reported little in the way of age differences\n(Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick, 2002; Schwarz &\nHassebrauck, 2012). Moreover, higher levels of education were\nassociated with stronger expectations for education/intelli-\ngence factor and lower importance placed on religiosity/chas-\ntity. Attractiveness/Sexuality subscale was also negatively\nassociated with educational level of participants. Ideal age for\nmarriage was inversely correlated with Religiosity/Chastity\n(i.e., those who want to get married older are less inclined to\nmarry a religious person) and positively correlated with Edu-\ncation/Intelligence subscale (i.e., those females who want to\nget married older tend to marry a more educated/intelligent\nperson). Ideal age difference was only significantly correlated\nwith status/resources factor. This may be explained by the fact\nthat men with higher resources and social status tend to be older\n(Kenrick & Keefe, 1992). Findings also revealed that those\nwith inclination toward more religious people desire a higher\nnumber of children which is consistent with previous work\n(Neuman & Ziderman, 1986). BMI was also significantly nega-\ntively associated with attractiveness/sexuality factor; that is,\nthose who are more overweight tend to prefer less attractive\nmen. This is consistent with previous correlation between cou-\nples' BMI (Price & Vandenberg, 1980; Silventoinen, Kaprio,\nThe correlation coefficients between the five factors and\n13 ranking characteristics may be considered as indicators\nof concurrent validity of the dimensions. Each factor is\nsignificantly correlated with the corresponding characteristics\nin the 13-item ranking instrument (see Table 5). The ranks of\nthese 13 characteristics are also consistent with previous work\nStudy 3 provided fit indices for the factor structure of the\n26-item scale that was derived from preceding two studies. All\nindices of fit fell within acceptable range. Moreover, all five\nfactors of mate preference were internally consistent. Factors\nwere also less strongly correlated suggesting relatively inde-\npendent dimensions of mate preference. The relative indepen-\ndence of dimensions of mate preference in the current study is\nconsistent with previously reported universal dimensions of\nmate preference (Shackelford et al., 2005).\nSome limitations of this study are worth noting. First, this\nstudy was conducted to investigate the dimensions of Iranian\nmate preference. The 26-item list of characteristics may be\nused within Iranian culture with acceptable validity and relia-\nbility. It is also recommended for future research to cross-\nculturally validate this scale. Some culture-specific variables\nmay be important in other cultural backgrounds as well. Sec-\nond, while there is evidence for temporal stability of mate\npreferences, the current study did not assess test\u00adretest relia-\nbility of the 26-item list. Third, the present sample was drawn\nfrom Tehran. Due to cultural plurality of Iran, it is recom-\nmended to investigate the dimensions of mate preference in\nother cities and cultures in Iran. Fourth, the sample size in\nStudy 3 is sufficient; however, small for a CFA. It is highly\nrecommended for future research to use confirmatory tech-\nniques to confirm the five-factor structure of this newly devel-\noped scale.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the present study investigated a list of mate preferences\nin Iranian women as an underrecognized population in evolu-\ntionary psychological literature. A female-specific mate pre-\nference scale was developed and validated in three\nconsecutive studies. The five-factor structure of the newly\ndeveloped 26-item scale included kindness/dependability, sta-\ntus/resources, attractiveness/sexuality, religiosity/chastity, and\neducation/intelligence. Therefore, this scale may be used as a\nvalid and reliable measure of female mate preferences.\n"
