To shed light on this phenomenon,\nwe present evidence that jealousy's foundation rests on history of dyadic interactions with caregivers which engender infants'\nexpectations of exclusivity, and on maturation of sociocognitive capacities that enable infants to evaluate whether an exchange\nbetween their caregiver and another child represents a violation of that expectation. We conclude with a call for greater study of\nthe antecedents and sequelae of both normative and atypical presentations of jealousy.

In response to such threat, an individual can express jeal-\nousy via different emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear,\nthat can be combined in several ways (Izard, 1991; Plutchik,\n1980). They can be felt in combination as a blended emotion, or\nseparately but in succession with changes in an individual's\ncognitive appraisal of the eliciting condition or deployment of\nAlternatively, these emotions have been viewed as being driven\nby a foundational and irreducible affective experience that is\nDrawing on a functionalist perspective, wherein jealousy is\nregarded as serving to motivate behaviors that protect the indi-\nvidual\u00adbeloved relationship, Harris points out that in and of\nthemselves, emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear, are not\nknown to be responsible for a motivational state of this nature.\nJealousy has also been addressed in the developmental litera-\nture.

The present\narticle summarizes the body of research in this area. As in work\non jealousy or rivalry in children, we operationally define jeal-\nousy in infants as negatively-valenced responses precipitated by\ndifferential treatment wherein a beloved individual, such as a\ncaregiver, directs attention preferentially toward a third party.\nWe will then address some of the contextual and intraindividual\nfoundations of jealousy's early emergence, and offer sugges-\ntions for future research. Through this treatment we hope to\nadvance understanding of jealousy in its nascent form.\nEvidence of Jealousy in Young Infants\nIn studies using infants as young as 4 and 5 months (Draghi-\njealousy was explored by comparing a target infant's responses\nwhile maternal attention was directed toward a stimulus infant\nversus an adult, a child, or a nonsocial object. Both studies\nreported greater deterioration in the target infant's mood when\nthe stimulus was an infant, but only one (Draghi-Lorenz et al.,\n2001) attributed it to jealousy.The other (Masciuch & Kienapple,\n1993) mentioned that it was difficult to attribute the target\ninfant's deteriorated mood to the experimental manipulation\ndue to confounds stemming from spontaneous fussiness in the\nstimulus infant. To help control for such limitations, several\nstudies have used a lifelike baby doll instead of a real infant\n(Voorthuis et al., 2013). To induce jealousy, the baby doll has\nbeen wrapped in a receiving blanket and equipped with audio\nrecordings of a real infant emitting utterances, such as \"ma-ma.\"\nResearch that compared infants' responses while mother's posi-\ntive vocal affect was directed toward a lifelike baby doll versus\na story book reported that infants displayed greater negativity\nwhen the object of maternal attention was a baby doll (Hart &\nStudies that detailed infants' responses during the mother\u00ad\nbaby doll condition explored infants' facial affect, behavioral,\nand neurological responses. Inquiry into facial affect revealed\nthat 6- and 13-month-olds expressed sadness (Hart, Carrington,\nsistent with findings on 23-month-olds whose presentations of\njealousy were also characterized by this particular expression\n(Szabo et al., 2014). Work with 6-month-olds found that jeal-\nousy was also associated with facial affect expressions of inter-\nest (Hart et al., 2004). In studies with adults, this affect has been\nconstrued as an index of desire or love, an inherent ingredient of\ninterpreted similarly with regard to infants (Hart, 2015).\nAttention to behavioral components revealed that mother-\ndirected approach responses were the most predictable responses\nto differential treatment in nonmobile 6- and 9-month-olds\npronounced in mobile 10- to 13-month-olds (Hart & Behrens,\nThese actions were manifested through assertive restorative\nbids for contact, and through protests, some marked by aggres-\nsion, that expressed anger. Anger was also conveyed through\nfindings using EEG. Inquiry into neural substrates of 9-month-\nolds' responses to differential treatment found that these were\ncharacterized by relative left frontal EEG activation (Mize\net al., 2014). This pattern of neural activity has been associated\nwith approach emotions, including anger in infants (Fox, 1991;\nHe et al., 2010), and jealousy in adults (Harmon-Jones, Peterson,\nInquiry into behavioral components of response also yielded\nevidence of regulatory responses. When their mothers' exclu-\nsive attention was restored following differential treatment,\n10-month-olds were challenged by the task of establishing\ninteractive repair. Recovery was superior among infants who\nhad demonstrated lower durations of mother-directed gaze dur-\ning the eliciting condition (Hart & Behrens, 2013b). Since\naverted gaze has been recognized as an emotion regulation strat-\negy in studies on infants' responses in stressful settings (K. A.\nregulatory responses have been implicated in jealousy responses\nof both children and adults (Volling et al., 2002), visual inatten-\ntion was interpreted as a regulatory strategy in the present con-\ntext as well.\nIn addition to these findings on facial affect, behavioral, and\nneurological responses, inquiry into jealousy's presentation\nyielded several noteworthy response patterns. First, infants'\nfacial affect expressions of sadness were found associated with\napproach behaviors indicative of anger (Hart et al., 2004). Even\nthough these two kinds of response are known to co-occur, they\nusually do so in succession, in what is sometimes described as a\ndisplay of ambivalence. The field of infancy research rarely\nreports on these two responses occurring as a simultaneous\nevent. Instead, sad facial affect is typically seen in combination\nwith avoidant behaviors (Cohn & Tronick, 1983; Mesman, van\nIJzendoorn, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2009), while angry\nfacial affect tends to coincide with approach behaviors (Lewis,\nappears that the infant's affective-behavioral response to differ-\nential treatment is phenotypically unique, and tied specifically\nto jealousy.\nBy entailing components of response that are associated with\nboth sadness and anger, jealousy's presentation in infants sug-\ndepiction is compatible with notions of jealousy in adults as a\nStill, this does not rule out the possibility that these observable\nexpressions of emotionality are driven by a more foundational\nHart & Carrington, 2002) or an underlying emotion that is\nan emotion is conceptualized as motivated specifically by per-\nceived threat to a valued relationship and operates by stimulat-\ning emotions that work in conjunction toward the goal of\nrestoring or maintaining the relationship being challenged\nInterestingly, the prominence of infants'restorative bids sup-\nports Bowlby's observation that, \"in most young children the\nmere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough\nImplicit in this comment is Bowlby's understanding that as an\nexpression of attachment behavior, jealousy is triggered by\nsense of threat, which coheres with understanding of jealousy in\nchildren and adults as a response to endangerment (Parrott,\nThe combination of sadness and anger is also notable for its\npotential to prompt behavior in both infants and caregivers\n(Hart, 2015). While an infant's expression of sadness serves as\na signal that engenders caregivers' nurturance (K. A. Buss &\nZeman, Nesin, & Fitzgerald, 2003), anger mobilizes actions that\nare instrumental toward achieving a goal (Frijda, 2008; Lewis\net al., 1990). In the context of differential treatment, an infant's\nsad facial affect may serve to reenlist caregiver attention, while\nanger may prompt a rival to withdraw. Indeed, some evidence\nsuggests that jealousy acts as a signal that observers find com-\nA second unique pattern of linkages emerged from findings\nthat infants' sad facial expressions differed with the degree to\nwhich their mothers' vocal affect toward the baby doll was pos-\nitively valenced (Hart, 2010a; Hart, Field, Del Valle, et al.,\n1998). When mothers displayed greater positivity, their infants\ndemonstrated greater negativity. This association is exactly\nopposite that which would have been expected had the mothers\nbeen smiling toward something other than an infant (Termine &\nCummings and associates' (1981) discovery that when witness-\ning their parents display affection toward each other, children\ndid not display a matching pattern of positive emotionality or\naffection. To the contrary, they expressed anger.\nA third pattern of linkages emerged from treatments that\nmanipulated the identity of the adult demonstrating differential\ntreatment. When 12-month-olds were ignored while an adult's\nattention was directed exclusively toward a book, their responses\ndid not depend on whether the adult was their mother or a stran-\nger. However, when the object of adult attention was a lifelike\nbaby doll, infants displayed greater protest if the adult was their\nmother (Hart, Field, Del Valle, et al., 1998). This finding is con-\nsistent with similar research using preschoolers (Bauminger-\nZvieli & Kugelmass, 2013). It is also compatible with evidence\nthat adults who reported greater distress upon seeing their part-\nner flirt with a third party also reported feeling more dependent\non that partner (Rydell & Bringle, 2007), and understanding of\njealousy as a feature of love relationships (D. M. Buss, 2000).\nIn sum, differential treatment elicits responses in infants\nmarked by facial affect of sadness and interest, mother-directed\nrestorative bids for contact and attention, protests and neuro-\nlogical responses that are consistent with anger, and the deploy-\nment of regulatory strategies. Since maternal inattentiveness\nwas held constant across conditions, it seems unlikely that\ninfants were perturbed simply due to being ignored, and so\nenthusiasm for interpretations other than jealousy is limited.\nFurther support for this conclusion can be drawn from findings\non the manner in which these perturbations were exhibited.\nThese unveiled phenotypic characteristics and patterns of\nresponse parallel to those which are widely accepted as indica-\ntive of jealousy in both children and adults. These also appear to\nbe both unique to differential treatment and conceptually aligned\nwith understanding of jealousy as a response to threat.\nThis interpretation of jealousy is not offered without some\ncaveats. Granted, confidence in this interpretation would be\ngreater were it possible to point to a particular facial affect\nexpression that is unique to jealousy. Unfortunately, such an\nexpression is unknown to scientists working with adults or chil-\nthose areas, infancy researchers have sought a basis other than\nsimple reliance on facial affect to infer jealousy. This of course\nis the uniqueness of the eliciting context. Tapping into this\nmethodology yields negatively valenced emotionality in infants\nthat has consistently been interpreted as jealousy by the investi-\ngators, while few, if any, alternative interpretations have been\nput forth.\nProximal Foundations\nEvidence of jealousy in young infants raises questions with\nrespect to mechanisms responsible for its unfolding. Two kinds\nof factors may be especially relevant. The first pertains to con-\ntextual influences; the second to maturational processes that\nrelate to sociocognitive development.\nContextual Influences\nJealousy in children has primarily been regarded as arising\nwithin contexts marked by competition with a rival for a car-\negiver's attention. In different eras, the nature of the rival has\ndiffered considerably. In classic writings, the rival was a parent\n(S. Freud, 1923). Later on, attention turned to peers (Bridges,\nwith the rise in nuclear family structures and a number of alarm-\nattention turned to contexts where the rival was a sibling. At this\npoint, child responses that had previously been referred to as\njealousy and had generally been regarded as benign, came to be\nreframed as \"rivalry\" and interpreted as a sign of maladjustment\ntion, laboratory research in this area began by using triads com-\nprised of a parent and a pair of siblings, with the aim of eliciting\nrivalry, and the prediction that rivalry would be amplified among\nchildren who were insecurely attached (Teti & Ablard, 1989).\nAs expected, such efforts were successful. Interestingly,\nhowever, recent studies using young infants found that a par-\nent's differential attention toward a third party is disturbing to\ninfants, even those who do not have a sibling. In fact, there are\nfew differences between presentations of jealousy in infants\nwho are firstborn versus those who have siblings (Hart, Field,\ning for it suggests that a history of exposure to eliciting condi-\ntions, such as differential treatment and triadic conflict, which\nto some degree are inevitable for infants who have a sibling, is\nnot a necessary precondition for the onset of jealousy. This\nnotion is compatible with evidence that jealousy in adults does\nnot depend on whether an individual has a sibling (Bringle &\nonset is not dependent on history of exposure to a sibling, other\nkinds of influences must be considered.\nAnumber of studies asked whether jealousy's presentation in\nyoung infants depends on contextual events that pertain to char-\nacteristics of mothers and the mother\u00adinfant relationship (Hart,\nIn line with evidence that young siblings' presentations of jeal-\nousy were more acute among children who were insecurely\nattached (Teti & Ablard, 1989), jealousy in infants was found\nheightened among those with insecure-resistant attachment.\nAcute responses were also demonstrated by infants whose\nmothers displayed hostile or insensitive interactive behaviors.\nIn contrast, jealousy was found blunted among infants with\ninsecure-avoidant attachment and among infants of depressed\nmothers. Deleterious effects of maternal depression were com-\npounded by parenting styles marked by disengagement. In addi-\ntion to prompting presentations of jealousy that were\nexceptionally flat, this amalgam of risk factors was associated\nwith infants directing restorative bids toward a stranger rather\nthan mother, which is a well-recognized sign of emotional dys-\nregulation in infants and young children.\nThese findings highlight divergent pathways of development\nas having roots in dyadic experiences with caregivers. They also\nyielded four profiles of jealousy's development: inhibited, dis-\ninhibited, dysregulated, and organized (Hart, 2015). The latter\nprofile, organized, is characterized by mild levels of negative\nemotionality, moderate durations of mother-directed restorative\nbids, and emotion regulation skills that enable the infant to\nsmoothly resume contact with mother once her exclusive atten-\ntion has been restored. This characterization is remarkable for\noffering an empirically based definition of jealousy's normative\nform, not only in the statistical sense but also on the basis of\nassociations with protective influences (Cicchetti, 2006). It is\nalso relevant to understanding that infant jealousy's valence,\neven in its typical form (as displayed by the securely attached\ninfant of a nondepressed, sensitive mother), is negative.\nUnfortunately, this reality, coupled with the fact that jealousy is\nelicited in triadic contexts, has led to some longstanding mis-\nconceptions. The chief one is that jealousy originates due to his-\ntory of negatively valenced triadic conflict, and in its absence\njealousy does not unfold.\nTo the contrary, linkages with characteristics of mothers\n(rather than sibling status), and with protective influences\n(rather than conflict), remind us that emotional development\noccurs through a process in which events that are responsible\nfor the onset of an emotion are not the same as those responsible\nfor eliciting that emotion once it has already been set in place.\nMore simply, \"when affects emerge\" and \"how they emerge\" are\nseparate processes (Sroufe, 1995, p. 4). Thus, we have sug-\ngested that understanding how jealousy emerges calls upon\ninsight into history of dyadic, not triadic, interactions, and\nunderstanding that in its normative form, jealousy is born, not of\nconflict, but of positive experiences. These experiences consist\nof exchanges with a beloved individual, such as a caregiver,\nthrough which an infant comes to prize and expect exclusive\nSociocognitive Foundations\nThe end of the infant's first year is marked by important mile-\nstones including advances in cognition that relate to socioemo-\ntional and cognitive development. These are regarded as being\nof enormous magnitude, such that they are responsible for pre-\ncipitating a \"psychological revolution\" (Anderson et al., 2013).\nNevertheless, jealousy has been construed as a complex emo-\ntion, classified among \"sophisticated\" affects such as embar-\nrassment, guilt, pride, shame, resentment, and exasperation\n(Fischer, Shaver, & Carnochan, 1989). This class of emotions is\nseen as unavailable to infants less than 18 months of age (Case,\nHayward, Lewis, & Hurst, 1988; Lewis, Sullivan, Stanger, &\nWeiss, 1989) due to requiring advanced cognitive processes that\nhave \"at their heart, the notion of self, agency, and conscious\nThe notion that jealousy is beyond the ability of 1-year-olds\nhas been influential. It has rested on eloquent theorizing, yet the\nempirical basis has been limited. A frequently cited source of\nsupport is Lewis and associates' (1989) report on the contribu-\ntion of self-awareness to the development of complex emotions.\nThey found that a toddler's ability to express the complex emo-\ntion of embarrassment, but not the basic emotion of wariness,\ncoincided with her ability to display evidence of self-recogni-\ntion. This finding led to the conclusion that the capacity to\nexpress embarrassment depends on the prior acquisition of self-\nawareness, which also served as the basis for assuming that this\nconclusion applied to all other complex emotions, including\njealousy. However, the importance of self-recognition to jeal-\nousy's presentation has never been tested. A second study of\nimportance was research on child responses to differential treat-\nment as a function of child age (Masciuch & Kienapple, 1993).\nIts conclusion that jealousy was not apparent in infants under 18\nmonths of age (Case et al., 1988) has been questioned since dis-\nturbances were also displayed by younger infants but discounted\nby the investigators in a manner that has been deemed arbitrary\n(Draghi-Lorenz et al., 2001). Nor has it been replicated.\nInterestingly, the report of jealousy in children who witnessed\ntheir parents treat each other with affection (Cummings et al.,\na half years, and it did not mention any differences as a function\nof child age.\nLimited empirical support for viewing jealousy as a complex\nemotion has led to growing openness to the possibility that there\nmay be levels of interpersonal awareness that are not essential\nopenness has been spurred further by evidence that jealousy is\nexhibited by autistic children despite their deficiencies with\nrespect to a host of complex emotions, such as pride and guilt\nHobson, 2010). It has also been documented in nonhuman spe-\ncies even though they lack sense of self (Harris & Prouvost,\ngested that jealousy may be more \"prepared\" than other com-\nplex emotions, and so it requires minimal cognition (Panksepp,\n2010). Along these lines, Campos and associates (Campos,\nWalle, & Dahl, 2010) suggested that as a phenomenon which\ntaps basic emotions, it is possible that jealousy emerges late in\nthe first year, subsequent to the development of basic emotions,\nyet prior to the emergence of complex emotions.\nThese suggestions may be pursued by considering that at its\nmost basic level, jealousy entails that an individual has an emo-\ntional response to a relation between two other individuals\n(Hobson, 2010). This conceptualization calls for efforts to\nunveil evidence of the young infant's capacity to interpret this\nvery context. At least two bodies of research have been forth-\ncoming.\nThe first arose from research on couples' transitions to par-\nenthood upon the birth of a firstborn child (Cowan & Cowan,\nDepeursinge, Favez, Scaiola, & Lopes, 2010). When research-\ners observed infants interacting within triadic social contexts\nthat included both mother and father, they found that infants\nwere not mere observers. Nor were they limited to interacting\nwith only one social partner at a time. Rather, they played an\nactive role in triadic social exchanges by displaying rapid transi-\ntions in visual attention, from one social partner to the other, as\nif tracking an ongoing exchange. They also displayed valence-\nmatching of affect across social partners, suggesting the ability\nto communicate affect with two partners simultaneously.\nTriangular bids of this nature have been observed in infants as\nyoung as 3 months (Philipp, Fivaz-Depeursinge, Corboz-\nered well-established by the age of 6 to 9 months (McHale,\nFivaz-Depeursinge, Dickstein, Robertson, & Daley, 2008), and\ndocumented across different kinds of triadic social settings\nunderstanding of interaction skill as undergoing a progression\nthat starts with understanding person\u00adperson exchanges, and\nprogresses to comprehending person\u00adobject and then person\u00ad\nperson\u00adobject exchanges toward the end of the first year,\nMcHale and associates (2008) propose that the first year ends\nwith robust capacities for person\u00adperson\u00adperson interaction\ncapacities that originated early in the first year.\nEvidence that infants are capable of responding to a relation\nbetween other individuals also emerged from work on moral\ncognition (Wynn & Bloom, 2014). When 6-month-olds were\ngiven a choice between two characters, they opted for the one\nthey had seen acting in a helpful (versus unhelpful) manner\ntoward a third party (Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007). Similar\nfindings were uncovered using infants as young as 3 months\n(Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2010). By the age of 8 months,\ninfants demonstrated preferences for a helpful (versus unhelp-\nful) character even if that character's efforts to be helpful were\nunsuccessful, suggesting the ability to understand and even\nappreciate a character's intentions (Hamlin, 2013). Cognition of\nthis nature can drive emotionality. Cummings and associates\nconcluded that, \"by approximately 1 year of age, children are\nnot only aware of other's angry and affectionate interactions but\nare also quite likely to evidence an emotional reaction to them\"\nTaken together, these findings reflect a level of cognitive\nsophistication that speaks to the possibility that by the latter half\nof the first year an infant is able to process exchanges such as\nthose between his mother and another infant. Moreover, it seems\nfeasible that when observing his mother treat another child with\naffection, the infant is able to interpret that stimulus as posing\nchallenge to his expectation of being the sole recipient of his\nmother's affection.\nFuture Directions\nWe have argued that jealousy's foundation rests on experiences\nthat foster expectations of exclusivity as well as cognitive pre-\nrequisites that enable an infant to evaluate whether an exchange\nbetween his caregiver and another child represents a violation of\nthat expectation. This calls for deeper understanding of the out-\ngrowth of such expectations.\nOne avenue toward such understanding draws on theory that\njealousy is necessary toward protecting access to a caregiver's\nresources when these are challenged by another child (Hamilton,\nwhen a child finds himself relatively neglected in favor of the new baby,\nassertion of his claims may redress the balance. Thus in the right place,\nat the right time, and in the right degree, anger is not only appropriate\nThese positions are relevant to interpreting restorative bids that\nare an especially prominent feature of jealousy in infants.\nBothersome as they may be, their intractability may be grounded\nin their importance toward protecting a relationship that is vital\nThis possibility can be addressed through attention to blunted\npresentations of jealousy. As displayed by infants of depressed\nmothers and infants with insecure-avoidant attachment, inhib-\nited presentations of jealousy seem consistent with reports of\npassivity and expressionlessness being exhibited by such infants\nin other stressful situations (Dix, Meunier, Lusk, & Perfect,\n2006). Attenuated emotionality has been found predictive of\ndiminished social competence (Maughan, Cicchetti, Toth, &\nRogosch, 2007), suggesting that adjustment difficulties upon a\nsibling's arrival (Dunn, 1986) may be foreshadowed by jeal-\nousy's blunted expression during infancy.\nWhether and how inhibited expressions of jealousy differ\nfrom other atypical presentations is unclear. Campos and associ-\nates (2010) speculated that these may arise from protracted\nexposure to differential treatment. In line with observations\n(Bowlby, 1973) that prolonged exposure to separation from\nmother leads children to pass through stages of protest, despair,\nand finally detachment, Campos and associates proposed a sim-\nilar trajectory in which acute jealousy is an infant's initial\nresponse to differential treatment. However, upon failing to\nreclaim caregiver attention, it is followed eventually by a more\nimpaired state of resignation, marked by blunted affect. The\npossibility that acute jealousy is a precursor of blunted jealousy\nis an intriguing notion. Still, evidence that inhibited and disin-\nhibited presentations of jealousy originate with different kinds\nof risk factors suggests continuity along separate trajectories.\nUltimately, insight into pathways of jealousy's development\nwill require prospective longitudinal research on antecedents\nand sequelae of both organized and atypical presentations of\njealousy.\nCross-sectional studies will also be informative, especially\nthose which explore jealousy across different relationships.\nEvidence that differential treatment was more disturbing to\ninfants if it had been elicited by mother rather than a stranger\n(Hart, Field, Letourneau, et al., 1998) coheres with understand-\ning that in its most intense form, jealousy in adults occurs within\nlove relationships. It is also consistent with the observation that\n\"there is strong bias for attachment behavior to become directed\nmainly toward one particular person and for a child to become\np. 308). Nevertheless, jealousy in adults is a feature of relation-\nships other than those which are romantic or sexual in nature (D.\nM. Buss, 2000), and jealousy in children can occur among peers\n(Parker, Kruse, & Aikins, 2010; Parker, Low, Walker, & Gamm,\n2005). In a similar vein, jealousy in infants has been noted in\ntheir relationships with caregivers other than mother, and with\nThe possibility that jealousy in infants is not limited solely to\nprotecting the relationship with the primary caregiver calls for\ninquiry into expectations of exclusivity as they arise across a\nspectrum of relationships. These relationships may provide the\ninfant with caregiving, or hold potential to provide surrogate\ncaregiving, or offer entirely different sorts of desirable resources.\nBased on numerous anecdotal accounts, comparisons of this\nnature are likely to reveal that the infant who expects to be the\nsole recipient of his mother's resources can, at the very same\ntime, also expect to be the sole recipient of his father's resources\nand those of others as well. Consequently, it is plausible that\nefforts along these lines will reveal that infants' expectations of\nexclusivity tend to operate in a nonreciprocal, rather than bidi-\nrectional, manner.\nA relationship that may be especially informative is that\nwhich includes twins (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van\nold twins found that differential treatment prompted responses\nmuch like those which had been reported in research where the\nrival was not a twin (Gewirtz & Pelaez-Nogueras, 1999). The\nfact that differential treatment appears to elicit jealousy in twins,\nwho most likely have lesser history of exclusive contact with a\ncaregiver, raises questions about the nature of dyadic interaction\nthat is sufficient for engendering expectations of exclusivity.\nOne possibility rests on observations that triadic social contexts\ndo not preclude opportunities for an infant to receive preferen-\ntial treatment. This was illustrated in a qualitative study that\ndescribed how a caregiver of twins alternated the direction of\nher attention between each infant individually (Draghi-Lorenz,\n2010). Perhaps the degree of exclusivity that is inherent in pref-\nerential treatment is sufficient for precipitating expectations that\ncan give rise to jealousy. This would help explain why jeal-\nousy's emergence does not depend on birth order (Hart, Field,\nDel Valle, et al., 1998). Such speculation leads to suggesting\nthat expectations of exclusivity emerge through dyadic\nexchanges, including those which take place within nonexclu-\nsive settings in the sense that they are embedded within higher\norder relationships. This calls for investigative attention to jeal-\nousy's emergence in light of dyadic experiences and as a func-\ntion of the social contexts in which these are embraced (Fearon\nTaken together, inquiry into expectations of exclusivity as\nthey arise across multiple early relationships, even in the absence\nof exclusive contact, stands to bolster argument that jealousy\nemerges within the first year of life. Moreover, such efforts\nshould reveal that, even in its normative form, nascent jealousy\nis a robust phenomenon. Evidence of its robustness clearly points\nto the evolution of functionality that is of profound importance,\nand so it is most worthy of investigative attention.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nNone declared.\nReferences\nAdler, A.
