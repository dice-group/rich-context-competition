Over five million people have died\nand millions more have been displaced in what some com-\nmentators have called \"Africa's First World War\" (see Cook,\nRwandan and Ugandan attempt to oust their former pupil the\nCongolese President Laurent Kabila, whom they brought to\npower in 1996. However, that alliance ended in acrimony\nand bitterness, and eventually war. What complicated inter-\nnational attempts to end the Congolese conflict were the\ncompeting narratives of why the war started. Washington\nbacked Rwandan and Ugandan claims of border security, and\nthat the Congo was experiencing an internal civil war. Kabila,\non the other hand claimed, and this was backed up by France\nthat the war was a clear Rwandan and Ugandan violation of\nCongolese sovereignty. By 1999, the international commu-\nnity got everyone to sit down in Lusaka, Zambia, to create an\nunderfunded and undermanned United Nations (UN)\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo (MONUC). The war eventually came to a sputtering\nend after the assassination of Kabila by one of his body-\nThe Second Congo War provides us with a case study for\ntesting theories of media framing. Most American scholarly\nstudies of media and foreign policy have focused on places\nwhere the United States actively put boots on the ground\n(e.g., Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq) or should have (Rwanda).\nSecond, it has often been argued thatAmerican media (and in\neffect all media) indexes their reporting to support\nWashington's foreign policy. The old adage that politics\nstops at the water's edge applied to the press as well. Robert\nEntman (2004) argues that the end of the Cold War weak-\nened the \"journalists'habit of deference\" (i.e., indexing), and\nthey became critical of President Clinton's humanitarian\nmissions because they could (p. 107). This article hopes to\nadd to the literature of the connections between media and\nAmerican foreign policy after the Cold War in four ways.\nFirst, a large component of U.S. participation in UN peace-\nkeeping is not providing military, but critical humanitarian\nand logistical aid. This article hopes to fill that gap in the\nliterature in how the media covers these events. Second, the\nCongo provides us an opportunity to test whether Entman's\ntheories of the post\u00adCold War American media are correct.\nThird, it is important to provide a comparative perspective to\na study of the American press and the Congo War. The\nAmerican press is often seen as parochial and unconcerned\n1University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nChristopher R.

So there is much insight to be gained\nby comparing coverage of the Congo in the New York Times\nand the Washington Post with two major French newspapers\n(Le Figaro and Le Monde) and two major British dailies\n(Guardian and London Times). Putting the Congo War in a\ncomparative press perspective challenges our global under-\nstanding of indexing. Finally, this paper hopes to make a\nsmall contribution to how Africa is examined in the Western\nmedia. Andrew Breslau (1987) argues that media coverage\nof African conflicts has often lacked context, sophistication\nand exposition (p. 6). Stories on Africa are full of poverty,\npolitical unrest, primitive war, \"ancient tribal hatreds,\" ter-\nrorism, and crime (see Livingstone & Eachus 1999).\nTo accomplish these goals, this paper is broken up into\nseveral sections. First, I will briefly examine the Second\nCongo War and the competing narratives of Rwanda,\nUganda, and Kabila's Congo. I will then explore the subtle\nyet real anti-Kabila bias in Washington. Second, this paper\nwill look at the present literature of media effects of framing\nand indexing. It is in this section that we start to define and\nexplore how to measure media bias in the Congo. If we could\npinpoint possible \"frames\": first, coverage of the roles\nRwanda and Uganda played in the war; second, the reporting\nof genocide and massacres, and whether there was a discus-\nsion of a counter genocide perpetuated by Rwanda; and third,\nthe exploitation of natural resources by all parties. These\nthree variables will serve as functional proxies of whether a\npaper was biased. We will then look at the methodology of\nselecting articles and stories and the coding criteria for the\nsix newspapers selected. By examining coverage from\nJanuary of 1998 (8 months before the war began) to Kabila's\nuntimely death 25 months later, we should be able to com-\npare and contrast the quality and quantity of reporting, and\nhow different nations framed the same international event.\nFinally, we will explore our empirical findings and our theo-\nretical conclusions.\nPart I: American Policy in the Congo:\nAccepting the Rwandan Frame\nBefore we turn to the literature of politics and media studies,\nit is important that we provide a brief case study of the war\nand examination of American policy (also see Cook, 2010).\nEven though it is an arbitrary date, it might be informative to\nstart the discussion of the Congo with the Rwandan genocide\nin April 1994. That genocide had consequences felt across\nthe African Great Lakes region. The Hutu perpetuators fled\nto neighboring Congo (at the time still called Zaire) along-\nside Rwandan Hutus civilians fearing Tutsi retribution. The\nInterahamwe and the genocidaires used the bustling and hec-\ntic refugee camps to launch border raids on the new Tutsi-led\ngovernment. The government of Zaire, led by Mobutu Sese\nSeko looked the other way.\nRwanda now had a security issue with its Western neigh-\nbor. Kigali's concern with its Zairian-based borders was also\nshared by Uganda who were fighting their own cross-border\nrebels. Both realized that the situation was not going to\nchange with Mobutu in power. By 1996 Kampala and Kigali\nhammered together an umbrella coalition of various militia\nand Congolese rebel groups who were supplemented by their\nown armed forces to overthrow Kinshasa. The rebel move-\nment was led by Laurent Kabila, a long-time revolutionary\nwith socialist, nationalist, and Maoist tendencies (Lumumba-\nindifference toward the Rwandan genocide in 1994,\nWashington helped train and supply the Rwandan Army and\nrebel forces as they advanced on the capital (Duke, 1998).\nThe Mobutu regime quickly disintegrated. By May 1997,\nthe rebels captured Kinshasa. The triumphant Kabila\nrenamed Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nKabila quickly moved to consolidate his power: outlawed\npolitical parties, declared martial law and filled key security\npositions with Rwandan Tutsi or those loyal to him. This\nincluded James Kabarebe, a Rwandan Army officer who\nbecame Kabila's Chief of Staff. He had originally promised\nfree elections which were then postponed indefinitely\nself in a difficult domestic situation. Rene Lemarchand\n(1999) notes that many Congolese felt that the war of libera-\ntion had turned into a Rwandan occupation. Meanwhile, his\nauthoritarian and economic policies were unpopular domes-\ntically and abroad. Furthermore, and ominously, Rwanda and\nUganda (and joined by Burundi) now felt Kabila was not\ndoing enough to help them fight the Interahamwe and other\nrebel groups still operating in the Congolese territory.\nSomething had to give, and to salvage his crumbling\nregime, Kabila decided to remove the foreign influence from\nthe government first. In July 1998, Kabila asked Rwanda and\nUganda to leave the Congolese territory and fired officers\nlike Kabarebe. Kampala and Kigali were caught off-guard,\nbut they quickly improvized a new strategy--They would\njust replace Kabila with the Congolese sympathetic to their\nneeds just as they replaced Mobutu. The Second Congo War\nbroke out 6 days later. The Rwandan\u00adUgandan alliance\nbrought together a coalition of indigenous anti-Kabila\ngroups, but there was no doubt that the Rwandan Patriotic\nArmy (RPA) and the Ugandan Army pulled the strings and\nformed the military back bone (Rosenblum, 2002).According\nto Rwandan and Ugandan narratives, the war was an internal\ncivil war.\nThe bid to remove Kabila in a lightening campaign was\nthwarted when the governments of Angola, Namibia, and\nZimbabwe came to his rescue. Besides his foreign help\nKabila realized the greatest strength he had with the\nCongolese people was not the love of him but the hatred of\nthe Rwandans. Kabila's narrative of the conflict, which was\naccepted by many Congolese and his allies, revolved around\nthe idea of an external invasion and a violation of Congolese\nsovereignty. His regime whipped up anti-Tutsi sentiments\nthat bordered (but did not cross) on incitement to genocide.\nThe strategy worked, and by the spring of 1999 the war had\nturned into an uncomfortable and deadly stalemate--but\nKabila was still in power. The UN was able to hold cease fire\ntalks in Lusaka, Zambia, which hammered out an under-\nfunded and undermanned UN peacekeeping mission\n(MONUC), which none of the parties fully accepted.\nBut a careful analysis of American policy reveals a subtle\nbut real anti-Kabila bias. The Clinton Administration\naccepted the Rwandan\u00adUgandan frame and treated this con-\nflict as an internal civil war and not one of foreign invasion.\nClinton may have inadvertently led Kigali to believe that\nsuch an invasion would have his blessing (Prunier, 2009, p.\n195). When it came to interpreting Rwandan actions,\nWashington always viewed them through the lens of border\nsecurity and the guilt of the genocide they ignored. Rwandan\nleader Paul Kagame also worked hard to make sure the West\nnever forgot their indifference to the events of April 1994.\nWashington never cut Laurent Kabila slack. Georges\nNzongola-Ntalaja (2004b) notes that the United States\nthought Kabila was erratic and incompetent. In the words of\nGerard Prunier (2009), Kabila was an unrepentant leftist\nwith a strong distrust of the West. They claimed he was\nresponsible for 95% of the cases of obstruction in the UN\nMission. His behavior has been an example of the \"worst\ncase behavior . . . an obstacle to deployment\" (International\ncorrupt, or disliked Kabila was, many Congolese saw the\nnew Kigali-backed rebel group (Rally for Congolese\nDemocracy) as nothing more than a front for a Rwandan\ninvasion and occupation.\nThe American bias against Kabila manifests itself in two\nareas: First, Kabila was increasingly coming under interna-\ntional attack for the human rights violations that occurred\nduring the First Congo War, including the massacres of Hutu\nUN Mapping Report has stated bordered on genocidal, were\nactually carried out by Rwandan forces--but Kabila bore the\nbrunt of the global anger. At first, Kabila stonewalled the UN\nto protect his Rwandan allies. But Congolese international\naid and debt relief servicing were threatened over his refusal\nto participate in the investigation. So even though the RPF\ninitiated revenge killings, Rwanda had to never answer for it.\nWhereas Congolese aid was tied to Kabila's human rights\nrecord, it was not the case for Rwanda. Kigali continued to\nreceive a flow of monies from the world community as long\nas it gave lip service to good governance and that the money\nwould not go to the military. In fact Rwandan brutality con-\ntinued into the Second War, which further alienated them\nfrom the Congolese population, reinforced them as agents of\nan occupation, and delegitimized their own rebel groups.\nThe second issue of bias concerned the question of natural\nresource exploitation. Washington argued that Kabila and his\ncronies were selling strategic minerals for personal gain--\nwhich they were. The UN report on exploitation in the Congo\n(UN, 2002), for example, was critical of Kabila's role in \"the\ncontinuation of the war\" in connection to financial incen-\ntives. But the same condemnation was not held by the Clinton\nAdministration for their allies, Rwanda and Uganda. Because\nfor all the talk of securing borders (which were real enough),\nboth Rwanda and Uganda were directly benefitting from\nCongolese resources as well. In fact, Prunier notes that eco-\nnomic exploitation of an occupied Congo was always a fac-\ntor for Kigali. Rwanda's embrace of a second war would\nresolve the border problem, serve to fix internal dissent, but\njust as importantly share the spoils of war among the elite\nand Rwanda became the number one exporters of diamond\nand copper in the world market (Lumumba-Kasongo, 2001).\nabout 1,800 trucks carrying logs, timber, coffee, and so on\nhave been brought out of the Congo to Uganda for re-expor-\ntation by Ugandan firms. Rwanda was not much better. The\nreport also reveals the underlying dynamic within the con-\nflict: \"because of its lucrative nature, [the Second Congo\nWar] created a `win\u00adwin' situation for all belligerents.\"\nAmong this backdrop of resource extraction, the Rwandan\u00ad\nUgandan alliance actually broke down as they fought each\nover diamonds. It would be difficult to argue that the war was\njust about border protection when the two sides were indis-\ncriminately killing Congolese civilians in the city of\nKisangani over natural resources.\nThe Second Congo War was complicated, but even if we\nposit--and there is good reason to believe so--that the\nClinton Administration legitimately wanted to end the suf-\nfering in the name of humanitarianism, they still framed the\nconflict through a prism of anti-Kabila bias and Rwandan\nand Ugandan security needs. Ending the war meant doing so\non terms favorable to Kampala and Kigali. Washington out-\nright rejected Kabila's claims about Congolese sovereignty\nand instead favored the narrative of the 1994 genocide and\ncross-border rebels. They did not question the Rwanda's role\nin genocidal reprisal killings after 1994 or economic logic of\nRwanda and Uganda's intervention.\nFrance on the other hand followed a different foreign pol-\nicy path. To show you the importance of Africa to Paris: the\nFrench have intervened 43 times in Francophone sub-Saha-\nmilitarily active external power in Africa in the nearly 50\nyears since decolonization\" (Griffin, 2007). Suffice to it say,\nthe crux of the French foreign policy was probably more\nanti-Rwandan than pro-Kabila. After all, the French tried to\nsalvage the Mobutu regime against Kabila's forces in the\nFirst War. Paris, if anything, was consistently pro-Hutu in the\nGreat Lakes region and considered the Tutsi-led RPF, and its\nalliance with Uganda as the real threat to Francophone hege-\nmony in Africa. Fault lines with the United States started to\nshow up in both strategic and economic realms across Central\nAfrica. Washington and Paris had issues, whether it was\nCongo\u00adBrazzaville's attempt to deny the French ELF com-\npany its oil concessions and give them to American\n4 SAGE Open\ncompanies, or the increasing suspicion of Clinton's new\nAfrican leaders as a ploy to strengthen Anglophone Africa.\nWhen Kabila turned on the Rwandan\u00adUgandans, it was only\nnatural for Paris to gravitate toward him. Instead of seeing it\nas a civil war like Washington, Paris and several other\nEuropean capitals like Brussels saw the conflict as foreign\naggression.\nPart II: Literature Review of Media\nEffects: Indexing and Sourcing\nThere has been an ongoing debate about the media's power\nto influence foreign policy (see Robinson, 2002). When it\ncomes to understandingAfrican conflicts, the media becomes\na crucial window to understanding the issues involved. To\ntest how the media shaped our understanding of the Congo\nconflict and its relation to policy in Paris or Washington it is\nimportant that we examine the existing literature of media\neffects and its impact on reporting foreign policy.\nIt has been argued that the media coverage can play an\nindependent agenda-setting role (Shaw, 1993). This phenom-\nenon of media power has been called the \"CNN-effect\"\n(Williams, 1993). This theory has been tested in various\nforms including whether the media can cause nations to\nlaunch humanitarian interventions (see Livingston & Eachus,\nconsistently shown that the \"CNN-effect\" is at best weak or\nall together non-existent. Zaller and Chiu (1996) argue that\nreporters will regard an event newsworthy if legitimate gov-\nernment sources say it is. Leon V. Sigal (1973) succinctly\nstates,\nEven when the journalist is in a position to observe an event\ndirectly, he remains reluctant to offer interpretations of his own,\npreferring instead to rely on his news sources. For the reporter,\nin short, most news is not what has happened, but what someone\nJonathan Mermin (1999) argues that the spectrum of\ndebate in Washington has \"determined the spectrum of\ndebate in the news\" (p. 143). Mermin argues that there are\nalso fiscal incentives to \"base their stories on the statements\nof official sources\" (p. 9). For example, budgetary cutbacks\nover the last decade have hit investigative journalism the\nhardest. While these moves are cost effective, it has forced\nthe media to seek out and rely on government sources and\nultimately print the government position.\nRobert Entman (2003) notes that the debate within media\nstudies is not about the \"CNN-effect,\" but two competing\nschools of thought. The first is what he calls the hegemonic\nschool, and it is best articulated by the work of Herman and\nChomsky (1988) in Manufacturing Consent. They argue\nthat the American media is subservient to powerful vested\neconomic and political interests. Corporate media will rarely\nquestion policy, and in fact will actively filter out stories\nthat question the official government line. Hermann and\nChomsky contend that elite control helps manufacture con-\nsent (borrowing a phrase from Walter Lippmann, 1922).\nSimilarly, Augelli and Murphy (1988) argue that the Anglo-\nAmerican media industry is a compliant partner in a\nGramscian model of empire building and the new world\norder with the political elite.\nThe second school of thought is indexing and is best artic-\nulated by W. Lance Bennett (1990) in his seminal article on\ngovernment and press relations. Bennett states, \"Mass media\nnews professionals, from the boardroom to the beat, tend to\n`index' the range of voices and viewpoints in both news and\neditorials according to the range of views expressed in main-\nstream government debate about a given topic\" (p 106).\nHerring and Robinson (2003) in their exhaustive review of\nthe media and agenda-setting literature argue that most\nscholars of media effects believe in some form of indexing\neven if they do not call it so.\nBut for those that are afraid that indexing would lead to\nWashington's ability to manufacture consent, the U.S. gov-\nernment does not speak with one voice. Warren Strobel\n(1997) notes that politicians sometimes use the media to\npush their preferred narrative at the expense of other offi-\ncials. When journalists discover a policy or communication\nvacuum within elite opinion they are free to report the\ndebate within Washington. The possibility for government\ncontrol is further dampened by the drive for journalistic\nethics, and the fact that it is as a profit-driven organization.\nWhen these two variables are combined, it creates an\nimperative to present viewers and readers with compelling\nnarratives (Bennett, 1990). Instead of relying on selling the\ngovernment policy, the media searches for stories with rich\ncharacters and a sellable plot. Bennett (1996) states that\n\"increasingly sensationalistic narratives and dramatic pro-\nduction values both bridge and reflect the tensions among\nthe various norms and practical rules that guide journalists\nBut some recent research has suggested that the media\ncan still be controlled. Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston\n(2007) discuss the Washington zeitgeist that often keeps the\nmedia in line. Journalists and government officials not only\nwork together, but travel in the same social circles, live in\nthe same neighborhoods, and attend the same schools.\nThese interlocking personal connections create a set of\nrules or expectations about what is acceptable to cover in\nthe media. To challenge those rules (like the official narra-\ntive) is to find yourself \"out of step with 95% of your col-\nrenegade journalists find themselves ostracized socially,\nbut challenging the status quo can also damage their rela-\ntionships with professional sources. Media outlets that pub-\nlish critical portrayals will find Washington's doors closed.\nAccess becomes a powerful carrot to media outlets and\nwithholding it a stick for the government to wield, manipu-\nlate, and manage the news.\nSecond, what happens to the indexing model when there\nis no dissent in Washington or no breakdown in the elite\nthat based on their study of the Bush Administration and its\nmanagement of the news, the press failed the American peo-\nple when it came to reporting the Iraq War and the abuses of\nthe Abu Ghraib prison. They argue that The Bush\nAdministration manipulated the Washington zeitgeist and\nthe weakness of the Democratic Party to the point that \"real-\nity could be bent to the will of power, and power was exer-\ncised by active news management\" (p. 163). Though Karl\nRove and the Bush White House may not have reached the\nstructural depths of \"manufacturing consent,\" Bennett et al.\npaint a disturbing picture.\nPart III: Contesting Frames of the\nSecond Congo War and Methodology\nBuilding on the existing literature Robert Entman (1993,\n2003) expands the indexing model by exploring the impor-\ntance of framing issues and elite discord in what he calls cas-\ncading activation. He argues this can provide a robust\nunderstanding of when the media deviates from the govern-\nment line. Entman notes that politicians are actively trying to\nframe issues. \"Framing entails selecting and highlighting\nsome facets of events or issues, and making connections\namong them so as to promote a particular interpretation,\nthe government does not have control over how issues get\nframed. It is in fact a game between various political and\nmedia actors across different levels of access points in a\ndecentralized political system and media structure. Scott\nAlthaus (2003) points out that \"when journalists have reason\nto believe the scope of conflict has extended to include non-\nofficial groups or ordinary citizens, they feel less obliged to\nfollow the index set by U.S. officials\" (p. 385). The narrative\nframe can run \"along a continuum from total dominance by\nthe government . . . to a completely evenhanded standoff\nbetween competing frames.\" To win the framing game,\nactors in the system need motivation, power, and strategy\n(deployed by the administration and other elites), and cul-\ntural congruence (the measure of cultural resonance and\nmagnitude of the issue) to establish the dominating frame\nSo what are the possible narratives or frames that the\nmedia can accept for the Second Congo War? Based on\nEntman's work, the first is how the Rwandans sell their par-\nticipation in the Congolese War to the world. For Kigali,\nmilitary action was necessary to end the cross-border raids\nand destroy a genocidal enemy hiding in the Congo. This\nframe is persuasive to an American audience. Because of\nthe 1994 genocide, the Tutsi-led government was seen as\nthe underdogs, and the Congolese war was a question of\njustice for an unspeakable crime. One State Department\nofficial even commented that Rwanda's situation was simi-\nlar to that of Israel and Palestine. State Department official\nLeonard Hawley argues,\nI don't know that we necessarily took sides with the Rwandans\nor not. But in light of the Hutu Interahamwe it was pretty clear\nthat had we needed to pick a side and Kagame was the right guy\nto pick. Once you do that you have to take some of the issues\nthat Kagame has on the table and because he was getting beat up\nall of the time by people who were crossing the border from the\nHowever, the pro-Rwandan frame was not the only one\navailable to the Western press. President Laurent Kabila\npresents a counter frame to the crisis based on the impor-\ntance of Congolese sovereignty. He argues that Rwanda and\nUganda illegally invaded his nation. The war was one of\naggression and not self defense. Kabila claimed that Kigali\nand Kampala were less concerned with border security than\n\"mass scale looting\" and the \"illegal exploitation of the min-\neral and forest resources of the Democratic Republic of the\nBut we can also present an alternate hypothesis that chal-\nlenges the prevalent model of indexing altogether. The\nSecond Congo War takes place after the collapse of com-\nmunism. Throughout most of the Cold War, the media\naccepted at face value the idea that communism was aggres-\nsive, internationally oriented, and monolithically led by\nMoscow. In the 1960s, Congolese conflicts like the Katangan\nsecession, the rise of Mobutu, and the removal and assassi-\nnation of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, as well as con-\nflicts in Angola, Ethiopia, and Mozambique were indexed to\nthe struggle against communism. The media was a compli-\nant partner in the dissemination of the government's policies\n[or frames] at home and abroad. Entman (2004) argues that\nthe collapse of communism weakened the \"journalists'habit\nof deference,\" and they became critical of President\nClinton's foreign policy (p. 107). The White House was no\nlonger able to dominate the framing debate as it once had\nduring the height of the Cold War. Not only were elites\ndivided about the priorities of the post\u00adCold War world but\nthe media were now free to produce their own counter nar-\nratives to events.\nOne could also hypothesize that coverage of third-world\nconflicts in the post\u00adCold War world are no longer indexed\nto Washington's strategic interests. Althaus argues that\nofficial indexing of government positions should be the\nexception not the rule in the post\u00adCold War paradigm. The\nCongolese conflict might be a good example where\n\"authoritative sources are largely silent and no govern-\nmental process is involved, the storytelling imperative can\nlate that the media might come up with its own story tell-\ning narrative. For example, instead of communism, the\nmedia could rely on the tropes of \"ancient tribal hatreds.\"\n6 SAGE Open\nSo, this article will also examine the use ethnicity and\nterms like Hutu and Tutsi in the reporting of the war. By\nlooking at the Second Congo War through these variables,\nwe should hopefully paint a picture how these newspapers\ncovered the story, where they differed, and where they\nmight in fact be similar.\nMethod\nTo test these competing frames, we need to examine and\ncode coverage of the Second Congo War in the pages of the\nNew York Times and the Washington Post to assess whether\nthe American press was biased against Laurent Kabila's\nframing. However, I have also included in this study the\nleading French dailies--Le Monde and Le Figaro--and the\nUnited Kingdom's The Guardian and London Times; also\nincluded in this study are the Guardian's sister Sunday (only)\npaper the Observer, and the Times sister paper, the Sunday\nTimes. For this study, I rolled the Observer into the data for\nthe Guardian and the Sunday Times into the regular Times.\nI have selected these six news papers because they are in\nsome form or another considered official \"newspapers of\nrecord\" for their respective nations. When it comes to report-\ning of American foreign policy and international events,\nthere is no other daily paper that can compete with the New\nYork Times and Washington Post. Hillel Nossek (2004)\nargues that foreign news in the United States is mediated by\na few gatekeepers. These two papers have the power to drive\nthe national media agenda in the way they choose to frame\nstories (Handley, 2008). The same gatekeeper status can be\nsaid for the press in every nation. The two newspapers of\nrecord in France are Le Monde and Le Figaro. However,\nFrench media operates differently from that of the United\nStates. First, both papers are truly national, whereas the\nTimes and Post are read nationally, but they are still the local\npapers for the New York and Washington metro areas.\nSecond, editorially, Le Monde is clearly a left of center news-\npaper and Le Figaro is conservative.2 This idea of being so\nopen about editorial bias is anathema in the United States. As\nfor the British newspapers, I chose what had been the histori-\ncally left wing Manchester Guardian (though it is no longer\nManchester) and the more conservative London Times. The\nUK Daily Telegraph is usually considered by more a \"paper\nof record,\" but the Guardian provides us with another right/\nleft perspective that may be interesting to examine. These\npapers are all certain to capture the elite opinion of their\nrespective nations.\nI then selected the articles from these papers using the\nLexis\u00adNexis databases. I examined the conflict from January\n1, 1998 (about 8 months before the outbreak of the war) until\nseveral days after Kabila's death--January 18, 2001. The rea-\nson I arbitrarily chose January 18th as the end date was a\nbelief that coverage toward Kabila would be qualitatively dif-\nferent after his assassination. I further narrowed the search by\nusing the words \"Congo\" and \"Kabila\" for all newspapers.\nThese key words are the same in French as well. If I was just\nto look up the word \"Congo,\" the search would capture\nCongo\u00adBrazzaville, or any other nonpolitical references.\nThese two words guaranteed that every story was about\nLaurent Kabila and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nAltogether, I found a population of 496 stories in theAmerican\npapers: 269 in the Times and 227 in the Washington Post. For\nthe six newspapers, there were 1,615 articles all together. I\nwill explore these numbers more in depth in the section on\nfindings. These stories and articles become my units of\nanalysis.\nWhen one examines the kind of articles and stories in the\nsurveyed population, it is important to note that 44% of the\nstories in the Washington Post were news briefs (the \"World\nIn Brief\" section), which provided short and basic synopses\nof daily global events. Only 37 articles in the New York Times\nwere in the equivalent \"World Briefings.\" Overall, the Times\nhad better-quality coverage of the conflict. Three main Times\njournalists (stationed in Africa as bureau chiefs) and the UN\nbeat writer accounted for 48% of the all stories found in the\npaper (Ian Fisher, Howard French, Norimitsu Onishi, and in\nNew York, Barbara Crossette). The two main African report-\ners for the Post were Lynne Duke, Karl Vick, and to a lesser\nextent James Rupert and Jon Jeter (7 stories apiece); together,\nthey accounted for 33% of all media coverage of the Congo.\nThese Post journalists combined with the \"World in Brief\"\nsection amounted to 77% of Washington Post coverage.\nEditorials only amounted to 6% of the entire sample: 14 in\nthe Times and 13 in the Post. These kinds of numbers are\nconsistent across nations.\nWhen it comes to the actual methodology of how to study\nthese articles, there are two methods. First, was the readings\nof articles and manual coding article by article. Though this\nprocess is time consuming, it guarantees that framing and\nbias is placed within the proper context. However, I also uti-\nlized the NVivo software program for content analysis as\nwell. The full text of each article was downloaded as a\nMicrosoft Word document into the NVivo program. This\nallowed me to search for key words, and examine word\ncounts quickly and efficiently, often within seconds.\nFurthermore, there is a higher rate of coding reliability to this\ndata. I utilize word counts as a measurement of how impor-\ntant key words are to each paper across time. The raw data\nyielded in such a search has some utility in measuring cover-\nage of foreign affairs. The more important the word or con-\ncept, person, or place, the more the word gets used. Thus, a\nword like \"Washington\" is used far more in the New York\nTimes than in Le Monde, a natural reflection of the priorities\nof the American newspaper.\nHowever, there are problems with this methodological\napproach. First, raw word counts do not necessarily give us\nan \"apples to apples\" examination across newspapers. So the\nNVivo program also allows the user to measure the \"percent-\nage of coverage,\" meaning the volume of data in each source\ncategorized by that particular word search. For example, take\nthe nation Angola, a crucial ally of Laurent Kabila. The New\nYork Times actually led all newspapers with 278 references,\nand London Times had 82. But with closer examination, we\ndiscover that the New York Times used the word Angola\nthough the NewYork paper was clearly the leader onAngolan\ncoverage--when the London Times did write about the\nCongo War, its coverage was focused more on Angola's role\nin the conflict than the Times. Though such a methodological\napproach is not perfect, it does allow a better \"apples to\napples\" look at the kind of coverage these papers gave to this\nevent.\nPart IV: Findings\nWhen it came to American, British, and French coverage of\nthe Second Congo War from January 1998 through January\n2001, one fact stands out: the French daily Le Monde led the\ncoverage with 641 articles. This is twice the coverage of the\nNew York Times, which came in second with 269, and the\nWashington Post third with 227, fourth was the Guardian\nBritish London Times with 106 stories over the 37-month\nperiod examined (see Figure 1 below). It is clear that the\nreaders of Le Monde were well versed in the conflict, but\nAmerican newspapers held their own in total coverage. Fears\nthat the American press ignores African conflicts are\nunfounded--at least when it came to the Congo.\nIf we disaggregate the data further, we find the newspa-\npers for the most part followed the same reporting trends (see\nFigure 2). In the first 7 months of 1998, the total stories for\njust that month alone, and 125 the following month. From\nAugust to December, the monthly average was 110, but\ncoverage soon slipped across the board. In 1999, the average\nmonthly stories dropped to 36.2, and fell even further in\nered: so, for example, in 2000, the average monthly total for\nLe Monde was 9 and the New York Times was 5. All papers\nhad the same rough valleys and peaks of coverage in the time\nperiod examined. The initial August invasion caused an\nimmediate media stir in the Western world, but it soon\ndissipated.\nCoverage of Rwanda and Uganda\nIf there should be one key difference between American and\nFrench newspaper coverage, it would be on the role Rwanda\nand Uganda played in the war. As mentioned, diplomatically,\nthe United States was sympathetic to outright supportive of\nthe Rwandan and Ugandan invasions. However, can we find\nevidence of this inAmericans newspapers? Did theAmerican\npress index their coverage to policies set in Washington?\nWould French newspapers, index their stories to Paris?\nTo answer this question, I discovered that the manual cod-\ning of these articles and stories proved difficult. My initial\nround of coding found that out of the American population\nsampled (n = 496): 2% of the reporting would be considered\npro-Kabila, 8% anti-Kabila, 2% might be characterized as\npro-Rwanda, 0.007% was specifically anti-Ugandan, and the\noverwhelming majority (87%) would best be seen as a ver-\nsion of journalistic neutrality. Simply put, the American\npress did not use a \"Rwandan frame.\" If anything, the press\nemphasized a storytelling narrative of how the Congo War\nunfolded. In the second round of coding, I used the NVivo\nprogram to analyze the differences between the press in dif-\nferent nations.\nWhen it came to overall coverage of Rwanda, the\nAmerican newspapers devoted more space. The Post had\n0.61% of its coverage dedicated and the New York Times had\nLe Monde New York\nTimes\nWashington\nPost\nThe\nGuardian\nLe Figaro London\nTimes\nFigure 1. Coverage of the second Congo war, January 1998 to\nThe New York Times\nThe Washington Post\nLe Figaro\nLe Monde\nGuardian/Observer\nThe Times (London)/\nSunday\nFigure 2. Month-to-month coverage, January 1998 to January\n8 SAGE Open\nAmerican numbers show that Rwanda was mentioned con-\nsistently more than in any other national coverage of the\nCongo War. However, those numbers do not hold up when\nwe look at the data more deeply (see Table 1). For example,\nwe find that mentions of Paul Kagame, the future President\nof Rwanda, and the real force behind the invasion was men-\ntioned 62 times in the Washington Post, and considering how\nmany articles the French newspaper had about the war only\n60 times in Le Monde. In fact, the Post led all newspapers\nwith coverage of Kagame with 0.05%, but the French daily\nLe Figaro was second with 0.03%. If you prefer mentions of\nthe Rwandan capital city of Kigali (and thus capture more of\nthe diplomatic side of the story) to be a better proxy, then we\nfind Le Monde leads coverage with 0.14%, Le Figaro sec-\nond, and the Post third. Clearly, when Le Monde did cover\nRwanda, their reporting was substantively more in depth\nthan the New York Times.\nWhen it comes to overall coverage of Uganda (see Table 2\nbelow), once again anAmerican newspaper led coverage: The\nOnce again, French news coverage were slightly lower with\nsomething interesting happens when we disaggregate the data\nfurther: we find that mention of Ugandan President Museveni\nis almost identical in five newspapers at 0.06/0.07%, but Le\nMonde is slightly higher at 0.09%. Also mention of Kampala,\nthe capital city is highest in the London Times and Le Monde,\nbut not significant in the other papers. The U.S. papers may\nhave had more coverage of Uganda overall but once again Le\nMonde, had more specific coverage.\nConsidering the bias of American official policy it is dif-\nficult to say, based on these numbers, that the press was sub-\nstantially different across nations. However, if you wanted to\ncompare American newspapers with those of the French, you\nwill see that the New York Times and the Washington Post has\na slight bias toward reporting on Rwanda and Uganda than\nLe Monde. However, in both cases it is clear that Le Monde\nmay have had deeper coverage of the diplomacy if we use the\ncapital cities as proxies.\nGenocides, Massacres, and the Ethnicity\nBut if we really wanted to spot a Rwandan frame inAmerican\nreporting, one should find it in the coverage of the gross\nhuman rights abuses that occurred during the Congolese\nwars. As noted, many of these massacres were blamed on\nLaurent Kabila. However, as a 2010 Christian Science\nMonitor headline announced, \"Bombshell UN report leaked:\n`Crimes of genocide' against Hutus in Congo\" was actually\nconducted by the Rwandan Army (Stearns). The Rwandan\nArmy coordinated the killings but Kabila got the blame. The\nUN Mapping Report stated that over 600 separate acts of\nviolence, some reaching genocidal proportions were com-\nmitted over a 10-year time span. Some of this happened dur-\ning the First Congo War, but massacres and violence\ncontinued into the Second, which is our time frame exam-\nined. If U.S. policy was \"pro-Rwandan,\" we should see sig-\nnificant differences in how the American and French\nnewspapers treated the issue. Indexing would hold that\nAmerican coverage of Rwanda would be positive compared\nwith that of the French newspapers, and critical of Kabila.\nDuring the time Laurent Kabila was stonewalling the UN\nexamination of his human rights record, about 6% of the New\nYork Times and Washington Post coverage reflected that.\nFrench reporting of the \"investigation\" was minor (holding\nthat other words could be used). There was no wider substan-\ntive Western narrative of a \"counter genocide committed by\nthe Rwandans in any of the papers examined.\" If we specifi-\ncally look at the word \"genocide,\" it is mentioned only in the\ncontext of the 1994 genocide inside Rwanda and never to the\ncurrent events (see Table 3 below). This linkage of the\nRwandan genocide with the Congolese coverage was consis-\ntent across newspapers and nations. So for example, The\nGuardian led coverage with 0.16% mentions, the London\nNew York Times and Le Figaro are tied with 0.06%. Le\nMonde used two spellings: genocide (0.04%) and g\u00e9nocide\n(0.07%), both of which are included here. Overall, about 1/4\n(24%) of the entire American media coverage of the Congo\nwas actually related to the 1994 genocide.\nHowever, I also searched for the word \"massacres\" as a\nproxy for genocide (which is a politically loaded term) to\nTable 1. Mention of Rwanda in Congo, January 1998 to January\nRwanda Kagame Kigali\nNote. Word count/Percentage used in stories.\nTable 2. Mention of Uganda in the Congo, January 1998 to\nUganda Kampala\nNote. Overall word count/Percentage of word coverage.\npossibly describe the killings. Here, we find Le Monde with\nThere really is no significant difference. I also explored the\nphrase, \"human rights abuses\" (in French as well), and this\nyields some interesting results in a trans-national study.\nAmerican newspapers use the term more consistently, the\nPost has 0.28%, and the Times 0.25%, and that is definitively\nmore than Le Monde, which is only at 0.15%, and Figaro\nwith 0.06%. Of course, it is possible that the phrase is more\ncommon in the United States than in France. The British\nnewspapers did not significantly use the term.\nWhen it came to human rights atrocities, it would seem\nthat the overall tone and content of reporting was similar\nacross newspapers. Rwanda's role in committing a counter\ngenocide was obscured, watered down, or lost among the\nnarrative of a war. However, this narrative of brutality\nbecomes problematic in trying to understand reporting on\nforeign conflicts. The Congo War was a brutal, complicated\nand messy war. Under these circumstances it was difficult for\nthe press to assess blame for the violence as it was happening\nin the \"moment\" with incomplete information. Thus, based\non the evidence, I would suggest that American elite cover-\nage of the Congo conflict, in regard to the Rwandan counter\ngenocide was not implicitly tied to indexing of government\npolicy toward Kabila.\nWhat might explain this? A possible framing hypothesis\ncould be the fact that a Western audience a priori expects\nAfrican conflicts to be brutal. This creates the media slant\ntoward giving people what they want: the reporting of mob\nviolence, rape camps, and slaughtering of villagers\u00adwhich\nare factual enough, neutral even. But what is missing in\nmuch of the Western media is the cohesive contextual frame-\nwork on why the mass violence was occurring in the first\nplace and how that context was needed to end it.\nThe only context provided was that of the Rwandan geno-\ncide, this is not necessarily biased, wrong, or misleading.\nThe Interahamwe weighed heavily into Rwandan strategic\ncalculations. The conflict between Hutus and Tutsi was a\ndriving force in the shifting loyalties of the Congolese actors\ninvolved. In the Second Congo War, the Hutu were Kabila's\nallies, but in the First War, they were his enemies. But the\nfocus on Rwanda and African ethnicity has its own set of\nproblems. Steven Livingstone and Todd Eachus (1999) point\nout in their work on the Rwanda genocide that the media\naccepted and advanced the framework of \"ancient tribal\nhatreds\" while the atrocities of the Serbs in Bosnia were\ncompared with 20th century Nazi Germany. Gary Streiker of\nCNN noted, \"this story is probably the worst tribal hostility\nin all of Africa . . . hostility that goes back centuries long\nHow did the Western press understand ethnicity in the\nCongo? The answer revolved around Rwanda. The\nWashington Post led newspapers with the use of the word\n(ethnic) at 0.22%, and Le Figaro the least at 0.04%. The New\nYork Times was 0.11% and grouped near The Times and Le\nMonde (0.07%). So it is interesting to note that the Post used\nthe word twice as much as the New York Times. But I also\ndisaggregated the data further and looked at the words Hutu\nand Tutsi. Not only are there Hutus and Tutsi in Rwanda, but\nin neighboring Burundi and inside the Congo. In fact, the\nCongolese Tutsi (Banyamulenge) were part of a long-term\nCongolese discussion of whether they were \"Congolese\" or\nRwandans, and violence toward them predates, sometimes\ntrumps, and sometimes works in conjunction with the 1994\ngenocide.\nWhen \"Hutu\" and \"Tutsi\" were examined (see Table 4),\nwe found that The New York Times led coverage of the word\nLondon Times led with Tutsi with 0.31%. In fact, the London\nTimes (in conjunction with the word genocide) spent consid-\nerable coverage discussing the 1994 Rwandan genocide as\nthe context to the war. But the Guardian had the least men-\ntions of Tutsi with 0.13%. The British newspapers had the\nfewest mentions of Hutu and Tutsi overall--but significant\ndifferences between the two with how they reported the\nTutsi. The data also revealed something else: In every\ninstance, Tutsi was used more than Hutu with one caveat, Le\nMonde and Le Figaro had the words almost at parity (+.01\ndifference) and the New York Times (+.03 difference), the\nand the outlier was the Times of London, which had a +0.18%\nsignificant difference. Part of Tutsi dominance might have to\ndo with the Banyamulenge (The Tutsi of the Congolese\nTable 3. Mention of Genocide and Massacres in Congo, January\nGenocide Massacres\nNote. Overall word count/Percentage of word coverage.\nTable 4. Coverage of Hutu and Tutsi in Congo Crisis.\nHutu Tutsi\nNote. Overall word count/Percentage of word coverage.\nKivu), which on their own never accounted for more than\n0.01% of coverage. If we look at the actual word count, we\nfind Le Monde leading with 33 mentions of this group over\nthe 37-month period; the Guardian second with 21; the\nWashington Post 17 and New York Times 14, and Le Figaro\n7. But when dealing with numbers so small, there were no\nreal differences in the reporting.\nBut the focus on the 1994 genocide also blinds or obscures\ncoverage of modern events NPR had an interesting exchange\nwith scholar Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja about the modern\nelements of genocide. Nzongola-Ntalaja argued that\nethnic groups do have prejudices . . . But it's not enough to make\na person pick up a knife or gun and kill somebody else. That\noccurs when politicians come and excite passion and try to\nthreaten people-make people believe that they are being\nthreatened by other groups that are going to be extinguished.\nNPR's Daniel Zwerdling responded, \"Of course, in most\nof these battlegrounds . . . there is ancient ethnic hatred and\nsomething that surprises me actually is that your blaming\nmodern, contemporary African politicians for this divide and\nconquer, playing one tribe against another.\" Zwerdling\nseemed surprised that Nzongola-Ntalaja could put this event\ninto such an understandable and modern light (All Things\nConsidered, 1994). But Nzongola-Ntalaja logic of modern\npolitics brings up an interesting question: What did Rwanda\ndo once it got inside the Congo?\nThe War of Diamonds and Raw Materials\nIf the focus of the war was Rwanda and Uganda's external\nsecurity Laurent Kabila argued that it was really a question of\nCongolese internal sovereignty and control over its natural\nresources. The Congo is rich in gold, diamonds, coltan, cas-\nsiterite, copper, cobalt, wolfram, zinc, oil, as well as timber,\ncoffee, and palm oil (Amnesty International, 2003). The\nfighting eventually revolved around the control of these\nresources and not the rebel factions. The UN Panel of Experts\n(UN, 2002) was clear: Rwanda and Uganda (and everyone\nelse for that matter) was vigorously participating in a cam-\npaign of enrichment. Eventually, Rwanda and Uganda turned\non each other to fight over diamonds. The UN added that\nthere were concerns \"about gross human rights abuses that\nare linked with the extraction of these commodities.\" In the\nend, the war in the Congo was more about money than border\nsecurity. In fact, the idea that someAfrican leaders are corrupt\nand use the apparatus of the state to enrich themselves is nei-\nther shocking nor new. The reality of the Second Congo War\nis how the process of globalization has changed the game of\nexploitation. Sovereign leaders, foreign nations, and rebels\ncould enrich themselves in this new world, not by seizing the\ncapital city (which will still occur) but the diamond fields.\nBut if economic motivations were central to the conflict\nwhy was it only a major theme in 2% of the articles in the\nNew York Times and Washington Post. Overall, the economic\ndimensions of the war were featured in 53 articles (or 12%),\nstill insignificant to the larger backdrop of coverage.\nRemember the Rwandan genocide was mentioned in 24% of\nthe stories. I then examined the American Press for who was\nresponsible for the exploitation. When we break down those\n53 articles we noticed an interesting trend: the corruption of\nKabila and his allies Angola, and Zimbabwe accounted for\n51%. About 13% were neutral or vague about the actors\ninvolved in the exploitation (everyone was blamed). The cor-\nruption of the rebel groups fighting Kabila (and backed by\nRwanda and Uganda) made up 8% of the population.\nKampala and Kigali made up 28%; most of it occurring when\nthey turned on each other over diamonds in June 2000. When\nyou place the coverage of Rwanda and Uganda in the wider\ncontext of all 496 stories or articles surveyed it is only 3% of\nthe entire population.\nAs in the case of human rights violations there should be\na difference of reporting between the American and French\nnewspapers. If the American papers were biased would they\ncover the stories of looted diamonds? If we take the word\n\"diamond,\" the New York Times led coverage with 0.10%,\nand the London Times came in second with 0.09% (see Table\n5 below). The two French newspapers were tied with 0.04%.\nStrangely enough, the Washington Post did not spend any\nsignificant time with the word. During the period examined,\nthere were only 18 total references in the Post, the New York\nBut what if we expand the list beyond diamonds? I then\nsearched for a basket of items, \"gold, diamonds, coltan, cas-\nsiterite, copper, cobalt, wolfram, zinc, oil, timber, coffee and\npalm oil\" (including French translations). Once again the\nnewspapers were quite similar across nations (see Figure 3\nbelow). In the 1st year of the war, Le Monde led coverage\nwith 0.09% and 67 distinct references to these words. The\nNew York Times, had 73 coming out to 0.07% of its coverage,\nLe Figaro and Washington Post were 0.02%. Over 3 years, Le\nwhich is really not much of a difference. When we examined\nthe rest of the list: The Washington Post had 131, the Guardian\nis a significant difference between Le Monde and Le Figaro.)\nTable 5. Coverage of Diamonds in the Congo, January 1998 to\nDiamond Diamonds\nNote. Overall word count/Percentage of word coverage.\nHonestly, considering the leftist slant of Le Monde and the\nGuardian, I was surprised that there was not more coverage\nof economic exploitation. Economic incentive to war was\ncovered minimally in all papers. However, there was no sig-\nnificant difference between nations when it came to report-\ning. But if the lack of economic exploitation coverage was\nnot intentional, then what best explains the findings? W.\nLance Bennett et al. (2007) provide a possible answer.\nNation-state and Sub-state economic exploitation is not in\nthe zeitgeist or the underlying normative assumptions of\nwhat is a compelling story, not just in the United States but\nWestern Europe as well. Instead, the overriding \"conflict\nnarrative\" of two sides fighting for political power is.\nPart V: Theoretical Implications and\nConclusions\nThroughout this paper, we have used the Second Congo War\nas a case study to examine whether the elite press indexes its\ncoverage of foreign events to government policy. The Congo\nWar is a good test case for several reasons. First, it was one\nof the largest conflicts in the world during the late 1990s. But\nto the American public, it was an unknown war in a distant\npart of the world with no national interests at stake. But\nWashington did have a clear agenda for the Congo, and\nthroughout the conflict they passively supported Rwanda\nand Uganda and its claims of border security. One could\nargue that to support a new ally in the region (Clinton's New\nAfrican Leaders Initiative) the Administration may have\nturned a blind eye to gross human rights abuses and eco-\nnomic exploitation committed by its favored states. Clearly,\nwith a set American policy and no public interest, this would\nbe an excellent example of media indexing.\nHowever, I argue that the two major American newspa-\npers did not index their coverage. Furthermore, and this is\nimportant, I argue that other leading dailies in Britain and\nFrance did not index their coverage to their own governmen-\ntal policies as well. Coverage of the Second Congo War in\nthe Western world was remarkably more similar than it was\ndifferent. But we should add a word of caution about our\nfindings--correlation is not causation. There are limits to\nthis kind of media analysis.\nThis paper also raises other questions that are still worth\nexamining and some hark back to Bennett's zeitgeist. For\none, what is neutrality in reporting a war? For example, if\nan article truthfully notes the attempts of Laurent Kabila to\nstifle democracy and his rampant corruption--is this neu-\ntral or biased? Should the newspaper be obliged to provide\nmore context about Congolese history, the troubles of creat-\ning a viable nation state in the wreck of what had been the\npersonal fiefdom of President Mobutu? Second, when the\npapers featured longer detailed articles, Kabila's framing of\nthe war as an invasion and a loss Congolese sovereignty\nwas usually balanced with Rwanda's frame of the genocidal\nInterahamwe and its need for national security. Should it\nhave been balanced in the first place? To some, the very\nidea that Rwanda, Uganda, and their rebel movement were\ngiven equal and nonjudgmental coverage to compete with\nKabila's claims of a foreign invasion might seem like bias\nenough.\nIf there was a bias, it was clear to Western audiences that\nthe Second Congo War was fought in the shadow of the 1994\nRwandan genocide (especially The London Times). By fram-\ning, the Congo around the genocide does two things: First, it\nmakes the Western audience automatically sympathetic to\nRwanda's claims of border security. The idea that the Congo\nwas hiding, known perpetuators of genocide shuts down the\nconversation about Rwanda looting the Congolese country-\nside. To go back to an Israeli analogy--the capture of Adolf\nEichmann in Argentina was not a discussion of international\nlaw on kidnapping foreign nationals--it is a story of the cap-\nture of the man who helped plan the Holocaust receive jus-\ntice. Second, and indirectly, it reinforces the narrative of\nancient tribal hatred and makes the Second Congo War about\nethnicity. It would reinforce the work of Steven Livingstone\nand Todd Eachus (1999). The genocide frame stops critical\nthinking about the causes of the war because for average\nAmericans, the violence is ancient; there is nothing that can\nbe done. However, it does not provide the readership with\nimportant context. Tribal hatred is fanned on by modern\nproblems not ancient ones.\nSecond is the Western bias of reporting conflicts and war.\nThe overwhelming reporting from all six newspapers was\nthe narrative of battles, massacres, and diplomacy.Traditional\nreporting of conflict resembles a version of capture the flag.\nThe focus is always on the elites. This \"Washington\nConsensus\" is the zeitgeist that holds political and media\nelite together. Althaus, Edy, Entman, and Phalen (1996)\nargue, \"When there is no policy debate in Washington,\nreporters offer critical analysis inside the terms of the\nWashington consensus.\" Western interlopers of a conflict,\nincluding the media coverage confer legitimacy to actors\nwho control land and access to natural resources. Simply,\nLe Monde New York\nTimes\nWashington\nPost\nGuardian Le Figaro London\nTimes\nFigure 3. Basket list of natural resources.\nreporters and editors prioritize power at the expense of a\nbroader discussion of democracy and in this case Congolese\ncivil society.\nFinally is the zeitgeist of economic exploitation. While the\nlooting of Congolese resources were reported in the Western\npress, it was not a major theme of reporting. Yet, the looting is\nwhat probably prolonged the conflict. The opening up of the\nAfrican economy to the free markets has in some places priva-\ntized profits but socialized the violence. When the Cold War\nended the aid stopped. The African leaders who traditionally\nused external security aid in complex internal patronage sys-\ntems were now forced to scramble and innovate. Trade not\nonly flourished in resource extraction, but in illicit drugs,\nmoney laundering, and diamonds. Wars had little to do with\npolitical ideologies, but the control over the nation's natural\nresources.\nIn the end, I argue that the media must broaden its concep-\ntual framework of how it reports African conflicts. We have\nnoted that the war was not necessarily indexed to policy.\nSometimes the press might rely on older more familiar tropes,\nso in the Congo we see the obsession with genocide. However,\nthe media is still ill equipped to explain these new kinds of\nconflicts because they do not have the proper vocabulary in\ntheir rhetorical toolkits. Paraphrasing the words of Bennett,\nsub-state economic exploitation is not in the underlying nor-\nmative assumptions of what is a compelling story. Instead, the\noverriding conflict narrative of two sides fighting for political\npower is. While that may be neutral, in a sense, the selection of\nreporting the actions of elite actors at the expense of civil soci-\nety is the bias, and this is what connects all Western papers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. There are several theories about who was behind the assas-\nsination. Many felt that the Rwandans and Ugandans were\nbehind it. Others suggest that Kabila may have been shot with\nAngolan (one of his allies) complicity.\n2.
