Research indicates that\nthe risks of health problems for adults associated with being\nOW are increasing in BMI (or in other words, someone who\nis 50% OW faces greater health risks than someone who is\n10% OW).10\u00ad12 For example, the risk of heart failure increases\n5% in adult men and 7% in adult women with a unit\n*Correspondence: Professor D Jolliffe, Economic Research Service, US\nE-mail: Jolliffe@ers.usda.gov\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nincrease in BMI.11 Similarly, a one-unit increase in BMI is\nassociated with a 6% increase in the relative risks of total,\nischemic and hemorrhagic stroke for men.12 As prevalence\nindices censor all information about the distribution of BMI,\nexcept whether it is above or below the OW cutoff, they\nmask important information about the extent of the health\nproblem. While research has not directly shown that health\nrisks are also increasing in BMI for children and adolescents,\nthis paper assumes that the evidence for adults warrants\nconcern about the BMI distribution of overweight children.\nThe purpose of this paper is to describe a measure of OW\nthat provides information on both the prevalence and\nextent (the extent to which BMI exceeds the OW threshold)\nof child OW. This measure can help to establish whether\nthe prevalence of child OW sufficiently describes the\nhealth problem or if there is more to be learned from a\nmeasure that is sensitive to changes in the BMI distribution\nof the OW.\nMethods\nThe data used in this paper are from four rounds of the\nNHANES, which is conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. The NHANES samples are representative of the\nUS civilian, noninstitutionalized population, and observa-\ntions were selected following a stratified, multistage design.\nMeasures of child overweight are estimated at four points in\nNHANES). Anthropometric measures were obtained by\ntrained health technicians, and effective sample sizes of\nchildren and adolescents between 2 and 19 y of age range\nTo measure the extent of child OW, this paper considers\nthe following index:\nEOW \u00bc \u00f01=n\u00de\nX\ni\n! fi\n\u00c0 fi\n\u00de=fi\nwhere n is the sample size, i subscripts the child, f is the\ncutoff point identifying who is overweight and I is an\nindicator function that takes a value of 1 if the statement is\ntrue and 0 otherwise. More specifically, the indicator\nfunction will take a value of 1 if the child is OW and 0 if\nthe child's BMI is less than the 95th percentile of the sex-\nspecific BMI for age growth charts. This paper also examines\nchildren and adolescents who are at risk of being OW, in\nwhich case the 85th percentile is used as the threshold value\nfor fi\n.\nI refer to the term in square brackets, [(BMIi\n-fi\n)/fi\n], as the\nproportionate OW gap because it measures the amount by\nwhich each OW child's BMI exceeds their OW threshold, and\nthis amount is expressed as a proportion of the threshold.\nExamination of this term reveals that EOW treats BMI as a\ncontinuous variable for the OW population. It embeds the\nassumption that public health worsens as average BMI\nincreases in the OW population. This is in contrast to the\nprevalence measure which views OW as a dichotomous\noutcome, and is not sensitive to the extent to which the\nEOW exceeds their threshold. Expressing excess BMI as a\nproportion of the OW threshold is particularly important for\nchildren since the threshold varies by age and sex. The\nresulting measure, EOW, is the sum of the proportionate OW\ngaps divided by the sample size, or the sample average value\nof the proportionate OW gaps. (In the case where BMI is less\nthan the threshold, the indicator function is 0, and so too is\nthe product of the two terms.)\nTo illustrate this measure, consider, for example, an 8-y-\nold boy with a BMI of 22. His OW threshold is approximately\n20, and his proportionate OW gap is 10%. Consider now\nanother boy with a BMI of 22, but this one is 9 y old instead\nof 8. This older boy has an OW threshold of about 21 and his\nproportionate OW gap would be just under 5%. An\nexamination of the prevalence of child OW would register\nboth of these boys as OW, and both would contribute equally\nto the prevalence measure. In contrast, the EOW measure\ncaptures the fact that the 8-y-old boy is more OW than the 9-\ny-old boy, and thereby provides a measure of the extent of\nthe OW problem. The EOW measure will increase when the\nprevalence of OW increases, but unlike the prevalence\nmeasure, it will also increase when those OW becomes\nheavier on average.\nThe usefulness of this measure can further be illustrated by\nconsidering an OW person who gains weight. This weight\ngain has no effect on the OW prevalence, but the health of\nthis person has changed and this change is reflected through\nan increase in EOW. In terms of describing the magnitude of\nthe public-health problem and in shaping public-health\npolicy, EOW provides important information. For example,\nconsider a hypothetical health policy that focused on\nhelping the extremely OW lose weight. If successful, this\npolicy would result in an improvement in public health,\nwhich would be indicated by a lowering of EOW, but there\nmight very well be no change in the prevalence measure.\nThe average extent of OW for the entire population, EOW,\nwhen combined with information about the prevalence of\nOW, additionally provides insight into the extent of OW for\nthe OW population. The interpretation of the ratio of EOW\nto prevalence can be seen by noting that the EOW measure is\nthe sample sum of the proportionate OW gaps divided by the\nentire sample size, n. The OW prevalence measure can be\nexpressed as the number of OW in the sample, say nj\n, divided\nby the sample size n. Dividing EOW by the OW prevalence\nresults in the sum of the proportionate OW gaps divided by\nnj\n, the sample size of those who are OW. This ratio is then the\naverage proportionate amount by which the OW exceed\ntheir BMI threshold.\nFor example, if this ratio is equal to 0.15 this means that,\non average, the OW are 15% percent in excess of their\nthresholds. Increases in this measure indicate that the OW\nare becoming increasingly OW on average. As a measure of\nthe public-health problem though (and in contrast to EOW),\nExtent of overweight among US children\nD Jolliffe\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nthis measure has the undesirable characteristic that it is not\nmonotonically increasing in BMI. For example, if a child's\nBMI increases and moves from being classified as not OW to\nOW, then EOW will increase. The average amount by which\nthe OW exceed their threshold may actually decline though,\nbecause this new OW child will likely bring down the\naverage value of excess BMI of the OW. Nonetheless, when\ncombined with information about the prevalence and extent\nof OW, this ratio readily conveys important information\nabout the BMI distribution of the OW population. It is useful\nto note that an alternative method of treating BMI as a\ncontinuous variable would be to plot out and compare shifts\nin the BMI distribution over time. A comparison of NHANES\nII and NHANES III illustrates that indeed the entire BMI\ndistribution appears to be shifted to the right between 1976\nResults\nTables 1\u00ad4 provide weighted estimates of EOW, the OW\nprevalence, and the ratio of these two measures. The sample\nweights reflect the unequal probability of selection resulting\nfrom the sample design (including corrections for over-\nsampling) and also correct for nonresponse.

At risk of OW is defined as having a BMI at or\nabove the 85th percentile of the sex-specific BMI for age\ngrowth charts. The estimates are age-standardized by the\ndirect method to the 2000 population estimates to adjust for\nthe changing distribution of age over the decades. The\npatterns of change for OW and at risk of OW are similar.\nDuring the 1970s there was little change, with the OW\nprevalence around 5% and the at-risk-of-OW prevalence at\ncents were OW and 28.4% were at risk of being OW.\nWhile this significant increase in both prevalence mea-\nsures is alarming, the increase in the extent of OW was larger.\nincreased by 182% while the extent of OW increased by\n247%. The increasing extent of OW has resulted both\nfrom the increasing prevalence and also from noting\nwere 14% in excess of their thresholds. The increasing\nextent of OW indicates that the health risks associated\nwith excess adipose are likely even greater than that\nindicated by the increased prevalence rates. More children\nare becoming OW, and these OW children are getting\nheavier on average.\nThe same phenomenon is occurring with at risk of OW.\nThe extent of this measure increased at more than twice the\npace of the increase in the prevalence rate. Again, this result\nis driven by both the increasing at-risk-of-OW prevalence\nand a mean shift in the BMI distribution of the at-risk\nbeing OW were on average 12% over their at-risk thresholds\n(85th percentiles of the sex-specific BMI for age growth\n18% in excess of their thresholds.
