In it they\nargued that reproductive success should be enhanced in parents who could\nmanipulate the sex of their offspring according to their condition. Noting that a\nmale's reproductive success may potentially vary far more widely than a female's,\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nTrivers and Willard argued that it would therefore pay females in \"good\ncondition\" to produce male offspring and conversely, females in \"poor condition\",\nfemale offspring. Providing that good condition was transferred to the offspring,\nand providing that such good condition was sustained into adulthood, a female\nwho could bias the sex ratio would be more reproductively successful than a\nfemale who could not. The condition of females thus became a key factor in\nattempts to explain variations in the sex ratio of the offspring they produced.\nDoubts were expressed about the plausibility of this hypothesis shortly after\npublication. For example Myers (1978) showed through computerized\nmathematical modeling that the hypothesis did not, and could not, hold for all\ncircumstances. Nevertheless the Trivers and Willard hypothesis has provided the\ntheoretical framework for almost all studies of the sex ratio in the last thirty years.\nIt is only recently that sustained criticisms of it have been published.\nFor example, Leimar (1996), examining lifetime reproductive success, showed\nthat in some circumstances, \"high quality\" females can have higher reproductive\nvalue than high quality males, in direct contrast to the Trivers and Willard\nprediction. Five years later, in a thorough investigation of the primate literature\non sex ratios Brown (2001) found \"a lack of correlation between maternal\ncondition, birth sex ratios and maternal care\". Then Brown and Silk (2002)\nreported on a meta-analysis of all primate studies of the sex ratio which, largely\nbecause of conflicting results, found no overall difference in the sex ratio of\noffspring of high and low status mothers.\nIn studies of humans, it could be suggested that one reason for inconsistent\nresults is that there is little consensus on what constitutes \"parental investment\".\nFor example, Keller et al (2001) found no support for the suggestion that higher\nstatus parents would invest more in their sons, and lower status parents more in\ntheir daughters. But their measure of parental investment consisted of \"time\ndiaries\" and \"self-report data\", whereas, in contrast, Koziel and Ulijaszek (2001)\nfound limited support for the Trivers and Willard hypothesis using \"first birth\ninterval and extent of breastfeeding\" as their measures of parental investment.\nIn an attempt to resolve the problems, Bercovitch (2002) described three\npossible models in which parental investment might be related to sex-biases in\nprimate offspring, but came to the conclusion that testing the models would be\nvery difficult, and that, in any event, no single model would be likely to apply to\nall primates. West and Sheldon (2002) however argued that parents \"should\"\nadjust the sex of their offspring according to conditions in the environment and\nfurther that \"parental ability to predict their offsprings' environment influences\nthe evolution of sex ratio patterns across taxa\". Thus on the one hand, there has\nbeen an increase in the number of authors describing difficulties in sustaining the\nTrivers and Willard hypothesis; yet on the other, further evidence from a large\nvariety of species, that manipulation of the sex ratio by parents seems to be a\nfundamental part of successful reproductive strategies.\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nThe problem\nIn illustrating their original hypothesis Trivers and Willard used a population\nof caribou as an example. A male caribou in good condition would \"tend to\nexclude other males from breeding, thereby inseminating many more females\nthemselves, while females in good condition, through their greater ability to\ninvest in their young, [would] show only a moderate increase in reproductive\nsuccess\" (Trivers and Willard, 1973). Even a small advantage in a male's\ncondition could make a very large difference to his reproductive success. Thus,\n\"females in better condition tend to invest in males. Adverse environmental\nconditions for the mother during pregnancy are correlated with a reduced sex ratio\nat birth in deer and humans\" (Trivers and Willard, 1973).\nThe prediction that \"adverse environmental conditions\" would give rise to\nmore female offspring \"in deer and in humans\" ran directly counter to the\naccepted tradition in sex ratio studies in both species. In humans it ran up against\nthe now fully supported, uncontroversial finding of raised sex ratios during and\nimmediately following war (McMahon and Pugh, 1954). In deer it ran into\nconflict both with reports from nineteenth century breeding trials, and\ncontemporary wildlife experiments. In one, a longitudinal, controlled cross-over\nfield trial, deer had more male offspring if they were in poor condition (Verme,\nHowever, more recent reports appeared to confirm the Trivers and Willard\nhypothesis. In one, a naturalistic longitudinal study conducted on the Island of\nRhum, deer had more male offspring if they were in good condition (Clutton-\nBrock et al, 1984). In another, it was shown that high status humans, presumed to\nbe in good condition, had an excess of sons (Teitelbaum and Mantel, 1971).\nBoth studies appeared to confirm the Trivers and Willard hypothesis. All the\nstudies were methodologically sound, and their conflicting results invited closer\nsuggesting an adaptive advantage in male-biased sex ratios in adverse\nenvironments, but neither of these precipitated a discussion of the anomalies.\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis suggests a resolution for the apparently\nconflicting results, namely that the association between dominance and good\ncondition, although clearly legitimate in many circumstances, is likely to be a\nspurious one from the point of view of sex ratio adjustment. Although dominance\nmay lead to good condition in most settings, its key attribute vis-\u00e0-vis sex ratio\nadjustment is that it is underpinned by testosterone, and it is this which effects the\nsex ratio, not condition, good or otherwise. Therefore, although both hypotheses\npredict the same (dominant animals have male-biased sex ratios) in normal (i.e.\nnon-stressful) conditions, they do not predict the same for adverse conditions.\nAs West et al (2002) have pointed out, the problem of sex determination in\nvertebrates (and certainly in mammals) is more likely to be solved by further\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\ninvestigation of the way in which \"individuals facultatively adjust their offspring\nsex ratios in response to environmental conditions (rather than population sex\nratios)\". As they note, \"birds consistently adjust their offspring sex ratios in the\ndirection predicted by theory\", providing \"strong evidence that even in\nvertebrates, CSD (chromosomal sex determination) is not an all-powerful\nconstraint that prevents adaptive sex ratio manipulation\" (West et al, 2002).\nHaving shown that sex ratio adjustment appears very strongly in some organisms\n(for example ants, bees and wasps) and quite strongly in others (for example\nbirds) these authors are primarily concerned with the question why there appear to\nbe such wide differences across the taxa in the overall amount of sex ratio\nadjustment. This puzzle particularly applies to those species with chromosomal\nsex determination, where any form of adaptive sex ratio variation has proved hard\nto demonstrate. The results of studies on variations in the secondary sex ratio in\nmammals (many of which have cited the Trivers and Willard hypothesis as the\ntheoretical context) have been inconsistent to the point that some authors have\nsaid that reports of statistically significant findings were nothing but the result of\nsampling error (Small and Smith, 1985). However the maternal dominance\nhypothesis provides a way of reconciling these alleged inconsistencies, mainly by\npostulating a hypothetical mechanism by which the mammalian mother could\neither predetermine, or at least partially control the sex of her offspring.\nIn the absence of knowledge of a proximate mechanism of sex determination\n(other than chance) a test of the competing hypotheses (Trivers and Willard\nversus the maternal dominance hypothesis) occurs in the context of adverse\nenvironmental conditions. In the presence of such adverse conditions, the Trivers\nand Willard hypothesis predicts female-biased sex ratios, and the maternal\ndominance hypothesis predicts male-biased sex ratios.\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis arose from research in human females\nwhich showed that women more dominant in personality than other women are\nmore likely to conceive male infants (Grant, 1994). Later, following evidence\nwhich showed that serum testosterone is correlated with dominance behaviours in\nshown that serum testosterone in human females is significantly correlated with\nscores on a psychometric instrument designed to measure dominance (Grant and\nFrance, 2001). Thus, the presence of above average serum testosterone in a\nhuman female suggests both above average dominant behaviour and an increased\nlikelihood of conceiving a male infant.\nBased on observations beginning in the mid 1960s, and formally proposed in\n1990 (Grant, 1990), this hypothesis appeared to run counter to the accepted truth\nthat the sex of the infant in humans is determined by mere chance, depending on\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nwhether an X- or a Y-chromosome-bearing spermatozoon happens to fertilize the\novum. The maternal dominance hypothesis, while recognizing the basic,\nindispensable function of X- and Y-chromosome -bearing spermatozoa,\nintroduced the possibility of an additional component into the process of\nfertilization, namely some kind of discriminatory role for the mammalian mother,\nsuch that she could give an advantage to either an X- or a Y-chromosome-bearing\nspermatozoon, depending on which sex offspring she is, at that time, and in that\nplace, more suited to raise.\nThe phrase \"more suited to raise\" refers to a multi-layered environmental,\nphysiological and psychological suitability. Since mammalian testosterone levels\nhave been shown to be responsive to environmental influences (Mazur and Booth,\nmay contribute to an adaptive response about which sex offspring to conceive.\nMaternal psychoneuroendocrinology must play a role in interpreting the\nconditions, and varying the level of testosterone in accordance with these factors.\nThus conditions in the environment could influence the individual female's level\nof serum testosterone in each breeding season, or estrus or menstrual cycle. These\ndiffering levels could, in turn, differentially influence various mechanisms or\npathways within the reproductive tract of the female. Several possible\nmechanisms have already been described (Eberhard, 1996). They include\nselection and development of the ovum within the follicle (Haning et al, 1993),\ntiming of ovulation in relation to the length of the follicular phase (Weinberg et\nal, 1995), timing of conception within the menstrual or estrus cycle (Guerrero,\nare influenced by maternal hormone levels.\nThus female testosterone, already shown in some settings to be attuned and\nresponsive to environmental influences, is hypothesized to be working in\nsynchrony with maternal reproductive physiology to ensure that the sex of the\noffspring conceived is optimal to both maternal characteristics and environmental\nconditions. Physiologically, maternal testosterone levels are likely to be\ndifferentially suited to the development and growth of a male or a female embryo\nand fetus. Behaviourally, at least in humans and rats, it seems likely that maternal\ntestosterone underpins small, but important qualitative differences in maternal-\nneonate interactions according to the sex of the infant/offspring. Such\ninteractions tend to set the overall direction of development. In humans, mothers\nof female infants are more responsive to their babies than mothers of male infants\n(Grant, 1994). They respond to their infants' vocalizations and movements by\nrepeating them, thus providing very early experience of the synchronization of\ninterpersonal interaction. Mothers of male infants appear to stimulate their babies\nmore than the mothers of female infants. Mothers of male babies have been\nshown to hold their infants upright by the trunk, to arouse them and to initiate or\nprovoke behaviours in them. Mothers of rats have been shown to stimulate male\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nneonates significantly more frequently than their female littermates (Beyer and\nFeder, 1987). Adaptively speaking, both the physiological and the psychological\nmaternal differences appear to work in tandem to ensure the optimal development\nof the particular sex of offspring conceived.\nUnder normal conditions, dominance and serum testosterone (both normally\ndistributed) are likely to be highly correlated. Females that have more of both\nwill be likely to conceive male offspring and to raise them successfully. Females\nthat have less of both will be more likely to conceive and raise reproductively\nsuccessful female offspring. Testosterone fluctuates over time, according to\nenvironmental conditions both physical and psychological (Gray, 1992). Suppose\nindividual females are born with genetically imposed limits in their ability to\nmanufacture testosterone. Each female's testosterone levels will fluctuate over a\ngiven range. Those with genetically low testosterone will fluctuate within a lower\nrange and produce mainly female offspring; those with genetically high\ntestosterone will fluctuate within a higher range and conceive mostly male\noffspring. Most will fluctuate within the medium range, tipping either side of an\nhypothesized critical threshold and produce offspring of both sexes.\nResponsiveness to the environment\nWhat sorts of conditions cause fluctuations in serum testosterone? In the\nfemale, anything that causes chronic stress will tend to raise an individual's serum\ntestosterone levels (Gray, 1992). Female medical students, in the months building\nup to examinations, had higher testosterone levels than normal (Grant and France,\n2001). Chronic hardship or stress, (as in food shortages, war or epidemic) appears\nto increase testosterone levels in many females, thus temporarily raising the\nnumber of females suited to conceiving male offspring. (This is in contrast to\nacute stress, as in earthquake, flood, or sudden bereavement, which appears to\nhave the opposite effect, resulting in a lowered sex ratio nine months later, see for\nThe relationship between chronic stress and raised testosterone levels in the\nmammalian female could be doubly adaptive. First the individual female\n(mother) enduring chronic stress would be slightly toughened to help withstand\nthe stress; and secondly, there would be fewer females in the next generation, thus\npossibly protecting the habitat from excess population growth. Verme (1983)\nreviewed all studies on deer sex ratios and concluded that \"an increase in the\nproportion of male fawns as range conditions deteriorated would serve as a\npopulation self-regulating mechanism\". He came in for severe criticism for this,\nbecause his suggestion implied support for the controversial group selection\ntheory. But the facts could equally well be explained by postulating the\nindividual's reactions to reduced food, which had the effect of raising that\nindividual's testosterone levels.\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nAdaptive manipulation of sex ratios by individuals could result in collateral\nbenefit to a group, in just the same way as say, lack of water could cause kidney\ndamage in some individuals, who then died, leaving more water for those that\nremained. This too might look like group selection, but it is not; those individuals\nwith more efficient kidneys survived and the others did not. The problem of\nmisattribution of group selection charges could be solved by reference to shared\nphysiological mechanisms adapted in each individual to a greater or lesser extent,\nto solve the same problems.\nIn times of plenty and low stress, individual female serum testosterone levels\nwould tend to drop allowing for more females to conceive female offspring. This\ntoo may be advantageous in that it would provide the vehicle for population\nexpansion in times of plenty, and good conditions in which to produce and rear\nhealthy females who may continue to be successful breeders and enhance their\nspecies, thus taking optimum advantage of the good conditions.\nFor a female mammal to adjust the sex ratio of her offspring in accordance\nwith her perception of the environment there would need to be two related\nmechanisms in place. First, there would need to be a physiological mechanism by\nwhich a female was able to react sensitively to stress-inducing changes in the\nenvironment. Secondly, there would need to be a relationship between this\nmechanism and the mechanism by which the sex of her offspring was determined\n(or pre-determined). Both these mechanisms would need to react within the time\nscale of her estrus or menstrual cycle.\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis offers serum testosterone as a primary\ncandidate. It is known that serum testosterone in males, both animal and human,\ncan vary dramatically over time, according to the male's perception of changes in\nhis social and physical environments (Kemper, 1990). There is also evidence to\nshow that, unlike the male, female testosterone rises in response to (perceived)\nchronic stress. Female testosterone is also related to self-reported dominance\nResolving existing problems\nPostulating such a mechanism would help reconcile the studies (cited at the\nbeginning of this article) of sex ratio variation in humans and in deer. It would\nsolve many problems, from the rise in the number of human male births following\nClapham, 1993). There is already persuasive evidence to suggest a connection\nbetween maternal testosterone and offspring sex ratio in birds (Sheldon, 1999).\nConsistent findings on mammalian sex ratios may emerge when \"good\ncondition\" is seen for what it is - a frequently occurring, but nevertheless\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nspurious correlate of dominance and high status. Although all three descriptors \u00ad\ngood condition, dominance and high status occur frequently in conjunction with\none another, and look intuitively as though they should be connected, their co-\noccurrences are not logically necessary. An animal may be in good condition\nwithout being dominant and/or without having high status. In a group of animals\nin poor condition, some will still be dominant.\nAnd in some settings high status animals are not necessarily the most\ndominant, for example when factors such as age, health and time of joining the\ngroup are major contributors to status. Although of signal importance in itself,\neven the characteristic dominance must be seen as a by-product of serum\ntestosterone. For primatologists, who scarcely ever concern themselves with\nproximate mechanisms, this may seem limiting; however it has the advantage of\nbeing potentially falsifiable, and it minimizes the need for ingenious, but\nnevertheless speculative explanations of sex ratio variation.\nAssuming similar physiological mechanisms for reproduction in female\nhumans and other primates, it may also be possible to reconcile otherwise\nseemingly incompatible results in methodologically good research. For example,\nif female testosterone (not dominance or good condition) is the key, two different\nstudies of rhesus monkeys which seemed to show contradictory results, may\ninstead, demonstrate the workings of the hypothesized maternal dominance-\ntestosterone link. In the first study, dominant, high status rhesus monkey mothers\nliving in captivity gave birth to a significant number of female offspring (Simpson\nand Simpson, 1982). For these females living conditions were almost stress-free.\nMany, if not most, were born in captivity, and thus did not have a stressful\nadjustment to make to living in cages. There was always plenty of food and their\nsustained high status meant they had priority access to whatever was desirable.\nThis comfortable lifestyle required little or no effort, and certainly no stress.\nTherefore testosterone levels were likely to be low and these high status females\ngave birth to daughters. For lower status females, life was (comparatively) more\ndifficult. At best, they had to await their turn at the food hoppers and not get in\nthe way of their superiors. At worst they were severely harassed. These females\nconceived more male offspring, which may have been a consequence of having\nhigher stress-induced serum testosterone levels.\nIn the second study (Meikle et al, 1984), the quality of the environment was\nextremely harsh and the birth sex ratios the opposite of those born to the caged\nmothers. Here the high status, dominant females had more male offspring, and\nthe low status mothers, more female offspring. These rhesus monkeys lived on an\nisland on which there was intense competition for life-sustaining food supplies\nand water. Those adult females that were born with (genetically) higher levels of\nserum testosterone (than the other females) were able to fight that bit harder for\naccess to supplies. Although all were in poor condition, the higher testosterone\nfemales were slightly better off in both condition and status. Those females had\nThe maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard\nmore male offspring, whereas the low testosterone females, who had less success\nin the fights over food, were in poorer condition and had lower status, conceived\nfemale offspring, and fewer of them. As the harsh conditions continued, even\nthose female infants that survived birth did not necessarily reach adulthood.\nAdaptively, such sequences result in falling populations and allow time for the\nhabitat to be restored. When it is, there is less competition for food, lower stress-\ninduced testosterone in the females and more likelihood of normal, or even below\nnormal sex ratios in the offspring.\nIn this way natural selection could be shown to favour maternal ability to\nadjust the sex ratio of her offspring according to her circumstances, her\n\"circumstances\" being those environmental as well as genetic factors which give\nrise to both her physiological and her psychological condition at the time of\nconception. Such a re-conceptualization could provide the \"single unifying\nframework ... required to explain variation in the extent to which different species\nadjust their offspring sex ratio\" (West and Sheldon, 2002).\nFor a maternal sex-determining mechanism to have benefits greater than its\ncosts, it would need to operate early and efficiently in the reproductive pathway.\nThe most parsimonious point, the one with least waste and most efficiency, would\nbe immediately prior to conception. The most efficient and timely mechanism for\nsex determination at this point in the reproductive pathway would perhaps be by\nselection and development of an ovum already adapted to receive an X- or a Y-\nchromosome-bearing spermatozoon. This would give the opportunity for the\nfemale to take a perfectly timed reading of both her internal and external\nenvironments and select and develop the ovum accordingly. Given that, in\nmammals, the female's contribution to reproduction is overwhelmingly greater\nthan the male's, it may make sense for her to be the one to determine whether the\noffspring should be male or female.\nAwesomely adaptive systems for ensuring appropriate sex ratios appear to be\nin place right across the taxa, from the haplodiploid species to those species with\nchromosomal sex determination (West et al, 2002). It may be that a very finely\ntuned or titrated system resting on both genetic potential and reactivity to\nenvironmental conditions of the female's serum testosterone forms the basis of a\nproximate mechanism of sex pre-determination that keeps even mammalian sex\nratios perfectly in balance with environmental contingencies.\n"
