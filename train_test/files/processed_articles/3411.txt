    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article accords to the theory of community-based tourism, which represents a concept that respects natural and\ncultural resources of a particular community and encourages participation of its members in the process of tourist product\ncreation. The article operates in the planning phase and aims to give insights into the process of establishing the groundwork\nfor community-based tourism. The key element is documenting and illustrating everything that could be a part of what is\nknown as \"traditional wisdom,\" namely, the skills and knowledge of traditional life practices. The methods of case study,\ncontent analysis, and observation of the village of Omoljica, Serbia, were used. The positive aspect of this locality is reflected\nin the existing short-term initiatives of organizations and individuals engaging in preserving traditional practices, but without\nsystematic, long-term planning and management of community-based tourism, these individual efforts to revalue traditional\nlife practices would stay unrecognizable and invisible for visitors and stakeholders. Thus, the main goal of this article is to\nunderstand the relation between short-term bottom-up initiatives and long-term top-down strategic planning of specific\necotourism destinations, one that would embrace the traditional ways of rural community life. The contribution of this study,\nin addition to documenting and illustrating \"traditional wisdom\" of the specific rural community placed in the protected area\nwhich encompasses a particular local social system, will be reflected in the creation of a set of guidelines for sustainable, rural,\ncommunity-based ecotourism as a soft-driver development of protected areas near big cities of the postsocialist countries.\n",

Attempts were made to mitigate these negative\nchanges through the inclusion of as much of each respective\ncommunity as possible into both planning and active partici-\npation in the tourism industry. Gradually, over the past 20\nyears, the importance of community has become a key factor\nin tourism planning, which has led to coining the term \"com-\nmunity-based tourism\" (CBT) describing a concept of tour-\nism that is based on local human and natural resources,\n\"managed and owned by the community, for the community,\nwith the purpose of enabling visitors to increase their aware-\nness and learn about the community and local ways of life\"\n(The Thailand Community Based Institute, 2013). Such a\nconcept declares that the local community could be involved\nin tourism in two primary ways--through profit distribution\n1University of Arts in Belgrade, Serbia\n2Educons University, Novi Sad, Serbia\nCorresponding Author:\nIvana Voli, Faculty of Sports and Tourism, Educons University, Radnicka\nEmail: volic.ivana@gmail.com\nThe Importance of Documenting\nand Including Traditional Wisdom in\nCommunity-Based Ecotourism Planning:\nA Case Study of the Nature Park\nPonjavica in the Village of Omoljica\n(Serbia)\nVesna uki1 and Ivana Voli2\n Keywords\ncommunity-based ecotourism, traditional wisdom, planning\n2 SAGE Open\nand decision making. Both aspects are vital for community\nwell-being, though challenging to achieve.\nIn this article, we will examine the particular case study of\nthe Nature Park Ponjavica and the village Omoljica, which\nfalls within the territory of the administrative, industrial, cul-\ntural center of the Southern Banat Province of Serbia and the\ncity of Pancevo. With this aim in mind, we address the spe-\ncifics of a region that contains both natural and cultural\nassets, and which is additionally situated within a postsocial-\nist society in transition that has its own characteristics regard-\ning the relations of culture and nature. Underdevelopment\nand isolation from main economic centers has positively\ncontributed to the preserving of nature and traditional ways\nof life in this community. This could be considered an advan-\ntage, especially in the context of the contemporary urban\nindustrial crisis in the developed world. In addition, from a\nplanning and development perspective, the well-preserved\nnature and traditional ways of life could be treated as an\nopportunity for the better appreciation of repressed notional\nconcepts representing the polar opposite of the developed\nworld's dychotomy (a focus on interior culture, endogenous\ndevelopment, rural communities); a rediscovering of values\nwithin those concepts that are worth reviving, as well as\nincorporating such concepts into contemporary development\nstrategies. The key question being raised in this article is,\n\"Could tourism be a soft-driver development, one that would\nembrace the traditional ways of rural community life?\" Main\ngoal of this article is to understand relation between bottom-\nup initiatives of the civil sector and top-down strategic plan-\nning and management of specific ecotourism destinations\nwho decide to activate traditional ways of rural community\nlife for tourists and visitors.\nFor this case study, the Nature Park Ponjavica in the\nVillage of Omoljica (Serbia) has been chosen as a locality\nthat offers both natural and cultural resources, where old\npractices are still actively employed, but rarely considered as\nan asset that could be valued for future development. The\nanswer to the question raised in this article is complex and, at\nthis phase, rather unclear. This article attempts to establish\nsome key issues related to community-based ecotourism\nplanning, with special reference to the documenting of tradi-\ntional practices that could be of value both in the contempo-\nrary life of today's rural communities, as well as in\nresponsible, CBT development.\nTheoretical Framework\nThis article is grounded on the theoretical concepts of com-\nmunity-based ecotourism, tourism planning, and postsocial-\nist transitional society, and how these concepts relate to\ntraditional wisdom based on sustainable land and water use\npractices.\nCommunity tourism development is a concept \"proposed\nin the context of sustainable development\" (World Tourism\nOrganization [UNWTO], 2008, p. 2). Namely, it stems out of\nthe \"adoptancy platform\" which Jafari (1990) has recognized\nas a third platform within which tourism as a social activity\nhas been operating. The first platform was the \"advocacy\nplatform,\" related to the rapid tourism development of the\nseventh decade of 20th century. Tourism was seen as a means\nof economic progress for destinations and tourism operators,\nwithout any stance regarding its development. After two\ndecades of tourism development, negative sociocultural and\necological effects had been noticed (demonstration effect,\nacculturation, pollution due to mass transportation, and\ndemands for tourist destination's adaptations for tourist's\nneeds). After this period of uncontrolled development, more\nvoices were risen against tourism (especially its environmen-\ntal impacts), and more researchers in the tourism field were\naddressing the negative consequences of tourism develop-\nond platform as a \"cautionary platform.\" Following these\ntwo platforms, the third, more balanced \"adaptancy plat-\nform\" occurred, which represented \"an attempt to avoid the\nextremes of the first two platforms with their contradictory\narguments by positing alternative tourism development\nmodels\" (UNWTO, 2008, p. 2). Arguments have been made\nthat \"both ecotourism and community-based tourism grew\nout of this `adaptancy platform'\" (UNWTO, 2008, p. 2).\nSuch arguments appear to be applicable, since the first\n\"advocacy platform\" was characterized by tourism develop-\nment without regard for the communities, their local charac-\nteristics, and their traditions. On the contrary, the \"cautionary\nplatform\" prioritized raising awareness of the degrading,\nnegative effects that tourism can invoke. At this point in\ntime, we can use all of the advantages of each of the previous\nscenarios--having insights into what effects uncontrolled\ntourism development can bring about, while at the same time\nbeing aware of the importance of developing appreciation of\ntraditional living practices of local communities.\nWe should bear in mind that the platforms mentioned\nrelate to the highly developed tourist environments of South\nand Western Europe, Northern America, and South-East\nAsia. In contrast, in the Balkans, there are communities that\nare not yet \"touristically\" active, or industrially developed.\nThey stand somewhere \"in between\"--modernization and\ntraditional practices existing in a sort of vacuum of time and\nspace, not celebrated enough to be commercialized, yet not\ncompletely neglected or abandoned. This position could be a\npositive starting point, since there are decades of touristic\npractices and theories which could be used as lessons in tour-\nism development, as we may be able to avoid past pratfalls\nand adverse activities.\nCommunity-Based Ecotourism\nThe renewed interest in the community as a basic unit of\ntourism development, management, planning, and marketing\ncan be traced to the changing meaning of the concept of\nuki and Voli 3\ncommunity (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2). Community in the\ncontext of tourism planning and development is usually\ndefined from a geographical perspective as \"a body of people\nliving in the same locality\" (Wisansing, 2008). But we can-\nnot refer only to territory and geographic location when\ndescribing community. Community encompasses \"a particu-\nlar local social system\" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2) and \"an\nideology, often hiding the power relations which inevitably\nunderlie communities\" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2). Urry\n(1995) describes community existing when \"there is `com-\nmunion,'\" a particular kind of human association implying\npersonal ties, a sense of belonging and warmth\" (p. 10). As\nCommunities are groups of people residing in the same region\nwith common interests and identity and as such they represent a\nbonding of people and place, which creates its own distinctive\ncharacter and force for survival in an increasingly impersonal\nand big business world. (p. 96)\n\"Community\" can embrace notions of spatial contiguity,\nsocial interaction, reflexivity, notions of shared aspirations,\nand values. It tends to be used implicitly in a consensual\nsense, even when potential conflict and competition, particu-\nlarly in relation to the power relations involved in decision-\nmaking processes, are the reality of place-based (and\nnon-place\u00adbased) social relations (Joppe, 1996; Pearce,\nMoscardo, & Ross, 1996). \"Communities\" may not be geo-\ngraphically bounded or homogeneous entities, but can be\nsocially differentiated and diverse. Considerations of gender,\nincome, age, class/caste, origins, and other aspects of social\nidentity can be reflected in the holding of conflicting values\nand resource priorities rather than the predominance of shared\ninterests and aspirations (Leach, Mearns, & Scoones, 1999).\nWe can say that today communities are key items when\nwe speak about tourism. There are host communities that are\n\"a basic reason for tourists to travel, to experience the way of\nlife and material products\" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 1).\nCommunity could be considered one of the central points of\na contemporary perspective on tourism and \"the rights of\nlocal communities must be integral to considerations of sus-\nIn an effort to mitigate the tensions resulting from the\nmore negative impacts of uneven/unplanned development,\nmany researchers are suggesting that tourism-dominated/\ninterested communities should plan their evolution more sys-\ntematically, thereby taking into account residents' attitudes\nand perceptions about its growth at the outset (Beeton, 2006;\ntourism that takes environmental, social and cultural\nsustainability into account. It is managed and owned by the\ncommunity, for the community, with the purpose of enabling\nvisitors to increase their awareness and learn about the\ncommunity and local ways of life. (The Thailand Community\nSalazar emphasizes the importance of local initiatives that\nshould stipulate whether CBT becomes an acceptable model\nfor different stakeholders in particular local communities\nTo establish a rational relationship between CBT and eco-\ntourism, we must embrace an explanation of ecotourism as\n\"a sustainable form of natural resource-based tourism that\nfocuses primarily on experiencing and learning about nature\nand which is ethically managed to be low-impact, non-con-\nsumptive and locally oriented\" (Fennel, 1999). UNEP and\nthe World Tourism Organization emphasized the characteris-\ntics of ecotourism that are based on responsible project man-\nagement. They include \"an appreciation of indigenous\ncultures prevailing in natural areas as part of the visitor expe-\nrience, education and interpretation as part of the tourist\nofferings, and the engagement of small visitor groups orga-\nnized by small, specialized, and locally-owned businesses\"\n(World Wildlife Fund International, 2001). The terminology\nof community-based ecotourism is relatively new, though the\nconcept has become familiar due to the theoretical develop-\nment of sustainable and CBT--it is the most responsible\ntourism development for all the aspects of a community in\nwhich it takes place--regarding at once nature, culture, and\nsocioeconomic status of a locale. As a concept, it \"entails\npeople's commitment to responsibly use all available local\nresources and to trigger development and prosperity through\nlocal initiatives\" (uki, Voli, Tisma, & Jelinci, 2014). If\nwe look more thoroughly, we can see that there is an overlap-\nping of CBT and ecotourism (low-impact, locally oriented,\npresenting a local way of life). In addition, there are some\nconcepts that comprise ecotourism (indigenous cultures, nat-\nural areas, small visitor groups, specialized and locally\nowned businesses) and that are easily adaptable to the con-\ncept of CBT. For these reasons, we have chosen the term\ncommunity-based ecotourism as one of the theoretical back-\ngrounds for researching traditional wisdom and practices.\nTourism Policy and Planning With Special\nReference to CBT\nTourism policy and planning are two interconnected activi-\nties. Policy creation \"is unique to each state and it should set\nthe regulations, rules, guidelines, directives and develop-\nment/promotion objectives, and strategies for long-term\ntourism development\" (Edgell, DelMastro Allen, Smith, &\nare written to ensure that developments reflect overriding\ndefinition linked to sustainability and planning is a \"process\nwhich aims to anticipate, regulate and monitor change to\n4 SAGE Open\ncontribute to the wider sustainability of the destination, and\nthereby enhance the tourist experience of the destination or\nthat \"strategic planning of tourism destinations is a complex\ntask due to the interdependence of multiple stakeholders and\nthe fragmented control over a given destination's resources\"\n(Jamal & Getz, 1995). Usually, the governor's office and\nadministration, working together with the state legislature,\nserve as the architects, budgeters, and planners for initiating,\nimplementing, and supporting a state's tourism program. But\nthere are many other stakeholders that are occasionally left\nbehind: \"citizens, local governments, private businesses, and\neconomic, as well as environmental, social, and other groups\nthat should all be involved in the process\" (Edgell et al.,\n2008, p. 32). To achieve \"continuous tourism planning that is\nintegrated with all other planning processes for social and\neconomic development, it must be modelled as an interactive\nPlanning could occur at different scales--international,\nnational, regional, and community. All of them are important\nfor tourism, \"but planning at the community level is vital if\nany region wishes to deliver tourism experiences which\nensure both visitor satisfaction and ongoing benefits for the\nresidents of destination areas\" (Simmons, 1994). There are\ndifferent aspects of tourism planning at the community level:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the knowledge present within the community of their\nown resources,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an understanding of the nature of tourism and its\npotential benefits/disadvantages,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the participation of different stakeholders,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 environmental sensitivity,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 an awareness of power relations within the commu-\nnity, and the potential economic and sociocultural\nbenefits.\nIn this article, we are prioritizing the first level of building\ncommunity capacity--knowledge about the resources and\nthe importance of traditional practices preservation and use\naccording to contemporary needs. After gaining knowledge\nand an appreciation of the surroundings, the next logical step\nshould be the examining of information regarding the tourist\nindustry, along with all of its positive and negative aspects.\nWhere there is limited local knowledge of tourism, few, if\nany, local leaders emerge, and external agents hold the bal-\nance of power over tourism development decisions. Under\nthese conditions, it is not surprising to find that tourism plan-\nning is not often conducted and that little effort is made to\ncoordinate the interests of local stakeholders (Moscardo,\n2008, p. 10). On the contrary, planning the growth and devel-\nopment of tourism where local participation is encouraged\nby public agencies could lead to a conflict whereby a vocif-\nerous minority influences decisions, while the silent majority\nremains unheard, suggesting a passive but tacit acceptance\nOne more very important thing is that\nmost of the planning literature dealing with tourism focuses on\nwhat should be done in developing the industry at the expense of\nproviding an understanding of what is actually being pursued\nand what can be done given a destination's local conditions.\nAs Moscardo (2008) explains, many existing tourism plan-\nning models are prescriptive and start with the assumption\nthat tourism should be developed. The option of not develop-\ning tourism is not considered and this omission is fundamen-\ntally inconsistent with CBT (p. 6).\nTo avoid these potential conflicts, effective coordination\nmechanisms and tourism plans should be created; otherwise,\nit becomes increasingly difficult for destination communities\nto get involved in either tourism development decisions or to\nparticipate in tourism-related businesses. Moscardo argues\nthat more research and better information on different options\nfor involving communities in tourism through better coordi-\nnation mechanisms, partnerships, and other cooperative ven-\ntures would be useful in assisting communities in overcoming\ncommunity tourism planning, the most important thing is to\nstart with the residents and their standpoints on tourism,\nwhether regarding their potential involvement or simply the\ngeneral development of tourism in their community. Our\nimpression is that before building capacities for tourism\ndevelopment, community residents should be empowered\nthrough knowledge about their own resources and through\nthe valuing of the residents themselves as an element of high\nimportance, which will in turn bring them closer to their\nPostsocial Transitional Society and\nTourism--Local Context\nIn this section, we examine the local context of the Balkans,\nand more precisely North-Eastern Serbia, the Autonomous\nProvince of Vojvodina, the lower Danube basin, the\nMunicipality of Pancevo, the village Omoljica, and the\nnature reserve Ponjavica. Serbian society could be described\nas a \"transitional society\" that is faced with a change of\nsociopolitical systems, while coming to terms with the con-\ntemporary global crisis of culture, economy, and ecological\ndisaster. This kind of situation effects the creation of new\ndevelopment strategies. Together with an innovative cre-\native economy and nature conservation, awareness about\ncultural development is beginning to be raised. In defining\ncultural development, endogenous development (based on\nthe internal resources of the specific country) and exoge-\nnous development (induced or stimulated by external fac-\ntors) refer to the processes of progress in all spheres of\nhuman activity and life. Cultural development is thus con-\nceived as \"a consequence of the mutual influence of\nuki and Voli 5\ndifferent cultures, economic prosperity, technological\ndevelopment, changes in the sociopolitical system, etc\"\nAn important aspect that must be mentioned when dis-\ncussing traditional wisdom and life practices in the local con-\ntext mentioned above is that the practical public policy of the\nformer Yugoslavia was to impose a single model of social\nbehavior, much to the detriment of cultural diversity among\ntraditional cultural forms, experiences, and values were at\ntimes forgotten. Villages were overloaded with urban culture\nand rural culture was moved to the city's museums, archives,\nand libraries, all of which the rural population would barely\nvisit. In such a manner, the tangible and intangible cultural\nheritage of a people is almost completely separated from that\nsame rural population whose generations were creating that\nculture. However, the \"cultural public\" in contemporary\nSerbia is not interested in the problems of the village, nor\ndoes it recognize the diversity of cultural expressions and\nidentities of particular villages and towns (United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n[UNESCO], 2005), a wealth that should be saved from obliv-\nion, developed, promoted, and transmitted to future genera-\ntions for its cultural value. On account of this neglect, there\nhas been a constant migration from villages to towns, so that\nsince the Second World War onwards, roughly 50% of the\nrural population has left the villages; once home to 90% of\nthe population in the early fifties, the countryside now\naccounts for about 40% of the total population of Serbia. In\nsuch a situation, the local government and public cultural\ninstitutions continue to perform their missions as in the time\nof the dictatorial, centrist regime of the former Yugoslavia.\nCurrently, in the field of cultural policy, a concept of ter-\nritory driven cultural policy, which includes taking responsi-\nbility for raising the quality of cultural life, is being developed\n(Dragievi Sesi & Dragojevi, 2006). This kind of policy\nimplies turning to the internal resources of a very specific\nlocation and cultural functionalism as a special model of cul-\ntural policy action (Dragievi Sesi & Dragojevi, 2005, p.\n21). It differs from cultural diffusionism in its inventiveness,\ndynamism, dispersion, and involving of various local actors\nwho operate within public, private, and civil sectors. Focused\non the cultural life of local communities, not the elite culture\nas the dominant model, it affirms different cultural models\nthat correspond to the diverse cultural needs of citizens.\nWorthy of mention, the tourism-developed Western coun-\ntries turning to local resources was a key issue during the 80s\nof 20th century. In that time, Murphy (1988) explains that the\nrise in community consciousness has been a growing awareness\nof local heritage, both natural and cultural, which has created the\nlocal way of life; such awareness has provided local roots to the\nconservation movement and broadened its perspective from\nconcern over international landmarks, to more local issues, like\nsaving the downtown facades or local vistas.\nIn the same period Yugoslavia was a country with devel-\noped tourism (with tourism development based on Jafari's\n\"advocacy platform\") with a tendency to develop more and\nwar occurred, leaving tourist actual and potential destina-\ntions without any possibility for development. During the\nfirst and second decades of the 21st century, some touristic\nactivities began to develop. Major planning documents had\nbeen created (National tourism strategy of the Republic of\nSerbia, and several destination master plans), and a high per-\ncentage of major public investments were directed toward\ntourism development. In light of this context, we can regard\npresent-day Serbia as a country with underdeveloped tour-\nism that is planning for tourism to serve as one of its key\nstrategic economic activities. Despite these complications,\nterritorially driven cultural policy, as well as more jurisdic-\ntion for local communities (municipalities), is opening up\npossibilities for community-based activities, especially CBT\nplanning.\nResearch Method and Techniques\nThe article used the historical method to study and determine\nthe facts, analysis, and synthesis of the vertical development\nof rural communities in whose territory is placed the pro-\ntected natural park and its associated cultural heritage. Based\non studies of relevant theories and data on community-based\necotourism and tourism planning gathered during theoretical\nand empirical desk research, three methods of qualitative\nanalysis were used in this article--participant observation,\ncontent analysis, and case study with narrative inquiry.\nObservation is used as a qualitative field research, note-\ntaking method aimed at collecting data about the current\nstate of nature and culture in a specific rural community\nplaced in south-east of the Vojvodina province. The observa-\ntion was carried out continuously in the period from 2012 to\n2015 in the rural hinterland territory of the City of Pancevo,\nwhich stands as the largest industrial and cultural center in\nthe region. The aim was to observe the extent to which natu-\nral and cultural heritage reflect the traditional wisdom of the\nrural population, and to what extent is this heritage still intact\nand usable in the everyday life of the community.\nContent analysis is focused on documents related to pro-\ntection and management of natural and cultural heritage,\nwith the purpose of studying the extent to which cultural,\ntourism, educational, and other public policies encourage\ndevelopment of CBT.\nFinally, the case study was related to the area of both the\nPonjavica Nature Park and the Village of Omoljica, where\nparticular life practices and cultural heritage were analyzed\nas traditional wisdom that could be a starting point for inter-\npretation through CBT. The first reason why this particular\nlocation was chosen for in-depth research is that this Park is\none of 16 protected parks in Serbia, yet it remains virtually\nunknown as a tourist destination, despite possessing\n6 SAGE Open\nconsiderable development resources. Another reason is that\nwe wanted to explore the extent of the development of the\nawareness of the local people regarding the value of resources\nembodying traditional wisdom. Methods used include narra-\ntive inquiry and a number of interviews with representatives\nof the local government, cultural institutions, civil organiza-\ntions, and residents, all of which were conducted during the\nperiod of observation, assuming that community-based eco-\ntourism, as a form of alternative tourism, must embrace indi-\nvidual initiatives within the community.\nResults\nPonjavica Nature Park is located in the villages Omoljica and\nBanatski Brestovac, which fall within the territorial jurisdic-\ntion of town Pancevo, in the Vojvodina province of the\nRepublic of Serbia. In the document titled Proposal for the\nProtection of the Ponjavica Nature Park, the Park is charac-\nterized by\na variation of habitats in a natural and semi-natural condition\nrepresenting the last remains of the formerly large water and\nswamp complex standing as part of the diluvial area of the\nDanube river, as well as a refuge for many species whose\nhabitats were destroyed during water regulation. Ponjavica also\nrepresents an ecological corridor connecting the torn remains of\nthe original, native vegetation along the flow of the Ponjavica\nriver with the ecological corridor of the Danube. (Provincial\nThose characteristics mean that this park could be included\nof which exist in Serbia. From the standpoint of legislation in\nthe field of nature conservation in Serbia, Ponjavica was rec-\nognized in the aforementioned proposal as a protected area\nwith local significance, which until recently did not have an\ninternational dimension (uki et al., 2014).\nIn accordance with the aim of this article, which addresses\nand prioritizes the traditional wisdom of rural communities\nand relies on community-based ecotourism and tourism\nplanning theories, we must examine the most significant\nissues facing this geographical region. More precisely, it is a\nvillage of Omoljica, founded in the 18th century. Today, it\nhas 6,518 inhabitants, the majority of whom are Serbs,\nthough in the past, there also lived Germans and Hungarians.\nThe village was founded in the 18th century, which is a\nstarting point for studying its development. Although this is\na rural area, its uniqueness lies in progressive development\nand innovations, with special reference to local needs and the\nsurrounding nature. As a result of our previous research, we\nhave established that the territory of Omoljica village has\naccess to several cultural and historical elements which exist\nand yet were not recognized in the Proposal for Protection.\nThus, their developmental role has not been considered so\nfar. Industrial\u00adtechnical heritage that was identified as a part\nof early industrialization is of great importance and could be\npreserved and used as a valuable document of the past. For\nthe purpose of this article, we will mention the pump station\non the regional hydro system Nadela in Ivanovo, built in\n1897. Regardless of the fact that it has been recommended\nfor conservation status as an example of industrial\u00adtechnical\nheritage worthy of preservation, it has not yet been included\nin the conservation regime. Other example of industrial\u00ad\ntechnical heritage are two machine mills dating from the\nperiod of the greatest industrialization of the village. As\nthey have been classified as entities of industrial-technical\nheritage, representing a way of life and work of the village\npopulation, which was primarily agricultural in the past, owing\nto the exceptionally fertile soil of the diluvial area of the Danube.\nAlong with the industrial-technical heritage, we should\nmention a \"miraculous\" spring with healing water that was\nused in the first half of the 20th century for treatment of dis-\neases. It could be considered as a part of traditional wisdom\nthat is fading since \"numerous accounts regarding this cus-\ntom and its associated beliefs failed to be recorded\" (uki\net al., 2014). We strongly believe this is the time when proj-\nects of documenting customs and beliefs should be con-\nducted to reestablish the connection between past and current\ngenerations.\nTraditional wisdom, considered it its wider sense, is not\nconnected only to the industrial-heritage and medical beliefs.\nThe religious tradition, myths, and customs are also incorpo-\nrated in tradition that had an impact on life practices. Some\nreligious artifacts, monuments, and rituals are still a part of\ntoday's life. In Omoljica, there is one of the oldest Orthodox\nChristian churches in Vojvodina, built in 1780. The church\ncontinues to maintain an active role among the Orthodox\npopulation in the village, by holding the liturgies on the main\ntraditional celebrations (Christmas, Easter). The days of the\npatron saint of the village are celebrated here each year. This\nunique custom is called \"slava,\" and it is included in the\nUNESCO's list of the intangible cultural heritage of Serbia.\nIt is a \"celebration closely associated with the social and eco-\nnomic development of local communities\" (uki, 2014),\nand as such it has always gathered the vast number of village\ninhabitants that paid respect to the patron saint that provided\na village prosperity and welfare.\nIn the Pancevo district, vineyards were planted as early as\nvineyards. Today, while there is no more wine production,\nthere is an old vineyard cottage from 1920 that was used for\noccasional stays related to this sort of use of agricultural land\nand vineyard maintenance. Near to the cottage is an old\ngrapevine sort known as Dinka, which was typical of\nVojvodina in these earlier times.\nuki and Voli 7\nIn addition to wine growing, the whole way of life of the\nrural population in the past was directly linked to the differ-\nent ways of utilizing the extremely fertile Banat soil. Other\ntraditional life practices are visible in Omoljica--residential\nhouses and economic facilities made of earth (examples\nrange from a Neolithic age pit to late 18th century represen-\ntations to the traditional earthen architecture), industrial\u00ad\ntechnical facilities (which today represent the cultural\nheritage--mills, pumping station, vineyard cottages, etc.),\nthe culture of work that is primarily based on agriculture\n(cereals, wine, industrial crops such as sunflower), the indus-\ntrial processing of agricultural products in the food industry\n(flour, sugar, oil, wine, brandy, etc.), and the culture of dress-\ning (silk that was created by the silkworms reared on mul-\nberry trees), customs, beliefs, and other forms of intangible\nculture.\nCurrent Initiatives\nTourism planning in Serbia is conducted as a top-down activ-\nity, where the government controls the framework for policy\nand industry development. The region of Southern Banat and\nOmoljica village is still not being planned as a tourist desti-\nnation, as other localities are seen as priorities for this pur-\npose. On the contrary, local civil initiatives have been starting\ntheir bottom-up activities for the preservation and promotion\nof natural and cultural assets. In the recent time, the Ponjavica\nAssociation of Environmentalists has been established to\nplan and conduct ecotourism in the protected area of\nOmoljica. The Association has developed a long-term inte-\ncreating a consistent and coherent concept of viable commu-\nnity-based ecotourism in Omoljica (uki et al., 2014). This\nmanagement project comprises three different, yet connected\ngroups of activities that comprehensively approach ecotour-\nism development. Those are \"research of natural and cultural\npotentials, interpretation of heritage, functioning as a prepa-\nration of the destination for potential visitors, and promotion,\naimed at attracting visitors\" (uki et al., 2014). The first\ngroup of activities, research, was aimed at bringing out the\nstories and narratives of the locals (intangible heritage), as a\ndevelopment potential of the Omoljica village. Results that\ncame out of the research served as a platform for selection\nand prioritizing the stories and narratives that can serve as a\nbase for CBT product creation. Those were promoted and\npublished on the website of the Association, in the form of\nshort stories with a goal of awareness raising of the local\npopulation regarding its natural and cultural values, while, at\nthe same time, redefining the identity of the protected area,\ncreating a recognizable spirit of the place that could attract\nlocal visitors (uki et al., 2014). The stories are structured\nin such a way that each represents a particular topic from the\nvillage life (barn, cinema, water, mulberry tree, Zisel, soil,\nmill, Nadela, etc.), reconstructed from written sources or\nfrom the memories of the local population. In addition to\nbeing adaptable for guided tours, the stories and project aims\nto motivate the local population to participate in the develop-\nment of ecotourism in the area of their village. This is par-\nticularly significant, \"since the village school and library\nhave not been designed particularly as institutions of local\nwell-acquainted with their past, lacking an awareness of the\nnatural and cultural values of the village and its potential\nattractiveness for domestic and international visitors. The\nproject has been continued through the creation of tourist\nroutes that include the most significant natural and cultural\nlocalities in Omoljica village. They currently exist only as an\nonline map, with possibilities for walking, bicycle, and canoe\ntours organizing.\nEfforts of the Association are devoted to the tourist acti-\nvation of Omoljica and Ponjavica, based on existing\nresources. Thus far, the association's activities have been\nmanifested in efforts to set up a website intended for the local\npopulation and visitors and to organize gastronomic and\nsports-recreation events (the making of mulberry brandy in\nthe traditional manner, a photo safari by canoe, a contest in\nthe fish pot specialty making that is a part of the traditional\ncelebration of the village slava--Preobrazenje). In the period\nto follow, the Association is planning to finish the restoration\nof the vineyard cottage, which would increase lodging\ncapacities for visitors. The main problem that remains for all\nof the activities--realized, as well as planned, is unsustain-\nable funding. From the Association's cash flow analysis, we\ncan see that \"all the funds invested to this point have been\nacquired from sponsors and individual donations of the\nAssociation founders\" (uki et al., 2014). Because many\nactivities are still at a start-up level and they tend to activate\nmembers of the local community, we argue there should be\nmore sources of funding, with additional financial help from\nthe municipality of Pancevo. The funding diversity would\nunburden the individuals and assist accelerating sustainable\necotourism product creation.\nAs a part of current initiatives, but dating back to 1970, we\ncan mention the \"Zisel international film festival.\" It was\nestablished on the presumption that \"indigenous cultures pre-\nvailing in natural areas are the basic characteristics of eco-\ntourism\" (uki et al., 2014), and since the establishment, it\nhas contributed to the international activity of Omoljica vil-\nlage and its surrounding protected area. This manifestation\nbears witness to the unique cultural relationship between the\ninhabitants of Omoljica and their natural environment, dem-\nonstrating the synergy of nature and culture using arts as its\nmeans. At the same time, \"it contributes towards establishing\nand broadening the international perception of Omoljica from\nthe standpoint of filmmakers worldwide, who participate in\nthe competition of this festival with their films\" (uki et al.,\n2014). However, the local community still does not relate to\nthis event as a potential for tourism development. Since its\nfoundation in 1970, \"Zisel has not been supported by the\ntown's tourist or cultural policy; it has neither stable sources\n8 SAGE Open\nof financing, nor promotional channels\" (uki-Dojcinovi,\nwas the only film village festival in the entire former\nYugoslavia and as such it attracted thousands of visitors and\ntourists back then. In recent years, \"it has been of interest pri-\nmarily only to filmmakers, whose films have been entered in\nthe competition, as well as only minor elements of the local\npopulation\" (uki et al., 2014). This situation caused an\nactivist reaction of a group of young inhabitants of Omoljica\nwhich started the initiative for the International Volunteer Camp\nSunflower to be held immediately before the start of the festival,\nso that local and international volunteers could have time to help\nin the organization of the festival Zisel, as well as in its promotion\nThis activism reflects the core of the community-based eco-\ntourism that should be initiated and developed by members of\nthe local community. Current initiatives of mostly young\npeople represent an affirmative circumstance. With more sta-\nble projects funding and more visitors coming to the munici-\npality, it could be a certain path to CBT development.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the results of the desk and field research, some\ninsights have been made that could be useful to the further\ndevelopment of community-based ecotourism that would\ninclude and prioritize the traditional wisdom of the Omoljica\nrural community.\nFirst of all, it is a fact that tourism development, planned\nas a top-down activity, leaves out small communities that\nhave some resources, yet not enough motivation to carry\nout development activities. In the case of Nature Park\nPonjavica,\nit is obvious that different levels of territorial jurisdiction are\npresent--on the one hand, there are state and provincial activities\nreflected in legislative regulation and occasional funding and,\non the other hand, there are efforts of individual and small group\ninitiatives in the local community with a number of activities\nThe Municipality of Pancevo as local government does not\nrepresent a significant role in the protection, management,\nand funding. As a key stakeholder that is in charge of devel-\nopment and funding issues, Municipality should position\nitself as an active player in development of strategic activi-\nties and it should collaborate with the \"Tamis Dunav\" public\nutility company that serves as a caretaker in charge of man-\naging the Ponjavica Nature Park. Currently, this company\nlacks the planning processes and motivation that could define\npriorities and measurable aims for future development, based on\nwhich destination management, products, services, and\nmarketing could be developed to bring about positive economic,\nsocial, cultural, and environmental impacts, as well as stimulate\nofferings to visitors. (uki et al., 2014)\nAs opposed to the lack of activities on the side of the gov-\nernment and public institutions, private and civil sectors are\nactive in the fields of research, interpretation, and promotion\nof the tourism resources. The existence of such initiatives is\nimportant because they represent the actual strength, willing-\nness, and capacity of individuals associated in small groups\nwith the aim of encouraging CBT development. Yet, as we\nhave already concluded, most of these efforts are \"short-\nterm\" and ad hoc in nature, while there is only one legitimate\nbottom-up integration management project, conducted by the\nrecentlyfoundedPonjavicaAssociationofEnvironmentalists\"\n(uki et al., 2014). In the longer run, individual civil and\nprivate initiatives could not be sustainable without develop-\nmental framework provided by the local government. Tourism\npolicy and planning should have a key role for such a frame-\nwork, assuming they are created with the respect to natural\nand cultural resources and current individual initiatives.\nSecond, we would like to emphasize the importance of\ndocumenting the village's past, the lack of which has caused\na discontinuity of remembrance. This means that the people\nliving nowadays in the village are not appropriately aware of\nthe local history and tradition, due to the aforementioned\nYugoslav practical cultural policy that segregated rural cul-\nture from the rural citizens, placing the artifacts of rural cul-\nture in museums located in cities and towns. This tendency,\nwhich lasted over 50 years, has left its traces that are visible\nin the cultural oblivion and identity loss of the rural popula-\ntion. The only initiatives that are happening in Omoljica and\nPonjavica are the ones coming from individuals and private\ncivil associations. They are active in the field of investigat-\ning, research, and documenting cultural and natural assets.\nThey have, as a matter of necessity, taken over activities that\npublic institutions should be in charge of; the activities that\nare of public importance. The initiative of the civil sector is\nvaluable, but it cannot handle nor replace the systematic and\ncoordinated work of public institutions in charge of docu-\nmenting and protecting cultural heritage. However, their ini-\ntiative could serve as an impetus and starting point from\nwhich the activities of the public institutions could expand.\nThird, it is easily apparent that elements of the cultural tan-\ngible heritage whose traces are documented remain visible in\nthe territory of the village (hydro system, mills, brickworks,\npumping station, vineyard cottage), while the intangible heri-\ntage has begun to be illustrated in the stories of the inhabitants\nand \"slava\"--the celebration of family saint patron's day as\nan active traditional living practice, one which was inscribed\nin November 2014 onto the UNESCO Representative List of\nthe Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Humanity upon a pro-\nposal from Serbia. All of these elements, together with the\nnatural surroundings, could serve as a resource base for tour-\nism planning. One positive circumstance is visible in the\nexpanding jurisdiction of the municipality for activities\nuki and Voli 9\nrelated to tourism. The key approaching challenge would be\nhow to systematically maintain and preserve current resources\nwhile preparing local inhabitants and the municipality for\ntourism development.Another significant challenge would be\nthe documenting and gathering of data needed for protected\narea ecotourism planning.\nIn achieving these goals, educational and cultural heritage\ninstitutions have a particularly significant role, but thus far\nthey have not shown appropriate levels of the awareness of\nthe value of rural cultural heritage, or its role in its safeguard-\ning, conveyance, and usage. Traditional forms of knowledge\nand organization, which have contributed to sustainable\ndevelopment in the past, can be learnt from and built upon\n(Leach, 1998) through educational and cultural programs and\nprojects aimed at safeguarding, transferring, and promoting\ntraditional practices, representations, expressions, knowl-\nedge, and skills--as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts,\nand cultural spaces associated there with (according to the\nConvention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage,\nUNESCO, 2003). On the contrary, in rural communities, in\nwhich these two types of institutions are organizationally\nseparate, schools and libraries represent a complementary\ninstitutional framework of potential partnership for sustain-\nable development and planning of CBT. Their role is espe-\ncially important because the CBT theory indicates that before\nbuilding capacities for tourism development, community\nresidents should be more informed and empowered through\nknowledge about their own resources. Otherwise, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for destination communities to get\ninvolved in either tourism development decisions or to par-\nticipate in tourism-related businesses.\nConclusion\nBased on the theoretical background and research, the key\nissues related to documenting and including traditional wis-\ndom in community-based ecotourism planning in Nature\nPark Ponjavica are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a discontinuity in traditional wisdom remembrance,\nresulting in cultural oblivion,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a lack of knowledge among the locals about the\nresources in their community,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the non-existence of plans for tourism development,\nand\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a lack of interest from the administrative center (city\nof Pancevo) regarding Omoljica and Ponjavica.\nTraditional forms of knowledge and organization, which\nhave contributed to sustainable development in the past, can\nbe learnt from and built upon through educational and cul-\ntural programs and projects aimed to safeguard, transfer, and\npromote traditional wisdom--practices, representations and\nexpressions, knowledge, and skills--as well as the associated\ninstruments, objects, artifacts, and cultural spaces associated.\nRelying on the CBT theory, research, and current insights\nof the Omoljica and Ponjavica community, there are some\nsteps that would seem to be rational when approaching com-\nmunity-based ecotourism in this locale. First of all, awareness\nraising and education about the local resources is the starting\npoint in reconnecting locals with their heritage. Traditional\nforms of knowledge and organization, which have contrib-\nuted to the sustainable use of local resources in the past,\nshould be learnt from and built upon through educational and\ncultural programs and projects aimed to safeguard, transfer,\nand promote traditional practices and wisdom. By raising\nawareness, local inhabitants would gain a new perspective in\nvaluing their natural and cultural assets. After gaining new\nperspectives about the values of their community, local inhab-\nitants should be well informed and educated about tourism as\na possible economic activity. In addition, they should decide\nwhether they indeed want tourism to be developed in their\nmunicipality. In obtaining this statement from local commu-\nnity, we can be sure to avoid a prescriptive standpoint toward\nlocal tourism development. If a positive approach toward\ntourism has been established, the next step would be educa-\ntion of community members and their subsequent inclusion in\nthe ecotourism development. By gradually developing tour-\nism, conflict can be prevented, which can occur when locals\ndo not feel the benefits of such development. Activities\ninvolving the local community should include specific plan-\nning for tourism and should enhance the destination commu-\nnity's abilities not only to implement the tourism plans but\nalso to retain control over the plans themselves. Parallel to the\nprocesses of local community education and awareness rais-\ning, an infrastructure for the documentation and presentation\nof traditional wisdom and heritage should be established.\nBecause the libraries in Serbia have been programmed as\n\"memory institutions,\" the establishment of a rural native\nfund, or local history collection, could be the new system\nsolution for cultural policy based on the documentation of tra-\nditional preindustrialization wisdom. This would be a first\nstep toward the physical availability of rural heritage to the\nlocal population and to visitors as well. The second step could\nbe horizontal multifunctional strategic partnerships among\nschools, community centers, and other stakeholders in the\ncountryside and the city. These efforts would address the\ndiversification of cultural and educational programs to inter-\npret the value and importance of heritage to modern society\nand thus render it emotionally and intellectually accessible to\ndifferent social groups in the towns and villages in Serbia. An\ninterpretation, as an integral part of the process of creating\nnarratives, could include educational programs for the devel-\nopment of skills and abilities to create programs and projects\ninspired by local heritages. In this way, the actors in the pub-\nlic, private, and civil society sector could create geographical\nand functional clusters, transferring competences, skills,\nexperience, contacts, and resources to each other. Finally, the\nthird step, which would encompass public activities and\ntheir associated promotion, could encourage local people to\nparticipate in the creation of native funds through gifts and\nlegacies, as well as to engage in the use of collected materials\nabout the origin and development of the village. This would\nincrease the number of users of library services (or \"native\nfund\" services), and allow these users to gain knowledge\nabout the history, economy, and culture of the total territory of\nthe municipality (both city as a centre and surrounding vil-\nlages). These activities could develop an awareness that the\nvillage as well as the city is contributing to the sustainable\ndevelopment of the region.\nThese steps seem rational and easy to implement. Thus,\nwe have no negative presumptions on how it would reflect\non the particular local community of Omoljica. Theories of\nterritorially driven cultural policy and CBT are a good start-\ning point for the local community because the valuing of\nlocal resources could bring people closer to their \"true core\nvalues.\" It is, however, possible that these \"core values\"\ncould turn out to be something other than expected, or not\ntaken into account, and that other elements could appear.\nEither way, an effort starting with small steps should be initi-\nated, which could begin with gathering the local community\ntogether so that they can begin to reflect on their surround-\nings, material and immaterial. Identifying and dealing with\nwhat is at the community's disposal would be a starting point\nfor the mapping and evaluation of resources, seen and felt by\nthe locals themselves.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnholt, S.
