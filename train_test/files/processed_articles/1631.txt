After adjustment for potential risk\nfactors, the relative hazard (RH) for adults with GHb 8% compared with adults with GHb 6%\ntality, and 2.64 (1.17\u00ad5.97) for cancer mortality. Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, having\nGHb 8% compared with GHb 6% was associated with higher all-cause mortality (RH 1.68,\nrisk of cancer mortality by GHb category. Among adults without diagnosed diabetes, there was\nno significant association of all-cause, heart disease, or cancer mortality and GHb category.\nCONCLUSIONS -- These results highlight the importance of GHb levels in mortality risk\namong a nationally representative sample of adults with and without diagnosed diabetes and\nindicate that higher levels are associated with increased mortality in adults with diabetes.\nHperglycemia has been associated\nwith a wide range of adverse out-\ncomes for individuals with glucose\nvalues both above and below the thresh-\nold for diabetes, including increased car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality\n(1). Studies have consistently found un-\ndiagnosed diabetes to be associated with\nincreased risk of mortality (2\u00ad4), and\nmany studies have also shown levels of\nglucose that are elevated, but not enough\nfor a diagnosis of diabetes, such as im-\npaired fasting glucose, to be associated\nwith increased mortality (2\u00ad4).\nHowever, most of these studies are\nbased on fasting or postprandial glucose\n(1\u00ad4), and few are based on GHb levels\n(3,5\u00ad8). The GHb level may be a better\nindicator of hyperglycemia because it\nprovides a measure of an individual's av-\nerage glucose levels for the previous 3\nmonths. Thus, it may provide a more sta-\nble snapshot of glucose levels when used\nin prospective cohort studies to examine\nthe association of subsequent risk. Cur-\nrently, GHb is monitored in the treatment\nof diabetes, and GHb targets for preven-\ntion of complications among individuals\nwith diabetes have been established (9).\nInterest in the use of GHb for the diagno-\nsis of diabetes is increasing (10), and an\ninternational effort is underway to stan-\ndardize the measurement of GHb (11).\nThis focus of GHb in clinical care mea-\nsures (12) raises important questions\nabout the long-term predictability of\nGHb.\nExamination of the relationship of\nGHb with mortality reveals several areas\nof uncertainty, including whether the re-\nlationship of GHb with mortality is simi-\nlar among individuals with and without\ndiabetes from both prospective cohort\nstudies and clinical trials. A few prospec-\ntive cohort studies have examined the as-\nsociation of GHb with risk of mortality\n(5\u00ad8) and shown an increased risk of\nmortality with increasing GHb level. Only\ntwo studies included individuals with di-\nabetes, but these studies did not examine\nGHb levels by diabetes status, and none\nwere representative of the general U.S.\npopulation.\nRecently published findings from\nthree clinical trials among adults with di-\nabetes have added to this uncertainty. The\nAction to Control Cardiovascular Risk in\nDiabetes (ACCORD) trial showed that\nlower GHb levels increased risk of mor-\ntality and did not decrease CVD events\n(13). Whereas the Action in Diabetes and\nVascular Disease--Preterax and Diami-\ncron Modified Release Controlled Evalu-\nation (ADVANCE) study showed that\nlowering of GHb levels was associated\nwith a decrease in micro- and macrovas-\ncular events and deaths from CVD (14)\nand the Veterans Administration Diabetes\nTrial reported that lower GHb levels were\nnot associated with a reduction in cardio-\nvascular events (15). These findings have\nnot led to any changes in glycemic control\nrecommendations (16).\nThe Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III) is\nthe first nationally representative survey\nto include a measure of GHb and has mor-\ntality status available through linkage to\nthe National Death Index. The objective\nof this study was to examine the associa-\ntion of GHb with subsequent mortality in\na nationally representative sample of U.S.\nadults.\nMETHODS -- We analyzed data\nwho were sampled as part of NHANES III.\nNHANES III was conducted between\nHealth Statistics.

The survey included a physical ex-\namination, laboratory tests, and question-\nnaires on health- and nutrition-related\ntopics. The overall response rate for\nadults aged 20 years who completed the\nMain exposure\nGHb was measured during the examina-\ntion for all adults aged 20 years. GHb\nmeasurements were standardized to the\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(17). We analyzed GHb levels as categor-\nical and continuous. For the categorical\nanalysis, GHb levels were classified as\n8%, and 8%. These levels were selected\nto correspond to the American Diabetes\nAssociation treatment guidelines (9).\nOther baseline assessments\nParticipants' age, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-\ncation, and personal health characteristics\nwere obtained by interview. Smoking sta-\ntus was categorized as current, past, or\nnever. Current smoking was defined as\nself-reported smoking of at least 100 cig-\narettes during one's lifetime and currently\nsmoking cigarettes. Physical examination\nincluded measuring waist circumference,\nheight, weight, and blood pressure and\ndrawing blood (17). BMI was calculated\nas weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters for each partic-\nipant from the measured height and\nweight. Systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsure was obtained from the mean of three\nto five blood pressure measurements. All\nlipid and lipoprotein analyses were con-\nducted on venous blood serum samples\n(17). For the present analysis, we chose\nHDL cholesterol levels as an indicator of\ncardiovascular risk; HDL is available for\nall adults.\nPreviously diagnosed diabetes was\ndetermined by self-report. Women who\nreported diagnosis of diabetes only dur-\ning pregnancy were not considered to\nhave diagnosed diabetes.\nOutcomes\nNHANES III participants aged 17 years\nwho had data available for matching were\nmatched to the National Death Index\n(NDI) to determine mortality status. The\nNDI was searched through 31 December\nIII and the NDI is conducted by probabi-\nlistic matching. The National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) conducted the\nlinkage and created scores for potential\nmatches. For a selected sample of\nNHANES III records, NCHS reviewed the\ndeath certificate record to verify correct\nNHANES III participants eligible for mor-\ntality follow-up by linkage with NDI, of\nceased. A complete description of the\nmethodology used to link NHANES III\nrecords to NDI is available (19). This\nstudy is based on the restricted-use\nNHANES III Linked Mortality File (20).\nThe underlying cause of death is\nHeart disease deaths were based on ICD-9\nI51.

Person-years of follow-up\nwas calculated for each participant based\non the end of follow-up minus the date of\nexamination in NHANES III.\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were weighted to the U.S.\npopulation using SUDAAN statistical\nsoftware (version 9.1; RTI International,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) to account\nfor the complex survey design and the\nstratified multistage cluster sample and to\nprovide nationally representative esti-\ntics, smoking status, body measurements,\nblood pressure, HDL cholesterol, diabetes\nstatus, and mean years of follow-up were\nreported for participants at baseline by\nGHb categories. Mortality per 1,000 per-\nson-years was calculated for each GHb\ncategory based on the weighted number\nof deaths and person-years. A log-linear\nPoisson model was used to calculate\nWe constructed proportional hazards\nmodels with GHb as both a categorical\nvariable and a continuous variable to de-\ntermine the relative hazard (RH) of mor-\ntality associated with various levels of\nGHb. We used age as the time scale for\nanalysis with left truncation. For cause-\nspecific analyses (i.e., cancer mortality or\ncardiovascular mortality), a participant\nwas censored at the age of death he or she\ndied from a cause other than the specific\ncause of death of interest. We report the\nresults for two proportional hazards mod-\nels. The first was adjusted for sex and\nrace/ethnicity. The second was adjusted\nfor sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-\ning status, BMI, systolic blood pressure,\nand HDL cholesterol. There was a signif-\nicant first-order interaction with GHb and\ndiagnosed diabetes (P  0.05) for all-\ncause and heart disease mortality. The re-\nsults are presented overall and stratified\nby diagnosed diabetes status. There were\nno other significant first-order multiplica-\ntive interactions between GHb and the\nTo examine the association of GHb\nlevels as a continuous variable with mor-\ntality, we graphed the relationship of GHb\nand death using the proportional hazard\nfunction to model GHb using a spline\nregression with three knots (22). Spline\nregression allows modeling of the rela-\ntionship between GHb as a continuous\nvariable and mortality to be nonlinear\nand allows examination of the function\nrelationship.\nRESULTS\nBaseline comparisons\nOverall, adults with GHb levels 6%\nwere younger with a mean age of 45 years\ncompared with 60 years for adults with\nGHb levels 6% (Table 1).

Adults with GHb\nbetween 7 and 8% or 8% were also\nmore likely to have risk factors for CVD\nincluding higher BMI, waist circumfer-\nence, and systolic blood pressure and\nlower HDL cholesterol than adults with\nOverall adult population\nAdults with GHb between 7 and 8%\nand those with GHb 8% had a higher\nrisk of all-cause mortality compared with\nadults with GHb 6%, even after adjust-\nment for potential confounders (Table 2).\nFigure 1A presents the relationship of\nSaydah and Associates\nGHb level and risk of all-cause mortality\nfor all participants aged 20 years after\nadjustment for potential confounders.\nThere seems to be a slight J-shaped rela-\ntionship; however, there is no significant\nincreased risk of all-cause mortality until\nGHb levels are 8%.\nAfter adjustment for potential con-\nfounders, there was a threefold increased\nrisk for heart disease mortality among all\nparticipants with GHb 8%, a 77% in-\ncreased risk among participants with\ncreased risk among participants with\nGHb between 6 and 7% compared with\nparticipants with GHb 6%.\nAfter adjustment for potential con-\nfounders, there was a greater than twofold\nrisk for cancer mortality among adults\nwith GHb 8% and no increased risk\namong participants with GHb between 7\nand 8% or 6 and 7% compared with par-\nticipants with GHb 6%.\nPopulation with diagnosed diabetes\nAmong adults with diagnosed diabetes,\nafter adjustment for potential confound-\ners, there was a 68% increased risk of all-\ncause mortality for those with GHb 8%\ncompared with individuals with GHb\n6% (Table 2).

Adults without diabetes and\nhad higher mortality than those with GHb\n8%, probably because of the small\nnumber of participants in the highest\nGHb category. The relationship of GHb\nlevel and risk of all-cause mortality for\nparticipants without diagnosed diabetes\nis similar to that for the overall population\nand appears to be a slight J-shaped rela-\ntionship (data not shown). There was also\nno increased risk for heart disease mortal-\nity or cancer mortality among adults with-\nout diagnosed diabetes associated with\nincreasing GHb category.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In this nationally\nrepresentative sample, among adults aged\n20 years, increasing GHb levels were\nassociated with increased risk of all-cause\nmortality, heart disease, and cancer mor-\ntality. However, this association is medi-\nated by the presence of diagnosed\ndiabetes. Among adults with diagnosed\ndiabetes, GHb 8% was associated with a\n70% increased risk from all-cause mortal-\nity and a 150% increased risk from heart\ndisease mortality. Among adults with di-\nagnosed diabetes and GHb between 6 and\n7% and 7 and 8%, there was no significant\nincreased risk of all-cause mortality.\nHowever, there was a 90% increased risk\nRace/ethnicity (%)*\nEducation (%)*\nSmoking status (%)*\nData are means  SEM. *P  0.05 based on ANOVA or 2.\nGHb and mortality among adults in the U.S.\nfor heart disease mortality for adults with\ndiabetes and GHb between 6 and 7%.\nThere was no significant association of\nGHb with mortality among adults with-\nout diagnosed diabetes.\nPrevious studies that have examined\nthe association of hyperglycemia and\nmortality using fasting glucose or post-\nchallenge glucose levels have also shown\nan increased risk of mortality with in-\ncreasing glucose levels (2\u00ad4). Hypergly-\ncemia is also associated with an increased\nrisk of incident CVD. A recent meta-\nanalysis of 38 reports of hyperglycemia\nas a risk factor for CVD found an in-\ncreased risk of CVD for all measures of\nhyperglycemia: fasting glucose, causal\nglucose, postchallenge glucose, and GHb\nlevel (1). Few of the studies included in\nthe meta-analysis were nationally repre-\nsentative, and some studies did not take\ndiabetes status into account. GHb levels\nthemselves have also been associated with\nan increased risk of incident disease in-\ncluding CVD among individuals with di-\nabetes (23) and colorectal cancer among\nindividuals with and without diabetes\nHowever, there is limited evidence on\nthe association of GHb with mortality ei-\nther among the diabetic population (25)\nor the general population (3,5\u00ad 8).\nAmong the diabetic population, one\nTable 2--RH (95% CI) for GHb and subsequent all-cause, heart disease, and cancer mortality among adults aged >20 years in NHANES III\nAll-cause mortality\nHeart disease mortality\nCancer mortality\nAll-cause mortality\nHeart disease mortality\nCancer mortality\nAll-cause mortality\nHeart disease mortality\nCancer mortality\nModel 1: with age as the time scale, adjusted for sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other).

There\nseems to be a slight J-shaped relationship\namong the overall population, whereas\nthere is a possible threshold effect in the\ndiabetic population. This possible J-shape\nrelationship was also observed in a study\nbased in New Zealand (5). These authors\nfound that GHb levels 7 and 4% were\nassociated with increased mortality com-\npared with GHb levels of 4\u00ad5%, among\nadults without a diagnosis of diabetes (5).\nThe American Diabetes Association\nrecommends GHb of 7% for most indi-\nviduals with diabetes (9). These recom-\nmendations are also promoted by the\nNational Diabetes Education Program\n(26) and are based on evidence from ran-\ndomized clinical trials showing that\nlowering GHb levels reduces diabetes mi-\ncrovascular complications (16) including\nCVD (16). The benefit of glucose control\nin preventing CVD in individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes is still uncertain. Recently,\nthree randomized clinical trials have ad-\ndressed the question of whether lowering\nglucose levels in individuals with type 2\ndiabetes, measured by GHb, to the levels\nof adults without diabetes would reduce\nmorbidity and mortality from CVD. The\nfindings from these trials have, however,\nadded uncertainty to this question\n(13,14), with two studies finding an in-\ncreased risk of mortality and one study\nfindings suggest that after taking into ac-\ncount other well-established CVD risk\nfactors, lowering GHb 8% does not re-\nsult in improvement in heart disease mor-\nFigure 1--RH of all-cause mortality for GHb levels compared with the referent of 4.8% (the 12.5th percentile, as indicated by the vertical line) among\nadults aged 20 years and older overall (A) and with diagnosed diabetes (B) in the U.S. NHANES III Linked Mortality File (19).

In fact, among adults with diabetes,\nthere was an increased risk of heart dis-\nease mortality associated with GHb be-\ntween 6 and 7%. Further studies are\nneeded to determine treatment strategies\nfor the prevention of CVD in individuals\nwith diabetes.\nThere are two main limitations of our\nanalysis. The first is that we had relatively\nfew deaths from certain causes and were,\ntherefore, unable to look at specific types\nof cancer or other causes. Based on the\nsmaller sample size for the population\nwith diagnosed diabetes and the smaller\nnumber of deaths from cancer, the study\nmay have been underpowered to detect a\nsignificant increase in risk. The second\nlimitation is that GHb was only measured\nat baseline, and we have no information\non how changes in GHb may or may not\nhave influenced a participant's risk of\nmortality.\nNonetheless, this study also has a\nnumber of strengths. First, NHANES III is\nthe first nationally representative survey\nto measure GHb levels among adults and\nthe first study to provide nationally rep-\nresentative estimates of the risk of mortal-\nity associated with GHb levels, and\nsecond, there was relatively little loss to\nfollow-up for mortality.\nIn summary, we found that GHb of\n8% was associated with a greater than\ntwofold increased risk of all-cause mortality\nin the overall population and 60% in-\ncreased risk for all-cause mortality among\nadults with diabetes. There was also a sig-\nnificant increased risk of heart disease over-\nall and for adults with diabetes.\n"
