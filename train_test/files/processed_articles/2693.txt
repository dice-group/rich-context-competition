    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica has one of the highest old-age life expectancies in the world, but\nthe underlying biological mechanisms of this longevity are not well understood. As DNA methylation is hypothesized\nto be a component of biological aging, we focused on this malleable epigenetic mark to determine its association\nwith current residence in Nicoya versus elsewhere in Costa Rica. Examining a population's unique DNA methylation\npattern allows us to differentiate hallmarks of longevity from individual stochastic variation. These differences may be\ncharacteristic of a combination of social, biological, and environmental contexts.\nMethods: In a cross-sectional subsample of the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study, we compared\nwhole blood DNA methylation profiles of residents from Nicoya (n = 48) and non-Nicoya (other Costa Rican regions,\nn = 47) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray.\nResults: We observed a number of differences that may be markers of delayed aging, such as bioinformatically\nderived differential CD8+ T cell proportions. Additionally, both site- and region-specific analyses revealed DNA meth\nylation patterns unique to Nicoyans. We also observed lower overall variability in DNA methylation in the Nicoyan\npopulation, another hallmark of younger biological age.\nConclusions: Nicoyans represent an interesting group of individuals who may possess unique immune cell propor\ntions as well as distinct differences in their epigenome, at the level of DNA methylation.\n",

The genetic component of life span is approxi-\nmated to be less than 30%, leaving the remainder to be\ndetermined by environmentally and socially influenced\nfactors such as diet, exposure to infection, and lifestyle\nchoices [1, 2]. While the mechanistic regulation of these\nnon-genetic influences is poorly understood, previous\nwork has suggested that epigenetic processes may be\ntightly interwoven with biological aging [3].\nEpigenetics generally refers to the study of altered\nchromatin states, such as modifications to DNA and\nthe proteins involved in its packaging and regula-\ntion. To date, DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most\ncommonly studied epigenetic mark in human popula-\ntions, as recent advances in technology have allowed\nfor the inexpensive high-throughput measurement\nmany other studied epigenetic processes, such as post-\ntranslational histone modifications, histone variants,\nand noncoding RNAs; however, these modifications\nhave been more of a focus in model organism research\nand cancer biology.\nOpen Access\nEpigenetics & Chromatin\n*Correspondence: drehkopf@stanford.edu\n4 Division of General Medical Disciplines, Department of Medicine, School\nof Medicine, Stanford University, 1070 Arastradero Road, Suite 300, Palo\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nDNAm is one type of epigenetic modification that\nimpacts how genes are expressed and thus can have\nimportant phenotypic and functional consequences for\nan organism. Unlike the DNA sequence itself, DNAm is\nchangeable through environmental influences over an\nindividual's life course. DNAm involves the covalent addi-\ntion of a methyl group to the 5 carbon of cytosine nuce-\nlotides, most often in the context of CpG dinucleotides\n(cytosine\u00adphosphate\u00adguanine). Genetic variants, such\nas single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can affect\nDNAm at nearby CpG sites, called methylation quanti-\ntative trait loci (mQTL) [4]. DNAm also varies in asso-\nciation with environmental and behavioral factors, such\nas diesel exposure and smoking. Additionally, variability\nin DNAm accumulates across one's entire life span, dis-\ncussed in detail below. DNAm patterns are associated\nwith altered gene activity. Shifts in DNAm levels may\nfollow a change in gene expression, or may act in the\nrecruitment of methylation-dependent transcription fac-\ntors that regulate transcriptional machinery. Understand-\ning the effect of environmental influences on DNAm\nis important for unraveling the intricate regulation of\ngenes and possible functional consequences of these\nalterations.\nAge-related DNAm encompasses at least two distinct\nphenomena. First, specific CpGs associated with chrono-\nlogical age have been identified and, in some cases, rep-\nlicated in several human populations. These age-related\nDNAm signatures can be either tissue specific or occur\nacross several tissue types [5]. The epigenetic clock is a\ntool based on CpGs that change with age. Epigenetic\nclocks are DNAm-based markers of biological age, either\nconfined to a single tissue or consistently accurate across\ntissues [6\u00ad8]. Deviations from these epigenetic age esti-\nmates, referred to as a measure of age acceleration,\nhave been associated with an increased risk of all-cause\nmortality, time until death, and frailty [9\u00ad11]. Second,\nvariability increases with age due to stochastic non-site-\nspecific changes in DNAm, a process referred to as epige-\nIt is critical to address cell-type heterogeneity when\ninvestigating DNAm patterns in tissues containing\nmixed cell types. Not only does cell type change over\none's life span but it is also the primary source of varia-\ntion in DNAm across healthy individuals. DNAm profiles\nobtained from identical cell types, but separate individu-\nals, show higher similarity than two different cell types\nfrom the same individual [13]. Given that isolating DNA\nfrom a single cell type is not always feasible or that cell\ncount information is sometimes not available, bioinfor-\nmatics-based methods have been developed to estimate\ncell-type proportions using DNAm profiles in blood and\nbrain [14, 15]. The blood-based predictions are closely\ncorrelated with complete blood count measures, thus\nsuggesting the validity of these methods to derive accu-\nrate blood count information bioinformatically [16]. It is\nalso worth noting that measures of epigenetic age accel-\neration specific to whole blood have been defined to\naccount for age-induced changes to cell-type proportions\n[6]. These measures are integral when analyzing DNAm\nfrom whole blood, as the proportion of certain blood cell\ntypes, such as CD8+ memory and na\u00efve T cells, change\nAging research in humans commonly investigates the\nunique biological and lifestyle characteristics of individu-\nals surviving to old age [18]. An alternative approach,\nused in the current study design, is to examine the under-\nlying biology of longevity by examining a population\ncharacterized as having a particularly high old-age life\nexpectancy [19], the Nicoya region of Costa Rica, and\ncomparing it to the rest of Costa Rica which has mod-\nerately lower life expectancy. By averaging out the sto-\nchastic variation in aging among individuals within each\ngeographic region of the country, this approach offers a\nway to identify contextual (rather than individual) differ-\nences associated with healthy aging and longevity. While\nthe method of examining area-based determinants of\nhealth and longevity has received substantial attention\nin biomedical research [20], a lack of appropriate data\nsources have limited its application in understanding the\nbiological mechanisms of longevity.\nThe Nicoya peninsula of Costa Rica has been char-\nacterized by exceptionally high longevity, providing an\nintriguing framework to explore the relationship between\nDNAm and aging [21]. Mortality rates among elderly\nCosta Ricans in Nicoya are substantially lower than in the\nrest of Costa Rica, with individuals in Nicoya being some\nof the most long lived in the world. The relative mortal-\nity rate of Nicoya as compared to similar age cohorts in\nthe rest of Costa Rica is 0.80. This advantage remains sig-\nnificant after statistical control for level of education and\ntype of health insurance [21]. The Nicoyan advantage is\nparticularly evident in cardiovascular disease, despite the\nfact that risk factors like smoking, physical activity and\nsystolic blood pressure are similar throughout Costa Rica.\nOne key indicator of the Nicoyan advantage is longer knee\nheight--an anthropometric biomarker that is associated\nwith early childhood environment [22]. Nicoyans also\nhave lower BMI, waist circumference, and, among men,\nlower levels of HbA1c, glucose, triglycerides and total/\nHDL cholesterol ratio [21]. We have previously shown\nthat leukocyte telomere length, an aging biomarker, also\nhas more favorable (longer) levels among Nicoyans com-\npared to individuals in the rest of Costa Rica [23].\nIn this study, we examined DNAm in a nationally rep-\nresentative population of Costa Ricans, investigating\npotential biological differences that may help explain the\nhigher longevity observed in Nicoyans as compared to\nother Costa Ricans. We focused on DNAm, as this epi-\ngenetic mark can be modified by environmental influ-\nences, has the potential to regulate gene expression, and\nmost importantly, has an established relationship with\naging across the mammalian life span. Using genome-\nwide DNAm patterns to predict blood cell-type composi-\ntion, we determined differential estimated proportions of\nage-related immune cells. While we did not observe dif-\nferences in epigenetic age acceleration, we did find signif-\nicantly decreased DNAm variability in Nicoyans. Finally,\nwe identified DNAm patterns unique to Nicoyans, at\nboth genomic regions and specific CpG sites. Under-\nstanding DNAm patterns between Nicoyans and other\nCosta Ricans (non-Nicoyans) will offer new insights both\ninto the role of DNAm in aging and perhaps help to illu-\nminate why Nicoyans have among the longest old-age life\nexpectancies.\nResults\nCohort characteristics and DNA methylation data\nWe examined a subset of samples from the Costa Rican\nStudy on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), a lon-\ngitudinal, nationally representative, and probabilistic\nthat were collected mostly in 2005, with over-sampling\nof older ages [24]. We assayed DNAm profiles of 48\nNicoyans (longevity group) and 47 non-Nicoyans (con-\ntrol group). In order to maximize statistical power for\nour age-based hypothesis, we randomly sampled half of\nthe individuals between the ages of 60 and 75 and the\nother half aged 95 and above, selecting an equal number\nin each age category among Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans\nto have an age-matched sample. Table 1 shows the mean\ncharacteristics of these populations. Nicoyans tend to\nhave lower levels of education and lower wealth than\nnon-Nicoyans, but are similar on observed health-related\ncharacteristics. We obtained DNAm profiles from whole\narray, a genome-wide microarray that quantifies DNAm\nremove poor performing probes, probes that hybridized\nthe XY chromosomes, and probes predicted to cross-\nhybridize [25]. Our final dataset for subsequent analyses\nNicoyans had fewer estimated CD8+ memory and more\nna\u00efve T cells than nonNicoyans\nWhole blood is a heterogeneous tissue containing cer-\ntain cell types that change with age, with age-related\ndecreases occurring in CD8+ T, CD4+ T and B lym-\nphocytes, and the greatest increases in natural killer\ncells and monocytes [26]. To assess these differences in\nour cohort, we performed a previously described blood\ncell-type deconvolution [14] by using the DNAm profiles\nof each sample to estimate the proportions of granulo-\ncytes, natural killer cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+\nT lymphocytes, monocytes, and B lymphocytes. We\nfound that Nicoyans had a significantly lower propor-\ntion of estimated CD8+ T cells when compared to non-\nWe also observed that Nicoyans had a higher mean\nlevel of estimated granulocyte proportions, although\nonly reaching borderline significance (Kruskal\u00adWallis p\nvalue = 0.0486). It is important to note that we did not\nfocus on the blood composition as a whole, as we were\nprimarily interested in specific age-related cell-type\ntrends.\nTo further investigate the differential proportion of\nestimated CD8+ T cells, we applied a more detailed cell\ndeconvolution tool that provides an expanded estima-\n[6]. CD8+ T memory cells typically increase with age,\nand CD8+ T na\u00efve cells generally decrease with age\nthrough thymic involution [27]. Given that these meas-\nures are proportional and highly correlated, it is statisti-\ncally appropriate to assess the ratio of CD8+ T na\u00efve\ncells to CD8+ T memory cells (Additional file 1: Figure\nS1). Using this approach, we found a significant difference\nbetween Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans (Kruskal\u00adWallis p\nvalue = 0.0135). We observed a greater abundance of pre-\ndicted CD8+ T na\u00efve cells in Nicoyans and a lower abun-\ndance of estimated CD8+ T memory cells in Nicoyans, as\nTable\nCohort characteristics (means and percents),\nNicoyans and non-Nicoyans\nStandard deviations are shown in parenthesis.

We hypothesized that lower\nvariability in Nicoyans would be representative of a bio-\nlogically younger profile based on the epigenetic drift\nphenomenon where stochastic variation in DNAm occurs\nwith age. We calculated the interquantile range (IQR) at\neach CpG site (90th\u00ad10th percentile) represented on the\n450k array to account for outliers and found a significant\nvariability difference between Nicoyans and non-Nicoy-\nlower level of total mean DNAm variation in Nicoyans\n(Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we assessed the level of DNAm\nvariability across individuals between 60 and 80 years\nold and individuals >80 years old, in Nicoyans and non-\nNicoyans. We found a lower DNAm variability in the\nyounger group, in both populations. However, there was\na greater difference between the non-Nicoyan old and\nyoung age groups compared to the Nicoyans respective\nage groups (non-Nicoya: IQR mean difference = 0.0065,\nold of 5% was applied to only variable sites, we found\nrange of Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans, respectively.

We aimed to identify unique patterns\nof DNAm that may underlie biological pathways associ-\nated with the longevity observed in Nicoya. Our study\nsample was drawn from a nationally representative demo-\ngraphic study of Costa Ricans age 60 years and over, and\nwe randomly sampled individuals from within Nicoya and\nand above in order to assess age-associated DNAm. We\nhave four primary findings. First, we observed a bioin-\nformatically inferred younger immune profile in Nicoyan\nindividuals compared to those living in the rest of Costa\nRica, finding cellular proportion differences in CD8+\nna\u00efve and CD8+ memory T cells. Next, we found a lower\nlevel of total mean DNAm variation in Nicoyans compared\nto non-Nicoyans. We found 20 DMRs and four single CpG\nsites that were differentially methylated between Nicoy-\nans and non-Nicoyans. While any of these differences we\nobserved may be due to genetic differences in the popula-\ntions, the fact that we show that estimated genetic struc-\nture did not differ between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans\nsuggests that these biological differences are more likely to\nbe the result of environmental differences between these\ntwo populations. Lastly, DNAm age was not significantly\ndifferent between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans, although\nCosta Ricans overall had a younger mean DNAm age than\nthe mean chronological age.\nOur finding of proportional differences in CD8+ na\u00efve\nand CD8+ memory T cells is intriguing in the context\nof previous work from animal models and other human\nresearch that has established that these blood cell pro-\nportions change as a function of age. Specifically, the\nna\u00efve T cell response diminishes with time as they are\nnaturally replaced by memory T cells through age-related\nthymic involution [17, 29]. Therefore, younger immune\nprofiles have been hypothesized to delay the onset of\ninfection vulnerability and extend health span [30]. Inter-\nestingly, centenarian offspring have been investigated in\nthis context and show this `youthful' immune cell pheno-\ntype [31]. The fact that our work suggested that Nicoy-\nans had a lower proportion of CD8+ T memory cells and\nhigher CD8+ T na\u00efve cells is interesting in the context of\nimmunoaging and might be suggestive of an age-related\nimmune phenotype in Nicoyans.\nGiven their lower mortality rate, we were surprised\nabout the lack of differences in DNAm age between\nNicoyans non-Nicoyans, especially given that this bio-\nlogical aging measure has been associated with many\nage-related conditions such as cognitive fitness decline,\nfrailty, and mortality [9, 11, 32]. It is important to note,\nhowever, that we only had the statistical power to test for\na very large difference in DNAm age, and our 95% con-\nfidence interval suggests that Nicoyan individuals could\nbe up to 6 years younger in DNAm age. We calculated\nepigenetic age in our samples using three published\nDNAm age predictors and found no significant difference\nin these measures of biological age between Nicoyans\nand non-Nicoyans. Previous work found that peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells from the offspring of semi-super\ncentenarians, in an Italian cohort, appear 5.1 years epige-\nnetically younger than controls. Centenarians also were\nreportedly 8.6 years younger than their chronological age\n[33]. This is consistent with our population; when we col-\nlapsed the Nicoyan and non-Nicoyan groups, we found\ncentenarians were 12.7 years epigenetically younger. Fur-\nthermore, all Costa Ricans were 6.9 years epigenetically\nyounger than their chronological age. It is possible that\nthis might reflect the recently reported epigenetically\nyounger phenotype in Hispanic populations [34].\nTo examine age-associated DNAm variability, we\nassessed a measure of variance in Nicoyans and non-\nNicoyans independently. We were able to demonstrate\nthe phenomenon of epigenetic drift within each of these\ngroups, as our sample consisted of two age ranges in each\ngroup. Additionally, we observed that DNAm variation\nwas lower in Nicoyans, both in the 80-year-old and in the\n>80-year-old age groups, when compared to non-Nicoyans.\nGiven that DNAm variability across individuals has been\nreported to increase with age, our finding may highlight an\nepigenetic characteristic of the longevity in Nicoyans [12].\nAlthough the biological pre- and antecedents of increased\nDNAm variability are poorly understood, our findings\nsuggest lower DNAm variability may be associated with\nlower mortality. Some explanations for this age-associated\nDNAm variability have been proposed, such that DNAm\nvariability may result from a functional decline in DNAm\nmaintenance machinery or that the variability is a product\nof environmental exposures over time [35].\nWe found 20 genomic regions and four single CpGs that\nwere significantly differentially methylated between Nicoy-\nans and non-Nicoyans. One such DMR contained six\nCpGs and was located in the promoter region of NUDT12,\na gene encoding a protein shown in vitro to cleave NADH,\nNADPH, and NAD+ [36]. Given that NUDT12 may play a\nrole in NAD metabolism, a regulatory process associated\nwith health span and aging, it is consistent with the fact\nthat DNAm may be involved in the regulation of this gene\nthat may have downstream effects on NAD biosynthe-\nsis. Nicoyans had a lower level of DNAm in the promoter\nregion of NUDT12, a signature often associated with\nhigher gene expression. In addition to our DMR findings,\nwe also found four individual sites to be both statistically\nand biologically significant, three of which existed in inter-\ngenic regions. We further investigated three of these CpGs\nby quantifying DNAm with pyrosequencing, allowing us\nto verify both the accuracy of the 450k array and the sig-\nnificant differences between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether differential DNAm\nof these single CpGs or DMRs, at the observed effect sizes\n(<10%), are sufficient to yield a biological change. Inter-\npretation of these findings at a biological level will require\nfuture mechanistic experiments.\nOur findings should be interpreted within the context\nof several limitations. One limitation was the lack of gen-\notype information for these samples, as genetic variation\nis considerably associated with DNAm [37]. In order to\nreduce genetic heterogeneity, we restricted control sam-\npling to areas within Costa Rica, but outside of Nicoya.\nNicoyan status is determined as of the time of the survey,\ni.e., at older ages, not based on birth or life-course resi-\ndence, but in our sample 44 out of 48 Nicoyan residents\nhave lived there their entire lives. While there are no docu-\nmented differences between the historical migration pat-\nterns of the inhabitants of Nicoya and the rest of Costa\nRica, minor differences may exist. Therefore, we imple-\nmented a recently published tool to infer genetic informa-\ntion using DNAm data obtained from the 450k array called\n`Epistructure,' a tool from the python package GLINT [28].\nWe found no significant difference in population structure\nmeasures between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans and thus\ndid not include these composite measures in our analy-\nses. Another consideration of our study results is that we\nused a bioinformatics approach to predict CD8+ T cell\nproportions, which are relative compositional estimates.\nAs these predictions do not estimate actual cell counts,\nthe abundance of other cell types will affect the propor-\ntional estimate of the CD8+ T cells. Ideally, we will need\nto validate our findings using a quantitative approach,\nsuch as fluorescent-activated cell sorting, to obtain actual\ncell counts. We note, perhaps not surprisingly, that we did\nnot observe a significant difference when we performed\nan overall compositional analysis of these predictions [38],\nmeaning that the blood composition overall was not dif-\nferent between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans. However, our\nfindings are supported by using two separate reference-\nbased approaches [6, 14], both of which identified CD8+ T\ncells as being significantly different between Nicoyans and\nnon-Nicoyans. Furthermore, these bioinformatic cell-type\nproportion predictions have been well validated in the lit-\nerature when compared to actual cell counts, and so we\nwere confident that this approach reflected true cell-type\nConclusions\nOur findings thus highlight DNAm as a potential fac-\ntor underlying the unique longevity observed in Nicoya\nregion of Costa Rica. This work also supports the\ndemographic data on longevity as characterizing this\npopulation as unique. The specific differences in immune\ncell proportions we observed in Nicoyans will lay the\nframework for a validation study to observe whether\ncell-sorting experiments yield similar results. Addition-\nally, the differential DNAm findings may provide a candi-\ndate list of CpGs to test for differences in other longevity\npopulations. Lastly, upon validating our findings, our\nwork will contribute to narrowing the focus of mechanis-\ntic studies to assess whether the DNAm differences we\nobserved are involved in gene regulation that may alter\ngene expression trajectories.\nMethods\nSample preparation and data collection\nWhole blood was collected from participants and\ngenomic DNA was extracted at the University of Costa\nRica from 2 ml of frozen whole blood using the phenol\u00ad\nchloroform method. DNA was bisulfite converted with\nthe Zymo Research EZ DNA MethylationTM Kit (Irvine,\nCA, USA). Approximately 160 ng of bisulfite-converted\nDNA from each sample, with the addition of one tech-\nnical replicate, was randomized across eight 450k array\nBeadChips as well as sentrix row and run in one batch\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol (San Diego, CA,\nQiagen Pyromark Assay Design 2.0 software (Hilden,\nGermany) was used to generate pyrosequencing assays\ntargeted to three 450k array CpGs. Pyrosequencing was\nperformed on the a Qiagen PyromarkTM Q96 (Hilden,\nGermany) according to manufacturer's instructions. All\nprimer sequences are listed in Additional file 6: Table S1.\nData preprocessing and normalization\nIllumina GenomeStudio software (San Diego, CA, USA)\nwas used to subtract background noise and color correct\nraw data using control probes. Data were extracted in the\nform of an average  value matrix and imported into R\nStatistical software for the remainder of data processing.\nLogit-transformed  values to M values, a less heterosce-\ndastic value, were used for all statistical analyses, whereas\n values were used for visualization purposes as they rep-\nresent percent methylation (0 = no methylation, 1 = fully\nmethylated). We have included a comparison table of \nvalues compared to M values for CpGs identified in the\nsite-specific differential methylation analysis (Additional\nAll data processing and statistical analyses were imple-\nmented in R version 3.2.3. We removed a subset of probes\nthat could potentially lead to erroneous results. These\nconsisted of 65 SNP control probes, probes that were\nspecific to either the X or Y sex chromosomes, probes\nwith missing  values or with a detection p  0.01 in 5\nor more samples, polymorphic CpG probes, and cross-\nhybridizing XY probes. The total number of probes post-\nsample outliers were removed, defined as having more\nthan 5% of their total probes fail.\nSubset-quantile within array normalization (SWAN)\nwas used to account for type I and II probe differences\non the 450k array [39]. Known technical variation (sen-\ntrix ID and position) was accounted for with the func-\ntion `ComBat' [40]. Confirmation of these corrections\nwas assessed before and after using principal component\nanalysis.\nEstimation of blood cell proportions\nA validated cellular deconvolution method was used\nto estimate cell-type proportions in each blood sample,\nnamely CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, B\ncells, monocytes and granulocytes [16]. The predicted\nabundance levels of CD8+ T na\u00efve and CD8+ T memory\nwere obtained from the `Advanced Blood Analysis' of the\nonline DNAm age predictor [6]. Significance values were\ngenerated from performing a Kruskal\u00adWallis test for\neach cell-type proportion by group.\nPrediction of epigenetic age\nThree epigenetic clocks were used to predict biological\nage. The `Horvath' and `Hannum' estimates were computed\nwith the online epigenetic clock software [6, 7]. The `Wei-\ndner' age prediction was generated using the previously\ndescribed 99 CpG model [41]. We investigated, to the best\nof our ability, the possibility that this finding was due to\na global batch effect influencing all samples by perform-\ning the DNAm age calculation on raw data, after SWAN\nnormalization data, and again after ComBat correction.\nIn all cases, the mean DNAm age for all Costa Ricans was\nyounger than the mean chronological age. We chose to\nproceed with calculating DNAm age using the most cor-\nrected data as we expected data that is corrected for tech-\nnical batch effects, inclusive of probe design and chip\u00adchip\nvariance, to best represent true biological signal.\nDNA methylation analysis\nThe R package `DMRcate' was used to find DMRs [42].\nThe DMRcate model contained Nicoya group, chrono-\nlogical age, sex, and estimated cell-type proportions. This\ntool uses a Gaussian kernel smoothing of DNAm across\nthe genome. Benjamini\u00adHochberg (BH) method was\napplied with a threshold of  0.05 and a  value differ-\nSite-specific differential DNAm analysis was con-\nducted using moderated t-statistics with empirical\nBayesian variation estimation using the bioconductor R\npackage `limma' with chronological age, sex, and cell-type\nproportions as covariates [44]. M values consisted of log-\ntransformed  values to achieve a measure with uniform\nvariation and decreased heteroscedasticity. Significance\nvalues were corrected for multiple testing using the BH\nDNAm variability was calculated using the interquan-\ntile range (IQR) across the 90th and 10th percentiles of\neach group, independently, at each CpG. A significance\nvalue was generated by performing a Wilcoxon signed-\nrank test between groups.\nInferred genetic ancestry\nPopulation structure was inferred using the `Epistructure'\ncommand-line tool GLINT [28]. This method applies\nprincipal component analysis on a reference list of\ngenetically informative 450k array probes. This tool sug-\ngests the top two principal components can infer genetic\nstructure. Linear regression was used for comparison of\neach PC and group status, while adjusting for sex, cell-\ntype proportions, and age.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
