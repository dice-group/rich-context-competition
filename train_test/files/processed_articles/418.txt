Perchlorate can\nalso form naturally in the atmosphere (Dasgupta et al., 2005)\nleading to trace levels in precipitation and is concentrated\ngeologically in some locations such as regions of west Texas\n(Dasgupta et al., 2005) and northern Chile (Urbansky et al.,\n2001). A combination of human activities and natural\nsources has led to the widespread presence of perchlorate in\nthe environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) included perchlorate on the Drinking Water Candi-\ndate Contaminant List and requires public water systems to\nmonitor and report perchlorate in drinking water (EPA,\nat least once in 4.1% of community drinking water systems\nfrom 26 different states and two territories, with levels\nranging from the method detection limit of 4 mg/l to a\nfrom the diet is likely, due to the contamination of vegetable\ncrops irrigated with perchlorate-containing water (Yu et al.,\n2004) or fertilized with Chilean nitrate (Urbansky et al.,\n2001). Milk can also contain perchlorate, possibly from\nperchlorate contamination of forage crops (Kirk et al., 2003;\nThe prevalence of trace levels of perchlorate in the\nenvironment leads to human exposure. Environmental\nperchlorate exposure is of possible health concern because\nmuch larger doses of perchlorate have been shown to\ncompetitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid gland\ninhibition of iodide uptake could potentially lead to\nhypothyroidism. The thyroid plays a crucial role in energy\nhomeostasis and neurological development. Hypothyroidism\ncan lead to metabolic problems in adults and abnormal\ndevelopment in children (Braverman and Utiger, 2000).\nUseful human exposure data can be obtained by directly\nmeasuring levels of an environmental toxicant in the human\nbody (i.e., biomonitoring) (Pirkle et al., 1995). Urinary\nperchlorate provides a reasonable measure of human\nexposure because 70\u00ad95% of a perchlorate dose is excreted\nunchanged in the urine with a half-life of B8 h (Anbar et al.,\nselective methods are needed to quantify perchlorate anion in\nurine in the presence of much higher levels of chloride, sulfate\nand phosphate anions. We recently developed a sensitive and\n1. Address all correspondence to: Dr Benjamin C.

In this paper, we have applied this method\nto measure perchlorate in urine samples collected from a\nrepresentative sample of 2820 persons, aged 6 years and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nSubjects and methods\nStudy Design\nNHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC). This survey is designed to assess the health and\nnutrition status of the civilian, non-institutionalized US\npopulation (CDC, 2004). The sampling design for NHANES\nis based on a complex multistage probability design, which\nincludes selection of primary sampling units (counties),\nhousehold segments within the counties and finally sample\npersons from selected households. Data were collected\nthrough a household interview and a standardized physical\nexamination, which was conducted in a mobile examination\nwere collected from each participant, aged 6 years and older,\nduring one of three daily scheduled examination periods (i.e.,\nmorning, afternoon and early evening). Sociodemographic\ninformation and medical histories of the survey participant\nand the family were collected during the household interview.\nthroughout the US (CDC, 2004), with a random one-third\nsubsample consisting of 2892 NHANES study participants\ncollectively representing the civilian, non-institutionalized\nUS population, aged 6 years and older. Overall, the survey\ninterview response rate was 83.9% and the exam response\nrate was 79.6%. Perchlorate measurements were conducted\non the 2820 study participants with available urine specimen.\nDemographic Variables\nSociodemographic data were self-reported by study partici-\npants. Age was grouped as children (6\u00ad11 years), adolescents\nThird National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental\nChemicals (CDC, 2005). Similarly, a race/ethnicity variable\nwas derived from self-reported questionnaire data, resulting\nin four categories of race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican Americans and others. Non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were over-sampled\nas part of NHANES; urinary perchlorate data were weighted\nto adjust for this oversampling (CDC, 2004). Data are not\npresented separately for the `other race/ethnic groups'\nbecause of the small number of individuals in this group;\nhowever, these individuals are included in the analyses of\nthe overall population and age and sex population groups.\nTable 1 provides the study population characteristics by age,\nsex and race-ethnicity.\nLaboratory Methods\nDuring the physical examinations, spot urine specimens were\ncollected from participants, aliquoted, and stored cold\n(2\u00ad41C) or frozen until shipment. Samples collected for\nperchlorate measurements were shipped on dry ice to the\nCDC's National Center for Environmental Health. Urine\nsamples were stored frozen (\u00c0701C) for 3\u00ad4 years. Experi-\nments evaluating storage at \u00c0701C for 42 years indicate no\nchanges in urinary perchlorate levels under these storage\nconditions. Urinary perchlorate was analyzed using the\nmethod of Valentin-Blasini et al. (2005). Briefly, 0.5 ml of\nurine was spiked with an isotopically labeled internal\nstandard and diluted 1:1 with deionized water. This solution\nwas subsequently analyzed using ion chromatography\u00ad\nelectrospray ionization\u00adtandem mass spectrometry. Perchlo-\nrate was quantified based on the peak area ratio of analyte to\nstable isotope-labeled internal standard. Two quality control\npools were analyzed in each analytical batch with unknown\nsamples. Reported results met the accuracy and precision\nspecifications of the quality control/quality assurance\nprogram of the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National\nCenter for Environmental Health, CDC (similar to rules\noutlined by Westgard (Westgard et al., 1981)). During\nanalysis of urine for perchlorate, we analyzed these two\nquality control pools multiple times (n \u00bc 117) with an\nbility of the assay was evaluated by re-analysis of 5% of the\nsamples, yielding an average relative percent difference of\nassay accuracy was verified by the blind analysis of four\nTable 1.

We assessed per-\nchlorate contamination by lot screening all reagents and\nanalyzing blanks with each batch of unknowns; no\ncontamination problems were identified.\nUrinary creatinine concentrations were determined using an\nautomated colorimetric method on a Beckman Synchron\nAS/ASTRA clinical analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc., Brea,\nCA, USA) at the Coulston Foundation (Alamogordo, NM,\nUSA) in 2001 and Collaborative Laboratory Services (Ottum-\ntions were adjusted using creatinine concentrations to correct for\nvariable water excretion rates in the spot urine samples.\nEstimation of Total Daily Perchlorate Dose\nWe estimated total daily perchlorate dose based on measured\nspot urine perchlorate and creatinine concentrations, and\nestimated daily creatinine excretion rate (g/day) computed\nfrom each individual's measured weight, height, age and sex.\nSpecifically, daily creatinine excretion was calculated for\nadults based on the Cockcroft\u00adGault equation (Cockcroft\nDaily perchlorate dose was then estimated using the\nfollowing formula:\nPerchlorate dose \u00bc mg perchlorate=g urinary creatinine\n\u00c3 g creatinine=day \u00c3 l=wt\u00f0kg\u00de\nDaily perchlorate dose is not presented for children and\nadolescents due to the limited validation of formulas for these\nage groups. Also, we assumed that 100% of perchlorate\nintake is absorbed and excreted unmetabolized in the urine\nleads to underestimation of perchlorate dose in lactating\nwomen because perchlorate is secreted in human milk\nBased on questionnaire data, only 26 study participants were\nactively lactating during the study period.\nStatistical Analysis\nUnivariate and regression analysis of perchlorate data used\nsurvey-specific sample weights to account for differential\nprobabilities of selection and non-response. Geometric means\nand percentiles of urinary perchlorate were calculated using\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,\nUSA), with CI estimated based on the method of Korn\nand Graubard (1998). SUDAAN PROC REGRESS was\nused for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of perchlorate\nlevels with predictor variables of age group, sex, race/\nethnicity, fasting and urinary creatinine. The ANCOVA\nmodel used to calculate the adjusted geometric means\nincluded a continuous variable for urinary creatinine and\nfasting (o8 h since last meal or Z8 h), sex and race/ethnicity\ngroups. Separate adjusted means are provided for sex by\nrace/ethnicity groups because of significant interaction\nbetween these two groups. Estimates of the CI were\ncalculated using the Taylor series linearization method\nTable 2.

We applied an ANCOVA model\nto further evaluate the higher levels of unadjusted urinary\nperchlorate observed in children compared with adolescents\nand adults. The adjusted geometric means for urinary\nperchlorate levels in each demographic group are shown in\nTable 4 and Figure 1.

Based on these results,\nperchlorate exposure appears to be wide-spread in the US\npopulation. Human exposure to perchlorate may occur via\nseveral different routes. Perchlorate from both natural and\nTable 3.

Exposure can also result from inhalation of dust\ncontaining perchlorate, especially in occupational settings\n(Gibbs et al., 1998). Measuring perchlorate in human urine\nassesses the combined exposure from all sources.\nThe demographic group with the highest levels of urinary\nperchlorate was children, similar to previously published\nresults for urinary iodine (Caldwell et al., 2005). Covariate-\nadjusted urinary perchlorate levels were statistically higher\nin children compared with both adolescents and adults,\neven after adjusting for urinary creatinine (Table 4). These\nage-associated differences in urinary perchlorate levels could\nrepresent differences in pharmacokinetics, the relationship of\ndose per body weight and/or exposure. For example, dietary\nhabits such as the consumption of milk and green leafy\nvegetables vary across age and ethnicity groups. Samples of\ndairy milk and green-leafy vegetables have been reported to\nincreased consumption of these foods could increase\nperchlorate exposure (Blount et al., 2006).\nSeveral small studies have also found measurable per-\nchlorate levels in human urine or milk. For 61 adults living\nin Georgia, all urine samples contained measurable levels\nof perchlorate, with a median of 3.2 mg/l and a log\u00adnormal\ndistribution (Valentin-Blasini et al., 2005). Similar back-\nground levels of perchlorate (median 5.5 mg/l) were detected\nin urine from 13 subjects in a Southern California study\nmeasurable levels of perchlorate in all samples of breast milk\ncollected from 36 women residing in 18 different states (mean\nOther previously published studies did not report measur-\nable background levels of perchlorate, likely due to\ninadequate analytical sensitivity (Lawrence et al., 2000;\n2005); therefore, application of these methods resulted in\nreported urinary background values of less than method\nlevels of urinary perchlorate were found in populations in\nnorthern Chile consuming tap water with perchlorate levels\nperchlorate levels in these highly exposed Chilean popula-\ntions (median 35 mg/l) were significantly higher than the levels\nfound in this study.\nOccupational exposure to perchlorate can lead to levels\nand doses that are much higher than those observed for this\nsample of the US population (Gibbs et al., 1998; Lamm\ndata indicate that less than 10,000 US workers actively\nhandle perchlorate (CDC, 1995). This small number of\nworkers should have a minimal impact on population\nestimates presented here.\nMeasurement of a single spot urine sample was used to\nassess individual exposure. Urinary perchlorate levels are\nTable 4.

Geometric means and 95th percentile confidence intervals for\nurinary perchlorate (mg/l), adjusted by analysis of covariance for race/\nethnicity, sex, age, fasting and urinary creatinine for ages 6 and older,\nBlount et al.\npresented both as micrograms per liter and as micrograms\nper gram of urinary creatinine to allow for comparisons\nbetween different demographic groups and adjustment for\ndifferences in urinary dilution (Barr et al., 2005). For a single\nperson, more precise exposure estimates could be derived\nby averaging perchlorate levels from two or three spot urine\nsamples. However, for population estimates such as geo-\nmetric means and percentiles, results of multiple persons are\naveraged. For these point estimates, use of a single spot urine\nsample from each individual would constitute one source\nof random error, not bias. As a source of random error, this\nwould lead to less statistical power to detect differences in\nperchlorate levels between groups of interest.\nUrine is the principal route by which non-lactating\nhumans excrete perchlorate (Anbar et al., 1959; Lawrence\net al., 2000). During lactation human mammary tissue\nexpresses the sodium iodide symporter (Wolff, 1998), and\nthus significant transfer of perchlorate into human milk is\nlikely. The presence of micrograms per liter concentrations of\nperchlorate in milk collected from US women (Kirk et al.,\n2005) confirms lactation as a relevant perchlorate excretion\npath. Additional data from another lactating mammalian\nspecies (dairy cattle) confirm that a substantial portion of\na perchlorate dose can be excreted in milk (Capuco et al.,\n2005). If lactating women are secreting perchlorate in milk,\nthen urine-based estimates of total perchlorate exposure for\nthese individuals are likely to be lower than actual. However,\nthe overall impact of lactation on our population estimates of\nperchlorate exposure is likely to be minimal because only 26\nof the 2820 participants in our study population reported\nthat they were currently breastfeeding a child.\nOur initial measurements indicate that perchlorate ex-\nposure is widespread. The toxicological impact of perchlorate\nexposure at these levels is an area of ongoing research. The\nEPA recently set the reference dose (RfD), a dose estimated\nto be without appreciable risk of adverse effects during a\nlifetime of exposure, for perchlorate at 0.7 mg/kg-day (EPA,\n2005a). This RfD was recommended by the National\nAcademy of Sciences expert panel in their perchlorate risk\nassessment (NAS, 2005). To compare our measured per-\nchlorate concentrations in spot urine samples with this\ntoxicological benchmark dose, we estimated daily dose based\non physiological parameters and measured spot urine\nperchlorate and creatinine. Estimation of perchlorate dose\npercentile of 0.234 mg/kg-day. These estimated perchlorate\ndose levels are lower than the current EPA reference dose of\n0.7 mg/kg-day. Only 11 adults had estimated perchlorate\nexposure in excess of the reference dose.\nThe NAS has specified pregnant women, fetuses and\ninfants as populations who may be more sensitive to the\npotential health effects of perchlorate exposure (NAS, 2005).\nMild hypothyroidism during pregnancy can be associated\nwith subsequent cognitive deficits in children (Haddow et al.,\nthe sodium iodide symporter in the placenta and lactating\nbreast tissue allows perchlorate exposure of the mother to be\ndistributed to the developing fetus and infant. Perchlorate\nmeasurement began at 6 years of age in our study, so we\ndo not have exposure information for infants. Women of\nreproductive age can be used as a surrogate population for\nassessing fetal exposure. Women of reproductive age had a\nmedian estimated perchlorate dose of 0.057 mg/kg-day and\nexposure doses were also estimated for the pregnant women\nin the study who had complete data sets for age, height and\nweight (N \u00bc 110). This population of pregnant women had\nan estimated median perchlorate dose of 0.066 mg/kg-day.\nThese estimated perchlorate dose levels are lower than the\ncurrent EPA reference dose of 0.7 mg/kg-day.\nConclusions\nWe assessed urinary perchlorate levels in a US reference\npopulation and present the data here stratified by age, sex\nand race/ethnicity. We found perchlorate in all human urine\nsamples tested, indicating widespread trace-level perchlorate\nexposure in the general population. We estimated daily\nperchlorate dose and found that the 95th percentile of\nTable 5.
