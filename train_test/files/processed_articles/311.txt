Our analyses included 4,830 U.S. men and women aged 25\u00ad74\nyears who had a baseline interview and examination (including spirometry) from 1971 through\nproxy reports, hospitalization, or death certificates.\nRESULTS -- After multiple adjustment, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1\n), forced vital\ncapacity (FVC), percentage of predicted FEV1\n, and percentage of predicted FVC were signifi-\ncantly and inversely associated with the incidence of diabetes, but the ratio of FEV1\nto FVC was\nnot. Obstructive lung disease (defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung\nDisease classification) was not significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes, but restric-\nsignificantly by smoking status.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Although several prospective studies have found that impaired pulmo-\nnary function may increase the risk for developing diabetes, additional research is needed to\nbetter understand these relationships and their possible implications.\nLung function may predict the devel-\nopment of insulin resistance or dia-\nbetes (1\u00ad4). In the Normative Aging\nStudy (2), forced vital capacity (FVC),\nforced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1\n),\nand maximal mid-expiratory flow rate\n(MMEF) were associated with insulin re-\nsistance over a period of 20.9 years. In ad-\ndition, three Swedish studies with follow-\nlung function predicted the development of\ndiabetes(1,3,4).Inallthreestudies,lowlev-\nels of FVC were associated with increased\nrisk; in one, FEV1\nwas inversely associated\nwith incidence.\nTo provide another perspective on\nthe possible association between lung\nfunction and incidence of diabetes, we an-\nalyzed data from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey Epidemio-\nlogic Follow-Up Study (NHEFS), a cohort\nstudy. We studied possible prospective\nassociations between measures of pulmo-\nnary function, including FEV1\n, FVC, per-\ncentage of predicted FEV1\n, percentage of\npredicted FVC, and the ratio of FEV1\nto\nFVC, and incidence of diabetes. In addi-\ntion, we examined the association be-\ntween different forms of lung disease--\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease as\nclassified by the Global Initiative for\nChronic Obstructive Lung Disease\n(GOLD), restrictive lung disease, and re-\nspiratory symptoms--and the incidence\nof diabetes.\nsentative sample of the U.S. civilian pop-\nulation received a baseline examination\nand interview as part of the first National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I). The sample was selected us-\ning a complex sampling design so that re-\nsults would be representative of the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population.\nDetails of the NHANES I and the NHEFS\nare available elsewhere (5\u00ad11).\nDuring the follow-up study, up to\nfour attempts were made to contact par-\nticipants or their surrogates in person\nand, during later follow-ups, by tele-\nsion was requested to obtain hospital\nrecords. Deaths were identified through\nsearches of the National Death Index, en-\nrollee files of the Health Care Financing\nAdministration, and other tracing mech-\nanisms.

The midpoint of\nthat year was designated as the date of\nonset. For participants who did not report\na year of onset, we assigned the midpoint\nbetween the last date of known contact\nand the date of the most recent interview.\nThe date of onset was chosen as the date\nthe condition was first reported or re-\ncorded on institutional records or death\ncertificates.\nParticipants who reported at baseline\nthat they had diabetes were considered\nprevalent cases, as were participants who\nduring later follow-up contacts reported a\ndate of onset that occurred in the year of\ntheir baseline interview or earlier, and\nthey were excluded from the analyses.\nThe pulmonary symptoms included\nin the analysis, which were used to define\nan asymptomatic subset of the population\nto calculate equations for lung function\nand define a subset of the cohort with\nonly respiratory symptoms, were cough\n(defined as a positive response to \"Have\nyou ever had a cough first thing in the\nmorning in the winter?\" or \"Have you ever\nhad a cough first thing in the morning in\nthe summer?\"), sputum (defined as a pos-\nitive response to \"Have you ever had any\nphlegm from your chest first thing in the\nmorning in the winter?\" or \"Have you ever\nhad any phlegm from your chest first\nthing in the morning in the summer?\"),\nand wheeze (defined as a positive re-\nsponse to \"Have you ever had wheezy or\nwhistling sounds in your chest?\").\nSpirometry was obtained by using an\nOhio Medical Instruments 800 spirome-\nter. The procedures used have been doc-\numented previously (6). Individuals were\nexcluded from this analysis if they either\ndid not perform spirometry or had results\nthat were not reliable. We included data\nfrom participants who did not have \"re-\nproducible\" measures (12). (To be repro-\nducible the FEV1\nand FVC from two\nreliable measurements had to be within\n5% for most participants.) Values used in\nthis analysis included the FVC, FEV1\n, and\n-to-FVC ratio. We determined\npredicted values of FEV1\nand FVC by per-\nforming linear regression (stratified by sex\nand by using age and height as predictors)\non a subgroup of participants who were\nwhite never smokers who did not report\nrespiratory symptoms or physician-\ndiagnosed lung disease. The results from\nthese regression models (men: FEV1\n\n\ndata from all participants to obtain pre-\ndicted values of FEV1\nand FVC. We used\nan adjustment factor of 0.88 to estimate\npredicted values for African-American\nparticipants.\nUsing the percentage of predicted\n, percentage of predicted FVC, the\n-to-FVC ratio, and the presence of\nrespiratory symptoms, we used a modifi-\ncation of the GOLD criteria to classify par-\nticipants as having chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD). Participants\nhad mild COPD if they had a FEV1\n-to-\nFVC ratio 0.70 and a percentage of pre-\ndicted FEV1\n80%). Because too few\nparticipants had severe or very severe\nCOPD, we combined them and partici-\npants who had moderate COPD into a\nsingle group (FEV1\nand percentage of predicted FEV1\n80%). In addition, we assigned partici-\npants as having restrictive lung disease\nFVC 80% predicted), symptoms only\n(presence of respiratory symptoms in the\nabsence of any lung function abnormal-\nity), and no lung disease. As per GOLD\ncriteria, we assigned participants who met\nthe criteria for having both COPD and\nRLD to the COPD group.\nCovariates included age, race or eth-\nnicity (nonwhite or white), education\n(years), cigarette smoking (never, former,\nor current), systolic blood pressure\n(mmHg), use of antihypertensive medica-\ntion (yes/no), serum cholesterol concen-\ntration (mg/dl), BMI (kg/m2), alcohol\nrecreational exercise (much, moderate,\nlittle, or no exercise), and nonrecreational\nexercise (very active, moderately active,\nor quite inactive).\nTwo-sample comparisons of categor-\nical and continuous variables were made\nby using 2 tests and t tests, respectively.\nBaseline characteristics and age-adjusted\nincidence rates were directly standard-\nized to the age distribution from the 2000\ncensus. Person-time was calculated for\neach participant from the time of entry\ninto the study until one of the following\nconditions occurred: the participant de-\nveloped diabetes (1), the participant died\nor left the study (2), or follow-up was\npendent association between pulmonary\nfunction parameters or lung disease, as\nassessed with the GOLD classification\nscheme, at baseline and incidence of dia-\nbetes was examined using proportional\nhazard models.

Analyses\nshowed that the proportionality assump-\ntion was satisfied.\nin the cardiorespiratory subset and were\nthus eligible for spirometry. After partici-\npants who were lost to follow-up were\nparticipants with prevalent diabetes re-\nduced the sample size to 6,260, and fur-\nther exclusion of participants with\ninsufficient data to establish whether they\ndeveloped diabetes during follow-up left\n6,112 participants. After excluding preg-\nmained, and additional elimination of\nparticipants with missing data for covari-\nates left 5,913 for analysis. Of this group,\ntion tests available; this group thus con-\nstituted our final analytic sample. Of the\ngroup, 443 developed diabetes during the\ncourse of the study.\nParticipants who developed diabetes\nwere older than those who remained free\nof the disease (Table 1). After adjustment\nfor age, participants who developed dia-\nbetes were less likely to be white, had\nfewer years of education, had higher sys-\ntolic blood pressure, were more likely to\nbe taking antihypertensive medication,\nwere heavier, and were more likely to be\nsedentary than participants who re-\nmained free of diabetes. In addition, par-\nFord and Mannino\nticipants who developed diabetes had\nlower mean percentage of predicted FEV1\nand percentage of predicted FVC. The\ngroups had similar FEV1\n-to-FVC ratios.\nFinally, participants who developed dia-\nbetes were more likely to have restrictive\nlung disease at baseline.\nThe FEV1, FVC, percentage of pre-\ndicted FEV1\n, and percentage predicted\nFVC were significantly and inversely as-\nsociated with the incidence of diabetes in\nfully adjusted proportional hazards re-\ngression models (Table 2). In contrast, the\nratio of FEV1\nto FVC was not.\nIn unadjusted models, participants\nwith moderate or severe COPD or RLD\nwere at increased risk for developing dia-\nbetes (Table 3). In addition, participants\nwith symptoms had a borderline in-\ncreased risk. After age adjustment, only\nparticipants with symptoms or RLD were\nat increased risk for developing diabetes.\nAfter full adjustment, however, only par-\nticipants with RLD were at increased risk\nfor developing diabetes (hazard ratio\ntional adjustment for BMI2 did not mate-\nrially affect the HR. Risk estimates did not\ndiffer by sex (P  0.324 for the interac-\ntion between sex and lung status) or race\nor ethnicity (P  0.261 for the interaction\nbetween race or ethnicity and lung sta-\ntus).

Our study of a\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. popula-\ntion indicates that adults with RLD may\nbe at increased risk for developing diabe-\ntes. Furthermore, as have other studies,\nwe found that FEV1\nand FVC are signifi-\ncantly associated with the incidence of di-\nabetes. However, we did not find that the\nratio of these two parameters, which had\nnot been previously studied and are asso-\nciated with obstructive lung diseases, pre-\ndicted the development of diabetes.\nSeveral prospective studies have now\nshown that parameters of pulmonary\nfunction predict the onset of diabetes. In a\nto develop diabetes over 6 years had 10%\nlower mean vital capacity at baseline than\nmen who did not develop diabetes. In the\nlowed for an average of 20.9 years. FVC,\n, and MMEF were all inversely asso-\nciated with the development of insulin re-\nsistance as measured with surrogate\nrometry performed when they were 55\nyears of age. After 13 years of follow-up,\n15 had developed diabetes. FEV1\nand\nFVC were inversely associated with inci-\ndence of diabetes. In the Malmo Preven-\noped diabetes, were followed for 13.9\nyears, and 896 nondiabetic women aged\nbetes, were followed for 9.4 years. The\npercentage of predicted FVC was in-\nversely associated with the incidence of\ndiabetes.\nThe findings from these prospective\nstudies may indicate that early in the\ncourse of diabetes, before it is diagnosed,\nlung function changes. If, in effect, the\ndevelopment of diabetes impairs lung\nfunction, the changes could be seen as\nrisk markers rather than risk factors for\ndiabetes. However, inflammation is\npresent in obstructive and RLD (13), and\nseveral studies have shown that various\nindicators of inflammation predict the de-\na couple of studies failed to find a signif-\nicant association (20,21). Thus, inflam-\nmation associated with pulmonary\ndisorders could conceivably contribute to\nthe development of diabetes. If so, abnor-\nmal pulmonary function or lung disease\ncould act as a risk factor for diabetes.\nSeveral limitations of the present\nstudy merit mentioning. The incidence of\ndiabetes was established from self-report,\nhospitalization discharge, and death cer-\ntificates, all of which provide less rigorous\ndefinitions of diabetes than oral glucose\ntolerance tests or fasting glucose concen-\ntrations. If the resulting misclassification\nwas nondifferential, the associations were\nmost likely underestimated. Neverthe-\nless, end points based on these data\nsources are commonly used, and known\nrisk factors for diabetes, such as excess\nweight, are strongly associated with dia-\nbetes defined by using these data sources.\nAn additional limitation was that partici-\npants with type 1 diabetes could not be\ndistinguished from those with type 2 dia-\nbetes. However, the overwhelming ma-\njority of people who develop newly\ndiagnosed diabetes after age 30 years have\ntype 2 diabetes. We also did not have total\nlung capacity available to classify people\naccording to the strictest criteria for RLD.\nOur results may have been a spurious\nfinding. The inability to adjust for all rel-\nevant confounding variables or residual\nconfounding could have accounted for\nour results. Some relevant factors include\noccupation, birth weight, body weight\ndistribution, and medication use, such as\ncorticosteroid use. Furthermore, we can-\nnot dismiss the possibility that detection\nor diagnostic bias may explain our find-\nings. People who had abnormal pulmo-\nnary function tests may have seen a doctor\nmore frequently during the follow-up pe-\nriod, thus having an increased opportu-\nnity to have diabetes diagnosed. If so,\nsuch bias must have affected people with\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nand RLD differentially because we did not\nfind a significant association between\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nand diabetes. Also, RLD may have repre-\nsented an unknown factor that was truly\nassociated with the incidence of diabetes.\nConceivably, abnormal lung function\nat baseline may have been associated with\nworsening obesity rather than diabetes.\nUnraveling the complexities of such an\nassociation would require the availability\nof anthropometric data at various points\nin time during the follow-up period, es-\npecially at the time of diagnosis of diabe-\ntes. Such data were not available for the\nNHEFS. Other studies in which partici-\npants were periodically examined might\nbe able to assess such an explanation.\nIn conclusion, we found that FEV1\n,\nFVC, percentage of predicted FEV1\n, and\nPulmonary\nconditions\nNo. of\ncases\nPerson-\nyears\nUnadjusted\nincidence per\nperson-years*\nAge-adjusted\nincidence per\nperson-years*\nUnadjusted Age-adjusted Multiple-adjusted\nOf 4,830 in the total sample, 443 people developed diabetes. *Estimate calculated using sampling weights.
