Migration is an important and intriguing process in animal ecology,\nwhich may be better understood through the study of tracks for individuals in their environmental context.\nOur approach enables ecologists to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of such tracks interactively. It\nidentifies and aggregates stopovers depending on a scale at which the data is visualized. Statistics of stopover\nsites and links between them are shown on a zoomable geographic map which allows to interactively explore\ndirected sequences of stopovers from an origin to a destination. In addition, the spatio-temporal properties of\nthe trajectories are visualized by means of a density plot on a geographic map and a calendar view. To evalu-\nate our visual analytics approach, we applied it on a data set of 75 migrating gulls that were tracked over a\nperiod of 3 years. The evaluation by an expert user confirms that our approach supports ecologists in their\nanalysis workflow by helping to identifying interesting stopover locations, environmental conditions or\n(groups of) individuals with characteristic migratory behavior, and allows therefore to focus on visual data\nanalysis.\n",

Starting in the 1990s, the availability of new tech-\nnology has led to increasingly detailed and diverse\ntypes of data relating to movement.1 Global\nPositioning System (GPS)-based movement tracks are\ncurrently among the most frequently collected types of\ndata. Because of its relative accuracy and high sam-\npling rate, the GPS technology drastically improved\nthe ability to describe and gain new insights about ani-\nmal movement. The continuing miniaturization allows\nat the same time to collect data for an increasing range\nof species and conditions.2 Today, animal movement\ntracks form one of the main data sources when\nstudying the mechanics of movements, navigational\ncues, or drivers of movement, constantly leading to\nnew insights on animal physiology, behavior, and\ndemography.3 Through those advances, ecologists are\nstarting to ask novel questions on the causes of move-\nment and its consequences for individuals, popula-\ntions, and ecosystems for which formal analysis\ntechniques are not always readily available. Kays\net al.2 claim that interdisciplinary research between\ndata scientists--computer scientists, statisticians--and\necologists will be required to develop these new tools\nefficiently and will eventually lead to new insights and\nscientific breakthroughs.\n1TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands\n2University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nEindhoven, The Netherlands.\nEmail: m.p.konzack@tue.nl\nThe goal of data visualization is to provide insights\ninto data.4 New visualization techniques and visual\nencodings help users to understand their data sets.\nFurthermore, visual analytics can be used to generate\nknowledge from large and often complex data sets by\ndeveloping and deploying analytical and visualization\ntechniques.5\nTo support an ecologist in her search for new\nknowledge, a visualization expert needs to spend time\nand effort to understand the relevant questions, data,\nand the general ecological context of a study system--\nknowledge which has often not be acquired a priori.\nAn ecologist does, however, not commonly have an\noverview of the analysis and visualization possibilities\nthat are technically feasible or how these would help in\nanswering certain ecological research questions. Thus,\na knowledge gap between domain experts and visuali-\nzation designers exists.4,6 Explorative visualization can\nhelp in filling this gap as it provides means for ecolo-\ngists to discover new trends, to present a data set\nvisually, to identify pertinent subsets, to compare the\nmovement of individuals, and to locate moving enti-\nties, among other tasks. Abstracting such tasks helps\nto reason about similarities and differences between\nthem, to distinguish between different goals, and to\nguide data abstraction.7 Eventually, exploratory visua-\nlization provides a novel analytical means and there-\nfore leads to new ecological insights. In addition, it\nmay help the users to build trust in their generated\nknowledge base.5\nThe current practice of ecologists to investigate and\nvisualize movement is by developing and using\nMATLAB or R libraries.6,8 Those results are either\nanalyzed and visualized statically or plotted on top of\nsatellite maps. Few bird ecologists examined move-\nment data in interactive visualizations with multiple\ncoordinated views or used a Google Earth\u00adbased tool\nfor exploring GPS data from a bird's eye perspective,\nboth of which have been of limited value.6 It seems\nthat a tight integration of different spatio-temporal\nviews of the data, with a flexible selection, would be\nbeneficial to ecologists to focus on data analysis\nmechanisms rather than laborious coding.9\nIn this article, we present such a technique. It com-\nprises a novel visual analytics approach to help explore\nanimal migration patterns interactively. Our approach\nprovides analytical and visual means to understand\ndifferent aspects of migration through an aggregation\nat various spatial scales, with interlinked geographical\nmaps, and views on spatio-temporal events. Migration\nis ubiquitous in ecology. It is the seasonal displace-\nment of individuals between sites. In our approach, we\nidentify and aggregate stopovers. A stopover is a break\nwithin a migratory trajectory. Functionally, stopovers\nare important for foraging, resting, or socializing with\nconspecifics, but stopovers can also be used diagnosti-\ncally to recognize different migration strategies: along\nthe coastline, over sea, or over land.\nPast research on visualizing gull migration lack an\naggregation of the trajectories8 or impose visual clutter\nby drawing the results of the clustering as colored data\npoints on a map.9 Our visual analytics approach reme-\ndies this by employing a stopover aggregation visualiza-\ntion, a density map, and a calendar view (see Figure 1).\nThe stopover aggregation and density map are plotted\non top of interconnected zoomable geographic maps.\nThe user can select stopovers and impose constraints\non spatio-temporal properties of the selection.\nWe applied our approach to a data set of 75 migrat-\ning Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus), which we\nwill henceforth denote as ``gulls'' in this article. We\nevaluated our tool by consulting an expert user10 with\nan expertise on bird migration to assess the strengths\nand weaknesses of our approach. We identified ecolo-\ngical research questions and requirements on the visual\ndesign and mapped them to analytical tasks that the\nexpert user completed. In this article, we use the terms\nmoving entities and individuals interchangeably.\nOur qualitative evaluation confirms that our\napproach helps ecologists in their analysis of migration\npatterns, so that they are able to identify and to isolate\ngroups of individuals with a certain migration behavior\nvisually rather than in non-visual computations. This\nspeeds up and fosters their analytical workflow because\nour approach empowers ecologists to focus on inter-\npreting the data and on developing new questions\nwithout being distracted by coding or by algorithmic\ntechnicalities.\nRelated work\nTo identify different homogeneous movement episodes\nin trajectory data, trajectories are commonly segmen-\nted, that is, cut into parts, according to characteristics\nof the movement. Segmentation together with classifi-\ncation or clustering of movement data helps to sum-\nmarize and visualize large trajectory data sets.\nVisualization techniques on movement data support\nusers in identifying new trends within data sets. We\nsurvey past research on visualization and clustering of\nmovement data from various application backgrounds\nto give an overview of recent achievements in these\nfields.\nSegmentation algorithms have been successfully\napplied to migrating geese11,12 and gulls9 among many\nother studies.13\u00ad19 These approaches segment individ-\nual trajectories into pieces of similar movements.\nBuchin et al.20 present algorithms to summarize seg-\nmentations of a larger number of trajectories in a flow\ndiagram, which they apply to trajectories of football\nplayers to analyze spatial formations and plays.\nTo aggregate movement data, Andrienko and\nAndrienko21 transformed trajectories into aggregate\nflows between spatial regions within their visual analy-\ntics approach. This type of aggregation allows group-\nings of essential characteristics of the movement. In\ntheir approach, the user can control the overall level of\nabstraction of the visualization interactively. Andrienko\nand Andrienko21 applied their approach to deer and\nstork data and to trajectories in an urban context,\nwhere the aggregated results are visualized as flow\nmaps or as transition matrices.\nDensity visualization is a powerful visualization tech-\nnique for analyzing many trajectories. One such example\nis the work by Willems et al.,22 which presents a multi-\nscale density visualization for trajectories. They demon-\nstrate it on vessel trajectories. The visualization of the\ndensity fields is derived from the convolution of the\ndynamic vessel position with a kernel that takes the speed\nof the movement into account. The density fields are\nilluminated as height maps on top of the heat map.\nAdditionally, Willems et al.22 visualize the individual's\ncontribution of a moving point within the overall density.\nScheepens et al.23 use a similar approach to visua-\nlize densities of maritime trajectories, for which they\napply a cascade of filtering and selection mechanisms\non top of the density maps. These selection mechan-\nisms are sensitive to a user role, either a domain expert\nor an operator, and to the task at hand. An operator is\nusually only concerned with events connected to his\nwork task, such as surveillance of a particular port.\nDensities of movement data do not have to be\nvisualized necessarily as a raster map on top of a geo-\ngraphical map. Slingsby et al.24 deploy hierarchical,\ninteractive treemaps to explore spatio-temporal move-\nment patterns of couriers in London.\nClustering on urban data has been studied by Lu\nDestination (OD) pairs as an interactive selection of\nclustered regions. The underlying summarization uses\na modified DBSCAN algorithm, which is a density-\nbased clustering algorithm. Lu et al.26 ranked trajec-\ntories of taxi data based on their similarity of travel\ntime. Within their visual analytics tool, they visualized\nthe ranking as bands over time. Before ranking the tra-\njectories, they are mapped onto the underlying street\nnetwork first and then segmented.\nFigure 1. Overview of the visual analytics tool: the stopover aggregation visualization (1) enables the user to investigate\nand select stopovers. The density map (2) shows the spatial distribution of the selected moving entities. Within the\ncalendar view (3) the temporal distribution of the stopovers of the selected entities over time is visualized. The list of\ngulls (4) shows the names and genders of the selected entities.\nKonzack et al. 3\nSlingsby and van Loon8 present an exploratory\nvisual analysis approach for animal movement data.\nThey applied it, as we did, on gull data, and they\ndevised ecological and visualization requirements on\nthe analytical process. Their visual encodings range\nfrom point plots over density maps to tile maps and,\nthus, cover partially our visualization techniques. The\nvisual analytics software consists of a central view, a\nsatellite map with an overlaid visual encoding and user\ninteractions, and two interconnected timelines: one for\na sequence of days and the other one on the times dur-\ning those days. They did not, however, consider a\nsummary and aggregation of the gulls' trajectories,\nwhich we provide and use as the main technique to\ninteract with the user in our study.\nSpretke et al.9 developed a visual analytics approach\nfor migrating seagulls. It supports interactive data\nexploration and enrichment of movement data by add-\ning attributes dynamically from existing ones, and\nincorporating weather information, such as wind and\ntemperature. They clustered the trajectories of gulls\ninto three states: day migration, night migration, and\nstopover. They also segmented the trajectories based\non spatio-temporal characteristics (45 min resting and\nless than 2 km continuous flight). Their visualization\nwith interconnected views lacks an abstraction for\nvisualizing clusters since Spretke et al.9 mapped the\nclustering to only colors, and plotted the clusters as\nplain data points yielding visual clutter.\nKo\n\u00a8lzsch et al.27 reflected on the visual design of\nmigrating birds by exploring different visualization\ntechniques to encode spatio-temporal characteristics\nof migration. They related ecological research ques-\ntions to the visual design which inspired us to link our\necological research questions to the requirements of\nour visual design.\nProblem definition and requirement\nanalysis\nAnimal migration is an intriguing phenomenon in\nnature and has, as a consequence, always received\nmuch attention as a research topic in biology. It is\nincreasingly being studied through visual and quanti-\ntative techniques due to the availability of tracking\ndata in combination with relevant environmental data\nIn our study, we focus on the interactive analysis of\nanimal migration tracks, and in this section, we lay out\na number of important ecological research questions\nthat can be partially answered through these means.\nBy relating those domain research questions to analyti-\ncal requirements, we aim for a holistic problem analy-\nsis30 of migratory animal movement.\nEcological research questions on migration\npatterns\nEven though there is a large body of knowledge about\nbird migration31,32 and some common principles are\ngenerally recognized (a migrating organism would\nmaximize its fitness behaviorally by minimizing energy\nconsumption, time expenditure, or the risk incurred\nduring migration),33\u00ad35 our understanding of underly-\ning drivers as well as the (behavioral, ecological, and\nphysiological) mechanisms is still far from complete.\nIn the case of the focal species in this study (the\nLesser Black-backed Gull), for instance, exact energy\nbudgets are unknown, the comparative advantage of\nmigration (vs overwintering in the breeding area) is\nunclear, and the reason for the wide spread in overwin-\ntering sites by individuals from a single colony is also\nunknown.36 However, some aspects of the migration\nof this species have been studied, leading, for example,\nto the conclusion that it minimizes the energetic costs\nrather than time spent during migration.28\nIn this study, we explore how an interactive analysis\nof trajectory data can help to gain more insight in the\npossible role of individual differences, sex, and time-\ndependent conditions (such as weather patterns or\nephemeral food resources) as well as the characteristics\nof stopover sites during migration. The ecological\nquestions that we consider are listed in Table 1. They\nhave been designed to cover insights into a summary of\nstopovers and the exploration of the relation between\ntrajectories and the actual movement.\nQuestions E1 to E3 focus on the relation between\nattributes of the movement tracks (that can be consid-\nered as predictor variables) and migration decisions\n(that can be considered as response variables).\nHowever, both the predictor and response variables\nhave not been operationalized, so that inferential test-\ning through, for example, multiple regression is not\nfeasible yet. Rather, an explorative analysis is required\nto help to define those variables.\nQuestions E4 to E6 deal with the uniqueness of\nstopover sites. For these questions, the reference (e.g.\ndirect surroundings, other individuals) is not clearly\ndefined, hence part of the challenge is here to discover\nthe type and scale of reference that is meaningful.\nRequirements for analysis tasks\nWe now map these ecological research questions to\nmore abstracts requirements that our approach needs\nto support. These requirements are listed in Table 2.\nMoreover, they help abstracting generic tasks from\nspatio-temporal characteristics of migratory trajectory\ndata.\nIn our approach, we want to identify spatial patterns\n(T1). This requirement covers a comprehensive visua-\nlization of all trajectories, allowing the user to under-\nstand and compare spatial patterns in migration (E1)\nacross different scales. A grouping of gulls with similar\nmovements provides insights into different categories\nof migration behaviors (E6). A sequence of stops from\nan origin to a destination (E5) can be expressed as\nsuch a grouping. The behavior of individuals should\nbe distinguishable from overall group patterns to inves-\ntigate how the migration strategy of an individual devi-\nates from the group movements (E6).\nWe want to identify temporal patterns (T2) across sev-\neral scales, ranging from day/night patterns over days\nto seasonal patterns. A visualization should allow to\nspecify an episode to constrain the selection to lie\nwithin a start and end date (E4, E5, E6).\nAnother analytical requirement is to identify stop-\novers (T3). This requirement deals with a more aggre-\ngate view on the data to identify important or often\nused places (E2) where migrating gulls come together\n(E6). Stopovers can also be considered at the level of\nan individual to visualize its migration strategy on top\nof an exchangeable map, such as a geographic or a\ntopographic map, to investigate the surroundings of a\nstopover (E4) with different visual cues. A visualiza-\ntion should furthermore provide insight into the prox-\nimity of the stopover. Statistics on a stopover help to\nunderstand the nature of the stopover (E2).\nWithin our analytical framework, we want to com-\npare groups and individuals (T4). This requirement con-\ncerns grouping individuals that show similar migration\nstrategies (E1), for example, travel mostly along a\ncoastline, over land, or over sea. A visualization should\nenable not only a visual linkage between these groups\n(E5) but also the comparison of one or more individu-\nals with a group (E6). Subgroups can be selected by\nthe user individually or by characteristics of the gulls,\nVisual analytics approach\nOur visual analytics approach (see Figure 1) enables\nusers to explore migration patterns interactively. We\nidentify stopovers, and aggregate them in a visualiza-\ntion, so that the user can investigate and interact with\nstopovers. The tool allows the user to select a sequence\nof stopovers from an origin to a destination. Such a\nselection imposes a direction of movement for moving\nentities within a migration. The selected group of mov-\ning entities is rendered in the density map, the calendar\nview, and the list of gulls. In the density map, the spa-\ntial usage of the selected gulls is shown while the calen-\ndar displays the counts of stopovers per day of selected\nor all stopovers. The geographic maps for the density\nmap and the stopover aggregation are interconnected.\nOur visual analytics approach is implemented as an\ninteractive website (http://www.win.tue.nl~kbuchin/\nproj/gullmigration/), so that it is widely accessible to\nresearchers who want to explore migration patterns.\nBy visually exploring a data set, trust into the knowl-\nedge base of the data set can be built,5 and it allows\necologists to focus on data analysis instead of imple-\nmenting source code to isolate groups with different\nmigration behaviors.9\nIn this section, we first discuss the algorithmic tech-\nniques which underlie our visual analytics tool and\nrelate these to the requirements of our tool.\nTable 1. Overview over the ecological research questions that we explore in our visual analytics tool for migration.\nEcological research question\nE1 How do individuals' differences, sex, and temporal conditions relate to the route choice?\nE2 How do individuals' differences, sex, and temporal conditions relate to the choice of the stopover site?\nE3 How do individuals' differences, sex, and temporal conditions relate to the timing of stopping and commencing to\nmigrate?\nE4 What is special about the places to where migrating individuals move relative to the direct surroundings (at the\nsame time/within the same time window)?\nE5 What is special about the places to where migrating individuals move relative to the place where they come from\n(at the same time/within same time window)?\nE6 What is special about the places to where migrating individuals move relative to other individuals (at the same\ntime/within same time window)?\nTable 2. Summary of the requirements for our visual\nanalytics tool.\nRequirements for the visual analysis\nT1 Identify spatial patterns\nT2 Identify temporal patterns\nT3 Identify stopovers\nT4 Compare groups and individuals\nKonzack et al. 5\nSubsequently, we link the requirements to the visuali-\nzation design.\nComputational methods\nTo allow a clustering across different spatial scales\n(T1), we have applied a single-linkage agglomerative\nclustering to aggregate stopovers. Since gulls have\nalong their migration routes frequent stops which are\nheterogeneous in duration and local detours, we can-\nnot readily apply stopover criteria used in existing\nalgorithms12 for segmenting the trajectories. Our algo-\nrithm supports two parameters to facilitate flexible\nstopover definitions. These parameters are thresholds\non the speed of a point to its successor within a trajec-\ntory, defaulted to 3:5 km=h, and a maximum distance\nbetween two moving entities, defaulted to 500 m. The\ndistance threshold determines whether two points\nfrom distinct trajectories are within the same stopover.\nOur chosen defaults provide sensible parameters to\ndescribe stopover criteria for gulls.\nIn Figure 2 we show the aggregation algorithm that\nwe employed; it has four phases. The first two phases\nfocus on identifying stopovers (T3), and phases (3)\nand (4) exploit spatio-temporal characteristics of\nmigration (T1, T2). The first three phases are exe-\ncuted sequentially. After that, phase four is executed\nfor different spatial scales. We discuss each phase in\nmore detail in the following.\nFirst, we classify points as idle if the speed of a point\nwith respect to the previous point of the trajectory of\nan individual is below the given threshold. This allows\nus to distinguish between movement and non-\nmovement of an individual.\nNext, we compute stopovers (T3) by employing\nRitter's Bounding Sphere algorithm37 onto the idle\npoints and thresholding the distance between two idle\npoints. A stop is the smallest disk containing idle\npoints (Figure 2 shows five idle points that together\ndefine a stop). Ritter's algorithm, with a running time\nof O(nd) in general for n points in d dimensions, is\nexceptionally efficient with a linear running time in\nour case, since we compute the sphere in the plane\nand n points at a stop. A drawback of this algorithm is\nthat the obtained disk is approximately 5% larger than\nthe optimal minimum-radius circle. By identifying\nthese stops, we are able to represent them as a visual\nabstraction.\nIn the third phase, we take the centers of all disks,\nwhich represent stopovers of idle points, and compute\na Delaunay triangulation38 on those centers. Because\na Delaunay triangulation minimizes the minimum\nangle within the triangulation, that is, avoiding narrow\ntriangles, it is a suitable means to compute all possible\nedges between stopovers.\nFinally, to aggregate the stops, we perform a single-\nlinkage clustering by applying Kruskal's algorithm39\non the Delaunay triangulation from fine to coarse scale\n(T1), where the distances between the corresponding\nstops--disks--serve as edge weights. We span an edge\nuv between the centers of the smallest enclosing balls\nat u and v only for the moving entities incident to this\nedge. We exclude in this computation those individu-\nals who are not traveling along that edge uv. This step\nallows us to construct a summary of the stopovers that\nreduces visual clutter across multiple spatial scales.\nThe density map is dynamically computed on a set\nof gulls and allows comparisons between different\ngroups (T4). The computation of a density map con-\nsists in our approach of three steps: first, we interpolate\nthe data linearly for each individual, using a sample\nresolution of 15 min to bypass irregular sample\nFigure 2. The computational process to aggregate stopovers consists of four phases: (1) the identification of idle points,\n(2) the computation of stops, (3) the triangulation of stops, and (4) the aggregation of stopovers on various scales. The\nfirst two phases identify stopovers (T3). The resulting triangulation from phase (3) is used in phase (4) to compute\nsummaries on different spatial scales from fine to coarse (T1).\nintervals. Then, we bin the counts for each individual\non a grid of all possible locations. The counts of a cell\nare the occurrences of all moving entities with that grid\ncell. Eventually, we discretize the binned values to five\nquintiles (see Figure 3) and compute the contour lines\nof the density map. Such a density map allows users to\nperceive the distribution and the spatial extent of the\ntrajectories (T1).\nAs we are interested in investigating day and night\npatterns of trajectories (T2), we need to classify sub-\ntrajectories as daytime or nighttime. To determine\nwhether a data point of a trajectory, given as longi-\ntude, latitude, and a time stamp, occurs during day,\nnight, or twilight, we used the method described in\nForsythe et al.40 It is robust across the latitude, and\nthe computational error ranges from maximum 1 min\nnear the equator up to 2 min near 60\u00b0 north latitude.\nVisualization techniques\nThe stopover aggregation (T3) provides an overview\nof the stopovers and the segmented trajectories, mov-\ning among the stopovers. We represent each stopover\nas a disk, of which the radii encode the quantiles on\nthe number of trajectories at the stopover. This encod-\ning allows us to visualize the spatial distribution of the\nstops within a stopover. The selected stopovers have\nan orange halo, and the number indicates the sequen-\ntial ordering of the stopovers from an origin to a desti-\nnation (see Figure 1). Edges are colored in a light\nshade of gray per default without any selection. The\nmore moving entities of the selection travel along an\nedge, the stronger it will be saturated in a darker shade\nof gray. Our encoding enables users to have a visually\nsalient selection.\nTo change the spatial layout of the stopover aggrega-\ntion from coarse-grained to fine-grained (T1), we allow\nthe user to select an aggregation level (see phase four in\nsection `Computational methods') by providing a slider,\nwhich is only visible if no selection has been made. The\nmap type can be changed to a satellite view (see Figure\n4) to investigate the vicinity of the stopover (T3), as it is\nprovided by other state-of-the-art map services.\nThe density map provides an overview of the spatial\nusage of a set of moving entities or all of them (T1).\nWe ensure that individual trajectories that deviate sub-\nstantially from others are clearly visible using an appro-\npriate kernel size. This way, the density map also\nsupports task T4. As for the stopover aggregation, the\nmap type can be changed to a satellite view as well\nTo investigate the migration strategy of an individ-\nual, we provide a trajectory visualization. The trajec-\ntory is drawn on top of the density map (Figure 4).\nDay, night, and twilight are color coded in light blue,\nblack, and purple (T2), respectively. This allows a user\nto see whether a gull travels long or short periods on a\nparticular day and also how many days the entire jour-\nney takes. The text labels on top of the trajectory show\nthe stopovers of an individual and can be turned off\nand on. They indicate the sequence and the direction\nof the movement for an individual.\nThe calendar view is shown when a stopover, a set\nof gulls, or an individual gull has been selected (T4).\nIt provides information on the distribution of stops at\neach day and which gulls stopped at a specific day\n(T2). Such temporal information can be encoded in\nvarious ways, such as a timeline or a punch card chart.\nA calendar has the advantage of showing multiple\nyears at the same time. Our tool allows users to toggle\nbetween showing the distribution of the selected stop-\novers or of all stopovers. The number of stops are\nvisualized in the same saturated scale of blue as the\none used in the stopover aggregation. Selecting a time\nframe within the calendar helps to exploit temporal\npatterns (T2), and such a selection is visualized as a\ncontour in the same shade of orange as the one used\nfor the selection in the stopover aggregation (see\nFigure 6).\nFigure 3. Color scale for the quintiles in the density map.\nFigure 4. Activity at night of gull ``Sanne.'' The coloring of\nthe individual gull, Sanne, shows considerable movement\nat night, in black, during the migration.\nKonzack et al. 7\nAfter evaluating the metadata of the used data set,41\nwe focused on visualizing only names and gender of\nthe gulls in addition to their trajectories because the\nancillary data did not provide any pertinent statistics\n(categorical and numerical) beyond gender and name.\nThe gulls within the selection are alphabetically sorted\nby the names of the gulls. Males are colored in blue\nand females in red. Subselections of previous selec-\ntions are supported in various ways (T4).\nExploratory analysis process\nOur visual analytics tool provides two ways to explore\nmigration: analyzing migration patterns at a level of\nstopovers and investigating the spatio-temporal char-\nacteristics of a single moving entity. Within the more\ncomprehensive analytical process in exploring stop-\novers, we support at any time the inspection of an\nindividual.\nThe analysis process for exploring stopovers is the\nfollowing:\n1. Spot interesting stopovers;\n2. Select a promising stopover;\n3. Investigate the selected stopover(s);\n4. Refine the selected stopover(s);\n5. Inspect the individual trajectories of the result set.\nUsers start by attaining a general overview of the\ndata set by zooming, panning, and inspecting the inter-\nconnected maps. By hovering on interesting stopovers\n(see Figure 5(a)), users gain insight on the structure\nand the relevance of the stopovers (step 1).\nNext, users select a stopover of their interest by\nclicking on it (step 2). This will update all other views:\nthe density map, the calendar, and the list of gulls.\nSubsequently, users explore the nature of the selec-\ntion (step 3). Within the calendar view, users can tog-\ngle between showing the counts of all stopovers or only\nthe selected ones. By hovering a day in the calendar, a\ntooltip (Figure 5(b)) is shown with the names of the\ngulls stopping at that day. Alternatively, the inspection\nprocess on a single gull can help to gain insights here,\ntoo (step 5).\nThe current selection of stopover(s) may be incom-\nplete or inconclusive, so users can refine the selected\nstopover(s) (step 4). By adding another stopover to\nthe selection, users define a sequence from an origin,\nthe first selected stopover, to a destination, the most\nrecently selected stopover. In the stopover aggregation\n(2) of Figure 1, we show a stopover sequence from\nSpain/Portugal to the Netherlands/Belgium. A dese-\nlection of stopovers is supported and restricting the\nselection to a specific gender is supported too, so that\nusers can investigate gender-specific differences (see\nFigure 7). Using the slider for the aggregation level,\nusers are able to adjust the granularity of the stopover\naggregation.\nAdditionally, users can define a time range wherein\nthe sequence of stopovers must lie (see Figure 6). This\nimposes a temporal restriction in which each individual\nwithin the selection must have at least one sequence of\nstopovers matching to the selection sequence, a stopover\nat the origin after or during the start date of the time\nframe, and a stopover at the destination before or dur-\ning the end date of the time frame. On a single stopover\nselection, the origin and the destination then coincide.\nIt is also possible to define a subgroup manually\nfrom the current selected entities. The users apply\nsteps 3 and 4 until they are satisfied with their find-\nings. Eventually, they discern the individual trajec-\ntories from the result set of moving entities (step 5).\nThe analytical process to inspect a trajectory of a\nsingle moving entity is defined by selecting the individ-\nual first and investigating the movements of the trajec-\ntory on top of the density map. The visual encoding\ncan be altered to exploit geographical characteristics\nand stopovers along the trajectory.\nEvaluation\nTo assess the effectiveness of our visual analytics tool\nin terms of strengths and weaknesses, we applied it to a\ndata set of migrating gulls over a period of 3 years and\nevaluated the visual analytics tool by interviewing an\nexpert user in a 2-h session.\nOur domain expert (one of the co-authors) has a\nbackground in ecology and studied bird migration in\nthe past. He has seen a previous prototype of our\nFigure 5. (a) Hovering on a stopover shows a tooltip with\nthe amount of gulls at that stopover and their genders.\n(b) Within the calendar, a tooltip shows the number of\nstops at this day for the selection and the names of the\ngulls stopping at that day.\napproach, but he did not experiment with the visual\nanalytics tool nor did he study the used data set\nbeforehand.\nWe conducted the evaluation with the expert user\nin three phases. First, we gave instructions and expla-\nnations on the visual design, the user interaction, the\ncomputation of stopovers, and the analytical features.\nThis phase took 25 min. After that, we dealt with spe-\ncific analytical questions on the data set. We developed\na catalog of analytical tasks, see Table 3, covering dif-\nferent facets of the tool and linking ecological research\nquestions and the requirements for our approach, see\nTables 1 and 2 in section ``Problem definition and\nrequirement analysis.'' In the final phase, we asked to\napply our tool on an area of interest and then asked\nquestions on the usability of the tool. Those reflections\nwill serve as a discussion of our approach.\nData set of migrating gulls\nThe Lesser Black-backed Gull is an interesting and\nchallenging species to analyze, since it has a broad diet\nand can feed on many resources (both terrestrial and\nmarine), can fly efficiently in many weather conditions,\nand can rest on both land and sea. As a consequence,\nmigration can take place across almost any landscape,\nand foraging is possible almost anywhere along its\nmigration route. This species generally adopts a fly-\nforage migration strategy which avoids carrying loads\nbut switches frequently between flying and feeding\nWe applied our visual analytics tool to a comprehen-\nsive data set collected by Stienen et al.,41 investigating\nour ecological research questions on the Lesser Black-\nbacked Gull. Stienen et al.41 collected almost 2.5 mil-\nlion data points from 101 gulls. This data set is unique\nwith respect to other gull data sets, since in other data\nsets only 10\u00ad20 individuals were tracked over two to\nthree seasons in a coarse resolution, whereas individu-\nals in this data set were tracked over 3 years in a much\nhigher resolution. The gulls have been tracked for at\nleast 10 days, and more than half of the gulls had loca-\ntions for more than 100 days. This data set contains\n75 Lesser Black-backed Gulls and 26 Herring Gulls.\nSince the Herring Gulls stayed at their breeding site,\nwe have focused on the Lesser Black-backed Gulls in\nFigure 6. A selected time range from October to November within the calendar view at a stopover.\nTable 3. Analytical tasks that the expert user completed, which have been linked to ecological research questions and\nthe requirements of our approach.\nAnalytical task Completion\ntime\nEcological\nresearch\nquestions\nRequirement\nA1 Find a stopover with a lot of gulls. 2 min E4 T1, T3\nA2 Which gulls are migrating from England to North Africa? 2 min E4, E5 T1, T4\nA3 Find a stopover with only female gulls. 2 min E2, E4 T4\nA4 Which gulls are migrating from Brittany (North France) to\nEngland during the period beginning June 2013 until end of\nA5 Find a gull with interesting movements during nighttime. 9 min E1, E5 T1, T2, T3, T4\nA6 Which gulls are migrating along the coastline in South\nFrance?\nA7 Find a stopover with more female than male gulls. 1 min E2, E4 T4\nA8 Which gulls are migrating from the breeding spot via North\nSpain to England?\nA9 What has been the migration strategy of gulls visiting\nMadrid (Spain)?\nA10 How would you describe the migration route of gulls at the\nstopover in Gibraltar?\nKonzack et al. 9\nour study. Their breeding sites were at the Belgian\nand Dutch coast, and during autumn the Lesser\nBlack-backed Gulls migrated to the South of Spain,\nPortugal, and North Africa. Further details about the\ndata set and the ecological studies that it supports are\nprovided in Stienen et al.41\nExpert user evaluation\nAll analytical tasks (see Table 3) were completed suc-\ncessfully. The ecologist completed most of the tasks\nwithin 2\u00ad5 min. However, A5 consumed 9 min in\ntotal, since this task heavily relied on several inspection\nprocesses and contemplating on the meaning of ``inter-\nesting movements during nighttime.''\nWe discuss the analytical tasks sequentially from top\nto bottom and elaborate on the differences in solving\nsimilar tasks as well.\nTo accomplish A1, the expert user inspected first\ndifferent aggregation levels (T1) and zoomed at differ-\nent levels within the stopover aggregation visualization.\nNext, he investigated the whole map by hovering sev-\neral stopovers (E4, T3). Eventually, he identified the\nstopover in North of Spain and Portugal as a stopover\nwith many gulls.\nA3 and A7 are similar tasks to A1, but the expert\nuser did not use the aggregation slider. In A3, the user\nbrowsed over a couple of stopovers (E4) and spotted\nthree stopovers in Brittany (North France) where only\nfemale gulls stayed (E2, T4). The expert user instantly\nrecalled the stopovers from A3 in A7 and started to\nhover on several stopovers (E2, E4) until he found\nsuitable stopovers in Brittany, England, and other\nparts of France, where more females than males\nstopped. He implicitly assumed there might be stops\nwhere there are more males than females (compare\nFigure 7).\nTo solve A2, the user directly selected the singleton\nstopover in England and noted that there are multiple\nstopovers in North Africa (E4). He used the slider for\nthe aggregation level after that until there was only one\nstopover in North Africa left and selected this one as a\ndestination (E5). Subsequently, the domain expert\ninspected the individual trajectories of the selection\nusing this route (T1, T4).\nA4 differs from A2 by adding a temporal constraint\n(E3, T2) on an origin-destination selection (E5). The\ndomain expert wanted to use the aggregation slider\nsimilarly as in A2 for Brittany, but he did not find a\nunique way, since, if the clustering is too coarse, there\nis no stopover in England, and, if it is too fine, there\nare many stopovers in Brittany. The expert user\naccepted this trade-off and selected a sequence from\nEngland to the largest stopover in Brittany (T1). Next,\nhe restricted the time frame within the calendar\nappropriately (T2), enumerated the gulls Harry and\nSanne, and expressed that he wanted to select a\nregion, Brittany as such, since he thought that he\nmight miss some birds from other stopovers in\nBrittany. In A8, he shared the same desire to select a\nregion after selecting yet another origin-destination\npair, over an intermediate stopover in this case. Thus,\na weakness of our approach is that we do not support a\nselection of a region.\nWithin A5, finding a gull with interesting move-\nments during nighttime (E1), the user investigated at\nfirst the complete list of gulls by hovering them (T4).\nHe was surprised that he could not see long trajec-\ntories sometimes. After discovering that half of the\ngulls stayed at the breeding spot, he wanted to select\nall gulls from all stopovers excluding the breeding spot\n(E5, T4) to investigate night movements outside of the\nbreeding spot, since he presumed that those motions\nat the breeding spot are probably due to human inter-\nference. He moved through the list of gulls further,\nwhile noticing that selecting a stopover (T3) might be\nmore effective, until he found gull Angel with a suitable\nlong trajectory (E1) (see Figure 8). Then, he defined\n``interesting'' in this context as distinctively different\npatterns in travel duration, speed, or trajectory shape\nbetween a series of consecutive days and nights (E5).\nHe assumed implicitly that gulls can float on the\nsea and be moved by tidal forces, as known from the\nFigure 7. Density maps for (a) females and (b) males\nreveal that females stop more often in Brittany, the most\nnorthwestern part of France, than males and that males\ntend to take larger detours during migration along the sea.\nliterature.8,29 So these patterns were not considered as\ninteresting per se, only when occurring at a different\nrate during day and night.\nWe classified the locations of a trajectory based on\nthe time stamps and the corresponding geographical\nposition as twilight, daytime, or nighttime (see section\n``Computational methods'') and visualized this on the\ntrajectory. So the visualization tool does not provide\ndirect information about the actual duration of daytime\nand nighttime periods for a given date. In order to com-\npare trajectory lengths between day and night straight-\nforwardly, the domain expert sought for periods around\nequinox, since daytime and nighttime are then almost\nequally distributed (based on this the ecologist did, for\nexample, skip a stopover of Angel in November, since\nthen the nighttime is longer). He switched to another\nindividual, Eric, subsequently, and zoomed out to get\nan overview of the overall movements (E1). After some\npanning and zooming, he found interesting that Eric, as\nmany others, traveled as much during the day as during\nthe night. He hypothesized that there might always be\nlight at the landmarks available to navigate.\nWhile the trajectories of Angel and Eric (see\nFigure 8) do not show much difference between the\nlengths of day/night stretches, there are enormous dif-\nferences in the lengths of the tracks between Angel\nand Eric. This poses whether Angel is coping with\nadverse wind conditions (during the segment with\nshort distances per day/night) while Eric would have\nstrong wind support.\nIn A6, the user investigated the coastline of the\nAtlantic ocean and selected the stopover covering this\narea in South France. After wondering whether he\nmissed some gulls within the selection, he inspected\nthe individual gulls (E6, T4). The domain expert dis-\ntinguished between gulls traveling up north at the\ncoastline, Anke, Sjarel, and Hilbran, southwards,\nRoxanne and Jasmin (partially), in both directions,\nLea, or not all, Joke and Ian. To investigate the migra-\ntion of gull Marie, a partial coastline migration, he\nneeded to zoom further to obtain a higher resolution\nfor the text labels of the stopovers. He wondered\nwhether he covered all of them, and hovered and\nselected other stopovers south of the previous selection\n(T3). Eventually, he noticed that those gulls are a sub-\nset of the previously analyzed gulls.\nA9 and A10 dealt with migration strategies at spe-\ncific locations (E1), Madrid, and Gibraltar. To obtain\na more detailed aggregation, the domain expert used\nthe slider in A9 first. Then, he noted movements\nwithin the density map in Madrid, and selected the\nstopover at Madrid, enumerated Joke, Lea, and\nMichelle, and noticed that only females visited the\nstopover (E2, T4). The expert defined a migration\nstrategy for a group or an individual by identifying the\nmost southern stopover during their/its migration\n(E5). By inspecting the individual trajectories, he\ntraced that Madrid was the most southern stopover for\nJoke during the migration. Lea, in contrast, visited a\nmore southern stopover and traveled a week later than\nJoke. The ecologist noticed instantly that Michelle has\nbeen recorded for 2 years and pursued different\nmigration strategies. At the stopover in Gibraltar\n(A10), the expert user often switched between the\nindividual trajectories of Annelies and Ella, the gulls\nstopping in Gibraltar, since he was interested whether\nboth were visiting England (E5). He summarized that\nAnnelies is migrating in a clockwise two-way migration\n(E1), and Ella migrates a year later than Annelies, vis-\nits England before migrating south (anticlockwise two-\nway migration) (see Figure 9). Then, the ecologist\nused date information within the green stopover of an\nindividual trajectory (T2) to accomplish this. He\nremarked that both pursued a coastline migration, and\nhe assumed that gulls learn to shortcut during migra-\ntion through experiences based on learned landmarks\nand resources from previous visits at the coastline. In\necology, it is commonly believed that bird species gain\na better navigation capacity over the years through\nlearning experiences of the past. Therefore, older birds\nare assumed to have better navigation abilities.\nThe final analytical task A11 of describing the\nmigration pattern over France was driven by the user's\ninterest in whether a stopover is used in a spring or\nFigure 8. Overview of the movements of gulls: (a) ``Angel''\nand (b) ``Eric.'' Both show considerable movement at night\nin France, Spain, and Portugal.\nautumn migration. He reflected first on the meaning\nof a migration pattern and defined it as how many\nstops do the gulls make (E2) and at what time do they\nstop (E3, T3). To accomplish this task, he selected the\nlargest stopover in Brittany and analyzed the temporal\ndistribution of the selection (T2) within the calendar\nby toggling between showing the distribution of all\nstopovers or at the selected one. The domain expert\nconcluded after investigating some other stopovers\n(E4) that the majority of stopovers in France is used\nduring spring migration, such as the large stopover in\nBrittany, and little during autumn migration. He\nfound this fact interesting because he assumed that the\ngulls would use them in both directions.\nReflections\nAfter the task-oriented questions, we asked the expert\nuser to apply the visual analytics tool on an area in\nwhich he is interested. He chose the stopover in\nEngland and wanted to know whether the visits to\nEngland were during, after, or before the breeding sea-\nson (E2). He zoomed into the area around England\nand analyzed the movements within the density map\n(E1). Using the aggregation slider, he obtained the fin-\nest resolution of the clustering. Next, by toggling the\ntemporal distribution between all stopovers and at the\nselected stopover, it became clear that the gulls visited\nEngland after breeding (E2), see Figure 10. The ecol-\nogist was surprised that the gulls visited England\nmainly in 2014. He hypothesized that this fact might\nbe weather related and depended on wind conditions\nas well (E5). Using a temporal restriction from mid-\nJuly to September, he found that the gulls Harry,\nJules, and Sanne were regular visitors of England. He\nwas surprised that these gulls visited England that\nearly (E3). The ecologist was also interested in investi-\ngating the difference among the entities (E6) between\ntwo time range selections. He used the tooltips within\nthe calendar heavily to perform this comparison.\nAfter that, we asked the ecologist to elaborate his\nreasoning behind the selection mechanisms. Regarding\norigin-destination selections, he would not select more\nthan three stopovers at the same time, and he would\nlike to select regions only at a very aggregate level. In\nparticular, a gridded map to select areas of interest,\nsuch as cities or agricultural regions, would be benefi-\ncial to the expert user. This indicates that a hierarchical\nclustering, as we employed it, is crucial to aggregate\nstopovers dynamically on different spatial scales.\nThe time restriction within the calendar has been\nused by the expert user to isolate yearly cycles, and it\nwas easy for him to identity pre-, post-, and peribreed-\ning visits in this way.\nThen, we asked him to outline his workflow after find-\ning something of interest in our tool and to contemplate\non the purpose of our approach. The expert user saw our\napproach as ``a visual data querying tool'' to generate sub-\nsets of the data set. He would select individuals showing\na certain behavior and look at their space-time usage after\nfinding something of interest. Subsequently, he would\ncontinue his research by computing some metrics, corre-\nlations, and statistics on the selected individuals in R to\ntest a hypothesis on these groups. This confirms that our\napproach helps ecologists to explore and identify migra-\ntion patterns visually and interactively before they pro-\nceed with non-visual analytical tasks.\nBy exploiting spatio-temporal relations between\nstopover sites, showing characteristics on a particular\nstopover, and visualizing spatio-temporal properties of\nan individual's trajectory in our tool, we enhance such\nanalytical tasks for ecologists from manually extraction\nthrough custom prototyping--which would consume\nseveral hours--to a visual user interaction that takes a\ncouple of minutes. Furthermore, an ecologist can\nidentify individuals with a certain migration strategy\nand also infer migration routes of individuals36 at a\nselected stopover site. Hence, our approach enables\necologists to visualize movement data sets with many\nmovement tracks as well as individuals in the trajec-\ntory aggregation and thus speeds up the inspection\nprocess of discovering interesting stopover sites, indi-\nviduals, or tracks drastically.\nFigure 9. Trajectory visualization for (a) gull Annelies,\nwhich is migrating in a clockwise two-way migration, and\n(b) gull Ella, which visits England before migrating south\n(anticlockwise).\nConclusion\nThis study presents a novel approach to visually explore\nmigratory trajectory data. We computed an aggregation\nof stopovers from those trajectories and the movements\nbetween them in different spatial scales and visualized\nit interactively together with a density map and a calen-\ndar view. To investigate the tracks interactively, we\nenable the user to select stopovers and add restrictions\non spatio-temporal properties of the selection. By\napplying our approach to a data set of 75 migrating\nLesser Black-backed Gulls and by evaluating it with an\nexpert user, we validated our visual analytics tool.\nOur findings show that this exploratory visual ana-\nlytics tool supports ecologists to investigate research\nquestions on migration interactively. It especially\nenhances the identification of (groups of) individuals\nwith a characteristic spatio-temporal migration beha-\nvior, but also allows discovering stopover sites with\nenvironmentally conditions which stand out.\nAs we used a single criterion on all stopover sites\nand individuals within our clustering, we think it is\nworthwhile to investigate varying rules per individual\nand per region. This would help to enhance the aggre-\ngation of stopovers to be more flexible.\nAs part of future work, we plan to integrate environ-\nmental data, such as information on land use, weather\nconditions (primarily wind), sea currents, and daylight,\nto facilitate the spatial exploration in the context of rel-\nevant variables.\n"
