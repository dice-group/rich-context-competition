    "abstract": "Abstract\nNeural tube defects (NTDs) can be reduced by 50% to 70% with sufficient periconceptional intake of folic acid. Hispanic\nwomen are up to 3 times more likely than non-Hispanics to have a child affected by NTDs. This disparity is complicated\nby health literacy, as women impacted by this disparity are also at-risk for low health literacy. The purpose of this project\nwas to pilot advertisements to promote multivitamins, increasing folic acid consumption, among Hispanic adolescents. The\nadvertisements for Hispanic adolescents and their mothers focused on broad benefits of a multivitamin, downplaying folic\nacid's role in prenatal health. Participants were Hispanic mothers (n = 25) and adolescents (n = 25) at a clinic in the\nSouthwestern United States. Likert-type survey items and an open-ended question were used to assess attitudes toward\nmultivitamins and advertisements. The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) was used to assess participants' health literacy. Participants'\nimpressions of the ads were positive. Both groups expressed the intent to start taking a daily multivitamin after viewing the\nads--adolescents for themselves and mothers to start their daughters on a daily multivitamin. There was no relationship\nbetween participants' health literacy and perceptions of the advertisements or intentions to begin a multivitamin habit. This\nresearch illustrates the potential of messages that rely on peripheral health benefits to overcome communication barriers\nposed by health literacy and address serious health problems such as NTDs.\n",

In a\nnormal pregnancy, the development and closure of the neural\ntube takes place within 28 days after conception. If the neural\ntube does not close completely, an NTD occurs (Helinski\net al., 2004). To reduce NTDs such as anencephaly, which is\nfatal to the newborn, and spina bifida, which often results in\nserious health complications, the U.S. Public Health Service\nrecommends all women capable of becoming pregnant con-\nsume 0.4 mg of folic acid per day (Prue, Hamner, & Flores,\n2010). Research indicates that periconceptional (at least 1\nmonth before conception and in early pregnancy) consump-\ntion of folic acid can decrease the risk of NTDs by 50% to\nrecommendation, a disparity in NTD-affected pregnancies\nexists among different racial and ethnic groups within the\nUnited States; prevalence rates for anencephaly in Hispanics\nand 1.80 for non-Hispanic Blacks. The prevalence of spina\nnon-Hispanic Whites, and 2.90 for non-Hispanic Blacks\n(Williams, Rasmussen, Flores, Kirby, & Edmonds, 2005).\nThe large-scale fortification of grains by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 has helped reduce\nthe occurrence of NTD (Prue et al., 2010); however, fewer\nthan 8% of all women reach the daily recommended level of\nfolic acid with fortification alone (Lindsey et al., 2009).\nMultivitamin supplements are a convenient way to ensure\nadequate intake of folic acid. Health promotion efforts by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the\nMarch of Dimes, and other organizations have had some suc-\ncess in increasing folic acid awareness among women of\nchildbearing age--reporting a 17% increase in knowledge\n1The University of Texas at Austin, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael Mackert, Department of Advertising and Public Relations, The\nEmail: mackert@utexas.edu\nPromoting Multivitamins to\nHispanic Adolescents and Mothers:\nCommunicating Benefits That Resonate\nMichael Mackert1, Erin Donovan1, and Marie Guadagno1\n Keywords\nhealth literacy, health communication, literacy\n2 SAGE Open\n(Thomas, Hauser, Rodriguez, & Quinn, 2010). However,\nresearch measuring the effectiveness of multivitamin promo-\ntion campaigns often reports limited success in such efforts,\noften due to target audiences that are too narrowly or broadly\ndefined or culturally irrelevant messages (Flores, Prue, &\nin this sphere remains high.\nWhile folic acid education is vital to all women, research\nhas found that Hispanic women in particular are significantly\nless likely than non-Hispanics to be aware of the benefits of\nfolic acid in reducing serious birth defects (Kannan et al.,\n2007). Products made from corn masa flour, which are\ndietary staples in many Hispanic communities, are also\nexcluded from the FDA's current mandatory grain fortifica-\ntion, possibly contributing to the lack of sufficient folic acid\nintake among Hispanic women (CDC, 2010). Spanish-\nspeaking women are reported to have lower multivitamin\nusage than their English-speaking counterparts (Thomas et\nal., 2010). They also have the highest rate of NTD-affected\nestablishes that a substantial disparity exists between\nHispanic and non-Hispanic women with regard to folic acid\nknowledge: that it can prevent NTDs, how to consume folic\nacid, the amount to consume, and when to consume it (Quinn,\nThomas, Hauser, Rodr\u00edguez, & Rodriguez-Snapp, 2009).\nThis serious health issue becomes more urgent due to the\nfact that the Hispanic population is one of the fastest growing\nof the total population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006). Hispanic\nwomen generally begin to have children at a younger age and\ncontinue to have children as they age. The short birth inter-\nvals that tend to occur among Hispanic women may also lead\nto further folate depletion (O'Rourke & Roddy, 2007). The\nrate of unintended pregnancies is also highest among poor\nHispanic women (Prue et al., 2010). Due to their dispropor-\ntionate rate of neural tube\u00adrelated birth defects, their fre-\nquency of births and their unintended pregnancy rates, there\nremains a pressing need for effective health promotion\nefforts designed to reach this vulnerable audience.\nMaking the problem of promoting folic acid for prenatal\ncare even more difficult to address is the fact that approxi-\nmately 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned\nand that the highest rate of these unintended pregnancies\net al., 2010). Due to the higher rate of unintended pregnan-\ncies in younger women, research has focused on folic acid\nawareness and pregnancy health efforts targeting late high\nschool and college-aged women (Flores & Kilker, 2007;\nLindsey et al., 2009), meaning younger audiences have not\nbeen targeted by health promotion campaigns.\nGiven the health disparity among Hispanic women and\nthe higher rate of unplanned pregnancies in young women,\nthe purpose of this project was to develop and pilot test a\npublic health campaign that could be used to promote a\nmultivitamin habit (and thus increase folic acid intake)\namong female Hispanic adolescents regardless of their inten-\ntions to become pregnant. This overall strategy would\ninvolve advertisements to reach the mothers of the adoles-\ncents and the adolescents themselves, such that actual behav-\nior change could be driven directly (reaching adolescents)\nand indirectly (through their mothers).\nBackground\nIn seeking to create new health promotion campaigns to\naddress the issue of NTDs, it is useful to provide background\non health literacy as context for developing new campaigns\nand the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a conceptual frame-\nwork for thinking through what new campaigns might look\nlike.\nHealth literacy is an individual's ability to obtain, process,\nand act on health information (Ad Hoc Committee on Health\nLiteracy, 1999). Low health literacy often leads to poorer\nhealth outcomes due to a variety of factors, including the\nindividual's lack of understanding health professional's\ninstructions (DeWalt, Berkman, Sheridan, Lohr, & Pignone,\net al., 2002). Factors such as age, low socioeconomic status,\nand being part of a minority or immigrant population can\nimpair health literacy (Ad Hoc Committee on Health\nLiteracy, 1999). Hispanic women often have many of the risk\nfactors associated with being low health literate, especially if\nEnglish is not their native language (Ad Hoc Committee on\nHealth Literacy, 1999; Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer, & Kindig,\n2004). When developing health promotion efforts to address\na specific issue, such as increasing folic acid consumption\namong Hispanic women, it is pertinent to understand the\nneeds of individuals with lower health literacy.\nIn addition to recognizing the information needs of low-\nhealth-literate audiences, it is crucial to consider how indi-\nviduals process health messages and take action on them.\nThe HBM is a theory that attempts to predict health-related\nbehaviors based on perceptions about a condition and the\nrecommended behaviors that prevent or reduce it (Janz &\nBecker, 1984). According to this model, an individual's per-\nceived susceptibility to a condition and the severity of its\nconsequences contribute to the overall perceived threat. That\nthreat can lead to a correct course of action if the individual\nperceives that the negative health outcome can be avoided.\nThe HBM suggests individuals are more likely to act on a\nrecommendation if they have knowledge of the negative con-\ndition and/or if they are reminded by cues from media cam-\npaigns, health professionals, family or friends (Janz,\nChampion, & Strecher, 2002). Targeted health promotions\ncan influence and increase knowledge of a negative condi-\ntion and also serve as cues to take preventive action, and with\nits focus on perceived benefits and barriers as major con-\ntributors to health behavior change, the HBM is a particu-\nlarly useful theoretical framework for developing new health\nMackert et al. 3\npromotion campaigns. In the case of this study, the HBM\nwas used to design campaign materials and the instruments\nused to assess their impact.\nResearch Questions\nThis investigation was guided by two primary research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: Can health promotion materials be\ndeveloped that successfully persuade Hispanic adoles-\ncents and their mothers to start a daily multivitamin habit,\nthus increasing folic acid intake?\nResearch Question 2: Can these materials be developed\nsuch that health literacy does not play a role in eventual\nimpact on intentions to start a daily multivitamin habit?\nThe study used a convenience sample to investigate the\npotential of the advertisements (individual messages/post-\ners) developed for this project, consistent with the key role of\nmessage pre-testing in developing health communication\ncampaigns (overarching communication program) that can\nthen be deployed on a larger scale (National Cancer Institute,\nMethod\nDesign\nAdvertisements were designed to encourage multivitamin\nusage among Hispanic adolescent females (ages 13-18). The\nadvertisements targeted the mothers of Hispanic adolescents\nand the adolescents themselves to encourage multivitamin\nusage. The overall strategy focused on broader benefits of\nmultivitamin usage, deemphasizing the specific role of folic\nacid in prenatal health, to build a long-lasting multivitamin\nhabit that would benefit the Hispanic adolescents and pre-\npare them for a healthy pregnancy with sufficient folic acid\nif and when they become pregnant--whether that pregnancy\nis intended.\nThe advertisements were designed based on reviews of\nrelevant literature and existing folic acid promotion cam-\npaigns, a series of classroom exercises which challenged\ngraduate advertising students to promote folic acid among\nHispanic females, and insights garnered through formative\nresearch with Hispanic women (Mackert, Kahlor, Silva, &\nPadilla, 2010). Specific insights from Mackert, Kahlor,\nSilva, & Padilla (2010) that were utilized in the develop-\nment of these campaigns included: avoiding dense blocks\nof small text that were deemed to be overwhelming by\nlow-health-literate participants, with resulting ads featur-\ning limited text; a preference for headlines that got partici-\npants' attention and made them want to read more, such as\nthrough asking a question; participants did not perceive\nmajor barriers to consuming a daily multivitamin, so ads\ndid not address potential barriers; a desire for a fear appeal\nto raise awareness of the issue, which led to a \"You Got\nLucky\" headline; and a knowledge of the benefits of folic\nacid among mothers that came from their first pregnancy,\nwhich led to the overall communication strategy of target-\ning mothers already aware of the general importance of\nfolic acid.\nTeams of advertising students then developed one adver-\ntisement for Hispanic moms of adolescents (see Figure 1)\nand two advertisements for Hispanic adolescents (see\nFigure 2 for one ad; the other featured similar text, but a sin-\ngle large photo). The ad designed for mothers was meant to\ndescribe a range of health benefits to taking a multivitamin,\nsuch as lowering the risk of heart disease; the ad highlighted,\nbut did not focus exclusively on, the value of folic acid. The\nads designed for adolescents were intended to highlight more\nshort-term and concrete benefits of a multivitamin, such as\nboosting energy and muscle function, and it excluded any\nspecific information about folic acid.\nAs noted earlier, the HBM was used as a theoretical\nframework to guide message design. The HBM was used to\nframe campaign messages, highlighting perceived benefits\nFigure 1. \"You Got Lucky\" Targeting Mothers.\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 2. \"What's Her Secret?\" Targeting Adolescents.\nthat would be relevant to participants and downplaying or\neven omitting messages related to barriers (due to the sim-\nplicity of taking a multivitamin) and severity of failure to\ntake a multivitamin with folic acid (because a birth affected\nby NTDs would likely not be a relevant health issue to the\nadolescents being targeted with this campaign). For adoles-\ncents and mothers, there was an emphasis on the use of plain\nlanguage whenever possible and the use of visuals and head-\nlines to catch the audience's attention and encourage them to\nengage with processing campaign messages. Additional\ndetails on the process of campaign development are provided\nMeasures\nThe study protocol was approved by the relevant Institutional\nReview Board. All participants provided appropriate consent\nprior to participating in the project, and they were given\nUS$25 gift cards to a local retailer to compensate them for\ntheir time.\nThe purpose of this pilot project was to assess the poten-\ntial of advertisements to promote multivitamin usage among\nHispanic adolescents as a way to increase folic acid intake.\nAs such, it was necessary to garner the opinions of mothers\nof these adolescents and the adolescents themselves. To that\nend, mothers of adolescents and adolescents were surveyed\nto determine their attitudes regarding the potential benefits\nof multivitamin usage, the advertisements developed for this\nproject, and the impact of the advertisements on their atti-\ntudes and intentions to start a daily multivitamin habit.\nGuided by the HBM, single-item measures were designed to\nreflect specific messages about the perceived benefits of a\nmultivitamin that were included in each advertisement; the\nadvertisements for mothers and adolescents included differ-\nent messages about benefits, resulting in different survey\nitems for each group. Survey items are provided for mothers\n(Table 1) and adolescents (Table 2) with all using a 7-point\nLikert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly\nagree).\nAgraduate student administered the surveys orally in one-\non-one sessions with participants, to avoid potential issues\nwith participants' reading level confounding results; ads\nwere shown without commentary from the graduate student\ncollecting data. All participants also provided basic demo-\ngraphic information and completed the Newest Vital Sign\n(NVS) to assess health literacy (Weiss et al., 2005). The NVS\nis a 6-item assessment of health literacy that correlates well\nwith other established health literacy measures (Weiss et al.,\nchance of limited health literacy, a 2 to 3 score suggests the\npossibility (25%) of limited health literacy, and a score of 4\nor greater reflects adequate health literacy. Participants were\nalso given an opportunity to share any other thoughts they\nmight have after viewing the advertisements.\nAnalytic Strategy\nStandard descriptive statistics were used to assess partici-\npants' perceptions of the advertisements developed for this\nproject, perceived benefits of taking multivitamins, and\nintentions to start a daily multivitamin habit. Paired-samples\nt tests were used to assess the impact of the study advertise-\nments on participants before and after viewing them.\nCorrelations were used to assess the relationship between\nparticipants'health literacy and attitudes toward the ads, per-\nceived benefits of multivitamins, and intentions to start a\ndaily multivitamin habit.\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited in the waiting room of a nonprofit\nhealth clinic that operates in a midsize Texas city; flyers were\nposted in the waiting room stating the inclusion criteria for\nthe study, and interested participants were directed to a grad-\nuate student collecting data. The clinic serves approximately\n10,000 patients per year, the majority of whom are Hispanic\n(75%), female (72%), and at or below the poverty line (74%).\nParticipants were recruited and interviewed in English,\nbecause campaign materials were originally developed in\nMackert et al. 5\nEnglish; in addition, the patient population at the recruitment\nsite features a roughly equal split between English and\nSpanish as a preferred language, with the adolescent popula-\ntion showing a two-to-one preference for English.\nA total of 50 (N = 50) Hispanic participants were recruited\nfor this study, including 25 mothers (n = 25) with at least one\nthese were individual mothers and adolescents, not dyads of\nmothers with their own daughters.

As can be seen in Table 1, paired-samples\nt tests indicated the ad increased mothers' beliefs that a mul-\ntivitamin could improve appearance of hair and skin, help\nprevent cancer, may help with depression, lowers risk of\nheart disease, reduces risk of birth defects, can lower risk of\nstroke, and can improve memory.\nWhile the ad was not designed to eliminate the belief\nthat multivitamins can cause weight gain nor shift attitudes\nabout the expense of multivitamins, there were small (though\nnot statistically significant) decreases on those items. The ad\nalso did not significantly increase mothers' level of worry\nabout the health of their daughters. Results also indicate the\nmothers believed the ad was useful and informative. The find-\nings also show the mothers approved of the appearance of the\nad and believed it would be effective on others like them.\nThe mothers expressed strong intentions to start their\ndaughters on a daily multivitamin (M = 6.8; SD = 0.7). While\nthe ad was not designed to encourage the mothers themselves\nto start a daily multivitamin habit, it appears many mothers\ninternalized the health benefits and expressed intentions\nto start taking a daily multivitamin for themselves (M = 6.5;\nA series of correlations were utilized to test the potential\nrelationship between the mothers' health literacy (as mea-\nsured by the NVS) and their evaluation of the ad, intentions\nto start their daughters on a multivitamin and intentions to\nstate taking a multivitamin themselves. There was no evi-\ndence that health literacy was related to mothers'reactions to\nthe ads, which was a positive finding given the ads were\nintended to be accessible and persuasive to low-health-liter-\nate audiences.\nAs noted earlier, participants were given a chance to share\nany other thoughts they might have after viewing the adver-\ntisements. Talking about what she might say to her daughter,\none mother stated: \"It helps keep you healthy, smart (mem-\nory), can make her future babies healthy, acne and hair (she'd\nbuy into it helping her appearance).\" Another participant\nsaid, \"I think she'd be willing to. I'd take them with her, say-\ning we could take them together because it would be good for\nboth of us.\" One mother expressed concern about the term\nfolic acid, saying, \"`Acid'scares me, and I think that this acid\nwould be bad for me.\" Finally, several participants com-\nmented on the colors of the advertisement, suggesting\nbrighter colors might be better.\nAdolescents\nAdolescents were asked to respond to a series of statements\nabout benefits of and barriers to taking a multivitamin before\nand after viewing the ads. As can be seen in Table 2, paired-\nsamples t tests indicated the ad increased adolescents'beliefs\nthat a multivitamin could help improve appearance of hair,\nskin, and nails, as well as boost energy.\nThe ads did not achieve significant improvements in ado-\nlescents'beliefs that a multivitamin could help build stronger\nbones, be helpful even if someone has a healthy diet, or is a\ngood way to stay healthy. The ads were not designed to\naddress the mistaken belief that a multivitamin can contrib-\nute to weight gain, nor that a multivitamin every day can be\nexpensive, and the ads did not significantly shift beliefs\nabout these items. They also were not designed to rely on a\nfear appeal to motivate behavior change, so the lack of a sig-\nnificant shift in adolescents' perceptions of their health was\nas intended.\nAdolescents' views of the ads themselves--that they\nincluded useful information, were easy to understand, looked\ngood, and would be liked by people like them--were not as\npositive as the ad designed for mothers. Given this, the ads\ndid lead to relatively strong intentions for the adolescents to\nstart taking a multivitamin every day (M = 5.7; SD = 1.4).\nAs with the mothers, these ads were designed to be acces-\nsible and persuasive to low-health-literate audiences.Aseries\nof correlations found no significant relationship between the\nadolescents' health literacy (as measured by the NVS) and\ntheir perceptions of the ads or their intentions to start taking\na multivitamin every day.\nAdolescent participants were also asked to share any\nthoughts they had after viewing the advertisements. Discussing\nwhat she might say to her mom about a multivitamin, one par-\nticipant said, \"I want to take a multivitamin to keep myself\nhealthy, strong, and energetic.\" Another reported, \"This has\nactually made me really want to buy and take them.\" Concerns\nabout taste of multivitamins emerged as a potential barrier,\nhowever: \"I don't like the taste of them.\"\nDiscussion\nGiven the importance of promoting folic acid to reduce the\nincidence of NTDs in general, and the disparity impacting\nHispanics in particular, it is crucial to continue to explore\nnew health promotion strategies for increasing folic acid\nintake. The advertisements developed for this project were\ndesigned to increase multivitamin consumption--and thus\nfolic acid intake--among Hispanic adolescents by promot-\ning the benefits of multivitamins to the mothers of adoles-\ncents and the adolescents themselves. Such a strategy,\nfocused on broader benefits of a daily multivitamin habit,\ncould help prepare these adolescents for a healthy preg-\nnancy--whenever that might happen--whether that preg-\nnancy is planned or unplanned.\nMackert et al. 7\nOverall, the response to the advertisements was positive,\nwith mothers having a more favorable impression of the ads\nand the content than the adolescents. The advertisements\nwere successful in shifting beliefs about the benefits of con-\nsuming multivitamins, leading to intentions to start taking a\nmultivitamin; intentions were stronger for mothers (for start-\ning their daughters and themselves on a daily multivitamin)\nthan for the adolescents themselves. The stronger reaction of\nthe mothers may be due to the inclusion of relatively novel\ninformation (e.g., the potential of a multivitamin to help pre-\nvent cancer) in the advertisement targeting mothers, leading\nto stronger intentions. Previous research demonstrates that\nnew or surprising information increases the likelihood that\naudiences will attend to messages (O'Keefe, 2002).\nIt is important to note there was no relationship between\nparticipants' health literacy and their perceptions of the\nadvertisements or stated intentions regarding initiating a\ndaily multivitamin habit. These advertisements were\ndesigned to be accessible and persuasive to low-health-liter-\nate audiences, so the lack of a relationship between health\nliteracy and intentions is an encouraging finding. Thus, it\ndemonstrates the potential of a health promotion model\ndesigned to utilize education and persuasion--finding bene-\nfits that will be most persuasive to engage the target audience\nand change health behavior regardless of an individual's\nhealth literacy. In this case, the campaign was designed to\nreduce the focus on folic acid as a way to have a healthy\npregnancy, which is likely an important step in addressing\nthis problem for pregnancies which are not planned.\nBefore considering implications for future research and\npractice, it is important to recognize the limitations of this\nresearch. Most significantly, participants expressed their\nintentions to start their daughters (for mothers) or themselves\n(for adolescents) on a daily multivitamin; while intentions\nare a strong predictor of actual behavior (Ajzen, 1991), this\npilot work did not track participants' actual behavior over\ntime. This study was conducted in English, so the potential\nof this approach to engage and promote behavior change\nHispanics who do not speak English cannot be established;\nstudy results suggest translation to Spanish and further test-\ning is warranted. Finally, this research was conducted with\nparticipants drawn from a single clinic in Texas, which may\nlimit generalizability to other populations.\nEven with these limitations, this work points to interest-\ning directions for future research. A first important direction\nis to investigate the potential gap between stated intentions\nand actual behavior. Continued investigation of this cam-\npaign would require a longitudinal assessment of the short-\nterm and long-term impacts of the campaign on participants'\nactual behavior. Another likely outcome of this campaign is\ninterpersonal conversation between a mother and daughter,\nas the mother explains to her daughter why she should take a\nmultivitamin or the daughter explains to her mom why she\nwould like to start taking a multivitamin. Future research\ncould investigate those conversations and which are more or\nless likely to contribute to the daughter eventually starting to\ntake a multivitamin and maintaining that habit. While this\nproject relied on the HBM to guide the investigation, the\nuseful theoretical framework for considering the role of\nsocial norms around a health behavior such as a daily multi-\nvitamin. In addition, these advertisements did not address\nany barriers to starting a multivitamin habit, largely due to\nformative research and the fact that messages about barriers\ndid not fit the layout and theme of these advertisements;\nfuture research, utilizing different messages or layouts, might\nincorporate details about perceived barriers (e.g., concerns\nabout the term folic acid or taste of a multivitamin) and eval-\nuate the impact of these messages on recipients'intentions to\nstart a daily multivitamin habit.\nThis campaign was designed to reach Hispanic adoles-\ncents and their mothers, but the targeting of these campaigns\nwas generally subtle (e.g., the name of the girl in the ad\nshown in Figure 2). Future research should assess how indi-\nviduals of different ethnicities respond to these advertise-\nments. Particularly, given the budget constraints under which\npublic health campaigns must operate, a targeted campaign\nthat can remain persuasive to broader audiences while\nappealing to Hispanic populations would be valuable. Such a\nstrategy could address not just a disparity (in this case, the\ndisparity in NTDs impacting Hispanics) but a pressing, pop-\nulation-wide problem (the continued incidence of NTDs in\nthe general population in the face of public health efforts to\neliminate this health concern).\nApractical challenge in promoting folic acid (alone or as one\nbenefit of taking a multivitamin) is how to reach people with\nthat message. Future research must focus on the most effective\nplacements for posters and other media, preferably places where\nthe target audience spends time more frequently than doctor's\noffices--one example might be grocery stores (Mackert,\nKahlor, Silva, & Padilla, 2010) While this pilot research estab-\nlished the potential of these advertisements, it is a necessity to\ndemonstrate the \"real-world\" impact on multivitamin consump-\ntion as part of a large-scale social marketing campaign.\nAddressing the problems of NTDs, in general and the dis-\nparity impacting Hispanics, remains a pressing public health\nissue. While existing health promotion efforts have begun to\naddress the problem, there remains a need to develop new\nand alternative strategies to increase folic acid intake. This\nresearch demonstrates the potential efficacy of encouraging\na multivitamin habit among Hispanic adolescents and their\nmoms--a strategy that relies on the fact that other health\nbenefits of a multivitamin might be more salient than mes-\nsages focusing on prenatal health and that particular benefit\nof folic acid. Public health researchers and practitioners must\ncontinue to explore the potential of campaigns that rely on\n8 SAGE Open\nperipheral health benefits of a recommended health behavior\nto address health problems where education or engagement\non the \"main\" health issue can be difficult to achieve.\nMore broadly, issues associated with health literacy per-\nmeate the health care system, resulting in poorer health out-\ncomes for low-health-literate populations. Addressing those\nproblems will involve building individuals' health literacy,\neducating health care providers to better care for low-health-\nliterate patients, and making changes to the health care sys-\ntem itself. This research serves as evidence of the utility of\npublic health messages relying on persuasion and potentially\nperipheral health messages to improve health promotion to\nlow-health-literate audiences. The specific context of this\nstudy was prenatal health promotion, but these findings can\nbe extended to other pressing health issues.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthors received support from The University of Texas College of\nCommunication for this research.\nReferences\nAd Hoc Committee on Health Literacy.
