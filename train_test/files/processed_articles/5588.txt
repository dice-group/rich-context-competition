It has been estimated that the global burden of\ndiabetes will further increase to more than 550 million by\n2030.1 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most\ncommon form of diabetic neuropathy associated with the\nmicrovascular, long-term complications of T2DM. The\npathogenesis of DPN has not been understood completely.\nThere is a common view that DPN is a multifactorial dis-\nease caused by complex interactions between a variety of\ngenetic and environmental factors.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an important\ncomponent of the renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) that con-\nverts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II. It has been suggested\nthat high levels ofAng II may play a key role in glucose and\ninsulin regulation, and may increase the risk of diabetes.2 In\naddition, Shiuchi et al. showed that Ang II type-1 receptor\nblockade increased insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in\nskeletal muscle of diabetic mice.3 Furthermore,ACE inhibi-\ntor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may\ndecrease patients' odds of developing new-onset T2DM.4\nThus, high levels of ACE and Ang II might play an impor-\ntant role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.\nchromosome in human.5 Within intron 16 a polymorphism\nexists, consisting of the presence or absence of a 287-bp\nfragment.6 The ACE genotype is classified into three types:\nII, DD, and ID. The serumACE levels of DD homozygotes\nare approximately twice as high as those of II genotype\nindividuals.7 The serum ACE levels of ID type are inter-\nmediate.7 Recently, Niu et al. found that the ACE D allele\nwas associated with an increased risk of T2DM.8 Wang\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme I/D\npolymorphism and diabetic peripheral\nneuropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus:\nA meta-analysis\nYao Li and Nanwei Tong\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, polymorphism, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, genetic, association study\nDepartment of Endocrinology, West China Hospital of Sichuan\nUniversity, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.\nCorresponding author:\nNanwei Tong, Department of Endocrinology, West China Hospital of\nSichuan University, South of Chengdu City Guoxue Lane 37, Chengdu\nOriginal Article\n788 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nand coworkers suggested that ACE I/D polymorphism\nmay contribute to diabetic nephropathy development.9 In\naddition, Lu and colleagues showed that I/D polymor-\nphism in the ACE gene was associated with diabetic\nHowever, whether ACE I/D polymorphism is associ-\nated with DPN is still unclear. Li found that the ACE D\nallele was significantly linked with essential hypertension\nsusceptibility.11 Forrest et al. suggested that hypertension\nwas an independent predictor of the incidence of DPN.12\nThese results indicated that ACE I/D polymorphism may\nbe involved in the development of DPN. Several studies\nhave investigated this issue to date.13-19 The results, how-\never, were inconsistent and conflicting. This present meta-\nanalysis was performed to evaluate the association between\nthis polymorphism and DPN.\nMaterials and methods\nPublication search\nOnline electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) were\nsearched using the search terms: (angiotensin-converting\nenzyme or ACE) and (polymorphism or variant or varia-\ntion) and (diabetes mellitus or neuropathy). Additional\nstudies were identified by a hand search from the refer-\nences of original studies or review articles on this topic.\nThere was no language restriction.\nStudy selection\nThe following inclusion criteria were used: (1) the study\nshould have evaluated the association between the ACE\nI/D polymorphism and DPN risk; (2) the study should\nhave a case-control design; (3) sufficient data should have\nbeen provided in order to calculate odds ratios (OR) and\n95% confidence interval (CI), or the studies offered ORs\nand 95% CIs. Studies were excluded if any of the follow-\ning conditions applied: (1) only abstracts or reviews were\navailable, without sufficient data; (2) animal studies; (3)\nstudies were repeated or publications overlapped.\nData extraction and qualitative assessment\nThe following data were recorded from each article: first\nauthor, year of publication, ethnicity of participants, num-\nbers of cases and controls, and genotype numbers in cases\nand controls. The data were extracted by two authors inde-\npendently. Discrepancies between two authors were\nresolved by discussion.\nTwo authors completed the quality assessment indepen-\ndently. The Newcastle\u00adOttawa Scale (NOS) was used to\nevaluate the methodological quality, which scored studies\nby the selection of the study groups, the comparability of the\ngroups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of interest. We\nmoderate-, or high-quality study, respectively. Discrepancies\nwere resolved by consensus and discussion.\nStatistical analysis\nThe strength of association between the ACE I/D poly-\nmorphism and DPN risk was assessed by calculating ORs\nwith 95% CI. The pooled ORs were performed for reces-\nsive model since most of the studies reported the results in\nthis genetic model. Departure from Hardy\u00adWeinberg\nequilibrium (HWE) in controls was tested by the Chi-\nsquare test. A statistical test for heterogeneity was per-\nformed based on the Q statistic. The p>0.10 of the Q-test\nindicated a lack of heterogeneity among studies. If hetero-\ngeneity was observed among the studies, the random-\neffects model was used to estimate the pooled OR (the\nDerSimonian and Laird method). Otherwise, the fixed-\neffects model was adopted (the Mantel\u00adHaenszel method).\nStratified analysis was performed by ethnicity. To explore\nthe source of the heterogeneity, Galbraith plots were used.\nTo access the stability of the meta-analysis, one-way sen-\nsitivity analysis was conducted. Cumulative meta-analysis\nwas also performed. Because no more than 10 studies\nwere included in this meta-analysis, we did not assess the\npublication bias. All statistical tests were performed with\nthe software STATA version 11.0 (Stata Corporation,\nCollege station, TX, USA). A p value <0.05 was consid-\nered statistically significant.\nResults\nEligible studies\nA total of seven articles on ACE I/D polymorphism and\nDPN risk met the study inclusion criteria, and were\nand 1617 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Six\ncase-control studies included Caucasian populations,\nwhile only one study included an Asian population. Four\nstudies reported the adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. All studies\nwere assessed by NOS. The quality scores ranged from 6\nto 9, suggesting that the methodological quality was\nacceptable. Two studies did not provided the genotype\nnumbers of ACE I/D polymorphism among DPN cases and\ncontrols. Other studies suggested that the distribution of\ngenotypes in the controls was consistent with HWE. The\ncharacteristics of each case-control study and the genotype\nin each study are presented in Tables 1 and 2.\nMeta-analysis\nThe DD + DI genotype of ACE I/D polymorphism was\nassociated with a significantly increased risk of DPN\nwhen compared with the II genotype (OR=1.46, 95%CI\nby ethnicity, the significantly elevated risk was observed\nI2=43%). Four studies reported adjusted ORs. The com-\nAs shown in Figure 2, significant associations were evi-\ndent with each addition of more data over time. The results\nshowed that the pooled ORs tended to be stable. A single\nstudy involved in the meta-analysis was deleted each time\nto reflect the influence of the individual data set to the\npooled ORs, and the corresponding pooled ORs were not\nmaterially altered (Figure 3).\nThe Galbraith plot was used to find the source of the\nheterogeneity. As shown in Figure 4, two studies might be\nthe source of the heterogeneity. After excluding these stud-\nies, the between-study heterogeneity effectively decreased\nand there was no obvious heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.70).\nBesides, the result was still statistically significant\nDiscussion\nThis meta-analysis of seven case-control studies system-\natically evaluated the association between ACE I/D poly-\nmorphism and DPN risk. We found that ACE DD and DI\ngenotypes were significantly associated with DPN risk.\nThis result suggested that individuals with the DD or DI\ngenotype had an increased DPN risk. In the subgroup anal-\nysis, we found that Caucasians with the DD or DI geno-\ntype had an increased DPN risk. However, only one study\ninvestigated the association between ACE I/D polymor-\nphism and DPN risk in Asians. Thus, more studies are still\nneeded to determine the association between ACE I/D\npolymorphism and DPN risk in Asians.\nACE catalyzes the generation of Ang II from Ang I as\nwell as the cleavage of bradykinin. Ang II is a powerful\ncirculating vasoconstrictor, which may contribute to vascu-\nlar tone in nerve and muscle circulatory beds. It is clear that\nnerve blood flow deficits make an important contribution to\nthe pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.20 ACEI has been\nshown to protect against the loss of intraepidemal nerve\nfibers in a T2DM rat model.21 In terms of clinical trials,\nACEI produced some modest improvements in DPN.22 In\naddition, a lack of bradykinin receptors exacerbated dia-\nbetic complications, including DPN.23 These results sug-\ngested that high levels of ACE may play a critical role in\nthe development of DPN. Since ACE I/D polymorphism\nwas associated with plasma levels of ACE, it was possible\nthat this polymorphism might influence DPN risk.\nHeterogeneity is a potential problem that may affect the\ninterpretation of the results. We found that significant het-\nerogeneity existed in this meta-analysis. A Galbraith plot\nwas used to find the sources of heterogeneity. We found\nthat I2 value was decreased after excluding two studies.\nThe result suggested that these two studies may be the\nTable 1.

Moreover, heterogene-\nity did not influence the results, because the significance\nof the result was not altered after excluding the studies.\nResults from one-way sensitivity analysis suggested the\nstability of the result. In addition, the main result remained\nstatistically significant when the adjusted ORs were com-\nbined. All together, these results suggest that the results of\nthis meta-analysis are reliable.\nFigure 1. Meta-analysis for the association between DPN risk and the ACE I/D polymorphism.\nFigure 2. Cumulative meta-analysis for the association between DPN risk and the ACE I/D polymorphism.\nHowever, some limitations should be noted. First, sub-\ngroup analyses were not performed by factors such as gen-\nder and age because insufficient data could be extracted\nfrom the primary articles. Second, there was only one\ncase-control study that investigated the association of ACE\nI/D polymorphism with DPN risk in Asians. Therefore,\nmore studies with large sample sizes are needed to further\nidentify the association among Asians. Third, because of\nthe complex nature of DPN, it is unlikely that a polymor-\nphism in one single gene would be obviously associated\nwith DPN risk. However, insufficient data could be\nextracted from the primary studies. Therefore, we did not\nperform the analysis of other polymorphisms in ACE and a\nhaplotype analysis.\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that ACE\nI/D polymorphism was associated with an increased DPN\nFigure 3.
