    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe present the validation study of the Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale adult version, aimed to measure illusory\nbeliefs about health. The scale was administered to 643 participants (54.3% females), having an average age of 29.7\nyears (standard deviation\n=\n18.31). The results of the analyses confirmed the dimensions of the Paranormal Health\nBeliefs Scale as developed in the previous adolescent study (Beliefs: Religious, Superstitious, in Extraordinary Events,\nParapsychological, and Pseudo-scientific of a biomedical nature), as well as the convergent and discriminant validity\nthrough the correlation with other constructs (locus of control and self-efficacy). The results also showed significant\ndifferences between subgroups by gender and age. The Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale shows satisfactory psychometric\nproperties and thus may be used effectively to identify the varied range of illusory beliefs related to health, even within\nthe context of lifelong educational programs aimed at health promotion.\n",

In this regard, it appears rele-\nvant to understand better where persons stand with respect to\nthat set of beliefs surrounding the paranormal sphere, which\nmay become operative when one has to deal with issues\nrelated to health, thus influencing one's coping strategies,\noutcome expectancies, and the display of harmful behaviors.\nFurthermore, it is important to understand the role of illusory\nbeliefs about health even in the diagnostic and therapeutic\nprocess, and their eventual impact on the outcome, such as\nadherence to medical prescriptions and the duration and the\nresult of the treatment (Capone, 2016). In fact, it has already\nbeen shown that irrational beliefs about health were signifi-\ncant predictors of adherence to rehabilitative care in persons\naffected by cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Anderson\nParanormal beliefs are convictions relative to any phe-\nnomenon that in one or more ways exceeds the limits of\nwhat is deemed to be physically possible according to pre-\nvailing scientific assumptions.

Self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) must\nbe considered among the associations investigated with regard\nto illusory beliefs: persons having high levels of illusory\nbeliefs should present low levels of self-efficacy (Tobacyk and\nShrader, 1991). Understandably, the absence of a sense of self-\nefficacy, in circumstances that a person feels are potentially\nthreatening and unavoidable, such as the appearance of symp-\ntoms or the onset of an illness, might trigger an anxiety diffi-\ncult to deal with: thus, having at one's disposal a complex set\nof knowledge, even if baseless, such as beliefs in paranormal\nphenomena, can be very comforting.\nThe relationship between the paranormal and health has\nbeen accepted by some in terms of self-serving illusions\n(Taylor and Brown, 1988), in other words, illusory beliefs\nthat are certainly false, but which, however, allow the funda-\nmental function for mental health to create a \"filter\" through\nwhich reality acquires its own order and meaning. On the\nsubject, several studies have investigated the relationship\nbetween paranormal beliefs and mental health (Dag, 1999),\nfinding the existence of a significant and positive correlation\nmanic-depressive experiences (Thalbourne and French,\n1995); other studies have found some contradictory results\non the relationships between paranormal beliefs, neuroticism\nline of studies dealt with beliefs in complementary and alter-\nnative medicine (Bishop et al., 2007), and paranormal beliefs\nwere found as the strongest predictor of complementary and\nalternative medicine beliefs (Pettersen and Olsen, 2007; Van\nden Bulck and Custers, 2010). Other studies, with differ-\nences across gender and nationality, have found that some\ntypes of beliefs, such as religious and fatalistic, may inhibit\nhealth care utilization and health care behaviors, leading to\npoor health outcomes (Franklin et al., 2007; Gall et al.,\nered illusory beliefs specifically related to the sphere of\nhealth, such as the beliefs and practices of prompt healing,\nprotection from disease, and health promotion. From this\nstudy, it has emerged that adolescents have little tendency to\nbelieve in paranormal; furthermore, the boys have more con-\nfidence in medicine as science and have a tendency to rely on\na biomedical approach in relation to the protection of the spe-\ncies because they have been socialized to take more interest\nin and to be better informed about scientific matters than\nthere was a greater anchoring to the religious faith and faith\nin \"medical science\" in younger people.\nReview of instruments\nAt first time, the paranormal belief had been considered as an\nexpression of a relatively stable personality characteristic,\nwith the consequent definition of one-dimensional instruments\n(Randall and Desrosiers, 1980). Subsequently, Scheidt's\n(1973) hypothesis was established about the existence of two\nor more relatively independent dimensions (Clarke, 1991;\nThalbourne and Delin, 1993). Indeed, studies carried out\nsince the 1990s have shown the multidimensionality of such\nsystems of beliefs (Grimmer and White, 1990), which include\ndimensions related to alternative therapies, paratherapies, and\nfunctional and structural parapsychology (together with pop-\nular science, obscure unbelief, and traditional religion). The\nbest known instrument for detecting paranormal beliefs is the\nTobacyk and Milford, 1983) and validated in various contexts\n(Bouvet et al., 2014; D\u00edaz-Vilela and \u00c1lvarez-Gonz\u00e1lez,\ntional literature on paranormal beliefs, as well as of ethno-\ngraphic and psychosocial cutting literature, Petrillo and\nDonizzetti (2012) have developed the Paranormal Health\nBeliefs Scale (PHBS) that investigated adolescents' adher-\nence to the system of paranormal beliefs about health. The\nscale consists of 31 items that are distributed in five related\ndimensions: Religious Beliefs (RB) (\n=\nBeliefs (SB) (\n=\n.83), Extraordinary Events Beliefs (EEB)\n(\n=\n.79), Parapsychological Beliefs (PsiB) (\n=\nPseudo-scientific Beliefs of a biomedical nature (MedB)\n(\n=\n.67). To examine whether three factors tapped the same\ndimension, a second-order confirmatory factor analysis was\nconducted. This model fitted the data very well. Results high-\nlighted =.91. Furthermore, the construct and criterion valid-\nity were satisfactory. There are no other instruments in the\nreview of literature that can detect paranormal beliefs related\nto health.\nAims and hypothesis\nConsidering the lack of measures in this specific field, the\nobjective of this study was to attain the validation of the\nadult's version of the PHBS (Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012)\nfor adolescents. This scale is designed to measure the level\nof adhesion to illusory beliefs about health, understood as a\ncomplex and extensive system of beliefs, ranging from the\nsuperstitious and magical to those about the power of the\nmind and healers, as well as those of a traditional religious\ntype. For this purpose, we proposed to verify the psycho-\nmetric properties of the PHBS (dimensionality, reliability,\nand construct and content validity, as well as convergent and\ndiscriminant validity), and the existence of differences\naccording to gender and age, in order to prove that the PHBS\nis suitable to be usefully employed for the detection of the\narticulated range of the construct within the population.\nIt was hypothesized that the PHBS, adult version, would\nhave a multidimensional structure with five factors that\nwould converge in a single second-order dimension. In rela-\ntion to the verification of the validity of the instrument, con-\nsidering the above-mentioned literature on the subject, a\nDonizzetti and Petrillo 3\ngood content and construct validity was hypothesized. It was\nexpected that the concurrent validity would result in a sig-\nnificant and positive correlation between the scale used to\nmeasure the central construct in our study, and the scale used\nto measure the affine construct of external Health Locus of\nControl (HLC). However, regarding the discriminant valid-\nity, we hypothesized a significant and negative correlation\nbetween the Paranormal Health Beliefs (PHB) measure and\nthe measure of Internal Health Locus of Control, which is a\nconstruct complementary to that previously considered, as\nwell as a low negative correlation or a nil correlation with the\nGeneral Self-Efficacy (GSE) \nmeasure. Finally, we hypothe-\nsized differences between subgroups by gender and age, in\nline with literature available on the subject (Aarnio and\nMethod\nParticipants and procedures\nWe used a snowball sampling that relied on referral from\ninitial participants, starting from University Students\n(through word-of-mouth) to generate additional partici-\npants. A convenience sample of people was composed by\nmales and 54.3% females), with ages ranging between 18\ngrouped in the following four categories: youngsters\npants filled in an anonymous questionnaire on their own.\nMeasures and analyses\nMaking use of a quantitative methodology, a questionnaire\ncontaining various instruments was specifically designed.\nThe Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale (PHBS) follows the\nversion developed in a pilot study (Petrillo and Donizzetti,\n2012), from which emerged five dimensions of illusory\nbeliefs about health: RB (eight items), which invoke faith,\nGod, the guardian angels, and the saints, as well as the cult\nrelated to their relics, as elements of a speedy recovery, pro-\ntection from illness, and health promotion; SB (seven items),\nrelated to that combination of superstitious practices that are\nbelieved to ward off direct threats to health or other acciden-\ntal or intentional events that may endanger one's health; EEB\n(six items), deemed, in some way, to have an influence on\nhealth because of alien entities, forces of the universe,\nextraordinary astral phenomena, and the experience of\nexceptional conscious states; PsiB (six items), referring to\nmental energies as sources of positive or negative influence\non health, such that they may alter physiological parameters\nand provoke illness; MedB (four items), which refer to the\nnegative contribution for the health of the human species by\nspecific categories that are considered to be deviant or mar-\nginal social groups (homosexuals, immigrants), and to health\nthreats deriving from hereditary transmission or genetic con-\ntamination. The PHBS is composed of 31 items rated on a\n5-point Likert-type scale (from 1\n=\nStrongly Disagree to\n5=Strongly Agree): high scores relate to high levels of illu-\nsorybeliefsreferringtohealth(seeSupplementaryMaterials).\nThe General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) of Schwarzer\nthat subjects have in their own competences in facing\nadversary events. The Likert-type scale comprises 10 items\nwith an answering range of 4 points (from 1\n=\nTotally\nUntrue to 4=Totally True).\nThe Health Locus of Control Scale (HLCS) for adults\n(Donizzetti and Petrillo, 2015), useful for the measurement\nof the orientation of locus of control related to health in this\npopulation, is composed of three dimensions: Internal\nHealth Locus of Control (IHLC; eight items), God Health\nLocus of Control (GHLC; two items), and Other Health\nLocus of Control (OHLC; 3 items). The HLCS is made up\nof 13 items, with an answering range of 5 points (from\n=\nStrongly Disagree to 5\n=\nStrongly Agree). Finally, the\nquestionnaire included a section for the collection of socio-\ndemographic data (gender and age).\nThe verification of the factorial structure was computed\nthrough confirmatory factor analysis of first and second\norder, using Lisrel 8.54 software. The difference between the\nobserved and expected covariance matrices was evaluated by\nusing the association between the chi-squared distribution\nand the degrees of freedom (2/df), as well as Comparative\nFit Index (CFI), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), Root Mean\nSquare Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized\nRoot Mean Squared Residual (SRMR). The 2/df must be in a\nrange between 2 and 5; the values of the CFI and of the NNFI\nmust be>.90; those of RMSEA are considered to be good if\nthey are <.05 and acceptable if they are <.08 (McNeish et al.,\nanalysis of reliability was computed by using Cronbach's\nalpha, and is considered to be satisfactory if its values are\ngreater than .70; even an alpha between .60 and .69 would be\nconsidered acceptable (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). The\nconcurrent and discriminant validity were verified by means\nof Pearson's correlation analysis (p-value<.05). The differ-\nences between the subject groups were verified through anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA) (p-value<.05). The analyses of\nreliability, correlation, and variance were calculated by using\nIBM SPSS.22 software.\nResults\nVerification of the factorial structure, reliability,\nand validity\nThe internal consistency of the PHBS was verified by calcu-\nlating the corrected correlation between the score of the\n4 Health Psychology Open \nitems and the scale. The coefficients were considered ade-\nquate (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994) since they ranged\nMaximum Likelihood (ML) estimation was used in all the\nanalyses. Confirmatory factor analyses were computed to\nascertain the factor structure of the PHBS. Table 1 shows\nthat the five-factor structure as emerged with adolescents\n(Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012) was confirmed. The oblique\nfive-factor model fitted the data best, suggesting that PHBS\nis best understood in terms of five empirically related\ndimensions. The standardized regression coefficient weights\nof all variables loading onto their respective factors are\n(which means that all the regressions are statistically signifi-\ncant at the 95% confidence level). The five dimensions are\nrelated to each other with scores ranging from .45 to .74.\nMoreover, in order to verify the convergence of the five\ndimensions in the most general construct of illusory beliefs\nabout health, a second-order confirmatory factor analysis\nwas also performed (Figure 1). The fit indices were found\nto be even better than those in the basic (Table 1). The\nregression weights are very close and range from .47 to .82,\nand the standardized regression coefficients weights of all\ndimensions loading onto second-order factor are between\nindices show similar results as the first-order confirmatory\nfactor.\nThe reliability of the instrument resulted as excellent,\nwith =.92. Besides, reliability was also verified for each\nof the PHBS dimensions, with results ranging from satis-\nfactory to excellent (see Table 2). An analysis of the corre-\nlations between the PHBS and its five dimensions, as well\nas between these and the GSES and the HLCS, was carried\nout for the verification of the construct validity of the\ninstrument. With reference to the content validity, the\nresults of the analysis of the correlations demonstrate that\nall of the five dimensions of the PHBS are strongly corre-\nlated with the PHBS (see Table 2).\nWith regard to concurrent validity, it was found that the\ntwo dimensions of external HLC are significantly and pos-\nitively correlated with all the components of the PHBS;\nwith regard to the discriminant validity, it was found that\nall dimensions of the PHBS, except PsiB, result negatively\ncorrelated with the IHLC. Furthermore, as assumed, results\nshow that the PHBS is not correlated with GSES (Table 2).\nDescriptive statistics\nFrom the descriptive analyses, it resulted that the general\nlevel of PHB is on average equal to 2.07. Higher RB and\ntively), while the MedB stands around the average score\n(M\n=\n1.95); lower average scores are those related to the\nThe ANOVA by gender resulted in significant differ-\nsize=.017). Females have higher levels of RB (MM\nMF\n\n=\n2.56), while males have higher levels of MedB\n=1.86). The ANOVA carried out by age,\ntaking into consideration the four groupings, showed sig-\nnificant differences with respect to most of the dimensions\nunder study. In the light of the post hoc tests of Tukey, it\nresulted that, with regard to the PHB and the dimensions of\nthe RB and the MedB, the elderly have higher scores when\ncompared with those of the adults, young adults, and the\nyoungsters. Moreover, the elderly and youngsters have\nhigher scores than young adults and adults regarding the\nSB dimension (see Table 3). In addition, the effect of the\ninteraction between gender and age was also verified and\nit resulted as not significant in all of the emerged\ndimensions.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis study aimed to reach the validation of the PHBS, an\ninstrument for the assessment of the range of illusory\nbeliefs about health, through a series of 31 items.\nThe results, in their entirety, substantially attest the good-\nness of the psychometric properties of the scale. The results\nof the confirmatory factor analyses of first and second order,\nas well as Cronbach's alpha scores of the scale and the sub-\ndimensions, may be considered to be very satisfactory, and\nlikewise for the validity of content, construct, and criterion,\nconsidering the correlations with the external HLC and the\nabsence of correlations with the self-efficacy perceptions.\nTable 1.

In particular, a low tendency to rely on SB and\nsupernatural forces emerged, while, in line with previous\nstudies (Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012; Tobacyk and\nMilford, 1983), RB, as seen, reach the highest average\nscore.\nFigure 1.

With respect to differences by gender, the\nobtained results belied the idea that women have a more\nirrational approach than men or that they would make more\npredominant recourse to intuitive rather than analytical\nthinking than men (Aarnio and Lindeman, 2005); with ref-\nerence to health, in fact, gender differences slightly emerge\nwith a higher tendency for women to trust in religion and\nfor men to trust more in medicine as a science and having\nan acritical tendency to take a biomedical approach with\nrespect to the protection of the human species. This result is\nin line with the comparisons according to gender about illu-\nTobacyk and Milford, 1983), which show significant differ-\nences only in specific dimensions, thus dispelling the com-\nmon conception that women have a higher propensity to\nbelieve in the paranormal. A study about the relationship\nbetween beliefs in paranormal phenomena, alternative\nmedicine, and magical beliefs about food and health, which\ninvolved a wide Finnish population with an age ranging\nfrom 15 to 60years, demonstrated the null predictive power\nof the gender variable with respect to recourse to alterna-\ntive medicine (Saher and Lindeman, 2005).\nAs regards the age differences, it has been confirmed\nthat the traditional RB are stronger in elderly people than in\nyoung adults (Irwin, 1993). Moreover, referring to SB, the\nresults--in partial contrast with the findings of the litera-\nthere is a higher tendency to hold on to illusory beliefs\namong the elderly, in line with the social marginality\nhypothesis (Emmons and Sobal, 1981). Youthfulness is\nhighly valued in our society, and the older people constitute\na socially marginal group. Under the social marginality\nhypothesis, elderly people should be relatively oriented to\nparanormal belief (Irwin, 1993). Moreover, this study is not\ndirectly comparable to those available in the literature since\nit considers four age groups at the same time.\nFinally, considering the range of beliefs included in this\ninstrument, which comprises five sub-dimensions (Beliefs:\nReligious, Superstitious, in Extraordinary Events,\nParapsychological, and Pseudo-scientific of a biomedical\nnature), it can be definitely stated that the PHBS is a rela-\ntively agile instrument that can be utilized in a simple way.\nNotwithstanding the limits of the study--attributed to the\nrelatively small number of participants, the cross-sectional\ncharacteristics, the limited territorial origin of the partici-\npants, and self-report data--the results highlight the instru-\nment's potential in evaluating illusory beliefs related to\nhealth. The PHBS can find optimal applications in empiri-\ncal studies of the factors that influence the adoption of\nhealthy behaviors, the adherence to medical therapy, the\nTable 2.
