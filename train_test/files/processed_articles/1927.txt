However, the authors' analysis\nhighlights the contribution of subjective perceptions of social ties, the quality of marriage in\nlater life for those engaged in marital or cohabitating relationships,and the quality of familial\nties for the nonmarried older adults. In a married\u00adcohabitating subsample, the subjective\nperceptions of one's relationship with the partner explained, by itself, 7% of the variance in\nloneliness, whereas the quality of family ties explained an additional 6% of the variance in\nloneliness in the nonmarried sample.Based on the present findings,practical implications for\nsocial workers are discussed.\nKey words: later life; loneliness; social networks; subjective perceptions\nIn research, multiple definitions of loneliness\nhave been proposed. Yet almost uniformly, a\ndistinction has been made between loneliness\nand aloneness (Andersson, 1998). Loneliness is ap-\nproached as a discrete,subjective construct associated\nwith the objective social situation but not synony-\nmous with the actual circumstances.Thus, people\ncan feel lonely in the company of many others or be\nalone without feeling lonely.It also has been agreed\nthat loneliness is a painful or unpleasant experience\nCognitive theory,which is a major theoretical ap-\nproach guiding loneliness research,focuses on one's\nperception and evaluation of social ties. Loneliness,\naccording to this theoretical point of view, results\nfrom the perceived discrepancy between desired\nand actual social relationships or the subjective gap\nbetween one's optimal levels of social relationships\nand achieved levels of same.A perceived deficit in\none's social interactions is crucial in creating a sense\nof loneliness. Past experience and experience of\nother people in the social environment shape this\nevaluation process. Contrary to other important\ntheoretical views of loneliness, such as the social\ncognitive theory suggests an indirect relation be-\ntween objective deficits in one's social network\nand feelings of loneliness. Cognitive processes of\nperception and evaluation serve as mediators (de\nIn recent years, interest in aging and loneliness\nhas grown for two primary reasons.First,loneliness\nis a socially prevalent phenomenon among elderly\npeople. For example, in a representative sample of\nBritish community-dwelling older people, almost\n40% experienced loneliness to some degree (Vic-\ntor, Scambler, Bowling, & Bond, 2005). Similar\nprevalence rates were recently found in Finland\namong a random sample of people age 75 and over\n(Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitk\u00e4l\u00e4,\nthat approximately 17% of people age 50 and above\nreported loneliness.\nSecond, loneliness can have deleterious effects\nin multiple domains of elders' lives, including both\nphysical and mental health. In the Chicago Health,\nAging, and Social Relations Study, loneliness was\nassociated with elevated systolic blood pressure,even\nafter controlling for demographics,health behaviors,\nand various psychosocial factors. Moreover, loneli-\nness was a unique predictor of age-related increases\nin systolic blood pressure (Hawkley, Masi, Berry, &\nCacioppo,2006).Loneliness was also found to affect\ncardiovascular activity in everyday life by predicting\nhigher basal total peripheral resistance and lower\ncardiac output (Hawkley, Burleson, Berntson, &\nCacioppo,2003).Moreover,loneliness has predicted\nmortality in elderly people in a longitudinal study\nAlong with effects on physical health, loneliness\nis associated with poor mental health.In both cross-\nsectional and longitudinal studies,greater loneliness\nwas associated with higher levels of depression.\nMoreover, loneliness remained a risk factor for de-\npression after central demographic and psychosocial\nfactors were taken into account (Cacioppo,Hughes,\nWaite,Hawkley,&Thisted,2006).Loneliness was also\nfound to be negatively associated with emotional\nwell-being (Lee & Ishii-Kuntz,1987) and positively\nassociated with serious thoughts of suicide and\nAccording to the cognitive model for concep-\ntualizing loneliness,suggested by de Jong Gierveld\n(1987), two domains of the social network form\nthe most likely determinants of loneliness among\nolder adults. The first, termed \"the descriptive\ncharacteristics of the social network,\" represents\nthe objective aspect of social contacts, as mea-\nsured by network size and frequency of contact.\nHowever, study of objective determinants yields\ninconsistent results as to their contribution to the\nprediction of loneliness in later life. In a recent\nstudy, levels of contact with family or friends and\nalso proximity and number of family or friends did\nnot demonstrate statistically significant association\nwith self-reported loneliness (Victor et al., 2005).\nHowever, among 20-year survivors of the Bangor\nLongitudinal Study on Ageing, married status\nand children living nearby were protective factors\nagainst loneliness (Wenger & Burholt,2004).Also,\na study of 1,071 participants in the Senior Citizens\nNutrition andActivities Program in Florida found\nthat subjects with no children and no friends were\nlonelier than their counterparts with children\nand friends (Mullins & Elston, 1996).The latter is\nconsistent with a Swedish study of elderly people\nage 75 and over, which demonstrated that 50% of\nthose who reported no friends experienced lone-\nliness (Holmen, Ericsson, Andersson, & Winblad,\n1992). However, marital status had no impact on\nThe second domain emphasizes the quality of\nsocial ties, as measured by perceived availability of\nsupport and satisfaction with interpersonal relation-\nships, and is termed the \"subjective evaluations of\nthe social network.\" Although both the objective\nand subjective network aspects were included in\nde Jong Gierveld's framework,she underscored the\nimportance of the latter one,which is argued to be\nmore closely linked to loneliness than the objec-\ntive domain.Many other scholars have emphasized\nthe importance of subjective assessments of social\ninteractions over objective social circumstances\nin predicting well-being outcomes (for example,\nticularly for loneliness (Cutrona, 1982; Peplau &\nNevertheless, studies most frequently use objec-\ntive measures of social networks as determinates of\nloneliness;the subjective domain is less often tested\n(Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen, 2001). Several recent stud-\nies that incorporated subjective assessments of the\nnetwork--measured by perceived social support--\nfound statistically significant inverse associations\nwith loneliness (Kahn, Hessling, & Russell, 2003;\never, these studies' findings are not generalizable\nbecause of their select samples.For example,Kahn et\na senior community center,whereasTiikkainen and\nof central Finland at age 80.\nMoreover, the literature suggests that social ties\nare not always beneficent and supportive, but can\nalso be hurtful (Rook & Pietromonaco,1987).Be-\nneficent and negativity characteristics can co-occur\nin the same relationships (Ruehlman & Wolchik,\n1988).Thus, there is a serious need to explore the\npositive and negative aspects of social interactions.\nThis arena was explored previously in relation to\ndepressed mood (Schuster,Kessler,&Aseltine,1990),\nlife satisfaction, and positive and negative mood\n(Walen & Lachman, 2000), but not in regard to\nloneliness in later life.\nIn sum,there seems to be no prevailing consensus\nabout the contribution of the objective domain of\nsocial relationships in relation to loneliness.There\nis also insufficient knowledge concerning the con-\ntribution of subjective quality of the same ties.The\ncurrent study, using contemporary data from the\n \nrecently implemented National Social Life,Health,\nand Aging Project (NSHAP), contributes to lone-\nliness research in two ways. It explored both the\nobjective and the subjective characteristics of older\nadults' social networks.The latter aspect was tested\nin a comprehensive manner (perceived support and\nstrain) while using a large, generalizable sample.\nThis latter aspect is particularly important, because\nmuch of loneliness research has been criticized as\nstemming from locally based samples, thus limiting\nthe generalization of the various findings (Victor\nMethod\nThe current study used data from the first wave of\nNSHAP that is focused on older adult interper-\nsonal connections,including marriage,family,social\nrelationships, and sexuality as well as the health of\nolder adults.The general aims of NSHAP wave 1\nwere to describe the health of older adults;evaluate\nthe relationship between older adult interpersonal\nconnections and health;examine the importance of\ngender,culture,and economic context for older adult\nhealth and social connectedness;identify the biologi-\ncal pathways through which social connectedness\naffects various aspects of health;and describe health\nbehaviors and health care use among older adults,\nincluding their perceptions of patient\u00adphysician\ncommunication.\nNSHAP is a nationally representative probability\nsample of noninstitutionalized people ages 57 to 85\nyears, selected from households across the United\nStates. NSHAP is a multistage, stratified area prob-\nability sample.The sample for NSHAP was gener-\nated using the same field operation that was used\nfor the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS).The HRS is a nationally representa-\ntive sample of individuals 50 years and older living\nin the United States that is sponsored by the Na-\ntional Institute on Aging and is conducted by the\nUniversity of Michigan. Participants take part in\na biennial interview that covers a range of topics,\nincluding income, wealth, work, retirement, family\nsupport systems,health,and health care use (http://\nhrsonline.isr.umich.edu/).\nThrough an innovative collaboration between\nNSHAP and HRS, the screening for both surveys\nwas carried out as a single operation.The sample\ndesigns for NSHAP and HRS were thus identi-\ncal at the area stages, in which geographic areas\nwere selected into the sample with probabilities\nproportional to their sizes. Two additional sam-\npling stages were (1) a household selection stage\nin which households were selected for screening\nand (2) an individual selection stage in which one\neligible person in each household was selected for\nthe NSHAP interview.The 2004 HRS new cohort\nrequired adults ages 50 to 56.To avoid overlap with\nthe HRS sample, the age range of 57 to 85 years\nwas selected for the NSHAP investigation.African\nAmericans, Latinos, men, and the older age group\nwere oversampled to provide adequate representa-\ntion of these subgroups (for a detailed description of\nthe sample design, see O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman,\nTwo-hour in-home interviews were conducted\nin English and Spanish by professional interviewers\nusing a computer-assisted personal interview.The\ninterviewer training included the completion of a\nhome study packet, a four-day in-person training,\nand booster trainings, which were held by phone\nduring data collection to provide help with field\nefficiency and gain cooperation (Smith et al.,\n2009). Data collection was executed between July\nsample response rate was 75.5%.Data collection also\nincluded a brief \"leave behind\" self-administrated\nquestionnaire.This questionnaire was given to the\nrespondents at the end of the in-person interview\nto fill out and mail back.The response rate for the\npostinterview questionnaire was approximately 84%.\n(For detailed information on NSHAP methodol-\nogy, see O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009, and Smith\nStudy Variables\nLoneliness. NSHAP used a shortened version of\none of the most widespread scales of loneliness:\nthe Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA)\n(Russell,Peplau,& Cutrona,1980).For use in large\nsurveys, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, and Cacioppo\nthree questions with a simplified set of response\ncategories. Respondents were asked to rate, on a\nthree-point scale (ranging from hardly ever to of-\nten), how often they felt a lack of companionship,\nleft out, or isolated from others. Responses to each\nquestion are summed,with higher scores indicating\ngreater loneliness.In the NSHAP sample,this scale\nachieved good internal reliability,with a Cronbach's\nSocial Network Characteristics. Objective net\nwork characteristics: For the purposes of this\nanalysis, current marital status was measured using\ntwo categories: married or cohabiting and other.\nRespondents also reported the number of living\nchildren and grandchildren they have. In addi-\ntion, respondents reported the number of relatives\nand friends they have on a six-point ordinal scale\nranging from none to more than 20. Frequency of\nsocial contact with neighbors was measured on a\nfive-point ordinal scale ranging from hardly ever\nto daily or almost every day, whereas frequency of\ncontact with friends and relatives was measured on\na seven-point scale ranging from never to several\ntimes a week.\nSubjective characteristics of the social network:\nThe subjective characteristics (positive and nega-\ntive) were operationalized through four indicators\ntaken from the 2002 HRS that were originally\ndeveloped for the MacArthur Midlife in the United\nStates survey (MIDUS) to evaluate perceived social\nsupport and perceived strain (Honda & Jacobson,\nthree loops in reference to the respondent's partner,\nfriends,and family.Included were two indicators of\nperceived support: (1) \"How often can you open\nup to your (husband/wife/partner) if you need to\ntalk about your worries:Would you say hardly ever,\nsome of the time,or often?\"(2)\"How often can you\nrely on (him/her) for help if you have a problem?\"\n(with the same response scale). The two indicators\nof perceived strain were as follows: (1) \"How often\ndoes your (husband/wife/partner) make too many\ndemands on you?Would you say hardly ever, some\nof the time,or often?\"(2)\"How often does (he/she)\ncriticize you?\" (with the same response scale). In\naccordance with other studies using these indicators,\nwe summed the two perceived support indicators\nand the two strain measures separately for spouse,\nrelatives,and friends.In NSHAP,as in MIDUS,factor\nanalysis supported this solution (Walen & Lachman,\n2000).For the three types of relationships,two fac-\ntors (perceived support and perceived strain) were\nextracted on the basis of two eigenvalues greater\nthan 1 while using principal component analysis\nwithVarimax rotation.\nCovariates\nHealth status was measured using a self-reported\nquestion:\"Would you say your health is excellent,\nvery good, good, fair or poor?\" Responses to this\nitem ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indi-\ncating better subjective health. We included two\nadditional measures of health: eyesight and hearing\nloss. Respondents were asked to rate their eyesight\nin the same manner that they rated their health and\nto indicate on a yes/no question whether they had\nexperienced a hearing loss.\n75 to 85), gender (men, women), education (less\nthan high school, high school, some college, bach-\nelor's degree or more),ethnicity (white,not white),\nand subjective income--were gathered through\nself-report. In the case of subjective income, the\nrespondents were asked the following:\"Compared\nwith most of the people you know personally, like\nyour friends, and work associates, would you say\nthat your household income is far below average,\nbelow average, average, above average or far above\naverage?\"\nStatistical Analysis\nBivariate correlations were used to examine the\nrelationships between individual predictors and\nloneliness.We used hierarchical linear regressions to\nexamine the associations between various measures\nof objective and subjective social network character-\nistics and the relative importance of each domain in\npredicting loneliness (using the difference in the R2s\nas an estimator). Using the entire sample, three sets\nof variables were added sequentially: (1) background\ncharacteristics,(2) objective network characteristics,\nand (3) subjective network characteristics. In this\nsample,a substantial number of respondents did not\nhave a spouse or a cohabitating partner.Therefore,\nwe ran two additional sets of regressions, among\nthe unmarried and married subsamples separately.\nIn the unmarried sample, we used the same three\nmodels as in the entire sample; to examine how\nperceptions of a partner relationship were related\nto loneliness for the married group, we executed a\nthird hierarchical regression. For this analysis, the\nfirst three models were run as indicated earlier,and a\nfourth model estimated the contribution of subjec-\ntive perceptions of the respondent's relationship to\nhis or her partner. In all three stages of analysis, we\nused weights to account for differential probabilities\nof selection and differential nonresponse.The com-\nplex sampling design used in NSHAP requires the\nuse of weights in the analyses to provide unbiased\nestimates of the population. The weight variable\nused in these analyses accounts for the probability\n \nof the household's selection for the HRS screening\noperation, including the probability of selection of\nthe areas that contain the case and the probability of\nthe household selection and the household's prob-\nability of selection for the NSHAP survey, which\naccounts for any adjustments due to subsampling of\nnonminority cases,the probability of selection of the\nhousehold for NSHAP,and the probability of selec-\ntion of the given individual within the household.\nThe weight variable also accounts for differential\nnonresponse (see O'Muircheartaigh et al.,2009,for\na detailed description of weighting procedures and\navailable weights for use in the public data).STATA\n9.0 was used for the analyses.\nResults\nBackground characteristics of the NSHAP sample\nand differences in mean loneliness scores across\ngender, marital status, ethnicity, income, education,\nand health groups are presented in Table 1. The\nloneliness scale ranges from 3 to 9,with higher scores\nreflecting greater loneliness.The mean of loneliness\n3.9,4.07),suggesting a relatively low level of expe-\nrienced loneliness. However, on the bivariate level,\nwomen,nonmarried individuals,black and Hispanic\npeople, and people with lower income levels and\nlower education reported greater loneliness. The\nbetter one's perceived health, the less loneliness\none felt. Among these relationships, being married\nor cohabiting appeared as an important protective\nfactor against loneliness.Age and hearing loss were\nnot significantly correlated to feelings of loneliness\n(not shown).\nThe bivariate relationships between objective and\nsubjective network characteristics and loneliness can\nbe found inTable 2.Each subjective subscale ranges\nfrom 2 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater\nperceived support or strain. In general, older adults\nperceived their network as more supportive than\nstrained.The direction of the relationships between\nthe subjective network characteristics and loneliness\nwere as expected. Supportiveness received from a\nspouse or partner, relatives, and friends was associ-\nated with less loneliness.Strained relationships were\nassociated with higher levels of loneliness. With\npartners,perceived support was more closely linked\nto loneliness than perceived strain. The opposite,\nhowever,was found concerning relatives and friends,\nwith the negative characteristics more dominantly\nassociated with loneliness.\nWe also tested the bivariate associations between\nobjective network characteristics and loneliness\n(see Table 2).The number of relatives, number of\nfriends, frequency of contact with neighbors and\nwith relatives,and frequency of contact with friends\nhad significant negative relationships with experi-\nHowever, we did not find a significant association\nwith number of children and grandchildren (not\nshown).\nHierarchical regressions were used to examine\nthe importance of objective and subjective social\nnetwork features in predicting loneliness,net of the\neffect of demographic characteristics (see Table 3).\nRegressions included only variables that showed\nsignificant correlations with loneliness at the bivari-\nate level. In model 1, when only the background\nexplanatory variables were entered, better income\nand subjective health (general and eyesight) were\ninversely associated with feelings of loneliness.\nMen were also less lonely than women. In model\n2,with objective network measures added,the most\npowerful protective factor was being married.The\nother background factors from model 1 remained\nsignificant,excluding gender.As expected,in model\n3,strained family relationships were positively associ-\nated with loneliness,and positive family relationships\nwere negatively associated with loneliness.Surpris-\ningly, perceived supportiveness (positive and nega-\ntive) from friends was not related to loneliness.\nTo determine the relative contributions of the\nobjective and subjective network domains in pre-\ndicting loneliness, we tested the difference in R2.\nIn model 1, 9% of the variance in loneliness was\nexplained.Adding the objective network indicators\nincreased the ratio of the explained variance to 15%,\nand the difference in R2 between the two models was\nsignificant.Significant additional improvement was\nshown when the subjective network characteristics\nwere introduced; model 3 explained 19% of the\nvariance in loneliness.The most influential predic-\ntor of loneliness in the entire sample was marital\nstatus. Being married was found to be a significant\nprotective predictor of loneliness.\nNext,among married and cohabitating adults,we\nexamined the relative importance of respondents'\nperceptions of support and strain from their spouse\nor partner. Thus, in addition to the three models\nincluded in the former analysis, this analysis tested\nthe subjective quality of the marital relationship as\nwell (seeTable 3).The influence of background char-\nacteristics remained similar in the married group to\nthat of the entire sample.In model 2,all the objective\nsocial network measures were significant predictors\nof loneliness. However, when subjective appraisals\nof family and friends were introduced, the number\nof relatives was not significant, but the rest of the\nobjective measures were still influential.As for the\nquality of the relationship with family and friends,\nperceived family strain showed a strong positive\nassociation with loneliness as in the entire sample.\nHowever, in the married/cohabitating subsample,\nsubjective family support did not show protective\neffects, whereas perceived strain from friends was\nstatistically associated with greater loneliness in\nthis group.\nThe quality of the marital tie proved to have a\nremarkable influence on experienced loneliness\n(model 4).The feeling that you can open up and\nrely on your spouse achieved the strongest negative\nassociation with loneliness. Perceived strain from a\nspouse was strongly associated with greater feel-\nings of loneliness.The importance of the quality of\nthe marital tie was also substantiated when testing\nthe differences in R-squares.Adding the subjective\nperceptions of the marital/cohabitating relation-\nship explained an additional 7% of the variance in\nloneliness.\nThe importance of the subjective characteristics\nof the network was shown again when the three-\nlevel model was tested among the nonmarried group\n(see Table 3).The strongest association was found\nbetween perceived family strain and loneliness (\n= 0.30), followed by a strong negative relationship\nbetween perceived support received from the family\nTable 1: Descriptive Characteristics of the Sample and Bivariate Analysis\n Mean ofLoneliness\nVariable %Lonelinessa  SE\nGender\nMarital status\nEthnicity\nIncomea\nEducationb\nHealtha\nEyesighta\nNotes: Reference categories are in parentheses.

As in the married sub-\nsample,here again the subjective block significantly\nexplained more variance in the outcome than the\nothers,it explained an additional 6% of the variance\nin loneliness compared with only 2% explained by\nthe objective network characteristics in this group.\nDiscussion\nThe current study aimed to examine the role of\nsocial ties in predicting loneliness among a nationally\nrepresentative sample of older people in the United\nStates. Our findings underscore the importance of\nthe objective characteristics of the social network.\nFor the entire sample as well as in the married\nsubsample, number of friends and relatives and\nfrequency of contact with social network members\nwere all inversely associated with loneliness.A strong\nnegative relationship was also found between the\nnumber of relatives and feelings of loneliness among\nthe nonmarried group.Thus,the potentially pallia-\ntive influence of objective network characteristics\non loneliness is consistent with other studies (Hol-\nTheoretical models,however,argue that the sub-\njective quality of social contact is more closely linked\nto perceived loneliness than are objective features\nment received substantial verification in our study\nin both the married/cohabiting and the nonmarried\nsubsamples. In both groups, greater explanatory\npower for the perceived characteristics was found.\nMoreover, the strongest predictors of loneliness in\nthese groups came from the subjective appraisals of\nthe social network.This is in accord with another\nstudy that found that the level of satisfaction with\nthe network is a leading determinate of loneliness,\nwhereas the size of the network has only a moderate\nThe importance of the quality of social relation-\nships is emphasized too by the fact that social ties are\nnot always beneficent and supportive (Carstensen,\n1991).The NSHAP data allowed us to explore these\ntwo facets of the subjective contacts--perceived sup-\nport and perceived strain--providing an opportunity\nto test which domain has a stronger relationship with\nloneliness. Our analysis suggests that the negative\naspect is more predictive than supportive interac-\ntions of loneliness. A strained familial relationship\nwas among the most influential predictors of lone-\nliness, especially for the nonmarried respondents.\nHowever,consistent with other studies,the objective\nmeasures of kinship (that is,number of children and\ngrandchildren) did not demonstrate a relationship\nwith loneliness (Lee & Ishii-Kuntz,1987;Zhang &\nLiu, 2007).This emphasizes the importance of the\nperceived quality of family ties rather than the size\nof the family network in predicting loneliness.\nIn addition, a notable effect of the quality of the\nmarital/cohabitating relationship was found. Hav-\ning a supportive spouse or partner to whom one\ncan open up and upon whom one can rely had the\nstrongest inverse relationship with self-reported\nloneliness,after controlling for the effects of varying\nTable 2: Objective and Subjective Network Characteristics and Loneliness\nTotal SampleLoneliness\nVariable  SE  SE\nObjective indicators\nSubjective indicators\nNotes: Estimates are weighted to account for differential probabilities of selection, differential nonresponse and to account for survey sampling design through incorporation of\nsampling strata and clusters.

Also, strained\nmarital bond demonstrated a strong association with\ngreater loneliness.The subjective perceptions of one's\nrelationship with a married/cohabitating partner\nexplained,by itself,7% of the variance in loneliness\namong the married/cohabitating subsample.\nAmong the entire sample,the absence of a partner\nwas also found to be highly correlated with feelings\nof loneliness.This is in accord with other studies\n(Green, Richardson, Lago, & Schatten-Jones, 2001;\nJylh\u00e4, 2004) and the conceptualization suggested\nloneliness of emotional isolation and that of social\nisolation,the former deriving from the absence of a\npartner.Based on our last findings,we can conclude\nthat having a partner is a potent protective factor\nagainst loneliness. However, when an individual is\nmarried or cohabitating, loneliness is most closely\nlinked to the quality of the relationship.\nSurprisingly, we did not empirically verify the\nassociation between quality of friendship ties and\nreported loneliness.This is in contrast with other\nstudies that have underscored the importance of\nsatisfaction with friend contacts (Holmen et al.,1992;\nHolmen & Furukawa,2002).It might be that friends\nare different than family in the sense that friends are\nselected and chosen.This might imply that friends\nwho are not supportive and those who are harm-\nful do not remain as friends and, consequently, are\nnot considered when replying to the question.The\nimportance of friends in predicting loneliness is\nevident, nevertheless, when the objective measures\nof number of friends and frequency of contact with\nthem are explored.\nA limitation of the present study is that NSHAP\nused a shortened version of the R-UCLA Loneliness\nScale.This scale does not make a distinction between\nthe two common forms of loneliness--emotional\nloneliness and social loneliness--that were originally\noffered by Weiss (de Jong Gierveld & van Tilburg,\n2006). Consequently, we could not explore these\ndomains according to their strict definitional criteria.\nAnother limitation was that we could not make a\ndistinction between situational loneliness and long-\nterm,chronic loneliness (Marangoni & Ickes,1989).\nbecome available, we will be able to explore the\ndistinctions between these two types of loneliness.\nUsing panel data will also allow us to examine a\nmodel with causal relationships that is limited now\nby the cross-sectional nature of the data.\nNonetheless, our findings demonstrate an\nimportant relationship between objective social\nnetwork characteristics and feelings of loneliness in\nlater life.In particular,our investigation underscores\nthe contribution of subjective perceptions of social\nties, the quality of marriage in later life for those\nengaged in marital or cohabitating relationship,\nand the quality of familial ties for the nonmarried\nolder adults.\nThe current investigation has some practical\nimplications for professionals such as social work-\ners. In the literature, three levels of interventions\nhave been suggested to combat this painful experi-\nence of loneliness (Rook, 1984).At the individual\nlevel, several one-to-one interventions have been\ndescribed, and most of them are based on home\nvisits or telephone calls conducted by professionals\nor by peers (Cattan, White, Bond, & Learmouth,\n2005). The second level intervention--group\ninterventions--was found to be much more\nprevalent and effective (Cattan et al., 2005). One\nexample of a successful intervention at the group\nlevel is the friendship enrichment program, devel-\noped and carried out in the Netherlands among\nolder women.This program aimed at coping with\nloneliness by developing new beneficent friendships\nenvironmental level, removing obstacles to social\ncontacts was suggested. Examples include offering\nfree transportation for older people (Rook, 1984)\nand providing access to and computer skills for\nusing the Internet to facilitate virtual networking\nand encourage interpersonal dialogue, particularly\namong older adults with disabilities (Findlay,2003).\nThe current investigation highlights the importance\nof the quality of existent relationships,the quality of\nthe closest ties, the marital bond for married older\nadults,and familial relationships for the nonmarried\nolder adults. Therefore, instead of focusing solely\non the extension of the social network in terms of\nobjective characteristics,a serious professional effort\nshould be focused at improving the quality of the\nclosest relationships.The current findings also sug-\ngest that there is no one prescription for combating\nloneliness in later life.For nonmarried older adults,\ninterventions should take place at the familial arena\nas both support and strain from family members\nare associated with feelings of loneliness. Efforts\nshould be made at increasing support and reducing\nfamilial strain to cope with loneliness. However,\nfor their counterparts, the married or cohabiting\nolder adults,efforts at reducing loneliness should be\nfocused more on the couple level.\nReferences\nAndersson, L. (1998).
