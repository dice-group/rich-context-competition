This article reviews existing Japanese\nand international literature on the gender bias created by the hidden curriculum before going on to present a Japanese\ncase study of an ELT in widespread use in Japanese public junior high schools.

The\nauthor of this article applied a qualitative case study research\nmethod (Yin, 2009) to the first book of the New Crown series,\nwhich was examined for gender bias--the depiction of\nwomen in subordinate roles or engaged in stereotypical\nactivities. A previous study on Japanese English language\ntextbooks (ELTs) conducted by Otlowski (2003) emphasized\nthat \"a number of textbooks, and especially textbooks pub-\nlished in Japan fail to represent accurately the substantial\nrole women . . . play in the make up and workforce of mod-\nern societies\" (p. 7). The task of reform is very challenging,\nand differs according to national and cultural circumstances.\nThe overarching task is one that entails changing the cultural\ndefinition of masculinity to include equality with and respect\nfor females. The explicit purpose of this article is therefore to\nexplore the following question: Has subliminal gender bias\nbeen eliminated from Japanese ELTs? This case study finds\nfor a negative response to this question, and verifies earlier\nresearch on this issue in the Japanese context.\nNew Crown, first published in 2002, is currently on its\nfourth edition (2014). The focus of this article is placed upon\nthe first book (in a series of three) which provides extensive\nexamples of gender bias, and concurs with prior research on\nthis issue in the Japanese context. The New Crown series is\ndesigned for junior high school students (seventh-ninth\ngrades) who typically utilize one book for each academic\nyear. An extensive team of writers contributed to the series\npublished by the Sanseido Company Ltd. As one would\nexpect, the language level is basic. The conversations are\nshort (typically four lines), and the grammar is highly struc-\ntured for repetition. The most recent statistics made available\nby the Collaborative Reference Database of the National\nDiet Library (2008) show New Crown to comprise nearly a\nquarter of ELTs being used in Japanese public schools at that\nUnited Nations Criteria\nBased on the United Nation's Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (adopted\ntextbooks promote gender equality if they meet the follow-\ning criteria: (a) females are protagonists, (b) females and\nmales are not described according to a stereotypical sexual\n1Nagoya University of Commerce & Business, Aichi-ken, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nIan Clark, NagoyaUniversity of Commerce & Business, Nisshin Kaguyama\nEmail: clarki@nucba.ac.jp\nA Qualitative Analytic Case Study of\nSubliminal Gender Bias in Japanese ELTs\nIan Clark1\n Keywords\nESL/EFL, language teaching, language studies, gender bias, hidden curriculum, Japan, economy, Asia, economic development,\neducational administration, leadership, policy\n2 SAGE Open\ndivision of labor, (c) ways of living free of conventional\nideas of femininity and masculinity are described positively,\n(d) topics encourage students to think about sexual discrimi-\nnation and gender equality, (e) topics encourage students to\nreconsider various issues close to them from a gender per-\nspective, and (f) topics encourage students to think about\nfemale's human rights as a global issue. In the case study of\nNew Crown, it will be seen that the textbook fails to deliver\non any of the above criteria. A system of education is a prod-\nuct of collective thought, reinforcing and reflecting the social\nand cultural context of specific nations.\nPolitics and History: The Japanese\nContext\nIt is in this context of stereotyping at Japanese schools that\nSkelton (1997) asked the question \"do current conceptions of\ncurricula reflect and anticipate the challenge of living in a\nworld which is rapidly changing and becoming ever more\ncomplex?\" (p. 177). This is a question of some extreme rel-\nevance to Japan facing a very uncertain future, both socially\nand therefore economically, due to its aging population and\ndifficulty in recruiting and retaining women into a declining\nlabor pool. In response to these issues in 2013, Prime Minister\nAbe announced a surprising move away from earlier conser-\nvative policies (i.e., females should remain at home and raise\nchildren) toward a policy called \"womenomics.\" This policy\naims not only at increasing the number of women in employ-\nment but also, and more radically, at increasing the number\nof women in management roles--currently only 6.6% in\n3,873 companies (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare\nsome post-secondary education--among the most educated\nin the world--yet only 67.5% are gainfully employed, part-\ntime work included (Auslin, 2015). Even then, many are in\ntemporary employment until marriage and leave work to\nhave children as indicated by a sharp drop in the employment\nrate among women aged between 35 and 39 (Organisation\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD],\n2012). The Meiji Yasuda Institute for Life and Wellness\nfemale respondents left work after marriage or childbirth,\nonly 14.7% continued to work after marriage, and only\n13.6% returned to work when their child reached middle-\nschool age (an age deemed fit by many Japanese mothers).\nThis may be traced back through Japan's complex history\nto the notion of \"Good Wife, Wise Mother\" (Fukaya, 1988).\nThis social policy originated during the Meiji period (1868-\n1912) and became increasingly institutionalized in the early\n1920s. The emergence of the nuclear family in Japan meant\nthat by the 1920s, the modern gender division of labor that\nassigned work to men and domestic duties to women began to\nbe reflected and driven by a rapid growth in the number\nof \"practical\" middle schools for girls. The term practical\nreferred to home economics (e.g., housekeeping and sewing),\nand by 1925, the number of students enrolled in girls' middle\nschools had exceeded the number in co-educational middle\nschools, and continued to rise (National Institute of\nEducational Policy Research [NIER], 2014).\nRigid family roles and relationships have therefore been\nthe \"backbone\" of Japanese society. However, this perspec-\ntive began to change due to Japan's aging population, delayed\nmarriages, and a fallen birthrate, which has fallen below the\nlevel needed for replacement (Rebick & Takenaka, 2009). In\nresponse, provision should be made in public school ELTs\n(and more generally) for young learners to understand the\neconomic impact that female participation may have. In\n2010, a Goldman Sachs report estimated that if women in\nJapan were employed at the same rate as men (about 80%),\neconomic output would grow by up to 15%. This was cor-\nroborated by a 2014 article in The Economist that stated rais-\ning female labor participation to the level of males could add\neight million people to Japan's shrinking workforce (pre-\npotential increase in GDP by as much as 15%. It seems\nunlikely that these targets will be met unless Japan's Ministry\nof Education (MEXT) addresses Skelton's question to be\nfound at the beginning of this section.\nTheoretical Perspectives on the Hidden\nCurriculum\nThe hidden curriculum is that set of implicit messages relating to\nknowledge, values, norms of behaviour and attitudes that\nlearners experience in and through educational processes . . . and\neach learner mediates the message in her/his own way. (Skelton,\nThere are various perspectives on the hidden curriculum.\nFirst, the functionalist perspective, as seen in the founda-\ntional work of Parsons (1959), focuses on schools as vehicles\nthrough which students learn the social norms, values, and\nskills they require to function and contribute to the existing\nsociety (Giroux, 1983). This is a positive account which pos-\ntulates the need for social control to ensure social success. It\nis this macroscopic perspective that Japanese policy adheres\nto most closely, hence the reproduction of stereotypical gen-\nder roles in New Crown Book 1. Second is the liberal per-\nspective. Liberalists take a microscopic view by examining\nthe internal structures and processes of schooling as opposed\nto how schools exercise control to create and maintain the\nsocial and cultural status quo. It considers the hidden curric-\nulum to be those practices of school life that take on an\nappearance of accepted normality through their daily pro-\nduction and reproduction. Many liberal critiques of school-\ning set out to expose those unquestioned and therefore\n\"hidden\" aspects of school life such as school rules and\ncodes of discipline, learning organization (e.g., streaming\nand mixed ability), and teacher\u00adstudent relationships/inter-\nactions. They seek to make explicit the assumptions on\nwhich everyday practices come to light and describe the pro-\ncess of how these practices are created and maintained in\nclassrooms. For example, Hargreaves (1967) found that once\nstreamed into their respective ability levels, students allo-\ncated to lower streams assumed the learning identities of stu-\ndents of lower ability.\nA third perspective is the critical perspective. The key\nproblem for critical research is a critical-Marxist analysis of\nthe hidden curriculum to address how schooling functions to\nreproduce various inequalities in society (Bowles & Gintis,\n1976). It \"recognises that `official' or formal curriculum\nstatements of schools support notions to those hidden or\nunintended consequences of schooling which lead to social\ntional work from the critical perspective by feminist research-\ners that demonstrates that schools, despite assumptions to the\ncontrary, do not support outcome equity and therefore create\nsocial asymmetry. In a feminist critique of reality, the norms,\nvalues, expectations, and practices of schools reproduce\npatriarchal relations in society (McDonald, 1980; Spender &\nSpender, 1980). Furthermore, contributions by researchers\nsuch as Apple (1986) reveal the \"hidden curriculum\" of\nschooling as a middle-class, male-dominated phenomenon,\nwhich consequently leads to inequality and injustice in\nsociety.\nThe final, and most abstract perspective, is that of the\npost-structuralists. Although post-structuralism (as seen in\nthe work of Foucault) grew from structuralist perspectives,\nit rejects the use of sweeping totalizing theories--those\nideas which set-up monolithic opposing forces, for exam-\nple, Marxism versus capitalism. For post-structural philos-\nophers, social power is multifarious and multi-located.\nThus, the power behind social reproduction through the\nhidden curriculum cannot be reduced to a conspiratorial\ngroup or entity such as \"class interests,\" \"the state,\" or a\n\"patriarchy.\" Naturally then, critical theorists, of the third\nperspective stated earlier, would critique post-structuralists\nfor under-emphasizing the role of asymmetrical power rela-\ntions. Foucault (1981), however, does acknowledge the\novert and covert influence of power and knowledge over\nindividuals. Institutions, such as schools, direct power and\nknowledge to facilitate the imposition of disciplinary prac-\ntices that reduce individuals to passive recipients. Post-\nstructuralists see power as being circulated through\ndiscourse. In recent years, it has been recognized and\nemphasized that mutual and equal classroom interactions\nare at the core of learning and, depending on the learning\nenvironment (Clark, 2014), can either facilitate or frustrate\n\"good learning\" (Clark, 2011; Toussaint-Clark & Clark,\n2008). The post-structuralist view is therefore the most\nremoved from the functionalist perspective paralleled by\nJapanese policy on education because it emphasizes the\nexamination of the democratic values of equality and repre-\nsentation, and advocates for viewpoints that challenge the\nstatus quo (Clark, 2011). The unfortunate consequence is\nthat there are very few active researchers who take a post-\nstructuralist approach to curricula at Japan universities or\npolicy bureaus. A rare exception is Professor Masahiro\nArimoto of the Graduate School of Education at Tohoku\nUniversity (see Arimoto, Clark, Yamamoto, & Shinkawa,\n2015). It is worth noting that a perspective inherently con-\ntains internal differences (sub-perspectives) that overlap or\ncomplement each other to some degree. To conclude, while\ndelineating perspectives conveys central ideas, it remains\nan exercise in reductionism which oversimplifies social\nreality. The key point therefore is to not become a \"slave\"\nto any particular perspective on the hidden curriculum.\nComparative Studies\nInequity in International Contexts\nA significant body of research which focuses on ELTs has\nbeen produced by various nations around the world. For\nexample, a recent Iranian analysis found that only 18% of\nfemales were portrayed in occupational roles, whereas for\nGreek ELT, only 13.6% of women were portrayed as paid\nworkers compared with 53% of men (Deiyanni-Kouimtzi,\nwere shown to be the major element in the labor force in\nsociety, filling 79% of the occupational roles. This finding is\nparalleled by a Malaysian study (Kumarid, 2002), which\nfound males were engaged in a greater variety of occupations\nand the active participants in many outdoor activities. In con-\ntrast, females were limited to a small range of occupations\nand engaged in passive indoor activities. Similarly, in\nPakistan, a study (Mattu & Hussain, 2003) emphasized that\ntextbook publishers are \"resistant to women's rights and\nbelieve in the status quo\" (p. 91). The study noted that girls\nare portrayed as unobtrusive, while boys are curious, active,\nand ready to take the initiative.\nEven in nations with a national commitment to gender\nequity, there are no guarantees. For example, in Sweden,\nHolmqvist and Gj\u00f6rup (2006) found that most occupations\nthat were held by men and women were described without\nan occupation or with a stereotypical one. Such problems\ndo not necessarily recede with the passage of time. For\nexample, Lee (2006) analyzed ELTs in Hong Kong across a\nperiod of some 30 years, and reported that there had been\nno discernible improvement across this time. This finding\nis well supported by the bias and inequality found in the\nJapanese context.\nInequity in Japanese Contexts\nThere is a long historical background for gender inequity\nin Japanese ELTs that foregrounds the existence of a \"hid-\nden curriculum\" in the textbooks of today (Kato, 2002;\n4 SAGE Open\na presentation on a range of Japanese junior high school\nELTs (including New Crown) at which they presented vari-\nous characteristics of bias. These characteristics included\nthe empowerment of males as deciders and choosers, that\nremarks made by males had more substance, and chapter\nthemes focused on male characters. Similarly, Otlowski\n(2003) found that women were portrayed as homemakers\nand mothers, a bias reinforced by a general lack of women\nin the workplace. Women were seen to participate in and\noversee domestic duties such as laundry, shopping, and\nfood preparation. In contrast, situations outside the home\nwere the domain of male characters. Otlowski's study par-\nallels an earlier Japanese study by Sakita (1995) which\nfound that males were depicted as mountaineer, sailor,\ncolonel, priest, and carpenter. Females filled occupations\nsuch as student, maid, actress, ballet dancer, and mother.\nTopics on gender (e.g., women's movements and female\nprotagonists) were (and still are) a rare inclusion in\nJapanese textbooks, \"and only three women--Marie Curie,\nMother Teresa, and Helen Keller--appeared frequently\"\n(Kato, 2002). In a recent study of Japanese textbooks con-\nducted by Lee (2014), it was found that \"general dispari-\nties in the forms of female invisibility, male firstness and\nstereotypical images are still prevalent in the textbooks\nexamined\" (p. 1).\nOtlowski (2003) were published many years ago. These\nbackground studies indicate that the Japanese education min-\nistry's mission to propagate gender equality through educa-\ntion has not been put into practice by textbook writers and\npublishers. As Lee (2006) noted, one should not be surprised\nthat gender inequity exists even when considering that the\nfourth edition of the New Crown series was published as\nrecently as 2014. The textbook under review contains numer-\nous examples of thematic bias, specifically themes of silence,\ncompliance, subordination and the social status, occupa-\ntional roles, and activities in general of women vis-\u00e0-vis\nthose of males.\nQualitative Analysis\nThe previous section presents a number of international and\nJapanese-based studies which found that females are under-\nrepresented in ELTs. However, this was not found to be true\nin the case of New Crown Book 1. There are 315 illustrations\nof males and 303 of females (3.9% more males). However, it\nis worth noting that some pages do feature males only, while\nthis is never the case for females. For example, there are 11\nfemales. The closest corresponding page is page 81 where\nonly two of the 12 images are of males. In general, it is not\nthe quantity of males and females that creates bias; it is the\nqualitative aspects of their lives as they enact their respective\nsocial worlds in words and pictures. They are seen to engage\nin differing activities, which present them in ways suggest-\ning biased social categorizations.\nThe Front Cover\n\"Male firstness\" (Lee, 2014) begins on the front cover. The\ncover presents an illustration of a boy and girl in a country-\nside setting. The male is the dominant figure, large, and in\nthe foreground. He is dynamic and active, riding his bicycle\nat high speed as indicated by his hair flying behind him. He\nis waving his hat in the air. We may also imagine that the boy\nis shouting to his female friend who stands in the distance as\na shadowy and silent figure. His female counterpart is stand-\ning still, and there is no suggestion of movement or speech.\nShe is waiting for him in the shade, a distant, passive,\nand obscure figure. The cover may be found at http://www.\nWhile the first book of the series is the focus of this case\nstudy, the front cover of New Crown Book 2 exhibits similar\nfavoritism toward males. In that case, a boy and girl are in a\nhot air balloon soaring over the countryside. The boy is\nempowered by the possession of a telescope so that he may\nsee further and with greater clarity.\nSport and Leisure\nSports can be used to present males and females differently.\nFor example, an illustration of an aggressive looking male\nbaseball player with his bat raised is paired with one of a girl\nin her school uniform smiling benignly. In basketball, there\nis a sense of non-stop action and the potential for bodily con-\ntact. Baseball uses a hard bat and requires the players to hit\nhard and slide aggressively. Tennis, on the contrary, is per-\nceived as a relatively gentle game more suitable for less\npowerful females. Consequently, basketball and baseball are\nrepresented in the textbook as almost exclusively male activ-\nities. There are 12 illustrations of males playing baseball and\n12 for basketball, whereas there is only one female baseball\nplayer and two female basketball players. For tennis, there\nare 15 female images and only three male tennis players.\nThere is a chapter themed around wheelchair basketball, a\nchoice of sport that suggests an overtly male theme. However,\nthe writers/publishers do appear to have made some effort to\nredress the male versus female inequality in terms of relative\nquantity. Page 82 features 12 illustrations, of which 10 are of\nfemales. Yet, even in a chapter devoted to basketball, none of\nthe images on this page portray females as basketball play-\ners. While girls are never illustrated as basketball players,\nthere is a photograph of four female players on the final page\nof the chapter; however, this is counterbalanced by four illus-\ntrations of males on the same page, one of which is a game\nofficial.\nEmployment and Social Activities\nThe social and economic supremacy of males is clearly evi-\ngirls. So, while the overall number of appearances in the text-\nbook is quite balanced, there is a very clear imbalance on\nthese pages devoted to occupations and activities. The pages\nfeature males engaged in adventurous, superior, or \"cool\"\nroles: astronaut, doctor, administrator, vet, father, and pop\nsinger. Males are also depicted as engaged in various activi-\nties that reinforce positive aspects of maleness: (a) opening a\nbox in a way that suggests curiosity and risk-taking, (b) play-\ning with a yo-yo skillfully and dynamically, (c) eating lunch\nwith a large confident grin, (d) a boy with his mouth wide\nopen in an exaggerated manner suggesting great confidence,\nand (e) one of the main male characters writing his name on\nthe classroom board, a further indication of the academic\nhierarchy in schools. In contrast, of the five girls, none are\nshown to be economically productive. Instead, they are shown\nto be (a) looking pretty while silently drinking juice, (b) hold-\ning up a plate of food that we must assume she has prepared,\nand (c) asking a question, which can only suggest a gap in her\nknowledge. We know she is asking a question and not answer-\ning one because of the large question mark in the picture. The\ncorresponding image appears on page 121. Here, a boy has\nhis hand raised to answer a question. We understand he knows\nthe answer because the (male) teacher is pointing at him to\nelicit it from him; (d) taking direction, albeit from an older\nfemale. The fifth illustration is of a girl, simply standing there\nand doing nothing at all; the very example of passivity. There\nare two small illustrations of a woman in a laboratory coat\n(p. 54), but rather ironically, it serves to remind the reader of\nthe remarkable paucity of such images. Another female is\nshown as working at a museum. She is on reception, her sole\npurpose to receive and support others. Predictably, the uni-\nformed authority figure of the town (a police officer) is male.\nFemale Passivity\nIt has been found that girls are often depicted exhibiting\n\"healthy\" behaviors typical for girls and not boys. They are\n\"silent, compliant, gentle, helpful, neat and polite\" (Irby &\n\"the lessons of the hidden curriculum teach girls to value\nsilence and compliance, to view those qualities as a virtue\"\n(p. 244). This is reflected in the composition of the New\nCrown textbook under review here.\nMuch of what happens in the textbook occurs at an imagi-\nnary school. Several pages into the textbook (pp. 6-7), the\nreader is presented with a plan view of the town in which the\nschool is located as a double page feature. The main charac-\nters are depicted, as are other uncredited characters, all of\nwhom are engaged in various activities around the town.\nBoys are more active: running, riding bicycles, and walking\ndogs. The theme of female silence and reception is first\nencountered in this section of the textbook. A girl sits quietly\nat an ice-cream stall whereas her male companion speaks, his\nmouth wide. While there is only one instance of female\nsilence on this page, it indicates why it is necessary to avoid\na reductionist approach. Illustrations that reinforce the theme\nof silent girls listening to \"chatty\" boys recur throughout the\ntextbook. For example, on page 70, a boy speaks as a girl\nlistensandtakesnotes.ThisisconsonantwiththeFoucauldian\nperspective on \"hidden curriculum\": Boys are seen to have\nownership (power) over the text (knowledge) rather than\nsharing it. They have preferential access, holding the books\nand pointing to them while the girls stand passively at their\nside. In terms of numbers, there are precisely no instances of\nfemales taking a dominant discursive role unless they are\nperforming stereotypical domestic duties. When taken col-\nlectively (as a whole), the images (illustrations and photo-\ngraphs) and discourse reveal asymmetrical power relations.\nTwo of the girls in the town are demonstrating compliance\nas they walk across a pedestrian crossings obediently. The\ncorresponding male image is of a handicapped boy in a\nwheelchair. These forms of subliminal bias are difficult to\ndiscern unless one takes a holistic approach, but when taken\ntogether, individual images create a whole image that rein-\nforces girls for compliance and suggests that less able boys\nbehave in the same way as girls.\nThere are a number of illustrations that depict girls as pas-\nsive recipients and boys as the dominant interlocutor during\nmale\u00adfemale interactions.\nEven though the conversations in the text are very short,\nthere are clear examples of the female characters taking a sub-\nordinate or caretaker role. On page 21, a girl compliments her\nmale friend's prowess (\"You're good Ken.\") at basketball\nbefore going on to ask him \"Are you thirsty?\" This question is\nreinforced through repetition further down the page by a dif-\nferent girl.Another example of a girl in a caretaker role is to be\nfound on page 62 as she organizes the school bags of her male\nfriends. A further example of girls supporting boys occurs on\npage 102. The girl provides the boy with the information he\nrequires to make his decision on what they will do (\"I see.\nThen today let's take a bus\"), and the conversation ends.\nAconversation on page 23 opens with the girl apologizing\nto the boy without any particular reason or context for doing\nso (\"Oh, I'm sorry\"). She appears to be apologizing for being\nthere at all. This is an example of those \"healthy\" behaviors\nthat \"ideal\" (female) students should exhibit. That is, she is\nsubmissive and polite. Girls in the textbook are faced with an\nunfavorable discourse gradient in other ways:\nBoy: I have a cat.\nGirl: Really?\nBoy: The cat is white.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe girl, while responsive, is monosyllabic and receptive.\nThis is also one of two examples of male ownership on this\npage without corresponding female examples.\nThere is a subliminal gender bias toward girls for linguis-\ntic competence (Emma: \"I study Japanese before class.\" p. 74)\nand against girls for the traditional male-dominated subject\narea of math. The same character (Emma) asks a male friend\nfor help with her mathematics homework:\nEmma: Can you help me with tomorrow's math homework?\nBoth aspects conform to the widely held belief that girls\nare expected to be less capable than boys at mathematics,\nbut more linguistically able than male students. However,\nthere is no explicit suggestion that Emma is actually good\nat Japanese here, only that she gets up early to study it.\nHowever, we know that she cannot do math and that her\nmale counterpart can.\nFemales as Domestic Technicians\nThere is a general expectation that Japanese women will leave\nemployment to organize and manage the household. In the\ncase of the textbook, this is reflected in both words and pic-\ntures. On page 44, a boy and a girl are at the supermarket:\nEmma: I have a shopping bag.\nKen: Good.\nEven in this brief exchange, we see the female has orga-\nnized for one of her primary functions--shopping--and we\nsee the male reinforce her positively for that behavior. In the\nbackground of the same picture, two adult females are shop-\nping in their roles as \"good wives,\" one of which is with a\nsmall child performing her role as the \"wise mother.\" As\nstated earlier, this is a social role of traditional cultural sig-\nnificance in Japan (Fukaya, 1988). The \"healthy\" female\nroles of shopping and food preparation are reinforced in the\ntextbook. For example,\n\"How much is the blouse?\"\n\"Where is Mom?\" (capital M in the original text).\n\"She's in the kitchen.\" (p. 142)\nThere are more vignettes that depict females as domestic\nmanagers who make cookies and go shopping (p. 107).\nIn this world, the domestic and social roles and behav-\niors are clearly demarked. In a further obvious example, a\npicture of a man dressed as a chef is paired with one of a\nwoman dressed as a housewife. She is portrayed so stereo-\ntypically that she actually appears to be wearing her apron\nas her uniform (p. 124). Such images offer proof that male\ncooks are engaged in more important bread-winning roles\noutside the home while females are subordinated to the\ndomestic domain.\nEven when males are shown to be actively involved in\ndomestic work, it is the female who assumes some level of\ncontrol:\nWait. Don't wash the dishes.\nPlease use this paper. (p. 48)\nIn a different illustration (p. 104), a boy assists his mother\nin the kitchen. His mother is in control at the stove, reinforc-\ning the stereotype that she has dominion over the kitchen as\nthe \"good wife\" and over her child as the \"wise mother.\"\nConclusion\nThe findings of this case study confirm those of the earlier\nJapanese and international studies introduced in the litera-\nture review of this article. It is of course perfectly acceptable\nto depict men as adventurous, confident, knowledgeable,\nand dynamic if textbooks then include corresponding images\nand conversations that elevate females to an equal status,\nand promote their learning identities beyond that of compli-\nant caretaker. Unfortunately, the corresponding female\nvignettes are either absent or, where present, operate to\nexaggerate bias. There are very few positive accounts of\nboys taking some measure of domestic responsibility pre-\nsented as singular instances of dishwashing and room clean-\ning. There is also one illustration of a girl taking out the\nrubbish. It is a rather ambiguous image as it may be seen as\na foray into those duties typically performed by males, or as\nanother domestic duty which females should take care to\nperform. There are other such examples; however, they are\nnotably infrequent instances that provide only cosmetic\nattention to gender equality.\nDespite the important role for working women, this case\nstudy revealed a \"hidden curriculum\" that communicates\novert and subliminal gender bias, missing the opportunity to\nprepare young learners for a more economically viable future\nfounded on equitable social and economic participation.\nWhen analyzed holistically, bias accumulates to form a per-\nvasive counterproductive theme of social and economic\ninequality between females and males. In this particular case\nstudy, which concurs with prior research on ELTs and gender\nbias, it is apparent that despite MEXT's stated intention of\nequality through education, Japanese ELT writers and pub-\nlishers have fallen short of the United Nations criteria for\ngender equity, and those of the industrialized global commu-\nnity. What changes can be made to construct a learning\nenvironment that ensures outcome equity, and employment\nopportunity based on ability rather than gender? First, teach-\ners need to be made aware of their tendencies toward gender\nbias. Next, they need to be provided with in-service pro-\ngrams which help them acquire strategies that combat ineq-\nuitable teaching styles. Finally, and as this article highlights,\nefforts need to be made to remove gender bias from educa-\ntional materials. Teachers need to be aware of the gender bias\nembedded in educational materials and texts and need to take\nsteps to combat this bias. An innovative approach is to plan\nclasses that use biased texts to help students identify the gen-\nder bias inside them, and facilitate critical discussions about\nwhy that bias exists. Bailey (1992) identified six attributes\nthat need to be considered when delivering a gender-equita-\nble curriculum: classroom materials need to be (a) inclusive,\n(b) accurate, (c) affirmative, (d) representative, (e) inte-\ngrated, and (f) weave together the experiences, needs, and\ninterests of both males and females. McCormick (1995)\nechoed the findings of this analytic case study by emphasiz-\ning that\nwe need to look at the stories we are telling our students and\nchildren. Far too many of our classroom examples, storybooks,\nand texts describe a world in which boys and men are bright,\ncurious, brave, inventive, and powerful, but girls and women are\nsilent, passive, and invisible.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nApple, M.
