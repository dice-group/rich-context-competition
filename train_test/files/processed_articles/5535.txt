Our goal was to characterize the renal renin-angiotensin system in transgenic mice that express\nrat tonin (TGM`(rTon)).\nMaterials and methods: Mice were euthanized and the kidneys removed for analysis. Tonin activity was evaluated\nby radioimmunoassay and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by HPLC. Tonin, ACE and angiotensin II-\nconverting enzyme (ACE2) expression was analyzed by Western blotting.\nResults: Tonin activity was significantly increased in TGM`(rTon) compared to their respective wild-type (WT) littermates\n(1.7 \u00b1 0.21 vs 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 nmol of Ang II/min/mg of protein). Tonin activity had a strong positive correlation with tonin\nexpression in both TGM`(rTon) and their respective wild-type littermates. The ACE activity and expression levels of 65-\nkDa N-domain angiotensin I-converting enzyme isoform were significantly increased in the TGM`(rTon) when compared\nwith WT. ACE2 expression levels were statistically significantly higher in the TGM`(rTon) when compared with WT.\nAngiotensin 1\u00ad7 (Ang(1\u00ad7)) and Ang I levels were significantly lower in the TGM`(rTon).\nConclusions: We suggest that the environment of tonin abundance may increase N-domain ACE activity liberated by\na secretase able to cleave somatic ACE.\n",

It has been pos-\ntulated that chymase, cathepsin G and tonin are part of\nalternative enzymatic pathways for Ang II production.12\u00ad14\nTonin (rat kallikrein 2, rKLK2) is a serine proteinase\npresent in several rat tissues, such as the brain, kidney,\nprostate, and mainly in the submandibular gland.15\u00ad20 Tonin\nreleases Ang II from peptides presenting the sequence cor-\nresponding to the N-terminal portion of AG like Ang I and\nstrate. There is evidence that tonin plays a role in blood\npressure control23 and participates in the local hydromin-\neral balance in several sites.24 Intracerebroventricular injec-\ntion of tonin induces salt appetite and water intake and\nincreases urinary volume and blood pressure.16\nTonin was described as an Ang II-releasing enzyme,\ntherefore, since its discovery, tonin has been studied in\norder to verify its participation in the pathophysiology of\nhypertension. Some studies have shown that tonin may be\ninvolved in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension.\nInitial studies show that: (a) the activity levels of tonin in\nthe plasma are increased in humans with essential and ren-\novascular hypertension; (b) infusion of tonin intravenously\nin mice does not alter blood pressure; however, in indo-\nmethacin salt-treated rats a marked increase in arterial\nblood pressure was observed under tonin infusion; (c) a\nsingle intravenous administration of rabbit antiserum tonin\ninto one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rats restored blood\npressure to normal in seven out of 10 animals. The authors\nsuggest that tonin is important in the maintenance of high\nblood pressure. However, other factors, possibly prosta-\nglandins and sodium, have to be modified in order to acti-\nvate the tonin-Ang II system.25\nCardiovascular and electrocardiographic parameters\nafter tonin administration were recently evaluated in\nWistar rats. The authors observed that tonin is able to gen-\nerate Ang II in the isolated heart, and the cardiovascular\nresponse induced by tonin was completely blocked by can-\ndesartan, an indication that the action of Ang II on the AT1\nreceptor is the major mechanism of the heart effects.26\nIn order to clarify the importance of tonin for the car-\ntransgenic mice that express rat tonin, the TGM(rTon).\nThese mice present high levels of tonin messenger RNA\n(mRNA) and activity specifically in the brain. As a conse-\nquence, TGM(rTon) develop increased blood pressure and\nwater intake. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is less hypoten-\nsive for TGM(rTon) than for control animals. The AT1\nreceptor antagonist candesartan equally lowers blood pres-\nsure in transgenic and in control mice. Plasma Ang II is\nincreased in TGM(rTon) as compared to the wild type. AT1\nreceptors are desensitized in this transgenic model.\nCardoso and collaborators concluded that tonin in the\nbrain may represent an alternative pathway to generate\nAng II with effects on the cardiovascular system.27\nRecently, our group generated a second lineage of\ntransgenic mice (TGM`(rTon)) that also express rat tonin\nin many tissues of cardiovascular importance. More\nrecently, our group demonstrated for the first time that the\nsystemic antinociceptive effects in the TGM`(rTon) are\nblocked, at least in part, by losartan and A-779, suggesting\nthat Ang II produced in these transgenic mice may be\ninvolved with antinociception via the AT1\nreceptor, while\nAng(1\u00ad7) induces its effects via the Mas receptor.28 The\naim of the study was to characterize the RAS in the kidney\nof transgenic mice overexpressing rat tonin.\nMaterial and methods\nProduction of TGM`(rTon)\nTransgenic TGM`(rTon) mice were obtained by microin-\njection of the transgene into zygotes as described by\nsubmandibular gland of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using\nTrizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's proto-\ncol.AfterreversetranscriptionwithM-MULV(Invitrogen),\ntonin cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) in the presence of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and\nspecific primers (59-ACC TGA TAC CAT GTG GCT\nThe product was cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega,\nMadison, WI, USA) and sequenced using an automated\nDNA sequencer. The rat tonin cDNA (0.83 kb) was sub-\ncloned into the pBluescript II SKq vector (Stratagene, La\nJolla, CA, USA) downstream of a 2.2-kb fragment con-\ntaining the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)\ngene promoter, previously removed from the plasmid\npCAT-2 using KpnI and XbaI. A 0.6-kb fragment contain-\ning the SV40 polyadenylation site was excised from the\nplasmid pDLux with XbaI and cloned downstream of the\nrat tonin cDNA. All cloning junctions were confirmed by\nsequencing with specific internal primers (59-CAG CCG\nGGA GGT GC-39). The transgene was cleaved from the\nconstruct using ScaI, BglII and NdeI, and transgenic ani-\nmals were generated by the pronuclear microinjection\nmethod.29 C57BL/6 mice were used as zygote donors. The\npresence of the transgene in mouse genomic DNA was\nverified by PCR using primers that anneal to exon 3 (59-\nCCT CCT TCC ATC TCT CCT GC-39) of the tonin gene.\nHomozygous transgenic mice TGM'(rTon) were gener-\nated and maintained by breeding. Transgene expression\ndriven by the human GFAP promoter was not limited to\nthe brain of TGM`(rTon) animals (Table 1).\nAnimal protocols\nStudies were performed using tissues obtained from adult\nblack six) and TGM`(rTon). Animals were maintained on\na normal diet, with free access to tap water with a 12:12-\nhour light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.\nAnimals were euthanized by decapitation and kidneys\nwere immediately removed and stored at -80\u00b0C until\nexperiment procedures.

A transverse section (5 mm) was\ncollected every 0.8 mm and six to eight sections were\nobtained from each kidney. Sections were stained using\nhematoxylin and eosin and digitalized. We observed 30\nglomeruli in each group. Measurements were restricted to\nglomerulus that showed in a single cut, and at least one of\nthe poles: vascular or urinary. We calculated the diameter\nof the glomerular tuft and space between Bowman's cap-\nsule and tuft (external area \u00ad internal area of the Bowman's\ncapsule).

But, no\nalteration on Bowman's capsule space was detected\nWT, respectively).\nDiscussion\nGiven the lack of information regarding tonin in RAS, the\npresent work investigated the role of tonin in renal RAS in\nanimals TGM`(rTon). We observed in summary an increase\nof tonin, renin and ACE activities, a reduction of Ang(1\u00ad7)\nand Ang I with an increase in Ang II levels in the kidney of\nTGM`(rTon) when compared to control animals.\nIn this model renal renin activity was increased, but\nCardoso and colleagues (2010) described that systemic lev-\nels of renin in TGM(rTon) are not statistically different.27\nThe focus of our work was to study RAS in the kidney.\nThe early controversy on the novel concept of tissue RAS\nhas been based on the question of local synthesis vs uptake\nfrom the circulation.8 Thus, it has been difficult to deline-\nate the quantitative contributions of systemically delivered\nvs locally formed Ang peptides.34 These potential auto-\ncrine-paracrine systems may be important in the regulation\nof local tissue functions in addition to the circulating endo-\ncrine system.35 An independent function of local RAS (for\nexample, in the brain where the RAS components are also\nexpressed in regions inside the blood-brain barrier) has\nbeen postulated.8\nEvidence suggests that local formation is of major sig-\nnificance in the regulation ofAng levels in many organs and\ntissues. It is necessary to understand the mechanisms\nresponsible for independent regulation of the intrarenal\nRAS vs circulatory RAS of the development and mainte-\nnance of hypertension and renal injury.34 Local synthesis of\nrenin may be limited to very small amounts, but uptake of\nrenin from the circulation is very likely.36 Our results in the\nkidney taken together with the observation made by Cardoso\net al. (2010)27 suggest the existence of a possible dissocia-\ntion of circulating and renal RAS in this animal model.\nThese transgenic animals produced an environment\nwith significantly increased levels of Ang II.

Recent studies reveal that\nAng II is a potent inducer of TGF-beta synthesis in a vari-\nety of cells and that this mechanism exerts important bio-\nlogical effects including extracellular matrix accumulation,\ncell proliferation, and hypertrophya.37 Histomorphometric\nanalysis revealed a decrease in the glomerular tuft diame-\nter, without changes in space of Bowman's capsule of\nTGM`(rTon). These changes may be related to increased\nAng II and TGF-beta effects, which contribute to the for-\nmation of renal fibrosis.37\nThe decreased levels of Ang(1\u00ad7) in TGM`(rTon) can\nbe attributed to modulation of the N-domain ACE isoform\nin these animals whose activity and expression are\nincreased. N-domain ACE cleaves Ang(1-7), considered a\nspecific substrate for the N-domain ACE active site of the\nsomatic, as well as for the soluble (65 kDa) N-domain\nhydrolysis of Ang(1\u00ad7) by ACE to form Ang(1\u00ad5) appears\nto be an important pathway for inactivation of this pep-\ntide.40,41 Possibly, alternatives pathways have contributed\nto the low levels of Ang(1\u00ad7), mainly through the action of\nN-domain ACE on this peptide in the kidney. Ang(1\u00ad7) is\na specific substrate for N-domain ACE, which is found in\nthe mesangial, proximal and collecting duct cells.42 Despite\nthe increase of ACE2 activity, possibly the N-domain ACE\nactivation found in TGM'(rTon) is responsible for the pep-\ntide degradation. Further studies are necessary to under-\nstand the modulation of these enzymes.\nThe expression of ACE2 is increased in young diabetic\nrats and has a renoprotective role by increasing the intrare-\nfluid absorption, induces diuresis, natriuresis, inhibits\nNa+-K+ATPase, and enhances the vasodilator effect of\nbradykinin (BK).44\u00ad46 In our model, the decrease ofAng(1\u00ad\n7) may not facilitate the vasodilator effects of Ang(1\u00ad7)\nand cause renal damage, but we did not detect morphologi-\ncal alterations in the kidney in histological analysis.\nAng I levels in renal tissue of TGM'(rTon) were statisti-\ncally lower than in control animals, although renin activity\nwas higher in this group. Ang I is also a substrate for ACE2,\na carboxypeptidase enzyme and homologue of ACE,\nexpressed predominantly in the kidney, heart and blood ves-\nsels, that produces Ang(1\u00ad9). We did not measure the ACE2\nactivity in the kidney; however, its protein expression is sig-\nnificantly increased, indicating that it may be involved in\nAng I degradation. ACE2 has a high affinity for Ang II to\nin the kidney of C and T. (b) Signal ratio for ACE/-actin\nexpressed as relative scan units. Data are presented as mean \u00b1\nvs 65 kDa WT.

As described in\ntribute to the low levels ofAng I. The low levels ofAng I can\nalso be explained by the activation of other enzymes, includ-\ning the neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which is found in tubu-\nlar and glomerular epithelial cells.49,50 This endopeptidase is\nalso an important element of the intrarenal RAS, since it\nmediates the conversion of Ang I to Ang(1\u00ad7).\nney has a remarkable capacity to degradeAng I andAng II,\nconsiderably higher than that in the pulmonary and sys-\ntemic circulation. They also concluded that the ability of\nthe kidneys to convert circulating Ang I to Ang II (21%) is\nof minor importance for endocrine generation of Ang II\nbut could be useful for the paracrine production.\nRecent studies have revealed intratubular conversion of\nAng II to Ang III by amino peptidase A.52 These data show\nthe complexity of RAS tissue, indicating that more studies\nare needed to better understand the action of this system.\nResults obtained in this study show increased activity\nof the N-domain isoform, in both groups, in renal tissue.\nThis was confirmed by the increase of the protein expres-\nsion of N-domain ACE in the transgenic group. Higher\nlevels of activity and protein expression of N-domain ACE\nobserved in renal homogenate suggested that in\nTGM`(rTon) the modulation of this isoform may occur,\nprobably through the activation of proteinases capable of\nreleasing it. Secretases, sheddases or convertases are able\nto cleave somatic ACE from the membrane-bound form,\ngenerating a soluble form of the protein that has properties\neither identical to or subtly different from those of the\nmembrane bound.53 Recently our group identified and\npurified secretases described as serine proteinases able to\nliberate N-domain ACE isoform in mesangial cells related\nespecially to hypertension.54\nWe suggest that the environment of tonin abundance\nmay increase N-domain ACE liberation in the transgenic\nmouse by a secretase described as a serine protease and\nits activity, explaining the low levels of Ang(1\u00ad7) in its\nspecific substrate.42 This environment may also activate\nother pathways or cell signaling or alter the gene expres-\nsion of different peptides or enzymes in order to main-\ntain corporal homeostasis. Taken together, our data show\nthe role of tonin as an important modulator of renal RAS.\nDespite some studies having described important phys-\niological effects of tonin, the physiological role of this\nenzyme remains unclear. We have made some progress\ntoward a more precise definition of tonin-Ang II's role as\npart of this amazing but still puzzling system of Ang\nII-generating enzymes. Most knowledge to date on tonin\ncomes from rodents and the presence of tonin in human\ntissues has not been clearly reported.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico; Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo\n2010/51); and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a Pesquisa do estado de Minas\nGerais (Pronex).\nReferences\n1.
