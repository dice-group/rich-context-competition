Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 64B(1), 137\u00ad146,\nDEVELOPMENTAL research demonstrates that author-\nitative parenting predicts many positive outcomes for\nchildren and adolescents when compared with authoritarian,\nindulgent, and uninvolved parenting (Coplan, Hastings,\nitative parenting, characterized by moderate to high levels of\ncontrol along with high levels of support, is related to greater\npsychological well-being and lower levels of depressive\nsymptoms and substance use (Maccoby & Martin, 1983).\nGiven current efforts to enhance adult well-being in later life\nand lifespan development theories that stress the influence of\nearly childhood experiences well beyond adolescence (El-\nder, 1998), the link between early remembered parenting\nbehavior and adjustment in middle and late adulthood is\nworthy of examination.Yet, little is known about the connec-\ntion between parenting styles experienced in childhood and\npsychological and behavioral outcomes in adulthood.\nThe present study advances previous work by (a) assess-\ning the association between remembered parenting styles\nand multiple indicators of mid- to later-life adjustment; (b)\nutilizing the four established parenting styles from the child\ndevelopment literature, instead of only focusing on one di-\nmension of parenting (i.e., support or control) and its con-\nnection to a single outcome; (c) examining a large\ncommunity sample of adults; and (d) identifying sex, race,\nand childhood socioeconomic status (SES) differences in\nthe link between earlier remembered parenting behavior\nand later psychological and behavioral functioning.\nLinks Between Development and Parental\nSupport and Control\nMost theories of family socialization view parenting be-\nhavior as multidimensional, involving primarily the domains\nof parental support and control (Baumrind, 1971; Maccoby &\nMartin, 1983), which are both considered critical to children's\ndevelopment. Parental support is important because it predicts\na strong sense of self-worth and security, greater psychologi-\ncal well-being, and other positive outcomes (Coplan et al.,\nchildren are likely to experience anxiety, insecurity, aggres-\nsion, hostility, low self-esteem, and inadequacy (Baumrind).\nParental control helps to shape responsible conformity\nand self-control in children. The rules and guidelines parents\nset and enforce teach children about group and societal stan-\ndards for behavior (Baumrind, 1996). Over time, children's\nexperience with rules and the consequences for breaking\nthem help them to develop independent decision-making\nskills and to internalize control of their own behavior (Baum-\nrind). Inadequate parental control, on the other hand, may\nmake it difficult for children to manage effectively in the out-\nside world where behavioral rules and standards of conduct\nRemembered Parenting Styles and Adjustment in\nMiddle and Late Adulthood\nTanja C.

Authoritative parenting is the parenting style often associated with positive outcomes for children and\nadolescents. This study considers whether remembered parenting styles in childhood predict multiple dimensions of\nfunctioning in adulthood.\nMethods. We used the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States data set (N = 2,232) to assess the\nassociation between parenting behaviors remembered from childhood--classified as authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and\nuninvolved--and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, and substance abuse, in a subsample of mid- and later-life\nadults. Differences in outcomes by sex, race, and childhood socioeconomic status were also examined across parenting styles.\nResults. Adults who remembered authoritative compared with authoritarian and uninvolved parents reported greater\npsychological well-being and fewer depressive symptoms, and those with uninvolved parents noted greater substance\nabuse. No outcome differences were found between remembered authoritative and indulgent parenting styles. A few sex\nand race interactions were identified: Authoritative parenting (compared with uninvolved) was more strongly associated\nwith men's psychological well-being than women's, and authoritative parenting (compared with authoritarian) predicted\nreduced depressive symptoms for Whites more than non-Whites.\nConclusions. There is some support that remembered parenting styles continue to be related to functioning across the\nlifespan. There is also evidence of resiliency, flexibility, and malleability in human development.\nKey Words: Depression--Life course perspective--Parenting styles--Psychological well-being--Substance abuse.\nexist in nearly all social settings (Barber & Olsen, 1997). In\ncombination, therefore, parental support and control are be-\nlieved to foster children's emotional, psychological, and be-\nhavioral well-being and development.\nBased on a cross-classification of high and low levels of\nparental support and control, child development scholars have\ndeveloped typologies of parenting styles. Consistent with the\nwork of Maccoby and Martin (1983), we distinguish among\nfour \"styles of parenting\" based on the balance between high\nand low levels of parental responsiveness (i.e., support) and\ndemandingness (i.e., control). Authoritative parents display\nhigh levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They\nare warm, nurturing, and sensitive to their child's needs and\nconsistently consider the child's age and maturity when form-\ning behavioral expectations. Authoritarian parents display\nlow responsiveness and high demandingness. They are often\ncold, unsupportive, insensitive to the child's needs, and de-\nmanding in their control. Indulgent parents use high respon-\nsiveness but low demandingness; they believe that fewer rules\nand expectations for appropriate behavior benefit children's\ndevelopment. Finally, uninvolved parents display low levels\nof both responsiveness and demandingness. They generally\nfail to connect with their child, are emotionally detached and\nwithdrawn, and have few rules and expectations. Rather than\nthe child-centered motivations that characterize indulgent\nparenting, the reasons behind uninvolved parenting tend to be\nrelated to parental psychopathology or other problems.\nDevelopmentalists have empirically validated the impor-\ntance of parenting style for numerous child and adolescent\noutcomes. (This literature is briefly summarized subse-\nquently.) Yet, despite life course theorizing that early life\nexperiences can have a protracted influence on later devel-\nopment (Elder, 1998), no attempts have been made to link\nearly parenting styles to developmental outcomes in mid-\nand later adulthood. Parental support during childhood is\nknown to predict psychological well-being, self-worth, and\npersonal control in young adults (Wickrama, Lorenz, &\nConger, 1997). Further, adults reporting positive interac-\ntions with parents during childhood are more likely to enter\ninto social relationships that are supportive, foster well-\nbeing, and contribute to better health and less depression\n(Shaw, Krause, Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton,\n2004). Hence, an empirical foundation exists for testing a\nwider array of long-term outcomes that may emerge from\ndifferent styles of early parenting.\nEvidence of the Importance of Parenting Styles\nfor Children and Adolescents\nConsistent with theoretical expectations, empirical work\nindicates that authoritative parenting is generally associated\nwith the most beneficial child and adolescent outcomes\nwhen compared with nonauthoritative parenting styles\nadolescents reared by authoritative parents compared with\nnonauthoritative parents report better developmental out-\ncomes, including greater self-esteem, self-control, moral\ndevelopment, social maturity, and school performance\n(Radziszewska, Richardson, Dent, & Flay, 1996), as well as\ngreater psychological well-being and less depression and\nDemographic Differences in Parenting Styles and Outcomes\nResearchers have raised two important questions regard-\ning variations in parenting styles as they relate to subgroup\ndifferences: First, do preferred parenting styles vary across\nracial/ethnic and social class groups and are different parent-\ning styles used with males versus females? Second, do the\neffects of various parenting styles differ across these groups?\nTo address these questions as they relate to adult develop-\nment, our study examines sex, race, and childhood SES dif-\nferences in the relationship between remembered parenting\nstyle and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms,\nand substance abuse in mid- and later-life adults.\nStudies of children and adolescents indicate that pre-\nferred parenting styles may differ somewhat based on par-\nents' race/ethnicity and SES. Authoritative parenting tends\nto be more common among Whites and authoritarian par-\nenting more typical of Blacks and Hispanics (Radziszewska\net al., 1996). Interestingly, Asian Americans are said to be\nmore permissive when children are very young but to shift\ntoward more authoritarian parenting as they reach \"the age\nSES differences may be confounded with some of the find-\nings attributed to race/ethnicity (Kelley, Power, & Wimbush,\n1992). Several studies of Black parents use low-income sam-\nples, which are generally more authoritarian than high-income\nones (Radziszewska et al., 1996). Further, many studies not-\ning a dominant pattern of authoritative parenting among\nWhites use middle-class samples, calling into question their\napplicability to more diverse samples (Bornstein & Bornstein,\n2007). Specifically, high- versus low-SES parents are more\nlikely to use warmth, stimulation, explanations, and praise\nwith their children and to focus on children's internal charac-\nteristics (e.g., autonomy). Conversely, low-SES parents gen-\nerally focus more on children's external behaviors (e.g.,\nobedience) (Hoff, Laursen, & Tardif, 2002).\nIn terms of race/ethnic variations in parenting style out-\ncomes, much research has addressed the conditions under\nwhich authoritarian parenting may be more desirable than,\nand even preferred over, authoritative parenting. A point of-\nten made is that authoritarian parenting styles used by low-\nincome minority parents living in high-risk environments\nmay actually benefit children's safety and development and\npromote school achievement (Baldwin, Baldwin, & Cole,\nfound that Black adolescent girls whose mothers used high\ncontrol reported fewer depressive symptoms than Latino\nand White girls. Thus, for some populations, authoritarian\nrather than authoritative parenting may be more advanta-\ngeous for child and adolescent outcomes.\nFindings on sex differences in child and adolescent out-\ncomes as they relate to parenting style are inconsistent; some\nstudies report interactions (Hart, Newell, & Olsen, 2002), and\nothers note that parenting styles have similar effects for both\nsexes (Finkelstein et al., 2001). When differences are noted,\npatterns are consistent with the behavior problems typical of\neach sex. Girls tend to exhibit more internal problems (e.g.,\nshyness, somatic complaints), whereas boys' problems tend\nto be displayed through external behaviors enacted against\nothers or their environment (Hart et al., 2002). Thus, less than\nideal parenting appears to exacerbate problems in the behav-\nioral domains in which each sex is already at risk.\nEarly Parenting Behavior and Outcomes in\nAdulthood\nInvestigations of parenting behavior experienced in child-\nhood and subsequent adult development are often limited to\nparental discipline and considered in association with a\nsingle negative outcome, such as personality disorders,\ndepressive symptoms, or substance abuse (Carter, Joyce,\nMulder, & Luty, 2001; Sakado, Kuwabara, Sato, Uehara,\nSakado, & Someya, 2000). For instance, adults who recalled\novercontrolling parents that used negative discipline re-\nported greater anxiety in adulthood (Gerlsma, Emmelkamp,\n& Arrindell, 1990). Parents' use of either excessive or inad-\nequate control also predicted increased depressive symp-\ntoms in adulthood (Sakado et al., 2000).\nLimited work has examined the relationship between\nadult outcomes and recalled parenting styles that encom-\npass both parental support and control. Moreover, studies\ngenerally include a single negative outcome and frequently\nare limited to clinical samples. Using a sample of clinic out-\npatients along with a healthy community sample, Shah and\nWaller (2000) considered the risk of depressive symptoms\nas they related to both remembered parental care (e.g.,\nwarmth) and overprotection (e.g., control). Depressed adults\nwere more likely than healthy ones to recall their parents as\nuncaring and overprotective. Further, greater parental care\nrather than less overprotection was associated with lower\nvulnerability for depressive symptoms.\nCarter et al. (2001) investigated the link between remem-\nbered parental care and overprotection and later personality\ndysfunction in depressed outpatients. They found that recollec-\ntions of low parental care predicted uncooperativeness, use of\nimmature defenses, and more symptoms of personality disor-\nder compared with parental overprotection. Parker, Boak,\nGriffin, Ripple, and Peay (1999) also observed that patients in\ntheir study (most of whom were depressed) who recalled their\nparentsashighlyindifferent(lowcare)andovercontrollingwere\nmore likely to be diagnosed with personality disorders, anxiety,\ndepressive symptoms, and self-defeating behavior problems. In\ncontrast, patients recalling more optimal parenting--defined as\nhigh affection and balanced levels of control--were least likely\nto be diagnosed with any of these dysfunctions.\nMcCrae and Costa (1988) further found that adults who\nrecalled high parental support were less likely to report neu-\nroticism and scored high on extraversion, agreeableness,\nand openness to new experiences. Additionally, adults who\nrecalled demanding parents were more conventional, con-\nscientious, and assertive. Finally, adults who remembered\nmore indulgent parents developed into confident but self-\ncentered adults. These authors caution, however, that effect\nsizes for these findings were small, and thus parenting expe-\nrienced in childhood may have a limited effect on adult per-\nsonality. Instead, they posit that environmental contexts,\ngenetic factors, and social processes might interact and in-\nfluence personality in adulthood.\nGiven this literature, the current study employs the four\nparenting styles widely used in the child literature based on\na combination of high and low levels of support and control\nto consider the association between parenting styles and\nmultiple dimensions of functioning in mid- and later-life\nadults. The following hypothesis is tested: Adults who re-\nmember parenting behaviors classified as authoritative re-\nport greater psychological well-being, fewer depressive\nsymptoms, and less substance abuse than adults who re-\nmember parenting behaviors categorized as authoritarian,\nuninvolved, or indulgent. We also ask whether sex, race, and\nchildhood SES moderate the connection between remem-\nbered parenting styles and psychological well-being, depres-\nsivesymptoms,andsubstanceabuse,controllingforvariables\nthat are known to be associated with adult functioning.\nMethods\nData\nThe analyses used secondary data from the 1995 Na-\ntional Survey of Midlife Development in the United States\n(MIDUS), which was designed to assess psychological\nwell-being, physical health, and social responsibility in\nmidlife. Using random digit dialing, MIDUS data were\ncollected via 40-minute telephone interviews (response\nrate 70%) followed by self-administered mail-back ques-\ntionnaires (response rate 87%). The sample was limited to\nEnglish-speaking, noninstitutionalized adults between the\nSample\nGiven our focus on the link between psychological and\nbehavioral functioning and childhood parenting styles for\nmiddle-aged and older adults, we limited the analytic sam-\nmen and 1,094 women who completed both the phone inter-\nview and relevant sections of the self-administered ques-\ntionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 54 years\n(SD = 9.51). The majority (89%) of respondents were\nnon-Hispanic White, and most (66%) were married (19%\nseparated/divorced, 9% widowed, and 6% never married).\nRegarding their level of education, 10% had less than a high\nschool degree, 50% had a high school degree or GED, 27%\nhad either a 2- or 4-year college degree, and 13% had a mas-\nter's degree or higher. Reported annual incomes were highly\nIndependent Variables\nRemembered parenting styles from childhood.--Four par-\nenting style categories were developed based on the parent-\ning dimensions of responsiveness and demandingness, as\nlaid out by Maccoby and Martin (1983). (These two distinct\ndimensions of parenting were confirmed by a factor analysis\nconducted on the nine parenting items described subse-\nquently.) First, we constructed the parental support and con-\ntrol scales separately for mothers and fathers. The support\nscale included six items, referring to the years the respondent\nwas growing up, \"How much did your mother/father under-\nstand your problems and worries? How much could you con-\nfide in her/him about things that were bothering you? How\nmuch love and affection did she/he give you? How much\ntime and attention did she/he give you when you needed it?\nHow much effort did she/he put into watching over you and\nmaking sure you had a good upbringing? How much did she/\nhe teach you about life?\" Responses ranged from 1 = a lot to\n4 = not at all. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores\nindicate greater parental support. The remembered parental\nsupport scale was created by calculating the mean across the\nsix items, similar to the approach used by other researchers\n(Ryff, Singer, & Palmersheim, 2004). For households with\ntwo parents, the mean was calculated across the maternal\nand paternal support scale (alpha was .91), consistent with\nthe extensive work of Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts,\nand Dornbusch (1994) on parenting styles.\nThe parental control scale consisted of three items that\nasked about mother and father separately: \"How strict was\nshe/he with her/his rules for you? How consistent was she/\nhe about the rules? How much did she/he stop you from do-\ning things that other kids your age were allowed to do?\"\nResponses ranged from 1 = a lot to 4 = not at all. Again,\nitems were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate\ngreater parental control, and the scale was created by calcu-\nlating the mean across the three items (Ryff et al., 2004). For\nhouseholds with two parents, the mean was calculated across\nthe maternal and paternal control scales (alpha was .79).\nNext, we used the median split on the two parenting di-\nmension scales to establish low and high levels of support\nand low and high levels of control. Finally, we developed\nfour parenting style categories based on distinct combina-\ntions of the levels of parental support and control: high\nsupport and high control parenting were classified as\nauthoritative (29%), low support and high control were\nclassified as authoritarian (19%), high support and low con-\ntrol were categorized as indulgent (21%), and low support\nand low control were classified as uninvolved (31%).\nBased on other categorization approaches used in the\nchild development literature, we also ran the analyses using\na tertile split (Steinberg et al., 1994). That is, we divided the\nsupport and control scales into low, medium, and high levels\nof support and control. Then, only the upper and lower ter-\ntiles were used to create the four parenting styles, and re-\nspondents falling into the medium tertiles (nearly 50%) were\ndeleted from the analyses. This resulted in a sample of 1,118\nadults. The tertile split is often used in child studies because\nit assures four very distinct parenting styles (Steinberg et al).\nAuthoritative parenting included respondents in the highest\ntertiles on both support and control, authoritarian parenting\nincluded those scoring in the lowest tertile on support and\nhighest tertile on control, uninvolved parenting included\nthose scoring in the lowest tertiles on both support and con-\ntrol, and indulgent parenting included those scoring in the\nhighest tertile on support and lowest tertile on control. Re-\nsults based on this classification scheme were similar to\nthose obtained using the median split. One exception was\nthat adults who remembered uninvolved parents reported\ngreater anxiety compared with adults who remembered au-\nthoritative parents using the median split but not the tertile\nsplit. To maintain the more complete sample and increase\ngeneralizability of the findings and power, we chose to re-\nport the results obtained using the median split approach.\nDependent Variables\nPsychological well-being.--Psychological well-being\nwas measured using a mean composite score of the six di-\nmensions of Ryff's (1989) shortened psychological well-\nbeing scale, consistent with the approach used by other\nresearchers (e.g., Marmot & Fuhrer, 2004). The use of a\ncomposite score also reflects our interest in \"overall\" psy-\nchological well-being rather than particular subscales of\nwell-being. Each scale consisted of three items: (a) positive\nrelations with others (e.g., \"I have not experienced many\nwarm and trusting relationships with others\"), (b) self-ac-\nceptance (e.g., \"I like most parts of my personality\"), (c)\nautonomy (e.g., \"I tend to be influenced by people with\nstrong opinions\"), (d) personal growth (e.g., \"For me, life\nhas been a continuous process of learning, changing, and\ngrowth\"), (e) environmental mastery (e.g., \"In general, I\nfeel I am in charge of the situation in which I live\"), and (f)\npurpose in life (e.g., \"Some people wander aimlessly\nthrough life, but I am not one of them\"). Responses ranged\nfrom 1 = strongly agree to 7 = strongly disagree. Mean im-\nputation was used to calculate the sum score when an item\nwas missing. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores\nindicate greater psychological well-being (alpha was .76).\nDepressive symptoms.--Depressive symptoms were as-\nsessed by summing responses to seven yes/no questions\nregarding depressed mood, energy, appetite, sleep, concen-\ntration, feeling down, and suicidal thoughts (e.g., \"During\ntwo weeks in the past 12 months, when you felt sad, blue,\nor depressed, did you lose interest in most things?\"). Higher\nvalues indicate more depressive symptoms (alpha was .53).\nDepressive symptoms were assessed with the World Health\nOrganization's Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview Short Form, which has shown good test\u00adretest reli-\nability and clinical validity (Kessler, Andrews, Mroczek,\nSubstance abuse.--First, alcohol abuse was assessed via\nyes/no responses to five alcohol abuse screening items (e.g.,\n\"Did you ever, during the past 12 months, have such strong\ndesire or urge to use alcohol that you could not resist it or\ncould not think of anything else?\"). Second, illegal drug\nabuse was assessed via yes/no responses to five drug use\nscreening items (e.g., \"Did you ever, during the past 12\nmonths, have any emotional or psychological problems\nfrom using these [illegal] substances?\"). The substance\nabuse scale was created by adding the number of yes\nresponses to the alcohol and drug abuse questions (alpha\nControl Variables\nAge, marital status, education, and income were used as\ncontrol variables in the analyses because past work reports\ndifferences in psychological and behavioral functioning\nbased on these variables. Older adults, married persons, and\nthose with higher education and income tend to exhibit\ngreater psychological and behavioral functioning (Brown,\nDavey, & Zarit, 2008).A dummy variable, \"unmarried,\" was\ncreated for marital status with 0=currently married (66%)\nand 1=not currently married (34%); age, education, and in-\ncome were used as continuous variables. We used a mean\nimputation for missing income values (6%); results did not\ndiffer when using the imputed variable compared with anal-\nyses where cases with missing values were omitted.\nModerator Variables\nAnalyses also tested the effects of sex, race, and child-\nhood SES, along with their interaction with parenting style\nas predictors of adult functioning. Sex was coded 0\u00ad1, with\n1 representing women. Race was coded 0\u00ad1 with 1 repre-\nsenting non-Whites. Childhood SES would ideally be based\non parents' education, income, and/or occupation. How-\never, in the MIDUS data, we were limited to a single item\nasking, \"When you were growing up, were you better off or\nworse off financially than the average family was at that\ntime?\" (1=a lot better off, 7=a lot worse off). This item\nwas reverse coded to indicate higher childhood SES level.\nData Analyses\nTo test our hypothesis and answer our research question,\nwe conducted separate hierarchical multiple regressions for\npsychological well-being (Table 1), depressive symptoms\n(Table 2), and substance abuse (Table 3). For all dependent\nvariables, we included as control variables in Model 1: age,\nmarital status (unmarried), education, and income. These\nfactors are not central to our findings so we do not discuss\nfindings from Model 1 in the results. In Model 2, we added\nthe parenting styles to test our hypothesis. To evaluate\nwhether sex (women), race (non-White), and childhood\nSES moderate the relationship between parenting styles and\nthe dependent variables, we first added the main effects in\nModel 3 and then the nine interaction terms in Model 4 (i.e.,\nsex by the three dummy-coded parenting styles, race by the\nthree dummy-coded parenting styles, and childhood SES by\nthe three dummy-coded parenting styles). Given that the\nlarge number of interactions in Model 4 may limit statistical\npower, we ran each moderating variable in separate models\nas well as together. Because there were no differences in the\nresults, we present the findings for all interactions together\nin Model 4.\nResults\nPsychological Well-Being\nModel 2 in Table 1 shows that adults who remembered\nauthoritarian or uninvolved parenting as children reported\nlower psychological well-being compared with adults who\nrecalled their parents being authoritative. There were no dif-\nferences in well-being between those who had indulgent\ncompared with authoritative parents. Model 4 in Table 1 in-\ndicates that sex was the only variable that moderated the\nrelationship between well-being and remembered parenting\nstyle with regard to uninvolved versus authoritative parent-\ning. Post hoc analysis indicated that although men and\nwomen recalling uninvolved parents did not differ in well-\nbeing, the benefits of authoritative parenting for well-being\nwere significantly greater for men than women.\nDepressive Symptoms\nModel 2 in Table 2 indicates that adults who remem-\nbered authoritarian or uninvolved parents reported more\ndepressive symptoms than did adults who remembered au-\nthoritative parents. There was no difference in depressive\nsymptoms between respondents remembering indulgent\ncompared with authoritative parents. Model 4 in Table 2\nindicates that only race moderated the relationship between\ndepressive symptoms and parenting style with regard to the\nauthoritarian versus authoritative parenting groups. Post\nhoc analysis indicated no race differences among respon-\ndents remembering authoritative parenting, yet among\nthose who remembered authoritarian parenting Whites re-\nported more depressive symptoms than did non-Whites.\nTherefore, compared with authoritative parenting, authori-\ntarian parenting appears to contribute to more depressive\nsymptoms for Whites but not non-Whites.\nSubstance Abuse\nModel 2 in Table 3 shows that adults who remembered\nuninvolved parents reported more substance abuse compared\nwith those who remembered authoritative parents. There\nwere no differences in substance abuse for adults in either\nthe authoritarian or the indulgent parenting group compared\nwith those in the authoritative parenting group. Model 4 in\nTable 3 shows that neither sex, nor race, nor childhood SES\nmoderates the relationship between substance abuse and any\nof the parenting styles.\nDiscussion\nAmple evidence shows that authoritative parenting predicts\nmore positive outcomes for children and adolescents than\nother types of parenting styles (Coplan et al., 2002; Steinberg,\n2001). This study advances that body of work by assessing\nwhether established parenting styles from childhood--\nauthoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved--as\nremembered by adults, predict psychological well-being,\ndepressive symptoms, and substance abuse in midlife and\nbeyond. We also tested whether sex, race/ethnicity, and child-\nhood SES moderate the association between remembered\nparenting styles and the multiple dimensions of adult func-\ntioning. Our findings add to the literature on parenting styles\nin childhood and functioning in mid- to later life by providing\nevidence that remembered authoritative parenting is linked\nwith more positive adult outcomes compared with recalled\nauthoritarian and uninvolved parenting behaviors. However,\nin only two situations did sex and race act as moderators.\nRemembered Parenting Styles and Adult Functioning\nWe found some support for our hypothesis that adults who\nremember parenting behaviors classified as authoritative\nreport greater psychological well-being, fewer depressive\nsymptoms, and less substance abuse than adults who remem-\nber parenting behaviors categorized as authoritarian, unin-\nvolved, or indulgent. There were significant effects of\nparenting style for psychological well-being and depressive\nsymptoms, but only regarding authoritarian and uninvolved\nparenting compared with authoritative parenting.As expected,\nadults who remembered more authoritarian or uninvolved\nparenting reported lower psychological well-being and more\ndepressive symptoms than those remembering authoritative\nparenting in childhood. Additionally, adults recalling unin-\nvolved parenting in childhood rather than authoritative par-\nenting reported greater substance abuse. These findings,\nwhich are consistent with the child development literature\nand studies of adults (Parker et al., 1999; Shah & Waller,\ncourse perspective (Elder, 1998) by suggesting that positive\nTable 1. Hierarchical Regression Coefficients for Psychological Well-Being (N = 2,231)\nControl variables\nParenting style\nInteractions\nNotes: a Comparison group is authoritative parenting.\noutcomes associated with authoritative parenting in child-\nhood can extend into adulthood--at least as they relate to\nremembered parenting styles--and merit continued investi-\ngation.\nOur finding that parenting style was less influential in\nadults' reports of substance abuse than psychological well-\nbeing and depression was unexpected but may reflect the\nlifespan development notion that human development is re-\nmarkably plastic and shaped by a diverse set of influences\n(Baltes, 1987). The life course perspective also suggests\nthat life experiences may provide opportunities for change\nthat can redirect trajectories such that positive functioning\nin adulthood can be achieved even if early experiences are\nless than ideal (Elder, 1998). For instance, as persons move\ninto adulthood, their range of experiences and exposure to\nnonparental socializing agents expands dramatically. These\nnew situations provide alternative influences that may con-\ntribute to development, thereby reducing the link between\nearly parenting and diverse outcomes. For persons experi-\nencing nonoptimal parenting early in life and problems in\nchildhood and adolescence, formation of positive relation-\nships and introduction to stable socializing experiences as\nadults can be major turning points (Uggen & Massoglia,\nThe fact that we found fewer significant parenting style\ndifferences in relation to substance abuse than to our other\noutcomes could also be due to the MIDUS sampling frame.\nMIDUS used a community sample that excluded institu-\ntionalized adults. Given the link between criminal behavior\nand alcohol and drug abuse (Goode, 2007), the heaviest\ndrinkers and drug abusers may be more involved in crime\nand other negative behaviors that remove them from the\ngeneral population and thus our sample. Adults not in-\ncluded in the MIDUS survey may have selected themselves\nout through illegal behavior and imprisonment or institu-\ntionalization for mental health problems. Selection bias\nmay have reduced our ability to reveal significant associa-\ntions.\nIn addition, and contrary to our expectations, there were\nno outcome differences between adults who remembered\nauthoritative parents and those who remembered indulgent\nparents. This is also inconsistent with findings that children\nand adolescents whose parents are considered indulgent\nversus authoritative have less positive outcomes (Steinberg,\n2001). One possibility is that high levels of support provide\na buffer for future negative outcomes, even in cases where\nchildren lack firm parental discipline. For example, children\nwhose parents are supportive share values similar to their\nparents and are more open to parental influence (Steinberg,\n2008). Thus, even if parents are supportive but lack control,\ntheir children's long-term behavior may not be a problem\nbecause over time they may model their supportive parents'\nbehavior and adopt prosocial ways. Additionally, as they\nmature, children may benefit from nonfamilial environ-\nments that provide or require discipline and control, such\nas school and jobs. Thus, even children who lack early\nTable 2.

No clear and overarching patterns were\nfound. Both sex and race revealed one significant interac-\ntion, but none were found for childhood SES. Comparisons\nbetween adults recalling authoritative versus nonauthoritative\nparents indicated that authoritative behaviors are predictive\nof enhanced psychological well-being and fewer depressive\nsymptoms. These benefits, however, were limited to partic-\nular subgroups of the adult population. Authoritative par-\nenting appears to benefit men more than women, but only in\nterms of greater psychological well-being, and authoritative\nparenting benefits Whites more than non-Whites regarding\nreduced depressive symptoms.\nSimilar to our findings, sex and race differences in the child\ndevelopment literature are ambiguous in terms of parenting\nstyles and outcomes (Hart et al., 2002). Some researchers note\nsex and race differences in outcomes based on parenting styles\n(e.g., Hart et al.), whereas others report limited or no sex and\nrace differences (Finkelstein et al., 2001). Regarding the lack\nof race differences in our study, it should be noted that the vast\nmajority of participants were non-HispanicWhite, which may\nhave masked finer group differences. Studies with larger num-\nbers of racial and ethnic groups may increase the statistical\npower to detect significant differences in adult functioning.\nMoreover, the lack of a moderating effect for childhood SES\nmay be related to our measure. MIDUS included few ques-\ntions regarding respondents' parents, especially pertaining to\ninformation from childhood. A more comprehensive measure\nthat includes parents' education, income, and financial status\nfrom childhood may reveal differences in the link between\nadult functioning and remembered parenting styles.\nAnother limitation of our study is the retrospective ac-\ncounts of parental behavior in childhood. The validity of\nchildhood memories is often called into question because\nrespondents' present status (e.g., psychological well-being)\nmay shape childhood memories (e.g., Halverson, 1988).\nHowever, we do not attempt to treat our retrospective data as\na proxy for longitudinal data or as a means for establishing\ncausality. Henry, Moffitt, Caspi, Langley, & Silva (1995)\nalso noted that retrospective measures \"may constitute valid\nindicators of the individual's current perception of those fea-\ntures [of interest to social scientists], and as such, may be\nuseful in understanding psychological development or ad-\njustment\" (p. 93). In addition, some evidence suggests that\nconcerns about retrospective childhood data are exaggerated\n(Brewin, Andrews, & Gotlib, 1993). McCrae and Costa\n(1988) found strong concordance in reports of recalled par-\nenting styles in childhood between siblings, which provides\nsome evidence of the accuracy of retrospective accounts of\nparenting styles.\nTable 3.

However,\nBlock (1971) showed a strong correlation between retro-\nspective accounts of childhood experiences and objective\nassessments by mothers that were taken in childhood.\nSchwartz, Barton-Henry, and Pruzinsky (1985) also found\nadolescents' reports of parental behavior to be more accu-\nrate than those of parents. Another limitation is that our de-\ncision to use the framework of Maccoby and Martin (1983)\nfor identifying parenting typologies begs the question of\nwhether our results would be similar using the approach of\nBaumrind (1971) to defining parenting styles. Specifically,\nBaumrind used both psychological control and behavioral\ncontrol to distinguish authoritarian parents from other parents.\nOur data, unfortunately, did not address psychological\ncontrol, which prevented us from using Baumrind's typology.\nFuture researchers should consider various approaches to\ndeveloping parenting typologies to investigate the relation-\nship between remembered parenting styles and diverse psy-\nchological and behavioral outcomes in adulthood.\nDespite these limitations, this study is the first to investigate\nthe link between four typologies of remembered parenting\nstyles from childhood and psychological and behavioral func-\ntioning in mid- to late adulthood. Despite generally small effect\nsizes, our results provide some support that remembered par-\nenting styles are related to adult functioning, which supports\nfindings in the child development literature and adult literature\nbased on clinical samples and single outcomes. In addition, our\nfindings seem to suggest that human development is character-\nized by resiliency, flexibility, and malleability, at least for com-\nmunity dwelling adults. It may be that some adults, at least\nthose living in community settings, are able to rise above nega-\ntive influences in childhood by seeking out or attracting envi-\nronments, opportunities, and relationships that promote adult\nfunctioning. More research is clearly warranted in this area to\ngain a better understanding of factors (both current and retro-\nspective) that enhance positive adult development.\n"
