Obe-\nsity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher.\nlence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI 25) were 68.0% (95%\n66.9%). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for\nboth men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend\nnot differ significantly from each other.\nand 35.5% among adult women.
