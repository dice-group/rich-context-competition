Although reasons for napping are usually tied to night-\ntime sleep, the majority of studies assess their effects independently.\nThe current study thus aimed to examine the health relevance of patterns\nof sleep behaviour that take into account both night-time and daytime\nsleep habits. Night-time sleep, recorded during 7 days via actigraphy\nStates II Biomarker study, was assessed. Blood and urine specimens\nwere assayed for noradrenaline, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.\nParticipants self-reported nap behaviour, depressive symptoms, per-\nceived chronic stress and the presence of medical symptoms and\nconditions. Overall, nappers (n = 208) showed elevated waist\u00adhip ratios,\nC-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels compared to non-nappers and\nreported more physiological symptoms and conditions (all P  0.019).\nWithin nappers, cluster analysis revealed three patterns of sleep\nbehaviour--infrequent nappers with good night-time sleep, frequent\nnappers with good night-time sleep and nappers with poor night-time\nsleep. Nappers with poor night-time sleep thereby exhibited elevated\nnoradrenaline levels, depressive symptoms and perceived stress scores\ncompared to other groups (all P  0.041). These findings support the\nidea that nap\u00adhealth relationships are complex, in that frequency of\nnapping and accumulation of nap sleep is not related linearly to health\nconsequences. Assessing nap behaviour in conjunction with night-time\nsleep behaviour appeared crucial to elucidate further the health\nrelevance of napping, particularly in terms of psychological health\noutcomes, including chronic stress and depressive symptoms.\nINTRODUCTION\nSleep is crucial for maintaining both physical and mental\nhealth. Consequently, sleep problems and short sleep have\nbeen linked to depression (Goldstein and Walker, 2014;\nLuyster et al., 2012), as well as cardiovascular morbidity,\nhypertension and obesity (Magee et al., 2008; Mullington\net al., 2009). Furthermore, sleep-restricted individuals show\nelevated inflammatory processes, as indicated by elevated\ninterleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (Ferrie\nHowever, more sleep does not necessarily equal better\noverall health. In fact, oversleeping has been shown to have\nnegative physical and psychological health implications as\nfindings emphasize the importance of maintaining a delicate\nbalance in order to reap the full health benefits of sleep.\nImportantly, this does not apply only to night-time sleep, but\nto sleep occurring at any time during a 24-h period (Evans\nIn addition to sleeping at night, approximately 50% of\nAmericans report sleeping during the day (National Sleep\nFoundation, 2013). Although such a frequent behaviour, its\nhealth consequences are not well understood. Naps have\nbeen shown to improve cognitive performance, reduce\nsubjective sleepiness and improve mood in healthy subjects\nand, furthermore, to restore IL-6 levels following sleep\nadults, napping is associated with higher body mass index\n(BMI) and central adiposity (Owens et al., 2010), and in older\nadults, frequent napping is associated with depressive\nsymptoms, an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, and excess\nNotably, variation in nap duration and frequency as well as\nmethodological issues can complicate the determination of\nhealth consequences. For example, while laboratory studies\ncan manipulate circumstances to address how napping\ncontributes to health outcomes, they may not be generaliz-\nable to natural sleep behaviour. Conversely, observational\nsleep studies provide insight into naturally occurring sleep\nbehaviour, but often exclude nap information, use incidence\nof napping as a classifier only or focus upon how previous\nsleep affects subsequent napping, and vice versa. While\nthese approaches are paramount to understanding the\ninterplay between sleep and health, napping is treated as a\nbehaviour distinct from night-time sleep. However, quantity\nand quality of night-time sleep may influence reasons for\nnapping and thereby affect its links to health outcomes\ndifferentially. For example, naps taken to compensate for\npoor night-time sleep may differ in their health consequences\nfrom naps taken for enjoyment. This raises the question of to\nwhat extent napping behaviour must be considered in\nconjunction with night-time sleep behaviour in order to\nunderstand sleep\u00adhealth relationships fully.\nTo address this question, the current study aimed to\nassess relationships between health and naturally occurring\nsleep behaviour patterns by conceptualizing (i) napping as\nsleep behaviour occurring in conjunction with night-time\nsleep and (ii) health as chronic health conditions, opera-\ntionalized as chronic psychological health outcomes (e.g.\ndepressive symptoms), physiological health mediators (e.g.\ninflammatory marker IL-6) and physiological health outcomes\n(e.g. total number of symptoms and conditions reported). To\nrelate current findings to the recent literature, health effects of\nnapping were determined by comparing napping and non-\nnapping individuals. To address the main aim of the study,\ninterindividual differences in patterns of daytime and night-\ntime sleep combinations within napping individuals were\nrelated to the same above-mentioned health outcomes.\nThe data utilized came from the Midlife in the United States\nII (MIDUS II) Biomarker study. Participants provided 7 days'\nworth of sleep and nap information, psychological health\nquestionnaires and blood samples for biomarker analysis.\nThis data set allows capturing an individual's sleep habits by\nassessing actual sleep behaviour during the course of a\nweek by actigraphy (night-time sleep) and diary (napping) as\nwell as assessing a wide range of physiological and\npsychological health issues.\nParticipants\nParticipants in this study were a subset of 368 healthy adults\nwho took part in the MIDUS II Biomarker study as well as the\nfollow-up actigraphy sleep study at the University of Wiscon-\nsin, Madison (Ryff et al., 2013). Participants were excluded\nfrom analysis for having incomplete data (n = 23), abnor-\nmally high waist\u00adhip ratios (n = 2; > 4 standard deviations\n(SD) above the mean), abnormally high overnight urinary\nnoradrenaline secretion [n = 1; 8 standard deviations (SD)\nabove the mean], disordered sleep behaviour (n = 1; total\nnap time 7 SD above the mean) and acute infection, i.e. IL-\nmet the above requirements and were included in analyses.\nParticipants were divided further into two groups--those who\nreported napping at least once (n = 208) and those who did\nnot report napping (n = 105) during the study period. The\nstudy protocol was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison, and informed\nwritten consent was obtained for all participant.\nProtocol\nParticipants were recruited from the MIDUS II Biomarker\nProject study population. Upon arrival at the University of\nWisconsin, participants underwent a physical examination\nand a medical history interview with a clinician and completed\na set of self-report questionnaires assessing demographic,\npsychological and medical variables before an overnight\nstay. During this stay, 12-h overnight urinary samples were\ncollected. Fasting blood samples were obtained the next\nreceived detailed instructions on the at-home data collection\nportion, including self-reported sleep assessments and an\nActiwatch to be worn around the wrist for seven consecutive\ndays and nights (see Dienberg Love et al. (2010) for more\ndetails).\nMeasures\nActigraphy\nSleep behaviour data were collected using actigraphs (Acti-\nwatch\u00e2-64; Mini Mitter, Bend, OR, USA, now Philips\nRespironics). Respondents began recording at 07:00 hours\non the first Tuesday morning after their overnight stay and\ncontinued for seven consecutive nights, indicating when they\nstarted trying to fall asleep (bedtime) and when they arose in\nthe morning (rise time) by pressing the event marker button\non the Actiwatch. Upon return of the Actiwatches to MIDUS\nproject staff, event marker and sleep diary information\nassisted automatic detection of sleep intervals by manufac-\nturer algorithms (Actiware 5, Philips Respironics) (Ancoli-\nIsrael et al., 2003). Anomalous or incomplete actigraphy\nintervals were reviewed further by study staff and hand-\nscored or deleted as appropriate. Average sleep duration,\nefficiency and latency were determined by averaging respec-\ntive values from each of the seven study nights for each\nparticipant.\n226 J. K. Devine and J. M. Wolf\nNap reporting\nNapping was assessed by the MIDUS Biomarker Project\nDaily Sleep Diary, a daily sleep diary, which was completed\nat bedtime on each of the seven study days. Participants\nreported whether napping occurred on any given day and, if\nso, listed the nap(s) duration. No participants reported\nmultiple naps at any given day; thus, nap frequency is\nequivalent to number of days a participant reported a nap.\nNaps of a self-reported duration of 1 min or more were\nconsidered for analyses. Total nap time was determined by\nsumming the duration of each nap occurring during the study\nweek to provide a cumulative measure of weekly napping.\nBiomarkers/health mediators\nNoradrenaline (NE) and cortisol levels were assessed in one\novernight 12-h urine sample collected during the in-laboratory\novernight stay. NE concentrations were determined by high-\npressure liquid chromatography, while urinary free cortisol and\nd(3)-cortisol levels were measured by enzymatic colorimetric\nassay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry\nusing multiple reaction monitoring in positive mode (Taylor\nwere adjusted to 0.019 lg dL\u00c01. A cholesterol panel and the\ninflammatory markers CRP and IL-6 were assessed in fasting\ning the in-laboratory overnight stay. Serum and plasma was\nisolated from the respective samples, aliquoted, frozen at\n\u00c080\u00b0C, shipped on dry ice to the MIDUS Biocore Laboratory\nand stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until assayed. IL-6 was measured using\nthe Quantikine\u00e2 high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosor-\nbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA)\nand CRP was measured using the BNII nephelometer from\nDade Behring (Deerfield, IL, USA) utilizing a particle-\nenhanced immunonepholometric assay. CRP values\nthe ratio between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)\nand low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), first HDL\ncholesterol was determined using a lipid assay (Roche\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). HDL values >120\nmg dL\u00c01 were adjusted to 121 mg dL\u00c01. Next, an estimation\nof LDL-cholesterol level was made using the Fridewald formula\nfrom direct measurements of total cholesterol, triglycerides\nand HDL cholesterol (Ryff et al., 2013). Lastly, a HDL/LDL\nratio was computed by dividing HDL values with LDL values.\nWaist\u00adhip ratio was measured by study clinicians using a\nGulik II tape measure during the participants' visits to UW-\nMadison.

The questions are general in nature and\navoid content specific to subpopulations (Cohen et al., 1983).\nResponses assess frequency of feelings of stress during the\nlast month, with a higher PSS score indicating higher\nperceived chronic stress.\nThe `Symptoms and Conditions' category of the MIDUS\nBiomarker Project Medical History questionnaire was utilized\nto assess participants' health status. The total number of\nsymptoms and conditions per participant was calculated by\nsumming the presence of physician-confirmed self-report of\nsymptoms and conditions.\nStatistical analyses\nA three-step approach was used to address the study aims.\nAll analyses controlled for age, gender and race. First,\nnappers were compared to non-nappers with regard to\ndemographics and sleep parameters using chi-squared tests\nor analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Hierarchical regression\nanalyses were computed to test associations between\nnapping behaviour and health outcomes as well as to explore\nthe potential mediating effects of average night-time sleep\nduration on these associations. To capture the complexity of\nsleep behaviour, while at the same time avoiding computing\nmultiple sets of regressions, a two-step cluster analysis was\nchosen to address the second aim of the study (King, 1967).\nThe cluster analysis combined self-report nap variables (nap\nfrequency, total nap time) as well as actigraphy-determined\nnight-time sleep variables (average sleep duration, average\nsleep efficiency, sleep latency). Schwarz's Bayesian infor-\nmation criterion (BIC) was used for establishing the optimal\nnumber of clusters and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the\nclassification relevance of variables. Clusters were tested for\nassociations with health-relevant outcome variables using\nANCOVAs. All analyses were computed in SPSS version 22.0.\nStatistical significance was assumed at P  0.05.\nRESULTS\nNappers versus non-nappers\nNappers and non-nappers were compared on all study\nvariables. Results are summarized in Table 1 and show no\ndifferences in terms of gender, race, marital status or age (all\nP > 0.23).

Interestingly, of 313 partic-\nipants, 208 reported napping between one and seven times\nduring the study week. Overall, individuals who reported\nnapping exhibited elevated levels of the inflammatory\nbiomarkers IL-6 and CRP, greater waist\u00adhip ratios and a\nlarger number of total symptoms and conditions compared to\nnon-nappers. Within nappers, three distinct patterns of sleep\nbehaviour emerged that were characterized further by differ-\nential associations with NE, chronic stress levels and\ndepressive symptoms.\nSleep, demographic and health differences in nappers\nand non-nappers\nApproximately 66% of participants in the current study\nreported napping during the course of a week. As such, our\nfindings are in line with earlier studies reporting prevalence\nrates of napping in healthy adult populations in the range of\nhigher rates being observed in adults above 60 years than\nof differences between nappers and non-nappers in terms of\nnap behaviour shown in the current study appears to be\nrepresentative of sleep habits observed in other studies and\nthe general population.\nWith regard to health-related outcome measures, nappers\nexhibited significantly higher IL-6 and CRP levels as well as\nhigher waist\u00adhip ratios and more medical symptoms and\nconditions. These findings are in line with observations\nfrom earlier studies linking napping to obesity as well as\ninflammation-related diseases (Foley et al., 2007; Hays\ntantly, inflammation has been shown consistently to lead to\nFigure 2. Differences in health indicators between sleep clusters showing insomnolent sleepers (cluster 3) exhibiting the highest levels of\nurinary noradrenaline, depressive symptomatology [assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale] and perceived\nchronic stress [assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)]. Predominantly `night-time sleepers' describes participants in cluster 1, `siesta\nsleepers' describes participants in cluster 2 and `insomnolent sleepers' describes participants in cluster 3.\n230 J. K. Devine and J. M. Wolf\npathological sleepiness (Cho et al., 2013), while obesity has\nbeen related to daytime fatigue (Vgontzas et al., 1998). Thus,\nfeelings of fatigue may drive the urge to nap. Additionally,\ninflammatory processes are linked closely to obesity (Park\net al., 2005) and both inflammation as well as adiposity are,\nin turn, associated with overall morbidity and mortality,\nparticularly from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other\nchronic diseases (Wang et al., 2011). However, controlling\nfor number of medical conditions did not abolish the link\nbetween napping and markers of inflammation or obesity,\nsuggesting a more complex role of napping.\nDifferential health effects of sleep patterns\nGiven nappers' elevated health risks as well as earlier\nfindings suggesting non-linear associations between napping\nand health outcomes, we next investigated the potential of\nsleep pattern-dependent health effects within nappers. Clus-\nter analysis thereby revealed three natural groupings (clus-\nters) of daytime and night-time sleep behaviour. One group of\nindividuals (cluster 1) slept predominantly at night, and only\nnapped infrequently during the study period. Participants in\nthis cluster exhibited sleep parameters comparable to non-\nnappers, such as high sleep efficiency and duration, and\ngood self-reported sleep satisfaction. Participants in cluster 2\nnapped more days than not during the study week. This nap\nbehaviour resembles the siesta, which is defined commonly\nas a traditional mid-day short nap practised by many cultures\nworldwide. However, considering that time of day when naps\nwere taken was not recorded in the present MIDUS II\nsubproject, it is important to note that `siesta nappers' may\nnot be taking mid-afternoon naps, or be napping at a\nconsistent time of day across the cluster. In addition, when\ncompared to individuals in cluster 1, these siesta sleepers\ndid not exhibit any detriments in sleep latency or efficiency. A\nthird group of participants (cluster 3) exhibited the worst\nnight-time sleep of any of the groups and napped less than\nsiesta sleepers, but more than predominantly night sleepers.\nIt could be speculated that individuals in this third group are\ninsomnolent sleepers, in that they do not gain enough sleep\nregardless of time of day.\nWhile nappers exhibited elevated inflammation, obesity\nand more medical conditions compared to non-nappers,\nthese health indicators were not associated differentially with\nsleep behaviour patterns in the three groups of nappers. This\nsuggests that, contrary to earlier reports (Dinges, 1992), the\noccurrence of napping per se may be indicative of increased\nhealth problems related to obesity and inflammation, inde-\npendent of specific manifestations of sleep habits.\nContrarily, sleep behaviour differences within nappers were\nrelated to NE levels and mental health outcome variables.\nInsomnolent sleepers not only showed the highest NE levels,\nbut reported the highest number of depressive symptoms and\nperceived the highest level of stress compared to predom-\ninantly night or siesta sleepers. The current study is not the\nfirst to observe the co-occurrence of elevated NE and mental\nhealth effects in the context of sleep. A study by Mezick et al.\n(2009) showed that NE was associated with higher sleep\nfragmentation and moderated by negative affect (Mezick\net al., 2009). Furthermore, napping has been associated\nrepeatedly with depression (Foley et al., 2007). The current\nfindings suggest that frequency of napping per se may not be\nresponsible for this effect, as siesta sleepers showed similar\nnapping frequency without elevated depressive symptoms or\nperceived stress levels. Instead, the poor night-time sleep\nshown by insomnolent sleepers may be detrimental in terms of\nelevated stress and depressive symptoms independently of\nnapping behaviour. Put differently, although napping has\nbeen linked previously to increased risk for mental health\nproblems, daytime sleep behaviour may not be related to an\nincreased risk for depression provided that night-time sleep\nquality is high. These findings lend support for an emphasis on\nconsidering sleep as a complex behaviour consisting of\ninterdependent daytime and night-time occurrences of varying\nlengths and quality.\nLimitations\nThe current findings should be assessed in light of several\nlimitations. Primarily, participants were not distributed equally\ninto clusters. While the overall number in the present study\nwas sufficiently large to investigate sleep and health rela-\ntionships, the smaller number for insomnolent sleepers\nprecluded the assessment of gender, age or race as\nmoderators. Secondly, the current study used cluster anal-\nysis to detect sleep behaviour patterns. While cluster analysis\nallows for the grouping of variables, it does not provide\ninformation on why certain variables may be clustered, and\nfuture studies will have to characterize the determinants of\ndistinct sleep behaviour patterns. Thirdly, considering time of\nday when napping occurred may be a promising additional\nfactor when assessing health effects of sleep behaviour,\ngiven that naps taken in the evening may be more detrimen-\ntal for night-time sleep quality (Milner and Cote, 2009).\nMoreover, self-reported nap behaviour was not compared\nwith actigraphy data to confirm nap frequency or duration; nor\ndid participants record whether naps were premeditated or\nspontaneous, information that may be helpful in determining\nindividual differences within nappers. Fourthly, habitual\nnapping is a potential marker for sleep apnea (Masa et al.,\n2006). Future studies would benefit from including diagnostic\nassessment of sleep apnea. Fifthly, self-reported sleep\nassessed during the month prior to the study (PSQI:\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) correlated significantly with\nthe equivalent actigraphy-based sleep measures (data not\nreported). However, multiple weeks of actigraphy data\ncollection would be needed to evaluate how well 1 week of\nsleep assessment reflects an individual's sleep habits. Lastly,\nstatistical and conceptual concerns precluded the assess-\nment of links between sleep behaviour patterns and specific\ndisease patterns or syndromes, representing another promis-\ning avenue for future studies.\nSleep patterns in MIDUS II 231\nIn summary, napping was a prevalent behaviour in the\nassessed study population, with the majority of nappers\nexhibiting shorter night-time sleep duration compared to non-\nnappers. Independently of medical conditions or health effects\nof shorter night-time sleep duration, however, individuals who\nnapped were more likely to show elevated inflammatory\nprocesses and adiposity, suggesting that napping may indi-\ncate greater distinct health risks over and above being a\nconsequence of ill health. When focusing on nappers only,\nthose showing a combination of less frequent napping and\npoor night-time sleep exhibited higher chronic stress, depres-\nsive symptoms and elevated NE levels. While napping can be\na consequence of stress and depression negatively affecting\nnight-time sleep, the current findings suggest that individuals\nwho nap may not be at a greater risk for depression as long as\ntheir night-time sleep is sufficient in quantity and quality.\nTherefore, the present study is a first step towards determining\nwhich sleep behaviour changes may be promising for\ndecreasing negative health effects. In order to help tease\napart which sleep behaviours are benign and which should be\navoided, the next important step will be to identify the\ndeterminants and underlying mechanisms differentiating func-\ntional nap and night-time sleep behaviour patterns and sleep\npatterns that are related to health detriments.\n"
