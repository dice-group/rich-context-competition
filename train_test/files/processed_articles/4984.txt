    "abstract": "Abstract. It is unclear how shadows are processed in the visual system. Whilst shadows are clearly\nused as an important cue to localise the objects that cast them, there is mixed evidence regarding\nthe extent to which shadows influence the recognition of those objects. Furthermore experiments\nexploring the perception of shadows per se have provided evidence that the visual system has less\nefficient access to the detailed form of a region if it is interpreted as a shadow. The current study\nsought to clarify our understanding of the manner in which shadows are represented by the visual\nsystem by exploring how they influence attention in two different object-based attention paradigms.\nThe results provide evidence that cues to interpret a region as a shadow do not reduce the extent to\nwhich that region will result in a within-`object' processing advantage. Thus, whilst there is evidence\nthat shadows are processed differently at higher stages of object perception, the present result shows\nthat they are still represented as distinctly segmented regions as far as the allocation of attention is\nconcerned. This result is consistent with the idea that object-based attention phenomena result from\nregion-based scene segmentation rather than from the representations of objects per se.\n",

The limited\ncapacity of the visual system can be employed most effectively if it is focused on those\naspects of visual structure that most effectively enable us to recognise objects and to\nact upon them. Shadows pose an interesting representational challenge in this context\nbecause on the one hand, they do not represent inherent structure in the environment,\nbut on the other, they are potentially informative with respect to the objects that cast\nthem. Reviewing the status of shadows in the human visual system reveals a somewhat\nmixed picture, in which inconsistencies in the pattern of illumination implied by shadows\nare hard to identify (Ostrovsky et al 2005) and in some contexts have no measurable\ninfluence on object recognition (Braje et al 2000; Bonfiglioli et al 2004), but in other contexts\nshadows clearly aid and/or interfere with object recognition (Tarr et al 1998). Moreover,\nthe effect of illumination on the shading within an object clearly has a direct influence on\nshape perception (Ramachandran 1988). Whilst shadows thus have a mixed role in object\nrecognition, they do seem to play an important role in computing the location (Imura et\nthat cast them. Most critically for the current study, however, is evidence that access to the\nvisual form of a region is influenced by whether or not it can be interpreted as a shadow\n(Rensink and Cavanagh 2004; Lovell et al 2009). This article seeks to build on the fact that the\ninterpretation of a region as a shadow can alter the accessibility of the form of that region\nby testing whether cues that alter the interpretability of a region as a shadow influence the\nallocation of attention to that region, using `object'-based attention paradigms.\nShadows, objects, and attention 151\nThe concept of an object is potentially controversial in the context of attention (see\nDriver et al 2001 for an insightful critique of the use of the concept of an object in the\ncontext of attention, a topic to which we will return in the Discussion); however, it is\ngenerally acknowledged that some form of perceptual organisation influences the allocation\nof attention (Scholl 2001). Furthermore this perceptual organisation that leads to the objects\nselected by attention cannot be understood simply in terms of contrast boundaries; rather,\nit is the manner in which those boundaries are interpreted that is critical (Anstis 1990;\nexample of this (although not typically cited in the context of the object-based attention\nliterature) is provided by Anstis (1990), who shows that it is essentially impossible to track\nthe intersection between two lines when those lines appear to be two separately moving\nitems. The same physical intersection is, however, trivial to track when those lines can be\ninterpreted as moving together (as one, cross like, shape). More recently the role of higher\nlevel perceptual organisation has been demonstrated in paradigms that exploit the `within-\nvs-between object' advantage (cf Egly et al 1994). Classically, these paradigms demonstrate\nthat a target is more easily detected or discriminated when it is preceded by a cue or paired\nwith a comparison target within the same, rather than in a different, object. Albrecht et al\n(2008) recently showed that whilst this within-vs-between object advantage was elicited by a\nset of contrast boundaries forming a figure on top of a surface, the same contrast boundaries\nwould not elicit this effect when perceived as a `hole' cut into that surface. In another recent\nexample Naber et al (2011) exploited a bi-stable grouping stimulus (cf Lorenceau and Shiffrar\n1992) to show that the facilitation effect seen in comparing two targets on the same object\nis contingent not just on the sensory input but also on whether that input is perceptually\ngrouped or not. The fact that higher level factors in perceptual organisation can influence\nthe extent to which a set of closed contrast boundaries can be selected as a unit of attention\nopens the question as to whether the interpretation of a given region as a shadow would\ninfluence the extent to which that region could be selected by attention.\nThe idea that the same physical shape can be represented in a perceptually less salient\nmanner when interpreted as a shadow was suggested by work, mentioned above, by Rensink\nand Cavanagh (2004). More specifically, Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) asked participants\nto search for a target that had a different orientation to other items in a display. Rensink\nand Cavanagh found that this visual search, or oddity detection, task was harder to perform\nwhen the items in the display could be interpreted as shadows. The interpretability of the\nstimuli as shadows was manipulated in a number of ways; one clearly effective method (also\nemployed in the current set of experiments) simply required the removal of the object that\ncast the shadow.\nTo review, shadows have a rather mixed status in influencing different elements of\nvisual perception, they play a clear role in influencing the perception of the location of\nthe objects casting them, they play a more ambiguous role in aiding the recognition of\nthe objects that cast them, and of particular importance for the present study, there is\nevidence that the interpretation of a region as a shadow appears to lead to that region\nbeing processed differently. It is in this context that the current project set out to test the\nstatus of shadows in two different object-based attention paradigms, in which cue-target\npairings (Egly et al 1994) and the comparison of two targets (Ben-Shahar et al 2007) are\nfacilitated when presented on the same object. Given previous evidence that the manner\nin which a scene is organised will impact the extent to which regions of that scene will\nshow `within-object' advantages, this research seeks to exploit the techniques developed\nby Rensink and Cavanagh for manipulating `shadow-hood' to ask whether the same region\n152 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge\nwill be differentially selectable as a unit of attention when that region can or cannot be\ninterpreted as a shadow.\nTwenty-five participants were recruited in exchange for course credits. All participants were\nfirst-year psychology undergraduates with normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants\nwere naive as to the aims of the study. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 38 (mean 20).\nThere were 8 males and 17 females.\nThe experiment was programmed in Borland C++, with the use of DirectX to ensure accurate\ntimings. Stimuli were constructed off-line before the experiment using the 3-D rendering\npackage `POV-Ray'. This programme uses accurate ray tracing in order to visualise the way in\nwhich light will disperse in 3-D scenes, and thereby provides an optimal image-rendering\nenvironment in which to generate veridical shadows. The stimuli were presented on 17 inch\nThe experiment employed a 3 by 2 within-participants design. The first factor, Cue Type, had\nthree levels: valid (cue appears in same location as the target), invalid-within (cue appears at\na different location but on the same region), and invalid-between (cue appears at a different\nlocation on a different region), as shown in Figure 1. There were equal numbers of each cue\ntype, and these were randomly distributed across trials. The second factor, Shadow Type, had\ntwo levels: either the shaded regions could or could not be interpreted as shadows. In line\nwith Rensink and Cavanagh's (2004) study this was achieved by removing the objects that\ncast the shadows. Shadow or Non-shadow-like stimuli were presented in separate blocks, the\norder of which was counterbalanced across participants.\nOne of the critical factors in the original Egly et al (1994) paradigm pertains to the distance\nbetween the cues and the targets. In order to establish the effect of objects upon attention,\nit was critical to equate the distance between and within objects, such that any differences\ncould not be explained in spatial terms. The Egly et al result and the many replications\nthat have followed have clearly demonstrated that this influence of object structure upon\nattention occurs in addition to that accounted for by the spatial distances between cues and\ntargets. The fact that our stimuli are rendered in a 3-D perspective (in order to enhance the\nperception of our stimuli as shadows) complicates this aspect of control. This complication\narises because it is evident that attention is influenced by `size constancy' such that attention\noperates in perceived rather than retinal space (Robertson and Kim 1999). It is therefore\nmore appropriate to align the distances between the stimuli in terms of the 3-D environment\nrather than the 2-D distances that will hit the retina. Thus, whilst the distance between the\nfour cue/target locations was set to be equal in the reference frame of the coordinates of the\nsurface of the rendered environment, this resulted in unequal distances on the retinal image.\nMore specifically, the two horizontal distances are not identical on the screen (front = 7.0\ndeg, back = 4.4 deg) and the vertical distances between the target locations was 4 degrees of\nvisual angle. While highlighting this difference in visual angle, it should be borne in mind\nthat it was present in the Shadow and Non-Shadow conditions.\n3 Procedure\nEach participant completed two blocks of 32 practise trials and then 192 actual trials. Each\nblock contained equal numbers of valid, invalid-within, and invalid-between trials. On each\nShadows, objects, and attention 153\nFigure 1. On the left are the shaded regions without casting objects; on the right are the shaded regions\nwith casting objects. The relationship between cues and targets is depicted on the left for within-object\ncuing and on the right for between-object cuing. In the valid condition (not shown) a target would be\npresented in the same location as the cue.\ntrial the participant would be presented with a cue for 250 ms. The cue was a small square\nappearing in one of the four possible target locations. The use of this cue type was chosen\nbecause Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) showed that contrast outlines around the edge of a\nbounded region (like those typically used as cues in the Egly et al paradigm) can disrupt\nthe interpretation of that region as a shadow. After the cue there was a 200 ms gap before\nthe participants would be presented with one of two targets (an X or an N). The participant\nsimply had to report (using the X and N keys) which target had been presented. There was\nthen a 500 ms pause before the next trial started during which the scene remained visible.\nThe participant was not required to maintain fixation.\nThe results were analysed using a two factor repeated measures ANOVA. The reaction time\nwithin-vs-between object Cue Types yielded a significant difference (F(1,24) = 16.99, p <\n0.001) reflecting that targets presented on the same object as the cue were detected more\nrapidly. This within-vs-between object advantage did not interact with Shadow Type (F(1,24)\nThe accuracy data revealed no significant main effect of Cue Type (F < 1), Shadow Type (F\n`invalid within', and `invalid between' were 94.6%, 94%, and 95.1% for the non-shadow and\n93.6%, 94%, and 94.6% for the shadow condition, and their associated standard errors were\n154 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge\nFigure 2. Reaction time data for the valid, invalid-within, and invalid-between conditions in non-\nshadow (regions without casting objects) and shadow (regions with casting objects) conditions (error\nbars represent standard mean error).\n5 Interim discussion\nThe results of Experiment 1 revealed a clear replication of Egly et al's (1994) demonstration\nof the influence of perceptual organisation upon attention, indicating that shadows are\nrepresented by the visual system as `objects' in this context. That is, the results provide\nno evidence that shadows are treated as less salient aspects of visual structure than other\nbounded surfaces with respect to object-based attention. The Egly et al paradigm is, however,\njust one of a range of tasks that can be employed to illustrate the influence of visual structure\nShadar et al (2007) have, for instance, employed a two-item comparison task in which the\nparticipant has to report whether two items (which can either be located on the same or\non different objects) are the same or different. They found that when briefly presented\ntargets were presented on different `objects', participants were less accurate in making such\njudgements. Experiment 2 therefore seeks to explore whether the effects found in Experiment\n1 with the Egly et al cuing paradigm will be replicated with this `divided attention' object-\nbased paradigm. Finally, because shadows come in numerous potential forms, a different\nshadow type was used, to generalise the result to a shadow cast onto a different surface than\nthat to which the casting objects are attached (see Figure 3).\nThirty participants were recruited in exchange for payment or course credits. All participants\nhad normal or corrected to normal vision and were naive to the aims of the study. Participants'\nmales and 18 females.\nIdentical to Experiment 1.\nShadows, objects, and attention 155\nThe experiment employed a 2 by 2 within-participants design. The first factor, Object Type,\nhad two levels, within vs between object. On within-object trials the two to-be-compared\nletters appeared on the same shape, whereas on between-object trials the two letters\nappeared on different shapes. There were equal numbers of each level, and these were\nrandomly distributed across trials. The second factor, Shadow Type, had two levels: the\nregions either could or could not be readily interpreted as shadows. In line with Rensink and\nCavanagh (2004), this was achieved by removing the objects that cast the shadows. In contrast\nto Experiment 1, however, the shadows were cast from an object to which they were not\nattached, and the light source for the scene was visible (see Figure 3). In the non-shadow-like\ncondition, in addition to the removal of the objects responsible for casting the shadow, all\nother shadows in the scene were removed, to further reduce the likelihood of the shapes on\nwhich the targets were presented being interpreted as shadows. Shadow or non-shadow-like\nstimuli were presented in separate blocks, the order of which was counterbalanced across\nparticipants.\nIn the context of previous data highlighting that attention moves in perceived rather than\nretinal space (Robertson and Kim 1999) we were again faced with the problem of how to\ncontrol for the spatial separation between the targets. In Experiment Two a more stringent\ncriterion was adopted such that the within-object distances were longer than the between-\nobject distances. Given the potential ambiguity over how to control for the distance in these\n3-D displays, this change ensured that both in retinal and perceived spatial distance the\nwithin-object distances were in fact further apart, thus tending to reduce any object-based\nadvantage. The vertical (within object) separation between the targets was therefore fixed at\n5.75 degrees whilst the horizontal distances were 3.8 degrees at the top and 4.9 degrees at the\nbottom.\nFigure 3. Illustrating the means by which the identification of the regions as shadows was manipulated\nusing the casting objects, a light source, and other shadows in the scene.\n156 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge\nEach participant completed two blocks with 4 practise trials and then 192 actual trials.\nEach block contained equal numbers of within- and between-object trials. On each trial\nthe participant would be presented with two letters (`X X', `N X', or `N N') that could either\nboth be the same or different. The participant had to report as quickly and accurately as\npossible whether the letters were the same or different by pressing the `S' key if they were\nthe same and the `K' key if they were different. The two letters would either both be on the\nsame or on different shaded regions. Participants maintained fixation on a small white dot\nin the centre of the display. There was a 500 ms gap between trials, during which the scene\nremained visible.\nA 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA on the accuracy data revealed a significant effect of\nType (F = 0.851). There was also no effect of Shadow Type on the accuracy data (F < 1). The\nReaction Time data revealed no significant effects, (Shadow Type, F < 1; Object Type, F < 1).\nonly non-significant but in fact showed a trend in the opposite direction to that expected if\nshadows were ignored. The reaction times in the within and between conditions were 609\nFigure 4. Accuracy data for within- and between-object target pairs presented on shaded regions with\ncasting objects (shadows) or without casting objects (non-shadows).\n(1) It is apparent that the magnitude of the accuracy difference reported here is smaller than that\npreviously reported. For instance Ben-Shahar et al (2007, Experiment 1) found effect sizes in the order\nof 3\u00ad4%, whereas the difference across the two conditions here is only 1.15%. This difference could\nhave been caused by three factors. First, the `objects' used here are fuzzy and semi-transparent with\nthe background. Second, the spatial distances within the objects were made larger than those between\nobjects to ensure that any within-vs-between differences definitely reflected object-based effects.\nThird, the targets in Ben-Shahar et al were presented for very brief periods of time, followed by a mask,\nleading to much lower accuracies in general (86\u00ad76%, depending on their condition). This added\ndifficulty in processing the targets may well bring into clearer light the advantages accruing to target\npairings on the same objects and explain why the effect size here is so much smaller. A post-target\nmask was not employed here simply because it is uncertain how this might affect the interpretation of\nthe regions as shadows.\nShadows, objects, and attention 157\nThe representational status of shadows was explored using two object-based attention\nparadigms. The results provide consistent evidence that increasing the extent to which a\nregion could be interpreted as a shadow had no effect on the extent to which that region\ncould be selected as an `object' of attention. This study was motivated by the mixed picture\nregarding the role of shadows, which are often actively utilized, in the visual system in the\ncontext of localising the objects that cast them but play a somewhat ambiguous role in\ninfluencing the recognition of the objects casting them. More specifically, this study was\nmotivated by visual search data highlighting that access to form information is less efficient\nwhen that form can be interpreted as a shadow (Rensink and Cavanagh 2004).\nAt first glance the current result and that of Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) could appear in\ncontradiction--in that whilst their result suggests that shadows have a lower representational\nstatus within the visual system, the current result suggests that the interpretation of a\nstimulus as a shadow does not influence the preferential allocation of attention within\nthat region. These two findings may, however, tap very different levels of representation. It\nmay be that shadows have to be segmented as distinct regions of space at the early level at\nwhich within-vs-between object advantages operate, in order that visual form discrimination\nmechanisms can then tag what should be `discounted' from further processing.\nThe possibility that shadows are accessible as units of attentional selection exactly\nbecause their differential status requires that they have to be segmented as distinct areas of\nspace is also consistent with Lovell et al's (2009) argument that shadows are not `discounted'\nper se but rather that shadows are represented at distinct coarse spatial scale. Lovell et\nal's interpretation is based on the fact that although they could replicate Rensink and\nCavanagh's finding of less efficient visual search for an `odd one out' shadow when the\ndifference between this and the other shadows was more subtle, they actually found more\nrapid visual search performance for stimuli interpretable as shadows when the difference\nwas larger (for example, a 90 degree, rather than just a 30 degree, difference in orientation).\nLovell et al argue that visual search is faster for shadows with large differences because they\nare rapidly identified and segmented but that less efficient search occurs for more subtle\ndiscriminations because the tagging of an area as a shadow results in it being represented in\na coarse manner.\nIf shadows can influence attention but are represented in a distinct manner to other\nobjects (either in terms of an active `discounting' or being represented at a coarser spatial\nscale), then this clearly returns us to the question of whether it is appropriate to talk\nabout `object'-based attention effects. This issue was raised most clearly by Jon Driver\nand colleagues more than 10 years ago (Driver et al 2001) when they argued that so called\nobject-based attention phenomena in fact reflected the influence of segmentation upon\nattention rather than an influence of objects per se. This distinction (between segmentation\nand objecthood) itself, however, raises the question of how exactly the segmentation and\ngrouping of sensory input can be defined and understood separately from the construction\nand recognition of objects. Without attempting to answer this question in full, the current\nresult does potentially offer an illustrative example regarding how this distinction could\nbecome manifest. To reiterate, whilst regions identified as shadows do not seem to have the\nsame representational status as other objects (cf Rensink and Cavanagh 2004; Lovell et al\n2009), they seem to nevertheless remain segmented as distinct regions such that within-vs-\nbetween `object' attentional effects are still evident. A final important fact to keep in mind\nis that the two object-based attention paradigms used here do not cover the full range of\nparadigms operationalized as measures of object-based attention. Multiple object tracking\nis an important case in point, and it remains an open question in general whether these\n158 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge\ndifferent object-based phenomena actually reflect a common form of attentional selection,\nand whether this selection operates upon the same objects.\n"
