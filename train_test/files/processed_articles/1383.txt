    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Policymakers have focused primarily on increasing Medicaid reimbursement\nrates to increase physicians' participation in Medicaid, although physicians often complain\nof payment delays and other administrative burdens associated with Medicaid. Linking\nstate-level data on average reimbursement times to the 2004\u00ad05 Community Tracking\nStudy Physician Survey, this study examines how Medicaid reimbursement time affects\nphysicians' willingness to accept Medicaid patients. Delays in reimbursement can offset\nthe effects of high Medicaid fees, thereby lowering participation to levels that are closer to\nthose in states with relatively low rates. Increasing these rates may be insufficient to in-\ncrease physicians' participation unless accompanied by reductions in administrative bur-\nIncreasing physicians' participation in medicaid is a policy con-\ncern of long standing. Surveys show that about half of physicians accept all\nnew Medicaid patients into their practices, compared with more than 70 per-\ncent for privately insured or Medicare patients.1 Moreover, trends over the past de-\ncade indicate that participation in Medicaid is declining for many physicians, in\npart because of declining practice incomes and changes in practice arrangements.2\nLow Medicaid reimbursement rates relative to those of Medicare and private\npayers are usually considered to be the primary reason for low physician partici-\npation in Medicaid. Medicaid fee levels vary considerably across states, and re-\nsearch has consistently shown that Medicaid participation by physicians is higher\nin states with higher fees than in states with lower fees.3 Thus, increasing Medic-\naid fees is one of the main tools that state policymakers use to increase physicians'\nparticipation in Medicaid, in order to improve access for enrollees.\nM e d i c a i d P a y m e n t\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 1 7\nPeterCunningham(pcunningham@hschange.org)isaseniorfellowattheCenterforStudyingHealthSystem\nChangeinWashington,D.C.AnnO'Malleyisaseniorhealthresearcherthere.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Administrative burden includes\npayment delays, rejection of claims because either the billing form was completed\nincorrectly or the physician was not able to verify the patient's Medicaid eligibil-\nity, preauthorization requirements for certain services, and complex rules and\nregulations on how claims are to be filed.4 Indeed, although inadequate reimburse-\nment is the reason most frequently cited by physicians for limiting Medicaid pa-\ntients (cited by 84 percent of physicians), the majority of physicians also cite con-\ncerns about paperwork (70 percent) and billing delays (65 percent) as important\nreasons.5 Another national survey found that concerns about administrative bur-\nden caused physicians to limit their acceptance of new Medicaid patients to a\nmuch greater extent than for Medicare or privately insured patients.6\nNevertheless, despite a sizable research literature on the effects of Medicaid fee\nlevels, there is virtually no research on how Medicaid administrative burden var-\nies across states, and how these variations influence physician participation. One\nof the few relevant studies found extensive variation across states in pediatricians'\nperceptions of paperwork burdens that were also correlated with their levels of\nMedicaid participation.7 However, it was unknown whether these differences in\nperceptions of administrative burden were consistent with actual experiences,\nsuch as differences in length of time for payment and denial rates for claims.\nThis study links state-level data on Medicaid claims experiences with respect\nto one important measure of administrative burden--length of time for reim-\nbursement--with physician survey data that include measures of Medicaid par-\nticipation. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of variation in average\nreimbursement times across states on physicians' decisions to accept Medicaid\npatients. In addition, we compare the effects on physician participation in Medic-\naid of reimbursement times versus reimbursement rates. In particular, we deter-\nmine whether slow reimbursement offsets any gains in participation that might be\nachieved through increasing fee levels.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data. The 2004\u00ad05 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey is the\nmain source of data for this study.8 The survey is based on sixty randomly selected\ncommunities, defined as Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) or non-\nmetro parts of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Areas. Sampled physi-\ncians within each of the sixty communities include MDs and DOs who spent at least\ntwenty hours per week in patient care. All interviews were conducted by telephone,\nwith an overall response rate of 52 percent. The total sample includes about 6,600\nphysicians.\nn Methods. The survey includes questions ascertaining the extent of each physi-\ncian's involvement with Medicaid patients (based on percentage of total practice\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Based on these questions, we included the following dependent variables: (1)\nthe probability of having any Medicaid patients (based on whether or not they de-\nrived any Medicaid revenue); (2) the probability of accepting no new Medicaid pa-\ntients; and (3) the probability of accepting all new Medicaid patients.\nn Average reimbursement time in state. The primary independent variable of\ninterest is a state-level measure of average reimbursement time for physicians treat-\ning Medicaid patients. Average reimbursement time for Medicaid payment in the\nstate is computed based on claims records maintained by AthenaHealth Inc., which\ncontracts with physician practices in thirty-three states to provide claims process-\ning for Medicaid as well as commercial insurance. These data are unique in that they\nare based on a uniform and standardized system of claims processing that largely ne-\ngates differences in billing systems and billing practices between physicians that\nmay contribute to differences in reimbursement time.\nTo compute average reimbursement time for Medicaid payment in the state,\ndata on days in accounts receivable were aggregated across all Medicaid claims\nwithin each state. Only fee-for-service payments were used to compute reim-\nbursement times. Days in accounts receivable reflect time between when a claim\nwas submitted by AthenaHealth and when payment by Medicaid was made. If a\nclaim was initially denied by the state Medicaid agency and resubmitted--or de-\nnied and resubmitted numerous times--it is considered a single claim for the pur-\nposes of computing days in accounts receivable.\nDays in accounts receivable were computed as the sum of total charge days (the\namount of the claim multiplied by the days in accounts receivable) for all claims\nfor a physician's practice, divided by the average dollar amount per day of all\nclaims for that physician's practice. This is a common method for computing days\nin accounts receivable, which also has the added benefit of adjusting for differ-\nences in reimbursement time between physicians' practices as a result of differ-\nences in claim amounts (that is, larger claims may be more complex, are more\nlikely to be initially denied, and therefore may take longer to adjudicate than\nsmaller claims).\nState-level measures of average reimbursement time for Medicaid for 2006 were\nlinked to sampled physicians in twenty-one of the thirty-six CTS states for which\nthere are a large number of claims processed by AthenaHealth.9 These include\nmost of the largest states such as New York, California, Texas, Florida, Illinois,\nPennsylvania, and Michigan, as well as regional representation in the Northeast,\nSouth, Midwest, and West. Excluded states are those for which AthenaHealth\nprovides no Medicaid claims processing, or contracts with too few physicians to\nproduce reliable measures of reimbursement time. About 4,900 of the 6,600 physi-\ncians in the survey are in the twenty-one states that have a measure of average re-\nimbursement time; they represent the sample for this study.\nM e d i c a i d P a y m e n t\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 1 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although average reimbursement\ntimes within a state may change from year to year, the relative position of states\nfor both years.10 Because the rank-ordering of states is likely to be more accurate\nfor 2004 and 2005 than the actual time amount, most of the analysis was based on\na dichotomous measure that reflects practices in the 50 percent of states with\nabove-average reimbursement times and practices in the other 50 percent of states\nwith below-average reimbursement times.\nn Medicaid reimbursement rates. Medicaid reimbursement rates are based on\na state survey of Medicaid fees conducted in 2003, the latest year for which these\ndata are available.11 The measure used in this study reflects a weighted average of the\nratio of Medicaid to Medicare fees for thirty-three services for each of the twenty-\none states.12 Medicaid fees relative to Medicare were used because Medicare rates\nare adjusted for local practice costs; therefore, they serve as a benchmark for local\nmarkets. Only fee-for-service rates were included in the measure. More recent data\nfor the years of the survey (2004\u00ad05) are not available. As with reimbursement\ntimes, the relative position of states is consistent from year to year. Most of the anal-\nysis was based on a dichotomous measure that reflects location in the half of states\nwith the highest reimbursement rates and location in the other half of states with\nthe lowest reimbursement rates.\nn Analysis. Because reimbursement times and Medicaid fees may be correlated\nwith other factors affecting physicians' decisions to accept Medicaid patients, logis-\ntic regression analysis was used to examine the independent effects of reimburse-\nment times and fee levels on Medicaid participation.13 Physician characteristics con-\ntrolled for in the analysis include physicians' sex, race/ethnicity, years in practice,\nspecialty (medical, surgical, primary care), practice type and size (solo or small\ngroup practice, medium and large group practice, HMO practice, hospital-based\npractice, clinic, and other), practice income, percentage of revenue from capitation,\nand owner versus employee of practice.\nImportant health care market variables controlled for in the analysis include the\npercentage uninsured and the percentage of the population enrolled in Medicaid\nin the community, using data from the 2003 CTS Household Survey.14 These mea-\nsures control for both the relative size of the Medicaid population in the commu-\nnity and the potential opportunity costs to physicians of treating Medicaid pa-\ntients relative to other paying patients (that is, acceptance of Medicaid might be\nhigher if there are fewer higher-paying patients in the area relative to Medicaid pa-\ntients). Because the survey did not distinguish between acceptance of Medicaid\nmanaged care and fee-for-service patients, we controlled for state variation in\nMedicaid managed care penetration rates, based on 2004 data from the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Average\nreimbursement times for Medicaid varied considerably across states in 2006, from a\nlow of 36.9 adjusted days in Kansas to a high of 114.6 days in Pennsylvania (Exhibit\n1). Reimbursement times for Medicaid were longer on average than reimbursement\ntimes for commercial insurers in every state, although the size of the disparities\nranged from small (Kansas, Ohio) to large (Pennsylvania, Illinois).

Similarly, there were no differences in other\ncharacteristics of physicians between the overall CTS survey sample and the analy-\nsis sample.\nCompared with physicians in states with relatively slow reimbursement times,\nphysicians in the states with the fastest reimbursement times were more likely to\nhave some Medicaid revenue, more likely to be accepting all new Medicaid pa-\ntients, and less likely to be accepting no or only some new Medicaid patients (Ex-\nhibit 2). Other physician characteristics were largely similar between states with\nhigh and low reimbursement times, except for managed care measures: physicians\nin states with slow reimbursement were more likely than their peers in states\nwith fast reimbursement to be practicing in health maintenance organizations\n(HMOs) and to obtain a higher percentage of practice revenue from capitation.\nExhibit 2 also indicates some correlation between average reimbursement\ntimes and Medicaid reimbursement rates. In general, physicians in states with fast\nreimbursement times also tended to have higher Medicaid fee levels than those in\nstates with slow reimbursement times.\nn Effects of reimbursement time on Medicaid participation. Overall, average\nreimbursement times had no independent effect on physician Medicaid participa-\ntion when accounting for differences in Medicaid fees (Exhibit 3). When Medicaid\nfees were excluded from the logistic regression models (model 1), faster payment\nwas associated with greater Medicaid participation, including a greater probability\nof having any Medicaid patients, a greater probability of accepting all new Medicaid\npatients, and a lower probability of accepting no new Medicaid patients. However,\nmost of the association between payment times and participation occurred among\nspecialists. When the analysis took fee levels into account (model 2), virtually all of\nthe differences in Medicaid participation levels between physicians in slow- versus\nfast-payment states disappeared, including for specialists. Consistent with previous\nstudies, Medicaid participation levels were much higher among physicians in states\nwith relatively high fee levels than in those with low fee levels. These results are\nconsistent across all three measures of Medicaid participation as well as across\nprimary care physicians and specialists.\nn Slow reimbursement offsets high Medicaid fees. Although differences in\nreimbursement times have no independent effect on Medicaid participation, the ef-\nfects of reimbursement time on Medicaid participation could depend on reimburse-\nment levels. For example, since states with high fee levels also tended to have faster\npayment times, it might have been the combination of both high fees and relatively\nrapid payment that induced more physicians to participate. Conversely, physicians\nmight have been less bothered by slow payment when fees were sufficiently high,\nbut they might have been even more reluctant to accept Medicaid patients when\nlow fees were combined with slow payment.\nTo examine this, we compared four groups of physicians based on different\ncombinations of fee levels and reimbursement times: physicians in states with (1)\nM e d i c a i d P a y m e n t\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 2 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For example, 64 percent of physicians\nwere accepting all new Medicaid patients in states with both high fees and fast\npayment. However, when high fees were combined with slow payment, the per-\ncentage accepting all new Medicaid patients decreased to 50.9 percent. Reim-\nbursement time appeared to make less of a difference in states with relatively low\nMedicaid fees, because the differential in acceptance rates between fast- and\nslow-payment states was only about five percentage points (48.4 in low-fee/fast-\npayment states versus 43.2 percent in low-fee/slow-payment states). Similar re-\nsults are shown for the other measures of Medicaid participation: participation\nwas highest among physicians in states with both the highest fees and fast reim-\nbursement times, but significantly lower when high fees were combined with rel-\natively slow payment. These patterns are similar for primary care physicians and\nspecialists, although the combined effects of time and fees appeared to be stronger\nfor specialists, especially for measures related to acceptance of new patients.\nM e d i c a i d P a y m e n t\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 2 5\nSummary Of Predicted Probabilities From Logistic Regressions, Study Of Physicians'\nAll physicians\nPrimary care\nphysicians Specialists\nPercent with any Medicaid patients\nHigh-fee/fast-payment states\nHigh-fee/slow-payment states\nLow-fee/fast-payment states\nLow-fee/slow-payment states\nPercent accepting no new Medicaid patients\nHigh-fee/fast-payment states\nHigh-fee/slow-payment states\nLow-fee/fast-payment states\nLow-fee/slow-payment states\nPercent accepting all new Medicaid patients\nHigh-fee/fast-payment states\nHigh-fee/slow-payment states\nLow-fee/fast-payment states\nLow-fee/slow-payment states\nSOURCES: Medicaid reimbursement times are based on data from AthenaHealth Inc.

Although Medicaid payment\nrates were consistently the most important indicator of Medicaid acceptance, the\neffects of payment rates on participation were diminished when high fees were\naccompanied by relatively slow payment.\nn Study limitations. Some limitations with this analysis should be noted. First,\nthe measure of physicians' participation in Medicaid did not distinguish between\nmanaged care and fee-for-service patients, so the results pertaining to fee levels and\nreimbursement time (which includes fee-for-service only) might reflect in part cor-\nrelation with Medicaid managed care that was not accounted for in the analysis. The\nability to distinguish between acceptance of Medicaid fee-for-service and managed\ncare patients in the analysis would have been useful, but it was not possible with the\nsurvey data. To address this issue, we controlled for physician practice in an HMO,\nthe amount of capitation received from managed care (commercial and public), as\nwell as Medicaid managed care enrollment rates in the state.\nAlso, the results for the combined effect of Medicaid fees and payment times\nwere based on a relatively small number of states (four to six) in each of the four\ngroups. Thus, the results for a particular group (for example, states with high\nfees/fast payment) might reflect other unique aspects of these states or of one or\ntwo large states within each group.\nAlthough this was beyond the scope of this analysis, we were not able to iden-\ntify literature explaining the reasons for state variation in Medicaid reimburse-\nment times, or why payment times in Medicaid continue to lag behind those of\ncommercial payers. Starting in October 2003, state Medicaid agencies were re-\nquired, as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n(HIPAA), to accept electronic claims for Medicaid using standardized formats,\nwhich was intended to speed claims processing and reduce errors.\nD a t a W a t c h\n\"Greater use of electronic claims processing using standardized\nformats should increase the speed of payment.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Complex rules and guidelines in Medicaid regarding documenta-\ntion for claims, the use of detailed service and procedure codes, and patient eligi-\nbility determination mean that many claims are still likely to be initially denied.\nAlso, preventing fraud and waste in Medicaid is still a major concern that may\ncontribute to longer payment times. For example, the CMS has developed a new\nmeasuring system--the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program--to\nmeasure improper Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program\n(SCHIP) payments in a subset of states each year, beginning in 2007. Such efforts\nto reduce errors and fraud in Medicaid payments may slow payment to providers\nby increasing the number of claims that are initially denied, which could offset any\ngains from increased use of electronic claims processing. In addition, some states\nmay purposefully defer payments on some Medicaid claims to the next budgetary\ncycle or fiscal year because of state budget cuts or shortfalls, especially during\neconomic downturns.\nn Policy implications. Improving access to physicians for Medicaid enrollees is\na concern among state policymakers, and increasing fee levels for physicians is often\nthe preferred method for achieving increased access. Although low fees are one of\nthe primary reasons discouraging physicians from participating in Medicaid, other\nfactors--including payment times and administrative burden--are also important.\nIn fact, the results of this study strongly suggest that higher fees will not have the de-\nsired effect on access if it takes physicians several months or longer to be reim-\nbursed. In some states, reducing payment delays and administrative burdens may\nhave more of an impact on access than modest increases in fee levels. In sum, there is\nno one-size-fits-all solution to increasing Medicaid patients' access to physicians.\nEach state will need to assess whether to target limited resources at fee increases,\nimprove claims processing systems, or reduce other administrative burdens that\nresult in barriers to physicians' participation in Medicaid.\nThisresearchwasfundedbytheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundationthroughitssupportoftheCenterforStudying\nHealthSystemChange.TheauthorsthankMelissaLukowski,NancyBrown,JohnHallock,MichaelYun,and\nMinnaChanofAthenaHealthInc.foruseofthecompany'sMedicaidclaimsdataaswellastheirassistanceinusing\nthedata.TheyalsothankAnneCherlowandJamesVerdierofMathematicaPolicyResearchInc.,andPatricia\nMacTaggartofGeorgeWashingtonUniversityfortheirreviewofanearlydraftofthismanuscript.GennaCohen\noftheCenterforStudyingHealthSystemChangeprovidedvaluableresearchassistance,andHelenaBacellarof\nSocialandScientificSystemsInc.providedexcellentprogrammingassistance.\nM e d i c a i d P a y m e n t\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e w 2 7\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Service-specific\nweights were defined as the share of Medicaid physician spending for that service in each state, based on\nservice-specific spending data from the CMS.\n13. A problem that arises when state-level variables are merged to person-level data and included as inde-\npendent variables in regression analysis is that the disturbances are correlated, which may cause the stan-\ndard errors to be biased downward. See B.R. Moulton, \"An Illustration of a Pitfall in Estimating the Effects\nmost of the important results in this analysis associated with state-level fee and payment time variables\nhave a high level of statistical significance (0.01), so we do not expect the results or conclusions to be\nseriously affected.\n14.

The regression analysis was also run using linear versions of the state-level fee and payment time variables\n(that is, not collapsed into two groups). The results are consistent with the results using binary versions of\nthese variables. However, we focus on the binary versions of these variables because it facilitates the com-\nputation of regression probabilities (that is, reflects the average for \"low\" and \"high\" states). Also, given the\nrelatively small number of state observations (twenty-one states), binary measures reduce the risk that\ncertain \"outlier\" states would drive the results.\n16. L.
