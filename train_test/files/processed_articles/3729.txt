According to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), AMR\nthreatens the very core of modern medicine\nand the sustainability of an effective, global\npublic health response to the enduring threat\nfrom infectious diseases.1 Deciding whether\nto use antibiotics in a responsible way and\nthe proliferation of multi-resistant micro-\norganisms defy current global public health\napproaches. Such a decision entails in-depth\nbioethical analysis that can and should be\napplied at both clinical and global public\nhealth levels.\nOur research protocol, entitled ``Toward\na bioethical framework for antibiotic use,\nantimicrobial resistance and for empirically\ndesigning ethically robust strategies to\nprotect human health: a research protocol'',\naims to develop a bioethical framework for\nantibiotic use and for designing ethically\nrobust strategies to protect and promote\nhuman health against AMR in community\nand hospital settings. This research is part of\na larger project of the Instituto de Bioe\n\u00b4 tica,\nUniversidade Cato\n\u00b4 lica Portuguesa, entitled\n``Developing a Public Health Bioethical\nFramework for Antibiotic Use and for\nDesigning Ethically Robust Strategies to\nProtect and Promote Health from AMR''.\nThe project objective is to address this\nbioethical and societal issue and investigate\nhow decision-making processes for the use\nof antibiotics occur in community and hos-\npital settings.\nThe project is currently in its initial stages\nand this article aims to present the state of\nthe art, background and research protocol\nof this study. Because this is a study proto-\ncol, we only report on planned and ongoing\nresearch studies. It is our conviction that,\nin the future, the results will be useful\nfor tailoring ethically framed strategies to\ndecrease the problem of AMR and help\nto protect and promote health. This is of\nforemost relevance as the WHO has recog-\nnized that without harmonized and imme-\ndiate action at global scale, the world is\nheading towards a post-antibiotic era in\nwhich common infections could once again\nbe deadly.1\nAntimicrobial resistance from a\nbioethical perspective: the state\nof the art\nAMR is a challenging global and public\nhealth issue that gives rise to several con-\ncerns, challenges, considerations and strate-\ngies. Much emphasis has been placed on the\nimplications for human health of increasing\nantibiotic resistance in pathogens, which is\nowing to imprudent antibiotic prescription\nand consumption as well as to widespread\nand common use of antibiotics in agricul-\nture.2\u00ad4 However, more attention is needed\non the decision-making processes underly-\ning these practices.\nHumanity is facing the very real possibil-\nity of a post-antibiotic era.5\u00ad8 Urgent action\nis therefore needed to maintain the effect of\nantibiotics9 and ensure equity of access to\nthis type of medication. From a global and\npublic health perspective, while developed\nsocieties are struggling with problems\nrelated to AMR, less-developed societies\nstill face the paucity and lack of access to\nantibiotics.\nAMR poses particularly important chal-\nlenges for human health. The development\nof a bioethical framework for antibiother-\napy calls for careful analysis of the ethics\n``behind the scenes''. Responsibility is of\nutmost complexity in this context as it lies\nwith individuals, healthcare professionals,\nmanagers, policy makers and health sys-\ntems; all stakeholders are simultaneously\nvulnerable to and responsible for AMR.\nSeveral global and public ethical issues\nhave been raised about the use of antibiotics\nand AMR with respect to human health. For\ninstance, according to Leibovici et al.10, a\ncentral question can be posed, namely,\nwhether we could and should consider bene-\nfits in the distant future for unidentified\npatients as being more important than bene-\nfits in the near future for an identified\npatient. This must be discussed within a\nbroader ethical debate by considering\ndiverse ethical theories, principles and\nvalues. Using Kass's11 definition, bioethics\ncan help healthcare professionals and public\npolicy makers to recognize the ethical dilem-\nmas surrounding antibiotic use as well as\nstrategies to reduce the extent of AMR.\nCurrently, owing to diverse reasons (e.g.,\nAMR, economic hardship, population\nageing), physicians must sometimes choose\nbetween the welfare of an individual patient\nand a healthcare system directive to restrict\nantibiotics.12 Preventing harm, preserving\nthe public good and protecting individual\nliberty can conflict with each other because\ninfectious diseases not only threaten indi-\nvidual health but also the welfare of other\nhuman beings.7 The lack of consensus on an\nethical framework makes these decisions\nmore difficult, transforming physicians'\ndecision whether to prescribe antibiotics\nand/or design strategies for fighting AMR\ninto a complex phenomenon.\nThe various components, values, prin-\nciples and theories behind clinical and\nethical decisions become manifest in dif-\nferent ways with respect to AMR. This\ndepends on the degree of uncertainty sur-\nrounding the consequences of antibiotics'\nuse for human health and has implications\nfor the moral intensity of the ethical deci-\nsions to be undertaken. Interventions aimed\nat promoting the proper and prudent use of\nantibiotics, using an empirically based\nand bioethically sound framework, should\nencompass `upstream' policy-relevant\nactions, both within and outside the health-\ncare system. By doing so, physicians will be\nable to act more objectively when deciding\nwhether to prescribe antibiotics.\nWhy a bioethical framework\nfor AMR?\nAMR is a challenging global and public\nhealth issue, raising several concerns, chal-\nCompelling questions from the domains of\nglobal, population and public health ethics\nand the bioethics of infectious disease will\ntherefore be posed. Responsibility, in this\ncontext, is of utmost complexity; all parties\nare simultaneously vulnerable to and\nThe use of antibiotics leads to the\nincrease of AMR. This has implications for\nconsumer safety18 and health, and consti-\ntutes a global and public health issue, chal-\nHealth Assembly passed a new global\naction plan on AMR, and the topic was\ndiscussed as a priority for policy actions\nAMR is spreading rapidly in developed\nsocieties worldwide, making it one of the\nmost serious threats to human, public and\nglobal health. The WHO6 has stated that a\npost-antibiotic era is a very real possibility.\nHence, urgent actions are needed to maintain\nthe effect of antibiotics.9 In contrast, under-\ndeveloped countries still do not have equity\nof access to antibiotics, which maintains the\nhigh risk of death owing to common infec-\ntious diseases in these countries.\nHerna\nAntibiotic consumption is a major driver\nof AMR and there is large cross-country\nvariation in AMR.2 This is mainly owing to\ndifferent patterns of antibiotic prescription\nand consumption. Indeed, prescribing style\nis an important source of variation, not only\nPrescribing style involves the subjective ten-\ndency of physicians to be more or less\nVariations in the prescription style some-\ntimes suggest poor clinical practices and can\ncontribute to the inadequate use of health-\ncare resources. Resource allocation is a key\nethical issue in health organizations and\nsystems. Interventions aimed at promoting\nthe rational use (clinically and ethically\nsound) of antibiotics should encompass\nactions at the policy-making level. This\nhighlights a need for common clinically\nand ethically sound frameworks, not only\nat individual but also at public, global and\npolicy levels.\nBioethics owes its development to aware-\nness of the seriousness and magnitude of\nethical issues or problems that no society\ncan ignore, no matter its level of techno-\nlogical development. Ethical principles, such\nas individual responsibility (autonomy),\nsocial responsibility (solidarity), vulnerabil-\nity, integrity, privacy, reciprocity and equity\nof resource allocation must be pulled\ntogether to simultaneously ensure individual\ninterests, societal welfare and the sustain-\nPopulation and individual-level\napproaches have been used extensively to\nexplain variations in prescription styles and\nconsumption. However, little is known\nabout any bioethical framework behind or\nwithin the decision-making processes for\nprescribing and using antibiotics and for\npreventing AMR.\nThe present bioethical framework will\nencompass and integrate two models: global\nbioethics and ethical decision-making. In the\nfirst model, the conceptual global bioethics\nproblem of AMR is built in three steps.\nFirst, AMR is a global bioethics problem\nbecause of its following characteristics:\n(i) worldwide scale, (ii) interconnectedness,\n(iii) persistence, (iv) general scope and\n(v) need for global action.17 Second, AMR\nis considered a bioethical problem because it\nhas specific relevance for health and human\nlife and poses normative challenges. Finally,\nthe problem of AMR has three characteris-\ntics: ambiguity, situation and horizon.17 The\ncerned with ethical decision-making in\napplied to healthcare settings. The following\nrelevant features will be addressed: (i)\nawareness of the ethical and moral dimen-\nsions posed by the use of antibiotics; (ii)\nethical and moral judgements associated\nwith the use of antibiotics in the provision\nof human healthcare; (iii) the main ethical\nrisks associated with development of\nstrategies to fight antibiotic resistance of\nbacteria; (iv) whether there is the intention\nto prioritize ethical and moral consider-\nations when addressing the problems posed\nby AMR; and (v) whether the actual behav-\niour displayed in the use of antibiotics is\nethically grounded and sound.\nMoving from a bioethical\nconceptual framework\ntowards an empirical one:\nthe research protocol\nThis research protocol presents a conceptual\nmodel leading to the formulation of an\nempirically based bioethics framework for\nantibiotic use, AMR and for designing\nethically robust strategies to protect human\nhealth.\nObjectives\nThe main objective of the research project is\nto develop a bioethical framework for\nantibiotic use and for designing ethically\nrobust strategies to protect and promote\nhuman health against AMR in community\nand hospital settings. To empirically study\nthis global and public health issue, we\ndefined the following specific objectives: (i)\nTo understand the ethical rationale and\ndecision-making processes behind anti-\nbiotics' use in community and hospital care\nsettings; (ii) to identify the main ethical\nissues associated with AMR in these set-\ntings; (iii) to evaluate ethically different,\nscientifically sound strategies to fight AMR\nand (iv) to comprehend micro-meso-macro\nlinkages of the decision-making processes\nconcerning AMR in human healthcare\nprovision.\nThe following research questions will\ncomplement our bioethical analysis and\nframework: Can post-modern societies\ninfringe upon individual rights to promote\nthe common good and public health when a\nperson is diagnosed with a multidrug-\nresistant infectious disease? When they are\ndiagnosed, should individuals be allowed to\nself-determine whether they are too infectious\nto use public transport (e.g., airplanes,\nsubways, trains, buses)? What procedures\nshould be applied when individuals are\ndiagnosed with new diseases of unknown or\nuncertain contagiousness? How should we\ndeal with patients and next-of-kin when they\ndecide not to take prescriptions correctly,\nthereby allowing dangerous pathogens to\nmutate and become resistant to antibiotics?\nWhat implications exist and what burdens\nare likely to result if health practitioners\nand policy makers propose targeting public\nhealth interventions only to certain groups?\nTo achieve the main objective of this\nproject, diverse research methods and tech-\nniques will be used and operationalized.\nBecause this manuscript refers to the research\nprotocol of the abovementioned project,\nwhich is currently in its initial stages, no\ndata and no findings will be presented here.\nWe foresee that, based on our findings and use\nof a comprehensive, integrative and evidence-\nbased approach, we will develop a step-by-\nstep bioethical framework for antibiotic use\nand the design of strategies to decrease AMR.\nThis will entail the analysis and interpretation\nof various approaches from several bioethical\nand ethical theories, including deontological\nand consequentialist approaches, and the\nimplications of uncertainty in relation to\nthese approaches.\nMethods\nA mixed-methods approach will be imple-\nmented to achieve the main objective of this\nresearch project. Therefore, quantitative\nand qualitative research methods, tech-\nniques and instruments will be combined\nto gather empirical data and information on\nthe perceptions, attitudes and practices of\nprimary and hospital care physicians con-\ncerning the following aspects: (i) antibiotics\nconsumption; (ii) antibiotics prescription;\n(iii) AMR; (iv) clinical pathways associated\nwith the diagnosis and treatment of multi-\nresistant infections; (v) evidence-based\nstrategies to reduce the problem of resist-\nance; (vi) bioethical frameworks of anti-\nbiotics use; and (vii) bioethical frameworks\nfor designing strategies to decrease AMR.\nThis project will include the following\nsubstudies: (I) Systematic literature review\non bioethics, ethical issues and antibiotics\nconsumption, prescription and resistance.\n(II) Systematic literature review on strate-\ngies to decrease the problem of AMR. (III)\nEmpirical studies embracing both quantita-\ntive (survey of healthcare professionals'\nattitudes) and qualitative (documentary\nanalysis of existing guidelines and protocols\nin Portuguese hospitals) approaches, includ-\ning use of the Delphi technique to build an\nexpert consensus on empirically and bioethi-\ncally framed practices for protecting and\npromoting human health in the face of\nAMR. (IV) Development of a bioethical\nframework for antibiotic use in the\nHerna\nprovision of human healthcare, by integrat-\ning substudies (I) and (III). (V)\nDevelopment of a bioethical framework\nfor the design of strategies to face the\nproblem of AMR.\nCurrently, abstract screening for substu-\ndies I and II (i.e., the two systematic reviews)\nis underway and the first results are expected\nsummary of the reviewed materials will be\npresented in tabular form complemented by\na narrative description. The results will be\nclassified into the main conceptual cate-\ngories, which will be obtained during extrac-\ntion of the results. We anticipate that the\nresults of these studies will enable the devel-\nopment of instruments for data collection to\nbe used for substudy III (empirical study\nusing a mixed-methods approach).\nAll substudies will follow the correspond-\ning EQUATOR Network reporting guide-\nlines. It is our conviction that these studies\nwill yield relevant data and information,\nwhich will be useful to tailor the develop-\nment of a bioethical framework of antibiotic\nuse in human healthcare provision (sub-\nstudy IV) and ethically framed strategies to\ndecrease the problem of AMR and to pro-\ntect and promote health (substudy V).\nConcluding remarks\nAMR is a challenging global and public\nhealth issue that gives rise to numerous\nbioethical challenges, considerations and\nstrategies. Deciding whether to use antibio-\ntics in a responsible way and the prolifer-\nation of multidrug-resistant microorganisms\ndefy current public health approaches.\nThis article reflects the research protocol\nof a project aimed at developing a bioethical\nframework for antibiotic use and for design-\ning ethically robust strategies to protect and\npromote human health against AMR in\ncommunity and hospital settings. Based on\nour ongoing data collection and future\nfindings and using a comprehensive,\nintegrative and evidence-based approach, a\nstep-by-step bioethical framework will be\ndeveloped for (i) responsible use of anti-\nbiotics in healthcare contexts and (ii) design\nof strategies to decrease AMR. This will\nentail the analysis and interpretation of\nvarious approaches from several bioethical\nand ethical theories, including deontological\nand consequentialist approaches, and the\nimplications of uncertainty with respect to\nthese approaches.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research protocol received no specific grant\nfrom any funding agency in the public, commer-\ncial, or not-for-profit sectors.
