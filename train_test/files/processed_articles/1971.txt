Thus, further elucidation of how these rela-\ntively simple measures are associated with disease remains\nimportant.\nThe present study describes the association between WC and\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP), with a focus on how these rela-\ntions may vary by race and sex, using a large nationally repre-\nsentative sample of young adults in the United States. We focus\non SBP in the present study because, although associations\nhave been shown to vary by age,3 many studies have shown SBP\nto be more important than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with\nrespect to health risk,4\u00ad9 and also possibly more responsive than\nDBP to changes in modifiable risk factors such as exercise, diet,\nand weight loss.10 WC has been shown to add to the prediction\nof visceral fat beyond measurements of BMI.11,12 Visceral adi-\npose tissue is an independent predictor of the metabolic syn-\ndrome in both men and women,13 and has also been found to\nadd to the prediction of hypertension.14,15 Following Tybor et\nal.,16 we use statistical partialling to remove the effect of BMI\nfrom the association between WC and SBP. WC partialled for\nBMI reflects WC independent of overall body size, and thus,\nby definition, must reflect body shape or body fat distribution.\nWe also allow for the possibility that these associations may be\nnonlinear. Examination of these questions in this manner may\nprovide more precise information about the pathophysiology\nunderlying high blood pressure and also further guide risk\nstratification in clinical practice.\nMethods\nParticipants. The present study uses data from the Add Health\nstudy, a nationally representative sample of ~15,000 young adults\nthat was designed to assess the effects of health-related behaviors\nBackground\nAdiposity, or more specifically, underlying body fat distribution, has\nbeen associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), and it has been\nsuggested that these associations vary between whites and blacks,\nas well as by gender.\nMethods\nHere, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health), a US study of over 15,000\nparticipants (median age 29.0 years), to characterize the associations\nbetween measures of body fat distribution--waist circumference\n(WC) andWC adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (WC\n-bmi\n)--with SBP\nwithin white and black race and gender subgroups.\nResults\nOur findings suggest that, at lower levels ofWC\n-bmi\n, white women\nhave significantly higher SBP as compared to black women, whereas\nblack men have higher SBP than white men. Black women with\nWC\n-bmi\n>90cm have higher SBP compared to white women with\nsimilarWC\n-bmi\n, whereas among black and white men the associations\nare essentially similar across the full range ofWC\n-bmi\n.\nConclusions\nThe present results suggest that associations among anthropometric\nmeasures of adiposity and blood pressure are nonlinear, and\nimportantly, vary for whites and blacks by gender. In black women,\nSBP increased more asWC increased from low- to mid-range levels,\nwhereas it was only at higherWC levels that black men exhibited\nhigher SBP than white men.\nKeywords:bloodpressure;bodymassindex;gender;hypertension;race;\nsystolicbloodpressure;waistcircumference\nAmericanJournalofHypertension, advance online publication 6 October 2011;\nSystolic Blood Pressure and Adiposity: Examination\nby Race and Gender in a Nationally Representative\nSample of Young Adults\nBeverly H.

In addition, specific contextual data on the family,\nneighborhood, and other social environments may be linked\nto health outcomes in young adulthood. Wave four interviews\nwere expanded to collect biological data, e.g., blood pressure.\nThe Add Health study was reviewed and approved by the institu-\ntional review board at the University of North Carolina\u00adChapel\nHill and written consent was obtained at all waves from either the\nrespondent or the parent if the respondent was under age 18. For\ndetailed information regarding the study and its design, please\nsee ref. 17. Data for the present study were collected at Wave IV, as\nSBP was not assessed at prior Waves.\nMeasures. Age was recorded in years; and gender 0 = men;\n1 = women. Race was self-identified, and coded as white = 0,\nblack = 1. education was coded as: 0 = some high school or\nless, or G.E.D.; 1 = graduated high school; 2 = some college\nor vocational-tech; 3 = bachelor's degree; 4 = some graduate\nschool or more.\nFor detailed information regarding assessment and reliabil-\nity of SBP, see ref. 18. Trained and certified field interviewers\nmeasured respondents' resting, seated systolic and DBPs (mm\nHg) and pulse rate (beats/min). Following a 5-min seated rest\nthree serial measurements were performed at 30-s interval\nusing a factory calibrated, Microlife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillom-\netric blood pressure monitor (MicroLife USA, Dunedin, FL).\nSBP was constructed as the average of measures two and three.\nFor cardiac medication status, participants were first asked,\n\"Have you taken any medications in the last four weeks?\" If the\nrespondent answered yes, they were asked to collect their med-\nications and the interviewer recorded a list of medications pro-\nvided. We represented medication using a dichotomous yes/no\nvariable that included all classes of medication prescribed that\nmight lower blood pressure.\nHeight was measured to the nearest 0.5cm. Weight was\nmeasured to the nearest 0.1kg. BMI was calculated: BMI (kg/\nm2) = weight (kg)/height (m2). Height and weight were meas-\nured at Wave IV. WC was measured to the nearest 0.5cm at the\nsuperior border of the iliac crest, including pregnant women.\nAlcohol consumption was defined as: 0 = nondrinker; 1 =\noccasional drinker, drink 2 or fewer days of the week; 2 = light\ndrinker, drink 5\u00ad7 days/week and drink 2 or fewer drinks (1 or\nfewer if female); 3 = moderate drinker, drink 5\u00ad7 days/week, 3\ndrinks for males, 2 drinks for females; 4 = heavy drinker, drink\n5\u00ad7 days/week, >3 drinks for males, >2 for females. Smoking\nwas represented by a dichotomous yes/no variable that indi-\ncated whether or not the participant was a daily smoker.\nStatistical analyses. Sample characteristics were described using\nmedians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and\nfrequency and percentage for categories. In a preliminary anal-\nysis,weexaminedmeanSBPlevelsacrossraceandgenderusing\nthe general linear model. We then used ordinary least squares\nregression to examine associations between body size variables\nand SBP. In each model, we included age, level of education,\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, and use of cardiac medication\nas adjustment variables. We estimated two regression models\nthe first included WC but not BMI, the second included both\nWC and BMI. We modeled SBP, BMI, and WC as continuous\nvariables, allowing the effect of BMI and WC variables to be\nnonlinear, using a three-knot restricted cubic splines,19 a flex-\nible nonparameteric smoother. Models contained two three-\nway interaction terms, gender \u00d7 race \u00d7 waist and gender \u00d7 race\n\u00d7 BMI, as well as all corresponding lower-order terms. BMI\nand waist were allowed to be nonlinear within each interac-\ntion term, again using a three-knot spline. The primary effects\nof interest were the three-way interactions described above.\nRegression models were weighted using the grand sample\nweights, and within-school clustering was accounted for by\nincluding the school cluster codes in the model as covariates.\nThe sample was limited to the 10,102 black and white study\nparticipants. We further excluded participants who had miss-\ning data on the BMI or waist variables, or who had no sample\nweight assigned. This resulted in a final sample size of 9,906\nparticipants for the analysis. This small percentage (1.6%) of\nmissing data generally does not require imputation.20\nResults\nSee Table 1 for presentation of sample characteristics. In an\ninitial analysis, we examined the levels of SBP across race and\ngender, adjusting for age, level of education, cardiac medica-\ntion use, smoking, and alcohol intake. The gender \u00d7 race inter-\naction was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Black women\nadjusted P < 0.001). SBP also was slightly higher among black\ncally significant (Tukey adjusted P = 0.31).\nIn both regression models, which included WC and then\nWC and BMI simultaneously, the race \u00d7 gender \u00d7 WC inter-\naction term was statistically significant (P = 0.02, P = 0.03,\nrespectively).\nIn addition, in the full model, the race \u00d7 gender \u00d7 BMI inter-\naction also was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Among the\nadjustment covariables, cardiac medication, smoking, and\nheavier alcohol intake were associated with higher SBP. Age\nalso was positively related to SBP, but was nonsignificant. See\nSupplementary Appendix online for the regression results for\nthese latter variables. Regression weights from spline terms are\nnot readily interpretable, particularly when involved in interac-\ntions. We therefore focus on interpreting the interaction graphi-\ncally.

When WC was relatively low (roughly\n<70cm), Black and white women tended to have similar SBP.\nAt the middle range of WC (~70\u00ad100cm), however, the regres-\nsion slope is somewhat steeper for black women than for white\nwomen, with black women exhibiting higher SBPs across this\nrange, the races converging again at WC levels of about 140cm.\nWhite and black men tended to have similar SBP when WC\nwas under ~100cm, but black men exceeded white men when\nWC exceeded ~100cm.

The slope\nfor black women was curvilinear, with the difference between\nblack and white women quickly becoming more pronounced\nfor WC-bmi\nvalues greater than about 70cm. Black men with\nWC-bmi\nlower than about 70cm had higher SBP compared to\nWhite men in the same WC-bmi range\n, whereas the difference\ndiminishes after WC-bmi\napproaches ~100cm. For both unad-\njusted and adjusted analyses, the wide confidence limits for the\nvery high levels of WC and WC-bmi\nreflect the relative sparse-\nness of the data in that region, thus limiting inferences for those\nindividuals with WC and WC-bmi\nin that region.\nDiscussion\nThe present findings, in a large sample of young adults, suggest\nthat the relations between SBP and WC differ for whites and\nblacks, as well as by gender, and that these associations are not\nlinear. In black women, SBP increased more as WC increased\nfrom low- to mid-range levels. In contrast, it was only at higher\nWC levels that black men exhibited higher SBP than white men.\nAdjustment for BMI tended to amplify the difference between\nblack and white women, but diminish the race difference in\nmales. The additional predictive ability of WC might reflect\nthe involvement of fat depots more closely associated with WC\nthan BMI, such as visceral fat.11 Studies of more direct meas-\nures of visceral fat will be needed to test this hypothesis. Very\nfew studies appear to have examined both race and gender\ndifferences with respect to BMI-adjusted WC and blood pres-\nsure. Janssen et al.21 found that after adjustment for BMI, WC\nremained a significantly associated with hypertension in both\nmen and women in a cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age\n~43 years), but did not examine ethnic differences (nor is the\nethnic composition of the sample reported). Of strictly meth-\nodological interest, Janssen et al. also showed that the use of\nartificially categorized body size variable led to potential dis-\ntortions in the estimation of associations. Tybor et al.'s16 lon-\ngitudinal study did examine race and gender differences in the\nassociation between BMI-adjusted WC and blood pressure and\nfound that changes in BMI-adjusted WC predicted changes in\nSBP and DBP, but only in white women. In our cross-sectional\ndesign, the association between BMI-adjusted WC and SBP\nwas actually weakest among white women. Among the criti-\ncal differences between the present study and Tybor et al., is\nthat as the present study used data from young adults around\nage 29, whereas Tybor et al. studied adolescents through the\nperiods of about age 11\u00ad19 years. Thus, differences in findings\nacross studies may reflect developmental differences in physiol-\nogy. It also may be that Tybor et al.'s longitudinal design may be\naddressing a different question than the present study. Schaie22\nfor example, has long argued that cross-sectional data cannot\nbe extrapolated to within-person change.\nStrengths of the present study include the large, well-\n\ndescribed group of participants taken from a nationally rep-\nresentative sample and highly reliable measures of body shape\nand blood pressure. The large sample also enabled us to exam-\nine relatively complex interactions with some confidence in\nthe power and precision of the estimates. Consequently, our\n\nanalytic approach allows for a richer, more nuanced descrip-\ntion of the associations under study. There also are, however,\nseveral limitations to our approach. First, as with all obser-\nvational studies, unmeasured confounding or explanatory\nvariables may be producing spurious associations. Second, it\nis simply not practical to examine all possible interdependent\neffects. In other words, there may be other variables with which\nrace, gender, BMI, and WC interact, such as age, income, edu-\ncation, alcohol intake, etc. To summarize, the mechanisms by\nwhich WC confers additional cardiovascular risk are complex\nand seem to differ between whites and blacks, as well as by race\nand gender.\nSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://\nwww.nature.com/ajh\n"
