McQuillan, PhD1, Qiyuan Pan, PhD1, and Kathryn S. Porter, MD1\nPurpose: The study determines the consent rates for storage of biologic samples for future research with and\nwithout genetic studies and describes trends in sociodemographic factors associated with consent. Methods: We\nperformed an analysis of the characteristics of consenting individuals participating in three data cycles of the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population.\nrespectively, consented to have their biologic samples including DNA stored in a national repository. Female and\nnon-Hispanic black participants were least likely to consent when genetic studies and DNA were included. In the\nthese race/gender differences were no longer observed. Conclusion: Females and non-Hispanic blacks consis-\ntently had lower consent rates during the survey years when genetic studies were mentioned in the consent, but\nonce DNA collection was discontinued these differences disappeared. These findings demonstrate wide accep-\ntance among survey participants for allowing storage of specimens for future studies but indicate the need to\nexplore race/gender issues with the collection and storage of DNA for genetic research. Genet Med 2006:8(6):\nKey Words: informed consent, genetic research, survey, representative sample\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), a representative sample of the United States pop-\nulation, randomly selects 5000 individuals each year to partic-\nipate in the survey. Individuals who agree to participate are\ninterviewed in the home and then are scheduled to be exam-\nined in the Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) a few weeks\nafter the home interview. The informed consent document for\nthe examination and the separate consent for the storage of\nbiologic specimens for future use are presented to the partici-\npant after the interview in the home is completed. In 2003\nscribe the sociodemographic predictors of the willingness of\nNHANES participants to sign the consent and allow their bio-\nlogic specimens to be used for genetic research.1 We now pro-\nvide an update on the NHANES experience with consent for\nstorage of biologic specimens for future studies during the 4\nyears of the survey when DNA was collected and the 2 years\nwhen it was dropped from the protocol. We also examined the\ntrends among sociodemographic factors associated with con-\nsent over time.\nMETHODS\nSurvey design\nNHANES, a series of cross-sectional national surveys con-\nducted since 1971 by the National Center for Health Statistics\nof the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ob-\ntains a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population. The surveys use a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability sample design with unequal\nprobabilities of selection to oversample certain subgroups of\npeople, such as adolescents, African-Americans, and Mexican\nAmericans.2 In 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey\nwith 2-year data-release cycles. Persons participating in each\nsurvey year are representative of the U.S. population and are\nexamined once in the MECs, with no longitudinal follow-up.\nSimilar procedures were used to select the sample and conduct\nthe interviews and examinations as in previous NHANES\nsurveys.3 The surveys provide national statistics on the health\nand nutritional status of the U.S. population. One of the goals\nnational probability sample of biologic specimens including\nsurvey years, DNA collection was dropped from the protocol\nbecause of funding constraints.\nFrom the 1Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, National Center for\nHealth Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland.\nGeraldine M. McQuillan, PhD, National Center for Health Statistics 3311 Toledo Road,\nData collection for NHANES occurs at three levels: a brief\nhousehold screening interview, an in-depth household survey\ninterview, and a medical examination in a special MEC. Con-\nsent for the examination and a separate consent for the collec-\ntion of the specimens for future studies were obtained after the\nindividual was selected for participation in the study and the\nhousehold interview was completed. Only participants aged 20\nyears or older were eligible for DNA collection in the 1999 to\n2002 survey, although biologic samples for future research\nwere collected on all age ranges with either parental or individ-\nual consent or assent. Although the consent included the pos-\nsibility of extracting DNA from saliva, only whole blood was\nprocessed for DNA extraction. The NHANES survey and con-\nsent documents were approved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics Research Ethics Review Board.\nThis article presents the trends in the percentage of partici-\npants who signed the \"Specimen Storage and Continuing\nStudies\" consent form during the three 2-year cycles of the\nsurvey. There were minor changes to the consent document in\ntinuation of the collection of DNA for future genetic studies.\nThe consent documents used for the storage of biologic speci-\nvey document without this collection are presented in Figures\n1 and 2 (online only).\nNHANES participants were informed that all the health data\ncollected would be kept strictly private and that the staff were\nnot allowed to discuss their participation in the survey under\npenalty of Federal law: Sections 308 (d) of the Public Health\n552C). Participants who were interviewed and examined, and\nwho agreed to storage of their specimens cannot be identified\nby any researcher using the NHANES public use microdata\nfiles. Data are recategorized, top coded, and/or suppressed be-\nfore public release if there is any potential for identification of\nparticipants.\nThe purpose of collecting the stored specimens was to pro-\nvide a resource for new scientific laboratory tests, including\ngenetic tests, that were not available when the participant was\nexamined. Therefore, the participant was informed that no\nspecific studies were currently planned, and that researchers\nusing their samples would not be contacting them for any ad-\nditional information. They were also told that NCHS would\nnot contact them with specific results but would provide infor-\nmation on the studies being conducted in a newsletter. Propos-\nals for use of their specimens would be reviewed for scientific\nmerit and by an institutional review board to ensure that the\nproposed research was ethical. Finally, they were told they\ncould remove their specimens at any time and were given a\ntoll-free number to obtain information.\nThe number of adults aged 20 or more years selected for\nRace/ethnicity based on self-report was categorized as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-\ncan. Individuals who did not self-select into these categories\nwere classified as \"other.\" Poverty-index was calculated by\ndividing total family income by the poverty threshold index\nadjusted for family size at the year of interview. All inter-\nviews were conducted in English or Spanish. If another language\nwas spoken by the participant, a family member or local inter-\npreter translated the interview from English. Samples sizes in the\npoverty index and years of education categories do not equal the\ntotal population because of item nonresponse for these variables.\nWith the addition of a separate consent document for\nspecimen storage and continuing studies including DNA\ncollection in 1999, interviewers expressed some concerns\nthat they needed more training to adequately explain the\npurpose and potential use of the specimen repository. In\n2000 the NHANES program held several training sessions\nfor the interviewers and provided fact sheets and brochures\nto address the use of the bank and the protections that were\nin place to ensure that all studies would have adequate tech-\nnical and ethical review. Interviewers reported that these\nmaterials were helpful with answering concerns and in ob-\ntaining respondent cooperation.\nParticipants were able to check a box on the consent form\nthat allowed the storage of blood, urine, or saliva for future\nstudies and sign the form but not agree to have blood or saliva\nkept for future studies using their genes.\nStatistical analysis\nThese analyses are based on data used to monitor the survey\noperations. Rates are therefore not weighted to produce na-\ntional estimates. Consent rates and 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) and logistic regression analysis were computed using SAS\nversion 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). Differences between\nsubpopulations or survey years were evaluated by examining P\nvalues calculated using a univariate t statistic. To correct for\nmultiple comparisons within categories within a survey cycle\nor between the survey cycles, the Bonferroni correction was\napplied to this P value.4\nAll variables examined were entered into a logistic regres-\nsion model to determine which factors independently contrib-\nuted to an unwillingness to consent in the two study cycles that\nincluded the collection of DNA for genetic research. The other\nracial/ethnic group was deleted from the logistic regression\nbecause of the small sample size and the diverse composition of\nthe group, and the language of interview was not modeled\nbecause it was not evenly distributed among the three race/\nethnic groups. All other variables were included to control for\nthe effect of age, education, or income on response, and pair-\nwise interactions in the model were explored using a P  .05\nfrom the Wald chi-square to test for significance.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the overall response rates to the household\nUpdate on consent for genetic research\nyears. Response rates for the interview varied from 72% to 78%\nover the 6 years of the survey included in this report. In most\nsurvey years non-Hispanic whites were less likely to agree to be\ninterviewed. There was no significant sex difference in inter-\nview consent rates, and in all survey years individuals aged 60\nor more years were less likely to participate than younger age\ngroups.

High response rates are important to\nthe survey so response bias can be reduced or controlled and\nestimates generalizable to the U.S. population can be pro-\nduced.\nWe first reported differences by demographic groups in ac-\nceptance of the \"Specimen Storage and Continuing Studies\"\ncomponent of the survey based on response rates in 1999 and\n2000.1 Participants were told that no results from future testing\nof their biologic samples would be returned to them and that\nthey could remove their samples at any time. A toll-free num-\nber was provided on the consent form so they could call to\nremove their samples.

Extensive training of our interviewers and the provision\nof answers to commonly asked questions (Appendix 1) signif-\nicantly increased this response rate in every demographic cat-\negory between the two cycles of the survey that contained the\ncollection of DNA for future genetic studies. Training and in-\nformation did not change the significantly lower response rates\nfor non-Hispanic blacks compared with whites and females\n2002 surveys. Other studies have demonstrated that minority\nrace/ethnic groups are less willing to participate in genetic\nresearch.5,6 The consistently lower consent rates for females\nduring the years when consent was sought to store specimens\nfor future genetic studies have not been seen in clinical genetic\nstudies;6,7 however, a population-based study in Japan found\nthat female gender and older age were factors for nonpartici-\npation in a population-based cohort study involving genetic\nresearch.8 Because NHANES participants are selected to be\nrepresentative of the general U.S. population with no selection\nif there was any disease or condition, the lack of a personal\nincentive of a clinically relevant reason to participate in the\ncollection and storage of blood for continuing studies that in-\nclude genetic studies may impact women more than men when\nfaced with the decision to sign the consent document. A logis-\ntic regression analysis to determine independent predictors for\nnot signing the consent document with the genetic research\nincluded demonstrated that being non-Hispanic black or fe-\nmale was the independent predictor for not consenting after\ncontrolling for age, education, and poverty index.\nWhen the mention of genes and DNA was removed from the\nwas no longer a significant decrease in consent by non-His-\npanic blacks and females. Consent also increased from 90.1%\nto 98.4%. This change suggests that the concept of genetic re-\nsearch was a cause for concern for some participants in the\nNHANES survey because removing words directly linking the\ncollection to genetic research significantly increased response\nsurveys when genes were mentioned.\nThe debate on the appropriate consent for the collection and\nstorage of biologic samples is ongoing and not restricted to\nonly the NHANES project.6,9 Because the NHANES is a general\nhealth study with no overarching disease or condition driving\nthe data collection, a general consent was requested with the\nonly limitation that the future studies will look at health con-\nditions. This authorization of unlimited future research has\nbeen examined in two recent studies with the conclusion that\nalthough research participants want to know and consent for\nthe storage of their biologic specimens, the majority of partic-\nipants studied were not concerned with the particular disease\nthat would be studied.6,9 During the two 2-year survey cycles\nwhen DNA and genetic studies were included on the consent\ndocument, we offered our participants the option of storage of\nblood, urine, and saliva while not agreeing to the storage of\nblood to look at genes. Less than 1% of participants chose to\ncheck this box and still sign the consent form. We conclude\nthat we could not properly articulate this option in the consent\ndocument; therefore, we plan on a simplified approach to con-\nsent for continuing studies in future cycles of the survey that\nincludes the storage of biologic samples to be used for future\nheath studies including studies using genes.\nThe results of this current analysis of consent for specimen\nstorage and continuing studies suggest that there is general\nacceptance across the demographic groups for participation in\nfuture research including genetic research in the general U.S.\npopulation. As our interviewers, who presented the consent\ndocument, gained experience with explaining this component,\nconsent rates improved in every category examined. Although\nthere was a 90% acceptance of future studies including genetic\nconsent was almost universal with the lowest consent rate in\nthe 60 years or older age group.\nThe NHANES program is planning to reintroduce the col-\nof DNA preparation has provided an opportunity to include\nthis component in the survey. Because we now have experience\nwith the use of our DNA and can provide examples of the type\nof genetic projects approved for use of the NHANES DNA\nsamples, we hope we can continue to improve our consent\nRelative odds for lack of consent to genetic research from logistic regression\nDemographic\ncharacteristic\nOdds ratio\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic white Reference group Reference group\nSex\nMale Reference group Reference group\nAge (y)\n60 Reference group Reference group\nEducation\nPoverty Index\n1 Reference group Reference group\na95% confidence interval.\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; CI, confidence\ninterval.\nMcQuillan et al.\nrates and address any concerns that participants might have\nabout the use of their biologic samples.10 Our experience be-\nstrates that interviewer training with specific information that\naddresses the participants' questions and concerns can signif-\nicantly improve consent rates.\n"
