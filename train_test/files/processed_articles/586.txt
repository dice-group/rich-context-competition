Compared with psychiatry and clinical\npsychology, the profession has long taken the lead in issues related to\nrace, ethnicity, and gender-related disparity (National Association of Social\nWorkers [NASW], 2007). However, there is a need for more evidence-based\nresearch on this topic to keep up with the profession's practice-based leader-\nship role on the national stage. The Latino and Asian American populations\nhave been rapidly increasing in the United States (Passel & Cohn, 2008;\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2002). Nevertheless, there is scant research to present\ninformation about mental health service in these two subgroups.\nMinorities frequently receive health care that is inadequate with respect\nto quantity and quality (Briggance & Burke, 2002; Jones, Cason, & Bond,\n2002). One of the most significant factors contributing to ethnic disparities\nin health care is social and economic inequality (Nazroo, 2003; Seguin,\nfactor is the inability of providers to recognize the cultural barriers faced by\nStill others have to do with a culturally based stigma connected to mental\nillness. Snowden (2003) theorized that health care disparities among mi-\nnorities occur due to the clinicians and mental health administrators making\n``unwarranted judgments about people on the basis of race or ethnicity.'' It is\nimperative that providers respect their ethnic minority patients and patients'\ncultural beliefs and health practices. Ngo-Metzger, Legedza, and Phillips\n(2004) recommended that providers must try to understand and incorporate\ncultural understanding into their health care practice. These problems were\nexacerbated in a managed care setting employing gatekeepers in which\nethnic minorities were less likely than White patients to receive appropriate\nCulture-related identity and family structure in minority groups may vary\nand may significantly affect their service needs and help-seeking behaviors\ninvolved. For example, in Hispanic families, identity is often derived from\nbeing a member of a group, rather than being an individual (Ivey & Faust,\n2001). Hispanic males and elders advise family members regarding decisions\nand become privy to a great deal of information; therefore, it may be unac-\nceptable in that culture for a youngster to accompany his mother to serve as\nhaving family members as translators may cause potential stress and also\nintroduce bias, causing errors in the translation of symptoms and medical\nhistory. Hispanics feel compelled to appear agreeable to their physicians out\nof respect and courtesy, and as a result, these patients fail to question their\nphysicians without understanding them (Haffner, 1992). More important,\nethnic minority patients would like providers to respect their culturally based\nhealth beliefs and practices, and providers must recognize and understand\nthe cultural differences (Ngo-Metzger et al., 2004). It has been suggested to\nlearn the cultural differences among ethnic groups and also address cultural\ndifferences before psychotherapy begins (LaRoche & Maxie, 2003).\nFurther, mental health providers from a mainstream background may\nlack of knowledge about culture-related mental health manifestations. In\nAsian American cultures, for example, somatic symptoms and nonverbal\nexpressions are more culturally accepted and less stigmatized (Herrick &\nBrown, 1998). The lack of culturally appropriate services contributes to\nthe low levels of mental health usage for Asian Americans (Okazaki, 2000;\n(1998) found that Chinese immigrants and native-born Chinese living in Los\nAngeles County were better served with ethnically matched health services.\nAsian Americans are usually hesitant to seek services for their emotional\npart to health beliefs, centered in oriental medicine, taking a holistic view of\nphysical health and mental health rather than separating them (Ai, in press).\nEmotional problems are closely associated with organ-based health, though\nthese organ functions are systematic as functionally described rather than\nanatomically described (Ai, in press). Perhaps for the same reason, research\nhas found that Latinos living in the United States have underused mental\nhealth services, and this is troubling from the standpoint of research and in\nWomen of color may face double barriers. Hispanic women make up\na disproportionate number of insured patients (Jones et al., 2002). They\nfaced barriers such as lack of education, low income, and single status that\nprevent them from making their postpartum check-up visits (Jones et al.,\n(SES) and inadequate social support networks have an increased risk of de-\npression (Cunningham & Zayas, 2002). On the other hand, minority women\ndo have a heightened need for appropriate mental health care (Diala et al.,\nbetween perceived discrimination against Korean immigrants and depressive\nsymptoms. Mental health issues may manifest themselves as gastrointestinal\nsymptoms or chest pains in Hispanics, or complaints of dizziness in Asians\n(McCarthy, 2001). The manifestation of distress, negative emotion, and de-\npression among Hispanics and Asians are more somatic than emotional\n(Takeuchi, Chun, Gong, & Shen, 2002). As shown in the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV), the cultural\nvariations of certain mental health issues, such as ``hwa-byung'' in Korean\nhousewives, ``blacking out'' in Caribbean women, ``koro'' in Malaysians,\n``locura'' in Latino and Latina, and qi-gong psychotic reaction in Chinese\n(pp. 844\u00ad849; also see Ai, in press), may not be fully understandable by\nEffects of Discrimination and Acculturation 49\nmental health professionals from the mainstream backgrounds in the United\nStates.\nThe key to improving the utilization of mental health service for\nLatina and Asian American women therefore lies in the improvement of\nprovider\u00adpatient relationship. As a start, social workers and major mental\nhealth providers should know better whether the existing service is meeting\nwomen's basic needs. A study by Ayanian et al. (2005) identified that\nHispanics reported more problems with coordinationof health care, and non-\nEnglish-speaking Hispanic patients reported more problems with their health\ncare providers. Similarly, Asian Americans patients rated their health care\nexperience poorly compared to Whites (Haviland, Morales, Reise, & Hays,\nsatisfaction with their primary care physician lower than that of Whites in\ntheir cross-sectional study of 502 patients. Likewise, Hunt, Gaba, and Lavizzo-\nMourey's (2005) study showed that ethnic minorities were more likely than\nWhites to have lower levels of trust and satisfaction with their physicians.\nMoreover, Ngo-Metzger et al.'s (2004) study revealed that Asian Americans\nwere less likely to report positive interactions with their physicians than\nwere White patients. Additionally, results from the Consumer Assessment of\nHealth Plans Study of 47,300 Medicaid enrollees showed that racial/ethnic\nand linguistic minorities reported worse care than did Whites (Weech-\nMaldonado, Morales, Elliott, Spritzer, Marshall, & Hays, 2003).\nTaken together, it is likely that discrimination and acculturation-related\nissues may contribute to the lack of service seeking and satisfaction among\nLatina and Asian American women. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed\nthe data from the national study on Latina and Asian American population,\nconducted as part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies\nmain purpose of the CPES was to collect data on the prevalence and patterns\nof mental disorders and their treatment patterns in U.S. adults (Heeringa\net al., 2004). The National Latino Asian American Study (NLAAS) adapted\nits research design (e.g., procedure, main questionnaire about sociodemo-\ngraphics and mental health issues) from the National Comorbidity Survey\n(NCS), in which the sample sizes were relatively small for ethnic minorities,\nis specifically designed to integrate the psychiatric epidemiologic data and\npsychiatric disorders of Latinos and Asian Americans (Alegria et al., 2004).\nTo date, new and limited publications on the NLAAS data noted that Asian\nwomen born outside the United States were less likely than U.S.-born women\nto experience a mental disorder during their lifetime (Abe-Kim et al., 2006).\nFor the purpose of the current study, we selected only Latina and\nAsian American women who had sought mental health service within the\npast 12 months. Based on the literature, we hypothesize that discrimination\nattributed to race and/or gender issues would negatively affect satisfaction\nwith service provided. However, we also expect other influences from ac-\nculturation may be related to better outcomes. Finally, mental health status\nand certain demographics were selected as controls.\nMETHOD\nParticipants and Sample Design\nBased on the model of the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R)\nand the National Survey of American Life (Alegria et al., 2004), the NLAAS\nbecame the first population-based national survey for Latino and Asian Amer-\nican. The NLAAS questionnaire was available in six languages: English, Span-\nish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. Instruments include so-\ncial demographic variables, mental health screening and diagnosis variables,\nservice usage and evaluations, and acculturation and immigration items,\namong others.\nThe sampling procedure for the NLAAS was previously documented,\nand weights were developed to correct for sampling bias (Alegria et al., 2004;\n1,097 Asian American women. However, it is worth noting that, among\nAsian descendents, this national study mainly targeted the three diverse\nmajor subgroups with respect to SES, namely those with Chinese, Filipino,\nand Vietnamese heritage. However, the survey did not target those in other\nmajor Asian American subgroups with above-average SES, such as Eastern\nIndian, Japanese, and Korean descendents (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002).\nIn the current study, we used 268 Latina and Asian American women\nwho had been seeking mental health service in the past 12 months (n D 188\nfor Latina, and n D 80 for Asian American women).\nMeasures\nThe dependent variable in this study is satisfaction of service use. The\nvariable used to select the sample was service usage. Respondents in the\nNLAAS survey were asked the types of mental health services they used\nwith these questions: ``How many visits did you make to a (provider list)\nin the past 12 months?'' These providers include psychiatrist, psychologist,\nother mental health professional, general practitioner, nurse, occupational\ntherapist or other health professional, social worker, counselor and religious\nor spiritual advisors, and any other healers). This variable was dichotomously\ncoded (0 D none, 1 D at least once). For every kind of providers the women\nwent to see in the last 12 years, they were asked about their satisfaction\nwith care received with the question ``In general, how satisfied are you with\nEffects of Discrimination and Acculturation 51\nthe treatments and services you received from [service provider] in the past\n12 months--very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, or very\ndissatisfied?'' In the current study, we average the satisfaction scores, if the\nwomen had gone to different kind of service providers, and use the mean\nas the general satisfaction for mental service.\nBased on literature review, we have included the major independent\nvariables as following: acculturation, discrimination, and reason for discrim-\nination. Acculturation is measured by English-language proficiency, using\nan average of three items, self reported, on how well they speak, read,\nand write English (Cronbach's alpha is 0.98); Discrimination was assessed\nusing the nine-question asking in the day-to-day life how often these things\nhappen to you, for example, ``you were treated with less courtesy than other\npeople.'' The internal consistency for this nine-item scale in this sample was\n0.88. We used the mean of the nine items, and the mean is around 2. With 1\nmeans never and 6 means almost every day, the overall mean in this sample\nis around ``less than once a year.'' However, only about one fourth of the\nwomen never had any discrimination toward her. Reason for discrimination\nwas measured by the answer to the questions: what do you think was the\nmain reason for these experiences, we grouped the answers ``your ancestry\nor national origin or ethnicity'' ``gender or sex,'' and ``your race'' together\nversus other reasons such as ``your age'' ``your sexual orientation,'' and ``your\nweight,'' because we feel that the first three options are discrimination, that\nis, speak to the fact that we were focusing on discrimination that is specific\nto Latina and Asian American women. The resulting dichotomous variables\nshowed that among the 268 women, 35.1% feel that the discrimination she\nexperienced is the result of her being a Latina or Asian woman. The women\nwho had never had any discrimination experiences are coded 0 for this item.\nFor controls, we used age, education, and income, race/ethnicity (Latina\nor Asian in our sample), U.S. born, and years in the United States, and mental\nhealth self-rating. Income is measured using an index as the ratio to poverty\nand 21 years and beyond). The mental health self-rating was assessed with\none question: ``How would you rate your overall mental health--Excellent,\nvery good, good, fair or poor?''\nDescriptive Analysis\nTable 1 shows characteristics of women respondents on whom they seek\nfor health care and the number of visits in the past 12 months. For service\nutilization, 607 of the female respondents in NLAAS (24%) have seen at least\none of the nine kinds of professional for mental health issues in their lifetime.\nTABLE 1 Types of Professionals Visited in the Last 12 Months and the Numbers of Visit (N D\nProviders\n% Visited\nlast year\n# of Times\nif visited\nNurse/occupational therapy/other health professional 4.1 6.8\nAnd, 268 of the women (10.6%) have gone to see at least one those profes-\nsionals in the past 12 months. In our sample of 268, if a woman went to seek\nhelp, most likely, she went to general practitioner for help (47%), followed\nby psychiatrist (one of three). Only 12% used a social worker for help.\nThe statistics of the dependent and predictor variables used in the\nanalysis are presented in Table 2. In the current analysis, satisfaction is\nthe outcome, dependent variable of the proposed regression analysis, with\nhigher score meaning higher levels of satisfaction. As shown in Table 2,\namong the 268 women we are studying, the average score of satisfaction\nranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating very dissatisfied and 5 indicating very\nsatisfied, and mean of 4 indicating satisfied.\na median at 41; education level ranges from fourth grade or less to 17 years\nor more, with a median of 12th grade; income is measured using the 2001\nCensus household income-to-needs ratio; there are 40.3% of the sample who\nare born in United States, and for the years in United States, the U.S.-born\nTABLE 2 Means, Standard Deviations and Ranges of the Variables in the Analyses (N D 268)\nOutcome/dependent variable Mean/or % SD Minimum Maximum\nEffects of Discrimination and Acculturation 53\nwere assigned the highest categories. In the current study sample, the mental\nhealth self-rated has a mean of ``good,'' and few people choose the extreme\nvalues.\nThe analysis plan is to run multiple regressions to test which variables are\nsignificant after controlling of other potential predictors. Weights are used in\nall regression attempts to account for sampling bias. There seems to be no\ndifference between Asian and Latina in terms of service seeking satisfaction.\nThe final regression results (N D 268) are presented in Table 3. With\nmodel explained 14.3% of the variance in Latina and Asian women's mental\nhealth\u00adseeking satisfaction. As expected, mental health self-rating is closely\nrelated to satisfaction, with higher level of mental health rating indicating\nhigher satisfaction. For our main hypothesis, the results showed that levels of\ndiscrimination are not predicting levels of satisfaction; however, if the reason\nof discriminating is perceived to be because of race/ethnicity or gender, it\nleads to a lower level of satisfaction. For our secondary hypothesis, higher\nlevel of English proficiency does not predicts higher level of satisfaction;\nBeing U.S. born alone does not predict satisfaction; however, longer years\nof being in the United States is associated with higher levels of satisfaction.\nFurthermore, education is also significantly predicting satisfaction level, with\nhigher level of education predicts higher level of satisfaction. Age has a pos-\nitive relationship with satisfaction level. When other variables are controlled\nfor, poverty level or income does not predict satisfaction.\nTABLE 3 Ordinary Least Square Regressions Predicting\nMental Health Service Satisfaction Among Latina and\nAsian American Women\nPredictors Beta\nYears in United States (Categorical) .232*\nDiscrimination experience .035\nDiscrimination reason (gender/ethnicity) .132*\nMental health self-rating .168**\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study may be the first to demonstrate the satisfaction pattern\namong Latina and Asian American women who sought mental health service\nover the past 12 months when the NLAAS was conducted. Not surprisingly,\nthe rate of service seeking is low, consistent with the general report from this\ndatabase (Alegria et al., 2007). Interestingly, some significant predictors for\nsatisfaction for service in the NLAAS are consistent with the finding for other\nminority groups with respect to age and education (Jackson, Chamerlin, &\nfor Latino and Asian Americans, the immigration factor in terms of years in\nthe United States is very important to mental health service seeking and\nevaluations. This indicates that this acculturation related variable is a key to\naccept the U.S. type of mental health services. Most of service seekers were\nborn outside of United States. Nonetheless, though the years in the United\nStates predict satisfaction levels significantly, being born in the United States\nalone does not predict satisfaction level. It is also interesting to see that\nincome level is not a significant predictor in the current study.\nThe most novel finding in this analysis was that multivariate analysis\nsingled out that race and gender-based discrimination, rather than simple\nfrequency of discrimination experience, has the direct and independent effect\non service satisfaction. This finding not only lends strong support for our pri-\nmary hypothesis, but also highlights the fact of the quality of discrimination\nperceived by Latina and Asian American women overweighs its quantity\nin the count for service-seeking satisfaction. Discrimination perceived by\nminorities may impose negative impacts in general; however, for women of\ncolor, if the discrimination is perceived to be because of being a woman or\nbecause of being of color, the satisfaction of service seeking is especially\nlower. Clearly, this finding will warrant the greater future research attention\namong social workers and social scientists in the mental health professions.\nThe perceived reason for discrimination experience is especially noted that\nwe need not only study discrimination but also investigate the perceived\nreason at a deep level with a more culture oriented perspective as well.\nAnother noteworthy factor lies in education, also standing out as pre-\ndicting satisfaction level, contrasting with English proficiency that is not\npredictive. Indeed, education, as a factor of individuals' early-life SES, may\nbe considered as one important faction of acculturation. This is because\nin general race issues tend to interplay with social class problems in the\nUnited States and in other countries where immigrants might be born. Certain\ngroups, due to better SES in their origins, might have already expose to\nthe U.S. or Western culture even before they came to the United States. In\ncontrast, those who were born in the minority and low SES communities\nwithin the poor living environment (e.g., poor areas where Mexican Ameri-\ncan farmers reside or Chinese Americans with low education in the inner-city\nEffects of Discrimination and Acculturation 55\nChinatowns) may have a slow process to adapt to the mainstream culture\ncharacteristics even after immigrating for generations. These findings thus\nbear some theoretical and clinical significance in that they provide insights\nto what is actually at stake--English proficiency is important in women's\nlife, however, getting a higher level of education may be more beneficial\nto move up alongside social ladders. Unlike age or years in the United\nStates, education and perceived reason for discrimination can be modified,\nif professional effort can be made to prevent or intervene in a culturally\nsensitive manner. In other words, the two significant variables are individual\nor group characters that could be changed through some effort by mental\nhealth professions and beyond.\nThe current study has important implications for the research, education,\nand practice of mental health professions in general and social work in\nparticular with respect to their roles in the U.S. public health. According to\na national study of licensed social workers from the Center for Workforce\nStudies by Whitaker, Weismiller, and Clark (2006), the top two practice areas\nfor licensed social workers are the areas of mental health (39%) and health\n(13%), with 56% of health care social workers practicing within hospital\nsettings. Approximately 5 of 10 jobs in social work were in health care\nand social assistance settings, and 41% of social workers in 2006 were em-\nployed in medical and mental health settings (Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n2008). According to the Social Work Imperatives adopted at the National\nAssociation of Social Work Congress on March 2005, one key imperative\nwas that social workers as a profession must ``elevate the public's aware-\nness of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of social work practice in health\ncare.'' Along with the diversification and aging trends of the U.S. population,\nsocial workers will play an increasingly critical role in health and mental\nhealth care.\nTo echo the profession's call, social work must demonstrate its profes-\nsional service satisfaction with the disadvantaged populations such as Latinos\nand Asian Americans. As rapidly growing subgroups, the current study clearly\nindicates their service challenges to social worker providers, as well as other\nprofessions in mental and physical health. In addition to the need for more\nresearch, educational formats and content must be modified at all levels\nin schools of social work to expand the skills of social workers. However,\nfirst of all, social work professors need to integrate the knowledge about\nhealth beliefs and seeking behaviors in these hard-working but care-wise\ndisparity subgroups. Furthermore, to deal more effectively with their unmet\nmental health needs, social issues in relation to their race, ethnicity, and\ngender must be addressed in curricular development. Culture-based stigmas\nand name-calling myths, such as immigrants who steal Americans' jobs typi-\ncally tied to Latino Americans, and the so-called model immigrants typically\nattached to Asian Americans, should be clarified first among professionals\nand educators.\nFinally, and more important, the current and new generations of social\nworkers need more in-school and postgraduate refreshment education on\nthe diversity-based population change and the rising recognition of the\nbehavioral impact on public health. It can be envisaged that there will\nbe a rise in need for the permanent role of social work in public health\nand primary care to reduce race, ethnicity, and gender-based disparities\nwhile saving costs for hiring more costly nurses, clinical psychologists, and\npsychiatrists in these areas. As such, we must endorse the integration of\nhealth and mental health components in curricular development rather than\ncontinuing the conventional overspecialized social work education. How-\never, most important, our professionals need to enhance their capacities in\nassessment and treatment of these mental health disorders on the basis of\nthe culturally sensitive practice.\nCertain limitations inherent in the current study should be noted. The\ncurrent study is based on a cross sectional sample and is not an intervention\nstudy. Findings here thus do not inform causality. Limited by sample size, we\ndo not present exact satisfaction rates for social work services. Furthermore,\nas noted above, the three Asian American populations in the NLAAS mostly\nexcluded some major subgroups with the on-average better-off SES, which\nmay have certain impacts on the understanding of the interplay between\nacculturation and SES in Latino and Asian Americans as two with more new\nimmigrants. There is the likelihood that with higher education these unde-\ntected subgroups may share more similarity with mainstream Americans in\nterms of mental health service seeking. Perhaps in part due to this exclusion,\nthe effect size in this analysis is modest. However, these assumptions must be\ntested when the national survey includes these major subgroups who number\nin the millions (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). Although this new design may\nnot be attainable in a short term, more in-depth studies, including qualitative\nones, can be done to explore the undetected predictors and to cover and\nrepresent wide range of ethnic groups. Another limitation of the current study\nis the survey questionnaire does not include items on the characteristics of\nthe providers. Race, gender, and age discordances are factors in patient-\nprovider satisfaction research, which have special cultural meanings for Asian\nand Latina women who seek mental health care.\nIn summary, the current study demonstrates that race and gender-based\ndiscrimination, as well as several acculturation-related variables (e.g., years\nin the United States and education) are significant predictors for satisfaction\nof service seeking among women of Hispanic and Asian origin. It provides\nus with opportunity in future prevention programs. The current study opens\na door for further exploring the effects of discrimination based on gender\nand ethnicity. Mechanisms underlying the predictions of these factors for\nthe satisfaction with mental health service-seeking behaviors should also\nbe explored in the future for improvement for Latina and Asian American\nwomen, two rapidly growing U.S. subpopulations.\nEffects of Discrimination and Acculturation 57\nREFERENCES\nAbe-Kim, J., Takeuchi, D.
