The number of fractures in Asia is higher than that\nin European countries combined. Of all the fractures in\nthe world, approximately 17% was found to occur in\nSoutheast Asia, 29% in West Pacific, as compared to\n35% occurring in Europe [2]. However, the prevalence\nof and risk factors for osteoporosis in Asian populations\nhave not been well documented. Part of the problem is\ndue to the lack of well-defined criteria for the diagnosis\nof osteoporosis in Asian men and women.\nCurrently, the operational definition of osteoporosis is\nbased on a measurement of bone mineral density\n(BMD), which is the most robust predictor of fracture\nrisk [3,4]. BMD of an individual is often expressed in\nterms of its peak level and standard deviation to yield a\nT-score. The two parameters (i.e., peak BMD level and\nstandard deviation) are commonly derived from a well\ncharacterized population of young individuals [5]. An\nindividual's T-score is actually the number of standard\ndeviations from the peak BMD achieved during the age\n* Correspondence: thuclanhopham@pnt.edu.vn\n1Department of Internal Medicine, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine,\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2011 Ho-Pham et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Therefore, the diag-\nnosis of osteoporosis should ideally be based on sex-\nand ethnicity-specific reference range [10,11].\nDual-energy \u00d7 ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered\nthe gold standard method for measuring BMD [6]. In\nrecent years, DXA has been introduced to many Asian\ncountries, including Vietnam, and is commonly used for\nthe diagnosis of osteoporosis and treatment decision. In\nthe absence of sex-specific reference data for local popu-\nlation, most doctors used the T-scores provided by the\ndensitometer as a referent value to make diagnosis for\nan individual. However, it is not clear whether the refer-\nence data base used in the derivation of T-scores in\nthese densitometers is appropriate for a local popula-\ntion. We hypothesize that there is considerable discre-\npancy in the diagnosis of osteoporosis between\nreference data. The present study was designed to test\nthe hypothesis, by determining reference range of peak\nbone density for an Asian population, and then compar-\ning the concordance between a population-specific T-\nscore and the DXA-based T-score in the diagnosis of\nosteoporosis.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThe study was designed as a cross-sectional investiga-\ntion, with the setting being Ho Chi Minh City, a major\ncity in Vietnam. The research protocol and procedures\nwere approved by the Scientific Committee of the Peo-\nple's Hospital 115 and Pham Ngoc Thach University of\nMedicine. All volunteer participants were provided with\nfull information about the study's purpose and gave\ninformed consent to participate in the study, according\nto the principles of medical ethics of the World Health\nOrganization.\nWe used simple random sampling technique for iden-\ntifying potential participants. We approached commu-\nnity organizations, including church and temples, and\nobtained the list of members, and then randomly\nselected individuals aged 18 or above. We sent a letter\nof invitation to the selected individuals. The participants\nreceived a free health check-up, and lipid analyses, but\ndid not receive any financial incentive. No invited parti-\ncipants refused to participate in the study.\nParticipants were excluded from the study if they had\ndiseases deemed to affect to bone metabolism such as\nhyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, renal failure,\nmalabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, chronic colitis,\nmulti- myeloma, leukemia, and chronic arthritis.\nMeasurements and data collection\nData collection was done by trained research doctors\nand nurses using a validated questionnaire. The\nquestionnaire solicited information, including anthropo-\nmetry, lifestyle factors, dietary intakes, physical activity,\nand clinical history. Anthropometric parameters includ-\ning age, weight, standing height were obtained. Body\nweight was measured on an electronic scale with indoor\nclothing without shoes. Height was determined without\nshoes on a portable stadiometer with mandible plane\nparallel to the floor. Each participant was asked to pro-\nvide information on current and past smoking habits.\nSmoking was quantified in terms of the number of\npack-years consumed in each ten-year interval age\ngroup. Alcohol intake in average numbers of standard\ndrinks per day, at present as well as within the last 5\nyears, was obtained. Clinical data including blood pres-\nsure, pulse, and reproductive history (i.e. parity, age of\nmenarche, and age of menopause), medical history (i.e.\nprevious fracture, previous and current use of pharma-\ncological therapies) were also obtained.\nBone mineral density\nAreal BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L2-L4),\nfemoral neck, and whole body using a Hologic QDR\n4500 (Hologic Corp, Madison, WI, USA). The short-\nterm in vivo precision expressed as the coefficient of\nvariation was 1.8% for the lumbar spine and 1.5% for\nthe hip. The machine was standardized by standard\nphantom before each measurement.\nThe densitometer provided a T-score for each mea-\nsured site. In this paper, the T-score is referred to as\nTDXA\n. We used the WHO criteria to categorize TDXA\ninto\nthree groups: osteoporosis if the T-score is equal to or\nlower than -2.5; osteopenia if T-score is between -1 and\n-2.5; and normal if T-score is equal or greater than -1.\nDetermination of reference range\nIn this analysis, we made use of the functional relation-\nship between BMD and age to construct a reference\nrange. A series of polynomial regression models (up to\nthe third degree) were fitted to femoral neck, total hip\nand lumbar spine BMD as a function of age as follows:\nBMD = a + b1\n(age) + b2\n(age)3, where a is\nthe intercept, b1\nare regression parameters,\nwhich were estimated from the observed data. Reduced\nmodels (i.e., quadratic and linear models) were consid-\nered, and the \"final\" model was chosen based on the\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC). Peak BMD (pBMD)\nand ages at which it was reached were then estimated\nfrom the final model. Ninety-five percent confidence\nintervals (95% CI) for pBMD and ages of pBMD were\ndetermined by the bootstrap (resampling) method. The\nanalysis was performed with R statistical software [12].\nBased on the parameters in the polynomial regression\nmodels, we determined the means of peak BMD and\nstandard deviation (SD) for spine and femoral neck\nBMD. Using the two parameters, we calculated the\nT-score for each individual (denoted by TVN\n), and used\nthe WHO criteria to classify the T-score into three\ngroups, namely, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal.\nThe concordance between TDXA\nand TVN\nwas then\nassessed by the kappa statistic.\nResults\naged 18 years or older participated in the study. In this\n50+ years, respectively. As expected, BMD in men was\nhigher than in women by ~12% at femoral neck and by\n~7% at lumbar spine (Table 1).\nPeak bone mineral density\nThe relationship between BMD and age was best\ndescribed by the third-degree polynomial regression\nmodel (Figures 1 and 2). The relationship was character-\nized by three phases, namely, BMD increased between\nthe ages of 18 and 25, followed by a steady period (aged\nbetween 25 and 45), and then gradually declined after\nthe age of 45. The age-related decrease in BMD in\nwomen was greater than that in men. For example,\ncompared with lumbar spine BMD among women aged\nbetween 20-30 years, lumbar spine BMD among women\naged 70+ years was decreased by 27%; however, in men,\nthe corresponding rate of decrease was ~15%. A similar\nsex-differential decline was also observed in femoral\nneck BMD.\nBased on the parameters of the polynomial regression\nmodel (Table 2), we estimated pBMD and the age of\npBMD for men and women (Table 3). Consistently,\npBMD was higher in men compared with women, but\nthe difference was dependent on skeletal site.

For\nexample, at the femoral neck, age of pBMD in women\nobserved at the lumbar spine (25 in women and\nPrevalence of osteoporosis\nBased on pBMD and SD, T-scores were calculated for\nmen aged 50+ years or post-menopausal women, and\nthese were referred to as TVN\n, to differentiate with TDXA\nwhich was automatically provided by the densitometer\n(Table 4). In women aged over 50 years, TVN\nwas higher\nthan TDXA\nthe same trend also was also found at the femoral neck\nAs expected, although absolute values of TVN\nand\nTDXA\nwere different, the correlation between them was\nhigh (r > 0.98). The linear equation (without intercept)\nlinking the two scores is as follows: at the femoral neck,\nTVN\nfor women, and TVN\nTDXA\nfor men; at the lumbar spine, TVN\nfor men. The\nequations suggest that, for example, at the femoral neck,\nTVN\nwas higher than TDXA\nSD (in women).\nThe concordance between two diagnoses of osteo-\nporosis (i.e., TVN\nand TDXA\n) is shown in Table 5.

In women aged 50+ years, using femoral neck\nTVN\n, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 28.6%, but\nwhen the diagnosis was based on TDXA\n, the prevalence\n-based pre-\nvalence of osteoporosis was 10.4%, which was only a-\nthird of the TDXA\n-based prevalence (29.6%). The discre-\npancy mainly occurred in the osteopenic group. For\nexample, among 40 men diagnosed by TDXA\nto have\nosteoporosis, there was 65% of them (n = 26) were actu-\nally identified as having osteopenia by TVN\n.

Currently, osteoporosis is operationally\ndefined in terms of BMD, which is compared to a nor-\nmative database [5]. However, it is well known that\nFigure 1 Relationship between age and bone density at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine for men.\nFigure 2 Relationship between age and bone density at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine for women.\nmeasured values of BMD differ across ethnicities\n[9,11,14], and the referent database should therefore be\nethnicity-specific. In this study, we have shown that\nthere was a considerable discrepancy in the diagnosis of\nosteoporosis between referent data derived from the\nlocal population and referent data that are provided by\nthe densitometer.\nIt is clear from this analysis that the densitometer\nreference data over-diagnosed osteoporosis in the Viet-\nnamese population.

These data\nalso suggest that the densitometer-provided T-score is\nnot appropriate for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in\nVietnamese women.\nWhy there were differences between TVN\nand TDXA\n?\nThe most \"proximate\" explanation is that there were dif-\nferences in peak BMD and standard deviation between\nTable 2 Estimates of parameters of the third degree\npolynomial regression model\nBone mineral density Parameters R2 SEE\nFemoral neck\nTotal hip\nLumbar spine\nValues are coefficient (standard error) of the model BMD = a + b1\nage +\nR2, coefficient of determination indicates the proportion of variance in BMD\nthat could be \"explained\" by the polynomial model; SEE, Standard error of\nestimate.\nTable 3 Peak bone mineral density (pBMD) and age of\npBMD in men and women\npBMD (g/cm2)a Age of pBMD (years)b\nMen\nWomen\nValues are amean (standard deviation) and bmean (95% confidence interval)\nTable 4 Prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in\nmen and women aged 50+ years\nMen Women\nTDXA\nTVN\nTDXA\nTV\nFemoral neck\nTotal hip\nLumbar spine\nData are actual number of individuals in each subgroup, and percentage of\nsex-specific total.\nTable 5 Concordance in diagnosis of osteoporosis\nbetween DXA provided T-scores and actual T-scores\nDiagnosis based on Diagnosis based on femoral neck TVN\nfemoral neck TDXA\nNormal Osteopenia Osteoporosis\nMen\nWomen\nValues are shown as number of individuals in each subgroup, and percentage\nthe Hologic normative data and the present normative\ndata. However, the standard deviation in BMD is very\nstable across populations; therefore, the main reason\ncould be that peak BMD value provided by the Hologic\ndensitometer was higher than peak BMD in Vietnamese.\nAssuming that SD of femoral neck BMD was 0.12 g/\ncm2, with TDXA\n, one could infer that peak BMD was\nThese values are identical to the femoral neck BMD\nreference values for US White men and women of the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES)[13].

It is obvious that the peak BMD provided by\nthe densitometer was derived from a non-Vietnamese\npopulation, which may not be applicable to the Vietna-\nmese population.\nIn this study, the relationship between BMD and age\nfollowed a third degree polynomial function, which is\nconsistent with a recent study [15]. According to this\nfunctional relationship, Vietnamese women achieved\ntheir peak BMD at the age of 27-29, which was later\nthan that in Caucasian (20-25 years). Although it is not\npossible to determine the underlying factors for this\napparent difference, it is well-known that Asian girls\ntend to have a later menarche than Caucasian girls (13\nOsteoporosis in men, particularly Asian men, has not\nbeen well documented. The present study was among\nthe first research about osteoporosis in Asian men. In\nthis study, about one tenth of men aged over 50 had\nosteoporosis. This prevalence is highly comparable with\nprevious estimate from Caucasian men [19]. Individuals\nwith osteoporosis are at high risk of fragility fracture\nwomen (and 10% of men) aged 50+ years had osteo-\nporosis, implying that the magnitude of osteoporosis in\nVietnam is as high as in developed countries.\nThe present results have to be interpreted within the\ncontext of strengths and potential limitations. First, the\nstudy represents one of the largest studies of osteo-\nporosis in Asian populations, and as such, it increased\nthe reliability of estimates of peak bone mass and pre-\nvalence of osteoporosis. Second, the study population\nis highly homogeneous, which reduces the effects of\npotential confounders that could compromise the esti-\nmates. The participants were randomly selected\naccording to a rigorous sampling scheme, which\nensures the representativeness of the general popula-\ntion. Third, the technique of measurement of BMD is\nconsidered \"gold standard\" for the assessment of bone\nstrength. Nevertheless, the study also has a number of\npotential weaknesses. The participants in this study\nwere sampled from an urban population; as a result,\nthe study's finding may not be generalizable to the\nrural population. Because we excluded individuals with\ndiseases deemed to interfere with bone metabolism,\nthe prevalence of osteoporosis reported here could be\nan underestimate of the prevalence in the general\npopulation. Ideally, peak bone density should be esti-\nmated from a longitudinal study in which a large num-\nber of men and women is followed from the age of 5\ntill the age of 30, but such a study is not practically\nfeasible. On the other hand, estimate of peak BMD in\ncross-sectional study such as the present study can be\nbiased by unmeasured confounders.\nNevertheless, the present findings have important\npublic health and clinical implications. Because indivi-\nduals with T-scores being or less than -2.5 are often\ntreated, the over-diagnosis by TDXA\ncould have led to\nover-treatment in the general population. Moreover,\nindividuals with T-scores being or less than -2.5 are also\ncandidates for anti-fracture clinical trials or clinical stu-\ndies, the use of TDXA\ncould have included some women\nin such studies and exposed them to unnecessary risk.\nThus, it seems prudent to use local normative data for\nthe diagnosis of osteoporosis in order to avoid over-\ndiagnosis or over-treatment.\nConclusion\nIn summary, these data suggest that the prevalence of\nosteoporosis in Vietnamese men (10%) and women\n(30%) aged 50+ years is comparable with those in\nCaucasian populations. The data also indicated that the\nT-score provided by the Hologic QDR4500 over-diag-\nnosed osteoporosis in Vietnamese men and women. We\npropose to use the data developed in this study for the\ndiagnosis of osteoporosis in the Vietnamese population.\n"
