In a\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES), detectable levels of\nperchlorate were found in the urine of all\n2,820 U.S. residents assessed (Blount et al.\nNHANES data also identified an association\nbetween urinary levels of perchlorate and\ndecreased levels of serum thyroxine (T4\n) in\nwomen with urinary iodine concentrations\nable feature of this finding is that it was iden-\ntified at perchlorate concentrations much\nlower than those linked to thyroid effects in\nany previous study. In fact, NHANES was\ndesigned to provide a nationally representa-\ntive sample. Thus, the perchlorate exposure\nlevels of the subjects in this study are likely\nsimilar to exposures occurring in a large por-\ntion of the U.S. population.

Miller, and Robert Howd\nOffice of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, California Environmental Protection Agency, Oakland, California, USA\nBACKGROUND: Findings from a recent large study suggest that perchlorate at commonly occur-\nring exposure concentrations may decrease thyroid hormone levels in some women. Decreases in\nthyroid hormone seen with perchlorate exposure could be even greater in people with concomi-\ntant exposure to agents such as thiocyanate that may affect the thyroid by mechanisms similar to\nthose of perchlorate.\nOBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey to assess the impact of smoking and thiocyanate on the relationship between urinary per-\nchlorate and serum thyroxine (T4\n) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\nRESULTS: In women with urinary iodine levels < 100 \u00b5g/L, the association between the logarithm of\nperchlorate and decreased T4\nthan in nonsmokers ( = \u00ad0.54, p = 0.04). In subjects with high, medium, and low cotinine levels,\n\u00ad0.49 (p = 0.11). Clear interactions between perchlorate and smoking were not seen with TSH or\nin women with urinary iodine levels  100 \u00b5g/L or in men.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that thiocyanate in tobacco smoke and perchlorate interact in\naffecting thyroid function, and this effect can take place at commonly occurring perchlorate expo-\nsures. Agents other than tobacco smoke might cause similar interactions, and further research on\nthese agents could help identify people who are particularly susceptible to perchlorate.\nKEY WORDS: cotinine, interactions, iodine, perchlorate, thiocyanate, thyroid, tobacco smoke.\npostmenopausal status (based on self-report,\ntime since last period, and presence or absence\nof other reasons for missed menstruation),\npremenarche status (self-report), serum c-reac-\ntive protein (milligrams per deciliter), hours of\nfasting before serum collection (self-report),\nurinary nitrate (micrograms per liter), current\nlactation (dichotomous based on self-report),\nand use of medications known to affect the\nthyroid (e.g., levothyroxine, methimazole,\npropylthiouracil, beta blockers, and estrogens)\n(dichotomous based on self-reported use). A\ndescription of the possible impacts these vari-\nables may have on the relationship between\nperchlorate and thyroid function has been\non self-reported smoking status was provided\nin two separate sections, the questionnaire\nand the medical examination component\n(MEC). For the study presented here, sub-\njects were divided into four groups: current\nsmokers, recent former smokers, long-term\nformer smokers, and never-smokers. Current\nsmokers were defined as those who reported\nthat they smoked cigarettes at the time of the\nsurvey (questionnaire) or reported that they\nhad smoked at least 20 cigarettes in the pre-\nceding 30 days (MEC). Never-smokers were\ndefined as those who reported that they had\nnot smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life\n(questionnaire) or that they had never tried\ncigarette smoking (MEC). Recent former\nsmokers were defined as those who quit\nsmoking within 12 months of the survey.\nLong-term former smokers were defined as\nthose who quit > 12 months before the sur-\nvey. Because no difference between long-term\nformer smokers and never-smokers was found\nin the association between T4\nor TSH and\nperchlorate, these two groups were combined\ninto one group labeled \"nonsmokers\" for this\nstudy. Because the latency of the impact of\ntobacco smoke on thyroid function is\nunknown, all recent former smokers were\nexcluded from analyses comparing smokers\nand nonsmokers. Approximately 10% of the\nsubjects did not provide adequate informa-\ntion to assess smoking status. Few women\nwere regular users of cigars, chewing tobacco,\nor snuff, and excluding regular users of these\nproducts had no impact on the analyses.\nThe methods used to collect and perform\nlaboratory analyses of perchlorate, iodine, T4\n,\nTSH, cotinine, and thiocyanate, and the qual-\nity control procedures involved in NHANES\n(National Center for Health Statistics 2002).\nBriefly, serum samples collected in 2001 were\nassayed for TSH using a microparticle\nimmunoassay and for T4\nchemistry analyzer (Hitachi Chemical\nDiagnostics, Mountain View, CA).

Urine samples\nwere analyzed for perchlorate, thiocyanate,\nand nitrate using ion chromatography tandem\nmass spectrometry (Blount 2006b). Iodine\nwas analyzed using inductively coupled plasma\nmass spectrometry (National Center for\nBlount et al.

The urinary iodine stratification\nlevel of 100 \u00b5g/L was selected by Blount et al.\nbecause the World Health Organization\n(WHO) has defined populations with median\nurinary iodine excretion > 100 \u00b5g/L as having\nsufficient intake (WHO 1994). This stratifi-\ncation level was chosen for the analyses pre-\nsented here for the same reason and so that\nour results could be compared more directly\nWe assessed serum cotinine in this study\nbecause it is a metabolite of nicotine and may\nbe a more accurate indicator of current smok-\ning status than self-reported smoking (Wells\net al. 1998). We categorized cotinine concen-\ntrations into three levels for this study. Serum\ncotinine levels > 10 ng/mL were classified as\nhigh, whereas levels below the detection level\nof 0.015 ng/mL were classified as low. All lev-\nels between these cutoff points were classified\nas medium. Using a cutoff of 15 ng/mL to\ndefine the high cotinine category had little\nimpact on our results. Thiocyanate categories\nwere based on the sex-specific tertiles.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with\nSAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)\nusing SAS procedures surveyreg, %sregsub,\nand surveymeans. The following model was\nor log TSH = intercept + 1\n(log per-\nchlorate) + 2\n(log creatinine) + 3\n(iodine cate-\n(iodine category \u00d7 log perchlorate) +\n(smoking category) + 6\n(smoking category\n\u00d7 log perchlorate) + n\n(n = other potential\nconfounding variables). In this model iodine\ncategory is defined as < 100 \u00b5g/L or not, and\nsmoking category is defined either as current\nversus nonsmokers or as classes of cotinine or\nthiocyanate as defined above. The model\nallows estimates of the effect of smoking cate-\ngory and the interaction of perchlorate with\nsmoking category, after adjustment for creati-\nnine and iodine category. Similarly, estimates\nof the effect of iodine category and the interac-\ntion of iodine category with perchlorate are\nmade after adjustment for creatinine and\nsmoking category. Initially, we performed uni-\nvariate analyses to assess the relationship\nbetween urinary perchlorate, all potential\ncovariates, and serum T4\nand log TSH. We\nalso performed univariate analyses and data\nplots to identify outliers and to assess distribu-\ntions. Variables such as urinary perchlorate,\nurinary creatinine, and serum TSH were log\n10-transformed to normalize distributions. In\nanalyses involving surveymeans, urinary per-\nchlorate residuals adjusted for creatinine were\ncalculated using the method described by\nInitial univariate and multivariate analyses\nshowed no clear evidence of interaction among\nsmoking, cotinine, thiocyanate, and urinary\nperchlorate on serum T4\nor log TSH levels in\nmen or in women with urinary iodine levels\n> 100 \u00b5g/L, so we focus on women with uri-\nnary iodine < 100 \u00b5g/L. Women who reported\na history of thyroid disease or use of thyroid\nmedications were excluded. Two women with\nvery high serum TSH levels (43 and 68 IU/L)\nand one woman with a very high serum T4\nlevel (27 \u00b5g/dL) were also excluded.\nWe constructed separate regression mod-\nels for serum T4\nand log TSH as the depen-\ndent variables. Model building followed the\ngeneral principles presented by Hosmer and\nLemeshow (2000). Independent variables that\nwere associated with T4\nor log TSH with\np < 0.20 were added to and retained in the\nmodel that included the log perchlorate and\nlog creatinine. Excluded variables were added\nback to the model one at a time to assure that\nthey did not have important impacts on the\nperchlorate regression coefficient.\nResults\n, serum TSH,\nand urinary perchlorate, iodine, and creati-\nnine.

Our\nindependent analysis of the same raw data\nconfirms these findings and has also found\nthat in women with low urinary iodine, the\nassociation between urinary perchlorate and\ndecreased serum T4\nis stronger in smokers\nthan in nonsmokers and stronger in those\nwith high urinary thiocyanate levels than in\nthose with low thiocyanate levels. These find-\nings provide evidence that perchlorate at rela-\ntively low levels can interact with tobacco\nsmoke or thiocyanate to diminish iodine\nuptake and decrease thyroid function. The\nlarge magnitude of the differences identified\nsuggest that these findings are not owing to\nchance, and the finding of similar effects\nacross different measures of exposure (i.e.,\nself-reported smoking, serum cotinine, and\nurinary thiocyanate) provides further evidence\nthat these results represent true effects.\nThe findings identified in this study are\nbiologically plausible. That is, they are consis-\ntent with the mechanisms by which perchlo-\nrate, iodine, and thiocyanate are known to\naffect thyroid function. Perchlorate competi-\ntively inhibits the sodium iodide symporter\n(NIS), the membrane protein that actively\ntransports iodide into the thyroid follicular cell\nfor thyroid hormone production (Stanbury\n1952). Sufficient suppression of iodide uptake\ncan diminish production of thyroid hormone.\nSmoking has been linked to increases in vari-\nous thyroid diseases (Vestergaard 2002),\nalthough data on the relationship between\nsmoking and serum levels of thyroid hor-\nmones have been mixed (Bertelsen and\nSmoking, perchlorate, and thyroid hormones\nTable 2.

Comparing mean T4\n(\u00b5g/dL) and the loga-\nrithm of TSH (IU/L) values in groups of women.\nGroup 1: Current smokers, perchlorate residual (\u00b5g/L)\n> median, and urinary iodine < 100 \u00b5g/L. Group 2: Never-\nsmokers, perchlorate residual (\u00b5g/L)  median, and urinary\niodine  100 \u00b5g/L. Urinary perchlorate residuals are\nadjusted for creatinine using the method described by\nHegedus 1994). Smoking does increase serum\nlevels of thiocyanate (Foss and Lund-Larsen\n1986), which, like perchlorate, also competi-\ntively inhibits the NIS (Tonacchera et al.\n2004). Thiocyanate has also been shown to\nincrease the risk for development of goiter,\nboth in those with moderate to severe iodine\ndeficiency (< 50 \u00b5g/g creatinine) and in those\nwithin the lower range of adequate iodine\nintake (100 \u00b5g/g creatinine) (Brauer et al.\n2006). Based on their common effects, it is\nnot surprising that thiocyanate from smoking\ncould interact with perchlorate to inhibit the\nNIS and subsequently decrease thyroid hor-\nmone production and that this effect would be\ngreater in those with lower iodine levels.\nA remarkable aspect of these findings is\nthat the perchlorate levels in NHANES\nels shown not to affect thyroid function in\nprevious studies. In the 385 women with low\niodine in our study, 50% had urine per-\nchlorate levels < 1.7 \u00b5g/L and 90% had levels\n< 5.7 \u00b5g/L. Several experimental and observa-\ntional studies have reported that perchlorate\nhad no effect on T4\nor TSH levels at exposure\nlevels orders of magnitude higher than the\nmedian levels found in our study (Braverman\nseveral possible explanations for this discrep-\nancy. One is that most previous studies did\nnot evaluate effects in women with low iodine.\nIt is possible that iodine levels must be suf-\nficiently low for environmental levels of\nperchlorate and thiocyanate to overcome com-\npensatory mechanisms that maintain thyroid\nhormone. This is consistent with a previous\nstudy showing that goiters due to the con-\nsumption of thiocyanate in cassava were more\nlikely when iodine levels were low and\nwere reversed with iodine supplementation\n(Delanghe et al. 1982). It is also possible that\nthe effects on T4\nwe identified in women with\nlow urinary iodine also occur in women with\nhigher iodine levels but are less strong and the\nstatistical power to identify them has been too\nlow in most studies. Other possible reasons are\nthat occupational studies have involved pri-\nmarily men and, as was found in our study,\neffects may predominate in women; that\nexperimental studies may have missed effects\nbecause dosing durations were too short; and\nthat ecologic studies may have missed effects\nbecause of the greater misclassification of per-\nchlorate exposure that can occur when expo-\nsure is assessed ecologically rather than\nindividually. We do not know why the effects\nwe identified were seen only in women.\nWomen do have greater incidences of some\niodine-related and other thyroid conditions\n(Laurberg et al. 2000), and estradiol has been\nshown to inhibit TSH-stimulated expression\nof the sodium\u00adiodide symporter in rats\n(Furlanetto et al. 1999). It is possible that\nthese effects may be related to our finding\neffects in women but not in men.\nThe results of this study are based on a\nsingle assessment of urinary perchlorate, uri-\nnary iodine, and serum thyroid hormones.\nPrevious studies have shown that after short-\nterm perchlorate administration in humans,\nmost perchlorate is excreted in the urine\nand Arefaeva 1986). Other studies have shown\nthat thyroid hormone levels, especially TSH,\nand iodine levels can have marked intraindi-\nvidual variability over time (Hollowell et al.\nability and the relatively short half-life of per-\nchlorate, single measurements of these analytes\nmight not reflect true long-term levels.\nAnother issue that could lead to misclassifica-\ntion is that serum T4\nwas measured as total T4\nrather than as free T4\n(the physiologically\navailable form). Importantly, though, biologic\nlected and analyzed similarly in all subjects,\nindependent of perchlorate, thyroid, iodine, or\nsmoking status. Thus, any misclassification of\nthese exposure or outcome variables is likely to\nbe nondifferential, and therefore likely to bias\nestimates of association toward the null, not\ntoward the positive effects identified in this\nThe presence of certain factors such as\nestrogen use, the presence of thyroid disease,\nexercise, menstruation disturbances, or\nantithyroid antibodies could potentially con-\nfound the association between perchlorate and\nthyroid hormone levels. However, confound-\ning variables must be related to both the expo-\nsure and the outcome. Because many of the\nvariables linked to serum thyroid hormone\nlevels are not necessarily associated with uri-\nnary perchlorate concentrations, they are not\nlikely to be confounding variables in our\nanalyses. Some variables could be associated\nwith both thyroid hormone levels and urinary\nperchlorate and therefore could have acted as\nconfounders. However, many potential con-\nfounders were controlled for either by adjust-\ning for them in the analyses (e.g., estrogen use)\nor by applying restriction criteria (e.g., exclud-\ning subjects with known thyroid disease).\nThe presence of antithyroid antibodies is a\nrisk factor for hypothyroidism and decreased\n, but were not measured in NHANES\nanalyses. The actual impact of this is unknown.\nHowever, an analysis of a previous NHANES\ndata set (NHANES III) found that antithyroid\nantibodies were less prevalent in smokers\n(11%) than in nonsmokers (18%) (Belin et al.\n2004). This suggests that, based on antithyroid\nantibody status alone, smokers would tend to\nhave higher T4\nlevels than nonsmokers. In the\nstudy reported here, we found somewhat of\nthe opposite effect. That is, we found that per-\nchlorate was associated with decreased T4\n, and\nthe strength of this decrease was greater in\nsmokers than in nonsmokers. This suggests\nthat if we were able to account for antithyroid\nantibodies in our analyses, this could actually\nstrengthen, not weaken, the associations we\nidentified for smoking.\nThe results of some of our analyses are\nslightly different than those reported by\nBlount et al. (2006a), although the results of\nthese two studies are close and the differences\nhave no impact on the conclusions drawn\nfrom either study. Our analysis was done\nindependently from Blount et al., so these dif-\nferences are likely related to differences in the\ndefinitions and categorization of some vari-\nables (e.g., postmenopause or premenarche\nstatus), the use of different statistical pro-\ngrams, and different methods of selecting\nindependent variables to remain in the final\nregression models. Despite these differences,\nthe results of these two studies are similar. For\nexample, for women with low urinary iodine\nthe adjusted regression coefficient between log\nperchlorate and serum T4\n362) in this study. The similarity of these\nresults, despite different statistical methods\nand independent analyses, supports the valid-\nity of the methods used in both studies.\ncals, is associated with many abnormalities of\nthyroid function likely occurring via multiple\nfound evidence of interaction between smok-\ning and perchlorate on reducing serum T4\nlevels, no clear interaction was seen on TSH.\nAs seen in Table 2, the magnitudes of the\nregression coefficients between log perchlorate\nand log TSH were similar in nonsmokers and\nsmokers, suggesting that the impacts of per-\nchlorate on TSH are similar regardless of\nsmoking status. In many conditions, suppres-\nsion of T4\nis accompanied by a compensatory\nrise in serum TSH. However, this is not\nalways the case. For example, iodine defi-\nciency is characterized by decreases in serum\nwith normal or slightly elevated levels of\nserum triiodothyronine (T3\n) and normal lev-\nels of serum TSH (Obregon et al. 2005). It\nhas been shown that with iodine deficiency\nis deiodinated to T3\nBased on this, it has been suggested that\nalthough iodine deficiency may cause a\ndecrease in serum T4\nlevels, an associated\nincrease in T3\nexerts a negative feedback lim-\niting any compensatory rise in TSH (Maruta\nand Greer 1988). This could explain why we\nfound clear differences across smoking, coti-\nnine, and thiocyanate categories for T4\nbut\nnot for TSH.\nSteinmaus et al.\nThere are other possible reasons why we\nfound less effect on TSH. For example, a pre-\nvious NHANES survey found that smokers\nhad lower TSH levels than nonsmokers, pos-\nsibly related to the greater prevalence of\nserum thyroid autoantibodies among non-\nsmokers (Belin et al. 2004). Although the\ndata from other studies regarding the impacts\nof smoking and thyroid function have been\nmixed (Hegedus et al. 1985; Muller et al.\n1984), it is possible that smoking causes an\noverall suppression of TSH that counter-\nbalances any TSH stimulation caused by\nreductions in serum T4\n. Another reason why\neffects on TSH may not be found is that\nintra- and interindividual variability is gener-\nally much greater for serum TSH than for\n, and this variability diminished the\nability of this study to identify associations\nwith a single assessment of TSH.\nThe public health significance of this\nstudy lies in a) the large number of people in\nthe United States who appear to be exposed to\nperchlorate, b) the large number of women\nwith low iodine levels, c) the variety of factors\nthat can inhibit the sodium iodide symporter,\nand, d) the potential importance of relatively\nsmall changes in thyroid hormone levels. With\nregard to perchlorate exposure, NHANES was\ndesigned to provide information on a nation-\nally representative level. Thus, the perchlorate\nexposure levels of the subjects in this study are\nsupposed to represent those in the large major-\nity of people in the United States. Although\nstatistically significant findings in this study\nwere seen only in women with urinary iodine\nlevels < 100 \u00b5g/L, this group represents a large\nfraction of the U.S. and world population. In\nImportantly, our findings may not be rele-\nvant just for smokers. We did find effects on\nTSH in both smokers and non-smokers. In\naddition, we found a borderline statistically sig-\nnificant effect on T4\nin nonsmokers and a sta-\ntistically significant effect in subjects with\nurinary cotinine levels associated with environ-\nmental tobacco smoke exposure (i.e., our\nmedium cotinine category). Also, thiocyanate\nnot only results from smoking but also is\npresent in various foods including cruciferous\nvegetables and cassava. Elevated levels of thio-\ncyanate have been noted in the milk of cows\nthat were fed rapeseed (a member of the\nCruciferae family), with resulting decreases in\niodine in milk presumably from inhibition of\nthe sodium\u00adiodide symporter expressed in the\nlactating breast (Laurberg et al. 2002).\nSimilarly, iodine levels in breast milk are\ndecreased in human mothers who smoke\n(Laurberg et al. 2004). Other chemicals known\nto inhibit the thyroid sodium\u00adiodide sym-\nporter include nitrates [which are estimated to\ncontaminate 22% of domestic wells through-\nout the United States above the U.S. EPA\nmaximum concentration limit (Ward et al.\n2005)] and iodine in excess (Riesco-Eizaguirre\nand Santisteban 2006; Wolff and Chaikoff\n1948). In vitro data have shown that perchlo-\nrate, nitrates, and thiocyanate may have addi-\ntive effects on inhibiting the sodium\u00adiodide\nsymporter (Tonacchera et al. 2004). In prelim-\ninary analyses, we did not find evidence of\nstrong associations between urinary nitrate lev-\nels and thyroid function or clear interactions\nwith perchlorate. Whether this may be caused\nby the use of urinary nitrate rather than serum\nor dietary nitrate, differences between in vivo\nand in vitro effects, or some other reason is\nunknown and requires investigation beyond\nthe scope of this paper. Regardless, the in vitro\ndata on the interactions between these agents,\ncombined with our findings regarding thio-\ncyanate, provide some evidence that the effect\nof perchlorate on thyroid function can be\nincreased in people exposed to similarly acting\nagents. A previous concern about the interpre-\ntation of the report by Blount et al. (2006a)\nwas that they identified associations with per-\nchlorate but not with other goitrogens\n(American Thyroid Association 2006). The\nstudy reported here adds importantly to the\nevaluation of the NHANES data by showing\nthat other goitrogens, specifically thiocyanate\nand smoking, can also affect thyroid function.\nThe effects we identified, although rela-\ntively small, could have important implica-\ntions in people who have borderline low T4\nlevels for reasons other than exposure to per-\nchlorate. In these potentially susceptible sub-\ngroups, additional reduction in T4\nlevels\ncaused by perchlorate could increase their risks\nof developing signs or symptoms of hypothy-\nroidism. Some research indicates that even\nsmall decrements in maternal free T4\n)\nduring the first trimester, including those\nwithin what is generally considered the \"nor-\nmal\" range (lowest 10%), can be associated\nwith impaired neuropsychologic development\nin the child (Haddow et al. 1999; Kooistra\nthat any exposure that would result in altered\nproduction or utilization of fT4\nshould be\nconsidered a potentially detrimental effect.\nSizable subpopulations for which underlying\nlevels may be low or borderline include\nwomen with iodine deficiency or thyroid per-\noxidase antibodies. These women constitute a\nlarge subpopulation potentially sensitive to the\nadditional burdens of thiocyanate (from\nsmoking or diet) and perchlorate.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study suggest that thio-\ncyanate and smoking can have marked\nimpacts on the association between perchlor-\nate, iodine uptake in the thyroid, and the\nproduction of T4\n. The results also provide an\nexample of how an environmental chemical\nexposure could potentially interact with nutri-\ntional and lifestyle factors, including smoking,\niodine sufficiency, and thiocyanate intake, to\naffect an important health outcome. In a time\nwhen chemical risk assessments are under\nmandate to identify and protect susceptible\nsubpopulations, this study illustrates the need\nto evaluate interactions of not only chemicals\nbut lifestyle choices, nutritional status, med-\nications, and other factors. The results of this\nand other studies suggest that thyroidal effects\nof perchlorate are seen at commonly occur-\nring perchlorate levels and fairly common\niodine levels, and therefore could be affecting\na large segment of the U.S. population.\nFurther research is needed to confirm these\nfindings and to identify other groups who\nmay be particularly susceptible to the health\neffects of perchlorate, and information on\nthese groups should be incorporated into\npublic health policies aimed at preventing\nperchlorate toxicity.\nREFERENCES\nAmerican Thyroid Association. 2006.
