Journal of European\nThe growth of the older adult population, increased preva-\nlence of chronic diseases, higher rates of survival among\npeople with disabilities, and high costs of institutional\ncare have forced millions of individuals into stressful roles\nof providing care for ill or disabled family members (Talley\n& Crews, 2007). Caring for an ill family member consumes\na huge amount of energy, time, and money over poten-\ntially long periods of time. Due to the consuming nature of\nthe caring task, caregiving can be psychologically stressful\nand exhausting, (Pruchno, Kleban, Michaels, & Dempsey,\n1000 caregivers indicated that nearly half of the respond-\nents reported that their health was negatively affected by\ntheir caregiving role. Comparable results were found in\na survey by Carers UK (2002) where the most common\nnegative emotions reported by caregivers were feelings of\nbeing mentally, emotionally, and physically drained.\nResearch has demonstrated that racial and ethnic differ-\nences exist within the level of psychological distress expe-\nrienced by caregivers. For example, Hilgeman et al. (2009)\nfound that a sample of Caucasian caregivers reported\nmore psychological stress when compared to African\nAmerican caregivers. A number of socio-demographic fac-\ntors including age, gender, socioeconomic status and the\ntype and quality of the caregiver relationship have been\nidentified as contributing to caregivers stress. The effect of\nall of the socio-demographic variables mentioned above\non the caregiver's quality of life is unclear as findings from\nprevious studies have been mixed (Wilder, Oliver, Demiris,\n& Washington, 2008). A study conducted by Carter, Lewin,\nRashid, Adams, and Clover (2008) indicated that enhanced\nquality of life for caregivers was correlated with caregivers\nwho were married to the care recipient, male, older, and\nhad achieved a minimum of a high school education. The\nage of the caregiver was found to have an impact on the\ncaregiver's stress where younger caregivers are more likely\nto experience caregiver stress. Pinquart and Sorenson's\n(2007) study found that there was a higher rate of depres-\nsion in older caregivers but a higher prevalence of anxi-\nety in younger caregivers. This was believed to be due\nto fewer external coping resources such as money and\ntime for older caregivers but more competing roles such\nas jobs and other caregiving responsibilities for younger\ncaregivers.\nDifferences in the stressors associated with caregiving\nhave been identified for caring for a person with a psy-\nchological illness and caring for a person with a physical\nillness. Research conducted by Teri et al. (1992) demon-\nstrated that the care of an older relative with both demen-\ntia and depression was associated with higher levels of\nburden compared to caregivers of a relative with a physi-\ncal illness such as heart disease. A survey conducted by\nthe National Association for Caregiving and the American\nAssociation of Retired Persons (AARP, 2004) with a large\nsample of over 1500 caregiving families found that when\ncompared with caregivers of physically disabled older\nadults, caregivers of relatives with dementia provided\nmore assistance and reported that providing care was\nmore stressful, impacted more on time spent with their\nother family members, and had a higher rate of work\nrelated difficulties.\nThe Impact of Caregiving on the Development of Major\nDepressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nEve Markey*\njournal of european\npsychology students\nefpsa\n* Department of Psychology, University of Ulster, Londonderry,\nNorthern Ireland\neve.markey@gmail.com\nProviding care for a relative is associated with psychological distress and a higher prevalence of\npsychological disorders. This study investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders\namong the caregiving population. The study was based on data drawn from the Collaborative Psychiatric\nEpidemiology Surveys (CPES). Binary logistic regressions were conducted to examine these associations\nand to identify factors influencing the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. The analysis\nindicated that respondents providing care for a relative were at a higher risk of developing a psychological\ndisorder. A number of socio-demographic variables were identified as increasing the risk of developing a\npsychological disorder such as being younger, female and divorced. The findings highlight the importance\nof support and interventions for family caregivers.\nKeywords: Caregiving; Psychological Distress; Anxiety/Depressive disorders; CPES\nMarkey: Impact of Caregiving on Psychological Disorders\nPeople caring for a relative with a mental or physical ill-\nness face both similarities and unique characteristics in\nrelation to the task of caregiving, influencing the experi-\nenced level of burden. For example, due to the nature of a\nmental illness, caregivers may experience periods of well-\nness followed by periods of illness at a more frequent level\nthan people with a physical illness (Seltzer, Greenberg,\nFloyd, & Hong, 2004). Furthermore, caregivers to peo-\nple with a mental illness also have to deal with a stigma\nthat may be associated with a mental illness. The cyclical\nnature of a mental illness coupled with the stigma experi-\nenced by caregivers could result in caregivers of mentally\nill people experiencing a higher level of caregiver stress\nMost previous research has been based on a small sam-\nple size of caregivers who are providing care for people\nwith specific illnesses such as dementia or heart disease.\nThese studies due to their sample sizes cannot be general-\nised to the population. Our study is one of a few epidemi-\nological studies conducted within the area of caregiving.\nPast research has focused primarily on the impact of car-\negiving on the caregivers' levels of depression. Few studies\nhave examined the effect of caregiving on the caregivers'\nlevels of anxiety. Therefore, this study has extended the\nscope of previous research by looking at these aspects.\nIn order to overcome the deficits of previous research,\nthe primary aim of this study is to investigate the preva-\nlence of both depression and anxiety disorders, among\nindividuals caring for a relative with either a physical or\na psychological illness. A secondary aim of this study is to\ninvestigate the impact of several mediating variables such\nas demographic and socio-economic status on the devel-\nopment of caregivers' psychological disorders. In order to\nachieve the aims, this study has three main hypotheses:\n(1) there will be a higher prevalence of depressive and\nanxiety disorders among people providing care for an ill\nrelative; (2) there will be a higher prevalence of depressive\nand anxiety disorders among people providing care for a\nrelative with a psychological rather than a physical illness;\nand (3) work status, marital status, education, age, and\ngender of the caregiver will significantly affect the likeli-\nhood of developing a depressive or anxiety disorder.\nMethod\nProcedure\nForthepurposeofthisstudy,thepublicversionoftheCPES\nwas downloaded (Alegria, Jackson, Kessler, & Takeuchi,\n2008). We examined the original data for the relevant\nvariables for the prevalence of depressive and anxiety\ndisorders within the past 12 months as well as socioeco-\nnomic and demographic status. The data chosen from the\noriginal National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative\nPsychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (NIMH-CPES) data set\nwere then extracted and recoded to allow conclusions to\nbe drawn on the hypotheses raised in this paper. Ethical\napproval for the current study, using secondary data anal-\nysis, was obtained from the Psychology (Magee) Research\nGovernance Filter Committee at the University of Ulster.\nSample\nThe NIMH-CPES sample was based on a multistage clus-\ntered area probability sample of the US population. The\nsample consisted of 20,013 American citizens. The mean\nage of the sample was 43.38. The sample was representa-\ntive of the US population and also racially and ethnically\ndiverse. Therefore, the results of these findings include\ndifferent racial and ethnic backgrounds which most pre-\nvious research has failed to consider. Further informa-\ntion on the sample designs can be found in Heeringa et\nal. (2004). Please refer to Table 1 for the main features\nof the sample designs of the Collaborative Psychiatric\nEpidemiology Studies.\nMeasures\nThe CPES surveys were developed under the sponsorship\nof the NIMH (Alegria et al,. 2008). The primary objective\nof CPES was to collect data on the prevalence of men-\ntal disorders, impairments associated with these disor-\nders, and their treatment patterns. The CPES combines\nthree nationally representative surveys: the National\nComorbidity Survey Replication (NCS \u00adR), the National\nSurvey of American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino\nand Asian American Study (NLAAS).\nThe core NIMH-CPES questionnaire was based on the\nWorld Health Organization's (WHO) expanded version of\nSample Design Feature National Comorbidity\nSurvey Replication (NCS-R)\nNational Survey Of\nAmerican Life (NSAL)\nNational Latino and Asian\nAmerican Study (NLAAS)\nSurvey Population Adults aged 18 and over in\nthe United States living in\nhouseholds.\nAfro-Caribbean, African\nAmerican and non-Hispanic\nwhite adults, aged 18 and\nover living in households in\nthe United States.\nLatino and Asian-American adults,\naged 18 and over living in house-\nholds in the United States, Hawaii\nand Alaska\nSample Frame Four-stage national area prob-\nability sample.\nFour-stage national area\nprobability sample with\nspecial supplement for Afro-\nCaribbean adults.\nFour-stage national area probabil-\nity sample with special supple-\nments for adults of Puerto Rican,\nCuban, Chinese, Filipino and\nVietnamese national origin.\nwith eligible respondents.\nwith eligible respondents.\nwith eligible respondents.\nTable 1: Key Features of Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies Sample Designs (CPES).\nMarkey: Impact of Caregiving on Psychological Disorders 19\nthe Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)\ndeveloped for the World Mental Health Survey Initiative,\nthe WMH-CIDI (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). WMH-CIDI is\na fully structured lay-administered diagnostic inter-\nview that generates diagnoses according to definitions\nand criteria of both the International Classification of\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; APA,\n2000) diagnostic systems. The WMH-CIDI interviews were\nadministered using computer-assisted interviewing. CIDI\nvalidity studies indicate that there is a significant associa-\ntion between diagnoses based on data collected by the\nCIDI and diagnoses made by clinicians who re-interview a\nsample of respondents (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). For addi-\ntional information, refer to Kessler and Ustun (2004).\nDisorders\nThe psychological disorders measured in this study are\nmajor depressive disorder (MDE) and generalized anxiety\ndisorder (GAD) as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000).\nIn the National Comorbidity Survey, 58% of patients\ndiagnosed with major depression were found to have an\nanxiety disorder; among these patients, the rate of co-\nmorbidity with Generalized Anxiety Disorder was 17.2%\n(Kessler & Uston, 2004). Based on these high co-morbidity\nrates, the results yielded may have been influenced by\nthe two independent variables in this study being highly\ncorrelated.\nDemographic Variables\nThe following socio-demographic variables were used in\nthe study, sex, age (mean = 43.38), marital status, work\nstatus, and education. The variable marital status included\nthree categories, married, divorced, separated or widowed\nand never married. The variable work status also included\nthree categories, employed, not in the labour force, and\nunemployed. Education included four categories which\nare education greater than or equal to 16 years, educa-\nType of Caregiver\nThe variable caring for a relative with a physical illness\nincluded the following physical illnesses: heart problem,\nmemory problem, mental retardation, physical disabil-\nity, and chronic physical illness. The variable caring for a\nrelative with a psychological illness included the follow-\ning psychological illnesses: drug/alcohol problem, health\nproblem depression, health problem anxiety, health prob-\nlem manic depressive, and health problem other serious\nchronic mental health problem.\nAnalytical Strategy\nCross tabulation analyses were computed to examine the\nassociation between caregiving and depression and anxi-\nety disorders. Binary logistic regressions were conducted\nto assess the impact of a number of factors on the devel-\nopment of depressive and anxiety disorder. The models\ncontained the following predictor variables sex, age, work\nstatus, marital status, years of education, and type of rela-\ntive's illness.\nResults\nents suffered from a depressive and/or an anxiety dis-\ndisorder and 3.2% (n = 646) suffering from an anxiety\n2,239) of respondents provided care for a relative.

Specifically, this\nstudy aimed to decipher whether significant differences\nin the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders\nexisted among caregivers who provide care for a relative\nwith a physical illness and those who provide care for a\nrelative with a psychological illness. A secondary aim of\nthis study was to identify the predictive value of a num-\nber of factors that would impact the likelihood of a per-\nson suffering from a Depressive Disorder or a Generalized\nAnxiety Disorder.

Moreover, a number of risk factors were identi-\nfied as significantly increasing the likelihood of suffering\nfrom a depressive or anxiety disorder.\nSimilar to Cheffings' (2003) research, which indicated\nthat caregivers were negatively impacted by their caregiv-\ning role, the cross tabulation analysis indicated that car-\negivers had a higher rate of depression when compared\nto non-caregivers. The higher prevalence of depressive\ndisorders reported by caregivers is similar to previous\nresearch findings. Schulz et al. (1995), following a meta-\nanalysis, concluded that in almost every study, caregiv-\ners reported an elevated level of depressive symptoms\ncompared to comparison groups. One possible reason\nfor this and similar research findings is that the chronic\nstressors of caregiving can lead to psychological distress\nand the development of psychological disorders such as\ndepression. Genetic predisposition should also be taken\ninto consideration as an alternative explanation for the\nhigher rate of psychological disorders among caregivers.\nIn essence, respondents caring for a relative with a psy-\nchological disorder may be more likely to suffer from a\npsychological disorder due to their genetic vulnerability\nto developing a psychological disorder rather than the\nspecific stressors associated with caregiving.\nContrary to the first hypothesis which stipulated that\ncaregivers would have a higher prevalence of anxiety\ndisorders, the analysis indicated that the prevalence of\nanxiety disorders among caregivers was not statistically\nsignificantly different from non\u00adcaregivers. The findings\nindicated that a statistical significant difference did not\nexist between the group of people providing care for a\nrelative with a psychological illness and the group provid-\ning care for a relative with a physical illness.\nOne reason for the non-significant differences found in\nanxiety disorders and the substantially lower prevalence\nrates of depression disorders as compared to other studies\nlies in the stringent psychiatric measurement used in this\nstudy. Some caregivers may suffer from elevated levels of\npsychological distress but may not meet the threshold for\nthe DSM\u00adIV criteria (APA, 2000). Consequently, a number\nof caregivers may report higher levels of anxiety or depres-\nsive symptoms but may have been excluded from the\nanalysis. As Vitaliano, Young, and Zhang (2006) suggest\nutilising less stringent psychiatric criteria such as dysthy-\nmia disorder may give a more accurate measure of psycho-\nlogical disorders amongst the caregiving population.\nBased on the binary logistic regressions, one can con-\nclude that the likelihood of suffering from a depressive\nor anxiety disorder is significantly increased mainly by\nproviding care for a relative with a psychological illness.\nCaring for a relative with a psychological illness more than\ntripled the likelihood of suffering from a depressive dis-\norder. The odds ratio is lower for anxiety when compared\nto depression disorder; however it is still a substantial\nincrease of 3.5 increments. These findings complement\nprevious research findings. For example, Greenberg,\nSeltzer, and Greenley's (1993) findings suggested that\nmothers caring for an adult child with a mental illness\nsuffer higher levels of psychological distress and caregiver\nburden when compared to mothers of adult children with\nmental retardation.\nThese findings support our third hypothesis which\nstates that people providing care for a relative with a psy-\nchological illness will suffer higher rates of depressive and\nanxiety disorders. One possible reason for these increased\nrates is the precarious nature of a psychological illness. As\nB S.E.

Other contributing factors that may have\ncontributed to these findings are the disruption within\nthe family and social relationships as well as the stigma\naccompanying a mental illness.\nThe level of psychological stress experienced by caregiv-\ners could be dependent on the type of psychological ill-\nness that their relative is experiencing. In order to conduct\nthis analysis, a number of psychological disorders were\ncombined including drug problems and schizophrenia\nto create the variable caring for a relative with a psycho-\nlogical illness. The variation in distress caused by specific\ndisorders may have confounded the results causing psy-\nchological illness to be a significant predictor of anxiety\nand depression disorder. Future research should explore\nthe impact of specific psychological illnesses on the devel-\nopment of a depressive and anxiety disorder.\nThe family burden measure of care recipient's type of\nillness is based on the assumption that each caregiver\nprovides care for a relative with either a psychological or\nphysical illness. For the purposes of the analysis, these\nvariables were assumed to be mutually exclusive, whereas\nin reality, a care recipient could suffer from both a physi-\ncal and psychological illness. In this study, approximately\n55% of caregivers provided care for a relative with both\na psychological and physical illness. Not considering the\nhigh correlation between these two variables may have\nelevated the significant impact that caring for a relative\nwith a psychological illness had on the caregivers' risk of\ndeveloping a depressive or anxiety disorder. It is interest-\ning to note that although there was a high correlation\nbetween anxiety and depression disorders, different pat-\nterns were found for each of these disorders. Further anal-\nysis should be conducted specifically analysing the group\nof caregivers providing care to a relative with both a physi-\ncal and psychological illness.\nAn alternative explanation for the significant results\nfound in the Binary Logistic Regression may be the influ-\nence of genetics and the environment rather than the car-\negiving task itself. If a relative suffers from a psychological\ndisorder, the caregiver may be more vulnerable to develop-\ning a psychological disorder due to their genetic makeup.\nThe environment can have an impact on the development\nof a psychological disorder, rendering a person more vul-\nnerable to developing a psychological disorder. The car-\negiver and relative could have shared the environment\nwhich would have influenced the likelihood of suffering\nfrom an anxiety or depressive disorder.\nA number of socio-demographic factors were found to\nbe highly influential to the development of a depressive\ndisorder or anxiety disorder. Carter et al. (2008) reported\nthat caregivers who were married to the care recipient,\nmale, older, and had at least a high school education\nreported better quality of life and lower psychological dis-\ntress. Similar to Carter et al. (2008), this study indicated\nthat being older, married, a man, employed irrespective\nof caregiving task decreased the likelihood of suffering\nfrom a depressive disorder. In accordance with previous\nresearch, females had an increased risk of suffering from\na depressive disorder in comparison to men (Greenberg et\nresearch has shown that women are nearly twice as likely\nto suffer from depression as men (Schulz et al., 2009). The\nreason for these gender differences may have to do with\nhigher competing roles of women in today's society. For\nexample, women are more likely to have to contend with\nbalancing work and looking after children which could\nincrease stress levels and make them more vulnerable to\ndeveloping depression (Pruchno et al., 1990; Schulz et al.,\n2009). Women may be more likely to report symptoms\nof depression where men due to stigma may underre-\nport symptoms or not recognise symptoms of depression\n(Hooker et al., 2000). Therefore, the gender differences\nfound in this study could be influenced by increased\nstressors and the reporting of symptoms.\nIn this study, the impact of age on the occurrence of\nan anxiety or depressive disorder was in contrast to pre-\nvious research. Pinquart and Sorenson (2007) found that\nolder people had a higher rate of depression and younger\npeople had higher rates of anxiety. Our study found that\nthat being younger significantly increased the likelihood\nof suffering from a depressive disorder whereas age was\nnot a significant predictor of suffering from an anxiety dis-\norder. One could surmise that younger people have more\npressure and other roles to fulfil rendering them more\nvulnerable to suffering from an anxiety disorder (Pinquart\nSimilar to previous findings of Dew et al. (2004), in this\nstudy employment status significantly affected the likeli-\nhood of suffering from a depressive disorder. Not being in\nthe labour force increased the likelihood of suffering from\na depressive disorder twofold. Dew et al.'s (2004) study\nindicated that depressive and anxiety related disorders\nwere elevated by unemployment (Dew et al., 2004). Our\nstudy did not find that unemployment predicted elevated\nrates of depressive or anxiety disorders. The sole socio-\ndemographic variable that held significant predictive\nvalue for both anxiety and depressive disorders was mari-\ntal status, more specifically, being divorced, separated, or\nwidowed. People who are divorced, separated, or widowed\nmay be experiencing chronic stressors relating to their\nmarital situation. As a result of the overload of pressures,\nthey may be more vulnerable to developing a psychologi-\ncal disorder (Haley, Lamond, Han, Burton, & Schonwetter,\n2003). This premise provides an explanation for the non-\nsignificant effect of never being married on the occur-\nrence of depressive and anxiety disorders. Alternatively,\nthe high predictive value of this factor may be due to the\nadditional support that married people obtain from their\nConclusion\nFamily members providing care to an ill relative are per-\nforming a great service not only to their family but also to\nsociety as a whole. From an economic perspective, family\ncaregivers save health services billions in hospital costs.\nThe current study provides evidence that people providing\nMarkey: Impact of Caregiving on Psychological Disorders 23\ncare do so at a great risk to their own psychological health.\nUtilising previous research findings and the current find-\nings, it is of the utmost importance that health services\nimplement caregiver interventions that are designed to\nhelp specific groups of caregivers that are at greater risk\nof developing a psychological disorder.\nReferences\nAlegria, M., Jackson, S.
