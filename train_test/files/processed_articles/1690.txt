Collins1,2\n1United States Renal System, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; 2Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota,\nUSA and 3Departments of Nephrology and Epidemiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA\nIn this study, we attempted to identify threshold values\nfor kidney function measures that maximally discriminate\nshort-term mortality, to identify major population segments\nin which these thresholds apply, and to classify the\nhierarchical rank of the thresholds when other classic risk\nfactors are also considered. To do this we retrospectively\nidentified estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and\nurinary albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio (ACR) thresholds to\nmaximize sensitivity and specificity predictions for death\nin non-institutionalized NHANES III participants,\nrepresentative of the United States population from 1988 to\nexcluding dichotomizing variables, age 57 years was initially\nselected; ACR appeared in the second round and eGFR in the\nthird. The prognostic discrimination of optimum eGFR and\nACR thresholds exceeded those of commonly advocated\npublic health screening measures, such as LDL cholesterol\nand fasting blood glucose, with body mass index appearing\nin the third round, and smoking and LDL cholesterol in the\nfourth. In a tree permitting dichotomizing variables, the ACR,\nsystolic blood pressure, and glucose first appeared in the\nthird round, with eGFR, smoking, and LDL in the fourth. Thus,\nthe albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio and eGFR may be at least as\nefficient for survival-based clinical triage as most other classic\nrisk factors.\nKEYWORDS: albumin\u00adcreatinine ratio; estimated glomerular filtration rate;\nmortality; survival\nChronic kidney disease is common, and is associated with\ncardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death\nrisks in community settings.1\u00ad4 Hence, it is reasonable to\nquestion whether kidney function tests should be routinely\nrecommended for community-dwelling adults, in much the\nsame way that blood pressure, lipid, and blood glucose\nmeasures are recommended periodically.\nBefore considering screening, it is useful to evaluate how\ndifferent threshold levels perform in relation to predicting\nmajor health outcomes. In the context of death within finite\nintervals, thresholds at which individuals classified as\n`normal' show low mortality rates (high proportion of true\nnegatives) and those classified as `abnormal' show high\nmortality rates (high proportion of true positives) are\nattractive for selecting subgroups in which more intensive\nfollow-up and treatment may be appropriate. As gains in\nsensitivity are accompanied by losses in specificity, the\nthreshold of maximum combined sensitivity and specificity\nis a logical selection.\nRegarding kidney function and mortality in the general\npopulation, there are many unknowns: should creatinine-\nbased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary\nalbumin\u00adcreatinine ratio (ACR), or both be used? At what\nlevels? Are optimal threshold values the same in all segments\nof the community? As declining kidney function correlates\nwith many other classic mortality risk factors, is it more\nefficient to screen for factors like blood pressure, lipids, body\nmass index, and blood glucose? In this nationally represen-\ntative study, thresholds with maximum sensitivity and\nspecificity values (MaxSn \u00fe Sp\n) were identified with a receiver\noperating characteristic approach,5 and classification tree\nmethodology was used to assess the performance of eGFR,\nACR, and classic cardiovascular risk factors as mortality\ndiscriminators among community-dwelling adults.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the non-institutionalized US population\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), are shown\n9.4% were African American, and 5.0% were Hispanic.

We found that optimal eGFR and ACR thresholds\nshowed prognostic discrimination close to optimal age\nthresholds, and, except for systolic blood pressure, higher\ndiscrimination than exhibited by optimal values of com-\nmonly advocated public health screening measures such as\nLDL cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. For urinary ACR,\nthe maximally discriminatory threshold value was consider-\nably lower than the values usually used to define micro-\nalbuminuria. Finally, classification tree analysis suggested that\nmeasures of kidney function were most discriminatory in\nTable 3 | Mortality risk estimates from categories derived from classification tree analysisa\nCategory Mean age (years) Death rate OR, death, unadjusted OR, death, age adjusted\nDichotomization variables excluded, classification based on terminal nodes in Figure 2a\nDichotomization variables included, classification based on terminal nodes in Figure 2b\nAbbreviations: ACR, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio; BMI, body mass index; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rates, LDL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; OR, odds\nratio; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nUnits: ACR, mg/g; age, years; BMI, kg/m2; eGFR, ml/min per 1.73 m2; glucose, mg/dl; LDL, mg/dl; SBP, mm Hg.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-recommended analytical procedures were followed and the sampling weights implicit in this complex sample survey\ndesign were used; WTPFSD6, SDPPSU6, and SDPSTRA6 as weight, cluster, and stratum variables, respectively.\naDeath rates are per 1000 subject years.

However, this approach ignores the\nprevalence of risk factor levels, and it can easily be shown\nthat, depending on prevalence, thresholds defined by\nmaximum risk ratio gradients may not maximize the\ncombined proportions of true positive and true negative\npredictions. If reduced mortality is the major goal, it is\ndifficult to argue against using a threshold that maximizes the\nchances of `good' levels of the risk factor predicting survival\nand `bad' levels predicting death.\nMany studies have examined associations between kidney\nfunction and death/survival. For example, a PubMed search\nof human studies in April 2010 with the search terms\n(mortality or survival) (glomerular filtration rate or albumi-\nnuria or chronic kidney disease) and (community or general\npopulation) yielded 1230 citations. Adding the terms\n`sensitivity' and `specificity' reduced this number to 72\ncitations, and adding the term `threshold' resulted in zero\ncitations. Thus, although many studies have examined\nassociations between levels of kidney function and mortality,\nfew if any have attempted to establish threshold values of\nmaximum combined sensitivity and specificity. A notable\nrecent community-based study from Norway used diagnostic\ntest methodology to evaluate the ability of eGFR and\nalbuminuria, as continuous variables, to predict end-stage\nrenal disease and found that both variables provided\ncomplementary information.6 Another community-based\nstudy from Sweden attempted to identify optimal creatinine\nclearance thresholds for the outcomes fatal or nonfatal\nmyocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in 2176\n50-year-old men without diabetes or cardiovascular disease.7\nFollow-up extended to age 70 years. Optimal eGFR thresh-\nwhat paralleling the observations in this study, the authors\nconcluded that optimal eGFR thresholds for discriminating\ncardiovascular risk in the general population may be higher\nthan generally appreciated.\nWhen using intrinsically continuous variables to define a\n`disease,' using the same criteria for clinical triage in a public\nhealth setting may not be optimal. For example, eGFR and\nto be very far from optimal in this study; only a small fraction\nof individuals who died during the study were identified with\nthese criteria. In addition, this study does not support the\nprimacy of eGFR over ACR, or vice versa, for clinical triage;\nboth measures were discriminatory, albeit in different\nsegments of the population. These findings mirror findings\nof other recent community-based studies with death and\nend-stage renal disease as outcomes.8\u00ad10\nThe limitations of this study deserve scrutiny. Gold\nstandard techniques, such as inulin or radioisotope clearance\nto measure GFR and accurately timed urine collection to\nmeasure urinary albumin excretion, were not used. As eGFR is\ncalculated with age, and age is a potent predictor of mortality,\nthe prognostic discrimination of eGFR may be inflated.11 As\nserum creatinine and urinary ACR were measured only once,\nidentification of participants with progressive loss of kidney\nfunction was not feasible. The accuracy of cause-specific\nmortality determination has not been assessed in NHANES III\nand we did not attempt to identify eGFR and ACR thresholds\nfor renal and cardiovascular death. This study examined the\nour findings to other countries and other times cannot be\nguaranteed. Similarly, these findings may not be generalizable\nto hospital and out patient settings. No attempts were made to\nweigh sensitivity differently from specificity. For public health\nscreening, confidence that a test has a high true negative rate\nmight be attractive from a service provision perspective; in\ncontrast, missing certain conditions might be so catastrophic\nthat high false positive test rates could be justified. This being\nsaid, applying relative weights to true-negative and true-\npositive test results requires value judgments, whether by\nindividuals, the caring professions, or those who decide public\nhealth policy. Thus, we made no attempt to differentially\nweigh sensitivity and specificity in this study. Finally, we only\nexamined short-term mortality, which is strongly associated\nwith age or with variables highly correlated with age, such as\nkidney function. Whether reduced kidney function is causally\nrelated to the increased short-term mortality in older adults is\nnot known.\nDespite these limitations, we believe this study has useful\nfeatures. The study population is large, and, by design,\ncommonly measured risk-stratification measures, such as blood\npressure, glucose, lipids, and body mass index were carefully\nmeasured, and study participants were examined in a fasting\nstate. Defining discrete threshold values that discriminate\nbetween death and survival may help current efforts to establish\nclinical guidelines for chronic kidney disease,12,13 but future\nstudies that identify risk factors for premature mortality instead\nof short-term mortality are needed.\nObjectives\nobjectives of this study were:\n1.

For this study, we\nlimited the study population to participants examined in a mobile\nexamination center after 12h fasting, aged X20 years, with serum\ncreatinine and urinary albumin\u00adcreatinine measurements.\nSerum creatinine was measured by the kinetic alkaline picrate\nmethod at the White Sands Research Center (Coulston Foundation)\nlaboratory (Alamogordo, NM, USA) with a Roche/Hitachi 737\nanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Serum creatinine\nmeasurements were aligned to standardized creatinine measured at the\nCleveland Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH, USA).17 In\nsummary, a random sample of 200 stored specimens was obtained\nfrom participants aged X60 years and creatinine was measured with a\ncoupled enzymatic assay (creatininase, creatinase, sarcosine oxidase;\nCollege of American Pathologists Creatinine Accuracy Calibration\nVerification/Linearity Survey LN24 samples were used to confirm\ntraceability to methods based on isotope dilution gas chromato-\ngraphy mass spectrometry.

To protect confidentiality, the public use file\nwas subjected to data perturbation techniques that introduce\nstatistical noise into the dataset to reduce the risk of identification.\nSynthetic dates were substituted for actual dates of death for\nselected deceased participants, whereas information regarding vital\nstatus was not perturbed.

To assess the\nreproducibility of eGFR and ACR thresholds, we randomly split the\ndataset into five similarly sized subgroups and calculated MaxSn \u00fe Sp\nlevels.
