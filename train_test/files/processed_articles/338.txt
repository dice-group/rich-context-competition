Women's total MC decreased, mainly due to decreased red meat and other\nmeat products, except for increased seafood. Noticeable differences existed in the\nchanges across population groups. Black men had the largest increase in con-\nsumption of total meat, poultry and seafood; Mexican American men had the smallest\nincrease in poultry, seafood and other meat products. In 1999\u00ad2004, ethnic differ-\nciations between MC and energy intake changed over time. Perceived benefit of\ndietary quality and food label use were associated with reduced red MC.\nConclusions: Noticeable differences exist in the shifts in MC across population groups\nand surveys. MC increased in men but decreased in women in recent years.\n",

During recent years, the Atkins diet, which\nconsists of high meat consumption (MC), has been\nadvocated for weight loss(2,3). On the other hand, MC has\nbeen linked to higher intakes of saturated fat, total energy\nand reduced consumption of vegetables(4,5), leading\nsome researchers to propose vegetarian diets as a means\nto prevent many diet-related chronic diseases including\nobesity, despite the many associated controversies(4,6\u00ad10).\nMC has been related to increased chronic morbidity,\nwhile higher intake of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts\nand legumes has been independently associated with a\nlower risk for several chronic diseases, such as IHD,\ndiabetes, obesity and many cancers(6,7). Earlier studies\nindicate that diets largely based on plant foods, including\nwell-balanced vegetarian diets, offer a number of nutri-\ntional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat,\ncholesterol and animal protein, as well as higher levels of\nfibre, magnesium, potassium, folate and antioxidants.\nCompared to their non-vegetarian counterparts, vegetar-\nians are found to have lower BMI, blood pressure and\nblood cholesterol levels; lower rates of hypertension,\ntype 2 diabetes, prostate and colon cancer; and reduced\ndeath rates from heart disease(4,6,7).

Our findings will help shed\nlight on the recent shifts in food consumption patterns\nand the variation in these shifts across population groups\nin the United States.\nMaterials and methods\nOverview of study design\nCross-sectional data collected from three data sets for\nadults (aged $18 years) were used in our analysis: two\nrounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nduals (CSFII). The dietary data (24 h recalls) collected in\nCSFII and NHANES were designed to provide national\nestimates of Americans' dietary intake patterns at the time\nof the survey. Thus, in theory their findings should be\ncomparable, and could indicate time trends in Americans'\ndietary intakes. We chose to give more attention to the\nconsidering that CSFII provided more recent data and two\n24 h recalls while NHANES III had only one, and that\nCSFII collected information on participants' nutrition/\nhealth knowledge and perception and other behavioural\nfactors related to food consumption, whereas NHANES\ndid not. In a 24 h dietary recall, the respondents were\nasked to report the kinds and amount of food and bev-\nerage items they ate over the past 24 h. Subsequently, the\ndata were linked to a food consumption table to help\nestimate nutrient and total energy intake.\nDatabase\nThe NHANES include a series of cross-sectional surveys\nthat provide nationally representative information on the\nnutrition and health status of the US civilian population.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) con-\nNHANES has been a continuous survey, and since 2002\nthe NHANES and CSFII dietary intake surveys were\nmerged into a single inter-agency survey conducted\njointly by NCHS and the US Department of Agriculture\nmade available. Since 1999, the NHANES has included all\npeople of all ages from birth, while some previous sur-\nveys excluded people aged 74 years or older. All NHANES\nused a stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling\ndesign, and collected data following standardised proto-\ncols. The survey consists of an in-home interview for\ndemographic and basic health information and a health\nexamination in a mobile examination centre. Household\ninterviews were conducted by trained staff consisting of\nphysicians, medical and health technicians, and dietary\nand health interviewers. Detailed descriptions of the\nstudy design and data collection have been published\ndesigned to provide nationally representative information\nfor assessing Americans' dietary intake patterns and\ntrends over time(15). A nationally representative multi-\nstage stratified sample of 16 103 non-institutionalised\npersons aged 0\u00ad90 years residing in the United States\nprovided information about dietary intake (by two 24 h\nrecalls) in in-person interviews, but in some instances\nonly one 24 h recall was obtained.\nThe Diet and Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS), a\nsupplementary survey to CSFII, was completed by one\nadult per household selected (n 5765) among those aged\n$20 years who had completed at least one 24 h recall\nin CSFII. DHKS included a number of questions that\nattempted to measure participants' knowledge, beliefs\nand perceptions related to nutrition and health, as well as\ntheir food habits and use of food labels in food purchase.\nStudy populations\nwomen) that had complete demographic data. Only\n7858 women). NHANES III provided complete dietary\ndata for 19 618 adults; these were used in our analysis.\nTo study the association between nutrition knowledge\nand psychosocial factors and MC using the CSFII/DHKS\nobtain a relatively healthy sample of individuals who were\nnot on special diets, and excluded those who completed\nonly one 24h dietary recall (n 90). This resulted in a final\nwho completed both surveys (CSFII and DHKS).\nDietary measures\nIn CSFII and NHANES, 24 h dietary recalls were collected.\nIn CSFII, dietary intake was assessed by one or two non-\nconsecutive, multiple-pass 24 h recalls that were 3\u00ad10 d\nparticipant in the household interview.

We created these\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

When two 24h recalls were available, the averages\nwere used. To our knowledge, the USDA system dis-\naggregated mixed dishes into individual components for\nCSFII; however, NHANES grouped mixed dishes based on\nthe main components rather than disaggregating them into\nindividual food components. Thus, this might affect the\ncomparability of the CSFII and NHANES food group data\nand our related findings.\nMeat groups\nIn the CSFII data, the USDA grouped the different meats and\nmeat products into the following groups: total meat\n(including all animal source food), red meat, poultry, sea-\nfood, and other meat products. For example, red meat\nconsisted of beef, pork, lamb, veal and game. Poultry\nincluded chicken, turkey, duck and other poultry. Seafood\nincluded fish and shellfish. Other meat products included\nfrankfurter and sausage, organ meats and food mixtures,\nmainly composed of meat, poultry and fish. Mixtures\nincluded items such as beef stew, spaghetti with meat sauce,\nchilli, sausage with gravy, soup with added meats, beef and\npotatoes or noodles, beef with rice and cooked vegetables,\nham or shrimp or tuna salads, hamburgers or cheeseburgers,\nham and cheese, roast beef or steak or chicken sandwiches\nand seafood mixtures. For simplicity, we call the combined\nmeat groups `all meat' in contrast to all plant source food.\nNutrition-related psychosocial\u00adbehavioural\nfactors \u00ad food purchasing factors, nutrition\nknowledge, food label-related practices and\nfood habits\nA number of questions included in the CSFII/DHKS asked\nabout participants' knowledge, beliefs and perceptions rela-\nted to nutrition and health. We chose six individual questions\nrelated to food purchasing behaviour measured on a 4-point\nLikert scale (`very important' to `not important at all')\nenquiring about each participant's concern about `how safe\nthe food is to eat', `its nutritional value', `its price', `how well\nthe food keeps', `how easy the food is to prepare' and `its\ntaste' and eight scales that covered areas of perceived benefit\nof diet quality(17) (or how important it is for participants to\nfollow general dietary guidelines: e.g. how important it is to\npurchase foods that are low in fat), food label-related prac-\ntices (use, looking at, understanding and confidence in use),\nand food habits (e.g. choosing low-fat variety of foods or\nmeat-related healthy habits, such as trimming fat from red\nmeat and removing skin from poultry).\nFirst, we conducted exploratory factor analysis to decide\nwhich scales in the DHKS could be reduced to a single factor\nthat explained the majority of the variance in its manifest\nvariables, using the Kaiser rule (i.e. eigenvalue . 1).\nNext these scales were used to assess their associations\nwith MC. Principal components analysis of variables\nwithin each scale was used for data reduction purposes.\nAll extracted components (standardised Z-scores) were\naccording to better health-related knowledge and food\nlabel practices and were named based on the content of\neach scale within the DHKS questionnaire. One compo-\nnent per scale was extracted and explained 40\u00ad70 % of\nthe variance in the measures included within each scale.\nWe hypothesised that better practices and knowledge\nwould be associated with less MC, particularly red meat.\nWe also hypothesised that concern about price would\nreduce the consumption of food in general, including\nmeat, and that concern about nutrition would have a\nsimilar effect on perceived benefit of diet quality.\nMain covariates\nSES variables\nWe used education and family income as the indicators of\nSES, considering their strengths and limitations(18). Educa-\ntion was measured by years completed and then grouped\ninto 0: `,High school education', 1: `High school' (12 years)\nand 2: `.High school education'. The poverty income ratio\n(PIR) is the ratio of household income and the poverty line\npublished by the Census Bureau for a certain family size in\nthat calendar year. Specifically, we used the PIR categories\nOther main food groups\nIn our analysis, we used the consumption (in grams) of\nVF and grains as comparison for MC as well as potential\nconfounders when assessing the association between MC\nand total energy intake. Fruits included whole fruit, dried\nand mixed dishes, and 100 % fruit juice; and vegetables\nincluded potatoes, fried potatoes, garden vegetables,\nsalad greens and legumes.\nOther covariates\nAge, gender and race/ethnicity were considered as poten-\ntially confounding variables in our models. On the basis\nof the self-reported race and ethnicity, the participants\nwere categorised as non-Hispanic (NH) whites, NH\nblacks, Mexican American (MA) and other.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst, we compared the average consumption of all meat\nand the meat groups over time, in the whole population\nand by gender. We also compared the changes across\nethnic and SES groups. To test the differences by ethnicity\nand SES while controlling for other potential confounders,\nwe fit linear regression models by including these variables\nsimultaneously. Separate models were fit for each survey\nand for men and women. Next, using the CSFII/DHKS data\nand linear models, we tested the associations between MC\nand nutrition knowledge, psychosocial, food purchase and\nfood habit factors. Finally, using linear regression analysis,\nwe tested how meat, VF and grain consumption might be\nTrends in US adults' meat consumption 1335\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

All analyses were\nconducted using survey commands in the STATA statistical\nsoftware package version 9?0 (Stata Corp., College Station,\nTX, USA) to account for the complex sample design effects\nin order to achieve nationally representative estimates and\nunbiased statistical inference(19).\nResults\nTrends in meat consumption and the differences\nacross gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status\nThese nationally representative data showed a U-shaped\nincreased MC by men for all the animal food groups.\nWomen's MC decreased, which was driven by a decline in\nconsumption of red meat and other meat products, while\nconsumption of seafood increased. All these changes were\nstatistically significant (P,0?05). Gender differences in\nobserved for `all meat', red meat, poultry or seafood.\nTable 2 compares MC trends across ethnic, gender and\nSES groups. A large proportion overall (62 of 200) of the\ntime-dependent changes was significant (P,0?05), and\nmost consisted of an increase among men and a decrease\n(NHANES), there were a number of noticeable differences\nin the changes across ethnic and SES groups. For example,\nNH-black men had the largest increase in the intakes of total\nmeat, red meat, poultry and seafood. MA men had the\nsmallest increase in the consumption of poultry, seafood\nand other meat products, though their increase in red MC\nwas comparable to the two other major ethnic groups.\nEthnic differences were more apparent among women: NH-\nwhite women reduced consumption of all meat groups,\nparticularly other meat products, while NH-black women\nincreased consumption of all meat groups except for other\nmeat products. The pattern of shift among MA women was\nnot significant, with one exception wherein the reduction in\nother meat products was larger than that for their ethnic\ncounterparts. Women with low education had the largest\nreduction during this period in consumption of other meat\nproducts, while women with high education reduced red\nMC. Interestingly, among women, only the high-income\ngroup reduced their red MC and increased their seafood\nconsumption significantly.\nchanges across race/ethnicity and SES groups were\nsignificant. A significant reduction in red MC was noted\namong NH-black men. MA women and men and women\nin the middle-income group had significant drops in\nconsumption of other meat products. In general, differ-\nences in the changes among SES groups were small and\ninconsistent. Among men, most groups had increased\ntheir consumption of the various meat groups.\nCovariates of meat consumption\nUsing linear regression models, we tested the cross-sectional\nassociations between age, ethnicity and SES and total MC\n(Table 3), controlling for potential confounders.

Only twelve of the eighty tests were\nsignificant. For example, those who weighed taste more\nas a factor in food selection consumed more red meat\nwhile those who used food labels consumed less.\nAssociation between meat consumption and total\nenergy intake\nWe also estimated the contribution of MC to TEI and the\ndifferences across food groups by adding the same amount\n(100g/d) of different food groups as well as the variation\nexplained by these food groups and the changes between\nthe survey periods (Table 5). A main finding was an\ninverted U-shaped relation between MC and TEI over time,\nboth for the amount of energy contributed per 100g of meat\n(i.e. overall energy density of meat) and for the variance in\nTEI explained by MC. In addition, the results showed that\nred meat contributed much more energy than other food\ngroups, particularly VF.

This gender difference\nmay be explained by gender differences in health and\nnutrition awareness and belief(17). We suspect that some\nof the differences revealed by these CSFII and NHANES\ndata are due to the true changes over time, while some\nmay be due to differences in the samples, dietary\nassessment approaches and data coding across the these\nsurveys.\nSome of our observed trends in MC may reflect chan-\nges in Americans' eating behaviours over the past two\nand higher grain consumption were considered part of a\nwhile during recent years reduced carbohydrate intake\nand higher MC have been advocated for weight loss and\nfor reducing obesity and type 2 diabetes risks(2,3).\nIncreased MC over time is a worldwide phenomenon,\nespecially during recent years, among those developing\ncountries that have enjoyed rapid economic develop-\nment.

MA\nwomen had a major reduction in `other meat product'\nconsumption.\nIn general, SES differences in consumption levels and\ntime shifts were small and inconsistent. This is in contrast\nwith results from other studies in other countries that\nfound positive associations with income and educa-\ntion(17), including an inverse association between income\nand MC(23,24).

We observed\nincreases in total and red MC among US men and more so\nin the higher-income group, as well as a small decrease in\nred MC among high-income women. This may be due to\nthe difference in the prices of meat and VF, people's\nperception of their health values and response to nutri-\ntion education.\nWe also compared the associations between TEI and\nMC to those with other food groups as well as the over-\ntime changes in the associations. Our findings suggest\nthat interventions targeting MC rather than VF might have\na greater impact on TEI, since MC contributed more\nenergy and explained a higher proportion of the variation\nin TEI than VF, although it is important to promote VF\nconsumption for other health benefits. The proportion of\nvariance in TEI that could be explained by MC and VF\ndropped over time, suggesting the increasingly important\nrole in the American diet played by other food groups\nsuch as snacks and sweetened beverages. For example,\nthe CSFII data showed large increases in Americans'\nenergy intake from salty snacks, soft drinks and pizza\nintake from sweetened beverages increased by 135 %\nMoreover, our comparisons may indicate concerns\nregarding the comparability of the CSFII and NHANES\ndietary data, although other researchers have reported\ntime trends in Americans' dietary intakes using these\ndata(27). Our findings show that one may reach different\nconclusions regarding the time trends based on different\ndata sets. For example, the amount of energy contributed\nper 100 g of red meat was relatively stable between\n337 kcal, respectively), in model 3), much lower than\ngrain consumption would have contributed less energy\nover time (e.g. a trend that can be explained by reduced\nfat and sugar contents). This trend, however, was not\nsupported by the comparison between NHANES III\nthese differences could be due to the between-survey\ndifferences in the food composition table used, sampling\ndesigns, degree of under-reporting and food grouping\nsystem, particularly with regard to mixed dishes.\nWe suspect that the reduction in MC, in particular\namong US men, may be related to the BSE (bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease) epi-\ndemic in the United Kingdom, which peaked in January\ncreated great anxiety in the United Kingdom and many\nother parts of the world including the United States in the\nBurton and Young(30,31) indicates that the first wave of\nimmediate and detrimental impact on people's beef\nconsumption in the United Kingdom. However, US\nwomen's red MC did not change much across the three\nsurvey periods, while the big reduction in the mid-1990s\nand a later increase in red MC in the early 2000s were only\nobserved in US men. On the one hand, one may suspect\nthat both US men and women's beef consumption would\ndecrease beyond the mid-1990s if people were concerned\nabout BSE. On the other hand, it is possible that because,\nin general, men were more likely than women to con-\nsume steaks, hamburgers and other beef products before\nthe outbreak of the disease in Europe; they had a greater\npotential (both the possibility and amount) to reduce\ntheir consumption beyond that point in time. Another\npossible reason is that unlike Europe, in the United States,\nanimal brains are not used to produce animal feeds. Thus,\nthe risk of contamination is much less, and this was\nemphasised by the Food and Drug Administration during\nthe scare. Further research is needed to help fully\nunderstand the reasons for the changes in people's MC\nthat we observed.\nAlthough it is widely believed that individuals' eating\npatterns are affected by many psychosocial\u00adbehavioral\nfactors, we found that only a few of the factors we\nexamined were associated with the total and subtypes of\nmeat intake. This is likely due to the possible consider-\nable day-to-day variations in individuals' MC, and the 24 h\nrecall dietary data we used cannot adequately measure\ntheir usual food patterns. Furthermore, people's food\npatterns may be affected by many other factors including\ncontextual\u00adenvironmental factors such as food avail-\nability and food price. Nevertheless, our analysis shows\nthat factors such as concern about food taste were asso-\nciated with increased red meat intake, while concern\nabout nutrition, perceived benefit of diet quality and use\nof food labels were associated with reduced red MC.\nHealthy habits such as trimming fat from red meat and\nremoving skin from poultry were associated with reduced\ntotal MC.\nEarlier research including ours using the DHKS sug-\ngested that nutrition knowledge was positively associated\nwith a number of diet quality indicators and indices\nindependently of socio-economic and demographic fac-\ntors(17), while certain healthy eating behaviours (includ-\ning trimming fat from meat and removing skin from\nchicken) were associated with reduced fat and saturated\nfat intake(32). Food label use seemed to modify the\npositive association between household income and\ndietary quality, whereby participants who did not use\nfood labels did not show the benefit(33). Altogether, these\nfindings indicate the importance of nutrition education\nand empowering individuals to use food labels to pro-\nmote healthy eating.\nWhile our present analysis revealed some encouraging\nsigns of small desirable changes in Americans' MC, par-\nticularly among women with regard to red meat and\nTrends in US adults' meat consumption 1343\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

These suggest that more vigorous\nintervention efforts and policy changes are needed to\npromote healthy eating among Americans. In addition,\nthe differences we observed in the relationships between\nSES and the consumption of meat and VF indicate potential\nfuture directions for interventions including government\npolicies on food subsidies and taxes.\nAn important strength of the present study is the use of\nnationally representative data and tests of differences across\npopulation groups. However, it has several limitations. First,\nonly one or two 24h dietary recalls were collected in the\nCSFII and NHANES. Multiple 24h recalls are needed to\nmeasure individuals' usual dietary intake, although there is\nalso some evidence that under certain circumstances one\nrecall can provide a good estimate(35,36). Our recent sensi-\ntivity analysis assessing differences in estimates of intakes\nusing one compared with two recalls for NHANES\ntwo methods for dairy-related nutrients and TEI(37). Some\nearlier studies have suggested an under-reporting problem\nin national dietary surveys using 24h recalls such as\nNHANES; for example, mean energy intake was found to be\nlower than energy requirements in 15% of all 24-h\nrecalls(38\u00ad40). Such measurement errors might have affected\nour findings, including lowering the average amount of MC.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that some of the time\nmay be due to the sample and methodological differences\nbetween CSFII and NHANES. Further research is needed to\nanswer such questions.\nIn conclusion, the present study provides some evi-\ndence of the shifts in food consumption patterns in the\nUnited States over the two decades, and the variation\nacross ethnic and SES groups. The differences in the\nrelationships between SES and the consumption of\nmeat and VF may indicate potential future interventions.\nVigorous intervention efforts and policy changes are\nneeded to promote healthy eating among Americans.\n"
