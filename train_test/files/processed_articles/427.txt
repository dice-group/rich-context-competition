Eighty percent of adolescents with the\nmetabolic syndrome are overweight, signifying the unique\nvulnerability of a growing segment of the nation's youth to\nthe development of this syndrome and to subsequent prema-\nture cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.\nA growing body of evidence also indicates that tobacco\nsmoke is independently associated with insulin resistance and\nthat the insulin resistant condition may contribute to the\naccelerated atherosclerosis that leads to excessive cardiovas-\ncular disease in adult smokers.13 Tobacco smoke is clearly\nassociated with dyslipidemias (increased LDL and decreased\nHDL),14,15 endothelial dysfunction, and a hypercoagulable\nstate,16 all of which are also components of the metabolic\nsyndrome. Additionally, a dose-response relationship exists\nwith cigarette smoking and the development of type II\ndiabetes in adults.17 These findings suggest that because both\ntobacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome are individually\nassociated with insulin resistance, these 2 entities may be\nlinked through this common pathophysiology and that over-\nweight children and youth may be especially susceptible to\nthe impact of tobacco smoke on cardiovascular health,\nconsidering that tobacco smoke and obesity both predispose\nto the constellation of cardiovascular risk factors seen in the\nmetabolic syndrome.\nThe present study sought to investigate the association\nbetween both active smoking and environmental tobacco\nsmoke (ETS), also known as secondhand smoke, exposure,\nand the metabolic syndrome among adolescents in the United\nStates. We hypothesized that tobacco smoke exposure is\nassociated in a dose-dependant manner with the metabolic\nsyndrome in adolescents.\nMethods\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988 to\n1994) were examined. The response rate for this age range partici-\npating in the examination component of the survey was 83%.\nNHANES III is a cross-sectional health survey that used a complex,\nmultistage design to achieve a nationally representative sample of the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States. Partic-\nipants were evaluated with a home interview to determine family\nmedical history, current medical conditions, medication use, self-\nreport of the presence of any smokers in the household, and\nsocioeconomic and demographic information. Additionally, each\nperson was randomly assigned to undergo a morning, afternoon, or\nevening examination at a mobile examination center consisting of\nphysical exams and laboratory testing using blood and urine samples.\nMorning participants were asked to fast for 8 hours; afternoon and\nevening participants were asked to fast for 6 hours.\nFurther details about the determination and analysis of serum\ntriglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose levels have been de-\nscribed elsewhere.3 Blood pressure measurements for adolescents\n17 years of age were averaged from 3 measurements taken at the\nparticipant's home and 3 taken at the examination center. The first\nand fifth Korotkoff sounds were used for the systolic and diastolic\nvalues. For adolescents 12 to 16 years of age, only the 3 blood\npressure measurements at the examination center were taken, and the\naverage of those 3 measurements was used. Measurements for height\nwere taken with a stadiometer in subjects in an upright posture;\nweight was measured with a self-zeroing scale. Waist circumference\nmeasurements were made to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the patient at\nminimal respiration.18 The point of measurement was between the\nbottom of the ribcage and the top of the iliac crest. The sample\nnumbered 2273 after the following exclusion criteria were applied:\n(1) had not fasted for 6 hours; (2) was currently pregnant; (3) was\ntaking medication classified as a blood glucose regulator such as\ninsulin, androgens or anabolic steroids, or adrenal corticosteroids; or\n(4) had no serum cotinine level available. In the regression analysis,\nwe included 2006 subjects who had complete data for all covariates\nin the final model.\nDefinitions\nAt Risk for Overweight and Overweight\nWeight status was assessed with age- and gender-specific BMI.\nThose with a BMI 85th percentile were classified as normal\nweight; those with a BMI 85th but 95th percentile were\nclassified as at risk for overweight; those with a BMI 95th\npercentile were considered overweight; and all those with a BMI\n85th percentile were classified as at risk for overweight and\nMetabolic Syndrome\nAlthough no universally accepted definition for the metabolic\nsyndrome in adolescents has been formulated, previously developed\ncriteria6 have been used in the literature that are based on values\nfrom national references for cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose\nfor children and adolescents.16,20\u00ad22 Adolescents who had a waist\ncircumference 90th percentile for age and gender from this sample\npopulation were classified as having abdominal obesity. Systolic and\ndiastolic hypertension was defined by having blood pressure values\n90th percentile for age, sex, and height22 or currently using\nantihypertensive medication. Participants were classified with hyper-\ntriglyceridemia if they had 110 mg/dL, low HDL if they had values\n40 mg/dL, and elevated fasting glucose if they had serum glucose\nvalues 100 mg/dL.23 Those with the metabolic syndrome were\ndefined as individuals with 3 of these abnormalities (Table 1).\nActive Smoking and ETS Exposure\nCotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was used as a biomarker for both\nactive smoking and exposure to ETS. In addition to cotinine,\nNHANES III includes adolescent self-report of smoking status and\nparent/guardian report of the presence of any smokers in the\nhousehold. Active smokers were defined as those with cotinine\nlevels 15 ng/mL24 or those who reported smoking in the past 5\ndays. Those with serum cotinine levels that were detectable but 15\nng/mL and who did not report smoking in the past 5 days were\ndefined as exposed to ETS.24 A cotinine level of 0.05 ng/mL was\nbelow the detection limit. Those with undetectable serum cotinine\nlevels, no reported smoking in the home, and no self-reported\nsmoking were defined as nonexposed. We used parental report of\nsmoking in the home to verify that the mean cotinine levels of those\nliving in households reported to contain a smoker were in fact higher\nthan the levels among those reported as living in a household without\na smoker. Before separating the ETS exposure group into terciles for\na secondary dose-response analysis, we excluded those adolescents\nwhose parents did not report the presence of any smokers in the\nhousehold to yield a group more enriched for true ETS exposure.\nThus, for the analysis involving this enriched group in ETS by\nTABLE 1.

The definitions for active smoking and\nnonexposed are identical to those described above for the initial\nanalysis. All definitions for smoke exposure categories are illustrated\nin Table 2.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe used 2 tests for bivariate analyses to determine the statistical\nsignificance of associations of independent variables investigated\nwith the metabolic syndrome and its components. Student's t tests\nwere used to compare the mean serum cotinine levels and the\ngeometric mean of cotinine levels of those who were reported to live\nin households with smokers with those who were reported not to live\nin households with smokers. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was\nused to test for trends. Variables found to be statistically significant\nin bivariate analyses at P0.10 or thought to be associated with the\nmetabolic syndrome were included in multivariable logistic regres-\nsion analyses to determine independent associations with the meta-\nbolic syndrome. Variables in the logistic regression models were\nscreened for colinearity by examining correlation coefficients in\nbivariate analyses, and no colinearity was found. Two additional\nanalyses were performed: one on overweight teens and one on teens\nfrom households with reported smokers in the home. All analyses\nwere conducted with SAS,25 and SUDAAN statistical software was\nused to account for the complex sample design of the NHANES and\nto apply sampling weights to produce national estimates by adjusting\nfor the oversampling of young children, older adults, Mexican\nAmericans, and blacks.26\nResults\nThe overall rate of nonexposure to tobacco (cotinine 0.05\nng/mL, no self-report of active smoking, and no report of\nhousehold members smoking) was 11.8%, ETS exposure\n(cotinine 0.05 to 15 ng/mL and no self-report of active\nsmoking) was 67.0%, and active smoking (cotinine 15\nng/mL or self-report of smoking in the past 5 days) was\nadolescents reported no exposure to tobacco (neither house-\nhold exposure nor actively smoking), 42.5% of adolescents\nreported any household exposure (with or without actively\nsmoking), and 19.1% of adolescents reported actively smok-\ning. Serum cotinine levels were higher among adolescents for\nwhom the presence of a smoker in the home was reported (1.7\ngeometric mean cotinine levels were compared, P0.001).\nThere were no adolescents with cotinine levels 0.05 ng/mL\nwho reported smoking in the last 5 days.\nThe metabolic syndrome was present in 5.6% of US\nadolescents overall: 8.1% of boys and 2.9% of girls\nMexican Americans (P0.003) (Table 3). Age, poverty\nstatus, parental history of diabetes or heart attack, and\nreported presence of a smoker in the home were not statisti-\ncally associated with increased rates of occurrence. In con-\ntrast, the rate increased with increasing BMI and level of\ntobacco smoke exposure: 1.2% of nonexposed teens, 5.4% of\nthose exposed to ETS, and 8.7% of actively smoking teens\nIn multivariable logistic regression analyses conducted\namong all those 12 to 19 years of age, the following\ncharacteristics were independently associated with the meta-\nbolic syndrome after adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnic-\nity, poverty status, region, and parental history of diabetes or\nheart attack: male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6\npossible confounding of BMI with components of the meta-\nbolic syndrome, identical multivariable analyses were con-\nducted among youth with a BMI 85th percentile. Male\ngender, black race, ETS exposure, and active smoking again\nwere independently associated with the risk of metabolic\nsyndrome, with ORs similar to those of the entire adolescent\nsample (Table 4). To test for the interaction between race/\nethnicity and poverty status and the metabolic syndrome, an\ninteraction term was added to the model, and the multivari-\nable analysis was repeated. Black race remained associated\n(OR, 0.4), but there was no statistically significant association\nbetween poverty or the interaction term and the metabolic\nsyndrome.\nTo assess the potential burden of smoke exposure on at risk\nfor overweight and overweight teens, analyses were per-\nformed on teens with BMIs 85th percentile, thus examining\nthe impact of the 2 most prevalent cardiac risk factors in\nadults. In bivariate analyses among adolescents with a BMI\n85th percentile, the metabolic syndrome was present in\n5.6% of those who were nonexposed, 19.6% of those exposed\n(Table 5).

In\ncontrast, rates of elevated blood pressure were lowest among\nactively smoking youth (6.2%), intermediate among those\nexposed to ETS (9.8%), and highest among those nonexposed\nallow statistical reliability for multivariable analyses on this\nsubset; thus, they were not performed.\nTo examine a purer subset of adolescents exposed to\npassive tobacco smoke, analyses were performed on only\nthose teens with a reported smoker in the home because\nsubjects would be less likely to lie about positive household\nsmoking. To assess for the possibility of a dose-response\nrelationship between metabolic syndrome and level of to-\nbacco smoke exposure, cotinine levels for ETS-exposed\nadolescents were categorized by tercile among youth in\nhouseholds with reported smokers present. Adolescents who\nhad cotinine values in the ETS range but whose parents did\nnot report smokers in the home were excluded to provide a\ngroup with optimal true ETS exposure. A linear relationship\nwas found between intensity of tobacco smoke exposure and\nrates of the metabolic syndrome (the Figure). This apparent\ndose-response relationship persisted in multivariable analyses\n(Table 6).\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates a dose-response, cotinine-confirmed\nrelationship between tobacco smoke and the metabolic syn-\ndrome among adolescents in the United States. Data come\nfrom a large, nationally representative sample with objective\nbiochemical rather than exclusive self-report measures of\nsmoking status. The findings indicate that exposure to to-\nbacco smoke, whether by active smoking or exposure to ETS,\nis associated with at least a 4-fold increase in the risk of the\nmetabolic syndrome among adolescents who are overweight\nand at risk for overweight. These findings may have profound\nimplications in light of the still-increasing rates of overweight\nand persistently high rates of active smoking and exposure to\nETS among adolescents in the United States.\nBoth smoking and the metabolic syndrome have individu-\nally been recognized as independent risk factors for cardio-\nvascular disease and type II diabetes for some time, and at\nleast 2 previous studies have reported increased rates of the\nmetabolic syndrome among adult smokers.27,28 Never before,\nto the best of our knowledge, have these associations been\ninvestigated using a biological marker of smoking and ETS in\nadolescents. Furthermore, although previous work has ex-\nplored ETS by cotinine studies in adults, only individual\ncardiovascular risk factors15 or coronary artery disease\ndeaths29 were examined, not the cluster of the adverse\nphysiological changes of the metabolic syndrome, as demon-\nstrated here.\nThe mechanisms underlying the development of the met-\nabolic derangements that occur in the metabolic syndrome are\nnot fully understood. The most widely accepted hypothesis\nposits a complex interaction between insulin resistance and\nobesity that is modified by social, environmental, racial/\nethnic, and genetic factors.30\u00ad32 Although it is not possible to\nconclusively establish an etiological role for tobacco smoke\nTABLE 3.

The fact that\ndiverse and complex individual components of the metabolic\nsyndrome (eg, abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, and dys-\nlipidemia) cluster together more often than would be ex-\npected by chance alone has long suggested that a common\nbiological pathway might explain the frequent emergence of\nthis constellation of risk factors.31 There is evidence in studies\nof children to suggest that insulin resistance mediates the\ndeleterious effects of excess adiposity on blood pressure and\nlipids in the metabolic syndrome and that insulin resistance\noperates independently of the degree of obesity.33,34 Addi-\ntionally, studies have shown that smoking is associated with\nincreased insulin resistance in adults and may be a primary\ndefect leading to endothelial dysfunction, abnormal lipid\nmetabolism, and accelerated cardiovascular disease.13,35,36 If\nthis formulation is correct, then smoking and ETS exposure\nmay be causally related to insulin resistance, which in turn\nmay cause, contribute to, and/or trigger the metabolic abnor-\nmalities in overweight individuals that result in the metabolic\nsyndrome. In the present study, there are lower rates of\nhyperglycemia in the exposed and active smoking groups.\nThis finding is difficult to explain; however, fasting glucose\nhas been shown to be highly insensitive for detecting diabetes\ncompared with other methods of assessing insulin resistance\nsuch as glucose tolerance testing, insulin, proinsulin, or c\npeptide.

Because it is well accepted that insulin\nresistance is an underlying force driving the metabolic syn-\ndrome and its components, we can only state that we were\nunable to find a statistical difference related to hyperglycemia\nin the study population. Although hyperglycemia, the least\ncommon of the metabolic syndrome components, does not\ntrend in the direction one might expect, one cannot discount\nthe possibility that tobacco exposure plays a role in insulin\nresistance. An insulin resistance\u00adcentered model would also\nhave significant clinical implications. Reaven and Tsao36\nhave suggested that, given the difficulty of making behavior\nchanges to alter both weight and smoking habits, drug therapy\ntargeting insulin resistance might significantly enhance the\nability of practitioners to clinically treat the adverse health\neffects of obesity and smoking.\nThe findings reported here of both ETS exposure and\nactive smoking being associated with decreased rates of\nhypertension are consistent with a number of studies in adults\nshowing that active smoking is associated with decreased\nblood pressure.37\u00ad40 The literature on passive exposure to\nETS and blood pressure is still more limited and unclear, and\nwe could find no prior published studies of either the\nassociation of ETS exposure or active smoking with blood\npressure among adolescents.\nThese data also reveal pronounced differences in rates of\nthe metabolic syndrome by gender and race, consistent with\nother studies.7,41,42 These differences may at least in part be a\nconsequence of a lack of a universally accepted definition of\nthe metabolic syndrome in adolescents or, perhaps more\nimportantly, of the differences across gender and race in the\nnormal values for the various components of this syndrome.\nFor example, there is evidence that white children have\nsignificantly higher serum triglyceride levels than black\nTABLE 5.

More important limita-\ntions include the cross-sectional nature of the data, limiting\ncausal inferences and the possibility that part or all of the\nobserved associations between tobacco smoke exposure and\nincreased rates of the metabolic syndrome are due to some\nunmeasured confounder or confounders. One such con-\nfounder may be physical activity, which is difficult to assess\nin this population using NHANES III because questions\nabout physical activity were asked differently to children\n16 years of age compared with children 16 years of age\nin this survey. Because, unlike in adults, the metabolic\nsyndrome is found almost exclusively in youth at risk for\noverweight or overweight adolescents,6 analyses for the\nassociation of tobacco exposure with the metabolic syndrome\nwere investigated among those adolescents who were at risk\nfor overweight or overweight. It is possible that even after\nadjustment for weight, adolescent smokers and those pas-\nsively exposed to ETS may differ in diets, which may account\nfor some of the associations found in the present study\nbetween the metabolic syndrome and tobacco exposure.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to tell whether those reporting\nactive smoking with cotinine levels 15 ng/mL and those\nwith cotinine levels 15 ng/mL were also exposed to ETS;\nthus, we cannot estimate the exclusive contribution of ETS\nexposure to the increased risk of the metabolic syndrome\namong those classified as active smokers. We also do not\nknow every source of ETS exposure such as in public settings\nwhere ETS exposure could be reduced by bans on smoking.\nIn an effort to correctly classify active smokers, a cotinine\nlevel of 15 ng/mL was used as a marker for active smoking.\nThis level, previously used in the literature on ETS expo-\nsure,24 is low enough to include infrequent smokers. Other\nstudies use levels as high as 25 ng/mL45; thus, a more\nconservative measure was applied in the present study. In our\nanalysis of dose response, we were not able to eliminate\nmisclassification bias entirely. Adolescents who are actually\nsmoking but deny smoking by self-report may still exist in the\n\"ETS exposed\" group. However, parents who do report\npresence of smokers in the household are likely to be telling\nthe truth, yielding a group that is more enriched for true ETS\nexposure, as opposed to transient exposure in public locations\nor a misclassification of exposure based on the temporally\ndependent cotinine measure itself.46 Therefore, by excluding\nthose adolescents whose parents do not report the presence of\nother smokers in the home, we have probably reduced the\nnumber of adolescent active smokers who are lying about\ntheir use in our ETS exposed group. This differential report-\ning phenomenon probably is due to normative beliefs by the\nadolescent about what constitutes acceptable/reportable be-\nhavior in the context of smoking and nonsmoking\nIn summary, this is the first study to demonstrate a\ndose-responsive, cotinine-confirmed relationship between to-\nbacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome and the first that\nwe are aware of to demonstrate any association between\ntobacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome in adolescents.\nAlthough there may be reason to celebrate decreasing rates of\nactive and passive exposure to tobacco smoke, 1 in 5\nadolescents are still actively smoking, and an additional two\nthirds of all adolescents are exposed to tobacco smoke as\nmeasured by biological markers. Exposure to tobacco smoke,\nwhether by active or passive smoking, is associated with an\n4-fold increase in the risk of the metabolic syndrome\namong adolescents who are overweight and at risk for\noverweight. Considering that tobacco and obesity are indi-\nvidually the 2 leading causes of preventable death in the\nUnited States, these findings may have profound implications\nfor the future health of the public.\n"
