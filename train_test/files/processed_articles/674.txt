Cunningham and Linda Kohn\nChanging health plans may be\nbeneficial to the extent that it results\nfrom consumers' decisions and prefer-\nences about what type of health plan best\nsuits their health care needs. On the other\nhand, consumers today are not only choosing\na plan to finance the use of services, but\nwithin that decision are also choosing a deliv-\nery system or network of providers. There-\nfore, changing health plans may lead to a\nchange in physicians, which may prove harm-\nful to continuity of care, access, and quality.1\nThe extent to which changes in health\nplans are beneficial or potentially harmful de-\npends on the answers to several key ques-\ntions: How frequently are changes made, es-\npecially by vulnerable populations who are\nalready at risk for problems with medical care\naccess and quality? To what extent is chang-\ning plans voluntary (for example, consumers\nexercising choice) or involuntary (for exam-\nple, forced changes by employers)? How often\ndoes changing health plans lead to a change in\nthe place that persons usually receive medical\ncare?\nPrevious studies have been limited to the\nexperience of a single company, which makes\nit difficult to generalize to the privately in-\nsured population as a whole.2 Using data from\n(CTS) household survey, this study is among\nthe first to examine consumers' switching\namong private insurance plans nationwide.\nData And Methods\nn Data. The CTS is a major initiative of the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)\nto track changes in the health care system\nover time and to gain a better understanding\nof how health system changes are affecting\npeople.3 The CTS household survey was de-\nsigned to produce representative estimates for\nthe U.S. population as well as for sixty ran-\ndomly selected communities. The sample was\nbased on random-digit dialing, as well as on a\nsmall field sample to represent households\nwithout telephones. A family respondent was\nselected to report on health insurance cover-\nage (among other factors) for other persons in\nthe family included in the survey (all adults\nand one randomly selected child).4 The overall\nresponse rate for the household survey was 65\npercent for families.\nwere privately insured throughout the survey\nn Determining plan switching.

Per-\nsons continuously covered by the same pri-\nvate insurance plan throughout the twelve\nmonths prior to the interview were consid-\nered to have not changed plans. Respondents\nalso were asked whether their current and\nprevious plans were health maintenance or-\nganization (HMO) or non-HMO plans.\n \nA National Profile\nn How many people change health plans?\nAbout 17 percent of privately insured persons\nchanged their health plan during the year\nprior to the survey. About two-thirds of per-\nsons who changed plans stayed in the same\nplan type (Exhibit 1), while about one-fourth\nswitched from a non-HMO to an HMO, and\n10.5 percent of changers switched from an\nHMO to a non-HMO.\nn Why do people change plans? Most\nchanges were made for reasons other than\nconsumer preference. About one-third cited a\nchange in employment, while 36.3 percent\ncited a change in employer plan offerings. Just\nunder one-fourth changed plans because of\nsome desired attribute of their current plan,\nincluding 16 percent who changed because\nthe current plan is less expensive and about 8\npercent, because their current plan has better\nservices, higher quality, preferred doctors, or\nmore convenient locations. About 4 percent\nchanged plans because of a change in their\neligibility (not shown), usually a change in\nmarital status or eligibility for a parent's plan.\nAbout another 4 percent changed plans for\nother miscellaneous reasons, or the reason\nwas not ascertained (not shown).\nPersons switching to an HMO were more\nlikely than other types of plan changers were\nto cite lower cost as the reason for changing\nplans. Despite the so-called consumer back-\nlash against managed care plans in recent\nyears, persons disenrolling from HMOs were\nonly slightly more likely than persons switch-\ning to HMOs to cite \"better services\" as the\nreason for change, although the difference was\nnot statistically significant. If disgruntlement\nwith HMOs is a major reason for switching to\nnon-HMOs, then it would have to be related\nto a change in employment. Persons disen-\nrolling from HMOs were more likely than\nother plan changers were to cite a change in\nemployment as the reason for their change,\nwhile significantly fewer persons switching\nto an HMO did so as a result of a job change.\nThis also suggests that it is much more dif-\nficult to draw the line between what repre-\nsents a \"voluntary\" versus an \"involuntary\"\nchange of plans. While termination of em-\nployment could result in an involuntary\nHMO enrollees\n(changed from a\nHMO disenrollees\n(changed from an\nChanged plans but\nChanged plans but\nNOTE: Sample includes only people continuously insured through private sources.\na Difference with persons switching to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a y / J u n e 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, as shown in\nExhibit 2, near-elderly persons (ages fifty-five\nto sixty-four), blacks, Hispanics, and persons\nin fair or poor health were less likely than\nothers were to change health plans.7 In addi-\ntion, changes of health plans were no more\nfrequent among persons with lower incomes\nor less education.\nWhen they do change plans, blacks and\npersons in fair or poor health who start out in\nnon-HMOs are more likely to switch to an\nHMO. Blacks who decide to change plans\nmay have either more constrained choices or\ngreater preferences for HMOs, which usually\nentail lower costs. Stronger preferences for\nHMOs among blacks would be consistent\nwith a previous study that found that blacks\nexpressed greater willingness than whites did\nto give up some choice in health care to save\non costs.8\nPersons with more-serious health prob-\nlems also may prefer HMOs when they switch\nplans to save on out-of-pocket costs (espe-\ncially since their health care use and costs\ntend to be much higher than average). The\nfindings also suggest that favorable selection\npractices among HMOs--to the extent that\nthey exist--are not so rampant as to prevent\npersons with high health care needs in general\nfrom switching to HMOs. On the other hand,\nthe greater use of services among those in fair\nor poor health also means that switching to an\nHMO may entail a greater risk if it means a\ndisruption in their care arrangements and the\nproviders they normally see.\nn Does greater choice lead to more\nplan switching? Although one might expect\nthat having a choice of plans through an em-\nployer would lead to more plan switching,\npersons offered only a single plan change as\noften as do those with some choice (presum-\nably because of an employer action).9\nHowever, when people do change health\nplans, having a choice is associated with a\nhigher likelihood of switching to an HMO.\nThis likelihood is as high for those who are\noffered a choice of HMO and non-HMO plans\nas it is for those offered any choice (findings\nnot shown). This suggests that the growth of\nmanaged care plans is not solely the result of\nemployers' \"forcing\" their workers into HMO\nplans by offering only HMOs, but also by em-\nployees seeking to save onout-of-pocket costs\nby enrolling in lower-cost HMOs.\nBut while choice of plans through employ-\ners may lead to more switching to HMO\nplans, persons choosing from plans in the\nnongroup market are more likely to disenroll\nfrom HMOs and less likely to switch to\nHMOs than are persons who obtain their in-\nsurance through employers. It is not clear\nwhy. However, any financial incentives that\nemployers offer their employees to enroll and\nstay in an HMO would not be available to\nthose in the nongroup market. Also, fewer\nHMOs offer nongroup policies, and if HMOs\nin the nongroup market are less stable or of\nlower quality than those in the group market,\nnegative experiences with these plans could\nlead to more disenrollment.10\nn Is plan switching more common in\nareas dominated by managed care?

One would expect\nthat the main impact of this activity on con-\nsumers would be an increased frequency of\nhealth plan changes. However, we found that\nthe rate of plan changing is only slightly\nhigher in areas with moderate or high HMO\nand point-of-service (POS) plan penetration\ncompared with areas with low penetration.11\nThus, to the extent that heavy managed care\nactivity is associated with greater turmoil in\nthe health insurance market (which we can-\nnot measure directly), the impact on consum-\ners appears to be fairly small.\nAs one would expect, persons in areas with\nhigh HMO/POS penetration who change\nplans are more likely than are persons in areas\nwith low penetration to switch to HMO\nplans, while low-penetration areas experi-\nence higher rates of disenrollment from\nHMOs. The comparable rates of switching to\nHMO and non-HMO plans in low-penetra-\nrespectively) suggests that overall HMO/POS\npenetration in these markets is not increasing.\nHowever, the higher rate of switching to\nHMO plans (compared with non-HMO\nswitching) in areas with moderate penetra-\ntion (20\u00ad40 percent) suggests that these areas\nwill eventually change to high-penetration ar-\neas. The much higher rate of switching to\nHMO plans in high-penetration areas sug-\ngests that HMOs will become even more\ndominant in these areas.\nn How often does plan changing result\nin a change in providers? Persons who\nchanged health plans were twice as likely as\npersons who did not change plans were to\nchange the place where they usually receive\nmedical care (Exhibit 3). In addition, a change\nin the usual source of care was found to be\nhigher for persons switching between HMO\nplans--or into or out of an HMO--compared\nwith persons who were switching between\nnon-HMO plans. This is consistent with the\nfact that non-HMO plans include traditional\nindemnity plans--which typically do not use\ndefined provider networks--as well as pre-\nferred provider organizations (PPOs) whose\nprovider networks tend to be larger and less\nexclusive than those of HMOs.\nFor these same reasons, however, it is\nsomewhat surprising that the rate of changing\nproviders is still relatively low (less than 30\npercent), even when the plan change involves\nan HMO. That most plan changers maintain\ntheir usual source of care suggests consider-\nPercentage Of Privately Insured Persons Who Changed Their Usual Source Of Care,\nNOTE: HMO is health maintenance organization.\na Difference with persons who did not change plans is statistically significant at the .05 level.\nAll privately insured persons\nPersons who did not change plans\nPersons who changed plans\nChanged from non-HMO to HMO\nChanged from HMO to non-HMO\nChanged from HMO to HMO\nChange from non-HMO to non-HMO\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Alternatively, some may exercise\nplan options to pay higher copayments for go-\ning outside the network (as with PPOs and\nPOS plans) or pay the full costs of medical\nvisits to keep seeing a physician with whom\nthey have a long-standing relationship.\nMoreover, even among those who changed\nboth their health plans and their usual source\nof care in the same year, only about half ex-\nplicitly cited changes in their insurance as the\nreason for changing their usual source of care\n(Exhibit 4). The rest cited quality, the avail-\nability of their previous usual source of care,\nor other reasons. While changes in insurance\nmay be indirectly related to some of these\nother reasons, these findings suggest that\neven fewer provider changes are directly asso-\nciated with a change in health plans.\nIt is important to note that these results do\nnot allow us to determine whether or not the\nchange in insurance actually caused the\nchange in usual source of care (that is,\nwhether the plan change occurred before or\nafter the change in providers). With the al-\nmost universal use of provider networks by\nmanaged care plans, it also is possible that\nsome consumers change plans to gain access\nto a provider in a different network.\nDiscussion\nTwo contradictory perspectives on the merits\nof plan changing have emerged. The \"con-\nsumer choice\" perspective holds that a change\nmay allow consumers to obtain a plan that\nbest suits their needs, and the resulting com-\npetition among health plans leads to both\nlower costs and higher quality. The key as-\nsumption behind this view is that health plan\nswitching reflects consumers' choice.\nAnother perspective stresses that health\nplan switching can lead to a change in physi-\ncians, thus disrupting the patient/provider re-\nlationship and continuity of care. A key as-\nsumption behind this view is that consumers'\nactual choices are limited, and hence most\nplan changes are involuntary.\nThe results from this study suggest that\nconsumer choice is directly involved in only\nabout one-fourth of plan changes and that\nmost changing is the result of a job change or\na change in employers' plan offerings. On the\nother hand, consumer choice appears to play a\nsomewhat larger role in switching to HMOs.\nWhile this may in part reflect the fact that\nsome consumers cannot afford other options,\nwe did not find a significantly higher rate of\nswitching to HMO plans among low-income\npersons. Rather than strictly being an issue of\naffordability, a desire for lower health care\ncosts is something that consumers value, and\nmost have expressed a willingness to accept\nsome restrictions on their care to save on\nAlthough we could not examine how plan\nchanges directly affected health care access,\nuse, or perceived quality, it appears that major\ndisruptions in care through a change in\nproviders does not occur as often as one might\nexpect, although some plan changers might\nincur higher out-of-pocket costs in order to\nkeep seeing the same physician.
