Peripheral arterial disease defined by an ankle brachial index ,0.90. Glo-\nmerular filtration rate estimated using cystatin C was more strongly associated with PAD compared with eGFR using\nserum creatinine before and after multivariable adjustment. Further, after adjustment for cystatin C, kidney function\nbased on serum creatinine was no longer significantly associated with PAD. However, cystatin C remained signifi-\ncantly associated with PAD even after adjustment for GFR estimated by serum creatinine. Compared with optimal\nkidney function (eGFRserum creatinine\ninterval 1.26\u00ad7.64) for preclinical CKD (eGFRserum creatinine\n`confirmed' CKD (eGFRserum creatinine\nConclusion Chronic kidney disease was strongly and independently associated with PAD.

Previous\nstudies have documented the high risk of cardiovascular disease\namong individuals with CKD.1,2 However, less is known of the\nrelationship of CKD to lower extremity peripheral arterial\ndisease (PAD), a common condition caused by the development\nof atherosclerosis in the lower extremities. Limb amputation, a fre-\nquent clinical complication of PAD, is common among individuals\nwith kidney disease3,4 and diabetes,5 but the association of subcli-\nnical PAD and moderately decreased kidney function is not well\ncharacterized. Serum creatinine is the most common clinical\nmarker of kidney function and is used in conjunction with math-\nematical equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate\n(GFR) and to diagnose and define the stages of CKD.6 Several\nrecent studies have shown an independent association between\nCKD--as defined by serum creatinine-based estimating\nequations--and PAD in the general population.7\u00ad 9 Serum cystatin\nC, a novel marker of kidney function, is thought to be less affected\nby age, gender, and body composition than serum creatinine and\nhas been reported to be superior for the estimation of kidney\nfunction, particularly in the presence of mild to moderate kidney\ndisease and in older individuals.10 \u00ad14 An important clinical question\nPublished on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

We hypothesized that: (i) kidney function\nwould be associated with PAD independently of known cardiovas-\ncular risk factors; (ii) GFR estimated using cystatin C would be\nmore strongly associated with PAD when compared with that esti-\nmated from serum creatinine; and (iii) cystatin C would add\nadditional risk stratification information within currently defined\ncategories of kidney function using serum creatinine.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is\nan ongoing cross-sectional, multistage, stratified, clustered probability\nsample of the US civilian non-institutionalized population. Detailed\nin-person interviews, physical examinations, and blood samples were\npersons aged 60 or older and a 25% random sample of participants\naged ,60 years were selected for measurement of serum cystatin\nC.16 Serum was available for the measurement of cystatin C on\npresent analyses, we further limited our study sample to individuals\nnon-missing information on lower extremity PAD (only assessed in\nparticipants aged 40 and older), for a final study sample size of 3089\nadults (83% of eligible participants).\nAssessment of lower extremity peripheral\narterial disease\nPeripheral arterial disease can be determined with high sensitivity and\nspecificity using the ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to\nthat in the arm (ankle brachial index, ABI).17,18 We defined PAD on the\nparticipants aged 40 and over during the examination component of\nthe survey. In NHANES, the established ABI technique employed\nmeasurement of systolic blood pressure at the right brachial artery\nand at both posterior tibial arteries using Doppler ultrasound. If the\nparticipant had a medical condition that did not permit the use of\nright arm measurement, the left arm was used for brachial pressure\nmeasurement. Systolic blood pressure was measured twice at each\nlimb site for participants aged 40\u00ad59 and once at each site for partici-\npants aged 60 and over. The left and right ABI measurements were\nobtained by dividing the mean systolic blood pressure in the left and\nright ankle, respectively, by the mean blood pressure in the arm. Per-\nipheral arterial disease was defined as an ABI ,0.90 in either leg. We\nexcluded individuals with ABI .1.5, values usually related to non-\ncompressible vessels in the legs.\nMeasures of kidney function\nBlood samples were collected by trained personnel. Serum creatinine\nwas measured using a kinetic rate Jaffe method.19\u00ad21 To appropriately\nestimate GFR, all serum creatinine measurements were re-calibrated\nto standardized creatinine measurements obtained at the Cleveland\nClinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH, USA) as detailed\nrecently.21 A re-calibration equation was applied to serum creatinine\nClinical Research Laboratory. Samples were assayed for cystatin C with\na particle-enhanced immuno-nephelometric assay (N Latex Cystatin C,\nDade Behring, IL, USA).22\nThe estimation of kidney function, accounting for age, sex, and race\nin serum creatinine-based estimating equations, is crucial as these\nfactors influence serum creatinine production. Serum creatinine-based\nGFR was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal\nDisease (MDRD) Study formula re-expressed to use standard\nSerum cystatin C concentrations are less related to age, sex, and\nrace, and we therefore estimated GFR from cystatin C using a single\nvariable equation consisting of a mathematical transformation of cysta-\nequivalent to modelling raw cystatin C levels but with a transformation\nto achieve commensurate units of estimated GFR; the ranking of\nindividuals is unchanged. We also evaluated a GFR equation, including\ncystatin C in combination with age, sex, and race (cystatin C multivari-\nIn all equations, estimated GFR is reported in mL/min/1.73 m2, race/\nethnicity was either black or not, and values that exceeded 200 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2 were truncated at that level. Kidney function was categor-\nized based on the classification system established by the National\nKidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative.26 Indi-\nviduals with eGFR ,15 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from analyses\nof kidney function categories because estimates of this stage of kidney\ndisease are likely to be unreliable due to the small number of individ-\nuals and the likelihood of being ill or receiving dialysis would depress\nthe response rate.\nWe also conducted analyses combining serum creatinine and cysta-\ntin C eGFR categories, utilizing cystatin C as a `confirmatory' test. We\ndivided persons with normal kidney function (eGFR !60 by MDRD)\ninto categories according to cystatin C level, using a cystatin C cut\npoint of 1.0 mg/L (equivalent to eGFR 76.7 by serum cystatin C\nusing the single variable equation) to define `pre-clinical CKD',27 gen-\nerating the following categories: eGFR !60 by MDRD and !90 by\ncystatin C (`optimal' kidney function), eGFR !60 by MDRD and\n76.7\u00ad89 by cystatin C (`low normal' kidney function), and eGFR\n!60 by MDRD and ,76.7 by cystatin C (`pre-clinical' kidney\ndisease). In those persons defined as having CKD (eGFR 30\u00ad59 by\nMDRD), we used cystatin C to `confirm' the diagnosis, classifying\nthese individuals into the following categories: eGFR ,30\u00ad59 by\nMDRD and !60 by cystatin C (`unconfirmed' CKD) and eGFR\n,30\u00ad59 by MDRD and ,60 by cystatin C (`confirmed' CKD). Individ-\nuals with eGFR 15\u00ad29 by MDRD were defined as having severe CKD.6\nOther study variables\nThe NHANES examination included measurement of height, weight,\nand blood pressure. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic\nblood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater, a mean diastolic blood\npressure of 90 mmHg or greater, or hypertension medication use.\nTotal cholesterol was measured enzymatically.20 Hypercholesterolae-\nmia was defined as a total cholesterol level 240 mg/dL or higher, or\nmedication use. Diabetes was defined by a self-reported physician diag-\nnosis. Persons reporting `borderline diabetes' or solely reporting a\nKidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and PAD 1919\ndiabetes diagnosis during pregnancy were considered non-diabetic.\nInformation on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking was based on self-\nreport during the questionnaire portion of the survey. A history of car-\ndiovascular disease was defined on the basis of a self-reported history\nof coronary heart disease, angina, previous heart attack, or stroke.\nSmoking status was determined using answers to the questions,\n`Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?' and `Do you\nnow smoke cigarettes?' We also examined cotinine levels, a major\nmetabolite of nicotine, and a commonly used marker for both active\nand second-hand cigarette smoke exposure. Serum cotinine was\nmeasured by an HPLC/atmospheric-pressure ionization tandem mass\nspectrometry method. Detailed information regarding the collection\nof data in NHANES is available elsewhere.15\nStatistical analysis\nticipants (25% stratified random sample of individuals with valid serum\ncreatinine levels), the original examination sampling weights require\nmodification to provide nationally representative estimates and\naddress potential bias. Modification of the original sampling weights\nto account for both missing serum creatinine and cystatin C was per-\nformed by the investigators (E.S. and J.C.) according to standard\nmethods,28 and protocols were reviewed and approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The modified sampling\nweights were applied in all analyses and standard errors for estimates\nwere obtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method.29\nAdjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nwere estimated using logistic regression models. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using Stata v10.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX,\nUSA) svy commands.\nProtocols for conduct of NHANES were approved by the NCHS\ninstitutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants. Both the NCHS and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health institutional review boards approved the pro-\ntocols for measurement of cystatin C from stored serum samples.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.\nCompared with individuals without PAD, those with PAD were\nolder, more likely to be non-Hispanic black, current or former\nsmokers, and more likely to have major cardiovascular risk\nfactors. Levels of serum creatinine, cystatin C, GFR estimated\nusing the serum creatinine equation (2005 MDRD formula), the\nsingle variable cystatin C equation, and the multivariable cystatin\nC equation all indicated lower average kidney function among indi-\nviduals with PAD compared with those without PAD in this unad-\njusted comparison.\nThe crude prevalence of CKD was much higher among individ-\nuals with PAD compared with those without PAD or the overall\npopulation. The prevalence estimates of CKD (eGFR ,60) using\nthe serum creatinine equation, cystatin C only, and the multivari-\ncorresponding prevalence of CKD in the total population aged\nFigure 1 displays the continuous unadjusted association between\neGFR and PAD for each GFR estimating equation. Lower kidney\nfunction (lower estimated GFR) was strongly associated with an\nincreased probability of PAD across the spectrum of kidney func-\ntion in this general population. Figure 1 illustrates the stronger\nassociation of GFR estimated using cystatin C compared with\nserum creatinine, particularly at lower levels of kidney function.\nIndeed, cystatin C appears much more strongly associated with\nPAD at estimated GFR levels below 60 when compared with esti-\nmated GFR using serum creatinine.\nBefore conducting multivariable models, we examined the distri-\nbution of risk factors across definitions of CKD using serum crea-\ntinine and cystatin C (Table 2). These results show relative\ndifferences in the strength of potentially important confounders\nin the CKD\u00adPAD association using different definitions of CKD.\nMost factors were similar across the CKD definitions (Table 2)\nwith the exception of hypertension, history of cardiovascular\ndisease, and smoking status. In particular, the prevalence of\ncurrent smoking and serum cotinine level were substantially\nhigher in cystatin C-defined CKD compared with creatinine-\ndefined CKD. In multivariable models of CKD adjusted for all vari-\nables listed in Table 2, hypertension, history of cardiovascular\ndisease, and smoking all remained significantly associated with\ncystatin C-defined CKD but not creatinine-defined CKD (data\nnot show). We adjusted for these risk factors in subsequent multi-\nvariable models of kidney function and PAD prevalence. Body mass\nindex and waist circumference were also more strongly associated\nwith GFR equations using cystatin C when compared with that\nusing serum creatinine; however, measures of adiposity were not\nfound to be important risk factors for PAD in this study.\nThe adjusted ORs for PAD by categories of kidney function are\npresented in Table 3. Model 1 (adjusted for age only) shows a\nstrong, graded association between level of kidney function and\nPAD across all kidney function equations. The association persisted\neven after multivariable adjustment for important PAD risk factors\n(age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterole-\nmia, history of cardiovascular disease, and smoking status) (Model\n2). The association of kidney function with PAD was consistently\nstronger using GFR estimated from cystatin C compared with\nserum creatinine-based GFR. Models 3 and 4 are the same as\nModel 2, but further simultaneously adjusted for the other\nmeasure of kidney function. In Model 3, the logistic models of\neGFR categories defined by serum creatinine are adjusted for all\nvariables in Model 2 plus additional adjustment for categories of\neGFR defined by the single variable cystatin C equation. Similarly,\nthe logistic models of eGFR categories and CKD defined by cysta-\ntin C are adjusted for eGFR defined by the serum creatinine eGFR\nequation. Model 4 is similar to Model 3 except that the simul-\ntaneous adjustment for kidney function is conducted with the\nrespective eGFR kidney function variable modelled continuously\n(instead of clinical categories). Models 3 and 4 demonstrate that\nafter adjustment for cystatin C (using the single variable equation),\nkidney function categories defined by serum creatinine are no\nlonger significantly associated with PAD. However, all kidney func-\ntion categories defined by cystatin C using either the single or the\nmultivariable equations remain significantly associated with PAD\neven after adjustment for eGFR estimated by serum creatinine.\nSensitivity analyses (data not shown) using models with additional\nadjustment for serum cotinine and measures of adiposity (body\nE. Selvin et al.\nmass index and waist circumference), stratification by smoking\nstatus, and exclusion of individuals with a history of cardiovascular\ndisease did not appreciably alter any of these results.\nThe adjusted ORs for PAD according to categories of kidney\nfunction defined by both serum creatinine and cystatin C are pre-\nsented in Table 4. A dose\u00adresponse relation was present across all\nsix kidney function categories defined using a combination of\nserum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Indeed, among persons\nwith normal kidney function defined by serum creatinine (eGFR\n!60 by MDRD), cystatin C remained significantly associated with\nprevalent PAD. The OR of PAD for `pre-clinical CKD' was 3.11\n(1.26\u00ad7.64). Among persons with CKD defined by serum creati-\nnine (eGFR ,60 by MDRD), cystatin C also appeared to further\nrefine risk categories.

Because\nthe presence of PAD is known to confer a high risk for cardiovas-\ncular outcomes, the condition is considered a coronary heart\ndisease `risk equivalent'.30,31 This is of particular importance in\nthe setting of low kidney function as CKD is also independently\nassociated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular events.1,2 The\nhigh prevalence of CKD in persons with PAD suggests that screen-\ning for CKD might be considered in individuals with a low ABI and/\nor symptomatic PAD.\nThis study demonstrates a robust, graded, and independent associ-\nation between kidney function--assessed using serum creatinine and/\nor serum cystatin C--and PAD. The association was observed across\nthe normal range of kidney function in a nationally representative\nsample of US adults 40 and older. Cystatin C and GFR estimated\nusing cystatin C were more strongly associated with PAD than GFR\nestimated using serum creatinine, particularly at low GFR levels.\nIndeed, our models with simultaneous adjustment for both serum\ncreatinine and cystatin C suggest that cystatin C captures most of\nFigure 1 Probability of peripheral arterial disease by level of\nkidney function comparing glomerular filtration rate estimating\nequations (mL/min/1.732) using the Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease serum creatinine equation, a single variable cystatin\nC equation, and a multivariable cystatin C equation, US adults\n.................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\nTable 2 Population characteristics of US adults aged 40 years or older by chronic kidney disease status defined by\nestimating equations for glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine or serum cystatin C, NHANES 1999\u00ad2002\nSerum creatinine, MDRD\nCystatin C, single variable\nCystatin C, multiple\nvariable equation eGFR <60\nSex\nRace/ethnicitya\nSmoking status\nPAD, peripheral arterial disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IQR, inter-quartile range; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Previous studies have not directly compared serum creati-\nnine and cystatin C GFR estimating equations in their association\nwith clinical outcomes.\nRecently, a case\u00adcontrol study demonstrated higher levels of\ncystatin C in PAD patients compared with controls.32 A large\ncohort study in elderly adults found that cystatin C was associated\nwith incident severe PAD (defined by surgical procedures, related\nhospitalizations, and amputation), whereas creatinine level and\nserum creatinine-based eGFR were not associated with future\nPAD events.33 The authors found the risk of PAD associated\nwith cystatin C did not increase in a stepwise fashion; the observed\nincrease was present only at the highest quintile of cystatin\nC. However, the overall number of severe PAD events observed\nin this elderly cohort was small. In contrast, our data suggest\nthat kidney function is associated with PAD across the normal\nrange, with no evidence for a threshold effect.\nOur results contribute to the debate regarding the clinical utility\nof serum cystatin C. This study adds to the accumulating evidence\nthat moderately impaired kidney function may play a role in the\ndevelopment of cardiovascular disease.34,35 Recent data suggest\nthat GFR estimating equations based on cystatin C may provide\nsimilar but less confounded (by muscle mass and co-morbidities)\nestimates of kidney function than equations using serum creati-\nnine,25 and previous studies have shown that cystatin C is more\nhighly correlated with measured GFR than is serum creati-\nnine.12,14,34 Our results suggest that GFR equations using cystatin\nC are also more strongly associated with PAD when compared\nwith the currently used serum creatinine MDRD formula.\nOur findings also raise the possibility that cystatin C may be a\nrisk marker for atherosclerotic disease through mechanisms\nother than kidney function. We found an independent association\nof cystatin C with PAD even after adjustment for kidney function\nestimated from serum creatinine. Nonetheless, it is unclear from\nthese data whether this independent association is a result of\nincomplete adjustment for kidney function--particularly when\nmuscle mass is reduced--or whether this finding represents a\ntrue independent (non-renal) association of cystatin C with\nlower extremity disease.\nImportant limitations of this study include reliance on estimated\nGFR rather than measured GFR, a more precise but also more\nburdensome measure of kidney function not feasible to obtain in\nroutine clinical or research settings. Because this is a cross-\nsectional study, we also cannot determine the directionality of\nthe observed associations nor draw firm conclusions regarding\ncausality.\nSome strengths of this study include the large sample size, the\nrigorous measurement of risk factors and serum markers of\nkidney function by trained personnel according to standardized\nprotocols, and the nationally representative study design. Kidney\nfunction and ABI were assessed in all participants regardless of\nthe participant's or their physician's awareness of the condition.\nFinally, the cross-section design is similar to the clinical situation\nwhere a physician is faced with a PAD patient with or without\nIn conclusion, we found that CKD was strongly and indepen-\ndently associated with PAD, suggesting that kidney function may\nbe related to the development of atherosclerosis in the lower\nextremities. We also found that cystatin C was a much more\npotent marker of lower extremity PAD when compared with\nthe serum creatinine equation currently used in clinical practice\nto estimate kidney function. Indeed, the association of cystatin C\nwith PAD persisted even after adjustment for kidney function esti-\nmated from serum creatinine. Ultimately, our results suggest that\ncystatin C may be an important marker of atherosclerotic vascular\ndisease in the lower extremities and may have clinical utility when\ncombined with serum creatinine in the evaluation of individuals\nwho may have PAD.\nFunding\nfrom the German Research Foundation.
