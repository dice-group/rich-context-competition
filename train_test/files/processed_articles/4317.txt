Specifically, Maslow proposed that adults would be motivated to satisfy their unfilled needs\nuntil they reached the hierarchy's apex and achieved self-transcendence. Yet how adults can purposefully ascend Maslow's\npyramid through satisfying unfilled needs remains elusive. This brief article challenges this on the theory's 70th anniversary by\npresenting a new image of the needs hierarchy, based on ecological design principles to support adults' purposeful endeavors\nto climb the needs pyramid.\n",

It is now 70 years\nsince Maslow (1943a) proposed his theory of human adult\nmotivation as the process of satisfying needs arranged in\nhierarchical levels of prepotency, now often simplified to the\nvisual image of a pyramid. For Maslow, adults were a driven\nwere satisfied. Maslow however did not provide a means for\nsatisfying those unfilled needs and from this author's\nresearch neither did he produce the iconic pyramid image.\nReferring back to Maslow's original papers, the closest indi-\ncation of a pyramid hierarchy appears to be\nfor the sake of illustration, it is as if the average citizen is\nsatisfied perhaps 85 per cent in his physiological needs, 70 per\ncent in his safety needs, 50 per cent in his love needs, 40 per cent\nin his self-esteem needs, and 10 per cent in his self-actualization\nWhen an image such as the pyramid image is used to\ndescribe a process, that image becomes a diagram, and ulti-\nmately for a diagram to work the meaning of the original idea\nand the visual representation must be maintained. Yet the\npyramid diagram goes further than Maslow proposed by\nconstraining the theory within a framework of solid lines and\ntextures that compartmentalize each needs stage into distinct\ntiers. These subsequent additions are not acting as separators\nbut boundaries, generating false mental representations that\nmay hinder an adult's ability to recognize the early appear-\nance of satisfied or emergent needs. Furthermore, without\nthe support of an appropriate mental model, adults can fail to\nsolve problems effectively. This is supported from numerous\nstudies that show that adults who consider they cannot per-\nform a task, such as walking up stairs, do not try (Warren &\nWhang, 1987) or when they do not see the action potential of\na horizontal door handle, do not see the potential to open the\ndoor (Tipper, Paul, & Hayes, 2006). Considered together it is\nquestionable that the pyramid of needs as a diagram ade-\nquately represents Maslow's theory of motivation.\nIn devising a diagram for Maslow's needs hierarchy, we\nmust avoid creating mental barriers that could discourage a\nperson from believing they can pass from one level of the\nhierarchy to the next. It should also provide a means of show-\ning the degree of needs satiety at each stage and offer support\nin developing unsatisfied needs by identifying the develop-\nmental needs that will aid an owner's ascension through the\nhierarchy. However, a problem lies in how a person can first\naccess their own needs hierarchy to assess their levels of\nneeds satiety. To address this, we can use a new technology\ncalled Emergent Feature Displays (EID; Vicente &\nRasmussen, 1992) to provide a direct perceptual interface\nbetween a person and their own hierarchy of needs.\nThe Ecological Interface (EI) Effect\nEI displays work by showing the results in the form of a\nshape instead of displaying the results of data searches as\nbits of related information for a person to mentally manipu-\nlate. An example of the EI effect is when we purchase a\nlarge product over the Internet, but when a small package\narrives we can immediately see that it does not contain our\n1Independent Researcher, Surrey, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJ.

Preliminary\ninvestigations suggest that such direct perception may be\nuseful when looking for patterns in data, such as the early\nidentification of cardiovascular disease (McEwen, Flach, &\nElder, 2012) and anesthesia monitoring in noisy operating\nrooms (Watson, Russell, & Sanderson, 2007). Hazardous\nareas are also suggested to benefit from the EI effect where\noperators need to be able to quickly assimilate operational\nstatus, such as the petrochemical industry (Jamieson, 2002),\nmilitary tactical operations (Hall, Shattuck, & Bennett,\n2012), and in nuclear power stations (Kim, Suh, Jang, Hong,\nin their study of tactical commanders (N = 16) who com-\npleted reports using information taken from either tradi-\ntional or EI displays, not only were EID reports completed\nfaster and with more accuracy, but the EI went further, sup-\nporting participants' decision making and evoking their\nexpertise. One account for this is that EID supports the deci-\nsion-making process by not drawing heavily on an opera-\ntor's limited cognitive resources as the task becomes more\ncognitively challenging (Vicente & Rasmussen, 1992). The\naviation sector is another emerging area where EID is con-\nsidered useful as pilots are not able to see the operational\nstatus of their aircraft when airborne and rely on instruments\nto provide in-flight status information. Coekin (1969) pro-\nduced a feature display that was adapted by Dinadis and\nVicente (1999) as part of a new instrument panel providing\npilots with functional and overall status of an aircraft's\nengines when in flight. It is an adaptation of this display that\nforms the basis for a person to see their hierarchy of needs\nand measure needs satiety.\nThe Design\nFigure 1 shows an adaptation of Dinadis and Vicente's (1999)\nprototype instrument display that was developed on EI\ndesign principles for pilots to monitor the in-flight health of\nthe Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft's engines.\nThe star diagrams (Coekin, 1969) in the top row show\neach engine's current operational performance through a\ndynamic status line superimposed onto a static octagon dia-\ngram incorporated into the display. Each axis represents a\npredefined subsection of an engine's operating parameter\n(e.g., fuel, oil, air, etc.) with colored tick marks along the\nlength indicating degrees of alarm should the parameter fail.\nMore tick marks extend the star diagram's outer rim\nmark indicating the engine's safety envelope, the engine's\nutmost functional capability before capacity thresholds are\nbreached. Each engine has its own state diagram in the shape\nof a trapezium below it that shows the engine's higher order\nperformance parameters, for example, 0 to 1 Heat, 1 to 2\nWind flow, and so on. As shown in Figure 1. Engine 1 is\nperforming as expected, and therefore, its star diagram and\nstate diagrams are symmetrical. However, Engine 2 is func-\ntioning outside operational expectations, and therefore, the\nsuperimposed line in the star diagram has moved toward the\nerrant parameter's axis alarm tick thus incurring loss of\nshape symmetry. The color of the entire polygon then\nchanges to the same color as the most acute alarm tick iden-\ntified by the status line. Simultaneously that engine's state\ndiagram loses shape symmetry in a manner indicative of the\nengine's overall health. For example, in Figure 1, Engine 2\nshows some problem with the temperature and air so the\ncorresponding state diagram below shows a loss of shape\nsymmetry between the higher order stages 4 to 5--the tur-\nbines output.\nIt is the principles used here to monitor the aircraft's in-\nflight health that form the basis and process for adults to\nclimb Maslow's pyramid.\nClimbing the Needs Pyramid\nFigure 2 is the same engine display adapted to reflect\nMaslow's (1943a) original hierarchy of needs. Now pre-\nsented as a computer or phone application, Engine 1 is\nreplaced by a circular hierarchy of needs sectioned into five\nsegments, each representing one stage in the needs hierarchy.\nThe outer rim tick marks have been removed to encourage\nadults to apply their resources only within the circle.\nThe solid axes that previously displayed the engine's\nfunctional parameters are now serrated; acting as a scale to\nshow the satisfaction of each needs components and, as a\nvisual prompt to remind the owner of the transferability of\nlearned skills and the dynamic manner of needs satiety. A\ncentrally placed traffic light system with subdued amber and\nred color coding now functions to alert, not alarm, the owner\nof concerning unsatisfied needs per stage.

Adapted from Dinadis and Vicente (1999).\nself-perceived assessment of their top-down endeavors to fill\ntheir bottom-up unsatisfied needs identified in the needs\nhierarchy. The state trapezium shape is replaced by Maslow's\npyramid to provide a visual overview of the owner's self-\nperceived degree of needs satiety with their current develop-\nmental stage highlighted.\nFigure 2 shows one possible distribution of Maslow's\nillustration of the average person's satisfied needs mentioned\nearlier. Typically figures would be provided by the owner\nwho chooses what percentage they believe each component\nof a need is satisfied gained from a needs satisfaction check-\nlist (the appendix). Percentages are then ranked with the\nhighest and lowest figures shown between the relevant needs\nsegment's axes. This is a departure from Dinadis & Vicente's\ndisplay that shows the engine's functional status on one axis.\nHowever, by using the space between the axes we can now\nreveal the functional behavior of the needs components--the\ndevelopmental needs. The emergent feature now shows the\nowner's hierarchy of needs and the owner's concern of each\nstage's component needs. These color-coded results are then\ntransferred to the hierarchy of needs pyramid below that now\nacts as the owner's state diagram.\nIn Figure 2, we can see from the shape's loss of symmetry\ninto the amber alert zone that there is a needs component in\nthe Safety needs stage that is causing the owner concern. The\nowner however is not obliged to satisfy this need and is free\nto choose which outstanding needs to develop based on need\nmotivation, the position of the superimposed line to an alert\nzone, what resources are available (from the checklist), and\npersonal desires. Nevertheless the EI effect is supporting the\nowner in their choice of which needs stage to address by\ndrawing their attention to the alert. Identifying which partic-\nular component is generating the alert (security of employ-\nment) can then be gained from the checklist. If the owner\nchooses to remove the threat causing the amber alert they\ncould draw on their \"security of resources\" component, and\nperhaps choose to enroll on an educational course to enhance\ntheir job prospects with the support from their spouse, Stage\n3--Love needs.\nOnce enrolled Student Services or the Internet can pro-\nvide the important variables involved in successful study,\nthat is, library skills, efficient note taking, and so on, which\nare then added one variable per segment to the current task\ncircle. The number of segments in the task circle can be\nFigure 2. Example of an adults completed circle of needs with an academic task circle.\nNote. The state diagram is now a typical hierarchy of needs pyramid showing needs deficits by stage, stage significance, and self-perceived degree of concern.\n4 SAGE Open\nincreased or reduced as required to accommodate the amount\nof key variables necessary for success. Each academic term\ncan then be time-tabled on Pareto principles and incorpo-\nrated into a countdown organizer such as the Franklin\nPlanner, Gantt chart, or a similar Student's Services initia-\ntive. Figure 2 also shows the emergent feature extending the\ncircle rim suggesting excessive resources are being allocated\nto one segment while another segment is approaching the\namber alert, for example, procrastination. Suitable progress\nis gained by the owner trying to regain circle symmetry\nthroughout their course by adhering to the important variable\nrequirements for their chosen task and, in achieving this,\nmoves them away from the central alerting zones.\nAnother scenario for Figure 2 could be that of an obese\nowner who agrees their Safety needs are not satisfied yet\nchooses to develop their Esteem needs (self-esteem) that\nalso benefits their Safety needs (affordable health insur-\nance) by incorporating key variables identified with suc-\ncessful weight loss onto the task circle, that is, exercise,\nfood choices, counseling, and so on. Alternatively, Figure 2\ncould be that of an individual employee in the workplace\nwho wants to satisfy their Love needs so attends the organi-\nzations' health and fitness initiatives, boosting their group\nmembership component and also perceived job security\n(Safety need). According to Maslow once the owner's unsat-\nisfied needs start being filled new needs in the next stage of\nthe hierarchy emerge and so the cycle of redrawing the cir-\ncle of needs, identifying the new emergent features then\nchoosing tasks to satisfy those needs restarts at a higher tier\nof the hierarchy and so forth till the owner reaches the apex.\nKeeping needs satisfied so as not to descend the pyramid\nrequires following chosen task requirements, for example,\nclients attend all scheduled therapy appointments, students\npassing all academic assignments, or an employee's sus-\ntained better time-keeping practices. In this manner, an\nadult's path through the needs hierarchy is guided and not\ndictated, by the internal traffic light system, the location of\nthe deviation from shape symmetry, the results from the\nchecklist, what is meaningful to the owner, and the resources\nthey have available.\nHowever, there are limitations that need further investiga-\ntion, for example, we know more about the lower hierarchi-\ncal needs than the higher stage needs that may restrict the\nowner's choice of needs components as they rise through the\nchecklist. Another consideration is what impact is there on a\nperson's ability to effectively problem solve now the devel-\nopmental and deficiency needs are incorporated into the EI\neffect. Moreover, the owner must estimate what percentage\nthey think each need is satisfied, unlike that of an aircraft\nengine where every part and its functioning are known and\nfed directly into the display. Clearly then this presentation\nwill need further investigation; however, it suggests an alter-\nnative view of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the process by\nwhich people could ascend the needs hierarchy and offers\nfurther opportunities to empirically measure needs satiety\nand human motivation.\nAppendix\nOne Possible Distribution of Maslow's Average Person's Satisfied Needs\nNeeds Satisfaction Checklist.\nStage 1--The physiological needs Percentage satisfied Percentages ranked Highest/lowest\n(continued)\n Stage 2--The safety needs Percentage satisfied Percentages ranked Highest/lowest\n4 Security of employment Amber 80 \n Stage 3--The love needs Percentage satisfied Percentages ranked Highest/lowest\n Stage 4--The esteem needs Percentage satisfied Percentages ranked Highest/lowest\n Stage 5--Self-actualization Percentage satisfied Percentages ranked Highest/lowest\nAppendix (continued)\n6 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nCoekin, J.
