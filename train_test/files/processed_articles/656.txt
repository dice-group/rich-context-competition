By then, our nation was in the midst of the current epidemic\nof tobacco-related disease. The ensuing 3 decades of experience\nsince the original Surgeon General's report on tobacco smoking\nhave brought additional sobering insights. First, adverse health\nconsequences extend to noninhaled forms of tobacco (3). Sec-\nond, simple provision of information about the consequences of\ntobacco use to the public is insufficient to end the epidemic. Less\nthan 3% of smokers become nonsmokers each year (4). Third,\ntobacco use is not simply a habit, but an addiction. Less than\n15% of Americans who quit smoking for a day remain abstinent\n1 year later (4,5). Finally, and tragically, with its inception in\nearly adolescence, tobacco addiction is a pediatric disease, not\nsimply an affliction of adulthood. The median age of initiation to\ntobacco use is below 15 years in many countries (6).\nThe treatment of nicotine dependence may require the same\ntype of behavioral, societal, and pharmacologic strategies ex-\ntended to the management of other abused substances, such as\nalcohol, cocaine, and heroin. With this in mind, the American\nSociety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI) convened a symposium in June 1996 on tobacco\naddiction. Additional support for the symposium was provided\nby the American Medical Women's Association and the Ameri-\ncan Society of Preventive Oncology. In keeping with ASCO's\npublished position statement on tobacco control (7), the goals of\nthis conference were to describe the burden and public health\nconsequences of tobacco addiction, to describe the state of sci-\nence for the treatment of nicotine dependence, and to explore\nnew strategies to increase quit rates and to prevent the uptake of\ntobacco use. This article cannot review all aspects of nicotine\ndependence, but it will summarize and integrate the meeting\npresentations on tobacco addiction and include the topics of\nsmoking prevalence; biologic aspects of nicotine dependence;\nand implications for disease, treatment, and prevention.

In the United States, there are an estimated 434000\ndeaths per year from tobacco use, equating to about 1200 per day\nor about 50 per hour. Tobacco is responsible for the yearly\ndeaths of more Americans than alcohol, cocaine, heroin, homi-\ncide, suicide, car accidents, fires, and acquired immunodeficien-\ncy syndrome combined (9).\nApproximately one quarter of the U.S. adult population\nmately one fifth of U.S. high school seniors smoke daily. The\nrate is much greater among school dropouts. After a decline\nstable rates, current smoking among high school students in-\n(12,13). Thus, adult smokers who quit or die are being replaced\nby children who smoke.\nThere have also been sharp increases in the past 2 decades in\nthe use of smokeless tobacco, occurring almost exclusively\nder age 25 years who reported using either chewing tobacco or\nmoist snuff rose from 2.2% to 8.4%. During the same period,\ncigarette smoking for this group declined from 38% to 22.9%.\nMore than 5 million users of moist snuff are reported in the\nUnited States alone (14).\nIn recent decades, U.S. rates of lung cancer have increased\namong both men and women, and, in the late 1980s, lung cancer\nsurpassed breast cancer as the most common cancer killer of\nwomen. Recently, a decline has been observed in age-adjusted\nmortality from lung cancer among men, consistent with their\nreduction in smoking (15). Unfortunately, this decline has not\nyet been observed among women, for whom the increase in lung\ncancer mortality continues. This pattern is consistent with the\nfact that the rise in women's smoking occurred subsequent to\nThe impact of smoking is a growing worldwide problem.\nthere would be about 2 million deaths attributable to smoking--\n1.5 million men and 0.5 million women. In the former socialist\neconomies of Eastern Europe, serious increases in smoking-\nattributed deaths are occurring, particularly among men. Rates\nfor women are steadily increasing, but at a lower rate than for\nmen; however, these rates are expected to increase as tobacco\nmarketing efforts focus on these women.\nReliable data are more difficult to obtain from some of the\ndeveloping countries. The general pattern reported is a high\nprevalence of smoking among men (for example, >60% in Ban-\ngladesh and India) but much lower use among women (except-\ning Nepal, which has high rates among both men and women).\nA similar pattern is seen in the Pacific Region, including China,\nwhere estimates in the 1980s showed more than 60% of men but\nless than 10% of women smoking (18). The concern is that\ntobacco marketing will target the women in these populations.\nPeto et al. have estimated that global tobacco-related deaths\nglobal tobacco-related deaths could exceed 10 million annually\n(19). The World Health Organization projects that, unless some-\nthing is done, one in 10 people now alive will die of a tobacco-\nrelated disease.\nBenefits of Quitting\nThe benefits of cessation and their impact on the public health\nare substantial. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers exhibit a\ndose-dependent increase in the risk of dying from lung (20),\npancreatic (21), head and neck, and renal (22) cancers, as well as\na twofold increase in risk of developing bladder cancer (23) and\nleukemia (24) and a threefold increase in risk of myeloma (24).\nMoreover, it is clear that former smokers live longer than con-\ntinuing smokers and that the benefits of quitting extend into the\nlater age groups. In comparison with continuing smokers, people\nwho quit smoking before age 50 years show a 50% reduction in\nrisk for all causes of death in the subsequent 16 years, and, by\nage 64 years, their risk of mortality is similar to that of never\nsmokers of the same age (9). As shown in Table 1, factors such\nas health status at the time of quitting, duration of abstinence,\nand previous level of tobacco exposure determine the magnitude\nof risk reduction achieved. For example, relative to nonsmokers,\nthe mortality ratio for males with no concurrent illness who\nsmoked more than 21 cigarettes per day averaged 2.73 for cur-\nabstinence. In the case of cancer mortality, the change in rates\nmay also vary by site. For example, a 30%\u00ad50% reduction in\nlung cancer mortality risk has been noted for both sexes and for\nall histologic types after 10 years of nonsmoking; whereas, for\ncancer of the bladder or kidney, the risk to former smokers may\nbe reduced by 50% within a few years following smoking ces-\nsation. A 50% reduction in risk for cancer of the oral cavity and\nesophagus has been observed as soon as 5 years after cessation\nImplications for Disease and Prevention\nTobacco Use and Carcinogens (25)\nNicotine dependence provides the link through which smok-\ners are repeatedly exposed to carcinogenic and genotoxic ele-\nments associated with tobacco consumption. In the case of lung\ncancer, smokers are exposed in dose-dependent fashion to the\nmajor carcinogens underlying the disease, as shown in Table 2.\nThese carcinogenic compounds are the polynuclear aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs), typified by the classical carcinogen ben-\nzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and the nicotine-derived tobacco-specific ni-\ntrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone\n(NNK). PAH and NNK are powerful pulmonary carcinogens in\nrodents, inducing tumors at total doses similar to those encoun-\ntered in a lifetime of smoking (26,27). The metabolic activation\nand detoxification pathways for PAH and NNK are well under-\nstood and are the same in rodents and humans, although there are\nquantitative differences (28,29). The DNA adducts that are\nformed from PAH and NNK have been well characterized, and\ntheir role as major factors in the carcinogenic process has been\nestablished (30,31). These same DNA adducts are found in the\nlungs of smokers (30,31), and the role of specific adducts in\ncausing permanent mutations has been elucidated (32). The\nbulky adducts resulting from the metabolic activation of BaP\nand NNK cause G to T mutations, while the methyl adducts\nformed from NNK produce G to A mutations. These mutations\nhave been detected in K-ras oncogenes and p53 tumor sup-\npressor genes isolated from lung tumors in smokers, and a dose-\nresponse relationship has been noted between G to T mutations\ndependence on nicotine is a prerequisite to the multistage pro-\ncess of lung carcinogenesis, in which these mutations play a\ncritical role (35). Moreover, in addition to their role in lung\ncancer, the nitrosamines are also considered major causative\nfactors for cancers of the esophagus and pancreas. Both PAH\nand nitrosamines have been causally related to oral cancer, and\naromatic amines have been associated with bladder cancer in\nVirtually all known carcinogens in tobacco products require\nmetabolic activation for binding to DNA. There are competing\ndetoxification reactions. The balance between metabolic activa-\ntion and detoxification in an individual will, in part, determine\nthat person's risk for cancer upon carcinogen exposure. This\nbalance is in large measure determined by individual levels and\nactivities of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, such as cyto-\nchromes P450, glutathione S-transferases, N-acetyltransferases,\nand uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (37).\nAssessment of specific carcinogen metabolites in urine or\nTable 1.

For\nexample, the higher risk of lung cancer in African-American\nsmokers than in Caucasian smokers may be related to poorer\ndetoxification of NNK (38). Another example is found in\nthe higher levels of 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts in\nsmokers with a higher risk of bladder cancer. Adduct levels are\ncontrolled in part by dose and by one's ability to activate the\ncarcinogen via cytochrome P450 1A2 or to detoxify it by N-\nSmokeless Tobacco (40)\nSmokeless tobacco users are also exposed to high concentra-\ntions of nicotine carcinogenic nitrosamines. The three leading\nbrands of moist snuff in the United States, Copenhagen, Skoal,\nand Kodiak, contain substantial amounts of nicotine (i.e., 10.9\u00ad\nthe unprotonated form because of the relatively high pH (3).\nUnprotonated nicotine is rapidly absorbed through the oral mu-\ncosa (41). By contrast, products with a lower market share, such\nas Hawken and Skoal, have significantly lower amounts of avail-\nable nicotine (3).\nCarcinogenic nitrosamines are formed from nicotine and\nother tobacco alkaloids during the manufacturing of moist snuff\nproducts (3). The two most carcinogenic nitrosamines in tobacco\nproducts are N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and NNK. They are\npresent in average amounts of 7.7 and 1.2 g/g tobacco, respec-\ntively, and their structures are shown in Fig. 2.\nThe levels of NNN and NNK are far higher than those of\ncarcinogens in any other consumer product (42). Moreover, con-\ncentrations of NNN and NNK in U.S. moist snuff products have\nnot substantially changed over the past 20 years (43). A bioassay\nof these two compounds applied to the oral cavity of the rat\ndemonstrated a substantial and statistically significant incidence\nof oral tumors (44). A recent study (45) has also demonstrated an\nassociation between NNK metabolites in the urine of snuff-\ndippers and the presence of oral leukoplakia.\nTobacco Use and Chemoprevention (25)\nCessation of all tobacco use is clearly the best way to prevent\ntobacco-related cancers, but recent studies suggest that chemo-\nprevention may be a way to partially counteract carcinogen ex-\nposure associated with continued use of tobacco. This approach\nmay be particularly important for the heavily nicotine-dependent\nsmoker, whose successful long-term abstinence may require\nmultiple cessation attempts and/or intensive treatment efforts\nbefore it can be achieved. For example, a near lifetime admin-\nistration of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which occurs\nnaturally as a conjugate in watercress and other cruciferous veg-\netables, has been shown to inhibit lung cancer induction in rats\ntreated with NNK (46,47). PEITC selectively inhibits the meta-\nbolic activation of NNK in the rat lung (48,49) and in humans\nexposed to PEITC through watercress consumption (50). A large\nnumber of naturally occurring compounds are available that are\nable to inhibit lung tumor development caused by NNK or BaP\n(46) that could be employed for the chemoprevention of lung\ncancer in smokers. Some compounds, such as myo-inositol, can\nalso inhibit lung cancer in animals when administered after car-\ncinogen exposure and could potentially be useful for the che-\nmoprevention of lung cancer in ex-smokers (51). However, the\ninverse relationship recently observed between lung cancer in-\ncidence and -carotene supplementation among smokers (52,53)\nindicates that caution should be exercised in this high-risk group.\nThe potential application of chemoprevention strategies has\nbeen discussed elsewhere (54), and, although chemopreventive\nagents hold promise, more research is needed to determine\nwhether they are effective at reducing the cancer risk of smok-\ners.\nTobacco Use and Molecular Epidemiologic Approaches to\nRisk Identification (55)\nThe risk assessment process is often multidisciplinary and\ncomplex because of interindividual variation in susceptibility to\ncancer. Understanding this process can allow us to identify\nsmokers with the highest risks of developing cancer, perhaps\ntargeting them for intensive smoking cessation interventions,\nchemoprevention trials, or tailored educational messages. Mo-\nlecular epidemiology provides a means for studying the mul-\ntistep processes that occur between exposure and cancer, and\nresults from these investigations highlight the role of genetic\nsusceptibility in carcinogenesis.\nCigarette smoking is the major determinant of lung cancer;\nyet, fewer than 20% of lifetime cigarette smokers will develop\nlung cancer. The risk of lung cancer depends on the dose of\ntobacco, the duration of smoking, the types of tobacco, the type\nof cigarette, and host susceptibility. Sometimes, gene\u00ad\nenvironment interactions are suggested even by natural sub-\ngroups within the population. For example, it has been reported\n(56) that the odds ratios for major lung cancer types were con-\nsistently higher for women than for men at every level of expo-\nsure to cigarette smoke. Furthermore, this sex difference could\nnot be explained by differences in baseline exposure, smoking\nhistory, or body size, suggesting that it was the result of higher\nsusceptibility to tobacco carcinogens among women. Genetic\nfactors may influence carcinogen absorption, distribution, or ac-\ncumulation in target tissue and thereby modulate the internal\nlevels of exposure [e.g., genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes\nresponsible for activation {cytochrome P450s} and detoxifica-\ntion {glutathione S-transferase enzymes (57)} of tobacco car-\ncinogens].\nAnother determinant of susceptibility to carcinogens may be\nmutagen sensitivity, which can be measured in an in vitro assay\nof mutagen-induced chromatid breaks in cultured lymphocytes.\nIndividuals with large numbers of breaks are considered to be at\nhigher risk of developing cancer because of a decreased ability\nto repair induced damage. Case-control studies (58\u00ad61) have\nindicated that bleomycin-induced mutagen sensitivity is an in-\nFig. 2.

A\nmeta-analysis of three case-control studies of heavy smokers\n 5.0\u00ad26.6) for cancers of the head and neck in the absence of\nthe hypersensitive phenotype. However, among heavy smokers\nwho exhibited mutagen hypersensitivity, the odds ratio was 44.6\nlung cancer susceptibility. It is informative to compare never\nsmokers and former smokers stratified on the basis of mutagen\nsensitivity. Compared with those who never smoked and who\nwere not mutagen sensitive (the reference group), those who\nnever smoked but were mutagen sensitive had a twofold el-\nevated risk. Former smokers who were not mutagen sensitive\nwere still at increased risk (about threefold). Thus, exposure to\nsufficient levels of tobacco smoke can overwhelm whatever\nnonsusceptible genotype or phenotype one has. Finally, for those\nwho were mutagen sensitive and who smoked, the risk was\nmuch higher, indicating an interaction between mutagen sensi-\ntivity and smoking.\nAnother example is a restriction fragment length polymor-\nphism in codon 72 of the p53 gene, which has been implicated\nin lung cancer risk. Patients with the susceptible genotype (cod-\ning for Proline/Proline) appeared to have an earlier age at diag-\nnosis and lower mean cigarette pack-years1 of exposure than did\npatients with the Arginine/Arginine- or the Arginine/Proline-\ncoding genotypes (63). These and other results suggest that in-\ndividuals with a susceptible genotype tend to develop cancer at\nearlier ages and with less cigarette exposure. It is interesting that\nthere are considerable ethnic differences in the prevalence of the\nsusceptible genotype, with estimates of 26% for whites, 20% for\nAfrican-Americans, 10% for Japanese, and only 2.5% for Mexi-\ncan-Americans; this observation may partly explain the latter\ngroup's lower rates of lung cancer.\nIt is likely that there are numerous genotypic factors that\ntogether explain differences in risk. The metabolism of the many\ncarcinogens in cigarette smoke is complex. Thus, multiple sus-\nceptibility factors must be accounted for to represent the true\ndimensions of gene\u00adenvironment interactions and to construct\nthe most appropriate quantitative risk-assessment models.\nPsychobiological Aspects of Nicotine Dependence\nAlthough the initiation of tobacco use may be dependent on\nsocial factors (e.g., peer use, parental approval, and poor school\nperformance) and the marketing efforts of tobacco companies,\nbiologic factors play a fundamental role in the development of\nnicotine dependence and pose significant barriers to achieving\ntobacco abstinence (64,65). Among those trying even a single\nAmong regular tobacco users, the incidence of dependence is\nfact, the risk of developing dependence to tobacco is higher than\nthat observed following initial use of cocaine or alcohol\n(67,68,70). The effects of nicotine involve subtle, diverse, and\nbehaviorally relevant psychoactive properties, the development\nof pharmacologic tolerance, and a reduction in symptoms of\nwithdrawal following nicotine administration. Understanding\nthese factors may provide insight into the mechanisms respon-\nsible for the development of nicotine dependence and improve\nour approach to treatment.\nChemistry of Nicotine (71)\nNicotine is a water- and lipid-soluble base with a pKa of 8.0\n(64,72). Thus, nicotine delivered in alkaline cigar and pipe\nsmoke and smokeless tobacco is readily absorbed across muco-\nsal membranes of the mouth and nose (64,72). Cigarette smoke\nis acidic and, for effective absorption, must be inhaled in the\npulmonary alveoli, where absorption is rapid (72\u00ad74).\nCigarettes contain 6\u00ad11 mg of nicotine, of which the smoker\ncan absorb 1\u00ad3 mg irrespective of tobacco company provided\nnicotine-yield ratings and which is sufficient to establish and\nsustain nicotine dependence (72,75). A typical pack per day\ncigarette smoker absorbs 20\u00ad40 mg of nicotine each day, achiev-\ning concentrations of 25\u00ad35 ng/mL of plasma by the afternoon\n(72). The plasma half-life of nicotine is approximately 2 hours,\nand the half-life of its primary metabolite, cotinine, is approxi-\nPsychophysiological Responses to Nicotine\nNicotine is rapidly distributed from the bloodstream, binding\nto various tissues and activating nicotinic cholinergic receptors\nor binding sites. Activation of these receptors leads to alteration\nof spontaneous electroencephalogram and evoked brain electri-\ncal potentials, alteration of local cerebral glucose metabolism,\nmodulation of adrenal and pituitary hormones, an increased\nheart rate, and changes in skeletal muscle tension (72). The\neffects may also produce pleasure and satisfaction in humans\nand are sufficiently rewarding to lead animals as well as humans\nto press levers that lead to repeated injections of nicotine\n(64,72,77). In addition, evidence also suggests that nicotine may\nenhance vigilance, memory, and task performance, independent\nNicotine's diverse, yet subtle, psychoactive actions may be\nrelated to its simultaneous actions on many types of neurons and\nits effects on the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and se-\nrotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). These neurotransmitter\nsystems may be modulated by nicotine's direct or indirect ef-\nfects on receptors or through its other cholinergically mediated\nactions (72). Nicotine's effect on dopamine release (nucleus ac-\ncumbens) and synthesis in the mesolimbic system may be im-\nportant to the motivational and reinforcing properties of the drug\n(82,83). Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been\nassociated with self-administration of nicotine, opiates, and co-\ncaine; brain electrical stimulation; anticipation of eating and\nsexual behavior; the effects of rewards or incentives (83); and\navoidance of aversive stimuli (81). Nicotine may also increase\nturnover of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus and release in\nthe locus coeruleus. This type of noradrenergic stimulation has\nbeen related to enhanced attention to significant stimuli and\nreduction in the salience of irrelevant stimuli (81). Moreover,\nnicotine may stimulate 5-HT release in the median raphe nuclei,\nwhere high-affinity nicotine binding sites exist, as well as sero-\ntonergic neurons in the hypothalamus and striatum (83). Such\nactions could have implications for understanding the relation-\nship between smoking and depressed mood, given the favorable\nclinical response of patients with major depression treated with\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitors (84).\nRecent studies (85) also suggest that an up-regulation (i.e.,\nincreased expression) of nicotine receptors may result with\nchronic use, but many of these receptors are desensitized or\ninactive. Tolerance may develop as capacity to recruit new re-\nceptors to compensate for desensitization is outstripped by their\nrate of inactivation (86). In contrast, down-regulation (i.e., de-\ncreased expression) may take place when chronic use is termi-\nnated. This process has been referred to as metabolic tolerance,\nand its regulation may have a substantial genetic component\nMost, if not all, effects of nicotine on the central nervous\nsystem are dose dependent, and tolerance has been observed to\ndiffering degrees across many effects (64,72). Nicotine tolerance\nappears to be acquired substantially during youth as individuals\nprogress from smoking a few cigarettes on initial exposure to\nhigher levels of consumption (87,88). After a period of nicotine\nexposure assumed to be at least ``several weeks'' (89), physical\ndependence on nicotine may ensue. It has been suggested (86)\nthat repeated exposure to nicotine produces tolerance in sensi-\ntive individuals, which in turn reduces the net effect of the drug.\nThis leads to a compensatory increase in consumption to obtain\nthe desired effect (i.e., dependent smoking). Less sensitive per-\nsons may acquire little or no tolerance to nicotine, remaining\nnonsmokers after initial experimentation or becoming ``chip-\npers,'' or intermittent users of tobacco (86). Chippers show little\nevidence of nicotine withdrawal or impaired cognitive perfor-\nmance when deprived of nicotine (78). In contrast, the depen-\ndent person appears to function normally only when under the\ninfluence of nicotine. Nicotine dependent persons also report\nfeeling ``abnormal'' or ``not right'' when deprived for more\nthan a few hours (89,90). Although nicotine administration can\ncause intoxication and behavioral disruption in the nicotine na-\nive person over time, optimal performance for most smokers on\nbehavioral and cognitive tasks requires sustained nicotine ad-\nministration, with adverse performance effects accompanying\nnicotine deprivation.\nThe nicotine withdrawal syndrome has been described in de-\ntail and includes symptoms of increased anxiety, irritability, and\nappetite and decreased cognitive capabilities and heart rate\nbegins within a few hours of the last cigarette and includes an\nincreased tendency to smoke, impaired cognitive function, and\naltered electrocortical function (91,92,95). Withdrawal symp-\ntoms peak within a few days and then begin to recede over the\nnext several weeks. However, most individuals who try to quit\nsmoking relapse before the syndrome subsides (64,95). Even the\ncontinuing smoker experiences withdrawal symptoms during\neach day of smoking, which presumably minimizes the duration\nof abstinence that can be tolerated (65).\nNicotine replacement does not appear to shorten the course of\nthe syndrome, but it can reduce severity of the symptoms to the\nmore tolerable levels typically observed after about 4\u00ad5 weeks\nof untreated abstinence. Some withdrawal symptoms, particu-\nlarly cognitive impairment, cravings, and irritability, may persist\nfor months or more in some individuals (72,95).\nSmoking and Negative Mood States (96)\nThere is considerable evidence (97) to suggest that smoking\nbehavior is influenced by an individual's vulnerability to expe-\nrience depressed or dysphoric mood. For example, depressive\nmood and a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) are\nmore prevalent among smokers than among nonsmokers (odds\nlinked to nicotine dependent than nondependent smoking\npredictive of greater withdrawal severity and withdrawal in-\nMoreover, most of the time (60%) this disturbance in mood\nprecedes the development of tobacco dependence (104).\nThe relationship between smoking and negative affect is also\nsimilar for nonclinical disturbances of mood. For example, as\nshown in Fig. 3, data from the Health Promotion Disease Pre-\nvention supplement to the 1991 National Health Interview Sur-\nsmoker increase with rising levels of daily negative mood (e.g.,\ndepression, loneliness, boredom, etc.). Although the effects are\nsignificant for both sexes at the higher levels of negative mood,\nthey are apparent sooner for women than for men. The presence\nof nonclinical levels of negative affect may also characterize as\ntensive prospective study of relapse (109) showed that 19% of\nlapses were reported under conditions of extreme negative af-\nfect, with 62% of these episodes occurring during interpersonal\nconflict (arguing). Studies also show that smokers who believe\nthat smoking is an effective affect management strategy are less\nlikely to quit (110) and that postcessation depression and nega-\ntive affect are the symptoms of withdrawal that best predict\nImplications for Treatment\nSelf-Quitting in the General Population (96)\nIt is estimated that about 48.5% of the population of ``ever''\nsmokers (90 million people) have already stopped smoking. Un-\nfortunately, the decline in smoking prevalence appears to have\nplateaued in the last 3\u00ad4 years (114). Smoking cessation con-\ntinues to be a difficult proposition for most people. In the 1994\nNational Health Interview Supplement (NHIS-2000), it was es-\ntimated that, of the 48 million adult smokers, 69.3% want to stop\nFig. 3.

Approximately 46.4% of current everyday\nsmokers made a serious cessation attempt (stopped for at least 1\nday) in the 12 months prior to the survey (11), although only\n13.8% of this group, and 5.7% of all the smokers, successfully\nabstained from tobacco use for at least 1 month (NHIS-Health\nPromotion and Disease Prevention Supplement) (5). It was es-\ntimated that only 2.5% of all smokers quit smoking permanently\neach year (5).\nIt is interesting that the majority of former smokers (85%)\nreport a preference for quitting on their own, using mostly ``cold\nturkey'' (85%) or gradual reduction (13%) approaches to ces-\nsation (115). Only 15% of the former smokers report using as-\nsisted or more intensive cessation treatments (e.g., physician's\nadvice, counseling, nicotine replacement, etc.). These findings\nare consistent with the suggestion that smokers are reluctant to\ntake advantage of assisted forms of treatment when it is offered\n(116,117). However, the high preference of self-quitting among\nformer smokers should not be interpreted as an endorsement for\nthe effectiveness of a single unassisted cessation attempt. Such\nstatistics most likely reflect the cumulative effect of multiple\ncessation attempts carried out over a period of several years\n(118), as well as the substantial economic and social barriers that\nreduce access to assisted forms of treatment. Indeed, in a pro-\nspective evaluation of more than 5000 would-be self-quitters,\nonly 4.3% reported continuous abstinence 1 year after their ces-\nSmoking Cessation Medications (119)\nThe understanding that tobacco addiction had a physiologic\nbasis brought with it the implication that medications could be\nused to help people achieve and sustain abstinence. Two medical\ndisorders are now widely recognized to comprise what is more\ngenerally termed tobacco addiction or dependence (89): 1) nico-\ntine dependence and 2) nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine depen-\ndence is the disorder of maladaptive and seldom spontaneously\nremitting tobacco use. Diagnostic criteria for nicotine depen-\ndence include evidence of tolerance (increased use over time and\nabsence of aversive symptoms), withdrawal (see below), and\npersistent desire or unsuccessful effort to reduce intake. Nicotine\nwithdrawal is the constellation of symptoms that accompany\ntobacco abstinence. These symptoms can include dysphoria, in-\nsomnia, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, increased appetite, and\ndifficulty concentrating.\nNicotine replacement. Nicotine polacrilex (``gum'') has\nbeen available as a prescription medication since 1985 in the\nUnited States and was approved for over-the-counter (OTC)\nmarketing in early 1996. Nicotine transdermal systems\n(``patches'') have been available by prescription since late 1991,\nand two of the four systems were approved for OTC marketing\nin 1996. A nicotine nasal spray was approved and marketed as a\nprescription medication in mid-1996. In addition, in the spring\nof 1997, the FDA approved the nicotine vapor inhaler. All of\nthese medications are indicated as aids to smoking cessation, and\nthey reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, such as difficulty\nconcentrating, irritability, and cravings. However, all vary some-\nwhat in their instructions for use, side effects, dosage configu-\nration, and the nature and extent of behavioral support programs\ncal studies in the area have concentrated almost exclusively\non evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the nicotine patch and\ngum, and results from these studies are briefly summarized be-\nlow. Further discussion is also provided in the AHCPR (i.e.,\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research) Clinical Practice\nGuideline on Smoking Cessation section (see below) and in other\nTransdermal nicotine has been shown to be an effective form\nof treatment that significantly improves cessation rates across\ndiverse settings and populations. Use of transdermal nicotine\napproximately doubles 6- to 12-month cessation rates in relation\nto the rate obtained with a comparable placebo. This result holds\ntrue, even when the patch is provided alone or paired with a\nlow-intensity behavioral intervention. Recent meta-analyses\n(124) suggest that absolute cessation rates observed with the\nactive patch may also be enhanced when it is used in conjunction\nwith more- versus less-intense psychologic interventions, al-\nthough the effect has not been uniform (125). Mean cessation\nrates reported in the meta-analyses for the active patch plus high-\nversus low-intensity psychologic interventions were 41.5%\nThe gum appears to improve 12-month cessation rates by\n40%\u00ad60% compared with control interventions. The effect sizes\nfor gum versus placebo or no gum conditions were higher when\nadministered with more- versus less-intensive psychologic\ntherapy. One analysis (126) showed no difference in 1-year ab-\nstinence rates for gum versus control conditions when each were\ncombined with a brief behavioral intervention. Thus, unlike the\npatch, the gum may be less effective when only minimal forms\nof psychologic intervention are used; however, similar to what\nhas been observed for the patch, cessation rates are likely to\nimprove with increasing intensity of adjuvant therapy.\nIn 1994, a 4-mg dosage form of nicotine gum was approved\nfor marketing on the basis of findings that it was effective for\nheavier smokers, for whom the 2-mg formulation was generally\nineffective (127). Nicotine polacrilex is also the only smoking\ncessation medication shown to reduce reliably the weight gain\nassociated with cessation, but the effect may not persist after\npolacrilex use is discontinued (65). Noncompliance with chew-\ning frequency and use duration may reduce the gum's effective-\nness, although compliance improves with concurrent psycho-\nlogic therapy (123). Moreover, the nicotine patch may be\npreferred to the gum, given its ease of use and constant nicotine\ndosing.\nNegative mood, nicotine replacement, and psychotropic\nmedication (96). As discussed above, negative mood states have\na significant impact on smoking prevalence and cessation re-\nlapse. Amelioration of these conditions in the context of a smok-\ning cessation intervention appears to be an important step in the\ntreatment process. Some behavioral studies (128,129) indicate\nthat smokers with high levels of precessation negative mood\nmay benefit from cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses\ndirectly on managing the symptoms of negative affect. For those\nwith a history of major depression, the results of behavioral\nintervention alone appear less conclusive. One study (130)\nshowed a significant benefit for a cognitive-behavioral affect\nmanagement treatment program, while another from the same\nStudies using both the nicotine patch and the gum also show\nthat treatment efficacy is reduced among smokers who report\nduring (111,134) the early phases of treatment. Although cessa-\ntion rates can be improved to the extent that either approach\noffsets the increase in negative mood associated with quitting\nment affect and, possibly, by sex. For example, the addition of\nnicotine gum to an extensive program of behavioral counseling\ndoes not appear to enhance the abstinence of smokers with a past\nhistory of MDD (131), although modest treatment gains have\nbeen reported for the combination of gum and brief counseling\namong those with current depressive symptoms. Combining\ntransdermal nicotine replacement with group counseling also\nenhances abstinence beyond that achieved by counseling alone\n(96,135). Women appear to do equally well with or without the\npatch added to the group behavioral intervention for 2\u00ad3 months\nafter all treatment ends. However, no effects on the basis of sex\nare observed at the 6-month follow-up (Cinciripini PM, Wetter\nDW, Cinciripini LG, Haque W, Van Vunakis H: manuscript\nsubmitted for publication). Nevertheless, this finding is interest-\ning in view of studies that suggest that women may smoke more\noften than men for reasons of non-nicotine reinforcement (136)\nand have relapsed more in clinical trials of nicotine-replacement\ntherapy (136) (Wetter DW, Kenford SS, Smith JJ, Fiore MC,\nJorenby DE, Baker TB: manuscript in preparation).\nThe use of psychotropic medication as a prophylactic treat-\nment for negative affect has also produced favorable effects on\ncessation rates in some studies. For example, in a preliminary\nreport (137), abstinence was improved among smokers who re-\nported at least one symptom of depressive mood and who took\nthe antidepressant fluoxetine (an SSRI or selective serotonin\nre-uptake inhibitor). Early results with another antidepressant,\nnortriptyline, showed favorable effects on cessation for smokers\nboth with and without a positive history of MDD (131). Im-\nproved levels of abstinence have also been observed among\nsmokers with initially elevated levels of anxiety who were\ntreated with the anxiolytic, buspirone, in conjunction with be-\nhavioral counseling. The drug seemed to attenuate the expected\nprecessation rise in anxiety, although the beneficial effects on\nabstinence lasted only for the duration of chemotherapy (138). A\nsubsequent study (139), using considerably less provider sup-\nport, found no differences with buspirone. Finally, the FDA\nrecently approved the antidepressant, buproprion (Zyban, a do-\npamine reuptake inhibitor, Glaxo Wellcome), for use in smoking\ncessation treatment. The results of a multicenter clinical trial\nday of Zyban averaged 23% versus 19% in the placebo group\nExperimental medications for smoking cessation (119). A\nvariety of non-nicotine medications have also been studied and\nare briefly summarized below. These medications include the\nfollowing: clonidine, lobeline, and mecamylamine. Clonidine,\nan antihypertensive, appears to be useful for some individuals,\nbut study findings are mixed. Lobeline, which partially mimics\nthe effects of nicotine, was used in many OTC smoking-\ncessation products until 1994 when the FDA removed such\nproducts from the market until they are shown to be effective.\nMecamylamine, an antihypertensive that has been used in re-\nsearch for its nicotine blocking effects (141), enhanced cessation\nefforts in a preliminary study when it was co-administered with\na nicotine patch (141). This drug combination will require con-\nsiderable additional research to determine whether or not it is\ngenerally safe and effective, as well as to determine appropriate\ndosing parameters. Cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, has been\nevaluated in a preliminary study (143), but it is unclear whether\nit will prove to be efficacious for smoking cessation. More de-\nOptimal use of approved and investigational medications\nwould be expected to vary across patients: some may require\nhigher doses, longer-term use, combinations of dosage forms,\nand possibly new dosage forms. Similarly, for people unable or\nunwilling to completely abstain from tobacco, experimental use\nof nicotine medications to treat withdrawal symptoms and to\nreduce their exposure to tobacco might be considered. A par-\nticularly promising application of available medications would\nbe the combination of gum and patch, which appears to provide\nincreased relief of withdrawal symptoms and achievement of\ncessation (65). Another type of combination therapy could be\ntermed ``sequential,'' whereby patients use a transdermal medi-\ncation to achieve abstinence and then intermittently use nicotine\npolacrilex as needed to sustain long-term abstinence (65).\nTobacco-derived nicotine-delivery products (119). To-\nbacco companies have patented a wide range of nicotine-\ndelivering products that are most accurately considered drugs\nand/or drug delivery devices, regardless of how they have been\nor will be formally regulated (68,145). The most distinct among\nsuch tobacco company products that have actually been mar-\nketed include the Premier and the Eclipse devices of the R. J.\nReynolds Tobacco Company (Winston-Salem, NC) and the\nMasterpiece Tobaccos chewing gum of the Pinkerton Tobacco\nof these products would be lower in their delivery of some types\nof tobacco toxins. For example, Premier, and probably Eclipse,\nappeared lower in conventional tar but similar in nicotine and\ncarbon monoxide delivery to a conventional cigarette and pos-\nsibly higher in chemical derivatives of pyrolized glycerol.\nWhether or not various tobacco-caused diseases might be re-\nduced by substitution of such products for conventional tobacco\nproducts is not known. Furthermore, the form and purpose of\nthese products appears aimed at maintaining, if not increasing,\nthe prevalence of nicotine dependence, whereas pharmaceutical\nproducts have been designed and marketed as means to reduce\ntobacco-caused disease, including nicotine dependence.\nTreatment Recommendations: the AHCPR Clinical\nPractice Guideline on Smoking Cessation (147)\nIn April 1996, the AHCPR released a set of guidelines for\npracticing clinicians, smoking cessation specialists, and health\ncare administrators/insurers to deliver and support effective\nsmoking cessation interventions (123). The guideline panel\nevaluated more than 300 randomized controlled studies in a\nmeta-analysis of several treatment components. The major rec-\nommendations of the panel can be summarized as follows:\n1) Effective smoking cessation treatments are avail-\nable, and every patient who smokes should be of-\nfered one or more of these treatments.\n2) It is essential that clinicians determine and docu-\nment the tobacco-use status of every patient\ntreated in a health-care setting.\n3) Brief cessation treatments are effective, and at\nleast a minimal intervention should be provided to\nevery patient who uses tobacco.\n4) A dose\u00adresponse relationship exists between the\nintensity and the duration of treatment and its ef-\nfectiveness. In general, the more intense the inter-\nvention, the more effective it is in producing long-\nterm abstinence from tobacco.\n5) Three treatment elements, in particular, are effec-\ntive, and one or more of these elements should be\nincluded in smoking-cessation treatment:\n(a) nicotine-replacement therapy (nicotine patches\nor gum);\n(b) social support (clinician provided encourage-\nment and assistance); and\n(c) skills training/problem solving (techniques on\nachieving and maintaining abstinence);\n6) Effective reduction of tobacco use requires that\nhealth care systems make institutional changes that\nresult in systematic identification of, and interven-\ntion with, all tobacco users at every visit.\nCessation screening advice and providers. The AHCPR\npanel recommended that providers in primary care settings,\nwhich would include cancer screening and detection clinics,\nimplement a systematic assessment to identify all smokers. Ex-\npanding the ``vital signs'' to include documentation of smoking\nstatus for every patient at every visit has been suggested for this\npurpose. The 4-A's model of smoking cessation (Ask, Advise,\nAssist, and Arrange) was recommended as a strategy to be used\nby primary care clinicians (148). The model includes strong\npersonalized messages to encourage/motivate a quit attempt and\nadvice/information on preparing to quit and coping with with-\ndrawal, making a commitment to abstinence, and arranging so-\ncial support and follow-up. Referrals to other specialty providers\nare encouraged if desired by the smoker. The largest increment\nin success was observed after smokers were exposed to provid-\ners from multiple disciplines (e.g., medicine, psychology, and\nnursing).\nIntervention format: self-help or individual and group\ninterventions. The guideline panel noted that cessation rates\nattributed to different self-help modalities (e.g., books, manuals,\naudiotapes, community referral lists, pamphlets, etc.) did not\ndiffer appreciably from each other and that these rates were not\nsubstantially different from the rate obtained with control sub-\njects who received no self-help material. A slight increase in\ncessation rates was noted in three studies that provided tele-\nphone hotline support for smoker-initiated calls (odds ratio \n2.9). The panel recommended that telephone call-in-support be\nconsidered, if feasible, when establishing a self-help interven-\ntion program.\nIn contrast, interventions that offer person-to-person contact\n(i.e., group or individual counseling) provide a substantial treat-\nment advantage over self-help material alone. In comparison\nwith self-help interventions, the more time providers spend (in-\ntensity level) with smokers in a treatment session, the higher the\nlikelihood of cessation. The highest cessation rates were ob-\nserved for provider counseling sessions lasting longer than 10\nminutes, but brief contact lasting 3\u00ad10 minutes, and even mini-\nmal contact lasting less than 3 minutes, progressively improved\na smoker's chance of successfully quitting over that of control\nsubjects. In addition, both the duration of treatment and the\nnumber of treatment sessions (length of session) improved the\nodds of cessation, even after controlling for treatment intensity.\nSignificant improvements in cessation were observed for inter-\nventions involving four to seven sessions carried out over an\n8-week period or more.\nTreatment content. The panel also analyzed the efficacy of\nseveral components of treatment, including aversive (rapid)\nsmoking; setting a quit day; counseling for diet, motivation, or\nexercise; contingency contracting; relaxation; cigarette (brand)\nfading; social support; and problem solving/skills training. The\nresults indicated that only cessation counseling, involving either\ngeneral problem solving/skills training (relapse prevention,\nstress management, etc.) or supportive care provided by the\nclinician within the treatment session, significantly raised ces-\nsation rates above the rate obtained for no-contact control sub-\njects.\nThe problem solving/skills approach to treatment involves\nsuch counseling elements as the recognition of high-risk situa-\ntions (e.g., being around other smokers and alcohol consump-\ntion), the enhancement of coping skills designed to alter or ame-\nliorate relapse risk (e.g., use of distraction and avoidance and\nplanning for unanticipated events), the countering of negative\nmood with stress reduction and reinforcement enhancement\nstrategies, and the provision of basic information about smoking\nand successful quitting (e.g., nature and course of withdrawal,\nthe addictive aspects of smoking, etc.). The social support com-\nponent refers to provider encouragement to quit (e.g., commu-\nnicating confidence in the patient's ability to quit, providing\nbasic information about withdrawal, and providing opportunities\nto discuss cessation difficulties).\nNicotine-replacement therapy. The AHCPR panel also re-\nviewed the results of five meta-analyses on the efficacy of the\ntransdermal nicotine patch and three analyses focusing on nico-\ntine gum. It was concluded that all smokers should be encour-\naged to use the nicotine patch or gum for smoking cessation,\nexcept in the presence of special circumstances (i.e., the need for\nabstinence from all sources of nicotine). Research in this area is\nsummarized above in the ``Smoking Cessation Medications''\nsection.\nIn conclusion, the AHCPR guidelines provide substantial evi-\ndence that dividends in cessation success may be expected with\ninterventions that use nicotine replacement and with interven-\ntions that last relatively longer, involve more clinical contact,\nand provide increasing levels of problem solving/skills training\nand social support. It is recommended that counseling focus on\nproblem solving skills and social support and last as many weeks\nas feasible given available resources (i.e., the longer the better).\nIndividually Tailored Self-Help Interventions (149)\nAlthough cessation rates associated with minimal or self-help\ninterventions may be substantially lower than those obtained\nwith more extensive clinical treatments, self-help programs have\nthe potential of reaching large segments of the population at\nrelatively low cost. It can be argued that a small treatment effect\nmultiplied across the population can have a substantial public\nhealth impact. Moreover, recent developments in the design and\nimplementation of new self-help materials (e.g., computer tai-\nloring) allow more individual specificity in the treatment mes-\nsage than was previously possible using ubiquitous or ``one size\nfits all'' treatment materials. Personalizing or tailoring interven-\ntion materials might enhance the effectiveness of self-help ap-\nproaches by focusing treatment advice on issues most relevant to\nthe individual.\nTailored or personalized interventions incorporate informa-\ntion provided by the subject on certain aspects of their smoking\nbehavior (i.e., motivation and readiness to quit, barriers to ces-\nsation, self-confidence, individual temptations, etc.) into specific\nwritten or counselor-delivered suggestions for behavior change.\nalone or in conjunction with telephone counseling, personalized\nor individually tailored feedback increases cessation rates, al-\nthough it may chiefly benefit smokers who are low in self-\nefficacy or those who are less nicotine dependent. It is important\nto note, however, that those who may have little intention to quit\nat the onset of treatment (pre-contemplators) also seem to derive\nan advantage from staged, matched, personalized feedback\nTailored self-help materials have also been combined with\nnicotine-replacement therapy, using nicotine polacrilex gum and\nthe transdermal nicotine medications. The combination of these\ntwo approaches presents a substantial research and public health\nopportunity given the preference of many smokers for minimal\nintervention and the documented effectiveness of nicotine re-\nplacement (see section on AHCPR recommendations). Both the\npatch and nicotine gum are now available as OTC medications,\nand some pharmaceutical companies (e.g., SmithKline Beecham\nand McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) provide self-\nhelp materials to product consumers. Given the widespread dis-\ntribution of OTC medications, plus consumer advertising to spur\ninterest in use of the product, the combination of nicotine-\nreplacement therapy and tailored self-help materials provided by\nthe manufacturers could become part of the routine care pro-\nvided for smoking cessation. Outcome research using such ap-\nproaches is just beginning. For example, a study by Orleans et al.\n(154) used a series of tailored letters to supplement the use of\ntransdermal nicotine replacement in a population of elderly\nsmokers. Preliminary results from this randomized trial suggest\nthat the 3-month point prevalence abstinence rate among patch\nusers receiving the tailored program was 67% in comparison\nwith an abstinence rate of 32% among patch users receiving\nnontailored support. High levels of initial abstinence (44%) have\nalso been reported (149) among users of the nicotine patch and\nthe Committed Quitters Personal Support Program (CQ), the\nself-help program provided with the Nicoderm prescription\npatch (SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare). Participants\nin the CQ program were mailed sequential letters, calendars, and\npostcard reminders tailored to selected cessation benefits and\nbarriers that were identified in a baseline interview. They also\nreceived a follow-up telephone call within a day or two of their\nquit date and again 5 weeks later. While promising, the results of\nthis program, as well as of others associated with OTC nicotine-\nreplacement products, require further evaluation in randomized\nclinical trials.\nCommunity Intervention (COMMIT) (155)\nThe treatment approaches discussed thus far target the be-\nhavior of individual smokers and measure the success of the\nintervention in terms of the abstinence achieved by these smok-\ners at specific points in time. Community interventions, on the\nother hand, expose entire communities to a cessation or preven-\ntion treatment and measure treatment outcome in terms of dif-\nferences in smoking prevalence between exposed and unexposed\ncommunities. Recently, a combination of community-based in-\nterventions to help smokers quit was evaluated in COMMIT,\nwhich was funded by the NCI. COMMIT was a large-scale trial\ninvolving 11 matched pairs of communities in North America\n(156) randomly assigned to receive either an active community\nintervention or no active intervention (control).\nA baseline survey, using random-digit-dialing methods, was\nused to estimate the smoking prevalence in each community and\nto identify cohorts of heavy (25 cigarettes/day) and light-to-\nmoderate smokers (<25 cigarettes/day) to be followed. After the\nrandomization, the COMMIT intervention was implemented in\nthe intervention communities by use of several existing commu-\nnity channels: media and public education, health care providers,\nwork sites (and community organizations), and cessation re-\nsources (156,157). The assumption was that the combination of\napproaches would be more effective than the sum of its indi-\nvidual component effects. COMMIT would act as a ``catalyst''\nfor smoking cessation activities in the community.\nThe primary hypothesis of COMMIT was that the commu-\nnity-level, multi-channel, 4-year intervention would increase\nquit rates among cigarette smokers (with particular interest in\nheavy smokers). ``Quit rate'' was defined as the fraction of\ncohort members who had achieved and maintained cessation for\nat least 6 months at the end of the trial. End point cohorts\nsmokers, 25\u00ad64 years of age, were followed by telephone con-\ntact (157). The cohort analysis showed that the mean heavy\nsmoker quit rate was 18% for the intervention communities ver-\nsus 18.7% for the comparison communities, a nonsignificant\ndifference (P  .68). Significant group differences (P  .004)\nwere observed for corresponding light-to-moderate smoker quit\nrates, averaging 30.6% and 27.5% for the intervention and con-\ntrol communities, respectively. No significant sex differences in\nthe effect of the intervention were noted. However, among light-\nto-moderate smokers, the less-educated subgroup appeared to be\nmore responsive to the intervention than college-educated smok-\ners. Analysis of the cross-sectional survey data also showed a\nnonsignificant difference in the decline in smoking prevalence\nbetween the intervention and the comparison communities, with\ndeclines of 3.5% and 3.2% observed, respectively. There was an\nencouraging decrease in smoking prevalence for middle-aged\nand older adults, but the youngest group, ages 18\u00ad24 years,\nThe impact of this community-based intervention on light-\nto-moderate smokers, although modest, has public health impor-\ntance. That this community-based intervention did not affect\nheavy smokers or have a substantial impact on smoking preva-\nlence beyond favorable secular trends, while disappointing,\npoints to the need for the prevention of nicotine dependence and\nfor more extensive treatment of highly nicotine-dependent\nsmokers. Such treatment approaches may go beyond traditional\neducational and minimal levels of intervention and incorporate\nthe type of provider support, skills-training techniques, and nico-\ntine-replacement therapies recommended in the AHCPR guide-\nline (123) and may include alternative pharmacologic interven-\ntion as well.\nImplications for Public Policy\nRegulatory Aspects of Prevention: Role of the FDA\n(Remarks from former FDA Commissioner David Kessler)\nTo reduce the initiation and use of tobacco by young people,\nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an investi-\ngation to answer two questions: Can nicotine be considered a\ndrug under the Federal Government's Food, Drug and Cosmetics\nAct? If so, what is the appropriate strategy to regulate this drug?\nEvidence that nicotine can be considered a drug. The Fed-\neral Government's Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines a drug\nas ``an article (except for food) intended to affect the structure\nand function of the body.'' The scientific literature demonstrates\nthat nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has such an\neffect on the body. Since the early 1990s, there has been almost\nuniversal agreement within the scientific and medical commu-\nnities that nicotine is an addictive drug.\nDuring its investigation, the FDA discovered that the tobacco\nindustry also knew about nicotine's addictive properties. In the\nearly 1980s, Phillip Morris (New York, NY) forced one of its\nscientists, Dr. Victor DeNoble, to withdraw a manuscript he had\nsubmitted to the Journal of Psychopharmacology. Dr. DeNoble\nhad found that rats will self-administer nicotine, one of the hall-\nmark properties of an addictive substance, and conducted tests\non nicotine analogues to find a substitute that could duplicate\nnicotine's psychoactive and reinforcing effects.\nHowever, to consider nicotine a drug, the FDA also had to\nhave evidence of intention to produce nicotine's pharmacologic\neffects. The FDA uncovered 30 years of industry documents that\ndescribe research by the tobacco industry to understand the phar-\nmacology of nicotine, including the minimum dose needed to\nsatisfy smokers. Specifically, the internal documents from\nPhillip Morris and Brown & Williamson (Louisville, KY) re-\nvealed that both companies conducted research on nicotine phar-\nmacology and manipulation and acknowledged nicotine's cen-\ntral role in sustaining tobacco use. For example, the industry\nfound it could increase the amount of nicotine in a cigarette by\nusing high-nicotine tobacco and adding letulic acid to mask the\nharsh flavor of high-nicotine tobacco. One company's handbook\non leaf blending and product development also describes how\nthe industry uses ammonia to ``liberate free nicotine from the\nblend, which is associated with increases in impact and satis-\nfaction reported by smokers.''\nEvidence that tobacco is marketed to youth. The second\nphase of the FDA investigation examined the way the tobacco\nindustry markets its products to young people. An internal R. J.\nReynolds (RJR) document reported that ``evidence is now avail-\nable to indicate that the 14\u00ad18 year old group is an increasing\nsegment of the smoking population. RJR [team] must soon es-\ntablish a successful new brand in this market if our position in\nthe industry is to be maintained over the long term.'' RJR later\nintroduced the Joe Camel character. The FDA found that Joe\nCamel promotional items played a central role in RJR's YAS\n(Young Adult Smokers) program.\nStrategy to reduce tobacco use by youth. On the basis of\nthis evidence, the FDA developed the following two-pronged\nstrategy to regulate the sale and marketing of tobacco products\nto youth:\n1) Minimize access by restricting the sale of ciga-\nrettes and tobacco to face-to-face transactions and\nby banning the distribution of tobacco in vending\nmachines, mail-order sales, self-service displays,\nand free samples.\n2) Minimize the impact of tobacco advertisements\nthat play on the themes of fun, rebellion, glamour,\nfreedom, and independence--themes with particu-\nlar appeal to adolescents.\n3) Ban outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of play-\ngrounds and schools and restrict all other adver-\ntising to black and white, text-only format to re-\nduce imagery that appeals to youth.\n4) Eliminate brand name promotions on nontobacco\nitems (e.g., hats and t-shirts).\n5) Limit the sponsorship of sporting and cultural\nevents by tobacco companies to the use of the\ncorporate name, not the brand name.\nNational Strategies to Combat Tobacco Use and Addiction\n(Remarks from former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop)\nNicotine regulation will play a major role on the part of\ngovernment, the health care community, and society at large in\nthe near future. As described above, the demand that the Food\nand Drug Administration be involved in regulating nicotine has\nbeen intensified because of the recently publicized reports that\ncigarette companies manipulate nicotine levels to ensure a nico-\ntine level sufficient to create and sustain addiction. But, winning\nthe war against the tobacco industry and against nicotine addic-\ntion will require more than a regulation of nicotine. It will re-\nquire a variety of strategies aimed at reducing the demand for\nsmoking by:\n\u00b7 Changing public attitudes about tobacco, the to-\nbacco industry, and tobacco addiction.\n\u00b7 Despoiling the myth of the economic necessity of\ntobacco and impressing on the public the hypocrisy\nof allowing tobacco companies to export tobacco\nwhile the U.S. takes actions against other countries\nthat import cocaine to our country;\n\u00b7 Broadening the legal attack on the tobacco indus-\ntries and their advertising practices, especially those\ndirected to youth; and\n\u00b7 Taking a more active role in prevention in the\nhealthcare arena.\nChanging public attitudes. More action can be taken in this\nregard to improve the dialog between smokers and nonsmokers\nand encourage third-party payers to support smoking-cessation\nprograms. Many insurance companies still will not pay a mere\n$50 to help a patient participate in a smoking-cessation program,\nalthough they willingly pay huge sums for medical care related\nto smoking-induced illness. Thoughtful and effective ways to\ndeal with the issue of nicotine addiction are needed.\nDespoiling the myth of tobacco economics. Clear, long-\nrange strategies to deal with the economic myths and realities of\ntobacco are also needed. Despite the argument that tobacco re-\nstrictions would have a negative effect on the American\neconomy, a number of studies have shown that this is not the\ncase. Moreover, the right of a few individuals to profit from a\nproduct that kills many of their fellow citizens every year is\nquestionable. Clearly, tobacco is costing the individual tobacco\nproducing states and country more than it profits either one.\nBroadening the legal attack on the tobacco industry and\ntobacco advertising. Although the recent, large, class-action\nsuit (Costanzo) met a discouraging setback, State suits aimed at\nrecovering Medicaid expenditures on smoking-related disease\nmay eventually prevail (see Authors' note below). It may yet be\npossible to win a successful liability lawsuit against a tobacco\ncompany.\nFocusing physicians on tobacco-addiction prevention. Fi-\nnally, American physicians need to be encouraged to be more\neffective in their intervention with both their nonsmoking and\ntheir smoking patients. Doctors need to take advantage of every\nprofessional encounter with a patient to intervene against smok-\ning in that patient's life or in the life of a family member.\nAuthor's Note\nBefore publication of this article, negotiations between State\nAttorneys General and tobacco companies resulted in a pending\nlegislative proposal for Congressional consideration. Included in\nthis complex settlement are provisions to restrict the advertising\nand sales of tobacco, to restrict smoking in public places, to penal-\nize tobacco companies if youth smoking rates are not reduced, and\nto require stronger warning labels on tobacco products. Tobacco\ncompanies have also agreed to provide funds for medical research,\nsmoking-cessation programs, public education about tobacco, and\nenforcement of the settlement provisions. The medical research\nfunds alone would total $25 billion over 8 years.\nDrs. C. Everett Koop and David Kessler chaired a committee\nof public health experts convened to advise the Congress about\nthe settlement. Their committee recommended many modifica-\ntions and additions to the settlement. In particular, they recom-\nmended that the FDA retain the ability to regulate the nicotine\ncontent of cigarettes and that the penalties be increased for to-\nbacco companies if youth smoking rates do not fall. The com-\nmittee proposed even larger budgets for the public health and\nresearch programs in the settlement. They also suggested provi-\nsions to help tobacco farmers convert to other crops and to reduce\ntobacco use in other nations. Currently, the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services is conducting a complete review of the\nsettlement to make recommendations to the President.\nReferences\n(1) Kramer B.
