Despite these alarming\nfigures, juvenile sex offending has been an overlooked phenomenon in crimino-\nlogical research for more than half a century (Terry, 2005). For most of that\nperiod, juvenile sex offenders were also a low priority in penal legislation and\nthe administration of juvenile justice. They were either referred to traditional\ncounseling services (Ryan, 1998) or were not given any treatment at all based on\nthe assumption that juvenile sexual offending is harmless (Ryan, 1999). For the\npast ten years, however, sex offenders--including children and teens--have\nbecome a much more important issue in penal legislation, including community\np. 294; see also Garfinkle, 2003) these legal interventions are predicated upon a\nseries of false assumptions including: (1) the belief that there is an epidemic of\njuvenile offending and juvenile sexual offending; (2) juvenile sex offenders are\nmore similar to adult sex offenders than other delinquents; and (3) juvenile sex\noffenders have exceptionally high recidivism rates. Nevertheless, in this new\npenal environment, the lack of data on youthful sex offenders that continue\ntheir sexual offending into adulthood has become a major embarrassment.\nFortunately, the youth cohort studies of the last few decades that have\ngarnered a substantial amount of attention in the criminological literature\n(e.g., the Racine Birth Cohorts, the  ) provide\nan opportunity to obtain good data on youthful sex offenders and their later\ncareers.\nThis study reports our effort to examine data on the continuity of juvenile\nand young adult sex offending available in the 1958 Second Philadelphia Birth\nto examine patterns of juvenile sexual offending and the impact of a juvenile\npolice contact for a sex offense on the likelihood of sex offending in adulthood.\nFirst, we offer a brief review of the prior research investigating juvenile sex\nrecidivism in general, and then provide a discussion of the few recent studies\nexploring the link between juvenile and adult sex offending in particular. Next,\nwe demonstrate a profile of the patterns of juvenile sex offending and sex\noffenders, which is followed with an examination of the data on adult sexual\noffending for the total sample and for the group within the sample that had sex\noffense police contacts during their juvenile careers. Lastly, we conclude by\ninvestigating the ability to predict adult sex offending based on a history of\njuvenile sex offending and the frequency of juvenile sex offending. The general\npattern we find is that juveniles with sexually based police contacts have a high\nvolume of non-sex contacts and a low rate of sexual recidivism during their\njuvenile careers, and an even lower probability for sexual offending during\nyoung adulthood. Policy implications for the findings presented in this study are\nalso discussed.\nPrior Research on the Continuity of Sex Offending\nAlthough there exists a sizable literature linking juvenile to adult patterns of\noffending (Piquero, Farrington, & Blumstein, 2003) and a growing amount of\nresearch has recently begun to examine juvenile sex offender recidivism (Abel,\ning juvenile sex offenders with juvenile non-sex offenders (Van Wijk et al.,\n2006), there is only a scant amount of research investigating the possible link\nbetween juvenile and adult sex offending (Burton, 2000).\nAlthough Doren's (1998) early review of the sex offender recidivism literature\nsuggested that sex offenders remained at continued risk for sex recidivism for\ndecades, the studies conducted in the 1980s were usually cross-sectional and\nretrospective studies of adult sex offenders (Abel et al., 1985; Becker et al.,\nrevealed a sex offender continuity rate of 9.7 percent for 164 juvenile sex\noffenders. These researchers also found that having a juvenile sex arrest was\nsignificantly related to having an adult sex arrest when compared with other\njuvenile offenders, but the sample was composed of only nonviolent sex offend-\ners; therefore, these results are unlikely to be generalizable to other samples of\njuvenile sex offenders. In contrast, Rubinstein, Yeager, Goodstein, and Lewis\ners who began their sexual offending in adolescence; however, this is an\nextremely small sample, and other researchers have noted that this sample was\nespecially violent and these results are unlikely to be representative of juvenile\nsex offenders either (Sipe et al., 1998). Relying on conviction data, Hagan and\nGust-Brey (1999) reported an 8 percent to 16 percent sex recidivism rate among\na sample of adolescent rapists based upon a 5- and 10-year follow-up, respec-\ntively. Thus, according to a review of the minimal sex offending continuity liter-\nLangstr\u00f6m & Grann, 2000), these earlier studies (with the exception of Rubin-\nstein et al., 1993) indicate that juvenile sex offender recidivism rates lie\nbetween 3 percent and 14 percent with general recidivism rates between 14\npercent and 60 percent after six years of follow-up.\nMore recently, Nisbet, Wilson, and Smallbone (2004) followed a sample of\n303 adolescent male sex offenders in New South Wales, Australia for an average\nof a little over seven years post adjudication for a sex offense. Their results\nsuggested that while 25 percent of the males were reconvicted for a sex offense\nin their juvenile careers, only 9 percent were rearrested and 5 percent were\nreconvicted for a sex offense in adulthood. Similarly, based on a ten year\nfollow-up of incarcerated male juvenile sex offenders that participated in two\nsex offender treatment programs in Virginia, Waite et al. (2005) reported a sex\nrecidivism rate of less than 5 percent regardless of program intensity and a non-\nsex recidivism rate near 40 percent. In another comprehensive study investigat-\ning the continuity of juvenile sex offending into adulthood, Vandiver (2006)\nassessed the sex recidivism rates of 300 registered male sex offenders in Texas\nfor 3\u00ad6 years after having reached adulthood. Vandiver's results indicated that\nonly 13 of the 300 (4.3 percent) juvenile male sex offenders recidivated as an\nadult for a sex offense. This finding highlights the virtual absence of sex offend-\ning continuity; by contrast, it is important to note that almost half of these\njuvenile sex offenders did in fact recidivate as an adult for a non-sex offense.\nZimring et al. (2007) provided the most recent study to date exploring sex\noffender continuity and improved upon prior research by utilizing a large\ncommunity-based sample of males and females from Racine, Wisconsin.\nThrough a series of bivariate analyses, Zimring et al. indicated that there was\nlittle to no association between being a juvenile sex offender and having contin-\nued this behavior into adulthood for either male or female youth. More specifi-\ncally, once they estimated the effects in a multivariate context, their results\ndemonstrated that having a juvenile sex offense did not significantly predict an\nindividual's likelihood for being an adult sex offender. Furthermore, Zimring\net al. found a robust significant effect for the length of a juvenile's record for\npredicting adult sex offender status; in other words, offense frequency rather\nthan juvenile sex offending was the better predictor of adult sex offending.\nCurrent Focus\nOverall, one finding that has emerged from this small line of research is the\nrelatively high rates of non-sexual adult offending for the juvenile sex offend-\ners. It appears then, that there is little power for a juvenile sex offense for\npredicting an adult sex offense, and that juvenile sex offenders tend not to\nspecialize (Miethe, Olson, & Mitchell, 2006). Still, this and other research\nassessing the potential link between juvenile and adult sex offending remains\nlimited such that reaching any firm conclusions is premature (Burton, 2000). For\nexample, with the exception of a few of the most recent studies (Nisbet et al.,\nprior studies dealing with juvenile sex offenders have relied on small clinical or\nincarcerated samples with little generalizability. Additionally, Nisbet et al.\nprior studies as well) utilized a sample of male juvenile sex offenders, limiting\ngeneralizabilty. Comparatively, Zimring et al.'s (2007) study is perhaps the most\ncomprehensive research in the criminological literature exploring the continuity\nof juvenile sex offending into adulthood using a community-based sample of\nmales and females (Miner, 2007), but uses a racially homogenous (mainly White)\nsample from a small midwestern city, with low evidence of serious criminality\ngenerally, and non-minor sex offending in particular.\nAttending to the issues mentioned above and following the research design of\nZimring et al., this study investigated the ability of a juvenile sex offense to\npredict adult sex offender recidivism among males and females from the Second\ndirect replication and extension of the Zimring et al. study with the Philadel-\nphia data is especially important because the Philadelphia data comprise a large\nsample of individuals who \"grew up\" during a period of increasing crime rates in\na rather high crime social context, are much more racially heterogeneous\n(including both Whites and Blacks), are from a major urban city, and have\nextensive evidence of serious criminal activity, all features that depart signifi-\ncantly from much of the prior sex offender research generally, and the Racine\ndata used by Zimring et al. in particular.\nMethodology\nData\nA review of research on juvenile sex offenders found several studies of groups of\nsuch offenders (Zimring, 2004) but no data from the series of birth cohort stud-\nies (with the exception of Zimring et al., 2007), such as those from Philadelphia\nthat followed large samples of city residents born in the same year through\nadolescence and into young adulthood (Wolfgang, Figlio, & Sellin, 1972;\nwas quite large and was followed up through eight years post age 18 or through\nage 26. The main focus was on subjects with police contacts for sex offenses\nduring the years prior to age 18, which was a total of 204 boys and 17 girls. The\nfact that the number of juveniles with police contacts for sex offenses was small\nis, in itself, an important observation because of the perception that such\noffenders are rampant (see Letourneau & Miner, 2005). Additionally, we also\nrecognize that some readers may question the inclusion of the small number of\nfemale (sex offenders) in the sample as appropriate, and thus favor their exclu-\nsion. However, it is important to retain the females not only because they have\nbeen neglected in extant criminological research generally, but their exclusion\nin the sex offender research area has been specifically noted. The fact that\nthere are so few female sex offenders, especially sex recidivists, is an important\nfinding in and of itself, and their exclusion, because of the small number of\ncases, would likely not have had altered any of the statistical or substantive\nfindings and conclusions. Thus, they are retained in the current study.\nThe primary data on criminal justice involvement in the Philadelphia studies\nis police record data, which is the first official record of criminal activity and of\ncourse the largest number of official offenses will be at the police contact level.\nData were available for all juvenile police contacts prior to age 18 and for all\nadult offenses during the eight years following age 18. Specifically, according to\nTracy and Kempf-Leonard (1996, p. 65), \"police rap sheets and investigation\nreports were provided by the Juvenile Aid Division of the Philadelphia Police\nDepartment to characterize police encounters experienced by the Cohort before\nage 18.\" Further, \"[t]he Municipal and Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia\nserved as data sources for offenses committed by the cohort after reaching the\nlegislatively imposed adult status of age 18. Court files included police reports,\nso data on adult crime are comparable to that for delinquency. The exception,\nof course, is that no official \"remedial\" report exists for adults who encoun-\ntered police, but who were not arrested. Adult criminal history data were\nmembers\" (Tracy & Kempf-Leonard, 1996, p. 65). A more general overview of\nthe offending careers of the Cohort may be found elsewhere (Tracy et al., 1990;\nWe recognize that there are strengths and weaknesses from using either offi-\ncial (police contact, arrest, conviction) or self-report data to measure criminal\nchose to use the official police records that had true crime codes (i.e., status\noffenses, traffic offenses, city ordinance violations, etc. were removed)\nbecause they are (1) a more accurate official measure of \"true\" offending and\nthey are (2) closer in time to the actual criminal act than self-reported offend-\ning. Overall, the analyses presented in the following section were based on the\nspecifically investigating the link between juvenile and adult sex offending\namong the 221 juvenile sex offenders.\nAnalytic Procedure\nSimilar to the methodological design and statistical techniques adopted by\nZimring et al.'s study, the analysis described below progressed in several\nstages. First, we began our analysis by investigating the prevalence and\nfrequency of juvenile sex and non-sex offending among males and females.\nSecond, we examined the prevalence and frequency of adult sex and non-sex\noffending and discuss these findings with attention toward the continuity of\nsex offending from adolescence to adulthood. Third, we considered the types of\nsex offenses that characterized the juvenile careers of those youth who had a\nsexually based police contact prior to age 18 compared with the adult sex\noffenders who did not have an officially recorded juvenile sex offense in their\ncriminal career. This stage of the analysis also involved a series of bivariate\ncomparisons exploring the nature of sex and non-sex recidivism, specialization,\nand any identifiable features of juvenile sex offenders. Last, we estimated two\nmultinomial logistic regression models to determine the ability to predict an\nindividual's adult criminal record (i.e., no-record, non-sex offending, sex and\nnon-sex offending, or sex-only offending) with a juvenile sex offense (yes/no)\nand/or based on the frequency of a juvenile's sex offending.\nResults\nJuvenile Sex Offending in Philadelphia\nFewer than 30 percent of the Philadelphia boys had a police record by age 18\nand a total of 1.6 percent had sex offense records. The girls had just above a\nquarter of the police contact rate, 7.4 percent versus 28 percent, but only 17 of\n14,000 girls--slightly more than one in every thousand--had an official juvenile\nsex offense contact. There were no indications that female sex offense contacts\nduring the juvenile period were related to future sex recidivism either in their\njuvenile career or into young adulthood. Only two of the 17 females with a\njuvenile sex contact had a second such contact during the juvenile period, and\nnone of the 17 girls had any sex offenses during the eight years following age 18.\nRegarding the males, a sex offense contact was the only juvenile offense for\nless than a fifth of the males (see Figure 1), and the median number of total\njuvenile contacts was six (M= 7.4 contacts).\nFigure 1 Total juvenile contacts for males with sex offense contacts\nSo, the question is: what distinguishes these juvenile sex offenders from the\njuvenile non-sex offenders? The juveniles with a sex contact had three times the\nmedian rate of total juvenile contacts than the juvenile offenders without a sex\ncontact. A little more than half of the juveniles with any sex contacts had the\nfive contacts that Wolfgang et al. (1972) regarded as the threshold for chronic\noffending, but very few of the police contacts among this group were for sex\noffenses. Approximately 85 percent of the juvenile sex contact group had only\none such sex contact and 80 percent of all the police contacts for the group did\nnot involve sex offenses. There were however, race and socioeconomic differences\nFigure 1 Total juvenile contacts for males with sex offense contacts.\nbetween the juvenile sex offenders and the juvenile non-sex offenders. The\nNevertheless, the primary characteristic of the male juvenile sex contact\ngroup in Philadelphia was the extraordinary frequency of both total and non-\nsexual police contacts but single sex contact histories. What set these boys apart\nfrom other juvenile males with police records was a differential probability to be\ncontacted several times for non-sex offenses prior to reaching age 18 and being\nnon-White and from a low SES background. The juvenile sex offenders appeared\nto be the very opposite of specialists--typically one-time sex offenders but many\ntime offenders for everything else. As Zimring et al. (2007, p. 527) have\nsuggested, sex offenders just tend to \"roll the dice more often.\"\nAdult Sex Offending and Investigating Sex Offending Continuity\nin Philadelphia\nIn order to more effectively answer the continuity question surrounding sex\noffending, it was important to first examine the sex and non-sex offending\npatterns of the adults in Philadelphia compared with the juvenile rates for these\noffenses. Among the males, 23.2 percent had an adult record, a smaller figure\nthan was found in the juvenile years. Further, 2.4 percent of all the males had\nan adult record for a sexually based offense, which was a larger proportion of the\nmale population (2.4 percent versus 1.6 percent) and more than twice the\nproportion of males with any police record (10.1 percent versus 4.7 percent) than\nwas found among the same males as juveniles. The prevalence of sex offending\nwas higher after age 18 and the share of all offenses that involved a sex offense\nincreased substantially for the males after turning age 18. Comparatively, 3.8\npercent of the females had an adult record, but the prevalence of sex offending\nwas only three-tenths of one percent. While this was a larger proportion than was\nfound among the juvenile females, the eight years of exposure could likely\naccount for much of the difference.\nThe most striking feature of the Philadelphia data was the lack of overlap\nbetween juvenile sex offending and adult sex offending. For the girls, none of\nthe juvenile sex offender contact group (n=17) could be found among the group\nwho had a sexually based offense past the age of 18. If one were estimating the\nimpact of a registration system from these data, the false positive rate among\nthe juvenile females for adult sex offending would be 100 percent and similarly,\n100 percent of the adult female sex offenders would not have been part of the\nregistry in the first place. Therefore, it is arithmetically impossible for a predic-\ntion system to have had a poorer performance than the outcome for Philadelphia\nfemales.\nFor the males, the predictions of adult sexual offending were also quite poor\nif not in the zero range. One in ten of the males with juvenile sex offense\ncontacts had an adult sex offense record in Philadelphia in the follow-up period\nafter age 18. Furthermore, the 53 sex offenses attributed to this group were\n7.8 percent of the total adult sex offenses attributable to the cohort males. So,\nusing the juvenile sex records to predict who would become an adult sex\noffender in this scenario produced a false positive rate of 90 percent for the\nyoung men targeted while it also missed 92.2 percent of all the adult male sex\noffenders. Both the false positive and false negative rates were 90 percent or\ngreater, a discouraging record for predictions of dangerousness over an eight-\nyear period in young adulthood.\nOverall, the lack of association between juvenile sex offending and adult sex\noffending was not simply a function of the low base expectancy rate of adult sex\noffenses. One possible explanation was that the juvenile sex offenders were\nspectacularly non-specialized. The 204 male juvenile sex offenders were\nresponsible for a total of 446 adult offenses, which were only 5.6 percent of the\ntotal adult sex and non-sex offenses for the males. Juvenile sex offenders were\nnot significantly more likely than other adults with a record to have had an\nadult offense that involved sex.\nThe results of an additional effort to explore the possible differences in the\ntypes of sex offenses committed by those who do continue their sex offending\ninto adulthood versus those that did not begin their sex offending careers until\nadulthood are presented in Table 1. The main findings were that rape and indecent\nassaultwerethemostprevalentsexoffensesforbothjuvenileandadultsexoffend-\ners as well as for the adult-only sex offenders (although corrupting the morals of\na minor was the second most prevalent sex offense type among the adult-only\nsex offenders). The remaining categories of sex offenses were relatively similar;\ntherefore, the only significant mean differences detected between juvenile and\nadult sex offenders and adult-only sex offenders were that the males who began\ntheir sex offending as a juvenile and continued their sex offending behavior into\nTable 1 Adult sex offense type by former juvenile sex offenders and adult-only sex\noffenders\nJuvenile sex offenders with\nan adult sex offense % Adult-only sex offenders %\nForcible rape 62% Corrupting morals of a minor 43%\nCorrupting morals of a minor 38% Indecent assault 42%\nDeviate involuntary sex 24% Public indecency 15%*\nIncest 5%* Deviate involuntary 12%\nProstitution/solicitation 0% Prostitution/solicitation 4%\nStatutory rape 0% Statutory rape 4%\nDeviate voluntary sex 0% Deviate voluntary sex 2%\nPublic Indecency 0% Incest 0.3%\nadulthood were significantly more likely to have committed an indecent assault\nthe adult-only sex offenders. The adult-only sex offenders also were significantly\nmore likely to have committed a public indecency offense (t = 1.944; p < .05).\nContinuing the Search for Prediction\nThere were some indications in the timing of the sex offenses for juveniles with\nan adult sex record that any sexual offending in adulthood by the former juvenile\nsex offenders began early if at all. A majority of all of the adult sex careers\nstarted in the first two years after age 18, and 81 percent of all adult sex careers\nwere initiated in the first four years. Thus, the total number of new sex offenders\nin the four years after age 21 was 2 percent of the juveniles with sex records. If\nthat approximate decline in new cases persisted in future five-year periods (e.g.,\n1 drop pattern continues), the best guess of sex offending for male adulthood\nwould be between 12 percent and 14 percent lifetime.\nWhile a 10 percent continuity rate for sex offending was not large, it was still\nbetter than the 2.4 percent prevalence of adult sex offending for all the males.\nThere were two reasons why it is important to further examine what elements\nof a juvenile record might predict adult sex offending. The first reason was to\ndetermine whether some combination of prior record might make for a much\nbetter eight-year risk prediction than the 10 percent found for all juvenile sex\noffenders. The second reason to test for different predictions was to see which\nof the two distinguishing characteristics of juvenile sex offenders--a high\nvolume of juvenile contacts or a history of juvenile sex offending--was the\nbetter predictor of an adult sex record.\nThe pattern displayed in Figure 2 was clear. Only one category of juvenile\nmales had a lower rate of adult sex offending than the overall male mean of 2.4\npercent: males with no juvenile contacts had a 1.4 percent rate of adult sex\noffenses. At the high end, no combination of prior sex offending and prior\ncontacts had a much larger true positive rate than 15.6 percent. Juveniles with\nJuveniles with no contacts\nJuveniles with <5 contacts, none for sex\nJuveniles with <5 contacts, at least 1 for sex\nJuveniles with >5 contacts, none for sex\nJuveniles with >5 contacts, at least one for sex\nFigure 2 Distinguishing adult sex offenders based on juvenile record.\nmore than five total juvenile police contacts (over half of total juvenile sex\noffenders) who also had a juvenile sex contact had a 15.6 percent rate of sex\noffending in the eight years following age 18. The next highest sex offending\ngroup in adulthood were the males with no juvenile sex offenses but five or more\ntotal juvenile police contacts (9.1 percent). Non-sex offending juveniles with\nfive contacts (9.1 percent) were more than twice as likely as juvenile sex offend-\ners without long general records (4.2 percent) to end up as adult sex offenders.\nAnd the juveniles with fewer than five contacts including a sex offense (4.2\npercent) were no more likely to have an adult sex record than juveniles with\nfewer than five contacts and no sex offenses (4.1 percent).\nFigure 2 Distinguishing adult sex offenders based on juvenile record\nResults from an analysis of variance indicated that while having a juvenile\np<.001), post hoc tests suggested that neither the juveniles with less than five\ncontacts and at least one sex contact (4.2 percent) significantly differed from\njuveniles with less than five contacts and no juvenile sex contact (4.1 percent).\nMore importantly, significant mean differences were not detected between the\nhigh contact juvenile sex offender group (i.e., five or more contacts; 15.6\npercent) and their non-sex high contact counterparts (9.1 percent). This illus-\ntrated that although the rate of adult sex contact may differ slightly in magni-\ntude, there was no significant difference in increasing the ability to gauge adult\nsex offending by a boy having exhibited juvenile sex offending behavior, holding\ntheir high juvenile offending frequency constant.1\nThe bivariate results discussed earlier provided a basis for investigating the\npossible association or lack of association between juvenile and adult sex offend-\ning; however, it was necessary to further evaluate this continuity assumption\nwithin the context of a multivarite model as recently presented by Zimring et al.\n(2007). Specifically, we estimate two multinomial logistic regression models,\nwhere the outcome variable, adult record type, comprises four categories (adult\ncontacts--no sex contact, adult contacts--sex and other contact, and adult\ncontacts--sex only contact; omitted reference category no adult contacts), and\nfour independent variables: sex (male), race (non-White), juvenile sex offending\n(a: no/yes, b: frequency), and juvenile police contacts.\nThe results from the first multinomial logistic regression model (see Table 2)\nsupported the expectation on the nature of the relationship between juvenile\nand adult sex offending. Consistent with Zimring et al., being male and non-\nWhite significantly increased the odds of an individual being an adult offender\nacross all adult record types (i.e., non-sex offender, sex and non-sex offender,\n1. In accordance with guidelines regarding the appropriate post hoc procedures (see Field, 2005),\nwe relied on both Dunnett's C and Games\u00adHowell post hoc tests because of the unequal sizes of the\ngroups and because the results from a Levene test indicated that the assumption of equal popula-\ntion variances (i.e., homogeneity of variances) was violated. The results from these post-hoc tests\nindicated that the first and second groups shown in Figure 2 (i.e., the 9.1 percent and 15.6 percent\ngroups) were not significantly different from one another; the 15.6 percent group was significantly\ndifferent from the other three groups (4.2 percent, 4.1 percent, and 1.4 percent); and the 9.1\npercent group was significantly different from the same three groups (4.2 percent, 4.1 percent, and\nand sex-only offender), with non-adult offenders left out as the reference\ncategory. More importantly, the results indicated that having a juvenile sex\noffense (no/yes) contributed virtually nothing insofar as predicting membership\nin any adult offender group, and particularly failing to predict the odds of being\nan adult sex offender. In fact, the frequency of a juvenile's police contacts was\nthe better predictor of being an adult sex offender.\nThe results from the second multinomial logistic regression model further\nconfirmed the findings of the previous model. The only difference between this\nmodel and the former model was that in the first model a dichotomous variable\nwas used for being a juvenile sex offender (no/yes) and this second model incor-\nporated the frequency of a juvenile's sex offending. According to the results\npresented in Table 3, once again, being male and non-White significantly\nincreased the odds of being an adult offender (i.e., non-sex offender, sex and\nnon-sex offender, and sex-only offender), and in this case, the frequency of\njuvenile sex offending did relatively nothing for predicting being an adult sex\noffender either. The frequency of a juvenile's police contacts was once again\nthe better predictor of being an adult sex offender.\nDiscussion\nThis study sought to examine the natural history of sex offenders and sex offend-\ning using data from the  . In addition to providing\nbaseline data on juvenile and early adult sex offending patterns, we also sought\nto examine the linkage between juvenile and adult sex offending as well as eval-\nuating the predictive power of juvenile sex offending on adult sex offending. In\nTable 2 Multinomial logistic regression predicting adult offender status with a history of\njuvenile sex offendinga\nAdult contacts\n(no sex contacts)\nAdult contacts (sex\nand other contacts)\nAdult contacts\n(sex-only contacts)\nVariables Wald Odds Wald Odds Wald Odds\naCohort members with no adult offenses served as the reference category for the dependent\nvariable (i.e., adult record type).\nso doing, this research directly assessed several of the key assumptions of recid-\nivism and specialization underlying current public policies regarding sex offenders\nand sexual offending.\nThe general pattern we found was that juveniles with sexually based police\ncontacts had a high volume of non-sex contacts and a low rate of sexual recidi-\nvism during their juvenile careers, and an even lower likelihood of continuing\ntheir sexual offending behavior into adulthood. The pattern observed was\nconsistent with regarding juvenile sex offenders as a representative group of\nactive delinquents without any pronounced tendencies for sexual specialization\nthe standpoint of justifying special registration for juvenile sex offenders, it is\nhard to imagine a more devastating pattern than the comparison between\nactive offenders without juvenile sex records and juvenile sex offenders. Total\njuvenile police contacts were a more efficient predictor of future sexual danger\nin young adulthood than a history of juvenile sex offending or the frequency of\njuvenile sex offending. The best prediction of an adult sex offense was a high-\nfrequency juvenile police contact record, whether or not any of the youthful\ncontacts involved a sex offense.\nThe cohort data from Philadelphia also provided a limited but valuable\nopportunity to estimate the impact of sex offender registration and notification\nprograms that either do or do not require juvenile offenders to participate.\nBecause these cohort studies start with large and representative slices of the\npopulation, it was possible to know what percentage of a particular birth\ncohort's total known adult sex offenders would be in a registry if a particular\nlaw applied. Based on the results from this study, a registration provision that\nTable 3 Multinomial logistic regression predicting adult offender status with juvenile\nsex offending frequencya\nAdult contacts\n(no sex contacts)\nAdult contacts\n(sex and other\ncontacts)\nAdult contacts\n(sex-only\ncontacts)\nVariables Wald Odds Wald Odds Wald Odds\naCohort members with no adult offenses served as the reference category for the dependent\nvariable (i.e., adult record type).\nused all juvenile sex offenders would have identified a total of four males who\nwould have an adult sex record starting at some time after age 22 in addition to\n17 males who had already had sex offenses after age 18. So, including all\njuvenile sex offenders would have added four future sex offenders to the regis-\ntry along with 183 males who would not have sexually recidivated but must\nregister. Thus, the marginal number of true positives contributed by juvenile\nrecords would have been four, and the rate of marginal true-to-false positives\nwould have been 2.2 percent. Or stated differently, about two in one hundred\npersons added to the registry would not have been present in the predicted\ndangerous group because of their sexually based offending prior to age 22, but\nwould have been likely to offend by age 26. Ninety-eight percent of the individ-\nuals added by juvenile records who did not also have an adult sex offense by age\n22 would not have an adult sex record by age 26.\nMight this registry be effective nonetheless by providing the police with a\nreliable group of potential suspects? The problem here would be that 92 percent\nof all the adult male sex offenders were never juvenile sex offenders so the\nregistry would be a very poor predictive tool. If this juvenile registry was used\nto \"round up the usual suspects,\" 49 persons would have been needlessly\npredicted as sexually dangerous for every truly dangerous person so concerned,\nand more than 92 percent of true offenders would not have been on the regis-\ntry. That appears to be a poor prediction tool for police and prosecutors and a\nprediction made about adult sex recidivism risk that would be wrong about\n98 percent of the time.\nWith regard to public policy, the data available from the juvenile and young\nadult histories in the   stand in sharp contrast to\nthe assumptions about juvenile sex offenders as outlined by Letourneau and\npassed by the US House of Representatives in 2005 (House of Representatives\noffenders including juveniles if convicted of acts that would have been felonies\nif committed by adults. Some consensual conduct is excluded for some teens, but\nchildren under 13 years of age are subject to life-long sex offender registration\nif their partners are under 13 years of age as well. The assumption of the legis-\nlation is that juvenile sex offending predicts high levels of sex offending as\nadults. The facts are that, at least in the large birth cohort data used in the\ncurrent study, nine out of ten juvenile sex offenders do not sexually re-offend\nduring the first eight years of legal adulthood and the temporal pattern of sex\nrecidivism suggests that more than 85 percent of juvenile sex offenders will not\nrecidivate for a sexually based offense. The Philadelphia data show that 92\npercent of those cohort members who will commit sex offenses as adults had not\ncommitted any juvenile sex offenses. So the bill would falsely classify between\n85 percent and 95 percent of its juvenile subjects as sexual risks for life while it\nwould miss far more than nine out of ten of the true adult sexual risks.\nConsistent with the results of Zimring et al., which employed a similar research\nand statistical design and relied on data from another large community-based\ncohort study, the findings in this study exposed the complete poverty of juvenile\nsexual behavior as a predictor of adult sexual offending. More specifically, the\nhistory or frequency of juvenile sex offending did little to assist in predicting adult\nsex offending over and above knowledge of the frequency of juvenile offenses--\nespecially a high frequency of non-sex offenses. It was not merely that juvenile\nsex offenders were at a lower risk of adult sexual offending. They were actually\nless of a risk than discrete categories of active auto thieves and shoplifters. It\nwould actually have been more efficient to make juveniles with more than five\ncontacts who did not have any juvenile sex record register as potential sex offend-\ners. In the end, whatever the merits of adult sex offender registration, the\naddition of juvenile sex offenders is more than problematic if these Philadelphia\ndata and the Racine-based results provided by Zimring et al. provide an accurate\nprospectus.\nAt the same time, due to several data limitations, our effort is not the last\nword on the sex offender continuity issue. For example, the data used in this\nstudy come from one inner city (i.e., Philadelphia) during a specific historical\ncontext where the cohort members were born in the late 1950s, socialized in\n1970s. The extent to which our results are replicable in other cities and during\nmore recent time periods remains unknown. However, the findings from this\nstudy bear a remarkable similarity to those of Zimring et al., which provides\npreliminary support for the generalizability of these findings considering the\nsalient differences in the demographics, time periods, and social contexts\nbetween Racine, WI and Philadelphia, PA. Such a replication of important\nsubstantive results is not the norm in the social sciences, especially when one\nconsiders the vast differences across the two data sources. Nevertheless, like\nour study, Zimring et al.'s research also relied on historical data; however, this\nlimitation must be considered while taking into account the reality that any\nlongitudinal study of sex offending that covers such a wide range of years will\nalways be subject to this particular data concern (e.g., Laub & Sampson,\nIt is also important to mention here that since the majority of research on sex\noffenders has relied on small samples of juvenile or adult incarcerated sex\noffenders or juvenile or adult sex offenders already in treatment, the findings\nfrom our community-based sample (like Zimring et al.'s) are much more\ngeneralizable compared to findings from prior research. Similarly, although it is\ndifficult to determine if the true incidence of sex offending has changed over\nthe past quarter century, it is even more difficult to assess how the criminal\njustice system has altered its response to sex offending. Ideally, replication of\nour work using offender- and victim-based self-reports would help in this\nregard. The Philadelphia data does tell when the police contacts resulted in\nofficial arrests; however, the data do not usually note if a police charge was\nlater determined not to be true. On the other hand, the data did not ignore the\nvery large number of factually accurate criminal charges that are nonetheless\nnot followed by a conviction. Finally, the Philadelphia data did not contain\ninformation on exposure time, or the time that individuals were incarcerated\nfor their crimes. Thus, to the extent that offenders--specifically sex offenders--\nwere incapacitated for lengthy periods of time, it could have reduced their like-\nlihood of recidivism for all types of offending. Although the collection of such\ndata is difficult, it is important for future efforts to consider its potential\nimpact.\nIn the end, our modest effort showed that the prediction of adult sex offend-\ning from juvenile sex offending is very difficult, and more generally that the\nassumptions underpinning current registration and notification laws are fraught\nwith problems and should be re-considered. This prediction problem is even\ncompounded by the poor maintenance of sex offender registries and notifica-\ntion systems that have been noted in prior research (see Tewksbury, 2002)\nalong with the deleterious collateral consequences of sex offender registries\nincluding social stigmatization, loss of jobs, homes, and/or interpersonal rela-\ntionships, and harassment (Mustaine, Tewksbury, & Stengel, 2006; Tewksbury,\nare not inherently unique to sex offenders and typically apply to all felons\n(Tewksbury & Lees, 2006), recent research has indicated that some of these\nadverse outcomes may have a greater impact on sex offender reintegration--\nIt also appeared that juvenile sex offenders were relatively similar to juvenile\nnon-sex offenders, except with regards to the frequency of their criminal record.\nTherefore, perhaps both juvenile sex offenders and juvenile non-sex offenders\nmay benefit from the same legal interventions and treatment programs (see\nLetourneau & Miner, 2005). We are certainly not arguing that juvenile sex\noffending should be ignored. Yet, considering the growing evidence supporting\nthe lack of continuity of juvenile sex offending into adulthood, if these youth can\nbe treated without unduly stigmatizing them and requiring them to register as\nsex offenders, then perhaps the labeling process can be avoided and successful\nintervention can be achieved without disrupting the youth's relations with their\npeers and their natural social environment.\nAdditionally, most data sources that link juvenile and adult sex offending do\nnot have the necessary type and range of independent variables that mirror\nthose expressed in contemporary criminological theories. Therefore, future\nresearch in this area should seek to obtain the necessary information with\nrespect to key theoretical predictors that emerge from a range of criminological\nperspectives as this underdeveloped field of sex offender continuity moves\nforward. For example, insights drawn from cycle-of-violence theories (Widom,\n1989) as well as developmental/life-course criminology theories that pay close\nattention to the involvement of a small select group of offenders in crimes of\nviolence early, often, and throughout the life-course (Moffitt, 1993), seem like\nopportune avenues worth exploring. Ultimately, we hope that this study begins\na dialogue for more rational decision-making about juvenile sex offenders and\noffending, one that is based on a body of accumulated, empirical data.\nReferences\nAbel, G.
