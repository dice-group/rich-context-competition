An increased\nnumber of articles recently published attests to the fact that it is also gaining popularity in\nbehavioral brain research (e.g., Gerlai, 2010a, 2011; Sison, Cawker, Buske, and Gerlai,\n2006). Many of the papers published on the behavior of this species are motivated by the\nnotion that one may utilize this simple vertebrate as a tool with which the mechanisms of\ncomplex human diseases, including brain disorders, may be investigated. The main\nrationale is that research with zebrafish would be more cost effective than with humans or\nZebrafish fear\nwith any other vertebrate model organisms, including the rat or the house mouse. I and\nothers (Guo, 2004) have argued that zebrafish strike an optimal compromise between\nsystem complexity and practical simplicity (Gerlai, 2010a). Practical simplicity comes from\nsuch features of the zebrafish as its small size (4 cm long), prolific nature (a single female\ncan spawn 3-4 times a week, producing 200 eggs each time), and the fact that it is a highly\nsocial species (a shoaling fish that prefers and thus can be kept at high density) (Miller and\nGerlai, 2007; Saverino and Gerlai, 2008). On the other hand, the zebrafish is a complex\norganism. It is a vertebrate species with a typical vertebrate brain layout and vertebrate\nphysiology (e.g., Alsop and Vijayan, 2008; Chatterjee and Gerlai, 2009; Tropepe and Sive,\n2003). Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, if a zebrafish gene is identified as being\ninvolved in an important biological function, it is likely that a human homolog may be\ndiscovered that also serves a similar or related function (e.g., Reimers, Hahn, and Tanguay,\n2004; Renier et al., 2007). This is because the nucleotide sequence of zebrafish and human\ngenes has been found highly homologous, around 70% on average. Furthermore, nucleotide\nsequences corresponding to the functionally relevant binding regions of proteins often\nand references therein).\nAlthough our knowledge about the genetics and biology, including neurobiology, of\nzebrafish is rapidly increasing, the behavioral features of this species remain elusive or\nunderexplored at best (Gerlai, 2011; Sison et al., 2006). Perhaps one reason why it is often\ndifficult to investigate the behavior of a novel model organism such as zebrafish is that\neach species possesses idiosyncratic characteristics, and previous behavioral test paradigms\ndeveloped for other species cannot be readily adopted (Gerlai, 2001). Although some have\nstated that the best way to achieve generalization (i.e., translational relevance) is if one\nignores these species-specific characteristics, we (Gerlai, 2001, 2002; Gerlai and Clayton,\n1999) and others (Blanchard, Griebel, and Blanchard, 2003 and references therein), have\nargued the opposite. We think that in order to understand the biological and genetic\nmechanisms of certain complex features, such as behavior, one needs to know how the\nbehavior may be elicited, how it may manifest, and how it can be quantified under the\nconfines of the laboratory. These elements may be specific to the target species and may be\ndependent upon its evolutionary past and ecology. Our previous, seemingly trivial, example\nillustrates this point (Gerlai and Clayton, 1999). We argued that it is not useful to study, for\nexample, learning and motivation across multiple species by using the exact same methods.\nImagine how a rat would respond to a stack of 100 dollar bills and what a human subject\nwould think if offered a bowl of tasty rat chow as reward in a comparative learning study.\nOur argument was simple: The best way to analyze translationally relevant mechanisms is\nto design experiments in which the natural behavior of the subjects is utilized. Forcing the\nstudy species into artificial situations may lead to confusing result and may not allow one\nto tap into functionally homologous neural mechanisms (Gerlai, 2001).\nIt may be easy to see the above point, but it may not be so simple to put it into\npractice. How do we know which test is ethologically/ecologically appropriate? How do we\ndecide what is natural or what is artificial for our chosen study species? These questions are\nnot trivial to answer, a fact that is also demonstrated by the following review. In this review\nI discuss our own first attempts to investigate zebrafish fear responses (Gerlai, 2010b). Our\nZebrafish fear\nultimate goal is to develop behavioral test methods with which robust fear can be induced\nand in a reliable manner. Such paradigms then could be utilized in the analysis of the\nmechanisms of fear, for example, by searching for interesting mutants in a pool of ENU\nmutagenized zebarfish. Alternatively, such paradigms may, for example, be used in large\nscale drug screens for the identification of anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds.\nIn the following pages I review our own efforts with olfactory cues, live stimulus\nspecies, as well as animated images that are expected to induce fear responses in zebrafish.\nI discuss why we believe some of our methods may have ethological relevance and I also\ndiscuss the difficulties with this notion. But before I start this review, I first present a short\noverview on the relatively small amount of information known about the ecology and\nnatural habitat of zebrafish.\nZebrafish in Nature\nOnly very few studies have explored the natural habitat and ecology of zebrafish\nper se. These have been reviewed in two recent papers (Engeszer, Patterson, Rao, and\nParichy, 2007; Spence et al., 2006) that also significantly added to this topic by conducting\noriginal field studies. The zebrafish is a freshwater species that inhabits small lakes and\nponds, slow-moving streams, and rice paddies in a large geographic range that extends\nfrom Pakistan in the west to Myanmar (Burma) in the east, and from Nepal in the north to\nthe Indian state of Karnataka in the south. The abiotic characteristics of waters of this large\ngeographic region vary. Water temperature may range from 15 to 39 Co (including seasonal\nand daily temperature cycles), pH between 5\u00ad8.2 and conductivity between 10-300 \u00b5S.\nZebrafish may be found in clear or turbid water and waters with silt or gravel/rocky bottom.\nThe biotic environment of zebrafish contains a lot of shoaling species related to zebrafish\n(e.g., Danio and Devario), similar in body size and behavior to zebrafish. These fish may\ncompete with zebrafish for food or other resources, such as mating sites. Numerous\npredatory fish coinhabit the water with zebrafish too. For example, Channa (snakehead\nfish), Xenentodon (needle or garfish), Notopterus (knife fish), Mystus (catfish) species and\nzebrafish have been caught from the same habitats. Furthermore, the geographic\ndistribution of Nandus nandus (Indian leaf fish) also coincides with that of zebrafish. In\naddition to predatory fish, zebrafish may also be preyed upon by dragonfly larvae as well as\nfishing birds (Spence et al., 2006), including the Indian pond heron (Ardeola grayii) and\nthe common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis).\nSpence et al. (2006) recorded several features of the zebrafish habitat and conducted\na correlation analysis (Principal Component Analysis) to investigate whether certain\ncharacteristics correlate with the abundance of zebrafish. They found negative correlations\nbetween abundance of zebrafish and water depth, water flow, transparency, and the\npresence of predators, respectively, among other variables. Under semi-natural conditions,\nSpence et al. (2006) also investigated the vertical position of zebrafish and found this\nspecies to predominantly prefer the upper third water layer in an 84 cm deep tank, but also\nto spend some time in the bottom third layer, while mostly avoiding the middle part of the\ntank.\nReproductive behavior of zebrafish has not been observed in nature, but Engeszer et\nZebrafish fear\nal. (2007) cites a report stating that the breeding season of zebrafish is between April and\nAugust, which coincides with the monsoon season. However, Spence et al. (2006) argue\nthat zebrafish breed all year round, an assertion supported by finding females with mature\neggs even in January.\nThe food preference of zebrafish in nature has also been documented (McClure,\nMcIntyre, and McCune, 2006). The mouth of the zebrafish opens upward, which suggests\nthat this fish catches its food items from below. Usually, this anatomy is found in fish that\nfeed from the surface of the water. The gut of zebrafish has been found to contain mainly\ninsects, but crustaceans, fish scales, algae, and detritus were also identified. Analysis of the\ninsects revealed that their origin was primarily terrestrial and not aquatic (McClure et al.,\n2006), suggesting that the dominant mode of foraging for zebrafish indeed involves\ncatching insects that fall into the water.\nShoaling behavior of zebrafish has been reported (Engeszer et al., 2007; McClure et\nal., 2006; Spence et al., 2006) in nature, but quantitative analysis of shoal size or shoal\ncomposition has not been performed (Miller and Gerlai, 2011). Nevertheless, given that\nzebrafish coinhabits its habitat with other Danio species of similar size and body shape as\nzebrafish, it is possible that zebrafish forms mixed-species shoals, a speculation that is\nsupported by the results of empirical laboratory studies (Saverino and Gerlai, 2008).\nZebrafish in the Laboratory: Inducing Fear Responses with Olfactory Cues\nNumerous fish species have been found to respond to their alarm substance, an\nolfactory cue that is released from epidermal club cells when the fish's skin is damaged\n(e.g., for earlier reviews, see Pfeiffer, 1962; Solomon, 1977; for more recent discoveries,\nsee Brown, Adrian, Lewis, and Tower, 2002 and references therein; Brown, Adrian, and\nexception. It has also been found to show significant alarm reactions to its natural alarm\nsubstance (Hall and Suboski, 1995; Waldman, 1982). We have studied the effect of this\nsubstance too, which may be extracted by cutting the skin of freshly euthanized fish and\nwashing the cuts to collect the substance (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). Zebrafish respond to\nthe presence of this substance with a variety of behaviors, including erratic movement, a\ntypical zig-zag motion with rapidly changing and short bouts of linear and angular\nacceleration and deceleration episodes (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). Although this behavior\nhas not been observed in nature, in the test aquarium it usually occurs near or on the bottom\nof the tank and thus its function has been hypothesized to be the generation of turbulence\nand with it the stirring up of debris in waters with sediment rich substrates (Speedie and\nGerlai, 2008). This speculation is supported by the observation that erratic movement is\nalmost always followed by complete cessation of movement (i.e., immobility). Motionless\nprey under a cloud of debris may be hard for predators to detect (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008).\nIn addition to this behavior, the alarm substance was also found to induce changes in\nshoaling (increased shoal cohesion) as well as increased bottom dwell time (Speedie and\nGerlai, 2008). However, the issue with the alarm substance has been that fresh extraction\ndoes not allow one to ascertain the precise concentration of the active ingredient, at least\nnot across multiple experiments (within a particular experiment one can create a dilution\nZebrafish fear\nsequence and thus control at least the relative dose). Thus, even if the extraction protocol is\nprecisely followed, between-study error rate is expected to be high.\nThis issue was addressed by Parra, Adrian, and Gerlai (2009) who utilized a\nrecently developed synthetic alarm substance, Hypoxanthine-3-N-oxide or H3NO (see e.g.,\nBrown et al., 2001), and showed that this substance is also capable of producing strong fear\nresponses. Notably, the synthetic alarm substance has been found to induce alarm reactions\nin multiple species of fish (Brown et al., 2001; Brown, Adrian, Nabil, Mark, and Jocelyn,\ninduced alarm reactions are identical in severity and/or qualitative aspects to those induced\nby the natural alarm substance is controversial at this point. In our own studies (Speedie\nand Gerlai, 2008), we found the natural alarm substance to increase bottom dwell time,\nwith the strongest response elicited by an intermediate dose (i.e., we obtained an inverted U\nshaped dose response curve) in zebrafish. Waldman (1982) also reported that zebrafish\nmove close to the substrate of the tank in response to the skin extract he used. Furthermore,\nwe found the distance between shoal members to decrease after the administration of the\nnatural alarm substance, and the frequency and the duration of erratic movement episodes\nto increase in a linear dose-dependent manner (Speedie and Gerlai, 2008). H3NO, the\nsynthetic alarm substance, also induced increased erratic movement as well as elevated the\nfrequency of single jumps (also called leaping, dashing, or darting in other publications) in\nzebrafish (Parra et al., 2009). But interestingly, H3NO did not increase bottom dwell time.\nIn line with this finding, Mathuru et al. (2012) also found H3NO not to induce the full fear\nrepertoire of effects elicited by the skin extract of zebrafish. In this latter paper, the authors\nnot only performed a detailed analysis of the behavioral effects of skin extract but also\ninvestigated the different components of the extract as to their potential identity and\nphenotypical effects. They found that chondroitin, a glycosaminoglycan purified from the\nzebrafish skin extract, induced significant fear responses in zebrafish (Mathuru et al.,\n2012). It is also notable that there may be several other reasons why the effects of synthetic\nand natural (skin extracted) alarm substances may differ. There are numerous\nmethodological differences among the cited studies and there may also be significant\npopulation or strain differences among the zebrafish used in these papers. Also,\nimportantly, and as mentioned before, the exact dose of the skin extract is most often\nunknown. Thus, although a within-experiment dilution sequence may give one the ability to\nconduct a dose response analysis, such an analysis is useless across experiments unless the\nexact identity and concentration of the active ingredients of the skin extract solution are\nidentified. This is particularly problematic if one considers the found inverse U-shaped\ndose response profile of the skin extract.\nAlthough not without controversies, H3NO and most recently chondroitin have\nbeen identified as important alarm substances that induce robust alarm reactions in\nthat a range of species may respond to the same alarm substances. This lack of species-\nspecificity is not surprising. It is likely that natural selection has favored those individuals\nthat were not highly selective and responded to alarm substances of multiple prey species\n(Parra et al., 2009). After all, the ability of the prey to sense the presence of a dangerous\npredator should not depend upon what prey species the predator has just captured.\nZebrafish fear\nThe Sight of Predators as Fear Inducing Stimuli\nA common problem with all of the alarm substance studies has been that olfactory\ncues are highly difficult to work with. The onset and offset (particularly the latter) of their\nadministration is difficult to control precisely and may require labor-intensive and time-\nconsuming water changes and thorough cleaning of the experimental tank. Some olfactory\ncues, including the synthetic alarm substance H3NO, may not be very stable, may decay\nover time and lose their potency if not stored or handled properly (personal observation),\nand may also loose efficacy depending on water chemistry, particularly pH (Brown et al.,\n2002). For these reasons, we have decided to explore alternative ways of inducing fear in\nzebrafish. Zebrafish is a diurnal species which has excellent vision. The zebrafish visual\nsystem is tetrachromatic (e.g., Connaughton and Nelson, 2010). This fish has four different\ncones that are sensitive to particular wave-lengths of light. Zebrafish may use it to detect\nthe presence of mates, competitors, food items, as well as predators. Indeed, we have been\nable to induce robust fear responses by exposing zebrafish to live predatory fish (Bass and\nGerlai, 2008). Zebrafish responded strongly irrespective of whether the predator was in the\nsame tank as the test subject or if it was outside of it, as long as the test subject could see\nthe predator (Bass and Gerlai, 2008). The responses of zebrafish included moving away\nfrom the location where the predator was shown, as well as increased number of erratic\nmovement episodes and leaping (a single acceleration bout achieved by the use of the\ncaudal fin). In addition, zebrafish also distinguished predatory and harmless fish species as\nthey responded with increased shoal cohesion (smaller inter-individual distance within the\nshoal) only to predatory, but not to harmless, fish species shown.\nAn interesting aspect of these findings was that the two predatory species used (the\nIndian leaf fish, Nandus nandus and the Compressed African cichlid, Dimidochromis\ncompressiceps) induced different behavioral responses (Bass and Gerlai, 2008).\nPresentation of the leaf fish led to increased erratic movement and leaping frequency,\nwhereas the African cichlid was mainly ineffective. This difference was observed despite\nthe fact that the African cichlid performed a significantly higher frequency of predatory\nattacks. Given that the experimental zebrafish used in these studies were bred and raised in\nthe laboratory and had never been exposed to predators of any kind, we concluded that\nzebrafish possess genetic predispositions that allow them to respond to aversive cues\nwithout any prior exposure to such cues. That is, the possibility of zebrafish being able to\ninnately recognize its natural (sympatric) predator was raised (Bass and Gerlai, 2008).\nMost recently, however, this notion was put under scrutiny (Ahmed, Fernandes, and\nGerlai, 2012). The issue with the previous study that demonstrated the differential effect of\nthe sympatric leaf fish vs. the allopatric compressed cichlid was that only one sympatric\nand one allopatric predator was compared; i.e., the results may have been idiosyncratic to\nthe pair of predatory stimulus fish used. It is possible that other sympatric predators may\nnot induce strong antipredatory reactions or, alternatively, allopatric predators other than\nthe compressed cichlid do. We have started to address this question by exposing zebrafish\nto animated images of a series of sympatric predators (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai,\nOur results partially confirmed that zebrafish are capable of responding to fear\nZebrafish fear\ninducing stimuli without any prior exposure to such stimuli. But the answer to the question\nof whether zebrafish are able to recognize their natural (sympatric) predators was further\ncomplicated by our results. This is what we found: Four sympatric predator species, the\nIndian leaf fish (Nandus nandus), the blotched snakehead fish (Channa maculata), a catfish\n(Mystus bleekeri), and the clown knife fish Chitala chitala) were found to be highly\neffective. In fact, the knife fish and the catfish appeared even more effective in inducing the\nfear responses than the leaf fish was. Interestingly, the fifth predator, the freshwater needle\nfish (Xenentodon cancila), whose image we used, did not induce the expected fear\nresponses and in fact, instead of an avoidance reaction, it elicited approach from zebrafish.\nThis was quite surprising to us as this predator species has been repeatedly identified as one\nthat inhabits the same waters as zebrafish, and it is also known to be a dedicated piscivore\n(Engeszer et al., 2007; Spence et al., 2006). Also notably, the size of the image of the\nneedle fish we used was large enough for a live individual to be able to capture and eat a\nfully grown adult zebrafish. Furthermore, in another independent study, we also found the\nneedle fish to be ineffective in inducing fear reactions in zebrafish (Luca and Gerlai, 2011).\nWe speculated that perhaps the manner in which the image of the needle fish was presented\ndid not mimic the natural behavior of this predator and that may have been the reason why\nzebrafish explored this stimulus rather than avoiding it. For example, we utilized a standard\npresentation method that included making the image of the given predator move with a set\nspeed of 0.3 cm/sec. Also, the images moved across the entire surface area of the side wall\nof the test tank; i.e., they were not localized to any particular layer of the tank. The\nadvantage of this computer animation was that it allowed us to present the stimuli in a\nconsistent manner across all types of stimuli and sessions. The disadvantage may have\nbeen, however, that particular predators may exhibit different motor patterns or may\noccupy different layers in the water column in nature. For example, while the knife fish,\nleaf fish, and the snakehead fish are ambush predators and are expected to stay in position\nor move only slowly until the predatory strike, the needle fish is a fast moving and actively\nhunting predator (Gerlai, personal observation; also see Foster, 1973). Also, the knife fish\nand the leaf fish tend to be either on the bottom or the mid layers of the water column\nwhereas the needlefish is usually found near the water surface. In summary, it is likely that\nthe needlefish was presented in an artificial manner that did not recapitulate the natural\nbehavior of this piscivore.\nThis latter speculation brings up an important point. We know practically nothing\nabout what makes a predator a predator for zebrafish. We do not know what stimuli\nzebrafish may be sensitive to and how certain stimuli define danger for zebrafish. Such\nstimuli may include the color and pattern, the size and body proportions, and/or the motor\npatterns of the stimulus fish or any combination of such features. In fact, it is possible that\nzebrafish may not need to be presented with a realistic image of a sympatric predator in\norder to respond to the stimulus with a full-fledged fear reaction, a possibility that is now\nsupported by empirical findings (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012).\nIn this latter study, zebrafish were presented with abstract shapes in a manner\nidentical to how the images of sympatric predators were shown. Interestingly, one of the\nshapes, a rectangle whose speed of movement, size, \"body proportions\" (12 x 3.8 cm,\nlength x height) and color (light greenish brown) were similar to corresponding features of\nZebrafish fear\nthe presented predator images, induced fear responses that were statistically\nindistinguishable from those induced by the most effective sympatric predator images (e.g.,\nthat of the knife fish, catfish, snakehead fish, and leaf fish). That is, although similar in\nsome characteristics to the images, the otherwise featureless (no pattern, no eyes, no mouth,\nno fins) \"predator,\" the slowly moving greenish-brown rectangle, was just as effective as\nthe images of real piscivores. Based on this finding, one could argue that any object of a\ncertain size moving in a certain speed may induce the fear responses in zebrafish. However,\nwe have evidence that this is not true (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012). Another\ngeometric shape (a flattened star), whose size, speed, color, and overall proportions were\nall identical to those of the rectangle, was completely ineffective as it induced no fear\nreactions in zebrafish (Ahmed, Fernandes, and Gerlai, 2012). In summary, the above\nfindings clearly demonstrate our lack of understanding of what stimuli and in what\ncombination define a predator for zebrafish. Systematic dissection of features of predators\nwill need to be conducted. These studies are now quite feasible with the use of computer\nanimation software. It is clear, however, that realistic images of sympatric predators are not\nnecessary for the induction of fear responses in zebrafish.\nThis notion is also supported by another study in which we presented computer\nanimated objects, including an expanding dot and the silhouette of a bird of prey, to\nzebrafish and measured the fear reactions of the experimental zebrafish (Luca and Gerlai,\n2011). The main goal of this study was to explore whether the location of presentation of\nthese stimuli matters and whether the fear responses are uniform or idiosyncratic to the\ncontext in which they are induced. The results indicated that the expanding dot induced a\nstrong fear response, especially when presented from above. We speculated that this\nstimulus may resemble a rapidly approaching aerial predator (birds pull their wings close to\ntheir body when striking with a dive from above and thus may appear cylindrical when\nviewed head-on). Importantly, the very same stimulus (expanding dot) when presented on\nthe side induced much less robust reactions as compared to when it was shown from above,\nbut it still did lead to avoidance of the location of the stimulus (Luca and Gerlai, 2011).\nSurprisingly, the bird silhouette was effective both when shown from above and from the\nside (Luca and Gerlai, 2011). It led to significant reduction of distance swum and increased\nthe number of erratic movement episodes. But in other behaviors the side versus top\npresentation of this stimulus induced different responses. When shown on the side the bird\nsilhouette increased the number of leaps (called jumps in that paper), but such change was\nnot observed when the stimulus was shown from the top. The percent of time the fish\nremained completely immobile was affected the opposite way by the different location of\nstimulus presentation. When shown from the top the bird silhouette increased immobility,\nbut when shown from the side it decreased it. Similarly, when shown from the top the\nstimulus increased bottom dwell time, but when shown from the side it decreased it.\nTaken together, these findings and the ones obtained in a series of experiments with\ndifferent predator images and other abstract shapes suggest that zebrafish have a complex\nantipredatory repertoire, and how this species responds to a particular aversive stimulus is\ndependent upon both the type and the location of the stimulus. It is thus likely that one\nneeds to measure a range of behaviors to capture the changes in fear response induced by,\nfor example, a mutation, a novel drug, or the particular aversive stimulus employed. This\nZebrafish fear\nbrings us to the next question: How can one quantify these responses and detect changes in\nfear-related reactions?\nQuantification of Fear Responses\nQuantification of behavior in general is a whole scientific field to itself (Martin and\nBateson, 1993; also see Gerlai, 2002). Here, I will focus on two principally different\nmethods: observation based and video-tracking based applications as they pertain to the\nanalysis of zebrafish behavior (Blaser and Gerlai, 2006). Each has its own merits and\ndisadvantages. Observation-based behavioral quantification is time-consuming and labor-\nintensive (e.g., Gerlai, Crusio, and Cs\u00e1nyi, 1990). The observer needs to view the animals\nperforming in the task and needs to identify the behaviors, record the amount of time for\nwhich the behavior occurred, and/or record the number of occurrences of the behavior. The\nadvantage of this approach is that even with sophisticated computer technologies of the 21st\ncentury, the human brain is still perhaps the best pattern detection device and thus\nobservation-based approaches allow the experimenter to quantify often rather complex\nmotor and posture patterns that would escape detection by automated techniques such as\nvideo-tracking (Gerlai, 2002). In the case of fear, one of the most typical responses to a\nvariety of fear-inducing stimuli has been erratic movement or zig-zagging (e.g., Gerlai,\nfear reaction is difficult to capture with video-tracking (but see Gerlai, Fernandes, and\nPereira, 2009). Another behavior that is similarly problematic to quantify using video-\ntracking is leaping (or jumping). It is also notable that in response to novel treatments\n(drugs, induced mutations, or other new experimental manipulations) one may see\nunexpected or previously undescribed motor and posture patterns that would remain\nundetectable if one used traditional video-tracking parameters (see below). Thus, it is\nrecommended that analysis of the effects of such novel treatments start with observation-\nbased methods (e.g., Gerlai and Clayton, 1999). It is also notable that, unlike common\nwisdom, observation-based quantification methods do have high inter- and intra-rater\nreproducibility, and if the studies are conducted blind and experimental design includes\nproper randomization, then experimenter bias is also not a problem. Furthermore,\nnowadays the experimenter using observation-based methods does not have to rely on\nhis/her stopwatch. These approaches move beyond the old-fashioned paper-pencil method\nand now employ sophisticated software aids, applications that turn the computer into a\npractically limitless number of stopwatches that can allow one to measure both mutually\nexclusive and overlapping behaviors of multiple subjects (players) at the same time.\nThe alternative to observation-based methods is, for example, the automated\ncomputerized video-tracking, which has also been successfully employed in the analysis of\nzebrafish behavior (Blaser and Gerlai, 2006). This method allows one to record the xy (or\nin more advanced cases the xyz 3D) coordinates of the location of the target subject(s) in\nhigh temporal resolution (e.g., 10-40 video-frames per second). From these coordinates,\none can extract a large number of important behavioral measures, including exact location\nof the fish, the distance of the fish from a predetermined area, line or point, total distance\nmoved, speed, turn angle, and several other characteristics of the movement (swim) path of\nZebrafish fear\nthe subject. The main advantage of this approach is that it is highly quantitative. A human\nobserver may be able to distinguish fast swim speed from slow, but he/she will definitely\nnot be able to precisely measure how much or how fast the subject was moving. Similarly,\nalthough one can record how much time the test subject spent in the bottom third of the\ntank, for example, the exact distance from the bottom can only be quantified using the\nvideo-tracking software. This is an important drawback of observation-based methods, as\nquantitative (e.g., exact distance measures) variables tend to offer better statistical power\nand less error variation compared to discrete variables (e.g., variables that depend upon\nthresholds or categories). Another major advantage of video-tracking is that it does not\nrequire the presence of the observer. One can video-tape the behavioral sessions of multiple\nsubjects in a large number of experimental set-ups and quantify the behavioral responses in\nparallel. The ability to scale up behavioral research this way allows the experimenter to\nutilize video-tracking in high throughput screening applications, the major promise of\nzebrafish research (Gerlai, 2010a and references therein; Grunwald and Eisen, 2003). It\nmay even be possible to capture some aspects of complex motor patterns using video-\ntracking. For example, we have found that erratic movement significantly correlates with\nwithin-individual temporal variance of speed (because erratic movement is associated with\nepisodes of very fast and very slow swim bouts) as well as turn angle (because this\nbehavior is associated with a series of quick direction changes), and with the within-\nindividual temporal variance of turn angle (Gerlai et al., 2009), parameters that standard\nvideo-tracking software applications routinely extract. Furthermore, one can easily see how\ncombining certain classical video-tracking parameters and setting up certain filters (criteria)\nmay allow one to define more complex behavioral variables. For example, leaping\n(jumping) may be defined by swim speed reaching a minimum threshold (e.g., 5 cm/sec)\nand at the same time bout length not exceeding an upper limit (e.g., 2 sec). In summary,\nalthough observation-based methods are recommended at the early discovery/development\nphase of the research study, video-tracking applications may provide sufficient\nsophistication and are crucial in later, high-throughput phases of fear research. Last, it is\nalso recommended that once an interesting effect (or a mutation or a compound) is\nidentified as having fear altering aspects, one can (and should) go back and observe the\nbehavior of the subject to make sure the automated method is correct and did not miss some\nimportant changes.\nAnalysis of Fear Responses in Larval or Developing Zebrafish\nIn this review I deliberately focused on studies conducted in my own laboratory.\nThese studies have been developed for the analysis of the behavior of adult zebrafish.\nFocusing on the adults, I believe, is important because at this developmental stage one does\nnot expect robust age-dependent (i.e., ontogenetic) changes for several months of the\nsubjects' lives. That is, after reaching sexual maturity at the age of 3 months, zebrafish\nremain healthy and reproductively active until about 3 years of age without showing clear\nsigns of aging. This stable period allows one to study time-dependent effects of many\nmanipulations, including repeated environmental stimulus exposure-induced effects or drug\nor chemical exposure episodes. Such repeated exposure/stimulation effects would be\nZebrafish fear\ndifficult to disentangle in the rapidly developing embryo or larval fish. Nevertheless,\nanalysis of embryonic development or the larval stage of zebrafish has been the focus of\nthe majority of studies conducted with this species. The behavioral characterization of the\nlarval zebrafish is also important. Specifically, fear responses in the larval zebrafish have\nbeen analyzed. Here I only mention a couple of examples for such analyses. Bianco,\nKampff, and Engert (2011) analyzed the effect of moving objects (a circular spot presented\non a screen using an LCD projector) on 6-7 post-fertilization day old zebrafish (freely\nswimming stage starts at 5 days post-fertilization). These authors found that when the spot\nwas small, it elicited a prey capture-like response, orientation with the body, and fixation\n(eye convergence) by the eyes, but when the stimulus was large it induced a significant\navoidance reaction. Richendrfer, Pelkowski, Colwill, and Creton (2012) recently published\na paper in which a simple and cheap larval zebrafish apparatus and assay for the analysis of\nfear responses is described. In this paradigm the zebrafish (again, only a few day old freely\nmoving larval zebrafish) are presented with large moving circular objects on a computer\nscreen placed underneath the arenas (wells) in which the subject(s) is/are swimming. The\nauthors showed a significant avoidance reaction induced by the \"bouncing ball\" and argued\nthat their paradigm allows high throughput screening of anxiolytic and anxiogenic\ncompounds at this early developmental stage, an important development in the field given\nthe short time required for the generation of hundreds of larval zebrafish.\nConcluding Remarks\nFrom a translational perspective, zebrafish may be important in the analysis of fear\nfor two main reasons. First, as a practically more feasible study species it may allow one to\ndiscover important genetic and other biological mechanisms associated with fear faster and\nwith better efficiency than one could achieve with other laboratory vertebrates or with our\nown species. Given the evolutionary conservation found at several levels of the biological\norganization between this fish and humans (from nucleotide sequence, homologies between\ngenes of the two species, physiological and anatomical similarities of these species, to\nfunctional similarities of their brains, and the behavioral manifestation of these functions),\none can be hopeful that the zebrafish will offer good translational relevance. Second, even\nif the zebrafish may not always be superior from a research perspective as compared to\nother model organisms, its analysis adds important knowledge as to how the vertebrate\nbrain functions. Information about mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, such as fear\nresponses, obtained from multiple species allows one to compare the results. Such a\ncomparative approach may allow one to find common features among the studied\norganisms. It is these commonalities that should truly allow good translation to humans, as\nit is likely that they represent perhaps the most important evolutionarily conserved features.\nFinding such features, I believe, may be best achieved if one keeps the species-specific\ncharacteristics of the study organism in mind; i.e., if one considers information about the\nnatural history and ecology of the study species in the design of experiments and in the\ninterpretation of their results.\nIn this review I mainly focused on our own efforts and discussed some points about\nthe behavioral analysis of fear responses in zebrafish. Clearly, our studies demonstrate that\nZebrafish fear\nmuch needs to be done before one can really understand how to induce and measure fear\nreactions in this novel study species. Nevertheless, we, together with many other\nresearchers (e.g., Blaser, Chadwick, and McGinnis, 2010; Colwill and Creton, 2011;\nAgetsuma, and Aizawa, 2012; Stensmyr and Maderspacher, 2012), have already collected\nenough evidence that demonstrates that zebrafish will be an important tool with which the\nmechanisms of vertebrate fear is studied.\n"
