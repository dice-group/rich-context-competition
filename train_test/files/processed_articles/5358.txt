The pursuit of quality serves as justification for multiple reform\ninitiatives, and quality assurance has become a primary responsibility of the state in edu-\ncation. At the same time, the concept of quality itself is relative, linked to current educa-\nNational interpretations of quality are grounded primarily in historical trends, current\nnational legislative frameworks, curricular content and specific national issues responding\nto local needs and problems, as well as being influenced by the quality frameworks of\ntransnational organizations (Alexander, 2008). Investigation of the interpretations of edu-\ncational quality in a certain context is a way to learn about the priorities and problems\nidentified in education in that setting.\nChanges in the interpretations of quality and ideas on how to ensure quality reflect more\nextensive changes in education governance. Scholars have proposed various theoretical\nmodels of governance to highlight the roles that policies concerning quality can play in\nthe regulation of educational institutions. For example, Neave (1988, 1998) draws attention\nto the `cultivation of quality' in higher education, and contrasts the `state control' mode of\nregulation where evaluation of quality was reduced to administrative verification with the\nnewer `evaluative state' mode where evaluation functions as a steering instrument to mobi-\nlize universities to pursue self-improvement. Other researchers explore the mechanisms\nthrough which Quality Assurance and Evaluation (QAE), as a complex of policies for\nensuring quality and accountability in education, enables continuous data production and\nconstant comparison nationally and transnationally (see, e.g., Grek et al., 2009; Ozga, 2009;\nand other work by these authors). These scholars claim that QAE instruments create new\nforms of governance on both the macro- and micro-level, changing the political space in\nEurope and promoting the self-regulation of educational institutions. Maroy (2008) speaks\nabout `bureaucratic-professional' and `post-bureaucratic' models of state governance, which\ndiffer in the ways they define and assure education quality.\nWhile taking these theoretical models into account, in this article I assume a critical\nstance and aim to problematize the perception that distinct and entirely different governance\nmodels exist as historical realities, and that by implementing certain QAE instruments the\nstate necessarily changes the mode of governance. I intend to highlight complexities, contra-\ndictions and continuities within and between previous and current regimes of education\ngovernance in Russia. This analysis is guided by two main research questions: 1) What\nhas changed and what has remained unchanged in Russian school education policy with\nthe transition from the Soviet period to the present state? and 2) How do different legacies\nand influences contribute to the QAE policy implemented at the local level? To answer these\nquestions, I start with a brief inquiry into the history of QAE policy in Russia, and then\nproceed to analyse the conceptualizations of quality and the accounts of quality assurance\npractices in schools in a particular locality in present-day Russia. For the local-level anal-\nysis, I use more specific questions which are presented later in the article.\nAs a point of departure for the analysis of Russian QAE policy I take the `regimes of\ngovernance' proposed by Maroy (2008), since they focus on the national-level policy in\nschool education. In the `bureaucratic-professional' regime the state assumes the main\nresponsibility as guarantor of education quality, and aims at ensuring it by issuing rules\nand norms for all elements of the education system and controlling compliance with these.\nInspections and audits function as primary quality assurance instruments. At the same time,\nin the bureaucratic-professional model, teachers exercise a certain autonomy, as their com-\npetencies and careers are regulated primarily through professional unions (Maroy, 2008:\n15\u00ad18). This is contrasted with `post-bureaucratic' regimes of governance: the evaluative\nstate model in which the state sets standards and then ensures compliance with them\nthrough evaluation, and the market model, to which competition and school choice are\ncentral (Maroy, 2008: 24). These more recent governance regimes are also conceptualized as\nnew public management (NPM) (Hood, 1991). NPM principles in education governance\nimply that responsibility for the quality of outcomes is shifted to local `service providers'\n(schools and teachers) that are guided by state standards, and instruments based on com-\nparison, such as `best practices' and rankings. The state motivates education providers to\nimprove quality through quasi-market mechanisms, introducing per capita funding that\nempowers `consumer' choice and fosters competition between schools. In this model, it is\ncrucial that `consumers' have information on the quality of the `providers', which is accom-\nplished by introducing external evaluation of schools' quality and publicizing the results.\nAnother NPM mechanism of guaranteeing the quality of education is by introducing\nperformance-based funding and salaries for educational service providers, for which `objec-\ntive' evaluation of the quality of outcomes by the state is also essential.\nThese theoretical models offer important insights into the functions of QAE in education\ngovernance. However, research that utilizes these models often creates images of clear-cut\ndistinctions between `old' and `new' governance regimes. Some authors infer that NPM-istic\nshifts in governance signify the adoption of `global scripts' (Meyer and Ramirez, 2000) or\nthe imposition of neo-liberal mechanisms by external forces (e.g. Arnove, 2009). Seeking to\ndevelop a more complex understanding of the evolution of QAE policy in Russia, I draw\ninspiration from other studies of socialist and post-socialist contexts that argue against\ndrawing a clear boundary between socialism and neo-liberalism, or viewing the post-\nsocialist condition as a process of gradual but inevitable convergence with `Western' and\n`global'. Iveta Silova (2010) claims that `the state of incompleteness and uncertainty is a key\nto understanding the post-socialist condition' (Silova, 2010: 10), and this quality of post-\nsocialism makes it particularly suitable for studies of divergence and difference within glob-\nalization processes. In a corresponding example of research, the study of performance audits\nin China, Andrew Kipnis (2008) demonstrates that familiar `neo-liberal' practices of per-\nformance assessment and management in China draw on different ideological roots than\nthose in the West. He further argues that `the global rise of audit cultures needs to be\nunderstood in a broad, anthropological, comparative framework, not one narrowly con-\ncerned with a critique of ideas that diffuse from the West' (Kipnis, 2008: 286). Kipnis calls\nfor detailed studies of local practices and contexts as particularly suitable for problematizing\npaper positions itself within this body of research.\nThe development of Russian QAE policy\nTo make sense of the current Russian QAE policy in terms of its legacies we need to cast a\nglance at the education policy in Russia in the periods that are commonly viewed as having\ncardinal differences from one another: post-war Soviet Russia; the transition period starting\nfrom perestroika in the 1980s to the end of Boris Yeltsin's presidential term in 1999; and\npresent-day Russia. This section aims to highlight the differences between the education\npolicy of these periods, their core values and principles, but at the same time to demonstrate\nthe complexity and continuities within and between these historical phases, acknowledging\nthe partially artificial nature of such temporal divisions.\nSoviet quality assurance: state provision and ideological control\nEducation played a key role in the Soviet state's aspiration to build a society of egalitari-\nanism and solidarity. Schools were to raise future citizens in the spirit of discipline and\ncollectivity, and to provide them in an equitable way with knowledge, skills and the ideology\nnecessary for their future contribution to the socialist economy and to the political project of\ncommunism. The `Stalin school model' developed in the 1930s was characterized by colossal\namounts of information students needed to digest, rigid discipline, ideological indoctrina-\ntion and compulsory community service for students (Mayofis, 2015: 39). The state not only\nguaranteed the right to a free education and assumed the ultimate responsibility for educa-\ntion quality, but also sought to enforce this right and demanded that citizens make good use\nof the free education to develop themselves into efficient members of socialist society\n(Livschiz, 2006: 559). Every student had the obligation to study to the peak of his or her\nabilities, and was overseen by school workers and by the student organizations in which\nevery student was enrolled from the first grade and the local organs of the Communist Party\nthat had influence over parents at their workplaces. With student learning secured through\nthese means, the focus of the state throughout the Soviet period was on training teachers,\nproviding schools with sufficient inputs and developing curricular content in accordance\nThe QAE policy that existed, with minor modifications, until the end of the Soviet period\nquality of education in schools' introduced a five-tier grading system, examinations and\nsymbolic rewards for outstanding results in studies (`silver' and `gold' medals to school\ngraduates). Until the changes in QAE policy in the 2000s, the grades of students and\nindicators tied to them, such as percentages of students successfully transitioning to the\nnext school year or numbers of graduates awarded with medals, served as the main measures\nof quality (see, e.g., Bakker, 1999: 296). In order to ensure that this numerical data reflected\nthe actual achievement of students, the decrees as well as official rhetorical texts of the 1940s\nprohibited the evaluation of school or teacher quality based on their students' grading,\nabolished the practice of socialist competition in education and condemned `formalistic'\ngrading that did not reflect the students' actual knowledge (Mayofis, 2015: 40\u00ad41). Regular\ninspections in schools controlled teachers `objectivity' in the way they assigned marks:\nThe mark . . . should reflect the true knowledge of students. When fighting the poor progress of\nstudents, one should not follow the path of lowering standards, as some teachers tend to do.\nOnly through raising standards can the quality of knowledge be improved. (From an article in\nInspections, school reports and statistics represented the main quality control instruments\nduring the Soviet period.\nDespite the carefully sustained appearance of state control over every aspect of school life\nand constant progress and improvement of quality, Soviet education faced many challenges,\nand education policy addressed them in internally controversial ways (Byford and Jones,\n2006). The post-war school worked under conditions of economic and social devastation,\nand state statistics registered massive dropouts and repetitions of study years (Livschiz,\n2006; Mayofis, 2015). While the state lacked sufficient resources for intervention, the\nresponsibility for these poor results was shifted to teachers, who were accused of `formal-\nistic' attitudes to teaching and of lacking the necessary pedagogical skills (Mayofis, 2015:\n61\u00ad64). The development of this discourse made it possible to criticize the inflexibility and\nover-bureaucratization of the school system, and to call for an individualized, student-\ncentred approach in teaching \u00ad amid a system built upon the principles of collectivism.\nThe individualized approach as a pedagogy was promoted by collecting and studying the\n`experience of the best teachers' (Mayofis, 2015). The fight against `formalistic attitudes' also\nincluded a critique of rote learning and a requirement to teach students to apply knowledge\nto practical tasks, which was probably necessitated by the new demands of the Soviet\neconomy and the military (Mayofis, 2015: 42\u00ad43). To alleviate the shortage of resources\nin schools, and to regulate access to higher education, tuition fees for grades 8\u00ad10 were in\nplace from 1940 to 1956, despite the obvious contradiction of this with the proclaimed\nprinciple of free education for all. The size of the tuition fee constrained access to education\nfor poorer families in cities, and almost completely restricted it in rural areas where residents\nreceived no monetary salaries (Korableva, 2009). The research on Soviet education indicates\nthat structural inequalities in the provision of resources to schools were not random but\nconsistent, and contributed to the reproduction of social boundaries and the existence of\nelites in the avowedly egalitarian Soviet society (Byford and Jones, 2006). These contra-\ndictions and the internal diversity enabled by them (see Kukulin et al., 2015) paved the way\nfor transformations in Soviet education in later periods and a gradual partial convergence of\nRussian education policy with global trends. A student-centred, individualized approach to\nteaching inspired the development of `innovative pedagogies' and enabled the `democrati-\nzation and humanization' of education discussed in the next section.\nTransition: customized quality in autonomous schools\nIn the 1980s, ideas about the tasks of the Soviet school system were greatly influenced by the\npolitical demands of perestroika and glasnost, which called for more freedom and truth in\neducation as well as in other spheres of social and political life. Two collective actors played\nleading roles in introducing changes into education. One was the `innovative teachers'\n(pedagogi-novatory) who advocated new teaching methods based on attention to the indi-\nvidual abilities and interests of students and evoking the creativity of teachers and students\nalike. Some of the most influential `innovators' (e.g. Daniil Elkonin, Vasily Davydov,\nLeonid Zankov) were inspired by Lev Vygotsky's theories of psychological development,\nwhich had been officially rejected since the 1930s. The methodology and teaching materials\nof the `innovators' were disseminated through highly popular courses and seminars\n(Eidelman, 2007). The other agent of change was the Temporary Scientific Research\nCollective on Schools (VNIK) `Bazovaia shkola' within the Academy of Pedagogical\nSciences \u00ad a group of pedagogues who sought to implement a cardinal reform of Soviet\neducation. The principles of the reform promulgated by this group included democratiza-\ntion, humanization, differentiation, openness, continuity and a developmental orientation of\neducation. The leader of VNIK, Eduard Dneprov, became the first minister of education of\npost-Soviet Russia, and together with many of his colleagues from VNIK he developed the\nnew educational legislation based upon the aforementioned principles (Eidelman, 2007;\nThe first decade of the post-Soviet period brought radical changes to education, which\ncan be attributed to internal calls for change and a new vision of the mission of education,\nbut also to the conditions of economic crisis and the severe underfunding of schools.\nEducational governance was decentralized, which meant that particular administrative\nand fiscal responsibilities were shifted to regional and local authorities, school-level man-\nagement was granted more autonomy and schools gained more freedom to create their own\ncurricula. The transition to a market economy enabled the reinterpretation of education as a\nservice and led to the partial privatization and commercialization of the school sector. At\nthe same time, schooling was reinterpreted as a communal enterprise that should involve\nstudents and parents, and serve the interests of civil society at large (Long and Long, 1999;\nThe QAE policy was not specifically reformed in that period, but the concepts of edu-\ncation quality and quality evaluation practices in schools were influenced by the ongoing\nchanges. New books on pedagogical management suggested that to ensure good manage-\nment of a school its administration should define the desired educational outcomes on the\nbasis of the identified needs and expectations of this school's customers (students, families,\nlocal community, society and the economy at large), and obtain information on whether\nthese outcomes were achievable. Quality was reconceptualized as individually tailored and\nto be captured through descriptive rather than numerical indicators (Gurova et al., 2015).\nEvaluation of quality was understood primarily as self-assessment at the level of schools,\nteachers and students for immediate feedback and improvement. There was also a renewed\ninterest in testing techniques. This interest was connected, on the one hand, to the rehabil-\nitation of the Russian psychologists of childhood and psychometricians who were banned by\nthe early Soviet leadership in the 1930s; and, on the other hand, by the new possibilities for\nthe collection and processing of assessment data afforded by the development of informa-\ntion technologies (Piattoeva and Gurova, 2018).\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) and philanthropic foundations started working in\nRussia in the 1990s, and they recommended the reorganization of the QAE system in\nRussian education. They regarded the lack of standardized achievement testing that\nwould provide commensurable statistics to the national level as a clear absence of monitor-\ning and quality assurance policy (World Bank, 1995). At the same time, they praised the\nalready ongoing reform efforts in Russian education policy as a whole, and attested to\nreformers' intentions in the following terms: `These plans are all in the right direction and\ngenerally reflect where the priorities should be' (World Bank, 1995: xiii).\nInternational actors offered three major sets of recommendations: 1) to introduce exter-\nnal quality evaluation mechanisms, primarily a standardized testing of learning achieve-\nment; 2) to involve diverse educational stakeholders in the quality assurance process; and 3)\nto develop new nation-wide education quality standards (Canning et al., 1999; OECD, 1998,\n2007). In the 1990s, Russia also started to participate in international large-scale assessments\nof educational achievement. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study\n(TIMSS) was undertaken in 1995 and 1999, and the Progress in International Reading\nLiteracy Study (PIRLS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)\nwere added in the 2000s. These studies were of particular interest to Russian researchers\nof education because of their methodological aspects. Russian scholars were eager to learn\nfrom participation in such studies in terms of both testing techniques and the sociological\nanalysis of educational achievement (Gurova et al., 2015). While the results of Russian\nstudents in TIMSS and PIRLS were quite high, this was not the case in PISA. Low PISA\nscores gave rise to public and academic discussions about the underlying causes of this\n`unsatisfactory' performance and contributed to the intention to develop self-made, national\ninstruments for measuring learning achievement.\nAll these changes prepared the ground for a major reform of Russian QAE policy in\neducation in the 2000s. It is important to bear in mind that it was a complex of internal and\nexternal influences that produced this reform, and to attribute it solely to the work of\ntransnational organizations or to the will of particular personalities within the Ministry\nof Education would be an oversimplification.\nQAE in modern Russia: a comprehensive system resembling global trends\nThe differentiation unleashed in education and the economic crisis of the 1990s led to a\nrapid increase in educational inequalities that both resulted from and enhanced the overall\nsocial inequality (Kosaretsky et al., 2014). To remedy the negative effects of the radical\ndecentralization of the 1990s and to ensure compliance with state requirements, the Ministry\nof Education developed `state standards' for every level of education, and implemented\nprocedures for the licencing, attestation and accreditation of educational institutions\n(Filippov, 2000). Alongside these input-based procedures, the outcome-based quality assur-\nance tool of the national school-leaving examination (the Unified State Exam (USE) or\nGIA-11) was introduced in 2001. Its main goals were claimed to be greater equality through\nfacilitating all school-leavers' access to higher education, and making the quality of school\neducation greater, even across the country. By fostering compliance with the official school\ncurricula, the USE facilitated the re-centralization of school education governance\n(Piattoeva, 2015). Another strong argument in favour of the USE concerned its role in\nproducing `impartial' and informed evidence for policy. As Tyumeneva (2013: xi) explains,\ngiven that there was no national large-scale assessment programme for `[s]ystem monitoring\nand accountability purposes, the USE has ended up being used to fill this gap', despite the\nfact that it was not initially designed to yield this kind of information. Having a system of\nstandardized tests that also produces statistics on education quality was perceived, symbol-\nically and practically, as a means of bringing Russia closer to `modern' means of regulation.\nSimultaneously with these discussions, the State Program for Education Development in\n2013\u00ad2020 outlined a comprehensive system of education evaluation and quality control,\ncomprising the regulation by the state of education activities, assessment of education\nachievement (GIA-9 and GIA-11, national examinations after grades 9 and 11, that can\nutilize different assessment techniques), procedures for independent quality evaluation and\nthe participation of Russia in international studies (Government of Russia, 2012: 218).\nCurrently, scores in national examinations serve as primary indicators of education quality\nin national and regional policy documents on quality assurance, school rankings and teacher\nperformance evaluation (Piattoeva, 2015). Defining the required educational outcomes\nthrough the GIA, and then publicizing the results achieved by schools, became a means\nof enhancing the motivation of teachers, of school administration and of local and regional\nauthorities to comply with state educational standards (the national curriculum)\nEducational quality in the current policy documents is defined as the `preparedness of the\nlearner' in `conformance to federal state educational standards' (Law on Education, 2013, as\nquoted in Minina, 2017: 184). Measurable learning results occupy the central position in the\nstatements on quality, and multiple quality stakeholders including parents, teachers, edu-\ncation managers and employers are mentioned in this document (Minina, 2017). However,\nthe setting of quality criteria is still portrayed as an exclusive prerogative of the state, which\nexercises quality control in input (through institutional accreditation and audit) and in\noutput (through measurable outcomes) levels (Minina et al., 2018). Hence, the legal guise\nof a state with free-of-charge high-quality education has been rhetorically maintained.\nThe main difference from the Soviet model is that the responsibility for providing quality\nin the classroom has shifted from the government to educational institutions (Minina, 2017:\nWhile the recently introduced QAE instruments are analogous to those in Western soci-\neties, researchers characterize the context of their development and implementation as\nincreasingly authoritarian. The USE was introduced in a top-down manner, as a means\nfor accomplishing tasks prescribed by the government, and the multiple public and expert\ncriticisms of this examination were scarcely noted. Thus, it has become a signature instru-\nment of the `authoritarian modernization' \u00ad the dominant reform paradigm in Russia since\n54). The `mask of neoliberalism' in fact facilitates the neoconservative turn in educational\ngovernance, which is a part of wider political processes of neo-authoritarian restoration in\nIntertwined legacies at the local level\nStudies of education reforms at the local and school level often reveal that the reform has\nonly had a limited effect on everyday practices, that `new' practices are intertwined with the\n`older' ones or even that no significant changes have occurred in local educational gover-\nof Soviet education also document the ambiguity and complexity of education policies and\npractices at the micro-level (Byford and Jones, 2006). In this section I present the observed\npractices of QAE and educational governance in one locality in Russia in order to discuss\nhow the legacies of the different periods, that is, the Soviet era, the transition period and the\ncurrent agenda, appear even more mixed at the local level than they are at the national\npolicy level.\nThe study was conducted in the Republic of Chuvashia (population 1.3m), located\napproximately 650 km away from Moscow. Chuvashia is representative of a middle-sized\nand middle-income region with about half of its population of non-Russian ethnicity. The\nregion has a well-developed system of QAE that received positive reviews from external\nevaluators and is often presented as a `best practice' at training sessions for QAE profes-\nsionals. The education reforms implemented in the republic were guided by a World Bank\nproject (2001\u00ad2006). The specific case from Chuvashia examined in this research is the city\nof Cheboksary (0.5m inhabitants), the capital of the republic and the place where all the\nregional QAE initiatives originate. The term `local' is used in this article broadly for all\nsubnational levels, whereas the terms `regional' (meaning `within the Republic of\nChuvashia'), `municipal' (`within the city of Cheboksary') and `school' are applied to pro-\nvide more specific identifications within the realm of `local'.\nThe research material analysed for this article includes observation notes, interviews\nand local policy documents. School-level data was collected in two public schools in the\nsame city district, educating children from lower- and middle-income families. A total of\n25 interviews were conducted in schools (apart from the aforementioned schools, the\nheads of a further three schools were interviewed), along with 10-week observations of\nlessons, staff meetings and examinations. Also, seven interviews were conducted with\nrepresentatives of municipal and regional educational authorities, complemented by obser-\nvations of three municipal-level meetings for teachers and school administrators. For this\narticle I analysed the local actors' ideas of quality and QAE that were voiced in the\ninterviews, meetings or in informal conversations (documented in observation notes).\nThe analysis was guided by the following questions: (1) How do local actors define the\nquality of education? (2) How is the quality of education evaluated by local education\nauthorities and inside schools? (3) What are the main procedures connected to QAE? In\nthe interviews respondents were asked these specific questions. I also noted the ways in\nwhich teachers and administrators presented their schools, how they answered other ques-\ntions and what messages the representatives of education authorities communicated to\nschool staff in local meetings. The results of the analysis demonstrate the ways in which\ndifferent historical legacies and recent influences coexist in local practices and discourses,\nand how they affect the governance of schools.\nDefining and measuring quality: emphasis on conditions, student achievement and\nupbringing\nThe QAE policy of Chuvashia is outlined in the \"Decree on the republican system of eval-\nuation of the quality of education in the Republic of Chuvashia\" (Ministry of education and\nyouth policy of the Republic of Chuvashia, 2007) that establishes the `Regional system of\nevaluation of education quality' and is reinforced by other decrees addressing more specific\nissues, such as teacher portfolio or evaluation of school administrators. The Decree gives the\nfollowing definition of quality:\nQuality of education is a characteristic that reflects the level of correspondence between educa-\ntional results actually achieved and the conditions of the educational process, on the one hand,\nand state requirements and standards, social expectations and personal needs on the other.\n(Ministry of education and youth policy of the Republic of Chuvashia, 2007: 2)\nThe Decree continues to specify exactly what the educational results should be, and how\nthey should be measured. It outlines an elaborate system of desired outcomes in education,\ngrouped into four broad categories: the quality of educational results; the quality of con-\nditions and resources; the socioeconomic context; and the effectiveness of the utilization of\nresources. For each desired outcome it provides numerical indicators in terms of which it is\nto be measured; the number of indicators totals 80.\nThis key regional document on QAE demonstrates an attempt to create an all-\nencompassing definition of quality, and to take into account and assign a numerical value\nto every factor that influences educational processes and outcomes to better enable the\ncollection and processing of data for governance. However, observations and interviews\nat the municipal and school level revealed that local authorities use only some of these\nindicators (and the factors that they represent). This was also mentioned by one of our\ninterviewees when responding to an interview question about regional authorities:\nThere are very many indicators, and it is hard to guess in advance which of them will be inquired\nabout. Here we are of a different opinion to [the experts who developed the system of indica-\ntors]. They are theoreticians, but in practice it is hard to work with so many indicators. They\nhave not kept pace with the needs of the people. [The authorities] wish for a convenient system:\nsix indicators rather than eighty. The education system needs simple solutions rather than new\nones.\nInterviewees in the locality identified fewer than 10 main indicators by which local\neducation authorities judge school quality. Some of these indicators refer to conditions\nof the education process (equipment and infrastructure of the school; teacher qualifica-\ntions; number of students per class; teacher/student ratio). Others relate to the educa-\ntional achievements of students (grade-point average of students; average scores of\nstudents and number of failures in national examinations (GIA); number of prizes\nwon in subject Olympiads and educational contests). Still others evaluate the non-\neducational impact of the school (number of students with criminal records; participation\nof the school in regional and municipal social events). School administrators, when\npresenting their schools, emphasized the same characteristics: numbers of students and\nteachers, school facilities, teacher qualifications, participation of students in contests and\nprojects, scores in national examinations. A common indicator of school quality in the\nself-presentation was also the `demand' from local families \u00ad school workers proudly\npointed out that many students preferred their institution to neighbouring schools. When\nasked about the meaning of education quality, school workers talked primarily about\n`preparing for life' as an alternative to academic achievement:\nFor me, the quality of education is when our school-leaver knows how to live in society. It is of\nprimary importance to me. You can prepare the child theoretically, and he leaves with this big\npackage of knowledge, but if he cannot apply this knowledge in practice, to find his place . . .\n[then the quality of education has not been good].\nAlso, all interviewees from schools said that there should be no universal scale for school\nquality assessment. Instead, each school should be evaluated against its own goals and\nconditions of work.\nAt the time when the observation was conducted, municipal educational authorities\nplaced particular emphasis on the process of upbringing. An interviewee holding a senior\nposition in the local education administration body described the everyday work of her\norganization as supervision of patriotic education, crime prevention activities, sports and\nhealth education and future career guidance. School administrators responsible for `vospi-\ntanie' (upbringing) were dealing with an overwhelming number of documents that required\nthe participation of the school in diverse activities in these spheres (competitions, perform-\nances, visits to other organizations, pupil conferences, guest lectures, etc.). Virtually every\nday throughout the observation period schools were supposed to either organize some\nupbringing activity for students, or to send students and sometimes also parents to partic-\nipate in a city-organized activity.\nGoverning schools through QAE procedures\nAccording to the Decree on the evaluation of the quality of education, the regional system\nof evaluation performs several functions, including the licencing and accreditation of\nschools, attestation and awarding qualifications to teachers and school administrators\nand the evaluation of student performance (in national examinations and evaluation of\npolicy implementation). It should also provide research-based policy recommendations to\npolicymakers, and inform different stakeholders, including parents, the media and `society',\nabout the quality of education in the region and its different municipalities (Ministry of\neducation and youth policy of the Republic of Chuvashia, 2007: 4\u00ad6). These functions are\nnot performed by any single organization, but by a complex network of different organ-\nizations, each of them being responsible for a certain group of educational outcomes and\ncollecting different streams of data. These organizations, forms of data collection and the\nactions applied to schools based on this data are presented in Appendix 1.\nAt the school level, preparing and submitting reports and statistical information for\nsupervising organizations is an everyday activity. A secretary at one of the schools com-\nplained that in her work the number of requests for data had doubled over the last three\nyears. A deputy head mentioned that preparing the QAE documentation has recently grown\ninto a major responsibility that consumes more than half of the working time, and that\nhiring employees to deal solely with this task has become a common practice in schools of\nthe region. In municipal-level meetings, the importance of documenting activities is regu-\nlarly stressed. As one school-level interviewee formulated, documentation seems more\nimportant than actually organizing the activity:\nWe have prepared so many reports, analyses of events organized, and for every event we submit\ndocuments to different authorities. . . . It feels as if it is not important whether you have actually\ndone the activity, the main thing is to report to five organizations. I would understand if it were\nfor some major event, but, for virtually every small campaign [mesyachnik], these heaps of\nreports are too much.\nThis quote also demonstrates that the term `analysing' is used interchangeably with `report-\ning', which reflects the handling of analytical information in the locality observed. As many\nof the interviewees noted, in schools and in administrative institutions alike, the current\neducation authorities in the locality do not utilize the gathered data for analytical purposes.\nCollection of data is needed primarily to ensure accountability, so that at every level admin-\nistrators can immediately answer requests from the higher level, or prove their compliance\nwith state requirements in case of an unexpected audit. Constant preparedness for audits\nand compliance with regulations is of key importance, for both schools and authorities. A\nschool administrator reported:\nIf our institution somehow violates some norms, we may lose our accreditation, we may lose our\nlicence. Hence all these monitoring studies, self-evaluation reports, all these different reports\n[exist] \u00ad all this is just so that the institution works as it should work by law. Do you understand?\nIt is very serious.\nWith data collection and reporting serving accountability purposes, face-to-face meetings\nand inspections still, as in the Soviet times, constitute a major instrument of quality control\nand management in the locality. An interviewee from a city education authority explained\nhow she and her colleagues `always try to go out and see' what happens in the school, or\nmeet with school administrators on their own premises, and prefer this way of identifying\nproblems to generating reports or data collection. Lower than expected indicators of\npupil achievement, such as average GIA scores or grades, give reason for an additional\nmeeting or inspection, and are, therefore, not treated as sufficient information for decision-\nmaking per se.\nWe go for. . . well, previously we called it inspections, it was a long time ago, when we were\ninspectors, meaning that we had control and supervision functions. Now we don't have those, so\nwe go to educational institutions in order to offer methodological help. Why? We take some\ntopic within our remit, for example, specializations in education. We make a plan, inform the\nmanagement, go out and observe, from normative documents to lessons. We diagnose problems\nin some schools, and then, of course, [organize] a seminar for principals. . . . Now there are\nslightly fewer inspections [that we ourselves undertake]. Supervision authorities visit [schools]\nquite often. But before they visit I have already assigned a specialist for this task; she goes in\nadvance and, together with the school, checks all the documents. [She] also observes lessons,\nbecause sometimes there are [federal] tests in different subjects. She, so to say, prepares schools\nfor these inspections.\nNotably, school workers complained about the lack of assistance from the authorities. In\nboth schools as well as at municipal-level meetings, school administrators deplored that they\nbear the consequences of misinterpreting state regulations, yet the supervising authorities do\nnot provide any clarification on how to implement them. Instead, as the school staff\nreported, authorities would wait for the results of federal inspections, and then suggest\nthat schools `exchange experiences' and that those who successfully passed inspections `dis-\nseminate best practices'.\nAt the school level, more quality assurance procedures were observed. Apart from obser-\nvations of lessons by school management (`internal school quality control') that have\nremained in practice since the Soviet times, and the preparation of numerous reports in\nresponse to external requests, school staff engage in many other evaluation activities.\nTeachers regularly prepare self-assessment reports based on which performance-related\npart of a salary is calculated, and compose personal portfolios for teacher attestation\nprocedures. Every school should present an annual self-evaluation report on its website.\nAdditional evaluation activities are connected to preparing students for national examina-\ntions. Since examination results bear high stakes for students, parents, teachers and admin-\nistrators, schools organize preliminary tests of `preparedness for GIA' (by their own means\nor by ordering materials from external commercial providers). And schools also conduct\nanalyses of students' typical mistakes in GIA. The results of these analyses are discussed in\nstaff meetings and serve as a basis for improving teaching.\nDiscussion\nThe current inquiry into the history of QAE policy in Russia and the local enactment of this\npolicy have been evoked by a critical attitude towards labelling certain practices as distinc-\ntively `socialist' or `neo-liberal'. Neo-liberalism, like socialism, lacks coherency and constan-\ncy across its articulations in diverse times and places (Collier, 2011: 250), and hence it is not\nproductive to apply any of these concepts in a blanket way. Rather than reducing the\nunderstanding of socialist and post-socialist spaces to simple dichotomies, their multiple\nand complex histories should be acknowledged (Silova et al., 2017). When reviewing micro-\nlevel studies of Soviet education, Byford and Jones (2006) conclude: `The messy, arbitrary\nand contingent process of policy formation, and the unpredictable way in which policies\nwere translated into practices, invariably introduced contradictions, confusions and\nuncertainties that undermined any straightforward idea of educational \"paradigms\" as his-\nThis study highlights the complexities of post-Soviet reality by demonstrating how edu-\ncation policy in every period reviewed is more mixed than might be assumed if one simply\ncompares it to theoretical models of education governance. For example, the Soviet educa-\ntion policy resembles what Maroy (2008) describes as the bureaucratic-professional model\nof governance, in which the state defines the functions, roles and specific competencies\nrequired of everyone in the system, and controls compliance with these rules through\ninspections and audits. However, the reality of policy development and policy implementa-\ntion in the Soviet Union was far more complicated. For instance, the diversification of\neducation, attention to the needs of individual students, interest in testing techniques,\ninequalities in the distribution of resources and learning from foreign sources were already\nin place in the Soviet era (Kukulin et al., 2015). The Russian education policy of the first\ndecade of the post-Soviet transition in many respects resembled another model \u00ad the NPM\nparadigm in governance. The financial and executive autonomy of schools, their orientation\ntowards `customer' needs and accountability to the public, management by results and data-\nbased management \u00ad all these policies implemented in Russia in the 1990s look as if they\nhave been copied from the `global scripts' (Meyer and Ramirez, 2000). However, these\ndevelopments had different roots in Russia than in the Western democracies that imple-\nmented NPM in the 1970s. In England and New Zealand, which are often referred to as the\nbirthplaces and the `classic cases' of NPM, the transition to this governance paradigm was\npresented as a remedy for the shortcomings of traditional bureaucracy and a way of reduc-\nRussia in the 1990s similar ideas and practices developed primarily as a breakaway from the\nSoviet past and as a result of an abrupt transition to market economy (for a more detailed\nAttention to the context of policy development helps to problematize the identification of\ncertain current policies as purely `neo-liberal'. We see, for example, that the economically\ndriven call for the applicability of knowledge does not appear only in market economies, but\nwas also in place during the Soviet time, and that holding teachers accountable for the poor\nperformance of their pupils while ignoring the socio-economic context is an understanding\nthat can be found in very different political systems. In the current QAE setting in Russia\nthat utilizes apparently `Western' instruments, one can discern the same principles as in\nSoviet education policy. The new, `soft' technology of governance through measurements,\ncomparison and `best practices', public league tables and incentives tied to high perfor-\nmance, have all added to rather than replaced the traditional `hard' instruments of control\n(Piattoeva, 2015), and serve the purpose of reinstating the centralized regulation of educa-\ntional activities. Equality of access to education has remained a major principle, at least in\nthe political rhetoric, and serves as justification for the introduction of new quality assur-\nance procedures.\nThe local case analysis presented in this paper demonstrates how the local conceptuali-\nzations of quality and the QAE policies enacted are loaded with legacies of different periods\nto an even greater extent than are policies at the national level. Definitions of educational\nquality in the local policy documents attempt to take account of the conditions, processes\nand results of schooling, and at the same time connect the idea of quality to state standards,\nwider societal expectations and individual student needs. Each element constituting quality\nis translated into a set of measurable indicators. Formats of data collection, procedures\napplied to schools based on this data and organizations exercising quality evaluation and\nassurance are manifold. Local policymakers, it seems, wanted to retain the traditional\nconcepts of quality and instruments of QAE, and at the same time introduce new ideas,\nactors and procedures that can be connected to the transition period and to the recommen-\ndations of transnational organizations (one of which, the World Bank, was engaged in the\ndevelopment of the new QAE system in the region).\nIn the practices of educational governance in the locality, this attempt to account for\neverything has resulted mainly in the increased bureaucratization of school work. Schools\nbear the full responsibility for guaranteeing quality, and must, therefore, implement all\nquality assurance procedures that have been introduced during different periods. Instead\nof a transition to `post-bureaucratic' governance, a `hyper-bureaucratic' regime has emerged\nAt the same time, in the governance practices of local educational authorities, the recently\nintroduced QAE instruments appear to be `imitated' rather than genuinely implemented.\nNot all the performance data collected are used for analysis and decision-making, but\nmostly for purposes of accountability, understood as due reporting to higher authorities.\nThe instruments of QAE that are actually used by local education authorities are still the\nsame as those that were in place in the Soviet period: inspections, reports and metrics (now\nincluding national examination scores) that may indicate the existence of a problem and\nserve as a justification for additional inspections. Among all components of quality, munic-\nipal authorities pay particular attention to upbringing, which can be viewed as a legacy of\nthe Soviet period, but is also linked by some authors to the restoration of authoritarianism\nin Russia (e.g. Rapoport, 2009). Highlighting the blending of diverse legacies in QAE policy\nat both the national and local level, and the prevalence of traditional practices in school\ngovernance, this paper contributes to the development of a more nuanced understanding of\n`post-socialist' and `neo-liberal' transformations in Russia and globally.\n"
