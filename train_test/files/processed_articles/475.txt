Sheffield and M. Kristen Peek\nIn previous research on cognitive decline among older adults, investigators have not considered the potential\nimpact of contextual variables, such as neighborhood-level conditions. In the present investigation, the authors\nexamined the association between 2 neighborhood-context variables--socioeconomic status and percentage of\nMexican-American residents--and individual-level cognitive function over a 5-year follow-up period (1993\u00ad1998).\nData were obtained from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, a longitu-\ndinal study of community-dwelling older Mexican Americans (n \u00bc 3,050) residing in the southwestern United\nStates. Individual records were linked with 1990 US Census tract data, which provided information on neighbor-\nhood characteristics. Hierarchical linear growth-curve models and hierarchical logistic models were used to ex-\namine relations between individual- and neighborhood-level variables and the rate and incidence of cognitive\ndecline. Results showed that baseline cognitive function and rates of cognitive decline varied significantly across\nUS Census tracts. Respondents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods experienced significantly\nfaster rates of cognitive decline than those in more advantaged neighborhoods. Odds of incident cognitive decline\ndecreased as a function of neighborhood percentage of Mexican-American residents and increased with neighbor-\nhood economic disadvantage. The authors conclude that neighborhood context is associated with late-life cogni-\ntive function and that the effects are independent of individual-level risk factors.\naged; cognition; Hispanic Americans; longitudinal studies; Mexican Americans; poverty; residence characteristics;\nsocial class\nAbbreviations: Hispanic EPESE, Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly; MMSE, Mini-Mental\nState Examination.\nUnderstanding the cognitive health of older adults is of\nmajor scientific importance and is essential to both public\nhealth planning and health-care practice. Previous research\non cognition has focused on individual-level characteristics\nas risk or protective factors for cognitive decline, rarely con-\nsidering the potential impact of contextual variables, such as\nneighborhood-level conditions. Neighborhoods have emerged\nas an important context for physical health and well-being\n(1\u00ad4) and may also be important for cognitive health (5\u00ad8).\nA growing body of research has documented the effects\nof neighborhood-level characteristics on individual health.\nNeighborhood socioeconomic context, in particular, has been\nidentified as a salient characteristic with regard to health out-\ncomes (4). With few exceptions (9, 10), investigators have\nreported significant associations between neighborhood so-\ncioeconomic deprivation and increased mortality (11\u00ad13),\nnegative health behaviors (14, 15), increased rates of cardio-\nvascular disease, lower self-rated health, and higher body\nmass index, independent of individual-level risk factors (4).\nFew studies have explored the effects of neighborhood\ncontext on cognitive function in adults, and to our knowl-\nedge none have examined the relations longitudinally.\nCorrespondence to Kristin M. Sheffield, Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301\nNevertheless, available evidence suggests that the contexts\nin which people live may be related to their level of cogni-\ntive functioning. For example, using data from a large, na-\ntionally representative study of older US adults, Wight et al.\n(5) reported that higher neighborhood-level educational at-\ntainment was associated with better cognitive function, net\nof individual-level socioeconomic status, demographic fac-\ntors, and health status. Recently, Lang et al. (16) found that\nneighborhood deprivation was independently associated\nwith worse cognitive performance on the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) (17) in women and men aged 70 years\nor more and women younger than age 70 years.\nNeighborhood context may be more salient to certain\nsubgroups of the population, since age, sex, and race/\nethnicity appear to affect the level and impact of exposure\nto neighborhood environments (3). Older adults often have\ngreater exposure to their neighborhood environments via\nlonger length of residence and less participation in activities\noutside the community, and they may be more dependent on\ncommunity resources than younger age groups (3). Minority\npopulations, such as Hispanics, are inordinately exposed to\nimpoverished neighborhood conditions. Compared with 9%\nof whites, 40% of Hispanics reside in areas where the pov-\nmore, approximately 20% of Hispanics are poor as com-\npared with 8% of non-Hispanic whites (19).\nSeveral recent studies have indicated that in addition to\nneighborhood socioeconomic context, the relative concen-\ntration of Hispanics in a neighborhood may be relevant for\nthe health of Hispanic residents. In particular, these studies\nreport health benefits associated with residence in ethnically\nhomogeneous neighborhoods, including higher self-rated\nhealth (20), lower odds of stroke, cancer, and hip fracture\nerally, these studies focused on ``Hispanics,'' who differ in\nregion of origin, migration patterns, and cultural values and\nexperiences. However, Mexican Americans, the largest\nHispanic subpopulation, comprised the majority of each\nAmericans and examined the health effects of neighborhood\nconcentration of Mexican Americans in particular.\nIn the present investigation, we examined the association\nbetween 2 neighborhood-context variables--socioeconomic\nstatus and percentage of Mexican-American residents--and\ncognitive function over a 5-year follow-up period, using\ndata from a longitudinal study of community-dwelling older\nMexican Americans. We hypothesized that poor socioeco-\nnomic context would be associated with worse baseline\ncognitive function and a higher rate of cognitive decline,\nwhile greater neighborhood ethnic homogeneity would be\nassociated with better baseline cognitive function and would\nbe protective against cognitive decline.\nSample\nData were obtained from the Hispanic Established Pop-\nulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Hispanic\nEPESE), a panel study of Mexican-American adults aged 65\nyears or more. A more complete description of the rationale\nand methods of the Hispanic EPESE has been published\nmultistage area cluster probability sampling, with 1990\nUS Census tracts serving as the primary sampling units.\nIn the present investigation, we used the first 3 waves of\nthe Hispanic EPESE, since 1990 US Census tract data pro-\nvided information on neighborhood characteristics. Of the\nlost to follow-up, and 124 refused to be reinterviewed.\nThus, 1,980 respondents remained in the study at wave 3\nDependent variable\nCognitive function was measured using English and\nSpanish versions of the MMSE, which were adopted from\nthe Diagnostic Interview Schedule used in prior community\nsurveys (28). The MMSE is a commonly used brief measure\nof cognitive status in studies of older adults (17), and it\nappears to be a valid indicator of cognitive impairment in\nboth non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American samples\n(8). The Spanish version of the MMSE has met standard\ncriteria for the development of translated tests and has been\nsuccessfully implemented in community surveys of Mexi-\ncan Americans (29). Respondents who were interviewed by\nproxy were counted as missing; however, if the proxy was\nused because of mental/cognitive incapacity, the respondent\nwas given a score of 0 and retained in the analyses.\nRespondents who could not answer 1 or more MMSE ques-\ntions because of physical limitations such as deafness,\nblindness, or arthritis were excluded from the analyses.\nThus, estimates were based on a total of 2,851 participants\nIndependent variables\nNeighborhood characteristics. US Census tracts were\nused as proxies for neighborhood environments. Census\ntracts are small geographic areas within counties that are\ndesigned to be relatively homogeneous with respect to pop-\nulation characteristics, socioeconomic status, and living\nconditions. Census tracts contain an average population of\n4,000 people and vary in geographic size depending on the\npopulation density of the area (e.g., urban settings vs. rural\nsettings) (30). Records for individual respondents were\nlinked with 1990 US Census data (Summary Tape File 3A\n(31)) for the 208 tracts in which respondents lived at base-\nline. The median length of residence in the household\n70% of respondents had lived at their current residence for\n10 or more years, implying residential stability among\nrespondents.\nNeighborhoods and Cognitive Decline 1093\nTo capture multiple dimensions of neighborhood socio-\neconomic status, we conducted an exploratory factor anal-\nysis on the 208 census tracts using 14 census tract indicators\nrepresenting education, occupational class, poverty, hous-\ning, and income. Results yielded a 2-factor solution explain-\ning 82% of the common variance. One factor was labeled\n``economic advantage'' because poverty, income, and hous-\ning items loaded highly and higher scores reflected higher\neconomic standing. The other factor was labeled ``social\ndisadvantage'' because education and occupational class\nitems loaded highly and higher scores reflected lower social\nstanding. The correlation between the 2 factors was \u00c00.35.\nIn preliminary analyses, factor scores were not linearly re-\nlated to MMSE score; therefore, they were coded into quar-\ntiles for use in hierarchical linear models.\nIn addition to neighborhood socioeconomic status, a mea-\nsure of neighborhood ethnic homogeneity was used in the\nanalyses. The percentage of neighborhood residents whowere\nMexican or Mexican-American (i.e., ``percent Mexican-\nAmerican'') was used as a continuous variable with values\nranging from 0 to 1.\nIndividual-level covariates. Models were adjusted for\nindividual-level sociodemographic measures, including age\nat baseline, sex (female vs. male), marital status (married vs.\nnot married), and nativity status (US-born vs. foreign-born).\nThe highest level of education completed (<5 years or 5\u00ad11\ncupation were used as individual-level measures of socioeco-\nnomic status. Respondents with missing data on income or\neducation were retained in the analyses, and missing-data\nstatus was entered as a category in all models. Respondents\nwere asked what kind of work they had performed during\nmost of their lives,and their work experiencewas categorized\nclassifications (32): professional/sales (reference group), ser-\nvice, farming, skilled crafts/repair, manual labor, or never\nworked/homemaker. Analyses were also adjusted for\nhealth conditions often associated with cognitive decline--\ndepressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression Scale (33); (continuous variable) and self-\nreported physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus and stroke.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis included the use of t tests, analysis of\nvariance, and Pearson correlations to examine bivariate\nassociations between cognitive function and independent\nvariables. The cross-sectional associations between neigh-\nborhood characteristics and cognitive function at baseline\nwere measured using 2-level hierarchical linear models with\nrandom intercepts, designed such that respondents were\nnested within the 208 neighborhoods in which they resided\n(34). Multilevel analyses allowed for the examination of\nwithin- and between-neighborhood variability in MMSE\nscores and the extent to which between-neighborhood var-\niance was accounted for by individual- or neighborhood-\nlevel characteristics.\nCognitive decline was assessed using 2 methods of\ndata analysis. The first approach estimated individual- and\nneighborhood-level cognitive function trajectories, or\n``growth'' curves, using 3-level hierarchical linear models\n(34). The 3 occasions of measurement of cognitive function\n(level 1) were nested within individuals (level 2), who were\nnested within neighborhoods (level 3). At level 1, each in-\ndividual participant's MMSE scores over the 3 waves of data\ncollection were modeled as a function of time (years since\nbaseline). The intercept(s) (baseline cognitive status) and\nslope(s) (yearly rate of decline in cognitive function) were\nspecified as random at levels 2 and 3. Level 2 in the model\nincluded the individual-level predictors of cognitive func-\ntion and decline, and level 3 included neighborhood-level\npredictors.\nThe second approach employed a dichotomous measure\nof cognitive decline, created using a cutoff based on the\ndistribution of scores from the sample itself. Participants\nwere considered to have experienced cognitive decline if\ntheir MMSE scores decreased by 3 or more points (median\nchange) from wave 1 to wave 3. Logistic regression models\nwere fitted using hierarchical generalized linear modeling.\nThe models estimated odds ratios for the relation between\nbaseline individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics\nand cognitive decline at wave 3.\nIn all analyses, continuous individual- and neighborhood-\nlevel variables were centered at the grand mean for estima-\ntion and interpretation purposes. The inferential statistics\npresented here were estimated using robust standard errors\nproduced by hierarchical linear models, because they are\nsomewhat tolerant of violations of hierarchical linear mod-\neling assumptions (34). Analyses were performed using the\nstatistical software packages HLM, version 6.04 (35), and\nSAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nTests of statistical significance were 2-sided.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics\nTable 1 presents individual- and neighborhood-level\nsample characteristics at baseline and bivariate associa-\ntions between cognitive function and explanatory vari-\nables. The majority of participants in the sample were\nfemale, with a mean age of 73 years, and most were cur-\nrently married. Mean scores on the MMSE were 24.70,\n959 respondents had a score that declined by !3 points\n(data not shown). At the neighborhood level, the average\ncensus tract was approximately 60% Mexican-American,\nbut values ranged from 10% to 96%. Most of the sample\nlived in economically and socially disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods. Cognitive function was significantly associated\nwith age, nativity, marital status, education, occupation,\nincome, depressive symptoms, stroke, and economic and\nsocial factors.\nExplanatory models\nTable 2 presents results from hierarchical linear models\nrelating individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics\nto baseline cognitive function. There was significant random\nvariation in cognitive function across neighborhoods, such\nthat 16% of the variance in baseline cognitive function could\nbe attributed to living in different neighborhoods. Individual-\nlevel characteristics accounted for 31% of the level-1\nwithin-group variance. Lower education, older age, lower\nincome, having diabetes, having more depressive symp-\ntoms, and having suffered a stroke were associated with\npoorer cognitive function. Female sex was positively asso-\nciated with cognitive function. Respondents who were\nhomemakers or unemployed had poorer cognitive function\nthan those who worked in professional/sales careers. Neigh-\nborhood percent Mexican-American and the neighborhood\nsocioeconomic factors were not significantly associated\nwith baseline cognitive function.\nTable 3 presents estimates from hierarchical linear\ngrowth-curve models of cognitive function over the 5-year\nfollow-up period. The multiplicative terms indicate the\nextent to which predictors were associated with slopes of\ncognitive decline. The ``year slope'' estimate shows that\nMMSE scores significantly decreased over time at a rate of\n0.77 points per year. The random effects in model 1 in-\ndicate that approximately 19% of the variance in rates of\ncognitive decline could be attributed to living in different\nneighborhoods. Older age and having more depressive\nsymptoms at baseline were significantly associated with\nfaster rates of decline. Neighborhood percent Mexican-\nAmerican was marginally associated with cognitive de-\ncline. People living in more ethnically homogeneous\nneighborhoods experienced somewhat slower rates of de-\ncline. Cognitive decline was more severe among persons\nliving in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. For\nexample, those in the lowest quartile of neighborhood eco-\nnomic advantage declined cognitively, on average, \u00c00.28\npoints per year faster than those in the highest quartile of\nadvantage. Neighborhood social disadvantage was not as-\nsociated with rate of cognitive decline. Together, neigh-\nborhood percent Mexican-American and neighborhood\neconomic advantage explained 10.5% of the between-\nneighborhood variance in rate of decline.\nFigure 1 displays cognitive growth curves over time by\nquartile of economic advantage. Explanatory variables and\ncovariates not included in the graph were held constant at\nthe mean.\nMultilevel logistic regression models predicting the\nodds of decline (!3 points) at wave 3 are presented in\nTable 4. Having less than 5 years of education, being older\nat baseline, having more depressive symptoms, and having\nhad a stroke were associated with higher odds of incident\ncognitive decline. Increasing neighborhood percentage of\nMexican-American residents was associated with reduced\nodds of cognitive decline (odds ratio \u00bc 0.33, 95% confi-\nadvantage was associated with increased odds of cognitive\ndecline. For example, persons living in neighborhoods at\nthe lowest quartile of economic advantage had signifi-\ncantly higher odds of decline than those living in the most\neconomically advantaged neighborhoods (odds ratio \u00bc\nborhood social disadvantage was not associated with the\nodds of cognitive decline.\nTable 1.

Depres-\nsive symptoms, older age at baseline, diabetes, and stroke\nwere associated with increased odds of death or dropout by\nwave 3, while female sex and being married were associ-\nated with decreased odds. Respondents with lower MMSE\nscores at baseline were more likely to die or drop out,\nwhich was expected. However, neighborhood percentage\nof Mexican-American residents and neighborhood eco-\nnomic disadvantage were negatively but nonsignificantly\nassociated with death or loss to follow-up by wave 3, which\nsuggests that reported associations between neighbor-\nhood variables and cognition are not due to selectively\nhigh death or loss to follow-up of respondents from\neconomically disadvantaged or ethnically homogeneous\nneighborhoods.\nAlthough the effects presented in Table 3 were based on\ndata from all 2,851 respondents, persons with complete data\nwere given more weight than those with incomplete data.\nWe investigated whether there were systematic differences\nin individual growth curves between participants with and\nwithout complete data, excluding from analysis respondents\nwith only 1 wave of data. Compared with persons who had\ncomplete data at wave 3, respondents who died or were lost\nto follow-up had significantly lower baseline MMSE scores,\nbut they did not have faster rates of cognitive decline. More-\nover, adjusting the growth-curve model for respondent sta-\ntus at wave 3 (complete vs. deceased or lost to follow-up)\ndid not attenuate the associations between neighborhood\nvariables and cognitive decline.\nSensitivity analyses\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness\nof the observed associations. Incident decline analyses were\nrepeated using alternate cutoff points for the dichotomous\nmeasure of decline. Results were robust to a cutoff of\n4 points; however, when we used a cutoff of 7 points (75th\npercentile of decline), percent Mexican-American was no\nlonger statistically significant. We repeated all longitudinal\nanalyses after excluding persons who were impaired at base-\nline (MMSE score < 18; n \u00bc 152), and the results were\nsubstantively equivalent to the previous results, indicating\nthat the observed associations were not being driven by\npersons who were cognitively impaired at baseline.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study provides evidence that neighborhood\ncontext is associated with cognitive decline among older\nMexican-American adults. The findings of the study were\nseveral-fold. First, there was significant variation in baseline\ncognitive function and rates of cognitive decline across neigh-\nborhoods, even after adjustment for individual-level charac-\nteristics. Second, older adults living in areas with higher\npercentages of Mexican Americans were slightly better off\ncognitively than those living in areas less populated by\nMexican Americans, ceteris paribus. Third, neighborhood\neconomic disadvantage was associated with increased rate\nand risk of cognitive decline. Finally, neighborhood ethnic\nhomogeneity and economic disadvantage explained more\nthan 10% of the between-neighborhood variance in decline,\nor approximately 2% of the total variance in cognitive decline.\nThere are a number of potential pathways through which\nneighborhoods may influence cognitive health. Neighbor-\nhoods represent the daily context and quality of life experi-\nenced by residents in terms of a number of factors, including\nsocial interactions and cultural climate, psychosocial and\nphysical stressors, lifestyle, and availability of personal\nand institutional resources (8). Wight et al. (5) suggested\nthat socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods may\nhave more stressors and fewer physical and social resources,\nthus inhibiting participation in both physical and social ac-\ntivities, which have been linked to better cognitive function-\ning (5, 36, 37). Such neighborhoods also may have fewer\ncognitively stimulating resources (e.g., bookstores, librar-\nies). In addition to these pathways, it is likely that some\nof the cognitive impact of neighborhood socioeconomic\ncontext is routed through its effects on health-related risk\nfactors for cognitive decline, such as cardiovascular disease\nand functional decline (40).\nNeighborhood economic advantage was related to cogni-\ntive decline, while neighborhood social disadvantage was not,\nan observation that could provide insight into the pathways\nthrough which neighborhoods influence cognitive functioning\nin older adults. The economic advantage factor may represent\na better proxy for specific neighborhood conditions and re-\nsources relevant to cognitive decline in this sample. We as-\nsessed the individual effects of the census indicators\ncomposing the factor, and ``median value of owned homes''\nMMSE Score\nYears of Follow-up\nQuartile 4 (most advantaged)\nQuartile 1 (least advantaged)\nQuartile 2\nQuartile 3\nFigure 1.

The specific mechanisms\nlinking neighborhoods and cognitive health are probably\nTable 4.

However, establishing that res-\nidence in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood is\nrelated to cognitive decline is the first step toward drawing\ncausal inferences and developing interventions to prevent or\nreduce cognitive decline.\nEthnically homogeneous Mexican-American neigh-\nborhoods may confer sociocultural advantages to their\nresidents. Mexican Americans may benefit from the psy-\nchosocial resources, social organization and control, pres-\nervation of culture, and healthful traditional behavioral\nnorms often found in neighborhoods populated by other\nAmerican neighborhoods have relatively high rates of\nlabor force participation, intact family structures, home\nownership, and residential stability, despite being socio-\neconomically disadvantaged (42, 43). However, as the rap-\nidly expanding Mexican-American population in the\nUnited States moves into more assimilated but still disad-\nvantaged areas, the risk of cognitive decline and other\nhealth conditions in this group may increase.\nThis study had several strengths and limitations of note.\nAnalyses were adjusted for a number of individual-level cor-\nrelates of cognitive function and decline. Nevertheless, it is\npossible that the observed associations reflected unmeasured\nvariables. This study employed a large probability sample\nof older Mexican Americans, which enhances the generaliz-\nability of the findings to the larger population of Mexican\nAmericans in the southwestern United States. We used longi-\ntudinal analyses to examine the relation between baseline\ncharacteristics and cognitive decline, which helped to estab-\nlish temporality of association. However, the analyses did not\ninclude any time-varying predictors that might have helped\nexplain age-related changes in cognitive function. Selection\neffects may have been operating in these analyses, since the\nsample participants were aged !65 years at baseline. Finally,\ncensus tracts are imperfect proxies for neighborhood bound-\naries and may not represent neighborhood areas as they are\nperceived by residents. Additionally, the strength of associa-\ntions between neighborhood characteristics and individual\noutcomes may vary according to size of the neighborhood\nproxy, since larger geographic areas tend to be more hetero-\ngeneous (44). Nevertheless, census tracts have been shown to\nbe reasonable approximations of neighborhoods (45), and\nseveral studies have indicated that census tracts and smaller\ngeographic units known as block groups perform similarly,\nThe present study has provided evidence that neighbor-\nhood ethnic homogeneity and socioeconomic context are\nrelevant to cognitive decline among older Mexican Ameri-\ncans. The neighborhood effects observed in this study were\nindependent of individual-level characteristics, indicating\nthat the contextual effect was not simply the result of com-\npositional differences among neighborhoods. These findings\nadd to existing literature indicating that context matters for\ncognition, as well as the more general literature concerning\nneighborhood effects on health. More research is warranted\nto determine whether and to what extent context matters for\ncognitive decline among other racial/ethnic groups in vari-\nous neighborhood environments. Community interventions\nthat provide high-risk areas with physical, social, and cog-\nnitively stimulating resources may be an effective means of\nreducing the negative cognitive impact of living in a disad-\nvantaged environment, in addition to improving the quality\nof life for all residents.\n"
