Does living in a low-income neighborhood or deprived\nneighborhoods in general have an effect on people's lives, the\njobs that they have, and the health that they enjoy? Of particular\ninterest have been outcomes for children. Does growing up in a\npoor neighborhood inhibit later life chances? This literature has\nbeen stimulated in part by observations that poverty concentra-\ntions have been increasing, and that the fixed inner-city public\nhousing projects of the past do not seem to have helped\nlow-income and minority households in their search for suitable\nand safe housing. These questions about neighborhoods and\ntheir effects have generated a substantial and growing literature\nthat examines the additive marginal effects of neighborhoods on\nresidential outcomes for inner-city poverty populations (1, 2).\nThat is, after controlling for the socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the household, how much additional\nvariance in outcome measures do neighborhood characteristics\nexplain? The literature has struggled with questions of how much\nvariance is attributable to the neighborhood and how much is\nrelated to family composition. Although the consensus is still\nforming, evidence does appear to suggest that place of residence\ndoes matter, certainly an outcome that is consistent with much\ngeographic literature on residential location and the impacts of\nparticular places on households (3).\nSeveral specific studies of residential moves between neigh-\nborhoods, including studies of the outcomes of residential moves\nin the Gautreaux program in Chicago, the Hollman settlement\nin Minneapolis, and the extensive experimental program Moving\nto Opportunity (MTO), have attempted to evaluate whether\nhouseholds make gains when they change neighborhoods (4).\nThese investigations have used a variety of approaches to\nexamine whether mobility can lead to improved life chances.\nHowever, evaluations to date have focused primarily on the\ninitial move and have failed to recognize the impacts of ongoing\nresidential mobility. In this paper, I extend the analysis of\nprevious studies of the outcomes of residential mobility by\nexamining two broad sets of questions about long-term gains\nfrom the MTO program. I use Baltimore as a case study. First,\nis there evidence of living in lower-poverty neighborhoods after\nresidential mobility, and are the gains from residential mobility\nsustained over time with subsequent moves? Second, do the\nhousing choices lead to living in integrated settings, and again,\ndo these moves to greater residential integration persist over\ntime? Also relevant to neighborhood outcomes are questions\nabout the quality of the neighborhood (including lower crime\nrates), educational achievement levels, and levels of employ-\nment, but these are not examined in this study.\nNeighborhoods and Mobility\nResidential mobility is a highly structured process with impacts\non both the households who move and the places that they\nchoose in their relocation behavior. It is the basic process\nwhereby households improve the quality of their housing and the\ntype of neighborhoods that they inhabit and is intimately con-\nnected with urban change as a whole (5). Moves are transitions\nin people's lives, and neighborhood transitions are the conse-\nquences of aggregated individual mobility transitions. Thus, over\ntime, the sum of the myriad decisions by individual households\nleads to basic changes in the urban structure. Neighborhoods and\ncommunities change as people move in and out of them. Over\ntime, these individual moves and the changes that they bring\neventually establish the population composition of neighbor-\nhoods, and the patterns of land use and the associated patterns\nof commuting and traffic flows. Mobility is ``a consistent and\npervasive behavior forming a major element of the policy\ncontext; it affects the conditions under which policies are\ndeveloped and exerts a strong influence on their outcomes'' (6).\nIt is important to distinguish, both in new research and reviews\nof past research, between individual behaviors that affect neigh-\nborhoods and neighborhood effects on individuals. In the first\nsense, we view mobility as the proximate cause of change,\nalthough areas may have high mobility but be stable in popula-\ntion composition. This conceptualization emphasizes individuals\nas agents who move between places and who change the neigh-\nborhoods that they choose. If a large number of minorities\nchoose a neighborhood, they change the ethnic composition of\nthat neighborhood, for example, although the changes also may\nbe more subtle, such as shifts from a neighborhood without\nyoung families and children to a neighborhood with them.\nWithin this framework, we can conceptualize neighborhood\nchange as the outcome of individual mobility decisions. Of\ncourse, neighborhoods change from factors other than residen-\ntial mobility; planning decisions with respect to the location of\npositive and negative externalities and private-sector decisions\nwith respect to capital expenditure also play a role.\nAbbreviations: MTO, Moving to Opportunity; HUD, Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment.\n*E-mail: wclark@geog.ucla.edu.\n\u00a9 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA\nIn a second conceptualization, the focus is specifically on the\nneighborhood impacts on individuals who move to that neigh-\nborhood. Does the household gain from moving to a particular\nneighborhood? In this conceptualization, we are asking whether\nthe individual benefits from the context effects of the new\nneighborhood. If individuals move to a low-poverty neighbor-\nhood, do they improve their lives in some sense? The emphasis\non context effects arose originally from public health concerns;\ni.e., reducing concentrated poor-quality housing was seen as\nnecessary to improving public health. It is now clear, however,\nthat health has more to do with poverty than with housing per se.\nRecent work on neighborhood conditions emphasizes the role\nthat the neighborhood plays in shaping outcomes for individuals\nand households. Indeed, as we might expect, other things being\nequal, people want to live in ``good'' neighborhoods and to have\ntheir children grow up in safe environments. Thus, it is not\nsurprising to find the strong and growing perception among\nacademics and households themselves that growing up in a ``bad''\nneighborhood will likely reduce children's life chances. The\nreviews of neighborhood effects have tended to emphasize the\nnegative effects of poverty and low-income neighborhoods and\nconcluded that indeed there are outcomes on childhood achieve-\nment (7) and on victimization in unsafe neighborhoods (8). In\naddition to examining neighborhood socioeconomic character-\nistics, studies also have assessed the impact of neighborhood\nenvironmental quality on the well-being of residents. Pauleit (9)\nemphasized the role and value of ``green space'' in European\ncities, and it is clear that in the Netherlands, with its long\ntradition of concern with neighborhood environments, the rural\naspects of neighborhoods are often cited by residents as impor-\ntant factors in residential choice (10). Work has demonstrated\nthat the amount of green space in the living environment also\npositively affects people's (self-reported) health (11).\nAnecdotal discussions of neighborhood effects on health\noutcomes seem to suggest that, even after controlling for socio-\neconomic status, people in poor neighborhoods fare less well in\nhealth outcomes than those in nonpoor neighborhoods (12), or\nas geographers are fond of saying, geography matters. One\nexplanation suggests that poor neighborhoods create stress,\nespecially for African Americans. The day-to-day stresses of\nliving in areas with poor safety, violence, noise, and housing\ndecay create internal stresses that, in turn, lead to anxiety and\ndepression. Another view emphasizes that actual neighborhood\ndeprivation (i.e., too many bars and fast-food outlets and not\nenough quality supermarkets) creates the poor health that seems\nto characterize inner-city minority populations. At the same\ntime, much of the research concern in examining the role of\nneighborhood effects is to separate out the effects of neighbor-\nhood independent of family socioeconomic characteristics. This\nseparation is difficult because of the strong links between\nhousehold social class and neighborhood status: residents of\npoor neighborhoods are likely to be poor themselves. As middle-\nclass African-American households left inner-city neighbor-\nhoods, they left behind the most impoverished minority house-\nholds; it is these households who are often most affected by both\ntheir socioeconomic status and the neighborhoods that they\nlive in.\nIt is in this context that the mobility programs have directly\ninvestigated the actual effect of neighborhood on the outcomes\nfor those who move into new, more desirable neighborhoods. In\nbroad terms, the mobility programs have a central policy aim to\nmove households from perceived bad neighborhoods to per-\nceived good neighborhoods. Such studies have attempted to\nseparate the true effects of neighborhoods from the effects of\nfamilies or social networks on the outcomes (13). Tentative\nresults indicated that those who moved to suburban neighbor-\nhoods were more likely to be employed and experienced greater\nneighborhood safety.\nAt least some of the stimulus for the refocus on neighborhood\neffects was increasing concern with high poverty concentrations\n(14). Although why and how poverty concentrations arise remain\ncontested, there has been a consensus that the concentration of\nhouseholds with housing assistance in specific neighborhoods has\nnot only a negative life-course outcome for such households, but\nalso an overall neighborhood effect beyond the impacts on indi-\nvidual households. The increasing emphasis on geographically\ndispersing housing-subsidy recipients is thus based on the assump-\ntion that residence in concentrated poverty neighborhoods abets\nsocially dysfunctional behavior, or more simply, that poverty house-\nholds will do better outside of poverty neighborhoods (19). The\nevidence from an analysis of several studies supports the view that\noverall, participating tenants do gain from the dispersed moves.\nHowever, the gains seem to come not from the lower concentration\nof poverty per se but from the ``structural advantages of the\nsuburban areas, such as schools, public services, and job accessi-\nbility'' (13). Moreover, there is at least case-study evidence that the\nsuburbs may not be better locations for less educated job seekers\n(20). The case study of Boston concludes that residential dispersal\nalso is unlikely to be an effective strategy for removing spatial\nbarriers to access to employment for low-income workers. In terms\nof access to jobs, central cities still provide greater opportunities for\nthese workers.\nMobility, Poverty Dispersal, and Changing Neighborhoods\nThe concern with neighborhood effects on households crystal-\nlized around the notion that concentrated poverty generates\nnegative social effects and thus that reducing concentrated\npoverty, or dispersing concentrated poverty, would have positive\neffects on both individuals and neighborhoods (21). Households\nwill gain from their improved neighborhoods, and fewer poor\npeople in a single neighborhood will increase the social status of\nthe neighborhood and, by extension, perhaps make that neigh-\nborhood more attractive to potential in-movers. The ideas may\nnot yet have a solid theoretical basis (22), but they have led to\nsubstantial investment in measuring such outcomes; in particu-\nlar, three mobility programs have provided data to examine the\noutcomes of actual movement through urban neighborhoods.\nThe mobility programs are, in turn, a reflection of the\nchanging notions of how to provide housing to low-income\nhouseholds. Whereas once the focus was on providing specific\nprojects for low-income households in need of assisted housing,\nnow the emphasis is on giving low-income households a choice\nwithin the residential fabric. Whereas once the aim was to\nprovide help at fixed locations, now the Housing Voucher\nProgram, the largest assisted housing program within HUD,\naims to help households access housing in the private housing\nmarket. The Housing Choice Voucher program grew out of the\nExperimental Housing Allowance studies of the 1970s and was\nfirst initiated as the Section 8 Certificate program. In the 1980s,\nthe Housing Voucher Program was initiated, and the two\nprograms were merged as the Housing Choice Voucher program\nThe first of the evaluations of the effects of moving from a\nhigh-poverty neighborhood arose out of litigation over discrim-\nination in the provision of public housing. The outcome of the\nGautreaux decision in 1976 was to provide a metropolitan-wide\nmobility program in which Section 8 subsidies were provided to\nOn the one hand, several studies (15\u00ad17) emphasize the impact of macroeconomic\nstructural changes that have taken jobs away from the inner city and thus disadvantaged\ninner-city minority residents. On the other hand, there are studies that argue that the\nconcentrations of poverty are the outcomes of historic patterns of discrimination, includ-\ning the intentional citing of public housing in inner-city areas (18).\nNationally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has funded 1.26\nmillion public housing units, 1.4 million units in assisted housing programs, and 1.5 million\nhouseholds in the Housing Voucher Program (4).\npublic housing residents so that they could move from the inner\ncity of Chicago to suburban white communities. Studies of the\nGautreaux program provided some evidence that those who\nmoved to suburban communities were more likely to be em-\nployed (although the salaries were not necessarily higher) and\nthat suburban youth did better on several educational measures\n(23, 24). Although these findings could not be considered\nconclusive evidence in favor of such programs, they did offer\ninsights into the shape of a possibly successful program, one that\nwould require substantial additional housing services if the\nprogram were to succeed. At least one of the problems in\nassessing the Gautreaux program was the substantial dropout\nA more recent program was focused on the redistribution of\nlow-income public housing residents in Minneapolis and pro-\nvided some positive findings among the generally mixed out-\ncomes of the program (21). As part of a consent decree in\nMinneapolis, a large public family complex in the inner city of\nMinneapolis was demolished (25). The residents of that project\ncreated a substantial number of relocated households. An\nanalysis of the data from the Hollman case suggests several\nimportant findings for the study of how relocation from inner-\ncity minority neighborhoods will play out at the larger urban\nscale. Not all residents of the projects that were demolished were\nwilling participants in the relocation project; Southeast Asian\nhouseholds were much more resistant to forced relocation than\nwere African-American households. The study showed that\ndisplaced families did not want to move far away from their\nformer homes and most wanted to stay in Minneapolis (21).\nThose families who indicated a desire to leave the city preferred\nto move only to the inner ring of suburbs directly north of the\ncity. Preferences for familiar neighborhoods were especially\nstrong among the project residents.\nSpecial Mobility Program participants (a group specified in\nthe Hollman consent decree) were much more likely to move to\nthe suburbs, but the preference of most families (about half of\nparticipants) was to stay within Minneapolis. Moving to places\nnear to their original location was an important outcome of the\nintervention process. More than half of all participants (but 90%\nof Southeast Asian participants) in the Special Mobility Program\nstayed in the central city. For this group, neighborhood quality\ndid not change. Those families who moved out of central city\nneighborhoods gained in quality of living.\nSuch pilot mobility projects called for more systematic eval-\nuation, and the aim of the MTO program was to find out, in a\ncontrolled experiment, what happens when very poor families\nhave the chance to move out of subsidized housing in the poorest\nneighborhoods of large American cities (26). The program was\ninitiated in 1992 with a mandate from Congress to HUD to test\nthe usefulness of housing vouchers for generating moves away\nfrom low-poverty areas and into integrated residential settings.\nFive cities (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New\nYork) were selected to participate in the program. MTO divided\nvoucher holders into three groups. The control group did not\nreceive a voucher and initially continued to live in public or\nassisted housing. The Section 8 group received a voucher and\nregular housing assistance counseling. The experimental group\nreceived a voucher and special mobility counseling but was\nrequired to move to a low-poverty neighborhood (10% pov-\nThe most recent summary report of the MTO project (26)\nsuggests that the program has had substantial effects on housing\nand the neighborhood conditions of participants, especially on\nperceptions of safety, but mixed effects for educational gains,\nemployment, earnings, and public assistance. Two studies in\nprogress provide analyses showing that experimental households\nhad gains in perceived safety of the neighborhood and that they\nactually lived in safer neighborhoods (27, 28). But as we will see,\nalthough there are sometimes gains for those who moved, in the\ncontext of the whole sample, the results may not be quite so\npositive. Ensuing mobility, after the initial move, reiterates the\ngreat difficulty of intervening in the dynamic of household\nrelocation. As Tiebout (29) observed, households vote with their\nfeet, and decisions by governments are always embedded in the\ndynamic demography of the city. Households move again after\ntheir initial relocation, and those moves often undo the advan-\ntages of the initial residential move.\nThe strong gains in self-reported safety and housing quality for\nMTO and Section 8 movers must be offset with the mixed results\nwith respect to living in reduced-poverty neighborhoods. The\nfinal report states that MTO experimental members did not, on\naverage, spend much time in census tracts with lower poverty\nlevels, although there are differences in the neighborhood\ncharacteristics for the experimental group and the control group.\nIn addition, nearly half the MTO movers chose neighborhoods\nthat increased in poverty during the 1990s. Perhaps even more\ntelling, but consistent with our knowledge of mobility in general,\nsubsequent moves by the MTO group were often to neighbor-\nhoods like the ones they came from and, in some cases, back to\ntheir old neighborhoods. Once again, we can identify two forces\nat work, the changing demography of the city (increases in\npoverty in inner-city tracts as their demography changed), and\nhousing choices and preferences that favor known neighbor-\nhoods where there are friends, family, and support relationships.\nTo reiterate, the preliminary analyses of the MTO programs have\nneither focused in detail on the relocation behavior of households\nover time nor examined the extent to which assisted households\nhave been able to access more integrated residential environments.\u00a7\nBoth questions are relevant in light of discussions about using\nvouchers to improve neighborhood opportunities and, specifically,\nthe intent of the MTO program (following Gautreaux) to address\nthe residential segregation of minority households. Thus, the fol-\nlowing analysis focuses on these questions: Are there long-term\ngains from the MTO voucher program and especially increases in\nlevels of integration? The findings of this analysis reiterate (i) the\ndifficulty of intervening in the residential mobility process, (ii) the\ntendency of households, all other things being equal, to move to\nnearby neighborhoods, (iii) the constraints of moving to more\nexpensive neighborhoods for low-income households, and (iv) the\ndifficulty of creating greater residential integration through housing\nvouchers.\nResearch Questions and Analysis\nThe current research is built around three questions: What are\nthe differences in access to low-poverty neighborhoods between\ninitial and long-term residential relocations for assisted and\nunassisted households? What are the differences in accessing\nmore-integrated residential neighborhoods between initial and\nlong-term residential relocations for assisted and unassisted\nhouseholds? How do households who did not receive assistance\nfare in their housing-market decisions?\nThe Findings from Baltimore: Access to Low-Poverty Neighborhoods.\nExperimental movers (MTO movers) in Baltimore made signif-\nicant initial gains in entering lower-poverty neighborhoods in\ntheir first lease-up\u00b6 (Table 1). Of course, this outcome is to be\nexpected, because the program specifically required leasing in a\n\u00a7The reports also have tended to aggregate data across the five cities rather than examining\nindividual metropolitan outcomes.\n\u00b6``Lease up'' is the terminology to describe the process of successfully using the housing\nvoucher to rent a housing unit and move. The program was initiated and the sample\nselected in the period 1994\u00ad1997. To reiterate, there are three groups in the study:\nexperimental movers who are given a housing voucher and special counseling, regular\nSection 8 movers who are given a housing voucher, and the baseline or control group who\nare not provided with assistance.\nlow-poverty neighborhood. Whereas nearly all experimental\nmovers chose neighborhoods that were 20% poverty neigh-\nborhoods, only 23% of the regular Section 8 movers did so. The\nquestion that is central here is to what extent the experimental\nand Section 8 movers sustained the original gains after subse-\nquent moves. Households moved, and, of course, neighborhoods\nchange over time.\nThe outcomes at the current survey time (2002) are signifi-\ncantly more mixed in terms of the poverty levels of the neigh-\nborhoods in which the households live (Table 1). Several dif-\nferent comparisons are possible. The current distribution of the\nexperimental movers is somewhat like the current distribution\nfor the Section 8 movers; even so, the distributions are still\nsignificantly different from one another on a Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov two-sample test (P  0.01). That is, overall, experi-\nmental movers have a higher probability of being in a lower-\npoverty neighborhood than do regular Section 8 movers. When\nwe compare the distributions of the experimental movers in their\ninitial locations and their current locations, we find that the\ndistributions are significantly different from one another on both\n2 and Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov tests (P  0.01) We can conclude\nthat although there are initial gains, those gains decline over\ntime. Both additional moves and the changing dynamics of\nneighborhoods affect the ability to sustain the gains made\nthrough the original move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. The\ncontribution of this analysis is to demonstrate that initial gains\nare difficult to sustain. As I noted earlier, households do not stay\nput. They move as their life-course needs change, and those\nmoves may not sustain the initial gains made by moves to\nlow-poverty neighborhoods.\nAn additional issue is that not all households are able to use\ntheir vouchers and so do not move. A full test of the program\nshould set the gains for a subset of the sample moves in the\ncontext of all households. Only 58% of all experimental house-\nholds were able to lease up. Of those who were not able to use\nthe experimental voucher, a large number moved anyway. Reg-\nular Section 8 voucher holders, who were not constrained to\nchoose a low-poverty neighborhood, were more successful in\nfinding a unit. In Baltimore, 72% of the Section 8 group moved.\nIf we measure the success of the program by including house-\nholds who were not able to use the experimental voucher and\ncompare their distribution with regular Section 8 voucher hold-\ners, the differences across the distributions are quite minor. That\nis, the overall gains from the MTO program virtually disappear\n(Table 2). There is no significant difference between the MTO\nexperimental sample of movers plus nonmovers and the control\nsample, comprised of those who did not receive a voucher. There\nis no significant difference between experimental movers plus\nnonmovers and Section 8 movers plus nonmovers. In sum, the\nspecial counseling and extra effort to aid experimental movers\ndid not produce gains for the group as a whole, over and above\nthe gains for those who did not receive special help. Interestingly,\nthere is a marginally significant difference (at the P  0.05 level)\nbetween Section 8 movers and nonmovers and the control\nsample. Clearly, there are differences between movers and\nnonmovers as we would expect, but to truly evaluate the success\nof the voucher program, it is essential to consider the total\noutcome for those who were successful (in moving to a low-\npoverty neighborhood) and those who were not. It is trouble-\nsome for a policy of poverty dispersal that, overall, the current\ndistribution of control households, who received neither vouch-\ners nor experimental help, is only marginally more likely to show\nhouseholds in high-poverty neighborhoods than the aggregate of\nexperimental and control group movers.\nThe Findings from Baltimore: Access to Integrated Neighborhoods. An\nimplicit argument that grows out of the Gautreaux litigation was\nthat mobility would give minority families an opportunity to live\nin less segregated neighborhoods; the idea was that requiring\nfamilies to move to low-poverty neighborhoods also would result\nin desegregation. The title of the MTO program is, in fact,\n``Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Pro-\ngram,'' emphasizing the link of providing support to increase\naccess to integrated housing. In general, as reported by the latest\nMTO report, the program seems to have been only partially\nsuccessful in meeting this aim (26).\nA specific analysis of the effects of moving on racial patterns\nin Baltimore confirms the difficulty in using vouchers to increase\nracial integration. Much of the difficulty is that initial moves to\nmore integrated settings are not sustained over time. Although\nthe moves to integrated, sometimes suburban, neighborhoods\nseem to provide some evidence of more integrated settings for\nthose who could lease up, the patterns for the sample as a whole\nare not different for experimental (MTO) and regular Section 8\nmovers. Moreover, although the patterns of the experimental\nand Section 8 movers are visually different from the control\nsample, they are not visually different from one another (Fig. 1).\nAs for the discussion of access to low-poverty neighborhoods, the\nquestions that are central to any conclusion about outcomes are\n(i) whether there are distinct gains from the experimental\nprogram (above those for regular Section 8 voucher holders),\nand (ii) how do the gains for the MTO group compare with the\ncontrol group who did not receive help at all.\nBy evaluating the current patterns of residences for experi-\nmental and Section 8 voucher holders (after any subsequent\nmoves after the initial lease-up), we can evaluate the outcomes\nof the movement behaviors of the two groups.

Sample sizes are\nhouseholds who were able to find a unit in a low-poverty\nneighborhood are more dispersed and are somewhat more likely\nto live in suburban integrated neighborhoods (Fig. 1). There are\nsignificant numbers of MTO experimental movers in the western\nsuburbs of Baltimore County, and there are many experimental\nvoucher holders in the Baltimore City communities of Hamilton,\nMorgan Heights, and Lauraville (in the northeast sections of the\ncity). Similar results are apparent in the report on the MTO\nprogram from Abt Associates (26). Regular Section 8 moves also\nare widely distributed in the western suburbs and in the northeast\nsections of the city. Visually the patterns are quite similar.\nClearly, although the program had initial success, it is hard to\nsustain the patterns of dispersal. Many more MTO households\nare now located in Baltimore City at the end of the evaluation\nperiod. We can infer a return to familiar neighborhoods in the\ncity.**\nThe total MTO sample was comprised of self-selected house-\nholds who expressed a desire to move. Thus, it is not surprising\nto find that members of the control group, who were not given\nvouchers, also had significant mobility. In the five-city study, the\ncontrol group actually had higher mobility than did either the\nexperimental participants or the regular Section 8 participants\n(26). Their geographic mobility also emphasizes the housing\nopportunities available to all households, experimental and\nnonexperimental. Although many households in the control\ngroup moved nearby, some households also were able to move\nto neighborhoods in the northeastern communities of Baltimore\nCity and to the suburbs (Fig. 1). Still, the patterns are visually\ndifferent from the experimental and Section 8 movers.\nTable 3 shows that the initial moves of the MTO experimental\ngroup did result in greater integration. The pattern for Section\n8 movers shows less overall integration but still some gains in\nliving in less segregated settings. Examination of current resi-\ndential locations for MTO movers, however, reveals that these\ngains have been eroded (Table 3). There is no significant\ndifference between the current residence distribution for exper-\nimental movers and Section 8 movers. Both 2 and Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov two-sample tests failed to detect any difference between\nthe distributions of current residence locations for these groups.\nThat the Section 8 and MTO distributions are not statistically\ndifferent from each other suggests that, on the issue of racial\nintegration, we must treat the gains from the experimental\nprogram with some caution. Although the distributions for\nSection 8 movers and experimental movers are significantly\ndifferent from the control sample, overall the results reiterate\nthe difficulty of intervening in residential choice. Mobility\ndecisions are complex and are set within family, neighborhood,\nand work contexts.\nEven without vouchers and the special counseling of the MTO\nprogram, the control-sample households moved away from\nAn interim analysis of the total MTO program suggested that MTO movers were staying in\ntheir new communities (30).\n**The data on actual origins and destinations of the moves were not made available for this\nanalysis.\nFig. 1.

Census data for both initial location and current (2002)\nhousing projects in the inner city. Clearly, housing demolition in\nthe central city displaced some of these households, and in this\nsense, they were forced movers. In the past decade, 1,000\npublic housing units have been removed in Baltimore, and some\nof the residents in these projects were part of the control group.\nEven so, insofar as many of them made choices that are not\ndissimilar to the assisted households raises questions about the\npolicy effectiveness of the special subsidy MTO program.\nConclusion\nOverall, it seems that the special MTO program, although\npartially successful and clearly an indication of HUD's concern\nto find mechanisms for diffusing the geographic concentration of\nminorities, also is a telling indication of how difficult it is to\nintervene in the complex process of housing choice. Income and\nassets are critical and integral parts of the choice process, as are\nneighborhood composition preferences. Simply providing a\nhousing voucher does not negate the powerful forces of concerns\nwith neighbors, friends, and access to work in the choice process.\nNor does it negate a tendency, as we know from a large body of\nresearch on residential mobility, for households to move short\ndistances and often to neighborhoods with which they are\nfamiliar. The evidence of return to known and familiar neigh-\nborhoods is an indicator of the way in which housing choices are\nembedded in the larger urban structure. There are data, too, that\nnonmovers also make gains. Nonmovers with more time in the\ncommunity and the possibility of tapping into the opportunity\nstructure of the neighborhood are actually likely to have higher\nemployment rates than do movers (26). Perhaps unsurprisingly,\nmoving is not a simple solution to problems of poor families,\neven though the overall picture suggests gains from movements\nout of poverty areas.\nTo reiterate, the increasing emphasis on geographically dis-\npersing housing-subsidy recipients is based on the assumption\nthat residence in concentrated poverty neighborhoods abets\nsocially dysfunctional behavior, or more simply, that poverty\nhouseholds will do better outside of poverty neighborhoods.\nAlthough the tentative evidence points in this direction (i.e.,\noverall, participating tenants do gain from the dispersed moves),\nthe gains seem to come not from the lower concentration of\npoverty per se but from the ``structural advantages of the\nsuburban areas, such as schools, public services, and job acces-\nsibility'' (13). Clearly, neighborhood effects, to the extent they\nexist, are complex and not easily transferred to in-movers. There\nare real questions about whether we can see neighborhoods\nthemselves as socializing agents. Thus, the mere existence of a\ndispersed pattern of assisted households will not guarantee\nmoves out of poverty or success in the labor market.\nIn the most recent presentation of the results from the five\nsample cities, the review of the MTO program tends to be\nfavorable and positive. It is a natural response of the stakehold-\ners to find that, in general, the MTO treatment led to significant\ndifferences in where families moved with the program vouchers\n(ref. 26, p. 46). The conclusion that the differences had narrowed\nonly marginally over time may be an overly optimistic conclusion\nbased on the research in this paper. Although the mobility\npatterns of the experimental families may have placed them in\nsignificantly better environments than those of the control\ngroup, the lack of differences between experimental and regular\nSection 8 movers at their current locations raises questions about\nthe cost benefits of the intervention policy.\nI thank Susan Hanson and Benjamin Forest for their comments on\nearlier drafts of the paper.\n3.
