In this article, we use a PESTEL (politics, economics, society,\ntechnology, environment, and law) framework to identify significant current and future priorities in Australian healthcare.\nFollowing the PESTEL analysis, we conduct a review of the curriculum content of current Australian undergraduate pre-\nregistration nursing curricula. The data were analyzed to determine how nursing curricula were aligned with the priorities\nidentified in the PESTEL analysis. Findings suggest that preparation\u00adpractice gaps are evident in nursing curricula as the broad\npriorities identified were poorly reflected in undergraduate pre-registration programs. The study recommended (a) the\nestablishment of a nationally consistent mechanism to identify current and emerging trends in healthcare and higher education,\nand (b) an evidence-based framework that enhances forward planning in the design of undergraduate pre-registration nursing\ncurricula.\n",

Nursing must be a\nkey player if it is to continue to evolve and develop as a pro-\nfession. Nursing education, particularly at the level of under-\ngraduate pre-registration programs, will form a vital part in\ninforming the direction of the profession. Designing nursing\ncurricula to be proactive rather than reactive to future events\nis essential in future-proofing nursing education.\nNevertheless, the process of translating a myriad of contex-\ntual factors to inform future directions for nursing education\nis as difficult as it is necessary. This article proposes a means\nof future-proofing nursing education by incorporating cur-\nrent and emerging trends relevant to the Australia context\ninto curriculum design.\nBackground\nThe profession of nursing is influenced by a complex myriad\nof political, economic, social, technological, environmental,\nand legal factors. For instance, political machinations have\nheralded initiatives such as the 2010 launch of Australia's\nNational Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) to\nimprove health workforce mobility and offer a nationally\ncohesive and consistent approach to the registration of health\nprofessionals and accreditation of health curricula (NRAS,\n2012). The political agenda is closely associated with eco-\nnomic forces as governments struggle to ensure that health-\ncare expenditure is both effective and fiscally sustainable.\nBeyond politics and economics, the shifts in the social\nfabric of all nations are exerting influence on priorities in\nglobal healthcare. As westernized nations become healthier\nand live longer, significant challenges are expected to pres-\nent in the near future as an aging population, the demand for\nhealth services, and the identification of major health issues\nrelating to chronic illness become pressing areas of need.\nIn the Australian scene, technology continues to play a\ncentral role in addressing areas of need and easing some of\nthe challenges faced as the complexity of the healthcare envi-\nronment increases. Initiatives such as remote patient monitor-\ning and \"telehealth\" will become more commonplace\n1Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\n2James Cook University, Townsville, Australia\n3Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nNicholas Ralph, School of Nursing & Midwifery, Monash University,\nClayton Campus, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.\nEmail: nicholas.ralph@monash.edu\nFuture-Proofing Nursing Education:\nAn Australian Perspective\nNicholas Ralph1, Melanie Birks2, Ysanne Chapman1,\nand Karen Francis3\n Keywords\nnursing, education, future, curriculum, workforce, policy, accreditation\n2 SAGE Open\nmodalities of treatment in healthcare. Nevertheless, one\nchallenge that technology may not be able to overcome\noccurs in a broader, more concerning context--climate\nchange. Climate change is expected to have a significant\nimpact on health over the coming decades with a greater\nincidence of natural disasters and the endangerment of resi-\ndences and food and water supplies. This global issue has\nbeen identified as the most significant risk to health in the\n21st century by the World Health Organization (WHO;\nOngoing changes in broad global and national contexts\nraise questions about the position of nurses and nursing edu-\ncation and whether the legal framework of practice in which\nnurses operate should evolve with the same momentum that\nmarks healthcare. Health Workforce Australia (HWA) are\nworking toward expanding the professional roles of the cur-\nrent health workforce including advancing nursing practice\nthrough the use of nurse practitioners, promoting nurses and\nmidwives work to full scope of practice and the development\nof that career pathways that accommodate and promote prac-\ntice enhancement (Gallagher, Fry, & Duffield, 2010).\nSchober and Affara (2006) assert that advancing nursing\npractice is a global phenomenon. They highlighted that pro-\nmoting this reform agenda has required a global debate\nwithin and external to nursing (Barton, Bevan, & Mooney,\nand continues in Australia (Adrian, 2005; Nursing and\nIt is in this dynamic and complex environment that nurs-\ning operates; an environment that demands professional\nresponsiveness to factors, seemingly distanced from the pro-\nfession of nursing and nursing education. So much is clear;\nnursing and nursing education faces considerable challenges\nin light of the influence of political, economic, social, tech-\nnological, environmental, and legal factors both now and in\ncoming decades. With these matters at hand, an analysis of\ncurrent and emerging factors, extrinsic and intrinsic to nurs-\ning education, was undertaken to evaluate the alignment of\nundergraduate pre-registration nursing education with the\nfuture needs of Australian healthcare.\nMethod\nThe authors employed a two-phase process to (a) identify\nfuture directions of healthcare relevant to the nursing profes-\nsion using a PESTEL (politics, economics, society, technol-\nogy, environment, and law) analysis framework to categorize\nthe coded data, and (b) conduct a basic online survey of each\ndiscrete subject in every undergraduate pre-registration nurs-\ning curricula in Australia to assess the level of alignment\nwith the PESTEL results, nationally. Although other entry-\nto-practice pathways were considered for inclusion in the\nsurvey, the variability of entry points to graduate pre-\nregistration programs was considered to be a confounding\nfactor--particularly when pre-requisite requirements and\ncredits awarded for previous study are not routinely pub-\nlished in curriculum documents online.\nFirst Phase\nLiterature pertaining to the future directions of Australian\nhealthcare was retrieved such as strategic plans, future pro-\njections, white papers and annual government, and other rel-\nevant organizational reports (e.g., Australian Institute of\nHealth and Welfare [AIHW], Australian Nursing &\nMidwifery Accreditation Council [ANMAC], and HWA). A\nsearch of peer-reviewed literature from July 2001 to July\n2013 was conducted using Google Scholar, Medline,\nProQuest, and EBSCOHost. The following search terms\nwere entered: future health, future healthcare, future\nAustralia, future Australia health, future nurs*, future eco-\nnomic*, future politic*, future environ*, future population*,\nfuture, future politic*, future economic*, future soci*,\nstrateg* AND health AND Australia. Gray literature was also\nsearched with attention given to government reports and\nfuture projections.\nA PESTEL analysis framework has been utilized in\nmacro-environmental analyses (Gillespie, 2011) and in stra-\ntegic planning for future contingencies (Walsh, 2005).\nPESTEL is a mnemonic used to group factors in the macro-\nenvironment to enable the identification of general opportu-\nnities and risks that impact on future outcomes (Issa, Chang,\nenvironmental factors is especially valuable when used to\nunderstand how external influences, drivers, and hurdles\nimpact on a particular area of focus such as nursing educa-\ntion (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, & Pyle, 2011). As such,\nthe PESTEL analysis framework was used to codify and cat-\negorize current and emerging trends relevant to nursing edu-\ncation and the broader healthcare environment. Data were\nassigned a code and categorized according to their relevance\nto one or more PESTEL factors. Two authors, to ensure inter-\nrater reliability, assessed relevance. Where two authors were\nunable to agree on relevance, a third author was used to facil-\nitate agreement. Conceptual connections were made while\nanalyzing the data resulting in the development of categories\nwithin the PESTEL factors.\nSecond Phase\nA search was conducted of the Australian Health Practitioner\nRegulation Agency (AHPRA) website for Australian under-\ngraduate pre-registration nursing programs leading to regis-\ntration (AHPRA, 2012). The following search parameters\nwere entered: Profession--Nurse, Division--Registered\nNurse; Qualification Type--General; Country--Australia;\nCourse Type--Bachelor Degree. Ninety programs of study\nwere revealed with double-degrees, post-graduate programs,\nconversion courses were eliminated from the results. Where\nan institution offered more than one variation of an award,\nRalph et al. 3\nonly the primary program was included. Curricula from the\n34 institutions remaining were retrieved and subject titles,\nsubject synopses, and subject learning outcomes were\nobtained and analyzed to assess their alignment with the\nPESTEL analysis results from the first phase of the study.\nSubjects clearly addressing categories pertaining to the\nPESTEL analysis were assigned a code. Where subjects had\na non-descript title such as \"Nursing 1\" and a subject synop-\nsis or learning outcomes were not available, the data were\ncoded as invalid. A code was also assigned to subjects where\ninvestigation of title and/or content synopsis failed to clearly\nidentify a match with PESTEL categories (e.g., those that\nprovided foundational content only such as anatomy, physi-\nology, and pharmacology subjects).\nFindings\nFindings are presented according to the phases of the research\nprocess.\nFirst Phase\nClear categories were developed following coding and anal-\nysis of the data retrieved using the search terms. The data\nwere selectively coded for information relating to current\nand emerging trends in healthcare and higher education\n(Table 1).\nSecond Phase\nFollowing the completion of the PESTEL coding and analy-\nsis, an analysis of curricula was undertaken to align the con-\ntent of nursing programs with the results of the PESTEL\nanalysis undertaken in the preceding phase.\nThe analysis was performed to ascertain nursing students'\nquality of exposure to the future needs of the Australian\nhealthcare system. Seven hundred seventeen discrete sub-\njects were identified across all curricula sourced. Fifty-one\nsubjects were coded as invalid data leaving 666 discrete sub-\njects for analysis. Table 2 relates to the incidence of align-\nment between PESTEL categories and subject content.\nAlthough the overall percentage of subjects aligned with\nthe PESTEL analysis is indicative of the national emphasis\non the emerging requirements for future nursing practice, an\ninstitution-by-institution breakdown of curriculum content\nwas conducted to highlight the manner in which institutions\nprepare nursing students for future nursing practice. As such,\nPESTEL factors across institutional programs were graphed\nTable 1.

The\ntotal number of institutions offering undergraduate pre-\nregistration programs leading to registration was 34.\nDiscussion\nPolitics\nAlthough the findings have illustrated some clear challenges\nrelevant to the nursing profession, the political landscape in\nrelation to health is largely marked by reform. For instance,\nthe National Health Reform Agenda features principally in\nthe political macro-environment and offers insight into the\npresent path dependencies of Australian healthcare in the\nfuture. Reform is centered on targeting priority areas such as\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) health, remote\nand rural health outcomes and mental illness (AIHW, 2012).\nFurther attention is given to quality improvement measures\ndesigned to enhance access, efficiency, and performance\nsuch as improved access to dental care, public hospital\nadmission times, the establishment of national access targets,\nand the integration of strategies to embed prevention and\nearly intervention (Australian Government, 2010).\nStrengthened consumer engagement and voice is central to\nthis aspect of reform as the aim is to establish a healthcare\nsystem that is innovative, research centered, knowledge-led,\nand continuously improving (AIHW, 2012). Of note, is the\nreform agenda's focus on optimizing the health system for\nthe future as reference given to the need to respond to emerg-\ning challenges? Specifically, these challenges are seen as\nconnecting and integrating health and aged care services; the\narrival of the \"next generation\" of Medicare (Australia's\npublically funded healthcare service); creating an agile and\nself-improving health system for long-term sustainability\nusing data, information, and communication intelligently;\nimproving the funding design and strategic purchasing\nthroughout the system: all of which will be underpinned by a\nwell-educated modern, learning, and supported workforce\nThe political agenda in higher education since the Bradley\nReview (Australian Government, 2008) has provided impe-\ntus for structural reform, increased funding and improved\nquality, equity, and access. Concurrent to reforms in the\nhigher education; the healthcare sector has focused on build-\ning a sustainably funded, nationally unified, and locally con-\ntrolled health system to achieve the goals of improving\naccessibility to health services and enhancing performance,\ntransparency, and accountability (Australian Government,\nDepartment of Health and Ageing, 2010). Although time has\nnot revealed the full effect of reform and its relationship to\nnursing and nursing education, the national trajectory of\npolitical direction is apparent. In optimizing the health sys-\ntem for the future, there is an expectation that health econom-\nics, health informatics, technology, health systems, quality\nimprovement, performance, and care coordination will be\nfeatured more in undergraduate nursing education (ANMAC,\nRegistered nurses (RNs) will also need knowledge and\nexperience in complex care, community, primary, and sub-\nacute health contexts as well as possess expert communica-\ntion, teamwork, leadership, and coordination skills\n(Australian Government, 2010). Given the emerging priori-\nties in education and health, it is certain that nursing educa-\ntion will need to be reviewed with renewed emphasis placed\non ensuring programs of education are inclusive of the key\npriorities of reform. Already, changes are evident in pre-reg-\nistration nursing education with the expectation that all cur-\nricula will include leadership and management, globalization\nof healthcare, and advanced level of clinical knowledge\nskills (HWA, 2012a). Embedding the political agenda as an\ninformant of nursing education is essential to ensuring the\ncongruency of direction for nursing education nationally.\nPolitical agendas globally impact on health workforce\nrecruitment and retention initiatives and drive education and\nRalph et al. 5\ntraining reform. The WHO, for example, responded to the\nidentified global shortage of health professionals by devel-\noping a framework for action titled Transformative Scale Up\nof Health Professional Education (International Council of\ntive heralded the need for changes to the education of health\nprofessionals and argued for the alignment of curricula with\ncommunity needs, promoted the strengthening of graduates\nsocial accountabilities, and advocated the use of enhanced\nteaching technologies (WHO, 2011). The International\nCouncil of Nurses (ICN) Nursing Education Network in\n2010 reported on the global nursing and health professional\nshortage highlighting the international trend for entry to\npractice for RNs at the bachelor's degree level with a move\nfrom 3- to 4-year baccalaureate degrees (International\nCouncil of Nursing Education Network, 2013).\nThe implications of the political agenda for nursing edu-\ncation in Australia point to a healthcare sector undergoing\nsignificant changes, where clear service priorities are\naddressed in a more efficient, streamlined, performance\ndriven system. The Australian Government predicts that RNs\nwill need to prioritize knowledge and experience in complex\ncare, community, primary, and sub-acute health contexts as\nwell as expert communication, teamwork, leadership, and\ncoordination skills (Australian Government, 2010). Whether\nthere will be a gap between the preparation of nurses and the\nrealities of practice in the future remains to be seen; however,\nthe identification of different models of nursing education by\nleading bodies such as the ICN is a sign that structural\nchanges are at the very least, being considered. Although a\n4-year degree might appear an attractive solution, a better\nstrategy might be to first explore what a generalist philoso-\nphy of education entails. Such an option may involve more\nprudent, evidence-based insertions of content into pre-\nregistration curricula rather than simply extending the prepa-\nration over a longer period of time.\nEconomics\nIn recent years, the economics of Australian society and\nAustralian healthcare have changed immensely. The global\nfinancial crisis has offered a timely reminder that economic\nforces ultimately influence the fiscal situation of any coun-\ntry, developed or otherwise. Healthcare is an expensive\nendeavor for any government, particularly those that fund\nnational health schemes (Heller, Oros, & Durney-Crowley,\n2014). In the coming years, the impact of economic forces\nwill have an evident influence on the health of Australians.\nKirigia, Nganda, Mwikisa, and Cardoso (2011) contend that\nthere is significant evidence indicating that economic\nFigure 1. PESTEL factors across institutional programs.\n6 SAGE Open\ndownturns result in reduced spending on healthcare, ulti-\nmately leading to poorer health outcomes with the most vul-\nnerable most at risk.\nChiefly, the rising cost of healthcare is of great concern to\nthe sustainability of funding the health system. Furthermore,\nthe health workforce is growing exponentially with a 26%\nalthough the workforce is still experiencing shortages, par-\nCommission, 2005). Also contributing to rising healthcare\nexpenditure are key cost drivers such as an emerging empha-\nsis to educate and train even more health workers to ade-\nquately staff the health workforce not to mention the costs of\nconcertedly addressing national health priority areas relevant\nto chronic disease, injury, and mental health (AIHW, 2012).\nAsustainably funded health system is top priority for all gov-\nernments and health funding has become a contentious issue\nglobally as well as nationally (Henry, Harmer, Piggot,\nRidout, & Smith, 2009). The reality is that health funding is\nat a critical point and the Australian government continues to\nhotly debate its future. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that\nnurses will be central role-players in this environment as the\nrollout of local activity-based funding models are introduced\nacross the nation (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority\n[IHPA], 2011). At an educational level, ANMAC have an\nexpectation that nursing education will increasingly address\nthe cost drivers of healthcare (ANMAC, 2012). The educa-\ntional imperative for nurses to develop economic literacy is\nfoundational to charting a course for a future in which the\nvalue of nurses is understood. In addition, the advancing\npractice agenda for nursing is a means of addressing other\nhealth professional number deficits. As nurses represent the\nlargest proportion of the health workforce (HWA, 2012a)\nand are a more stable workforce, investing in up-skilling the\nprofession is an economically savvy strategy, albeit one\nwhich is an untested assumption.\nThe cost of such a sizable nursing workforce--despite its\nshortages--is clearly problematic. Given that nurses are now\nfinancially recognized as a tertiary-educated, highly special-\nized profession there is--and will increasingly be--a clear\npolitical and economic expectation across the nation that\ntheir role in the healthcare system is filled rather than merely\noccupied. As the acuity of hospital care rises and moves\ntoward enhancing the delivery of early intervention strate-\ngies to prevent the progression of illness via health promo-\ntion and primary healthcare, the nursing profession must\nbecome more specialized, expert, and lead increasingly com-\nplex care pathways in a technologically orientated setting.\nThese issues raise the question of size in the nursing\nworkforce and whether at current levels, nurses are a sustain-\nable entity. Questions should be asked about the position of\nthe nursing profession in the health system and whether\nworkforce growth has continued through a belief that the\nprofession can be all things to all people. Further concern is\nfound in the up-skilling of second- and third-level nurses to\ntake on traditional RN roles; a situation that represents fiscal\nconstraint at all costs. Although advancing the baccalaure-\nate-educated RN workforce may be a costly exercise on the\nface of it, in reality, the result is a cost efficiency given the\nlower mortality rates comparative to settings where patients\nwere cared for by non-baccalaureate educated nurses (Aiken\net al., 2014). To this end, finding a way forward is essential\nfor the nursing profession as it must avoid a situation that\nsees a decision-by-proxy made regarding future directions of\nnursing education in Australia. A recent international study\nexamined the impact of patient to nurse ratios and nurse\nqualifications on risk adversity and patient outcomes in hos-\npital settings. The findings confirmed that an increase in\nnurse workloads by one patient increased the likelihood of an\ninpatient dying within 30 days of admission (Aiken et al.,\nSociety\nIn Australia, a number of social trends are emerging that\nwill impact on the direction of nursing education across\nthe nation. Primarily, the growth in Australia's population\nnificant increase in the demand for health services\n(Australian Government, 2010). Heightened demand will\ncoincide with an environment where the acuity of hospital\nadmissions is intensifying as is the complexity of service\ndelivery in the aged care sector (Productivity Commission,\n2008). In particular, the nursing workforce requires a dou-\nbling of graduate completions to cope with expected\ndemand (Australian HealthWorkforceAdvisory Committee\n[AHWAC], 2004). Demand for hospital bed days is pro-\njected to grow faster and be increasingly allocated to older\nAustralians with peak demand occurring as the baby\nboomer cohort pass into old age (Schofield & Earnest,\nAnother emerging priority is that of Australia's aging\npopulation with more than 23% of the nation expected to be\nlations are a global phenomenon (Lutz, Sanderson, &\nScherbov, 2008) forcing nations to reprioritize the focus of\nhealth policy, expenditure, and service delivery (National\nResearch Council (US) Panel on a Research Agenda and\nThe AIHW contend that an aging population will require fur-\nther attention from healthcare services and extend an already\nstretched aged care sector (AIHW, 2012). Practically, people\nliving longer will see a trend toward briefer periods of mor-\nbidity prior to death meaning the onset of illness to death will\nbe shorter than it is a present. Some perceive this trend as\nleading to an offset in health expenditure across the lifetime\nresults, the need to urgently expand the health workforce is\napparent. In particular, enhancing the aged care workforce to\nremediate the age-induced tightening of the labor market and\ncompetition from the hospitals sector is a priority\nRalph et al. 7\nAlthough the current system can be applauded, it is not\nwithout its challenges. In some areas, significant improve-\nments have been made such as the reduction in smoking rates\nwhile action is needed in improving the health of ATSI peo-\nple (AIHW, 2012). Of great concern are the nine National\nHealth Priority Areas identified, namely, arthritis and osteo-\nporosis, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,\ninjury, mental health, obesity, and dementia (Australian\nGovernment, 2012). That arthritis, asthma, cancer, cardio-\nvascular disease, dementia, diabetes, and obesity do not fea-\nture in the subject titles, subject synopses, or learning\noutcomes of over half of the 34 nursing programs inAustralia\nis a significant concern. That mental health features in 57\ndiscrete courses is an oddity given the mortality and morbid-\nity more strongly associated with other national health prior-\nity areas. Historically, mental health has always attracted the\nattention of a discrete subject; however, if the relics of the\npast are informing our planning for the future, the founda-\ntions on which nursing education is built are treacherous at\nthe least.\nPart of the response to build a workforce for the future\nwill be to approach healthcare through building partnerships\nwith the wider community, which was championed as the\nafford health consumers more choice and to make health\ninformation more accessible and translatable to the wider\npublic is essential because demand for services is projected\nto rise (Koch, Nay, Mcauliffe, & Koch, 2008). Although\nsome may express unease that social action smacks of social\nengineering, the nurse has a responsibility to do what they\ncan to improve the health of society and address health\ninequalities (Marmot, Allen, Bell, & Goldblatt, 2011; WHO,\n2011). By functioning as natural attorneys of a nation's\nhealth, partnerships between nurses and citizens must be\nestablished in the continuum of decision-making processes\nwhere the delivery of healthcare is concerned. The main-\nstream healthcare system must effectively extend its acces-\nsibility to those living in outer metropolitan, rural, and\nremote areas and in indigenous communities (Productivity\nDespite efforts to enhance access to health services, the\nmeans of achieving this goal are unclear as the future of the\nnursing profession is marked by significant projected work-\nforce shortages that could impede any meaningful response.\nThe nursing workforce is experiencing shortages that are\nprojected to worsen despite significant increases in graduate\nnumbers and an increasing reliance on overseas-trained\nhealth workers to overcome shortfalls (HWA, 2012a;\nProductivity Commission, 2005). The shortages are even\nmore acute in rural and remote areas and in certain special\nIn this context, nursing feasibly has three options: (a) con-\ntinue on its current trajectory, (b) massively increase student\nintake in undergraduate pre-registration programs, or (c)\nredefine the nursing role to that of a highly specialized, more\nfocused profession. In view of present and emerging chal-\nlenges, nursing might not be able to provide expertise in as\nmany contexts as it presently does. These options contrast\nwith the position of the Council of Deans of Nursing and\nMidwifery (2005) who state that the nursing shortage can\nonly be addressed by changes to workplace relations and\nconditions. Given the lack of discussion around the future of\nnursing and nursing education, any decisions may well be\ncolored by politically expedient quick fixes to workforce\nshortages rather than a serious debate on the strengths and\nlimitations of the nursing workforce nationally.\nFundamentally, the Australian nursing profession must\ndecide whether they wish to be seen politically and profes-\nsionally as a highly expert, tertiary-educated profession or\nwhether they wish to be seen as a political quick-fix to\nnational workforce shortages. Whatever the course, nursing\neducation will be central to shaping the future foci of the\nprofession and defining the extent and scope of the nursing\nrole in a healthcare system confronting significant emerging\nand future challenges.\nTechnology\nCentral to the future directions of healthcare nationally is the\nwidespread acceptance that technology will play a crucial\nrole in the success of implementing reform and enhancing\nefficiency, safety, and the continued sustainability of health-\ncare in Australia (Banks, 2008). Already, significant move-\nments toward the \"technologification\" of healthcare are\nhappening in response to the increasing expectations that\nAustralians have toward healthcare accessibility (FitzGerald\n& Ashby, 2010). At a national level, geo-tagging the health\nof Australians is informing the creation of an Australian\nDiabetes Map, while \"big data\" projects such as the Western\nAustralian Data Linkage system are influencing the delivery\nof state-based healthcare by informing approaches to\nresearch, planning, and evaluation through the identification\nof health trends within the population (\"Australia's Digital\nThe role of technology as an efficient connecting inter-\nface between clinician and consumer is foundational to the\npartnerships that must be built to enhance the accessibility\nand effectiveness of healthcare throughout Australia. Central\nto this process is the requirement for investments to be made\nin developing the technological skills of the health work-\nforce along with the improving the quality of models of care\nused in a technology centric environment (Banks, 2008) and\nof renewing required infrastructure. Given the continued\nreliance on manual processes and information flows in a sys-\ntem that daily reports 342,000 visits to general practitioners,\ntal admissions, and 17,000 emergency department presenta-\nopportunity to utilize technology to reduce errors and system\ninefficiencies is an exciting prospect.\n8 SAGE Open\nClearly, technology will play a significant role in the\nfuture delivery ofAustralian healthcare with emphasis placed\non information sharing, developing service delivery tools\nand providing meaningful health information sources for cli-\nnicians and consumers (National E-Health Strategy, 2008).\nTechnological literacy will center on ways of improving\ninformation flows between care providers to provide a foun-\ndation for enhancing care planning, coordination and deci-\nsion making at the point of care. Already in the current\ntechnological environment, healthcare practitioners are able\nto send digitized medical images of patient records to where\nthe patient is. Such records are now stored online and net-\nworked throughout the facility giving clinicians opportunity\nto check and update patient information anywhere in the\nfacility at any time (\"Australia's Digital Economy: Future\nDirections,\" 2009). Technology literacy will be central to\nenhancing clinical decision making to reduce adverse events,\nor enable timely identification and monitoring of care needs\n(National E-Health Strategy, 2008). At its most advanced,\nthis concept embraces the detection and treatment of disease\nthrough technological advances (National E-Health Strategy,\n2008), while the pragmatic side of service delivery tools\nleads to the integration of evidence-informed knowledge in\nthe care process using technology (Pfeiffer, 2009).\nAlthough it is an expectation that graduates are able to use\ninformation systems, preparing nurses for the technological\ncontexts in which they will work does not feature in many\ncurricula. Axley (2008) reported that there has been a rapid\nexpansion of the use of technology in healthcare in the\nUnited States and highlighted that nursing curriculum has\nnot kept pace with this phenomenon. She asserted that skill\nlevels of academic staff teaching nursing students was a bar-\nrier to technology featuring in nursing curriculum (Axley,\n2008). The digital age is a feature of the 21st century (Heller\net al., 2014) and mandates that educators adopt new practices\nin preparing nursing students for the realities of the work-\nplace (Simpson, 2011). Johns Hopkins University School of\nNursing introduced electronic patient records as a feature of\ntheir simulating learning spaces and teaching techniques fol-\nlowing recognition that their program was failing to prepare\nstudents adequately for practice as graduate nurses (Birz,\n2005). Whatever the solution, answers to any lack of techno-\nlogical literacy in nursing will likely focus on enhancing the\nabilities of students and staff in becoming more adept at\nresponding to increasingly technologically demanding con-\ntexts of care.\nEnvironment\nThe broader environment in which we live has and continues\nto have a profound impact on the healthcare of allAustralians.\nAt a global level, climate change and health is inextricably\nlinked as it will bring changing patterns of disease, natural\nresource insecurity, extreme weather events, and population\ngrowth and migration (Costello et al., 2009; Hughes &\nMcMichael, 2011). Environmental events will likely drive an\nemphasis on building capacity in the nursing profession to\nrespond to natural disasters, vector-borne illnesses; food\nshortages and occasions when infrastructure breakdowns\nCatastrophic events will not require a team of disaster nurses\nbut huge numbers of the nursing workforce to provide a suf-\nficient response to the situation and maintain appropriate\nlevels of operation on the \"home front.\" Already Pacific\nIslanders are seeing the effects of global warming and com-\nmunities are preparing for eventual evacuation and conse-\nquent destruction of their societies. As a leading nation in the\nPacific region,Australia will be central to the regional expec-\ntations of our neighbors as the first responder in times of\ncrisis. As the future will be characterized by deepening\nstresses between human activities and wider ecosystems\n(Henry et al., 2009), some of the onus for responding to the\nimpacts of climate change will fall to nurses. It will therefore\nbe necessary for nurses to develop environmentally con-\nscious curricula in view of such looming stressors in the\nform of disaster nursing. Given the geographically distrib-\nuted nature of the workforce--the relative number of health\nprofessionals other than nurses diminishes as the distance\nfrom cities increases (Productivity Commission, 2005)--it is\ncritical to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the\navailable health workforce, and to improve its distribution if\nnursing is to position itself as a responsive, mobile, highly\nexpert profession central to the health of the nation.\nLaw\nThe presiding dominance of the medical profession over\nmany elements of the healthcare system and by implication,\nthe nursing role, needs to be strongly questioned. Although\nmedicine has and continues to answer vital questions with\nrespect to the future context of healthcare, its undue influ-\nence on nursing and nurses'scope of practice is limiting. It is\nan unfortunate state of affairs when it is recognized that nurs-\ning role extension usually occurs as nursing knowledge and\nroles develop. Role extension has occurred as a mechanism\nfor medical staff shortages in rural and remote areas; in\nresponse to changes in models of care; and as a means of\nanswering unmet patient needs requiring different skills; and\nin reaction to the introduction of new technology (Duffield,\nGardner, Chang, Fry, & Stasa, 2011).Any expansion in scope\nof practice may present complex legal and ethical dilemmas;\nhowever, nurses should not act as a stopgap to limitations in\nthe service delivery capacity of the medical profession\n(Linsley, Kane, Mckinnon, Spencer, & Simpson, 2008).\nNevertheless, the versatility of the profession is such that\nnurses assume the function of stopgaps with regularity. The\npremise of teaching nurses their legal and ethical obligations\nin the context of the health system (ANMAC, 2012) should\nbe expanded to include their responsibility to agitate for leg-\nislative reform to legitimate the development and expansion\nRalph et al. 9\nof the nursing role in Australia. At a fundamental level, the\nchallenges ought to be addressed with the patient as the cen-\nter of care while acknowledging the basic right of access to\nhealthcare for all Australians (Bennett, 2009).\nFurthermore, nurses can no longer hide behind the tradi-\ntional hierarchical dominance of the medical profession as\nprotection from civil or criminal legal action. The pursuit for\nprofessional status has brought with it an accountability that\nsees nurses liable for actions performed as part of the normal\nscope of their professional role. If we are to respond to the\nmultiplicity of health priorities in Australia while ensuring\nthe integrity of our professional identity, we must start with\nthe basics and empower a new generation of nurses to be\nlegally and politically savvy. Legal impetus for the establish-\nment of a future direction for the professional position must\nstart at educating nurses so as to prevent the passive attitude\nthat has led to legal restrictions being placed on nurses'scope\nof practice. We must recognize that legally, the profession\ncannot optimally facilitate the transformation of healthcare\nin the future while being dominated by the legal restrictive-\nness that ties the nursing role to a level subordinate of medi-\ncine or any other health profession. Whether nursing\neducation can be tailored to form the foundations of such\nlegal impetus, transformative of the nursing role is unknown.\nWithout doubt, it must at least be attempted.\nLimitations\nThe main limitation in this study related to the diversity of\nquantity and quality of publically available information per-\ntaining to pre-registration nursing curricula. Differences in\nthe minimum information requirements of course profiles,\nobjectives, and synopses among higher education providers\nmay have limited the analysis, as it is difficult to determine\nthe coverage of PESTEL factors in teaching resources out-\nside of formalized curriculum documents. Nevertheless,\nwhen factors such as national health priorities are prescribed\nby the national accreditation standards (ANMAC, 2012) yet\nnot included in available program information, it opens up\nthe possibility for preparation\u00adpractice gaps within under-\ngraduate pre-registration nursing programs.\nRecommendations\nAlthough solutions to any complex problems are often clear,\nsimple, and wrong, we propose a number of recommenda-\ntions to address the issues raised in this article:\n1. Anationally consistent approach is needed to system-\natically identifying current and emerging trends\nimpacting on healthcare and higher education,\nincluding a means of interpreting their relevance to\nundergraduate pre-registration nursing education\nprograms.\n2. An evidence-based framework should be imple-\nmented that can facilitate undergraduate pre-registra-\ntion nursing curriculum design to future proof the\ncurrent system of nursing education. The framework\nwould cater to the modification of curricula only\nwhere it is relevant to verifiable current and emerging\ntrends; congruent with the nursing role; in keeping\nwith the generalist philosophy of nursing education;\nand according to the priorities of health consumers'\nneeds.\nConclusion\nThe nursing profession must--if it is to successfully transi-\ntion into the 21st century--decide what nursing education\nand indeed nursing, needs to be. The belief that nurses can\nbe all things to all people is unrealistic. The expectations of\npolitical, economic social, technological, environmental,\nand legal agendas are centered on nursing evolving into a\nhighly educated, expert, specialized, mobile, well-remuner-\nated nursing workforce. En masse, such an ideal is not\nfinancially sustainable. Philosophically, a shift away from\nanything else but role extension professionally, is anathema\nto the core reasons for shifting nursing into the university\nsphere of education. The array of confusing, paradoxical,\nand inconsistent approaches to undergraduate pre-\nregistration nursing programs is evidence of a profession\nunsure of itself and largely unaware of how to establish a\nsystem of quality education that underpins a quality profes-\nsion. In this context, the sensibility of a nationally consis-\ntent approach to nursing seems apparent. As a new system\nof national accreditation is ushered in, the time is right to\nestablish a cogent strategy founded in the national domain\nthat offers solutions to nursing's position in the Australian\nhealthcare context. As little and as much is necessary if we\nare to ensure that the future-proofing of nursing education\ninAustralia is a successful process. Ensuring thatAustralia's\nnursing workforce is well prepared to meet the demands of\nthe future may mean either extending the minimum course\nlength or enhancing the decision making around what con-\ntent should be included. Investing in post-graduate educa-\ntion of nurses and development of an appropriate career\npathway will support alignment of the workforce capacity\nwith national need. Curriculum content must be nationally\nand globally relevant to future-proof nursing education in\nAustralia.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdrian, A.
