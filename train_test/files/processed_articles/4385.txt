While Taylor argues for\n`ethical vegetarianism' from a position that a meat-based diet is `morally problematic',\nwith vegetarianism as a `proof of human superiority' (Taylor, 2010: 75), recent events in\ncontemporary India problematize both these notions.\nIn India, the term `non-vegetarian' is used to describe those consuming either egg, fish,\nmeat or any combination of these (Gulati and Verma, 2016), and though milk is from an\nanimal source, milk and its products are consumed by those who define themselves as\n`vegetarians'.1 As Arunima remarks, `[t]he neologism \"non-vegetarian\", created by vegetar-\nian India itself speaks volumes, and makes the country possibly the only one in the world\nwhere meat is not called by its name! Consequently, the normative status of vegetarianism is\nreinforced by rendering meat nameless, and by reducing it to a depleted \"non\" of vegetables'\n(Arunima, 2014: unpaged, para 2). This is indicative of the power wielded by vegetarians in\nIndia who form a minority of the population.2 For instance, an authoritative study com-\npleted in 1993 by the Anthropological Survey of India found that 88% of the population\ncomprised `meat eaters' (Pathak, 1993).3 However, the category `non-vegetarian' is not a\nhomogenous entity because it is not accessibility and availability alone, but cultural factors \u00ad\ncaste and religion being chief among them \u00ad that determine which flesh foods are consumed\nby a particular social group. Among these, the taboo within the Hindu religion against the\nconsumption of cow's flesh which, in the 19th century, was used as a rallying point during\nthe nationalist mobilization in northern India (Sarkar and Sarkar, 2016), has now assumed\ncentre stage in contemporary debates.4\nIt was in 1949 at the time of Indian independence that a provision against slaughtering of\ncows, calves, and other milch and draught cattle was written in the Directive Principles of\nState Policy.5 Although its inclusion was very much linked to the upper caste Hindu reli-\ngious sentiment with regards to the sanctity of the cow, the wording, bowing to modernity,\nwas couched in the language of science. Following this, as it was deemed to be a `state'\nsubject, the law on slaughter of cattle varied in the different states in India, ranging from a\ntotal ban to slaughter of animals no longer considered useful. Currently, under the\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule at the centre, a party that subscribes to Hindu national-\nism (Harriss, 2016), a more comprehensive ban, broadened to cover bulls and bullocks, is\nbeing operationalized in the states where the BJP is in power, and there is an increase in the\nquantum of punishment for violating the law (Bahl and Purkayastha, 2015).6 Not only that,\neven the possession of beef is considered a crime punishable by imprisonment by the police\nforce in Maharashtra \u00ad a state that has one of the most stringent laws against slaughter \u00ad\nwho are provided with a meat detection DNA kit to test whether the meat is that of a cow or\nnot (Shaikh, 2017).7 Emboldened by the support provided by the BJP, the country is also\nwitnessing extra-legal actions carried out by the right-wing Hindu fundamentalist groups,\nwith increasing incidence of violence against those who are traditionally known to consume\nbeef. However, the emerging militant cow vigilantism has targeted one particular religious\ncommunity with a study showing that since 2010, 86% of those who were lynched by the\nHindu gau rakshaks (cow protectors) were Muslims, with 97% of these attacks taking place\nafter the year 2014 when the BJP came to power at the centre (Abraham and Rao, 2017).\n2 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)\nContrary to popular belief, beef-eating is prevalent amongst most religions including\nHinduism, and forms an important part of the regional cuisine, as in, for instance, the\nstates of Kerala and Meghalya. Hence, the slaughter ban which imposes the dietary norm\nof a minority social group on all its citizens, varyingly termed as food fascism (Biswas, 2017)\nor culinary apartheid (Masoodi, 2016), has triggered counter-movements in the country.8\nAt the forefront of these struggles are students' groups in universities, political parties, and\nordinary citizens (Avenshi Centre for Women's Studies, 2012; Ehsan, 2015; Express News\nspaces have been disrupted by vigilantes, police or are disallowed by the Court citing law\nand order problems (Press Trust of India, 2012).

Drawing upon an ethnographic study conducted over fifteen\nmonths in a village in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the paper looks at the place of flesh\nfoods, including beef, in the everyday lives of people, and questions the concept of a nor-\nmative `Indian diet' and how the politics of food plays out at the `peripheral' level.\nThis paper argues that contrary to the notion that vegetarianism is morally superior, in\nthe context of Hinduism, where vegetarianism is a marker of upper caste identity, the food\nhierarchy is a function of the caste structure. Hence the protests, particularly from the\nformer `untouchable' caste groups, reclaiming their right to eat transgressive foods as a\nmarker of their identity, poses a serious challenge to upper caste hegemony. The violence\nwhich `vegetarian' India has unleashed on such transgressions has laid open the structural\nviolence embodied in the caste system and questions its claim to moral superiority.\nIndia, a vegetarian nation?\n`Like many large tropical countries, India is characterised by a complex mosaic of distinct\nagro-ecosystems, differentiated by its climatic, soil, geological, vegetational, and other nat-\nural features' (Kothari, 1994). The country's food culture reflects this diversity, differing\nfrom region to region, having evolved over millennia, shaped by local availability and mode\nof production. Though meat consumption was and continues to be very much part of this\nmulticultural cuisine, the popular notion that the pan-Indian diet is vegetarian could per-\nhaps be traced to the time of the colonial rule. The largely plant-based diet of the Indians\nwas a contrast to the British colonizers' flesh-based diet, a marker of their `exotic' status as\noutsiders (Arnold, 1994: 3). However, it was in the 1860s, `driven by two areas of colonial\nconcern \u00ad famines and prisons', that the first systematic documentation of food\nSathyamala 3\nconsumption among this population was carried out (Arnold, 1994: 5). Hence, it was the\nfood culture of the deprived, one that was almost all cereal, that came to be seen as the\nnormative `Indian' diet and pronounced as inferior to the Western meat-based diet. It was\nalso pronounced as the source of subjugation of the Indian people (Nitti, 1896: 31).\nMcCarrison, an Army physician who had set up a nutrition research laboratory in south-\nern India in 1918, added to this notion by observing that the reason for the poor physique that\n`characterized' the average Bengali or south Indian was due to their inadequate protein diets\ncontaining little milk, milk products, and meat because `by religion. . . [they were] often a non-\nmeat-eater' (McCarrison as quoted in Walker, 2002: 107). In India, this piece of nutritional\nthinking, that foods sourced from animals were essential components of a healthy diet, met\nwith serious opposition from Gandhi, a vocal proponent of vegetarianism who wrote\n[m]edical opinion is mostly in favour of a mixed diet, although there is a growing school, which\nis strongly of the opinion that anatomical and physiological evidence is in favour of man [sic]\nbeing a vegetarian. His teeth, stomach, intestines, etc. seem to prove that nature has meant man\nGandhi had initially succumbed to the power of Western nutrition science and had sub-\nscribed to the thinking that consumption of `[meat] would make [him] strong and that, if the\nwhole country took to meat eating the English could be overcome' and tried experimenting\nwith consuming goat meat for almost a year (Gandhi, 1949: 7). However, born in a vege-\ntarian household he was unable to overcome his distaste and guilt in deceiving his parents,\nfrom whom he had hidden his meat consumption. It was when he was in London, trying to\nlive up to a vow he made to his mother not to consume flesh foods under any circumstance,\nthat he found in Henry Salt's 1886 book, A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays, the\nmoral basis as well a scientific rationale for his `hereditary behaviour' of vegetarianism.\nWhile, according to Arnold (1994), Gandhi's rejection of flesh foods in his formulation of a\n`swadeshi' diet was to be seen as a part of his wider struggle against Western dominance, for\nGandhi, it was a spiritual quest as well.13 Gandhi linked his vegetarian morality, based on\n`scientific thinking' from a Western source, to the concept of ahimsa (non-violence) and\ndeclared that the `only basis for having a vegetarian society and proclaiming a vegetarian\nHowever, his knowledge about the dietary behaviour of Indians appeared narrow. For\ninstance, while addressing the London Vegetarian Society in November 1931, he remarked\nthat he belonged to a country that was predominantly vegetarian by habit or necessity\nHindu sensibility was particularly outraged at the consumption of beef, and it was the\n'untouchable' caste groups which became the target for his reformist propaganda as they\nwere the ones who openly consumed the flesh of cow.15 It was left to Ambedkar, born of this\n'untouchable' caste group, to show how it was that the food hierarchy among the Hindus,\nspecifically beef consumption, provided the material basis of the unjust caste system.\nFood hierarchy and the caste system\nEven a superficial view of the food taboos of the Hindus will show that there are two taboos\nregarding food which serve as dividing lines. There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides\n4 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)\nHindus into vegetarians and flesh-eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef-eating. It\ndivides Hindus into those who eat cow's flesh and those who do not. From the point of view of\nuntouchability the first dividing line is of no importance. But the second is. For it completely\nThus wrote Ambedkar on the food pyramid of the Hindu caste system. He elaborated\nfurther that there was yet another dividing line: those who ate freshly slaughtered cow\nand those who ate the flesh of a `dead' cow; it was not that the untouchables ate cow's\nflesh that made them `untouchable', because the people he termed `settled community', who\nwere part of the `touchables', also ate beef, but it was because the untouchables ate the flesh\nof the dead cow. It was therefore the fact of consuming carrion which made the untouch-\nables polluted and polluting and it was their lives of abject poverty that forced them to eat.\nLiving on the doles of the upper caste and forced to perform the scavenging work \u00ad includ-\ning the removal of dead animals as their caste obligation and not having access to live cattle\nwhose fresh meat could be consumed \u00ad eating the flesh of the dead cow was one of the few\nways of adding to their meagre food basket. Gandhi, on the other hand, had a different take\non carrion-eating by the untouchable caste groups.\nCow preservation is an article of faith in Hinduism. No Harijan worth his salt will kill cattle for\nfood. But having become untouchable, he has learnt the evil habit of eating carrion. He will not\nkill a cow but will eat with the greatest relish the flesh of the dead cow. It may be physiologically\nharmless. But psychologically there is nothing, perhaps, so repulsive as carrion eating. And yet,\nwhen a dead cow is brought to a Harijan tanner's house, it is a day of rejoicing for the whole\nhousehold. Children dance round the carcass, and as the animal is flayed, they take hold of\nbones or pieces of flesh and throw them at one another . . . the whole family is drunk with joy at\nthe sight of the dead animal. I know how hard I have found it working among the Harijans to\nWhile Ambedkar locates the eating of dead cows as a reason for conferring his people the\nuntouchable status, Gandhi evades the issue of the origins of untouchability and locates\nwhat he terms the `evil' and `soul-destroying habit' of eating carrion as a result of becoming\nan untouchable failing to ask why they would be `drunk with joy' at the sight of a dead cow.\nFrom a short story entitled `Cull' by Amitab, we have a grimmer description of what a dead\ncow meant as food to a starving people:\n[They] pounced upon the prey, raising a full-throated battle cry . . . young and old, all marched\nforth, flashing their knives. Everyone had an eye on the thick thighs and buttocks. They pulled\nand tugged at the carcass. Tens of knives were sawing at the chest at once. Whatever piece, small\nor big, they could manage, they cut and put into their containers. The knives slashed and sliced,\nchunks and chunks of meat were piled into the hampers and baskets . . . They were all covered in\nblood . . . Their hair was red. Their limbs were red. The dirty rags they wore were red. From top\nto toe they were all dyed in the same colour \u00ad red . . . The kites, vultures, and crows now sprang\ninto action. The dogs, alerted, attacked the skeleton. The crows hovered over the heads of the\npeople going home and swooped down on the troughs they carried on their heads . . . The men\nand women, used to such attacks, held on to their baskets and troughs tightly with one hand and\nwith the other brandished their knives and twigs picked on the way to ward them off. (193\u00ad195)\nSathyamala 5\n(Short story entitled `Cull' by Amitab from Arjun Dangle (ed.) Poisoned Bread: Translations\nfrom Modern Marathi Dalit Literature (Bombay, Orient Longman, 1992), as quoted in\nIn fact, Gandhi was so keen to find a scientific reason to buttress his arguments against\ncarrion-eating which did not necessarily involve the deliberate killing of cows against which\nhe could bring forth religious admonition, that he posed a series of questions to Dr\nDeshmukh, the first president of the Indian Medical Association, on the physiological dis-\ntinction between carrion and slaughtered meat, and was particularly concerned to find out\n`any medical reason for the great repugnance that even meat eaters have against carrion'\n(Gandhi, 1949: 44). While Deshmukh could not provide Gandhi with a physiological reason\nagainst eating carrion even when poisoned, he provided him with a `psychological' reason\nfor aversion to eating non-slaughtered, dead cow despite admitting to `[c]ertain persons of\nsuperior taste . . . decomposing meat before eating to pander to their epicurean taste'\n(Gandhi, 1949: 45). Yet, Deshmukh said: `[i]t is a psychological fact, in the same way as\nthe flowing of water or rotation of the earth is a physical fact; as such use of carrion for food\nin normal times is bound to create a feeling of loathing in the human mind, and feeling of\nrepugnance for the human being who practices this . . . Universal psychology is against it\nand, therefore, it must go' (Letter from Deshmukh to Gandhi, cited in Gandhi, 1949: 47).\nAmbedkar also urged his people to refrain from eating carrion, not from the point of\nview of aversion, but as an affirmation of self-respect. On 20 March 1927, during the Mahad\nSatyagraha he urged his people to `[root] out from our minds the ideas of highness and\nlowness among ourselves. Make an unflinching resolve not to eat the thrown-out crumbs'\nperceived the disposal of the carcasses as a sacred obligation of the untouchables, which they\nshould continue but, in order to achieve self-purification, should refrain from consuming\nthe flesh.\nThough carrion-eating is no longer the norm, it continues to lie at the heart of the\ncontemporary politics on beef-eating: aversion of the upper-caste Hindus against the\nbeef-eating 'untouchables' versus the celebration of self-affirmation and identity as beef-\neaters by the former untouchable and other caste groups who have traditionally consumed\nbeef. The following section looks at the meat consumption pattern, including beef, in con-\ntemporary India.\nThe flesh-eaters in India\nIn 2014, a national-level survey showed that more than two-thirds of the respondents iden-\ntified themselves as non-vegetarians, with the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand,\nKerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal reporting more than 90% as non-vegetarians\n(Government of India, 2014). A household consumption pattern showed that 29.2% of rural\nconsumed fish/prawns, 21.7% rural and 27% urban consumed chicken, 6.4% rural and\n10.0% urban consumed goat meat/mutton, and 4% rural and 5% urban consumed beef/\nbuffalo meat, in the 7 days prior to the survey (National Sample Survey Office, 2014: 26).\nHowever, when per-capita consumption (in 30 days) was considered, with the exception of\n6 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)\nflesh items were minimal; the per-capita consumption of eggs was only 1.94 \u00ad in rural and\n3.18 \u00ad in urban, that of goat meat and mutton was 49 g in rural and 79 g urban, and that of\nbeef/buffalo meat was 42 g and 64 g respectively.\nA noticeable regional difference was apparent, with the highest number of Hindus eating\nbeef/buffalo meat in Andhra Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.\nBeef/buffalo meat-eating was most common in Lakshadweep (1.135 kg per-capita consump-\ntion in 30 days), followed by rural Nagaland (576 g), and Meghalaya (419 g) (National\nSample Survey Office, 2014). Thus, the largest beef-consuming state was not the\nMuslim majority state of Jammu and Kashmir but Meghalaya, where more than 80% of\nthe population consumed beef (Kishore and Anand, 2015). Though the number of\ncrore in 2011\u00ad2012 the total household consumption of beef/buffalo meat went down\nThe analysis also showed that beef/buffalo meat consumption in the month preceding the\nsurvey was highest among the Muslim population (42%) followed by Christians (26.5%)\n(Bansal, 2016). Though Hindus were less than 2%, in absolute numbers they ranked second\nwith more than 12.5 million reporting beef-consumption (Kishore and Anand, 2015).\nHowever, the consumption reported by the Hindus was considered an underestimate as\noften they would consume it outside in eateries but not cook it at home.\nThese national-level data showing high prevalence of households and individuals\nconsuming meat, including beef, yet with per-capita consumption at a minimal level, are\ncorroborated at the micro level as well. In an ethnographic study carried out in a village\nin Tamil Nadu, a state that was reported to have 90% of the respondents reporting as\n`non-vegetarians' (Government of India, 2014), among the households from which\nin-depth information was collected on their everyday diet, only two households reported\nThe everyday diet consisted of the cereal rice eaten with a thin gravy of lentils and vegetables.\nMilk, egg, chicken, mutton, beef, and pork were consumed varyingly. Cattle rearing was the\ntraditional occupation of the konar caste (`Touchable' caste) which was numerically and socially\ndominant in the village. In the past, the cattle strength was many times greater than what it is\nnow and was meant primarily for producing dung for manure and for agricultural operations.\nMilk was available in plenty and with no refrigeration or market, was processed into curd,\nbutter and ghee (clarified butter) and the village was said to be overflowing with these products.\nThe surplus milk went to the calves. What the market had done was to empty the village of milk\nand with that had led to its disappearance from the diet of almost all the households. The\nreduction in the population of the hardy Indian buffalo was the other casualty of the changing\ndemographic pattern. While in the past the village was said to be teaming with them, now only\none household reared them. Dwindling population of buffaloes has been noticed all over Tamil\nNadu. This is a loss, nutritionally speaking, because buffalo milk has a higher protein content\nthan cow milk.\nEggs were consumed not infrequently but the quantity was just sufficient to become a side dish\nof `thodu-curry' (`touch-food'); two eggs would be bought and scrambled with onions and shared\namong four or five family members. . . . Approximately half of the households (53%) in SC\n[Scheduled Castes] and one-third (67%) of the other caste households reported that they rarely\nate eggs because of the cost. . . . Although chicken was not the preferred flesh food in the past, it\nhad come to replace other flesh foods because it was now cheaper and more readily available\nSathyamala 7\nthan the others. Yet, only 30% of the SC households and <6% of households in the other castes\nreported once a week consumption; in all the other households it was occasional. Even in the\nhouseholds that reported weekly consumption, the amount bought would be just sufficient to\nprovide each with a small piece, with the larger share going to the males in the family. Men\nhabituated to alcohol who had regular income were known to consume `non-vegetarian' food,\noften beef, when they imbibed alcohol on a daily or weekly basis. Fish, both from the sea (the\ncoast was just 70 km away) and seasonally from the local tanks/ponds, were available at door-\nsteps, sold by traders on motorcycles. Sometimes fish was caught `illegally' from the streams\nflowing near the village during the rainy seasons. However, its consumption was infrequent and\nseasonal. Dried fish was available through the year and was eaten with great relish particularly\nbecause of its high salt content and was either fried as a side dish or made into gravy\nas kulambu. . .\nConsumption of mutton, beef and pork were reported to have come down drastically from the\npast and was now rare and confined to special occasions only, even among the not-so-poor.\nThis was particularly true for the Konar caste households where mutton was very much part of\ntheir weekly diet in the past. The change was said to be due to the decrease in cattle strength, the\nshift to more land-based livelihoods and the increasing cost of mutton. With the price of mutton\ngoing up, the cost of beef and pork--foods consumed by the lower caste and the poor, which\nwere much cheaper--had also gone up and was increasingly moving out of the reach of the poor.\nHowever, the consumption of beef and pork was also underreported because of the negative\nassociation with its consumption, specifically linked to caste status. Yet, it was stated that those\npreviously eating mutton were shifting to beef whose price was going up because of the increas-\ning demand. The SC households in general had no taboos concerning eating beef but only the\nArunthathiyar caste [the lowermost of the `untouchable' caste hierarchy] openly stated that they\nate beef. Consumption of beef had declined greatly also because of difficulty in accessing it.\nIn the past it was sold quite openly in the village but was now available only in the weekly\nmarket in a nearby town. Lately the communal angle, the banning of cow slaughter and sale of\nbeef, had added to its non-availability. Though I was informed that even `today', people in the\nvillage from diverse castes ate pork, only one family from the SC community openly stated to\nrelishing it, but then too only the men said they ate it. Some also mentioned that pork was eaten\nfor its alleged medicinal properties, particularly as a cure for piles.\nThe annual temple festivals (linked to clan gods) were times when families feasted on flesh foods\nfollowing animal sacrifices and, depending on the particular deity, goats, chicken or pigs were\nsacrificed and eaten. It was reported that till a decade or two ago, bulls were sacrificed to the clan\ngods by the `touchable' caste groups and its meat consumed, but the practice had now stopped.\nIt was also said that in the past, men from the SC groups would go hunting to snare hare or\nbirds but now with the installation of wind turbines, the scrub land was cleared, disturbing the\nThus, though almost the entire village of a mixed caste composition comprising the former\n`untouchable' castes and the 'touchable' castes reported consuming all types of flesh foods,\nincluding beef, albeit some of them clandestinely, its reported consumption had come down\ndrastically, both because of the association of beef with low caste status and due to its\nincreasing price and non-availability. Carrion-eating appeared to be a thing of the past\nand in any case, it was only the Arunthathiyar caste group that traditionally removed the\ncarcasses, ate the meat and used the skin for making leather articles utilized primarily in\n8 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)\n`untouchable' castes in North Gujarat in the 1980s, reported that carrion-eating was no\nlonger prevalent. Moreover, as Cole (2017) argues, scientific studies have shown that `no\nhard and fast rule exists between fallen flesh and slaughtered meat'. In any case with refrig-\neration and processing, the distinction between carrion and fresh kill makes little sense.\nUnlike the findings from Chigateri's (2008) work with Dalit women in Bangalore, where\nbeef-eating was a source of contestation, in my study village, the Scheduled Castes' house-\nholds did not see this as an important source of their `untouchability' status or oppression.\nThis could be perhaps because flesh consumption was not perceived as a transgression as\nalmost all households consumed flesh foods and consumption of beef was not a taboo even\namong those from the `touchable' castes.\nStructural violence of Hindu vegetarianism\nFrom both macro- and micro-level data, though the majority of the Indian population\nidentifies itself as `non-vegetarian', the reality is that the consumption of flesh foods, includ-\ning that from cattle, is so little as to be almost negligible, indicating that the everyday diet of\nthe poor who form the majority of the population continues to be primarily cereal-based.\nHowever, it is not this group of the economically underprivileged who are protesting the\nimposition of a certain food choice of a minority over the majority. Though the cow\nvigilantes have targeted the Muslim population that consumes beef, and also trades in it,\nagain, the major protests have not risen from this group either. It is from within the Hindu\npopulation that the more militant protests have risen and though the beef-eaters from the\n`touchable' caste groups are very much part of it, the challenge posed by the Dalit groups\nmove beyond the `right to eat' to, as Satyanarayana puts it, recreating caste as `a new\nidentity of assertion and pride' (Satyanarayana, 2014: 52). In this new reimagining, the\nproject is not the annihilation of caste but to reconfigure it as a contemporary form of\npower, as modern, and subjective (Satyanarayana, 2014: 52). Beef-eating then becomes a\nmarker of identity, an identity that needs to be celebrated against the centuries of aversion\nand humiliation imposed on a particular people on account of their location in the unjust\nhierarchy because of the accident of birth.\nContrary to Chigateri's argument that the `moral ethic of non-violence that forms such a\npowerful symbolic tool of vegetarian caste communities' is subverted by the Dalit critique of\nthe politics of food (Chigateri, 2008: 24), I would argue that the upper-caste, Hindu brand of\nvegetarianism is based on the notion of caste purity which is not necessarily linked to care of\nanimals or non-violence, even though it drew its original inspiration from Buddhism and\nJainism, both of which had non-violence as a central tenet.22 For instance, a study on Euro-\nAmerican and Indian vegetarians concluded that while the former were more concerned\nthan the omnivores about the consequences their daily food choices have on environment\nand animal welfare, the universalistic values they endorsed were not given much importance\namong the Indian vegetarians (Ruby et al., 2013: 340). The Indian vegetarians' motivation\nwas based on the belief that eating meat was polluting due to a `heightened concern for the\nconservative ethics of Purity'. Thus, in the upper-caste Hindu context, to speak of vegetar-\nianism is then, as Pandian puts it, to `talk of caste by other means' as against talking of caste\n`on its own terms' (Pandian, 2002: 1735). In modern India, to impose a code against meat-\neating in general and beef-eating in particular is to smuggle casteism through the backdoor.\nClaiming beef-eating as a marker of self-identity by the `untouchable' groups then becomes\na political project to talk of caste on its own terms.\nSathyamala 9\nThe violence with which a certain vegetarian code is being enforced in India and the violence\nwith which the counter-discourse has been met with, renders its claim of non-violence an empty\nrhetoric, revealing the continued structural violence of the caste system despite claims of\nmodernity. As Smith puts it, `. . . every ethical discourse expresses and constructs a different\nmoral field, draws different boundaries around morality, writes or speaks of different cultural\ncontexts' and that one would need to speak of moralities rather than morality (Smith, 2001:\n25). Hence, in India, as long as caste dictates social norms, including what one can or cannot\nconsume, vegetarianism as an enforcer of caste purity will need to give up its pretence of being\nin a morally superior position of non-violence towards living beings.\nConclusion\nThis paper examines the politics of meat-eating, specifically beef consumption in contempo-\nrary India. The violence which transgression of a certain food code has evoked, has laid bare\nthe continued need for the Hindu upper caste India to maintain its hegemony at all costs.\nThough its wrath is directed against the `other' \u00ad the Muslim population \u00ad it is the former\n`untouchable' caste groups that have posed a serious threat to upper caste supremacy by\nlaying claim to their identity in all matters including their food culture. In this context,\norchestrated beef consumption promoted as a counter-cuisine is to be viewed as a political\nact of subversion and resistance to the disciplinary power of the state which is attempting to\ntransform unapologetically into a theocracy under the aegis of Hindu fundamentalist groups.\n"
