Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \nTHE 2004 United States Health Report determined that\n80% of the geriatric population (adults aged 65 years\nscription drug in the prior month (National Center for Health\nStatistics, 2004).About half of the individuals in the same age\ngroup reported taking three or more prescription drugs, repre-\nsenting an increase of nearly 50% over the prior 5\u00ad10 years.\nConsidering that older adults in the United States consume a\ndisproportionately large and increasing share of medications,\nthere is a growing need to understand and account for the\nphysiological role of medications, physical, and mental (psy-\nchological, cognitive) side effects of medications, and medica-\ntion use behavior in analyses pertinent to older adult health.\nAccurate assessment of medication use in studies of older\nadult health is essential and requires methods for collection\nand coding of medication data, incorporation of medi-\ncation data into health-related analyses, and interpretation\nof medication-related findings. Incorporation of medication\ndata into biosocial models of older adult health is important\nfor informing health care practices, improving medication-\nrelated health outcomes, and understanding biological path-\nways through which social factors and conditions affect\nhealth in later life. Incorporation of biological measures as\npredictors of health or social outcomes in gerontological re-\nsearch requires consideration of the effects of medications\non both the biomeasures and outcomes of interest.\nMethods for the collection and coding of medication data\nin population-based survey research differ across studies\nand are described with variable detail in the social and epi-\ndemiological research literature (Pahor et al., 1994). Most\nstudies derive medication data from chart review, adminis-\ntrative/claims data, or self-report of prescribed medicines\n(thus, nonprescription medications are not included). For\nmedication use data, an in-home inventory of medications\nobtained by direct observation has been shown to be a more\nreliable measurement tool than self-report recall methods\ntion data depends on the study objective and also varies\nacross studies. Because a variety of proprietary databases\ncan be purchased and used to code medication data, includ-\ning First Databank\u00ae and Multum\u00ae, classification of medi-\ncation data may not be consistent across studies.\nThis paper describes the collection, coding, and validity\nof the medication use data from the National Social Life,\nHealth and Aging Project (NSHAP)--a survey of a national\nprobability sample of 3,005 community-residing older\nadults aged 57\u00ad85 years. The most comparable prior studies\nare the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the\nSlone Survey, and the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES).

The Multum\u00ae drug database was used for\ncoding drug names and for mapping those names to therapeutic categories. Drugs not included in Multum\u00ae were as-\nsigned to medication classes by extending Multum's typology. Internal and external validity of the medication data are\nexamined and analytic use of the medication data is discussed.\nResults Only 0.9% of respondents refused to participate in the medication log. Ninety-nine percent of all entries were\nidentified and mapped to a medication class. Use of medication classes correlated highly with the presence of correspond-\ning health conditions and related biological measures. The prevalence of use of common therapeutic classes of medica-\ntions in NSHAP is comparable to that found in other national studies.\nDiscussion Nearly all NSHAP respondents cooperated with the medication use data collection protocol.

For these reasons, estimates of\nmedication use based on NSHAP may vary from those ob-\ntained in previous studies.\nMethods\nCollection\nMedication data were collected during an in-home inter-\nview by direct observation using a computer-based medica-\ntion log or inventory. NSHAP field staff specifically asked\n\"to record all medications that you [respondent] take on a\nregular schedule, like every day or every week. This will\ninclude prescription and nonprescription medications, over-\nthe-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal and alternative\nmedicines.\" The interviewer, who had no specialized knowl-\nedge of medications, directly recorded names of medica-\ntions from the medication packaging (e.g., bottle, tube,\nblister pack) into the computer. Interviewers were allowed\nto record up to 20 medications. It is possible that, in some\ncases, the interviewer recorded a medication based only on\nthe respondent's report (e.g., if the bottle or package was\nunavailable), though the fact that this did not arise as a ma-\njor issue during interviewer debriefing suggests that it was\nrare (information to indicate that medication data were\nlogged based on respondent's report rather than direct ob-\nservation was not recorded in our computer-based survey\ninstrument).\nCoding of Medications\nInitial identification of medication names was accom-\nplished using the National Drug Code (NDC) directory, Mi-\ncromedex\u00ae, and the National Library of Medicine Medline\nPlus\u00ae Drug and Supplements database. Reported medica-\ntion names were translated to generic drug names when pos-\nsible and then coded according to the set of drug names in\nthe Multum drug classification database. We selected Mul-\ntum from several available drug databases because it is also\nused by NHANES, MEPS, and Health and Retirement Study\nto code their medication data. The Multum database is ac-\ncessible online (http://www.multum.com) with authoriza-\ntion from Multum; the Multum Lexicon Plus version was\n(90%) were matched to a Multum drug name (Figure 1). All\nentries were first coded by a clinical pharmacist (D.M.Q.)\nand then double-checked by both D.M.Q. and a research as-\nsistant working under D.M.Q.'s supervision (A.M.). To pre-\nserve confidentiality, medications indicated for the treatment\nof HIV/AIDS are excluded from the public-use data set.\nIn all, 416 (7%) unique responses were identified as drugs\nthat were not included in the Multum Lexicon Plus data-\nbase. These names were added to our local copy of the da-\ntabase and classified by D.M.Q. according to the existing\nMultum therapeutic categories (described subsequently);\nwe refer to them here as \"extended Multum drug names.\"\nBecause Multum's coverage of alternative medicines and\nnutritional products is not complete, most extended Multum\ndrug names are included in these categories.

Flowchart summarizing drug name coding.\nname but had enough information to adequately match to a\nMultum therapeutic category; these were also assigned an\nextended Multum drug name--for example, \"unspecified\npotassium.\"\nFor extended Multum drug names, the components were\nidentified using multiple resources, including the National\nLibrary of Medicine Medline Plus Drugs and Supplements\ndatabase, the Natural Standard\u00ae database, and Web sites for\nproduct names and labels. Despite the inconsistent and non-\nstandard terminology used to classify dietary supplements,\nwe grouped these products as either alternative medicines\nor nutritional products. This approach was chosen for con-\nsistency with Multum classifications, NHANES, the United\nStates Slone Survey on Medication Use, and the National\nHealth and Interview Survey. Alternative medicines in-\ncluded two subcategories: (a) herbals/botanicals (e.g., al-\nfalfa) and (b) nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals are nonherbal,\nnonvitamin, and nonmineral supplements (e.g., glu-\ncosamine). Nutritional products included: (a) vitamin and/\nor mineral combinations, (b) single vitamins, (c) minerals/\nelectrolytes, and (d) iron products. Weight loss supplements,\nfiber products, and uncategorized products were coded as\n\"other supplements.\"\nOf the remaining 156 unique entries (2.7%) that could\nnot be coded according to Multum, 71 clearly indicated a\ntherapeutic objective and were coded according to this; for\nexample, the response \"medication for diabetes\" is coded\nas \"diabetic medication.\" Only 85 unique responses were\nunrecognizable.\nMany analysts will want to work with the medication\ndata in terms of therapeutic categories; for example, they\nmay wish to identify all respondents who are currently tak-\ning a particular type of cardiovascular agent. Multum's\ntherapeutic categories are based on the American Hospital\nFormulary Service therapeutic categories and are organized\ninto a three-level hierarchy permitting classification at the\ntherapeutic level, pharmacological level, and drug category\nlevel. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the way in\nwhich the therapeutic (Level 1) classification \"cardiovascu-\nlar agents\" is subdivided into the pharmacological (Level 2)\ncategories \"antihypertensive combinations,\" \"diuretics,\"\nand \"angiostatin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\" All\ndiuretics are then further subdivided into specific drug\n(Level 3) categories, such as \"thiazide diuretics.\"\nThe Multum database maps each Multum drug name to a\nspecific category in the hierarchy, and our extended Multum\nnames have also been mapped to specific categories as de-\nscribed earlier. To facilitate the use of the data set, variables\nhave been created for each category to indicate whether the\nrespondent reported taking an item in that category or in one\nof the categories below it in the hierarchy. For example, a\nrespondent taking lisinopril (mapped by Multum to the cat-\negory \"angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors\") is\ncoded as taking both ACE inhibitors and cardiovascular\nagents, whereas a respondent taking hydrochlorothiazide\n(mapped by Multum to the category \"thiazide diuretics\") is\ncoded as taking thiazide diuretics, diuretics, and cardiovas-\ncular agents.\nAs with individual drugs, Multum also maps combina-\ntion drugs to a specific category. In these cases, the NSHAP\ndatabase records not only the location of the combination\nbut also includes the location of each component. Thus, a\nrespondent taking hydrocholoriazide\u00adlisinopril would not\nonly be coded as taking both antihypertensive combinations\nand cardiovascular agents but would also be coded under\nthe categories for single-agent hydrochlorothiazide and sin-\ngle-agent lisinopril (as described earlier).\nBecause the Multum database links individual drug\nnames to one or more NDCs, and because each NDC code\nis classified as either prescription or nonprescription, we\nwere able to identify those medications in the NSHAP data\nset that are available by prescription only (hereafter referred\nto as \"prescription medications\"). Drugs that are not linked\nto an NDC code by Multum or for which this linkage is in-\ncomplete were individually reviewed by D.M.Q. and classi-\nfied accordingly.\nAssessing Validity of Medication Use Data\nInternal validity.--Internal validity of the directly ob-\nserved medication log as an instrument for collecting medi-\ncation use data was assessed using three strategies: (a)\nextent of agreement between current use of a disease-\nspecific class of medications (e.g., antidiabetic agents) and\nself-report of ever being diagnosed with the disease (e.g.,\ndiabetes), (b) concordance between gender and use of gen-\nder-specific medications (e.g., estrogens and erectile dys-\nfunction agents), and (c) differences in two biological\ncorrelates of medication use--resting pulse (measured\ntwice and then averaged) as a correlate of beta-adrenergic\u00ad\nantagonist or \u00adagonist use and glycosylated hemoglobin\n(HbA1c) as a correlate of glucose-lowering drugs--between\nusers and nonusers. The use of beta-blockers (drugs that\nblock receptors in the heart and vasculature, with a conse-\nquent decrease in heart rate) is expected to cause a decrease\nin pulse rate, whereas the use of beta-agonists (drugs that\n*Multum drug name in parentheses.\nCardiovascular Agents\nAntihypertensive\nCombinations\n(Hydrochlorothiazide-\nLisinopril)\nDiuretics ACE Inhibitors\n(Lisinopril)\nThiazide Diuretics\n(Hydrochlorothiazaide)\nFigure 2. Example of Multum drug name classification.\npromote the activity of beta-receptors in the lung, with a\nconsequent increase in heart rate) is expected to cause an\nincrease. HbA1c levels (a measure of glucose metabolism\nover the previous 60\u00ad90 days) are expected to be higher in\ndiabetes medication users.\nExternal validity.--To evaluate the external validity of\nthe medication data, comparisons using available data\nfrom other national studies were performed. To increase\ncomparability, only those NSHAP respondents aged 65\nyears and older were included. Stagnitti (2004) and Daniel\nand Malone (2007) report on outpatient prescription drugs\npurchased by adults older than 65 years in the MEPS. The\nSlone Survey (2005) reports on medication use in children\nand adults in the United States, but only data for those\naged 65 years and older are used for this comparison. An\nanalysis of NHANES' prescribed medicines data was con-\nExample of Analytic Application\nTo illustrate one of the ways in which the medication data\nmay be used in a substantive analysis and the impact it\ncan have on the results, we fit linear regression models\n(Weisberg, 1985) to both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP), each measured twice and\nthen averaged. Measurements were taken from the left arm\nusing a Lifesource digital blood pressure monitor (Model\nUA-767PVL). Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnic-\nity, and education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status)--\neach of which is known to be related to blood pressure.\nBecause the use of antihypertensives not only affects blood\npressure but may also mediate and/or moderate the relation-\nship between blood pressure and the covariates, we fit sepa-\nrate models among antihypertensive users and nonusers.\nAntihypertensive users were identified as those using one or\nmore medications from the following Multum therapeutic\ncategories: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi-\ntors, beta-adrenergic blockers, diuretics, and calcium chan-\nnel blockers. Drugs in each of these categories have a known\nlowering effect on blood pressure.\nStatistical Considerations\nAll population estimates (proportions, means, and re-\ngression coefficients) are weighted using the weights dis-\ntributed with the data set, which adjust for differential\nprobabilities of selection and differential nonresponse.\nStandard errors were computed using the linearization\nmethod (Binder, 1983), taking into account the stratifica-\ntion and clustering of the sample design. Approximate 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates were obtained\nby inverting the corresponding Wald test. Hypothesis tests\nin Table 4 (represented by starring the corresponding coef-\nficients) were two sided.\nResults\nCollection\nOnly 0.9% of respondents refused to participate in the\nmedication log protocol. Among those who did participate,\n8.8% reported taking no medications regularly. Only 0.7%\nreported taking 20 or more medications. The mean number\nof medications reported was 5.2.\nCoding\nThe 2,717 respondents reporting at least one medication\n(4.6%) were matched to an extended Multum drug name.\ncoded according to therapeutic objective and 87 were un-\nrecognizable.\nInternal Validity\nTable 1 shows the proportion of respondents who re-\nported having been diagnosed with diabetes, thyroid prob-\nlems, hypertension, or an enlarged prostate, estimated\nseparately for those regularly taking a corresponding medi-\ncation and those who were not. Ninety-five percent of those\ntaking an antidiabetic agent reported having diabetes, as\ncompared with only 5% of those not taking one. In contrast,\namong those men taking alpha blockers or 5-alpha reductase\ninhibitors, only 65% reported having an enlarged prostate,\nwhereas 22% of men not taking these medications reported\nthe condition. All the 158 respondents who reported taking\nestrogen were women, and all the 29 respondents who re-\nported taking erectile dysfunction agents were men.\nThe average pulse among those taking beta-blockers was\nTable 1.

In general, the estimates for NSHAP were fairly\nsimilar to those from the other studies, with the observed\ndifferences being in the expected directions. Specifically,\nthe estimated prevalence of medication use (both any medi-\ncation and prescription medications) was slightly higher for\nNSHAP than for Slone (which relied on self-report over the\nphone), whereas the prevalence and mean number of pre-\nscription medications were somewhat lower for NSHAP\nthan for MEPS (which recorded all drugs purchased, rather\nthan actually used, during the past year).\nAnalytic Application\nTable 4 shows the results of regressing SBP and DBP\non gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education separately\nfor those taking antihypertensive medications and those not\ntaking them. The effects of the covariates on SBP are sub-\nstantially greater among those not taking antihypertensives;\nin fact, among antihypertensive users, the effects of gender,\nrace/ethnicity, and education are not even statistically sig-\nnificant at the .05 level. Among nonusers, SBP is on average\nlower among women, Hispanics, and those with higher edu-\ncation, whereas it is higher among Blacks. The same is true\nfor DBP with regard to race/ethnicity and education; how-\never, the results for gender and age are slightly different. In\nparticular, the effects of gender and age are greater among\nantihypertensive users, and they are reversed; DBP is\ngreater among women users and decreases with age.\nDiscussion\nNearly all NSHAP respondents cooperated with the med-\nication log protocol. The resulting data were then success-\nfully coded using the proprietary Multum database, thus\nfacilitating comparisons with studies such as NHANES and\nMEPS (both of which also used Multum to code their data).\nNearly all the recorded entries were able to be matched ei-\nther to a Multum drug name or to an extended Multum drug\nname and have, therefore, been classified according to Mul-\ntum's therapeutic categories. Because this process involved\nidentifying a wide range of prescription and nonprescrip-\ntion drugs using both generic and brand names, and because\nit also involved extending the Multum database to accom-\nmodate additional alternative medicines and nutritional\nproducts, it required the expertise of both pharmaceutical\nand medical experts (D.M.Q. and S.T.L.). The resulting data\nset, however, could be used by analysts without such exper-\ntise as long as they know which therapeutic categories are\nappropriate for their analyses (as discussed subsequently).\nAs has been found previously (Landry et al., 1988; Psaty\net al., 1992), the medication use data collected using this\nprocedure were found to correspond well with gender (for\ngender-specific medications), with the presence of specific\nhealth conditions and with differences in biological mea-\nsures affected by medication use. Although the agreement\nbetween reporting a specific condition and the observed use\nof medication indicated for that condition was not perfect,\nthis is to be expected for several reasons: (a) A specific drug\nclass may have more than one therapeutic application (e.g.,\nantihypertensives may be used for purposes other than treat-\ning blood pressure, such as congestive heart failure or mi-\ngraine prophylaxis), (b) an individual may have been\ndiagnosed with a condition that did not currently require\ntreatment with medication, (c) an individual may have been\ndiagnosed with a health condition and prescribed medical\ntreatment but was either unable or unwilling to comply with\nthe treatment (untreated disease), or (d) an individual was\ntaking a medication for a condition that was not reported to\nthe interviewer.\nWith respect to external validity, the NSHAP data yield\nestimates of medication use among community-residing\nolder adults, which are similar to those from the best prior\nmedication use data for this population (CDC, 2008b;\n2001). Subtle differences between these data sets are likely\ndue to variations in data collection protocols, differences in\nthe period of time for which current medication use is de-\nfined (e.g., \"daily or weekly,\" \"in the week prior to the in-\nterview,\" or \"in the past month\"), and the fact that some\nstudies do not collect data on nonprescription medications.\nFor example, the prevalence of central nervous system agent\nTable 2.

Although one might\nhave expected a higher prevalence estimate from MEPS due\nto its longer (12 month) time window, the fact that it fo-\ncused solely on prescription medications meant that it did\nnot include the widely used nonprescribed analgesic medi-\ncations (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen). For additional\ndetails on the prevalence and patterns of medication use es-\ntimated from the NSHAP data set, see Qato and colleagues\nThe NSHAP medication use data are suitable both for\nstudies in which medication use is the primary outcome and\nfor those in which the use of one or more specific medica-\ntions (or medication classes) is a covariate. The simple ex-\nample shown here--stratifying an analysis of blood pressure\nby the use of antihypertensives--demonstrates the impor-\ntance of controlling for medication use in the analysis of\nhealth outcomes. In particular, high blood pressure among\nthose not currently taking antihypertensives reflects either\ndisease that is undiagnosed, disease that is diagnosed but for\nwhich no treatment has been prescribed, or an inability or\nunwillingness to use the prescribed medication. In contrast,\nhigh blood pressure among those taking antihypertensives\nmay reflect an inadequate treatment or a lack of adherence\nto the prescribed treatment. As illustrated in our example,\nthe social factors affecting these two processes may be dif-\nferent. Although information on medication dosage, com-\npliance, and cost would permit addressing these issues in\ngreater detail, NSHAP's omnibus nature prevented collect-\ning this additional level of detail. Linkage of the NSHAP\ndata set to Medicare prescription drug data or drug cost data\nsets may be feasible in the future but will require additional\npermission from NSHAP participants.\nThe public-use data set is designed to facilitate a wide range\nof analyses by including a series of indicator (0/1) variables,\neach of which indicates that a respondent reported taking at\nleast one medication in a given Multum drug category. These\nvariables can then be easily combined, as necessary. Doing\nthis requires knowledge of the Multum classification hierar-\nchy (a complete description of which is distributed with the\nNSHAP data set) and requires medical and/or pharmaceutical\nknowledge. For example, when controlling for the use of anti-\nhypertensives, one cannot rely solely on the therapeutic clas-\nsification \"cardiovascular agents\" because subclasses such as\n\"antianginal agents,\" \"antiarrhythmic agents,\" and \"inotropic\nagents\" are not specific for the treatment of hypertension; in-\nstead, one must combine the various subclasses specific for\nhypertension as we did here. It is also important to note that\nMultum's therapeutic classes identify the overall therapeutic\neffect of the drug and not necessarily the effect of all active\ningredients. Information on therapeutic or pharmacological\ncategories of specific drugs may be obtained online using the\nDrugdex database in Micromedex and the National Library of\nMedicine.\nFunding\nThe National Social Life, Health and Aging Project is supported by the\nNational Institute on Aging, Office of Women's Health Research, Office of\nAIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research\non Aging, University of Chicago--NORC Center on Demography and\nEconomics of Aging Core on Biomarkers in Population-Based Health and\nPharmaceutical Policy (PI: David Meltzer) also supported the efforts of\nS.T.L. and D.M.Q. on the manuscript.
