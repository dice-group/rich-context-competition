Interviews were conducted at the end of each participant's first year of teaching. The\nfindings of this study highlight the vast different learning styles of students from Africa and the strategies that these teachers\ntrialed and incorporated into their lessons in an attempt to minimize the disruptions they experienced when first introduced\nto the students. The results of this study, together with information from the literature, suggest that the training and\neducation of teachers in Australia must incorporate strategies for teaching students from different backgrounds, cultures, and\nliving situations to better facilitate the inclusion of them in school-based activities and learning.\n",

Not only must they overcome these,\nbut they must also grapple with the additional intricacies that\nare part of being a first-year teacher beginning their teaching\nPhysical education teachers' induction into the teaching\nprofession differs slightly from that of other teaching sub-\njects. Physical education may be less stressful, because in\nprevious research there has been no mention of the reality\nshock that tends to accompany the experiences of other sub-\nject classroom teachers (Sparkes, Templin, & Schempp,\nThe role of physical education teachers has been ques-\ntioned on various occasions citing the subject's usefulness\nand appropriateness for modern day teaching. Keay (2006)\nlooked at the professional development opportunities pro-\nvided during the induction process for physical education\nteachers. Results of the study suggest that new teachers were\nable to call upon their previous experience to guide their\ninstruction in schools; however, it was also suggested that\nschool managers, heads of departments, and external school\nproviders do have a need to ensure adequate learning oppor-\ntunities are provided to teachers so they can continually chal-\nlenge their own practice.\nFollowing on from the subject area of physical education\nbeing questioned over its appropriateness, the teaching of\nphysical education to pre-service primary school teachers\nhas also been questioned in the literature because of the dif-\nficulties primary school teachers often encounter with teach-\ning physical education. Morgan and Hansen (2007), in their\nstudy of 189 teachers discovered that teachers were not plan-\nning, implementing, reporting, or evaluating physical educa-\ntion programs. The authors suggest that due to the lack of\nconfidence in primary-based teachers to teach physical edu-\ncation programs, professional development and pre-service\neducation needs to be strengthened and made more suitable\nfor primary school teachers' needs and skill set. The confi-\ndence of non-physical education specialists to teach physical\neducation was investigated by Morgan and Bourke (2008).\nThe study found that many teachers were dissatisfied and\ndisgruntled with teaching physical education, and teacher\neducators needed to find ways to challenge these perceptions\nand reinvigorate teachers to want to teach physical education\nfor the benefit of their students as well as the teachers.\n1Australian Catholic University, Strathfield, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nChristopher Francis Baldwin, Faculty of Education & Arts, Australian\nCatholic University, 25A Barker Road, Strathfield, New South Wales\nEmail: chris.baldwin@acu.edu.au\nFirst-Year Physical Education Teachers'\nExperiences With Teaching African\nRefugee Students\nChristopher Francis Baldwin1\n Keywords\nexperiences, physical education, refugees, teachers\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n2 SAGE Open\nInadequate instruction of pre-service teachers has been\nsuggested as one of the reasons why physical education is\nfailing in primary schools (Elliot, Atencio, Campbell, & Jess,\nmary teachers regarding their experiences with their pre-ser-\nvice university teaching course in physical education. The\nstudy concludes that the teachers in the courses were only\ngiven a basic starting point that was inadequate for teaching\nphysical education effectively. Recommendations are made\nfor more critical and reflective learning opportunities and\nexperiences in physical education.\nAlthough numerous challenges have been identified in the\nteaching of physical education, it has been suggested that one\nof the biggest challenges lies in understanding what physical\neducation is (Coulter & Chroinin, 2013). In their study, where\nparticipants were asked to write down what physical educa-\ntion is to them, results suggest that for a large proportion of\nthe pre-service teachers involved in the study, their knowl-\nedge and understanding of physical education were largely\nbased on their own school experiences. The researchers\nacknowledge that although previous knowledge and experi-\nence are valuable, physical education needs to move beyond\nreproducing dominant sport and health ideologies.\nThe initial years of teaching for beginning teachers are\nextremely important in their development of knowledge and\nunderstanding in the classroom environment (Mtika, 2010).\nThese early years in beginning teachers' career determine\nwhether they will remain in the profession as well as what\nkind of teacher they will become (Thevenard et al., 2009).\nResearchers have suggested that the first years of a teacher's\ncareer are actually learning years for the teacher out on the\nThe first years of teaching are acknowledged as often being\nthe hardest. Shoffner (2011), in her study looked at begin-\nning teacher's experiences and what they perceived as being\nsome of the hardest aspects of teaching to come to terms\nwith. The participants in Shoffner's study identified these\naspects as adjustment to the profession, acceptance of stu-\ndents, and management of emotion. Shoffner suggests that\nteacher educators need to prepare beginning teachers for the\nexistence of these concerns in the classroom and one way\nthat they may be achieved in an ongoing sense is through the\nteaching and practice of reflection.\nResearch has suggested that beginning teachers are not\nalways provided the necessary support they need and as a\nresult can suffer from reality shock which can lead to their\npremature departure from the teaching profession (El baz-\nLuwisch, 2005). \"Beginning teachers have real learning\nneeds that cannot be grasped in advance or outside the con-\nmanagement, motivation of students, juggling workload,\nassessment and marking, reports, parent interviews, and\ndealing with individual difference are just some of the day-\nto-day tasks that today's teachers have to deal with.\nTeaching Students From Diverse\nCultural and Linguistic Backgrounds\nThe ability to successfully teach students from diverse cul-\ntural and linguistic backgrounds is underpinned by the\nknowledge and training of the teacher in question\n(Zozakiewicz, 2010). Training programs vary greatly from\ninstitution to institution, so much so that Zozakiewicz (2010)\nin her study suggested that one of the more successful ways\nof preparing teachers for the challenges of teaching diverse\nstudents is through in-school mentoring programs.\nZozakiewicz acknowledges that culturally responsible men-\ntoring helps teachers become critical thinkers about the cul-\nturally diverse contexts with which they work, in turn\nassisting them develop inclusive practices for their students.\nThe ability of teachers to balance the ever changing class-\nroom dynamics with the demands of school policies, curricu-\nlum, and other constraints is a hugely difficult task (Miller,\n2011). Couple this challenge with students from diverse cul-\ntures and with varying degrees of linguistic ability and you\nhave an even tougher job as a teacher. Miller's (2011) study\naddressed this challenge in one school in Melbourne where\nthe spectrum of conflicts the school's teachers dealt with was\nso great, the teachers themselves often felt isolated and dis-\nempowered. The study concludes that there is a greater need\nfor schools to support and retain their teachers, and one way\nof doing this is ensuring there is the support and training pro-\nvided in the teaching of literacy, especially to non-English\nspeaking students.\nTrent (2011) further supported this notion by adding that\nbeginning teachers often have rigid views about themselves\nand about their teaching abilities; add to this the complexities\nof teaching students with limited or no English and linguistic\nabilities and these conceptions multiple tenfold. Trent argues\nthat future research needs to address the way teachers con-\nstruct their teaching identity and how this identity moves and\nchanges over the course of a teaching career.\nMalewski, Sharma, and Phillion (2012) took this point\nfurther in their study, indicating that before we even address\nthe schools the beginning teachers are teaching in, we need\nto look at their overall professional experience (practicum).\nTheir study acknowledges that students who accessed the\nopportunity for an international field experience component\nto their university study were more likely to be aware of, and\nsensitive to, the needs of diverse students in the classroom.\nTeaching in a Global World--The New\nChallenge for Beginning Teachers\nThe ever increasing migration rate, along with an ever\nincreasing numbers of refugees seeking asylum and resi-\ndency status in countries free from war and oppression, has\nmeant that education systems across the world have had to\nbecome more accommodating for students attending schools\nfrom non-native backgrounds (Knoblauch, 2001). Although\nmany schools and governing institutions of schools have\nbegun to make arrangements and put policies and procedures\nin place for dealing with these students, pre-service educa-\ntion programs have maintained their traditional stance of\nteacher training; meaning teachers are not trained and\nequipped to deal with students who arrive in their classes\nfrom these often traumatic backgrounds (Australian\nIn Australia, a country that has a history of migration\n(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008), education has tended\nto be \"inter-cultural\" (Turner & Fozdar, 2010). Much exist-\ning research has focused on ethnic minorities from non-refu-\ngee populations (Turner & Fozdar, 2010). Little or no\nresearch has attempted to look at refugee populations and\nhow the educating of students from refugee populations is\ncarried out, or how teachers dealing with refugee students\nmanage to teach these students the curriculum. Turner and\nFozdar (2010) acknowledged that low levels of literacy, sig-\nnificant cultural difference, and possible trauma related to\ndisplacement experiences make educating refugee students\nquite difficult and challenging for teachers, schools, and their\nfellow classmates alike.\nThe teaching of basic literacy skills to migrant students\nhas been identified as a difficult task (Cross, 2011). The\nability of teachers to understand the concept of teaching\nliteracy, when the students they are teaching are not native\nspeakers of the language, was the nature of Cross's (2011)\narticle. The article concludes that here in Australia, as well\nas other countries, we have a premised idea that all stu-\ndents share a common language for their engagement with\nliteracy and that is not the case. Cross suggests that we\nneed to revisit these assumptions regarding the teaching of\nliteracy if we are to engage with the contemporary school\nsystem.\nAfrican-born individuals (Australian Government, 2007).\nMany of these individuals have been students; some of them\nenter schools throughout Australia. Their traumatic upbring-\ning in Sudan where many have witnessed atrocities per-\nformed on parents, siblings, friends, and even strangers\npresents the teachers who will be teaching these students\nwith great challenges. This article looks at eight beginning\nteachers in Sydney, Australia, who teach physical education\nin primary and secondary schools. Their experiences with\nteaching African refugee students and the challenges and tri-\numphs they experienced during their first year of full-time\nteaching forms the basis for this research.\nPurpose of the Study\nThe purpose of this study was to understand how first-year\nphysical education teachers engaged with African refugee\nstudents in their physical education lessons. The questions\nthat guided this study were as follows:\n1. How do physical educators, who are in the first year\nof their teaching deal with students from different\ncultures, specifically Africa?\n2. What on-site measures are in place to assist first-year\nteachers deal with the different dynamics of learning\nstyles present in students from Africa?\n3. How do first-year physical educators describe their\nexperiences with teaching African refugee students?\nMethod\nThe primary source of data for this study was interviews con-\nducted with the new beginning teachers at the end of their\nfirst full year of teaching.\nIn-Depth Interviewing\nThe researcher carried out multiple open-ended questions\nwith multiple interviews used (Alvarez & Urla, 2002; Kvale,\ntranscribed. The raw transcribed interviews constituted the\nprimary data set for subsequent analysis (Berg, 2009;\nexperiences as a way of learning is not something new;\nOrland-Barak and Maskit (2011) discussed that the use of\nstory sheds light on the often hostile and adverse sides of\nteaching. The stories also \"shed light on the human side of\nteachers and teaching, reflecting the plots, heroes and dra-\nmas that surround any teacher . . . \" (Orland-Barak & Maskit,\nEach of the beginning teachers was interviewed twice at\nhis or her home or a mutually convenient and acceptable\nlocation during the summer schools holidays (December-\nFebruary). The purpose of the first interview with the begin-\nning teachers was to establish autobiographical contexts for\nunderstanding the participants'reasons for becoming a phys-\nical education teacher, their experiences during their teacher\ntraining course, and their goals for the next 12 months with\nrespect to their teaching. The information collected in this\nfirst interview informed lines of questioning for the follow-\nup interview.\nAt the end of the first interview, the second interview\nwas scheduled to be conducted approximately 2 to 3 weeks\nlater, which allowed enough time for the first interview to\nbe transcribed and a preliminary analysis done. The second\ninterview concentrated on what each participant's first year\nas a physical education teacher was like, and how their\nteaching had to \"change\" to enable the inclusion of the\nAfrican refugee students in their classes. Questions included\nthe following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Moving on to your teaching this year, tell me about\nyour first day/week of the school year.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How did you come to be placed in this school?\n4 SAGE Open\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Were you aware of the schools intake of African refu-\ngee students?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Compare how you taught in the beginning of the\nschool year with how you teach now.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How did you learn to teach the way you do now?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Upon reviewing your first year of teaching and the\nuniversity teaching course that you recently com-\npleted, do you feel like your teacher training ade-\nquately prepared you for teaching? Why/why not?\nThis is only a brief sample of the questions used in the\ninterviews with the beginning teachers. A number of addi-\ntional questions were asked to elicit responses from the par-\nticipants that addressed what their actual first year of\nfull-time teaching was like and how as teachers they were\ncalled upon to modify and adapt their classes to cater for\nstudent needs.\nParticipants\nThe participants for this study were eight physical education\nteachers who completed their first year of teaching during\nthe 2012 school year. They taught full-time at the primary or\nsecondary school level in Sydney, Australia. The physical\neducation teachers were selected to ensure representation by\ngender and level (primary and secondary), public and pri-\nvate, and small and large schools.\nRecruitment of participants for the study was done by\ncontacting physical education teacher educators and school\nadministrators throughout Sydney, Australia. A list of poten-\ntial participants who fulfilled the requirements noted above\nwas generated and then used as the basis for the selection\nprocess (Table 1).\nWorking with the data.The transcripts were read and care-\nfully reviewed for thematic elements that were common to\neach participant's case. Profiles were then created that\ndescribed how their particular experiences in their schools\nshaped their first year of physical education teaching.\nThe transcripts were divided into data units for each\nresearch question, which represented a single point of infor-\nmation pertaining to each individual teacher's experience in\ntheir school. The transcripts were then reviewed again to\nidentify thematic elements that appeared to be common\nacross individual cases (Clandinin & Connelly, 1994; Miles\n& Huberman, 1994). Categories, themes, and tentative\nhypotheses about relationships were developed as the inter-\nmediate products of inductive reasoning (Buchbinder, 2011;\nTrustworthiness.To ensure trustworthiness of procedures\nused while conducting this project, two methods described\nby Guba and Lincoln (2004), peer debriefing and member\nchecking, were utilized. The peer debriefer, with whom I met\nbiweekly throughout the period of data collection and analy-\nsis, had access to all the data that were collected, this included\nresearch logs and interview transcripts. The central purpose\nof periodic meetings with the peer debriefer was to ensure\nthat the findings were grounded in the data, rather than in my\nown expectations and dispositions. Member checks were\npossible in that follow-up interviews were conducted. In\naddition, participants were given their own profiles to review\nand were invited to provide written feedback.\nAnalysis and Interpretation of Data\nThe analysis and interpretation of this study are reported in\ntwo sections. The first section provides profiles of two of the\neight teachers and how their particular schools operated and\nsupported, or did not support, their first year of teaching. The\ntwo selected participants to be reported in this article were\nchosen due to the variety of experiences they had. One\nteacher, Joe, was challenged daily and found his first full\nyear of teaching frustrating and tiresome. Sarah, the other\nteacher, had lots of support and actively shaped aspects of\nher classroom teaching. The second section of the article\nsummarizes the themes common to all participants.\nCollectively, these are brought together to relate the purpose\nof the study and respond to the research questions.\nTeacher Profiles\nJoe. Joe's first year of teaching took place at a state public\nhigh school in Sydney. He taught health and physical educa-\ntion to students in years 7 to 10. The isolation and lack of\nsupport he encountered from his fellow colleagues in his first\nfull year of teaching made his ability to plan engaging and\ninnovative lessons for his students quite difficult. He\nacknowledged that he was assigned to the \"beginning teacher\nTable 1.

Overall, he still felt\nthat he had a difficult time trying to implement a curriculum\nthat would move students toward his goals of knowledge and\nskill acquisition for lifelong participation in physical educa-\ntion. The problem was manifested further by the inclusion of\nthree African refugee students in his classes. He admitted he\nhad no idea how to teach them and engage them in his\nlessons.\nJoe felt confident as he began his first year of teaching, as\nhe felt that his student teaching experience had provided him\nwith the opportunity to become acquainted with the school\nroutine as well as the necessary lesson planning and behavior\nmanagement. As a student teacher, however, he had not had\nto deal with faculty peers, parents, and administrators, as\nwell as classes that contained students with extreme learning\nneeds. In addition, he had not been responsible for the cur-\nriculum, and above all, he had not been alone in a classroom\nenvironment.\nJoe was not completely alone in his first year of teaching.\nAlong with the beginning teacher support team, he also met\nregularly with a colleague, roughly once a fortnight. John, a\nsenior physical education teacher, taught at Joe's school, and\nwas assigned as his mentor teacher for the year. Both teach-\ners taught lessons together on Wednesdays and Fridays,\nwhich allowed Joe to develop some confidence in the plan-\nning, preparation, and execution of physical education\nlessons.\nJoe's biggest challenge in his first year of full-time teach-\ning was dealing with students from non-English speaking\ncountries which is something he had not had to do at all dur-\ning his teaching practicum. He was now in a school that had\na student population of 882 students of whom 71 were\nclassed as refugee students. These refugee students had little\nor no education background, nor did any of them understand\nthe concept of sitting in a classroom and listening to the\nteacher talk. He was now suddenly responsible for three of\nthem in his classes, and he needed to ensure that they were\nlearning and participating in the lessons and not distracting\nor interfering with his teaching or the learning of the other\nstudents.\nHealth and physical education in the school Joe is teach-\ning is not a strong priority as he commented during his inter-\nview. \"Some of the other teachers, the principal, and even the\nparents do not place a lot of emphasis on physical education,\nwhich can often make planning and preparing for lessons dif-\nficult.\" He discussed how in his beginning teacher support\ngroup he has made mention of the difficulties in catering for\nthe African refugee students in his class. He discussed how\nother beginning teachers in the group had also discussed\ntheir difficulty in engaging them in classes.\nI was frustrated at my lack of success in engaging and teaching\nthese students in my health and physical education class, so I\nbrought it up at our meeting and it turned out I was not the only\none. The deputy principal, who chairs these meetings, however\nwas not very helpful and became dismissive of our problems\nciting that we just need to get a grip with teaching and get the job\ndone. We were like, but we have not had any training or\nprofessional development in how to teach these students.\nJoe fought very hard to maintain his goals during his first\nyear of being a physical education teacher. Although he\nwanted his students to enjoy physical activity like any\nteacher, he also wanted them to learn something in his\nclasses, not just play games, and his fear was that because he\nlacked the skill to teach and engage the refugee students who\nwere in his class, his classes turned into just mere games. He\nalso lacked the ability to communicate with the parents of the\nAfrican students. When he called parents at home to discuss\nproblems with what their child was doing in class, he was\nconfronted with a language barrier that he or the school could\nnot break, giving further rise to frustration.\nJoe's experiences were further compounded by the inabil-\nity of the African students in his lessons to concentrate on the\ntask at hand. He commented,\nI would often be giving instruction to the students on technique,\nsuch as how to hold a cricket bat, or how to dribble the basketball\nand the African students would be talking to each other or\nlooking elsewhere . . . It was very off-putting for me. I would\nchat to them and tell them to pay attention but a minute or two\nlater they would be doing it again.\nDespite the negative experiences, including the lack of\ntraining, professional development, professional support\nfrom the school, and the inability to communicate effec-\ntively with parents, Joe persevered with his efforts to pro-\nvide what he considered to be a sound physical education\nprogram. He indicated that while it has not been easy, and he\nhas often gone home at the end of the day wondering what\nhe had achieved, he felt that he had made sufficient progress\nin getting to know and understand the African students and\nthe experiences that they bring to the classroom. He dis-\ncusses that\nit's a trust thing, it took a long time to establish with the students,\nand partly because for a lot of them they come from such a\ntraumatic background, and are used to running and hiding. PE\nand sport seems to be a great \"break out\" time for them to play\nand have fun, something I imagine they have not had a lot of\nopportunity to do in their lives.\nAsked about his thoughts on his education and being\nproperly trained to deal with these types of students, Joe\nremained fairly positive and upbeat about his course:\nLook, on one hand it is easy to say that Uni did not properly\nprepare me for the world of teaching, but then that is true of any\njob; it's not until you're put there that you really learn the ropes\nand start to gain valuable experience and knowledge about what\n6 SAGE Open\nyou need to do. It would have been nice to have some knowledge\nand background on what to do and how to engage these students\nbut Uni can't prepare you for everything!\nSarah. Sarah taught physical education to students in Grades\nK-6 at a Catholic primary school in Wollongong. Sarah's\nexperiences during her first year were in stark contrast to that\nof Joe's. The facilities at the school were amazing for a pri-\nmary school: two large gymnasia, a 33-m swimming pool,\ntwo tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and three\nspacious multi-purpose playing fields. The facilities, in con-\njunction with the variety of equipment available, allowed\nSarah to teach virtually any activity that would be appropri-\nate for primary-age school children.\nSarah had freedom to design her own physical education\nprogram. She explained that as a result of her autonomy, she\nhad found it easy to adapt her teaching methods and goals of\ncooperation, skill acquisition, and enhancement of students'\nself-esteem to her new environment. She was also able to\naddress theAfrican refugee students in her classes quite well.\nUnlike Joe, who taught 15 of the 71 African refugee students\nwho attended his school, Sarah as a primary physical educa-\ntion teacher would teach all 89 African refugee students\nacross the week. The school where Sarah was teaching was\nwell prepared for the specific and special learning needs that\nthe African refugee students would require. A specialist\nAfrican teacher was placed at the school all week in the role\nof a support aid, but, as described by Sarah, this teacher was\nalso very much like a \"tribal/elder\" figure to the students and\nwas a member of the local African community. She was a\ncontact between the school and the parents, as well as dou-\nbling as a translator for both the students and parents when\ncommunicating with the school and teachers.\nSarah, being a physical education specialist in the school,\nwas the only physical education teacher present. She\nacknowledged that at times this was difficult but neverthe-\nless made good friends and contacts with the other teachers\nwho were teaching at the school. Sarah added,\nIt could get a little lonely sometimes with no other teachers to\ntalk to on the subject matter of PE; but most of the time it was\nfine; and there were always an abundance of students willing to\ncome up and chat and want to play.\nAlthough there were good support structures in place\nwithin the school and with the aid of a local African com-\nmunity liaison officer also placed in the school, Sarah\nacknowledges that she did have some challenging moments.\nOne such challenge which she recalls quite freely was a\nlunch time playground duty that she was doing, and a large\nschool yard fight broke out between a number of the older\nAfrican and Lebanese boys on the playground. She felt\nquite intimidated at attempting to step in and break up the\nfight as not all of the boys were small and tiny. She\ncomments,\nThis one day when I was on playground duty I was quite scared\nand intimidated for both myself and the boys fighting in case\none of them got seriously hurt. Attempting to move in and break\nup the fight was also quiet confronting.\nAsked about her thoughts on her education and being\nproperly trained to deal with these types of students, Sarah\nwas very complimentary and praise-worthy of her pre-\nteacher education training:\nI really enjoyed my Uni course and I believe that it properly\nprepared me for the students that I would be teaching. It gave me\na great core knowledge set that, of course, I have added to since\nbeginning teaching, but I was never led to believe that my Uni\ncourse would provide me with all of the answers . . . and guess\nwhat, it didn't! But I believe it provided me with the necessary\nskill set to get my job done and done well!\nBeginning Teacher's Common Experiences for All\nParticipants\nEach of the beginning teachers described how throughout\ntheir first full year of teaching physical education in the vari-\nous schools they encountered difficult and confronting\nmoments, not only with the African refugee students in their\nclasses but also the mainstream White Anglo-Saxon stu-\ndents. Although each case was different, there were some\nsimilarities that occurred among all eight teachers. Six fac-\ntors were identified as being the most significant characteris-\ntics common to each of the beginning teachers: the physical\neducation facilities; the presence or absence of teaching col-\nleagues; the scheduling of physical education classes; the\ncommunity environment; communication among staff, stu-\ndents, and parents; and the actual students.\nIn addition to the six significant factors that were explic-\nitly identified by the participants as influential during their\nfirst year of teaching, important contextual conditions could\nbe inferred from close examination of the interview tran-\nscripts. Unarticulated factors (Clandinin & Connelly, 1994)\nwere implicit in many of the stories, and some of these\nappeared to be sufficiently common to the first-year experi-\nence to represent additional themes of influence in the pro-\ncess of learning to teach physical education in schools. These\nunarticulated factors included the following: the role of\nphysical education in the schools, the teachers' sense of effi-\ncacy, the teachers'understanding of refugee students, and the\nrealities of teaching in school versus what the teacher\nexpected while at university (see Table 2).\nThe themes in Table 2 summarize the results of this study\nand respond to the research questions. The discussion that\nfollows does not attend to the themes individually, but\nfocuses instead on several subtle points within the themes.\nThe beginning teachers in this study were characteristic of\nmany first-year teachers in that they were expected to per-\nform the same duties as a seasoned veteran in the education\nsystem. Although many of the participants were assigned\nmentors, the participants found these mentors to be of little\nhelp beyond learning the daily routines of the school.\nAlso, like other beginning teachers, most of the novices\nexperienced \"reality shock\" (Ibrahim, 2012), but in the case\nof these beginning teachers, there was an additional cultural\nshock with the teaching of African refugee students. Nearly\nall participants reported that they had not anticipated such\ninadequate facilities, their rigorous teaching schedules, or\nthe lack of support received from supervisors and colleagues,\nespecially in terms of how best to include and cater for the\ndiverse learning needs of the refugee students. Moreover,\nwith few exceptions, their stories indicate that they were not\nprepared to confront the social and cultural forces within the\nschool community with respect to the refugee students.\nThe nature of physical education and its consequent place\nwithin the school and wider community clearly indicated to\na number of the beginning teachers that they were teaching a\nsubject which is not regarded as having a high status. In\nterms of facilities, a number of the teachers were forced to\nconduct their classes in areas and with time allocations that\nwere less than adequate for instruction and were forced to do\nso with fewer resources than would be considered minimally\nadequate in the classroom. Sarah seemed to be the only\nteacher in the group who had adequate equipment and facili-\nties to conduct her lessons. The remainder spoke quite poorly\nof their physical education setups. Grace and Damien's situ-\nation exemplifies their beliefs that facilities strongly influ-\nence their curriculum and their goals for their students. Grace\nand Damien's reactions to their facilities were typical of\nmany participants in this study:\nThe conditions in the school for teaching and assessing physical\neducation are a total joke. I have a lopped sided basketball court\nthat is on a 45degree slope, a small cow paddock oval that I am\nnot allowed to use as it seems there may have been asbestos\nburied underneath it, and I have a hall that swelters in the heat\nbecause there is no air-conditioning, not to mention the hand me\ndown bats and balls I have which pre-date World War II. (Grace)\nIt's a concrete jungle, I have next to no room at all to do practical\nclasses on site, which means for most of my classes I have to\ntake the students down to the local park which is a good 10\nminute walk down and 10 minute walk back, which means I'm\nspending 1/3 of my lesson traveling to and from the oval. It's\njust not good! (Damien)\nMixed messages were reported about the presence of a\ncolleague teacher. Some of the participants who did not have\na colleague teacher present indicated that this allowed great\nflexibility for them as a teacher in how they taught and pro-\ngrammed their classes. This absence was generally reported\nin primary schools. These teachers who did not have a col-\nleague present also indicated that it would have been nice for\nsomeone to let them know that what they were doing in class\nwas correct. The participant teachers that did have a col-\nleague present were a little uncomfortable as they indicated\nit was like they were back doing their practicums and needed\nto be supervised at all times. Lyndal and Matthew indicated\ntheir feelings on a colleague teacher being with them during\nsome of their lessons:\nIt was kind of a catch twenty-two situation. On one hand I didn't\nlike it because I am a qualified teacher now and don't need to be\nsupervised at every point of my lesson, while on the other hand\nit was handy to have someone there at different times to support\nTable 2.

(Lyndal)\nHaving completed my practicums already and had supervising\nteachers and university supervisors sitting in on my lessons, I\nthought I had done and completed all of that, so to have someone\nback in my lessons again was quite daunting and difficult.\n(Matthew)\nThe scheduling of classes while not a hugely negative\narea for the beginning teachers still proved to have some\nfrustrations. Generally, these surrounded the lack of commu-\nnication surrounding the timing of classes. This tended to be\nan issue more so with the high school teachers who taught a\ncombination of theory and practical-based lessons. The pri-\nmary school teachers did not have a choice in classes as they\ntaught practical lessons all day. The community environ-\nments were also not a hugely negative experience for the stu-\ndents; however, two participants did mention that this was\nthe worst part of their physical education lessons, when tak-\ning the students down to the local park. Ebony and Peter\ncommented,\nTaking 12-year-olds down the road to the park is hard enough at\nthe best of times, combine this when you have a group of\nstudents that have never been able to walk down the road in their\nown country for fear of being chased or attacked and you can\nimagine that a simple 5 minute walk can end up taking the better\npart of the entire lesson because they stop at every house to look\nand stare and talk. (Ebony)\nWhilst it is not ideal having to walk students down to the local\npark for their PE lessons I guess it is what it is so I try and make\nthe most of it; using this walk as part of, or, your warm-up and\ncool-down activities. This is one way I have tried to make the\nmost of it, but in all honesty I hate it! 20 minutes of my lessons\nare wasted doing this and to make matters worse the students\nsometimes need to get changed as well which wastes even more\ntime. (Peter)\nCommunication proved to be a critical issue that all of the\nbeginning teachers identified as needing to be improved in\nthe schools where they were teaching. Whether it was com-\nmunication between colleagues and themselves, between\nstudents and themselves, or parents and themselves, overall\nthe participants felt that this was an area that let them down\nconsiderably. The participants responded to these problems\nin ways that reflected individual skills and dispositions, as\nwell as the unique features of each school. For example, con-\nversations in the interviews often touched on the participants'\nneed to feel some sense of success in their day-to-day\nexchanges and encounters with the staff and students. At\nmany of the schools, however, it was difficult to sustain any\nsuch practical sense of accomplishment due to the high\ndegree of non-English speaking backgrounds that many of\nthe refugee students brought to the schools.\nIt's just that some days I feel like I have wasted my time and that\neverything I have said and taught in a lesson has not been heard\nor taken in by the students. I leave school utterly exhausted and\nI feel like I have nothing to show for all of the effort I have put\nin. (Lyndal)\nIt can be a very frustrating job at times, I'm reminded of the old\nsaying you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink\nbecause there are some days I feel like that after having taught a\nclass, just really frustrated and like, I thought I had explained\nmyself fully but nope they still didn't get it. (Peter)\nThe participants reported they consciously altered both\ntheir teaching behaviors and their teaching objectives so that\nthey would be more congruent with what they perceived to\nbe the norms of their schools. Indeed, all of the participants\nwho reported having to adjust their teaching styles and goals\nalso indicated the firm belief that if (or when) their situation\nchanged, they would (and could) return to their earlier teach-\ning methods.\nThe participants' commitment to the teaching profession\nwas a constant powerful message that came through the\ninterviews, despite the many challenges that the beginning\nteachers faced. Joe acknowledged that his intentions were to\nkeep trying to get the best out of all of his students:\nIt's been a long and challenging year . . . there have been times\nwhen I have felt like it wasn't worth it, but overall I feel as\nthough I did achieve something . . . and it can only get easier\nfrom here!\nJoe's sense of efficacy in his teaching was not attained\nthrough his students' level of achievement and participation,\nbut rather by his feeling that he had made a difference in their\npersonal lives and instilled some thought of the importance\nof physical education.\nMany of these beginning teachers were able to look\nbeyond the limitations of their schools, their university edu-\ncation, and their experience and feel at least some sense of\nhaving done worthy work. Although it may have been neces-\nsary to modify their initial intentions and plans of what\nwould work in the classroom with the students, many of\nthese teachers were able to look forward to a second year in\nthe same school with a degree of optimism. There were,\nhowever, some teachers who believed the cultural and social\nclimates and difficulties that they encountered in their first\nyear within the school and community were just too difficult\nand would not improve. Those teachers decided not to leave\nteaching but to leave their present posting in search of a\nschool that might provide better support.\nI'll be back next year, bigger and stronger and more prepared,\nit's a challenge, but life isn't easy and I like a challenge! And\nnow that I have some experience under my belt it can only get\neasier from here.\nIt has been a tough year, I have often questioned myself during\nthe year if teaching was in fact the right career choice for me,\nand after this year I think the answer is no. I don't know if it is\nthe stress, the work demands, the students, or all of it combined,\nperhaps it has just been this school and if I went to some other\nschool things may be different? I don't know what I will do next\nyear. (Joe).\nConclusion\nThe results of this study, when added and compared with the\ninformation provided in the literature, suggest that despite\nsome modest efforts, many primary and secondary schools\nprovide inadequate support for beginning teachers. First-\nyear physical education teachers, like other beginning teach-\ners, still learn the ropes alone, especially if they are employed\nas a physical education specialist in a primary school.\nMoreover, the subject matter of physical education presents\nunique problems in accomplishing the transition to profes-\nsional teaching because of its need on equipment and timeta-\nbling, and its constant need to advocate itself against other\nThis study has highlighted the challenges beginning\nteachers face; in particular, the uniqueness of integrating and\nincluding a number of African refugee students into their\nclasses which this study has highlighted. The study provides\ninsight into how eight first-year physical education teachers\nengaged with African refugee students in their physical edu-\ncation lessons.\nThe study has also highlighted the need for further inves-\ntigation into the area of refugee education in Australian\nschools especially given the vast number of refugee students\nthat migrate to Australia. There is limited research that\nfocuses on linking experiences with refugee education and\nthe area of physical education. The current study has high-\nlighted the benefits of integrating refugee students into\nschool-based education and therefore, this issue needs fur-\nther, more detailed, research to investigate the benefits on a\nlarger, more long-term, scale.\nAt the time of the last interview, six of the participants had\nintended to remain at their schools. Ebony and Joe had\nsought and found employment as physical education teach-\ners at other schools. Despite their struggles to reconcile what\nwas promoted in their teacher education programs with what\nwas possible in their schools, all participants wanted to con-\ntinue teaching physical education.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlvarez, R., & Urla, J.
