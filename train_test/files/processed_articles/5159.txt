Performance was compared\nin a prospective, multicenter validation cohort of the Dutch acute Stroke study (DUST) by calculating area under the\nreceiver operating curves (AUROC). With group lasso regression analysis, we constructed a prediction model, incor-\nporating patient characteristics next to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) items. Finally, we developed a\ndecision tree algorithm based on dichotomized NIHSS items.\nResults: We identified seven LAVO-prediction scales. From DUST, 1316 patients (35.8% LAVO-rate) from 14 centers\nwere available for validation. FAST-ED and RACE had the highest AUROC (both >0.81, p < 0.01 for comparison with other\nscales). Group lasso analysis revealed a LAVO-prediction model containing seven NIHSS items (AUROC 0.84). With the\nGACE (Gaze, facial Asymmetry, level of Consciousness, Extinction/inattention) decision tree, LAVO is predicted (AUROC\n0.76) for 61% of patients with assessment of only two dichotomized NIHSS items, and for all patients with four items.\nConclusion: External validation of seven LAVO-prediction scales showed AUROCs between 0.75 and 0.83. Most scales,\nhowever, appear too complex for Emergency Medical Services use with prehospital validation generally lacking. GACE is\nthe first LAVO-prediction scale using a simple decision tree as such increasing feasibility, while maintaining high accuracy.\nPrehospital prospective validation is planned.\n",

Two\nreviewers (GTK and TTMN) independently screened\ntitles and abstracts for eligibility. Full-text versions\nwere obtained from all studies that were considered to\nbe potentially relevant by one or both reviewers. After a\nfirst selection, bibliographies of all relevant studies were\nsearched manually for additional studies and this\nmethod of crosschecking was continued until no further\npublications were found. Authors of relevant articles\nwere contacted for supplementary information.\nCohort studies were reviewed with the STROBE\n(Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies\nin Epidemiology) statement and had to comply with the\nfollowing inclusion criteria: (1) original data report on\nan inception cohort or a clinical trial; (2) a clinical score\nhad to be assessed within 6 h from stroke onset; (3) it\nhad to be clear from the paper at what moment and by\nwhom (e.g. EMS personnel, neurologist) a clinical score\nwas assessed; (4) assessment of LAVO had to be done\nwith either CT angiography (CTA), magnetic reson-\nance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography;\n(5) data available on the performance of clinical\nscore(s) used had to be expressed as: area under the\nreceiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC),\nsensitivity/specificity or likelihood ratio, and (6) the clin-\nical score had to be retrievable from NIHSS. Because\nstudies had to fulfill these strict inclusion criteria, no\nfurther formal quality assessment was undertaken.\nWe estimated and/or retrieved the following char-\nacteristics from identified studies: feasibility for EMS\nuse, interrater reliability and external validity (i.e.\napplicability to the unselected population of suspected\nacute stroke patients).\nValidation cohort\nTo assess validity, we used the Dutch acute Stroke\nstudy (DUST) cohort.23 DUST is a multicenter, pro-\nspective, observational cohort study conducted in six\nuniversity and eight non-university hospitals in the\ntive patients >18 years presented at the emergency\ndepartment with a suspicion of acute (<9 h) ischemic\nstroke (based on clinical assessment and non-contrast\nCT (NCCT) imaging) and NIHSS >1 and/or con-\nsidered eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)\nwere included. All patients received CTA within 9 h\nafter symptom onset as part of the CT stroke work-\nup including NCCT, CT perfusion and CTA. The\nDUST imaging protocol has been described before.24\nAnalysis\nPatients with CTA yielding insufficient diagnostic qual-\nity to assess LAVO were excluded. We defined LAVO\naccording to current IAT-eligible criteria: proximal\nmiddle cerebral artery (MCA: M1- and/or M2-segment),\nproximal anterior cerebral artery (ACA: A1- and/or\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 0(0)\n2 International Journal of Stroke 0(0)\nA2-segment), intracranial carotid artery (ICA) or\ntandem (ICA plus MCA) occlusion.25 Patients with\nincomplete admission NIHSS were excluded from ana-\nlyses related to validation of existing scales, since NIHSS\nwas required to reconstruct these.\nDescriptive statistics were used to determine baseline\ncharacteristics of the validation cohort. Categorical\nvariables were compared with the 2 test and presented\nas number (percentage). Continuous variables are com-\npared using the t test or Mann\u00adWhitney U test, and are\npresented as mean \u00c6 standard deviation or median\n(interquartile range, IQR) if appropriate.\nTo assess predictive value, we computed AUROC\nand respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per iden-\ntified LAVO-prediction scale, and for the NIHSS and\nFAST score.\nHaving data from 14 sites participating in DUST,\nwe performed external validation by excluding one site\nat a time (cross-validation) for every scale. This is an\nimportant advantage, because external validation gives\na better indication of the generalization error. We per-\nformed all pairwise comparisons of the cross-validated\nAUROCs of the various scales using the DeLong's test.26\nFor the development of a new prediction model, we\ndid not exclude patients with NIHSS items that could\nnot be assessed since this reflects clinical practice.\nIn addition, we introduced (combinations of) patient\ncharacteristics into the model that we considered to\nbe predictive of LAVO provided that these also differed\non baseline between LAVO and non-LAVO patients.\nThese include: history of atrial fibrillation (AF), AF\nwithout the use of anticoagulation, and AF without\ndiabetes mellitus and/or hyperlipidemia.\nGroup lasso regression analysis was used to reveal\n(a combination of) NIHSS items and patient character-\nistics yielding the highest predictive value for LAVO.27\nThe lasso is a popular method for penalized regression\nand classification that also performs variable selec-\ntion.28 The group lasso is a variant where the user\ncan specify groups of variables (e.g. all variables\nwithin one NIHSS item) that are either all in or all\nout of the model.29 We used the R package ``grpreg''\nwith default settings to fit the group lasso.30\nIn addition, a decision tree algorithm and diagram\nbased on dichotomized NIHSS items ((1) `yes/present/\nabnormal', or (0) `no/absent/normal') was developed.\nA decision tree works by consecutively assessing the\nitem with the highest predictive value in the (remaining)\ncohort, as such leading to a minimum amount of items\nto be assessed to reach an outcome (i.e. LAVO or non-\nLAVO), with the highest possible predictive value.\nCross-validation (as described before) will determine\nthe number of knots in the decision tree. The decision\ntree was fitted using the R-package ``rpart'' using\ndefault settings. In particular, this means that the default\npriors are proportional to the data counts, the losses\ndefault to 1, and the split defaults to the Gini index.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS soft-\nware (version 23, IBM, New York, USA), and R soft-\nResults\nSystematic literature search\nThe MEDLINE search yielded 185 citations, the\nEMBASE search 263 citations, the EMCARE search\n58 citations, and the Web of Science search 163 cit-\nations.

Screening reference lists\nand a search of the Science Citation Index yielded 12\nadditional studies. One-hundred-and-sixteen citations\nremained for full text assessment.

For both the group of patients with\nan abnormal gaze (27%, left side of the diagram) as for\nthe group of patients with a normal gaze (73%, right\nside of diagram), the following item with the highest\npredictive value for LAVO is determined.

A seemingly important advan-\ntage of RACE over FAST-ED is that it was validated in\nthe prehospital setting. Nevertheless, RACE appears\ntoo complex for prehospital EMS use, comprising a\n5-item, 9-point assessment in which the decision to\nuse or omit certain scale items (i.e. agnosia, aphasia)\ndepends on the assumed involved hemisphere.9\nIndeed, during the validation phase, the scale was not\nperformed in 40% of suspected stroke patients.9\nAlthough FAST-ED is based on the widely used\nFAST score and outperforms the NIHSS for prediction\nof LAVO in our database, it has potential drawbacks as\nit (a) imposes scoring a `partial', `mild' or `moderate'\ndeficit in most items, hampering interrater reliability;\nand (b) uses complex items (e.g. extinction/inattention)\nwhich are difficult for EMS personnel to assess.13,31\nG-FAST seems more feasible for EMS use.\nHowever, in the original G-FAST study (i) vessel\nimaging modality to detect LAVO is unclear, and\nmore importantly, (ii) definition of LAVO does not\nTable 2.

We accepted a small reduction in\nAUROC for the GACE decision tree (compared with\nthe group lasso model), as we estimate that the\nprehospital feasibility is high since EMS personnel\nonly has to take two steps to rule out transportation\nto a CSC for a substantial proportion of patients (61%,\nsee Table 3), and only four for the remainder.\nFrom a clinical perspective, it seems remarkable that\nfacial asymmetry is such an important scoring item for\nGACE since it appears to have little localizing value.32\nIt is important, however, to bear in mind that it is not\nthis separate item, but the combination with gaze\nassessment that leads to a high predictive value for\nLAVO in our cohort.\nIn addition to LAVO prediction, allocation decision\nalso depends on (1) the impact of delay on clinical effi-\ncacy of both IVT and IAT, (2) patient characteristics\n(e.g. medical history, time from symptom onset, course\nof the disease) and (3) logistic factors (e.g. urban/rural\narea, number of comprehensive and primary stroke\ncenters (PSC) and distance to scene of stroke, inter-\nhospital distance, in-hospital door-to-needle and\ndoor-to-groin times).33 Therefore, we chose to display\nROCs, enabling determination of a clinically relevant\ncut-off point considering local circumstances.\nMoreover, allocation decision highly depends on\nwhat kind of error one is willing to allow: (a) having\nmore patients come to a CSC accepting that some of\nthese may not have LAVO and incorrectly bypass a\nPSC delaying IVT (false-positives); or (b) being focused\non only allocating LAVO-patients to a CSC accepting\nthat some LAVO-patients will primarily be transported\nto a PSC without IAT-facilities (false-negatives).\nFigure 3.

Scores for this patient on the\nbest performing LAVO-prediction scales in our valid-\nG-FAST 4/4. When applying the original authors'\ncut-off point, the patient has a moderate to high\nchance of LAVO, advising direct transport to a CSC\nwith G-FAST, and a transport to the nearest PSC with\nRACE and FAST-ED. These scales, however, do not\ntake into account local circumstances.\nConsider that a PSC is located 10 min- and a CSC\n20 min from scene of stroke (with equal door-to-needle\ntimes). Bypassing the PSC is associated with a 10-min\ndelay to IVT but a more substantial time delay to IAT\nis avoided by preventing inter-hospital transfer.\nKeeping in mind that IVT has limited efficacy in\n(such as G-FAST) seems the more desirable for this\nspecific situation.\nHowever, when transport time to a PSC is only 10\nand to a CSC is 50 min, a scale with a high sensitivity is\nless desirable. Most patients (including false-positives)\nwill then be transported to the CSC with a more sub-\nstantial time delay to IVT (40 min) for non-LAVO\npatients and, in addition, overloading the CSC with a\nlarge volume of patients. Therefore, in this situation, a\nscale with a high specificity (such as RACE or FAST-\nED) would probably be the more desired choice.\nOverall, time is brain, but since LAVO-patients\nappear to clinically benefit more substantially from ear-\nlier IAT than overall stroke patients benefit from earlier\nIVT,3,40 a moderate to high likelihood of LAVO seems\nto allow a fair time delay to IVT. How much delay\nexactly, however, remains complex, as logistics (which\nare dynamic as resources shift over time) determine the\namount of accepted time delay at expense of the number\nof false-positively referred patients. To what extent\nimplementation of a clinical LAVO-prediction scale\naffects local logistics and health care-related costs has\nto be estimated, since no formal cost-effectiveness ana-\nlysis was performed.\nOur study has several limitations. First, our study\nwas performed retrospectively which could have led\nto selection bias. Data, however, were collected pro-\nspectively minimizing such an effect. Second, our\ncohort does not represent an unselected prehospital\ncohort. For example, ICHs were not included, leading\nto an artificially high prevalence of LAVO and\nIVT-treated patients, which could result in an overesti-\nmation of the prediction scales. To what extent this\ninfluences a decision to use a scale depends very much\non local circumstances since ICHs are often concen-\ntrated in CSCs.\nOf note, the retrospective nature and lack of an\nunselected cohort account for all LAVO-prediction\nscales included in our analysis and therefore do not\ndiminish validity of between scale comparisons.\nFinally, clinical scale assessment was performed in\nthe in-hospital setting, rendering translation to the pre-\nhospital setting limited. Indeed, prospective validation\nin this setting is much warranted and our results should\nprimarily be considered an important step towards\na large prehospital prospective validation study which\nwe planned to embed in the ongoing `A Reduction\nin Time with Electronic Monitoring in Stroke'\n(ARTEMIS) trial conducted within three EMS regions,\nwhich allows patients to be electronically tracked from\nthe first moment the dispatch office is alarmed up until\nstart of reperfusion therapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:\nNevertheless, clinical LAVO-detection could also be\nvery helpful in order to optimize in-hospital logistics of\npotential IAT-eligible patients (e.g. pre-notification of\nneuro-interventional team and preparation of the angio\nsuite can reduce door-to-groin times).42\nConclusion\nWe identified seven LAVO-prediction scales of which\nFAST-ED and RACE performed best and comparable\nto the NIHSS. An important limitation remains; how-\never, that prospective validation in the prehospital\nEMS setting is lacking.\nWe developed a practical and easy-to-use decision\ntree that utilizes only two dichotomized NIHSS items\nfor LAVO prediction for 61% of patients, and four\nitems for the remaining patients in our cohort.\nProspective validation of GACE in the prehospital set-\nting is planned.\n"
