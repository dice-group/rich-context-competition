In this discussion, the most lasting argument is that divorce rates are\ninversely related to the degree of rights the \"wife-takers\" acquire over women through\nmarriage payments (Hutchinson 1990). The argument also offers a ready-made\nexplanation for the vulnerability of marriage in populations with a matrilineal descent\nsystem. In matrilineal populations, the reproductive potential of women belongs to the\nlineage of the wife, and that is, among others, reflected in consistently lower marriage\ntransactions. Both these characteristics are thought to undermine the stability of\nmarriages. In addition, matrilineal descent systems are often accompanied by uxorilocal\nresidence after marriage, thereby de facto severing the husband from the resource base\nof his power and authority. While western observers are often found guilty of inflating\nthe importance of kinship systems (Marks and Rathbone 1983), observations regarding\nthe instability of marriage in matrilineal regions of southern Malawi are remarkably\nThe demographic study of marriage and divorce is less detailed and often of\nsecondary interest in a discussion of the proximate determinants of fertility (Bledsoe\nand Pison 1994, Brandon 1990). The absence of adequate data is partly responsible for\nthat. Vital registration systems are virtually nonexistent and matrimonial histories are\nweakly covered in both censuses and surveys. The standard Demographic and Health\nSurveys (DHS) offer little additional information compared to censuses because they\nonly record the marital status at the time of the survey. The existence of survey data\nwith an extensive coverage of matrimonial histories thus offers an opportunity for the\nadvancement of a demographic analysis of nuptiality dynamics in Africa.\nThree views are considered the canvas against which I give meaning to the results\nobtained here. In highly stylized form, the first and most persistent idea in the literature\ntreats the power and autonomy of women as a mechanism that destabilizes the bond\nbetween partners. In the anthropological literature it is the power of the lineage of the\nwife that is stressed rather than the position of women themselves, but it is often\nassumed that it also affects the balance of power within the household. In a more\neconomically inspired worldview, increased labor market participation of women is\nthought to decrease the returns from marriage because it undermines a system of\nproductive efficiency that rests on gender-based specialization in the household (Becker\n1991). Though the details of the argument are less relevant in the context of the present\nstudy, it encapsulates the same idea that greater (economic) autonomy of women\ncontributes to marital instability. At this level of abstraction, the destabilizing force of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 177\ntreats modernization as the root cause for elevated divorce rates.\nOn the other hand, Goode also believes that modernization and industrialization\ncan contribute to marriage stability in high divorce systems. The assumed mechanism is\nan increasing pressure on traditional marriage practices (e.g., arranged marriage) that\nare conducive to instability. This argument is picked up by Jones (1997), who asserts\nthat the increasing autonomy of youngsters (and thus of young women) and a greater\nfreedom in partner selection contributed to the stability of marriages in Southeast Asia.\nAmong Muslims in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, impressive reductions in\ndivorce rates occurred between the 1950s and the 1980s, a period characterized by\nongoing industrialization and modernization. A similar argument had already been\ndefended in the 1930s for Japan (Iwasaki 1931). Although these authors attempt to\nexplain changes over time and the present study is based on a cross section, the\nhypothesis could be maintained that greater empowerment of women contributes to\nmarital stability.\nThe third hypothesis introduces a life course perspective. In a discussion of\nmarriage and divorce in West Africa, Locoh and Thiriat (1995) maintain that marriage\nand divorce are two of the strategies that women utilize in their quest for greater control\nover their lives. The struggle for autonomy is a multistage process in which women first\nliberate themselves from the control of the paternal household through marriage. The\nprocess is completed through divorce, by which they obtain independence from the\nhusband and his kin. First marriage, from that perspective, is a rite of passage to greater\nself-control and part of a process of female empowerment.\nRather than deriving and testing some of the presuppositions implied in the views\njust introduced, I let myself lead by some empirical observations on divorce\nencountered in the literature to see whether they match the results for Malawi. At a later\nstage, I confront them with the ideas presented above. The choice for Malawi is guided\nby the availability of adequate survey data. It is of further interest since it falls outside\nthe range of countries that are better covered by studies of nuptiality (Note 1). Malawi\nis also characterized by an intriguing heterogeneity in religious beliefs and kinship\nsystems.\nIn the ensuing sections of this paper, I briefly describe the setting and the data,\ndiscuss some of the empirical relationships reported in the literature, give estimates of\nthe frequency of divorce and remarriage in the MDICP sample, and present results of an\nanalysis of the determinants of marriage instability. The final part contains an\nexploration of differences in the residence pattern of women in first and higher order\nmarriages. The latter is an attempt to get an insight into the possibly empowering effect\nof divorce and remarriage in women's lives.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n178 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2. The setting and the data\nEven by African standards, Malawi is a relatively poor country. It ranks 151st (out of\n164) on the Human Development Index and its GDP per capita is $586 US (in\npurchasing power parity) compared to an average of $1,640 for Sub-Saharan Africa\ncan be held accountable for that decline (UNAIDS/WHO 2000). The population growth\nrate in the 1990s is estimated to be around 2 percent. The TFR of 6.2 is still high, but it\nIn Figure 1, Malawi stands out because of a marriage pattern that is more\ncomparable to Burkina Faso than to the other southern and east African countries.\nWhile marriage is virtually universal in all countries shown, Malawi is among the\ncountries where women marry relatively early. In the age groups 15-19 and 20-24 close\n% ever married (at time of interview) % divorced (at time of interview)\nFigure 1: Proportions divorced and ever married by age in selected African\nNote:\nSource: Demographic and Health Surveys (http://www.measuredhs.com/)\nEthiopia\nTanzania\nMalawi\nZimbabwe\nCameroon\nNigeria\nBurkina Faso\nEthiopia\nT anz ania\nMalawi\nZimbabwe\nCameroon\nNigeria\nBurkinaFaso\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 179\nIn addition to a pattern of early and universal marriage, divorce is relatively\ncommon. Although the percentages reported in Figure 1 are confounded by the speed\nand frequency of remarriage, Malawi is characterized by a high incidence of divorce.\nFour percent of the women in the age group 20-24 were divorced at the time of the\nsurvey, and among the 45-49 year olds this is around 7.5 percent. These figures are\nslightly lower than the prevalence of divorce in the sample that is used here. As we will\nsee later, there are important regional variations.\nThe data used in the remainder of this paper come from the female questionnaires\nof the second round of the longitudinal Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project\n(MDICP) conducted in 2001 (Note 2). It is a probability sample of women in three rural\ndistricts. In addition to the classical socioeconomic and demographic background\ncharacteristics, the second wave of the MDICP recorded matrimonial histories (i.e., the\ntiming and duration of first, last, and one-but-last marriage). Although the survey is\nexceptional in its coverage of matrimonial histories, it does not include information on\ncohabitation, on the costs of marriage transactions, marriage negotiations, or a more\nsubtle approach to measuring marriage as a process rather than a discrete event (see\nVan de Walle 1968, Meekers 1992). When reference is made to divorce, it also includes\nseparation. The combination of both categories is justified by the fact that periods of\nseparation are often followed by divorce. In addition, separation only accounts for\naround 5 percent of the marriages that ended (Note 3).\nThe sample size for this analysis is 1342 ever-married women (Note 4), more or\nless equally divided between the three districts. The Rumphi district in the north is\ncharacterized by a predominantly patrilineal system of descent with patrilocal residence\nafter marriage and inheritance traced through sons. The ethnic groups in the south\n(Balaka) follow a matrilineal system of descent and inheritance, and residence after\nmarriage is most often matrilocal. In Mchinji, in the center of the country, descent is\nless rigidly matrilineal and residence may be either matrilocal or patrilocal.\nMarriage negotiations are less extensive and less formalized in the matrilineal\ngroups in the south than in the north. In these settings, the costs of marriage transactions\ntend to be lower as well. Marriage transactions are not very substantial in any of the\nthree districts, and the role of parents and kin in the decision-making process is fairly\nlimited. Most often, it is the future husband who initiates marriage negotiations, and the\ninstances where the parents steer the choice of the spouse or the outcome of the\nnegotiations are rare. Women are usually consulted and their opinion is important in the\ndecision-making process. As a result of the ease with which marriage negotiations take\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n180 http://www.demographic-research.org\nSources of bias\nMost of the analyses presented here are based on life-table methods applied to\nretrospective data derived from female interviews. These methods are well designed to\nhandle censoring as a result of the timing of the interview as well as censoring due to\nthe death of the husband. There is, however, no appropriate way to account for possible\ndifferences in female mortality by marital status because women who died between the\ntwo waves were simply not re-interviewed. This bias may not be as innocent as it\nseems. In an era of high HIV prevalence, both marital stability and AIDS mortality can\nbecome functions of extra-marital sexual activity. The most obvious effect of such an\nassociation would be the underestimation of divorce in a cross-sectional sample.\nThough there is little more we can do at this stage than acknowledge the problem;\nsubsequent rounds of data collection in the MDICP will allow for a longitudinal\nanalysis of divorce and this problem will be overcome.\nAnother source of bias is caused by differences in the propensity to migrate by\nmarital status. To the extent that marriages involve partners from different locations,\nmarriage breakup almost automatically leads to migration. In the most obvious\nscenario, the residence of one of the spouses will not change while the other moves\nback to the village where he or she came from, or, to another place altogether. Because\nthe MDICP sample sites are situated in rural areas, post-divorce migration out of the\nsample sites leads to an underestimation of divorce. Of all women interviewed in the\nfirst round of the MDICP, about 15 percent could not be retrieved in the second round\nbecause of migration-related causes. In addition, there is a logical reason to believe that\nthese post-divorce migration patterns are linked to sex and the residence pattern after\nmarriage. Where residence after marriage is virilocal, women are more likely to move\nout whereas husbands are expected to head off if residence is uxorilocal. In southern\nlocal narratives, it is often said that the man is supposed to \"leave with his blanket\",\nmeaning that he is not only expected to leave after divorce, but that he cannot claim any\nmaterial goods from the household \u00adexcept for his blanket\u00ad nor the custody over the\nchildren (Zulu 1996). This logic would lead us to expect sex-based differences in\ndivorce-related migration out of the different sample districts. Even though the\nobserved differences in the loss of follow-up between the three districts point in that\ndirection (i.e., slightly higher loss of follow-up in Rumphi and Mchinji than in Balaka),\nit is not statistically significant. The attrition is nonetheless responsible for a slight\nunderestimation of divorce probabilities. It is much less certain whether or not these\nbiases affect parameter estimates in a multivariate analysis (Alderman et al. 2001,\nBignami et al. in this volume).\nOther confounding factors are related to the retrospective nature of the survey.\nThis may involve a bias in the definition of what a marriage constitutes if asked to\nevaluate retrospectively, and, partly related to that, the omission of early and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 181\nunsuccessful marriages by older women (Brandon 1990). In addition, there are the\nsources of bias common to most surveys in developing countries such as the\nmisreporting of ages and timing of events. To minimize the number of individuals with\nmissing ages, the interviewers were instructed to probe. No such procedure was\nfollowed for `age at marriage', and the number of missing values on that variable is\nconsiderable.\n3. Variables and expected outcomes\nTo organize the discussion of possible determinants of divorce, I build on the argument\nof Murphy (1985) that less volitional factors (e.g., social class and religion) are not as\npowerful predictors of marital breakdown as behavioral aspects within the couple's\nrealm of control. Among the latter, he cites age at marriage, childbearing patterns, the\ntype of wedding ceremony, etc. What Murphy calls \"less volitional characteristics\", I\nwill label individual characteristics. The variables that Murphy identifies as \"volitional\"\ncharacterize couples rather than individuals. Here, they will be labeled couple or\nmarriage characteristics and deal with the residence pattern of the household after\nmarriage, the usual place of residence of the husband, ethnic homogamy and polygyny.\nAt least conceptually, appropriate models should account for the context wherein\nindividuals grow up and wherein marital decisions are taken. In the present discussion,\nthese could refer to the kinship and descent system, customs with regard to the division\nof property, legal constraints, agricultural systems, and possibly others. Most of these\ndata are not available, but I will use district to account for the heterogeneity in the\ncontext wherein marriage decisions are taken.\nIn the next section, an overview of individual and couple characteristics will be\npresented with a discussion of their effects as reported in the literature. Table 1 at the\nend of the section summarizes the distribution of these characteristics in the three\nsample districts.\n3.1. Individual characteristics\nBirth cohort\nTo examine a possible evolution over time, the most logical choice would be to control\nfor differences in the risk of divorce by marriage cohort. In the analyses presented here,\npreference was given to year of birth. This choice was driven by a concern to reduce the\nnumber of missing observations. Because the variance in age at first marriage (both\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n182 http://www.demographic-research.org\nover time and between districts) is fairly limited, we can use birth cohort as a substitute\nfor marriage cohort.\nEducation\nEducation is often used as a proxy for female empowerment. Results for the effect of\neducation on marital stability in Africa are, however, not always easy to interpret. In\nsome cases the relationship between female education and divorce is found to be\npositive (Isiugo-Abanihe 1998). Under other circumstances its influence appears to be\nnon-linear, with the lowest divorce rates observed among uneducated women and\namong the highest educational groups (Brandon 1990; Tilson and Larsen 2000, Takyi\nIn this study, a distinction will be made between women who had at least three\nyears of education and those with less or no education at all. Three years of education is\nthe median value for the sample distribution. The effects of more precise\ncategorizations for educational attainment were tested but the results were similar.\nReligion\nWith regard to Africa, scholars often associate Christianity with an ideational change\nincreasing women's autonomy. Most often this is suggested in connection with elevated\nlevels of education through the establishment of missionary schools (Lesthaeghe et al.\n1989). It remains nonetheless questionable to what extent the conversion to Christianity\n(or Islam) had an emancipating effect on women's position and to what extent these\nimported religions introduced values that accentuate the subordinate position of women\nin the household or society. Though there may be other examples, the promotion of the\npatriarchal (and sometimes also nuclear) family was one of the important vocations of\nthe early Christian (and Islamic) missionaries. In matrilineal populations this obviously\nA review of the empirical results on the association between religious practice and\nmarital instability reveals some inconsistencies. Most often, Muslim unions are found to\nidentifies the opposite pattern in Nigeria. In a discussion of declining divorces rates\namong Muslims in Southeast Asia, Jones (1997) maintains that declining divorce rates\nwere accompanied, and possibly also caused, by trends in more rigorous religious\npractices.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 183\nIt is thus difficult to make generalizations of the impact of various religions in\ndifferent contexts, and in places where significant effects are found it is not always\nclear whether they are positively associated to either women's empowerment, a greater\nmoral or normative restraint, or even the suppression of women's rights. In the analyses\nthat follow, a distinction is made between Christians, Muslims, and a residual category\nthat contains both traditional African religions and Africanized Christian churches. The\nlatter separated from the mainstream churches and have a more relaxed attitude to local\npractices such as polygyny.\n3.2. Couple characteristics\nResidence after marriage and the co-residence of spouses\nPost-marital residence patterns may be important covariates of marriage stability. On\nthe one hand, there is the issue of living patrilocally or matrilocally. The distinction\nmade in the MDICP surveys is virilocal versus uxorilocal and neolocal residence.\nAnother aspect of residence is whether or not the husband usually co-resides with his\nwife.\nIn populations with matrilineal descent systems, matrilocal residence after\nmarriage is often the prescription (Note 5). These unions are thought to be inherently\nunstable because the husband is separated from the base of his authority in his own\nvillage. In the village of his wife, he is subordinate to her kin group. In practice, men\nare sometimes capable of bending these prescriptions to their advantage. In the past,\nmarrying a slave was one of the options. Nowadays he could resort to cross-cousin\nmarriage, a marriage within the same village or neighborhood, or simply renegotiate the\nresidence pattern after a couple of years of marriage (Phiri 1983). In the analyses that\nfollow, a distinction is made between couples that initially lived virilocally after\nmarrying and those that did not. The majority of the latter lived uxorilocally. No\ninformation is available on whether the couple moved during their marriage.\nCo-residence (Note 6) measures a related though different aspect of marriage\ndynamics that could be related to marriage stability (Locoh and Thiriat 1995). The\nabsence of co-residence of the spouses can have different causes. If the household is\nestablished in the wife's village, the husband may decide to spend some time in his own\nvillage. In case the husband is polygynous and the different spouses do not live\ntogether, he will divide his time between the different households (Note 7). Internal and\ninternational labor migration may also contribute to the absence of co-residence, but the\nMDICP data do not contain information on the migration experience of previous\nhusbands.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n184 http://www.demographic-research.org\nEthnic endogamy\nIn rural areas, ethnic endogamy is reported to have a positive effect on marriage\nstability (Locoh and Thiriat 1995). The presumed logic is that ethnic endogamous\nmarriages are more securely embedded in existing social relations and normative\nprescriptions, and therefore less likely to dissolve.\nAge at (1st) marriage and the age difference between spouses\nAlthough age at marriage is complicated by the same measurement issues as marriage\nperiod, it is introduced in the later stages of the analysis as an additional control\nvariable. Higher ages at marriage are typically thought of as an indicator of female\nautonomy or female empowerment. In a review of the evidence from Islamic Southeast\nAsia, Jones (1997) explicitly links increasing ages at marriage to a greater degree of\nself-arrangement of marriages, and that is considered a powerful mechanism of\ndeclining divorce rates.\nAge at marriage is often found to have a considerable positive effect on marriage\nstability, both in a Western context (Murphy 1985, Martin and Bumpass 1989) and in\nAfrican populations (Locoh and Thiriat 1995). Isiugo-Abanihe (1988) did not find a\nsignificant effect. I will test for a non-linear effect of age at marriage, because it can be\nassumed that the positive effect of age at marriage on marriage stability decreases with\nan increasing age at marriage.\nJust as a young age at marriage, a greater age difference between spouses is\nsometimes considered characteristic of a subordinate position of women within the\nhousehold. A distinction will be made between couples where the husband is at least\nseven years older and the others.\nPolygyny\nIn a study in Nigeria, the highest divorce rates were found in monogamous marriages\nand in polygynous unions with three wives or more. Unions where two women share\nInstead of classifying unions in terms of the number of co-wives or the rank order of the\nwife, two dummy variables are used. The first identifies women who marry into\nhouseholds where at least one other wife is present at the time of marriage. The other\nvariable indicates whether or not the husband married an additional wife during their\nmarriage.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 185\nChildlessness\nBecause of the value attached to children, barrenness is often considered an important\ncause of marriage instability in many African populations (e.g., Van de Walle 1968,\ndoubt that childlessness may exert considerable pressure on unions, the importance of\nsterility or subfecundity as an explanatory factor for high levels of divorce or\ndifferentials in divorce rates is much more uncertain. Usually it is accepted that around\n3 percent of couples are sterile from the beginning of the reproductive period and\nremain childless (Bongaarts and Potter 1983). Though regional variations in sterility or\nsubfecundity may be substantial because of differences in the prevalence of venereal\ndiseases and female circumcision (Larsen 1989), the MDICP data do not suggest such a\npattern in the study areas under consideration: of all women aged 35-44, only 1.3\npercent never had a child and the differences between the three districts were minimal.\nIt must be remarked that these figures are rather low. In any case, primary female\nsterility does not seem to be an important issue for the present analysis. Subfecundity\nmay be of greater relevance, but that, in part, is also a factor of other variables that will\nbe included in the analysis: polygyny and co-residence of the spouses (Note 8).\nMore problematic is the virtual impossibility of separating the effect of sterility or\nsubfecundity from other associations between childlessness and marital instability. One\nof the factors that attenuate the risk of divorce once a union is blessed with children is\nthat, in case of a divorce, women may lose custody over their children. This involves\nnot only the rupture of emotional ties but possibly also a source of support at older age.\nIn these circumstances (which may characterize populations with patrilineal descent\nsystems to a greater extent), the stabilizing mechanism is not fecundity but the added\nbenefit of children to the wife if the marriage remains intact. Methodologically, the\nentanglement of both effects is not such an issue because they operate in the same\ndirection and can properly be dealt with in proportional hazards models. Of greater\nconcern is the possible reversal of the causal order if marital instability contributes to\ndeferring, or even prevents, childbearing (Murphy 1985). Under these circumstances,\nwe should be cautious in interpreting the parameter estimates of models that incorporate\nchildlessness as an independent variable.\nUsing the MDICP data, it is possible to distinguish fertile from childless unions. A\nhandicap, however, is that it is impossible to estimate the birth interval between\nmarriage and first birth. We thus cannot incorporate it as a time-dependent covariate.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n186 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3.3. Omitted variables and effects\nA flaw in the analyses presented here is the absence of a good economic indicator of the\nwealth of the household and sources of income of both partners during their marriage.\nAs mentioned before, the information on marital histories is collected through\nretrospective questions. No retrospective information was obtained for economic\nindicators that could be useful in the present analyses. As more rounds of the MDICP\nwill be completed, these measures will become available for inclusion in a longitudinal\nanalysis of divorce (Note 9).\nEthnicity was omitted because it is a quasi-linear combination of other variables\ndiscussed so far (e.g., district, religion, residence after marriage).\nIn research on marital instability in the United States, pre-marital conceptions are\noften found to contribute to marital instability (Morgan and Rindfuss 1985, Billy and\nLandsdale 1986). An analogous hypothesis would be more problematic in an African\ncontext because pre-marital conceptions could as well increase a woman's desirability\nsince they serve as a proof of her fecundability. In other circumstances a conception\nmay become an important criterion to formalize the union. It is therefore not surprising\nthat empirical results are not always clearly interpretable (e.g., Brandon 1990). The\nMDICP survey does not offer a good measure of pre-marital conceptions. The effect of\nan indicator that measures whether the first sexual partner was the one the respondent\neventually married was tested, but it did not have a significant effect.\nAlthough extra marital affairs, just as other behavioral characteristics such as\nalcohol abuse may be the direct causes for divorce (Note 10), they have been omitted\nfrom the present analysis because the information is either not available, or, because the\nreliability of this information is questionable.\n4. Results\n4.1. The distribution of individual and couple characteristics by district and\nmarriage order\nTable 1 summarizes the distribution of most variables discussed so far by district and\nmarriage order (Note 11). Divorce is most common in Balaka (first two rows). Since\nthese figures reflect current marital status, they are influenced by the frequency and\nspeed of remarriage. Note that the figures for Balaka are much higher than those\nreported for the country as a whole (see Figure 1). The level of divorce in Rumphi and\nMchinji is close to the national average.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 187\nRumphi is clearly the district with the highest educational levels. Although the\nnorth is often considered less developed, the establishment of an educational system\nwith more extensive coverage is presumably the legacy of Protestant missionary\nsettlement in colonial times. Catholic missionaries in the center of the country have put\nless of an effort into the development of an educational system (Zulu 1996). For\npolitical and ideological reasons, far fewer missionary schools were established in\npredominantly Muslim areas (Bone 2000). The imbalance in the educational\ninfrastructure is still not rectified; the low levels of educational attainment in the south\n(Balaka) testify to that. The somewhat higher mean age at marriage in Rumphi is\nrelated to these higher levels of schooling. In a simple linear regression model, women\nwith at least three years of education are on average nine months older when they marry\nthan those with less or no schooling.\nTable 1 also suggests an association between polygyny and kinship system. In the\nnorth (Rumphi) where residence after marriage is often virilocal, polygynous unions are\nmore common, and the reverse is true for Balaka (Note 12). Even though this\nrelationship is statistically significant, it is less deterministic than one might expect:\nwhere residence after marriage is virilocal, 33 percent of the women are married into a\npolygynous household; where residence is uxorilocal, 27 percent of the first marriages\nof women are with a polygynous husband (Phi = .1, p<.02).\nThe co-residence of spouses does not vary much by district, but it is striking that\n20 percent of the married women report that their husband is usually absent. In Rumphi,\nthe age difference between the spouses is significantly higher than in the other two\ndistricts. This is in part accounted for by a higher frequency of polygynous unions in\nthe north. Mchinji stands out as the district with the highest frequency of ethnic\nheterogeneous marriages.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n188 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Individual and couple characteristics by district and marriage order\nBalaka\nMchinji\nRumphi\n% currently divorced by age group\nReligion\nCoresidence of the spouses (in %)\nResidence after marriage (% living virilocally)\nPolygynous husband (in %)\nAge difference between spouses > 6 years (in %)\nEthnic homogeneous marriage (in %)\nNotes:\n* Excluding Africanized Christian churches.

More interesting is that\na greater percentage of women marry a polygynous husband as their second spouse and\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 189\na lower percentage of women live virilocally in their second marriage. If both polygyny\nand virilocal residence are disadvantageous to female empowerment, these trends\nappear contradictory. One possible explanation is that there exist two groups of women\nwith diverging marriage trajectories: on the one hand a group of women that improve\ntheir position from one marriage to the next in the sense that they less often live\npatrilocally and on the other hand a group of women who have to settle more often for a\npolygamous husband. The first of these confirms the suggestion of Locoh and Thiriat\n(1995) that women use divorce and remarriage as empowering strategies throughout\ntheir lifecourse, the latter contradicts that same hypothesis. This issue will be taken up\nagain later in this paper.\n4.2. First marriages: life table analysis\nBefore elaborating on the net effects of the potential determinants of divorce, it is worth\nlooking at the cumulative divorce probabilities in the three districts (Figure 3). The\noverall levels of divorce are not only high, but the discrepancy between the different\nareas is striking. In Balaka, close to one-third of first marriages do not survive their fifth\nanniversary. After 25 years, almost 65 percent of the first marriages have been\ndissolved. The comparable figures for Rumphi are 14 and 40 percent. Though still\nuncontrolled for other factors, these differences are highly statistically significant. In\nevaluating this figure, we must keep in mind that these data only apply to rural areas. In\naddition, we have good reasons to believe that the divorce probabilities in the MDICP\ndata are underestimates of their real values because of the sample design. As mentioned\nbefore, this bias may be higher for Mchinji and Rumphi than for Balaka, and that may\nattenuate the observed regional differences somewhat.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n190 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 2: Life table divorce probabilities for first marriages by marriage duration\nTo get a clearer picture of the exceptionally high figures in the MDICP sample, a\ncomparison with similar data for other countries might be in order. For the three\ndistricts combined, 45 percent of the marriages end in divorce within 20 years. In\nEthiopia, a country where the divorce rate is considered to be high, 40 percent of the\nmarriages do not last for longer than 20 years (Tilson and Larsen 2000). Similar -\nthough older- data for three West African countries are considerably lower: 32 percent\nin Cote d'Ivoire, 33 percent in Ghana, and 14 percent in Nigeria (Brandon 1990). In\ncontrast to the Malawian data, these are national level data that also represent urban\nareas. All the figures cited here neutralize the possible confounding effect of\nwidowhood.\nOne of the objectives of the analysis that follows is to determine whether the\ndifferences between the three districts persist once we have controlled for individual\nand couple characteristics.\n4.3. First marriages: multivariate analysis\nThe variables discussed earlier have been used to fit four Cox regression models with\nthe likelihood of divorce as the outcome variable. In the presence of censoring (due to\nmarriage duration (in years)\ncumulative divorce\nprobability (1-lx)\nBalaka Mchinji Rumphi\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 191\nthe mortality of the husband and the timing of the interview), life table techniques are\nwell suited to calculate divorce probabilities by duration of marriage and one or two\nclassificatory characteristics. Proportional hazard models are more appropriate to\nhighlight potential differences in the risk of divorce by a wider number of explanatory\nvariables. The hazard of divorce for an individual at time t is a function of a baseline\nhazard function that is left unspecified, and a linear function of a set of fixed covariates\nthat are exponentiated (Allison 1995). Table 2 summarizes the hazard ratios for the\ndifferent models. The hazard ratios ( e ) can be interpreted as the ratio of the estimated\nhazard for those with value 1 to the reference category. For quantitative covariates, we\nsubtract 1 from the hazard ratio and multiply by 100 to obtain the estimated percent\nchange in the hazard rate for each one-unit increase in the covariate (Allison 1995).\nIn model 1, only contextual (district) and individual variables are considered. As\ncan be seen from the R2 value, its explanatory power is relatively small. Model 2\nacknowledges the effect of couple characteristics and has significantly more potential in\nclarifying determinants of divorce. Models 3 and 4 add age at marriage and the\nchildlessness of the union as two additional explanatory variables. Models with\ninteractions between marriage duration, district, and the polygyny variables were tested\nbut turned out not significant.\nControlling only for individual characteristics, the hazard of divorce is almost\ntwice as high in Balaka as in Rumphi. Additional controls for couple or marriage\ncharacteristics reduces the effect of district but it remains significant. It is particularly\nthe difference between Balaka and Rumphi that accounts for that, but the difference\nbetween Balaka and Mchinji is also statistically significant (p<.01).\nIn model 2, an increase of one year in the year of birth increases the likelihood of\ndivorce by 1.5 percent. Even though this effect is substantial and suggests that divorce\nhas increased over time (Note 13), the source of this effect may be caused by the\nomission of early unsuccessful marriages by older women. A similar distortion has been\nreported by Brandon (1990). For that reason, the result obtained here is not a sound\nbasis for rejecting Kaler's (2001) suggestion that there has been little, if not no, increase\nin the frequency of divorce over time. These results do not offer a confirmation of such\na thesis either.\nEducation does not seem to have an effect on divorce hazards. In interpreting these\nresults, we should remember that the variance in educational attainment in the sample\nsites is limited and highly correlated with district (see also Table 1). We thus have little\nleverage to observe significant results even if they existed.\nWhen compared to African and Africanized religions, Christianity reduces the\nlikelihood of divorce. The effect of being Muslim tends to operate in the same direction,\nbut is less consistent.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n192 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Hazard ratios for Cox regression models of 1st marriage dissolution\u00b0\nDistrict\nRumphi - - - -\nIndividual characteristics\nFemale education\n<= 3 years - - - -\nReligion\nOther (traditional) - - - -\nMarriage and couple characteristics\nResidence of the household\nVirilocal - - -\nUsual place of stay of the husband\nSomewhere else - - -\nAge difference between spouses\n<= 6 years - - -\nEthnic homogeneous marriage\nNo - - -\nCo-wives present at marriage\nNo - - -\nHusband married additional wives\nNo - - -\nChildren in union\nNo -\nNotes:\n*** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1.

If anything, it will bias parameters\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 193\nBecause of their proximity to marriage stability, couple characteristics yield more\nclearly identifiable effects. In line with the structural anthropological argument,\nvirilocal residence after marriage is associated with more stable marriages. The co-\nresidence of the spouses is, however, a much stronger covariate than the location of the\nhousehold. The risk of divorce for marriages where partners co-reside is only one-third\nof what it is when the husband is usually absent. This is by far the strongest effect of\nany of the variables in model 2. This is not surprising since co-residence by itself may\nalready be an indicator of marriage instability. On the other hand, the absence of the\nhusband may give rise to suspicion about his whereabouts and fidelity or complaints\nabout his contributions to the household's income. If the absence of co-residence is\nrelated to migration, then this also suggests that the frailty of unions is dependent on the\neconomic circumstances of the household and on migration as a coping strategy thereof.\nMost of the interpretations of this effect are necessarily speculative because no precise\ninformation about the reasons for the absence of co-residence is available.\nA large age difference between spouses significantly reduces the risk of divorce\nand may be an indication of a greater submissiveness of women to the authority of their\nhusband. Ethnically homogenous marriages are also less likely to end up in divorce.\nThe greater stability of these marriages is consistent with results from previous research\nThe polygyny indicators yield interesting results. When a woman marries into a\nhousehold where other wives are present, the risk of divorce increases. If the husband,\non the contrary, marries an additional wife during their marriage, the risk of marriage\ndissolution is attenuated. The first observation points to an often-suggested\ncharacteristic of polygynous households with competition between wives and greater\nmarriage instability. Marrying into a household where other women are present also\nimplies that the woman's position is of a lower rank (2nd at best) and that seems to\nnegatively affect stability. The reasons for the stabilizing effect of the husband\nmarrying additional wives are twofold. First, it implies that the wife is of a higher rank\nthan the incoming woman and may therefore enjoy higher status and possibly power\nwithin the household. In addition, marrying an additional wife may be considered an\nalternative to divorce. If the husband, for example, suspects his wife to be barren or if\nshe only bears him daughters, he may force her to accept an additional wife in exchange\nfor not being divorced.\nAge at marriage has only been introduced at a later stage of the analysis because of\nthe great number of missing values for that variable. In model 3, the effect of age at\nmarriage (non-linear) indicates that the risk of divorce decreases as the age at marriage\nincreases but at a decreasing rate.\nThe effect of childlessness is very strong and highly significant. Because of the\nreservations raised earlier, it is not clear whether it is worthwhile to attach a lot of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n194 http://www.demographic-research.org\nimportance to that effect. Interesting, nevertheless, is that even in the presence of this\ncontrol, the effects of the other variables remain within the same order of magnitude.\nOnly the squared age term loses statistical significance.\n4.4. Remarriage and the instability of higher-order marriages\nRemarriage is almost universal. Over 40 percent of the women remarry within 2 years\nafter a divorce; that figure increases steadily to reach 75 percent after 5 years and close\nto 90 percent after 10 years. Remarriage is significantly slower among widowed women\nand reaches a maximum of just over 70 percent. These differences are statistically\nsignificant and partly accounted for by the fact that widowed women are, on average,\nsomewhat older and therefore less likely to remarry (not shown).\nRemarriage probabilities also vary by district. This is visible in Figure 3. In\nBalaka, where divorce is more common, remarriage occurs faster. Especially when\ncontrasted with Rumphi, it is also more universal: over 90 percent as compared to 78\npercent.\nFigure 3: Remarriage by duration since marriage breakup (N=567, 43 missing\nvalues)\nduration since breakup (years)\ncumulative remarriage probability\nBalaka Mchinji Rumphi\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 195\nmarriage duration (in years)\ncumulative divorce\nprobability (1-lx)\nBalaka (2nd) Mchinji (2nd) Rumphi (2nd)\nBalaka (1st) Mchinji (1st) Rumphi (1st)\nFigure 4: Cumulative divorce probabilities for 1st and higher-order marriages by\nVia a proportional hazards model, it was tested whether the differences between\nthe regions persist after controlling for the outcome of the first marriage (divorced\nversus widowed), but they remained virtually unchanged (not shown).\nIn Figure 4, the cumulative divorce probabilities for first and second marriages are\ncompared. In all three districts, the probability of divorce in higher-order marriages is\nlower than for first marriages. The difference is a little more accentuated for Rumphi\nthan for the other two districts. This finding contradicts observations for the United\nStates where the divorce rate is higher for second than for first marriages (Martin and\nA proportional hazards model with the outcome of second marriages was tested\nwith the same independent variables as in Model 2 for first marriages. A general\ntendency in the results was a reduction in the effects of most variables. With the\nexception of the co-residence of the spouses, none of the independent variables had a\nstatistically significant effect. Just as for first marriages, co-residence reduces the risks\nof divorce considerably.\nNoteworthy perhaps is the reversal of the effect for women who marry into a\nhousehold where another wife is already present. For first marriages this tended to\nincrease the hazard of divorce significantly; in second or higher-order marriages it\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n196 http://www.demographic-research.org\nseems to have a stabilizing effect. Because the relatively high standard error of that\nestimate, we cannot be sure whether the reversal is reflecting a true pattern. In addition\nto the variables mentioned previously, the effect of the outcome of the first marriage\n(ended in divorce or through widowhood) was tested. While higher- order marriages of\npreviously divorced women seem to be less stable, its effect was again not statistically\nsignificant. Our inability to identify significant effects may indicate that this analysis\nlacks statistical power (Note 14).\n4.5. Divorce and remarriage as empowering strategies\nSo far the analyses have highlighted some of the correlates of divorce, but they have\nhardly clarified the place of marriage and divorce in the life course of women. A focus\non the latter is essential for understanding the possible role of marriage and divorce as\nan empowering strategy in women's lives in the sense that it was advanced by Locoh\nand Thiriat (1995). Here, I consider the residence of the household after marriage as an\nempowering factor. It is assumed that patrilocal (or virilocal) residence is\ndisadvantageous to women because it implies that they come under the direct control of\ntheir husband and his kin. If residence after marriage is matri- or uxorilocal, women's\nposition is more securely embedded in the social relationships with her own kin and\ntherefore likely to be to her advantage. Such an interpretation is subject to the critique\nof reading too much significance into the residence of the household and therefore it\nshould only be considered as an initial attempt at gaining an understanding of divorce\nand remarriage as strategic choices that women deploy throughout their lives. In a very\nanalogous manner, the discussion that follows assumes that women, on average, prefer\na monogamous over a polygynous husband.\nThe analysis consists of two steps. First, a simple comparison of first and second\nmarriages is made in terms of marriage type (polygynous/monogamous) and residence\npattern (table 3). This is comparable to the figures presented in table 1, but to avoid\npossible selection effects, the sample is now restricted to women who married at least\ntwice. Table 3 confirms the bifurcation of marriage outcomes for women. On the one\nhand, women more often marry a polygynous husband in higher order marriages (from\n29 to 48%). At the same time, they more often succeed to avoid living virilocally in\nhigher order marriages (from 52 to 59%). The latter is possibly related to the fact\nspouses in a polygynous household do not always co-reside. The row percentages in\ntable 3 indicate that this can only be part of the explanation because the proportion of\nwomen living uxorilocally increases for all women, whether their husband is\npolygynous or not.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 197\nTable 3: Women's residence after marriage, by marriage type\n(polygynous/monogamous) and marriage order (observed row % and\nmarginal distributions)*\n1st marriage 2nd marriage\nUxorilocal\n(or neolocal) Virilocal Total\nUxorilocal\n(or neolocal) Virilocal Total\nNote.\n* The sample is restricted to women who married at least twice.

N=533 (21 missing values). GEE (generalized estimating equations)\nwas chosen to adjust the standard errors for the dependence among observations (Allison 1999). LR Chi-square: 284.9, df: 12,\np<.01. The effects of marriage order and the interaction between marriage type and district are significant at the 5%-level.\nThe relationship between residence after marriage and marriage type is further explored\nin a second step that includes additional controls for the co-residence of the spouses and\ndistrict. This is done via a logistic regression model that predicts uxorilocal residence\nafter marriage (table 4). The analysis essentially confirms that uxurilocal residence after\nmarriage is more common in higher order than in first marriages. The interaction\nbetween marriage type and district further illustrates that uxorilocal residence is more\ncommon in Balaka and that the co-residence of the spouses is a good predictor of\nvirilocal residence in Rumphi, and particularly so if the husband is polygamous. The\ninteraction between marriage order and marriage type is not significant, meaning that\nthe effect of marriage order on residence after marriage is similar across marriage types.\nSo in terms of the Locoh-Thiriat hypothesis that divorce is used by women as a\nstrategy to improve their position throughout their life course, we only get a partial\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n198 http://www.demographic-research.org\nconfirmation. On the one hand, women's `value' on the marriage market seems to\ndecrease and a greater proportion is remarrying a polygamous husband. On the other\nhand, those women who manage to remarry monogamously seem to escape to a greater\nextent the control of their in-laws. Herein we find some evidence for the Locoh-Thiriat\nhypothesis.\n5. Conclusion\nMarriage in Malawi is a fragile institution. Especially in Balaka, the divorce\nprobabilities must be among the highest recorded on the continent. The anthropological\nargument that divorce is more common in populations with matrilineal descent systems\nonly partly accounts for the observed differences between the three districts. Elevated to\na higher level of abstraction, this observation nonetheless offers support for the idea that\nmarriage instability is positively correlated with female empowerment. The effect of the\nage difference between spouses operates in the same direction. Less strong evidence\ncould be found for the hypothesis that female empowerment stabilizes the marital bond.\nThe few indications pointing in that direction are that women who marry older are less\nlikely to divorce, and the observation that monogamous marriages are more stable. The\neffect of the polygyny variables, however, highlights more intricate relationships that\nreflect both the position of the woman vis-\u00e0-vis her co-wives and the relationship with\nher husband. Although not directly measured, we also find indications that point to the\nrole of labor migration in marriage instability.\nThe role of marriage, divorce, and remarriage in the life course of women is also\nfascinating and deserves greater attention than could be given here. For now, it appears\nthat women more often marry a polygynous husband in higher-order compared to first\nmarriages. To the extent that this is undesirable, it indicates that divorced women lose\nvalue on the marriage market. At the same time, women more often live uxorilocally in\nhigher-order marriages. This is true for both women who remarry a monogamous or a\npolygamous husband, but in the latter case (particularly in Rumphi) it often means that\nthe spouses do not co-reside. Together, these observations suggest the existence of\ndiverging patterns between a group of women who gain through divorce and remarriage\nand a group of women who seem having to settle for less in higher-order marriages.\nIf thinking in terms of power and empowerment, the perspective that considers\nmarriage and divorce as active strategies deployed throughout the life course as part of\na negotiating process for power is an important addition to the static view that\nappreciates power solely as an outcome or determinant of marital stability. In an\nanalogous manner, marriage and divorce can become tools at the disposal of individuals\nfor managing risk or insecurity. Risk to the exposure of HIV/AIDS is one such issue.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 6\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 199\nDivorce may offer protection against HIV if the spouse is suspected of having extra-\nmarital affairs; (re)marriage potentially has the same effect because it is likely to reduce\nthe frequency of casual relationships. The expansion of the HIV/AIDS pandemic could\nthus become a contributing factor for seemingly growing divorce rates in Malawi and/or\nthe persistence of the differences between the three districts studied here. Such\nconclusions, however, require great interpretative leaps and necessarily remain\nspeculative.\n6. "
