    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper compares the effects of obesity, overweight, smoking,\nand problem drinking on health care use and health status based on national\nsurvey data. Obesity has roughly the same association with chronic health\nconditions as does twenty years' aging; this greatly exceeds the associations of\nsmoking or problem drinking. Utilization effects mirrors the health effects.\nObesity is associated with a 36 percent increase in inpatient and outpatient\nspending and a 77 percent increase in medications, compared with a 21\npercent increase in inpatient and outpatient spending and a 28 percent in-\ncrease in medications for current smokers and smaller effects for problem\ndrinkers. Nevertheless, the latter two groups have received more consistent\nattention in recent decades in clinical practice and public health policy.\nMany behavioral risk factors, chief among them\nsmoking, heavy drinking, and obesity, are known causes of\nchronic health conditions. Chronic health conditions, like\ncancer, diabetes, or heart disease, in turn are primary drivers of\nhealth care spending, disability, and death. This paper compares the\nassociations of smoking, problem drinking, and obesity with health\ncare use and chronic conditions. All three risk factors are prevalent,\nalthough only obesity has dramatically increased over the past\ntwenty-five years. There is an extensive literature of the association\nof individual risk factors with selected clinical problems. Overall\nassessments are rare, however, and no direct comparisons of obesity\nand other risk factors have been reported.

The stan-\ndard categories are underweight (BMI less than 18.5), normal\ning to these criteria, about one in three Americans are overweight\nbut not obese, and an additional one in five are obese.1 The primary\ndrawback of the BMI is that it cannot distinguish fat mass from lean\nmass and therefore misclassifies some persons. Other methods occa-\nsionally used in epidemiologic studies are waist circumference,\nwaist-to-hip ratio, and skin-fold thickness.\nA higher BMI, beginning in the upper range of the normal weight\ncategory, is associated with increased mortality and increased risk\nfor coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus, hyper-\ntension, and certain types of cancer.2 Even modest weight reduc-\ntions can have substantial lifetime health benefits.3 In the United\nStates there was only a minor increase in overweight (including\nmatically since then. Moreover, this recent increase was concen-\ngrew 60 percent.4 Other industrialized countries, in particular Brit-\nain and Germany, have experienced similar growth rates in obesity\nbut started from lower levels.5\nThe debate continues about whether obesity should be consid-\nered a disease in its own right. Recognition of obesity as a disease or\ndisability could lead to changes in tax treatment for weight mainte-\nnance programs, insurance coverage, and other legal rights. Advo-\ncacy groups such as the American Obesity Association strongly sup-\nport this goal, which was pioneered successfully by mental health\nadvocates and played an important role in mental health parity leg-\nislation. The disease paradigm also has been promoted, although\nless successfully, for alcohol and drug abuse. Others warn that ap-\nplying the disease paradigm to obesity could be interpreted as self-\nserving advocacy without a sound scientific basis.6\nData And Methods\nI Data source. This DataWatch uses data from Healthcare for\nCommunities (HCC), a national household telephone survey fielded\npated in the Community Tracking Study.7 The results shown here\nare based on adults ages eighteen to sixty-five. The main explana-\ntory variables are overweight, smoking, problem drinking, and ag-\ning. The weight indicators are overweight (BMI, 25\u00ad29.9) and obese\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 2\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

According to the HCC survey, 36 percent\nof the population in 1998 was overweight but not obese, and 23\npercent was obese. There is a tendency toward underreporting of\nweight and overreporting of height; these numbers are therefore\nalmost identical to the earlier third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), which measured height and\nweight objectively. Both surveys give slightly higher estimates than\nthe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) fielded at\nthe same time as the HCC survey, which also uses self-reporting.9\nI Dependent variables. The main dependent variables are two\nmeasures of health status and two measures of health care use. The\nfirst health measure is a count of seventeen common chronic health\nconditions.10 The second evaluates health-related quality of life by\nthe physical health scale on the SF-12 (PCS12), a shorter version of\nThe first measure of service use is spending on inpatient and\nambulatory care, based on the number of reported hospital stays and\nambulatory visits and multiplied by unit costs from the Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The overall HCC numbers are\nvery similar to MEPS estimates. For example, average inpatient and\n$1,377 in MEPS.12 The second measure is medication use based on\nsurvey questions about regularly used medication, mapped to insur-\nance claims (for prescription drugs) or wholesale prices (others) to\nobtain spending estimates.13 The usual limitations of this approach\napply, especially the underreporting in self-reports and incomplete\nassessment of services. Even after scope of coverage is adjusted for,\nMEPS estimates are lower than estimates from the National Health\nAccounts. Relative effects may be less biased than absolute numbers\nare, and I therefore show percentage changes based on the ratio of\npredicted costs for the population with and without the risk factor.\nStudy Results\nI Health effects.

The effects of smoking\nor problem drinking are similar to those of being overweight (not\nstatistically different from each other, although significantly differ-\nent from 0 at p < .05, except past smoking, p = .10). The same overall\npicture appears for physical health\u00adrelated quality of life, although\nhere the effects of obesity are similar to thirty, not just twenty, years'\naging. Being overweight is again similar to problem drinking and\nbetween current and past smoking, with no statistical differences\nbetween these four risk factors.\nI Cost effects. In terms of absolute changes in costs for in-\npatient and ambulatory care (which probably understate true abso-\nlute effects because of underreporting), obesity is associated with an\naverage increase of $395 per year, overweight with an increase of\n$125, current or ever smoking about $230, problem drinking with\n$150, and aging with $225. Only the effects of problem drinking and\nbeing overweight are not statistically significant.\nIn relative terms, the point estimates suggest that obesity in-\ncreases health care costs 36 percent and medications costs 77 per-\ncent, compared with being in a normal weight range; twenty years'\naging increases service costs 20 percent and medications costs 105\npercent; current or past smoking increases service costs 21 percent\nand medications costs 28\u00ad30 percent (Exhibit 2). Cost effects are\nless precisely estimated than are health effects because of the\nskewness of utilization. The cost effects of obesity on medication\nare significantly larger than the effects of daily smoking or problem\ndrinking, but most other 95 percent confidence intervals overlap\nIncrease in number of\nchronic conditions\nDecline in health-\nrelated quality of life\nEffect Of Obesity, Aging, Smoking, And Drinking On Chronic Medical Conditions\nAnd Health-Related Quality Of Life, 1998\nSOURCES: Author's calculation based on data from the Healthcare for Communities (HCC) survey, wave 1.\na Twenty years' aging is from age thirty to age fifty.\nObese\nSmoking (current)\nOverweight\nProblem drinking\nSmoking (past)\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 2\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The statistical asso-\nciations with specific health problems are consistent with known\nbiomedical relationships and suggest an explanation for the cost\neffects. Obesity is significantly associated with an odds ratio larger\nthan 1 for every condition in Exhibit 3; aging is significantly associ-\nated with every condition except asthma; and daily smoking is sig-\nnificantly associated with lung disease and cancer (all at p < .05,\nmost at p < .01). Obesity and aging have significantly larger effects on\nheart disease, hypertension, and diabetes (common conditions\ntreated with long-term drug regimens) than smoking or problem\ndrinking has (p < .05). In contrast, smoking has the strongest effects\non cancer and lung disease (in the case of lung disease, the effect is\nsignificantly larger than the effect of obesity at p < .01). Although\ncancer and lung disease can be costly, they are relatively rare and\nlead to death more quickly than diabetes or hypertension do.\nDiscussion\nObesity appears to have a stronger association with the occurrence\nof chronic medical conditions, reduced health-related quality of life,\nand increased health care and medication spending than smoking or\nproblem drinking has. Only twenty years' aging has similar-size\neffects. Moreover, a larger proportion of the population is obese than\nare heavy drinkers, as identified by AUDIT (6 percent), or daily\nsmokers (19 percent), based on this survey. Finally, even though the\neffects of overweight are small, they apply to a large population\nServices Medication\nCost Increases Associated With Obesity, Aging, Smoking, And Drinking, 1998\nSOURCES: Author's calculation based on data from the Healthcare for Communities (HCC) survey, wave 1.\na Twenty years' aging is from age thirty to age fifty.\nPercent change\nObese\nSmoking (current)\nOverweight\nProblem drinking\nSmoking (past)\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 2 0 0 2\nH E A L T H R I S K S & C O S T S\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

There are no similar comparisons\nacross these health risks, but the estimated cost effects of obesity are\nconsistent with recent studies of HMO patients.14 The absence of a\nsignificant effect from problem drinking may seem surprising, since\nmany believe that alcohol abuse has a large effect on health care\ncosts, but it is also consistent with recent evidence.15 Important\noutcomes exist outside the scope of this analysis that could provide\na different ranking. Smoking may still account for more premature\ndeaths, and alcohol abuse is likely to account for farther-reaching\neffects (such as drunk-driving accidents).\nA causal (rather than descriptive) interpretation of the results\nshown here assumes that risk behavior precedes health and spend-\ning impacts. Reverse causality (for example, diabetes or hyperten-\nsion causing obesity) could invalidate this interpretation, as could\nother factors causing health-risk behavior and high medical spend-\ning that are not captured by race, education, or family income. Sed-\nentary lifestyle is an unmeasured variable highly correlated with\nobesity, although it can have independent health effects. It is diffi-\ncult to disentangle these two factors and may not be particularly\nrelevant because virtually all interventions targeting obesity simul-\ntaneously target sedentary lifestyle.\nI Income inequality hypothesis.

A prime candidate, the income\ninequality hypothesis, posits that economically more egalitarian\ncommunities have better health outcomes than more unequal com-\nmunities have. This hypothesis has influenced a wide range of\nauthoritative reports, and its prominent proponents argue that in-\ncome inequality is a stronger determinant of health than is individ-\nual income.16 However, more recent studies cast doubt on the\nstrength of the inequality effect. Income inequality across U.S. states\nor communities is not associated with the prevalence of any of the\nchronic conditions studied here, either, even though the same\nchronic conditions are highly correlated with individual income or\nI Weight control as a national priority. Is it likely that making\nweight control a higher national priority would lead to weight loss\nand improved health? Achieving lasting health behavioral change is\ndifficult and rarely achieved by exhorting individuals to exercise\nmore, eat healthier foods, stop smoking, or drink responsibly. Car-\nfriendly (and bike/pedestrian-hostile) urban developments; desk\njobs; television; and relatively cheap, calorie-dense foods are some of\nthe recent environmental changes that have changed relative prices\nin favor of less physical activity without a corresponding decreased\ncaloric intake. In contrast, taxation and access control on tobacco\n(indoor smoking bans) and alcohol products are environmental in-\nterventions (or relative price changes) that have reduced smoking\nrates and some alcohol problems.\nAs with smoking and problem drinking, a time lag\nintervenes between obesity and the development of chronic\nhealth problems. The largest declines in smoking rates hap-\nsity has occurred since 1980. The full long-run consequences of in-\ncreased obesity rates at the aggregate level are probably not yet\nvisible.\nFinancial support was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which\nfundedHealthcarefor Communities.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 2 0 0 2\nH E A L T H R I S K S & C O S T S\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
