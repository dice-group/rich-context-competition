Since people do not consume\nindividual foods or single nutrients in real\nlife, the dietary pattern should be taken into\nconsideration as it reflects the complexity of\ndietary intake, where foods have interactive,\nsynergistic and antagonistic effects.10 It has\nbeen suggested that dietary pattern may be\nmore predictive of disease risks than specific\nfood- and nutrient-based approaches.10\nAdherence to the Mediterranean dietary\npattern (characterized by high consumption\nof plant foods [vegetables, fruits, legumes\nand cereals], high intake of olive oil, mod-\nerate intake of fish, low-to-moderate intake\nof dairy products and low intake of satu-\nrated fats and meat11) is associated with\nslower cognitive decline12 and reduced\nAlzheimer's disease risk.13 Although the\nJapanese dietary pattern differs widely\nfrom the Mediterranean diet, a diet char-\nacterized by high intake of soybeans,\nvegetables, algae, dairy products and low\nintake of rice was associated with reduced\nrisk of dementia in the general population of\nelderly Japanese individuals.14 Taken\ntogether, these data suggest that dietary\npattern could contribute to the risk of\ncognitive decline and/or Alzheimer's\ndisease.\nPatients with T2DM have been found to\nconsume higher quantities of fruit, vege-\ntables and meat than healthy control sub-\njects,15 but the relationship between dietary\npatterns and cognitive function in patients\nwith T2DM remains largely unexplored.\nThe aim of this cross-sectional study was\nto analyse these associations using data\nfrom elderly Japanese patients with T2DM.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis ancillary study was a subanalysis of an\noriginal study that investigated the relation-\nship between olfactory function and cogni-\ntive function.16 Patients with T2DM were\nenrolled from the Diabetes Outpatient\nClinic of Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric\nMedical Centre (Tokyo, Japan) and\nJuntendo University Hospital (Tokyo,\ncriteria were patients with T2DM who were\naged >65 years and free of clinically evident\ncognitive impairment. Exclusion criteria\nwere: (i) severe infection within the preced-\ning 2 weeks; (ii) any scheduled or performed\nsurgery; (iii) severe trauma; (iv) current\npsychiatric disorders; (v) partial or complete\nolfactory dysfunction associated with sinus-\nitis, allergic rhinitis or deviated nasal\nseptum; (vi) history of brain tumour; (vii)\nMMSE (mini-mental state examination)\nscore <22 points (moderate-to-severe cog-\nnitive impairment17); (ix) patients con-\nsidered ineligible based on the assessment\nof clinical investigators.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Juntendo\nUniversity Hospital and Juntendo Tokyo\nKoto Geriatric Medical Centre, and was\nconducted in accordance with the principles\ndescribed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nEach patient provided written informed\nconsent prior to enrolment.\nMMSE\nCognitive status was evaluated using\nMMSE,18,19 and was assessed in a separate\nroom by a trained physician. The MMSE\nscale ranges between 0 and 30, with a higher\nscore indicating a better cognitive perform-\nance. Patients were divided into two groups:\nsuspected mild dementia (score 22\u00ad26), and\nAssessment of depression\nDepression was assessed in a separate room by\na trained physician (H.S.) using the BDI (Beck\nDepression inventory)-II.20 The BDI-II scale\nranges between 0 and 63, with higher scores\nindicating increasingly severe depression.\nDietary survey\nWeighed dietary records were obtained from\neach patient for three consecutive days just\nbefore a scheduled diabetes-related hospital\nappointment. The participants were also\nasked to take digital pictures of their\nmeals. A trained nutritionist (M.E.) (who\nwas blinded to participants' characteristics)\nchecked all the recorded sheets and digital\npictures, and interviewed subjects to clarify\nany ambiguous points and increase the\naccuracy of reporting. Mean values of the\nestimated individual food amounts were\nused in the analysis. Alcohol intake was\nreported as the quantities of specific types of\nalcoholic beverage. The consumption of\nfoods and nutrients was estimated by a\ncomputerized dietary analysis program\n(HealthyMaker Pro 501; Mushroom soft\nInc., Tokyo, Japan; http://www.msrsoft.\ncom/) For dietary pattern analysis, food\nitems were classified into 19 foods based on\nthe whole food catalogue of the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and\nTechnology, Japan.\nClinical parameters\nData including body mass index (BMI; kg/\nm2), smoking status (nonsmokers, former\nsmokers [no smoking in 6 months prior to\nstudy] or current smokers), and presence of\nretinopathy (simple, preproliferative or pro-\nliferative retinopathy as defined by trained\nophthalmologists), nephropathy (microal-\nbuminuria [30 mg/g creatinine]) and neur-\nopathy (two or more of: symptoms; absence\nof ankle tendon reflexes; abnormal vibration\nperception threshold using a tuning fork)\nwere obtained by patient examination.\nBlood samples were obtained after over-\nnight fast. Serum lipids (total cholesterol,\nhigh-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol,\nlow-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol,\ntriglycerides) and glucose were quantified\nusing routine analyser (LABOSPECT 008;\nHitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan),\nand HbA1c (National Glycohemoglobin\nStandardization Program; http://www.\nngsp.org/) was quantified using a high-\nperformance liquid chromatography\nTokyo, Japan)\nStatistical analyses\nNo formal sample size justification for this\nstudy was performed as it was an ancillary\nstudy of an exploratory nature. Data were\npresented as mean\u00c6 SD or median (inter-\nquartile range) for continuous variables, or\nn(%) of patients for categorical variables.\nSome parameters were logarithmically trans-\nformed to approximate normal distribution.\nFactor analysis with varimax rotation was\nused to reduce the complexity of dietary\npatterns. Factors with cumulative coefficient\nof determination >0.5 were retained. For\nsimplicity, individual metabolites with a\nfactor loading >0.4 are reported as composing\nthat factor. Factor scores for each dietary\npattern and each subject were calculated by\nsumming each dietary pattern score, weighted\nby their factor loadings. Estimated factor\nscores were categorized into tertiles. Trend\nassociation across tertiles was evaluated using\nlinear regression analysis for continuous vari-\nables or logistic regression analysis for cat-\negorical variables, in an unadjusted model\nand/or model adjusted for age and sex.\nSpearman's correlation coefficient was used\nto evaluate correlations between MMSE score\nand possible risk factors for cognitive impair-\nment (BMI, estimated duration of diabetes,\nglycaemic control, presence of diabetic com-\nplications [retinopathy, nephropathy and\nneuropathy], education, depressive status,\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, food intake,\nhypertension and hyperlipidaemia). Trend\nassociations across MMSE score and sus-\npected mild dementia tertiles were evaluated\nby linear regression analysis and logistic\nregression analysis, respectively. Regression\nmodels included statistically significant vari-\nables (P< 0.05) from the above Spearman's\ncorrelation analysis, in addition to age and\nsex. Statistical analyses were performed using\nSAS\u00d5 software version 9.3 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA), and two-sided P-\nvalues< 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\n65\u00ad83 years). Demographic and clinical char-\nacteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.\nFactor analysis with varimax rotation\nidentified five dietary patterns (Table 2): (i)\noils, nuts, seeds, sugars and eggs (high\nloadings for fats and oils, nuts, seeds,\nsugars and eggs); (ii) cereals and meats\n(high loadings for cereals, meats, seasonings,\nTable 1.

Overall,\nthese five patterns accounted for 56% of the\nvariance in food intake.\nTable 3 shows the nutrient intake for each\ndietary pattern. In the oils, nuts, seeds,\nsugars and eggs pattern, there was a signifi-\ncant trend across the tertiles for increased\nintake of carbohydrate, protein, fat, zinc,\ncopper, cholesterol, salt, saturated fatty\nacids and omega 6 fatty acids (P < 0.05 for\neach comparison). Across the tertiles in the\ncereals and meats pattern, there were sig-\nnificant trends for increased consumption of\ncarbohydrate, zinc, copper, fibre and salt\n(P < 0.05 for each comparison). In the fruits\nand potatoes pattern, there were significant\ntrends towards increased intake of carbohy-\ndrate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folic acid,\ncalcium, magnesium, zinc, copper and fibre\n(P < 0.05 for each comparison). In the vege-\ntables and fish pattern, there were signifi-\ncantly higher intakes of protein, fat, vitamin\nB6, vitamin B12, niacin, vitamin C, vitamin\nE, folic acid, potassium, calcium, magne-\nsium, zinc, copper, fibre, salt, monounsatu-\nrated fatty acids, omega 3 fatty acids and\nomega 6 fatty acids across the tertiles\n(P < 0.05 for each comparison).

In the\noils, nuts, seeds, sugars and eggs pattern,\nthere was a significant trend towards\nincreased calorie consumption and LDL\ncholesterol level (P < 0.05 for each compari-\nson). In the cereals and meats pattern, there\nwas a significant trend towards lower HDL\ncholesterol (P < 0.05). There were significant\ntrends for increased calorie consumption\nand lower prevalence of diabetic retinopathy\nin the fruits and potatoes pattern (P < 0.05\nfor each comparison). Across the tertiles in\nthe vegetables and fish pattern, there were\nsignificant trends towards increased calorie\nand alcohol consumption, higher diastolic\nblood pressure, and reduced likelihood of\nantiplatelet agent use (P < 0.05 for each\ncomparison). There was a significant trend\ntowards higher diastolic and systolic blood\npressure in the pulses pattern (P < 0.05 for\neach comparison).\nCorrelation analysis found significant\nrelationships between MMSE score and\nand alcohol consumption (r \u00bc 0.24,\nP \u00bc 0.042). Data regarding cognitive func-\ntion across the tertiles for each dietary\npattern are shown in Table 5. A higher\nconsumption of vegetables and fish was\nsignificantly associated with improved\nMMSE score (unadjusted model,\nP < 0.001; model adjusted for age and sex,\nP < 0.01; model adjusted for age, sex, edu-\ncation, diabetic nephropathy and alcohol\nconsumption, P < 0.05) and decreased\nprevalence of suspected mild dementia\n(unadjusted model, P < 0.05; model\nadjusted for age and sex, P < 0.05). There\nwere no other significant trends in cognitive\nfunction in any other dietary pattern.\nDiscussion\nThe present study identified five dietary\npatterns, of which a high score in the\nvegetables and fish pattern was associated\nwith a heightened MMSE score and a\nTable 5.

These are known\nto act as antioxidant agents, and oxidative\nstress is a substantial risk factor for age-\nrelated cognitive decline.21 The antioxidant\nrich diet in the vegetables and fish pattern\nmay account for the high MMSE score and\nlow prevalence of mild dementia in these\nsubjects. Consistent with our findings,\nothers have demonstrated an association\nbetween a high intake of vegetables and a\nIn the present study, subjects with a high\nscore in the fruits and potatoes pattern also\nconsumed a diet that was high in vitamins\nand minerals, but there was no association\nbetween this dietary pattern and cognitive\nfunction. The effect of a high intake of fruits\non the prevention of cognitive decline is\nunclear.24 A significant negative association\nhas been identified between fructose intake\nand cognitive function among middle-aged\nand elderly subjects without T2DM,25 and it\nis possible that high fructose intake may\nattenuate the beneficial effects of vitamins\nand minerals from fruits. On the other hand,\nothers have found that high fruit intake\ncorrelated with low incidence of diabetic\nretinopathy,26 suggesting that the antioxi-\ndative effect of vitamins may prevent its\nprogression. This is consistent with the\npresent finding of a low prevalence of dia-\nbetic retinopathy in the highest tertile of the\nfruits and potatoes pattern.\nStudies have found a correlation between\nhigh fish consumption and a reduced risk of\ncognitive decline,27\u00ad29 although reports are\nnot consistent.30,31 Generally, fish contains\nhigh amount of omega 3 fatty acids in\naddition to vitamins and minerals. There\nwas a positive correlation between the vege-\ntables and fish pattern and omega 3 fatty\nacids in the present study, which may be\nbeneficial for brain health via their anti-\ninflammatory, antioxidative and antithrom-\nbotic properties.32 The higher cognitive\nfunction and lower use of antiplatelet\nagents in subjects with a high vegetables\nand fish score, compared with other subjects\nin the present study, may be at least in part\ndue to their high intake of omega 3 fatty\nacids.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that\nlight-to-moderate alcohol consumption is\nassociated with high cognitive test score\nand/or risk reductions in the development\nof dementia,33\u00ad36 although other studies do\nnot support such findings.37,38 While the\nmechanisms underlying the relationship\nbetween alcohol intake and cognitive func-\ntion remain largely unknown, moderate\nalcohol intake may play a role in cardiopro-\ntection and/or neuroprotection through the\nactivation of cellular survival pathways,39\nleading to reductions in the risk of cardio-\nvascular and/or cerebrovascular dis-\neases,40,41 and, ultimately, a reduced risk of\ncognitive decline. Alcohol consumption was\nvery modest in the present study, but\ncorrelated with MMSE score. In addition,\npatients with a high vegetables and fish score\nconsumed significantly more alcohol than\nthose in the lowest tertile. Thus, the con-\nsumption of moderate amounts of alcohol\n(8 g/day) in those subjects could also be\nassociated with better cognitive function. It\nis interesting to note that the vegetables and\nfish pattern was associated with high MMSE\nscore, even after adjustment for confound-\ning factors including alcohol intake.\nThe present study has several limitations.\nFirst, the study was a subanalysis of a small\nsample size study with a cross-sectional\ndesign. Such study design may result in\nselection bias and does not allow inference\nof a causal relationship between dietary\npatterns and cognitive function. In particu-\nlar, it is possible that dietary patterns may\nhave changed as a result of altered cogni-\ntion; also, we cannot exclude the possibility\nthat dietary patterns found in this study\nwere influenced by unknown factors caused\nby a decline in cognitive function.\nFurthermore, some of the negative results\nmay be related to the underpowered sample\nsize. Another potential limitation is that we\nevaluated dietary patterns and cognitive\nfunction via self-reported questionnaires;\nthis method has been widely used in studies,\nhowever. It is also necessary to acknowledge\nthat the validity and reproducibility of diet-\nary patterns identified in this study have not\nbeen confirmed, although the methods\nemployed have been widely used. In add-\nition, we did not include a group of control\nsubjects without T2DM, and it is therefore\nimpossible to determine whether our find-\nings are general or specific to T2DM. Other\nlifestyle factors such as physical activity,\nsleep/wake pattern and metal health, were\nnot evaluated, and we cannot exclude the\npossibility that subjects with higher scores\nfor vegetables and fish may have had higher\nhealth-related literacy than other subjects.\nFinally, we could not fully consider possible\nconfounding factors associated with cogni-\ntive function.\nIn conclusion, a high score in the vege-\ntables and fish dietary pattern was asso-\nciated with high MMSE score and low\nprevalence of suspected mild dementia in\nelderly patients with T2DM.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nT.M. received research funds from MSD, Takeda\nand Eli Lilly.
