The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarc-\ntion (AMI) in a large, nationally representative sample of very old men and women.\nMethods. We utilized secondary analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging. Baseline (1984) in-person interview data were\nat baseline. Hospitalization for AMI was defined as having primary discharge diagnoses containing ICD9-CM 410 codes.\nMultivariable proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the epidemiologic risks for all persons, and separately for\nwomen, men, self-respondents, those with no previous AMIs, and those with no history of coronary heart disease.\nResults. Of the sample, 357 persons (5.9%; 172 women and 185 men) had at least one primary discharge diagnosis of AMI.\nSignificant (p < .05) risk factors for being hospitalized with an AMI (adjusted hazards ratios in parentheses) from the pooled\nanalysis were male gender (1.86), having no more than a grade school education (1.35), atherosclerosis (1.43), hypertension\ntions (1.43). The gender-specific analyses, however, revealed that hypertension, angina, diabetes, and lower body limitations\nwere risk factors only for women, and that having no more than a grade school education was a risk factor only for men.\nConclusion. Men, especially those with low education, women with diabetes, angina, hypertension, or lower body limita-\ntions, and either men or women with previous AMIs, coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis have elevated risks for AMI re-\nsulting in hospitalization, and they should be considered for evaluation and monitoring. Current protocols for therapeutic man-\nagement should be adopted, and compliance should be encouraged.\nACUTE myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most trau-\n~ matic and costly adverse health events that individuals ex-\nperience (1). The majority of AMIs are recognized (age-adjusted\nrecognition rates in the Framingham Study were 66% for\nwomen, and 75% for men), and nearly all recognized AMIs re-\nsult in hospitalization (2). It is estimated that in 1997 approxi-\nmately 1.5 million Americans had 2.1 million hospital episodes\nfor which AMI was listed as the principal discharge diagnosis\n(i.e., ICD-9-CM 410 codes) (1). Three fifths of these AMI hos-\npitalizations involved individuals aged 65 years or older, and this\namong those 65 years old or older (3). Mean length of stay for\nthese AMI hospitalizations also increased with age, from 4.8\n(3). The concentration of and greater hospital resource consump-\ntion associated with AMIs among those 65 years old or older\nwill increase until the growing proportion ofthe older adult pop-\nhospitalization represents a significant challenge to managing\nthe health and health care expenditures ofthe nation (5). Further\nresearch on the risk ofAMI among older adults is especially\nwarranted because AMI is neither an inevitable nor an irre-\nversible consequence of aging (6).\nWhile much is known about the risk factors for AMI in mid-\ndle-aged men, less is known about the risk factors for AMI in\nolder adults, especially among older women (7,8). It is gener-\nally assumed that the risk factors for AMI among older adults\nare the same as those among younger adults, and include hy-\npertension, angina, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes, older\nage, obesity, male gender, disadvantaged socioeconomic status,\nfamily history, left ventricular hypertrophy, alcohol consump-\ntion, stress, personality type, lack of social support, sedentary\nbehavior, heavy physical exertion among those normally seden-\ntary, and ecological factors such as time of day, day of week,\nand season (6-9). In addition, congestive heart failure (10,11)\nand confusion (12) have been reported to be associated with the\nrisk ofAMI among older adults. Evidence suggests, however,\nthat the prevalence of the traditional risk factors and their asso-\nciated relative risks are considerably smaller among older com-\npared with younger adults, especially with regard to low and\nhigh density lipid levels (13), diastolic and systolic blood pres-\nThere are also data to suggest that the presentation ofAMI\namong older adults is atypical compared to younger adults, and\nthat this might result in the identification of different risk fac-\nStudy suggest that there are important gender differences in the\nmagnitudes of the relative risks for AMI and other ischemic\ndiseases (17-19). Evidence of gender differences in the magni-\ntude of the relative risks associated with other coronary dis-\neases has also been reported (20). Therefore, further research\non risk factors for AMI among older adults that explores the\npotential for gender differences would seem justified (21).\nFor this study, we estimated the risks associated with hospi-\ntalization for AMI using data obtained from the men and\nwomen 70 years old or older who participated in the 1984 base-\nline interviews of the Longitudinal Study ofAging (LSOA).\nto identify as cases those LSOA respondents having a primary\nhospital discharge diagnosis of AMI. Multivariable proportional\nhazards regression was used to model the risk ofhospitalization\nfor AMI. This design has several major strengths, including ac-\ncess to a large nationally representative sample of older elders,\nan 8-year prospective cohort design, an extensive array of po-\ntential risk factors that are typically available in an in-person in-\nterview or community surveillance system, and a sufficient\nnumber ofAMI events to facilitate the examination of impor-\ntant interactions among the risk factors and gender (21).\nMETHODS\nSample and case identification.-The National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) serves as the official federal statistical\nsource for monitoring health and health services utilization in\nthe United States and is designed to be fully representative of the\nNHIS individuals aged 70 years or older were selected to partic-\nipate in the LSOA; they received the Supplement on Aging\n(SOA) interview shortly after their NHIS interview. The SOA\ninterview addressed functional status and activities of daily liv-\ning in considerable detail (23). All of the risk factors used in this\narticle were obtained by self- (90%) or proxy- (10%) report from\nthe NHIS or SOA interviews. LSOA respondents also consented\nSystem (MADRS) files abstracted. Similarly, vital status and\ndate of death were determined from a computerized search of\nthe National Death Index (NDI).\nAfter linking the NHIS, SOA, MADRS, and NDI files, hos-\npital episodes that contained ICD9-CM codes for AMI (i.e.,\nused to identify cases. This is the same case-identification strat-\negy used in both the Outcomes Assessment Program in Ischemic\nHeart Disease (24) and the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project\n(25). It is presumed to maximize the sensitivity and positive pre-\ndictive value when identifying AMI cases using hospital dis-\ncharge data. Nonetheless, as a safeguard, a cardiologist (SO) re-\nviewed all hospital episodes in which an AMI was coded either\nas a primary or a secondary (i.e., second- through fifth-listed)\ndischarge diagnosis. That review revealed a ratio of 3:1 for pri-\nmary to secondary AMI hospital episodes. Only 25% ofthe sec-\nondary AMI hospital episodes contained a primary ICD9-CM\nthe majority of these involved congestive heart failure. This reaf-\nfirms the appropriateness of relying solely on the primary dis-\ncharge diagnosis for case-identification in this study of the risk\nfor hospitalization for an AMI.\nDischarge dates were used as the index date for the cases.\nFor LSOA respondents with more than one hospitalization for\nwhich AMI was the primary discharge diagnosis, the first was\ntreated as the index event. Elapsed time to the index AMI was\nmeasured in the number of days since the beginning of the ob-\nservation period (January 1, 1984). Controls (i.e., those who did\nnot have a hospitalization for AMI) were censored at either their\ndate of death or the end of the observation window (January 1,\n1992), whichever came first. Elapsed time to the censoring date\nwas measured in the number of days since the beginning of the\nobservation period (January 1, 1984). Consistent with previous\nepidemiologic analyses of the LSOA, the unweighted data were\nused without adjustments for the multistage cluster design,\nwhose effects have been shown to be negligible (26).\nRiskfactor measurement.-Based on an electronic search of\nthe cumulative Medline database and the data availability con-\nstraints in the LSOA, the potential risk factors shown in Table 1\n(along with their coding algorithms and means or proportions,\nby gender) were selected for evaluation. The demographic and\nsocial characteristics included age, gender, race, marital status,\nliving arrangements, education, income, social support, region,\nand population density. Medical history of coronary and related\ndiseases was measured by markers reflecting positive responses\nto a standard series of questions (including lay definitions) elic-\niting the existence of atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary\nheart disease, angina, heart attack, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and\ndiabetes. Obesity was measured by the body mass index (BMI;\nkg/m-). Physical functioning was measured by the number of\nfive lower body activities that were difficult for the respondent\nto perform (i.e., walking a quarter of a mile, walking up 10\nsteps without rest, standing or being on your feet for 2 hours,\nstooping, crouching, or kneeling, and lifting or carrying 25\npounds), by a dichotomous marker of having difficulty per-\nforming any of four upper body activities (i.e., grasping objects,\nreaching out to shake hands, reaching over one's head, or sit-\nting for 2 hours or more at a time), and by a dichotomous\nmarker ofhaving difficulty performing any of four instrumental\nactivities of daily living (IADLs; i.e., meal preparation, shop-\nping, money management, and using the telephone). Physical\nactivity and cognitive impairment were measured only among\nthe 6,780 self-respondents. A dichotomous indicator of walking\na mile or more at least once a week was used to measure physi-\ncal activity, and cognitive impairment was measured by di-\nchotomous markers for memory problems or confusion.\nStatistical issues.-It was not possible to link each LSOA re-\nspondent's interview data to her or his MADRS files. No match\nto the Medicare Master Enrollment File was found for 859 re-\nspondents (11 %) who had provided Social Security and/or\nhealth insurance claim numbers. Neither Social Security nor\nhealth insurance claim numbers were provided by 597 respon-\nbe considered in this study to have been at risk of having been\nhospitalized for AMI, and the main analyses reported were lim-\nited to this subpopulation. Previous sensitivity analyses have\nshown that this restriction does not lead to biased results (27).\nMultivariable proportional hazards regression was used to\nmodel the risk for being hospitalized for an AMI. Because the\ninitial list of risk factors (see Table 1) was large, a three-part\nmodel building process was used. First, forward and backward\nstepwise methods incorporating several model selection algo-\nTable1.BaselineMeansor ProportionsforAllAt-RiskRespondents,\nAllAt-RiskWomen,andAllAt-RiskMen, WithCompleteData\nMean or Proportion\nAllAt-Risk AllAt-Risk AllAt-Risk\nRespondents Women Men\nAge\nRace\nrelativesduringthe 2 weeks\npriorto baseline*\nfriendsduring the 2 weeks\npriorto baseline*\nPoverty\nRegion\nUpperbody limitations\nLowerbody limitations\nInstrumentalADLS\n*Coded 1for reportinga historyof the condition,state,or disease,and 0 for\nreportingno historyof thecondition,state,or disease.\ntCoded 1 for reporting only a grade school education or less, and 0 for re-\nportingmore than grade schooleducation.\n*Coded 1ifpovertystatusis unknown,0 if known.\n\u00a7Coded using the county adjacencycode, ranging from 0 (thinlypopulated\ncounties)to 9 (corecountieswithone millionor more inhabitants).\nIIOnly self-respondents wereaskedthisquestion.\nrithms were used among women. Second, these same methods\nwere used among men. Third, forward stepwise selection meth-\nods incorporating several model selection algorithms were used\nin a pooled (i.e., women and men) analysis. Risk factors identi-\nfied in any of these three parts of the model building process\nwere then included in the main model, and the main model was\nestimated separately among women, among men, and in a\npooled analysis of women and men. The main model was also\nestimated in three subsets of the pooled sample for sensitivity\npurposes: self-respondents; those with no previous AMI; and,\nthose with no previous history of coronary heart disease (i.e.,\nno self-report of either AMI or coronary heart disease at base-\nline). All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS\nsoftware system, version 7.5.3 (28). Standard methods for the\nassessment of the statistical assumptions of the multivariable\nmodels were employed (29).\nDescriptivedata.-A total of 14,513 hospital episodes were\nidentified for the 6,071 LSOA respondents whose interview\ndata could be linked to the MADRS files.AMI was listed as the\nprimary discharge diagnosis for 440 (3.0%) of these hospital-\nOf these cases, 283 (79.3%) had only one AMI hospitalization,\nmore than two AMI hospitalizations. Mean length of stay for\nthe AMI hospitalizations was 9.6 days, and median length of\nstay was 9 days. Both the rate ofAMI hospitalization and the\nassociated length of stay in this study were consistent with na-\ntional data (not shown) for the same period (1).\nModel building.-The three-part model-building process\nyielded the following results. Among women, talking on the\ntelephone with relatives during the 2 weeks prior to baseline,\natherosclerosis, hypertension, angina, previous AMI, diabetes,\nand lower body limitations were identified as significant (p <\n.05) risk factors for being hospitalized for an AMI. Having no\nmore than a grade school education, atherosclerosis, coronary\nheart disease, and previous AMI were identified as significant\nrisk factors for being hospitalized for an AMI among men .\nMale gender, having no more than a grade school education,\ntalking on the telephone with relatives, atherosclerosis, hyper-\ntension, coronary heart disease, angina, previous AMI, diabetes,\nand lower body limitations were identified as significant risk\nfactors for being hospitalized for an AMI in the pooled analy-\nsis. Therefore, the main model included the 10 risk factors\nfound to be significantin the pooled analyses.\nMain model analyses.-The first panel of Table 2 contains\nthe adjusted hazards ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and asso..\nciated p valuesfor the 10 risk factors in the main model that\nwas derived from the pooled analyses of the 5,982 women and\nmen who were considered at risk for being hospitalized for an\nAMI, and who had complete data (BMI could not be calculated\nfor 89 respondents). Panels 2 and 3 of the table contain similar\nresults from estimating the main model separately among the\nthe pooled analyses, independent increased relative risks (per-\ncentages shown in parentheses) of being hospitalized for an\nTable2.AdjustedHazardRatios(AHRs),95%Confidence Intervals (CIs),andAssociatedp valuesfor the MainModelof theRisk\nof Hospitalization for anAMIAmongAllAt-RiskRespondents, AllAt-RiskWomen, andAllAt-RiskMen,WithCompleteData\nAllAt-RiskRespondents AllAt-RiskWomen AllAt-RiskMen\nIndependentVariables AHR 95%CI p value AHR 95%CI p value AHR 95%CI pvalue\nTable3.AdjustedHazardRatios(AHRs),95% Confidence Intervals (CIs),andAssociatedp valuesfor the MainModelof theRisk\nof Hospitalization for anAMIAmongAllAt-RiskSelf-Respondents, AllAt-RiskRespondents withNo Previous AMI,\nandAllAt-RiskRespondents WithNo Previous CoronaryHeartDisease, WithCompleteData\nAt-RiskSelf-Respondents At-RiskRespondents At-RiskRespondents WithNo\nWithCompleteData WithNo PreviousAMI PreviousCoronaryHeartDisease*\n*Excludes respondents withself-reported previous AMI (acutemyocardial infarction) or coronaryheartdisease.\nAMI were associated with male gender (86%), having no more\nthan a grade school education (35%), talking on the phone with\ncoronary heart disease (63%), angina (60%), previous AMI\n(52%), diabetes (89%), and four or more lower body limita-\ntions (43%). For women, independent increased relative risks\nwere associated with talking on the telephone with relatives\n(58%), diabetes (142%), and four or more lower body limita-\ntions (58%). For men, independent increased relative risks were\nassociated with having no more than a grade school education\n(54%), coronary heart disease (72%), and previous AMI (57%).\nIt should be noted that six of the differences in the relative\nrisks between women and men involve more than the achieve-\nment of statistical significance in one gender group but not in\nthe other. This is intuitively demonstrated by a gender-based\ncomparison of the adjusted hazards ratios and their confidence\nintervals. It was statistically confirmed by the serial introduc-\ntion of the appropriate gender-based interaction terms to the\nmain model estimated among the pooled sample consistent\nwith standard practices for effect modification (data not shown)\n(30). In other words, the relative risks for women associated\nwith having no more than a grade school education, talking on\nthe telephone with relatives, hypertension, angina, diabetes, and\nfour or more lower body limitations are significantly different\nfrom those for men.\nSensitivityanalyses.-Table 3 contains the results obtained\nfrom the sensitivity analyses. Shown in the firstpanel are the re-\nsults obtained from estimating the main model only among\nLSOA self-respondents, for whom the additional measures of\nphysical activityand cognitiveimpairment were available.There\nare only two notable changes: the increased risk associated with\nhaving contacted relatives by telephone loses its statistical sig-\nnificance, although its point estimate is not appreciably altered;\nand, an independent decreased risk ofhospitalization for AMI is\nassociated with being confused. The second panel of the table\ncontains the results obtained from estimating the main model\nonly among LSOA respondents with no previous AMI. The ad-\njusted hazards ratios shown there are equivalent to those shown\nin the first panel of Table2, indicating that the risk of first hospi-\ntalization for AMI is similar to the risk of subsequent hospital-\nization for AMI. The third panel ofthe table contains the results\nobtained from estimating the main model only among LSOA re-\nspondents with no previous history of coronary heart disease.\nThere are only two notable changes: the increased risks associ-\nated with atherosclerosis and four or more lower body limita-\ntions lose their statistical significance, although only the latter\npoint estimate is appreciably altered.\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose ofthis article was to identify and estimate the\nmagnitude of risk factors associated with hospitalization for\nAMI using the nationally representative sample of very old men\ning process resulted in a main model consisting of 10 salient\nrisk factors. In the pooled analyses, independent increased rela-\ntive risks were associated with male gender, having no more\nthan a grade school education, telephone contact with relatives,\natherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, angina,\nprevious AMI, diabetes, and four or more lower body limita-\ntions. With the exception of the risk associated with telephone\ncontact with relatives, these results are generally consistent in\nmagnitude with extant reports using smaller, local samples of\nsomewhat younger elders (8). Moreover, the main model was\nrobust when estimated within the subpopulations of self-re-\nspondents, those with no previous AMI, and those with no pre-\nvious history of coronary heart disease.\nEstimation of the main model within gender strata, however,\nrevealed important differences in the risk factors and their mag-\nnitudes between women and men. Independent increased rela-\ntive risks associated with talking on the telephone with relatives\nduring the 2 weeks prior to baseline, hypertension, angina, dia-\nbetes, and four or more lower body limitations were observed\nonly for women. In contrast, the independent increased relative\nrisk of being hospitalized for AMI associated with having no\nmore than a grade school education was observed just for men.\nAccounting for these gender differences is not entirely straight-\nforward, but several warrant further discussion.\nThe observed gender difference in the risk of AMI associ-\nated with diabetes is consistent with evidence from the\nFramingham Study, in which elevated blood glucose levels\nmg/dL) were statistically and clinically significant risk factors\nfor older women but not older men (7). In addition, other re-\nports have identified a gender difference in the risk of mortality\nfrom coronary heart disease associated with diabetes, and the\ncompeting explanations that have emerged from these studies\nmay be especially relevant here (17,18,31). The basic finding\nfrom the coronary death studies is that although diabetes in-\ncreases the risk for men, that risk is disproportionately higher\nfor women, especially older women (32). Researchers from the\nRancho Bernardo Study (17) suggest that the greater risk of\ncoronary mortality among diabetic women reflects their com-\nparison with a dramatically healthier group of nondiabetic\nwomen, relative to the contrast involving men. Stratified for\ngender and diabetes status, Kaplan-Meier survival curves for\nthe risk of AMI in the present study revealed the same pattern\n(data not shown), even after adjusting for all of the other risk\nfactors shown in Table 2. The Rancho Bernardo researchers\nsuggest that a similar differential may also exist with respect to\nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, such that diabetic\nwomen have dramatically lower HDL levels than nondiabetic\nwomen, when compared with the contrast between diabetic and\nnondiabetic men (17). Unfortunately, this suggestion cannot be\nexplored with data from the present study.\nIn contrast, researchers from the Framingham Study (31)\nsuggest that the greater risk for coronary mortality among dia-\nbetic women reflects the severity of their disease, and their\ngreater likelihood of obesity and comorbidity. Other data from\nthe Framingham Study, however, suggest that the gender differ-\nence in the risk ofAMI associated with diabetes may actually\nbe a function of the differential rates of unrecognized AMI (for\nwhich no hospitalization would result) for diabetic women and\nmen (33). Although the occurrence of unrecognized AMI\namong diabetics is substantial, it is appreciably less among fe-\nmale (30%) compared to male (41%) diabetics. Hence, the\nlower risk in diabetic men may be a function of their greater\nlikelihood of unrecognized (and thus not hospitalized) AMIs.\nThese competing explanations emphasize the need for further\nresearch into the mechanisms, biologic and otherwise (21), un-\nderlying the diabetes-related gender differences in the risks of\nhospitalization for AMI.\nThe association between education and most components of\ncoronary heart disease risk is well-established (34). Those with\nlow educational attainment have adverse risk profiles. What is\nunclear is why an increased risk of being hospitalized for an\nAMI was observed in this study for men but not women who\nhad no more than a grade school education. Two competing co-\nhort explanations are possible (35). First, all LSOA respondents\nwere born before 1915. For this birth cohort, the link between\neducational attainment and occupational pursuit was operative\nprimarily for men (36). Thus, men with low educational attain-\nment would have increased the risk of exposure to a variety of\noccupational hazards that might stimulate hostile and angry re-\nsponses to external stressors, which are known risks for AMIs\n(37). Unfortunately, these socially complex issues cannot be ex-\nplored further with these data. .\nThe second cohort explanation involves differential rates of\ncigarette smoking by gender and educational attainrrent\n(38,39). Data from the Established Populations for the\nEpidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) indicate that the\nrisk of being a current or former regular smoker was 30%\ngreater among older men with less than an eighth grade educa-\ntion compared to older men with more education (40). But\namong the older EPESE women, those with more than an\neighth grade education were at a 60% greater risk of being CUf-\nrent or former regular smokers compared to older women with\nless education. Thus, some of the observed gender difference in\nthe risk of being hospitalized for AMI that is associated with\neducation may result from the omitted confounder of cigarette\nsmoking. Prior analysis of data on older adults from the\nFramingham Study, however, discounts this explanation be-\ncause that study failed to find a significant risk associated with\ncigarette smoking among older adults, either in pooled or gen-\nder-stratifiedmodels (7).\nThe risk of being hospitalized for an AMI associated with\ntalking on the telephone with relatives among women is perhaps\nthe most interesting gender difference. Confidence in this asso-\nciation is diminished because its adjusted effect in the pooled\nanalyses was modest, its confidence interval was wide, and the\neffect had been expected to be protective. Nonetheless, women\nwho reported having talked on the telephone with relatives dur-\ning the 2 weeks prior to the baseline interview had nearly twice\nthe risk of being hospitalized for an AMI over the next 8 years\nas did women who had not. Moreover, additional pooled and\ngender-specific analyses (data not shown) in which a variety of\nmultiplicative terms reflecting the number of diseases were in-\ntroduced into the models shown in Table 2 failed to reduce the\nobserved risk, indicating that having talked on the telephone\nwith relativesis not merely a marker for disease compounding.\nAlthough any explanation of the increased risk ofbeing hos-\npitalized for AMI among women associated with having talked\non the telephone with relatives is post hoc and speculative, a\nplausible interpretation may exist. It assumes that the increased\nrisk reflects a combination of monitoring and diagnostic func-\ntions performed most often for frail older adults by their chil-\ndren or other family members not living in the same household\n(41,42). Women are disproportionately represented among frail\nolder adults, who tend to live alone and experience difficulties\nin recognizing and translating signs and symptoms into health\nepisodes that warrant medical attention. Accordingly, kin rely\non telephone contact to monitor the well-being of the frail older\nadult. In the course of that contact, relatives are more likely to\ndiscuss health-related matters with frail older women than men,\nassist them in recognizing patterns of signs and symptoms con-\nsistent with known medical conditions, and encourage contact\nwith the health care delivery system. That contact increases the\nlikelihood of hospitalization.\nTwo additional issues warrant brief mention. One is the ab-\nsence of the effect of age, both in terms of crude and adjusted\nhazards ratios. This would appear somewhat anomalous given\nthe well-known age-related increase in the rate ofAMI hospi-\ntalization (1,3). The absence of the aging effect, however, prob-\nably reflects the indirect effect of age on more proximal causes\nofAMI hospitalization, such as related coronary heart diseases\nand diabetes, which were included in the main model. Indeed,\nadditional analyses (data not shown), in which age was coded\nin years and in which a quadratic term was included, did reveal\nsignificant crude risks, although those risks were fully dimin-\nished by the introduction of the epidemiologic covariates in the\nmain model. This is consistent with other reports using the\nLSOA that have found age-related risks to plateau at about 80\nThe other issue that warrants brief mention is the increased\nrisk of hospitalization for AMI among men. Men had about\ntwice the risk of women in the pooled analyses. What accounts\nfor this increased risk is unclear. Clinical factors related to the\nappropriateness of hospitalization, differential risk reflecting\nsocioeconomic-based access to care, and more aggressive diag-\nnostic strategies on the part of patients, physicians, and their\nfamilies have been suggested as explanations of similar gender\ndifferences in hospitalization rates for congestive heart failure\n(20) or for comparable racial differences in hospitalization rates\nfor cerebrovascular events (43). Recent evidence suggests that\nthe latter explanation may be most likely in the AMI case (21),\nbut further research on this possibility is needed.\nBefore concluding this article, four possible limitations of\nthis study need to be mentioned. First, because of the reliance\non discharge diagnoses for case identification, this study fo-\ncused on the extent of and risk factors for AMI hospitalization,\nrather than AMI itself. Some AMIs result in sudden death, and\nsome AMIs are silent, neither of which would have been cap-\ntured in this study.The proportion of AMIs that result in sudden\ncardiac death is not well established, with available estimates\nFramingham Study and other investigations, however, suggest\nthat the proportion of coronary deaths attributable to sudden\ncardiac deaths declines with age, and that the risk factors for\nsudden cardiac death are indistinguishable from those for coro-\nnary heart disease [including AMI (45,46)]. The prevalence of\nsilent AMI in older adults is also not well established (2).\nRecent evidence from the Rotterdam Study suggests that\namong those who survived an AMI, the prevalence of silent\nAMIs might approximate one half of the prevalence of recog-\nnized AMIs (47). Furthermore, the prevalence of silent AMIs\nincreases with age for both older women and older men, with\nthe prevalence for older women being nearly twice that of older\nmen (47). Therefore, it is possible that the use of different case-\nidentification procedures designed to capture AMI-related sud-\nden cardiac deaths and silentAMIs might have produced differ-\nent results than those reported here (24,25).\nThe second limitation of this study is the potential for sur-\nvivorship bias (4) to account for the observed differences be-\ntween women and men in the risk factors for AMI, and for the\nobserved differences in the strength of their associations. It is\nwell known that women generally lag behind men in the mani-\nfestation of coronary heart disease (6-9). Therefore, it is possi-\nble that men with coronary heart disease who survived to reach\ntheir seventh decade and beyond had fewer and less severe risk\nfactors for AMI than women of that age. Although the data in\nTable 1 generally reflect equivalent disease prevalence rates for\nwomen and men, those data do not address the potential that\nthe current prevalencerates for older men, but not older women,\nhad fallen dramatically prior to baseline. To evaluate this possi-\nbility, the prevalence of self-reported health conditions was ex-\namined using the 1988 NHIS (data not shown). Each disease\ncategory within the circulation conditions protocol (i.e., is-\nchemic heart disease, other heart disease, hypertension, cere-\nbrovascular disease, hardening of the arteries, and aneurysm)\ndeclined dramatically by age 70 for both women and men, and\nalthough the drop occurred sooner and more sharply for men,\nthese differences were rather modest (48). Thus, no evidence of\nsurvivorship bias was observed.\nA third limitation of this study is that a number of known\nrisk factors for AMI among younger adults were not available\nin the LSOA data, including hyperlipidemia, smoking and alco-\nhol consumption, left ventricular hypertrophy, family history of\nCHD, and stress. Similarly, the LSOA contains no data about\nthe use of therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of first or re-\ncurrent AMIs, such as aspirin, beta blockers, or lipid-lowering\nagents, which are more commonly used now than they were\nduring the study period. Other studies have shown, however,\nthat both low- and high-density lipid levels (13) and cigarette\nsmoking (15) have rather limited associations with the risk of\nAMI among older adults. Indeed, in the Framingham Study\nsmoking was not a significant risk factor for coronary heart dis-\nease among older adults, and high (i.e., > 90th percentile) total\nserum cholesterol was a significant risk factor only among older\nwomen (7). But left ventricular hypertrophy was a significant\nrisk factor for older adults in the Framingham Study, and there\nis some evidence to suggest that it was a greater risk for women\nthan for men (7). Therefore, it is possible that the absence of\nsome of these risk factors may have biased the results, and that\nthe absence of the therapeutic strategies for risk reduction may\nmake the results less applicable to the current population of\nolder adults.\nFinally,changes in diagnostic procedures or ICD9-CM coding\nvolving the identification of salient risk factors (21). The intro-\nduction of new diagnosticprocedures for AMI could have altered\nthe shape of the survival curves and resulted in an increase in\nICD9-CM 410 codes, but this was not found (data not shown).\nSimilarly,upcoding trends associated with the introduction of the\nfederal prospective payment system could have resulted in a de-\ncrease in ICD9-CM 412 codes (used for old MIs), but none were\nrecorded (data not shown).\nIn conclusion, this study identified demographic, social,\nmedical, and physical functioning risk factors for hospitaliza-\ntion for AMI, and evaluated their magnitude in a large, nation-\nally representative sample of community-dwelling adults aged\n70 years or older. Individuals having these risk factors should\nbe considered for evaluation and monitoring consistent with ex-\nisting primary prevention strategies (49,50).
