Shea, PhD,2 Toni Miles, MD, PhD,3 and Mark Hayward, PhD*\nThe idea of documenting and attempting to ex-\nplain differences in economic well-being and health\nstatus across racial categories is hardly novel. A large\nand growing literature explores differences in in-\ncome, wealth, health status, health service use, and a\nwide variety of other measures. This article, how-\never, offers an exploratory analysis of a model of\nhealth and wealth capital, recognizing that both rep-\nresent investments in assets, earning future returns.\nThe importance of this study rests in understand-\ning several theoretical and empirical issues that de-\nserve further exploration. Investments in both\nwealth capital and health (as well as in other forms of\nhuman capital like education) generate direct and\nindirect returns in the forms of greater income,\nhigher wages, increased productivity, lower morbid-\nity, and longer life. Empirically, race is well-known to\nbe an important source of stratification in health and\nwealth. Blacks experience higher morbidity and mor-\ntality and are economically disadvantaged in compar-\nison to whites. It is not clear, however, how race (or\neven whether race) influences investments in finan-\ncial and health capital, despite the important life-\ncycle consequences of these investments.\nDifferences in investment behavior are one of\nmany factors that might be linked to recent policy\ndebates. For example, some early research suggests\nthat the personal savings rate among Americans is far\ntoo low to sustain lengthy retirements (Diamond,\n1977). At the same time, private and public invest-\nments in health capital continue to extend life. The\nfailure to reconcile these investment behaviors could\nlead to even greater poverty and dependence among\n1We would like to thank Stephen Herwald for programming assistance\nand the participants in the HRS Early Results Workshop on Minority Per-\nspectives for useful comments.\n2Address correspondence to Dr. Shea at the College of Health and\nHuman Development, Department of Health Policy and Administration,\nPennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802.\ndepartment of Biobehavioral Health, Pennsylvania State University.\ndepartment of Sociology, Pennsylvania State University.\nthe oldest-old in the future. Life-cycle investment\nbehavior might also be linked to recent increases in\ninequality in measures of economic well-being, life-\ncycle patterns of inequality, changing patterns of\nmorbidity and mortality, and a variety of other cross-\nsectional and life-cycle phenomena. In short, greater\nunderstanding of how initial stratification might lead\nto differences in investment behavior can help iden-\ntify how public policy and private behaviors may\nresult in pernicious late-life economic and health\noutcomes. Understanding the causes and effects of\nthese stratifications can help policymakers address\nthe growing diversity in the physical and financial\nwell-being of the elderly.\nThis article begins with an exploration of some of\nthe previous research on these issues. Given the vol-\nume of previous research, however, this is not meant\nto be an exhaustive review. This review is followed by\na brief discussion of dynamic economic models of\nhealth and wealth, focusing on some of the implica-\ntions of these models for estimating demand for\nhealth capital and wealth capital and the potential role\nof race in these models. Finally, a Results section\nexplores some of the joint patterns of health and\nwealth in the Health and Retirement Survey data and\noffers exploratory models of health and wealth capital\nthat suggest some potential differences among blacks\nand whites in these investments.\nWealth and Health\nA trend in increasing income inequality in the\nUnited States has been noted often in the last de-\ncade. Work by Levy (1987) on the changing income\ndistribution received perhaps the most attention\nfrom the popular press. Several other studies have\nsince followed, confirming the trend and seeking\nexplanations in economic structural shifts, govern-\nment welfare policies, and a variety of other sources\n(Danziger & Gottschalk, 1994, offered an overview).\nAlthough data on wealth distributions is less often\navailable, some research indicates a similar pattern\nof increasing inequality in wealth in the United States\nin recent years. Perhaps the best exploration of this is\nIn related research, Crystal and Shea (1990a)\nshowed that a measure of economic inequality (the\nCini index of income adjusted for household size,\nunderreporting and the value of assets) has a U-\nshaped pattern in cross-sectional data, with inequal-\nity in economic well-being highest among older per-\nsons. Similar results exist from work using data as\nstudies show a racial disparity in economic well-\nbeing that is larger at older ages than at younger\nages, with older blacks having about 50% of the\neconomic resources of older whites, compared to 60\nto 70% at younger ages, despite the presence of\nsignificant income transfers at older ages.\nCrystal and Shea (1990b) labeled this increased\ninequality \"cumulative disadvantage,\" representing\nits possible connection to early deficits accumulating\nover the life-cycle to result in wider disparities at\nolder ages. The cross-sectional data, of course, can-\nnot reveal whether this pattern is a cohort or a life-\ncycle effect. At the very least, this research raises the\nissue of how recent increases in economic inequality\nmight in part be related to life-cycle patterns of\nwealth accumulation and demographic change.\nAt the same time that research has focused on both\nlevels of and trends in inequality in wealth and in-\ncome, there has been growing interest and evidence\non levels and trends in inequality or inequities in\nvarious health measures, including health status,\nhealth services use, and health insurance. Kunst and\nMackenbach (1994) demonstrated high levels of in-\nequality in mortality rates by education class in the\nUnited States, when compared with European na-\ntions, and noted the possible link between income\nand health inequalities in Wilkinson's studies (1992a,\ncontrast the growth in white life expectancy with the\ndecline in black life expectancy in the United States\nthe experience of young blacks, however, as older\nblacks have experienced increasing life expectancy\nover time. Rogers (1992) found a profound link be-\ntween sociodemographic factors such as income and\nthe racial gap in mortality. Nickens (1995) also docu-\nmented the racial differences in mortality rates in the\nUnited States and clearly showed the curious nar-\nrowing of the racial mortality gap at older ages.\nRecent evidence presented by Elo and Preston\n(1994), however, questions this late-life result.\nStarr (1986) noted the work of Davis and Schoen\n(1978) and others in demonstrating improvements in\naccess for many disadvantaged populations in the\n1970s in comparison to the pre-Medicare and Medi-\ncaid era. As numbers of the uninsured increased in\nthe 1980s, more recent work, summarized by Fried-\nman (1994) documents some of the disparities in\nhealth services use across racial and other lines that\nhave persisted and expanded. Differences in levels\nof care for blacks with cardiac diseases, kidney dis-\nease, mental illnesses, and a wide variety of other\ntypes of care have been studied. Data also show\nolder blacks are less likely to have insurance cover-\nage other than Medicare and Medicaid and have less\ncomprehensive coverage (Chulis, Eppig, Hogan,\nAlthough previous research does not ignore the\nimportant connections between wealth and health,\nthe issue has certainly been inadequately explored\n(in part, because of the lack of data that combine\ngood information on health and economic vari-\nables). A few recent studies, often associated with\nthe National Bureau of Economic Research program\non the economics of aging, have explored models of\nsavings and wealth accumulation among older per-\nsons, exploring precautionary, bequest, and other\nmotives for saving. Although some of these models,\nespecially those of precautionary saving, consider\naspects of health, only a few of these (Diamond &\nsideration of the interplay between health and\nwealth. That work indicates that health may be an\nimportant determinant of wealth and savings among\nthe elderly.\nStudies of health capital accumulation that explicitly\nconsider wealth are even rarer. Wagstaff (1986) imple-\nmented a Grossman demand for health model that\nexplicitly considered the role of assets. His results\nindicated a positive relationship between assets and\ndemand for health capital; however, the results sug-\ngest important data and estimation problems that may\nbias the estimates. In particular, attempts to estimate\nthese models with cross-sectional data are often\nplagued with unresolved problems of endogeneity\nand multicollinearity.\nPrivate resources for health may be more important\nfor older persons in the future because of probable\nreductions in both Medicare benefits and in insurance\ncoverage supplemental to Medicare. Changes in ac-\ncounting for retiree health benefits offered to former\nemployees have dramatically affected the willingness\nof companies to maintain past levels of coverage (de\nLissovoy, Kasper, DiCarlo, & Gabel, 1990). Shea and\nStewart (1994) showed that black persons would be far\nless likely to be able to afford increases in the cost of\nretiree health benefit coverage. With decreases in\nboth Medicare coverage and private health insurance\ncoverage likely in the future, private resources to pay\nfor health care and maintain health at older ages will\nbecome increasingly important.\nJust as private resources may be more important\nfor health care costs in the future, private resources\nare gaining increased importance as a source of eco-\ntotal income among the elderly came from asset\nsources, more than double the share from two de-\ncades earlier (Grad, 1988). Given life-cycle disparities\nin education, employment patterns, health, and as-\nsets, this movement toward reliance on individual\nsavings for retirement income may exacerbate racial\ndifferences in economic well-being and health status\nin late life.\nAlthough this review has offered many threads,\nthe theme emphasized can be stated succinctly. Re-\ncent evidence indicates that high and growing levels\nof inequality in economic well-being and health,\nparticularly along racial lines, are coupled with a\nprobable trend toward increased reliance on private\nresources for support at older ages. Although theory\nand empirical work have offered some initial clues\nabout the relationship between wealth and health,\nand how it might differ along racial lines, data limita-\ntions have hampered more detailed studies. This\narticle attempts to make an exploratory use of the\nHealth and Retirement Survey data to consider racial\ndifferences in the determinants of health and wealth\ncapital at older ages (Juster & Suzman, 1994; data\nAn Illustrative Model\nThe most common economic approach to examin-\ning the relationship between health and wealth has\nbeen through studying the effects of \"initial wealth\"\non demand for health capital in the Grossman model\nof demand for health (Grossman, 1972; Wagstaff,\n1986). In this section, we briefly discuss the health-\nwealth relationship in such models of life-cycle be-\nhavior.\nThe individual's problem is to choose paths over\nthe life cycle for Z, a consumption commodity, and\nh, the flow of health from a stock of health capital, H.\nThe flow of health, h, in a given year might be\nconsidered to be the number of healthy days a per-\nson experiences. The flow of healthy days is related\nto the person's stock of health capital, just as a stock\nof assets can produce a stream of income through\ninterest or dividends. Lifetime utility, V, depends on\nthe utility derived in each period from Z and h,\nappropriately discounted.\nThe stock of health capital, H, is produced with\ncombinations of medical care and other goods. It is\nassumed to depreciate at a given rate that may de-\npend on age -- higher ages being associated with\nfaster rates of depreciation. Financial or wealth capi-\ntal, A, grows as a function of the difference between\nincome, including interest income earned on wealth,\nand expenditures on medical care, and the con-\nsumption good. The individual is assumed to begin\nlife with a given stock of health capital, Ho\n, and\nfinancial capital, Ao\n. The individual then chooses in\neach period purchases of consumption goods and\nmedical goods to produce health and provide utility.\nGiven income, the level of financial assets then\nevolves according to the difference between income\nand these expenditures.\nAlthough the actual form for these equations of\nmotion for the stock of assets and health or for the\nlevel of assets or health at a given time is compli-\ncated, it can be shown that this expression depends\non the marginal utility of initial health and wealth, or\nhow consumers value incremental additions to their\ninitial stocks of assets or health. As is common in\nthese types of models (Killingsworth, 1983), the mar-\nginal utilities are endogenous; they evolve over time\nas the consumer's conditions change. Because of\nthis endogeneity, the comparative dynamic relation-\nship -- an exploration of the different time paths of\nvariables -- between choice variables is often exam-\nined in these models in two-step fashion. First, the\ntime path of the variables is examined, holding con-\nstant the endogenous marginal utility. Then, mar-\nginal utilities are varied to examine this impact.\nThe marginal utility constant effects of a variation\nin Ho\non assets depends upon how initial health\nimpacts income and consumption of medical care\ngoods and other consumption goods. Assume that\npersons with lower initial health leads will not have\ngreater income than persons with higher initial\nhealth and that persons with lower health begin life\nwith lower wealth as well. It can be shown that lower\ninitial health will lead to higher consumption of med-\nical care over the life cycle; however, the impact on\nconsumption goods cannot be determined a priori.\nIf we describe as \"health inferior\" the situation in\nwhich lower initial health leads to increased con-\nsumption of consumption goods, then we can show\nthat lower health leads to lower assets. Lower in-\ncome and initial lower wealth coupled with higher\nexpenditures on both types of goods for persons\nwith low initial health implies that their wealth must\ncontinue to be below that of a person with better\ninitial health. Furthermore, as long as the increased\nmedical care consumption does not lead to a com-\nplete removal of the initial health gap, we should find\npersons with low health also having low wealth.\nThus, if individuals begin life with lower initial\nhealth, their ability to accumulate wealth, assuming\nthat their income is similar to that of other persons, is\nlimited by their ability to produce health and their\ntastes for health and consumption. If health and\nconsumption are inferior, then an individual with\nlow initial health will consume both more medical\ngoods to augment health and more consumption\ngoods, because of his or her tastes for consumption.\nAs a result, such an individual forgoes building up\nfinancial capital, choosing to use income and any\ninitial assets to consume consumption goods and\nmedical care goods.\nThis analysis, however, depends critically on the\nconnection between initial health and consumption\n(not to mention the connection between initial\nhealth and wealth, and income and health). Sup-\npose, however, that a person with low initial health\nchooses instead to undertake a form of self-\ninsurance against future expected medical expenses.\nThis person might forgo consumption expenditures\nin comparison with a person with higher initial\nhealth. Consumption of this sort could be called\n\"health normal\" because lower health leads to lower\nconsumption. The time path of assets for this person\nmay result in wealth at some future period exceeding\nthat of wealth of a person with better initial health,\nalthough health may still lag. As a result, the person\nwith lower initial health may, at certain points in the\ntime path, have lower health, but greater wealth.\nThe marginal utility constant effects noted here in\nboth the health inferior and the health normal cases\nbecome less clear if we consider what happens when\nwe allow marginal utilities to vary. In that case, it can\nbe shown that consumption of medical care and\nconsumption of consumer goods, move in the oppo-\nsite direction, and as a result, assets and health at any\ndate of the person with lower initial health could be\nhigher or lower depending on the net effects.\nThe economic model of wealth and health accu-\nmulation, then, offers no strong prediction for the\ndirection of the relationship between them. It is\npossible that the relationship could be described as\none of \"substitutes,\" in the sense that asset accumu-\nlation is foregone in the pursuit of health, leading to\na negative correlation between the stock of assets\nand the stock of health. A complementary relation-\nship is also possible, however, with health and\nwealth positively correlated.\nA simple example might help to detail how some of\nthe racial differences impact the life-cycle path. Con-\nsider a black child born with a typical endowment of\nwealth and health capital. She begins life with lower\nwealth and, perhaps because of this, lower health\nthan the typical white child. Low wealth may con-\ntinue to adversely affect this child's health and edu-\ncational attainment during the early years. Further-\nmore, poor health may feed back into poor\neducational attainment, too. This further limits fu-\nture wealth accumulation by impairing labor market\npotential. The initial experience may lead to low\nvaluations of further health or wealth capital (low\nmarginal utilities) because of the poor prospects for\nfuture returns. As a result, initial stratification and\nsubsequent behavior conditioned on that stratifica-\ntion lead to less wealth, income, and saving and\npoorer health (and health behaviors) in adulthood.\nThe final outcome is a late-life experience character-\nized by poor economic well-being and poor health.\nAlthough this example might describe a more\ncommon experience, the economic theory does not\nrule out the alternative described earlier. A potential\nresponse of the individual is to reduce consumption\nin response to the initial health deficit. This child\nmight save at a greater rate than a person with better\ninitial health. As a result, an examination of stocks of\nassets and stocks of health in later life might show\nsome negative correlation.\nIn addition, this simple model ignores other dy-\nnamic aspects of this relationship. The dependence\nof income on health, the consideration of health\ninsurance as yet another substitutable asset in this\nrelationship, and the importance of the family as a\nsource of both financial and medical support could\nadd further realism to the model. In the exploratory\nresults that follow, however, we merely explore in\nsome descriptive detail the distribution of health and\nwealth across racial lines and use a simple regression\nmodel of differences in the determinants of health\nand wealth among blacks and whites.\nData and Methods\nData for this article are from the gamma release of\nHealth and Retirement Study Wave I. This data set\nare a household member in the household of some-\none age 51 to 61. This project uses persons reporting\nrace as either black or white, excluding persons of\nother races and persons reporting Hispanic ethnic-\nreporting themselves to be black.\nThe summary total family net worth variable (using\nimputed data) is used for all of the descriptive tables\nand regression models. In the analysis, several differ-\nent health measures were employed, including self-\nperceived health and reports of medical conditions.\nFor the presentation of most results we employ self-\nperceived health. Table 1 provides basic descriptive\ninformation on these two variables and other vari-\nables used in analyses.\nThe descriptive tables and graphs examine the dis-\ntribution of wealth across health and the health mea-\nTable 1.

Data are\npresented for all persons together (excluding persons\nwho are not black or white) and for black and white\npersons separately to identify any differences.\nThe regressions, using unweighted data, explore\nthe racial differences in health and wealth in an\nexploratory fashion. Obviously, a complete explora-\ntion of this relationship cannot be achieved without\nlongitudinal data and without considering the life-\ntime income of individuals. As future panels of the\nHealth and Retirement Survey become available and\nas they are linked to earnings data, researchers will\nbe able to offer much more comprehensive models\nof the racial differences in health and wealth. We\npresent a model using the cross-sectional data, in\nwhich initially only a few clearly exogenous variables\nare included. Then we estimate a second model in\nwhich many other variables, including some that are\ncertainly endogenous, are considered.\nRegressions are run for the full sample, and then\nseparately for blacks and whites to identify differ-\nences. The results presented are those using a linear\nmodel for self-perceived health. Nonlinear probit\nmodels showed similar results and the linear models\nprovide a somewhat easier interpretation. In the\nwealth regressions the dependent variable used was\nthe logarithm of total net worth. For persons with\nnonpositive wealth, the dependent variable was set\nequal to zero. Finally, it is important to note that the\nregressions are run for individuals, but the wealth\nmeasure is family net worth.\nResults\nTable 2 describes the basic distribution of health\nstatus in the HRS by racial categories. These basic\ndata have been well-described in previous working\npapers and need not be discussed in detail (Liang,\nBorawski-Clark, Herzog, & Blaum, 1993; Smith,\n1993). Briefly, the tables show that black persons in\nthe HRS report lower levels of self-perceived health.\nWhen blacks and whites are split according to\nwhether their total net worth is greater than or less\nhealth remain. For example, blacks with wealth over\nhealth and less likely to report themselves in excel-\nlent health. Although not shown in the table, the HRS\ndata also indicate that black persons are more likely\nto report health changes over the previous year in\nboth the positive and negative directions.\nTable 3 offers a little more detailed picture of the\ndistribution of wealth across the two racial catego-\nries, showing wealth holdings at decile points. This\ntable can be employed to illustrate the differences in\nwithin racial class wealth inequality. For example, the\nratio of the interquartile range to the median (as well\nas the coefficient of variation, which is not shown)\nindicates that the standardized variation in wealth is\nlarger among black persons than among white per-\ntrates the lower levels of total net worth held by black\npersons when compared to white persons. Only\npersons above the eighth decile among black per-\nsons have total net worth exceeding median total net\nworth among whites.\nTable 4 expands the analysis of the relationships\nbetween health and wealth. One of the first things to\nnote is the lower levels of wealth held by blacks even\namong those in good health status. Blacks in excel-\nlent health status have wealth nearly 20% lower than\nwhite persons in only fair health status.\nTable 4 also shows what may be an interesting\nwealth difference by health across the racial catego-\nries. Median wealth for blacks in very good health is\n15% below median wealth for blacks in excellent\nhealth, while among white persons the median\nwealth difference is 20%. As we move to lower levels\nof self-reported health, however, the pattern\nchanges. Median wealth falls more dramatically\namong black persons than among white persons as\nwe move from very good to good health status, good\nTable 2.

Even\nmore dramatically, white persons in poor health\nhave total net worth that is more than 20% of that for\npersons in excellent health; among black persons\nthis ratio is less than 2%. An interesting racial differ-\nence thus appears in this table. Black persons with\nhealth better than \"average\" appear to show com-\nparatively smaller gains in wealth, while those with\nhealth below \"average\" have dramatic drops in\nwealth compared to their white peers.\nThis difference is not entirely clear and may in fact\nbe simply a result of the overall lower levels of wealth\namong blacks. Nonetheless, at higher health levels,\nblack persons do not show the tendency for much\ngreater wealth accumulation than white persons do,\nand at lower health levels, blacks show much lower\nwealth levels. Table 5 shows one potential explana-\ntion, perhaps, for some of the features of the wealth\ndata. This table shows median wealth by persons\nreporting ever having had a health condition. The\nkey feature of this table is the comparatively larger\ndecrements in wealth among people who report\nchronic illnesses, compared to a more acute illness,\nsuch as cancer. Thus, the differences across racial\ncategories in disease prevalence, and the conse-\nquences of these diseases in terms of labor market\noutcomes and health care costs, may help to explain\nboth the health and wealth held by individuals.\nThe economic model offers one -- among numer-\nous other -- explanations for the health and wealth\nholdings of black and white persons. If white per-\nsons and black persons differ in their substitution\nbehavior toward health capital and financial capital,\nthen whites in poorer health might be more or less\nlikely to substitute wealth for poor health than would\nblack persons. To begin to investigate that phenome-\nnon, regression models of health and wealth capital\nwere run. The models were estimated first for all\npersons, then, by racial categories. Tables 6 through\n9 display the results for the models.\nTable 6 shows the results of the wealth regressions\nfor the full sample, the sample of black persons, and\nTable 5.

Clearly, there\nare some differences in the impacts of gender, edu-\ncation, and marital status on wealth. The impact of\ngender on wealth is clearly stronger and more nega-\ntive among blacks than among whites. Education,\nmarital status, and father's education have a larger\nimpact on wealth among whites than they do among\nblacks.\nTable 7 shows a similar initial regression for health.\nIn this model we again see some clear differences\nbetween blacks and whites. Health is negatively as-\nsociated with being female, with widowhood, and\nwith divorce among blacks, but positively associated\nwith these variables among whites. Father's educa-\ntion has a significant impact for whites, but not for\nblacks. Furthermore, education, particularly educa-\ntion through the high school level, has a larger im-\npact on the health of whites than the health of blacks.\nTable 8 shows the results of a wealth regression in\nwhich several additional variables that might be of\ninterest have been included. Once again, some nota-\nble differences and similarities can be described and\ndeserve further analysis. For example, the regres-\nsions indicate for both blacks and whites a positive\nrelationship between wealth and the presence of\nhealth insurance and bequest motives, with similar\nmagnitudes. On the other hand, the presence of a\nTable 6.

The impact of smoking and lack of exercise on\nhealth is similar across the two racial groups, each\nassociated with significantly lower health. Being fe-\nmale has a much more positive impact on health\namong whites, while the marital status variables are\nuniformly negative for blacks, but uniformly positive\nfor whites.\nDiscussion\nThe descriptive and analytical results for this article\nindicate that there may be important underlying dif-\nferences in the way financial and health capital may\nbe treated across the life cycle according to race.\nBlacks have much lower levels of wealth and health\ncapital than whites in these data, with particularly\ndramatic differences in wealth. As noted in the eco-\nnomic model, one explanation for these differences\nmay be in investment behavior. If black persons\ncompensate for initial low health by using income to\npurchase medical care, wealth accumulation can be\nreduced. Furthermore, the initial stratification by\nhealth and wealth can lead to problems in future\naccumulation of both wealth and health.\nEven at higher levels of wealth, black persons are\nmore likely to report being in fair or poor health and\nless likely to report being in excellent health. Blacks\nin poor health have dramatically lower wealth than\nblacks in better health; this difference is much less\npronounced for white persons. As noted, one poten-\ntial explanation may be differences in the types of\ndiseases that strike persons of different races.\nChronic conditions appear to have a larger impact on\nwealth. Perhaps this is due to their greater impact on\nwork behavior or their higher medical costs. It might\nalso result from some effect related to mortality and\ndisease severity for acute conditions.\nThe regression results indicate that explanations\nfor health and wealth accumulation may offer some\ninteresting differences. The regressions do show\nsome differences in the sign and significance of cer-\ntain variables in regressions run by race, especially\nfor variables related to marital status and gender. In\naddition, some interesting similarities in estimated\nrelationships between health behaviors and self-per-\nceived health and wealth, bequests, and insurance\nare worthy of further exploration.\nCertainly there are myriad reasons why we see the\ncross-sectional and trend patterns that have been\nmentioned. From structural changes in the ma-\ncroeconomy to initial endowments of health and\neconomic well-being that begin the life cycle, to\npossible differential impacts by disease types, a host\nof other factors are important.\nAlthough the patterns do not clearly emerge in this\nexploratory study, the possibility that some of the\nphenomena may be related to life cycle patterns of\nhealth and asset accumulation and decumulation are\nintriguing and deserving of further study. Much past\nwork has focused on analyzing many decisions older\npersons of all races make in isolation -- the decision\nto insure, to retire, to save, to purchase health care,\nto live with others. With the recent advances in panel\ndata estimation techniques and the appearance of\nlongitudinal data from HRS (and the related Asset\nand Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old [AHEAD]\nsurvey; Hurd, Rodgers, Soldo, & Wallace, 1994), the\npossibility of exploring these decisions in a systemic\nmanner that considers their interrelatedness is in-\ntriguing.\nReferences\nChulis, C.f\nEppig, F., Hogan, D., Waldo, D., & Arnett, R.
