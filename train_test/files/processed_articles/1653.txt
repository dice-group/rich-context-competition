The CPCS database consists of case\nrecords documenting all consultations. All data in the case rec-\nords are collected by the CPCS staff in accordance with Ameri-\ncan Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) guide-\nlines.11 This study was approved by the Committee on Human\nResearch, University of California, San Francisco. Subject con-\nsent was not required because the study involved a retrospec-\ntive review of case records, in which all patient identifiers were\nremoved before evaluation.\nCase records were identified for evaluation by electroni-\ncally searching the CPCS database for all cases coded as abuse\nand containing any of the AAPCC dextromethorphan-\ncontaining generic or product codes. Cases were excluded if\nthey involved any of the following: (1) drug information, (2)\nunintentional misuse, (3) duplicate cases, (4) product mis-\ncoded as dextromethorphan abuse, and (5) symptoms unre-\nlated to dextromethorphan ingestion. Cases were reviewed by\n1 of 4 data reviewers (J.K.B., U.K.W., J.W.H., or M.B.), with\nensure consistency. All major outcome cases underwent a sec-\nond review. Data collected included age, sex, caller site, dis-\nposition, product ingested, dose form, coingestants, clinical\nsymptoms, short- vs long-term use, ethanol level, and acetamin-\nophen level. Outcomes were coded according to the AAPCC\ndefinitions.11 Examples of each category include the follow-\ning: (1) no effect; (2) minor effect (self-limiting minimal symp-\ntoms that generally resolve rapidly, including drowsiness, gas-\ntrointestinal symptoms, and/or sinus tachycardia); (3) moderate\neffect (more pronounced, prolonged, or systemic symptoms that\nare not life threatening, including agitation, disorientation, hal-\nlucinations, brief hypotension, and/or a single brief seizure);\nand (4) major effect (life-threatening symptoms or symptoms\nthat resulted in significant residual disability, including car-\ndiovascular and respiratory compromise and/or prolonged or\nmultiple seizures).\nThe primary outcome measured was the proportion of dex-\ntromethorphan abuse cases among all cases reported to the CPCS\ncluded the proportion of dextromethorphan abuse cases in pa-\ntients aged 9 to 17 years, the proportion of users classified as\nlong-term abusers, the proportion of solid vs other dose forms,\nthe frequency of individual product exposures, and the fre-\nquency of clinical outcomes (classified as no effect, minor, mod-\nerate, or major). Changes in primary and secondary outcomes\nover the study years were analyzed using logistic regression. A\nmultivariate logistic regression model was constructed to de-\ntermine the effect of age, sex, year, presence of coingestants,\nand product on clinical outcome.\nData were analyzed from 2 additional sources reporting na-\ntionwide drug abuse. The first was composed of dextrometh-\norphan abuse cases reported to the AAPCC from January 1, 1999,\nfrom a written report generated from the Toxic Exposure Sur-\nveillance System involving human exposures to dextrometh-\norphan reported as intentional abuse to US Poison Control Cen-\nposed of dextromethorphan abuse cases reported to the Sub-\nstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration pro-\ngram, Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), from January\nrelated exposures reported to DAWN are not currently avail-\nable after 2002. The following data from CPCS were com-\npared with data from the DAWN and AAPCC databases: (1)\nage distribution (for AAPCC only, not available through DAWN)\nand (2) total number of dextromethorphan abuse cases re-\nported annually. Only the AAPCC cases for which the exact\nage was known and the age was at least 9 years were included\nin the analysis. The AAPCC and DAWN databases were ana-\nlyzed for temporal trends in dextromethorphan reporting by\nlogistic regression, and the proportion of dextromethorphan\ncases reported in adolescents was investigated in the AAPCC\ndatabase. The general approach we used in this study of com-\nbining detailed analysis of CPCS data juxtaposed with general\nsurveillance data from other sources parallels the methods pre-\nviously used to study -hydroxybutyrate, another drug of\nRESULTS\nDuring the 6-year study period, the CPCS had 1411 re-\nports coded as dextromethorphan abuse and all under-\nwent manual case record review. Ultimately, 1382 dex-\ntromethorphan abuse cases were included in the final\nanalysis. On review, 29 cases were excluded because of\nthe following reasons: drug information cases (n=10), du-\nplicate cases (n=2), product reported did not contain dex-\ntromethorphan (n=1), misclassified as abuse (n=14), and\nreported symptoms were unrelated to dextrometh-\norphan ingestion (n=2). During the study, the CPCS re-\ntromethorphan abuse cases reported to the CPCS in-\ncreased 10-fold (Table). The average effect was an al-\nmost 50% increase in the frequency of reported cases each\nyear compared with the previous year (odds ratio, 1.48;\nnumber of dextromethorphan abuse cases (Figure 1)\nand the proportion of dextromethorphan cases among\nall exposures reported (Figure 2) was also seen in the\ndata collected by the AAPCC (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% con-\nThe CPCS dextromethorphan abuse reports are in-\ncluded in the cases reported to the AAPCC, but these alone\nwould not account for the national AAPCC trend.\nThe overall increase in the frequency of dextrometh-\norphan abuse cases was paralleled by an increase in the\nfrequency of dextromethorphan abuse cases reported in\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

The\noverall median age was 16 years. The proportion of all\ndextromethorphan abuse cases that occurred in adoles-\ncents increased over the duration of the study according\nto the CPCS (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval,\ntional increase in adolescent abuse was seen from 1999\nto 2000 (Table). The highest frequency of dextrometh-\norphan abuse in the CPCS and AAPCC databases was\namong adolescents aged 15 and 16 years (Figure 3). The\nyounger adolescent age distribution is further under-\nscored by the observation that in CPCS reporting the com-\nbined frequency among 12- to 13-year-old subjects ex-\nceeded that of 18-year-old subjects.\nOf the 1382 cases of dextromethorphan abuse in-\ncluded in our study, the most commonly abused prod-\nuct was Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets. This was\nfollowed by dextromethorphan-containing Robitussin\nproducts (Wyeth, Madison, NJ) (Table).

Abuse of solid dose forms increased more\ndramatically during the study, compared with the liq-\nuid formulations. According to CPCS reports, Coricidin\nHBP Cough & Cold Tablets was the most commonly re-\nported dextromethorphan-containing product abused, fol-\nlowed by dextromethorphan-containing Robitussin for-\nmulations (Table). There may be multiple explanations\nfor the apparent preference of Coricidin HBP Cough &\nCold Tablets abuse, including widespread OTC avail-\nability, high dextromethorphan content, palatability of\nthe tablet formulation, and, most important, its fre-\nquent promotion as a product of abuse on many Inter-\nnet Web sites. An increase in combined moderate and\nmajor outcomes was also identified during the study. The\nexplanation for this trend is likely multifactorial; how-\never, it may be because of the increased abuse of Cori-\ncidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets and the contribution\nof chlorpheniramine in the formulation following high\ndoses. However, a detailed examination of the actual cause\nof this particular trend is beyond the scope of this study.\nThe increasing trend of teenage dextromethorphan\nabuse is multifactorial. Dextromethorphan is available in\nmultiple OTC cough and cold products legally sold at\npharmacies and most grocery stores. As little as 1 pack-\nage may contain enough dextromethorphan to produce\neuphoric and hallucinatory effects.14 Adolescents are in-\ncreasingly abusing OTC medications because they are eas-\nily available and relatively inexpensive, and many have\na false perception that even high doses of dextrometh-\norphan are not dangerous. In contrast, other drugs of\nabuse, such as -hydroxybutyrate, methylenedioxymeth-\namphetamine (Ecstasy), and lysergic acid diethylamide,\nwhich are not as easily accessible to minors, have shown\nan annual decline in use among adolescents and all age\ngroups over the past few years.13,15 Considering ease of\navailability as a reason for teenage abuse, it is not sur-\nprising that abuse of a readily available OTC medication\nlike dextromethorphan, with its euphoric effects, is in-\ncreasing. Another factor is that it is easy to fool parents\nbecause these OTC products are commonly kept in the\nhousehold. Because dextromethorphan is an OTC medi-\ncation, it lacks the stigma of a drug of abuse and there\nare numerous Web sites promoting dextromethorphan\nabuse and even providing instructions on how to abuse\nand manufacture the drug.16,17 More and more children\nyounger than 18 years have unsupervised access to the\nWorld Wide Web, including dextromethorphan abuse\nWeb sites. The peer pressure that commonly plagues ado-\nlescents could certainly play an important role in the in-\ncreasing abuse.\nAnother serious concern with taking large amounts\nof OTC cough and cold products for the dextrometh-\norphan content involves toxicity from the hidden ingre-\ndients, such as pseudoephedrine, acetaminophen, and an-\ntihistamines. For example, high doses of acetaminophen\nmay result in delayed liver failure.18 Typically, the in-\ntoxication from the dextromethorphan resolves within\n6 to 8 hours; however, acetaminophen may not even start\nto show signs of toxicity for 10 hours and, even then, the\nfirst signs may be gastrointestinal upset only. Unless these\npatients seek medical care, acetaminophen-induced hepa-\ntotoxicity may ensue. Our study revealed that of the 26\npatients who had elevated serum acetaminophen levels,\nonly 17 reported acetaminophen use by history. It is highly\nlikely that some of these patients were unaware of their\nacetaminophen exposure because it is a common \"hid-\nden\" ingredient in many OTC cough and cold products.\nSixteen patients received the antidote, N-acetylcysteine,\nand 7 had elevated transaminase levels.\nThe major limitation of our study was the retrospec-\ntive design, primarily because of incomplete documen-\ntation of clinical data on some of the poison center charts.\nBecause the poison center reporting is a passive report-\ning system, calls to the poison center regarding drugs of\nabuse are usually secondary to an adverse reaction. To\nour knowledge, there is no study that correlates the true\nincidence of abuse in the general population to the in-\ncidence of poison center reports. Therefore, dextrometh-\norphan abuse may be far higher than the cases reported\nin our study. Another limitation of our study is that labo-\nratory testing of dextromethorphan is not routinely avail-\nable at hospital laboratories. Consequently, our pa-\ntients' dextromethorphan exposure was based on history\nrather than urine or blood test confirmation. In addi-\ntion, dextromethorphan may trigger a false positive on\nthe phencyclidine laboratory drug screen, resulting in\nsome patients being falsely diagnosed as having phen-\ncyclidine intoxication when in actuality dextrometh-\norphan was the agent responsible for the intoxication,\nfurther lowering the dextromethorphan incidence re-\nported.6 Moreover, dextromethorphan abuse is likely un-\nderreported to DAWN for 2 reasons. First, dextrometh-\norphan was not a drug that was specifically listed on the\nDAWN data collection form during the early years of this\nstudy, but rather would only be documented in the \"other\"\ncategory. Second, dextromethorphan is a hidden ingre-\ndient in OTC cough and cold preparations and, there-\nfore, may have been missed by the DAWN hospital medi-\ncal record evaluator during the medical record review\nprocess. Last, another limitation of our study is our in-\nability to attribute case-specific symptoms to dextrometh-\norphan as opposed to other ingredients found in com-\nbination products. For example, in some cases,\ntachycardia, a common finding, could have been due, at\nleast in part, to the antihistamine (eg, chlorpheni-\nramine) or the decongestant (eg, pseudoephedrine) com-\nponents in the OTC cough and cold products.\nIn conclusion, this study showed an increasing trend\nof dextromethorphan abuse over a 6-year period, par-\nticularly in adolescents younger than 18 years. The data\nfrom the CPCS showed a 10-fold increase in dextro-\nmethorphan abuse in all ages and a 15-fold increase in\ndextromethorphan abuse in adolescents is most likely due\nto the hallucinogenic effects of these easily accessible in-\nexpensive OTC products and the false perception that\nhigh-dose dextromethorphan is safe. It is important for\nhealth care practitioners, manufacturers, and retail es-\ntablishments selling dextromethorphan-containing prod-\nucts to be aware of increasing dextromethorphan abuse\nto educate and hopefully prevent dextromethorphan abuse\nand the ensuing toxicity from occurring.
