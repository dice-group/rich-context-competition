Allison et al (1) esti-\nmated deaths associated with overweight and obesity for the year\nFlegal et al (3) also estimated obesity-associated deaths for the\nyear 2000 with a different method of estimation and for the most\npart different data sources. All 3 studies incorporated the first\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I)\nas one of their data sources. After the article by Flegal et al (3)\nwas published, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) changed its estimate of obesity-associated deaths, writing\nthat \"CDC will state, `The latest study based on a nationally\nrepresentative sample of U.S. adults estimates that about 112,000\ndeaths are associated with obesity each year in the United\nStates.'.\" (4).\nEstimates in the 2 earlier reports (1, 2) were considerably\nhigher than those by Flegal et al (3). To clarify the sources of\nthese differences, we first briefly reviewed the methods and\nresults of the aforementioned publications (1\u00ad3). We then\ncompared estimates of obesity-associated deaths for the US\nNHANES I data with various approaches to explain the differ-\nences and to show the effects of several sources of bias.\nMETHODS\nMethods and results reported by the 3 studies\nComparative information about the 3 studies is summarized in\nTable 1. The report by Allison et al (1) represented an important\nadvance in methodology, combining hazard ratios from epide-\nmiologic cohorts with national obesity prevalence estimates and\nvital statistics data to make estimates for the US population.\nAllison et al (1) derived hazard ratios from 6 different epide-\nmiologic cohorts, including NHANES I. For each derivation\ncohort, hazard ratios, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking, were\ncalculated for 9 levels of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2), with\na BMI of 23 to ,25 as the reference category. Overweight was\ndefined as a BMI of 25 to ,30 and obesity as a BMI ! 30.

The 6 estimates were\naveraged to arrive at a final number (Figure 1). The average\nvalue for obesity and overweight-associated deaths combined\nwas 280,184. For obesity-associated deaths alone, the average\nTo update these results to the year 2000, Mokdad et al (2) used\nthe same derivation cohorts, hazard ratios, and attributable\nfraction method used by Allison et al (1) but used the prevalence\ndeaths in the United States in 2000. After correcting some cal-\n2000 associated with overweight and obesity combined--an\nincrease of 47% compared with the estimate of Allison et al (1)\nfor 1991. This increase was partly due to the 12% increase in the\ndue to the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity (7). The age-\namong adults increased due to the increased size of the pop-\nulation (6). Changes in other risk factors such as smoking do not\nenter into the calculations.\nMokdad et al (2) then averaged their initial estimate for the year\nestimate of overweight and obesity-associated deaths from\nMokdad et al (2) next added 15,000 more deaths to account for\nadditional deaths due to poor diet and physical inactivity that were\nindependent of overweight and obesity, to arrive at a final value of\n365,000 for diet- and inactivity-associated deaths, of which\nFlegal et al (3) used a different reference category of BMI 18.5\nto ,25 and a different method of estimating attributable fractions\n(described in more detail below). They estimated hazard ratios\nadjusted for age, sex, smoking, race, and alcohol consumption\nbased on the combined NHANES I, II, and III mortality follow-\nup data and applied hazard ratios to data for the US population in\ndeaths occurred in the US target population in 2000.\nNHANES I smoking data\nIn NHANES I, there were 2 initial questions on cigarette\nsmoking. By design, '50% of the NHANES I sample (the\n\"detailed sample\") received a more detailed examination that\nincluded the smoking questions, whereas the other subsample\n(the \"nutrition sample\") was not asked smoking questions at\nbaseline and thus had missing information about smoking at\nThe responses to the baseline smoking questions in the 2 sub-\nsamples are shown in Table 2.

This retrospective information has been validated and used\nin numerous analyses to fill in most of the missing smoking data\nand provide a more complete smoking data set without statis-\ntical imputation (10\u00ad15). Flegal et al (3) used the complete\nreported smoking data, including both the baseline and retro-\nspective data.\nAllison et al (1) statistically imputed the smoking status for the\nlarge number of NHANES I participants who had missing\nsmoking data. The smoking data reported at baseline included\nsmokers), but the report by Allison et al (1) included only 1496\nnonsmokers, so it is not clear whether Allison et al (1) perhaps\nalso imputed smoking data for the 2822 never-smokers and for\nthe 7502 participants who did not have smoking data reported at\nbaseline.\nAttributable fraction calculations\nPartially adjusted method\nThe 2 earlier reports (1, 2) used a computing formula to es-\ntimate the attributable fraction (AF) of deaths associated with\nobesity:\nAF \u00bc P\u00f0Ei\n\n\u00bd1 \u00fe RP\u00f0Ei\nwhere P(Ei\n) is the prevalence of BMI exposure level i, and Ri\nis\nthe unadjusted hazard ratio (relative risk) of mortality associated\nwith exposure level i. The formula used by Allison et al (1) is\nalgebraically identical to this formula.\nAllison et al (1) used hazard ratios (relative risks) that were\nadjusted for age, sex, and smoking but used the attributable\nfraction formula given above, which is only appropriate for\nunadjusted relative risks. The use of adjusted, rather than un-\nadjusted, relative risks in this formula is known to lead to bias in\nthe attributable fraction estimates (16, 17). We have referred to\nthis approach as the \"partially adjusted\" method (18), because it\nonly partially adjusts for confounding factors (eg, age, sex, and\nsmoking). Although the hazard ratios in the derivation cohorts are\nadjusted for these confounding factors, the attributable fraction\nestimates are not adjusted for the effect of those same factors on\nFIGURE 1.

In addition, this approach of\nAllison et al (1) and Mokdad et al (2) does not allow for effect\nmodification by age (18, 19). Both earlier reports (1, 2) used the\npartially adjusted method.\nFully adjusted method\nA complete adjustment for confounding factors takes into\naccount the effect of the confounding factors themselves on\nmortality in the target population as well as on relative risks for\nBMI in the derivation cohort. Flegal et al (3) used a method to\nestimate attributable fractions that adjusts for confounding in the\ntarget population and allows for effect modification by age (3, 20,\n21). For convenience, we will refer to this method here as the\n\"fully adjusted\" method. In this approach, the association of BMI\nwith mortality is modeled by using Cox proportional hazard\nmodels within separate age groups to adjust for age and allows for\nthe possibility of effect modification by age. The hazard ratios\nfrom the Cox model are then applied to the distribution of the\nmodel covariates in the general (target) population. The hazard\nratios are used to calculate an estimated risk rc\nfor each in-\ndividual with a given set of covariates c in the target population\nbased on the values of all the covariates for that individual, not\njust BMI.\nA counterfactual risk rc\n* was also calculated for each in-\ndividual from the same coefficients, setting BMI equal to the\nreference category and keeping all other covariates the same for\nthat individual. This is a hypothetical estimate of an individual's\nmortality risk if the individual's BMI had been moved to the\nreference BMI category, but all of the individual's other co-\nvariates had remained the same. All individuals with identical\ncovariates c will have identical values of rc\nand rc\n*; the preva-\nlence of that combination of covariates is pc\n.\nThe mortality rate for a given age group is I\nP\nrc\npc\n, where I is\nthe mortality rate for individuals who are at the reference levels\nof BMI and all other covariates, and the sum is over all risk\nfactor combinations. The hypothetical counterfactual mortality\nrate from moving all participants to the reference weight cate-\ngory is I\nP\nrc\n*pc\n. Because the factor I cancels out, the attrib-\nutable fraction depends only on the hazard ratios and\nprevalences of the covariate categories and can be calculated as\nfollows:\nwhere R =\nP\nrc\npc\nand R* =\nP\nrc\n*pc.\nThis approach accounts for\nconfounding of the BMI-mortality hazard ratios in the derivation\ncohort by all covariates in the model and for the independent\neffect of the covariates on mortality in the target population (21).\nContrary to what has been stated elsewhere (22, p 46), the article\nby Flegal et al (3) did not use the weighted sum method.\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1; SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 9.03. Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All analyses\nused sample weights. We calculated hazard ratios (relative risks)\nfor BMI categories from the NHANES I data using Cox pro-\nportional hazards models with adjustment for age, sex, and\nsmoking status. We used the data set without exclusions, because,\nas we showed elsewhere (20), the attributable fractions for BMI\ncategories did not show large or systematic changes after si-\nmultaneous exclusion of ever smokers, participants with a history\nof cancer or cardiovascular disease, and persons who died early in\nthe follow-up period or were measured at older ages. We first\ncalculated excess deaths from these hazard ratios by using the\npartially adjusted method used in the earlier reports (1, 2). We\nthen calculated excess deaths using the approach described by\nFlegal et al (3), first with the same confounding factors and\nreference category as used by Allison et al (1) and then with\nadditional confounders and a different reference category.\nRESULTS\nWe calculated hazard ratios from NHANES I for the same BMI\ncategories as used by Allison et al (1), adjusted for age, sex, and\nsmoking, first with only the original baseline reported smoking\ndata (Table 3) and then with the complete reported smoking\ndata, including both baseline and retrospective information. The\npublished hazard ratios from Allison et al (1) for NHANES I are\nalso shown in Table 3. At higher BMI levels, the published\nhazard ratios (1) for the full sample appear too low and do not\nagree with the hazard ratios calculated with the reported\nsmoking data. The differences between the hazard ratios in-\ndicate that the NHANES I data set used by Allison et al (1) is\nnot the same as the NHANES I data set used by Flegal et al (3).\nThe data set used by Allison et al (1) included both reported and\nimputed smoking data, and the main difference is probably due\nto some problem in the statistical imputation of smoking data for\nmuch of the sample by Allison et al (1). The report by Mokdad\net al (2) used the hazard ratio estimates published by Allison\net al (1) and thus was also affected by these differences. We also\nincluded in Table 3 the correct hazard ratios for participants who\nreported at baseline that they had never smoked as well as the\npublished hazard ratios from Allison et al (1) for \"nonsmokers.\"\nThese 2 sets of hazard ratios are similar to each other and both\nagree well with the correct hazard ratios for the full sample,\nwhich further indicates that the problems seem to lie with the\npublished hazard ratios for the full sample from Allison et al (1).\nUsing the partially adjusted method, we calculated obesity-\nassociated deaths for the target population aged !25 y in 1991\nwith the NHANES I hazard ratios calculated with the complete\nsmoking data. The resulting estimate of 314,000 obesity-associated\ndeaths was almost 70% higher than the published estimate by\nsame target population based on NHANES I hazard ratios. Thus,\nwhen the partially adjusted method was used, the low NHANES\nI hazard ratios used in the earlier reports (1, 2) resulted in\nconsiderably lower estimates of obesity-associated deaths in the\ntarget population than if the correct hazard ratios had been used.\nComparisons of estimates of obesity-associated deaths in 2000\nare shown in Figure 2. The 2 estimates of obesity-associated\ndeaths for 2000 from NHANES I hazard ratios from the partially\nadjusted method, using the low hazard ratios and then the cor-\nrected hazard ratios calculated with the complete smoking data,\nare shown. Using the low hazard ratios produced an estimate of\n289,000. When the corrected hazard ratios with both baseline\nand retrospective smoking data were used, however, the partially\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nWe next compared the estimates from the partially adjusted\nmethod with estimates from the fully adjusted method when the\nidentical data set was used as the derivation cohort for both\nestimates. This allows for a direct comparison between the 2\nmethods with other sources of differences held constant. Ap-\nplying the fully adjusted method used by Flegal et al (3) with the\nsame adjustment factors and the same reference category as used\ndeaths. The partially adjusted estimate for the target population in\nmethod led to a large overestimate of obesity-associated deaths\nin the target population relative to the fully adjusted method.\nThe incorrect hazard ratios obscured the magnitude, and even\nthe direction, of the bias due to the use of the partially adjusted\nmethod. The bias arises both from incomplete adjustment for\nconfounding factors and from failure to allow for effect modi-\nfication by age.\nThe effects of other less influential methodologic differences\nbetween the Flegal et al report (3) and the 2 previous reports (1, 2)\nare also shown in Figure 2. Changing the reference category to\nconsumption decreased the estimate for obesity-associated\ndeaths to 299,000. This is the previously published estimate\nbased on NHANES I shown in the report by Flegal et al (3).\nCompeting biases of over- and underestimation\nbased on NHANES I as the derivation cohort obtained by the\nmethods of Allison et al (1) resembled the estimate by Flegal et al\ncohort. This similarity arises primarily because of competing\nbiases: overestimation from partial adjustment of the attributable\nfraction, offset by underestimation due to the smaller hazard\nratios calculated from data with imputed smoking status. These\nerrors nearly cancelled each other out in this analysis of\nNHANES I data, as shown in Table 4.\nSimilar estimates for overweight (BMI 25 to ,30) and for\na low BMI (,23 for the first 3 estimates shown and ,18.5 for\nthe fourth and fifth estimates) are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

For overweight, the differences between the\npublished and the recalculated hazard ratio estimates were\nslight, and the results of the partially adjusted method showed\nonly slight differences depending on which hazard ratios were\nused. There was little difference between the partially adjusted\nand the fully adjusted estimates. Changing the reference cate-\nestimated excess deaths for overweight from a small positive\nnumber to a small negative number. For low weight, use of the\ncorrected NHANES I hazard ratios increased the estimate from\nthe partially adjusted method, but there was little effect of using\nthe fully adjusted method, of changing the reference category, or\nof including additional covariates in the model.\nEffects of changing reference categories\nThe study by Flegal et al (3) used a reference category of BMI\n18.5 to ,25; the 2 earlier studies used a reference category of\nBMI 23 to ,25 (1, 2). The effects of varying the lower bound of\nthe reference category on estimates of obesity-associated,\noverweight-associated, and low weight\u00adassociated deaths, with\nthe upper bound held constant at a BMI of 25, are shown in\nFigure 5. Although differences in estimates were not large in\nany case, the major change was seen between a reference cat-\negory of BMI 22 to ,25 and a reference category of BMI 23 to\n,25. Changing the lower bound from a BMI of 22 to BMI levels\n,22 had little effect on the relative risks for the overweight and\nobese categories, particularly at older ages in which most deaths\noccur, and thus had little effect on estimates of excess deaths in\nthose categories. Changing the lower bound from a BMI of 22 to\nBMI levels ,22 led to increased relative risks but a decreased\nprevalence for the low-weight category and had little effect on\nthe estimate of excess deaths at low BMI because these effects\napproximately counterbalanced each other.\nDISCUSSION\nThe reports by Allison et al (1), Mokdad et al (2), and Flegal\net al (3) all used hazard ratios from NHANES I (the derivation\ncohort) to estimate obesity-associated deaths in the US pop-\nulation (the target population). Flegal et al (3) used a statistical\nmethod to calculate obesity-associated deaths that was different\nfrom the partially adjusted method used in the other 2 articles.\nSeveral articles (23\u00ad25) have compared the NHANES I\u00adbased\nestimates from the several studies and have concluded from\nthe similarity between those estimates that the differences in the\nstatistical methods between the reports had little effect on the\nestimates. We showed why this conclusion is incorrect.\nThe NHANES I hazard ratios used in the earlier reports (1, 2)\nwere too low, probably because of the use of incorrect smoking\ndata. Once the hazard ratios are corrected, the statistical methods\ncan be compared directly, and it becomes apparent that the\npartially adjusted method used in the earlier reports (1, 2) leads to\nComparisons of estimates of obesity-associated deaths in 2000 based on the first National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) hazard ratios, with adjustment for age, sex, and smoking and a BMI reference category\nNHANES I hazard ratios\nAttributable fraction\nmethod Estimate\nBias relative to fully adjusted method\nwith the correct hazard ratios\nCalculated by using complete smoking data Fully adjusted 363,000 --\nFIGURE 3.

The fully adjusted estimates use the complete reported smoking data.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nconsiderably higher estimates for the target population than does\nthe fully adjusted method used by Flegal et al (3). For obesity-\nassociated deaths in 2000 based on NHANES I hazard ratios, the\npartially adjusted method led to overestimates of '30%\n(.100,000 deaths) relative to the fully adjusted method with the\nsame data, holding all other factors constant. Thus, when the\nidentical data are used, the difference in the statistical methods\nhas a large effect on the estimates.\nThe bias in the partially adjusted method arises from the failure\nto account for the confounding effects of age, sex, and smoking\non mortality in the US population. In addition, the earlier reports\n(1, 2) did not account for effect modification by age (18, 19). The\nbias caused by partial adjustment of attributable fractions has\nearlier reports (1, 2) also used the partially adjusted method of\ncalculating attributable fractions with hazard ratios, adjusted for\nage, sex, and smoking, from 5 other derivation cohorts to estimate\nobesity-associated deaths for the same target population. Even if\nthe adjusted hazard ratios for the derivation cohorts are correct,\nthe attributable fraction method causes bias in the estimates for\nthe target population, because of the characteristics of the target\npopulation itself. The bias results from failure to adjust for\nconfounding by age, sex, and smoking in the target population,\nnot in the derivation cohorts. In the US population, age and sex\nare associated both with BMI and with mortality (6, 7, 18), but the\npartially adjusted method fails to take this into account. Because\nall the estimates are for the same target population with the same\nconfounding characteristics, all the estimates would be expected\nto show bias due to use of the partially adjusted method, relative\nto use of the fully adjusted method for the same derivation cohort.\nIn addition, however, when there is effect modification by age,\ndifferences between the derivation cohort and the target pop-\nulation can increase the bias from partial adjustment (18, 19).\nThus, the use of partial adjustment with hazard ratios from the\nother cohorts, which are less representative of the target pop-\nulation than NHANES is, may have led to even more pronounced\nbias than illustrated above in our analysis of estimates based on\nNHANES I hazard ratios.\nThe NHANES I example illustrates additional factors that\naffect the estimates of obesity-associated deaths. When relative\nrisks are relatively small (generally ,2), modest differences may\nhave a large effect on estimates of obesity-associated deaths (3).\nEstimates are also affected by the absolute numbers of deaths\nin different years in the target population and by changes in\nthe prevalence of obesity. The choice of confounding variables to\ninclude in the models also can affect the estimates. Flegal et al (3)\nreported that, for their full sample, estimates of obesity-associ-\nexcess deaths for a more complex model. Although we currently\nonly addressed bias due to the statistical method used to derive\nestimates, additional bias may have arisen from the use of hazard\nratios that are not representative of the target population.\nFIGURE 4. Effects of methodologic differences on estimates of low BMI\u00adassociated deaths in 2000 based on the first National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) hazard ratios. The fully adjusted estimates use the complete reported smoking data.\nFIGURE 5. Effects of varying the lower bound of the reference BMI\ncategory on estimates of obesity-associated deaths in 2000 calculated by\nusing the methods of Flegal et al (3) and the corrected first National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) hazard ratios. The\nupper bound of the reference category is fixed at a BMI (in kg/m2) of 25.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nIt has been suggested that it might be inappropriate to include\nthe lower half (BMI , 21) of the normal-weight category (BMI\nrestrictive reference category of BMI 23 to ,25 will increase\nthe number of attributable deaths. As we showed here, the effect\nwas not, as might be surmised, due to the exclusion of BMI ,\n21 from the reference category, but rather primarily simply due\nto the exclusion of BMI 22 to ,23 from the reference category.\nThus, in this instance, there appears to be little reason for con-\ncern about including the lower BMI values. Flegal et al (3) also\nreported only a small difference in estimates between a refer-\nence category of BMI 21 to ,25 and a reference category of\nThe earlier reports (1, 2) used somewhat earlier cohorts that are\nless representative of the US target population, did not properly\nadjust attributable fractions for confounding, and did not allow\nfor effect modification by age. These factors may be among the\nlargest contributors to the differences. More minor differences\nresult from differences in the reference BMI category and from\nincreases in the absolute numbers of deaths in the United States\nover time. In summary, the differences in estimates between the 3\nreports can be explained in terms of the timing and sources of the\nsurvey data and many methodologic differences, including es-\npecially the method of adjustment of attributable fractions for\nconfounding and effect modification.\nAlthough the quantitative estimates differed between the 3\nstudies (1\u00ad3), all agreed in finding that obesity was associated\nwith excess mortality in the US population. These estimates of\nobesity-associated deaths depend on estimates of relative risks,\nwhich are measures of association that do not necessarily in-\ndicate causal relations. In addition, these estimates use the as-\nsumption that relative risks from past cohorts are applicable to\nthe present day. These estimates, like other attributable fraction\nestimates, are based on the predicted numbers of deaths if\na factor had not been present. Thus, they estimate the health\nburden associated with the presence of an exposure but not\nnecessarily the effects of possible interventions to prevent or\nreduce exposure (29, 30). These estimates should be interpreted\ncautiously.\nThe problem of bias introduced by misapplication of attrib-\nutable fraction methods has the potential to affect results of\nanalyses that are used to make policy and should be addressed.\nErrors in the calculation and interpretation of attributable frac-\ntions are common, and the direction and magnitude of the effects\nare not completely predictable (27). Further difficulties arise in\nattempting to use attributable fraction methods to compare or\nrank the burden of different risk factors (31). Two workshops\nhave been held to address issues related to the calculation and\ninterpretation of attributable health burden estimates (32, 33).\nThe development and evaluation of methods to estimate the effect\non mortality of interventions on lifestyle-related factors remains\nan important challenge.\nWe thank Karen Steinberg, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nand Judith Stern, University of California at Davis, for their comments on\nthe manuscript.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--KMF: designed the study\nand wrote the first draft of the manuscript; KMF and BIG: conducted the sta-\ntistical analysis; and KMF, BIG, DFW, and MHG: analyzed and interpreted\nthe data and critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual con-\ntent.
