It has attracted increased atten-\ntion in recent studies because its prevalence among\nsecondary hypertension subjects is greater than previous\nestimates, about 5\u00ad13% of hypertensive patients of any\ncauses.1 It has been suggested by several clinical studies\nthat aldosterone itself could cause cardiovascular injuries\nby mechanisms other than sodium-water retention or\nhypertensive effects.2\u00ad4 Some investigations suggest that\naldosterone is associated with arterial stiffness and\nendothelial dysfunction, which may lead to atherosclero-\nsis or other cardiovascular complications.5\u00ad8 In our previ-\nous study, we demonstrated that PA patients have a higher\ndegree of early atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness, and\nHypokalemia correlated with arterial\nstiffness but not microvascular\nendothelial function in patients with\nprimary aldosteronism\nYi-Yao Chang1, Aaron Chen2, Ying-Hsien Chen3, Chi-Sheng\nHung3, Vin-Cent Wu3, Xue-Ming Wu4, Yen-Hung Lin3, Yi-Lwun\nHo3, Kwan-Dun Wu3 and the TAIPAI Study Group\n Keywords\nPrimary aldosteronism, hypokalemia, arterial stiffness, peripheral arterial tonometry, augmentation index\nCardiology Division of Cardiovascular Medical Center, Far Eastern\nMemorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan\n2Woodhull Medical and Mental Hospital, Brooklyn, New York, USA\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital\nand National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Taoyuan,\nTaiwan.\nYY Chang and A Chen contributed equally to this paper.\nCorresponding authors:\nYen-Hung Lin, Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal\nMedicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, 7, Chung-Shan South\nEmail: austinr34@gmail.com\nand\nXue-Ming Wu, Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General\nHospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, No 6, Sinfu 2nd Rd., Sinwu Township,\nOriginal Article\n354 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nadrenalectomy reverses adverse vascular changes in PA\npatients.8\nHypokalemia plays an important role in various car-\ndiovascular diseases.9 In a recent study, PA patients with\nhypokalemia had a higher cardiovascular morbidity than\nPA patients with normokalemia.10 This implies that, in PA\npatients, hypokalemia plays a significant role in cardio-\nvascular comorbidities. In our recent study, serum potas-\nsium level was significantly associated with left\nventricular mass in PA patients.11 However, the influence\nof hypokalemia on vascular function and stiffness\nremains unclear.\nFlow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a common non-\ninvasive method to measure endothelial function.12\nHowever, FMD is limited by its high operator dependence\nand wide difference between operators.13 Pulse amplitude\ntonometry (PAT), a recent United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA)-approved technology, has become a\ngood alternative choice to measure endothelial function\nsents peripheral endothelial function as the reactive hyper-\nemia index (RHI); furthermore, arterial stiffness can be also\ncalculated from PAT waveform as the augmentation index\n(AI). PAT measures endothelial functions of microvascula-\nture. In contrast, FMD measures the endothelial function of\nmedian size vessels. The associations between FMD and\nRHI are low, even displaying no association.16,17 Therefore,\nit is also of interest to study whether aldosterone influences\nthe endothelial function of the microvasculature.\nIn this study, we investigate the differences in micro-\nvascular endothelial function and arterial stiffness between\nPA and essential hypertension (EH) patients, and the cor-\nrelation between serum potassium level and peripheral\narterial function among PA patients.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nThis prospective study enrolled 37 patients diagnosed\nwith primary aldosteronism after an initial evaluation and\nwho were recorded in the Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism\nInvestigation (TAIPAI) database from October\nquality assurance at one medical center (National Taiwan\nUniversity Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan) one branch hospital\n(National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch,\nYun-Lin, southern Taiwan), and two cooperative hospitals\n(Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei; Tao-Yuan\nserum biochemistry studies (including potassium levels)\nwere measured at the first evaluation of these patients at\nthe National Taiwan University Hospital. Medical\nhistories, including demographics and medication were\ncarefully recorded. Patients with a hypokalemia history\nwere defined as those who had known hypokalemia\n(K<3.5 mg/dl). In addition, another 20 patients with EH\nwere enrolled as the control group. The diagnosis of EH\nwas made by exclusion through appropriate clinical and\nbiochemical investigations of all detectable forms of\nsecondary hypertension, including having a post-captopril\ntest of aldosterone-to-renin activity (ARR)<30.26 This\nstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nNational Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, and\nall patients gave informed consent.\nDiagnostic criteria of subtypes of PA\nThe diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA)\nwas validated by the modified four corner criteria used\nafter adrenalectomy as in our previously reports:24,27,28 (a)\nevidence of autonomous excess aldosterone production\nmore than 60%29 and post-saline loading plasma aldoster-\none concentration (PAC)>10 ng/dl; (b) lateralization of\naldosterone secretion at adrenal vein sampling (AVS) or\nduring dexamethasone suppression NP-59 single-photon\nemission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed\ntomography (CT);30 (c) evidence of adenoma at CT scan;\nand (d) pathologically proven adenoma after an adrenalec-\ntomy if operated, and cure of hypertension without anti-\nhypertensive agents or improved hypertension, potassium,\nPAC, and plasma renin activity (PRA) as described.\nIdiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) was classified by\nthe following criteria: (a) evidence of autonomous excess\naldosterone production based on ARR>35 and TAIPAI\nloading PAC >10 ng/dl (b) non-lateralization of aldoster-\none secretion at AVS or during dexamethasone suppres-\nsion NP-59 SPECT/CT;30 (c) evidence of bilateral diffuse\nenlargement on CT scan; and/or (d) evidence of diffuse\ncell hyperplasia in the pathology studies.\nAssessment of peripheral vascular\nfunction by PAT\nDigital pulse amplitude was measured with a non-invasive\nPAT placed on the tip of both index fingers (Endo-PAT2000,\nItamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). The PAT generates a\npneumatic plethysmo-graph that applies uniform pressure to\nthe finger surface, which allows measurement of changes in\npulse volume. The inflation pressure of PAT was set to either\n10 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or 70\nmmHg. The process initially took a two-minute measure-\nment of baseline pulse amplitude.And then, the arterial flow\nwas occluded for 5 min by a cuff placed on a proximal fore-\narm with occlusion pressure higher than systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP). Data was collected from both index fingers and\nanalyzed by a computerized automated algorithm (Itamar\nMedical) that provided the average pulse amplitude for each\n30 s interval after forearm cuff deflation up to 4 min.\nThe RHI was calculated as the ratio of the average\namplitude of the PAT signal over a one-minute interval\nbeginning one minute after cuff deflation divided by the\nbaseline amplitude. Moreover, the AI was calculated by\nanalyzing the waveform of the PAT signal divided by base-\nline and presented as percentage ratio. After natural loga-\nrithmic transformation, endothelial dysfunction was\nStatistical analysis\nData was expressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD).\nStudent's t-test was used to compare the continuous vari-\nable between two groups. One-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) test with post-hoc analysis by LSD method\n(Fisher's least significant difference method) was used\nto compare continuous data of the three groups.To\nanalyze categorical data, either the Chi-square or the\nFisher's exact test was used. The Pearson's correlation\ntest was used to analyze the association between AI and\nits determinants. Data of PAC, PRA, and ARR were log-\ntransformed due to non-normality which was tested by\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The clinical factors\nshowing significant Pearson's correlation (p<0.05) with\nAI were further analyzed by multivariate regression test.\nA value of p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical\nsignificance.\nResults\nPatients\nTwenty EH patients (group 1) and 37 PA patients were\nenrolled in this study. PA patients were divided in two\ngroups: 21 with normokalemia (group 2) and 16 with\nhypokalemia (group 3). The clinical data is shown in Table\n1. Group 3 patients showed significant increases in both\nSBP and DBP, and a longer hypertensive history than\ngroup 1. Moreover, they also showed significant differ-\nences in PAC, PRA, log-transformed PAC and log-\ntransformed PRA than group 1. Group 3 patients also had\na higher SBP, DBP, PAC, log-transformed PAC, and longer\nhypertensive history than group 2.\nPAT results\nFirst, RHI and AI were tested and compared between EH\nand PA patients. The results showed that 37 PA and 20 EH\nTable 1.

In\nmultivariate regression analysis of AI in all patients, serum\npotassium level was the only factor associating with AI\nFurthermore, we tested the same clinical factors in 37\nPA patients with AI (Table 4).

In our present study, serum potassium level\nis the only factor significantly associated with AI in PA\npatients. According to our best knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to demonstrate the relationship between arterial\nstiffness and hypokalemia in PA patients. Two possible\nmechanisms are the alternation of cytosolic calcium cycling\nand alternation of signal transduction through Na/K-\nATPase.38 In a cell culture system, reduction in extracellu-\nlar potassium produces rapid and sustained increases of\ncytosolic calcium concentration and a hypertrophic\nresponse of myocytes in a dose dependent manner.38 In\naddition, hypokalemia potentiates cardiac hypertrophy and\ndecreases tissue Na/K-ATPase activity rates after aortic\nconstriction surgery.38 However, further studies are neces-\nsary to investigate the detailed mechanisms.\nRecent studies have reported significant endothelial\ndysfunction observed in patients with high aldosterone\nlevel by measuring FMD.5,6,39 However, differences in\nendothelial dysfunction among EH or PA groups were\ninsignificant in our study which measured RHI. In the\nFramingham Heart Study, Hamburg et al. have demon-\nstrated that measuring brachial and digital vascular func-\ntion by FMD and RHI respectively that there were\ndifferent associations with cardiovascular risk factors\nand, interestingly, they were almost uncorrelated with\neach other.16 In addition, Lee et al. reported no relation-\nship between the reactive hyperemia-evoked digital PAT\nratio and brachial FMD.17 Furthermore, Schnabel et al.\nshowed only modest correlations between conduit artery\nand peripheral arterial functions and also implied that\nthey reflected different pathologies due to their different\nrelationship to cardiovascular risk factors.40 Therefore,\nthe negative RHI results among the three groups in our\nstudy might imply an insignificant difference in endothe-\nlial functions in micro-vasculature.\nLimitations of the study\nThis study is limited by the nature of a cross-section study,\nthat is, it only shows the correlation between hypokalemia\nand AI. Whether hypokalemia is a factor influencing AI or\nonly a marker of more severe PA is not clearly defined in\nthis study setting. In addition, this study is also limited by\nthe number of patients, and may be underpowered to detect\nthe other possible factors which may be also associated\nwith AI. A further study with a larger study population is\nrequired.\nConclusion\nPA patients had higher arterial stiffness than, but compara-\nble microvascular endothelial function to, EH patients.\nHypokalemia correlated with arterial stiffness but not\nmicrovascular endothelial functions in PA patients.\n"
