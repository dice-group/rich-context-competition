The study included a total\nnumber of 25,372 community sample of adults who were 40 years or older. We used data from community based\nsurveys in seven countries including China, Mexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay. Demographics\n(age and gender), socio-economic status (education and income), obesity, exercise, and ADL (bath, dress, toilet,\ntransfer, heavy, shopping, meals) were measured. Self-reported data on physician diagnosis of diabetes was the\nindependent variable. We tested if diabetes is associated with ADL, before and after adjusting for socio-economics,\nobesity, and exercise in each country.\nResults: Based on Model I (age and gender adjusted model), diabetes was associated with limitation in at least one\nADL in Mexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay, but not China. Based on Model II that also controlled for\neducation and income, education explained the association between diabetes and limitation in ADL in Mexico and\nUruguay. Based on Model III that also controlled for exercise and obesity, in Cuba and Brazil, exercise explained the\nlink between diabetes and limitation in performing ADLs. Thus, the link between diabetes and ADL was\nindependent of our covariates only in Chile and Barbados.\nConclusions: There are cross-country differences in the link between diabetes and limitation in ADL. There are also\ncross-country differences in how socio-economic status, obesity, and exercise explain the above association.\n",

With a direct medical cost of 465 billion\nU.S. dollars in the year 2011, diabetes is responsible for\nmore than 10% of total healthcare expenditures in\nadults [2].\nPeople with diabetes are more likely to experience lim-\nitations in activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, and\nrole functioning [3-5]. Given the growing rate of dia-\nbetes and its associated disability burden in the world\n[2], for different reasons, more research is still needed\non the link between diabetes and ADLs [6].\nFirst, research on disability among people with diabetes\nmay suggest avenues for reducing the disability attributable\nto this common chronic disease [3]. Second, although dia-\nbetes has been consistently related to a broad spectrum of\nhealth outcomes, including quality of life, ADL and mobil-\nity disability [7], and lower extremity function [8], it is not\nclear if the association between diabetes and ADL remains\nsignificant after controlling for other factors, and also it is\nnot clear if the same link exits in different countries [9].\nThird, a large proportion of a major part of evidence on\nthe link between diabetes and burden of mobility-related\ndisability has originated from studies conducted on pa-\ntients, or disabled individuals [9]. However, clinical samples\nand community individuals vary on many factors and there\nis a need to show the ADLs among individuals with\n* Correspondence: assari@umich.edu\n1Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, University of\nMichigan School of Public Health, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor,\n2Center for Research on Ethnicity, Culture and Health, School of Public\nHealth, University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor,\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2014 Assari et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Finally, more research is\nneeded on cross-country differences in associations be-\ntween diabetes and disabilities.\nAlthough literature has frequently shown that diabetes\nhas a role in the disablement of people, further research\nis needed to extend the current limited knowledge about\nthis association [9]. The current study tested cross-\ncountry differences in association between diabetes and\nMethods\nData came from Research on Early Life and Aging\nTrends and Effects (RELATE), that included seven dif-\nuals who were age 40 or older. These individuals were\nsampled in the following seven countries: China,\nMexico, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Uruguay. All\nsurveys were fully in compliance with the Helsinki Dec-\nlaration on ethical principles for medical research in-\nvolving humans. Different institutional review boards\napproved participating surveys.\nThe following countries were participating in RELATE\nproject and represented countries from a diverse range in\nnational income levels: Barbados represents high income\ncountries; Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico repre-\nsent upper middle income countries; and China represents\nlower middle income countries [11].\nAlthough most country-specific surveys had sampling\nweights, as recommended, the current study did not apply\nsampling weights. The main reason was that sampling\nweights were not applicable to data from China (China\nHealth and Nutrition Study; CHNS).\nMeasures\nDemographic characteristics\nThe study measured age (continuous variable) and gen-\nder (dichotomous variable of male and female) as two\ndemographic variables.\nSocio-economic status\nThe study measured education (four level categorical\nvariable of 1) no schooling, 2) primary to elementary, 3)\nsecondary to intermediate, and 4) higher), and income\n(continuous variable) as socio-economic status.\nObesity and exercise\nThe study measured obesity and exercise based on self\nreported data. BMI larger than 30 was considered as\nobesity.\nMain outcome\nSeven activities of daily living (ADLs) were measured by\na modified Barthel index [12-15]. ADL items that were\nincluded in this study included bath, dress, toilet,\ntransfer, heavy, shopping, and meals. These items have\nbeen frequently used to assess ADLs in the community\nData analysis\nData analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows.\nWe used country specific logistic regressions to deter-\nmine if diabetes is associated with ADLs, and if this link\nis independent of socio-economic factors (education,\nand income), obesity and exercise. In all models, at least\none ADL limitation was our outcome. In Model I, we\nonly adjusted for age and gender. In Model II, we also\nadjusted for education and income. In Model III, we also\nadjusted for obesity and exercise.\nResults\nTable 1 shows country differences by means of mean\nage, education, income, and ADLs. Mean age was lowest\nin China, and highest in Brazil. ADL limitation was\nhighest in Chile, and lowest in Uruguay. Education was\nlowest in Brazil, and highest in Cuba. Income was high-\nest in Uruguay and lowest in Cuba.\nModel I\nBased on the first model, with an exception of China,\ndiabetes was associated with ADL, and this link was in-\ndependent of age and gender. Gender and age were as-\nsociated with ADL in all countries (Table 2).\nModel II\nBased on Model II that also controlled for education\nand income, education explained the association be-\ntween diabetes and limitation in ADL in Mexico and\nUruguay. Based on this model, gender and age were as-\nsociated with ADL in all countries. However, education\nwas not correlated with ADL in Barbados, Cuba, and\nUruguay. Income was linked to ADL in China and Brazil\n(Table 3).\nModel III\nBased on Model III that also controlled for obesity and\nexercise, in Cuba and Brazil, exercise explained the link\nbetween diabetes and limitation in performing ADLs.\nBased on this model, the link between diabetes and ADL\nwas independent of our covariates only in Chile and\nBarbados. Based on this model, gender and age were as-\nsociated with ADL in all countries. Obesity was linked\nto ADL only in Barbados. Exercise was linked to ADL in\nall countries (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nOur study showed at least four important cross-country\ndifferences in the pattern of association between diabetes\nand disability; 1) in most (i.e. Mexico, Barbados, Brazil,\nhttp://www.jdmdonline.com/content/13/1/3\nChile, Cuba, and Uruguay) but not all countries (China),\ndiabetes seems to be associated with ADL, 2) in some\ncountries (i.e. Mexico and Uruguay), education explains\nthe association between diabetes and ADL limitation, 3)\nin some countries (i.e. Cuba and Brazil), exercise ex-\nplains the link between diabetes and ADLs, and 4) in\nsome countries (i.e. Chile and Barbados), the link\nbetween diabetes and ADL seems to be independent of\nour covariates/mediators.\nOnly in Chile and Barbados was the link between\ndiabetes and ADL independent of all study covariates/me-\ndiators. Based on a study in Japan, history of diabetes,\nbone fractures, and heart diseases contributed to some\nspecific aspects of ADL disabilities, however, cerebrovas-\ncular disease influenced all aspects of ADL [18].\nWe showed that in Cuba and Brazil, physical activity\nmight be a mechanism behind the link between diabetes\nand ADL. According to the literature, at least a part of\nthe limitations in ADLs of patients with diabetes might\nbe due to function in extremities. A study examined\nhow hand disorders contribute to ADLs among elderly\nmen with diabetes, and showed that limited joint motion\n(measured by prayer sign and Dupuytren's contracture)\nwas more common in individuals with diabetes, com-\npared to non-diabetics. Vibrotactile sense was impaired\nsymmetrically in the index and little fingers in diabetics\nPeripheral artery disease and peripheral nerve dysfunc-\ntion are known causes of diabetes -related disability\n[9,20], and may explain more than 30% of the associ-\nation of diabetes with disability related dysfunction in\nphysical activity. Physical activity is particularly import-\nant for people with diabetes, because being physically ac-\ntive can improve the body's ability to use insulin and\nfacilitate weight loss [21-25]. In the United States, for\nexample, only one-third of individuals with diabetes and\nobesity are physically active [26,27]. Interventions need\nto enhance physical activity of patients, and this may\nbreak the cycle by which diabetes causes limitation in\nperforming ADLs.\nThe current study failed to show mediating or con-\nfounding effects of obesity on the association between\ndiabetes and ADLs. However, obesity had an independ-\nent association with ADLs in one of the seven countries\n(Barbados). Literature suggests that obesity and over-\nweight may mediate or confound the link between dia-\nbetes and disability. In a survey among obese diabetic\nindividuals, ADL was linked to current exercise, using\nexercise programs, and self-reported weight history [28].\nIn a qualitative study among obese (body mass index\n[BMI] > 30 kg/m2) individuals with diabetes, patients\nbelieved that their performance of daily activities would\nimprove with weight loss of 5\u00ad10% of body weight [29].\nThe ability to remain physically active is an essential\naspect of quality of life and is critical for the preserva-\ntion of independence among patients with diabetes.\nLower extremity function is a strong predictor of poor\nhealth outcomes, including disability, hospitalization,\nand death among patients [30,31]. Recently, a search for\npotentially modifiable conditions associated with im-\npaired mobility and lower extremity function identified\nTable 1 Age, income, education, and activities of daily\nliving in different countries among 25,372 community\nsample of adults\nMin Max Mean SD\nChina\nMexico\nBarbados\nBrazil\nChile\nCuba\nUruguay\nhttp://www.jdmdonline.com/content/13/1/3\nseveral socio-demographic and behavioral characteris-\ntics, along with acute and chronic medical conditions\n[32,33]. Among the latter group, diabetes has been\nshown to be consistently a correlate of poor extremity\nSeveral impairments and comorbidities are involved in\nthe disablement process associated with diabetes. Obes-\nity, visual impairment, and cardiovascular diseases may\nmediate the association between diabetes and disability\namong diabetic patients. These conditions are important\ncauses of different aspects of physical dysfunction in\nThe association between diabetes and ADLs did not\nstay significant in the multivariable models in most\ncountries. The literature is also not informative about\nthe question of whether or not the link between diabetes\nand disability is independent of other factors that\ncontribute to disability. We know that several conditions\nthat may contribute to the impairment in ADLs are\nmore prevalent in diabetic patients than controls. These\nconditions may be the actual mechanisms by which dia-\nbetes is associated with physical disability. Some of these\nconditions include cardiovascular diseases, peripheral\nneuropathy, obesity, and visual deficits [35].\nOur findings are important for different reasons. As\nvery few studies have shown exact mechanisms by which\ndisability is seen among patients with diabetes [35], our\nknowledge about the mechanisms underlying the disabil-\nity among diabetic patients is limited. Further research is\nneeded to know which complication of the disease plays\na more important role in the disablement process.\nFurther research is also needed on possible synergistic ef-\nfects of different conditions associated with diabetes [38].\nIn addition, prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase\nTable 2 Results of models I, with age and gender as covariates among 25,372 community sample of adults\nB S.E.

And knowledge\nfrom similar studies may be important for planning strat-\negies aimed at preventing or slowing functional decline\nin older persons and for tertiary prevention in subjects\nwith diabetes [9].\nOur study has strengths and limitations. This was a\ncross-national survey composed of different surveys con-\nducted in seven countries [10]. Research on Early Life\nand Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE) did not collect\ndata on duration of diabetes, or mental health of the\nparticipants. Duration of diabetes is known to be\nstrongly linked to disability among patients with dia-\nbetes. We also did not collect data on degree of meta-\nbolic imbalance, as we know loss of control of glucose\nmay be a mediator for the disabling effect of diabetes\n[9]. Based on the literature, high prevalence of depres-\nsion among diabetic patients may explain a substantial\nproportion of the excess risk of disability associated with\ndiabetes. Depression is common among patients with\ndiabetes [39-41]. Longitudinal studies are warranted to\nelucidate the role of depression in the pathway from dia-\nbetes to disability. Our study is one of very few studies\nthat contribute to our understandings of cross \u00ad country\ndifferences in morbidity related to diabetes. To study\ncross \u00ad country differences in mental health associates\nof diabetes, one study used data from World Mental\nHealth, and showed that with a consistent pattern, in all\ncountries, mood and anxiety disorders occurred with\nsomewhat greater frequency among persons with dia-\nbetes than those without diabetes, and the strength of\nassociation did not differ significantly across countries\n[42]. It is essential to conduct more research to test if\nthe association between diabetes and disability is inde-\npendent of other chronic conditions or not [9].\nOur study sheds light on cross \u00ad country differences in\nfactors associated with well-being. Considerable differences\nin morbidity, life satisfaction, and well-being have been\nshown across the globe [43,44]. The World Values Survey,\nEuropean Values Study, Eurobarometer, and Latinobarom-\neter, have consistently shown that life expectancy, physical\nhealth, all-cause mortality, and also subjective well-being\nConclusion\nTo conclude, our study showed considerable differences in\nthe association between diabetes and disability across coun-\ntries. The study also suggests that there might be some\ncross-country differences in the factors that may explain\nthis link.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSA designed the study and conducted data analysis, MML and RML\nconducted the literature review and drafted the manuscript.
