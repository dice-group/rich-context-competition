Our claims were quite lofty, the\nvolume \"heralding a sea-change in thinking within evolutionary psychology\" (Hawley and\nBuss, 2011, p. xvi). We claimed this because variation in the population (i.e., individual\ndifferences) is known to be fundamental to the evolutionary process. Without it, natural\nselection could not occur. However, like our contributors, we turned the logic: Individual\ndifferences are not only the input for selective forces, but also their outcome.\nThis minority view made the volume unique. To many, the \"evolution of\npersonality\" is nearly an oxymoron. The logic for dismissing individual differences is fairly\nstraightforward: Adaptations, though admittedly context specific, are \"universals,\" and\nvariability surrounding some modal response pattern can be reasonably seen as error\nvariance or noise (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). Accordingly, most scholars in evolutionary\nOntogeny and social dominance\npsychology heretofore have focused on said universals, except for variants associated with\nvery broad categories (e.g., sex).This state of affairs may seem perplexing given the early\nsuccess of the behavioral genetics paradigm and the fact that personality factors have long\nbeen known to play a key role in adaptive outcomes (Buss and Greiling, 1999; Jokela,\n2012; Jokela, Kivim\u00e4ki, Elovainio, and Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 2009; Ozer and Benet-\nMartinez, 2005). In fact, for several decades, quantitative (Figueredo, Petrinovich, and\nClark, and Biederman, 1993) personality work was being conducted with animals (Carere\nThough at least two broad classes of evolutionary theoretical frameworks give rise\nto empirical work on the evolution of personality1, one stands out as particularly relevant\nfor our present purposes. Namely, until fairly recently, a long standing puzzle\n(ontogenetically, if not phylogenetically) was the fact that multiple morphs (some visible\nand striking, others subtly quantitative) simultaneously exist in populations. The most\nwidespread across taxa is reproductive (male, female), recognized as such even by Darwin\n(1871). In many fish and insects, these morphs can be so strikingly different that specimens\nwere long mistaken for different species, making taxonomy work especially challenging\n(Gadgil, 1972; Gross, 1991). Take Schistocerca gregaria, for example. It will become a\nharmless, solitary grasshopper if the nymph is hatched under a low population density\nwhere it is unperturbed by the presence of others. However, if hatched under densely\npopulated conditions (coinciding with resource scarcity), it is more likely to become a\nsocial, swarming locust. In response to physical stimulation in the nymph phase,\nneurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin) are released. In turn, these proximal mechanisms\nrestructure its behavioral and physical phenotype (Homberg, 1991). Its manifest form is\ndependent on its local conditions, hence \"condition dependent adaptations\" (i.e.,\n\"alternative tactics\"; Caro and Bateson, 1986). That is, key environmental inputs calibrate\nthe system toward a favorably competitive strategy for the prevailing local environmental\nconditions. Yet, the genome results in no permanent changes.\n\"Plasticity... is a universal property of living things\" (West-Eberhard, 2003; p. 34).\nResponses to environmental change can be discrete or graded, reversible or irreversible,\nbehavioral or morphological, adaptive or non-adaptive (Caro and Bateson, 1986; Pigliucci,\n2001; Whitman and Agrawal, 2009). Plasticity, like individual differences, was largely\ndismissed by biologists as \"noise\" (Whitman and Agrawal, 2009) until roughly two\ndecades ago, when biologists began focusing on proximate causation and ontogenetic\n1 The other is drawn from evolutionary genetics and accordingly stems from the contributions of Fisher, 1958,\nWright, 1931, and Haldane, 1932. Namely, this work draws on mathematical models of factors involved in\nevolutionary change (e.g., mutation, selection, migration, drift) and the resultant genotype frequencies within\npopulations (e.g., frequency-dependent selection). Such models have been applied to human psychopathy\npresent work.\nOntogeny and social dominance\nThe above described evolutionary model (cf. Footnote 1) is inherently\ndevelopmental. Developmental psychologists2 have long explored proximate mechanisms\nfor abrupt, ontogenetic behavioral changes, though the present language used to describe\nsaid processes was adopted not from biology, but rather medicine (e.g., \"risk factors\";\nJessor, 1991). In sharp contrast, one research tradition that famously borrowed from\nevolutionary biology and ethology was attachment theory. John Bowlby and Mary Salter\nAinsworth addressed similar calibrations, though in language appropriate for their time.\nDrawing on biological models, Bowlby proposed that the mother-infant bond was the most\nimportant first context for humans that provides the basis of personality development, one\nin which automatic and ancient primate behaviors (e.g., reflexes) function to maintain\nproximity to the primary caregiver (Bowlby, 1969/1982). These adaptations, Bowlby\nexplained, take different forms, including grasps, separation anxiety, vocalizations, smiles\n(positive affect), and cries (negative affect). In other words, positive and negative social\ncues in the infant, though very different in form (phenomenal manifestation), serve a\nsimilar function (purpose); in this case, maintaining proximity to the primary caregiver. On\nthis latter point evolutionists are well versed; in the natural world there are several ways\n(forms) to solve similar problems (function).\nBowlby's perspective was refreshingly modern, and, as a clinician, he appreciated\nthe importance of differential response patterns resulting from varying ecologies:\nInstinctive behavior is not inherited; what is inherited is a potential to develop\ncertain sorts of system, termed here behavioral systems, both the nature and the\nforms of which differ in some measure according to the particular environment in\nMary Ainsworth elaborated the evolutionary foundations of attachment theory to include a\nmore articulated perspective on the calibration of personality, cognitive schema about the\nself, others, and one's relationship to the material world (e.g., Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters,\nand Wall, 1978). In other words, the nature of the attachment relationship calibrates one to\nthe social environment in which one finds oneself (e.g., secure, avoidant, anxious). More\nrecent instantiations have extended attachment theory to adult reproductive strategies\n(Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper, 1991; Mikulincer and Shaver, 2007). Humans, not unlike\nSchistocerca gregaria, are in some sense polymorphic, dependent on one's local ecological\nconditions.\nGiven developmental psychology's deep evolutionary roots, concern with\nindividual responses to environments, and experience with early calibration processes,\n2 Developmental psychology is often understood to mean \"child psychology.\" This is incorrect.\nDevelopmentalists study change over time in both humans and animals, and many developmentalists have\nstrong biological backgrounds (e.g., Gilbert Gottleib, Robert Cairns, Robert Lickliter, Jean Piaget) in ways\nthat Child Psychologists typically do not. As a consequence, developmental work is all too often ignored in\nevolutionary circles, or dismissed as irrelevant. This is a mistake, as evolutionary hypotheses have been\nproposed that are contradicted by developmental data. One such proposition is \"bullies are ostracized.\"\nOntogeny and social dominance\ndevelopmental scholars are uniquely prepared to weigh in on evolutionary processes and\nindividual differences.\nLife History Theory (LHT)\nAll species have a phylogenetic history that shaped the modal course of their life\ntrajectories. Life history theory (e.g., Roff, 1992) is the metatheoretical framework that\ndescribes and explains these processes and outcomes as functions of ecological variables,\nsuch as environmental instability and unpredictability (Pianka, 1970) and concomitant rate\nof population loss. A species \"life history\" is the modal pattern of a lifelong stream of\nadaptive trade-offs for allocating finite resources toward competing life functions,\nincluding growth, reproduction, and survival (West-Eberhard, 2003). These patterns have\nbeen described in terms of being fast (rapid development, early reproduction, brief\ngestation, short life) or slow (protracted development, later reproduction, longer gestation,\nlonger life) on a continuum. Fast strategists (formerly known as \"r\" strategists) are well\nrepresented in the parasite world, the constituents of which generally live briefly, come to\nreproductive age quickly, and bear hundreds of offspring that require no parental care but at\nthe same time suffer high mortality rates. In contrast, humans (like apes in general) tend to\nbe positioned on the \"slow\" end of the continuum (formerly referred to as \"K\" strategists)\nas indicated by our slow maturation, late reproduction, and bias toward bearing few, large-\nbrained, slow-developing offspring that require a good deal of parental care.\nGenerally, life history theory has been applied to cross-species variation\n(interspecies questions) in the field of biology. Important for our present purposes, it has\nalso been successfully applied to account for variation within species, as demonstrated by\nS.g. above, which takes different forms to serve similar functions (reproductive\ncompetition) in the different environments in which the organism finds itself. Moreover,\nthe framework has revealed the variability in life history courses across humans (Ellis,\nrecognition that organisms are responsive to complex inputs (the modality of detection\nvaries across species) from their physical and social environments and, accordingly, are\npredictably flexible in their developmental course This intraspecific variation includes not\nonly physical characteristics (e.g., environmental sex determination in some turtles, snakes,\nand reptiles; Bull, 1983) but also continuous behavioral traits (e.g., aggressiveness,\nagreeableness).\nAttachment profiles are a case in point. With LHT lenses (e.g., Belsky et al., 1991),\navoidant attachment is not seen as a maladaptive response to suboptimal environments\nsimply because it leads to unappealing behavior (e.g., aggressive self-assertion). Rather,\navoidance is seen as a persistent adaptive psychological response to a certain psychological\nclimate within the family ecology (Frankenhuis and del Giudice, 2012). In other words,\nattachment styles are different solutions to the problems faced by the child after birth (an\nindividual's adaptation to local circumstances), or, like S.g., different forms to serve similar\nfunctions in the different environments in which the organism finds itself. The group's\nresponse to those solutions is a secondary consequence to that adaptive process. Three\nprimary points from LHT are important to set up the argument that follows. First, humans,\nOntogeny and social dominance\nlike many organisms, have evolved a degree of structured responsivity to key social and\nmaterial cues in the environment (i.e., phenotypic plasticity). This first point is well-\ndocumented by developmental psychologists, and we know what these social and material\ncues are (e.g., poverty, harsh parenting). Where developmental psychology and LHT part\nways, however, is on whether this calibration leads to maladaptation or something that can\nbe seen as beneficial to the organism (e.g., Ellis et al, 2012; Hawley, 2011). \"Human\nnature,\" then, is in part decided by the context within which we find ourselves. Bickering\nover which is the true human nature will generate more heat than light.\nSecond, we must distinguish form from function in all we do as evolutionists. To\nthose in the field, this may seem obvious. But there has been at least one domain, I will\nargue, where this canon has fallen through the cracks.\nThird, individual differences in behavior (including sociality) can be seen as\ninherently competitive or cooperative insofar as individuals are attempting to maximize\ngains and minimize costs in the presence of others doing the same. In this sense,\nenvironmental cues carry information about important aspects of the competitive landscape\nthat organisms detect and respond to. These enduring individual differences (traits) can be\nconsidered \"strategies\" in LHT and behavioral ecology parlance (Ellis, Figueredo,\nsometimes take surprising forms.\nNatural selection and the competitive ethos\nNatural selection at some level implies competition insofar as asymmetrical\noutcomes are a key driver of evolution (Dawkins, 1976; Hamilton, 1964). That is,\nadaptations, or those alleles or phenotypic traits that come to be well-represented in the\npopulation, have done so at the expense of others that become less well-represented. This\npoint of course is non-controversial and has been demonstrated in laboratories, via\nmathematical modeling, and shown to occur in actual populations.\nConflating evolutionary and psychological egoism\nConventionally \u00ad and mistakenly \u00ad this underlying competitive foundation is taken\nto mean that animals behaviorally compete, as if in some naturally occurring Olympics. Of\ncourse some do this, but these types of contests are only a small minority of the types of\ncompetition the theory of evolution by natural selection predicts.\nFor example, from very early on it was understood that prosocial behavior (e.g.,\nhelping, sharing, cooperating) and emotions (e.g., sympathy, empathy) are just as much a\npart of nature as are aggression and agonism (e.g., Kropotkin, 1902). In the meantime,\nthese perspectives have been well-elaborated (e.g., Axelrod, 1984; Bowles and Gintis,\n2011; de Waal, 1996). Humans (and wolves, and elephants, and ants, and slime mold\nspores) have evolved to be nice to one another.\nParental love, for example, is inherently biologically selfish, and attentive and\nprotective parents can out-reproduce inattentive ones. Moreover, attentive parents rear\nchildren who are themselves more successful parents than are children of inattentive\nparents. Yet, this scenario is ill-described with appeals to psychological egoism. In fact,\nneither psychological egoism nor \"competition\" in the conventional sense are required of\nOntogeny and social dominance\nsuperior strategies. On the other hand, it is preposterous to think of a cellular slime mold\nspore that adopts the role of the supportive stalk and consequently foregoes its own\nreproduction to support that of another cell as psychologically altruistic (see Hawley, 2014\nfor extended handling of psychological and evolutionary altruism and egoism).\nBiological altruism (or selfishness) applies to every living organism, regardless of\nwhere you stand in the eusociality-inclusive fitness debate. Psychological\naltruism/selfishness applies to very few. Having a brain of some kind is a bare minimal\ncondition. If we're going to create a general model of behavior, we should consider the\nwhole continuum of life and eschew human exceptionalism as a philosophical starting\npoint. Yet, one still finds confusion even among academics over whether evolutionary self-\ninterest (or \"selfishness\"; Dawkins, 1976) means behavioral or psychological self-interest\ntwo as well.4\nConsequences of conflating evolutionary and psychological egoism\nThis confounding of psychological and biological egoism has led to a number of\ncircuitous detours in evolutionary circles, and has seriously confounded non-evolutionary\nwriters' attempts to incorporate evolutionary logic. One sees this confounding emerge\nregularly in debates over group- versus individual-level selection, for example, and has led\nsome very influential, venerated writers to claim that group selection accounts for the\norigin of \"virtue\" whereas individual level selection gives rise to \"sin\" (Wilson, 2012).\nThese discussions are highly visible because teams of outspoken eminent writers are\nsparring in open forums (see, for example, Edge.org; Abbot et al., 2011). These discussions\nare interesting to the lay public because one side seems to provide the biological\nunderpinnings for morality and religion while the other does not.\nBut in one domain of inquiry, this influence has crept in invisibly to great effect;\nnamely, in discussing hierarchical political systems, such as leadership, egalitarianism, and\nsocial dominance. If you want humans to be \"good,\" you will favor leadership and\negalitarianism, and eschew social dominance. In my view (and as I have argued at length\nelsewhere in the developmental literature over a decade ago; Hawley, 1999), this is a false\nand misleading debate based on overly narrow conceptions of dominance and a conflation\nof form and function.\nDominance: What's in a Word?\nDominant: Exercising chief authority or rule; Occupying a commanding position.\nEtymology: Latin domint- participial stem of dominr to bear rule, govern.\n3 \"Evolution is based on a fierce competition between individuals and should therefore only reward selfish\n4 \"...each man would soon learn from experience that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly\nreceive aid in return. From this low motive he might acquire... the habit of performing benevolent actions\"\nOntogeny and social dominance\nThe above definition of dominant was drawn from the Oxford English Dictionary,\nwhich indicates this is accepted use since the mid-16th century. Important for our purposes,\nnotice that nowhere in this definition is implied how dominance is accomplished. In terms\nof the form-function discussion above, this is a functional definition. 5\nDominance and dominance hierarchies entered the modern biological vernacular in\nthe early 19th century. At that time, narrow views of the competitive essence of natural\nselection predominated. Accordingly, this view led early animal behavior researchers to\nlook for hierarchical behavior in asymmetries in agonism and aggression. The very first\ndominance hierarchy to be described was the peck-order of chickens (Schjelderup- Ebbe,\n1922). Quite literally, it was a description of how hens compete for desired resources by\npecking each other. This work was highly influential and gave rise to the aggression-based\nview of social dominance that persists to this day across species and taxa (e.g., Alonso,\nYamada, Matsuura, Tsukada and Tsuchida, 2011; Krebs and Davies, 1997; Pelletier and\nFesta-Bianchet, 2006). Textbooks and journal articles define dominance as a \"sexually\nselected manifestation of conflict\" (Alcock, 2005; p. 332), a \"pure exercise of power by\nsocially dominant males\" (Gintis, in press), where \"alpha males control group activities and\nothers are intimidated or forced to acquiesce\" (van Vugt, Hogan, and Kaiser, 2008, p 191;\nMoreover, the peck order construal quickly impacted work in child development\n(e.g., B\u00fchler, 1927), and similarly has left a legacy of continued focus on the form of\nbehavior (agonistic contests, fighting ability, submissive gestures), even though the\nfunction of such contests is always understood to be resource control (the theoretical\nmodel; see Hawley, 1999 for extended discussion; Carpenter, 1942 for conflation of form\nand function in a single definition6) For example, Abramovitch (1976) defined dominance\nas property fights, involving \"struggles\" or \"tussles.\"\nConsequences to favoring agonism as a strategy of resource control\nThere are at least two consequences of this form-focused view that equates\ndominance with agonism. First, it is (adult) male centered, which leads to several\nconsequences of its own. Second, it ignores the instrumentality of being nice.\nDominance and the masculine political structure. Males are more physically\naggressive than females as early as the age of 3, on average (Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974).\nThis is not controversial. However, it is then just a small step to conclude that social\ndominance is the purview of males, and a smaller step further to conclude, therefore, the\npredominant political structure in group living social species (i.e., hierarchical structure) is\n5 Perhaps there is a conflation with \"domineering\"; Ruling arbitrarily or imperiously; tyrannical, despotic;\noverbearing, insolent (Oxford English Dictionary, 2013).\n6 \"Carpenter... defined dominance in terms of priority of access to food, mating, and position in the group\nwhile traveling, along with superiority in aggressiveness or group control-- a definition that holds today\"\nOntogeny and social dominance\nessentially masculine. This conclusion is reified into an assumption. Not surprisingly then,\nit is often claimed that socially dominant males hold the central positions in their social\ngroups (Gintis, in press) and consequently enjoy differential attention and grooming, as\nwell as priority in ally selection and access to mates (de Waal, 1982a; Dunbar, 1988).\nThere is nothing wrong with this focus as it led to discovering the signaling value of\ndominance and submission displays, and uncovering even in \"simple\" species (e.g., fish;\nHsu, Early, and Wolf, 2006) the ability to learn from one's previous interactions with a\nconspecific. I would argue, however, that the agonism view is incomplete, or certainly so\nsay primatologists who have beautifully described and explained the complex strategies \u00ad\nsome nice and some nasty \u00ad that primates use to \"occupy a commanding position\" (Boehm,\ninfants (Mascaro and Csibra, 2012) need see any act of aggression to draw important and\nenduring conclusions about relative ranks among others (see also early work on leadership\nin humans that similarly demonstrated that humans can \"exercise chief authority or rule\" in\nvariegated ways; the most eloquent and thorough, in my view, was Machiavelli's\nAn unintended consequence of this focus on male aggression is that the political\nstructures of females were (and continue to be) downplayed relative to males' (as were\npatterns of aggression in females). Indeed, some prominent primatologists (e.g., Hrdy,\nless visible to field workers, are in fact longer lasting. And presumably because behaviors\nused for hierarchy ascent take a different form (but not a different function), they have been\nmuch harder to document (e.g., reproductive suppression). In contrast, the function-focus\napproach presented here shines light on variegated ascension strategies, and as a side-effect\n(not a central goal), female status-striving.\nForm-focus ignores instrumentality of being a good group member and a good\ncooperator. Second, being a good group member is highly instrumental. I use the term\n\"instrumental\" because it is more neutral than its linguistic cousins, \"egoistic\" or \"selfish,\"\nwhich are highly pejorative and a source of confusion in psychological circles.\n\"Instrumentality\" neutrally connotes that some goal is attained by what an organism does,\nand yet it says nothing about psychological egoism or altruism, which are, for the most\npart, irrelevant for the present work.\nCooperation, for example, is a very effective material goal pursuit strategy\n(Charlesworth, 1996). Together we can pursue goals (e.g., grants) that neither can\nsuccessfully attain alone. Admittedly, the word \"cooperation\" is tricky because it has been\nused in different ways. For example, evolutionary perspectives from economics use the\nterm interchangeably with altruism, which in biological circles (not psychological circles)\ngenerally means engaging in behavior that enhances the fitness benefits of another while\nbearing a fitness cost to the self (-/+). Thus, in this literature, cooperation is assumed to be\ncost-bearing (e.g., Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson, 2003; Dreber, Rand, Fudenberg,\nand Nowak., 2008; Nowak, 2006: \"...the self-interest model predicts no cooperation\";\nGintis, in press, p. 3), its extreme form manifesting in eusociality where most of the group\nmembers are of castes that forego reproduction altogether to support the reproduction of a\nfew (Nowak, Tarnita, and Wilson, 2010). Cooperation, then, is viewed in these circles to\nOntogeny and social dominance\ndemonstrate some degree of sacrifice for the welfare of others.\nThe above view may strike some as narrow and semantically confusing because of\nthe cooperation-altruism conflation. Say \"altruism\" to a psychologist and they think\nmotivationally \"selfless.\" Use cooperation and altruism interchangeably, the psychologist\nassumes cooperation is motivationally selfless. The surface logic seems sound. Therein lies\nthe danger of using metaphor to explain biological concepts (see Hawley, 2014, for\nextended treatment).\nInstead, the present view is more explicitly in line with Adam Smith's proposal that\ncooperation stems not out of self-sacrifice, but rather self-interest as a primary concern.\nSmith, unaware of biological evolution, could only then be talking about psychological\nself-interest (e.g., I sell you bread so that I can make money. You having bread is\nsecondary to me). Like other evolutionary thinkers concerned with various forms of\nreciprocity (e.g., Hamilton, 1964; Trivers, 1971), the function of the behavior is biological\nself-interest (with psychological self-interest being wide open to debate) and it is\n\"cooperative\" in terms of it benefitting another (see also West, Griffin, and Gardner, 2007).\nSelf-sacrifice is not inherent to this point of view (see also Alexander, 1987; Trivers, 1971)\nas the behavior can be mutually beneficial (+/+; West et al, 2007). Indeed, mutual benefit\nseems to underlie the formation of human society in ways that sets us apart from the apes\nThat humans can be reciprocally nice (i.e., prosocial) as a consequence of\nevolutionary forces is not controversial. The high-level, sometimes acrimonious discussion\nin top tier journals is about evolutionary mechanisms underlying cooperation (e.g.,\nindividuals vs. group; Abbot et al., 2011; Nowak, Tarnita, and Wilson, 2011), none of\nwhich have any bearing on the present piece, accentuated by a failure to distinguish\nbiological from psychological self-interest. For our purposes, it is enough to say that one\nbenefits from group living because solitary living bears enormous costs in many domains\n(food procurement, protection, rearing young; Krause and Ruxton, 2002), and these\nbenefits naturally select behaviors that increase the probability that the group accepts us as\nvalued group members. Valuing others is a case in point. People who valued others were\nmore likely to treat group members with respect and goodwill than were people who did\nnot value others (this of course is true even today). They were more likely to make friends\nand benefit from these friendships as we still do (e.g., social and material support, child\nrearing; Hrdy, 2009). As a result of a long history of humans forming mutually beneficial\nfriendly relationships (i.e., indirect reciprocity), the desire for attachments to others is seen\nas a basic and foundational human need with deep evolutionary roots (Baumeister and\n7 Economists utilizing game theoretic models appear to refer to regarding the other while regarding the self as\n\"other regarding preferences\" (in contrast to narrowly focused \"self regarding preferences\" which refer to\nexclusive concern with one's own advantage). Consequently, the cautious reader must bear in mind that\n\"other regarding preferences\" are not to be read as \"selfless,\" since ORPs still include self payoff.\nOntogeny and social dominance\nand Altmann, 2003). Thus, it pays to be nice to others, especially if those others are in a\nposition to bestow benefits.8 This latter point is foundational to resource control theory.\nResource Control Theory\nResource control theory (Hawley, 1999), with roots in the work of human\ndevelopmental theory of social dominance that, as has been set up above, is a theory of\nindividual differences in behavior and personality, considers the developing child to be\nresponsive to key social and material cues in what is essentially a competitive environment.\nAs with other animal species, outcomes to these daily competitions are presumed to be\nhighly visible. I use the function-focused term \"dominance\" to set up important questions\nabout the development of behavioral forms (i.e., strategies) \u00ad which may be either\nnegatively valenced (e.g., agonism) or positively valenced (e.g., cooperation) \u00ad used to\n\"occupy a commanding position\" (OED).\nResource control\nHere, resource control refers to the extent to which individuals successfully access\nsocial, material, or informational resources relative to others. This definition is sufficiently\ngeneral to include access to and attention from high status others (social), objects meeting\none's survival needs and denoting status (material, e.g., food, clothing: Sahlins, 1963; van\nVugt and Hardy, 2010), and valuable information regarding work, school projects, or\nevents (informational; Hawley, Shorey, and Alderman, 2009; Keltner, Gruenfeld, and\nResource control strategies\nMeeting one's needs in a social group, or successfully competing for resources in\nthe presence of others, can certainly be achieved directly, expediently, and without\nconsideration for the goals and motivations of others. But they can also be met by\ncoordinating efforts with other group members.\nCoercive strategies. Following the lead of ethologists and biologists, RCT\nrecognizes the utility of aggression, especially in contexts that have a zero-sum quality.\nElaborating somewhat to accommodate humans' rather advanced cognitive capacities,\ndeception and overt manipulation reside in this category (Byrne and Whiten, 1988). These\n8 Developmental psychologists seem, as a rule, uncomfortable with the possibility that friendship selection is\npsychologically selfish. College students, however, are not. This latter group openly reports that they are very\naware of the benefits they get from friends, and moreover admit that their friend selection has key\ninstrumental elements, that they are keenly aware when they do not receive the benefits they had hoped for,\nand will readily drop a friend (\"parasite\") who does not reciprocate material benefits (e.g., invitations, food,\ndrink, favors; see Trivers, 1971 for an evolutionary foundation for these processes, and social exchange\ntheories for a psychological view: Blau, 1964; Walster, Walster, and Berscheid, 1978).\nOntogeny and social dominance\nstrategies characteristically exploit individual group members or bypass the social group\nentirely.\nAs straightforward as these strategies seem, they are the source of a good deal of\ncontroversy. This friction is important for our present purposes because it points to the\nvalue-added by the present view. Namely, there is a prevalent assumption that social\ngroups are intolerant of such brazenly (e.g., psychologically) self-serving behaviors. This\nassumption has been made in anthropological (Boehm, 1999), economic (Fehr and G\u00e4chter,\n2000), and child development circles (Coie and Dodge, 1998). Yet, in the field of child\ndevelopment, this wisdom is being chipped away: There is emerging evidence that suggests\nthat a sizeable subset of the aggressively powerful youths are highly regarded by peers and\nare even sought out for friendships and alliances. They are anything but ostracized. RCT\nholds a morally neutral view to such behavior (i.e., eschewing monikers of virtue and evil)\nand instead it predicts that those occupying commanding positions (i.e., those who have\ndemonstrated competitive success, the socially dominant) will win positive regard because\nof their evident effectiveness in the material world. Simply put, we should find power\nattractive, even if this power is wielded aggressively (the social centrality hypothesis;\nHawley, 1999). This point will be re-addressed in more detail later.\nProsocial strategies. Quite unlike coercive strategies, prosocial strategies'\ntheoretical roots are in the evolution of cooperation and reciprocation (e.g., Trivers, 1971;\nCharlesworth, 1996). Here, competition takes on a non-zero sum quality; multiple\ninteractants can gain in this cooperative or reciprocal context. Instead of bypassing the\nsocial group, as direct means do, indirect strategies exploit the mediating effect of the\nsocial group to access resources prosocially. These strategies too are the source of some\nirritation in the literature predominantly centering on confusion about the term \"prosocial.\"\nIn specific terms, prosocial behavior refers to \"voluntary actions that are intended to\nhelp or benefit another individual\" (Eisenberg and Mussen 1989, p. 3). Important for our\npurposes, especially in light of the common conflation of biological and psychological self-\ninterest, this definition does not favor any one of a variety of possible underlying\npsychological motivations (egoistic or altruistic) (Campbell and Christopher, 1996;\nEisenberg, 1996; Eisenberg and Giallanza, 1984). Nor does this definition rule out self-\nbenefit. Thus, prosociality may be blatantly psychologically egoistic (e.g., performed\nconsciously for present or future reward), subtly egoistic (winning favor from a colleague),\nor psychologically altruistic (i.e., motivated only by true other-oriented/selfless concerns;\nEisenberg and Mussen, 1989). In reality, underlying psychological motivations are likely\ncomplex. Yet, most studies in the field of child development have tended to focus on\naltruism and have shown that even at an early age, children are capable of psychological\naltruism or the precursors thereof (Hoffman, 1983, 1994; Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow, and\nKing, 1983). All of these motivations, however, may in fact be ultimately (evolutionarily)\ninstrumental. Natural selection does not require you to know why you're doing what you're\ndoing; only that your genes benefit from it, directly or indirectly. This point would be true\nregardless of whether one found individual level selection (direct benefit) or group\nselection (indirect benefit) more compelling (Hawley, 2014).\nOntogeny and social dominance\nThe development of social dominance and power\nBowlby understood that both positively valenced (smiling, touching) and negatively\nvalenced behaviors (e.g., crying, protesting) are instrumental in human infants; both pay in\nterms of strengthening the bond to the caregiver, the first source of social, material, and\ninformational resources. These strategies are honed and elaborated in the peer group via\noperant and social learning processes (i.e., selection by consequence). A child may learn\nthat pinching is highly effective at wresting the swing from a peer. Teachers and parents,\nhowever, will attempt to teach her that smiling and sharing is more effective and socially\npreferable. These foundations give rise to interesting developmental questions.\nWhat predicts dominance differentials and do they organize non-competitive social\nbehavior? It has been repeatedly shown that it is possible to organize children in a group\naccording to high and low dominance rank (e.g., Strayer and Strayer, 1976). Doing so only\nhas meaning, however, if these relative competitive differentials are associated with\nbehavior outside of the competitive context, an influence that speaks to the central\norganizing power of this aspect of relationships (I have argued elsewhere that the early\nethological work had limitations in this regard; Hawley, 2007). Our own attempts at\nborrowing from the social relations model of social psychology (Kenny and LaVoie, 1984)\nsuggested that when put in pairwise interactions in a non-competitive play situation (where\nthere are plenty of toys for both interactants), dominance rank nonetheless mediates the\nrelationship between characteristics of the child (e.g., cognitive age, gender, temperament)\nand play behavior. These path models spoke to two important issues: the predictors of\nrelative success in toddlers and the power of these differentials to predict non-competitive\nsocial behavior (Hawley and Little, 1999).\nRegarding the first issue, we began to chip away at long-held beliefs from ethology;\nnamely, that size and gender (i.e., big males) predict social dominance (but see\nLukaszewski and Roney, 2011; Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2009 for a different perspective).\nIn fact, when one includes psychological variables, we found that persistence\n(temperament), cognitive age (as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development),\nand familiarity with the setting predicted dominance well more than physical size.\nMoreover, all things being equal, girls were favored over boys in the preschool years.\nRegarding the second issue, when paired with a child of lower rank, children were\nmore likely to engage with the play material and issue directives (e.g., \"you color here\"),\nand less likely to imitate and passively watch (Hawley and Little, 1999). Children of\nmiddle rank behaved like dominants when paired with children of lower rank, yet deferred\nto and imitated those of higher rank. These relationships were moderated by the degree of\nfamiliarity of the children; the more experience they had with each other, the stronger\neffect of their relative ranks on their respective behavior. All children were under the age\nof 3 (i.e., toddlers), which suggested to us just how basic these abilities and learning\nprocesses are.\nWhat types of behavior in children are associated with resource use? When do they\nemerge and what is their developmental course? One of the key and most controversial\nquestions raised by RCT involves the instrumentality of prosocial behavior. Can prosocial\nbehavior provide self -benefits? To this end, we set up quasi-experimental situations to look\nclosely at what children do to access a highly attractive limited resource (i.e., a novel toy).\nOntogeny and social dominance\nIn the course of filming and coding behavior from multiple dyadic interactions, we\ndocumented that prosocial behaviors (e.g., making helpful suggestions, issuing polite\nrequests, offering \"help\" to commandeer the play material, initiating unequal trades) not\nonly were associated with resource use (r = .53), but were also the most often employed\nstrategy class (at twice the frequency of coercion: taking, aggression, insults, also\nassociated with resource use). Moreover, and critical to the present perspective, both\nstrategies were highly related to each other (r = .67), just as one would expect of behaviors\nsharing common function. Children employing these behaviors effectively controlled our\nresource over 70% of the time. Though not the most popular aspect to our program of\nresearch, we do have good evidence that prosocial behavior can be instrumental across\nmultiple age groups (see, for example, Hawley, 2002 for evidence of its emergence in\npreschool; see also Green, Cillessen, Rechis, Patterson, and Hughes, 2008; Pellegrini,\nAre there mixed strategists? Coercive and prosocial strategies find their analog in\ngame theoretic models under the guise of hawks (escalation) and doves (caution). As with\nmore complex game theoretic models, RCT does not see humans as pure strategists; more\ninteresting to us is a model where \"players\" bring distinct genotypes that are calibrated by\nearly environments, with the modal (life history) pattern being one of a mixed strategy (see\nHawley, 2006 for details). That is, most humans flexibly use both strategies to some\ndegree, the relative employment of which is an important source of individual differences.\nIndeed, in principle, it would be optimal to be a \"mixed strategist.\" Those who are able to\ncooperate and aggress are able to minimize the cost associated with prosociality (e.g.,\nexploitation) by drawing on aggressive behaviors to punish free riders. Machiavelli\nessentially described the mixed strategist on his treatise of political power (Berlin, 1980;\nWith this framework in mind, our program has focused on types of resource\ncontrolling individuals depending on their relative employment of the two strategies. The\ndegree to which an individual employs the strategies can be measured by way of\nobservation (Hawley, 2002), self-report, or other report (Hawley, 2003a,b). We then\ncompare these types across dependent variables of interest to derive qualities associated\nwith the two strategies alone and in combination. Over the last decade (Hawley, 2002;\nHawley and Geldhof, 2012), we (and, more recently, others: e.g., Chen and Chang, 2012;\nRoseth et al., 2011; Olthof, Goossens, Vermande, Aleva, and van der Meulen, 2011) have\ngenerated five subgroups of individuals: bistrategic controllers employ both strategies to a\nhigh degree relative to peers, coercive controllers employ coercive strategies to a high\ndegree, prosocial controllers employ prosocial strategies to a high degree, and non-\ncontrollers are low on both relative to others (i.e., they are not resource directed). Typical\ncontrollers are the largest remaining group and are average on both strategies and as such\nrepresent the modal life history pattern and a baseline for comparison. We know quite a bit\nabout these profiles across multiple age groups, and the profiles have in turn revealed some\ninteresting and counterintuitive (from most views) aspects of aggression and prosociality.\nFor example, prosocial, coercive, and non-controllers possess very distinct profiles\nof socially appealing traits and corresponding social success. Prosocial controllers are\nabove average on resource control (thus reasonably socially dominant), highly socially\nOntogeny and social dominance\nskilled (e.g., socially perceptive, extroverted, morally astute), agreeable, and very well-\nliked by their peers. They know and internalize moral norms, and behave well within them\n(Hawley and Geldhof, 2012). Evolutionists and non-evolutionists alike would agree that\nthese individuals, as a group, are highly socially competent peer leaders. Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, females comprise the majority in this group. In stark contrast, coercive\ncontrollers, while being reasonably high in resource control, fit the stereotypic profile of\nimpulsive, unskilled, and socially repellant aggressors (Hawley, 2003a; Hawley, Johnson,\nMize, and McNamara, 2007). By the age of 5, they are already showing signs of social\nrejection by their peers. Perhaps also not surprising, given the physicality of pure coercion,\nmales comprise the majority in this group. Traditional perspectives have handled these\nchildren well and have identified them as needing ameliorative measures.\nMost informative to our perspective, however, are the individuals who employ both\nstrategies to a high degree. These \"bistrategic\" controllers tend to be the most successful at\nresource control in all age groups. Consistent with our predictions, we have generally found\nbistrategic controllers to possess attributes associated with social skills; i.e., they tend to be\nextroverted, socially perceptive, and morally astute (Hawley, 2002, 2003b; Hawley and\nGeldhof, 2012). But unlike skilled prosocial controllers, they are as a group very high on\ntraditional measures of aggression, and even direct this aggression towards their best\nfriends (Hawley, Little, and Card, 2007). In this regard, they are much like coercive\ncontrollers. Yet, despite their high levels of aggression, and in contrast to expectations from\nmost theoretical perspectives, they demonstrate relationship skills (e.g., intimacy; Hawley,\nLittle, et al., 2007) and are socially attractive to peers (Hawley, 2003a,b; cf. Henrich and\nGil-White, 2001). They understand moral norms well, but they have not internalized them\nin an emotional sense. This combination, unlike prosocial controllers, allows bistrategics to\nmanipulate the moral atmosphere to their own advantage (Alexander, 1987; Hawley and\nGeldhof, 2012). Interestingly, both males and females are well-represented in this group.\nAnd both genders possess skills typically associated with the opposite sex (e.g., males are\nattuned to others whereas females are highly aggressive). Thus, we find bistrategics as\nrather androgynous behaviorally, in the sense that they embrace all human skills and\nstrategies and can employ them flexibly and in ways that garner some degree of group\napproval. They may even enjoy differential reproductive success (Jokela et al., 2009).\nBistrategic controllers contradict views held by the majority that aggression does\nnot pay in the long run because it is associated with social punishment and ostracism. On\nthe contrary, aggression seems to work very well when employed as part of a mixed\nstrategy. The effectiveness and social savvy of the bistrategic struck us to parallel\nMachiavelli's treatise. 9 Thus, we have referred to them as Machiavellian (Hawley, 2003a;\nsee also Baar and Wubbells, 2011; Chen and Chang, 2012; Palmen, Vermande, Dekovi,\nand van Aken, 2011; Roseth et al., 2011). And because they not only meet their material\nneeds more effectively than all other groups, while at the same time also meeting their\n9 To be supported by your people, be \"... merciful, faithful, humane, frank, religious\" but \"preserve a\ndisposition which will make a reversal of conduct possible in case the need arises\" (Machiavelli, 1513/1966,\nOntogeny and social dominance\nsocial needs of power and affiliation, we have argued that their behavior pattern may\nrepresent a type of human social competence (Hawley, 2002; Stump, Ratliff, Wu, and\nIf there are winners, there must be losers\nViews stemming from behavioral ecology suggest that multiple strategies can\nachieve similar average payoffs (i.e., different forms can successfully perform different\nfunctions). Non-controllers, however, should not be seen in this light because their payoffs\ndo not appear to be equal to other groups. Indeed, lack of resource directedness (and by\nextension, total lack of aggression) appears to be a losing strategy. Everything the\nbistrategics are, the non-controllers are not: They are low on resource control, extraversion,\nsocial skills, aggression, social status, and peer regard, and high on anxiety and withdrawal.\nThis \"niche\" is cost-bearing. In fact, non-controlling school children are the gravest clinical\nsignificance (Stump et al., 2009; but see Hawley et al., 2009); they are ostracized and\nvictimized by their peers. Thus, non-controllers confront ideological views to social\ncompetence as well. What does it mean when aggression protects you from failing to\nthrive?\nWhat these profiles reveal about conventional wisdoms\nFirst, prosocial strategies are not altruistic; they reap true benefits for the actor (see\nalso Hardy and van Vugt, 2006; Griskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh, 2010; van Vugt\nand Iredale, 2012). Moreover, participants readily admit that \"being nice\" to others is the\nbest way to ensure that \"others are nice to you.\" That is, not only are these behaviors not\naltruistic in the biological sense, but also not altruistic in the psychological sense.10 The\nself-serving nature of prosocial behavior is mostly keenly understood by prosocial and\nbistrategic controllers, i.e., those who use them frequently and effectively. Indeed, these\nindividuals report high levels of material and social goals, and explicitly understand the\nrelationships among them (Hawley et al., 2009).\nSecond, aggression (i.e., blatantly self-serving strategies) does not unilaterally lead\nto ostracism. Bistrategics clearly show this undeniable fact. You can gain positive peer\nregard (i.e., prestige; Henrich and Gil White, 2001) by wielding power aggressively if you\nalso possess social skills to foresee and smooth over potential repercussions. It is not that\nthe group does not see their aggression, because they clearly do (e.g., Hawley, Johnson, et\nal., 2007). College students simply report that the benefits for associating with someone\nwho can sometimes be a very volatile person outweigh the costs. Bistrategics are fun,\ninnovative, and know how to get things done. On the flip side, being non-aggressive does\nnot win friends. In a sad twist of nature, non-controllers are socially at risk.\nThird, relative competitive ability is less gendered than is commonly thought. When\nallowing for variegated strategies, females do quite well (Hawley, Little, and Card, 2008;\nHrdy, 1981/1999). Form-focused approaches to social dominance would include only\n10 I am not denying the existence of biologically or psychologically altruistic acts. They are simply not\naddressed by this work.\nOntogeny and social dominance\nbistrategic and coercive controllers as power holders; that is, those who were physically\naggressive. Add prosocial controllers to the mix, and the gender representation equalizes.\nWorking RCT into the Theoretical Landscape\nReversing the hierarchy\nThe present view does not explicitly call for leveling mechanisms, or normative\nstrategies that function to equalize the hierarchy (i.e., \"reverse dominance hierarchy\";\nBoehm, 1999) primarily because it does not equate dominance with unbridled aggression.\nThese leveling behaviors (i.e., counter dominant behavior; Boehm, 1993) against bullying\nthat have been ethnographically documented (e.g., gossip, ostracism, or corporal\npunishment) are generally interpreted to mean that humans possess a propensity for\negalitarianism (see also chimps: Boehm and Flack, 2010). However, Boehm himself has\nstressed that this pattern might be expected within some, small, autonomous hunter-\ngatherer groups, but certainly not \"all early human societies.\" Moreover, Boehm explicitly\nadded that \"egalitarianism\" in these model societies does not extend to women and children\nas a rule.\nAside from the obvious narrowness of a male-oriented perspective, it is easy to\nconclude that, if we were \"egalitarian\" in early human groups, then we must be \"naturally\"\negalitarian (or \"inherently moral creatures\"; Gintis, 2012) or, at the very least, intolerant of\nsocial dominants. Work in the RCT paradigm seems to suggest something quite different.\nWhen aggression is mitigated with social skills, we seem to be drawn to it even before the\nage of 3. And why wouldn't we be? The powerful make better friends and alliance partners\nthan the socially subordinate. Exchange theories in social psychology have illuminated\nthese dynamics (e.g., Blau, 1964; Kelley and Thibaut, 1978), and work in developmental\ncircles have documented relationship processes of powerful adolescents (e.g., friends of\npowerful individuals become more powerful themselves over time; Dijkstra, Cillessen,\nLindenberg, and Veenstra, 2010; Marks, Cillessen, and Crick, 2012). These patterns occur\nright under our noses at scientific conferences. That is not to say that currying favor from\nthe powerful is cost-free; powerful individuals are more likely to be aggressive, socially\ninappropriate, and sexually uninhibited than the less powerful (see Keltner, Gruenfeld, and\nAnderson, 2003 for review). In any case, these patterns too appear to be \"natural.\"\n\"Egalitarianism\" may be the exception rather than the rule. And so much the better if one\ncan operate with a \"veneer\" of morality, as aggressively socially dominant preschoolers\nalready do (Hawley and Geldhof, 2012). Both perspectives agree, however, that behavior\npatterns of group members are context specific, and a good deal of the \"context\" is what\nother group members are doing to access limited resources.\nLeadership and prestige\nThe present view overlaps significantly with more recent views on leadership (e.g.,\nvan Vugt et al., 2008) and prestige (e.g., Henrich and Gil White, 2001), even though these\nlines of work hold that these structures are distinct from dominance (indeed, the\n\"antithesis\" of dominance because leadership is proposed to be a solution to intragroup\nconflict caused in part by dominance striving: van Vugt et al., 2008; p 188). Here,\nOntogeny and social dominance\nleadership, with benefits of its own, is viewed as a group resource having evolved in\nresponse to pressures for group coordination and conflict resolution. Again, I believe that\nthe distinction relies on the overly narrow view of social dominance as aggression. As\nmentioned above, it has long been known that socially complex species with protracted\ndevelopments \"work\" their hierarchies with variegated strategies (Byrne and Whiten, 1988;\nare especially complex in humans (e.g., Kyl-Heku and Buss, 1996; Raven and French,\n1958) and undoubtedly include behaviors we would call leadership (Hawley, 1999).\nProsocial strategists, for example, are exceptional at achieving their own goals while\nsimultaneously supporting the goals of others. In the end, it may be necessary to develop\nseparate theories for leadership (a gentler style of command than coercion) in humans and\nsocial dominance in animals. I have made the case elsewhere, however, that it is not\nnecessary or even desirable (Hawley, 1999). In fact, many of the phenomena highlighted by\nthe leadership literature have been documented in rudimentary form in animals (e.g., group\ncoordination, initiating group action, maintaining cohesion, competence recognition,\nconflict management). Moreover, the dominance literature has never found subordinance to\nbe a \"riddle\" as the leadership work has \"followership\" (cf., van Vugt et al., 2008).\nAccordingly, the present view does not hold dominance to be \"the antithesis of leadership\"\n(van Vugt et al., 2008; p 188) because it does not equate dominance with coercive\ndomination, nor does it see coercion as an \"opposite\" to prosociality; instead, RCT holds\nthem to be \"two sides of the same coin\" (Hawley, 2002, p. 175). These bodies of work will\nmost certainly find more points in common than in conflict.\nConclusions\nMany authors have long recognized a dualism inherent to human nature; a tension\nbetween self and other which is insufficiently solved by attending solely to the self or\nsolely to others (e.g., pure psychological egoism or pure self-sacrifice). The present\nevolutionary view sees this tension as a result of competitive processes inherent to natural\nselection giving rise to both antagonistic and other-regarding behavioral strategies.\nDevelopmental processes (e.g., attachment, social learning) are presumed to underlie\nchange over time, driving strategies to higher levels of sophistication and subtlety. By\nbeing mindful of the important distinction between form and function and their\ninterrelationships, and being clear about the difference between psychological and\nevolutionary egoism, we can bring central human social dynamics and hierarchical\nstructures into clearer focus.\nReferences\nAbramovitch, R.
