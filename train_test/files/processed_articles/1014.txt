Current family benefits, which only benefit women who marry, are thought to be outdated and\nunable to protect the neediest women. Thus, would Black and poor women fare better if family benefits were linked to\nparenthood, as opposed to marriage? I examined three care credit proposals that reflect the most common proposals put\nforth in the United States and the most common designs in other countries.\nMethods. I used the 1992 Health and Retirement Study and the Current Population Survey to create a policy\nsimulation that estimates how women reaching age 62 from 2020 to 2030 would be affected by care credits.\nResults. Black and poor women fared best with benefits linked to parenthood. The specific proposal allowed parents,\nfrom the 35 earnings years used to calculate their benefit, to substitute $15,000 for up to 9 earnings' years that fell below\nthis level.\nDiscussion. The poorest women fare better with family benefits linked to parenthood instead of marital status. Moreover,\nthey fare best when working women can benefit from care credits, but the care credit's value is not linked to earnings.\nTHOUGH often seen as a program that benefits workers,\n40% of Social Security beneficiaries are the wives and\nwidows of workers. While Social Security's fiscal problems\nand privatization have dominated the headlines, 25 years of\nresearch has documented that family benefits, which mainly\nbenefit women who get married, stay married, and do no paid\nwork, are outdated (Advisory Council on Social Security, 1979;\nSmeeding, Estes, & Glasse, 1999). Today, few families fit this\nbreadwinner model.\nThe subject of this research is one oft proposed, but little\nstudied, option to reform family benefits: increasing women's\nworker benefits by rewarding them for raising children. Monies\nspent on spousal benefits are diverted to subsidize the cost of\nthese ``care credits.'' Given that benefit adequacy is arguably\nSocial Security's most important goal, I paid close attention to\nhow rewarding parenting, as opposed to marrying, affects race\nand class inequality among women. Policy researchers have\npaid much attention to how an outdated benefit structure affects\nwomen and little attention to how it impacts different groups of\nwomen, despite the fact that poverty rates among Black and\nunmarried women are three times that of White married elderly\nwomen (Smeeding et al., 1999). Benefit adequacy is also\na critical theoretical issue; how policies shape gender, race, and\nclass stratification is the subject of considerable scholarly\ndebate (Esping-Anderson, 1999). And while scholars have\nclosely analyzed how the basis of entitlement for family\nbenefits, be it marriage or parenthood, affects gender inequality,\nthey have paid little attention to how it affects race and class\ninequality among women.\nShould Family Benefits Reward Marriage or\nParenthood? The Theoretical Debate\nA key issue in welfare state research is how the welfare state\nshapes gender, race, and class inequality (Esping-Andersen,\n1999). And the impact of family benefits on inequality has\ncome under increasing scrutiny given the extent to which work\nand family life has changed during the past 30 years (Esping-\nAnderson; Orloff, 1993). One understudied question, however,\nis whether the basis of entitlement for family retirement\nbenefits, be it marriage or parenthood, has differential impacts\non inequality.\nCurrently, the wives and widows of retired workers are\neligible for Social Security benefits. In fact, many industrialized\ncountries give benefits to the spouses and/or widows of workers\n(Thomson & Carasso, 2002). Social Security entitlements\nlinked to marriage ensure that married women, many of whom\nhave worked little and for low earnings, have an adequate\nretirement benefit. Though feminists are nearly universally\nopposed to policies promoting marriage because they encour-\nage women's economic dependence upon men, there is\na feminist rationale for marriage-based benefits. Simply,\nmarried women contribute to men's earnings by taking care\nof all the reproductive labor that is necessary to survive. They\ncook, clean, and even organize their spouses' social lives.\nFeminists have long argued the economic contributions to\nhouseholds that women make in this regard (Secombe, 1974).\nIndeed, married men out earn single men (Loh, 1986). Thus, the\nstate should recognize and reward these contributions. This\nmay explain why feminist organizations, from the National\nOrganization of Women to the Feminist Majority, have never\nchallenged the eligibility link in Social Security between\nmarital status and benefits.\nOthers argue that a better strategy for reducing gender\ninequality is to link family benefits to parenthood. All indus-\ntrialized countries, except the United States, reward parenthood\nthrough their pension systems (Thomson & Carasso, 2002).\nMany argue that children, as opposed to marriage or labor force\ndiscrimination, are the key to understanding gender differences\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nin earnings and ultimately income security in the 21st Century\nwould not subsidize the costs of raising children for all mothers.\nAnd the costs are high. Around 60% of women are not employed\nwhen they have children under a year old (Bachu & O'Connell,\n2000). Women face a high price in foregone wages (Burggraf,\n1998). Contrastingly, men face either no wage penalty or even\nan increase in their wages after having a child (Loh, 1986;\nLundberg & Rose, 2000). Thus, the state should insure against\nthe price of raising children by spreading the cost from\nindividual women to the larger society (Cancian & Oliker,\ngeneral call is the main justification for including care credits\nin Social Security, which would reward women for raising chil-\ndren by supplementing their worker benefit (Crittenden).\nBut while close attention has been paid to how family\nbenefits affect gender inequality, little attention has been paid\nto how they affect race and class inequality among women.\nHowever, as the discussion below will illustrate, linking\nbenefits to parental status, as opposed to marital status, may\nhave different ramifications on race and class inequality\namong women.\nShould Family Benefits Reward Marriage or\nParenthood? The Policy Debate\nAn oft repeated critique of Social Security family benefits\nis that they are outdated because they best benefit women who\nget married, stay married, and do no paid work. Individuals\nreceive contributory benefits as workers or noncontributory\nfamily benefits as the spouses and survivors of workers. Con-\ntributory worker benefits are based on an individual's highest\n35 earnings years. Noncontributory family benefits have no\nrelationship to the recipient's work history. Around 98% of\nnoncontributory family benefit recipients are women (Harring-\nton Meyer, 1996). A wife's spousal benefit is worth half of her\nhusband's worker benefit, while the survivor receives 100% of\nher late husband's original worker benefit. A divorced woman\ncan receive spousal and survivor benefits if she was married for\nat least 10 years. Women eligible for both worker and spousal\nbenefits receive the higher of the two.\nThe problem, policy activists and scholars emphasize, is that\nit is increasingly unlikely that women will get married, stay\ncentage of women married dropped from 60% to 52%, while the\npercentage of women divorced more than doubled, from 6% to\ncentage of married mothers in the workforce rose from 28% to\nearning enough to justify simply eliminating marital benefits.\nWomen's average annual earnings are around just 60% of men's.\nThough most of the discussion about outdated family\nbenefits has focused on how this will impact women, an\noutdated benefit design is particularly problematic for Black\nand poor women. Black and poor women are twice as likely to\nnever marry as are White and wealthier women (Goldstein &\nKenney, 2001). Those who do not marry cannot qualify for\nthese benefits. Moreover, Black women have consistently been\nBlack women worked compared to 28% of White women\nclosed (Council of Economic Advisors, 1998). Contributions\nworkers make through payroll taxes subsidize noncontribu-\ntory family benefits. Thus, working Black women have been\nsubsidizing White women receiving spousal and widow\nbenefits. Moreover, for married women, the higher her spouse's\nincome the less likely she is to go back to work after having\na child (Barrow, 1999). Thus, the way the system is currently\ndesigned, a single woman working in a low-wage job all\nthroughout her life will likely end up with a lower benefit than\na woman who has never been employed but is married to\nBut others argue that Black and poor women have fared quite\nwell in the current system. The poverty rate among African\nAmericans would be twice as high if individuals had no Social\nSecurity income (Porter, Larin, & Primus, 1999). Further, for\nthose in the bottom two fifths of the income distribution, Social\nSecurity comprises 80% of their income compared to 18% for\nthose in the top fifth (Porter et al.). This income is critical to\ntheir economic well-being. Thus, while there are problems with\nmarital status benefits for Black and poor women, would\nthey fare better with care credits? To answer this question, I\nevaluated three different care credit proposals, which are out-\nlined in the following section.\nCare Credit Proposals\nThe care credit proposals reflect the varying designs\nemployed in other countries but also resemble specific\nproposals that have been put forth in the United States. Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom all link retirement family\nbenefits to parenthood. Two factors determine the design of\ncare credits in these countries: eligibility (Should working\nparents have their retirement benefits supplemented or should\nonly those who leave employment be compensated? For\nexample, France only credits mothers who have years of no\nearnings, while Norway credits mothers with years of low\nearnings.); and how the care credit is valued (Countries employ\ntwo different approaches. One is to compensate women based\nupon their lost earnings. A lawyer receives a higher credit than\na secretary. Alternately, the care work is valued independently.\nThe lawyer and the secretary receive the same compensation.).\nThus, I analyzed three care credit proposals that reward\nparents for raising children. The proposals not only represent\napproaches common in other countries, they also represent the\nmost common proposals in the United States put forth to date.\nTheir shared trait is the elimination of spousal benefits, which\nrequire no employment history. Thus, they all require an\nearnings' history for eligibility, unlike spousal benefits. Those\nresources then offset the costs of care credits, which do require\nan employment history. The differences between the proposals\ncenter on who is eligible and how the credit is valued. Are\nparents who work eligible? Is the care credit's value determined\nindependently or based on prior earnings?\nDrop zeros. --Parents can drop up to 9 no earnings years (up\nto 5 for one child and up to 9 for more than one child) from the\n35 used to calculate their benefits (Advisory Council on Social\ninated. Only parents who fully exit paid labor can benefit.\nThe credit's value is based on earnings during years they\nwere employed.\nSubstitute. --Parents could substitute up to 9 years of\nearnings (up to 5 for one child and up to 9 for more than one\nchild) with half of the median wage (Gore, 2000). This is the\nmedian wage for those 15 years or older working full time,\nreceive the credit, but they must have relatively low earnings.\nObviously, the value of the care credit is independent of\nearnings.\nDrop Low earnings. --The Drop Low proposal, like the\nSubstitute proposal, will also benefit parents whether they do or\ndo not stay employed. But, unlike the Substitute proposal, it\nputs no limits on how much they work. Parents can drop 5 (for\none child) to 9 (for those with more than one child) of their\nlowest earnings years within the 35 used to calculate their\nworker benefit (Crittenden, 2001). The value of the credit is\nthen linked to earnings.\nNone of these proposals require that care credits be\nspecifically tied to years where children are young. The\nrationale behind this is that the burdens of childrearing vary\nsignificantly between individuals. For many, time off is needed\nwhen children are very young. For others, behavioral problems\nin the teen years require more time at home for supervision.\nStudy Overview\nI used the 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the\n2000 Current Population Survey (CPS) to create a policy\nsimulation that estimates how women reaching age 62 from\ndifferent care credit proposals, all of which entail the\nelimination of spousal noncontributory benefits. I examined\nhow each proposal changes the overall distribution of non-\ncontributory family benefits or the benefits not based on the\nindividuals' earnings. For example, do women in low-asset\nhouseholds, as a group, receive a greater proportion of family\nnoncontributory benefits under current rules or under the care\ncredit reforms? I focused further analyses on how women's\ntotal individual Social Security benefits change. In particular,\nwhich groups of women are most likely to get benefit increases\nand decreases, and what are the sizes of those increases\nand decreases?\nData\nThe HRS is a longitudinal study of individuals born be-\n1992, is conducted every other year. It includes data on demo-\ngraphics, physical health, housing, family structure, current\nand past employment, retirement plans, income, and insurance.\nIt is the most extensive data collection of a nationally\nrepresentative cohort of older people (Mitchell, Hammond, &\nThe initial sample in Wave 1 of the HRS was 5,426. Of\nthese, 3,971 women consented to the use of their Social\nSecurity records, which are essential to calculate Social\nSecurity benefits. Another 544 married women were excluded\nbecause their spouses' lacked earnings' records, leaving\na sample of 3,427 women. Weight was utilized to adjust\nmissing observations.\nAny analysis of Social Security family benefits must be\nbased on couple data. Evaluations that do not use couple data\nare inaccurate because individuals can draw auxiliary benefits\noff of their spouse's or ex-spouse's earnings history. The HRS,\nwith attached Social Security earnings data, is the most\ncomplete data currently available. Yet, there are two problems\nin using the HRS to construct Social Security benefits: missing\ninformation on husbands for formerly married women and\nmissing earnings years up to age 62 because individuals in the\nsample are ages 51 to 61. The latter problem was more easily\nsolved. Waves 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the HRS filled in most of the\nmissing earnings years while the rest were imputed based on\nthe approach Mitchell and colleagues (2000) used to create\na predicted wealth file for the HRS.\nThe more difficult issue was missing earnings records for the\nformer spouses of current women beneficiaries who had been\ndivorced or widowed. To address this, I employed multiple\nimputation (Rubin, 1987). I imputed earnings histories, for\n583 women, from randomly selected male records with similar\ncharacteristics to the women. Divorced women who had never\nhad a marriage that lasted at least 10 years and presently\nwidowed women receiving survivor benefits did not need\nimputed earnings records. While error was introduced into this\nanalysis by imputations, there is no other data that provides\nmore complete information. The Social Security Administration\nuses the same approach to conduct policy analyses. Multiple\nimputation allowed for the adjustment of coefficients and\nstandard errors to reflect the introduced error.\nThe last stage of data preparation entailed a demographic\nwould look like at age 62. The purpose of this nonparametric\nprojection was to see how a younger cohort of women, with\ndifferent demographic characteristics, would be affected by the\nproposals. The premise of the simulation was that the 1931\u00ad\n1941 cohort in the HRS included women with employment and\nthe proportion of different groups of women varied. For\nexample, there were divorced women in the HRS cohort, but\nthere were a greater number of divorced women in the 1960\u00ad\nweights that adjust the HRS cohort of women to resemble the\nHRS allowed for the reconstruction of these women's\ncharacteristics between the ages of 30 and 40, which was the\nwas a simplified projection, the results were similar to more\ncomplicated and expensive simulations, such as the MINT\nmodel created by the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute,\nand the Social Security Administration. For more informa-\ntion on all of these data adjustments and imputations see\nVariables\nThe dependent variable represented the effect of the policy\nchange from the present structure, which included spousal\nbenefits, to one of the proposed three care credit options\nincluding dropping zero earnings years (Drop Zeros), substitut-\ning years with half of the median wage (Substitute), or dropping\nHERD\nlow earnings years (Drop Low). This dependent variable was\ncontinuous, with both positive values (for ``gainers'') and\nnegative values (for ``losers''), but with a substantial number of\nzeros (for those benefits left unchanged by the alternative\npolicies).\nTable 1 provides the means and distributions for the\ncovariates. They included demographic, family status, socio-\neconomic, and work history variables. Year of birth and race\nwee the two primary demographic variables. Race was a dummy\nvariable, with White women as the reference. The sample was\nnot large enough to allow for separate analyses of Black and\nHispanic women.\nSocioeconomic variables included education, assets (liquid\nand nonliquid), and benefit under the current Social Security\nrules. The reference for education was women with a high\nschool degree compared to those without one and those with\na college degree or more. The asset and previous benefit\nvariables reflected women's economic resources. They were\ndivided into quartiles with the highest quartile as the reference.\nThe asset variable accounted for a spouse's influence on an\nindividual's socioeconomic and financial status. The benefit\nunder the current program structure identified whether benefits\nwere redistributed upwards or downwards.\nFamily status variables included whether women have\nchildren or not; those with children were the reference. I kept\nthis as a simple dummy because I wanted to know how women\nwith children, versus those without children, fared. Additional\nanalyses that included dummies for the number of children did\nnot meaningfully alter the findings. Coded as a dummy, the\nreference category for marital status was married women,\ncompared to divorced, widowed, and never married women.\nThe work history variables addressed how the number and\ntiming of zero earnings years affected who benefits under the\ncare credit proposals. One set of dummy variables represented\nthe number of zero earnings years out of 30 years of earnings\n26\u00ad30. In order to account for the timing of those zero earnings\nyears, another variable addressed whether zero earnings years\noccurred in a woman's 20, 30s, or 40s. The reference category\nwas women who had zero earnings in all three decades (named\n111). Other categories include women who had no zero\nearnings years in any of those decades (000), zero earnings only\nearnings only in their 30s (010), and zero earnings in their\nMETHODS\nThe Three-Equation Model\nWhile descriptive analyses will provide a significant level of\ninformation, regression analyses will isolate the key correlates\nassociated with who would win and lose under of each of the\ncare credit reforms, as well as the extent to which benefits\nwould rise or fall for those whose benefits changed. The\nbaseline for comparison was the respondents' present benefit.\nUnder each proposal, each recipient's current benefit may be\ndecreased, left unchanged, or raised. The extent of any such\nchange can be measured in dollar terms. There will be a large\nnumber of beneficiaries with no benefit change, thus creating\nzeros. Therefore, I used an altered model from the two-part\nmodel, the three-equation model, to investigate correlates of\nbenefit changes under each reform proposal (Manning, New-\nhouse, Duan, & Leibowitz, 1987). The first part of the two-part\nmodel captured the probability of having a benefit change.\nThe second part captured the size of that change.\nThe first equation (first part) in the model was an ordered\nprobit where covariates included demographic, socioeconomic,\nfamily status, and work history individual characteristics. The\ndependent variable was ordinal with categories corresponding\nto a decrease in benefit (y\u00bc0), no change in benefit (y\u00bc1), and\nan increase in benefit (y \u00bc 2). The second equation (second\npart) was a linear regression of individuals' increases in benefits\ngiven that they were in the increase category in the first\nequation. The third equation (second part) was a linear\nregression of individuals' decreases in benefits among those\nexperiencing a decrease. The dependent variable in the latter\ntwo equations was the natural log of the benefit change.\nRESULTS\nOverall Change in Benefit Distribution\nTable 2 overviews the policy proposals. All of the results\nreflected outcomes for women reaching age 62 between\nnoncontributory benefits will go to poor versus wealthy women\nand Black versus White women under care credits as compared to\nthe current rules. The outcome measure was a fraction where the\nTable 1. Means and Distributions for Major Variables, 2020\nRace\nEducational status\n! Bachelor's degree 28\nMarital status\nChildren\nNo earnings years\nTiming of zero earning years\nProjected monthly benefit $850\ndenominator was the sum (in dollars) of noncontributory family\nbenefits overall, and the numerator was the sum (in dollars) of\nnoncontributory family benefits received by different groups of\nwomen. Noncontributory benefits supplemented the individual's\nworker benefit; they equaled the worker benefit subtracted from\nthe family benefit (be it care credits or spousal benefits).\nOverall, Figures 1 and 2 show that each of the care credit\nproposals helps reduce class and race inequality, as compared\nto spousal benefits, in the distribution of noncontributory family\nbenefits. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the overall sum of\nmoney spent on noncontributory spousal benefits, by household\nasset level, under current rules. Women in the bottom asset\nquartile received just 17% of these benefits. Current spousal\nfamily benefits were preferential to women in wealthy house-\nholds. How do the care credit proposals change the distribution\nof family benefits? The percent of benefits women in the lowest\nasset quartile received rose to 28% under Drop Zeros, 26%\nunder Substitute and 25% under Drop Low. Linking benefits to\ncare and employment was more beneficial for poor women than\nbenefits linked to marriage.\nFigure 2 presents the distribution of noncontributory family\nbenefits by race. Black women comprised about 11% of the\nsample. With current spousal benefits, they received just 7%\nof the total sum of family benefits. All three proposals\nsignificantly improved the racial inequality built into the\ncurrent system of family benefits. Drop Zeros, Substitute and\nDrop Low raised the proportion of noncontributory family\nrespectively. These proposals were more advantageous for\nBlack women because these benefits were more tightly linked\nto employment than spousal benefits. Black women have\ngenerally worked more than White women. Moreover, given\nTable 2. Proposals to Reform Social  \nPolicy Who is Eligible? How is the Credit Valued?

Overall, the\nmost women benefited from Substitute and Drop Low, while\nBlack, poor, and unmarried women fared best under Substitute\nfollowed by Drop Low.\nTable 3 displays percentages of individuals receiving benefit\nincreases and decreases and the size of those increases and\ndecreases. While just 27% of women received benefit increases\nunder the Drop Zeros proposal, close to half of women received\nbenefit increases under the Substitute and Drop Low proposals.\nThis signals that most women in this cohort were work-\ning enough that only providing credits to women who entirely\nleft employment for periods of time was not as advantageous\nto as many women as also providing credits to women who\nhad more extensive employment histories. Average benefit in-\ncreases were slightly more than 10% for all three proposals.\nIn terms of the distribution of benefit increases, Black,\nunmarried, and poor women fared best under the Substitute,\nDrop Low, and Drop Zeros proposals, respectively. Compared\nto 44% of White women, 51% of Black women received benefit\nincreases under the Substitute proposal, compared to 47% and\nDrop Zeros proposal. The average size of Black women's\nbenefit increase was 15% for Substitute and 11% for Drop Low\nand Drop Zeros. White women's average benefit increases were\n10%, 12%, and l0% for Substitute, Drop Low, and Drop Zeros,\nrespectively. More Black women benefited from Substitute\nand Drop Low because, in part, they had higher labor force\nparticipation than did White women. But Black women had the\nhighest benefit increases from the Substitute proposal because it\nwas the only proposal that did not tie the value of the credit to\nearnings. Black women had lower earnings than did White\nwomen. Thus, for Black women, proposals that rewarded them\nfor childrearing even when they were employed were most\nadvantageous due to their significant employment histories. But\npolicies that linked the value of the credit to their earnings were\nproblematic because of their relatively low earnings compared\nto White working women.\nUnmarried women clearly fared better than married women\nunder all of these proposals but fared best under Substitute and\nDrop Low. Almost double the percentages of divorced women\nreceived increases under the Substitute and Drop Low pro-\nposals compared to the Drop Zeros proposal. Among never\nmarried women 16% and 20% received increases under the\nSubstitute and Drop Low, respectively, compared to 9% under\nDrop Zeros. More than one half (for Substitute and Drop\nLow) and one third (for Drop Zeros) of married women had\nbenefit increases.\nThe size of those benefit increases was highest under\nSubstitute compared to the other two proposals. Benefit\nimprovements for divorced women were similar, around 10%\nfor all three proposals. Never married women, however, had an\naverage benefit improvement of 28% for Substitute, compared\nto 9% and 14% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros, respectively.\nUnmarried women, perhaps because this group was comprised\ndisproportionately of Black women, fared best with policies\nthat rewarded their childrearing, even if they were employed,\nFigure 2. Distribution of noncontributory benefits by race under current rules and care credit proposals.\nand with policies that did not tie the value of the care credit\nto earnings.\nWomen in the bottom household asset quartile also fared best\nunder the Substitute proposal. Compared to 43% of these\nwomen under Drop Low and 25% of these women under Drop\nZeros, 46% received a benefit increase under Substitute.\nMoreover, under both the Drop Low and Drop Zeros proposals,\nhigher percentages of women in the top asset households\nreceived benefit increases than in the bottom asset households.\nThis was not the case with the Substitute proposal. Women in\nthe lowest asset households had the highest benefits increases\nunder Substitute at 17%, compared to 12% for Drop Low and\n11% for Drop Zeros. Clearly, it was important for women in\nlow-asset households that the value of the credit be determined\nindependent from their earnings but also that they were not\npenalized for combing employment with childrearing.\nBenefit Changes: Benefit Decreases\nThese benefit changes also led to benefit cuts for some\nwomen compared to their benefits under current rules. Overall,\nfor those who received benefit cuts, the Substitute proposal did\nthe least damage, followed by Drop Low, then Drop Zeroes.\nBecause the value of Substitute was not linked to earnings, even\nthose with meager earnings histories received a more generous\nbenefit than under the other proposals, which did connect the\nvalue of the credit to earnings. Around one fifth of women\nreceived benefit decreases relative to their original benefit under\nthese reforms. Black women, compared to White women, faced\nthe fewest cuts under all of the proposals but fared best under\nSubstitute. Just 12% of Black women had a benefit decrease of\nabout 29% under Substitute. Contrastingly, about 13% of Black\nwomen received more than a 50% benefit reduction under Drop\nLow and Drop Zeros. Between 22% and 26% of White women\nhad benefit decreases ranging between 30% for Substitute and\n53% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros.\nBoth unmarried and married women fared better under\nSubstitute than the other two proposals. Because it was the\nelimination of spousal benefits that led to benefit reductions,\ncuts were concentrated among eligible married and divorced\nwomen. Never married and widowed women did not receive\nreductions. Divorced women clearly fared best under Substitute\nwhere 14% received a 32% benefit reduction. Comparatively,\nunder Drop Low and Drop Zeros. The benefit cut for about one\nthird of married women was 30% under Substitute compared to\nmore than 50% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros.\nFinally, women in low-asset households fared best, in terms\nof benefit cuts, with Substitute as compared to Drop Low and\nDrop Zeros, though benefit cuts were more concentrated in\nhigh-asset households under all of the proposals. For 15% to\n19% of women in low-asset households, the size of the\nreduction was 30% for Substitute compared to more than 50%\nfor the other two proposals. This finding is of concern given\nthat this is an economically vulnerable group. Ideally, policy-\nmakers would include provisions that would offset benefit\ndecreases for this group with a policy change.\nBenefit Changes: Replacement Rates\nGiven that the large majority of benefit cuts were\nconcentrated among married women, benefit replacement rates\nin Table 4 give a clearer perspective on how these benefit\nchanges affect married couples. Replacement rates, which are\ncommonly used to examine the progressivity of any Social\nSecurity reform, are the monthly benefit divided by monthly\naverage lifetime earnings or the percentage of average monthly\nlifetime earnings the Social Security benefit is replacing.\nSubstitute, with a replacement rate of 81% for married couple\nhouseholds with lifetime earnings in the bottom quartile, was\nclearly the most progressive option. Under current rules, the\npresent replacement rate was 68% for this group. Drop Low and\nTable 3.

The replacement rate for married\ncouple households in the bottom quartile was 60%, which was\na reduction from 68% under current rules. Again, this result\nreflects the fact that the value of the credit is not linked to\nearnings, which is beneficial for low earning individuals.\nBenefit Changes: Regression Analyses\nWhile the previous descriptive analyses are critical to any\npolicy evaluation intended to understand how subgroups fare,\nTables 3 and 4 do not control for more than one background\nfactor at a time. Regression analyses clarify how very precise\ngroups of women fare (by controlling for multiple individual\ncharacteristics) under each of the proposals.\nThe results from Table 5, 6, and 7 emphasize that those who\nhad lower benefits under current rules and those with fewer\nyears of zero earnings were most likely to benefit and the least\nlikely to lose from Substitute, Drop Low, and Drop Zeroes\nrespectively. These two variables were the strongest predictors\nof benefit gainers and losers with the switch to care credits, and\nthe discussion that follows centers on these variables.\nIn terms of benefit progressiveness, Table 5 shows that only\nunder Substitute did those with higher benefits under current\nrules have significantly lower probabilities, than those with\nlower benefits, of receiving benefit increases. Asset variables\nwere not significantly predictive. Across all credit proposals,\nthose with college educations were more likely to receive\nbenefit increases than those with high school degrees, reflecting\nthe strong link between work, education, and care credits,\nwhich had a greater link to lifetime earnings than did spousal\nbenefits. In terms of work history, women with fewer years of\nzero earnings were more likely to benefit under all the\nproposals. The one exception was under Drop Zeros. Those\nwith 6 to 15 years of zero earnings were more likely to benefit\nthan those with 0 to 5 years. This reflects the design of the\nproposal, which only benefits women who have zero earnings.\nThe ordered probit estimates in Table 5 are not intuitively\ninterpretable, thus Table 6 presents predicted probabilities\nbased on the ordered probit estimates. Given that married\nwomen were the ones most likely to lose under these proposals,\nTable 6 focuses specifically on them.\nCompared to the other two proposals, the Substitute proposal\nbest balanced benefiting mothers who remained employed\nTable 4.

Under Drop Zero, they\nhad just a 26% probability of benefit gain and a 35% probability\nof benefit loss. Those with many zero earnings had a 25%,\n15%, and 7% probability of benefit gain under Substitute, Drop\nLow, and Drop Zero, respectively. Their probabilities for\nbenefit cuts were around 70% for Drop Zero and Drop Low and\nWomen with lower benefits under current rules, compared to\nwomen with higher benefits, fared best under the Substitute\nproposal compared to the Drop Zeros and Drop Low proposals.\nNeither Drop Zero nor Drop Low had meaningful differences in\ntheir impacts on benefit increases and decreases among women\nmarried mothers would lose while around 41% and 60%, under\nDrop Zero and Drop Low, respectively, would gain. Under\nSubstitute a married mother with a $500 benefit under current\nrules would have an 84% probability of gain and a 6% probability\nof loss. Those with a $1,000 current rule benefit would have\na 69% probability of gain and 14% probability of loss.\nFinally, how did different groups of women fare in terms of\nthe size of their benefit increases and decreases, holding\nconstant demographic factors? Table 7 presents the OLS results\nfor those receiving benefit increases and benefit decreases. In\nterms of progressiveness, previous benefit size was the factor\nmost strongly related to the size of benefit increases and\ndecreases. The Substitute proposal was the most progressive of\nthe three proposals: the higher an individual's original benefit,\nthe smaller the increase and the higher the decrease under the\nreform. Contrastingly, under the Drop Low and Drop Zeros\nproposals an individual with higher current benefits ended up\nwith a higher benefit increase. Household assets, contrastingly,\nwere not significantly predictive of the size of benefit change.\nTable 7 also shows that among women with benefit increases\nand among those who worked, those who worked the least\ngained the most from the Drop Zeros proposal. Compared to\nwomen with less than 6 zero earnings years in their\nemployment history, the benefit increase for a women with\nZeros compared to 50% and 28% under Substitute and Drop\nLow, respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nFor more than 20 years policy advocates and policymakers\nhave argued for the implementation of care credits in Social\nSecurity. The United States stands out as the only western\nindustrialized country that does not reward care within its state\npension system. The results from this study clarify how\nimplementing care credits would change the distribution of\nbenefits among women beneficiaries reaching age 62 between\nPolicy researchers and welfare state theorists have failed to\nconsider how the basis of entitlement for family benefits, be it\nmarriage or parenthood, affects race and class inequality among\nwomen. The results from this study show that linking family\nbenefits to parenthood, as opposed to marriage, is most\nadvantageous for poor and Black women. These women fared\nbetter both because they were less likely to be married but also\nmore likely to have been employed. Care credits supplement\nthe worker benefit, while spousal benefits have no link to\nwomen's earnings. Inequality among women is lessened when\ntheir benefits are based on their own work, be it in the work-\nplace or raising children, as opposed to their spouses' work.\nIn terms of the practical policy implications, while all the\nproposals are more progressive than spousal benefits, the\nSubstitute proposal is clearly the most progressive. Black and\npoor women fare best with the Substitute and Drop Low\nproposals, respectively. Both proposals allow mothers to\nbenefit from combining their childrearing with employment,\nbut the Substitute proposal values the care credit independently\nof women's earnings, while the Drop Low proposal values the\ncare credit based on beneficiaries' earnings. The Drop Zeros\nproposal, though the most often proposed plan, benefits half as\nmany women as do the Substitute and Drop Low proposals.\nRequiring full exits from employment to receive the credit,\nwhile simultaneously valuing that credit based on years where\nthere are earnings, is a problematic mix for most women. While\nDrop Zero and Drop Low are marginally more progressive than\nspousal benefits, they are highly questionable solutions to the\nproblem given their drawbacks.\nOne large negative outcome to these proposals, however, is\nthe following: Resources are redistributed without increasing\nthat pool of resources; thus, some are worse off under the new\nrules. The Substitute proposal, in particular, evens the playing\nfield among mothers. The old rules favored married (and\nformerly married) mothers who were rarely employed (often\nWhite and wealthier women) at the expense of single mothers\nwho worked (often poor and Black women). Nonetheless, while\n45% of women would fare better under the new rules (the\nSubstitute proposal) as compared to the old, 30% would fare\nworse. But declaring those changes should not be made because\nsome will end up worse off than before condemns the state to\nperpetually reinforcing existing inequality.\n"
