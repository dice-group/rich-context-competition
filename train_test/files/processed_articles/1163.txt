Because arthritis\ncontributes to an increased physical burden on staff and\ndecreased functional capability of residents, both staff and\nresidents can benefit from better diagnosis, intervention, and\neducation.\nAn estimated 70 million American adults had arthritis or\nchronic joint symptoms in 2001,1 and the number of\npeople over age 65 with arthritis is expected to double\nby 2030.2 The prevalence and impact of arthritis in nursing\nhomes is not well characterised. The purpose of this study is\nto determine the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of\npeople with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions in the\nnursing home population.\nMETHODS\nData were obtained from the 1997 National Nursing Home\nSurvey. A two stage probability sample of 1488 nursing\nhomes was selected from a list of 17 900 nursing homes\nrepresenting all US nursing home residents 3; 1406 homes\n(94%) participated in the survey. The survey consisted of\nthree questionnaires: a facility questionnaire, a current\nresident questionnaire, and a discharged resident question-\nnaire. Data from the current resident questionnaire were\nused in this study. During an onsite visit, an interviewer and\nthe facility administrator (or designee) created a sampling\nlist of all current residents and six residents were randomly\nselected from the list, resulting in a total sample of 8138\nresidents.\nDetailed information on each resident (demographic\ncharacteristics at admission, date of admission, source of\npayment currently and at time of admission, current\nfunctional status, and the primary and up to five other\ndiagnoses at admission) was obtained through interview\nwith the nursing staff provider most knowledgeable\nabout the resident's care. No residents were directly inter-\nviewed.\nCurrent residents with arthritis were identified by a\nstandard set of International Classification of Disease, 9th\nrevision\u00adClinical Modification (ICD9-CM) diagnostic codes\ndeveloped by the National Arthritis Data Workgroup4 to\nrepresent a wide variety of arthritis and other rheumatic\nconditions.\nAge was obtained either directly from the resident's chart\nor calculated by subtracting the resident's year of birth from\nthe year of admission. Race/ethnicity was categorised as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other. Other\ncharacteristics included sex, the Metropolitan Statistical\nArea (urban v rural) of the sampled facility and the level of\ncare received (skilled, intermediate, or residential).\nFunctional characteristics included participation in physical\nor occupational therapy, use of a wheelchair, use of a walking\naid (including a walker, cane, or crutches), and the need for\nassistance in each of five activities of daily living (bathing,\ndressing, eating, walking, and transferring).\nThree arthritis diagnostic subsets of this population were\ndefined: residents with primary (first listed) arthritis\ndiagnosis, residents with any arthritis diagnosis (any of six\ndiagnosis fields), and residents with no arthritis diagnosis at\nadmission. Estimates of each characteristic were obtained by\nweighting eligible records to represent all nursing home\nresidents by using the inverse of the probability of selection\nadjusted for non-response, and over- or undersampling to\ndetermine statistical weights.\nActual sample numbers, as well as estimated population\nnumbers and percentages, were calculated for each descrip-\ntive characteristic. Confidence intervals (95% CI) for the\npercentages were calculated with use of relative standard\nerrors derived from published coefficients.3 An estimate was\nconsidered unreliable and therefore not reported if the\nsample size was less than 30. An estimate is considered\npotentially unreliable and flagged if the sample size is\nthe relative standard error is greater than 30%.3\nRESULTS\nresidents. At admission, 43 000 (,3%) of these residents had\narthritis diagnosis, and 1.3 million had no arthritis diagnosis.\nCharacteristics varied among the three diagnostic subsets\n(table 1). Women constituted 86% of residents with a\nprimary arthritis diagnosis at admission, 81% of those with\nany arthritis diagnosis, but only 70% of those with no\narthritis diagnosis. Similarly, residents aged 85 years and\nAbbreviations: NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; OT,\noccupational therapist; PT, physical therapist\nwww.annrheumdis.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://ard.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nolder and non-Hispanic whites represented a greater percen-\ntage of those with a primary or any arthritis diagnosis than of\nthose with no arthritis diagnosis. Level of care was similar in\nall three diagnosis subsets.\nA significantly higher percentage of residents with a\nprimary arthritis diagnosis received physical and/or occupa-\ntional therapy than in the other groups (fig 1). Those with\nprimary or any arthritis diagnosis used wheelchairs and\nespecially walking aids more than those with no arthritis.\nFor activities of daily living, those with primary or any\narthritis diagnosis at admission needed assistance with\nwalking and transferring more often than those with no\narthritis diagnosis at admission, but they required less\nassistance with eating.\nTable 1 Distribution of demographic characteristics among nursing home residents, by\narthritis diagnostic subset, US, 1997 National Nursing Home Survey\nResident characteristics\nPrimary arthritis\nAny arthritis diagnosis\nNo arthritis diagnosis\nSex\nAge (years)\nRace\nMetropolitan Statistical Area\nLevel of care\n*Figure does not meet standard of reliability or precision because sample size is less than 30 and, therefore, is not\nreported.

Firstly, there may be overreporting in the\ngeneral population, but multiple surveys have found a similar\nor greater prevalence of arthritis. Secondly, there may be\nunderreporting of arthritis in nursing homes. Prete and\nPhan found that musculoskeletal disease was more pre-\nvalent when determined from a complete musculoskeletal\nexamination by a rheumatologist than from examination by\na primary care giver or from self report, with mild to\nmoderate disease not being recognised.6 They also found that\nvery old people may underreport their musculoskeletal\ncomplaints even with direct aggressive inquiry, possibly\nbecause they believe that aches and pains are a normal part\nof aging or because they are so used to accommodating their\ndisease that they no longer recognise it as a hindrance.\nThirdly, the low rate of arthritis may be real, perhaps because\narthritis has a protective effect on nursing home admissions.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are\ncommonly used to treat arthritis, have been found to a have\nsignificant inverse relationship with Alzheimer's disease.7\u00ad9\nBecause Alzheimer's disease is a common reason for nursing\nhome admissions, people with arthritis who take NSAIDs\nmay be less likely to be admitted to nursing homes for this\ncondition.\nResidents with diagnosed arthritis, particularly those\nwith decreased mobility, have an increased impact on\nnursing home staff because they require more assistance\nwith ambulation and daily tasks. Residents with undiag-\nnosed arthritis may be placing similar but unrecognised\nphysical demands on staff. For the residents with either\ndiagnosed or undiagnosed arthritis, reduced mobility results\nin decreased muscle strength and poor cardiorespiratory\nfunction. Consequently, more falls and injuries may occur as\nwell as increased morbidity due to diseases related to\ninactivity such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some\nAlthough more residents with diagnosed arthritis receive\nphysical/occupational therapy than those without arthritis,\nthe relatively low rate of these effective interventions may\nrepresent a missed opportunity.11\u00ad13 Przybylski et al conducted\na randomised controlled programme evaluation that looked\nat the effect of increasing the number of full time physical\ntherapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs) per bed in\nnursing homes.13 They found that not only was one PT/OT per\n50 beds more effective at promoting, maintaining, or limiting\ndecline in functional status than was one PT/OT per 200 beds\nbut also that the 1:50 group required less care giver\ninvolvement and less overall care delivery resources than\nthe 1:200 group, resulting in a net benefit even when the\ncosts for PT/OT were included. Prevention of disability, or\nlimiting the progression of disability, can have a profound\nimpact on not only the individual person's quality of life but\nalso on the workload of nursing home staff, the economic\nstructure of the facility, and the economics of the healthcare\nindustry.\nThis study has at least three possible limitations. Firstly,\nnursing home residents with arthritis may be overlooked\nbecause the National Nursing Home Survey collects informa-\ntion on only six admission diagnoses, and arthritis may be\n``bumped'' off that list for people with seven or more\nconditions. However, the probability of this happening is\nprobably minimal because only 29% of sampled residents had\nall six slots for admission diagnoses filled. Secondly, some\nresidents with a primary arthritis diagnosis might have been\nadmitted temporarily after joint replacement surgery and\nthus would not represent a long term nursing home problem,\nbut we lacked data to determine this. Thirdly, the survey\ninformation may be incomplete because the reporting\nnursing staff provider who knows the resident best may\nnot know the selected resident very well or, in the absence of\nmedical record documentation, may not recall some details of\nthe resident's care because of the number of patients in his or\nher charge. The primary strength of this study is that it is a\nlarge, nationally representative sample that fills a gap in our\nknowledge of arthritis epidemiology and provides a profile of\ndiagnosed arthritis in residents that might direct future\nnursing home research.\nArthritis is a large and probably underrecognised problem\nin nursing homes. People diagnosed with arthritis place\ngreater physical demands on nursing home staff, and\nundiagnosed arthritis is probably adding to that burden.\nStaff and residents both may benefit from greater\nphysical and occupational therapy to prevent progression.\nIn addition, other non-pharmacological interventions,\nsuch as self management education (Arthritis Self-Help\nCourse) and physical activity programmes (``People\nwith Arthritis Can Exercise'' and the ``Arthritis Foundation\nAquatics Program''), are effective at reducing pain,\nimproving function, and decreasing the risk of disability14\nin the general population and may help in nursing homes as\nwell.\n"
