Patients were included if they\nhad been treated between January 1997 and December 2015 at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology\nHospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Relevant demographic and clinical data were\nretrieved from the medical records.\nResults: Forty-three patients were included in the study; 14 underwent ovarian cystectomy\n(group 1) and 29 underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO; group 2). Three of the\npatients who underwent USO relapsed and required a second surgical intervention. The 5-year\ndisease-free survival rates were 100% and 88%for groups 1 and 2, respectively. There were no\nsignificant differences between the two groups in terms of survival or postoperative fertility\noutcomes. Univariate and multivariate analysis further revealed that ovarian cystectomy was not a\npoor prognostic indicator for disease-free survival.\nConclusion: These current data suggest that ovarian cystectomy can be considered for patients\nwith apparent early-stage immature teratoma as it preserves fertility as much as possible without\nadversely impacting upon survival.\n",

In order to preserve fertility as\nmuch as possible, ovarian cystectomy is\nundoubtedly better than excising the whole\novary as this practice would minimize loss of\nnormal cortex tissue. Several studies have\ninvestigated ovarian function following cyst-\nectomy in other conditions, such as ovarian\nendometrioma.8\u00ad10 One study reported a\ntransient reduction in anti-Mu\n\u00a8 llerian hor-\nmone (AMH), an indicator of ovarian\nreserve; however, after 6 months, the\nAMH levels had recovered and by 12\nmonths after surgery they had returned to\nnormal.8 Another study reported a slight but\nnonsignificant reduction in serum\nAMH if cystectomy was implemented with-\nout using bipolar coagulation.9\nHowever, cystectomy may involve a risk\nof leaving residual tumour within the\nremaining ovarian tissue. Immature tera-\ntomas are characterized by the fact that if\nrecurrent, these tumours may develop into\nmature teratomas.4 For example, a previous\nstudy reported that from 34 patients, four\npatients experienced malignant relapse of\nimmature teratoma, while three patients\nrelapsed in the form of a mature teratoma.6\nFurthermore, even if immature teratomas\nreoccur in a malignant form, most patients\ncan be treated effectively because such\ntumours exhibit excellent sensitivity to\nBased upon these facts, this present study\nhypothesized that cystectomy could be con-\nsidered for immature teratomas in patients\ndiagnosed at an early stage. Because of the\nrarity of this tumour, there has been no\nspecific study of this type as yet, although\nthere have been a few sporadic cases\nlargest set of seven patients receiving cyst-\nectomy; only one patient with a stage IA\ngrade 1 tumour relapsed with a mature\nteratoma 3 months later.6 In a study of\ntwo patients (one of stage IA grade 1, and\nthe other of stage IA grade 2) undergoing\ncystectomy without chemotherapy, neither\npatient relapsed.11 A report of a single\npatient (stage IC grade 1) who received\nbilateral cystectomy followed by three\ncycles of the bleomycin, etoposide and cis-\nplatin (BEP) regimen demonstrated that the\npatient did not relapse over a 39-month\nfollow-up period.12 These 10 cases support\nthe hypothesis that cystectomy might be a\nsafe option for patients with early-stage\nThis present study reviewed a cohort of\npatients with apparent early-stage immature\nteratoma over a 19-year period in an\nObstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital in\nShanghai, China. The aim of the study was\nto investigate whether performing cystec-\ntomy instead of USO would compromise the\nsurvival rates of patients with early-stage\nimmature teratoma.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis retrospective study enrolled consecu-\ntive patients surgically treated in the\nDepartment of Gynaecology, Obstetrics\nand Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China between\nInclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patho-\nlogical diagnosis of a pure immature tera-\ntoma; (ii) gross confinement of malignant\nlesions to the ovary (or ovaries) as reported\nin the surgical report; (iii) patients who\nreceived fertility-sparing surgery.

For example, the overall survival rate\nwas 91.6% when all stages were considered,\nbut only 80% for patients with advanced\nstages of disease.12 This present study\ndemonstrated a 5-year overall survival rate\nfor our cohort of apparent early-stage\npatients of 100%. Patients with a higher\ntumour grade are reported to have a higher\nrate of recurrence.19 However, in this pre-\nsent cohort, tumour grade was not found to\nbe a useful prognostic factor for DFS. This\nmay be due to the excellent survival rate of\nthis present cohort of early-stage patients.\nThe standard surgery for patients with\nearly-stage teratoma, as recommended by\nTable 3.

For example, of 23\npatients with pure immature teratomas who\ndid not receive comprehensive staging, only\none patient relapsed and recovered after\nfour cycles of etoposide and cisplatin\nchemotherapy.3 Another study, based upon\nthe `Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End\nResults' programme, showed that lympha-\ndenectomy does not provide any significant\nbenefit to the survival of patients affected by\nimmature teratoma.20 In this present cohort\nof 43 patients, only three patients received\ncomprehensive staging surgery but the sur-\nvival outcomes were satisfactory. The over-\nall analysis in the present study also showed\nthat comprehensive staging surgery was not\na useful prognostic factor for DFS.\nCollectively, this suggests that comprehen-\nsive staging procedures can be omitted for\npatients with apparent early-stage teratoma\nwithout compromising survival. In fact,\nsome researchers have considered that the\nrole of surgical staging in this disease was to\navoid adjuvant chemotherapy for low grade\nearly-stage tumours.12\nIn the present study, none of the 14\npatients who received cystectomy relapsed\nduring follow-up and cystectomy was not\nshown to be a poor prognostic factor for\nDFS. Furthermore, none of these 14\nFigure 1. Disease-free survival (DFS) curve of patients undergoing cystectomy (group 1) or unilateral\nsalpingo-oophorectomy (USO; group 2).

These current findings sug-\ngest that the application of cystectomy\nwithout comprehensive staging surgery is a\nsafe option for patients with apparent early-\nstage teratoma.\nThe BEP protocol is the standard chemo-\ntherapy regimen recommended by the\nNCCN and is the most widely used strat-\negy.7 However, the PVB regimen can also be\neffective and is widely used in China.21 In\nthis present study, there was no significant\ndifference in the survival rates of patients\ntreated with either the BEP or PVB regi-\nmens. The NCCN supports the omission of\nadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with\nstage I, grade 1 immature teratoma based\nupon the fact that comprehensive staging is\nadopted.22 Over recent years, the role of\nchemotherapy in the treatment of early-\nstage immature teratoma has become\nincreasingly questioned. For example, the\nMITO-9 trial strongly suggested that phys-\nicians should not adopt chemotherapy in the\nprimary setting but rather apply this strat-\negy only in cases of recurrence for all grades\nof stage I tumour.11 Furthermore, a recent\nreport showed that adjuvant chemotherapy\ndid not reduce the chance of relapse in\npaediatric patients although the situation\nin adult patients was not clear.23 This pre-\nsent study also considered whether it was\nsafe to omit both staging procedures and\nchemotherapy and perform only cystectomy\nfor these early-stage patients. In the 14\npatients receiving cystectomy, none were\ncomprehensively staged while eight patients\nreceived adjuvant chemotherapy. However,\nthe present study was not able to reach a\ndefinitive conclusion because no relapses\nwere observed in this group of patients.\nThis present study demonstrated that\nthere were no significant differences between\ncystectomy and USO in terms of the\nresumption of normal menstruation or preg-\nnancy rate following surgery. However,\nseveral young patients were not ready for\npregnancy, were unmarried, or were taking\ncontraceptive measures.\nIn this present cohort, cystectomy was\nwith frozen sections that failed to confirm\nthe presence of immature neural tissue,\nalthough malignancy was suspected in 12\npatients according to gross examination.\nThis casts doubt over whether patients in\nthe cystectomy group possessed malignant\nlesions smaller than those of the USO group,\nwhich may further impact upon prognosis of\nthe patients. The quantity of malignant\nlesions, more specifically the immature\nneural tissue, is closely related to the grade\nof the tumour.24,25 If hardly any immature\nneural tissue can be detected under high-\npower microscopy when sampling properly,\nthen the tumour should be designated grade\n1.13 However, the final pathology report\nproved that eight patients were diagnosed\nwith grade 1 while the other five were\nverified as grade 2. When preparing samples\nfor frozen sections, only one small piece of\ntissue was sampled. Both the experience of\nthe pathologist and the limited volume of\nsampled tissue may have resulted in the\nfailure to collect a sample that included\nmalignant tissue.\nthis present cohort presented with abnormal\nserum AFP levels. The Pediatric Oncology\nGroup and the Children's Cancer Group\nhave reported that 44.8% patients with\nimmature teratomas were confirmed to\nhave co-existing microscopic foci of endo-\ndermal sinus tumour (EST), especially in\ngrade 2 or 3 tumours.26 Although no micro-\nscopic foci of EST were reported in this\npresent study, if the tumours had been\nexamined more closely, then tiny EST foci\nmight have been detected. Spearman correl-\nation analysis showed that the AFP level\nwas positively correlated with tumour grade\nin the present study. Although significantly\nhigher AFP levels were found in group 2\ncompared with group 1, no significant\ndifference in the tumour grades was detected\nbetween the two groups. Furthermore,\nalthough AFP levels differed between the\ntwo groups, elevated AFP (!40 ng/ml)\nbefore surgery was not a prognostic factor\nfor DFS in this present cohort.\nThis study had several limitations. First,\nit was retrospective and may have been\naffected by selection bias. Secondly, the\nsample size was small. Unfortunately, it\nwas difficult to compile a larger cohort, or\nto carry out either a prospective or rando-\nmized controlled trial, because of the rarity\nof this tumour. Any disparity between the\ntwo groups did not appear to impact upon\nthe results.\nIn conclusion, to the best of our know-\nledge, this is the first study to investigate the\nrole of cystectomy in patients with apparent\nearly-stage immature teratoma. These pre-\nsent data suggest that cystectomy could be\nconsidered for patients with apparent early-\nstage immature teratoma without compro-\nmising survival.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nSupported by the Shanghai Science and\nTechnology Commission (grant number:\nHealth and Family Planning Commission (grant\nReferences\n1.
