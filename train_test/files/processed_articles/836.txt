The estimated number of work-\nloss days for the past 2 weeks (i.e., the esti-\nmated coefficient) is then multiplied by the\nderived daily earnings. This amount of pro-\nductivity loss is then projected back to\nyearly estimates. All prices were expressed\nRESULTS\nSample characteristics\npeople (2.8% of the total sample) with dia-\nthe relevant age range. For the purpose of\nregression analysis, the value of variables\ncan be neither missing nor in an irrelevant\nrange. The construction of the working-age\nsample therefore has to exclude subjects\nwith missing values on key variables. With\nple with diabetes, and within the diabetes\nforce. We used Student's t test on the sample\nstatistics for the selected 1,351 subjects and\nthose statistics from the original sample with\nsubjects containing missing values for key\nexplanatory variables. Student'st test showed\nthat we could not reject the null hypothesis\nthat there was statistically no difference\nbetween samples. Therefore, the exclusion\nof subjects with missing information on cer-\ntain variables would not introduce a major\nbias in the results.\nIn Table 1 we present the relevant char-\nacteristics for the full sample (working and\nnonworking) and the working sample. For\nthe full sample, people with diabetes were\nolder, more likely to be black, and less\nTable 1--Demographic characteristics of the full sample and the sample of working individuals\nSample of\nFull sample working individuals\nDiabetic Nondiabetic Diabetic Nondiabetic\nBackground information\nHealth status\nOther information\npast 2 weeks\nData are % or % (SD).\nlikely to be single. As expected, only 53%\nof people with diabetes were in the labor\nforce, compared with 77% of those people\nwithout diabetes. With respect to self-\nreported quality-of-life by group, 20% of\nthe individuals with diabetes were in poor\nhealth, whereas 2% of the nondiabetic\ngroup ranked themselves as being in poor\nhealth. For the working sample, except for\nsex, age, and health status, the demo-\ngraphic characteristics by group was very\nsimilar to those of the full sample. We\nfound that 19% of people with diabetes\nwere type 1, whereas 80% of them had\ndiabetes complications.\nEmployment status\nIn Table 2 we provide the estimates of the\nprobability of working. In column 1 we\nshow the results of the regression equation\nfor the full sample when using the dummy\nvariable that indicated the presence or\nabsence of diabetes. Employment was asso-\nciated with sex (male subjects had 21%\nhigher employment rates [95% CI\n21\u00ad22%]), education (better-educated sub-\njects had 3\u00ad4% higher rates [2\u00ad5%]), and\nrace (nonwhites had 2\u00ad6% lower rates\n[2\u00ad7%]). Age, marital status (single), and\nfamily size were associated with lower\nemployment rates. Individuals with poor\nin the labor force and individuals with fair\ncompared with individuals with excellent\nhealth. Individuals with diabetes were 4%\n(2\u00ad4%) less likely to be in the workforce,\nwhereas the employment probability differs\nbetween types 1 and 2 diabetes.\nIn column 2 of Table 2, we present the\nestimates for the inclusion of the dichoto-\nmous variable indicating whether people\nwith diabetes had any complications, using\nonly the sample for people with diabetes.\nUnlike in the full sample, only sex, age, and\neducational effects are found to be impor-\ntant factors determining the workforce\ndecision. People with diabetes who had\nlikely to be in the workforce than those\nwho did not have complications. Again, the\ndependency on insulin did not enhance the\nworking probability of people with dia-\nbetes.\nLost work days\nIn Table 3 we present the results of regres-\nsion equations indicating the effect on\nwork-loss days of variables including hav-\ning diabetes during the prior 2 weeks and\nthe severity of diabetes (results are in\ncolumns 1 and 2, respectively). In column\n1, we present estimates for the sample of\nworking individuals. We found that being\nmale and older reduced the number of\nwork-loss days. For the self-reported health\nstatus measure, there was a progressive\nincrease in work-loss days as health status\nfell. No statistically significant effect was\nfound for self-reported diabetes. In column\n2 we address the loss of productivity for\npeople in the diabetes group. Using this\nregression equation, the effect of having\ndiabetes complications (compared with not\nhaving them) increased the number of\nwork-loss days by 3.2 days (1\u00ad6) within a\n2-week period. In either specification, the\neffect of having type 1 diabetes is found to\nbe significant.\nBecause the presence of diabetes was\nnot statistically significant in the full sample\nfor the tobit regression (Table 3), in Table 4\nwe present lost-productivity cost estimates\nin relation to the diabetes group with com-\nplications. Our reference value for yearly\nearnings are shown in column 1. For exam-\nple, a fully employed white male subject\nin 1989. For white men with diabetes with\ncomplications who were aged between 25\nand 54 years, the yearly earnings loss was\ngraphic group (by race and sex), such\nlosses increase with age and peak at the\nprime age-group (age 25\u00ad54 years). Among\nthe groups, nonwhite female subjects gen-\nerally suffered the least compared with\neither their white female or male (white\nand nonwhite) counterparts.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes has a\nconsiderable impact on economic behavior\nin the labor force. Controlling for variables\nsuch as age, sex, and health status, the pres-\nence of diabetes itself reduced employment\nby 3.5%, and the presence of complica-\ntions reduced employment by 12% com-\npared with the absence of complications.\nFor those individuals who were employed,\nhaving diabetes did not have a significant\noverall effect on hours worked; however,\nthose who had complicated diabetes\nworked 3.2 days less every 2 weeks than\nthose whose diabetes were without compli-\ncations. The type of diabetes had no impact.\n(HRS) to study labor market outcomes for\nNg, Jacobs, and Johnson\nTable 2--Probit regression results indicating the likelihood of being in the labor force for the full\nsample and the diabetes sample\nVariables Full sample Diabetes sample\nRegional factor Only one variable is significant All are insignificant\nSEM is provided in parentheses. *Significance at 5% level.\npeople with diabetes. Kahn's results relating\nto employment indicated that people with-\nout diabetes had participation rates 12%\nabove those with diabetes, but he only\nexamined the 50- to 60-year age-group. In\naddition, Kahn's results indicated that peo-\nple with 5 years' duration of diabetes had\n3% lower employment rates. In his study,\nKahn focused on the issue of changes in\nlabor markets over time, rather than on the\nproductivity losses associated with dia-\nbetes. He did not include the complications\nvariable, which has important implications\nfor economic evaluations. He also did not\ninclude an analysis of days of work lost. In\nhis analysis of the HRS sample, he found\nthat the earnings of men with diabetes was\n69% of those without diabetes; there was\nno difference between female groups. How-\never, the HRS analysis was confined to peo-\n(roughly one-half of our sample of people\nwith diabetes).\nIt should be noted that the analysis\ncould not distinguish between long- and\nshort-term disability and productivity losses\nassociated with diabetes. This distinction\nwould be important in identifying lost-work\ntime attributable to short-term complica-\ntions of diabetes (e.g., hyper- or hypogly-\ncemia)--which would likely be more\nprevalent in type 1 diabetes--from lost pro-\nductivity attributable to longer-term com-\nplications, which could occur in both con-\nditions. Given the limitations of the\nself-reported data from population surveys,\nwe were not able to incorporate productiv-\nity losses caused by premature mortality\nassociated with diabetes.\nWe should point out that the data that\nwe have obtained were self-reported, and\nsuch data are often subject to errors related\nto recall. However, the variables that we\nexamined are less likely to be subject to\nrecall because of the short period of data\ncollection. There could be errors related to\nthe misreporting of diabetes because indi-\nviduals might not have known they had\ndiabetes or complications; however, given\nthe seriousness of the condition, this\nshould not be a significant problem. Fur-\nther, given the nature of the data from this\ncross-sectional survey, the observed rela-\ntionships must be viewed as associations\nand not necessarily as causal relationships.\nIn terms of model setup, one may argue\nthat diabetes complications may be\nendogenous instead of exogenous. Facing\nthe constraint of data availability and the\ntheme of the study, the endogeneity issue is\nbeyond the scope of the present analysis.\nCosts that can be tied to specific inter-\nventions, such as diabetes control, can yield\nvery valuable information. Several studies,\nshown that aggressive interventions for dia-\nbetes can retard the development of com-\nplications.

    "reduced_content": "The loss of productivity caused by illness\nhas been a prominent topic in general\nhealth policy for several decades (1\u00ad3).\nNationwide estimates have also been con-\nducted for people with diabetes (4,5). The\nAmerican Diabetes Association estimates that\ndiabetes accounted for $27 billion in direct\nmedical costs and $32 billion in indirect or\nyears, there has been a growing recognition\nthat, for many reasons, the costs of diabetes\nshould be expressed as an \"excess cost\" fig-\nure; this excess cost statistic has been esti-\nmated in the U.S. for people with diabetes\nfor direct medical expenditures (6\u00ad8), and it\nhas been estimated for both direct and lost-\nproductivity costs in Sweden (9).\nTo date, in these studies, diabetes-\nrelated lost-productivity costs have been\nexpressed for entire groups and have been\ncategorized for only a few selected popula-\ntion characteristics, such as age. We know\nvery little about the determinants of pro-\nductivity losses. It is very important to gain\nan understanding of what factors affect\nthem, as well as of their overall magnitude.\nWe have conducted an analysis of lost\nproductivity attributable to the prevalence\nand severity of diabetes in the U.S. Using\ndata from the National Health Interview\nSurvey (NHIS) and its diabetes supplement,\nwe developed estimates of how the onset\nand progression of diabetes influences the\nworkplace behavior of individuals. We\nfocused on two components: participation\nin the labor force and actual hours of work.\nMETHODS -- Data were used from the\nsupplement, published by the U.S. Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services\nNational Center for Health Statistics. The\nNHIS is a personal-interview household\nsurvey of a nationwide sample of the civil-\nian noninstitutionalized population of the\nU.S. It contains questions on personal and\ndemographic characteristics, illnesses,\ninjuries, impairment, chronic conditions,\nand use of health resources. The diabetes\nsupplement includes extensive survey\nquestions on the prevalence of diabetes\nand specific diabetes complications. Sub-\njects of this study were individuals aged\nwithout diabetes, and included those who\nwere and were not in the labor force.\nEmployment status\nTo address the effect of diabetes on the\nemployment status of an individual, we\nadopted the standard probit estimation in\nanalyzing an individual's probability of being\nin the labor force, applied to the entire work-\ning-age population. The dependent variable\ntakes the value of zero or one, with the lat-\nter meaning \"in the labor force.\" According\nto the standard theory of labor supply\n(10\u00ad17), the decision to be in the labor force\nis determined by sex, age, race, marital sta-\ntus, educational level, regional factors, fam-\nily size, and the health status of the\nindividual. Regional factors were approxi-\nmated by residence in an urban area and the\nregion of residence. A self-reported health\nstatus measure was also included. Finally, a\ndummy variable indicating whether an indi-\nvidual has diabetes was included.\nGiven that diabetes is a lifelong disease\nand that one's health deteriorates as he/she\nFrom Hong Kong Baptist University (Y.C.N.), Hong Kong, China; and the University of Alberta and Insti-\ntute of Health Economics (P.J., J.A.J.), Alberta, Canada.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Philip Jacobs, ACHORD GROUP, Institute of Health Eco-\nAbbreviations: HRS, Health and Retirement Survey; NHIS, National Health Interview Survey.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syst\u00e8me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\nProductivity Losses Associated With\nDiabetes in the U.S.\nOBJECTIVE -- The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of productivity losses in\nthe U.S. attributable to diabetes, with regard to specific demographic and disease-related char-\nacteristics in the U.S.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We used the 1989 National Health Inter-\nview Survey, a random survey of individuals in the U.S. that included a diabetes supplement.\nData on individuals were obtained for labor force participation, hours of work, demographic\nand occupational characteristics, self-reported health status, and several variables that indicated\nthe presence, duration, and severity (complications) of diabetes. Using multivariate regression\nanalyses, we estimated the association of independent variables (e.g., demographics, health,\nand diabetes status) with labor force participation, hours of work lost, and the economic value\nof lost work attributable to diabetes and its complications and duration.\nRESULTS -- In general, the presence of diabetes and complications were found to be\nrelated to workforce participation variables. The magnitude of the lost-productivity costs\ndepended on personal characteristics and on the presence and status of diabetes. In general,\nthe loss of yearly earnings amounted to about a one-third reduction in earnings and ranged\nCONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes has a considerable net effect on earnings, and the complica-\ntions and duration of diabetes have compound effects. Our findings have implications for the\ncost-effectiveness of diabetes control; the presence of complicating factors is the single most\nimportant predictive factor in lost productivity costs attributable to diabetes, and thus the\navoidance or retardation of complications will have an impact on indirect health-related costs.\nE p i d e m i o l o g y / H e a l t h S e r v i c e s / P s y c h o s o c i a l R e s e a r c h\nProductivity losses associated with diabetes\nages, the severity of the disease has an\nimpact on the likelihood of one being in the\nlabor force. To address this issue, the above\nprobit equation was modified and reesti-\nmated for the diabetic group only. This was\ndone by replacing the variable that indicates\nthe presence or absence of diabetes with\none that indicates whether the individual\nhad any complications of diabetes, defined\nas the reporting of any of the following con-\nditions: affected retina, high blood pressure\nor hypertension, angina, stroke, heart dis-\nease, cataracts, kidney disease, foot/ankle\nsores (peripheral vascular disease), retinopa-\nthy, glaucoma, proteinuria, gum disease,\nautonomic neuropathy (bladder control),\namputations, and peripheral neuropathy.\nThe literature has generally regarded\nthe impact of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes\non indirect costs as being different. This\nmay be true because of the clinical and\ndemographic differences between the two\nconditions (e.g., earlier age of onset, longer\nduration of diabetes, required use of\ninsulin, and risk of hypoglycemia). Accord-\ningly, a dummy variable (TYPE1) indicating\nwhether an individual has type 1 diabetes\nor not was included in the regression analy-\nsis to test the hypothesis that productivity\nlosses differ between type 1 and type 2\ndiabetes.

According to the information\nprovided by the NHIS, occupations were\ngrouped into 13 categories. To examine the\ninfluence of the occupational effect on the\nproductivity loss, the 13 categories were\nfurther grouped into 5 broad categories.\nFarming, forestry, and fishing occupations\nwere used as the reference group.
