Unfa-\nvourable lifestyles, such as smoking, lack of exercise,\nexcessive alcohol intake, high coffee consumption as\nwell as nutritional deficiencies in B vitamins are\nassociated with elevated levels of homocysteine [1,\n2]. Abundant data support the notion that elevated\nhomocysteine is an independent risk factor for\nseveral multi-system diseases [3], including coron-\nary heart disease [4\u00ad6], stroke [4, 7], dementia and\nAlzheimer's disease [8], as well as osteoporotic\nEvidence suggests that elevated homocysteine\nlevels may cause toxicity by such mechanisms as\noxidative stress [11] and endothelial damage [11,\n12]. Cardiovascular fitness represents an individ-\nual's ability to perform aerobic exercise, that being\nthe ability of active skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen\nduring exercise. Cardiovascular fitness is an import-\nant correlate of several clinically important out-\ncomes, including stroke [13], myocardial infarction\n[14], metabolic syndrome [15], or other cardiovas-\ncular diseases and risk factors [16\u00ad18]. Theoretic-\nally, poor cardiorespiratory capacity can be derived\nfrom pathological changes peripherally affecting the\ntissues and the associated vasculature or centrally\nperturbing the heart and coronary arteries. These\npathological changes, to some extent, may be\nattributed to elevated levels of homocysteine and\nthe related tissue toxicity.\nHowever, there is no existing data examining the\nassociation between cardiovascular fitness and levels\nof homocysteine, not to mention the fact that the\nassociation may be different for both genders.\nTherefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was\nto examine the association between homocysteine\nand cardiovascular fitness in both men and women\nusing data from the National Health and Nutrition\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe NHANES is a population-based survey designed\nto collect information on the health and nutrition of\nthe US household population. The NHANES used a\nstratified and cluster sampling design to obtain a\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian US population. Beginning in 1999, the\nNHANES became a continuous, annual survey\nrather than the periodic survey that it had been in\nthe past. The survey data are released every 2 years.\nDetailed survey operation manuals, consent docu-\nare available in the NHANES website [19, 20].\ntest was administered to 6687 subjects aged\nbetween 12 and 49 without the following charac-\nters: (i) physical functioning limitations, such as\ndifficulties in walking/standing, having fractures or\nbone/joint injuries, requiring a cane or a wheel-\nchair, having amputations of legs or feet, blind,\ndiabetic retinopathy, loss of balance/consciousness\non a regular basis, and obese (>350 lb); (ii) cardio-\nvascular conditions/symptoms, such as congestive\nheart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, stroke,\nmyocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, self-\nreported heart or stroke problems, and resting\ntachycardia (>100 min)1) or high blood pressure\n(systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic\nblood pressure >100 mmHg); (iii) pulmonary con-\nditions/symptoms, such as orthopnoea, short of\nbreath when walking at own pace on level ground,\nself-reported lung or breathing problems, emphys-\nema, frequent (>12) or severe (limit speech) attacks\nof wheezing during the past 12 months; and (iv)\nusage of certain medications including anti-dys-\nrhythmics, beta-blocker (including eye drops), cal-\ncium channel blockers, digitalis, nitrates, central\nnervous system stimulants and ephedra-based\nweight loss medications. We excluded 3875 subjects\naged <20 because some confounding variables for\nthe analysis, such as smoking status and alcohol\nintake, were not available.\neligible for cardiovascular fitness test. During the\ncardiovascular fitness test, 1310 subjects experi-\nenced the following problems which might result in\ninaccurate VO2\nmax estimations (683 subjects) or\neven missing values (627 subjects): subjects' refusal\nof undergoing or continuing the test (15), technical\nproblems occurring during the test (707), partici-\npant discomfort or distress, such as chest pain,\ndizziness, or development of wheezing, which was\nobserved by the health technician or reported by the\nparticipant (35), significant haemodynamic chan-\nges, such as exercise blood pressure >260 systolic\nand/or 115 mmHg diastolic, or significant drop\n(>20 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure during\nexercise, arising during the test and resulting in\nsafety concerns (513), not able to calculate VO2\nmax\nbecause heart rate obtained at the end of stage 2 of\ntreadmill test was lower than that at the end of stage\n1, or the heart rate difference between stages 1 and\nspecified (25). These subjects were excluded in order\nto have reliable data on estimated VO2\nmax in the\nanalysis. The subjects excluded from the analysis\n(1310) were more likely to have higher body mass\nindexes (BMIs) and more likely to be male (57.2% vs.\nAmongst the 1502 subjects with reliable meas-\nures of estimated VO2\nmax, 58 subjects were further\nexcluded because of missing values in homocysteine\nexamination. Therefore, the final analytic sample\nreliable estimated VO2\nmax and nonmissing values\nin the measurements of homocysteine.\nMeasurement of cardiovascular fitness\nCardiovascular fitness can be measured via an\nexercise tolerance test in which inspired oxygen\nand expired carbon dioxide are directly measured\nduring testing. More commonly, in clinical settings\nincluding the NHANES protocol, inspired and expired\ngases are not measured, but cardiovascular fitness is\nevaluated through surrogate measures including\nobservation of heart rate and perceived exertion.\nBased on age, gender, BMI, and self-reported level\nof physical activity, participants were assigned to\none of eight treadmill test protocols. Each protocol\nincludes a 2-min warm-up, two 3-min exercise\nstages, and a 2-min cool down period. The goal of\neach protocol is to elicit a submaximal exercise effect\nwith heart rate that is approximately 75% of the\nage-predicted maximum (220 minus age) by the end\nof the test. By monitoring heart rate response to\neach of the 3-min stages, maximal oxygen uptake\nmax) can be estimated by using measured\ncardiovascular responses to known levels of exercise\nworkloads, assuming the relationship between heart\nrate and oxygen consumption is linear during\nThe estimated VO2\nmax is the main outcome of\ncardiovascular fitness in the NHANES. The estimated\nmax was further categorized to three cardiovas-\ncular fitness levels: i.e. low, moderate and high, based\non gender-age specific cut-off points of estimated\nmax. The reference cut-off points used for adults\naged 20\u00ad49 years are based on data from the\nAerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS) [16,\n21]. Low level of cardiovascular fitness was defined\nas an estimated VO2\nmax below the 20th percentile of\nthe ACLS data of the same gender and age group;\nmoderate cardiovascular fitness was defined as a\nvalue between the 20th and 59th percentile, and\nhigh cardiovascular fitness level was defined as at or\nabove the 60th percentile. The reference ranges for\nmax are summarized in the Table 1.\nMeasurement of homocysteine\nBlood specimens were collected at mobile examina-\ntion centres and were frozen before analysis. Plasma\nhomocysteine was measured by the Abbott homo-\ncysteine assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,\nUSA), a fully automated fluorescence polarization\nimmunoassay (FPIA) method. Plasma total homo-\ncysteine concentrations were calculated by the\nAbbott IMx Immunoassay Analyzer using a\nmachine-stored calibration curve. The FPIA method,\nused by the NHANES as a primary tool to determine\nhomocysteine levels, was fully equivalent to other\nfrequently used method such as high performance\nliquid chromatography [22].\nTable 1 Reference ranges for VO2\nmax according to the Aerobics\nCenter Longitudinal Study (ACLS)*\nAge groups Fitness levels\nEstimated ranges of VO2\nmax\nMen Women\n*The reference cut-off points of fitness levels used for adults aged\n20\u00ad49 years are based on data from the ACLS: low level of\nphysical fitness was defined as an estimated VO2\nmax below the\n20th percentile of the ACLS data of the same gender and age\ngroup; moderate fitness as a value between the 20th and the 59th\npercentile; and high fitness level as at or above the 60th per-\ncentile.\nCovariates\nAge, gender, race/ethnicity and smoking status were\nobtained from self-report. Diabetes was defined by\nself-report of a doctor's diagnosis, the presence of a\nplasma glucose level >200 mg dL)1 or the use of\ndiabetic medications (including insulin injection\nand/or oral hypoglycaemic agents). The presence\nof hypertension was defined by self-report of a\ndoctor's diagnosis, the use of anti-hypertensive\nmedications or averaged blood pressure >140/\n90 mmHg. The use of lipid-lowering medications\nwas obtained by self-report. BMI was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by the square of height\nin metres. Self-reported general health condition was\nascertained by the questionnaire `How would you\nsay your health in general is?' and was categorized\nto excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Average\nlevels of physical activity were obtained by self-\nreport and categorized into the following categories:\nsitting during the day and not walking about very\nmuch; standing or walking about a lot during the\nday, but not having to carry or lift things very often;\nlifting light loads or having to climb stairs or hills\noften; and doing heavy work or carrying heavy\nloads. Alcohol intake was determined by the ques-\ntionnaire `In any one year, have you had at least 12\ndrinks of any type of alcohol beverage?' and was\ndichotomized. Nutritional markers including serum\nand folate levels were measured by\nusing the Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA)\n`Quantaphase II Folate/vitamin B12\n' radioassay kit.\nGiven that C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown\nto be associated with cardiovascular fitness [23\u00ad25],\nCRP level was adjusted as a covariate and was\nquantified by utilizing latex-enhanced nephelometry\nwith a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System\n(Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA). Total cholesterol\nlevels, haemoglobin levels as well as serum creati-\nnine were also obtained.\nAnalysis\nThe distributions of plasma levels of homocysteine in\nboth men and women were positively skewed.\nTherefore, we used natural-log-transformed values,\nwhich provided the best-fitting model for analysis in\nwhich the homocysteine levels were treated as a\ncontinuous variable. For men, standard deviation\n(SD) scores of homocysteine were obtained from the\nformula Xi\n) Xm\n/SD, where Xi\nis the natural-log-\ntransformed homocysteine levels in the individual\nmale subject, Xm\nthe mean natural-log-transformed\nhomocysteine level in the male subjects, and SD the\nstandard deviation of the natural-log-transformed\nhomocysteine level in the male subjects. The SD\nscores of homocysteine in women were obtained\nfrom the same formula. This calculation allowed us\nto determine the changes in the cardiovascular\nfitness for each increment of 1 SD in the natural-log-\ntransformed homocysteine levels. The association\nbetween homocysteine and cardiovascular fitness\nwas also evaluated with a quartile-based analysis.\nMultiple linear regression was used to examine the\nrelationship of homocysteine levels with estimated\nmax. We used an extended-model approach for\ncovariates adjustments: model 1 \u00bc age, race,\nand BMI; model 2 \u00bc model 1 + chronic diseases\n(hypertension and diabetes) + health behaviours\n(smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activ-\nity) + self-report health condition + use of lipid-\nlowering agents; whilst model 3 \u00bc model 2 + levels\nof folate, vitamin B12\n, creatinine, CRP, total choles-\nterol and haemoglobin.\nWe also re-assessed the association between\nplasma homocysteine levels and odds of low cardio-\nvascular fitness by using multiple logistic regression.\nGiven the fact that the NHANES population weights\nare only applicable to analyses that use the entire\npopulation and we limited our analyses to a special\nsubset of subjects, we did not use the NHANES\nthis study. Data management and analysis were\nperformed using STATA 8.0 software (STATA Cor-\nporation, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nTable 2 lists the characteristics of the participants\naccording to sex. The mean age amongst the 714\nwomen it was 33.5 years. Men smoked more than\nwomen and consumed more alcohol. Men had\nhigher estimated VO2\nmax, haemoglobin levels,\nserum creatinine, total cholesterol, as well as\nhomocysteine concentrations than women. The\ncut-off values for homocysteine quartiles amongst\nwhilst amongst women they were: quartile 1\n(>7.43 lmol L)1). Men were comparable to women\nin terms of BMI, race, as well as presence of\nhypertension and diabetes mellitus.\nEstimated VO2\nmax and levels of homocysteine\nHigh homocysteine levels were inversely associated\nwith estimated VO2\nmax amongst the women\n(Table 3). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity\nand BMI, each increment of 1 SD in the natural-log-\ntransformed homocysteine level was associated with\nestimated VO2\nmax. Interestingly, additional adjust-\nment of covariates further strengthened the associ-\nation between homocysteine and estimated VO2\nmax.\nIn model 2 (adjusted for demographics, chronic\ndiseases profile, health behaviours, use of lipid-\nlowering agents and self-report health condition)\nand model 3 (adjusted for levels of folate, vitamin B12\n,\nCRP, total cholesterol and haemoglobin in addition\nto covariates in model 2), each SD increase in the\nnatural-log-transformed homocysteine level was\ndecrease in the estimated VO2\nmax respectively. We\ndid not find any association between homocysteine\nand estimated VO2\nmax amongst men.\nTable 2 Characteristics of participants from the NHANES 1999\u00ad\nCharacteristics\nMen\nWomen\nContinuous variablesa\nEstimated VO2\nmax\nCategorical variablesc\ndrinks/year\nUse of lipid-lowering\nmedications\naValues are expressed as mean (SD) unless otherwise specified.\nbValues are expressed as median (interquartile range) due to right\nskewness. cValues are expressed as n (%).\nTable 3 Regression coefficients for the association between esti-\nmax and homocysteine\nba (SE) P-value\nModels with homocysteine as a continuous variable\nMen\nWomen\nQuartile\ncomparison bb (SE) P-value\nP for\ntrend\nModels with homocysteine by increasing quartiles\nMen\nWomen\nAdjusted covariates: model 1 \u00bc age, race and body mass index;\nmodel 2 \u00bc model 1 + chronic diseases (hypertension and diabe-\ntes) + use of lipid-lowering agents + health behaviours (smoking,\nalcohol consumption and physical activity) + self-report health\ncondition; model 3 \u00bc Model 2 + levels of folate, vitamin B12\n,\ncreatinine, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol and haemoglobin.\naParameter estimates (b) can be interpreted as differences in mean\nestimated VO2\nmax (mL kg)1 min)1) for each increment of 1 SD in\nthe log-transformed homocysteine values amongst men (or wo-\nmen). bParameter estimates (b) can be interpreted as differences in\nmean estimated VO2\nmax (mL kg)1 min)1) compared male (or\nfemale) subjects in the second, third and fourth quartiles of\nhomocysteine levels to those in the lowest quartile.\nWe subsequently analysed the homocysteine lev-\nels divided into quartiles and showed that estimated\nmax for women in the highest homocysteine\nquartile were 2.64 mL kg)1 min)1 less than that for\nwomen in the lowest quartile after adjustment for\nage, race and BMI (significant trend across homo-\ncysteine quartiles with P \u00bc 0.003). Likewise, sup-\nplementary adjustment for additional covariates\nshowed an even stronger association between hom-\nocysteine and cardiovascular fitness amongst\nwomen. Homocysteine was not related to estimated\nmax amongst men in the quartile-based\napproach. We did not find any interactive effect of\nhomocysteine with folate, vitamin B12\nand CRP on\nestimated VO2\nmax in both men and women. Stra-\ntified by gender, adjusted means of VO2\nmax based\non different homocysteine quartiles were obtained\nfrom the fully adjusted regression models and\nillustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe conclusions did not vary with the 683\nsubjects (who met technical, physical or safety\nissues during cardiovascular fitness testing) with\nnonmissing, yet nonreliable values of estimated\nmax included in the analyses.\nLow cardiovascular fitness and levels of homocysteine\nAssociation between homocysteine and gender-age\nspecific cardiovascular fitness levels, defined by the\nACLS, was examined by using a logistic regression\napproach (Table 4).

The association did not exist\namongst men. To the best of our knowledge, there are\nno available data on the association of cardiovascular\nfitness and homocysteine. This is the first report to\ndescribe the association in both men and women.\nOur findings support and extend a previous study\nexamining the relationship between homocysteine\nand physical function. Kado et al. [26] from the\nlongitudinal MacAuthur Study of Successful Aging\nfollowed 499 independent community-dwelling\nelders for 3 years and suggested that people with\nelevated plasma homocysteine levels were at an\nincreased risk of decline in physical function. How-\never, they did not have the opportunity to measure\nthe exercise capacity in the evaluations of physical\nfunction. In addition, subgroup analysis, such as\ngender-specific approach, was not performed, poss-\nibly due to a relatively small sample size. The present\nstudy has the advantage of examining the inde-\npendent role of homocysteine on cardiovascular\nfitness by using a relatively healthy, geographically\ndispersed, and ethnically diverse national popula-\ntion-based sample. Additionally, covariates that may\nconfound the measures of association in our study\nwere appropriately considered and controlled.\nHomocysteine is metabolized to homocysteine\nthiolactone by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Homo-\ncysteine thiolactone acylates lysine residues of cellu-\nlar and extracellular proteins, a process called protein\nhomocysteinylation [27]. Protein homocysteinyla-\ntion is a possible mechanism of homocysteine-related\nprotein damage [27] and may thus result in impaired\ncardiovascular fitness and function. However, protein\nhomocysteinylation cannot explain why the associ-\nation between homocysteine and cardiovascular\nfitness exists only in women. There may be an effect\nmodification of sex hormones, including oestrogen\nand androgen, in the association and further\nstudies to determine whether sex hormones play an\nimportant role in mediating a toxic effect of homocy-\nsteine are needed.\nOur results have clinical implications. Homocyste-\nine may be associated with capacity of aerobic\nexercise because of improvement in cardiovascular\nfunction. Thus, in addition to the predictive ability of\ncardiovascular disease, homocysteine might serve as\nan important correlate of exercise habit and recent\nphysical activity in women. Homocysteine levels may\nbe useful in screening and targeting female indivi-\nduals who may require endurance intervention to\nprevent loss of cardiovascular fitness and function.\nOur study has some limitations that deserve\ncomments. First, due to the cross-sectional design\nof the study, causality between cardiovascular\nfitness and levels of homocysteine cannot be estab-\nlished. Elevated homocysteine level may be simply a\nmarker of unhealthy lifestyle that is associated with\npoor exercise capacity. The relationship between\nlevels of homocysteine and cardiovascular fitness\nshould be study prospectively. Secondly, the NHA-\nNES did not have a direct measure of maximal\noxygen uptake (VO2\nmax), the most valid method of\nmeasuring cardiovascular fitness. Submaximal exer-\ncise capacity is also a valid measure of cardiovascu-\nlar fitness level [28, 29] because we perform most\ndaily activities at submaximal levels. Additionally, it\nis commonly used in clinical contexts and can be\nextrapolated to maximal aerobic capacity by the\nmethods the NHANES used. Finally, although the\ndata were drawn from a national population-based\ncardiovascular fitness test were excluded due to\ntechnical, physical or safety reasons. As a result, the\nanalytic sample was limited to a special subset of\nsubjects aged between 20 and 49 with reliable\nmeasures of cardiovascular fitness. Thus, our results\nwere not generalizable to the entire US population.\nIn conclusion, elevated levels of homocysteine are\nindependently associated with low cardiovascular\nfitness in women, but not in men. There is no\ninteraction of homocysteine with CRP as well as B\nvitamins on levels of cardiovascular fitness. Our\nstudy provides data in an important area where data\ncurrently do not exist.\nConflict of interest statement\nNo conflict of interest was declared.\n"
