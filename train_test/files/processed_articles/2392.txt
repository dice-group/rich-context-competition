Instead, studies23-26 of\ndelinquent youth have focused on the association be-\ntween psychiatric disorders and criminal recidivism, an-\ntisocial behavior, or social functioning. We could find only\none longitudinal study of the persistence and prevalence\nof psychiatric disorders in detained youth. Harrington et\nal27 found that 2 years after detention, many mental health\nproblems persisted or had worsened. Their sample, how-\never, excluded females, was 80% white, and was too small\n(N=97) to permit detailed analyses. Moreover, the study\nwas conducted in the United Kingdom, limiting general-\nizability to juvenile detainees in the United States.\nThe related literature--longitudinal studies of \"high-\nrisk\" youth--also provides little information. Youth with\nhistories of detention have been included in studies of\nhigh-risk youth: the homeless,28,29 youth living in im-\npoverished or high-crime neighborhoods,30-34 and the off-\nspring of parents who used substances or had psychiat-\nric disorders.29,35-46 Yet, none of these studies distinguished\nbetween youth with and without histories of detention\n(summary tables available on request).\nDelinquent youth are also underrepresented in general\npopulation longitudinal studies, such as household-based\nsurveys (eg, Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth,47,48\nNational Comorbidity Surveys,49-51 and National Epide-\nmiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions52) and\nstudiesdrawnfromschool-basedsamples(eg,OregonAdo-\nand general pediatric clinics.56,57 Household surveys typi-\nSchool-based samples omit youth who are truant or miss\nfrom general pediatric clinics omit youth who do not re-\nceive medical care.56,57 Even if sampled initially, youth may\nbelosttofollow-upwhentheyareincarceratedbecausethey\ncannot be found and because studying prisoners requires\nspecial procedures and approvals from the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services.66\nIn sum, to our knowledge, no large-scale longitudi-\nnal study has examined the prevalence and persistence\nof psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention. This\nomission is critical. Juvenile detainees have a median\nlength of stay of only 2 weeks.67 Thus, juvenile detain-\nees become a community public health problem when\nthey are released and may continue to burden society as\nthey age. Epidemiologic studies are the first step to im-\nprove prevention and treatment in correctional facili-\nties and in the community.68 Data are also needed to ad-\ndress health disparities, a priority of Healthy People 202069\nand the Institute of Medicine.70 Of the approximately one-\nhalf million incarcerated youth and young adults (aged\n24 years or younger), nearly two-thirds are African Ameri-\ncan or Hispanic,17,71 compared with one-third in the gen-\nThis study presents data from the Northwestern Ju-\nvenile Project, the first comprehensive longitudinal study\nof psychiatric disorders in youth after they leave deten-\ntion. The sample is large (N=1829), racially/ethnically\ndiverse, and includes males and females. We examined\nchanges in the prevalence and persistence of disorders\nduring the first 5 years after detention, focusing on sex\nand racial/ethnic differences.\nMETHODS\nBaseline Interviews\nWe recruited a stratified random sample of 1829 youth at in-\ntake to the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Cen-\nter (CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995,\nand June 14, 1998. The CCJTDC is used for pretrial detention\nand for offenders sentenced for fewer than 30 days. To ensure\nadequate representation of key subgroups, we stratified our\nsample by sex, race/ethnicity (African American, non-\nyears), and legal status (processed in juvenile or adult court).\nFinal sampling fractions for strata ranged from 0.11 to 0.69.\nAll detainees who were awaiting the adjudication or dispo-\nsition of their case were eligible to participate in the study.\nyouth and 62 parents or guardians) refused to participate. There\nwere no significant differences in refusal rates by sex, race/\nethnicity, or age. Twenty-seven youth left the detention cen-\nter before an interview could be scheduled; 312 left CCJTDC\nwhile we attempted to locate their caretakers for consent. Eleven\nothers were excluded from the sample because they were un-\nable to complete the interview. The final sample size was 1829:\nHispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 other race/ethnicity; and\n(eTable 1; http://www.archgenpsychiatry.com). Face-to-face\nstructured interviews were conducted at the detention center\nin a private area, most within 2 days of intake.\nFollow-up Interviews\nOur design included (1) follow-up interviews at 3 and 41/2 years\nafter baseline for the entire sample and (2) 2 additional inter-\nviews at 31/2 and 4 years after baseline for a random subsample\nup, we interviewed participants regardless of where they were\nliving: in the community (approximately two-thirds of inter-\nviews), at correctional facilities (nearly 30% of interviews), or\nby telephone if they lived more than 2 hours away (5% of\ninterviews).\nParticipants were paid $25 for the 2- to 3-hour baseline in-\nterview and $50 for each of the 3- to 4-hour follow-up inter-\nviews. Most interviewers had graduate degrees in psychology\nor an associated field and had experience interviewing at-risk\nyouth; one-third were fluent in Spanish. All interviewers were\ntrained for at least 1 month. For each wave, consistency across\ninterviewers was established and maintained via scripted mock\ninterviews after training and midwave. Additional informa-\ntion on our methods is in the eMethods and is also published\nProcedures to Obtain Assent and Consent\nat Baseline and Follow-up\nFor all interviews, participants signed either an assent form (if\nthey were aged 18 years) or a consent form (if they were\naged 18 years). The Northwestern University Institutional\nReview Board and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention Institutional Review Board approved all study proce-\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

This version of the DISC, based on the\nDSM-III-R, assesses the presence of disorders in the past 6\nmonths. The DISC-2.3 is highly structured, contains detailed\nsymptom probes, has acceptable reliability and validity, and re-\nnot include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we used the\nmodule from the DISC-IV when it became available, 13 months\nafter the study began.73 Additional detail on baseline diagnos-\nFollow-up Interviews\nWe administered the DISC-IV (Child and Young Adult ver-\nsions), based on the DSM-IV, to assess for schizophrenia, mood\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-\norder, and disruptive behavior disorders in the past year.82,83\nImpairment was defined as moderate impairment in at least one\narea of functioning (criterion A).84 To facilitate comparison with\nstudies that do not impose impairment criteria, we present preva-\nlence rates of disorders with and without the impairment cri-\nterion; our analyses of changes in disorders over time use dis-\norders with impairment.\nTo assess substance use disorders and antisocial personal-\nity disorder at follow-up, we administered the Diagnostic In-\nterview Schedule Version IV (DIS-IV).85,86 We used the DIS-IV\nto assess substance use disorders because the DISC-IV is not\nsufficiently detailed for our population. Antisocial personality\ndisorder was assessed for participants 18 years or older (who\nwere no longer eligible for diagnoses of childhood disruptive\nbehavior disorders). Disorders are assessed for the year before\nthe interview. Consistent with the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication (NCS-R),50 participants who met the criteria\nfor substance use disorder or antisocial personality disorder with\n\"partial recovery\" were scored as having the disorder. We did\nnot implement DSM exclusionary criteria.\nComparability of Diagnoses Over Time\nOur diagnostic measures changed over time for 3 reasons:\n(1) the release of the DISC-IV (based on DSM-IV criteria) mid-\nstudy, (2) some participants turned 18 years old and were there-\nfore ineligible for childhood disruptive behavior disorders, and\n(3) our need to use a more comprehensive measure of sub-\nstance use disorder (DIS-IV) for the follow-up interviews.\nTo check that changes in prevalence rates over time were\nnot the result of changes in measurement, we conducted sen-\nsitivity analyses. We created a set of adjusted scoring algo-\nrithms to maximize comparability among the DISC-2.3,\nDISC-IV, and DIS-IV criteria while minimizing alterations\n(Author's Appendix [http://hdl.handle.net/2166/repo\n/teplin-0001]). All analyses were conducted twice, with and with-\nout these adjusted criteria. Because there were no substantive\ndifferences in findings and to enable comparisons with other\nstudies, we present the results using the original, unadjusted\ndiagnoses.\nPrevalence Rates of Disorder\nat Specific Times\nBecause some participants were interviewed more often than\nothers, we used a subset of interviews to summarize preva-\nlence rates at 3 time points: baseline (time 0), time 1, and\nTime 1. Time 1 is the first follow-up interview but excludes\ninterviews that occurred more than 18 months after the inter-\nview due date. Using a narrower window would restrict the gen-\neralizability of our findings because, in this high-risk and highly\nmobile population, participants can be difficult to track. The\nmedian time between baseline and time 1 was 3.0 years (mean\nrefer to the time 1 interview as occurring approximately 3 years\nafter baseline. As reported in eTable 1, which summarizes sample\ndemographics and retention rates, 90.7% of the participants had\na time 1 interview.\nTime 2. For each participant, time 2 consists of the earliest fol-\nlow-up interview that occurred approximately 4.5 years after\nbaseline. As with time 1, we excluded interviews that oc-\ncurred more than 18 months after this due date. The median\ntime between baseline and the time 2 interview was 4.7 years\nthat prevalence rates reflect temporally distinct cross-sections\nof the sample, we required at least 16 months between the time\n1 and time 2 interviews. We subsequently refer to the time 2\ninterviews as occurring approximately 5 years after baseline.\nAs reported in eTable 1, 85.3% of participants had a time 2\ninterview.\nTo generate prevalence rates that reflect CCJTDC's popu-\nlation, each participant was assigned a sampling weight aug-\nmented with a nonresponse adjustment to account for miss-\ning data.87 Taylor series linearization was used to estimate\nChanges in Prevalence Over Time\nWe used all available interviews, with an average of 3.9 inter-\nviews per person (range, 1-5 interviews per person); 88.7% of\nthe participants completed all scheduled interviews. Using gen-\neralized estimating equations (GEEs),90 we fit marginal mod-\nels examining (1) differences in the prevalence of disorders by\nsex and race/ethnicity over time and (2) changes in disorders\nas the youth aged. Disorder was modeled as binomial with a\nlogit link function. We used a robust sandwich estimator with\nan unstructured correlation matrix; in the few instances in which\nmodels failed to converge, we specified an exchangeable cor-\nrelation structure. All statistically significant (P.05) odds ra-\ntios contrasting sex and racial/ethnic differences are noted and\nwere determined using GEEs. Unless otherwise noted, these\nodds ratios contrast sex and race/ethnicity over time. Only 2\nsets of odds ratios--those examining persistence of disorders\nand those examining prevalence of disorders among partici-\npants living in the community--contrast sex and race/\nethnicity at single time points (time 1 or time 2). These were\nestimated using logistic regression.\nAll GEE models included covariates for sex, race/ethnicity\n(African American, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white), and ag-\ning (time since baseline). We also included age at baseline (10-18\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nyears) and legal status at detention (processed in juvenile or\nadult court) because they were stratification characteristics. The\n4 participants who identified themselves as other race/\nethnicity at baseline were excluded. We estimated models with\nquadratic terms for aging when the linear term was statisti-\ncally significant. When main effects were significant, we esti-\nmated models with the corresponding interaction terms. Only\ninteraction terms or quadratic aging terms that reached statis-\ntical significance were included in the final models. For mod-\nels with significant interactions between sex and aging, we re-\nport model-based odds ratios for sex differences at 3 and 5 years\nafter baseline. The GEE models were estimated with sampling\nweights to account for study design. We examined the sensi-\ntivity of our models to attrition by using weights that com-\nbined the probability of being sampled with the probability of\ndropping out.91 Results (available on request) were substan-\ntially similar.\nThe GEE analyses were conducted on disorders (with the\nimpairmentcriterion)exceptfor(1)schizophrenia,becausethere\nwere too few cases; (2) hypomania, because participants with\nthis disorder were significantly more likely to be missing fol-\nlow-up data than were those without the disorder (33.3% vs\n11.0%, P=.01); and (3) diagnoses assessed only for juveniles\n(attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and\noppositional defiant disorder) or adults (antisocial personal-\nity disorder), because nearly all participants became 18 years\nold or older during the follow-up period. Instead, we esti-\nmated changes over time in any disruptive behavior disorder,\ndefined as conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder\n(for participants aged 18 years) or antisocial personality dis-\norder (for participants aged 18 years).\nBecause detention may alter access to substances, all mod-\nels describing substance use disorders included linear and qua-\ndratic terms for time incarcerated prior to the interviews. When\nsubstance use disorder was measured at a follow-up inter-\nview, we used number of days incarcerated in the past year be-\ncause disorders were assessed in the past year. When sub-\nstance use disorder was measured at the baseline interview (and\ntherefore assessed in the past 6 months), we used time incar-\ncerated in the past 90 days, the best available estimate. All analy-\nses were conducted using commercial software (Stata 11; Stata-\nCorp) with its survey routines.92\nRESULTS\nPREVALENCE\nTable 1 and Table 2 report prevalence rates of disor-\nders--computed with and without the impairment cri-\nterion--at baseline, time 1, and time 2 for males and fe-\nmales.

For\nmost disorders, rates of persistence were higher at time\nSex Differences\nRegardless of sex, approximately 1 in 5 participants had\na mood disorder that persisted to time 2. Substance use\ndisorders were among the most persistent disorders for\nboth males and females but were significantly more likely\nto persist among males. Any disruptive behavior disor-\nder was also among the most persistent disorders in males\nand at time 2 was significantly more likely to persist in\nmales than in females.\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nAmong males, there were no significant racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the persistence of disorders (eTable 5).\nAmong females, there were several significant differ-\nences (eTable 6). At time 1, any substance use disorder\nand its subcategory, alcohol use disorder, had approxi-\nmately 3 times the odds of persisting among non-\nHispanic whites and Hispanics than among African Ameri-\ncans. At time 2, drug use disorders also had greater odds\nof persisting among non-Hispanic whites than among Afri-\ncan Americans.\nCOMMENT\nAlthough prevalence rates of most psychiatric disorders\ndeclined over time, a substantial proportion of delin-\nquent youth continued to have disorders as they aged.\nFor some youth, detention may coincide with a period\nof crisis that subsequently abates. Many youth, how-\never, continue to struggle: 5 years after detention, when\nparticipants were ages 14 to 24 years, nearly half of males\nand nearly 30% of females had 1 or more psychiatric dis-\norders with associated impairment.\nSubstance use and disruptive behavior disorders con-\ntinued to be the most common disorders. For many de-\nlinquent youth--especially males--externalizing disor-\nders were not limited to adolescence. Five years after\nbaseline, males had 2 to 3 times the odds of having sub-\nstance use and disruptive behavior disorders compared\nwith females. Furthermore, the disparity between males\nand females increased over time. Males were also more\nlikely than females to have persistent substance use dis-\norders and disruptive behavior disorder.\nThe observed sex differences in externalizing disor-\nders are consistent with those in the general population,\nwhere males are up to 10 times more likely than females\nto persist in antisocial behavior from childhood to adult-\nhood.93 Why might males fare worse than females? First,\ndelinquent males are less likely to receive services.94 Sec-\nond, delinquent males may have fewer opportunities to as-\nsume age-appropriate social roles (ie, jobs, postsecondary\nschooling)--turning points that might reduce problem be-\nMales\nFemales\nMDD\nMania\nMajor Mood\nPrevalence, %\nBaseline\nPTSD\nGAD\nPanic\nAnxiety\nBaseline\nFigure 1.

Perhaps substance abuse peaks earlier in delinquent\nyouth, coinciding with the general course of delinquent be-\nhavior.117,118 In contrast, general population youth may ex-\nperience events that increase the likelihood of substance\nabuse as they age,119,120 such as living in college dormito-\nries, freedom from social controls, and delays in assuming\nadult responsibilities such as parenting--events less likely\nto be experienced by delinquent youth.121\nIntermsofpersistence,themostrecentcomparablein-\nvestigation48 thatwasconductedintheUnitedStatesusing\nasampleofsimilarage-andDSM-basedcriteria(albeitdif-\nferentmeasures)foundlowerratesofpersistenceofdepres-\nsionanddisruptivebehaviordisordersthaninoursample.\n(Persistence of substance use disorders is not comparable\nbecausethedefinitionsdiffered;Copelandetal48 usedmore\nliberal impairment criteria and included nicotine.)\nMales\nFemales\nPrevalence, %\nDrug\nDBD\nAlc\nBaseline\nAfrican American Hispanic\nDrug\nDBD\nDBD\nAlc\nBaseline\nNon-Hispanic White\nDrug\nDBD\nALC\nBaseline\nFigure 2.

All rights reserved.\nLIMITATIONS\nOur data are subject to the limitations of self-report. More-\nover, it was not feasible to study more than one jurisdic-\ntion; because the prevalence of psychiatric disorders may\nlimited. We cannot know whether psychiatric disorders\nincrease the likelihood of arrest and detention or vice\nversa. Findings might have been marginally different had\nwe been able to use identical measures and time frames\nat the baseline and follow-up interviews. Rates would\nlikely have been higher had caretakers been available to\nprovide independent reports at baseline.15 At the fol-\nlow-up interviews, many participants were not eligible\nto have caretakers interviewed because the participants\nwere older than 17 years or did not live with a caretaker.\nAlthough retention rates were high, participants who\nmissed interviews might be more likely to have had dis-\norders than those who were found. Our findings do not\ntake into account mental health services that might have\nbeen provided. Despite these limitations, our findings have\nimplications for future research and mental health policy.\n1. Retain incarcerated persons in longitudinal studies\nofpsychiatricdisorders.Mostlarge-scalelongitudinalstud-\nies of the general population do not retain persons who\nbecome incarcerated by follow-up (eg, the National Epi-\ndemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [B.\norreinterviewtoofewtoanalyze(theEpidemiologicCatch-\nment Area Study [W. Eaton, PhD, oral communication,\nsystematically exclude persons who, as our study sug-\ngests, are likely to have psychiatric disorders and poor out-\ncomes. Excluding incarcerated persons biases prevalence\nrates, especially for African American males. At any given\nyears are incarcerated.71 To address health disparities, we\nmust include correctional populations, which have in-\ncreased from approximately 2 million in 2000 to nearly\n2. Add variables on incarceration history to general\npopulation studies. Although many studies examine the\nprevalence of psychiatric disorders in incarcerated\ncarceration on psychiatric disorders. We suggest that\ngeneral population epidemiologic surveys add the fol-\nlowing variables: number of incarcerations, age at time\nof incarceration, length of incarcerations, and experi-\nences in \"community corrections\" (parole, probation, and\ncommunity supervision). This strategy would generate\nnecessary information on how disproportionate confine-\nment of racial/ethnic minorities affects health dispari-\nties in psychiatric disorders and related outcomes.\n3. Include females in longitudinal studies of delin-\nquents. The sex differences observed in our study un-\nderscore that findings for males may not generalize to\nTable 3.

Future stud-\nies must include females and collect data on pregnancy,\nchildbirth, and child-rearing. We will then have the req-\nuisite empirical foundation to improve sex-specific men-\ntal health services, especially needed now that females\nconstitute an increasing proportion (now 30%128) of ju-\nvenile arrests.\n4. Examine variables that affect trajectories of disor-\nder in high-risk youth. Few studies of high-risk youth ex-\namine trajectories of disorder; fewer still examine how po-\ntentially modifiable risk and protective factors predict\ntrajectories of disorder. Future studies should investigate\nhowsocial,cognitive,andbiologicalfactorsinteracttoaffect\ntrajectories. For example, advances in neuroscience re-\nsearch provide unique opportunities to investigate how de-\nvelopmentaldifferencesinemotionregulationinteractwith\n1. Focus on delinquent males. In recent years, inno-\nvative programs funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice\nGirl Scouts in Detention Centers--addressed the needs\nnow improve services for males, who constitute 70% of\njuvenile arrests and 85% of youth in correctional facili-\nties.17,128 Our findings demonstrate that interventions for\nsubstance use and disruptive behavior disorders are es-\npecially needed. Comprehensive interventions, such as\nfunctional family therapy,137 multidimensional treat-\neffective. Continued development and dissemination of\nthese programs can further reduce illegal behaviors and\nprovide cost-effective alternatives to incarceration.140\n2. Assess and treat substance use disorders in correc-\ntional facilities and after release. Irrespective of sex or race/\nethnicity, alcohol and drug use disorders were among the\nmost common and persistent disorders. However, the need\nfor services far exceeds their availability. Approxi-\nmately one-half of youth in juvenile correctional facili-\nadult jails and prisons who need substance abuse treat-\nment do not receive it.141 Incarcerated adults fare much\nworse: summarizing Department of Justice statis-\ncluded that 80% to 85% of adult prisoners who needed\ntreatment for drug abuse did not receive it. After release\nback to the community, services may be difficult to ob-\ntain. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration reports, for example, that fewer than 10%\nlem\" received specialty services in the past year.\nDespite the potential of health care reform, the law\nmay not improve mental health services for persons like\nour participants, who may frequently cycle through cor-\nrectional facilities. Health care reform has no benefit to\nprisoners because federal law prohibits Medicaid pay-\nments for individuals--juvenile or adult--who are in-\nmates of public institutions.148 Incarceration disrupts com-\nmunity treatment and Medicaid benefits.149\nMoreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (PPACA) has limitations. First, although the Su-\npreme Court upheld most provisions of the PPACA,150 the\nlaw does not improve the deteriorating public health in-\ntions.Second,althoughthePPACAexpandsMedicaidben-\nefitstopersonswithincomesupto133%ofthefederalpov-\nerty level, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt\nout.155 The effect of the Supreme Court's ruling is not yet\nknown.Manypersonslikeourparticipantsarepoorenough\nto qualify for Medicaid even without the expansion. More-\nover,stateshavestrongfinancialincentivestoexpandMed-\nicaid.156,157 Thus, as of this writing, it is unclear how many\nadditional people would actually receive health care cov-\nerage. Since the Supreme Court's decision, the Congres-\nsional Budget Office158 projected that 30 million \"nonel-\nderly residents\"--such as undocumented immigrants and\npersons with low incomes who fail to enroll in Medic-\nmust improve services and access to care in corrections and\nin the community, where virtually all detained juveniles\nand incarcerated adults will eventually return.\nSubmitted for Publication: April 4, 2011; final revision re-\nAuthor Affiliations: Health Disparities and Public Policy\n(Drs Teplin, Welty, and Abram) and Division of Psy-\nchology (Dr Washburn), Department of Psychiatry and\nBehavioral Sciences (Drs Teplin, Welty, Abram, Dul-\ncan, and Washburn), and Department of Preventive Medi-\ncine (Dr Welty), Northwestern University Feinberg School\nof Medicine, Chicago, Illinois; Department of Child and\nAdolescent Psychiatry, Ann & Robert H.
