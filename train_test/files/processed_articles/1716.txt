A correlation was detected between areas of low\nSES and areas of high prevalence rates for gonorrhea and for chla-\nmydia. These areas clustered primarily downtown and in the northeast\npart of the city.\nConclusions: Nodes and corridors of activity in Calgary were\ndetected in correlation studies of the 2001 Census variables used. The\ncore (high prevalence) areas should be the areas targeted for sexually\ntransmitted infection prevention and control. This can be done at the\ncommunity level through measures such as more sexually transmitted\ninfection clinics operating with longer hours in areas identified from\nthis mapping.\nHISTORICALLY, GONORRHEA HAS been a nationally notifi-\nable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada since 1924.\nHowever, genital chlamydia infection is a more recently recog-\nnized disease: The Public Health Agency of Canada began national\nsurveillance in 1990.1 Since treatment for gonorrhea is not effec-\ntive against chlamydia, many people treated for gonorrhea had a\nconcomitant, silent chlamydia infection that remained untreated.2\nCanadian guidelines now recommend additional treatment for\nchlamydia when the presence of gonorrhea is suspected; however,\nchlamydia remains a ubiquitous disease.3\nIn the Calgary Health Region (CHR), gonorrhea and chlamydia\ndiagnoses increased after years of decline. Gonorrhea infections\nTransmission of an STI is not homogeneous across the popula-\ntion; for example, a few individuals are rapidly, frequently, or\nheavily infected whereas the majority of the population either\nevade infection or suffer infrequent or light infections.6\u00ad8 In STI\nclinics in Alberta, the highest rates of reportable STIs are found in\nthe 15- to 24-year-old age group and particularly in women.9\nInfections with chlamydia and gonorrhea are often difficult to\ndiagnose in women since they are frequently asymptomatic.10,11\nThis results in a higher risk of continued transmission due to such\nfactors as asymptomatic infections, failure to recognize symptoms\nof infection, and failure to seek diagnosis and treatment in a timely\nfashion.12 These factors may be influenced by high prevalence or\nexposure to prostitution, illicit drug use, low economic and aca-\ndemic achievement, low utilization or limited access to health care\nresources, and related socioeconomic and environmental factors.13\nThere are 2 main approaches to identifying groups who are at\nhigh risk of acquiring an STI: Identify individuals or identify high\nprevalence areas.14 Individuals with repeat infections (within a\n12-month period) or who are coinfected with gonorrhea and chla-\nmydia have been found to be useful markers for identifying indi-\nviduals at high risk of acquiring an STI.15 In general, it is difficult\nto identify individuals at high risk since most other characteristics\n[such as race, socioeconomic status (SES), or age] are risk markers for\nIn addition, the individuals comprising high-prevalence groups\noften do not present to the health care system for testing or for\ntreatment; hence, they continue to transmit the disease. The other\nstrategy is to identify key geographic areas where STI transmission\nrates are highest through mapping of STI prevalence rates. This\ngeographic clustering of STI infections probably results from the\nexistence of localized sexual networks at the neighborhood level.\nSTI control programs targeting these areas will then theoretically\nGeographic information systems (GIS) are software tools that\nallow for the processing of spatial data for visualization and\nexploratory data analysis.14,17 Spatial analysis is the ability to\nmanipulate spatial data (such as Postal Codes, PCs) into different\nforms and extract additional meaning as a result. Layers of data,\nsuch as geographic location, type of STI, and SES variables, can be\nentered into a GIS and a map generated to identify statistically\nsignificant clusters of disease.14\nCorrespondence: K.

Patients attending the STI clinic are\ntested because they may be symptomatic and seeking medical\nattention or may be asymptomatic contacts of an index case of STI.\nOther patients seen through the Family Planning Clinic or in the\nremainder of the health care system (private physicians, walk-in\nclinics, and hospital emergency rooms) are primarily tested for STI\nbecause they present with symptoms, are tested for routine STI\nscreening, or are tested at the patient's request. The STI Services\nsurveillance database also contains data from any positive diag-\nnostic test performed by Calgary Laboratory Services or by the\nProvincial Laboratory of Public Health (Microbiology) for south-\nern Alberta.\nThe study population was extracted from the Alberta Health and\nWellness STI surveillance database and consisted of all individuals\nreported as having a diagnosis of gonorrhea between January 1,\nincluded who had a valid PC within the Calgary city limits. Only\nthose individuals with a diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhea were\nincluded: individuals with other STIs such as nongonococcal ure-\nthritis were excluded from the study population.\nThe STI data were imported into the GIS, ArcView 8.1\n(ArcGIS, ESRI, Redlands CA). The Statistics Canada Postal Code\nConversion File was used to link the cleaned STI data to geo-\ngraphic coordinates in order to map the data in the GIS software.\nThe Postal Code Conversion File is a digital file that provides a\nlink between the 6 character PC and Statistics Canada's standard\ngeographical areas for which Census data are produced. It also\nprovides the x, y (latitude/longitude) coordinates for a point rep-\nresenting the approximate location of the PC to support mapping.18\nThe numbers of cases were then aggregated first at the PC level\nand then at the Census Tract level. Rates of chlamydia and gon-\norrhea per 100,000 population were calculated at the Census Tract\nlevel. The STI rates were then converted to core (top 25% of rates),\nadjacent (next 25% of the rates), and peripheral (bottom 50% of\nthe rates) categories and plotted on the map of the CHR, replicat-\nThe core model break points were analyzed spatially to deter-\nmine the pattern of core, adjacent, and peripheral areas for chla-\nmydia and gonorrhea in the CHR. Spatial analysis was performed\nusing CrimeStat, a program provided on the Internet by the United\nStates Department of Justice for \"hotspot\" analysis of GIS data\n(www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/crimestat.html). The program an-\nalyzed the distribution of gonorrhea or chlamydia cases by PC\nusing nearest neighbor hierarchical spatial clustering.\nData from the Canadian 2001 Census were used to estimate\nmobility, marital status, presence of detached houses in the Census\nTract, employment rate, university education, lone female parent,\nmedian household income, proportion of population 15 to 40\nyears, and owning a dwelling for Calgary Census Tracts (Statistics\nCanada, Microdata Release File). Pearson's correlation coeffi-\ncients were calculated at the Census Tract level to look for eco-\nlogical associations between the calculated STI rates and the\nsocioeconomic rates derived from the 2001 Census data. The data\nwere aggregated such that at least 5 cases of chlamydia or gonor-\nrhea occurred for each geographic aggregation to provide stable\nrates for comparison and to mask individuals to preserve anonym-\nity.10 The aggregation was performed visually by clustering Cen-\nsus Tracts that were spatially close together and considering their\nsimilarity in SES variables from the 2001 Census. The correspond-\ning Census data for the clustered Census Tracts were then likewise\naggregated.\nResults\nAlberta is a province in Canada with a population of approxi-\nmately 3.2 million people. Calgary is the larger of the 2 main\ncenters in the province, with a population of nearly 1 million. The\n2001 Canadian Census shows that Calgary is a young, wealthy,\nand well-educated city. The city has experienced the largest pop-\nulation increase of all the large Canadian centers when compared\nwith the last Census done in 1996 with nearly 16% growth. The\nmedian age of the population is the youngest at 34.9 years, while\nmedian family income at $58,861 is amongst the highest in Canada.\nThere were a total of 7456 records after the data cleaning was\nthrough a valid residential PC to geographic coordinates and were\n21%) could not be linked because a valid PC was not included with\nthe STI data. These were unmapped because the address given was\nfor the Calgary STI Clinic or a Post Office box (19.7%) or because\nthe PC given was incorrect (1.3%).\nOverall, the mapped and unmapped cases were similar, indicat-\ning no bias in the mapped populations for chlamydia or gonorrhea.\nThere were more females in the mapped populations than in the\nunmapped populations for both chlamydia and gonorrhea with\nWithin the mapped population, major differences were seen in\nthe demographic characteristics of individuals diagnosed with\nchlamydia and gonorrhea (Table 1). The chlamydia population was\ncomprised of younger people (23.6 years vs. 27.9 years) and more\nfemales (69.6%) than the gonorrhea population (37.1%). Differ-\nTABLE 1. Comparison of Mapped Gonorrhea and Chlamydia\nCases\nMapped\nGonorrhea Cases\nMapped\nChlamydia Cases\nEthnicity\nAll values inside parentheses indicate percentages, unless otherwise\nspecified.\nences in ethnic origin reported were also significant but since a\nhigh proportion of the population did not provide this information,\nthe data should be viewed with caution.\nTo describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the Calgary\npopulation, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated. A\npattern of correlations emerged for the 11 independent variables\nchosen from the 2001 Canadian Census data. Areas reporting a\nlarger population between 15 and 40 years of age also were\npositively correlated with a reported move within the past 5 years,\nindicating Calgary has a young, mobile population. These same\nareas were negatively correlated with having a high median in-\ncome, being married and owning a home, indicating that this\nyoung population is more likely to be single and rent. A positive\ncorrelation existed between a high median income, being married,\nowning a dwelling, and the presence of a high proportion of\ndetached houses in the geographic area. Areas with a high lone\nfemale parent population also reported lower university atten-\ndance.\nIn the analysis of correlations of SES variables from the 2001\nCanadian Census, variables indicating high SES (high median\nhousehold income, owning a dwelling, lower housing density,\nmarried) were found to be highly correlated with each other. These\nhigh SES variables occurred in suburban Census Tracts in Calgary.\nSimilarly, variables indicating lower SES (single mothers, lower\neducation, high housing density, renters, single marital status)\nwere also found to be highly correlated with each other. These low\nSES variables tended to be located in the downtown and northeast\n(NE) quadrant of the city.\nCorrelations between sociodemographic characteristics and the\nchlamydia and gonorrhea rates were found indicating some eco-\nlogical associations (Table 2). For each a strong positive correlation\nexists between STI and a young population (population between 15\nand 40 years of age) and the presence of lone single female parent\nin the Census Tract. High rates of gonorrhea correlated with areas\nthat had a higher proportion of males in the Census Tract. Strong\nnegative correlations were found between the areas with high\nchlamydia or gonorrhea rates and high income, being married, the\npresence of detached houses, and owning a dwelling.\nThe core (top 25% of chlamydia and gonorrhea rates), adjacent\n(next 25% of the chlamydia and gonorrhea rates), and peripheral\n(bottom 50% of the chlamydia and gonorrhea rates) points were\nplotted on the map of the CHR. The maps are presented in Figures\n1 and 2. Hotspot analysis using the CrimeStat program showed a\nsignificant clustering of PCs with high rates of gonorrhea near the\ndowntown, whereas there was a significant clustering of PCs with\nhigh rates of chlamydia near the downtown and in the NE quad-\nrant. Outlier points with high rates were seen in the suburban areas\nfor each map.\nThe Census Tracts with high rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea\ninfection positively correlate with the low SES variables and\nnegatively correlate with the high SES variables. Those areas with\ntop 25% of STI rates (core areas) had the lowest SES while those\nareas with bottom 50% of STI rates (peripheral areas) have the\nhighest SES.\nDiscussion\nThere were no significant differences in age between the mapped\nand unmapped populations with gonorrhea or chlamydia, and\nwomen were more likely to report a mappable PC than men.\nHowever, the mapped population with chlamydia had more fe-\nmales and was younger than the mapped gonorrhea population.\nOne possible explanation is that gonorrhea is often symptomatic in\nmen and so men may present for gonorrhea testing more frequently\nthan do women. Additionally, women may be screened for chla-\nmydia more frequently than men are since there are often oppor-\ntunities for screening (such as pregnancy and PAP smear testing)\nthat do not occur for men. Men who have sex with men is an\nimportant population for gonorrhea,13 but was not a 2001 Census\nvariable and was not investigated in this study. Other studies have\nshown no significant differences in the ages of their study popu-\nlations with chlamydia and with gonorrhea,19,20 but this may be an\nartefact of the chosen study populations in those centers, such as\nonly specialty STI clinic patients, rather than the population-based\nsample for this study.\nThe significant SES variables were not fundamentally different\nfor the chlamydia and gonorrhea positive populations (Table 2).\nJolly et al. have shown differences between these populations,\nperhaps indicating multiple reservoirs of infection.21 Further in-\nvestigations using a qualitative study design may be needed to\ndetermine if Calgary's core members have stronger network con-\nnections than was seen in other centers and whether the similarities\nwere the result of exposure to a single reservoir of infection\npresent in the CHR.\nCensus Tracts with a high prevalence of chlamydia and gonor-\nrhea (core areas) were associated with low SES. Individuals in the\npopulations from these core areas were more likely to be male,\nsingle, have low income, and be less educated than those from the\nperipheral area populations. Frohlich found a similar association\nbetween low SES variables and other socially unacceptable behav-\niors in Quebec.22 In addition to being a marker of low SES, living\nin single-parent families has also been associated with earlier onset\nof sexual activity, which is another risk factor for STIs.23 Although\nthese associations are ecological, the core area pattern of high\ndensity housing and low SES has been widely reported in the\nical risk of exposure to STIs that is independent of individual risk\nSpatial analysis of the maps of chlamydia and gonorrhea prev-\nalence rates showed that the core (high prevalence) areas clustered\nin the downtown core and NE section of the city (Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe adjacent (intermediate prevalence) rates were geographically\ncloser to the core areas whereas the peripheral (low prevalence)\nrates primarily appeared in the suburban Census Tracts. There\nwere some outlier core (high prevalence) areas seen in suburban\nCensus Tracts in the south and Northwest sections of the city. This\nmay be a result of mapping the residential PCs of people with\nTABLE 2. 2001 Census Variables/STI Rate Correlation Results\nChlamydia Rate\nr (P)\nGonorrhea Rate\nr (P)\nPearson's correlation coefficient (r) and P value (significant at 0.05).\nItems presented in bold have r  0.55 or r  0.55, indicating a\npositive or negative correlation exists.\nUniversity indicates population 20 listing university as highest\nschooling.\nreported gonorrhea and chlamydia infection and may not reflect\nthe areas in the CHR where infection was actually acquired.\nThe pattern of core (high-prevalence) areas for STIs follows the\npattern of low SES areas within the CHR. The finding of the pre-\ndominant core (high-prevalence) areas occurring in areas of the\nCHR with lower SES Census Tracts seems intuitive since it is well\nof high-prevalence STI areas is supported by the Calgary data\nwhere several core (high prevalence STI) areas were detected.\nBlanchard et al.15 detected core (high-prevalence), adjacent (inter-\nmediate prevalence), and peripheral (low prevalence) areas in\nWinnipeg based on average annual incidence rates for gonorrhea\nand chlamydia. They found that the 4 PCs in the downtown that\ncomprised the core areas for gonorrhea and for chlamydia over-\nlapped. The Winnipeg core (high-prevalence) area had high pop-\nulation density with greater mobility, higher unemployment rates,\nlower mean household incomes, and a higher proportion of male\nresidents than the peripheral areas. Becker et al.6 repeated this\nstudy in Baltimore and found the core area covered a larger\nproportion of the city than in Winnipeg and clustered in 2 primary\nareas. In these studies and the CHR study, the adjacent (lower-\nprevalence) areas were found at the edge of the core areas and the\nperipheral (low-prevalence) areas were outside of the adjacent areas.\nSTI prevention and control activities typically target decreasing\nthe number of new sexual partners and exposed individuals (e.g.,\nthrough increased condom usage), and decreasing the duration of\ndisease through effective diagnosis and treatment of STIs.27,28 To\ndate, provision of diagnostic services and educating at-risk popu-\nlations have been key control strategies for both chlamydia and\ngonorrhea.28 The core model of STI transmission suggests that\ndirecting efforts towards members of a core (high-prevalence STI)\ngroup yields the largest decrease in STI rates. However, commu-\nFig. 1.

Total gonorrhea rate\ndata) for the Calgary Health Region.\nThis study relied on an objective data source for STI informa-\ntion and did not rely on self-reporting, which is notorious for errors\nin reporting of socially sensitive diseases. The cases were reported\nas part of Alberta's legislated public health reporting requirements\nfrom the entire CHR by physicians and laboratories. Completeness\nof the data are critical to ensure that case detection is representa-\ntive of the population at large.35 Quartiles of the rates were used to\nprovide an objective definition for the core (high prevalence),\nadjacent (intermediate), and peripheral (low) areas. Other re-\nsearchers have used subjective, visual aggregations of the STI\nprevalence rates but this may not be reproducible in all settings.15\nThis study was an important first step to establish a baseline of the\nspatial pattern of gonorrhea and chlamydia in the CHR. STI\nsurveillance activities can be supplemented by repeating the study\nto determine if there has been a change in the geographic pattern\nof chlamydia and gonorrhea over time. This study is a valuable\naddition to what was known by the CHR and by Alberta Health\nand Wellness about the status of STI infections in Alberta's largest\nurban centre. This study also added valuable information to help\nguide program delivery and the allocation of resources in the core\ngeographic areas of high chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence for\nprevention and control of STIs in the CHR.\nThe rates found in this study, although high in some areas, were\nunderestimates of the true rates. The STI services database con-\ntains only detected cases; therefore, asymptomatic and undetected\ncases are not represented. Unmapped cases were not included in\nthe numerator, and so there was an underestimate of the number of\nSTI cases. Underreporting by physicians in areas of high SES has\nbeen estimated at 30% to 50%, suggesting that the true rates were\nhigher than reported11,34 and rendered the core (high prevalence) area\nrates and low SES association weaker. The denominator used for rate\ncalculations was the whole population of each CT. It can be argued\nthat a smaller population of those most likely to be sexually active\nwith multiple partners (i.e., the 15\u00ad39 years of age population) should\nbe used to more closely approximate the true STI prevalence rate.6\nThis study design involved mapping the individuals' residential\nPC. This location was not necessarily where sexual activity had\ntaken place. This may account for some of the high-prevalence\n(core) rates that were visible outside the main clusters. Addition-\nally, if all the unmapped cases resided in the same areas, this\nwould have skewed the locations of the core (high-prevalence) rate\npoints. Geocoding was performed using the Postal Code Conver-\nsion File and then rates were aggregated to the Census Tract level,\nwhich reduced potential error in the true geospatial location of\nindividual PCs.36 Although rate stabilization in small geographic\nareas in public health research is an issue,37 the choice of aggre-\ngation to 5 cases was primarily to preserve individual's anonymity\nin Census Tracts where there were fewer than 5 cases.\nMedical geography serves to increase consciousness about the\ncommunity and environment as determinants of health.38 In this\nstudy, the community may be a marker of other characteristics that\nplace people at high risk of acquiring and transmitting STIs, such\nas low SES, low education, close proximity to geographic core\n(high prevalence) areas, and an increased likelihood of selecting a\ncore group member as a sexual partner.\nReferences\n1.
