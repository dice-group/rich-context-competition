    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many immigrants in the United States are working-age\ntaxpayers; few are elderly beneficiaries of Medicare. This demographic\nprofile suggests that immigrants may be disproportionately subsidizing\nthe Medicare Trust Fund, which supports payments to hospitals and\ninstitutions under Medicare Part A. For immigrants and others, we\ntabulated Trust Fund contributions and withdrawals (that is, Trust Fund\nexpenditures on their behalf) using multiple years of data from the\nCurrent Population Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. In\naccounted for only 7.9 percent of its expenditures--a net surplus of\n$13.8 billion. In contrast, US-born people generated a $30.9 billion\ndeficit. Immigrants generated surpluses of $11.1\u00ad$17.2 billion per year\n$115.2 billion. Most of the surplus from immigrants was contributed by\nnoncitizens and was a result of the high proportion of working-age\ntaxpayers in this group. Policies that restrict immigration may deplete\nMedicare's financial resources.\nPoliticians and others are concerned\nthat Medicare might not be sustain-\nable, given current projections of\nhealth care spending growth, the\nsurge in enrollment driven by the\naging baby-boom generation, and the dimin-\nished size of the working-age population paying\ninto the program through payroll taxes. The role\nthat immigrants play in funding Medicare and\ntheir use of the program is not well understood.\nBecause Medicare accounts for 21 percent of all\nannual US health care expenditures,1 knowing\nmoreprecisely how immigrantsfactor into Medi-\ncare revenues and expenditures is important to\nongoing policy discussions.\nMedicare is financed through general reve-\nnues, payroll taxes, beneficiary premiums, and\nother sources, including taxes on Social Security\nbenefits and payments from states. Medicare has\ntwo trust funds, the Hospital Insurance Trust\nFund and the Supplementary Medical Insur-\nance Trust Fund.2 The Hospital Insurance (HI)\nTrust Fund primarily finances inpatient care\nthrough Medicare Part A; it receives most of\nitsincome frompayroll taxesand intereston past\nsurpluses generated from those taxes. The\nSupplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust\nFund primarily pays for Medicare Part B, which\ncovers physician services (both inpatient and\noutpatient) and outpatient care. Despite its\nname, the SMI Trust Fund is not a trust fund in\nthe usual sense of the term; it is fully funded an-\nnually by enrollee premiums and yearly congres-\nsional appropriations from general revenues.\nThe most recent annual report from the\nMedicare Board of Trustees projected that the\npoint, revenues and assets will not be sufficient\nto cover the full costs of the Medicare program.\nStudies have found that immigrants use less\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nLeah Zallman (lzallman@\nchalliance.org) is a junior\nscientist at the Institute for\nCommunity Health at\nCambridge Health Alliance and\nan instructor of medicine at\nHarvard Medical School, in\nBoston, Massachusetts.\nSteffie Woolhandler is a\nprofessor of public health at\nthe City University of New\nYork, in New York City.\nDavid Himmelstein is a\nprofessor of public health at\nthe City University of New\nYork.\nDavid Bor is the Charles S.\nDavidson Associate Professor\nof Medicine at Harvard\nMedical School.\nDanny McCormick is an\nassistant professor of\nmedicine at Harvard Medical\nSchool.\nWeb First\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We then calculated\nthe net trust fund surpluses or deficits attribut-\nable to each group.\nStudy Data And Methods\nData Sources We determined HI Trust Fund\ncontributions from the March supplements to\nthe Current Population Survey(CPS) for 2003\u00ad\ndents). The CPS, conducted jointly by the Census\nBureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pro-\nvides nationally representative data for the\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population.6 Each\nyear's survey includes questions on personal in-\ncome for the previous calendar year, as well as on\nplace of birth and citizenship status.\nWe determined Medicare expenditures using\n(MEPS) conducted by the Agency for Healthcare\nResearch and Quality (our 2009 sample included\nnativity status). This survey provides detailed\nhealth care spending data for a representative\nsample of the civilian noninstitutionalized pop-\nulation and enables the identification of Medi-\ncare expenditures.\nWe linked data from MEPS to data from the\nNational Health Interview Survey (from which\nthe MEPS sample is drawn) to confirm nativity\nand citizenship status. A detailed description of\nour definitions and data sources appears in the\nonline Appendix.7\nContributions, Expenditures, Surpluses,\nAnd Deficits The CPS includes detailed individ-\nual-level income data, allowing us to calculate\nimmigrants' and others' shares of 2009 tax con-\ntributions to the HI Trust Fund. Most contribu-\ntions are from payroll taxes, but some are from\nincome taxes on Social Security benefits col-\nlected from higher-income beneficiaries. The\nAppendix provides details of our HI Trust Fund\ncontribution and expenditure calculations.7\nSMI Trust Fund spending is not paid for by the\nHI Trust Fund and hence was not used in our\ncalculations of trust fund finances. However, we\nalso report immigrants' and others' shares of\nmost categories of this spending (see the\nAppendix for details).7\nTo generate dollar estimates for HI Trust Fund\ncontributions and expenditures, we multiplied\nimmigrants' and nonimmigrants' shares of total\ncontributions and expenditures by the Medicare\nTrustees' estimates of total 2009 HI Trust Fund\nrevenues and expenditures.8 We calculated each\ngroup's total net surplus or deficit by subtracting\nits HI Trust Fund expenditures from its HI Trust\nFund contributions. In calculating per capita fig-\nures, we used CPS data to estimate population\nfigures. Finally, we repeated our analysis sepa-\nrately for citizen and noncitizen immigrants as\nwell as for two age groups, people ages 18\u00ad64 and\npeople ages 65 and older.\nAlthough we report results principally for\n2009, we replicated all analyses for each year\nStatistical Analysis We determined signifi-\ncance using chi-square tests for proportions and\nlinear regressions for dollar estimates (includ-\ning time trends). As explained in the Appendix,7\nwe performed sensitivity analyses employing al-\nternative regression modeling strategies that\nmight be appropriate for highly skewed data\nsuch as health expenditures. These yielded vir-\ntually identical results. The Institutional Review\nBoard of Cambridge Health Alliance exempted\nthis study from review.\nLimitations Several limitations of our study\nshould be noted. Our data may undercount non-\ncitizens' surplus since undocumented immi-\ngrants may avoid government surveys such as\nthe Current Population Survey. The impact of\nthis possible undercount on our estimate of pay-\nroll tax contributions is hard to quantify. How-\never, the Social Security Administration's Office\nof the Chief Actuary estimated that undocu-\nmented immigrants contributed a net of $12 bil-\nlion to the Social Security Retirement Trust Fund\npayroll tax goes to Medicare and four-fifths to\nSocial Security, the estimate suggests that un-\ndocumented immigrants' net contribution to\nMedicare is about $2.5 billion. Although un-\ndocumented immigrants are probably also\nunderrepresented in the MEPS data, this should\nhave little impact on our findings since Medicare\nexpenditures on their behalf are minimal.\nWe conservatively credited revenue from HI\nTrust Fund interest to immigrants in proportion\nto their tax contributions in 2009. However, in-\nterest accrues on surpluses from prior years.\nHence, crediting interest in proportion to past\nsurpluses would raise our estimate of immi-\ngrants' share of HI Trust Fund contributions.\nConversely, we assumed that other sources of\nHI Trust Fund revenues, such as general tax rev-\nenue and premiums, were proportional to rev-\nenue from payroll taxes.

On the expenditure side, we made\nthe intuitively reasonable but unproven assump-\ntion that immigrants' share of skilled nursing\nfacility and hospice expenditures, which are not\nincluded in the MEPS data, were proportional\nto their share of inpatient, home health, and\nMedicare Advantage expenditures.\nStudy Results\nPopulation In 2009 immigrants constituted\n13.6 percent of the US population, according\nto the CPS. As expected for two nationally\nrepresentative samples, the CPS and MEPS sam-\nples had similar demographic characteristics,\nincluding age, sex, race or ethnicity, insurance,\nnativity, citizenship status, and number of years\nin the United States (Exhibit 1).\nContributions, Expenditures, And Net\nSurplus Or Deficit By Nativity Status In\nthe HI Trust Fund, or 14.7 percent of all contri-\nbutions, and were responsible for $19.3 billion of\nits expenditures, or 7.9 percent (Exhibit 2).\nImmigrants accounted for 4.8 percent of hospi-\ntalization expenditures; 14.2 percent of home\nhealth expenditures (a figure that is based on\nsmall numbers and should be interpreted cau-\ntiously); and 11.8 percent of trust fund ex-\npenditures on Medicare Advantage premiums.\nAmong Medicare enrollees, average expendi-\nthan for the US-born ($5,388)--a difference that\nwas of borderline significance (p \u00bc 0:05).\nImmigrants generated a trust fund surplus of\ngenerated a deficit of $30.9 billion.

For the older group, the figures in both\ncases were deficits rather than surpluses:\nimmigrants.\nImmigrants accounted for 10.6 percent of SMI\nTrust Fund expenditures, including 11.3 percent\nof Medicare Advantage premiums, 14.2 percent\nof home health agency expenditures (an esti-\nmate based on small numbers), 10.8 percent of\nprescription drug expenditures, 6.8 percent of\nphysician expenditures, and 7.8 percent of out-\npatient (including emergency department)\nexpenditures.

As noted above, we did not use\nthese expenditures in our calculation of HI Trust\nFund finances.\nTrends Over Time In each of the years from\nto the HI Trust Fund (Exhibit 4), generating a\ntotal surplus of $115.2 billion during the period.\nTheir contributions remained largely unchanged\nover time. During the same period, the net trust\nfund contributions (contributions minus ex-\npenditures) for US-born people declined, gener-\nating a deficit of $28.1 billion.\nDiscussion\nImmigrants, particularly noncitizens, heavily\nsubsidize Medicare. In 2009 immigrants con-\ntributed $13.8 billion more to the HI Trust\nFund than it paid out on their behalf (Exhibit 4).\nMost of this surplus came from noncitizens.\nsurplus contributions totaled $115.2 billion.\nImmigrants pay into the HI Trust Fund in sev-\neral ways. Those with legal status contribute\nthrough payroll taxes under valid Social Secu-\nrity numbers. Undocumented immigrants often\npay payroll taxes under Social Security numbers\ntied to invented names or belonging to someone\nelse,9 because to comply with federal law employ-\ners must obtain a Social Security number from\nevery employee. Less frequently, undocumented\nimmigrantspay self-employmenttaxes (inlieu of\npayroll taxes) under individual tax identification\nnumbers, which allows them to claim credit for\ntheir contributions should they eventually ob-\ntain legal status.10\nImmigrants generate a surplus for Medicare\nprimarily because so many of them are working-\nage adults and the group has a high labor-force\nparticipationrate--a combination thatgenerates\nlarge payroll tax payments. Our analysis of the\n2010 CPS data showed that noncitizen immi-\ngrants were younger and more likely to be of\nworking age than were citizen immigrants,\nwhich is not surprising given that it takes years\nto become a naturalized citizen. This partially\nexplains noncitizen immigrants' particularly\nlarge HI Trust Fund surpluses.\nIn 2009 the dependency ratio--the ratio of\nworking-age to retirement-age people, or those\nages 18\u00ad64 to older people--among immigrants\nNoncitizen immigrants had a particularly high\nMedicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Contributions And Expenditures And Share Of US\nPopulation, Immigrants And US-Born, 2009\nSOURCE Authors' analysis of data from the 2010 Current Population Survey and 2009 Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey.\nMedicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Per Capita Contributions And Expenditures, 2009,\nAll Immigrants, Noncitizen Immigrants, And US-Born\nDollars\nContribution Surplus\nExpenditure\nUS-born All immigrants Noncitizen immigrants\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\nSOURCE Authors' analysis of data from the 2010 Current Population Survey and 2009 Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey.

Because many noncitizens eventu-\nally become naturalized at older ages, this last\nestimate is biased upward. Although individual\nimmigrants may have lower lifetime earnings\nthan US-born people, depending on their age\nat arrival, the high proportion of working-age\nadult immigrants results in large excess pay-\nments to the HI Trust Fund.\nThe recent drop in Mexican immigration11 and\nthe overall aging of the US population may even-\ntually reduce immigrants' dependency ratio, and\nhence their surplus contributions to Medicare.\nHowever, this source of surplus contributions\nseems likely to continue for some time. The\ndependency ratio among immigrants did not fall\nsis of CPS data; the large cohort of Mexican im-\nreach retirement age for decades; immigration\nof mostly working-age individuals from Asia con-\ntinues to grow;12,13 and the Census Bureau pro-\njects that net immigration (both absolutely and\nas a share of the US population) will continue to\nincrease for the next eighteen years and will be\nSeveral factors other than age likely play a role\nin immigrants' Medicare surplus. First, some\nimmigrants who are eligible for Medicare may\nnot use it because they retire to their country of\norigin.16 Elderly immigrants may be ineligible for\nMedicare because they have not worked the re-\nquired forty quarter-years in the United States,17\nlack legal status, or--if they are legal residents--\ndo not meet the five-year (legal) residency re-\nquirement of the Personal Responsibility and\nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.\nImmigrants also cost Medicare less--a conse-\nquence of both their lower rates of enrollment\nand their lower expenditures once enrolled.\nThese lower expenditures may reflect the under-\nrepresentation of immigrants among the \"oldest\nold,\" those ages eighty-five and older. Differenc-\nes in health status per se probably don't explain\nthese findings: Although immigrants arrive in\nthe United States healthier than the US-born,18\nimmigrants' health advantage has eroded by age\nHowever, poor access to care among elderly\nimmigrants may play a role in their low use of\nMedicare.19 Previous studies have found that\nimmigrants--especially noncitizens20--use less\nhealth care than do the US-born.3,4,21 This dispar-\nity has remained largely unchanged over time5\nand has been observed among the publicly\ninsured, the privately insured, and the un-\nOur 2009 findings are not an anomaly. Im-\nmigrants provided surpluses to the HI Trust\n(Exhibit 4), and this surplus was relatively\nconstant.\nOur study is the first of which we are aware to\nquantify immigrants' share of contributions,\nand therefore the net surplus or deficit provided\nby immigrants, to a US health care sector. The\nsurplus, if any, that immigrants provide to the\nhealth care system as a whole--or to programs\nother than Medicare--is not known. Although\nmost political discourse regarding immigrant\nhealth care financing has focused on uncompen-\nsated care, that care accounts for a far smaller\nproportion of nationalhealthcarespending than\nImmigrants may withdraw more resources\nthan they contribute to some government ser-\nvices. However, our finding that immigrants\nheavily subsidize the HI Trust Fund should\nraise skepticism about the widespread assump-\ntion that immigrants consistently drain public\nresources.\nConclusion\nHaving ourselves witnessed immigrants dying\nneedlessly because of lack of health care, we\n(and many of our colleagues) are motivated by\nthe belief that all patients have a human right to\nNet Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Surplus Or Deficit Attributable To Immigrants,\nSOURCE: Authors' analysis of data from the 2010 Current Population Survey and 2009 Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

But economic concerns--including\nthe worry that immigrants are driving up US\nhealth care costs--have often dominated the de-\nbate over immigration. Our data offer a new per-\nspective on these economic concerns.\nPolicies that reduce immigration would almost\ncertainly weaken Medicare's financial health,\nwhile an increasing flow of immigrants might\nbolster its sustainability. Because Social Secu-\nrity's eligibility criteria and payroll tax\u00adbased\nfunding closely track those of Medicare, our\nfindings support the argument that immigration\nhelps sustain Social Security.\nProviding a path to citizenship for currently\nundocumented immigrants would affect Medi-\ncare's finances in multiple ways. It would likely\nincrease payroll tax collections by reducing\nimmigrants' \"off the books\" employment and\nremoving barriers that keep them out of higher-\npaying jobs. But in the long term it would prob-\nably increase the number of immigrants eligible\nfor Medicare, and hence expenditures on their\nbehalf.\nHowever, the age structure of the immigrant\npopulation is far more important than either of\nthese factors. Encouraging a steady flow of\nyoung immigrants would help offset the aging\nof the US population and the health care financ-\ning challenge that it presents. \nThe authors report no conflicts of\ninterest.
