A theme running through\nthis literature has been the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing, which I refer\nto as the two-stage assumption. Under this assumption, slopes of set-size and response time are\nused to determine whether attention is needed for a given task or not. Even though a lot of\nfindings question this two-stage assumption, it still has enormous influence, determining decisions\non whether papers are published or research funded. The results described here show that the\ntwo-stage assumption leads to very different conclusions about the operation of attention for\nidentical search tasks based only on changes in response (presence/absence versus Go/No-go\nresponses). Slopes are therefore an ambiguous measure of attentional involvement. Overall, the\nresults suggest that the two-stage model cannot explain all findings on visual search, and they\nhighlight how slopes of response time and set-size should only be used with caution.\n",

The paradigm was designed to assess the function of visual attention (Neisser, 1963;\nTreisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, 1998) and the operation of early visual cortical areas\n(Julesz, 1981; Nakayama & Martini, 2011). But its' subsequent reach has been far wider\nthan this, and key assumptions about attention derived from an outdated understanding\nof the paradigm are used as blueprints for inference in many disciplines.\nIn the vast majority of visual search studies, performance is assessed with response times.\nTypically, the task is to determine whether a target is present or absent. Search slopes that\nmeasure how response times change as more distractors are added to the display are\npresumed to assess the speed of the search and whether attention is involved. If the slopes\nare around zero, the common assumption is that the target can be detected preattentively,\nwhile if search times increase with set-size, this is considered to reflect that attention moves\naround the search array, seeking the target. Even if an overall change in mean is observed, it\nCorresponding author:\nA\n\u00b4 rni Kristja\n\u00b4nsson, Department of Psychology, School of Health Sciences, University of Iceland, Oddi 113, Reykjavi\nIceland.\nEmail: ak@hi.is\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.us.\nsagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\nis not thought to reflect the operation of attention if slopes are constant. I will refer to this\npreattentive or attentive distinction as the two-stage assumption.\nA common finding is that when a target differs from distractors on a single feature search\nslopes are around 0, reflecting that search is unaffected by the number of distractors in a\ndisplay. Conjunction searches where the target shares features with each distractor type often\nresult in inefficient search where response times (RT's) increase by 10 to 50 ms with each\nWhile this logic is in many ways attractive, note importantly that it is a testable assumption\nabout visual attention (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, Cave,\n& Franzel, 1989). Other models of visual search have been proposed that do not involve the\ntwo-stage assumption, such as parallel models (Eckstein, 1998; Palmer, 1995), serial\nexhaustive models (Sternberg, 1975), and models that postulate a race for recognition by\nparallel processing of bottom\u00adup and top\u00addown information (Bundesen & Habekost, 2008).\nApproaches that assume that observers adapt to the search environment, such as with\nBayesian updating of preferences and biases (e.g. Vincent, 2015) also show promise in\naccounting for the operation of visual attention. All these approaches bypass the serial or\nparallel distinction (see also Wolfe, 2007).\nThe Problem\nThe standard two-stage assumption of visual search is often used to infer facts about visual\nattention but many researchers overlook that it is exactly that--an assumption. Slopes of\nresponse times versus set-size are used to decide whether visual attention is involved or not: If\na particular manipulation affects slopes, this is thought to reflect attentional processing, but\nunchanged slopes reflect that the manipulation does not affect attention. Note that this is\noften taken beyond reason through circular reasoning: If search slopes for a given task are\naround 0, the search is considered ``preattentive.'' To determine what is analysed\npreattentively, the tasks that lead to flat search slopes simply need to be identified. There\nmay, of course, be other reasons for the flat search slopes.\nA few random examples from diverse fields of how the two-stage assumption is used as\nfact rather than conjecture are mentioned here (almost literally picked out of a hat from\namong many possible ones). All highlight the contaminating influence of the two-stage\nassumption. In visual masking, Argyropoulos, Gellatly, Pilling, and Carter (2013; see\nFilmer, Mattingley, & Dux, 2014 for similar assumptions) concluded that object\nsubstitution masking was not obliterated by attention as originally claimed by Enns and\nDiLollo (1997), since they found that such masking was not affected by set-size\nmanipulations. There was little discussion of the reasoning behind the assumption that set-\nsize effects are indicative of attentional effects. This was simply taken as given. Another\nexample involves research into the relation of working memory and attention. Woodman,\nVogel, and Luck (2001) investigated interactions of working memory and attention, finding\nthat added working memory load did not influence set-size effects in visual search. This led\nthem to conclude that visual search requires minimal working memory resources, inconsistent\nwith ideas of overlap in function of attention and working memory (e.g. Awh & Jonides,\n2001; Bundesen, 1990). Notably, they found a large intercept effect but stated that: ``this\nchange in intercept implies that the memory task led to a slowing of a process that either\npreceded or followed the actual search'' (p. 221), again a conclusion based on the two-stage\nassumption. Oh and Kim (2004) subsequently argued that there was dual-task interference in\na task involving spatial visual memory and visual search. Again set-size effects were the key to\nreaching this conclusion. Horowitz and Wolfe (1998) investigated the role of spatial memory\nin visual search finding that randomly relocating search items every 110 ms during search did\nnot modulate set-size effects. They concluded that attention did not keep track of already\nsearched locations. They did, however, find intercept effects from the reshuffling.\nKristja\n\u00b4 nsson (2000) questioned their conclusion by modifying their paradigm, but again\nthe reasoning depended on the slopes, although Kristja\n\u00b4 nsson noted that intercept\ndifferences could have relevance for attention under other models than those involving the\ntwo-stage assumption. Greenberg et al. (2015) investigated object-based attention arguing\nthat the attentional priority surrounding a selected object is modulated by search mode as\nmeasured with slopes.\nThe two-stage assumption is applied to research outside the field of visual cognition.\nIn clinical psychology, Hahn, Carlson, Singer, and Gronlund (2006) used slopes of\nresponse time and set-size to assess attentional bias to threatening faces. In\nneuropsychology, Ashwin, Wheelwright, and Baron-Cohen (2006) investigated the anger\nsuperiority effect in face perception, using slopes to measure attention to facial expression\nin Asperger syndrome. In a study of neglect patients, the current author is again guilty.\nKristja\n\u00b4 nsson and Vuilleumier (2010) used search slopes to argue for a difference in spatial\nmemory between visual hemi fields, but to their credit they noted caveats regarding\nassumptions about attentional involvement from slopes. In the controversial field of action\nvideo-game training (see Boot, Blakely, & Simons, 2011; Kristja\noverviews), Hubert-Wallender, Green, Sugarman, and Bavelier (2011) stated that search\nslopes could be used as a diagnostic tool for measuring influences on attentional\nprocessing from video-game training or experience (see also Castel, Pratt, & Drummond,\n2005; Wu & Spence, 2013). In Neurophysiology, the operative characteristics of neurons in\nvarious vision and attention-related brain regions have been assessed under the two-stage\nassumption (Cohen, Heitz, Woodman, & Schall. 2009; Jerde, Ikkai, & Curtis, 2011; see also\nChelazzi, 1999). Similar assumptions have been made in neuroimaging research on humans\n(Donner et al., 2002; Nobre, Coull, Walsh, & Frith, 2003) . All these studies take the two-\nstage model as given. Finally, the two-stage assumption is found in the Wikipedia entry on\nvisual search, not stated as conjecture, but fact (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nVisual_search#Reaction_time_slope, retrieved May 1st, 2015). In sum, the original\ntheoretical claims that were based on a particular interpretation of visual search data have\nbeen used at face-value as facts about attention, not testable hypotheses.\nFindings question the two-stage assumption\nIt would of course be fine to accept and apply the two-stage assumption had it stood the test\nof time. It did, however, not take long for results to appear that did not fit with the two-stage\nformulation. Examples are efficient conjunction search (e.g. McLeod, Driver, & Crisp, 1988;\nwhere response times decreased with larger set-size (Bravo & Nakayama, 1992; see also Bacon\n2007) showing how target salience can increase with more nontargets. The same features have\nbeen found to function very differently depending on context: The spatial layout of identical\nfeatures can determine whether search is efficient or not (Enns & Rensink, 1990), and\nfamiliarity strongly affects visual search for the same basic features (Wang, Cavanagh, &\nGreen, 1994). In the aforementioned study of Horowitz and Wolfe (1998), where search items\nwere reshuffled around the scene every 110 ms, whether there was in fact a deficit in search\nslopes may be irrelevant to the deeper point that the results (and those of Kristja\nwere quite inconsistent with the two-stage assumption. The reshuffling effects were simply far\nKristja\ntoo small for this, regardless of whether memory was involved or not. Joseph, Chun, and\nNakayama (1997) found that an attention-demanding task presented at center interfered with\npresumed preattentive search. Other examples of results that strongly contradict the two-\nstage assumption are findings on foraging (Kristja\n\u00b4 nsson, Jo\nanalyses of response time distributions (Palmer, Horowitz, Torralba, & Wolfe, 2011,\nKristja\n\u00b4 nsson & Jo\ndistribution of search slopes as a function of task (Wolfe, 1998). Even though leading\ntheories of attention have responded to these findings (e.g. Wolfe 1994, 2007), the simple\nversion of the two-stage assumption is still applied to research in diverse areas, as the\nexamples discussed above show.\nWang, Kristja\n\u00b4 nsson, and Nakayama (2005) investigated a ``multiconjunction'' search task\nwhere the target could neither be distinguished from distractor based on single features nor\non the basis of top\u00addown feature biases. In a typical example, the target was randomly either\na black disk or a white donut, while the distractors were black donuts and white disks. The\ntwo target types share a feature with both distractor types minimising target saliency.\nAccording to the two-stage assumption, the visual system would treat target and\ndistractors alike and need to search through the display items one by one, while the only\nuseful top\u00addown guidance signal is that the target is always the odd-one-out. Many visual\nclearly predict inefficient search on such tasks since the primary determinants of visual search\nperformance are, by these accounts, feature contrasts (preattentive) and top\u00addown biases\ntoward certain features (attentive). Yet set-size effects were small, or nonexistent in many\nexamples, indicating that the search was ``efficient'' (Wolfe, 1998a).\nGo/No-go measures\nThere are other ways of assessing visual search performance than response times on a present\nor absent (PA) task. Another finding in the aforementioned paper of Wang et al. (2005,\nExperiment 4) is less well known. When they changed their multiconjunction search task,\nso that observers did not have to respond whether the target was present or absent, but only if\nthe target was present (and do nothing if no target was absent; a ``Go/No-go'' task, GNG),\nsearch slopes in multiconjunction search actually became negative--search times decreased\nwith set-size. Even if the task was switched so that observers only responded on trials with no\ntarget, where search slopes should be twice the size of target present slopes under the two-\nstage assumption, the slopes were close to zero. Additionally, the intercepts were much lower\n(by $50%) than for a PA task with identical search stimuli. Chmiel (1989) found that target\npresent slopes for conjunction search became flat when the search task changed from\ninvolving a PA decision to a GNG decision as did van der Heijden and La Heij (1982)\nwho also observed the error rates were lower for the GNG task.\nThe important point to take from this is that search performance can be very different for\nthe same search task with only slight modification of response. But, more seriously, this\nmeans that under the two-stage assumption, visual attention operates differently for\nidentical searches depending on response requirements. Wang et al. (2005) raised another\npoint worth considering. There may be a task-discrepancy between the present and absent\ndecisions in typical visual search that gives the target-presence decision precedence over the\nabsent decision. Only when the observer fails to find a target is the absent decision an option.\nAdditionally, Chun & Wolfe (1996) suggested that participants tend to be less certain\nwhen they do not see a target and thus examine more of the display before making a\ndecision. Wang et al. did indeed observe that error rates did not differ for present and\nabsent trials for the GNG task. Error rates were, in fact, much lower overall for the GNG\nthan the PA task (see also van der Heijden & La Heij, 1982). This may be because the GNG\ntask allows the decision to involve detecting target presence versus absence. Making the\nabsent or present decisions the primary task under different conditions may therefore be a\nway of equating the tasks.\nCurrent experiments\nHere the GNG visual search paradigm used by Wang et al. (2005) is revisited (along with the\nmore traditional PA task) to assess whether the two-stage assumption leads to similar\nconclusions about attention from GNG and PA results. To get a relatively wide range of\nestimates of PA versus GNG performance, three different tasks were tested (see Figure 1):\n(1) Search based on a single feature with four possible targets (black disk, black donut, white\ndisk, or white donut). Both distractor sets always shared a feature that the target did not\nhave, so the target was distinguished from distractors on a single feature. For example,\nfor a black disk target, the two distractor sets were either white disks and white donuts or\nwhite and black donuts.\n(2) ``Easy'' multiconjunction search with four possible targets (black disk, black donut,\nwhite disk, or white donut). Either distractor set shared one feature with the target,\nbut importantly, never the same one so that no single feature ever distinguished target\nfrom distractors. So if the target was a black disk, the distractors would be white disks\nand black donuts.\n(3) ``Hard'' multiconjunction search with four possible targets (red vertical or horizontal bar,\nor green vertical or horizontal bar). Again, either distractor set shared one feature with\nthe target, so that no single feature ever distinguished target and distractors. If the\ntarget was, say, a red vertical bar, the distractors would be red horizontal and green\nvertical bars.\nFigure 1. The three visual search tasks that were tested, both with traditional Present/Absent (PA)\nresponses or Go/No-Go/(GNG) responses (all shown with set-size \u00bc 10). Feature search on the left, where a\nsingle feature (brightness) distinguishes target and distractors; ``easy'' multiconjunction search at center\nwhere the target shares one feature with each distractor set and ``hard'' multiconjunction search on the right.\nA target is present in all the examples. The target was randomly one of the four possible search items in each\nsearch on a given trial.\nKristja\nMethods\nObservers. Eight observers (six male, mean age 31) participated. All had normal, or corrected\nto normal vision. One additional participant was excluded because of incomplete data. They\nparticipated in 200 trials under each of nine conditions (The three response conditions: PA,\nGNG--present, GNG--absent, tested for the three different search task), 1,800 trials in total.\nEquipment. The experimental displays were programmed in C using the VisionShell\nsoftware library and presented on an 85-Hz CRT controlled by a 400-MHz G4 Apple\ncomputer.\nStimuli and procedure. Each trial in both tasks started with the presentation of a central\ndetermined for each trial), the experimental stimuli appeared. Auditory feedback was\nprovided on whether the answer was correct or incorrect. The viewing distance was 60 cm.\nThe search items appeared on an approximately midgray background (33 cd m\u00ad2). In all\nconditions, set-size was 10, 18, 24, or 32 items determined randomly for each trial.\nThe search items were equally distributed on an invisible 8 \u00c2 8 grid (cell size \u00bc 2.2) with a\nslight random position jitter (\u00c60.4) within each cell to introduce irregularity. The task was\nto determine whether an odd-one-out target was present or not (PA or GNG response,\nsee below).\nFeature search task. The four possible search items were black (0.8 cdm\u00ad2) or white (56.6\ncdm\u00ad2) annuli or black or white disks (see Figure 1, left). The target always differed from\ndistractors by having a unique feature. The disks and donuts had a diameter of 1.1.\nMulticonjunction search task with disks and donuts. The target always shared a feature with\neach of the two distractor types (e.g. a white donut among white disks and black donuts; see\nFigure 1b center).\nMulticonjunction search task with bars of varied color and orientation. The target always\nshared a feature with each of the two distractor types (e.g. a red (22.7 cdm\u00ad2) vertical bar (size\nThere were three different response conditions run in counterbalanced order (two 100 trial\nblocks for each condition). In a GNG-presence session, observers responded with a keypress\nonly if the target was present (on 50% of trials) but were told to ``sit and wait'' if the target\nwas absent, in which case the trial ended after 2000\u00ad3500 ms (randomly determined). In a\nGNG-absence session, observers responded only if the target was absent. In the PA task,\nobservers determined whether the target was present or absent by pressing corresponding\nkeys.\nResults and Discussion\n(1) Easy Conjunction Search With Discs and Donuts. The response times from the easy\nconjunction task are shown in Figure 2 (top). A number of findings should be highlighted.\nFirst, the set-size effect differs by task (slopes and intercepts are presented in Table 1). When\nthe target is present, the slopes are negative in the GNG task but positive for the PA task.\nWhen the target is absent, the RTs are almost 5 ms larger per added item in the PA task than\nthe GNG task.\nWhat this means is that under the two-stage assumption, we are forced to very different\nconclusions about the attentional requirements of the task. According to standard theory,\nthis is a conjunction search where the target does not pop-out nor can top-down feature\nguidance be applied since the target is not known. The fact that the slopes are very small in\nthe PA multiconjunction search is troubling for the two-stage assumption on its own since the\nresults suggest that the search is ``preattentive.'' But the results from the GNG task are even\nharder to account for under the two-stage assumption. Attention seems to be doing\nsomething quite different from what the two-stage assumption dictates. Attention is clearly\nnot moving from item to item trying to locate the target. Instead, observers are making a\ndecision that becomes easier as more items are added to the display. More generally, this\nmeans that slopes are an ambiguous measure of visual attention. A three-way analysis of\nFigure 2. The response times for the present/absent versus Go/No-go tasks for the three different\nsearches. Note the difference in scales, which reflect the differences in overall means for the different\nconditions. Error bars show the standard errors of the mean.\nKristja\nvariance (ANOVA; task, set-size, and target presence versus absence) showed that the main\n2 \u00bc .34) by response. Additionally, there was a large interaction of set-size and presence\nrates (presented in Figure 3) were very low. Error rates would have to be far larger and\ndifferential by condition for strategy effects, such as speed or accuracy trade-offs to account\nfor the results.\nTable 1.

PA \u00bc Present/Absent; GNG \u00bc Go/No-Go.\nFigure 3. Error rates for the present/absent versus Go/No-go tasks for the three different searches.\n(2) Hard Conjunction Search With Colored Oriented Bars. The results for the hard\nconjunction search are shown in Figure 1 (middle, slopes and intercepts in Table 1).\nAgain, we are forced to quite different conclusions regarding attention by a slight\nmodification of the response. There are both large differences in slope and intercept\nbetween the PA and GNG conditions. A three-way ANOVA revealed a large effect of task\ninteraction of task and set-size, showing again that the slopes differ by task\nthe two-stage assumption yields a very different conclusion as a function of task since slopes\nare the measure of the speed of attentional processing under that account. The error rates\n(Figure 3) suggest that speed or accuracy trade-offs are unlikely to account for the results.\nThey are highest for the target present case in the PA condition. Performance under this\ncondition may therefore be overestimated, which would mean that the results underestimate\nthe difference between GNG and PA performance. Note, however, that there may be a slight\ndifference in slopes between the PA and GNG tasks in the error rates, which may reflect some\ndifferences in speed\u00adaccuracy trade-offs. This evidence is not strong, however, and is unlikely\nto account for the slope differences seen for the RT data.\n(3) Feature Search. The results for the feature search are shown in Figure 1 (bottom;\nslopes and intercepts shown in Table 1). Immediately notable is that the response times\ntime decrease overall with increased set-size. Furthermore, performance is faster for the\nGNG task revealing large intercept effects in a feature search task that are solely due to\nchanges in response method. This difference might reflect changes in strategy during the\nvisual task itself, since in the GNG task, observers must detect presence or detect absence,\nrather than absence being a decision made only when no target is found. A three-way\nANOVA revealed that the main effect of task (PA vs GNG) was not quite significant\nNo interactions were significant. Error rates (Figure 3) were very low and would have to be\nfar larger and differential by condition for strategy effects, such as speed or accuracy trade-\noffs to account for the results.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe results clearly show how slopes are ambiguous measures of visual attention. Three very\ndifferent patterns of results are seen for the three different search tasks, but importantly, the\nslopes differ as a function of response method. The idea that slopes measure attention derives\nfrom the assumption of a preattentive stage followed by an attentive stage where the search is\ncarried out. This two-stage assumption therefore leads to differing conclusions about\nattentional function from the current results--different conclusions that are based solely\non slight modification of response method. This result shows how problematic strict\nadherence to the two-stage assumption can be. The two-stage model and corresponding\nslopes should only be used with great caution, and probably should not be used to\ndetermine whether attention is involved in a particular task or not.\nIt may surprise some readers to see this argument made in 2015. Some may feel that a\nstraw man has been erected. Others may wonder: ``who cares?'' Findings that the two-stage\nassumption cannot account for have been around in the literature since the 1980s\nKristja\n(see examples in Introduction section). But keep in mind that the implicit influence of the\ntwo-stage assumption is still strong as examples described in the introduction show.\nInterpretation of research findings is in many cases based on the two-stage assumption\nmeaning that scientist may draw incorrect conclusions from their results. Arguments made\nin many disciplines in recently published papers depend on the assumption that if you do not\nmodulate slopes of set-size and RT you do not measure attention. What is important\nregarding the current results, above other counterexamples to the two-stage assumption is\nthat the differing conclusions are obtained on tasks requiring identical searches where only\nresponse instructions are changed. Under the two-stage assumption, such instruction\nvariability should not affect processes connected with the search. Data on the same search\nleave us with different assumptions about attention.\nWhat's going on during visual search\nMulticonjunction search, results from foraging tasks, analyses of RT distributions or the\ndistribution of search slopes, along with the findings described in the introduction, argue\nagainst the two-stage assumption. This highlights that the field still has not figured out how\nvisual search works. Slopes are clearly not a straightforward measure of attention as has been\nthe dominant view for 35 years.\nWhat are we left with? Rauschenberger (2010, p. 110) questioned the bottom\u00adup or\ntop\u00addown distinction that is central to the two-stage view, stating: ``It is entirely\nconceivable that there is no temporally or spatially localisable final output that\nrepresents the final word in how the brain interprets a given visual input'' and later:\n``In this scheme, ``top\u00addown'' and ``bottom\u00adup'' make little sense because there is no\nisolated feed-forward volley.'' I agree with Rauschenberger; it may be time to stop\nthinking linearly about vision and attention. Rauschenberger points toward the\nimportance of reentrant processing (Ahissar & Hochstein, 2004; Lamme & Roelfsema,\n2000); and feedback connections. These proposals strongly blur any distinction between\n``bottom\u00adup'' versus ``top\u00addown'' processing.\nNakayama & Martini (2011) suggested that visual search might be considered a pattern\nrecognition task. Eckstein (1998) suggested that differences between feature and conjunction\nsearch reflected noisy interactions among different features. Such accounts might, for\nexample, explain negative slopes, since with more search items there may be more evidence\nto base a decision on. Related to this, Wang et al. (2005) argued that perceptual organisation\ncould play a large role in search; organisation that might be easier with increased set-size. But\nthese speculations may at best help explain the negative slopes seen here, and at this point, no\nconcrete theory accounts for all visual search findings.\nVisual search may very well be so multifaceted that no single idea will explain all the data.\nNakayama & Martini (2011) discuss many similar points to those that I make, stating that a\nnew conception of visual search is still ``[. . .] in embryonic form, but discernible is a core\nwhich de-emphasizes canonical detectors, ignores the `binding' problems and allows for very\nhigh level processing to occur very early in time'' (p. 109). In some ways this is akin to the\nproposals of Julesz (1981) and his texton theory, although Julesz distinguished between\npreattentive and attentive processing stages, which may not fit well with the current\nzeitgeist (Awh, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012; Kristja\nAlternative models, such as those discussed in the introduction where the two-stage\ndichotomy is ignored, may be better fits to this conception. Parallel models have, for\nexample, been successful in accounting for decreases in RT with increased set-size (Santhi\nConclusions\nMost researchers have abandoned strong versions of the two-stage model of visual search and\nattention. Nevertheless, it still exerts a strong influence upon many fields in Psychology and\nCognitive Neuroscience. My data argue against this model, and so do many other findings.\nClearly, it should only be used with great caution.\n"
