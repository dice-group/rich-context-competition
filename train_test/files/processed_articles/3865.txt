    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study examined the relationships between emotional intelligence (EI) and the delinquent behavior (DB) of the students.\nThe level of DB reported by the students is categorized under the headings of crime, drugs, vandalism, pornography and\nsexual behavior, other misbehavior, and dishonesty. Meanwhile, EI is investigated by looking at the level of EI domains, such as\nself-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, social skills, maturity, and spiritual awareness. Data were gathered\nfrom a sample of 300 secondary school students aged 15 to 18 years in Selangor. The schools they attended were selected\nfrom the so-called \"hardcore schools,\" which were identified by Schools Division in the State of Selangor. Two instruments,\nnamely, surveys on the \"Behavior of Students\" and \"Malaysian Emotional Quotient Inventory (R)\u00adAdolescence (MEQI),\"\nwere utilized to collect the research data and were analyzed using SPSS 19.0. The data showed that the highest delinquency\namong the adolescents was misbehavior in school, followed by crime, vandalism, pornography, dishonesty, and drugs. Results\nalso revealed a negative linear relationship between EI (r = -.208, n = 300, p = .001) and DB, implying that adolescents with\nbetter EI had lower levels of delinquency. Multiple regression analysis revealed that EI is a significant predictor of DB and self-\nawareness is the main factor of DB. This study contributes to the knowledge of the importance of EI in understanding DB.\nEI can be used to identify and discriminate emotional skills among those adolescents who exhibit DB. Addressing the role of\nEI as a predictor would probably prove to be effective in reducing DB.\n",

This\ndiversity challenges the schools to create environments that\nare sensitive to the myriad backgrounds. One of the issues\nthat challenges the schools is student delinquency. Student\ndelinquency is one of the most prevailing problems affecting\nschool discipline not only in Malaysia but also around the\nworld (Arum & Ford, 2012). These students dare to break the\nrules without feeling guilty or fear of punishment. In fact,\nthey know the consequences they are going to face--warn-\ning or suspension. Thus, delinquency in school will result in\neventually dropping out of school, which will then lead to\nvarious societal problems, such as drug addiction, criminal-\nLike many other countries, schools in Malaysia practice\nthe disciplinary policies of zero tolerance and punitive mea-\nsures. Although traditional punishment and exclusion may\nseem to work as an instant solution, it provides a short-lived\nreprieve from disciplinary problems. According to Graves\nand Mirsky (2007), such policies actually hinder academic\nachievement and increase both disciplinary problems and\ndrop-out rates. Furthermore, research has shown that in the\nlong term, punishment and exclusion are ineffective and can\nlead to renewed incidents of disruption and escalation of\nbehavior (Mayer, Caruso, & Salovey, 2000).\nSelangor were involved in disciplinary cases of which 72,557\nwere students from secondary schools and 38,927 were from\nprimary schools.

In the context of this study, these inappropri-\nate behaviors occur in school and it is believed that the early\nstage of DB has the potential to cause school failure, impair-\nment in socioemotional development, peer rejection, delin-\nquency, and adult crime (Moffitt, 1993).According to Loeber\nand Farrington (2000), the early onset of delinquency signifi-\ncantly increases the risk of serious crime and violence in\nlater years.\nSchool \"crime,\" in this study, refers to the use of drugs,\nand the presence of weapons; \"vandalism\" includes behav-\nior, such as breaking windows, slashing the tires of the teach-\ners' cars, spray painting on the school walls with graffiti, and\ndestroying the property of the school; \"dishonesty\" is cheat-\ning, such as in examinations, lying, and other forms of dis-\nhonest behavior; \"pornography\" for secondary school\nstudents includes watching pornographic videos and engag-\ning in sexual behavior, such as molesting, kissing, and sex;\nand \"misbehavior\" refers to any behavior that disrupts the\nteaching and learning activities, truancy, making commotion\nin public, or teasing their school friends.\nSprinthall and Collins (1995) also mentioned two broad\ndimensions of behavior disorders--internalizing and exter-\nnalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior is directed inward\nand involves behavioral deficits, such as isolation, with-\ndrawal, and depression, whereas externalizing behavior is\ndirected outwards and takes the form of disturbing others,\nverbal and physical aggression, and acts of violence.\nAs such, delinquency is considered as an externalizing\nproblem because it presents \"acting out\" behavior, whereas\nemotional difficulties are regarded as internalizing, because\nproblems are turned inward. Problems, such as depression,\nsuicide, stress, and eating disorders are examples of internal-\nizing reactions that will increase during adolescence. These\nprompt researchers to find a solution to meet the social and\nemotional needs of all students, particularly the emotional\nintelligence (EI) of those delinquent students.\nEmotional Intelligence (EI)\nEI involves the capacity to carry out acceptable emotional\nbehavior and enhancement of reasoning. More specifically,\nEI involves the ability to perceive and accurately express\nemotion, to use emotion to facilitate thought, to understand\nemotions, and to manage emotions for emotional growth\n(Mayer & Salovey, 1997). According to Mayer, DiPaolo, and\nSalovey (1990), EI was described as a type of emotional\ninformation processing that includes the accurate appraisal\nof emotions in oneself and others, appropriate expression of\nemotions, and adaptive regulation of emotions. While\nWeisinger (1998) defined EI as the intelligent use of emo-\ntion, he suggested that EI also enables individuals to obtain\npositive results in utilizing their emotions to regulate their\nbehavior. In fact, EI is not a trait, but can be nurtured, devel-\noped, and augmented.\nSimilarly, Goleman (1998a) and Mayer and Salovey\n(1997) described EI as an influential concept that impacts\non the education of students in school. This ability allows\none to discriminate among one's emotions to best guide\none's behavior. According to Goleman (1997b), many stu-\ndents who faced emotional challenges manifest unmanage-\nable behavior and are more vulnerable to school discipline\nproblems.\nEI and DB\nSeveral studies have found that EI could have a significant\nimpact on one's life. It was found that higher EI was a predic-\ntor of life satisfaction. In addition, people who are high in EI\nare also more likely to use an adaptive defense style against\ndeviant behavior and thus exhibit healthier psychological\nadaptation ( Mayer et. al, 2000). Performance measures of EI\nhave illustrated that higher levels of EI are associated with\nincreased positive interactions with friends and family.\nNegative relationships have likewise been identified between\nEI and problem behavior. Mayer et al. (2000) found that\nlower EI was associated with lower self-reports of violent\nand trouble-prone behavior among college students, a corre-\nlation that remained significant even when the effects of\nintelligence and empathy were partialed out. According to\nMayer, et al. (2000), lower EI (as measured by the Mayer\u00ad\nSalovey\u00adCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test [\"MSCEIT\"])\nhas been significantly associated with higher use of illegal\ndrugs and alcohol, as well as increased participation in devi-\nant behavior (e.g., involvement in physical fights and\nvandalism).\nErasmus (2007), indicated that young people who are\nlacking in social and emotional competence might end up\nbecoming self-centered and unable to empathize and relate to\nothers. Moreover, students with DB often struggle with dif-\nficult personal and emotional problems. Psychological fac-\ntors could be an important factor to provide protection\nagainst delinquent and violent behavior patterns, such as the\nability to be flexible during periods of change in school or\nwork schedule, having effective and efficient communica-\ntion skills, the ability to use humor in deescalating negative\nsituations, and the use of a wide range of social skills\nA longitudinal study conducted by Fortin (2003) showed\nthat delinquent students lack self-control. This causes them\nto react negatively to criticism and renders them unable to\naccept the opinion of others. In addition, being unable to\ncontrol their emotions and moods will lead them into con-\nflicts with other students and adults. In fact, a child's emo-\ntional life has an impact on his or her behavior.\nMaria Chong et al. 3\nIn Malaysia, Liau, Liau, Teoh, and Liau (2003), in their\nresearch on EI, found that higher levels of EI were hypothe-\nsized to be associated with lower levels of internalizing prob-\nlem behavior, such as academic anxiety, depression, somatic\ncomplaints, and stress, as well as lower levels of externaliz-\ning problem behavior, such as aggression and delinquency.\nIn this study, EI focused on personal and social compe-\ntencies. EI consists of seven domains: self-awareness, self-\nregulation, self-motivation, empathy, social skills, maturity,\nand spiritual. Those were the independent variables used to\nhypothesize the predictors of DB.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: What is the level of DB reported\nby students in respect of (a) crime, (b) drugs, (c) vandal-\nism, (d) pornography and sexual behavior, (e) other mis-\nbehavior, and (f) dishonesty?\nResearch Question 2: What is the level of EI among the\nstudents with DB in secondary schools?\nResearch Question 3: Is there any statistically significant\ndifference in EI with regard to gender?\nResearch Question 4: Is there any statistically significant\nrelationship between EI and DB among students in sec-\nondary schools?\nResearch Question 5: Does EI predict the level of DB\namong students in secondary schools?\nMethod\nSample\nThe participants in the study were 300 secondary school stu-\nThese schools were selected because they were listed as\n\"hardcore schools\" in relation to discipline problems\nobtained from the Schools Division in the State of Selangor.\nThe respondents were identified with the help of teachers\nand counselors based on their DB represented in their\nschool's demerit systems.\nProcedure\nThe researcher first obtained written permission from the\nEducational Planning and Research Department (EPRD) of\nthe Ministry of Education, Malaysia, for the study. Later, the\nresearcher sought written permission from the State\nEducation Department to carry out the research in the school.\nWith the permission from the authorities concerned, the\nresearcher then approached the administrator of the schools\nto coordinate the data collection. Before the data collection,\nthe researcher approached the school to get permission from\nthe school to set the time and date to conduct the survey. The\nresearcher, with the cooperation of the disciplinary teacher\nand counselor, identified the students through the merit and\ndemerit system of the respective schools. From each school,\n30 Form 4 students were selected randomly for this research.\nThe selected students were of various races and both gen-\nders. The researcher arranged to come on the day that had\nbeen fixed for the survey. The survey took 2 days in each of\nthe schools.\nInstrumentation\nTwo instruments, namely, surveys on the \"Behavior of\nStudents,\" and \"Malaysian Emotional Quotient Inventory\n(R)\u00adAdolescence (MEQI)\" were utilized to collect the\nresearch data and were analyzed using SPSS 19.0.\n\"Behavior of students.\"This instrument was designed by\nRozumah et al. (2003). Permission to use the instrument was\nobtained from the author for this study. Rozumah et al.\n(2003) had reported a reliability of .92 confirming that this\ninstrument has high reliability and is suitable for assessing\nthe behavior of secondary school students. Meanwhile, the\nreliability of this instrument in the current study was .73.\nThis instrument comprises 35 items with six subscales to\nidentify the delinquent acts of the respondents. The six sub-\nscales of this instrument are the DBs of students categorized\nas crime, vandalism, drugs, pornography and sexual behav-\nior, dishonesty, and other misbehavior. It was used to assess\nthe involvement of students in DB over the 8 months imme-\ndiately prior to when the questionnaires were administered.\nThese 35 items are scored based on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale, namely, 1 = not very frequent, 2 = not frequent, 3 =\nmoderately frequent, 4 = frequent, and 5 = very frequent. The\nlowest score is 35 while the highest is 175. The higher the\nscore in each category, the more frequently the particular\ndelinquent act is committed. Answers to the items cover the\nfollowing offenses: stealing something worth RM50.00 or\nless, stealing something worth RM50.00 or more, shoplift-\ning, buying stolen goods, selling drugs, and discipline prob-\nlems in school, such as fighting, vandalism, throwing items,\nverbal bullying, graffiti in school, or threatening or using\nviolence in the classroom.\nMEQI.MEQI was developed by Noriah Mohd Ishak et al.\n(2000) to assess the EI of adolescents based on the Goleman\nsures the seven domains of EI. The seven domains are (a)\nself-awareness, (b) self-regulation, (c) self-motivation, (d)\nempathy, (e) social skills, (f) spiritual, and (g) maturity.\nMEQI-Adolescence uses a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). MEQI-Ado-\nlescence consists of 11 sections: Section A to Section K. The\nitems measure the performance of the respondents to per-\nceive, facilitate, manage, and understand their emotions\nbased on the seven domains. These items assess respondents'\nEI ability in terms of self-awareness (35 items), self-regula-\nitems), social skills (52 items), spirituality (9 items), and\n4 SAGE Open\nmaturity (6 items). Meanwhile, the Cronbach's values for the\ninstruments are between .80 and .97. These values confirmed\nthat this instrument is reliable and suitable for secondary\nschool students in Malaysia. Examples of the items are, \"I\ncan be moved by an extraordinary event\"; \"I know when I\nhave negative thoughts about myself\"; \"I can execute what I\nhave planned\"; \"I am aware that anger is bad for my health.\"\nResults\nResearch Question 1: What is the level of DB reported\nby students in respect of (a) crime, (b) drugs, (c) vandal-\nism, (d) pornography and sexual behavior, (e) other mis-\nbehavior, and (f) dishonesty?\nTable 1 shows the overall analysis of the levels for the six\nDBs--crime, drugs, vandalism, pornography and sexual\nbehavior, other misbehavior, and dishonesty.\nResearch Question 2: What is the level of EI among the\nstudents with DB in secondary schools?\nThis section is to answer level of EI among students with\nDB. Table 2 shows the mean score of the seven\ndomains--self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation,\nempathy, social skills, spirituality, and maturity.\nBased on Table 2, among the seven EI domains, self-\nempathy domain was the highest among the seven EI domains.\nResearch Question 3: Is there a statistically significant\ndifference in EI with regard to gender?\nAn independent-samples t test was then conducted to com-\npare the mean EI score for male and female delinquent stu-\ndents. There was no statistically significant difference in the\np = .074. An inspection of the two means suggests that male\nand female delinquent students were not significantly differ-\nent in their EI.\nResearch Question 4: Is there a statistically significant\nrelationship between EI and DB among students in sec-\nondary schools?\nTo determine the relationship between EI and DB, Pearson\nproduct\u00admoment correlation coefficient was used to deter-\nmine the significance of the correlation between EI and DB.\nThe findings, as depicted in Table 3, show there was a\nstatistically significant negative correlation between EI and\ncoefficient of .208 indicates that as the score of EI increases,\nthe delinquency will decrease considerably. Table 4 showed\na correlation between EI domains and DB.\nThe correlation between EI domains and DB was investi-\ngated using the Pearson product\u00admoment correlation coeffi-\ncient. There were seven domains: self-awareness,\nself-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, maturity, and spir-\nituality. As shown in Table 4, there was a statistically signifi-\ncant negative relationship between self-awareness and DB\nficient indicates that as the score of self-awareness increases,\nthe delinquency decreases considerably.\nTable 1.

The negative correlation coefficient indicates\nthat as the score of self-motivation increases, the delinquency\ndecreases considerably.\nFinally, there was a significant negative correlation\nwhereby the negative correlation coefficient indicates that as\nthe score of spirituality increases, the delinquency decreases\nconsiderably.\nHence, the findings show that (a) there was a significant\nnegative relationship between the overall EI and DB; higher EI\nwill decrease the DB and (b) there were also significant nega-\ntive relationships between self-awareness, self-motivation, and\nspirituality and DB.\nResearch Question 5: Does EI predict the level of DB\namong students in secondary schools?\nTable 5 displays the answer to the research question. A step-\nwise multiple linear regressions was conducted to determine\nthe predictors (self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motiva-\ntion, empathy, social skills, maturity, and spirituality) of DB\namong the respondents.\nThe results reported that only one of the EI domains, that\nis, self-awareness, predicted DB. Table 5 shows that 3.0%\n(r = .16) of the variants in the criterion variable were\nexplained by the predictor variable, that is, self-awareness.\nThe results from the ANOVA analysis in the regression\nmodel are presented in Table 6. The results show that self-\nawareness was a statistically significant predictor variable of\nThe data in Table 7 indicate that the self-awareness ( =\n-.16, p < .05) was a statistically significant factor of DB.

In addition, they also skipped class for no reason.\nThese types of misbehavior were very common among the\nstudents and in line with the study by Shamsul Azhar Shah et\nal. (2012), who reported that truancy happened in every\nschool. Students who stated that they often skipped classes\nwould be engaged in at least one form of delinquency-related\nbehavior.\nIn this study, crime acts (M = 1.95, SD = .56), such as\nbringing weapons to school, assaulting other students, and\ninvolvement in gangsterism and fighting, were frequently\ncommitted by the students. This is followed by vandalism\n(M = 1.77, SD = .06), referring to damaging and destroying\nsomebody else's property on purpose, and pornography and\nsexual behavior (M = 1.63, SD = .63) in which most students\nwere involved with pornographic materials. In addition, stu-\ndents frequently committed dishonesty (M = 1.45, SD = .43)\nTable 4.

The last category is drugs (M = 1.17, SD = .54)\nwhereby taking drugs is more frequent than selling drugs.\nAlthough only 3 (1%) students were frequently involved in\nselling drugs, this result shows a very alarming situation that\ncould eventually lead to serious social criminal behavior.\nThe researcher concluded that the level of delinquency of the\nstudents is mild. This could be attributed to the fact that the\nsample did not include students or youth engaging in serious\nDB. Most of the delinquent students just misbehave in the\nschool, such as truancy, and are not involved in serious\noffenses.\nThis result is also consistent with the findings of Norlizah\nChe Hassan (2008) concerning adolescent delinquency in\nthat the level of the adolescents' DB did not achieve 10%.\ndelinquency is at a low level with only 1.1% adolescents at\nthe high level. This implies that the level of delinquency in\nMalaysian schools is controllable. Moreover, in the study on\nviolence among adolescents, Lee, Chen, Lee, and Kaur\nfight with other people, theft (4.3%), vandalism (2.7%), and\nhad carried a weapon (2.4%). Although all these types of\nbehavior in the school are still controllable, with only a small\npercentage involved in delinquency, it is still alarming as\nthese could lead to more serious forms of delinquency and\nsocial ills.\nThe findings of EI are consistent with Mayer et al. (2000)\nwho found a negative relationship between EI and problem\nbehavior. A lower EI was associated with lower self-reports\nof violent and trouble-prone behavior among adolescents, a\ncorrelation which remained significant even when the effects\nof intelligence and empathy were partialed out. Lower EI (as\nmeasured by the MSCEIT) has been significantly associated\nwith the higher use of illegal drugs and alcohol, as well as\nincreased participation in deviant behavior (i.e., involvement\nin physical fights and vandalism).\nSelf-awareness was found to have a significant relation-\nship with DB. The result shows the delinquent students paid\nless attention to emotions or feelings. This lack of emotional\nawareness means that delinquent students are unable to con-\nnect their feelings with their thoughts (Goleman, 1998) and\ntheir feelings, such as anger or frustration. Therefore, if the\nstudents are aware of their emotional states, and their\nstrengths and weaknesses, they will become aware of their\nvalues and goals in their life. Self-awareness will make them\nmindful that they have to accept criticism and feedback\nregardless of whatsoever happens.\nBased on the findings in Table 4, motivation was found to\nhave a statistically significant relationship with DB.\nMotivation is an emotional tendency that guides or facilitates\ntoward goal achievements. Under the motivation domain, are\nthree motivational subdomains such as achievement drive,\ncommitment, initiative and optimism. Students who have\nself-motivation would strive to excel in their undertakings\nand have high self-esteem. Delinquent students lack the\nmotivation to learn and have limited ability to focus and\nmaintain a positive sense of self-worth while being con-\nfronted by daily school challenges (Lopes, Salovey, & Straus,\n2003). They do not have the determination to achieve a goal\nand to excel in their work.\nSpiritual awareness was found to have a statistically sig-\nnificant relationship with DB. One of the elements in the\nsocial control theory is belief. According to the theory of\nHirschi (1977), if a person has strong beliefs in society's\nnorms, then the individual would avoid delinquency or crim-\ninal behavior. Those people who are deeply engaged in reli-\ngion would be less likely to be involved in crime and\ndeviance. However, a study by Mapp (2009) concerning the\nrole of religiosity and spirituality in juvenile delinquency\nreported a negative and statistically significant relationship\nbetween religion and spiritual, and marijuana use. Hence,\nthis study supports the study by other researchers.\nThe result in Table 7 shows self-awareness is one of the EI\nconstructs that predicts DB. The inability to understand emo-\ntions in oneself and others, including understanding how\nemotions can be changed and how people react to different\nemotions, would contribute to delinquency. According to\nLiau et al. (2003), in their research on EI, higher levels of EI\nwere hypothesized to be associated with lower levels of\ninternalizing problematic behavior, such as academic anxi-\nety, depression, somatic complaints, and stress, as well as\nlower levels of externalizing problem behavior, such as\naggression and delinquency.\nBased on the results, the relationship between DB and the\nset of predictor variables can be characterized as relatively\nweak. Total contribution by the combined set of predictors:\nEI accounted for 3% of the variance of DB. Eron, Gentry\nand Schlegel (1994) argued that no single factor explains\nmuch of the variance in delinquency but that it is the combi-\nnation of the identified risk factors that makes the differ-\nence. In addition, psychological factors, such as EI could be\nan important factor to provide protection against delinquent\nand violent behavior patterns including regulation of their\nemotions and awareness of their own strengths and\nweaknesses.\nConclusion\nAfter the discussion on each variable, this study has docu-\nmented considerable knowledge for all walks of society in\nunderstanding DB. Deficiency in EI is considered to be\nimpaired in emotional and social functioning. Goleman\n(1995) also agreed that social skills and managing emotions\nare related to coping strategies and that deficiencies in those\nskills are related to the involvement in risk-taking behaviors.\nTo gain success at school, students should have confidence,\nintentionality, self-control, capacity to communicate, and the\nability to cooperate. These skills are very important to hinder\nany problematic behavior.\nMaria Chong et al. 7\nEI can be used to identify and discriminate emotional\nskills among those adolescents who exhibit DB. In this study,\nthe deficiencies of certain EI domains of the delinquent stu-\ndents are highlighted. These are emotional awareness, accu-\nrate awareness, self-confidence from the self-awareness\ndomain; trustworthiness from the self-regulation domain,\nand influence and conflict from the social skills domains. As\nsuch, these delinquent students need to be guided and given\nthe opportunities to build up those competencies. This study\nhas documented a complete profile of EI on delinquent\nstudents.\nThe study also provides a realization that delinquent ado-\nlescents do have their own strengths whereby their EI domain\nof empathy is higher (Table 2). They are motivated, innova-\ntive, and have the tendency to initiate or manage a change of\nsituation. Sadly, we often label them and only see their weak-\nnesses. Opportunities should be given to these adolescents to\nshow their potential and personal abilities as these delinquent\nadolescents can happen to be future leaders who can make\nchanges in a group or organization. Furthermore, emotional\nknowledge can be improved through education practices;\nperhaps training children and adults in EI can lead to more\nadaptive behavior.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArum, R., & Ford, K.
