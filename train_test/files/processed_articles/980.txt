These\ncomponents were weighted and assigned cut-offs and point schemes based on the Chinese Food Guide Pagoda,\nChinese andaor international dietary reference values. The ef\u00aecacy of resulting DQI scores was assessed relative\nto a priori expectations.\nSubjects: The Chinese DQI was evaluated using cross-sectional 3 day diet record and anthropometric data on\nMethods: For each individual, a DQI total score was calculated as the sum of components, and DQI pattern\nscores calculated to re\u00afect the underlying composition of diet quality problems. The DQI scores were compared\nwith component scores, food and nutrient intake, weight status and sociodemographic variables.\nResults: The total DQI score simultaneously represented all component aspects of diet quality as well as\nmicronutrients not explicitly built into the index. The total DQI score was signi\u00aecantly correlated with food and\nnutrient intakes, BMI, urban residence and income. The DQI pattern scores correlated with DQI components and\nweight status as expected.\nConclusions: The China DQI captures variation along several components of diet quality, appears sensitive to\nunder- and overnutrition, as well as sociodemographic variables. The China DQI may prove useful for\nmonitoring the nutrition transition and epidemiologic trends in China.\nPreventive Medicine.\nDescriptors: China; dietary intake; diet quality\nIntroduction\nRelated to nutrition transitions worldwide, there is a shift in\nconcern from nutrient de\u00aeciency towards dietary excess,\nchronic disease morbidity and overall diet quality. This\nshift forces researchers to abandon single-factor paradigms\nof disease etiology in favor of paradigms involving multi-\nple and interrelated risk factors. Nutrition researchers\nworldwide are increasingly faced with understanding and\nteasing apart the effects of several causative agents and\nmulticollinear nutrients. Strong correlations between\nenergy and macronutrients and between micronutrients\nmake conceptualizing and estimating independent effects\nof speci\u00aec nutrients dif\u00aecult. To keep pace with nutrition\ntransitions and adjust policy appropriately, developing as\nwell as developed countries need measures of overall diet\nquality that capture diets as a whole and avoid problems\nassociated with food- or nutrient-speci\u00aec measures (WHO,\nIn developing countries, including China, nutrition and\nepidemiologic transitions have begun and are proceeding at\nextremely accelerated rates (Drewnowski & Popkin, 1997;\n50 y to occur in the US have been compressed into periods\nas short as 7 y in China. In addition to overall declines in\nfood scarcity and increases in the prevalence of overweight,\nthe speed and unequal distribution of economic and demo-\ngraphic change typically create pockets of undernutrition\n1996). Due to the coexisting pockets of under- and over-\nnutrition, developing countries require measures of diet\nquality that are sensitive to both under- and overnutrition.\nIndeed, the Chinese Nutrition Society highlight this two-\ndimensional need in their Dietary Guidelines for Chinese\nThe \u00aerst objective of this paper was to describe the\ndevelopment of diet quality index (DQI) measures for\nChina, and illustrate methods for DQI development that\naccommodate coexisting problems of under- and overnutri-\ntion. The proposed DQI measures are intended to examine\ncurrent diet quality in China and guiding the Chinese diet\ntowards better overall nutrition. The goal was to create a\n\u00afexible measure for research and policy-making purposes\nthat re\u00afects both under- and overnutrition, identi\u00aees groups\nwith poor diet quality, and differentiates between different\ntypes of poor diet quality. The key ingredients for this\nprocess, namely national dietary guidelines, dietary intake\nreferences, and detailed multilevel dietary data are\navailable for China.\nDevelopment of the DQI for China began with concepts\nfrom existing DQI for the US (Haines et al, 1999; Patterson\net al, 1994), and went further to incorporate the\n*Correspondence: BM Popkin, Carolina Population Center, CB no. 8120\nUniversity Square, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 123 W.\nE-mail: popkin@unc.edu\nGuarantor: BM Popkin.\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\ntwo-dimensional (de\u00aeciency and overconsumption) con-\ncerns of the Chinese Nutrition Society. The following\nparagraphs present the DQI components, structure and\nrationale for a total DQI score, and introduce a strategy\nfor evaluating DQI patterns in China. DQI components\nwere selected, and a scaling system generated based on\nworld reference values, the Chinese Recommended Daily\nAllowances (RDA, see Table 6; INFH-CAPM, 1991) and\nFood Guide Pagoda (see Figure 1; SBCNS, 1999). The DQI\ncomponents were summed to create a total DQI score that\npositions diets along a spectrum of under- to overnutrition.\nThe components were also combined into DQI patterns that\nprovide qualitative information on the relative combination\nof under- and overnutrition problems.\nThe second objective of this work was to assess the\nef\u00aecacy of the Chinese DQI total score and DQI patterns\nbased on a priori expectations of how the DQI should\nperform. We applied the DQI to data from the China Health\nand Nutrition Surveys and tested for expected correlations\nbetween the DQI scores, food and nutrient intakes, as well\nas sociodemographic and anthropometric variables. We\nexpected the DQI scores to correlate with food and nutrient\nintakes. Given previous research, we also expected the\nChinese DQI to correlate with urbanarural residence,\nMethods\nThe Standing Board of the Chinese Nutrition Society\nproposed qualitative Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Resi-\ndents that re\u00afect the multi-dimensionality of diet as well as\nthe nutrition and epidemiologic transitions in China (see\nTable 1) (SBCNS, 1999). The proposed guidelines expli-\ncitly aim to reduce both extremes of poverty and excess,\npromote good health, enhance immunity, reduce the risks\nof stunting and rickets, and prevent cardiovascular disease,\nhypertension, osteoporosis and some cancers.\nChoice of components for the Chinese Diet  \nTo develop a DQI for China we followed the same general\nstrategy used to develop the UNC-CH DQI and revised\nversion of this DQI (Haines et al, 1999; Patterson et al,\n1994). DQI components were selected to represent aspects\nof diet quality highlighted by the Dietary Guidelines for\nChinese Residents. The 10 components re\u00afect the food\ngroup-, food-, macronutrient- andaor micronutrient-level\nevidence that motivated the Dietary Guidelines (SBCNS,\n1999). With the exception of the last guideline, `Avoid\nunsanitary and spoiled foods', all elements of the Dietary\nGuidelines were incorporated into the Chinese DQI.\nTable 1 describes how each DQI component corre-\nsponds with one or more of the Dietary Guidelines for\nChinese Residents. The diet variety and total carbohydrate\ncomponents were chosen to evaluate compliance with the\ndietary guideline `Eat a variety of foods, with cereals as the\nstaple'. Since grains and cereals are the main sources of\ncarbohydrate in the Chinese diet, percentage of energy\nfrom carbohydrate was considered a reasonable indicator\nof staple food consumption. The fruit and vegetable\ncomponent was selected to match the second guideline\n`Consume plenty of vegetables, fruits and tubers'. The\nprotein component corresponded with the third and fourth\ndietary guidelines. Considering that the third guideline,\nregarding the consumption of bean products and animal\nfoods, was motivated by low nationwide calcium intakes\nand increasing rates of osteoporosis (SBCNS, 1999; Ge &\nCheng, 1999), a separate calcium component was included\nin the DQI. In addition to the protein component, total fat\nand saturated fat components were included in the DQI to\naddress the fourth dietary guideline, `Consume appropriate\namounts of \u00aesh, poultry, eggs and lean meat; reduce fatty\nFigure 1 Chinese food guide pagoda. Source: INFH-CAPM.\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nmeat and animal fat in the diet'. The total fat and saturated\nfat components index over consumption of fatty meat and\nanimal fat. The sodium and alcoholic beverage components\nre\u00afect the sixth and seventh dietary guidelines,\nrespectively.\nRelative weights and score values for the DQI components\nThe DQI components and scoring scheme are described in\nTable 2. To re\u00afect the relative importance of foods over\nnutrients as dietary components, greater weight was given\nto food-level components in the China DQI. The diet\nvariety and fruit and vegetable components, both food-\nlevel components, were each allowed 12 points. The\nnutrient-level components were weighted equally such\nthat each component was worth a maximum of 10 points.\nDue to minimal alcoholism in China, the alcohol compo-\nnent was assigned a maximum of only 6 points. Score\nvalues were chosen so that a diet that met all of the Dietary\nGuidelines for Chinese Residents received a total DQI\nscore of zero points. Components indexing aspects of\nundernutrition only received negative scores. Components\nindexing aspects of overnutrition only received positive\nscores. Components indexing aspects of under- or over-\nnutrition received either positive or negative scores. Since\nthe Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents emphasize\nmore undernutrition-related than overnutrition-related pro-\nblems, we proposed more DQI components with negative\nscores than positive scores. Continuous point scales were\nemployed for the diet variety and fruit and vegetable\ncomponents, where obvious cut-offs were not readily\navailable. Cut-offs were chosen and categorical point\nschemes were used for the remaining components.\nRationale for component cut-offs and scoring\nDiet variety. To ensure a balanced diet that satis\u00aees all\nnutrient requirements, the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese\nResidents recommend consumption of a variety of foods\nfrom several categories, including cereals and tubers,\nanimal foods, beans and bean products, as well as vege-\ntables and fruit. These four main food categories were used\nto create the diet variety component of the DQI. Food sub-\ncategories were used as the level of analysis, instead of\nindividual foods, since broader food aggregates are more\nlikely to capture true dietary variability. There was surpris-\ningly little variance in the number of major food groups\nconsumed. Several food sub-categories, which may differ\nsomewhat in nutrient composition (corn and coarse grains,\norgan meats and meat products, \u00aesh and shell\u00aesh), were\ncombined to increase the variance of the diversity score.\nScaling for this component followed the approach used\nfor the diet diversity component of the revised UNC-CH\nDQI (Haines et al, 1999). As in the UNC-CH DQI, within\neach of the four main categories (see Table 3), points were\nawarded for consumption of greater than 25 g of foods\nbelonging to nutritionally distinct sub-categories. The 25 g\ncut-off was arbitrarily chosen by Haines et al (1999) for the\nUNC-CH DQI to ensure that quantities in each subcategory\nwere large enough to be nutritionally meaningful. For each\nmain food category, points were calculated as the percen-\ntage of the maximum possible score. For example, assume\na main food category contains four distinct sub-categories.\nIf more than 25 g of foods belonging to only two (of the\npossible four) sub-categories were consumed, the score for\nthat main category would be calculated as 2a4. Due to the\nwider variety of fruit and vegetables compared with other\nfood categories, points for each main category were\nweighted such that the fruit and vegetable category\naccounted for 40% of the total diversity score (maximum\nworth 12 points). The remaining three main categories each\ncontributed 20% to the total. Weighted points from each of\nthe four main food categories were next summed to\ncalculate the total diet variety score. Since low food\ndiversity is an inadequate aspect of dietary intake, the\ntotal diversity score was assigned a negative scale, such\nthat the diversity score ranged from \u00c012 to zero.\nFruit and vegetables. The fruit and vegetable component of\nthe DQI evaluated both total consumption of fruit and\nvegetables as well as speci\u00aec consumption of carotene-\nrich vegetables (carotene content exceeds 90 Rea100 g).\nThe aggregate food group was chosen to match the Dietary\nGuidelines, which explicitly combine vegetable and fruit\nconsumption, as well as indexing bene\u00aecial components of\nthese foods, such as \u00aeber. Special attention was given to\ncarotene-rich vegetables, since greater carotene intakes are\nrecommended to reduce vitamin A de\u00aeciency, improve\noverall health and possibly protect against cancer and\natherogenesis (Mahan & Escott-Stump, 1996; Thomas,\nTotal fruit and vegetable intake was evaluated based on\nthe Food Guide Pagoda recommendation to consume 500 \u00b1\nquantitative recommendations for consumption of caro-\ntene-rich vegetables were unavailable for China, we\nTable 1 Dietary guidelines for Chinese residents proposed by the standing board of the Chinese Nutrition Society and the\ncorresponding components for the China DQI\nDietary guidelines for Chinese residents Corresponding component(s) in the China DQI\n(1) Eat a variety of foods, with cereals as the staple Diet variety\nTotal carbohydrate\n(2) Consume plenty of vegetables, fruit and tubers Fruit and vegetables\n(3) Consume milk, beans or dairy- or bean-products everyday Protein\nCalcium\n(4) Consume appropriate amounts of \u00aesh, poultry, eggs and lean meat; reduce\nfatty meat and animal fat in the diet\nProtein\nTotal fat\nSaturated fat\n(5) Balance food intake with physical activity to maintain a healthy body weight Total energy\n(6) Choose a light diet that is also low in salt Sodium\n(7) If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in limited amounts Alcoholic beverages\n(8) Avoid unsanitary and spoiled foods\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nTable 2 Components of the Chinese DQI applied to data on 7450 adults participating in the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey\nComponents Score Intake range Percentage adults (aged 20 \u00b1 59) Component score mean (s.d.)\nComponents indexing aspects of undernutrition only\nComponents indexing aspects of overnutrition only\nComponents indexing both under- and overnutrition\nTable 3 Percentage of adults (n  7450) in the 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey consuming foods in the diet\nvariety food subgroups\nFood subgroups Representative foods\nPercentage of\npopulation consuming\nCereals and Tubers\nRice and products Steamedaboiled rice, rice products 85.4\nWheat and products Bread, pancake, noodles 71.3\nCorn, coarse grains and products Corn\u00afour products, barley, oatmeal millet, buckwheat 18.1\nStarchy roots and products Sweet potato, yam, taro 21.3\nAnimal Foods\nRed meat and products Beef, pork, lamb, liver, sausage 64.6\nPoultry and game Chicken, duck, rabbit 10.8\nFish and shell\u00aesh Fish, shrimp, mussel 30.6\nBeans and dairy products\nLegumes and products Soybean, mung bean, fresh and dried tofu 51.7\nMilk and dairy products Milk, milk powder, cheese 3.4\nVegetables and fruit\nDark-colored vegetables Spinach, carrot, tomato 55.4\nLight-colored vegetables Cabbage, potatoes, cucumber, pickles 93.6\nFruit Fresh and dried fruit 15.1\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nadapted the procedure used in the development of the US\nNational Food Guide (Welsh, 1994) to estimate an optimal\nintake of this food group. Brie\u00afy, using dietary data for\nadults aged 20 \u00b1 59 from the China Health and Nutrition\nSurveys (described below), we calculated the 3-day average\namount of carotene-rich vegetables (g) consumed per meal\nper consumer (raw \u00d0 before cooking). The resulting\namount (134 g) was rounded to an easy to use number\n(150 g). Next, we estimated the carotene content of this\ngroup by calculating the weighted average content of the 20\nmost frequently consumed carotene-rich vegetables\ntion of approximately twice the average amount per meal\n(300 g) of carotene-rich vegetables could meet 90% of the\nChinese RDA for retinol equivalents (800 Re). Given that\ntwice the average amount consumed at a single meal is (1)\na logistically reasonable amount to consume in one day,\nand (2) it allows moderate to high carotene intakes as\nde\u00aened by the RDA, we set optimal intake of carotene-rich\nIn order to identify fruit and vegetable-dense diets (as\nopposed to high absolute intakes), separate standards were\ndeveloped for higher and lower energy intake categories.\nThe energy intake cut-off of 2600 kcal represents the\nChinese RDA for male adults assuming light physical\nactivity and approximates the energy RDA for females\nassuming moderate activity (2700 kcal). For individuals\nwith energy intakes above 2600 kcal, optimal intake was\nde\u00aened as 700 g of total fruit and vegetable consumption\nincluding 300 g (or 40% of the total) of carotene-rich\nvegetables. For individuals with energy intakes below this\nthreshold, optimal intake was de\u00aened as 500 g of total fruit\nand vegetable intake, including 200 g (40% of the total).\nScores for the fruit and vegetable component of the DQI\nwere calculated as follows and capped at 12 points:\nHigher energy intake: fruit and vegetable score\nLower energy intake: fruit and vegetable score\nwhere TVF is total vegetables and fruit (g) and CV is\ncarotene-rich vegetables (g).\nSince low fruit and vegetable intake is an inadequate\naspect of dietary intake and poor diet quality, this score was\nassigned a negative scale, ranging from \u00c012 to zero.\nTotal energy. Cut-offs for the energy intake component of\nthe DQI were chosen to distinguish between differences in\nenergy intake that may result in weight loss or gain over\ntime. Optimal energy intake was determined to be within a\nrange around the age-, sex- and physical activity-speci\u00aec\nRDA (see Table 4). The ability of the DQI to meaningfully\nrank individuals in the CHNS sample also in\u00afuenced our\ndecisions for these cut-offs. A score of zero was awarded\nsex- and physical activity-speci\u00aec RDA. Mean energy\nwere considered low and given negative scores of \u00c05 and\n\u00c010 points, respectively. Mean intakes between 120%\nhigh, and given positive scores of 5 and 10 points,\nrespectively.\nTotal carbohydrate. The American and Canadian Dietary\nGuidelines recommend that the percentage of energy from\ncircumstances in China, where subsets of the population (eg\npoor and rural groups) are at risk from over-consumption of\ncarbohydrate and underconsumption of protein and fat,\nboth minimum and maximum targets for carbohydrate\nconsumption were deemed necessary. For this DQI com-\nponent, the cut-off for minimum optimal intake was set at\n55% of energy. A cut-off for maximum optimal intake was\narbitrarily set at 69% of energy. Total carbohydrate intakes\nbetween 55 and 69% of energy received zero points. Lower\npositive points, 5 and 10, respectively. Higher intakes\npoints, \u00c05 and\u00c010 points, respectively.\nTotal Fat. According to the China National Nutrition\nSurvey, the mean total fat intake is 22% of energy (Ge\net al, 1996). In keeping with the WHOaFAO recommenda-\ntion Society recommends a minimum total fat intake of\n15% of energy (personal communication). Although many\nWestern countries and the World Health Organization\nrecommend that total fat intake should not exceed 30%\nof daily total energy intake (Thomas 1991; Wardlaw &\nGordon, 1993), evidence suggests that greater health ben-\ne\u00aets may be achieved with further reductions (Thomas,\nSince the level of fat consumption in China is low relative\nto other countries, a lower maximum recommended intake\nmay not only be bene\u00aecial, but practical. In 1989, The\nChinese Nutrition Society proposed that optimal total fat\nGreater than 15%, but less than 25% of energy from fat was\nchosentorepresentoptimaltotalfatintakeforthe DQI.Three-\ndaymeantotal fatintakeswithinthisrange were awardedzero\npoints. Mean total fat intakes between 25 and 30% of energy\nreceived a score of 5, while intakes over 30% received a score\nwere scored \u00c05 and \u00c010, respectively.\nSaturated fat. Suf\u00aecient evidence suggests that greater\nbene\u00aets might be achieved if saturated fat intake is reduced\nto 7 or 8% of energy intake, less than the 10% of energy\ncurrently recommended in North America (Thomas 1991;\nrationale, saturated fat intakes of less than 7% of energy\nreceived the maximum score of zero points for this DQI\ncomponent. The upper limit of intake was considered to be\n10% of energy intake. Saturated fat intakes above this level\nProtein. Cut-offs for the protein component of the DQI\nwere based on the proportion of energy derived from\nprotein intake. Optimal protein intake was considered the\namount relative to energy intake required to avoid protein\nenergy malnutrition. Optimal protein intake was arbitrarily\nde\u00aened as above 10% of energy from protein. Protein\nintakes between 8 and 10% of energy received\u00c05 points.\nNegative points (\u00c010) were awarded for mean protein\nintakes less than 8% of energy.\nCalcium. Considering both the greater within-person varia-\ntion for calcium vs macronutrient intakes and the low\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\ncalcium intakes in the population, a cut-off of 67% was\narbitrarily chosen for optimal intake. Calcium intakes over\nCAPM, 1991) were assigned zero points. Calcium intakes\nbetween 50% and 66% of the RDA received \u00c05 points.\nIntakes below 50% of the RDA were assigned \u00c010 points.\nSodium. Sodium intake cut-offs for the DQI re\u00afect the\nChinese Nutrition Society recommendation to reduce salt\nupper limit for sodium intake of 4000 mg was calculated to\nre\u00afect consumption of 10 g of salt. Sodium intakes above\nthis level were scored 10 points. Optimal intake was\nde\u00aened according to the World Health Organization recom-\nmendation of 6 g of salt, equivalent to 2400 mg of sodium\nthis cut-off received the optimal zero points. Sodium\npoints.\nAlcoholic beverages. The Standing Board of the Chinese\nNutrition Society recommends a maximum limit of 50 g (1\nliang) of 38% alcohol for both men and women (personal\ncommunication, unpublished proceedings, June 1998). This\namount is equivalent to approximately 19 ml of pure\nassign points for the alcohol component of the DQI,\nreported alcohol intakes (g) were \u00aerst expressed as a\npercentage of the beverage-speci\u00aec standard. Consumption\nof alcohol above 100% of the recommended maximum\namount received 6 points. Consumption of less than half of\nthe recommended maximum amount received zero points.\nLastly, individuals consuming between 50 and 100% of the\nrecommended amount received 3 points.\nCalculating the Chinese DQI total score and pattern score\nAs described above, the DQI components were scored to\nre\u00afect aspects of undernutrition and overnutrition, respec-\ntively. The undernutrition-related components have nega-\ntive scores; conversely, those re\u00afecting aspects of\novernutrition have positive scores. This paper proposes\ntwo ways to combine the component scores, each offering\ndifferent information.\nThe \u00aerst way of looking at average total diet quality is to\ncreate a DQI total score by summing the component scores.\nAnalogous to the USDA HEI and UNC-CH DQI, the DQI\ntotal score provides information on the position of the diet,\nhow the diet looks, on average, tending more towards\nunder- or overnutrition. A negative total DQI score repre-\nsents a diet that is overall undernourishing, while a positive\nscore represents a diet which overall appears overnourish-\ning. A zero score meets all component criteria for diet\nquality.\nGiven the emphasis of the Dietary Guidelines for Chi-\nnese Residents on aspects of undernutrition, there are more\nnegative-scoring components than positive-scoring compo-\nnents. More negative-scoring components together with\nequally weighted nutrient-level components (above ideal\nfat intake scores  5 points, below ideal fat intake scores\n\u00c05 points) mean that the resulting DQI total score is a\ncontinuous variable that ranges from \u00c074 to 56 points.\nMore explicitly, the total DQI score does not have a range\nfrom \u00c050 to  50, because to create such a range we\nwould have had to contradict the Guidelines for Chinese\nResidents by weighting overnutrition-related components\nmore than undernutrition-related components.\nThe second way of evaluating the DQI components is to\nlook at the range of problems affecting the diets. A DQI\nscore of zero could re\u00afect a diet that meets all component\ncriteria for diet quality, or a diet with under- and over-\nnutrition problems that appear to cancel each other out. We\nhave combined the DQI component scores into two con-\ntinuous variables: a lower bound score (the sum of the\nnegative scores) and a diet-quality distance (sum of the\nabsolute values of each DQI component) to get at this issue.\nThe DQI distance re\u00afects the types or combination of diet-\nquality problems in a particular diet. While a DQI distance\nequal to zero would indicate no under- or overnutrition\ndietary problems, a non-zero DQI distance would indicate\nsome combination of dietary problems. The DQI lower\nbound positions the DQI distance along the spectrum from\nunder to overnutrition. Together the DQI lower bound and\nDQI distance re\u00afect the distribution of under- and over-\nnutrition problems in a particular diet. The DQI lower\nbound and distance can be used as continuous variables\nin analyses or converted into pattern types according to cut-\noffs speci\u00aeed by the researcher. Below we present exam-\nples of why and how the DQI total score, continuous and\ncategorical pattern variables might be used in analyses.\nEf\u00aecacy of the Chinese DQI total score and pattern\nvariables \u00d0 application to data from a large sample from\nthe China Health and Nutrition Surveys\nData from the China Health and Nutrition Surveys (CHNS)\nwere used to evaluate the ef\u00aecacy of the Chinese DQI\nscores against a priori expectations of how the DQI should\nperform. If researchers are interested in positioning a diet\nalong the spectrum of undernutrition to overnutrition, they\nmight want to use the DQI total score. The DQI total score\nwas intended and expected to re\u00afect the shift from under-\nto overnutrition by correlating negatively with total carbo-\nhydrate intake (as a percentage of energy), and positively\nwith other food and nutrient intakes. The DQI total score\nwas expected to be signi\u00aecantly higher for urban residents\nand higher income groups, since urbanization and devel-\nopment are primary engines of the nutrition transition\nFinally, a direct association was expected between total\nDQI score and body mass index (BMI), since underweight\nstatus would be more likely among those who are under-\nnourished and overweight status more likely among those\nwho are overnourished.\nTable 4 Chinese RDAs for energy and calcium\nEnergy (kcal)\nCalcium\nActivity level Male Female (mg)\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nAn example question that researchers might want to\naddress with the continuous DQI lower bound and distance\nvariables involves the overall number of diet-quality pro-\nblems. How do diets with only undernutrition-related\nproblems differ from diets with both under- and over-\nnutrition problems? Holding the DQI lower bound constant,\nas the DQI distance (absolute number of component pro-\nblems) increases, we would expect positive DQI compo-\nnent scores, food and nutrient intakes, and the risk of\noverweight status to increase.\nTo provide an example of the utility of categorical DQI\npatterns, suppose researchers wish to compare subjects\nwhose diets meet all component criteria for diet quality\nwith subjects whose DQI component scores cancel each\nother out (making them only appear to have zero total DQI\nscores). The subjects whose component scores cancel out,\nby de\u00aenition, experience both undernutrition- and over-\nnutrition-related problems. Thus, these subjects would be\nexpected to score higher on overnutrition-related compo-\nnents (eg total fat intake), lower on undernutrition-related\ncomponents (eg protein or calcium intake), and to be more\nlikely to be overweight andaor underweight than subjects\nwith `truly' optimal diet quality. Sociodemographic\ncorrelates of each DQI pattern could also be explored.\nfrom the 1991 panel of the China Health and Nutrition\nSurvey were used for this analysis. The China Health and\nNutrition Surveys cover eight provinces that vary substan-\ntially in geography, economic development, public\nresources and health indicators (Guangxi, Guizhou,\nHenan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong).\nThe sampling procedures and data used in this survey are\ndescribed elsewhere in detail (eg Popkin et al, 1993;\nDetailed household- and individual-level food consump-\ntion data were collected for three consecutive days, ran-\ndomly allocated from Monday to Sunday. Household food\nconsumption was determined on a daily basis by calculat-\ning changes in food inventory. Chinese scales with a\nminimum and maximum limit of 20 g and 15 kg, respec-\ntively, were used. All foods in stock at the initiation of the\nsurvey (including edible oils, sugar and salt), foods pur-\nchased andaor produced at home during the survey period,\nand food preparation waste (including spoiled rice or food\nfed to animals) were weighed and considered in the\ncalculation of household food consumption.\nIndividual-level dietary intake data for all household\nmembers for each of the three survey days were obtained\nvia a 24 h diet recall interview. Composite dishes were\nrecorded in terms of their raw ingredients. Individual\nconsumption of fat and seasonings, added during cooking,\nwas estimated from the household-level oil and condiment\ndata. The 1991 Food Composition Table for China (INFH-\nCAPM, 1991) was used to calculate mean energy and\nnutrient intakes.\nAnalysis. Food group, energy and nutrient data were used to\ncalculate a score for each DQI component for each indivi-\ndual. The sample distribution across each component was\nexamined.\nTo determine if the DQI total score met the aim to\nposition diets with respect to diet quality de\u00aened along a\nspectrum from under- to overnutrition, the DQI total score\nwas compared with food and nutrient intakes. Pearson\ncorrelation coef\u00aecients were calculated to evaluate the\ncorrelation between the total DQI score and food group,\nenergy or nutrient intakes. To determine if the DQI total\nscore re\u00afected expected relationships between diet and\nsociodemographic and anthropometric variables, we \u00aet an\nOLS regression model with total score as the outcome and\nurban residence and income as the independent variables,\nas well as logistic regression models with total DQI score\npredicting risk of underweight or overweight status. A\npearson correlation coef\u00aecient was also calculated between\nDQI total score and BMI.\nWith respect to the continuous DQI lower bound and\nDQI distance variables, we used OLS and logistic regres-\nsion models to test the hypothesis that positive DQI\ncomponent scores, food and nutrient intakes, and weight\nstatus would increase with increasing DQI distance, con-\ntrolling for DQI lower bound. No other covariates were\nincluded in the OLS and logistic regression models.\nAs an example of how researchers might categorize DQI\npatterns to identify and characterize different types of poor\ndiet quality, we classi\u00aeed individuals into six diet quality\npatterns (A, B, C, D, E, F), arbitrarily de\u00aened based on: a\nDQI distance above or below 30, and the proportion of the\n(see Figure 2). We chose the \u00aerst cut-off, considering that\nsubjects with DQI distances of less than 30 would have\noptimal scores (zero) for 5 \u00b1 7 out of the 10 DQI compo-\nnents. The second set of cut-offs was used to classify diets\nFigure 2 DQI patterns (A \u00b1 F) differ with respect to their underlying\ncombination of under- and overnutrition problems, position along the\nspectrum from under- to overnutrition, and overall number of diet-quality\nproblems. Mean DQI lower bound (the sum of the negative DQI compo-\nnent scores) and DQI distance (sum of the absolute values of each DQI\ncomponent score) were calculated for each of the six DQI Patterns (A \u00b1 F)\nPatterns A \u00b1 F were arbitrarily de\u00aened based on: a DQI distance above\nor below 30, and the proportion of the DQI distance in the positive\nshift from predominantly undernutrition- to predominantly overnutrition-\nrelated problems. Pattern A describes diets with DQI distances greater than\ncomponents, or 5 or \u00c05 on six out of 10 components) with the majority of\ndiet quality problems on the undernutrition side (46% of the sample).\nPattern B describes diets with a majority of undernutrition problems, but\nfewer overall problems (less than the 30 point distance cut-off) (6% of the\nsample). Pattern C describes diets which have many problems which are\nequally distributed in under- and overnutrition (24% of the sample).\nPattern D represents the situation with few diet-quality problems, equally\ndistributed between under- and overnutrition (4% of the sample). Patterns\nE and F, together accounting for 19% of the sample, represent fewer vs\nmany overnutrition-related problems, respectively.\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\naccording to how much of the DQI distance range falls to\none side of zero. We decided that a diet with more or less\nequal proportions of undernutrition and overnutrition pro-\nblems should have no less than 40% and no more than 60%\nof the DQI distance on one side of zero. These pattern cut-\noffs were intended for illustrative purposes only. Research-\ners are encouraged to de\u00aene diet patterns according to their\nhypotheses of interest.\nTo test our example hypothesis concerning diets approx-\nimating the diet-quality ideal vs diets with diet-quality\nproblems that appear to cancel each other out, we used\nt-tests to compare the mean DQI component scores of\npatterns D and C. Logistic regression models with over-\nweight status, underweight status, or urbanarural residence\nas the outcome, pattern C as exposure of interest, and\npattern D as reference group were also \u00aet to test for\nexpected differences by diet pattern. No covariates were\nincluded in the logistic regression models.\nResults\nComponents of the diet-quality index\nTable 3 shows the proportion of the sample who consumed\nfoods belonging to major food groups included in the diet\nvariety component. While over 70% of the sample con-\nsumed rice, wheat, or their products during the 3 day survey\nperiod, relatively few subjects (20%) consumed corn,\ncoarse grains or starchy roots. Red meat was the most\nconsumed animal food in this sample. Approximately 65%\nof the sample consumed red meat or a red meat product\nduring the survey period. Consumption of other animal\nfoods was much lower. Roughly a third of the sample\nconsumed some \u00aesh during the 3 day survey. Just over half\nof the sample consumed legumes or legume products. Only\na tiny minority (3% of the sample) consumed milk or dairy\nproducts. Although close to 100% of the sample consumed\nlight-colored vegetables with lower carotene content, only\n55% and 15% of the sample consumed carotene-rich dark-\ncolored vegetables and fruit, respectively.\nThe sample distribution across categories of each DQI\ncomponent and the mean scores for each DQI component\nare presented in Table 2. Over 50% of the sample had\noptimal intakes for the alcohol, protein, energy and satu-\nrated fat components. At the other extreme, a majority of\nthe sample received the worst possible scores (\u00c010 or 10)\nfor the calcium and sodium components. Diet variety and\nfruit and vegetable intake were less than optimal for over\n80% of the sample. As might be expected, the mean\ncomponent scores for the components indexing both\nunder- and overnutrition appeared close to zero \u00d0 or indi-\ncative of good diet quality. These mean scores concealed\nthe fact that only 30 \u00b1 40% of the sample had optimal\ncarbohydrate and total fat intake. For the energy, carbohy-\ndrate and total fat components, 10 \u00b1 15% of the sample had\nvery low intakes, while 10 \u00b1 30% had very high intakes.\nOverall, it appears that the greatest current problems for the\npresent sample are high sodium, low calcium, variety, and\nfruit and vegetable intake. Moderate problems include\nmodest underconsumption of protein, and both under- and\noverconsumption of total fat and carbohydrate.\nThe DQI total score correlates with food and nutrient\nintakes\nThe mean (s.d.) value for the DQI total score was \u00c08.7\n(19.8). Variation in the total DQI score appeared related to\nvariation in each of the component aspects of diet quality.\nTable 5 presents the mean intakes of fruit and vegetables,\nenergy and nutrients by total score groups. As expected, the\ntotal DQI score appeared positively and signi\u00aecantly cor-\nrelated with fruit and vegetable, carotene-rich vegetable,\nenergy, protein, calcium, sodium and alcohol intakes. Mean\nfruit and vegetable and calcium intakes more than doubled\nbetween the bottom and top DQI total score groups.\nEnergy, total fat and protein intakes increased by 50%, 5-\nfold and 15%, respectively, from the bottom to top total\nscore groups. Carbohydrate intake decreased signi\u00aecantly\nwith DQI total score. The DQI total score was also\npositively and signi\u00aecantly related to nutrients not expli-\ncitly covered by the DQI, namely retinol, vitamin C, iron,\nniacin, ribo\u00afavin, zinc, mono- and polyunsaturated fat\nintakes (data not shown, but P-values all ` 0.001). The\nresults indicate that with this DQI structure, the more food\nconsumed, the higher the total DQI score (the further from\nundernutrition, the closer towards overnutrition).\nThe DQI total score covaries with urban residence and\nincome\nMajor determinants of dietary change in China are urbani-\nzation and development. If urbanization and development\nare linked with the nutrition transition, we might expect\nurban areas and higher income groups to have higher DQI\ntotal scores than rural areas and lower income groups.

Together the DQI\nlower bound and DQI distance describe the distribution or\ncombination of under- and overnutrition problems in a\nparticular diet. As expected, signi\u00aecant linear associations\nwere consistently observed in OLS models with the con-\ntinuous DQI lower bound and DQI distance variables as\nindependent predictors of food and nutrient intakes (see\nFor each unit increase in DQI lower bound, fruit and\nvegetable, energy, total fat, saturated fat, MUFA and\nPUFA, sodium and calcium intakes increased signi\u00aecantly,\nwhile carbohydrate and intake decreased signi\u00aecantly,\nindependent of the DQI distance. As expected, the DQI\ndistance re\u00afected the overall extent of both under- and\novernutrition-related diet-quality problems. Increases in the\nDQI distance were signi\u00aecantly associated with increasing\nenergy, total fat, saturated fat, MUFA and PUFA, and\nsodium, and decreasing fruit and vegetable intake, carbo-\nhydrate, calcium, \u00aeber and vitamin C.

A DQI for\nChina is needed to understand the causes and consequences\nof shifts in whole diets, as opposed to singular nutrients or\nfood groups. Unlike nutrient de\u00aeciency syndromes, chronic\ndiseases, which are increasingly prevalent in China, are\nthought to involve multiple risk factors and whole pro\u00aeles\nof nutrient intake, rather than single nutrients. Measures of\noverall diet quality capture diets as a whole, and avoid\ncolinearity problems associated with food- or nutrient-\nspeci\u00aec measures.\nThe development of the DQI for China began with\nexisting DQI methodology for the US (Kant, 1996),\nwhich maximizes information on both macro- and micro-\nnutrients, as well as relying on national guidelines to insure\napplicability across population sub-groups and easy-inter-\npretation by policy makers. The DQI for China differs from\nthe US DQI and USDA HEI (Kennedy et al, 1995;\n1999) by explicitly de\u00aening diet quality in terms of both\nunder- and overnutrition, as well as by incorporating\ninformation about the direction, in addition to the distance,\nstrayed from ideal diet quality. Both the USDA HEI and\nUNC-CH DQI provide a composite score showing the\nrelative distance of a given diet from an ideal: overall,\nwhere is the diet with respect to where it should be? Both\nindexes are additive and monotonically related to most\nnutrient intakes, such that a medium score re\u00afects\na medium intake of most nutrients. While the structure of\nthe US DQIs is informative and readily interpretable,\nthese indexes do not provide information on underlying\ncombinations of dietary problems. When diet quality is\ntwo-dimensional, de\u00aened to exclude both under- and over-\nnutrition, the restriction to direct relationships inherent\nin existing DQI structures may be too limiting. Important\ninformation about different patterns of diet quality may be\nmissed. This DQI was designed to capture whole diet\nexposures among adult groups living in China. Adult\nRDAs, which are intended for evaluating the diets of\ngroups, as opposed to individual dietary intake, were used\nto determine several of the DQI component scores.\nResearchers using this tool should be aware that this DQI\nmay be inappropriate for individuals, children, adolescents\nor elderly groups.\nCan the China DQI be used for research or policymaking?\nResearch and policy-making depend on tools that success-\nfully identify and characterize exposures of interest. The\nproposed DQI is a \u00afexible tool in that it can address\ndifferent types of questions with different exposures of\ninterest. We have shown that the DQI can be used to\nposition diets along the spectrum from under- to ovenrutri-\ntion andaor classify individuals with different combinations\nof diet-quality problems. If the interest is in determining\nwhere a diet falls on average, the total DQI score would be\nappropriate. If, on the other hand, comparisons between\ntypes of diets are warranted, the DQI pattern approach\nwould be more useful.\nThe continuous DQI distance and categorical DQI\npatterns provide a quick sense of the range and types of\nnutritional problems to tackle. Given that, in the present\nanalyses, various combinations of under- and overnutrition\nproblems were apparent, this new methodology may offer\nimportant new information. Using the DQI distance vari-\nable, for example, we saw that urban residents have more\nproblems overall, related to both under- and overnutrition,\nthan rural residents.\nThis \u00aending is qualitatively different from the \u00aending\nthat urban residents are further along the spectrum towards\novernutrition than rural residents \u00d0 the conclusion\nresearchers would draw from using the total DQI score.\nKnowing that rural residents have bothamore problems can\nbetter inform policy and interventions.\nThe total DQI score is ef\u00aecacious in that it captures\ndesired whole diet exposures and covaries with known\ncorrelates of dietary intake. The DQI components each\nre\u00afected expected dietary patterns, corresponding with\npreviously reported results. Together the proposed compo-\nnents provide an index that allows us to address major\nproblems in China, including inadequate intake of calcium\nand excessive salt intake (related to public health problems\nsuch as hypertension, rickets and osteoporosis) (Ge et al,\nscore was signi\u00aecantly correlated with food and nutrient\nintakes, and directly associated with BMI. The DQI total\nscore correlated as would be expected with urbanarural\nresidence and income. The DQI pattern scores correlated\nwith DQI components and weight status, as expected.\nSince the purpose of these analyses was to demonstrate\nthe meaning of the DQI scores by con\u00aerming expected\ncorrelations, the observed associations were unadjusted.\nThese analyses in no way attempted to establish causal\nrelationships between the DQI and anthropometric or\nsociodemographic variables. Further work is needed to\nevaluate the causes and consequences of DQI exposures.\nMeasurement of dietary data is highly problematic\n(Willett, 1998). A comparison of the results from the\n1991 CHNS survey with results using identical measure-\nment but more in-depth probing for salt intake suggests that\nthe 1991 CHNS results do not adequately measure salt\nMeasuring diet quality in China\nJD Stookey et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nintake. They do, however, capture the remarkably low\nvariation of salt intake across individuals in China\n(Popkin et al, 1997). Despite lowered con\u00aedence in the\navailable estimates of absolute salt intake, we believe the\n1991 CHNS data are adequate for relative ranking of\nsubjects. The present application of the China DQI to this\ndata may have misclassi\u00aeed subjects in a way which could\naffect the overall DQI scores. Optimal performance of the\nChina DQI depends on valid multi-level dietary data.\nThe China DQI captures variation along several compo-\nnents of diet quality, as well as complex relationships\nbetween these multiple dimensions.* Considering that the\nindex appears sensitive to both diet and weight risk factors\nfor under- and overnutrition, it constitutes a useful tool for\nstudying the nutrition transition and epidemiologic trends\nin China. More speci\u00aecally, this tool allows monitoring of\noverall dietary change and exploration of the effects of\nwhole-diet exposures de\u00aened according to current Dietary\nGuidelines for Chinese Residents. The development of\nsimilar DQI could inform nutrition monitoring and\nepidemiologic research in other developing countries.\nReferences\nChen JD & Xu H (1996): Historical development of Chinese dietary\npatterns and nutrition from the ancient to the modern society.
