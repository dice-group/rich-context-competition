Williams, PhD; Randolph Nesse, MD;\nRobert Joseph Taylor, PhD; Kai McKeever Bullard, MPH; Myriam Torres, MS; James S. Jackson, PhD\nContext: Little is known about differences in the un-\nmet need for mental health service use between African\nAmericans and Caribbean blacks.\nObjective: To extend the National Survey of Black\nAmericans by examining 12-month mental health ser-\nvice use for African Americans and Caribbean blacks from\nthe recently completed National Survey of American Life.\nDesign and Setting: National household probability\nsamples of noninstitutionalized African Americans and\nCaribbean blacks (blacks from Caribbean area coun-\ntries now living in the United States) conducted be-\nmodified World Mental Health version of the World\nHealth Organization's Composite International Diagnos-\ntic Interview.\nMain Outcome Measures: Proportion of respon-\ndents with 12-month DSM-IV disorders who sought help\nin the specialty mental health, general medical, human\nservice, and complementary-alternative medicine treat-\nment sectors. The percentage receiving minimally ad-\nequate treatment was also assessed.\nResults: Overall, 10.1% of respondents used some form\nof mental heath care services in the past year. Use of ser-\nvices was much higher among those who met criteria for\na 12-month DSM-IV disorder (31.9%) than among those\nwho did not (5.4%). Forty-nine percent of respondents\nwith serious mental illness used services, whereas 39.3%\nhad contact with mental health care specialists. The\nyoungest and oldest age groups were least likely to ob-\ntain any services. Among African Americans, women were\nmore likely than men to use general medical care and ser-\nvices from any sector. Respondents with the most years\nof education showed the highest use of services.\nConclusions: The underuse of mental health services\namong black Americans remains a serious concern. Edu-\ncational interventions that focus on both consumers and\nmental health care professionals are needed.\nNational Survey of Black\nAmericans (NSBA) pro-\nduced the first national data\non how symptoms of dis-\ntress are defined and responded to by black\nAmericans.1,2 The NSBA found that most\nblack Americans did not seek mental\nhealth services in response to emotional\ndistress. Predating the DSM-III, the men-\ntal health need-assessment approach taken\nby the NSBA grew out of an epidemio-\nlogic tradition that emphasized how varia-\ntion in personal problem definitions is re-\nlated to patterns of help-seeking behavior.3\nInterestingly, because personal distress was\ndefined from a lay community perspec-\ntive and not within a medical diagnostic\ntaxonomy, it was difficult to draw firm con-\nclusions about the extent of unmet need\nfor mental health treatment on the basis\nof the NSBA.4,5 In this article, we use data\nfrom the recently conducted National Sur-\nvey of American Life (NSAL) to examine\nhelp seeking for mental disorders in an eth-\nnically diverse sample of black Ameri-\ncans. The NSAL extends the NSBA in 2 im-\nportant ways. First, the NSAL uses the\nComposite International Diagnostic In-\nterview to estimate service use among per-\nsons with DSM-IV criteria for selected men-\ntal disorders. Second, it addresses the issue\nof black ethnic variation by including\nsamples of both African Americans and Ca-\nribbean blacks.\nIt is estimated that Caribbean-de-\nscended and immigrant groups consti-\ntute 10% to 15% of the United States' black\npopulation.

Unfortunately, no studies have\naddressed black ethnic variation in help seeking for men-\ntal disorders within the United States. The few studies7-9\nthat have examined help seeking among Caribbean blacks\nhave been conducted in the United Kingdom. As a re-\nsult, many questions remain unanswered regarding\nwhether Caribbean blacks and African Americans actu-\nally differ in mental health service use.\nStudying blacks of different ethnic origins is impor-\ntant for public mental health service professionals be-\ncause of questions about the contribution of culture to\npopulation group differences in behavior.10-13 Hypoth-\neses related to assumed differences in such social pro-\ncesses as group identity, acculturation, nativity, and im-\nmigration suggest that sociodemographic factors have\ndifferential effects on treatment seeking across different\nethnic groups.14-17 Although such an initial demographic\nanalysis cannot speak directly to culture, it begins to iden-\ntify directions for future research on differences in psy-\nchosocial processes related to culture and mental health.18\nGiven the virtual absence of findings in this area, we\ntake an exploratory, descriptive approach to this first ar-\nticle on mental health services. Nevertheless, on the ba-\nsis of findings from the general services literature and our\nprevious work with African Americans, we have some ex-\npectations. We predict that Caribbean blacks will be less\nlikely than African Americans to use medical and men-\ntal health services. We predict significant differences in\nthe use of services for other demographic variables, al-\nthough we are unsure about how uniform these relation-\nships will be across the 2 ethnic groups and across the\nmultiple service domains explored. Specifically, we pre-\ndict that both income and education will show a posi-\ntive relationship with use of services, that women will\nbe more likely than men to use services, that insured\npeople will be more likely than uninsured people to seek\nprofessional help, and that the oldest respondents (65\nyears) will be least likely to use services.\nIn summary, the NSAL is an excellent resource to ex-\nplore the extent to which both groups receive mental\nhealth services and the nature of ethnic differences in the\nunmet need for mental health care. No national studies\nhave measured the prevalence of mental disorders in con-\njunction with help seeking in representative national\nsamples of both African American and Caribbean blacks.\nThis article describes the use of general medical, spe-\ncialty mental health care, human services, and comple-\nmentary-alternative medical resources for mental health\nproblems and selected, discrete mental disorders.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NSAL was part of a National Institute of Mental Health Col-\nlaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys initiative that also\nincluded the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)\nand the National Latino and Asian American Study.19 The NSAL\nwas an integrated national household probability sample of 3570\nyears and older. The African American sample was selected ex-\nclusively from geographic segments in proportion to the Afri-\ncan American population; the Caribbean black sample was se-\nlected from the African American segments and additional\nmetropolitan segments in which blacks of Caribbean descent\nmade up more than 10% of the population.20 In both the Afri-\ncan American and Caribbean black samples, it was necessary\nfor respondents to self-identify their race as black. Those self-\nidentifying as black were included in the Caribbean black sample\nif they answered affirmatively to any of these inclusion crite-\nria: (1) West Indian or Caribbean descent, (2) from a Carib-\nbean area country, and/or (3) parents or grandparents were born\nin a Caribbean area country. Most interviews (88%) were con-\nducted face to face and 12% by telephone, using a computer-\nassisted instrument and lasting an average of 2 hours 20 min-\nutes. Data collection was completed between February 2, 2001,\nfor African Americans and 77.7% for Caribbean blacks.\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nWe measured DSM-IV disorders, both lifetime and 12 month,\nwith the World Mental Health Composite International Diag-\nnostic Interview, a structured diagnostic interview; mental dis-\norders sections were modified versions of those developed for\nthe World Mental Health project.21 The 18 twelve-month men-\ntal disorders assessed were as follows: anxiety disorders (panic\ndisorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disor-\nder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder, which was assessed using the Composite International Di-\nagnostic Interview Short Form),22 mood disorders (major\ndepressive disorder, dysthymia, and bipolar I and II disorders),\nsubstance disorders (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug\nabuse, and drug dependence), childhood disorders (opposi-\ntional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, asked only of respondents in the 18- to\n44-year age range), and eating disorders.\nSeverity of Mental Disorder\nRespondents who reported 12-month suicidal ideation or at-\ntempts, who had at least 1 nonaffective psychotic symptom plus\never being treated for psychosis, or who met 12-month crite-\nria for at least 1 disorder were divided into 1 of 3 severity gra-\ndients: serious, moderate, or mild. Severity was primarily as-\nsessed using measures of role impairment derived from the\nSheehan Disability Scale.23 The significant positive relation-\nship between the severity measure and 30-day disability, rang-\ning from a low of 0.96 disability day for respondents with mildly\nsevere mental disorders to more than 5 disability days for those\nwith serious mental disorders, speaks to the validity of the dis-\nability measure.\nService Use\nRespondents were asked if they had made contact with any-\none from a list of health care professionals for problems with\ntheir emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs\nin the past 12 months. Health care professionals were catego-\nrized into a mental health sector (psychiatrists, psychologists,\ncounselors and social workers seen in mental health settings,\nother mental health care professionals, and mental health hot-\nlines) and a general medical sector (general physicians, family\nphysicians, physician specialists, nurses, occupational thera-\npists, and other health care professionals). The term nonpsy-\nchiatrist refers to psychologists, counselors, and social work-\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\ners seen in a mental health care setting. The non\u00adhealth care\nsector included human services (religious and spiritual advis-\ners and counselors and social workers seen in non\u00admental health\nsettings) and complementary-alternative medicine (herbal-\nists, chiropractors, spiritualists, self-help groups, and Internet\nsupport groups). Twelve-month service use was defined as mak-\ning at least 1 visit to a service provider within the 12 months\nbefore the interview.\nMinimally Adequate Treatment\nMinimally adequate treatment was defined separately for each\n12-month disorder in a manner consistent with that used in\nthe NCS-R,24 as reporting either (1) at least 4 visits with any\nphysician and receiving appropriate pharmacotherapy for at least\n60 days during the past year or (2) at least 8 psychotherapy\nvisits, each averaging 30 minutes or more, with any other health\ncare professional within the health care or human services treat-\nment sectors. Complementary-alternative medicine was con-\nsidered adequate only for substance disorders and only if re-\nspondents attended at least 8 self-help sessions of any duration\nduring the past year. Appropriate pharmacotherapy for disor-\nders included antidepressants for depression and dysthymia,\nmood stabilizers or antipsychotics for bipolar disorders, anti-\ndepressants or benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders, and di-\nsulfiram for substance disorders.\nSociodemographic Correlates\nSociodemographic correlates include race/ethnicity (African\n15, or 16 years), marital status (married or cohabiting, pre-\nviously married, or never married), household income\nemployment status (working vs not working), and whether the\nrespondent had health insurance.\nCross-tabulations are presented to illustrate ethnic differ-\nences in 12-month service use. The Rao-Scott 2 represents a\ncomplex design-corrected measure of association. Logistic re-\ngression was used to examine the main effect of ethnicity on\nservice use, adjusted for demographic variables and having any\n12-month DSM-IV disorder. To account for multiple compari-\nsons, 2 values were estimated for the overall type III effects of\neach categorical predictor variable within the contexts of the\nmultivariate models. Standard errors and 95% confidence in-\ntervals reported in this article reflect adjustment for the sam-\npling design. Unless otherwise stated, P.05 on a 2-sided de-\nsign\u00adbased test of significance represented the cutoff for assessing\nstatistical significance. All analyses were conducted using SAS\nstatistical software, version 9.13, which uses the Taylor expan-\nsion approximation technique for calculating the complex de-\nsign\u00adbased estimates of variance.25\nSince the NSAL used a multistage sample design, involving\nboth clustering and stratification, specialized statistical tech-\nniques to account for the complexity of the design and associ-\nated standard errors were used. Standard errors calculated on\nthe basis of a simple random sample would not reflect the true\nvariation of estimates in the NSAL, resulting in an increased like-\nlihood of type I errors (declaring a result to be significant when\nit is not). Because standard errors adjusted for complex design\nare usually larger than nonadjusted standard errors, differences\nmay appear to be large yet not statistically significant. Further-\nmore, the Caribbean black sample is significantly more clus-\ntered than the African American sample, so the standard errors\nfor the Caribbean black sample are usually higher than those for\nthe African American sample when correctly estimated.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 focuses on the demographic correlates of 12-\nmonth service use in response to problems with emo-\ntions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or other\nNSAL respondents used some form of services for men-\ntal heath care in the past year. African Americans and Ca-\nribbean blacks differ in the use of nonhealth services (132\ncans more likely to use help. The youngest and oldest\nage groups are least likely to obtain any services in re-\nsponse to mental health problems. Women are more likely\nthan men, those not married are more likely than mar-\nried individuals, and those working are more likely than\nthose not working to use any services.\nTable 1 also gives the demographic correlates of use\nfor African Americans and Caribbean blacks. Among Afri-\ncan Americans, age is related to the use of all service sec-\ntors but only to the use of psychiatrists for Caribbean\nblacks. Among African Americans but not Caribbean\nblacks, women are more likely than men to contact gen-\neral medical care, nonhealth sectors, or any services. Both\nAfrican Americans and Caribbean black respondents with\n16 or more years of education have the highest use of\nnonpsychiatric mental health professionals. Among Afri-\ncan Americans, previously married respondents report\nmore use of services than those who are currently mar-\nried or living with their partner. Employed African Ameri-\ncans are more likely than those not working to use all\nservice sectors except for nonpsychiatric and nonhealth\nsectors. Insured Caribbean blacks are more likely than\nuninsured individuals to use psychiatrists or all services\ncombined. Insurance coverage has no influence on the\nuse of services by African Americans.\nTable 2 indicates use of services by sex and ethnic-\nity by level of mental disorder severity. Although only\n179 respondents (4.8%) without mild, moderate, or se-\nrious mental disorder use any services, 84 respondents\n(48.8%) with serious disorder use any services. A simi-\nlar relationship is seen for each service sector. Examin-\ning those with serious disorders, similar percentages of\nblacks (17 [41.5%]) obtain help from any mental health\nservice. Within the mental health services sector, how-\never, a much higher percentage of African Americans com-\nrespectively) seek help from psychiatrists. The reverse\noccurs for the use of nonpsychiatrist mental health pro-\nAmericans (19.4%) obtained help from these types of pro-\nfessionals for serious disorders. Roughly comparable per-\ncentages of both ethnic groups with serious disorders seek\nhelp from the general medical care sector.

For Caribbean blacks, the opposite occurs; women\nuse more mental health services than men, but men use\nmore medical services than women.\nTable 3 presents service sector use for each disor-\nder separately for African Americans and Caribbean\nblacks. Use of services was much higher among those who\nmet criteria for a 12-month DSM-IV disorder than among\nobtained some type of help, whereas only 204 (5.4%) of\nthose without a disorder did so. The use of any services\nfor any mood disorder is higher for African Americans:\nThe same is true for the use of psychiatrists (37 [17.8%]\nage of Caribbean blacks, however, use psychiatrists for\nbipolar disorder (6 [16.1%]), which is much more than\nComparatively large percentages of African Americans\nuse psychiatrists for major depression (32 [18.6%]), dys-\nSimilar differences are found between African Ameri-\ncans and Caribbean blacks in the use of psychiatrists for\nnot for nonpsychiatric mental health professionals, from\nTable 1.

These differ-\nences are not present for African Americans.\nTable 4 gives the results of multivariate logistic re-\ngression analyses that estimated the effect of ethnicity and\nother demographic measures to each service use sector,\nadjusting for any 12-month mental disorder. Ethnicity\nis not related to specialty mental health service use. Afri-\ncan Americans, however, are 2.7 times more likely than\nCaribbean blacks to use non\u00adhealth care services. Table 4\nalso indicates that the use of any services is associated\ninsured and having 16 or more years of education. Age\nis similarly related to the use of any mental health ser-\nvices. Those 18 to 29 years old are significantly less likely\nthan the older age groups to use general medical care for\ntreatment of mental problems. Women are more likely\nthan men to use general medical care and any non\u00ad\nhealth care services. Those with insurance are more likely\nthan the uninsured to use a psychiatrist or any health ser-\nvices. Previously married respondents are more likely than\nthe married and never married to use non\u00adhealth care\nservices. Those with the highest level of education were\nmore likely to use all health-related services sectors than\nthose with lower educational levels. Having a disorder\nincreases significantly the use of all service sectors.\nTable 5 indicates the proportion of African Ameri-\ncans and Caribbean blacks who are receiving minimally\nadequate treatment by service sectors. Overall, 63 (26.2%)\nreceived minimally adequate treatment, but the percent-\nages varied noticeably in the service sector, ranging from\nfor any mental health care services (41 [29.3%] to psy-\nchiatrists and 28 [28.5%] to nonpsychiatric mental health\ncare professionals). The percentages of patients who are\nreceiving minimally adequate treatment are higher for Ca-\nribbean blacks than for African Americans, but large stan-\ndard errors make conclusions about Caribbean blacks\nproblematic.\nTable 2.

First, the NSAL assesses\nthe presence of mental disorders, thereby addressing a\nmajor limitation of data gathered in previous mental\nhealth surveys that focused on black Americans. Second,\nthe study includes a large representative sample that\npermits the identification of mental health differences\namong groups often lumped together within the black\nAmerican population. These types of analyses are critical\nbecause of changing immigration patterns and diverging\nsocioeconomic conditions that have occurred within the\nTable 3.

Third, our study\nused novel geographical screening procedures that\nensured that every African American household in the\ncontinental United States had a known probability of\nselection.1,26,27 In addition, new methods were developed\nto ascertain the influences of structurally missing mem-\nbers of black households (eg, young men in prisons) on\nsampling and disorder estimates.1 Fourth, all respon-\ndents were selected from the targeted geographic seg-\nments in proportion to the African American and Carib-\nbean black population, making this the first national\nsample of people of different racial and ethnic groups\nwho live in the same contexts and geographical areas\n(high- and low-density, urban and rural areas).\nIn addition to these strengths, a few limitations should\nbe noted.

In addition, the NSAL did not collect data on\nspecific phobias or intermittent explosive disorder. Sec-\nond, because homeless and institutionalized individuals\nwere not included, prevalence estimates are likely lower\nthan reported. Those who did not speak English were not\nincluded, which underrepresents French-, Spanish-, and\nCreole-speaking Caribbean blacks. These groups are rela-\ntively rare in the United States, so their exclusion should\nhave minimal effects. Another limitation is the global na-\nture of our designation of Caribbean ancestry, which is\ncharacterized by heterogeneity that we were not able to\nfully explore owing to sample size limitations. Because of\nthe high clustering of Caribbean blacks and a relatively\nsmallersamplesize,theiradjustedstandarderrorsaresome-\ntimes large. A final limitation is systematic nonresponse\nto various questions. Some nonrespondents may have met\nthe criteria for a DSM-IV disorder.\nDespite the popular view that African Americans and\nCaribbean blacks represent different cultural heritages,\nthey did not differ much in the use of services. Differ-\nences observed between these 2 ethnic groups were largely\ndue to different relationships among demographic groups\nto mental health service use. This finding suggests the\npresence of interactions among ethnicity, use of ser-\nvices, and a third demographic variable. We tested the\neffect of sex and ethnicity on any services use and found\nthat the relationship of sex to use depended on ethnic-\nity. African American women were significantly more\nlikely to use services than African American men. No sex\neffect was found among Caribbean blacks (data avail-\nable from the author). The absence of sex effects on use\namong Caribbean blacks is surprising, since black women\nare typically more likely to use services than black men.28\nThe idea that requesting help is antithetical to male so-\ncialization may not be uniform across all black men. Fu-\nture work will focus more explicitly on ethnic differ-\nences in the social construction of masculine identities.\nThe findings showed that age differences in mental\nhealth care use deserve attention in future analyses of the\nNSAL. The youngest and the oldest groups, especially\namong African Americans, used services the least. These\nage differences are consistent with other research in this\nfield.18,29 Age at onset of mood disorders, which tends to\noccur at approximately 30 years, may account at least par-\ntially for the lower use among young people.30 Older re-\nspondents are known to underuse mental health ser-\nvices because of greater perceived stigma.\nThere was little evidence that respondents with higher\nincomes are more likely to use services. Education, on the\nother hand, showed a positive relationship with service\nuse. These findings are consistent with the notion that, al-\nthough related, income and education capture distinc-\ntiveaspectsofsocioeconomicposition.31 Educationislikely\na proxy for knowledge, greater attentiveness to mental\nhealth information, and awareness of the availability and\nacceptability of seeking help for mental health prob-\nlems.32 Differential access to services based on income may\nbe less striking in this sample because of working people\nhaving health insurance and poor people having Medi-\ncaid.17 Placing income and education in the same model\nmay account for some of the same variance, and the ef-\nfects of income may be mediated through education. The\nlack of an income effect might also be attributed to the size-\nable proportions of both African Americans (65.9%) and\nCaribbean blacks (62.9%) who had mental health care in-\nsurance. This level of insurance coverage is comparable\nto that in whites, and as a result, statistical power was not\na problem on the basis of a restricted range of insurance\ncoverage. There may be more of an insurance effect than\nwe were able to capture given our additive modeling ap-\nproach. Clearly, we need to know more about how both\nsocioeconomic status/position and insurance in combi-\nnation affect use across all service sectors.\nAfrican Americans and Caribbean blacks who sought\nprofessional help for mental health problems used gen-\neral medical care almost as much as specialty mental health\ncare. The relative accessibility of primary care physicians\nand the limitations that most health insurance plans put\nin place to control the use of specialty mental health care\nmake this the most likely pattern of use.33-35 The large per-\nTable 5.

We believe that professionals trained especially to\ndeal with mental health problems (ie, psychiatrists, psy-\nchologists, and social workers) are best suited to handle\nthe treatment of these mental disorders.\nAlthough not the focus of the present study, the pro-\nportion of NSAL respondents who obtained 12-month\nservice use (10.1%) is noticeably lower than the percent-\nage reported by the NCS-R (17.9%).24 This finding is com-\npelling evidence that the black-white difference in the\nuse of mental health services remains an issue worthy of\nmore in-depth investigation. Differences were also found\nin the sociodemographic correlates of 12-month service\nuse between the NSAL and the NCS-R; specifically, not\nhaving a low family income, previously being married,\nand not living in a rural area. Income and marital status\nwere not significant predictors of use in the NSAL, whereas\neducation was. These patterns suggest interesting inter-\nactions among race, sociodemographic predictors, and\nservice use that can be explored once the NSAL and NCS-R\ndata are merged.\nSome findings in the literature suggest that although\nthe black-white gap in use may be narrowing,36 racial dis-\nparities may occur in the quality of mental health treat-\nment.37 Rates of minimally adequate treatment are lower\nAlthough the level of minimally adequate treatment pro-\nvided by the general medical sector is comparable across\nmally adequate treatment received from psychiatrists is\ntively).24 Such differences in treatment adequacy are wor-\nthy of attention in future work.\nMany black Americans who do not use services rely\non help from informal support networks and alternative\nhelpers, such as ministers.38,39 We were not able, in this\nfirst article, to address specifically the role of faith-\nbased organizations and particularly the helping role of\nclergy, which our previous work has shown to be im-\nportant.40 We have begun to explore the use of clergy,\nand preliminary results indicate a much higher clergy use\nfor mood and anxiety disorders among African Ameri-\ncans than Caribbean blacks. The more pressing policy\nquestion, however, is whether the seriousness of the emo-\ntional challenges confronting all black Americans is ap-\npropriately matched with the help sources to which these\ngroups turn. Many mental disorders require the atten-\ntion of trained mental health care professionals. Despite\nthe positive aspects of informal help, social support is as\nmuch a barrier to mental health care as an acceptable treat-\nThe mental health need-assessment tradition from\nwhich the NSAL flows relied more on lay conceptualiza-\ntions of distress than on professional judgments of need.\nAlthough good clinical, scientific, and policy reasons ex-\nist for the development of highly structured survey in-\nstruments that can classify respondents by DSM-IV cri-\nteria, this should not be the only approach to assessing\nneed for mental health services; not everyone in need of\nmental health treatment meets the criteria for a disor-\nder,37 and meeting these criteria may not be serious enough\nto warrant treatment.30,44 People decide to seek profes-\nsional help not because they know that they have a par-\nticular disorder but because the level of distress experi-\nenced has exhausted the personal and social resources\nused to cope with the emotional pain.44 The NSAL em-\nbraced each of these epidemiologic traditions, and fu-\nture work will explore both the lay taxonomy that\nmotivates the search for help and how well the concep-\ntualization of distress represented by the DSM-IV pre-\nOur findings demonstrate that underuse of mental\nhealth services for both African Americans and Carib-\nbean blacks remains a serious concern. As a result, edu-\ncational interventions that focus on both black consum-\ners and mental health care professionals are needed.\nPrimary care physicians need to be educated on how best\nto identify black individuals with serious mental health\nproblems and disorders. Mental health care profession-\nals must incorporate knowledge about ethnic differ-\nences in idioms of distress and how to overcome feel-\nings of mistrust into their therapeutic approach. Mental\nhealth educational programs must facilitate, among black\nconsumers, the recognition and definition of symptom\nclusters that need to be treated by mental health care pro-\nfessionals. Clearly, ways must be found to increase the\nuse of mental health care and to increase the quality of\nthat care among all black groups, irrespective of their eth-\nnic heritage. The consequences in terms of needless pain\nand suffering and unnecessary losses in productivity are\ntoo great to ignore.\nSubmitted for Publication: November 3, 2005; final re-\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Health Behavior and\nHealth Education, School of Public Health (Drs Neighbors,\nCaldwell, and Jackson), Department of Sociology\n(DrWilliams),DepartmentofPsychiatry(DrNesse),School\nof Social Work (Dr Taylor), and Program for Research on\nBlack Americans, Research Center for Group Dynamics,\nInstitute of Social Research (Drs Neighbors, Caldwell,\nWilliams, Nesse, Taylor, and Jackson and Mss Bullard and\nTorres), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nCorrespondence: Harold W.
