The burden of\ndementia care often falls on the family members, entailing heavy psychosocial and economic consequences. The aim of this study\nwas to evaluate the caregiver's perspective concerning the support for disease management on behalf of the physicians and the\nlocal Sicilian administrations (Italy), and the burden of care and effects on their lifestyle, to propose new prevention strategies\nand service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden. Fifty-nine caregivers of Italian elderly people with dementia (mean\nage, 73; age range: 63-83) were interviewed, and 55 of them completed an ad hoc self-report questionnaire composed of 54\nmultiple-choice questions. Our findings suggest that caregivers need more information on the disease's management, as well as\non how to deal with the stress due to the disease burden. Moreover, a negative perception about the services offered from the\nlocal administration emerged. Assistive technology (AT) could be useful in promoting interaction between general practitioners\nand specialized centers for diagnosis, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, and in saving costs. Moreover, case manager\ncould follow patients and support family members within the care pathway, besides collecting and sharing information among the\ndifferent health professionals involved. Further studies should be aimed at investigating whether AT and/or the use of specific\neducational strategies could be the right approach for meeting the needs of families living with dementia.\n",

It has been\nestimated that about 47 million people worldwide suffer\nfrom dementia, and this number is expected to reach 75 mil-\nlion by 2030.1 In Italy, dementia affects approximately 1 mil-\nlion elderly people, including 7.23% of the population aged\n65 years or above, and the number of carers is about 3 mil-\nlion.2 Given the continuous growth of incidence of this ill-\nness, especially in elderly often affected by other chronic\ndiseases, dementia represents one of the major plagues for\nthe modern society. As the disease progresses, a host of\nsymptoms can emerge, such as disorientation, mood swings,\nconfusion, more serious memory loss, behavioral changes,\ndifficulties in speaking and swallowing, and problems with\nwalking. Thus, dementia interferes with daily, social and\nprofessional functioning of patients, also affecting the daily\nlife of their families.3\nFrom an epidemiological point of view, in Europe only\n50% of the elderly receive a diagnosis of dementia by a spe-\ncialized center and this often occurs when the patient is\nalready in a moderate stage of the disease.4\nBut, a timely diagnosis can facilitate care and support\npatients and their families to take control of their situation.4,5\nMoreover, interventions focused on modifiable risk factors,\nif provided earlier in life, might be promising preventive\nactions,6,7 reducing between 1.1 and 3 million cases of\nAlzheimer disease (AD).8\n1IRCCS Centro Neurolesi \"Bonino-Pulejo,\" Messina, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nRocco S. Calabr\u00f2, IRCCS Centro Neurolesi \"Bonino-Pulejo,\" S.S.113,\nEmail: roccos.calabro@irccsme.it\nThe worldwide economic costs of dementia were esti-\nlion in 2015,1 a substantial economic impact for a single\ngroup of disorders. Globally, 87% of the direct costs occur in\nhigh-income countries, mainly in strategies, to compensate\nlost function rather than treatment for prevention.3 Indirect\ncosts, due to informal care, include the estimation of the\namount of lost work productivity and the costs to pay a pro-\nfessional caregiver to reduce the time spent on caregiving\ntasks.10 In addition to direct and indirect costs, there are the\nintangible costs of reduced quality of life of both patient and\nfamiliars. Indeed, informal care is the most important form\nof care in many countries, especially when dedicated health\ncare services (home care, nursing homes, and daycare) are\nalmost inexistent.11 In Italy, as across all European countries,\nit is the relatives who predominantly manage AD patients,\nand the main out-of-pocket expenditure borne by the Italian\nrelatives concerns the cost of private care workers\npublic, patient, and informal care costs, was about 20000/y;\nout of this, the cost borne by the public sector was 4534/y,\nmainly for the national cash-for-care allowance (2324/y)\nCare for a familiar affects the working life of the care-\ngiver, who may be compelled to opt for part-time or leave the\njob13; for this reason, the informal caregivers are mainly\nwomen, usually spouses, but also daughters or daughters-in-\nlaw. However, the increasing employment rates for women is\nclashing with their availability in providing informal care for\nfamiliars with dementia.14\nWithin this context, assistive technology (AT) may lead to\npossible cost savings in care delivery. Indeed, ad hoc tech-\nnologies could be used for monitoring people with dementia\n(PWD), facilitating access to health care services, and pro-\nmoting interaction with general practitioners.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of\nsouthern Italy families dealing with dementia about services\nreceived by the local Sicilian administration, general practi-\ntioners, and neurologists of our specialized center. We also\ninvestigated on the psychosocial problems perceived by car-\ners of elderly PWD, to propose new prevention strategies\nand service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population\nAll the eligible caregivers of the patients referred for demen-\ntia to IRCCS Centro Neurolesi \"Bonino-Pulejo\" of Messina\nwere asked to complete a questionnaire during a period of 4\n27 males) completed the questionnaire after having signed a\nwritten informed consent. Four questionnaires were excluded\nbecause missing data did not allow further analysis. Thus,\nthe study population consisted of 55 caregivers aged 21 to 85\ndetail the demographic characteristics of both patients and\ncaregivers. The study was approved by our IRCCS Local\nand anonymity of participants, we used study codes on data\ndocuments (ie, completed questionnaire) instead of record-\ning participants' identifying information, which were con-\nversely kept in a separate document where codes and\nidentifying information were matched/linked. This docu-\nment was locked in a separate location, and the access to it\nwas restricted to the principal investigator of the study.\nData Collection\nCaregiver perspective was assessed by a self-report Italian\nquestionnaire composed of 54 multiple-choice questions (see\nthe appendix), created ad hoc by the authors, that evaluates\nthe personal perception about three main issues: (1) support\nfor disease management from physicians and local adminis-\ntrations, (2) effects of the disease on the caregiver lifestyle,\nand (3) caregiver burden. As the main purpose of this study\nwas to know whether patients and caregivers felt abandoned\nin disease management, especially by the local administra-\ntion and the health system, as well as to observe the caregiv-\ners' lifestyle to conceive potential strategies suitable for the\nsituation, we did not use any standardized scale or test.\nHowever, we included, within the questionnaire, a set of\nquestions aimed at evaluating the caregiver burden. These\nincluded emotions, behaviors, and problems perceived by\nthe caregiver. The questionnaire included another 10 items\naimed to collect demographical information on both the\npatient and caregiver.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by using the 3.2.3 version\nof the open-source software R.15 A P value <.05 was consid-\nered as statistically significant.\nResults for continuous variables were expressed in mean\n\u00b1 standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were\nexpressed in frequencies and percentages. Initially, a bivari-\nate statistical analysis was performed to investigate on care-\ngivers'lifestyle and disease management, aside from support\nprovided by physicians and local administrations. Thus, cor-\nrelations between quantitative variables were computed by\nPearson coefficient, or by point-biserial correlation coeffi-\ncient when one variable was dichotomous. The chi-square\ntest or the Fisher exact test were used for proportion com-\nparison, and the Student t test was used to compare the mean\nage by gender, as well as the frequency of medical examina-\ntion by the general practitioner and the neurologist. Next, we\nalso conducted a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)\non the last 24 questions of the questionnaire concerning care-\ngiver burden and help in disease management. The analysis\nDe Cola et al 3\nof the MCA was carried out with regard to the correlations\nbetween the variables and the factorial axes.\nResults\nSociodemographic Aspects and Health of the\nSample\nAs shown in Table 1, the caregivers were mainly graduated\n(47.27%), as compared with patients, who were poorly\neducated. About 65% of the patients were married and\n25.45% widowed, whereas caregivers were principally\nmarried (69.09%). More than half of caregivers cared for\ntheir parents (54.54%), who were mainly pensioners or\nhousewives. We found that female caregivers were slightly\nsignificant differences by gender emerged. However, we\nfound a significant association between gender and job (P\nunemployed (23.33%), whereas men were mainly pen-\nsioned (40%) or office makers (28%). On the contrary,\n32.73% declared having to interrupt their working activity\n(12.72% definitively) to take care of their own loved-one\nTable 1.

Quantitative variables are in mean \u00b1 standard deviation; qualitative variables are in frequencies (n) and percentage.\nA substantial percentage of caregivers (80%) lived with\nmove in with their loved-one after the diagnosis of dementia,\nwhereas 47.27% already lived with him or her.\nFifty out of 55 patients (90.9%) suffered from at least one\nchronic disease, and in particular, 35 out of 55 patients had at\nleast three chronic diseases (Q29). Hypertension (49.2%),\nthe most common. Moreover, 27.27% of the caregivers were\nmarried to the patients, and 52.78% of them, in turn, suffered\nfrom at least one chronic disease (Q30).\nSupport to the Patients' Management\nPatients went to their general practitioner (Q1) more often than\nof the cases, neurologists provided clear information about the\ndisease, versus 65.45% of the general practitioner (Table 2, Q5\nand Q3, respectively). However, 40% of caregivers declared of\nnot having received suggestions on how to manage the famil-\niar's disease (Table 2, Q6) and 80% of them of not having\nreceived suggestions on how to deal with the burden (Table 2,\nQ8).Around 46% of the patients had only one caregiver (Q14),\napparently because he or she was the most appropriate (40%),\nor because others had no time (28%; Q16).\nOnly 14.55% of caregivers declared of having received an\neconomical or material (eg, health aid) support from local\nadministration, and 21.82% an attendance allowance (Table 2,\ners declared that the disease had affected the family's econom-\nand local administration support inadequate (Table 2, Q12).\nCaregiver Lifestyle and Burden\nConcerning lifestyle, although 50.91% of caregivers were\nmotorized (Table 2, Q27), they spent their free time mainly\nwatching TV and listening to the radio (67.27%; Table 2,\nTable 2, Q22). Around 53% of the caregivers did not attend\nlarly cultivate a hobby (Table 2, Q25). On the other hand, we\nthink the caregivers' free time was inversely correlated with\ntheir difficulty to manage anger (r = -0.25), and with the\ncaregivers' perception that their loved-ones were perceived\nas a \"weight\" (r = -0.31). Similarly, the number of caregiv-\ners was moderately correlated to their guilty for leaving the\nfamiliar alone (r = 0.32). However, only 7.27% of caregivers\ndeclared to use psychiatric drugs (Table 2, Q19).\nMultiple Correspondence Analysis\nThe results of the MCA conducted on the last 24 questions\nsupported our idea about the caregivers' burden and stress\n(Table 3). Indeed, the first factorial axis, which accounts for\n23.61% of total inertia, can be considered as the axis of the\ncaregiver's burden, because it correlated highly with many\nquestions concerning the emotional management of the care-\ngivers. They felt stressed (Q50; r = 0.79), not able to deal\nespecially with himself (Q47; r = 0.78), and sometimes they\nfelt the wish to escape from the situation (Q45; r = 0.79).\nOn the other hand, the second factorial axis (10.42% of\ntotal inertia) could be considered as the axis of need for help\nin disease management. Indeed, this axis correlated highly\nwith the caregivers' desire in receiving additional informa-\ntion about the disease (Q33; r = 0.69), their necessity to have\nadvice on how to assist their loved-one (Q36; r = 0.69), and\ntheir quarrels for care management with other family mem-\nOverall, caregivers wish to have more time for themselves\nDiscussion\nAccording to literature, the care and support provided for\nPWD often cover several areas of their lives.3 Typical\nhealth care delivery structures usually do not pay much\nattention to this support, with an enormous impact on the\nTable 2.

Questions concerned information for disease management\nand caregiver's lifestyle (Q18-Q27) are described in the appendix.\nDe Cola et al 5\nwhole family, ranging from the caring burden to the psy-\nchosocial and economic aspects.\nFamiliars are physically, emotionally, and financially\ninvolved by the disease, and the burden has a significant\nimpact on their physical and mental health, personal and\nsocial life, and overall well-being.16 In our sample, around\n60% of the caregivers declared the necessity of having\nmore information on the disease's management (Table 2,\nQ7), and 61.82% on how to deal with the disease caring-\nrelated stress (Table 2, Q9). According to previous works,\ncaregivers sustain an ever-increasing burden of care in the\nmanagement of patients associated with progression of\ndementia. They spend many hours in supporting the patient\nin direct care activities (personal hygiene, preparation and\nserving of meals, dispensing of drugs and medications,\ncare and support) and surveillance, which imply a gradual\nreorganization of their lives. Indeed, spaces and roles\nrequired assisting the patient expose the entire family to\nstress and pressures that threaten to destabilize, even dra-\nmatically, their \"equilibrium.\"17 Thus, conflicts secondary\nto fatigue and economic or psychological problems may\nfrequently emerge. The variability of the patient's behavior\nincreases caregiver's disorientation and sense of fragility\nand helplessness. Furthermore, an increasing risk of coro-\nnary heart disease and mortality for caregivers have been\nIn this study, we found that caregivers experienced a\nstress condition related to dementia. MCA results showed\nthat caregivers were not capable of emotional manage-\nment, with regard to anxiety, anger, and frustration; fur-\nthermore, bivariate analysis highlighted relationship\nproblems and social isolation. In particular, difficulty in\nanger management was associated with a decrease in the\ntime spent on their own needs (r = -0.25). Moreover,\n47.27% of caregivers declared a sense of guilt. Notably,\nthe most important aspect that we want to underline is the\ncaregivers' perception of the inadequate service offered\nfrom the local government: Only 14.55% of families\nreceived an economical or material (eg, health aid) sup-\nport, whereas 78.18% of the caregivers declared that the\ndisease management affected the family budget. These\nparticipants declared they needed more support from local\nand national governments to manage all the aspects\ninvolved in dementia. However, the notable contribution\nprovided by familiars is a benefit for the health care sys-\ntem, in terms of cost-effectiveness advantages.20\nIn this scenario, strategies to bridge the gap between\npatient demands and their families and the public health\ncare system are crucial for the quality of care.21 Thus,\npolitical strategies should be integrated with voluntary and\nprivate organizations to create an environment able to meet\npatients' needs, in terms not only of care (eg, eating, dress-\ning, and hygiene) but also supporting psychosocial and\nexistential needs. Similarly, programs for case manage-\nment, counseling, daycare, and education by different care\nproviders, as well as interventions for helping familiars to\nmanage the personal burden of caring, need to be devel-\noped. Indeed, many studies showed that support for family\nmembers and other caregivers can represent a valuable\ncost-effective use of resources,22,23 reducing or postponing\nnursing-home admissions,24,25 and improving psychologi-\ncal caregivers' conditions.26,27 Moreover, by providing bet-\nter training for dementia care, healthcare services will\nimprove the global quality of care, also reducing the grow-\ning necessity of future costs.\nAT can improve the quality of life and cut down on\nhealth care costs. Alarms, GPSs, watches, smartphones,\nand so forth could be used for monitoring PWD, facilitat-\ning access to health care services, and promoting interac-\ntion with general practitioners. After all, PWD have\ndemonstrated a positive response to AT use, but if and\nwhen this can facilitate autonomy and independence\nnobody knows.28,29 Moreover, it has been shown that tele-\nmedicine can be considered as an important tool for\nimproving health, cognitive function, and quality of life in\nthe elderly living in nursing homes.30,31 AT for carers\ncould also be useful in \"caregivers' empowerments,\"32 as\nTable 3.

The 24 questions concerned help in disease management\ncaregivers (Q52-Q54) are described in the appendix. Correlations higher\nthan 0.5 are in bold.\nwell as in reducing their burden.33,34 Telehealth systems\ncould play a pivotal role for both the families living with\ndementia and health care administrations in a cost-effec-\ntive approach, avoiding the unnecessary hospital admis-\nsions,35 which have been estimated to be about 40% higher\nin PWD and/or cognitive impairment than in the elderly\nwithout deficit.36 Thus, general practitioners could use AT\nto promote interventions targeting multiple modifiable\nfactors and to bridge the gap between families and spe-\ncialist centers to provide a timely diagnosis of dementia.\nIn fact, general practitioners often perceive a failure in\ntraditional care, declaring the need for routine provision\nof medication dose decision aids.37 Similarly, case man-\nagement may offer potential benefit to patients, their care-\ngivers, and community-based professionals through\ncontinuity of care with a trusted and qualified individual,\nwho can address the needs of the families living with\ndementia.38 Although it is not possible to rate whether\ncase management could delay institutionalization in care\nhomes or can be successfully incorporated into routine\ngeneral practice,39,40 it could have a place within initia-\ntives for health and social services integration. Indeed, the\ncase manager could follow the patients within a specialist\nlocal care network, supporting the familiars in the disease\nmanagement, and collecting and sharing information\namong the different health professionals.\nThe dependence on the participants' subjective assess-\nments/self-report, and the absence of objective measures\nincorporated to support the participants' subjective\nresponses may be considered the main limitations of this\nwork. Nonetheless, no standardized scales or tests exist to\nestimate how patients and caregivers perceive the local\nadministration and the health system services in dementia\nsupport care.\nConclusions\nTerritorial health care systems do not pay much attention\nto the care of PWD. Consequently, the burden of dementia\noften is supported by the family members. To meet the\nneeds of PWD and their carers is a challenge that has to be\naddressed as an important part of clinical decision mak-\ning. Thus, there is a growing need to have local and\nnational policy strategies in a multidisciplinary care pro-\ngram management, with the organization of a network\nlinking specialist centers for diagnosis and pharmacologi-\ncal and psychosocial treatments, general practitioners,\nsheltered housing facilities, integrated home care, and\nnursing homes. Implementation of a guideline and new\nnational and local policy strategies for dementia care are\ntherefore necessary to fulfill such a necessity. Thus, fur-\nther studies should be fostered to investigate whether AT\nand/or the use of specific educational interventions could\nbe the right approach to better meet the needs of families\nliving with dementia.\nAppendix\nDescription of the Self-Report Italian Questionnaire Composed\nof 54 Multiple-Choice Questions.\nQuestions Description\nQ1 Patient annual number of visits by the practitioner\nQ2 Action of the practitioner concerning the disease\nQ3 Considerations about the information provided by the\npractitioner\nQ4 Patient annual number of visits by the neurologist\nQ5 Considerations about the information provided by the neurologist\nQ6 Physicians advices for disease management\nQ7 Need of more information for disease management\nQ8 Physicians' advices for deal with the stress\nQ9 Need of more information for deal with the stress\nQ10 Attendance allowance from local administration\nQ11 Economical or material (eg, health aid) help from local\nadministration\nQ12 Need for more support from local administration\nQ13 Working interruption to care the person with dementia\nQ14 Number of caregivers\nQ15 Other caregivers\nQ16 Caregiver motivations\nQ17 Caregiver's relation with the person with dementia\nQ18 Caregiver's cohabitation with the person with dementia\nQ19 Use of psychiatric drugs\nQ20 Free time: meet friends\nQ21 Free time: attend meeting places\nQ22 Free time: read books and newspapers\nQ23 Free time: listen to the radio\nQ24 Free time: walk and bike\nQ25 Free time: cultivation of hobbies\nQ26 Free time: go to the cinema or theater\nQ28 Effect of the disease on the family's economical balance\nQ29 Chronic disease comorbidity of the patient\nQ30 Chronic disease comorbidity of the caregiver\nQ31 Need of more help by familiars and friends\nQ32 Help in daily activities\nQ33 Need of more information about the disease\nQ34 Need of help to manage fatigue\nQ35 Need of more time for himself\nQ36 Need of more advices for caring the person with dementia\nQ37 Quarrels for care management with other family members\nQ38 Cooperation in care management with other family members\nQ39 Worsening in work performance\nQ40 Shame for the patient's behavior\nQ41 Resentment feeling for the person with dementia\nQ42 Uncomfortable feeling in presence of other people\nQ43 Emotionally emptiness feeling\nQ44 Resentment feeling for the other family members\nQ45 Desire to escape from the situation\nQ46 Irritation for the patient's request\nQ48 Guilty feeling for leaving alone the patient\nQ49 Being able to deal with all the problems\nQ51 Difficulty to restrain anger\nQ52 Perception that the patient feels a \"weight\"\nQ53 Being able to speak about the disease\nQ54 Helplessness feeling about the disease\nNote.
