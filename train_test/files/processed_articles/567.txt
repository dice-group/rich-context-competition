This model hypoth-\nesizes that late-life stressors contribute to poorer men-\ntal health not only directly but also indirectly by\nrestricting routine everyday functioning. Method:\nWe used data from a national probability-based\napproximately 50% female). Vision was assessed\nboth subjectively (via self-report) and objectively (via\na visual acuity test). Respondents also reported on\ntheir levels of physical and driving limitations, feel-\nings of social isolation, and symptoms of depres-\nsion. Results: Path analyses indicated a strong\nfit of the data to the activity restriction model for sub-\njective vision. In addition to directly contributing to\nhigher depressive symptomatology, subjective vision\ncontributed to depressive symptoms indirectly by\npredicting more physical limitations and feelings\nof social isolation that, in turn, contributed to\nmore symptoms of depression; driving limitations\ndid not mediate the relationship between subjec-\ntive vision and depressive symptomatology. Objec-\ntive vision contributed significantly to physical and\ndriving limitations but was unrelated to feelings of\nsocial isolation and depressive symptomatology.\nImplications: Supporting the activity restriction\nmodel, poorer self-rated vision in late life contributes\nto lower mental health directly and also indirectly by\nrestricting individuals' ability to carry out routine\nday-to-day physical activities and increasing their\nfeelings of social isolation. Interventions for older\nadults with vision-related problems could focus on\nmaintaining or enhancing their physical and social\nfunctioning in order to promote their adaptation to\npoor vision.\nKey Words: Vision-related conditions, Functioning,\nDepressive symptoms\nGood visual capacity is among the most impor-\ntant contributors to the value older individuals\nattach to their lives (Jopp, Roth, & Oswald, 2008).\nWith advancing age, however, vision-related prob-\nlems are a common stressor. Recent estimates\nobtained from the National Health Interview Sur-\nvey indicate that 17% of individuals 65+ years of\nage reported having trouble with their vision even\nwith corrective glasses and lenses (Federal Inter-\nagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008).\nMuch evidence indicates that poor visual function\ncan have adverse effects on the lives and well-being\nof older adults (e.g., Crews, 1994; Federal Inter-\nagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008;\nWahl, Schilling, Oswald, and Heyl (1999) found\nthat poorer visual ability was related to lower sub-\njective well-being in a sample of older adults\nrecruited through physician practices. Bourque,\nLeger, Pushkar, and Beland (2007) reported that\npoor vision was related to lower life satisfaction in\na representative sample of older Canadians, and\nPoor Vision, Functioning, and Depressive\nSymptoms: A Test of the Activity Restriction\nModel\nJamila Bookwala, PhD,* and Brendan Lawson, BS\nDepartment of Psychology, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania.\n*Address correspondence to Jamila Bookwala, Department of Psychology, Lafayette College, 305 Oechsle Hall, Easton, PA 18104.\nE-mail: bookwalj@lafayette.edu\nDecision Editor: William J. McAuley, PhD\nReinhardt (1996) found a similar relationship in a\nconvenience sample of visually impaired older\nadults residing in the United States.\nAn especially well-established finding is that\npoor vision is linked to lower psychological health\nor emotional well-being, most notably to higher\ndepressive symptomatology. Research indicates\nthat not only are symptoms of depression elevated\nin older adults diagnosed with diseases of the\neye such as age-related macular degeneration\n(e.g., Casten & Rovner, 2008; Tolman, Hill,\nKleinschmidt, & Gregg, 2005) but also that\npoorer visual capacity in general is reliably linked\nto more depressed affect in late life. For example,\nLupsakko, Mantyjarvi, Kautiainen, and Sulkava\n(2002) found that higher levels of depressive symp-\ntomatology occurred in a population-based sam-\nple of visually impaired older adults relative to\ntheir nonimpaired peers, and Crews, Jones, and\nKim (2006) reported that mild or moderate levels\nof depressive symptoms are a common comorbid\ncondition among elders who are visually impaired.\nNumerous other studies with convenience and\nprobability-based samples also have found that\nolder adults who rated their vision to be poorer\nhad higher levels of depressive symptomatology\n(e.g., Brody et al., 2001; Casten, Rovner, &\nJohansson, 2001; Furner, Wallace, Arguelles,\nThe current study builds on this body of litera-\nture by testing three mediators in the link between\npoor vision and depressive symptomatology. It\nuses the activity restriction model of depressed\naffect (Williamson & Christie, 2009; Williamson\n& Shaffer, 2000) as the theoretical framework,\nwhich explains that an important factor in indi-\nviduals' psychological adjustment when faced with\nlife stressors is the extent to which the stressor\nrestricts their normal day-to-day activities. Accord-\ning to this model, disruptions in carrying out nor-\nmal personal and social activities (e.g., shopping,\nvisiting friends) at least partially account for the\nlink between health-related stressors and emotional\nwell-being. The model thus proposes mediational\npathways, whereby life stressors such as chronic\nphysical health problems often contribute not only\ndirectly to poorer mental health outcomes but also\ncontribute indirectly via their adverse effects on\nindividuals' ability to carry out day-to-day routine\nactivities. Such activity restriction, in its turn, con-\ntributes to poorer mental health and emotional\nwell-being. The activity restriction model has\ngarnered considerable support in studies on late-\nlife stressors such as chronic pain, family caregiv-\ning, and living with breast cancer, demonstrating\nthat the link from such stressors to depressive\nsymptomatology is mediated partially or wholly\nby declines in physical functioning and/or social\nengagement (Bookwala, Harralson, & Parmelee,\nWilliamson & Shaffer, 2000). However, the activ-\nity restriction model of depressed affect has\nreceived little attention in the domain of vision\nimpairment. In this study, we propose that the\nmodel offers a theoretically viable explanation for\nthe impact of vision impairment on depressed\naffect in late life. Based on the activity restriction\nmodel, we hypothesize that poor vision contrib-\nutes to depressed affect not only directly but it also\nresults in more limitations in the performance of\npersonal and social activities that, in turn, contrib-\nute to higher depressed mood.\nPoor vision among older adults has consistently\nbeen found to have adverse effects on a wide vari-\nety of day-to-day functional domains. Numerous\nstudies have found that poor vision diminishes\nolder adults' ability to carry out everyday physical\nactivities (e.g., Branch, Horowitz, & Carr, 1989;\nHorowitz, 1994; Laforge, Spector, & Sternberg,\n1992; Travis, Boerner, Reinhardt, & Horowitz,\nNordholm found that reading, writing, and watch-\ning television were common functional problems\nassociated with poor vision. In addition, mobility-\nrelated problems, such as difficulty with moving\nabout outdoors, driving or using public transporta-\ntion, and conducting bank-related business, were\ncommonly reported by their visually impaired\nelderly sample. Travis and colleagues found that\nolder adults with impaired vision reported higher\nlevels of difficulty with instrumental activities of\ndaily living (e.g., selecting/locating and identifying\nclothing, food items, and money; using a telephone;\nwriting checks; and taking medications) and that\nthese individuals identified these visual problems\nrather than other health problems as the source of\nthese difficulties. Crews and colleagues also found\nthat older adults who reported visual impairment\nwere more likely to report difficulty performing\neveryday tasks, such as walking, climbing steps,\nand shopping relative to their age-matched peers.\nA functional domain in late life that is particu-\nlarly adversely affected by poor vision is driving\n \nability (e.g., Horowitz, Boerner, & Reinhardt,\nCohn, & Ragland, 2004). Indeed, studies have\nreported that older adults often cite problems with\ntheir eyesight as the reason they limited their driv-\ning or avoided driving altogether (Persson, 1993;\nRagland, Satariano, & MacLeod, 2004). An\nemerging literature also indicates that in addition\nto contributing to limitations in physical function\nand driving ability, poor vision can have an adverse\nimpact on social functioning domains, such as\nsocial network size, relationship maintenance, and\nsocial integration (O'Donnell, 2005; Reinhardt,\nBoerner, & Benn, 2003; Wahl & Tesch-Romer,\n2001). Accordingly, studies have found that poor\nvision is correlated with lower levels of social inte-\ngration (Femia et al., 2001), more difficulty engag-\ning in social relationships (Crews et al., 2006), and\nhigher levels of social isolation (Femia et al., 2001).\nDespite widespread evidence from individual stud-\nies linking poor vision in older adults to either\ntheir functioning (physical, driving-related, or\nsocial) or depressive symptoms, there has been\nlittle attempt to examine the interrelationships\namong these variables simultaneously. We address\nthis gap in the literature by testing these relation-\nships in a single model using the activity restriction\nmodel of depressed affect as our guiding frame-\nwork, which posits that the contribution of stressors\nsuch as poor vision to depressive symptomatology\nis explained at least partially by the impact of poor\nvision on multiple domains of functioning.\nIn the present study, we tested the role of three\nmediators--physical limitations, driving limita-\ntions, and feelings of social isolation--in the link\nfrom vision impairment to depressive symptom-\natology using both subjective (self-report) and\nobjective (visual acuity test) indicators of vision\nimpairment. Difficulties with performing day-to-day\nactivities have been used as indicators of activity\nrestriction by Williamson (2000b), and feelings of\nsocial isolation have received attention in other\nvision research (Femia et al., 2001). Subjective and\nobjective measures of vision are included in the\nstudy because they provide complementary infor-\nmation on visual ability among older adults\n(Horowitz, 2004) and including both can offer a\nmore comprehensive understanding of the effects\nof vision on psychological health. We drew data\nfor this study from the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project (NSHAP; O'Muircheartaigh,\nsurvey-based study of a nationally representative\nsample of older adults residing in the United States.\nConsistent with the activity restriction model of\nWilliamson (2000) and Williamson and Shaffer\n(2000), we tested (a) the direct link from subjective\nand objective vision to depressive symptoms and\n(b) the extent to which this association is mediated\nby functional impairment and social isolation\nknown to result from poor vision. We hypothe-\nsized that poor vision--assessed both subjectively\nand objectively--will be associated with greater\ndepressive symptomatology and that more physi-\ncal and driving limitations and more feelings of\nsocial isolation will at least partially account for\nthis association. We predicted that these relation-\nships would exist after controlling for sociodemo-\ngraphic variables that are known to be related to\nfunctioning and depressive symptomatology in\nolder samples such as ours, including age, gender,\neducation level, race, and marital status.\nMethods\nSample\nOur sample consisted of older adults who par-\nticipated in the NSHAP (O'Muircheartaigh et al.,\nscale survey study that assessed components of\nhealth, social relationships, and well-being in older\nadults aged 57\u00ad85 years using face-to-face inter-\nviews and self-administered questionnaires. The\nwhich eligible cases were identified as part of a\nlarger national area probability sample of house-\nholds (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009). The NSHAP\nsample was balanced on age and gender subgroups\nand oversampled African Americans and Latinos.\nApproximately 50% of the original NSHAP sam-\nple (N = 3,005) was randomly selected to receive\nthe objective vision assessment (N = 1,506). To be\neligible for the present analyses, respondents who\nwere sampled to receive the objective assessment\nhad to have no missing data on the study variables.\nThis yielded a final sample of 1,170 older adults\n(77.7% of NSHAP respondents who were ran-\ndomly selected for the objective vision assessment).\nOn average, respondents were approximately 69.2\nwas female (N = 593). The majority of the sample\nhad at least a high-school diploma or equivalent\ndescribed their ethnic background as White\n6.7% (N = 78) as other. Almost two thirds of the\nsample were married or living with a partner\nrated or divorced, almost one fifth was widowed\nmarried.\nMeasures\nVision.--Self-reported vision (subjective vision)\nwas assessed in the NSHAP using a single-item\nmeasure with a 5-point rating scale (Schumm\net al., 2009). Respondents were asked to rate their\neyesight using the item \"With your glasses or con-\ntact lenses if you wear them, is your eyesight poor,\nfair, good, very good, or excellent?\" Responses\nwere recoded such that higher scores represented\npoorer self-reported vision. The mean rating for\nless than half the sample subjectively rated their\ning respondents rated their vision to be very good\nVisual acuity (objective vision) was assessed in\nboth eyes together at a distance of 3 m using a\nchart with Sloan optotypes manufactured by Preci-\nsion Vision (catalog number 2104; Schumm et al.,\n2009). NSHAP interviewers were trained to follow\na detailed protocol to ensure consistent distance\nfrom the chart (via use of a premeasured string laid\nout on the floor), line of sight (the interviewer\nseated the respondent and held the chart at the\nrespondent's eye level), and lighting (sufficient\nlight for reading with low glare or strong back-\nlighting). Respondents who normally wore glasses\nor contact lenses for driving or distance vision\nwere instructed to wear them during the test and\nasked to begin reading the smallest discernible line.\nSuccess or not on this task resulted in the respon-\ndent being instructed to read the successive line\ndirectly below or above the just-read line, respec-\ntively, until the smallest discernible line that could\nbe successfully read was determined. Performance\non the visual acuity test was coded using standard\nvision or better were coded as \"normal or better\"\n\"good\" vision, between approximately 20/60 and\n20/40 were coded as \"moderately decreased\"\nvision, and those with worse scores were coded as\n\"poor\" vision. Respondents who were unable to\nread the largest line on the Sloan chart at 3 m rep-\nmean score on the visual acuity test was 1.14\n(SD = 0.76). Based on their performance on this\nFunctional limitations were assessed in terms of\ndifficulty with day-to-day physical function and\ndifficulty with driving. Seven items assessing the\namount of difficulty that respondents experienced\nrelated to walking (e.g., walking a street block,\nwalking across a room) and self-care activities\n(e.g., dressing, eating, using the toilet, bathing or\nshowering, getting in and out of bed) were summed\nto yield a measure of physical limitations. Driving\nlimitations were measured via the sum of responses\nto two items, difficulty experienced driving during\nthe day and driving at night. Responses to items\nassessing physical and driving limitations were\nmade on a 4-point scale (1 = no difficulty, 2 = some\ndifficulty, 3 = much difficulty, and 4 = unable to\ndo). Activities that had never been performed were\nscored as \"no difficulty \"; for the driving items,\nrespondents could indicate that they no longer\ndrove, which was coded as \"unable to do.\" For\nboth measures, responses were scored such\nthat higher scores represented greater difficulty.\nThe physical limitations measure obtained a\nCronbach's alpha of .82, and the driving limita-\ntions measure obtained a Cronbach's alpha of\n.83. Mean scores on physical limitations and\nFeelings of social isolation were assessed using\nthree items (how often do you feel isolated from\nothers, feel that you lack companionship, and feel\nleft out?) adapted from the UCLA Loneliness Scale\n(Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Similar items\nwere used by Femia and colleagues (2001) in their\nstudy of outcomes associated with vision impair-\nment to measure feelings of social isolation in older\nadults. Responses to these items were made using\na 3-point scale ranging from hardly ever or never\nto often, and scores were summed such that higher\nscores represented more feelings of social isolation\n(Cronbach's a = .80). The sample mean for social\nDepressive symptomatology was measured using\nan 11-item version of the Center for Epidemiologi-\ncal Studies-Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977)\n \nthat assesses the severity of depressive symptoms\nover a 1-week recall period. Items (e.g., \"I could\nnot `get going'\" and \"I felt that everything I did\nwas an effort\") were answered on a 4-point scale\nranging from rarely/none of the time to most of the\ntime. (It should be noted that the response scale in\nthe NSHAP, which ranged from 1 to 4, was\nrecoded for this study to match the original CES-D\nscale, which ranges from 0 to 3.) Higher scores\nreflected greater depressive symptomatology, and\nthe scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's\na = .79). Mean depressive symptomatology was\nControl Variables.--Sociodemographic variables\nincluded age, gender, education level, race, and\nmarital status; these variables were measured in the\nNSHAP using standard self-report items. In the\nmodel testing, race was coded as a dichotomous\nvariable (White vs. non-White) as was marital sta-\ntus (married vs. not); gender was coded as 1 = male\nand 2 = female.\nData Analyses\nDescriptive statistics and zero-order correlations\nbetween study variables were computed first.\nModel testing was conducted via path analytic\nprocedures using the EQS statistical software pro-\ngram (Bentler & Wu, 1995) and maximum likeli-\nhood estimation of path coefficients. All variables\nin the model were treated as observed variables in\nthe analysis. Direct paths were specified from sub-\njective and objective vision to the three mediator\nvariables (physical limitations, driving limitations,\nand feelings of social isolation) and depressive\nsymptomatology; indirect paths from subjective\nand objective vision to depressive symptomatology\nvia the mediator variables also were estimated.\nSociodemographic variables (age, education level,\ngender, marital status, and race) were included as\ncontrol variables in the model testing as follows:\n(a) when significant bivariate correlations (p < .01)\nbetween the control and study variables were\nobtained, these relationships were included as\npaths in the model and (b) covariances were esti-\nmated between control variables that were signifi-\ncantly correlated with each other (p < .01). The\nWald test (which identifies parameters that can be\ndropped without significantly compromising\nmodel fit) and the Lagrange test (which identifies\nparameters that, if added, could significantly improve\nmodel fit) were used to identify improvements for\nthe overall fit of the model and to generate a more\nparsimonious model.\nTo determine the fit of the model to the data, we\ncomputed multiple goodness-of-fit indices, includ-\ning the c2 goodness-of-fit index, the comparative\nfit index (CFI), the incremental fit index (IFI),\nnormed and non-normed fit indices (NFI and\nNNFI), the standardized mean-square residual\n(SRMR), and the root mean-square error of\napproximation (RMSEA). Multiple fit indices are\nrecommended because the c2 goodness-of-fit sta-\ntistic is sensitive to sample size, and thus, in tests\nwith even reasonably sized samples, relying solely\non the c2 goodness-of-fit index can result in the\nrejection of a theoretically meaningful model\n(Bentler, 1990). Acceptable cutoffs for these fit\nindices include a nonsignificant c2 goodness of fit\n(p > .05); values of .95 or larger for CFI, IFI, NFI,\nand NNFI; and SRMR and RMSEA values of .06\nResults\nZero-order correlations between study variables\nare listed in Table 1. A small but statistically sig-\nnificant correlation was obtained between self-\nreported vision and scores on the visual acuity test\n(r = .29, p < .001). Consistent with expectations,\nin general, poorer self-reported and objectively\nassessed vision was related to more physical and\ndriving limitations, feelings of social isolation, and\nsymptoms of depression. As Table 1 indicates, the\nbivariate relationships between subjective vision\nand these variables were somewhat stronger than\nseen with objective vision.\nNext, we conducted a path analysis using the\nEQS software to test the activity restriction model\nof depressed affect in the context of poor vision in\nwhich we hypothesized that the path from poor\nvision to depressive symptomatology would be at\nleast partially mediated by more physical limita-\ntions, driving limitations, and social isolation. In\nother words, we anticipated that poorer vision\nwould predict more difficulties with physical func-\ntion and driving and more feelings of social isola-\ntion that, in turn, would contribute to more\nsymptoms of depression. To this end, the model\nestimated (a1) paths from the exogenous variables\nof subjective and objective vision to the four\nendogenous variables of physical limitations, driv-\ning limitations, feelings of social isolation, and\ndepressive symptoms and (b) paths from physical\nlimitations, driving limitations, and feelings of\nsocial isolation to depressive symptoms (see Figure 1).\nIn addition, because of the significant bivariate\ncorrelation between the exogenous variables of\nsubjective and objective vision, they were allowed\nto covary; the error variances for physical limita-\ntions, driving limitations, and feelings of social iso-\nlation also were permitted to covary. Paths also\nwere estimated as needed from the sociodemo-\ngraphic variables to each endogenous variable\n(physical limitations, driving limitations, social\nisolation, and depressive symptomatology) based\non significant bivariate correlations that were\nobtained (p < .01, see Table 1). These paths were\nas follows: from age to physical limitations and\ndriving limitations; gender, marital status, and\nrace to physical limitations, driving limitations,\nsocial isolation, and depressive symptoms; and\neducation level to physical limitations, driving lim-\nitations, and depressive symptoms. Covariances\nbetween significantly correlated (p < .01) control\nvariables and subjective and objective vision, pairs\nof control variables that were significantly corre-\nlated, and the error terms for physical limitations,\ndriving limitations, and feelings of social isolation\nalso were estimated in the initial test of the model.\nMost of the goodness-of-fit estimates yielded by\nthe initial test of the model indicated a strong fit of\nexamined to determine if the model could be further\nimproved by dropping paths specified in the initial\ntest of the conceptual model. Eight paths could be\ndropped without compromising model fit, five of\nwhich involved paths from a control variable to an\nendogenous variable (from marital status to physi-\ncal limitations, driving limitations, and depressive\nsymptoms; from race to physical limitations; and\nfrom gender to depressive symptoms). Because esti-\nmates of these paths were not directly relevant to\nthe theoretical model, these five parameters were\ndropped in the next iteration of model testing. The\nremaining three paths were retained in the retest of\nthe model (from objective vision to feelings of social\nisolation and depressive symptoms and from driv-\ning limitations to depressive symptoms) because of\ntheir centrality to the theoretical model. The retest\nof this more parsimonious model incorporating\nthe earlier respecifications yielded even stronger\ntest (which identifies parameters that could be\nadded to the model to improve model fit) in this\nmodel run indicated that the fit of the model could\nbe significantly improved by estimating a path from\nage to social isolation. Thus, this path was added\nand the model retested. All fit indices yielded at\nthis point by the model testing (NFI = .991,\nacceptable cutoff levels (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The\n\n 2 test, which tests the improvement in model fit\noffered by the final model over the original model,\nindicated that the more parsimonious final model\nprovided a significantly better fit to the data\nover the original model ( \nOverall, the final model explained 8.2% of the\nvariance in physical limitations, 16.5% in driving\nlimitations, 9.0% in social isolation, and 37.8% in\nTable 1.

According to Williamson's\nmodel, a chronic health-related stressor can con-\ntribute to higher depressive symptomatology both\ndirectly as well as indirectly through a cascading\nmechanism whereby the stressor also contributes\nto poorer overall functioning which, in turn, con-\ntributes to more depressive symptoms. Such a cas-\ncading mechanism is consistent with research\nlinking other chronic conditions to disability and,\nin turn, disability to poor psychological adapta-\ntion (see Kahana, Kahana, Namazi, Kercher, &\nStange, 1997). Our findings show that the activity\nrestriction model of depressed affect provided an\nexcellent fit to the data within the context of poor\nvisual function in late life. Specifically, direct\neffects of poor self-reported vision on depressive\nsymptomatology and its indirect effects on depres-\nsive symptomatology via physical limitations and\nfeelings of social isolation were seen. The data\nindicated that poorer self-reported vision directly\npredicted higher depressive symptomatology. In\naddition, poorer self-reported vision predicted\nboth greater physical limitations and more social\nisolation, and these, in turn, predicted more depres-\nsive symptoms. The indirect (or mediated) effect of\npoor self-reported vision on depressive symptom-\natology via each of these two mediators was statis-\ntically significant. These findings are noteworthy\nmore so because the tested model controlled for\nobjective vision as assessed by performance on a\ntest of visual acuity. The data did not indicate,\nhowever, that limitations in driving during the day\nor night mediate the link between poor self-\nreported vision and symptoms of depression.\nAlthough both subjective and objective vision pre-\ndicted more driving limitations, the latter did not\ncontribute significantly to depressive symptom-\natology in the overall model. It is plausible that,\nafter controlling for the effects of poor vision,\nrestricting their driving activity may serve to con-\ntrol fears and anxiety about driving that older\nadults can experience (Taylor, Alpass, Stephens, &\nTowers, 2011) especially when their vision is not\nand that this offsets any adverse role of restricted\ndriving activity in depressed affect.\nThat restriction in physical and social function\nserve as intervening variables that partially\naccount for the contribution of poor vision to\ndepressive symptomatology underscores the adverse\nimpact such restriction can have on psychological\nadjustment under stress. Williamson and Dooley\n(2001) offer that the restriction of activities--be\nthey physical or social in nature--may function as\nan effective coping behavior that individuals use\nwhen faced with a stressor. For example, in the case\nof poor vision, such activity restriction can prevent\nfalls or accidents. Paradoxically, however, the very\nrestriction of such routine activities intended to\nassist with coping with the stressor can result in\npoorer psychological adjustment. Thus, when a\nhealth-related stressor results in activity restriction,\nthe adverse effects of the stressor may become even\nfurther exacerbated. Our findings in support of the\nactivity restriction model for vision are generally\nconsistent with research on the applicability of\nthis model to understanding the effects of other\nhealth-related stressors, such as chronic pain,\nfamily caregiving, and cancer (Bookwala & Schulz,\nWilliamson & Dooley, 2001; Williamson & Schulz,\nAlthough the complete model obtained an excel-\nlent fit to the data, it is important to note that the\nactivity restriction model (Williamson & Christie,\nsupport in the case of objectively assessed vision.\nWhen all model components were considered simul-\ntaneously, performance on the visual acuity test did\nnot significantly predict depressive symptoms directly\nor indirectly via the mediators. The differential appli-\ncability of the activity restriction model of depressed\naffect (Williamson & Christie, 2009; Williamson &\nShaffer, 2000) for subjectively versus objectively\nassessed vision may be partially explained by the\nsmall (albeit significant) correlation between self-\nreported vision and the visual acuity test, suggesting\nlow concordance between subjective and objective\nassessments of vision. Low concordance between\nsubjective and objective vision has been reported in\nearlier research (Fors, Thorslund, & Parker, 2006)\nand may signify that self-reported vision is a broader\nmore global construct that is likely also to be based\non comparisons with past visual ability and/or more\nvision-related dimensions rather than on distance\nvision alone (e.g., ease of reading printed material).\nSupporting evidence comes from studies that have\nfound that difficulty with reading and taking medica-\ntion pills are frequently experienced by older adults\nwho have poor vision (Raasch & Rubin, 1993;\nSubjective and objective measures of vision also\nare viewed as offering complementary information\n \non visual ability among older adults, and each may\nserve to counter the limitations of the other\n(Horowitz, 2004). Horowitz points out that a per-\nformance-based measure of visual acuity does not\nassess impairments that may be experienced due to\nvisual field, contrast sensitivity, and depth percep-\ntion problems and thus can offer an objective but\nmore exclusive estimate of visual problems. In con-\ntrast, she notes that a self-reported measure of visual\nability is likely to capture more global evaluations\nof vision, including trouble seeing, difficulty reading\nnewspaper print, and difficulty seeing a familiar\nperson across a room's length that provide insight\ninto the day-to-day implications of poor vision. As\nsuch, self-reported data on visual function are likely\nto offer a subjective but more inclusive estimate of\nvisual problems. Research on other self-reported\naspects of health as measured via global indicators\nalso supports this idea. For example, self-rated\nhealth is routinely measured using a single global\nitem. Krause and Jay (1994) found that this stan-\ndard self-rated health item taps different dimensions\nranging from general health to specific health behav-\niors. Future research may gain from assessing mul-\ntiple aspects of visual function objectively (e.g.,\nimpairment in depth perception, extreme contrast\nor brightness sensitivity in addition to visual acuity\nas assessed in NSHAP) and subjectively (e.g., self-\nreported trouble with reading newspaper print and\nrecognizing people at a small distance in addition to\nthe global assessment of one's vision as assessed in\nNSHAP) to more clearly evaluate the direct and\nindirect link between vision and its effects on depres-\nsive symptomatology.\nOur study offers important and new insights to\ninform current understanding about the psycho-\nlogical impact of poor vision. It indicates that the\nlink between vision and psychological adjustment\nin late life is complex rather than simple and mer-\nits further investigation. It identifies that the activ-\nity restriction model of depressed affect may offer\na viable explanation for the effects of poor vision--\nespecially self-reported vision--on adaptation to\nthis stressor. Based on our findings, we recommend\nthat clinicians and other health care practitioners\nwho work with older adults with compromised\nvisual ability evaluate its impact on their clients'\nphysical limitations and feelings of social isolation\nin addition to the impact on mental health. Multi-\nfocused clinical and community-based interven-\ntions that can maintain or enhance physical and\nsocial functioning levels are also likely to be more\neffective in promoting adaptation to poor vision\nand better mental health. For example, interven-\ntions that focus on making transportation services\navailable and providing home visits from individ-\nuals in the community to assist with daily chores\nor engage with the visually impaired socially may\nbe especially effective for better psychological\nadjustment.\nUsing a nationally representative sample of\ncommunity-dwelling older adults increases the sig-\nnificance of our findings because of their enhanced\ngeneralizability to the larger population of elders\nin the United States. Moreover, the use of objective\nand subjective assessments of vision in examining\nthe psychological impact of poor vision is an\nimportant strength of the study. Despite these\nstrengths, it should be noted that the data are\ncross-sectional in nature and, as such, preclude\ncausal interpretations of relationships. For exam-\nple, it is plausible that symptoms of depression\ncontribute to poorer self-rated vision rather than\nvice versa or, alternatively, that there is a bidirec-\ntional or even cyclical association between these\nvariables. It is important to note, however, that the\nactivity restriction model of depressed affect,\nwhich describes that health-related stressors such\nas poor vision contribute to depressive symptom-\natology, is a well-established theoretical model in\nthe realm of adaptation to stress and that this\nmodel provided an excellent fit to the data in the\ncurrent study. Another limitation tied to the cross-\nsectional nature of the data is that the present\nstudy cannot speak to the issue of vision loss expe-\nrienced by the sample because prior levels of vision\nare unknown. As such, it is not possible to assess\nthe extent to which deterioration in vision plays a\nrole in well-being and the extent to which physical\nlimitations, driving limitations, and social isola-\ntion mediate the impact of such deterioration on\ndepressive symptomatology. Likewise, the present\ndata do not allow an examination of the impact of\ndriving cessation on depressive symptomatology.\nAs future waves of the NSHAP become available,\nhowever, it will be possible to assess longitudinal\nrelationships among deterioration in vision, the\nresulting loss of function (e.g., the cessation of\ndriving, decline in physical, and social function-\ning), and psychological adjustment. As indicated\nearlier, the current study also was limited in that\nonly one type of visual ability was assessed objec-\ntively, namely visual acuity; the NSHAP did not\ninclude other objective tests of visual function.\nHowever, research has indicated that in addition\nto visual acuity, age-related declines are seen in\ncontrast sensitivity, glare, and visual field tests\n(Rubin et al., 1997). The current study also did not\nassess the impact of diseases of the eye (e.g., age-\nrelated macular degeneration and glaucoma) that\nare known to have an adverse impact on older\nadults' quality of life (Crossland, Gould, Helman,\nFeely, & Rubin, 2007; Freeman, Munoz, West,\nJampel, & Friedman, 2008). Future research\nwould benefit from an inclusion of objective per-\nformance tests related to various aspects of vision\nand a closer examination of the effects of eye dis-\neases when studying the extent to which function-\ning is an intervening variable in the link between\npoor vision and depressive symptomatology. In\naddition, the present study used feelings of social\nisolation as an indicator of social functioning. This\nvariable has been assessed by other studies on late\nlife vision (e.g., Femia et al., 2001) and may be the\nresult of restricted social activities, but it does not\nassess social engagement per se. It also should be\nnoted that the measure of depressive symptomatol-\nogy (the CES-D; Radloff, 1977) relied on self-\nreport. It may be valuable for future studies to\nfocus on social engagement specifically and to use\na clinician-based measure of depressive symptom-\natology, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for\nDepression (Hamilton, 1960). Finally, the applica-\nbility of the activity restriction model may vary\nacross different groups (e.g., based on age, gender,\nor race), and psychosocial resources are likely to\nmitigate the adverse effects of poor vision on psy-\nchological adjustment (Bookwala, Resubmitted);\nhowever, these issues were not examined in the\npresent study. Further research is recommended\non such moderating variables in the psychological\nadjustment to poor vision. Despite the limitations\nthat are noted, the present study is characterized\nby several strengths and makes important and\nnovel contributions to our understanding of the\nlinkages among vision, physical and social func-\ntioning, and depressive symptomatology in late\nlife.\nFunding\nThe NSHAP is supported by the National Institutes of Health--the\nNational Institute on Aging, Office of Womens Health Research, Office of\nAIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research\nReferences\nBentler, P.
