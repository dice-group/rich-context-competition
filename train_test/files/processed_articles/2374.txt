Hookah smoking is\nrapidly gaining popularity among ado-\nlescents in the United States and\nworldwide. Existing data based on the\nindicated that 8% of adolescents\nreported ever trying hookah, and 3%\nreported using hookah within the past\nmonth.9 The most recent data pub-\nlished in the Morbidity and Mortality\nWeekly Review showed an increase of\ndents,1 and recent work by our group\nfound that nearly 1 in 5 adolescents in\nthe United States reported having tried\nhookah before high school gradua-\ntion.9 The most alarming statistic was\nrecently reported from the Monitoring\nthe Future (MTF) study, which found\nthat 12-month hookah use significantly\nincreased among US high school\nAlthoughtheliteratureonhealtheffects\nof hookah smoking and exposure to\nsecondhand smoke from hookahs is\nlimited,existingdataareconsistentand\nsuggest significant adverse health\noutcomes. Research has shown that\nhookahsdeliver tar,nicotine,andcarbon\nmonoxide in even higher doses than\nanalyses have linked hookah use to\nlung cancer, respiratory illness, peri-\nodontal diseases, and low birth weights.13\nIndividual studies have linked use to\naberrations,16 decreased pulmonary\ninfectious diseases.21 Surveys of univer-\nsity students in multiple countries, in-\ncluding the United States, suggest that\npeople are unaware of these dangers22\u00ad35\nand believe that hookah is less harmful\nA number of studies have examined the\nprevalence and correlates of hookah\nuse among local and national pop-\nulations,9,36 including US adolescents.\nThe current study complements and\nexpands on previous findings by in-\nvestigating a number of previously\nunexplored but potentially important\npredictors of adolescent hookah use in\na nationally representative sample of\nhigh school students in the United\nStates. This study delineates specific\ndemographic, socioeconomic, and sub-\nstance use factors related to hookah use\namong US high school seniors. It was\nhypothesized that more impoverished\nadolescents with more poorly educated\nparents would be more likely to use\nhookahs, as is true of adolescent ciga-\nrette use. Similarly, it was hypothesized\nthat hookah use would be independently\nassociated with use of cigarettes, alco-\nhol, and illicit drugs.\nMETHODS\nProcedure\nMTFisanannualcross-sectionalsurvey\nof high school seniors in 130 public\nand private schools throughout 48\nstates in the United States. Schools are\nselected through a multistage random\nsampling procedure: geographic areas\nare selected, then schools within areas\nare selected, and then students within\nschools are selected.37,38 Approximately\nMTF assesses content through 6 dif-\nferent survey forms, which are dis-\ntributed randomly. All forms assess\ndemographics, socioeconomic variables,\nand use of various licit and illicit sub-\nstances; however, only survey Form 3\nassesses (last 12-month) hookah use.\nTherefore, hookah use was assessed in\nonly about one-sixth of the sample. MTF\nthis analysis focuses on aggregated (and\nweighted)Form3datacollectedfromthe\n3 most recent cohorts with available\nreviewed and approved by the University\nof Michigan Institutional Review Board.\nMeasures\nStudents were asked to indicate their\nrace or ethnicity (ie, black, white, His-\npanic). MTF classified population\ndensity of students' residences as in\nterms of metropolitan statistical areas\n(MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as\ncounties or groups of counties with $1\nlargest MSAs are defined as large\nMSAs.37 Non-MSAs are the remaining\nareas. To assess family composition,\nstudents were asked which parents\nthey lived with. Answers were coded as\n0 parents, 1 parent, or 2 parents. Level\nof religiosity was determined by 2 or-\ndinal items that asked about level of\nreligious attendance and importance.\nThese items were computed into a\ncomposite (range 1\u00ad4) and divided into\nligiosity. Parent level of educational\nattainment (ie, grade school, some\nhigh school, high school graduate,\nsome college, college graduate, or\ngraduate school) was assessed for\neach parent, and a mean score for both\nparents (or raw score if only 1 parent)\neducation. Students were also asked\nhow much they earn during the aver-\nage week from a job or other work and\nhow much money they earned from\nother sources. Responses for each of\nthese 2 income items were coded into\nof sociodemographic variables was\nMTF assessed annual hookah use\nthrough the following item: \"During the\nlast 12 months, on how many occasions\n(if any) have you smoked tobacco using\na hookah (water pipe)?\" Answer options\nUsing the same answeroptions, MTFalso\nassessed lifetime use of alcohol, mari-\njuana (pot, weed, hashish), and other il-\nlicit substances including cocaine, crack,\nLSD, hallucinogens other than LSD, her-\noin, and nonmedical use of narcotics\n(other than heroin), tranquilizers (eg,\nbenzodiazepines), sedatives (eg, barbi-\nturates), and amphetamine. We di-\nchotomized hookah use into ever\nused versus never used, and use of\nall other illicit substances afore-\nmentioned was also dichotomized\ninto lifetime use (yes versus no) for\neach. A new indicator was created\nfor any illicit substance use other\nthan marijuana; specifically, stu-\ndents were coded as whether they\nindicated use of any of these sub-\nstances. This variable was computed if\nthe student provided data for $4 of\nthese substances (other than mari-\njuana). Therefore, students who did not\nprovide (yes/no) responses for $4\nsubstances were removed from the\nanalytic sample. Finally, lifetime ciga-\nrette use was assessed, and answer\noptions were never, once or twice, oc-\ncasionally but not regularly, regularly\nin the past, and regularly now.\nStatistical Analyses\nAnalyses focused on students with com-\nplete substance use and sociodemo-\nallowed race or ethnicity and religiosity\nto be missing. All analyses used the\nsurvey sample weights provided by MTF.\nThis was done to adjust for differential\nprobability of selection of schools and\nstudents. All percentages reported are\nalso weighted. Hookah use in the analytic\nsample did not significantly differ across\ncombining datasets into a single cross-\nsection for analysis. We examined de-\nscriptive statistics for each covariate\nand compared sample characteristics\naccording to hookah use (ie, no use\nversus use). This was done using Rao\u00ad\nScott x2 tests for homogeneity, which\ncorrect for the complex study design.41\nAll variables were then fit into a multi-\nvariable binary logistic regression model\nwith hookah use (yes or no) as the out-\ncome to determine conditional associa-\ntions (controlling forall other covariates).\nSpecifically, covariates were modeled to\nexplain hookah use compared with no\nuse. This model produces an adjusted\nodds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence in-\nterval (CI) for each covariate. Indicators\nfor cohort (with 2010 as the comparison)\nwere included in the model to adjust for\npotential cohort effects or secular trends,\nand because large percentages of stu-\ndents were missing race (14.8%) or re-\nligiosity (25.0%) data, we entered missing\ndata indicators into the model for these\n2 variables instead of deleting these\ncases.39,42 All analyses were design-based\nfor survey data (PROC SURVEYFREQ and\nPROC SURVEYLOGISTIC),43 conducted using\nSAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc,\nCary, NC).\nRESULTS\nThe annual prevalence of hookah use\nwas 18.0% (the mean prevalence of\ndescriptive statistics of the sample and\nthe comparisons of demographic, so-\ncioeconomic, and substance use vari-\nables by hookah use. Bivariable (x2\ntest) results suggest that identifying as\nmale, nonblack, or nonreligious was\nassociated with use. Likewise, students\nresiding in small or large MSAs and\nstudents reporting higher (eg, $$50)\nweekly income or income from \"other\nsources\" were more likely to report\nuse. In addition, students who smoked\ncigarettes (at any level other than\nnever) or reported lifetime use of al-\ncohol, marijuana, or other illicit sub-\nstances were all more likely to report\nhookah use. Hookah use did not sig-\nnificantly differ by age, family struc-\nture, or level of parental education.\nAfter examining bivariable associa-\ntions, we then fit all covariates simul-\ntaneously into a binary logistic\nregression model (Table 2). The model\nhad good fit (Nagelkerke R2 = 40%,\nCorrect Classification Rate = 85%).\nCompared with males, females were at\nlower odds for using hookah (AOR\nidentifying as black (compared with\nwhite) had lower odds of use (AOR\nwith residing in a non-metropolitan\nstatistical area, students in both\nAlthough religiosity was a protective\nfactor in the bivariable model, re-\nligiosity was not significant in explain-\ning hookah use in the multivariable\nmodel.

Use of other illicit sub-\nstances was also significantly associ-\nated with hookah use but to a weaker\ndegree than cigarette smoking, alcohol\nuse, and marijuana use.\nDISCUSSION\nThe emergence of widespread hookah\nuseamongUSadolescentshasresulted\nin a growing body of epidemiologic\nstudies on its use. However, most\nstudies have relied on small, non-\nrepresentativesamples.Incontrast,the\ncurrent study uses data from a large,\nnationally representative sample of\nconfirming previously identified risk\nfactors, this study also uncovered\na number of formerly unrecognized\ncorrelates of use by adolescents, such\nas urban residence and high parental\neducation. Moreover, higher weekly\nincome, cigarette smoking, and use of\nalcohol, marijuana, or other illicit\nsubstances were also found to be as-\nsociated with more frequent hookah\nuse.\nMany demographic predictors of hoo-\nkahuseuncoveredinthisstudy,suchas\nmale gender and nonblack race, were\nconsistent with findings of previous\nanother study49 found religiosity to be\na protective factor against use, in this\nstudy this association lost significance\nafter we controlled for other de-\nmographic, socioeconomic, and sub-\nstance use variables.

Given the cost of fre-\nquenting hookah bars, it is not sur-\nprising that wealthier students, as\nindicated by higher weekly income,\nare more regular visitors, although it\nremains unknown what proportion of\nhookah use occurs in hookah bars\nversus in homes or other non-\nthat students with higher parental ed-\nucation are more likely to be hookah\nusers also supports the hypothesis\nthat hookah smoking, unlike cigarette\nsmoking, is a social activity often oc-\ncurring among those of higher socio-\neconomic status. In fact, hookahs and\ncigarettes, though both tobacco prod-\nucts, have several differences in terms\nof their predictors and distribution of\nuse among US adolescents. Well-known\nrisk factors for cigarette use among\nadolescents, such as lower socioeco-\nnomic status and lower parental edu-\ncation, unexpectedly were associated\nSimilar to the findings of this study,\nSutfin et al35 reported concurrent use of\nhookah with alcohol, marijuana, and\nother illicit substances. Among current\nhookah users in the Sutfin study, 22%\nreported never trying a cigarette, sug-\ngesting that hookah use may be their\nfirst encounter with tobacco products.\nIn this study, only 6.3% reported never\nsmoking a cigarette. Given the addictive\nnature of the nicotine in tobacco, these\ndata raise concern that hookah use may\nserve as a gateway to cigarette smok-\ning. However, it may be more likely that\ncigarette use occurs before hookah use.\nTo better understand the temporal se-\nquence of hookah use relative to that of\ncigarette and marijuana use, Fielder\nwomen until graduation and found that\nprecollege hookah use predicted ciga-\nrette initiation or relapse, thereby sup-\nporting the aforementioned gateway\ntheory. Interestingly, although pre-\ncollege marijuana use predicted hoo-\nkah initiation, precollege cigarette use\npredicted neither hookah nor mari-\njuana initiation, suggesting a complex\ninterplay between these potentially ad-\ndictive substances. Clearly, more longi-\ntudinalstudiesusingmorerepresentative\nsamples are needed to investigate tem-\nporal associations.\nA common belief among adolescents\nand young adults is that hookah use is\nTABLE 2 Binary Logistic Regression Explaining Hookah Use in the Last 12 Months\n= Comparison)\nGender\nAge, y\nRace\nPopulation density\nReligiosity\nFamily structure\nParent education\nWeekly income from job\nWeekly income from other source\nCigarette smoking\nLifetime alcohol use\nLifetime marijuana use\nLifetime use of other illicit substances\nThe reference group consists of non\u00adhookah users (n = 4502).

In ad-\ndition,MTFbeganassessinghookahuse\nonly 1 of 6 survey forms, so the amount\nof data available was limited. We com-\nbined the 3 cohorts of available data,\nand annual prevalence did not differ\nsignificantly across cohorts, so we did\nnot examine trends over time. Although\nthere were no statistical differences in\nprevalence by cohort, we still included\ncohort indicators in analyses.

As an in-\ncreasingly popular social activity\namong adolescents, hookah smoking\nseems to appeal to those of higher\nsocioeconomic status and interplays\nwith cigarette smoking, alcohol, and\nillicit substance use on many complex\nlevels. Given the rudimentary un-\nderstanding of hookah use, it is crucial\nfor educators, health professionals,\nresearchers, and policy makers to\ncollaborate to fill in gaps in public un-\nderstanding of its harm and guide\npublic interventions to diminish prob-\nlematic hookah smoking.\n"
