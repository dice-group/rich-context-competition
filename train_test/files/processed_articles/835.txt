    "abstract": "Abstract: This DataWatch examines trends in health insurance coverage of children using recent\ndata from the Current Population Survey. The results indicate that the number and proportion of\nchildren who were uninsured changed little between 1988 and 1992. However, substantial changes\noccurred in the composition of the insured population: The proportion of children covered by\nthe proportion of children covered by Medicaid increased from 15.6 percent to 21.6 percent over the\nsame period. These results indicate that a fundamental shift is occurring in responsibility for insuring\nthe nation's children--from the private sector to the public sector.\nFor children, as for the population in general, health insurance is a\ncritical link to health care. Uninsured children use fewer physician\nservices than insured children use and are significantly less likely than\npublicly insured poor children are to identify a usual source of routine care.1\nAlthough most children are covered by some form of private insurance for\nall or part of their health care needs, a sizable number of children in the\nUnited States are uninsured. Of the estimated 38.5 million Americans under\nage sixty-five without health insurance in 1992, one-fourth were age eight-\neen and younger.2 The percentage of children without any form of health\ninsurance has grown significantly in recent years, increasing by 40 percent\nrelationship between health insurance and access to care.\nThe purpose of this DataWatch is to examine children's health insurance\nstatus using the most current data available. We base this profile on data\nfrom the Current Population Survey (CPS). We examine differences in\nhealth insurance coverage patterns in 1992 according to family charac-\nteristics and parents' attachment to the work force. We also assess recent\ntrends in insurance coverage to determine whether the percentage of chil-\ndren without insurance has continued to rise in the 1990s.\nData sources.

We classified\nsample children as being covered by employer-based private health insur-\nance if an adult in the household had employer-based private health insur-\nance that covered the child. Public insurance was defined to include\nMedicaid, Medicare, or military coverage. A child was considered to be\nuninsured if no private or public insurance coverage was reported for that\nFindings\nCoverage and family characteristics. In 1992, 87.6 percent of children\nunder age eighteen had some form of private or public health insurance\ncoverage (Exhibit 1). Three out of four insured children had private health\ninsurance, while one out of four had some form of public coverage (Medic-\naid, Medicare, or the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uni-\nformed Services [CHAMPUS]).\nPatterns of insurance coverage varied considerably for children of differ-\nent family characteristics. Most children with private insurance are insured\nas dependents under a parent's employer-based policy. In 1992, 81 percent\nof privately insured children, or thirty-eight million children nationwide,\nwere covered through such insurance plans. Children most likely to have\nemployer-based coverage were adolescents, non-Hispanic whites, children\nin two-parent families, and children in higher-income households.\nNot surprisingly, differentials in rates of employer-based coverage were\nlargest for those characteristics most closely associated with employment\nstatus: race and ethnicity, family structure, and family income.8 Specifically,\nnon-Hispanic white children were almost twice as likely as black or His-\npanic children to have employer-based insurance, while children in two-\nparent families were almost three times as likely as children in single-parent\nhouseholds to be covered by employer-based plans.

A substantial income gradient is also apparent, with\nnearly two-thirds of children in families with incomes below poverty hav-\ning Medicaid coverage, compared with slightly more than one-fifth of\nchildren in near-poor families and less than one-tenth of children in\nfamilies with incomes above twice the poverty level10\nIt is apparent that despite public- and private-sector efforts to broaden\nprivate health insurance coverage and congressionally mandated Medicaid\nexpansions, a significant minority of children remains uninsured--83 mil-\nlion children, or 12.4 percent of all noninstitutionalized children in 1992.\nGroups at risk of being uninsured included adolescents, minorities, children\nliving with a single parent, and children in poor and near-poor families.\nImportantly, even though minority children and other children from disad-\nvantaged family circumstances are disproportionately represented among\nthe uninsured, they do not dominate this population. Specifically, non-\nHispanic white children made up a majority of the uninsured child popula-\ntion in 1992. Most uninsured children were members of two-parent fami-\nlies, and nearly two-thirds were in families with incomes above the poverty\nlevel.\nParents' attachment to the work force. Given that most Americans\nreceive health insurance through the workplace, it is not surprising that\nhealth insurance coverage among children would be closely related to the\nwork-force attachment of parents. Two of the most important determinants\nof employer-based coverage for children are the number of workers in the\nfamily and whether the family head (the parent with the highest earnings)\nis a full-time worker (Exhibit 2).\nHealth Insurance Status Of Children, By Work-Force Attachment Of Their\nCharacteristic\nNumber of working parents\nNone\nOne\nTwo\nLabor-market status of\nhead parent in the past year\nNonworker\nPart-time worker\nFull-time worker\nFrequency\n(thousands)\nTotal\nprivate\nEmployer\ncoverage\nTotal\npublic\nMedicaid\nNo health\ninsurance\nSource: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey, March 1993; tabulations by the authors.\nNotes: Excludes children living without natural or adoptive parents.

While only a tiny fraction of children in nonworker\nfamilies had employer-based coverage, more than half of all children with a\nworking parent were covered by such plans. Having two working parents\ngreatly increased the likelihood of having employer coverage. Indeed, four\nout of five children with two working parents had employer coverage, and\nonly 8 percent of children in this group were uninsured in 1992.\nWhether the principal breadwinner in the family worked part time or full\ntime also had a substantial impact on the likelihood that a child was\ncovered by employer insurance. Only one in five children were covered by\nemployer-based plans in families in which the head worked only part time.\nThis compares to seven in ten children with such coverage in families in\nwhich the head worked full time.\nFamilies with limited attachment to the work force in 1992 relied heavily\non public coverage--principally Medicaid--to meet the health insurance\nneeds of their children. Public plans covered nearly 80 percent of children\nin families in which the head was not in the work force and almost half of\nall children in families in which the head worked only part time.\nIn fact, public coverage made up for most of the gaps in private coverage\nfor families with limited attachment to the work force. For example, chil-\ndren in families with no working parents were about equally as likely as\nchildren in families with a working parent to have some form of insurance.\nSimilarly, children in families in which the head was a nonworker were\nequally as likely as children in families in which the head worked full time\nto have some type of coverage.\nThe uninsured child population comprises primarily children whose\nparents have a strong attachment to the work force. In 1992 fully three-\nfourths of all uninsured children were members of families with at least one\nworking parent. Moreover, 70 percent of uninsured children belonged to\nfamilies in which the principal breadwinner was a full-time worker.\nchildren with some type of health insurance coverage climbed from 55.6\nBecause the overall child population grew by 5 percent during this period,\nthe percentage of children with insurance coverage rose slightly, from 86.9\npercent to 87.6 percent. While the percentage of children who were unin-\nsured declined commensurately, the numeric count of uninsured children\nremained virtually unchanged over the period.\nThe apparent stability in the percentage of children with insurance over\npublic coverage.

The economic downturn, combined with continued medical care\nprice inflation, also affected businesses' ability to provide costly health\nbenefits to their remaining workers. The industrial composition of the\ncountry was changing as well, with a rapid shift of jobs from industries such\nas manufacturing, characterized by generous fringe benefits, to jobs in the\nservice sector, characterized by lesser benefits.11 The net result of these\ntrends was a marked reduction in the percentage of children covered by\n(Exhibit 3). The entire decline was attributable to loss of employer-based\ninsurance. The proportion of children with employer-based coverage de-\nclined, while coverage under other types of private insurance, such as\nindividually purchased policies, increased modestly.\nTo illustrate the effect of declining rates of employer coverage, we\napplied the 1988 rate of employer-based coverage for children (60.7 per-\ncent) to the 1992 child population. The difference between this figure and\nthe actual number of children with employer-based coverage in 1992 indi-\ncates the net loss in children's employer-based coverage attributable to\nchanges in coverage rates and population growth.

This large increase was the result of\nlegislative changes enacted by Congress in the 1980s, as well as the reces-\nsion that pushed more families into poverty during the early 1990s. Follow-\ning more than a decade of retrenchment in Medicaid eligibility at the state\nand federal levels, Congress began enacting a series of eligibility expansions\nin 1984 that gradually required states to cover larger numbers of low-\nincome children and pregnant women.12 Additional increases in Medicaid\nployment resulted in a substantial increase in the number of children living\npercentage of children living in poor families rose from 19.7 percent to 22.2\npercent--a net increase of 2.3 million children.\nWinners And Losers\nBoth the contraction of employer-based health insurance and the expan-\nsion of Medicaid coverage were broadly felt across the child population.\nHowever, children were not equally affected (Exhibit 4). Almost all sub-\ngroups of children experienced reductions in employer-based insurance\ndren in low-income families, and children in families with weak attach-\nment to the work force were at greatest risk of losing employer coverage. In\ncontrast, children in higher-income families and in families with two work-\ning parents experienced only a slight elevation in the risk of losing em-\nployer coverage.\nMedicaid expansions increased the likelihood of coverage for all sub-\nHispanic white and Hispanic children, and children in near-poor families\nwere most likely to benefit from these expansions. Large relative increases\nin coverage also occurred for children in certain types of families that\ntraditionally have been excluded from Medicaid coverage, including two-\nparent families, moderate-income families, and families with at least one\nworking parent. However, care must be taken in interpreting changes over\ntime for children in these groups. Since Medicaid covered only a small\nproportion of children in these groups during the base year, even modest\nabsolute changes can result in substantial relative changes.\nFor the child population as a whole, the expansion of Medicaid coverage\nmore than offset the contraction in employer-based coverage between 1988\nand 1992. The result was a modest reduction in the overall likelihood that\nchildren would be without insurance, as shown in the last set of columns in\nExhibit 4.

The decline in employer coverage was the cumulative\nresult of several trends, including growing numbers of employers dropping\ndependent coverage for their workers and a shift in the labor market toward\nfields of employment that are less generous with health benefits. The\ndecline in Medicaid coverage during this period was largely the result of\nmore restrictive federal Medicaid eligibility rules and the failure of state\ngovernments to adjust income eligibility thresholds to keep pace with\nExamining more recent data on children's insurance coverage, we found\nthat the downward trend in employer-based private coverage has contin-\nued, even accelerated, into the early 1990s. During the ten-year period\ncoverage of children declined 4.8 percentage points--from 67.7 percent to\nemployer coverage declined 4.5 percentage points--from 60.7 percent to\nuted to a 40 percent increase in the proportion of children without any\nform of insurance. Despite the recent acceleration in the rate of loss of\nprivate insurance, the proportion of children without any insurance actu-\nsize of the uninsured population is largely attributable to expanded Medic-\naid coverage for children. As a result, nearly five million children were\nsignificant role Medicaid plays in providing a safety net for children. In the\nface of large-scale losses in employer coverage and severe economic con-\ntraction, the elastic nature of the Medicaid program has helped to provide\nmillions of children with continued access to care.\nA number of studies have confirmed Medicaid's value in ensuring access\nto health care services for children. Among children from poor families,\nthose with Medicaid coverage have been shown to be more likely than\nthose without Medicaid coverage to have a usual source of health care and\nto receive routine preventive care services (such as physical, eye, and dental\nexams) at professionally recommended intervals.15 Moreover, while unin-\nsured children from poor families lag behind children from nonpoor fami-\nlies in their overall use of ambulatory care, children from poor families with\nMedicaid coverage do not differ much from nonpoor children.16\nAlthough Medicaid provides important insurance protection for chil-\ndren who otherwise would be uninsured, it does not afford children the\nsame level of access to care that private health insurance provides.

Indeed, the\nrecent increase in the rate of decline in employer-based coverage for chil-\ndren is an ominous sign. This trend suggests increased reliance on Medicaid\nas a coverage source of last resort for families losing private coverage\nbecause of the changing economy or employer cutbacks in benefits for\ndependents. The needs of these vulnerable families, combined with the\nevidence presented in this paper on Medicaid's efficacy and its relatively\nlow per child cost, must be considered by policymakers as they debate the\nfuture of this program.\nResearchfor this paper was supported inpart by grantsfrom the Maternal and Child Health Bureau,\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (no.

All insurance variables, with one exception, were created using a methodology identi-\ncal to that employed by the Bureau of the Census. This exception applies only to a\nrelatively small number of children reported as having private health insurance cover-\nage that was provided through someone living outside the household. Although the\ninterview question regarding coverage provided by persons living outside the household\ndoes not elicit the type of private coverage provided (employer-based or individually\npurchased), the Census Bureau classifies this coverage as being provided through an\nemployer-based plan. We chose not to make this assumption. Specifically, we counted\nthese children as privately insured but not as having employer-based coverage. Conse-\nquently, estimates of the total number of children reported with private health\ninsurance presented here are identical to Census Bureau estimates, but estimates of the\nsubtotal of children with employer-based coverage differ. Our approach results in a\nslight underestimate of the actual population with employer-based coverage, while the\nCensus Bureau approach results in a slight overestimate.\n8. Employment status does not explain all of the differences in rates of private coverage\nby race, family structure, and income. A separate multivariate analysis revealed that\nafter parental employment status was controlled for, minority children and children\nfrom single-parent or low-income families were still at a disadvantage in obtaining\nprivate insurance coverage. Controlling for occupation and industry might further\nexplain differences in rates of private coverage.\n9. Medicaid participation rates are also likely to be higher for younger children and\nespecially infants, because enrollment is automatic for the newborn children of preg-\nnant women enrolled in the Medicaid program.\n10.
