Limited literature on workplace bullying from Indian perspective can be attributed to\nthe paucity of standardized tools for investigating its prevalence. This study reports validation, psychometric properties, and\ncutoff scores for Negative Acts Questionnaire\u00adRevised (NAQ-R) in Indian sample (N = 1,053). Confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA) revealed a best fit three-factor model of work-related bullying, person-related bullying, and physically intimidating\nbullying NAQ-R demonstrated high reliability and validity using CFA and Pearson's correlation with measures of burnout,\nwork engagement, and perceived victimization. Two cutoff points for NAQ-R were formulated using receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve for categorizing respondents as \"never bullied\" (scores below 40), \"occasionally bullied\" (scores between\n40 and 56), and \"severely bullied\" (scores above 56). Based on these scores, 46% of the employees were found being bullied\nat work, either occasionally or frequently. NAQ-R is a valid and psychometrically sound measure to examine workplace\nbullying in India. Clear cutoff scores may help practitioners in designing prevention and intervention strategies. As NAQ-R\nis the most extensively tried and tested measure of workplace bullying worldwide, the findings of the study may facilitate\ncross-cultural comparisons.\n",

In the late 1980s, researchers turned\ntheir attention to adult bullying within the context of work-\nplace (Leymann, 1990) and since then it became a subject of\nextensive research in scholarly fields in the contemporary\norganizational research (Petrovic, Cizmic, & Vukelic, 2014)\nwith the plethora of recent developments and discussions\nacross a number of countries. Dominated by Western perspec-\ntives, literature on workplace bullying is relatively recent and\nscanty in Eastern as well as developing countries (Paull &\n1J&K Higher Education Department, India\n2University of Jammu, India\n3University of Bergen, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nRicha Gupta, UGC-Senior Research Fellow, Assistant Professor\n(Psychology), Higher Education Department, Govt. of Jammu and\nEmail: rgsagitarius@gmail.com\nInvestigating Workplace Bullying in\nIndia: Psychometric Properties, Validity,\nand Cutoff Scores of Negative Acts\nQuestionnaire\u00adRevised\nRicha Gupta1, Arti Bakhshi2, and St\u00e5le Einarsen3\n Keywords\nworkplace bullying, India, NAQ-R, validity, reliability, perceived victimization\n2 SAGE Open\nissues pertaining to measurement of workplace bullying are\nof utmost importance (Notelaers & Einarsen, 2013), limited\nliterature on workplace bullying from Indian perspective may\ndraw attention toward paucity of a standardized tool to esti-\nmate prevalence of workplace bullying in India. A review of\nliterature affirms that targets usually deny being bullied for\nmany reasons (Jamieson, Mitchell, Le Fevre, & Perry, 2015)\nwhile reporting extensive exposure to specific acts of work-\nplace bullying (Nielsen et al., 2009). Underreporting related\nto workplace bullying is a matter of concern in India also\nmeasure for the investigation of the problem in Indian service\nsector is essential. Owing to the sensitivity of the issue and its\naftermath, Paull and Omari (2016) have cautioned to general-\nize findings regarding workplace bullying to different cultural\ncontexts as the prevalence of workplace bullying has varying\nestimates across the world (Einarsen et al., 2011; Nielsen,\nMatthiesen, & Einarsen, 2010). On the positive side, under-\nstanding cultural variations in the identification of workplace\nbullying is also important for the effectiveness of preventive\nand intervention strategies (D'Cruz, Paull, Omari, & Guneri-\nAim of the Study\nAddressing the gaps that have evolved in the literature con-\ncerning a reliable and valid measure of workplace bullying, to\nidentify the nature and extent of the problem in India and to\nfacilitate cross-cultural comparisons across nations using uni-\nform standardized measures (D'Cruz & Rayner, 2015;\nNielsen, Notelaers, & Einarsen, 2011; Notelaers & Einarsen,\n2013), the present study was aimed at assessment of validity\nand psychometric properties including reliability and factor\nstructure of Negative Acts Questionnaire\u00adRevised (NAQ-R)\nin Indian sample. NAQ-R is the most widely tested and exten-\nsively used indirect measure of workplace bullying (Giorgi,\nbeen used in more than 300 research projects (Notelaers &\nEinarsen, 2013) across different sectors with more than\nAlthough an internationally acclaimed indirect standardized\nmeasure of workplace bullying (Ciby & Raya, 2015), NAQ-R\nhas been developed in Norway (Einarsen, Hoel, & Notelaers,\n2009) and tested mostly in Western countries.As national cul-\nture is an important determinant of employees' perceptions\nregarding bullying behaviors at work (Escartin, Zapf, Arrieta,\n& Rodriguez-Carballeira, 2011), assessment of validity and\npsychometric properties of NAQ-R is essential before its use\nin Indian context. Given the nature of measurement scale\nunderlying response categories of NAQ-R (Einarsen et al.,\n2009), reliability and validity assessment of the same using\nconfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is highly recommended\n(Said, Badru, & Shahid, 2011). This study is the first to report\nreliability and validity assessment of NAQ-R using CFA\napproach. As suggested by Cronbach and Meehl (1955),\nconstruct validity of the questionnaire was also confirmed by\ncorrelating the scores obtained on the measure of NAQ-R\nwith the scores of respondents on the measures of theoreti-\ncally related constructs of bullying such as work engagement\nand burnout using Pearson's correlation. Work engagement\nrefers to the strength of connection people have with their\nworking environment which may actually buffer individuals\nfrom occupational stressors and its effects (Bakhshi & Gupta,\n2016). Burnout has been defined as an extreme form of stress-\nrelated problem for employees (Figueiredo-Ferraz, Gil-\nMonte, & Grau-Alberola, 2013). As bullying has also been\nconsidered as a stressor at work (Hauge, Skogstad, &\nEinarsen, 2010), constructs of burnout and work engagement\nhave been chosen for the assessment of convergent and dis-\ncriminant validity of NAQ-R, respectively. Based on previ-\nous researches (Einarsen, Skogstad, Rorvik, Lande, &\nthat NAQ-R would show positive correlations with measures\non burnout and negative correlations with work engagement.\nMost of the studies undertaken in different countries have\nmeasured workplace bullying using a single criterion for\nidentification of targets from nontargets based on an objec-\ntive measure (Nielsen et al., 2011), with no scope for assess-\ning variation in the degree of severity of exposure to bullying.\nBullying at work has been defined as an escalating process\n(Einarsen et al., 2011), providing cutoff scores for bullying\nassessment are, thus, consistent with the theoretical consid-\nerations of the construct. Cutoff scores based on receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve are also essential for\nevaluating the diagnostic value of a measuring instrument\n(Hajian-Tilaki, 2013) to differentiate victims from nonvic-\ntims. In India, no such effort has been made earlier to quan-\ntify the process of workplace bullying in a broader manner.\nAlso, with NAQ-R as a universally approved measure of\nworkplace bullying, providing cutoff scores for NAQ-R\nfrom different cultures would facilitate cross-cultural com-\nparisons regarding variations in the prevalence of workplace\nbullying. In consideration with this, the present study pro-\nvided cutoff scores for NAQ-R to identify victims of work-\nplace bullying using ROC curve analysis with a self-labeling\nmeasure of victimization that is often used in the area of\nworkplace bullying (Nielsen et al., 2011) as a criterion refer-\nence. Further relationship between perceived victimization\nand exposure to bullying at work on the factors and total\nscores of NAQ-R was explored to confirm criterion validity\nof NAQ-R and to ascertain negative acts that have been con-\nsidered by the targets as typical of workplace bullying.\nWorkplace Bullying in India\nEven though workplace bullying has been identified as an\nimportant issue to consider across the world (Einarsen et al.,\n2011), academic literature on workplace bullying in India is\nlimited as compared with other countries with little substan-\ntive data available on the nature, prevalence, and extent of\nGupta et al. 3\nworkplace bullying in India. Empirical research on work-\nplace bullying in India has been pioneered by D'Cruz and\nbullying in Information Technology Enabled Services-\nBussiness Process Outsourcing (ITES-BPO) sector of India\nand providing mean score for classification of respondents\non the basis of severity level using the Work Harassment\nScale (Bjorkqvist, Osterman, & Hjelt-Back, 1992). D'Cruz\n(2012), the author of the book Workplace Bullying in India,\nstrongly suggested that workplace bullies do exist in India\nand asserted that it is difficult to determine the extent of\nworkplace bullying due to the dearth of empirical data. Apart\nfrom the ITES-BPO sector, the prevalence of workplace bul-\nlying has also been investigated in other sectors, for exam-\nple, among bank employees (Gupta, 2013a), college teachers\njunior doctors (Bairy et al., 2007). Bullying still remains\nunderstudied in India and most employing organizations are\nwoefully unmindful of its dynamics and consequences as the\nphenomenon has not yet gained much academic attention in\nThe concerning issue of workplace bullying among Indian\nworkforce has also gained attention in case of several popu-\nlar online outlets and more traditional trade publications (see\nhttp://www.citehr.com, http://www.ipetitions.com, and\nhttp://www.womensweb.in). Articles on workplace bullying\nreflecting on the nature and frequency of hostility, and mis-\ntreatment that occurs in Indian workplaces have also been\npublished in The Times of India, The Hindu, The Indian\nExpress, and so on. Recently, the subject of workplace bully-\ning in India has also been highlighted in bollywood movies\nlike Rocket Singh and to some extent in the movie Kartik\nCalling Kartik. This suggests that Indian settings are worthy\nand in need of concerted attention by researchers with respect\nto workplace bullying.\nMeasuring Workplace Bullying\ninitial formulation of the term harassment, mobbing, or bul-\nlying, one of the major concerns has been how to assess the\nphenomenon under study. Behavioral (perceived exposure to\nbullying behaviors) and subjective (perceived victimization)\nmeasures have been the two most commonly used assess-\nment methods for estimating prevalence of target exposure to\nworkplace bullying worldwide (Nielsen et al., 2011). The\nbehavioral experience method investigates exposure to bul-\nlying behaviors at work based on the frequency and repeti-\ntiveness of exposure to such behaviors within a given time.\nCommonly used measures among them include Leymann\nInventory of Psychological Terror (LIPT; Leymann, 1996),\nWork Harassment Scale (Bjorkqvist et al., 1992), Workplace\nAggression Research Questionnaire (Harvey & Keashly,\nmethod provides the respondents with an operational\ndefinition of workplace bullying to which the respondents\nare required to indicate whether they acknowledge them-\nselves as the entity of being a victim of bullying over a period\nof time at work (O'Moore, Lynch, & Daeid, 2003). The self-\nlabeling approach is more dependent on the respondent's\nunderstanding of the bullying phenomenon and would appear\ninsufficient in countries where the research is still at infancy\nand the concept is less known in general public (Giorgi et al.,\n2011). While focus on subjective evaluations and victim's\nvulnerability as well as cultural and individual sensitivity\ncan introduce response bias and prejudice, using an indirect\nbullying measure following an operative criterion for inves-\ntigating exposure to a range of different negative acts at work\nduring the last 6 months would avoid priming effects and in\nturn facilitate cross-cultural comparisons (Einarsen et al.,\nAs underreporting is a serious concern in having true esti-\nmates regarding the prevalence of workplace bullying, the\npresent study relied on NAQ-R, currently the most widely\nused indirect measure of workplace bullying, for investigating\nits prevalence in India. Each item of NAQ-R describes a typi-\ncal bullying behavior that prevails in workplaces with no ref-\nerence to the term bullying to preclude \"cuing\" the respondents\nand to avoid possible bias introduced by them like their level\nof awareness about the phenomenon or being oversensitive.\nMethod\nSample\nFor the present study, multistage sampling was used for\nsample selection. In the first stage, population was divided\ninto six clusters on the basis of zonal map of India such as\neast, west, north, south, central, and north east zone. West\nand north zones were selected as two clusters out of the six\nfor sample selection using simple random sampling. In the\nnext stages, states, districts, and then blocks were selected\nfrom the selected clusters by simple random sampling with-\nout replacement (SRSWOR). Because it has been estab-\nlished that the problem of workplace bullying is almost 3\ntimes more likely to occur in the health, educational, and\nsocial service sectors than in other occupations (European\nFoundation, 2002, as cited in Sloan, Matyok, Schmitz, &\nemployees working in these organizations and banking sec-\ntor located in the selected blocks was procured from the\noffices of Registrar General of India; Chief Education\nOfficer; Director, Health Services; Director, Social Welfare\nDepartment; Director, Statistical and Planning Department,\nand so on. Considering the nature of the issue being assessed\nand subsequent reluctance of Indian organizations to pro-\nvide access to their employees for data collection (D'Cruz,\n2012), only those organizations and respondents that\nwerewilling to participate in the study were chosen for sam-\nple selection by simple random sampling. Also, as\n4 SAGE Open\nthe criterion for claiming an incident as bullying involves\nrepetitive and regular exposure to such incidents over a\nperiod of time, that is, 6 months (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, &\nCooper, 2003), only those participants were included in the\nstudy who had more than 1 year of working experience in\ntheir present organizations. Thus, the present study explored\nthe dynamics of workplace bullying in a multi-occupational,\ncross sectional randomly selected sample of 1,053 employ-\nees working in various public and private organizations of\nIndia such as education, health, social service, and banking\nand insurance sector. Informed consent was obtained from\nthe participants before collection of data. Out of 1,053\nMajority of respondents (35%) were in the age group of 31\nto 40 years. In total, 37.4% of respondents were working in\nthe education sector, 36.9% in health sector, 17.1% in bank-\ning and insurance sector, and 8.6% in social service sector.\nOf all, 52.4% of the respondents were serving in govern-\nment organizations while 47.6% in the private. About 54%\nof the respondents were working on a temporary contract\nand 46% were employed on permanent basis.\nMeasures\nNAQ-R.Exposure to workplace bullying was assessed by\nusing revised version of NAQ-R (Einarsen et al., 2009). It\nconsists of 22 items with responses on a 5-point scale rang-\ning between specific temporal indicators: never, now and\nthen, monthly, weekly, and daily. NAQ-R measures expo-\nsure to workplace bullying in terms of three factors, namely,\nwork-related bullying, person-related bullying, and physi-\ncally intimidating bullying (Einarsen et al., 2009). Work-\nrelated bullying entails negative behaviors that are directed\nat the target's professional role and his or her ability to carry\nout work proficiently. Person-related bullying includes nega-\ntive behaviors that are predominantly demeaning for the tar-\nget personally whereas physically intimidating bullying\nenlists aggressive and negative behaviors of a more physical\nitem provides the respondent with a formal definition of\nworkplace bullying (Einarsen et al., 2011) on a five-point\nresponse category such as no; yes, but rarely; yes, now and\nthen; yes, once a week; and yes, several times a week. This is\na measure of perceived victimization in relation to workplace\nUtrechtWork Engagement Scale\u00ad9 (UWES-9). UWES consist-\ning nine items was used in the study to measure work engage-\nment in terms of vigor, dedication, and absorption with one's\njob. The scale has acceptable psychometric properties\n(Schaufeli, Bakker, & Salanova, 2006). A total score for\nwork engagement is computed with the mean score ranging\nfrom 0 to 6. Higher scores on the scale indicate higher\nengagement of employees at work. Reliability of the scale\nfor the present sample was found out to be .84.\nCopenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI).Burnout was measured\nwith the CBI (Kristensen, Borritz, Villadsen, & Christensen,\n2005). The CBI centers on exhaustion and is divided into\nthree scales. Personal Burnout enlists six items on general\nsymptoms of physical or psychological exhaustion. Work-\nRelated Burnout involves seven items on symptoms of\nexhaustion related to one's work. Client-Related Burnout\nconsists of six items on symptoms of exhaustion related to\nworking with recipients or clients. All three subscales can be\nsubtotaled into a score of 0 to 100 and averaged into a total\nscore of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher\nlevel of burnout. For the present sample, reliability of three\nResults\nCFA\nmodel evaluation. Based on NAQ-R literature (Einarsen\nVukelic, Cizmic, Petrovic, Tenjovic, & Giorgi, 2015), three\nexisting bullying models as per NAQ-R, that is, one-factor\nmodel of workplace bullying, two-factor model of work-\nand 22), and three-factor model of work-related, person-\nrelated, and physically intimidating bullying (Items 8, 9, and\n22), were tested. The determination of model fit was based\non a comparison of the robust versions of absolute fit indi-\nces such as chi-square statistics and the associated degrees\nof freedom, the comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of\nfit index (GFI), the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA), the root mean square residual (RMR), and incre-\nmental fit index such as the Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI). The\nsuggested cutoff values frequently mentioned in the litera-\nture indicating a good fit to the data include CFI and TLI \nA value of 2/df ratio in the range of 2 to 5 demonstrates\nan acceptable fit between the hypothetical model and\nthe observed sample data (Schumacker & Lomax, 2004;\nTabachnick & Fidell, 2007). While reporting of chi-square\nvalue and the relative degrees of freedom is highly recom-\nmended (Savalei, 2008), other approximate fit indices are\namong the most popular alternate measures of fitness in\nstructural equation modeling literature, and their use as a set\nprovides unique information for model assessment (Chan,\nPreliminary CFA Findings\nA summary of the measurement model findings based on the\nCFAs of three competing models of NAQ-R is presented in\nTable 1. Cutoff values recommended by Hu and Bentler\n(1999) were adopted for these fit indices. In the present\nGupta et al. 5\ncase, values of CFI/TLI indicated poor fit for single-factor\nmodel while marginal fit for two-factor and three-factor\nmodels. Other fit indices including 2/df, RMSEA, and\nRMR failed to exceed the minimum threshold for fit (Table\n1), indicating that the three models exhibited \"poor\" fit in\nthe present sample. Thus, the three hypothesized models of\nNAQ-R did not adequately describe the sample data, sug-\ngesting examination of modification indices to identify\npotentially useful revisions to a measurement model for\nAs mentioned earlier, NAQ-R has been developed and\ntested in a different context from India; therefore, cultural\nvariations in the nature and understanding of the phenome-\nnon being assessed by NAQ-R are inevitable (D'Cruz et al.,\n2016). While the modification indices give diagnostic infor-\nmation regarding problem areas of fit within a given model,\nmodel revisions based on modification indices were not\nattempted further as such revisions would have been incon-\nsistent with the theoretical foundations of CFA and are gen-\nerally not recommended unless supported by other residual\ndiagnostics (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). A better\napproach recommended is exploratory factor analysis (EFA;\nHoyle, 2000). Thus, due to the inconsistent CFA results (e.g.,\nthe failure to exhibit \"good\" fit for the three competing mod-\nels) and the lack of evidence based on Indian data for the\ntenability of the factor structure of workplace bullying as per\nNAQ-R, an EFA was performed to further review the factor\nstructure of NAQ-R and to determine whether an alternative\nmodel would yield better fit.\nEFA\nTo ensure the appropriateness of the data for EFA, both the\nKaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy\nand Bartlett's test of sphericity were conducted. The value of\n(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). In addition, the Bartlett's test of\nsphericity showed statistical significance (2, 231 =\nfor EFA. The 22 items of NAQ-R were subjected to maxi-\nmum likelihood estimation method with oblique rotation, as\nthe resultant factors were expected to be correlated (Einarsen\net al., 2009). Using eigenvalues of greater than 1.0 (Kaiser,\nextraction, a final three-factor model emerged explaining\n69.72% of the total variance. All the items were retained as\neach had factor loadings above .5 (Hair et al., 2010), with no\ncross-loadings in excess of .40. As shown in Table 2, all\nitems loaded on the intended factor except for Item 2, which\nwas loaded on the factor of person-related bullying. Overall,\nthe current findings are in line with existing literature regard-\ning factor structure of NAQ-R.\nFinal Model CFA Summary\nAfter exploring the factor structure of NAQ-R in the present\nsample, three CFAs were run to examine the model fitness of\nthe modified models of NAQ-R (single-factor, two-factor,\nand three-factor measurements) consistent with EFA find-\nings. Table 3 depicts the approximate fit indices for the three\ncompeting models. Noteworthy is that only the one-factor\nmodel exhibited a poor fit while both the two-factor and\nthree-factor models had excellent fit on the basis of fit indi-\nces such as CFI, TLI, GFI, RMR, and RMSEA providing\nsupport for Item 2 (Being humiliated or ridiculed in connec-\ntion with your work) as an indicator of work-related bullying\ninstead of person-related bullying. On comparing the two\nnested models of two-factor and three-factor structures, the\nchi-square difference test also showed that the three-factor\nmodel fits the present sample significantly better than the\nthe three-factor model is considered to provide the best fit to\nthe data compared with the two-factor model on the basis of\nsignificant chi-square difference test (Pratt, 2014).\nReliability and Validity\nTable 4 shows values of reliability and validity estimates\nbased on the present sample. Reliability estimates were\nassessed for all the three factors. To ensure the internal con-\nsistency, Cronbach's alpha has been used as it is the determi-\nnant of the reliability of the construct (Cronbach, 1951). All\nthe constructs achieved excellent internal consistency\nexceeding the conventional cutoff value of .70 (Hair et al.,\n2010). Composite construct reliability was also assessed\nwith calculated values ranging from .91 to .97 against the\nthe AVEs (average variances extracted) of all constructs are\nwell above the suggested value of .50, implying more than\nhalf of the variances in the respective constructs are explained\nby their corresponding measures (Fornell & Larcker, 1981;\nHair et al., 2010). Thus, the acceptable values of Cronbach's\nalpha, composite reliability, and AVEs provide support for\nthe convergent validity of NAQ-R for Indian sample using\nCFA (Hair et al., 2010). Following the same approach, dis-\ncriminant validity has been established by comparing AVEs\nof each construct with squared correlation of the paired con-\nstructs (Table 4). The AVEs for all constructs are greater than\nsquared correlation thereby supporting discriminant validity,\nTable 1. Initial Model Summary of CFA.\nNote.

Respondents' scores for workplace bul-\nlying on the measure of NAQ-R were correlated with the\nscores of burnout and work engagement on the scales of CBI\nand UWES-9, respectively. A significant positive relation-\nship was found between three factors of workplace bullying\nand dimensions of burnout such as work-related burnout,\npersonal burnout, and client-related burnout, while a signifi-\ncant negative relationship was observed between workplace\nbullying factors and work engagement (Table 5). The results\nwere in tune with previous findings corroborating correlates\nof workplace bullying as hypothesized earlier, thus demon-\nstrating construct validity of NAQ-R for measuring work-\nplace bullying in terms of its nomological networks (Hair\nROC Analysis\nData were subjected to ROC curve analysis for the determina-\ntion of cutoff points in relation to exposure to bullying at work.\nROC analysis calculates cutoff scores using Youden's index\nbased on the linear combination of sensitivity and specificity\n(Cutoff = Specificity + Sensitivity; Youden, 1950).

As the overall score on the\nscale of NAQ-R ranges from 22 to 110, the results of this study\nmay be helpful for categorizing respondents on the basis of\nfrequency of their exposure to bullying at work. Employees\nwith scores below 40 are not bullied, employees with scores\nbetween 40 and 56 are occasionally bullied, and employees\nwith scores above 56 are severely bullied at work.\nBased on the cutoff scores calculated, the results of the\npresent study revealed that out of 1,053 employees, about\nOverall, around 46% of the employees were found to be\nexposed to bullying at workplaces in India either occasion-\nally or frequently. The resulting scores on indirect behavioral\nitems correspond to the subjective labeling approach applied.\nAhighly significant and positive relationship of scores on the\nsingle item of subjective victimization was found with total\nscores of respondents on NAQ-R behavioral items (r = .74, p\n< .01) as well as with the three obtained factors of work-\nphysically intimidating bullying (r = .48, p < .01).\nDiscussion\nDrawing upon the need for systematic research on workplace\nbullying in India (D'Cruz, 2012), the present study assessed\nthe psychometric properties of NAQ-R in Indian sample to\ninvestigate the prevalence of employees' exposure to work-\nplace bullying and to provide evidence on its validity.\nFindings of the study revealed that workplace bullying is\nquite rampant in India as nearly half of the employees\nclaimed of being exposed to bullying at work either occa-\nsionally or frequently. Although the prevalence rate is high\nas compared with other countries (Nielsen et al., 2011;\nParent-Thirion, Fernandez-Macias, Hurley, & Vermeylen,\n2007), it corresponds to the previous findings with regard to\nestimation of exposure to workplace bullying in India\n(D'Cruz & Rayner, 2015). With the emergence of cut throat\ncompetition in Indian service sector (Singh, Vohra, &\nSharma, 2015), the high prevalence rate of bullying in Indian\nworkplaces becomes evident as workplace bullying has been\nlabeled as a form of discrimination at work on the basis of\ncompetence (Jones, 2006). The most frequent bullying\nbehaviors that employees experience in Indian workplaces\ninclude assigning unmanageable workload, giving task\nbelow one's level of competence, excessive monitoring of\none's work, and opinions and views being ignored, while the\nleast experienced behaviors include threats of physical vio-\nlence and abuse or actual abuse. Furthermore, three models\nof workplace bullying as per NAQ-R were tested with none\nhaving acceptable fit in Indian sample. EFA results of the\npresent study were inconsistent with the previous studies as\nItem 2 (Being humiliated or ridiculed in connection with\nyour work) has been found to be an indicator of factor named\nwork-related bullying instead of person-related bullying. In\nview of differences regarding conceptualizations of work-\nplace bullying across countries (Di Martino, Hoel, & Cooper,\n2003), with national culture as an important determinant of\nemployees'perceptions regarding bullying behaviors at work\n(Escartin et al., 2011), the contrasting results may be attrib-\nuted to cultural variation (Giorgi et al., 2011). As any nega-\ntive behavior directed toward one's professional role\nbecomes an indicator of work-related bullying (Notelaers &\nEinarsen, 2013), it can be argued that culture may influence\nthe perception of behaviors (e.g., humiliation or insult)\noccurring in association with one's work to be perceived as\ntargeted at one's professional role. Moreover, the findings\nmay be justified with respect to perpetrators of bullying at\nboth work and personal levels as humiliating or insulting\nsomeone in relation to his or her work may require knowl-\nedge about one's work with which everyone in the workplace\nmay not be aware of while bullying at personal level does not\ndemand knowledge of victim's work.\nThe revised three-factor model of NAQ-R (with Item 2 as\na part of work-related bullying) provided the best fit for its\nuse in India, though the two-factor model of work-related\nand personal-related bullying also had acceptable fit. As the\nincidents of physical aggression in workplace are very rare\n(Neuman & Baron, 1998) and physically intimidating bully-\ning is less acceptable than other forms of bullying on a global\nlevel and within each culture (Power et al., 2013), these find-\nings are in agreement with the previous studies supporting\nthe three-factor model of NAQ-R (Vukelic et al., 2015). The\nresults showed that NAQ-R has high internal consistency,\ncomposite reliability, and construct validity for the present\nsample. Significant positive and negative relationship of\nworkplace bullying with burnout and work engagement,\nrespectively, entails that bullied employees are less likely to\nTable 5.

The\nonly study undertaken in this regard by Notelaers and\noccasional and severe exposure to workplace bullying,\nrespectively, based on Norwegian sample. As the cutoff\nscores have been derived with subjective victimization as a\nstandard criterion, the results point out that Indian workforce\nis less likely to label its negative experiences at work as per-\nsonally threatening or indicator of bullying as compared with\ntheir European counterparts. The findings may again reflect\nupon cultural differences as people from collectivistic cul-\nture endorse a robust general belief in just world leading to\ndevelopment of psychological resilience (Wu et al., 2011)\nthat make them less likely to appraise the given situation as\nthreatening or stressful (McElroy, Wintemberg, Cronk, &\nPerceived victimization has a significant and positive\nrelationship with total NAQ-R scores as well as with all the\nthree factors of workplace bullying. Such finding provides\nadditional support for NAQ-R as a valid measure for work-\nplace bullying in Indian context. The strength of relationship\nbetween perceived bullying victimization at work and physi-\ncally intimidating bullying has not been as strong as com-\npared with the other two factors. The findings suggest that in\nIndia, bullying at work is conceptualized more in terms of\npsychological violence rather than a form of physical vio-\nlence. This corresponds to the view held by World Health\nOrganization regarding nature of workplace bullying (as\nGeneral Implications\nRecognized as a concerning issue internationally (Giorgi,\n2012) with varying estimates all over the world (Hershcovis,\nReich, & Niven, 2015), workplace bullying needs to be\nunderstood in context to Indian perspective (D'Cruz, 2016b)\nthereby bridging the gap in the professional knowledge base.\nDespite the fact that prevalence of workplace bullying is\nquite rife in India, the issue is either not reported or is under-\nreported (D'Cruz, 2012). The factors behind this inhibition\nto report the matter may include fear of negative conse-\nquences comprising negative evaluation, marring of future\njob prospects, apprehensions on getting a fair deal in absence\nof concrete laws, and so on. To cope up with such a tendency\nof victims, an indirect measure to assess bullying behaviors\nat work becomes essential. As survey length is generally an\nissue in most organizational studies (Nielsen, Hystad, & Eid,\n2016), the NAQ-R with a total of 22 short and fairly compre-\nhensible items, appears to be an easy-to-apply measure of\nworkplace bullying. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are\nno publications about its validation in India, either in its\ncomplete format or in the reduced version. Since NAQ-R is\nthe most extensively used instrument for measuring work-\nplace bullying (Dussault & Frenette, 2014), the findings of\nthis study would add to the given pool of research on work-\nplace bullying and would also facilitate international com-\nparisons regarding prevalence rate of workplace bullying\nacross the globe.\nPractical Implications\nThe findings of the study may be beneficial for clinical prac-\ntitioners as lack of awareness about workplace bullying in\nIndian context may unfortunately lead them to misdiagnose\nthe target of bullying which further makes the target feel vic-\ntimized a second time (Liu, 2012). It is further averred that\nproviding the clinicians with robust knowledge about bully-\ning in the workplace, other interpretations are possible (Liu,\n2012).As exposure to workplace bullying is a more crippling\nand devastating problem for employees than all other kinds\nof work-related stresses put together (Hogh, Mikkelsen, &\nemphasized that the prevention of stress-related health prob-\nlems is not possible without adequate information about spe-\ncific stress-related factors that are associated with health\nproblems in different occupational groups.\nAlthough there exist laws for protection against sexual and\nworkplace harassment, currently there is no legislation in\nIndia that specifically deals with bullying in the workplace\n(D'Cruz & Rayner, 2013), even though bullying is ranked on\nthe top among all forms of stressors present at work (Giorgi\nprevalent than sexual harassment (Namie, 2003). The need of\nthe hour is to raise awareness about the nature and prevalence\nof the issue which seems to be less likely in the absence of a\nstandardized measure to investigate the phenomenon. As ini-\ntiatives and endeavors to manage workplace bullying start\nwith the identification of the phenomenon and its targets with\nan understanding of how frequently it occurs (Caponecchia &\nexamine workplace bullying are fundamental for the develop-\nment and implementation of effective intervention strategies\nto prevent workplace bullying (Schat, Frone, & Kelloway,\n2006). This study may be helpful to HRs, social workers as\nwell as law and policy makers to realize that this issue needs\nto be identified and arrested by taking stern and immediate\nactions in the direction. Also governments and organizations\nare dependent on correct estimates of bullying to know how\nmuch time and resources are needed to handle the problem\n(Nielsen et al., 2010). Moreover, primary, secondary, and ter-\ntiary prevention and interventions are often encouraged or\ninitiated on the basis of employees'cutoff scores on measure-\nment instruments used in organizational surveys (Notelaers &\nEinarsen, 2013). Providing correct estimates about the extent\nof workplace bullying in India would be substantial for gov-\nernment agencies, organizations, and employers to check the\nGupta et al. 9\nrise of workplace bullying in Indian workplaces. Needless to\nadd that containing workplace bullying to a certain level will\nensure stress-free destinations as far as workplaces are con-\ncerned. Obviously, anticipating scope, newer ventures, and\nmost importantly overall well-being and happiness is irrefut-\nably the aim of any study being conducted worldwide.\nAlthough much has to be done to quench the desire of stress-\nfree workplaces, the research and findings of the present\nstudy regarding the validation of NAQ-R are a beginning\ntoward a consistent and valid measurement of workplace bul-\nlying in India. Considering the parameters and consistency,\nthe endorsement of the study is justifiable to a large extent.\nLimitations and Future\nRecommendations\nGiven the reluctance of Indian organizations to provide\naccess to their employees owing to the nature of the research\nproblem (D'Cruz, 2012), the sample size is relatively small\nas compared with other studies of similar nature undertaken\nin different countries (see Einarsen et al., 2009; Nielsen\net al., 2009). Larger sample size would have provided larger\nstatistical powers in the estimations. The present study inves-\ntigated the prevalence of workplace bullying on the basis of\nrespondents' own experiences of frequency of exposure to\nsuch behaviors that are not verified by other sources. In\nfuture, qualitative and longitudinal studies can be undertaken\nto gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon.\nAcknowledging the nature and extent of the problem, this\narea, if ignored, can crop up serious repercussions and needs\nto be further explored with the prime focus on the underlying\nfactors that mediate or moderate the effects of workplace\nbullying on victims so that effective intervention strategies\ncan be worked out.\nConclusion\nWorkplace bullying is a part of employee's experiences in\nIndian service sector. Suggestions from previous studies that\nhave inspired this investigation focus on the need to develop\na reliable and valid measure of workplace bullying in coun-\ntries where limited knowledge about phenomenon of work-\nplace bullying exists (Giorgi et al., 2011). The present study\nprovides preliminary support for NAQ-R as a reliable and\nvalid measure to assess workplace bullying in India on the\ndimensions of work-related, person-related, and physically\nintimidating bullying. The study may have important impli-\ncations for future research and practice related to workplace\nbullying in India. Considering the high-rate exposure and\nquantum of negative effects brewing up among Indian\nemployees and establishments due to workplace bullying\ncal use of NAQ-R has attained a significant relevance, thus\nbecoming a necessity in Indian arena.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nArbuckle, J.
