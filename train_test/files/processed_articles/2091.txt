Gait speed has potential to be\nimplemented in practice, using a stop\nwatch and a 4-m course. From a stand-\ning start, individuals are instructed to\nwalk at their usual pace, as if they were\nwalking down the street, and given no\nfurther encouragement or instructions.\nThedatainthisarticlecanbeusedtohelp\ninterpret the results. Gait speed may be\na simple and accessible indicator of the\nhealth of the older person.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Studenski had full access to\nall of the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Studenski, Faulkner,\nChandler, Nevitt, Kritchevsky, Ferrucci, Guralnik.\nAcquisition of data: Studenski, Faulkner, Nevitt, Visser,\nKritchevsky, Badinelli, Harris, Newman, Cauley,\nFerrucci, Guralnik.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Studenski, Perera,\nPatel, Rosano, Faulkner, Inzitari, Brach, Chandler,\nCawthon, Barrett-Connor, Nevitt, Visser, Harris,\nNewman, Cauley, Guralnik.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Studenski, Perera, Inzitari,\nBadinelli.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Studenski, Perera, Patel, Rosano,\nFaulkner, Brach, Chandler, Cawthon, Barrett-Connor,\nNevitt, Visser, Kritchevsky, Harris, Newman, Cauley,\nFerrucci, Guralnik.\nStatistical analysis: Studenski, Perera, Patel, Inzitari,\nChandler, Guralnik.\nObtained funding: Studenski, Chandler, Nevitt,\nKritchevsky, Badinelli, Harris, Newman, Ferrucci,\nGuralnik.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nStudenski, Patel, Rosano, Faulkner, Cawthon, Nevitt,\nVisser, Badinelli, Harris, Newman, Cauley\nStudy supervision: Perera, Nevitt, Newman.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have com-\npleted and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure\nof Potential Conflicts of Interest.
