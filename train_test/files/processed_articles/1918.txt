A growing\nnumber of studies have shown strong associations of sociodemographic factors with the\ndynamic changes of disability in the elderly (e.g., Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito 1994;\nStallard, and Corder 1995). With few exceptions (e.g., Crimmins and Saito 1993),\nalmost all prior studies consistently find that the incidence rate of disability increases\nwith age, whereas the probability of getting better decreases with age (e.g., Crimmins et\nin the dynamics of ADL disability is inconclusive. Some studies have reported that\nolder males have an advantage in disability dynamics over older females (Crimmins et\nstudies provide an opposite result (i.e., elderly women have the advantage) (e.g.,\nCrimmins and Saito 1993; Land et al 1994), and still others find that there is no\nsignificant gender difference in disability dynamics (Ferrucci et al. 1996; Guralnik et al.\n1997; Rogers et al. 1992). Contradictory results of racial and ethnic difference in\ndisability dynamics among elders are also frequently reported (Boult, Kane, Louis et al.\nmost studies have shown that the higher SES could reduce the risk of the onset of\ndisability and increase the likelihood to regain functioning at late ages (Crimmins et al.\nprotective effects are not significant or are weak (Melzer et al. 2001; van Groenou,\nDeeg, and Penninx 2001; Geroldi et al. 1996). Despite the challenges from several\nrecent studies (e.g., Arber and Cooper 1999), the protective effects of marriage on\ndisability at late ages have been widely recognized (Goldman, Korenman, and Weistein\narrangement on disability dynamics in older ages is somewhat less studied and the\nresults are largely divided (e.g., Grundy 2001; Hebert Brayne, and Spiegelhalter 1999).\nThe primary limitation of previous studies on the sociodemographic effect on\ndisability dynamics is, however, the underestimation of disability. Recent research has\nindicated that the underestimation of disability transition between survey intervals is\none of the major problems in research on population aging (Gill, Hardy, and Williams\n2002; Guralnik and Ferrucci 2002). The rate of the onset of disability at old ages is\nsubstantially underestimated in longitudinal studies, especially those with follow-up\nintervals of more than two years (Gill et al. 2002). Most previous studies that focus on\ndisability transition normally assume that there is a single transition between two\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 3\nadjacent surveys for survivors and have not covered the disability dynamic information\nof deceased persons, however. So far, six approaches to deal with the disability of the\ndecedents between survey intervals in the longitudinal study on disability transitions\nhave been employed: (a) excluding decedents' data from the analyses (e.g., Harris et al.\n1989) (Note 1); (b) combining death and disability into a single category (e.g., Roos\nand Havens 1991); (c) considering death and disability as separate categories but\nexcluding disability information for the decedents (e.g., Crimmins et al. 1996; Hayward\net al. 1998); (d) assuming that the decedents' probabilities of disability transitions are\nthe same as those of survivors with the same sex, age, health status, and some other\ncharacteristics (Manton and Land 2000); (e) estimating simulated monthly transition\nprobabilities of disability using the microsimulation approach (Laditka and Wolf 1998);\nand (f) including the decedents' disability information before dying collected from the\nnext-of-kin of the deceased respondents in the estimation of disabled life expectancy\nthrough an extended multi-state life table method (Zeng, Gu, and Land 2004). By\ncomparing 24 monthly assessments of functional disability with a single assessment\nover a 24-month interval, Gill et al. (2002) found that the underestimation of disability\nwas considerably high, and increased progressively as the length of assessment interval\nincreased. Zeng et al. (2004) found that the disabled life expectancy was significantly\nunderestimated if information concerning the changes in disability status before death\nwere excluded.\nThe second limitation of previous studies is that the oldest-old subjects have not\nyet received sufficient attention when studying the correlates of disability. Over the past\nfew decades the oldest-old have been the subpopulation with the highest increase rate\nboth in absolute terms and as a percentage of the total population worldwide (UN\n2002). However, insufficient attention has been paid to this group even though studies\non the disability of the oldest-old have grown rapidly since the 1990s due to\nimprovements in the availability of data sets (Andersen-Ranberg et al. 1999; Evert et\ncommunity-dwelling oldest-old has been reported as high as around 40-50% (e.g.,\nCornoni-Huntley et al. 1992), and the two-year incidence rate of the onset of disability\nis around 25% for females and 10% for males (e.g., Melzer et al. 2001). However, it\nwas found that in most longitudinal studies quite a few of the oldest-old who, once\ndisabled, could regain independence in their ADL function. For example, the two-year\nrecovery rate is as high as 10-20% (Melzer et al. 2001). One recent study based on\nmonthly survey even reports that around 80% of the respondents aged 70 and older\nregained ADL independence and maintained more than two months within 12 months\nfrom their initial disability; and 57% of them maintained for more than six months\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n4 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhave onset of a disease or have not yet been diagnosed with any disease except\nosteroarthritis (Note 2). Another study indicates that 20% of female centenarians and\n45% of male centenarians could carry out ADL independently (Andersen-Ranberg et al.\n1999). These studies provide evidence that the heterogeneity of disability dynamics in\nvery high ages does exist. Awareness of the heterogeneity of functional ability,\nvariations in rates of changes in functioning, and their correlates among the oldest-old\npopulation is very important in the study of healthy longevity. Disability dynamics\namong the oldest-old have not yet been systematically examined. Thus, improvement in\nknowledge of dynamic patterns of disability of the oldest-old would lead to the ability\nto better predict their future disability transitions, develop strategies, conduct\nintervention programs, and formulate sound policies.\nThe third limitation of previous studies is that most of them have been based on\npopulations in Western developed nations, particularly in the Unites States and Europe,\nand research on disability of the elderly in developing countries has been rare, although\nseveral recent studies have dealt with a few Asian and African countries (e.g., Lamb\nof them focused on the oldest-old. China, a developing country, has the largest number\nof oldest-old in the world. The number of oldest-old in China in 2000 reached 12\nastonishing trend raises questions about the functional ability of the oldest-old, quality\nof life in their late age and the sustainability of the current health system of China.\nHowever, very little was known about the disability dynamics of this subpopulation in\nChina. Given that China differs substantially from Western developed societies in\nliving arrangement, health practice, cultural setting, and sociopolitical system including\nhealth care policy, studies on the Chinese oldest-old population could provide a better\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms of prevalence and dynamics of disability.\nBased on the above considerations, the main purposes of this study are (1) to\nexplore sociodemographic effects on the onset of disability and recovery from disabled\nstatus; and (2) to examine the difference in the effects of sociodemographic variables\nbetween including and not including information concerning ADL dynamics before\ndying. Our analyses are conducted within a comprehensive, multivariate framework\nfocusing on sociodemographic factors including age, gender, residential type, SES,\nmarital status, and living arrangement.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 5\n2. Data and methodology\nData is derived from the first three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy\ncounties/cities in 22 provinces of China. The survey was initiated to meet the needs for\nscientific research on the oldest-old, a sub-population about which we know very little\nbut that is growing at extraordinary speed and needs the most help. The survey staff\noctogenarians. In the second wave in 2000, out of the 8,959 baseline interviewees,\nrobust results, as has been done in some previous studies (e.g., Crimmins et al. 1994),\nall three waves of data are pooled together in this study. As a result of the pooling, we\ndeal with the number of observations/cases rather than the number of interviewees in\nthis study. Each interviewee has at least two but at most three observations. Time 1\nrefers to the start-point of each two-year interval in which a dynamics of disability may\noccur, whereas Time 2 refers to the endpoint of each two-year interval. In other words,\nthe interview time in 2000 or 2002. Furthermore, as has been done in previous studies\nTime 1 are excluded from this study due to insufficient information for us to validate\ntheir reported extremely high age. The total number of observations included in this\nExtensive questionnaire data was collected in the CLHLS including demographic\ncharacteristics, family and households characteristics, life styles, diet, psychological\ncharacteristics, economic resources, family support, self-reported health, self-reported\nlife satisfaction, lower and upper extremities performance, ADLs (Katz et al. 1963), the\nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, Folstein, Folsein, and McHugh 1975), and\nchronic diseases suffered and their adverse impacts on daily life. All information was\nobtained through in-home interviews. Interviews were conducted with the subjects\nthemselves, if possible. If the subject was unable to answer the questions, the interview\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n6 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwas conducted with a proxy respondent. This is the first nation-wide longitudinal\nsurvey research project with such a large sample size on the oldest-old ever conducted\nin a developing country. A detailed description about the sampling design and data\nquality assessment of the CLHLS can be found elsewhere (Zeng et al. 2001; 2002; Gu\nComprehensive information concerning the date of death, cause of death, ADL\nstatus and days of ADL disability before death, days of being bedridden before death,\nnumber of episodes of suffering from serious diseases (including length of hospital\nstay) from last interview to death, what kind of diseases were suffered before death,\nwhether adequate medical treatment was received when suffering disease, how many\ndays before death the elder did not go out of doors, how many days before death the\namount of time in bed was longer than that out of bed, and sociodemographic\ncharacteristics such as marital status, family income, living arrangement before dying\nwere also obtained from the next-of-kin of those interviewees who died prior to the next\nwave.\nThe CLHLS datasets used in this study have two unique and important features.\nFirst, the CLHLS collected the information before dying from the next-of-kin for those\ndecedents who died before the subsequent interview. Second, this study contains a total\nSuch a large sample size makes these datasets more reliable for studying the oldest-old\npopulation.\n2.2 Measuring the onset and recovery of ADL disability\nActivity of daily living (ADL) refers to basic personal care tasks of every day life. As is\nconsistent with previous studies (e.g., Beckett et al. 1996; Mendes de Leon, Glass,\nBeckett et al. 1999; Mendes de Leon, Gold, Glass et al. 2001), task-specific disability is\ndefined as the inability to perform a task independently, without help from a person or\nspecific equipment or a device. Previous studies have also shown self-reported ADL\ndisability to be a valid measure (Weinberger et al. 1992), and Katz's scale is the most\noften used measure of functional disability (Wiener et al. 1990). Therefore, in this\narticle, ADL disability is defined as self-reported difficulty with any following ADLs\nitems: (a) bathing, (b) dressing, (c) eating, (d) indoor transferring, (e) toileting, and (f)\ncontinence (Note 3). To avoid problems of complications and small sub-sample sizes in\nmodel estimation, we simply dichotomized the ADL functional capacity into \"active\"\n(no ADL limitation) and \"disabled\" (at least one ADL limitation). An individual is\nconsidered having an \"onset\" of ADL disability if he/she moved from no ADL\nlimitation at Time 1 to at least one ADL limitation at Time 2 or before dying. A person\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 7\nis classified as having a \"recovery\" from ADL disability if he/she moved from at least\none ADL limitation at Time 1 to no ADL limitation at Time 2 or before dying (see Note\n4 for the definition of ADL status before dying). Such dichotomous classification\nincludes 2 x 2 = 4 sets of rates of functional transition and remaining, which enables us\nto clearly focus on the onset and recovery of disability although it loses some\ninformation about the ADL functional gradations of deterioration/improvement. If, for\nexample, three ADL categories are adopted, we would have to deal with 3 x 3 = 9 sets\nof functional transitions and remaining, which largely complicates the models and\ninterpretations and causes problems of small sample sizes. The strategy of such\ndichotomous classification has also been adopted in previous studies (e.g., Land et al.\n2.3 Accuracy and reliability of ADL disability\nThe reliability of self-reported ADLs has been shown to be high and to be unaffected by\nage or cognitive status (e.g., Smith et al. 1990). The validity of self-reported ADL has\nbeen affirmed by several studies that have demonstrated high concordance between\nrespondents and proxies (Magaziner et al. 1996).\nThe reliability coefficients of ADL (Note 5) in the CLHLS and some selected\nstudies are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix. The value of Cronbach alpha in the\nCLHLS is close to or higher than that of some studies conducted in the USA (e.g.,\ncoefficients are all above 0.7, the lowest criterion for group comparisons suggested by\nprevious studies (Nunnally 1994; Stewart, Hays, and Ware 1992). Therefore, we are\nconfident about the high data quality for ADL disability in the CLHLS.\n2.4 Sociodemographic factors\nAge, sex, current residence, ethnic group, SES in terms of education, economic\nindependence, adequate financial resources, primary lifetime occupation, marital status,\nand living arrangement are the sociodemographic variables that we expected to be\nassociated with the dynamics of ADL statuses in this study. All these factors were\nmeasured at Time 1.\nThe sample is divided into two ethnic groups: Han and minorities. Current\nresidence is classified into urban and rural (Statistical Bureau of China 1993). For\nclassifying educational attainment, we use reported years of schooling and merge them\ninto two levels: 0 years (illiteracy) and one or more years of schooling because the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n8 http://www.demographic-research.org\ngeneral education level of the Chinese oldest-old is extremely low and other alternative\ncoding did not improve the estimates. Although the cash or asset amount income of the\noldest-old was unavailable, the main income source information was collected. We\nclassify such sources into two categories: economic independence, namely, relying\nmainly on pension or one's own financial source, and economic dependence, namely,\nrelying mainly on spouse, children or other family members, government subsidy or\nother sources. And we also use another variable to measure whether the monetary\nsources are adequate to maintain the daily costs of the elderly. These two variables are a\nproxy of economic conditions in our study. Primary lifetime occupation of males is\nclassified into two categories: agriculture and non-agriculture, whereas it is grouped\ninto three categories for females: agriculture, housewife, and non-agriculture. Marital\nstatus has two categories: currently not married (including never married, divorced, and\nwidowed) and currently married. Living arrangement is classified into living alone and\nnot-living-alone. The distribution of above variables is listed in Table 1.\n2.5 Control variables\nTo reduce the possibility of spurious associations, we select a set of control variables\nfor the analysis guided by previous research in this area (e.g., Boult et al. 1994;\nThere is reliable evidence to substantiate that the quality and nature of family and\nsocial support/connections have a measurable influence on functional disability\nreligious activities, proximity with children, playing cards, and who takes care of the\nelder in the daily life are considered as the proxy of family and social\nsupport/connections.\nIt has also been well documented that sociodemographic differences in functional\nstatus are mediated by factors of health practice such as alcohol consumption, smoking,\ndiet, exercise (Hubert et al. 2002; LaCroix et al. 1993), and other health related\nvariables such as cognitive function (Gill et al. 1997), self-reported health (Goldman et\nconditions (see Note 2) are strongly related to an individual's ability to carry out\nactivities of daily living (Guralnik et al. 1993; Femia et al.1997). Hearing impairment\nand visual impairment are also associated with disability (e.g., Gill et al. 1997). The\nlower and upper extremities are associated with functional dynamics, as well (Guralnik\nVariability in the survival time interval between observation points for individuals\nrequires us to add the length of the observation interval into model (Note 6). Whether\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 9\nthe respondents died or survived up to the next observation point was also included in\nthe model as a dummy variable since the dynamics patterns of disability between\nsurvivors and the decedents are largely different (e.g., Melzer et al. 2001).\nThe presence or absence of these factors may facilitate or impede ADL decline or\nrecovery. Neglect of the above potential confounders may lead to biases in investigating\nthe effect of sociodemographic factors on the prevalence and dynamics of disability.\nTherefore, the results are more scientific and more statistically powerful if we add such\nvariables into model as controls (Note 7).\n2.6 Analytic strategies\nFindings from recent studies show that mortality levels off at very high ages (e.g.,\n20% of centenarians could avoid diseases except osteroarthritis (Evert et al. 2003). This\nraises our concerns that the age effect on disability dynamics may be different among\noctogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians. Another fact is that Macintyre and\ncolleagues (1996) show that gender differences in health vary according to the life\ncourse stage. It is necessary to conduct studies of different age groups, rather than\nassume that the same relationships remain constant throughout the life course (Arber\nand Cooper 1999). Therefore, unlike most previous studies, which took age covariates\nin a multivariate model in analyzing disability, we run models separately for\noctogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians. It has become commonplace to analyze\nmen and women separately in examining gender differences in the magnitude of the\nrelationships between socio-economic characteristics and health (Arber and Cooper\n1999:62), since men and women have different lifestyles, family and social roles, health\nand disablement outcome (Lamb 1997). Thus, we run models for males and females\nseparately.\nPrevious studies have also suggested that different functional status trajectories\nmay exist based on age, gender and other sociodemographic variables (Maddox and\nClark, 1992, Wolinsky et al. 1996), the model would be more powerful if interactions\nbetween covariates were added to the model. All possible 44 two-way interactions were\ntested at the presence of their parent terms and all other sociodemographic variables\nused in this study were tested by gender among octogenarians, nonagenarians, and\ncentenarians separately. It turns out that only the interaction between years of schooling\nand urban/rural residence among male nonagenarians and the interaction between\neconomic independence and having adequate financial resources among female\nnonagenarians are significant. Moreover, coefficients of the main effects of variables in\nmodels among male nonagenarians and among female nonagenarians with such\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n10 http://www.demographic-research.org\nsignificant interactions are almost identical to those without such interactions.\nTherefore, no interaction term was included in the final models of our analysis.\nTo reduce the influence of the number of respondents who were lost to follow-up\nor of the missing value of some variables on data analysis and inference, the multiple\nimputation approach was applied in this study (Allison 2002). Two types of models\nwere constructed to examine how adding controlling variables may influence the\nestimates of the effects of sociodemographic factors on disability dynamics. The first\ntype, the \"sociodemographic model\", contains only sociodemographic factors, while the\nsecond type, the \"full model\", contains both sociodemographic factors and the other\ncontrol variables mentioned above.\nThe random effect logit model is employed to run all models using STATA\nversion 8 (STATA 2003) after correcting intra-subject correlation due to some subjects'\ncontributing two observations to the pooled data set at a specific time (Time 1 or Time\n3. Results\n3.1 Descriptive information of sociodemographic variables and ADL dynamic\nchanges\nTable 1 provides descriptive information about percentage distributions of\nsociodemographic variables used in this study. The prevalence rates of ADL disability\nare 17% and 21% for male oldest-old and female oldest-old, respectively (Note 9). The\nprevalence rate increases steeply with advancing age. Those who live in urban areas\nhave a higher prevalence rate, as compared with those living in rural areas. Minority\nethnic oldest-old have a lower prevalence rate of disability than do their Han\ncounterparts. Persons with low education or who are not currently married have higher\nprevalence rates. Those living alone suffer less from limitations of daily functioning\nthan do those living with others.\nTable 2 shows that for the whole oldest-old population in China, 22% of males and\nnearly 25% of females who were ADL active at Time 1 developed disability within the\nsubsequent two years, whereas 35 % of males and 31% of females who were disabled at\nTime 1 regained their functioning in the following two-year interval. Females have a\nhigher onset rate and lower recovery rate. The onset rate of disability of centenarians is\ntwo times higher than that of octogenarians, whereas their recovery rate is two times\nlower than that of octogenarians. For those who died before Time 2, their onset rate is 4\ntimes higher than those surviving to Time 2. The bivariate differences of the rates of\ndisability onset and recovery of different sociodemographic groups without adjusting\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 11\nfor any other confounding factors are also listed in Table 2. We do not discuss these\nbivariate cross-tabulations here since we will subsequently discuss the differentials\nacross sociodemographic groups while controlling for other confounding factors.\nTable 1: Percentage distributions of socio-demographic variables by gender\nMales Females\nVariables\n# of obs. % a % disabled b # of obs. % a % disabled b\nAge\nResidence\nEthnic group\nEconomic independence\nAdequate financial resources\nYears of schooling\nPrimary lifetime occupation\nMarital status\nCurrently without\nspouse\nCurrently with\nspouse\nLiving alone\nNote: (1) a, unweighted distribution; b weighted based on distribution of age-sex-urban/rural residence of whole population of the\noldest olds in sampled provinces at Time 1 except age weighted by distribution of age-sex-urban/rural residence within each\ncorresponding age group; NA, not applicable.

The effect of age on disability development is more substantial among\nfemales than among males. Moreover, such age patterns do not change very much even\nafter controlling for all other confounders although the odds ratios are lessened. This\nindicates that age is a strong predictor of the onset of disability.\nResults shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b indicate that, on average, female oldest-\nold are disadvantaged in ADL functioning, as compared with their male counterparts;\nthe gender difference in disability dynamics, however, doesn't follow the same pattern\namong octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians. In the full model, the gender\ndifference in disability dynamics is the largest among nonagenarians, indicating female\noldest-old in their nineties have a higher risk of experiencing the onset of disability on\naverage compared with male oldest-old. The gender difference is not significant among\noctogenarians and is marginally significant among centenarians.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 15\nMales Females Males Females\nOnset of disability Recovery from disability\nOdds ratios and 95%CI\nMales Females Males Females\nOnset of disability Recovery from disability\nOdds ratios and 95%CI\nFigure 1a: Age effect on dynamic changes of disability, Socio-demographic model\nFigure 1b: Age effect on dynamic changes of disability, Full model\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n16 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOnset of disability Recovery from disability\nOdds ratios and 95%CI\nO nset of disability Recovery from\ndisability\nOdds ratios and 95%CI\nFigure 2a: Gender effects on dynamic changes of disability, Socio-demgraphic\nmodel\nFigure 2b: Gender effects on dynamic changes of disability, Full model\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 17\nTable 3 illustrates the sociodemographic factors associated with the onset of\ndisability among octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians by gender,\nrespectively. Odds ratios were obtained for each factor among persons who were active\nat Time 1. The left panel of Table 3 presents results obtained from the\nsociodemographic models, whereas the right panel provides results produced from the\nfull models. The results in Table 3 show that the oldest-old have a higher probability of\ndeveloping disability as they live longer for both males and females, although the\nvariation of odds ratios in centenarians becomes wider. The significant difference\nbetween urban and rural residences in the onset of disability is observed among female\nelders aged 90 and over, while such a difference is not detected among male oldest-old.\nOn average, minority ethnicity has a lower risk of developing disability compared with\nHan. But the pattern of ethnic effect in disability onset between males and females is\ndifferent. For female oldest-old, ethnicity has a limited effect on disability development\nin the eighties, but it has a significant effect after age ninety, and the ethnic effect is\nstronger with the advancement of age. On the contrary, for male oldest-old, ethnicity\nhas the highest effect in the eighties and weakens thereafter. The disadvantage effect of\nno education can make persons at oldest-old ages face higher risks of experiencing a\ndisability, especially for males, although such disadvantages are reduced after adding\nother confounding factors into the model. Independence in financial resources reduces\nthe risk of developing disability especially among female nonagenarians. But this effect\nis not observed for males. Unexpectedly, adequacy in financial resources doesn't show\na beneficial effect on the onset of disability. In contrast, the results show that there is a\nnegative association between having adequate financial resources and the capacity of\ndaily functioning. Female oldest-old who were housewives have a higher risk of\ndeveloping disability at their oldest-old ages compared with those who worked as\nfarmers. Although the odds of risk to have an onset of disability among those who were\nnon-agricultural workers during their lifetime were higher than those who were farmers,\nthe estimates are not significant. The protective effect of marriage on developing\ndisability is very weak and is observed only among male nonagenarians without\ncontrolling confounders. The results show that married females over age 90 have a\nhigher likelihood to suffer ADL disability than their unmarried counterparts. Those\nliving alone have a lower risk of experiencing a disability over a two-year interval than\nthose living with others among male oldest-old. This effect is not found in females. The\nright panel of Table 3 suggests that the sociodemographic effects on disability\ndevelopment were not affected much by adding the confounding factors of family and\nsocial supports/connections, health practice and chronic conditions into the model.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n18 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Odds ratios of the onset of ADL disability by socio-demographic\nvariables\nSocio-demographic variables only Full model\nMales\nFemales\nPrimary lifetime occupation before age 60\nNotes: (1) Reference group of each covariate is listed in parentheses.

This implies that age is strongly correlated with\nrecovering from disability. But unlike its effects on the onset of disability, the\nmagnitude of the age effect on recovering from disability among females is close to\nthose among males. In general, females have a lower likelihood of regaining their daily\nfunctioning once they have become disabled as compared with their male peers. The\ngender difference is not significantly detected among octogenarians, while the gender\ndifferential effect is the biggest among nonagenarians.\nResults summarized in Table 4 show that although the probabilities of moving\nfrom disabled status to active status decrease with age, the effect of increasing age on\ndisability recovery is different among octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians.\nThe age effect is weaker with the advancement of the age group, especially for males.\nUrban oldest-old have a lower likelihood of recovering once they have become disabled\ncompared with their rural peers. More interestingly, such urban-rural residential effects\nbecome stronger with the advancement of age groups among both males and females.\nThose minority ethnic oldest-old have a higher chance of recovering from disability as\ncompared with those of Han oldest-old. Among male oldest-old, the ethnic effect\nweakens with the increase of age, whereas the patterns for females are the opposite.\nAlthough illiterate oldest-old have a disadvantage in maintaining their daily\nfunctioning, they don't have a disadvantage in recovering once they have become\ndisabled; they have a higher chance of recovering even than literate persons, especially\namong people aged 90 and over. Economic independence and adequate financial\nresources does not improve the likelihood of recovering from a disability in our study.\nFemale oldest-old whose primary lifetime occupations were housewives are less likely\nto regain their daily functioning if they lost such functioning as compared with farmers.\nThe difference in disability recovery between lifetime farmers and non-farmers is small.\nThe beneficial effect of marriage is observed only among female octogenarians,\nimplying that the marriage protective effect in very old ages is limited. For males, the\nodds ratios of recovering from disability among those living alone are around 2-3 across\nthree age groups as compared with those not living alone, and they are significant\nexcept for centenarians in the sociodemographic model. For females, these odds are\naround 1.1-1.3 and are not significant. This suggests that the effect of living alone on\nthe dynamic changes of disability is stronger in males than in females. Results in Table\n4 also show that the effects of sociodemographic factors on recovery only had a slight\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n20 http://www.demographic-research.org\nchange after controlling possible confounding, implying that the estimates of the\nsociodemographic effects are valid.\nTable 4: Odds ratios of the recovery from ADL disability by socio-demographic\nvariables\nSocio-demographic variables only Full model\nMales\nFemales\nPrimary lifetime occupation before age 60\nNotes: (1) Reference group of each covariate is listed in parentheses.

The results suggest that\nthe effect of age on disability onset is higher in the models not including ADL dynamic\nchanges of the deceased persons before dying as compared with models including ADL\ndynamic changes before dying. The effect of age on disability recovery in the\nconventional approach without information of ADL changes before dying is lower than\nthat in models including ADL transition before dying (Note 11). The conventional\napproach overestimated the age effect on disability dynamics. This is because the\ndifference in ADL dynamics across ages for survivors is larger than that for the\ndeceased persons. Our multivariate analyses based on the full model show that the odds\nratios of having an onset of disability across three age groups with age 80-89 as the\namong the deceased male oldest-old. Correspondingly, the odds ratios of recovering\ndeceased males (Note 12). Similar patterns of age differential effects between survivors\nand deceased persons among females are also found.\nFurthermore, the conventional method overestimates the gender difference in\ndisability dynamics. The odds ratios of the onset of disability and the recovery from\ndisability between genders with males as the reference group in the full models\nrespectively. The corresponding figures in the full model not including ADL changes\ngender difference in ADL dynamics is large among survivors while it is small among\ndeceased persons. The gender odd ratios with males as the reference for transition from\nactive to disabled and transition from disabled to active among survivors are 1.18\noverestimates the effects of ethnicity and living alone on disability dynamics. On the\ncontrary, the conventional method underestimates the effect of SES, although the\nunderestimation is small. Differences in the effects of marital status and urban/rural\nresidence between the two methods are trivial, however.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n22 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOdd ratios and 95%CI\nIncluding\nNot including\nOdd ratios and 95%CI\nIncluding\nNot including\nFigure 3a: Comparison of odds ratios between models including and not including\nADL disability transitions before dying, from active to disabled, Full\nModel, Males\nFigure 3b: Comparison of odds ratios between models including and not including\nADL disability transitions before dying, from disabled to active, Full\nModel, Males\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 23\nOdd ratios and 95%CI\nIncluding\nNot including\nIncluding\nNot including\nFigure 3c: Comparison of odds ratios between models including and not including\nADL disability transitions before dying, from active to disabled, Full\nModel, Females\nFigure 3d: Comparison of odds ratios between models including and not\nincluding ADL disability transitions before dying, from disabled to\nactive, Full Model, Females\nNote: NON-nonagenarians vs. octogenarians; CEN-centenarians vs. octogenarians; UB-urban vs. rural; MI-minority vs. Han; EDU-\nno schooling vs. 1+ schooling; EI-economic independence vs. dependence; AFR- adequate financial resources yes vs. no\nadequate financial resources; HW-housewife vs. agriculture; NA-non-agriculture vs. agriculture; MA-currently married vs. not\nmarried; LA-living alone vs. not-living alone\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n24 http://www.demographic-research.org\n4. Discussion\nThis study is innovative in its development of a measurement and model that include\nchange of functional status before dying and incorporate basic sociodemographic\nfactors under a more comprehensively multivariate framework. Our innovation has\nimportant potential implications both theoretically and practically. Our results based on\nthe CLHLS data point out that the general patterns of sociodemographic effects on\ndisability dynamics in the conventional method, which excludes the information of\nADL changes before dying, is similar to those in our model including ADL changes\nbefore dying. The conventional method, however, overestimates the influences of age,\ngender, ethnicity, and living alone on disability transitions whereas it somewhat\nunderestimates the effects of SES. This is mainly because of the difference in patterns\nof disability dynamics between survivors and the deceased persons. The level of\nmortality also plays a critical role. If the mortality rate is very low, it will offset the\ndifference between these two methods even though the difference in ADL dynamics\nbetween survivors and the deceased persons is substantial. On the other hand, if\nmortality rate is relatively high, the difference could be large, indicating that including\nADL transition before death is much more meaningful in aging studies, especially in\nthe studies of the oldest-old, given that they have relatively high mortality rates. It is\nworthwhile to note that small discrepancies in effects (e.g., odds ratios) of\nsociodemographic factors on ADL dynamics between these two methods could lead to\nsignificant biases in the estimation of disabled life expectancy, as reported by Zeng et\nal. (2004). Although overestimation and underestimation of sociodemographic factors\non ADL dynamics caused by the conventional method revealed in the present study\nmight not have general applicability and far from conclusive, our finding indicates that\nit would be helpful to better understand the correlations between sociodemographic\nfactors and the dynamics of disability if ADL dynamic information between survey\nintervals among both surviving and deceased interviewees was collected.\nstudy shows that the prevalence rates of ADL disability among Chinese oldest-old are\n17% and 21% for males and females, respectively, and increase steeply with the\nadvancement of age. Over a two-year interval, more than 20% of the oldest-old\ndeveloped an onset of disability among those who were active at the starting of the\ninterval, while about 30% of the oldest-old who were disabled at the starting of the\ninterval regained their daily functioning. Compared with some of previous studies the\nrecovery rate in present study is somewhat higher. For example, Gill et al. (1997) find\nthat the recovery rate was 28% for aged 70 and older, while some others find that the\nCorder, and Stallard 1993) among elderly aged 65 and over. The main possible reason\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 25\nis that mortality rates were higher in China, which may make the Chinese oldest-old\nmore robust compared with their counterparts in the Western nations. Actually, as\npointed by one recent study (Hardy and Gill 2004), the recovery from disability might\nbe considerably more common than what previous studies have documented. They find\nthat among the respondents aged 70 and older the majority ever got recovered and more\nthan half maintained independently for more than six months within 12 months from\ntheir initial disability. Thus, we believe that the slightly higher recovery rate from\ndisability in this study compared with most of previous study may represent a spot or a\npart of a sector scattered on the full spectrum of dynamics of the disability among the\nelderly. The outcome in the present study suggests that the oldest-old are a frail group\nof people on average, on one hand. On the other hand, a sizeable number of the oldest-\nold, once disabled, would get recovery from disability. Such figures provide evidence to\nsupport the idea that recovering is almost as common as the onset of disability (Clark,\nStump, and Hui 1998), and disability among older persons and even oldest-old persons\nis a highly dynamicprocess and is not an irreversible but often recurrent event (Gill and\nOur results show that age is strongly linked to disability dynamics. Increasing age\nincreases the chances of moving from active to disabled status, and decreases the\nchance that the disabled individuals will recover to active status. This reaffirms most\nothers' reports (e.g., Crimmins et al. 1996; Hayward et al. 1998; Laditka and Wolf\n1998; Rogers et al. 1992). One of the most striking findings in the relation between age\nand disability dynamics is that for males after age 90 and for females after age 100, an\nadditional year of age will not deteriorate the chance to recover. Although we didn't\nfocus on the leveling off of disability in the present study and it deserves further\nresearch, our result provides some evidence that the disability trajectory is decelerating\nat very old ages. This also provides supportive evidence to the argument that older age,\nper se, may not impede recovery but, rather, may act as a proxy for other unmeasured\nfactors, which in turn decrease the capacity of disabled persons to recover (Gill et al.\nAlthough there is growing evidence to challenge the hypothesis that women have\npoor self-reported health, most studies still show that women have a lower level of\nfunctioning (Arber and Cooper 1999; Zimmer et al. 2002). In accordance with other\nstudies (e.g., Crimmins et al. 1996; Fuchs, Blumstein, Novikov et al. 1998; Hayward et\nal. 1998; Land et al., 1994), our finding shows that males have a lower probability of\ndeveloping disability and a higher probability to recover, suggesting that oldest-old\nwomen are significantly disadvantaged. The gender difference in our study, however,\ndoesn't follow the same pattern among octogenarians, nonagenarians, and centenarians.\nThe biggest gender differential effect is found among nonagenarians, and it is not\nsignificant among octogenarians. Such insignificance is possibly due to the length of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n26 http://www.demographic-research.org\nthe assessment interval. Hebert et al. (1999) also reported that the interval between\nsurveys could affect the gender difference in functional decline or improvement. This\ngender pattern needs further investigation.\nThe rural and urban difference is less salient in developed countries than in\ndeveloping countries. Hence, few studies are available to date to examine the\nurban/rural residential relations with disability. The majority of these studies focus\nmainly on cross-sectional analysis and the results are not consistent (e.g., Barberger-\nMainous and Kohers (1995) find that rural elders have a higher disability prevalence\nrate, and this finding is confirmed by Gupta and Sankar (2003). On the other hand,\nsome studies find that there is no significant association between urban/rural residence\nand disability (Barberger-Gateau et al. 1992). In our study, urban oldest-old exhibited a\nhigher probability to have the onset of disability and lower probability to recover than\ntheir rural counterparts. (No significant residential difference in the onset of disability\nwas found among male oldest-old.) The potential explanations for such urban-rural\npatterns in China are (1) the harder life and higher mortality at younger ages in rural\nareas results in rural oldest-old being more selected than urban oldest-old; (2) less\navailability of facilities to assist oldest-old persons in their daily life in rural areas may\nforce them to perform daily life and thus they are enabled to maintain functioning; (3)\nthe frequency of daily activities performed by urban oldest-old is less than that of rural\noldest-old due to housing structure differences; (4) rural people reside in a more\nhealthful physical environment than do those in urban areas (Zeng et al. 2001). The first\ntwo explanations may also help us to understand the fact that the elderly in some\ndeveloping countries are more active than the elderly in developed countries (Chen and\nAlthough most previous studies in the U.S. have shown that minority ethnic\ngroups' functional capacity is at lower levels, on average, than that of the majority (e.g.,\nKington 1997), several recent studies find that there is a disability crossover at the\noldest-old ages between ethnicities (e.g., Johnson 2000), suggesting that minorities\nhave better ADL functioning at the oldest-old ages. Our study shows that minority\nethnic oldest-old in China have a lower chance to develop disability and higher\nprobability to recover if they were disabled. This is consistent with Johnson (2000) who\nfinds Blacks (a minority) have better ADL functioning than Whites (the majority) at the\noldest-old ages. Zimmer and colleagues (2002) also found that those Mainlanders in\nTaiwan (most of which are Han Chinese) have higher functional limitations as\ncompared with minorities in Taiwan. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the\nethnicity differences in disability dynamics in this study among males and females are\nalso different. The patterns of the ethnic difference in disability dynamics across ages\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 27\namong males are weaker with the increasing age, while the patterns for females are the\nopposite. This is a new finding but it deserves further research. Some previous research\nhas attributed race/ethnic differences in disability to the low SES of minorities (e.g.,\nBoult et al. 1994). But it is not clear whether the ethnic difference between Chinese Han\nand minorities is due mainly to mortality selection or other unobserved heterogeneities.\nMore elucidation on this topic could provide a better understanding of ethnic\ndifferences in disability dynamics.\nMost previous studies in western societies, which dealt with the entire elderly\npopulation aged 65+ and did not have a large sub-sample size for the oldest-old as we\nhave, have found that education has a protective effect on disability in old ages\non the oldest-old in China with a large sample size, has found that education is not\nstrongly associated with the dynamics of disability among Chinese oldest-old. This is\npartially in line with findings in Taiwan (Zimmer et al. 1998; Lee and Chuang 2003)\nand Japan (Liu et al. 1995). All three studies have found that education could decrease\nthe likelihood of the onset of ADL disability but has no significant protective effect on\neducation on transitions of ADL disability involves a complicated framework including\ncultural background given that Mainland China has a similar cultural background as\nTaiwan. The dissimilarity of the effect of education on the onset of ADL disability\nbetween the present study and those in Taiwan and Japan might also be because of\ndifferences in the age range of subjects and the length of the observation interval. Like\nmost western studies, all three studies in Taiwan and Japan dealt with the entire elderly\npopulation aged 65+ and didn't focus on the oldest old. The observation intervals of\nthese three studies are three-year (Liu et al. 1995), four-year (Zimmer et al. 1998), and\nseven-year (Lee and Chuang 2003). The mechanism of the relationship between\neducation and function at oldest-old ages in China deserves further investigation.\nWith advancement of age, the income of the elderly declines, while at the same\ntime the elders have a greater likelihood of disability (Ginn and Arber 1991). The poor\nelders do not have adequate financial resources to compensate for their disabilities. This\nleads people to speculate that elders with better economic conditions should be\nhealthier. Unexpectedly, however, economic conditions in late life were not significant\nfactors to retard the development of disability and reduce the risk of maintaining\ndisability in our analyses on Chinese oldest-old. Although this finding provides\nadditional evidence to support the results reported by Ginn and Arber (1991), it differs\nfrom most others that do not focus on the oldest-old (e.g., Maddox and Clark 1992;\nwould help to shed further light on the association of economic status with disability\ndynamics at oldest-old ages.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n28 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIt is noteworthy that those female oldest-old who were housewives in their lifetime\nexperienced a higher risk of the onset of disability and a lower likelihood of regaining\nfunctioning as compared with farmers. This may be because farmers usually start to\nwork during childhood and often continue to work well beyond the age of 65 and such\nlabor activities serve as physical exercise, which may make them more active than\nhousewives. On the other hand, the proportion of housewives who do exercises is very\nlow, which makes them have a lower functioning as compared with farmers. Another\npossible explanation is that the majority (2/3) of previous farmers still reside in rural\nareas, and the rural environment has also made them relatively abler in daily life\nactivities, as we discussed earlier in explaining the urban/rural residential differentials.\nIt is commonly stated that marriage demonstrates a beneficial effect on functional\ncapacity (e.g., House, Landis, and Umberson 1988). Marriage provides individuals with\na sense of meaning and importance that promotes health (Rogers et al., 1992). Although\nmarriage provides health benefits for both husbands and wives, marriage confers a\ngreater health benefit upon husbands than upon wives because wives often monitor\ntheir husband's health, but husbands usually do not provide the same service to their\nof marriage is not fully replicated in this study. We find that marriage doesn't have a\nsignificantly protective effect on disability dynamic transitions, indicating that the\nprotective effect of marriage on disability dynamics is limited, or weak in the oldest-old\nages in the two-year interval (Note 13). We offer the following explanations for this\nfinding. First, mortality selection makes those not married and frail individuals drop out\nbefore they reach oldest-old ages; In other words, the currently not married oldest-old\nare possibly at least as robust in ADL functioning as the married oldest old. Second, we\ndidn't examine the quality of marriage, remarriage, the length of marriage, and recent\nchanges in marital status on disability dynamics in the present study. These factors\nprobably affect the results. Third, the observation interval may not be enough for us to\ndetect such effects at the oldest-old ages. Fourth, at oldest-old ages, factors other than\nmarital status may have a stronger influence on disability, such as chronic disease\nconditions or genetic factors. Further research on the marital effect on disability is\nwarranted.\nAn increasing strand of research has demonstrated that living arrangement may\nexert an effect on health (Grundy 2001; Hebert et al. 1999). Our findings show that\nliving arrangement does have significant effects on the dynamic changes of disability\namong male oldest-old, reaffirming other studies that do not focus on the oldest-old\n(e.g., Hebert et al. 1999). In our sample, compared with those living in other settings,\nthose living alone are more independent in daily activities and have a higher chance of\nregaining their daily functioning once they have become disabled. Furthermore, our\nstudy reveals that the effect of living alone is smaller among female oldest-old than\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 29\namong male oldest-old. There are two-way causalities: living alone leads to good\nfunctioning, or vice versa. Hebert et al. (1999) interpreted that living alone could act as\na proxy for good health at very old ages rather than as a risk factor. Although this could\npartially explain our result, we argue that in the Chinese cultural context, living alone\nmight also lead to good functioning. This is because most of those oldest-old who live\nalone don't have children or have low proximity with children. They have to live alone,\nwhich forces them to do daily tasks by themselves and maintain their functioning well.\nUnlike most of other studies, our study focuses on the oldest-old who need much\nmore care than others, but about whom we know very little. The data set includes a\nlarge simple size, and is the first, largest longitudinal survey for the oldest-old in\ndeveloping countries. Although there are a considerable number of studies focusing on\nfunctional ability among nonagenarians and centenarians (e.g., Andersen-Ranberg et al.\n1999; Nybo et al. 2001), the sociodemographic effects on dynamic changes in disability\nhave still not been fully examined. The large sample size among octogenarians,\nnonagenarians, and centenarians enables us to examine the effects of sociodemographic\nfactors on the onset of or recovery from disability separately in this study under the\ncontrol of various confounding effects. The results of this study provide new knowledge\nabout the general patterns of disability dynamics of the oldest-old in developing\ncountries, and make comparison with those in developed countries possible. Our\nfinding contributes to a better understanding of some of the social and demographic\nfactors associated with transitions between disabled and active statuses. Our analysis\nhas illustrated which sociodemographic factors are the most important ones in reducing\ntransitions to disability, and in increasing the rate of recovery.\nOne limitation of the present study is that information on ADL status before dying\nfor deceased persons between the two waves is obtained from proxy, which may\ninvolve some bias, although previous studies reveal that the use of proxy responses\nfrom family members is appropriate in quality of dying research (George 2002). And\nwe collected only one episode of data about ADL dynamics before dying, which may\nalso suffer some limitations. How to get the more accurate information of ADL\ndynamics over a survey interval without increasing the frequency of surveying is still a\nchallenge for epidemological study. Another limitation of the present study is that\ninformation was not available on whether participants sought or received special\ntreatments after the onset of their disability. Therefore, we could not evaluate (or adjust\nfor) the effect of these rehabilitative efforts on the likelihood of ADL recovery.\nIn short, the present study shows that sociodemographic factors seem to play some\nspecific roles in disability dynamics even after controlling for a variety of confounders.\nIt is worth noting that the relationships between sociodemographic factors and disability\ndynamics are much more complex and far from conclusive. We are fully aware that not\nonly will diversity of conceptual measures of functioning and the interval between\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 1\n30 http://www.demographic-research.org\nevaluations result in different answers (Hebert et al. 1999), but also the analytical\nstrategies will produce different pictures, as well. One of our purposes is to draw\nattention to the underestimation of disability in the existing literature. Although we\nhave included ADL dynamics information before dying, the answer is far beyond\nsatisfied given that we lack full information concerning ADL transitions between\nassessments. There is still a long way to go to capture the whole picture of ADL\ndynamics. Given the current projections that the number of Chinese oldest-old could be\nresearch on the mechanisms of ADL disability and recovery in the oldest-old\npopulation is clearly warranted.\n5. "
