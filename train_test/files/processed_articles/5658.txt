Our aim is to suggest how sociology and social sciences may respond to the challenges\nand opportunities presented by this `data deluge' in ways that are innovative yet sensitive to the social and ethical life of\ndata and methods. We begin by reviewing relevant contemporary methodological debates and consider how they relate\nto the emergence of big and broad social data as a product, reflexive artefact and organizational feature of emerging\nglobal digital society. We then explore the challenges and opportunities afforded to social science through the wide-\nspread adoption of a new generation of distributed, digital technologies and the gathering momentum of the open data\nmovement, grounding our observations in the work of the Collaborative Online Social Media ObServatory (COSMOS)\nproject. In conclusion, we argue that these challenges and opportunities motivate a renewed interest in the programme\nfor a `public sociology', characterized by the co-production of social scientific knowledge involving a broad range of\nactors and publics.\n",

We explore the challenges presented to\nsociology and the social sciences in general as a conse-\nquence of the rise of commercial transactional data and\nthe opportunities afforded by big and broad, publically\navailable social media data for sociological and social\nscientific enquiry in the digital age. A key organizing\nprinciple here is the idea of collaborative observation.\nWe frame these opportunities and challenges within the\ncontext of calls for a `public sociology' (see Burawoy,\n2005), whose aim is to establish a dialogue with a broad\narray of audiences beyond the academy and transform\nsociological practice. This dialogue requires an infra-\nstructure for communication and collaboration to sus-\ntain it. As a contribution towards this, we present\nCOSMOS, an open platform for social data analysis.\nBuilding and applying COSMOS necessitates engaging\nconstructively with the `computational turn' in soci-\nology (also known as computational social science:\nfor a critique, see Boyd and Crawford, 2012).\nCOSMOS reflects how processes of social scientific\nknowledge production are adapting to meet the\n1Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK\n2Warwick University, Coventry, UK\n3St Andrews University, Fife, UK\n4Manchester University, Manchester, UK\nCorresponding author:\nRob Procter, Warwick University, Gibbet Hill, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.\nEmail: Rob.Procter@warwick.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/\nopenaccess.htm).\nchallenges and opportunities offered by new forms of\nsocial data. Of potentially even greater significance, we\nargue, is how COSMOS may contribute to the pro-\ngramme for a public sociology by providing a vehicle\nfor the involvement of a broad array of publics in the\nco-production of social scientific knowledge.\nTheoretical and methodological context\nIt is important to couch these challenges and opportu-\nnities within contemporary social thought. Many of\nthese have been framed within the context of global\ncomplexity, mobilities and information flow (Urry,\n2003), the rise of the networked society (Castells,\n2011) and the consequential and constitutive effects of\n`big and broad' social data upon social formations and\nrelations (Ruppert et al., 2013). These represent pro-\nfound questions for sociology as a viable empirical dis-\ncipline that is able to speak truth to power while, at the\nsame time, affording opportunities for innovation and\nre-invigoration in terms of theory, method, data and its\nrelationship to society beyond the academy. The scale,\ncomplexity and speed of these transformations demand\nan interdisciplinary response, but they also speak to\ncore sociological concerns that relate to classic ques-\ntions of social organization, social change, and the inte-\ngration and regulation of citizens within complex, late\nmodern, globalizing, and interconnected social forma-\ntions. However, these transformations raise questions\nabout the capacity of academic social science to scope\nand make sense of them in comparison to other agents\nand institutions, where `scoping the social' through\naccess to `big and broad' social data can help to realize\ncompetitive or strategic advantage for states, multi-\nnationals, and other agencies in the `global race' in a\n`runaway world' (Archibugi et al., 1998; Giddens,\n2002). Furthermore, the theoretical consequences for\nreflexive modernization (Beck, 1992), liquid modernity\n(Bauman, 2000) and late modern social formation\n(Giddens, 2002) require further consideration in the\nlight of the emerging contours of digital societies.\nHowever, for sociology, and social science more gen-\nerally, the present debate and response are centred on\nempirical concerns. The reasons for this can be under-\nstood to lie in the emergence of big and broad social data\nas a consequence of social and economic transformation\nrealized through the digital revolution and rise of net-\nworked societies. Digital societies are self-referential, in\nthe sense that they generate data as an accountable trace\nand functional pre-requisite for network and system\nintegration. Furthermore, this data provides a powerful\nmeans of understanding and scoping populations and\nsocial life on a massive scale. This represents a challenge\nand an opportunity for sociology that is suffused with\npolitical, ethical and empirical issues. While all these are\nsalient and mutually constitutive, it is questions of data\nand empirical enquiry that have brought these and\nrelated issues into sharp focus within sociology and the\nsocial sciences under the rubric of the `social life of meth-\n. . . we seek to unsettle debates about how the prolifer-\nation of the digital is implicated in large-scale social\nchange and remaking the governance and organization\nof contemporary sociality (for instance, Castells' [1996]\nnetwork society, or the notion of biopolitics . . . we are\nconcerned with the implications of digital devices and\ndata for reassembling social science methods or what\nwe call the social science apparatus. Here we build on\nour interest in elaborating the social life of\nmethods . . . through a specific concern with digital\ndevices as increasingly the very stuff of social life in\nmany locations that are reworking, mediating,\nmobilizing, materializing and intensifying social and\nother relations.\nIn their account of the `coming crisis of empirical soci-\nology', Savage and Burrows (2007) argue that, in pre-\nvious decades, social scientists were able to claim a\ndistinctive expertise in investigating social relations\nthrough such methodological innovations as the\nsample survey and the in-depth interview. Since the\nadvent of digital technologies, this claim has been com-\npromised by the proliferation of transactional data gen-\nerated, owned and increasingly analysed by large\ncommercial organizations, as well as government\ndepartments. The availability to commercial enterprises\nof large volumes of continuously updated data on, for\nexample, retail transactions, telephone communica-\ntions, financial expenditure and insurance claims\nmakes for an uncomfortable comparison with episod-\nically generated datasets such as the census of popula-\ntions,2 general household surveys, police recorded\ncrime, victim of crime surveys and labour market sur-\nveys on which academic sociology has traditionally\nrelied, and provokes an existential question: is aca-\ndemic sociology ``becoming less of an `obligatory\npoint of passage' for vast swathes of powerful agents. . .\nif so, how can the discipline best respond to this chal-\nabout the marginality of academic sociology need\nrevisiting in the light of the subsequent explosion of\nnew digital communications, such as social networking\nsites, the `blogosphere' and the increasing popularity of\nmicro-blogging, or, named after the most renowned\nmicro-blogging service, `tweeting'. Significantly, these\ntechnologies facilitate the mass communication and\nsharing of `user-generated content', and have given\nrise to a form of mass, self-reported data about their\nusers' daily routines, perceptions of, and sentiments\n2 Big Data & Society\nabout, particular events. Twitter users, for example,\npost more than 500 million tweets per day; Facebook\nusers post 9 million messages per hour.\nSocial and computational researchers have already\nbegun to mine and `repurpose' this naturally occurring,\nsocially relevant data in their `predictive' efforts.\nTumasjan et al. (2010) were able to measure Twitter\nsentiment in relation to candidates in the German gen-\neral election, concluding that this source of data was as\naccurate at predicting voting patterns as traditional\npolls. Again, mining the `Twittersphere', Asur and\nHuberman (2010) were successful in correlating the sen-\ntiment expressed about movies with their revenue,\nclaiming that this method of prediction was more\naccurate than the gold standard Hollywood Stock\nMarket. Beyond social networks, Ginsberg et al.\n(2009) successfully correlated flu-based search terms\nentered into the Google search engine with visits to\nthe local doctor to epidemiologically trace the spread\nof the disease across the USA.3 Another notable exam-\nple is the wealth of social media communications about\nmajor incidents of civil unrest, such as the `Arab\nand the riots in English cities during August 2011\nthe potential significance of social media technologies\nfor facilitating the harvesting and analysis of `naturally\noccurring' mediated data as contrasted with findings\nfrom experiments, surveys and in-depth interviews,\nwhich are necessarily the artefacts of social research\nmethods (Cicourel, 1964). However, this proliferation\nof `lively' social data poses a significant set of chal-\nlenges that are still being confronted. Savage (2013: 4)\nstates:\nMy argument is that the `Social Life of Methods' arises\nas part of a dual movement. These are, firstly, an\nincreasing inter-disciplinary interest in making methods\nan object of study . . . I explore how this current poses a\ntopical challenge to dominant instrumentalist readings\nof methods, which currently predominate in social sci-\nence research. The second aspect of this interest is,\nhowever, less commented on, but in my view equally\nimportant. This is the crisis, increasingly evident in the\n`research methods community' regarding positivist\nforms of knowledge, as forms of standardized data\nexceed the capacity of standard quantitative procedures\nto process and analyse them. The proliferation of\n`lively' data has created an emergent space in which\nthere is a dramatic potential to rethink our theoretical\nand methodological repertoires.\nAs academic researchers grapple with the methodo-\nlogical challenges posed by the growth of big and\nbroad social data, it is important to acknowledge that\nthese will not be resolved through internal dialogue\nalone. Big and broad social data raise significant ethical\nissues that demand an open debate with citizens about\nthe role and status of academic research and the\nrelationship between the academy and wider society.\nIn his invitation for a `public sociology', former\nPresident of the American Sociological Association\nMichael Burawoy identified the different ways in\nwhich social research is produced for and communi-\ncated to various publics, specifically students, policy-\nmakers and the broader citizenry (Burawoy, 2005).\nFor Burawoy, a truly public sociology is one that sus-\ntains, nurtures and defends civil society against state\nand market pressures. However, in their paper on the\n`coming crisis of empirical sociology', Savage and\nBurrows (2007) argue that the capacity of social\nresearch to realize such a public role is compromised\nby the emergence of big and broad social data streams\ngenerated by \u00ad and largely exclusive to \u00ad commercial\ntransactional data. A consequence of this, in their view,\nis that commercial and private interests now have the\ncapacity to envisage, indeed constitute, populations in\npowerful ways that are insulated from open and demo-\ncratic scrutiny.\nAs we will argue, when set against the growth of\nopenly available data from social media platforms\nand the momentum of the open data movement,4\nthese threats to the legitimacy of academic social sci-\nence may not be as grave as they seem. In our view,\nthese developments provide an opportunity to forge a\nnew relationship with society beyond the academy,\nwhich, if researchers are willing to seize it, may help\nto reinvigorate the programme for a public sociology.\nBig and broad social data\nThe term `big and broad' social data serves to draw\nattention to three salient dimensions that define new\nforms of social data: volume, variety and velocity, the\nlatter reflecting its often real-time and rapidly changing\ncharacter. The term has become one of the key phrases\nfor describing the data deluge and the rise of digital\ninfrastructure and device innovations that not only\nshape and constitute new forms of practice but also\nconfigure data streams in ways that reconfigure and\nconstitute social relations and populations (Ruppert\net al., 2013). Big Data is being generated in multiple\nand interconnecting disciplinary domains that include\ngenetics, environmental science and astronomy, as well\nas within the social domain, where data is being pro-\nduced through a myriad of transactions and inter-\nactions through multiple media and digital networks.\nTechnological innovation in digital communications,\nepitomized in the shift from the informational web\n(Web 1.0) to the interactional web (Web 2.0), provokes\nHousley et al. 3\nnew opportunities and challenges for social research.\nWeb 2.0 technologies, particularly the new social\nmedia platforms (e.g. social networking, blogging and\nmicro-blogging), as well as the increased accessibility of\nthe Web through portable and ubiquitous devices like\nsmartphones, tablets and net books generate new forms\nof data which are of significance for social research, as\nwell as stimulating the development of new methods\nand techniques for analysis. At the same time, the\nincreasing adoption of open data principles by large\npublic bodies in the UK and elsewhere is giving\nresearchers fresh opportunities to interrogate new digi-\ntal data streams to answer social science questions.\nLarge national and multinational corporations have\nrecognized the power of Big Data to help them spot\nbusiness trends; they have developed infrastructure\nand strategies to collect a wide range of data, and con-\ncerns have grown that traditional social science\nresearch methods would not be able to compete. It is\nfeared that big business and other organizations with\ndeep pockets can use the data they gather to group\npeople together into populations that are new and\npowerful, but are inaccessible to public social science\nor, indeed, to any meaningful public scrutiny. This has\nled to the so-called `empirical crisis' identified above.\nHowever, the rise of digital innovations characterized\nby interaction, participation and the `social' provides\nan opportunity to explore ways in which this asymmet-\nrical relationship with data and analytic capacity might\nbe confronted. In particular, they offer the prospect of\nnew ways of engaging with diverse publics, such as `citi-\nzen social science' where members of the public can\nassist with research through crowdsourced coding and\nregistration of their beliefs and opinions at volume in\nrelation to key sociological concerns (see Procter et al.,\n2013c). We see these developments as affording a way\nforward for confronting the empirical crisis within the\nsocial sciences through exploiting these new forms of\nopen data and for developing an additional resource for\na public sociology that has citizen participation at its\ncore. Realizing this transformation entails the develop-\nment of a participatory infrastructure of digital `obser-\nvatories' and `collaboratories'. To this end, we present\nthe COSMOS project as a potential exemplar and early\nprototype.\nChallenges, opportunities and digitally\nre-mastering the classic questions\nIn contrast to the pessimism of the Savage and Burrows\nthesis, we see opportunities as well as the challenges\npresented to social science by innovations in digital\ntechnologies. Broadly defined, the evolving field of\n`digital social research'5 has begun to recognize the\nvalue of big and broad social data. The COSMOS\nproject forms a part of this evolving research field\nand is itself the product of intensive inter-disciplinary\ncollaboration between the social scientists and com-\nputer scientists co-authoring this paper. The computa-\ntional engineering involved in the COSMOS project is\ndiscussed in further detail below. In this section, our\nfocus is upon the social scientific relevance of digital\ntechnologies and the kind of data they produce. In\nbrief, we want to argue that far from undermining the\nsocial scientific programme pursued in the latter half of\nthe 20th century and epitomized in C. Wright Mills'\n(1959) vision of the sociological imagination, these\ntechnologies and their allied data have the potential\nto `digitally re-master' classic questions about social\norganization, social change and the derivation of iden-\ntity from collective life.\nNow that people have enthusiastically adopted\nsocial networking platforms right across society, and\nmobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are\nroutinely used to access information and to interact\nwith friends and with strangers alike, new forms of\ndata are being created that are highly significant for\nsocial research. Even though we are in the midst of\nthis rapid innovation, it is nonetheless possible to dis-\ntinguish three basic lines of argument about its current\nand prospective impact (Edwards et al., 2013). Some\ncommentators suggest that this innovation generates\nmethods and data that can act as a surrogate for\nmore traditional quantitative and qualitative research\ndesigns such as experiments, sample surveys and in-\ndepth interviews. Others argue that digital communica-\ntion technologies re-orientate social research around\nnew objects, populations and techniques of analysis\nsuch as parenting skills or medical self-diagnosis. It\ncan also be argued that digital social research augments,\nbut needs to be used in conjunction with more trad-\nitional methods. C. Wright Mills' identification of\nthree classic questions that underpin the sociological\nimagination are useful for clarifying the distinctive con-\ntribution of digital social research: what can it do that\ntraditional methods cannot in understanding how\nsocial organization and relations are constituted, how\ndo these change over time and how do they generate\nsocial identities? It is argued that digital social research,\nparticularly in the context of the analysis of new social\nmedia, is distinctive in capturing naturally occurring or\n`user-generated' data at the level of populations in real\nor near-real-time. Consequently, it offers the hitherto\nunrealizable possibility of studying social processes as\nthey unfold at the level of populations as contrasted\nwith their official construction through the use of `con-\nventional' research instruments and curated datasets\n(see Table 1 for a summary).\nAn exemplar of this is the possibility of augmenting\ntraditional methods of psephology by registering voting\n4 Big Data & Society\nsentiments expressed through micro-blogging or trad-\nitional methods of urban political analysis by investi-\ngating the role of social media in shifting local policy\nagendas (e.g. Bonso\n\u00b4 n and Nygren,\n2013). In these two examples, new social media can be\nseen to have the potential both to re-organize and\nchange social relations, while leaving a digital footprint\nthat can be collected, analysed and visualized. The pace\nat which this footprint is accumulating and the recur-\nsive qualities of social media also have the potential to\nre-orient social research. An early example of this was\nthe role of social media in propagating rumours about\nriotous activity in English cities in August 2011 and in\nalso examples of the role of social media in propagating\nnot only hateful sentiments but also counter-speech,\nwhich challenges bigotry and other misinformation.\nAn instance of this is the recent micro-blogging reaction\nto a UK television documentary (`Benefits Street'),\nwhich followed the lives of welfare benefits claimants\nliving on a street in the city of Birmingham in the\nEnglish Midlands. The Twitter timeline for #benefits-\nstreet demonstrates the pace at which misunderstanding\nabout the numbers and characteristics of benefits claim-\nants can be challenged both by individual micro-blog-\ngers and by those representing campaigning groups and\ntrade unions.\nAs indicated in Table 1, the distinctive contribution\nof big and broad social data such as social media, as\nboth a subject and means of social research, can be\nclarified through reference to concepts of research strat-\negy and design in the philosophy of social science (e.g.\ndistinction between intensive and extensive research is\nused to differentiate research strategies that are con-\ncerned with investigating how processes work in a par-\nticular case from those concerned with identifying the\n`regularities, common patterns and distinguishing fea-\nAnother useful distinction is between research designs\nthat seek to capture the locomotion of social life, the\nidea that social relations always have to be accom-\nplished and are therefore subject to reformation if not\ntransformation, and those that seek to puncture this\nprocess at certain points in order to capture a `snap-\nshot' of how social relations are configured at any one\nmoment. The former designs imply research that can\nsupport the continuous observation of social life,\nwhich, prior to the advent of big and broad social\ndata, necessitated forms of qualitative inquiry and\nethnographic immersion in the social process in ques-\ntion and this limited observation to the study of `indi-\nvidual agents in their causal contexts' (Sayer, 1992:\n243). By contrast, the distinctive quality of big and\nbroad social data for research is the possibilities it pro-\nvides for the continuous (`real-time') observation of\npopulations hitherto only accessible through episodic\nand retrospective snapshots gleaned through such\ninstruments as household surveys and census data, lon-\ngitudinal studies of cohorts and experiments measuring\npre-test and post-test conditions. In these terms, the\ndistinctiveness of big and broad social data is the pos-\nsibility of extensive research into the locomotion of\nsocial life, such as the unfolding of election campaigns,\nthe shaping of policy agendas in local government, the\nprevalence of suicidal ideation, the propagation of big-\noted and prejudicial opinions and the `sensing' of crime.\nAs emphasized elsewhere (Edwards et al., 2013), how-\never, the real transformative power of big and broad\nsocial data is in its use to augment and re-orientate\nrather than replace the other more established research\nstrategies and designs depicted in Table 1.\nThe COSMOS project as a response\nThe COSMOS project represents an attempt to forge\ninterdisciplinary working between social, computing\nand computational scientists as a means of realizing\nthe theoretical, methodological, empirical and public\nobjectives identified above. A genuine conversation\nand orientation towards interdisciplinarity is key to\nresponding to the challenges of big and broad social\nTable 1.

We have experienced\nfirst-hand the challenges arising from the different epis-\ntemologies, histories and languages of sociology and\ncomputer science, which raise questions about the\nwider politics of knowledge and dynamics of power\nand identity that arise in multidisciplinary work.\nPractices associated with collaborative working and\nteamwork are important for realizing interdisciplinary\nwork of this sort. While not a focus of this paper, the\nrole of interdisciplinary work in networked and distrib-\nuted teams and citizen research is worthy of future scru-\ntiny and consideration (Dutton and Jeffreys, 2010).\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the co-pro-\nduction of digital tools has to sit side by side with the-\noretical and methodological concerns. To this extent\nthe COSMOS platform is merely one expression of a\nwider programme of research within a collaborative\nobservatory framework where other `offline' research\nmethods are also of importance \u00ad not least in relation\nto the ongoing refinement of algorithms via expert and\nlay input through a process of `collaborative algorithm\nder of this paper we will focus on the features of the\nCOSMOS platform and consider how it links to a\npublic sociology agenda and the challenges and oppor-\ntunities outlined earlier.\nThe COSMOS platform\nThe COSMOS platform provides an integrated suite of\ncomputational tools for harvesting, archiving, analys-\ning and visualizing social media data streams using\npublicly accessible application programming interfaces\n(APIs). In this paper, we focus on Twitter data as it\narguably provides the most open and voluminous social\nmedia data source and has thus become established as a\nkey data source for public opinion and behaviour\nmining. Twitter data has been used to measure public\nmood (Bollen et al., 2009), opinion (Pak and Paroubek,\nexplore communication patterns (Bruns and Stieglitz,\nThe COSMOS platform currently provides nine\nmodes of analysis, some of which operate at the indi-\nvidual tweet level and others at a corpus level (i.e. tweet\ncollections). These can be applied individually or in\ncombination to enable the exploration of, and `drilling\ndown' into, datasets as a precursor to more detailed\ninterrogation.\nIndividual tweet level\n. Gender identification is used to derive the portrayed\ngender of the person who posted the tweet (the\ntweeter).\n. Language detection is used to determine the lan-\nguage used in the text of the tweet.\n.

Tension detection was developed specifically for\nCOSMOS. It implements a conversation analytic\nmethod \u00ad membership categorization analysis \u00ad\ncombined with lexicons of expletive terms, tension-\nspecific degradation terms and attribution terms to\nclassify tweets on a three-point ordinal tension scale\n. Geo-spatial location assigns a sending location to\nthe tweet. A small proportion of tweets (1%) cur-\nrently have global positioning system (GPS) co-ordi-\nnates included within their metadata. For those that\ndo not, this tool attempts to derive a probable loca-\ntion from user profile metadata and keyword match-\ning of text referring to place.\nCorpus level\n. Keyword frequency analysis visualizes occurrences\nof specified keywords as a bar chart over time.\nThis allows the researcher to identify visually\npoints of high and low activity in relation to an\nevent or topic. COSMOS visualizes frequency using\nthree units of time \u00ad by day, hour and minute \u00ad each\nvisualized on its own timeline (see Figure 1).\n. Social network analysis enables visualization of the\ninteractional relationships between groups of\nTwitter users (see Figure 4 for an example).\n. Qualitative overview provides a list of the text in all\ntweets. This can comprise all tweets within a specified\ntime range, tweets that match the parameters identi-\nfied using the filters, or a combination of both. The\ntext of each tweet is displayed, along with two attri-\nbutional annotations: the gender of the tweeter and\nthe sentiment scores (positive and negative) calcu-\nlated based on tweet content. This gives the\nresearcher an `at a glance' view of the filtered dataset,\nwhich can support identifying key topics, events,\nopinions and perspectives from the text.\n6 Big Data & Society\nFor a detailed description of the COSMOS platform\nand its tools, see Burnap et al. (2014a).\nLinked data\nThe COSMOS platform was conceived from the begin-\nning as providing ways to link social media data with\nother sources of social data, including key socio-demo-\ngraphic datasets. At the time of writing, the platform\nhas access to the UK Police API, which provides crime\ndata on a local district level for the previous month,\nand is in the process of establishing access to the UK\nOffice for National Statistics, which holds census data\n(as well as many other datasets), including, inter alia,\ndistrict-level unemployment, ethnic composition and\npopulation size.\nOne way in which COSMOS supports data linking is\nthrough geography (see Figure 2).\nSummary\nThe COSMOS platform is currently undergoing beta\ntesting and additional analytical tools are in develop-\nment. Because of the inter-disciplinary make-up of the\nproject team and the core role played by its social sci-\nentist members, development has always been driven by\nan evolving understanding of how computational meth-\nods can best serve the needs of social research. The\nguiding principle has been to explore ways in which\ncomputational social science can make analysis of big\nand broad social data tractable for the established\nstudy principles of qualitative and quantitative\nresearch, while creating the space for methodological\ninnovation.\nOverview of current research\nCOSMOS is based on interdisciplinary, collaborative\nworking where a combination of theory, method\nand data informs our empirical research. In this\nsection, we present four examples of current\nresearch in order to illustrate the potential for col-\nlaborative observatories to generate empirically and\ntheoretically informed insight into the use of social\nmedia-as-data within sociological and social scien-\ntific research.\nIn a recent paper, Tinati et al. (2013: 2) argue that\nsociologists have been slow to respond to the challenges\nof big and broad social data and some of the opportu-\nnities afforded by social media. They state:\n. . . to date, the scope for pushing this research forward\nhas been methodologically limited because social scien-\ntists have approached Big Data with methods that\ncannot explore many of the particular qualities that\nmake it so appealing to use: that is, the scale, propor-\ntionality, dynamism and relationality described above.\nRather, Big Data has commonly been approached with\nsmall-scale content analysis \u00ad looking at small numbers\nof users \u00ad or larger scale random or purposive samples\nFigure 1. COSMOS frequency analysis.\nHousley et al. 7\nof tweets. Rendering Big Data manageable in this way\noverrides its nature as `big' data, bypassing the scale of\nthe data for its availability or imposing an external\nstructure by sampling users or tweets according to a\npriori criteria, external to the data themselves.\nFurthermore, most previous social science studies are\nsnapshots, categorising content and user-types rather\nthan following the data as it emerges dynamically or\nexploring the nature of the social networks that consti-\ntute Twitter.\nThe body of work now emerging out of the\nWilliams et al., 2013) exemplifies how the concerns\nraised by Tinati et al. may be addressed. This work\nreports extensively on interdisciplinary collaborative\nplatform and tool development, methodological issues\nin social media analysis, the use of social media ana-\nlytics in the study of contemporary social phenomena,\nand a consideration of wider methodological and the-\noretical issues for sociology and social science. Space\nprevents a recapitulation of the points here. However, it\nis worth reporting some observations derived from our\ncurrent projects at this point.\nSocial media, demographic proxies and crime\nsensing\nA fundamental problem for researchers is that tweets are\n`data-light', i.e. they lack important demographic data,\ne.g. gender, location, class and age, about their users\nsuch data is not present in an explicit manner, the tools\navailable on the COSMOS platform enable it to be\ninferred with a relatively high level of confidence\n(Sloan et al., 2013). These derived metadata are auto-\nmatically generated and added to harvested tweets.\nThe London 2012 Olympics provide an example of\nhow demographics can aid interpretation of social\nmedia data. Figure 3 is a sentiment graph covering\n(taken from Burnap et al., 2013). This date is more\ncommonly known as `Super Saturday' as it was the\nevening during which Team GB won three gold\nmedals. The data used to produce this graph consists\nof tweets containing the hashtag #TeamGB.\nLooking at the top two lines we can see that the major\npeaks in positive sentiment for Mo Farah's progress in\nthe 10,000 m and the moment when Jessica Ennis cap-\ntures the gold in the heptathlon are female dominated,\ni.e. female tweeters show higher levels of positive senti-\nment than male tweeters. Observations such as this\nFigure 2. Linking social media data and administrative datasets through geography.\n8 Big Data & Society\ngenerate new questions over how people engage with\nsocial media and the influence of gender on content.\nOne current COSMOS project is using census, crime\nand tweets to explore whether crime can be `sensed'\nthrough social data via the signatures (social media)\nand context (area demographics) of real world\nevents.6 This is an example of how linked social\nmedia and curated data can be used to enrich statistical\nmodels of social phenomena in ways that may be able\nto account for complex temporal and spatial factors.\nUnderstanding social media use at the local and\ncivic level\nWe are conducting an ongoing study of Twitter use in\ntwo districts in the UK cities of Cardiff and Manchester\nto compare emerging trends in the use of this social\nmedia at the local and civic level and the extent to\nwhich social media offers ways for the re-shaping of\ncitizen engagement in civil society (Procter et al.,\n2014). Methodologically, our goal is to explore how\nthe analytical tools and capabilities of the COSMOS\nplatform can be applied to scope big and broad\nTwitter data streams to a local or civic level and to\nassess the sociological benefit of doing so in terms of\nthe capacity to generate some form of `scopic' socio-\nlogical insight. It illustrates how COSMOS supports the\ncombination of computational social science methods\napplied to big social data (and social network analysis\nin particular) with in-depth, qualitative analysis.\nWe are interested in looking for evidence of the\nimpact of early adopters and `innovation intermediaries'\nHousley et al. 9\n(Williams et al., 2005), that is, individuals and groups\nwith the skills and resources to shape the use of social\nmedia as a tool for civic participation and how they\norientate to achieving their objectives. In the UK, for\nexample, third sector non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs) such as MySociety (``using digital technologies\nto make people powerful'') are noteworthy for their use\nof Web 2.0 technologies to gather opinions of citizens\nand act as advocates for local causes.\nThe study is based on tweets harvested from the\nwe identified through an initial snowballing exercise as\nbeing associated with the respective communities. This\nre-tweets. Applying social network analysis to this\nsample enables us to identify accounts from which\ntweets and re-tweets originated. In particular, we are\ninterested in three specific measures (see Figure 4):\n1. In-degree (those accounts that were the most tar-\ngeted by other tweeters and re-tweets);\n2. Out-degree (those accounts that posted the\nmost tweets and whose tweets were the most re-\ntweeted);\n3. Between-ness centrality (those accounts that ranked\nhighest in terms of receiving and posting tweets).\nUsing these measures and more general measures of\nactivity on Twitter, we identified 50 accounts for fur-\nther investigation, i.e. qualitative analysis of Twitter\npostings to determine their topics and interviews to\nexplore the variety of strategies and tactics deployed\nin their use of social media within the local civic\nsphere. Each of these interviews was transcribed and\ncoded using the NVivo software package.\nSocial network analysis of the dataset reveals that\nthe local state was overwhelmingly represented with\nthe local council and police force figuring prominently\nFigure 4. Visualization of the social network of Twitter communications in West Cardiff.\n10 Big Data & Society\nand representing key nodes in the network.\nNevertheless, it also reveals the presence of several\nNGOs acting as `bridges' between local state actors\nand individual citizens.\nOne local civil society organization explained how\nthey had used social media to mount a successful cam-\npaign against a council scheme:\nWhen [council xxxx] proposed introducing residents'\nparking in [yyyy], we created a separate Twitter\naccount called ``Saveyyyy'' and garnered peoples' opin-\nions on the issue. Enabled us to effectively mobilise a\ncampaign to object to the scheme . . .\nAnother interviewee explained:\nI have been doing Twitter to communicate with third\nsector organizations in [xxxx], but particularly our\nmember organisation . . . that you mentioned, retweet-\ning information and getting the message out, shoring\nup relationships. That sort of thing . . .\nI guess it is more to increase the following, but we want\nto represent the third sector organisations in [xxxx], so\nwe have got our member organisations and we are\nlooking at increasing our membership, so it's to\nengage with our member organisations, but also hope-\nfully other third sector organisations in [xxxx] who\naren't members and maybe haven't heard of us and\nwho will think gosh, they have got a lot of resources\nor information.\nSo far, our study provides mixed evidence for the\nproposition that social media is enabling a radical\nreshaping of local civil society. Powerful local state\nactors and established political groupings have been\namongst the most enthusiastic and effective early\nadopters of new digital communications technologies,\nbut there is also evidence of local civil society organ-\nizations using social media effectively to promote\ntheir agendas.\nThese results are only a snapshot of social media use\nas a tool for civil society promotion and the relatively\nshort sampling period may bias the results, which\nmotivates continuing research into how early adopters\nare using these technologies and how this is influencing\ntheir potential for radically re-shaping citizen engage-\nment in local civil society.\n`Hate' speech and social media: Understanding\nusers, networks and information flows\nThe rapid and widespread uptake of social media plat-\nforms brings both benefits and risks for civil society and\nnew challenges for agencies responsible for ensuring\nthat the boundaries of acceptable and legal behaviour\nare not crossed. In this respect, the proliferation of the\nso-called `hate speech' in social media is an area of\ngrowing concern, as recent high-profile examples con-\nfirm.7 The most senior prosecutor in England and\nWales recently acknowledged the harm that can be\ncaused by hate speech on social media and explained\nthat ``banter, jokes and offensive comment are com-\nmonplace and often spontaneous'' and ``communica-\ntions intended for a few may reach millions.''8 This\nproject is a study of the migration of hate speech to\nsocial media platforms and focuses on understanding\nthe propagation of this type of antagonistic language.9\nThe project poses several key questions: (i) can we\nidentify hateful and antagonistic social media content,\nas well as attempts to counter it, in terms of key\nevents, linguistic characteristics, sentiment and ten-\nsion? (ii) Can we profile hateful and antagonistic\nsocial media networks in relation to user behaviour\nand interaction, building on the previous question to\ndevelop a typology of users? (iii) Can we triangulate\nthe above analysis with other forms of open data,\nsuch as the new Google Trends10 metrics to validate\nthe propagation of hateful content into online envir-\nonments beyond social networks? (iv) Can we utilize\nthe data derived from the above questions to build\nprobabilistic models to forecast the emergence and\nevolution of information flows within social media\nnetworks through which hate-related content is trans-\nmitted? And (v) can the model and methodology\ninform the social scientific interpretation of how hate-\nful content travels and is impeded online, drawing on\nsocial scientific concepts such as responsibilization\n(Garland, 2001) and nodal governance (Shearing\nTo date we have generated hate speech corpora\ncovering content that is considered homophobic,\nracist, sexist and disablist. These datasets are being\nexamined using various statistical modelling tech-\nniques to identify enablers and inhibitors to hate\nspeech propagation (Burnap et al., 2014b). The sig-\nnificant covariates of propagation can be used by\nregulatory authorities to potentially stem the spread\nof hate speech in the social media eco-system. Our\nmost recent results have shown that racial tension on\nTwitter can propagate around major sporting events\nand can be identified using bespoke tools such as the\nCOSMOS tension engine that is usable by law\nenforcement to help inform operational decisions\nCitizen social science\nWe are committed to developing ways in which the\nCOSMOS platform can be used to facilitate public par-\nticipation in social science. One approach we are\ncurrently exploring is `citizen social science', where\nmembers of the public can assist with research, and\nrecord their beliefs and opinions at volume (Procter\nOur interest in encouraging citizen social science has\nthe very pragmatic goal of securing scalable human\neffort for the analysis of large social media datasets,\nas projects such as Galaxy Zoo11 have already demon-\nstrated for the physical sciences. However, we argue\nthis may be a potentially significant step towards realiz-\ning the programme for a public sociology. It seems to\nus that an important principle for motivating volunteer\neffort is offering meaningful engagement with the\nresearch. At a minimum this might involve providing\nvolunteers with access to the results made possible by\ntheir efforts. More ambitiously, we see citizen social\nscience as providing a basis for forging a new relation-\nship between the social science academy and society.\nHuge potential exists to harness the power of crowd-\nsourcing for the study of society and human behav-\niors . . . but it's just not happening as well as it\ncould . . . it seems odd that social science researchers\nappear to have been comparatively slow to investigate\nthe potential of crowdsourcing . . . social research could\nbe enhanced by the involvement of the public \u00ad from\nhelping to set research agendas, contributing to and\nhelping to analyse data sets, to formalising findings\nand conclusions. Social science issues are human\nissues, after all \u00ad they are about how we relate to\neach other and organise our society and economy \u00ad\nso there seems to be a natural fit with crowdsourcing\nthat's largely being overlooked. This raises some obvi-\nous and legitimate concerns \u00ad from representation to\nresearch ethics and integrity \u00ad but none of these seem\ninsurmountable. Indeed, social scientists would surely\nbenefit from greater public engagement with their\nwork. The prize is surely quicker, cheaper and more\nimaginative research \u00ad the findings from which could\nOur aim over the long term is to develop the COSMOS\nplatform as a `collaboratory', an element of a partici-\npatory research infrastructure supporting public\nengagement in a range of activities that includes the\nexchange of ideas, debates about the shape of institu-\ntions, current social problems, opportunities and\nevents, as well as the co-production of social scientific\nknowledge through citizen social science, where publics\nact as vital sensors and interpreters of social life.\nHowever, any emerging citizen social science will also\nhave to take account of other relational elements and\nconfigurations that include social class, race, gender,\nsexual orientation and geography, in addition to con-\nstellations of expertise and broader common sense\nunderstanding. The synthesis of crowdsourcing tech-\nniques with a sociologically informed citizen social sci-\nence remains public sociological work in progress.\nConcluding remarks\nDevelopments linked to the emergence of big and broad\nsocial data are happening rapidly, and we cannot be\ncertain what impact it will have on research processes.\nIt is possible that it will promote the use of computa-\ntional social science methods in place of more trad-\nitional quantitative and qualitative research methods.\nIt may also influence thinking and re-orientate social\nresearch around new objects, populations and tech-\nniques. However, we think it is most desirable that\nnew methods be used in conjunction with the existing\nones, to make research richer and more nuanced, and\nwe have attempted to motivate this synthesis through\nexamples of our current research summarized above.\nThe analysis of social processes as they actually\nhappen is bound to give researchers insights and inter-\nesting avenues to explore that are absent from the offi-\ncial construction of events that is available via\ntraditional research instruments and curated datasets.\nThe COSMOS platform has been developed to help\nacademic researchers embrace this opportunity.\nThis is not without its challenges, however. An initial\nhypothesis of ours was that the high volume and vel-\nocity of social media communications, as a form of big\nsocial data that is user-generated, would enable us to\nbetter access or `sense' civil society without the inter-\nlocution of administrative or professional categories.\nHowever, as our discussion of initial findings suggests,\nadministrative and professional organizations have\nbeen amongst the most enthusiastic early adopters of\nsocial media communications and thus the next phase\nof social media analysis will need more refined methods\nfor differentiating between the kinds of actor generating\nthis `Big Data', including, of course, the impact of `bot-\nnets'. An obvious example of this is the use of botnets\nto re-tweet and propagate campaigning materials\nduring elections. As a consequence, this next phase\nwill also have to develop methods for understanding\nthe recursive qualities of social media communication\nand whether it is possible to disambiguate types of\nhuman and non-human actor in social media commu-\nnications and, in turn, the consequences of their inter-\naction for shaping social relations, such as the outcome\nof election campaigns. COSMOS has made a start on\nthis kind of analysis through its interrogation of infor-\nmation flows and what they tell us about the patterns of\nhuman interventions in Big Data, such as the authori-\ntative rebuttal of rumour, prejudice and bigotry.\nReturning to our earlier distinction between the qua-\nlities of social media as both a means for, and subject\n12 Big Data & Society\nof, social science, it is possible to identify a number of\nchallenges for augmenting and re-orienting social\nresearch through use of the Big Data generated by\nsocial media. First, with respect to augmentation,\nthere is a need to reconstitute the `Big Data' generated\nby social media into units of analysis that enable it to be\nlinked to datasets held by administrative, professional\nand commercial organizations. As discussed above,\nCOSMOS has made some headway in this by examin-\ning how the sensing of crime through social media can\nbe meaningfully contrasted with police-recorded crime\nrates. The granularity of insights into the pattern of\nsocial relations that can be gleaned through linking\nBig Data with other sources of data also needs to\naddress the wealth of administrative and curated data-\nsets held by local authorities, not just those stored in\nnational archives. As we noted earlier, here the increas-\ning adoption of open data principles by public bodies\ngives grounds for optimism.\nSecond, with respect to re-orientation, there is the\nissue of access to social media data, and here the out-\nlook is less clear. Although free, open access to social\nmedia datasets is subject to constraints, as companies\nseek to monetize their data assets, it is nevertheless cur-\nrently possible for academics to harvest significant and\nuseful volumes of data at no cost. This present arrange-\nment is not sustainable for three reasons, however.\nFirst, it does not meet the needs of all researchers: inev-\nitably, some research will require more data than is\navailable without cost and charges imposed by social\ndata resellers12 that are often too expensive for most\nacademic researchers. While it has been possible for\nsome researchers to negotiate individual deals with\nsocial media companies, this solution is unsatisfactory\nfor obvious reasons: it does not scale and benefits the\nfew at the expense of the majority. Second, it leaves\nresearchers at the mercy of data providers' terms and\nconditions, which may change at any time. Third,\nwhere these terms and conditions prohibit sharing of\ndata, they actively inhibit the capacity of the research\ncommunity to test and validate findings, a cornerstone\nof empirical research practice and trust in scientific\nknowledge production.\nResolving these tensions calls for concerted action\nby research agencies and other stakeholders to negoti-\nate with social media platforms not-for-profit access,\nunder suitable terms and conditions, to social media\ndatasets at no charge.13 Indeed, there are some grounds\nfor optimism. In the USA, for example, the Library of\nCongress announced in 2010 that it had reached agree-\nment with Twitter on the archiving of all public tweets,\nwith the promise that the archive will be made available\nto researchers.14 At the time of writing, the archive\nremains inaccessible. Nor, of course, does the Library\nof Congress plan cover other social media.\nOur aim in the COSMOS project is to help confront\nthe challenges to the social sciences that have been\nraised by Burawoy, Savage and Burrows and many\nothers. We are doing it by engaging with new forms\nof social data and developing in COSMOS a resource\nfor public sociology that has citizen participation at its\nheart. Social science is by no means the only discipline\nin which knowledge production is changing and becom-\ning more `public': but it is probably the one in which\nthe change seems especially appropriate. Now research\ncan start to be done differently, and communicated dif-\nferently. These changes will inevitably force us to\nrethink the role of the academic social scientist in the\nfuture. One way forward would be for academic social\nscientists to actively seek collaborations with groups,\nboth professional and lay, involved in doing various\nkinds of `practical sociology'. Examples of the former\nmight include journalists15 who increasingly find them-\nselves needing to analyse large datasets in order to\nreport news stories;16 examples of the latter might\ninclude community activists who wish to engage with\npolicymakers over issues of concern. As academic\nsocial scientists, we are intrigued by the prospects of\nemulating the example of voluntary organizations\nsuch as the Public Laboratory for Open Technology\nand Science,17 which seek to promote the transfer of\nskills and technologies for environmental science to\ncommunity groups.\nBig and broad social data has given fresh stimulus to\ndebates about research ethics (see e.g. Boyd and\nCrawford, 2012), much of which focuses on the issue\nof people's right to privacy. At one level, we would\nargue that questions about the `public' or `private'\ncharacter of the communications captured as big\nsocial data, its panoptic use for mass surveillance and\nits synoptic use for challenging elite constructions of\nsocial problems and so forth, ought themselves to be\nthe subject of ongoing deliberation and empirical\ninquiry as part of the search for a consensus. We\nwould also argue that we must not lose sight of the\nbroader issue of the ethics of research and innovation\n(see e.g. Stahl et al., 2012). We see the promotion of a\npublic sociology as an important step towards both of\nthese objectives.\nFinally, and following on from the above, the\nboundaries of social science research practice are\nbecoming more porous. As with other disciplines,\nsocial scientific knowledge production is changing,\npotentially becoming more `public', the emergence of\ncitizen social science being a case in point, but also in\nterms of the ways in which research is communicated\nand the rise of the `networked researcher'. These devel-\nopments require a rethinking of the role of the aca-\ndemic social scientist. The opportunity exists for\nreinvigorating the programme for a `public sociology'.\nTaking this opportunity involves embracing openness\nand public dialogue in a digital age, and having the\ncapacity to engage in timely ways \u00ad including in `real-\ntime' \u00ad with unfolding events and social problems as\nthey emerge.\n"
