    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHypervitaminosis A is sometimes associated with abnormalities of calcium metabolism and bone mineral\nstatus. A recent study found a negative association between reported dietary vitamin A intake and bone\nmineral density (BMD). Some segments of the U.S. population have high fasting serum retinyl ester concen-\ntrations, a physiological marker that may reflect high and possibly excessive vitamin A intake. We examined\nthe association between fasting serum retinyl esters and BMD in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994 (NHANES III), a large, nationally representative sample of the U.S. popu-\nlation. BMD was measured for the femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip on all nonpregnant\nparticipants aged >20 years; 5790 participants also had complete data on fasting serum retinyl esters and\ncovariates including age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary supplement use,\ndiabetes, physical activity, and, among women, parity, menopausal status, and the use of oral contraceptives\nor estrogen-replacement therapy. The sample included non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican men and women. We examined the association between fasting serum retinyl esters and BMD at\neach site, controlling for covariates with multiple linear regression. We examined the association with\nosteopenia and osteoporosis with multiple logistic regression. Although the prevalences of high fasting serum\nretinyl esters concentration and low BMD were both substantial in this sample, there were no significant\nassociations between fasting serum retinyl esters and any measure of bone mineral status.

The latter\n1Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.\n2Dr. Ballew is currently Director of the Alaska Native Epidemiology Center, Anchorage, Alaska, USA.\n\u00a9 2001 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nstudy prompted commentators to suggest that adverse bone\neffects of vitamin A could occur at intakes readily achieved\nby dietary choices and supplement use and that the current\nsafe upper limit for retinol intake may not provide an\nVitamin A status is difficult to assess with dietary meth-\nods.(29) Only one previous study of BMD included serum\nretinol as a physiological measure of the vitamin A status of\nthe participants.(22) However, serum retinol is regulated by\nliver storage and by the production of retinol-binding pro-\ntein; a wide range of serum retinol concentrations are con-\nsistent with normal status.(30) Fasting serum retinyl esters\nhave been used as a marker of potential excess vitamin A\nbecause they appear in circulation if intake exceeds liver\nstorage capacity or retinol-binding protein production.(30\u00ad33)\nGenerally, it is accepted that the normal fasting serum\nretinyl ester concentration is 244 nmol/liter (7 g/dl)\nand that the ratio of fasting serum retinyl esters to total\nserum vitamin A (retinol bound to retinol-binding protein\nplus retinyl esters) is 8%; ratios 10% have been inter-\npreted as markers of potential toxicity.(30\u00ad33)\nWe recently reported relatively high serum retinol con-\ncentrations and an unexpectedly high prevalence of fasting\nserum retinyl esters 10% of total serum vitamin A among\nadult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nNHANES III survey also collected data on BMD(36,37) and\nthus provides the first opportunity to explore the association\nbetween BMD and fasting serum retinyl esters as a physi-\nological marker of potential excess vitamin A intake in a\nlarge sample of adults in the United States.\nNHANES III was a nationally representative, complex\nprobability sample survey of the noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation of the United States. Details of the study design and\ninterview and examination procedures have been pub-\nlished.(38) This analysis is based on the public release data\nset.(39) BMD (g/cm2) was measured with dual-energy X-ray\nabsorptiometry (model QDR-1000; Hologic, Inc., Waltham,\nMA, USA); the same equipment was used throughout the\nsurvey.(37) Measurements were made on male and nonpreg-\nnant female participants aged 20 years.(37) The left hip\nwas scanned if it had not been broken previously or did not\nhave pins or a replacement; otherwise, the right hip was\nscanned. The total region and four individual sites were\nmeasured: the femoral neck, trochanter, intertrocanter, and\nWard's triangle. Methodology for the measurement of\nWard's triangle changed between phases 1 and 2 of the\nsurvey so we did not include it in our analysis.(40) The\ndistributions of BMD and the prevalence of osteopenia and\nosteoporosis in NHANES III have been published.(36,37)\nLaboratory analyses were performed in the laboratory of\nthe National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. Serum retinol and reti-\nnyl esters were measured by high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography (HPLC; Waters Chromatography Division,\nMilford, MA, USA). Detailed descriptions of the laboratory\nmethods and of the quality assurance protocols of the survey\nWe confined our analysis to participants who were fasting\n(12 h) at the time blood was drawn for serum retinyl esters\nmeasurement (48% of the participants with hip scans) and\nwho had complete data on potential covariates and exclu-\nsionary criteria. We excluded 648 participants with condi-\ntions or characteristics that might affect vitamin A metab-\nolism or BMD, including those taking antiseizure or\ncorticosteroid medications, undergoing cancer chemother-\napy or treatment for thyroid disease,(42) those with elevated\nc-reactive protein indicating other acute infections or in-\nflammatory conditions, those with acute hepatitis based on\nantibody titers, those with chronic liver disease based on\nclinical examination and medical history, and women who\nwere lactating. We also excluded 191 participants with\nmissing data on these characteristics. We excluded 278\nparticipants of \"other\" race/ethnic identity because the cat-\negory is heterogeneous and the number of participants is\nsmall.(38) The exclusions amounted to 17% of the partici-\npants with BMD and fasting serum retinyl ester measure-\nments. The final sample included 5790 participants and was\nblack, and 5% Mexican American.\nParticipants were asked to report the details of their use of\ndietary supplements in the 30 days before the interview. We\ncalculated the total vitamin A, vitamin D, and calcium\nintake from supplements for each participant using the\nNHANES nutrient content database for supplements.(43) We\ndid not include dietary intake from the 24-h diet recall\ninterview in our analysis because participants provided only\na single 24-h recall and multiple recalls are required to\nestimate nutrient intakes accurately.(29) We did use the 24-h\ndiet recall records to ascertain that none of the participants\nhad consumed excessive amounts of preformed vitamin A\non the day before the test. The 99th percentile of preformed\nvitamin A intake was 6200 g RE, the equivalent of 2 oz of\ncooked liver. Preformed vitamin A intake on the day before\nthe examination accounted for less than four-tenths of 1% of\nthe variance in serum retinyl esters concentration (R2 \nWe stratified the analysis by sex and among women we\nstratified by menopausal status. Menopause was defined\nbased on self-reported bilateral oophorectomy or 12 months\nsince last menstrual period. We included age in years and\nbody mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms/height in\nsquare meters) as continuous variables in all models after\ndetermining that their associations with BMD were linear.\nWe controlled for other covariates known or suspected to\naffect BMD including race/ethnicity; self-reported smoking\n(never/former/current); self-reported heavy alcohol con-\nsumption (five or more drinks per day more than once a\nmonth); diabetes defined by medical history or discovered\nby oral glucose tolerance test during the examination; self-\nreported frequency of leisure-time physical activity in the\nprevious month (none/less than three times per week/greater\nthan or equal to three times per week); and vitamin A,\nvitamin D, and calcium intakes from dietary supplements.\nAmong premenopausal women, we controlled for the use of\noral contraceptives. Among postmenopausal women, we\ncontrolled for the use of estrogen-replacements, the duration\nof replacement use, and years since menopause. For all\nwomen, we controlled for parity (0/1/2 births).\nWe defined osteopenia/osteoporosis according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria(37,44): BMD  1\nSD below the mean of the reference group (non-Hispanic\nwhite participants 20\u00ad29 years old by sex from the\nNHANES III survey). We combined osteopenia/\nosteoporosis as a single endpoint because there were rela-\ntively few participants with osteoporosis (2.5 SD below\nmean of the reference group) except among participants\nWe assessed the association between BMD at each site\n(femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip re-\ngion) and either fasting serum retinyl esters concentration or\nfasting retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A\nwith multiple linear regression, controlling for statistically\nsignificant covariates. We assessed the relative odds of\nosteopenia/osteoporosis at each site associated with retinyl\nesters with multiple logistic regression, controlling for sta-\ntistically significant covariates. Age, BMI, and race/\nethnicity were included in all models. For other potential\ncovariates, only those statistically significant at the 0.05\nlevel were included in the final models, which were ob-\ntained by backward exclusion of nonsignificant independent\nvariables. We performed sensitivity and specificity tests\nwith receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analy-\nsis(45) in search of a sample-based cut point for fasting\nserum retinyl ester concentration or percent fasting serum\nretinyl esters associated with a significant increase in the\nrisk of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Analyses were performed\nwith SUDAAN software (version 7.5; Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, SC, USA), taking into\naccount the complex stratified and weighted nature of the\nRESULTS\nOverall, 32.8% of participants had fasting serum retinyl\nesters 10% of total serum vitamin A and one-quarter or\nmore had osteopenia/osteoporosis at one or more sites (Ta-\nble 1). The patterns of association between BMD or\nosteopenia/osteoporosis and the covariates included in the\nanalysis were similar for all four sites considered (data not\nshown). Fasting serum retinyl ester concentration and fast-\ning serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A\nwere highly correlated and exhibited similar associations\nwith BMD and osteopenia/osteoporosis (data not shown).\nTherefore, we present only the models predicting BMD or\nosteopenia/osteoporosis at the femoral neck from percent\nfasting serum retinyl esters. These results are representative\nof all the models analyzed. We chose to present the models\nfor femoral neck because it is a common site of osteoporotic\nfracture.\nThe expected negative association of BMD with age, the\npositive association with BMI, and the racial/ethnic differ-\nences were noted in this analysis, as was the protective\neffect of current estrogen-replacement therapy among post-\nmenopausal women (Table 2). Current and former smokers\nhad significantly lower BMD than nonsmokers among men\nbut not among premenopausal or postmenopausal women.\nPhysical activity and diabetes mellitus were significantly\npositively associated with BMD only among men.

Fasting\nserum retinyl ester concentration or fasting serum retinyl\nesters as percent of total serum vitamin A were not signif-\nicantly associated with BMD at any site after controlling for\nsignificant covariates.\nThe relative odds of having osteopenia/osteoporosis in-\ncreased with age, decreased with increasing BMI, and was\ngreatest among non-Hispanic white participants in all sub-\ngroups, although the differences between non-Hispanic\nwhite and Mexican American women did not achieve the\n0.05 level of statistical significance for either premeno-\npausal or postmenopausal women (Table 3). Current\nestrogen-replacement therapy was protective among post-\nmenopausal women. Fasting serum retinyl ester concentra-\ntion or fasting serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum\nvitamin A was not associated with an increased risk of\nosteopenia/osteoporosis at any site in any stratum after\ncontrolling for significant covariates.\nSensitivity/specificity (ROC) analysis did not identify any\nvalue of fasting serum retinyl ester concentration or any\nvalue of fasting serum retinyl esters as percent of total\nserum vitamin A that was significantly associated with the\npresence of osteopenia/osteoporosis (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nWe found no associations between physiological indica-\ntors of potential excess vitamin A intake and either BMD or\nosteopenia/osteoporosis in a large sample of U.S. adults\nalthough nearly one-third of the sample had fasting serum\nretinyl esters 10% of total serum vitamin A, the level\nwidely believed to indicate excess vitamin A.(30\u00ad33) The\nsample size for this analysis provides adequate power to\nshow a significant association between BMD and fasting\nserum retinyl esters in a regression model with a regression\ncoefficient of 0.01 or an increase in the prevalence of\nosteopenia/osteoporosis of 15% associated with elevated\nfasting serum retinyl esters, both at the p  0.01 level of\nstatistical significance and type II error  0.10. In addition,\nthe use of osteopenia or osteoporosis as an endpoint, instead\nof the more conservative osteoporosis only, would be ex-\npected to detect an association between vitamin A status and\nearly trends in bone mineral loss.\nOur results are consistent with those of previous studies\nthat found no associations between vitamin A intake and\nBMD.(21\u00ad24) Our results are not consistent with those of\nMelhus et al.,(26) who found a modest negative association\nbetween reported dietary vitamin A intake and BMD, which\nwas attributable to the influence of women in the highest\nquartile of intake relative to those in the lower three quar-\ntiles. The women aged 28\u00ad74 years examined by Melhus et\npants from the NHANES III sample included in this anal-\nysis. We can compute group mean intakes with confidence\nalthough we were not able to assess individual usual intakes\nfrom a single day of recall.(29) The median dietary plus\nAll men\nPremenopausal women\nPostmenopausal\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic white --a --a --a\nSmoking status\nNever --a --b --b\nPhysical activity\nMore than or equal to three times/\nweek\n--a --b --b\na Reference category.\nb Not included in model.\nsupplemental vitamin A intake for all participants included\n31,140 g) for postmenopausal women. The recommended\ndietary allowance (RDA) for adult males is 900 g RE/day,\nfor adult females is 700 g RE/day, and the upper limit for\nThe primary difference between our study and that of\nMelhus et al.(26) is that we used a physiological marker of\npotential excess vitamin A consumption whereas they used\ndietary intake data. Melhus et al.(26) used four 1-week diet\nrecords for their BMD study, many more days than most\nepidemiological studies collect, but it has been estimated\nthat 365 days are required to estimate \"usual\" or long-\nterm intakes of vitamin A because of the distribution of\nvitamin A in the food supply.(29) For vitamin A status, a\nphysiological measure may be more appropriate to assess\npotential risk.\nElevated fasting serum retinyl esters are indicators of\nvitamin A intake in excess of liver capacity to store retinol\nand to produce retinol-binding protein.(30) Serum retinyl\nesters deliver retinol to the tissues unregulated by retinol-\nbinding protein, which is responsible for the toxic effects of\nexcess retinol on cell membranes including those of\nbone.(48) There are many case reports that clinical hypervi-\ntaminosis A is associated with a variety of alterations of\ncalcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, especially in\nyoung children given very large doses of supplemental\nvitamin A.(1\u00ad9) There also are reports of hypervitaminosis A\naccompanied by abnormal calcium status among adoles-\ncents and adults, although not all patients exhibited\ndemineralization.(2,10\u00ad18) In the case reports, patients with\naltered calcium metabolism and bone lesions reported reti-\nnol intakes ranging from 10 times to 90 times the recom-\nmended levels for age, in some cases for extended periods\nof time, and they had clinical signs of hypervitaminosis A.\nOverall, 25.6% of our sample reported taking supple-\nments containing vitamin A. The median intake of vitamin\nA obtained from supplements was 1495 g RE/day and the\nported taking 3000 g RE/day, the current recommended\nupper limit of intake,(47) and only 7 reported taking\n10,000 g RE/day. All of the participants who reported\ntaking supplements had serum retinyl ester concentrations\nand serum retinyl esters as percent of total serum vitamin A\nwithin normal limits. None of the participants in this sam-\nple, whether they took supplements or not, had signs of\nclinical hypervitaminosis A noted in the clinical examina-\ntion, nor did any have liver disease as assessed by five\nbiochemical measures of liver dysfunction.(35)\nThis analysis has several advantages over previous stud-\nies in addition to the availability of a physiological marker\nfor potential excess vitamin A intake. The sample is very\nlarge, includes both men and women, and includes partici-\npants from 20 to 90 years of age. Most previous studies\nincluded only postmenopausal women(21\u00ad23) or elderly par-\nticipants.(25) However, there are limitations to the general-\nizability of our analysis. We excluded 48% of the partici-\npants with BMD measurements who were not fasting at the\ntime blood was drawn for the analysis of serum retinyl\nesters. Fasting status was determined by the examination\nschedule: participants examined in the morning were fasting\n12 h but those examined in the afternoon were not. There\nis no reason to expect that scheduling of the examination\nwould be related systematically to vitamin A status, BMD,\nor any of the covariates included in the analysis. We also\nexcluded 17% of the participants with BMD and fasting\nserum retinyl ester data because they were taking medica-\ntions that might be expected to alter vitamin A metabolism\nor BMD; because they had acute infections, inflammatory\nconditions, or chronic liver disease; or because they were\nmissing data on these characteristics or missing data for the\ncovariates included in the analysis. Most were, because of\nthe exclusionary criteria, acutely or chronically ill. Al-\nthough these exclusions taken together may reduce the\nrepresentativeness of our sample and thus may limit our\nability to generalize the results of our analysis, this does not\nAll men\nPremenopausal women\nPostmenopausal\nRace/ethnicity\nNon-Hispanic white --a --a --a\nCurrent estrogen-replacement\ntherapy\na Reference category.\nb Not included in model.\nnegate the results we observed in this large sample of U.S.\nadults.\nWe conclude that although the prevalence of relatively\nhigh fasting serum retinyl esters is substantial in the U.S.\npopulation,(35) this marker of vitamin A status was not\nassociated with evidence of reduced BMD in this sample of\napparently healthy adults. We wish to emphasize that none\nof the participants included in this analysis showed clinical\nsigns of hypervitaminosis A and very few reported taking\nlarge amounts of supplemental vitamin A. The potential for\nvitamin A toxicity as a result of extreme dietary practices or\noverenthusiastic use of supplements and the potential for\nassociated systemic effects including accelerated bone min-\neral loss should not be minimized based on our results.\nHowever, within the range represented by this sample,\nvitamin A status does not appear to be associated with\nREFERENCES\n1.
