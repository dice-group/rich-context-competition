Methods: Data from 327 older par-\nent\u00adadult child dyads were analyzed. Using\nmultilevel models, we examined factors (e.g., eco-\nnomic resources, family characteristics, current sup-\nport exchanges, and beliefs about family obligation)\nassociated with expectations of inheritance. We also\nexplored patterns of correspondence in expectations\nover inheritance within dyads and what factors are\nassociated with these patterns. Results: We\nfound a significant generational difference in expec-\ntations of inheritance, with children less likely to\nexpect inheritances than parents expected to give.\nParent's income, number of siblings, and support cur-\nrently given to children were significantly associated\nwith both parents' and children's positive expecta-\ntions of inheritance. The effects of child's income,\nsupport given to parent, and parent's gender on\ninheritance expectations differed between parents\nand children. Compared with discordant dyads\n(parents intended to leave a bequest, but their child\ndid not expect an inheritance), correspondent dyads\n(both parents and children expected a bequest)\nshowed higher income of parents and children,\nmore support given to the child, and lower levels of\nchild's filial obligation. Implications: Although\nbequest decisions are circumscribed by parent's\nfinancial resources, our findings suggest that they\nare also a continuation of established patterns of\nexchanges. Parents and children form their intention\nor expectation about inheritance based on different\nfactors, leaving open the possibility of misunder-\nstandings between the generations.\nKey Words:Inheritance, Dyadic correspondence,\nParent\u00adchild relationships, Support exchanges\nSignificant attention has been given in recent\nyears to intergenerational support between aging\nparents and their adult children,but family scholars\nand gerontologists have largely overlooked the\n\"final\" transfer between generations--inheritance.\nThe economic literature has long studied material\ntransfers among adult family generations through\ninter-vivos gifts and inheritance, focusing on the\nmechanism generating or maintaining social\ninequality of wealth (Arrondel & Masson,\ninheritance is executed after the death of the\nparent, decisions regarding inheritance can impact\nthe lives of family members economically and\nThe Gerontologist\npsychologically both before and after the person's\ndeath (Angel & Mudrazija, 2011; Sousa, Silva,\nSantos, & Patr\u00e3o, 2010). Aging parents usually\nhave made plans for bequests in advance, and their\nadult children also form their own expectations of\nreceiving an inheritance.These implicit and explicit\nexpectations of family members surrounding\ninheritance may influence decisions about support\nexchanges and relationship outcomes between\ngenerations, especially in aging families (Caputo,\nDespite the importance of multiple perspec-\ntives among family members in transfer decisions\n(Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2004), the investigation of\nbequest behaviors has mainly considered the aging\nparents' perspective (McGarry, 1999). The few\nstudies considering adult children have examined\nseparately the correlates of parents' bequest deci-\nsions and children's inheritance expectations (Kao,\nKlingebiel, & Kohli, 2005). Moreover, there is\nlittle empirical work on whether children's expec-\ntations of inheritance are in agreement with their\nparents' plans for bequests and whether children\nunderstand parental motives behind the bequest\nintentions. Under some circumstances, discrepan-\ncies in views on inheritance between parents and\nchildren could lead to family conflict and affect\ncurrent exchanges and relationships (Stum, 2000).\nThis study extends the investigation of inherit-\nance by incorporating perspectives from both par-\nents and their children. In this study, we used data\nobtained from 327 dyads of aging parents (aged\n59\u00ad96 years) and middle-aged children (aged\n40\u00ad60 years) about their expectations regard-\ning inheritance, including the parent's intention\nto leave a bequest and the child's expectations of\nreceiving an inheritance. First, we investigated fac-\ntors associated with expectations of inheritance\nreported by parents and their offspring as well\nas whether the effects of these factors differed\nbetween parents and children. Second, we looked\nspecifically at whether expectations about inherit-\nances are in agreement within parent\u00adchild dyads\nand examined the correlates of correspondence\npatterns.\nTheories on Bequest Motives\nMost of the economic literature on inheritance\nhas examined motivations of older parents to leave\nbequests to their children, based on two compet-\ning explanations: altruism and exchange\u00adstrategic\nmodels (Arrondel & Masson, 2006). The altruism\nmodel assumes parental affection, moral duty, or\nobligation as a basis for providing help in situa-\ntions of need (Becker, 1991). Based on altruism\ntheory, parents would be expected to leave the\nlargest bequests to the least well-off children.\nThus, studies that examine parental motivations of\nbequests have focused on variables regarding chil-\ndren's financial status, such as income, education,\nand assets (Altonji, Hayashi, & Kotlikoff, 2002;\nIn contrast, exchange models emphasize self-\ninterest motives to maximize personal rewards and\nminimize personal costs even in relationships with\nsignificant others, including family members (Cox\n& Rank, 1992). According to this model, bequests\nrepresent payments for assistance and attention\nreceived from children. Parents may use the pros-\npect of future bequests to induce their children to\nprovide care to them when they are old and to have\nsome control over the behavior of their offspring\n(Bernheim, Shleifer, Summers, 1985; Kotlikoff &\nMorris, 1989). Therefore, the exchange model\nhas focused on examining associations between\nbequests and child-to-parent inter-vivos transfers,\nusually social support, including care and housing\nHowever, empirical work on bequests has failed\nto provide evidence supporting either altruistic or\nexchange models. Inter-vivos transfers (as occur-\nring while the parents are alive) are more likely to\nbe given to less well-off children, which is consist-\nent with the altruistic model (McGarry & Schoeni,\n1997). By contrast, in contemporary western soci-\neties, bequests tend to be divided in equal shares\namong children, regardless of children's income or\ninformal support from children (McGarry, 1999;\nWilhelm, 1996).Thus, it appears that the economic\nmodels provide limited predictability of bequest\nbehaviors.\nFactors Associated With Expectations on\nBequest or Inheritance\nThis study focuses on family member's\nexpectations about inheritance and factors\nassociated with these expectations. In examining\nbequest motives, prior studies have indicated\nusefulness of \"subjective\" measures of expected\nInvestigations based on \"actual\" bequests often\nconfound a wide range of measurement errors in\nestimating the amount of bequests as well as results\nby unintended (accidental) bequests, which may\nmask individuals' original motives behind bequest\nIndividuals' motives for bequests may reflect\nboth their children's needs (altruism) and their own\ndesire for support while alive (exchange theory).\nDrawing on the two competing theories and previ-\nous work on bequest motives, we considered four\nsets of factors: (a) economic resources, (b) family\ncharacteristics, (c) current support exchanges, and\n(d) beliefs about family obligation. We considered\nthese factors with regard to both the parent's and\nthe child's perspective.\nEconomic Resources.--The financial circum-\nstances of family members may be the main factor\nin shaping parents' and children's expectations of\nbequests because they are directly associated with\nneeds and resources for bequests. Although paren-\ntal economic resources (e.g., income and wealth)\nappear to be the most potent and consistent deter-\nminant of bequest decisions in a positive direction\nchildren's economic resources on bequests are not\nclear. Studies found that parents are likely to divide\ninheritance equally among all children, regardless\nof their income (Altonji, Hayashi, & Kotlikoff,\nother studies also showed that children's education,\nas a proxy of socioeconomic status, is positively\nassociated with bequest probability; children with\nmore education are likely to receive more in paren-\nFamily Characteristics.--We considered effects\nof two family characteristics (e.g., number of sib-\nlings and race) on family members' expectations\nof a bequest. First, number of siblings appears to\nhave a negative effect on the probability of receiv-\ning inter-vivos financial support from parents\n(Schoeni, 1997). In particular, given that bequests\nare usually (equally or unequally) divided among\nsiblings, the share of bequest that each child will\nreceive would decrease with the number of siblings\nas competitors for resources (Hurd, 2003).\nIn addition, given racial differences in the mode\nof intergenerational support, family members'\nexpectations of inheritance may differ by race.\nPrior studies have shown that White families are\nmore likely to exchange financial and emotional\nsupport, whereas African and Latino families tend\nto be involved in practical assistance and housing\nRegarding bequests, Kao and colleagues (1997)\nfound that White adults are more likely to expect\nan inheritance from their parents than non-Whites.\nWhether these racial patterns reflect race differ-\nences in parental financial resources or cultural\ndifferences in preferences or expectations remains\nCurrent Support Exchanges.--Studies have\noften emphasized distinctions between inter-vivos\ntransfer and bequests and analyzed correlates of\nthese two types of family transfers separately.\nHowever, current support exchanges may influence\nexpectations of an inheritance. Put another way, in\nforming expectations or plans for bequests, fam-\nily members may draw on their current patterns\nof support exchanges (Arrondel & Masson, 2006).\nAs noted earlier, exchange models suggest that\nanticipated inheritance can be rewards for sup-\nport or care provided to older parents by children\n(i.e., upward exchanges; Bernheim et al., 1985).\nHowever, empirical support for this is mixed.\nFrom the perspective of offspring, sons' expecta-\ntions of inheritance were positively associated with\nsocial support provided to their parents, whereas\ndaughters' expectations of inheritance were nega-\ntively associated with support to parents (Caputo,\nthe part of parents, Caputo (2005) showed that\nparents who have intentions to leave inheritances\nto children are more likely to have adult daughters\nproviding informal care to them. However, Norton\nand van Houtven (2006) reported that support\nprovided by children had no effect on the equality\nof parent's intended bequest.\nMeanwhile, the effects of downward transfers\n(given to children by parents) on bequest intentions\nhas not received as much attention. McGarry\n(1999) found that families providing support to\ntheir children differed in the predictors of intended\nbequests from families who were not making inter-\nvivos transfers. This suggests that current support\ngiven to children should be taken into account\nwhen examining intended bequests.\nBeliefs on Family Obligation.--The economic\nliterature often infers motives from the behaviors,\nignoring or downplaying cultural and psychologi-\ncal factors as important motives for bequest behav-\niors. However, norms of responsibility and family\nobligation may play an important role in explain-\ning parents' intention and children's expectation\nfor inheritance (Ikkink, van Tilburg, & Knipscheer,\ntion toward offspring often reflects their altruistic\naffection and attention persisting over time, and\nfilial obligation to provide support to older parents\nmay include child's reciprocation and gratitude for\nsupport and affection received from parents when\nthey were young (Silverstein, 2006). Therefore,\nfilial obligations toward parents may preclude\nadult children from having expectations of future\nreturn from parents, though parental obligations\ntoward children may ensure their intention to\nleave bequests.\nControl Variables.--We also considered three\ndemographic characteristics of participants (e.g.,\nage, gender, and self-rated health) and geographic\ndistance between dyadic members as controls.\nGiven that issues about inheritance may be more\nrelevant for families in later years, ages of par-\nents and children are likely to influence expecta-\ntions over inheritance. Gender of parents may also\naffect expectation of inheritances. It is likely that\nfathers consider their surviving spouses in making\na plan for bequests, due to gender disparities in life\nexpectancy (Clignet, 2009). In addition, expecta-\ntions of bequests can be affected by parents' health\nstatus because family members may consider pos-\nsible medical and long-term care expenses when\nolder parents are in poor health (Hurd & Smith,\n2001). Because proximity constrains provision of\ncertain types of help, we also included geographic\ndistance between parents and children (Fingerman\nIn sum, this study takes into account the differ-\nent perspectives of aging parents and adult chil-\ndren to explore expectations of inheritance within\nfamily contexts. Utilizing data from 327 dyads\nof older parents and their middle-aged children,\nwe investigated what factors are associated with\nexpectations of inheritance reported by parents\nand children, and if parents' and children's expec-\ntations of inheritance are associated with the same\nor different factors. In addition, we examined how\nparent's intention and child's expectation about\ninheritance correspond within dyads and what\nfactors are associated with patterns of dyadic cor-\nrespondence. Factors to explain inheritance expec-\ntations and dyadic concordance patterns included\neconomic resources of parents and children (i.e.,\neducation and income), family characteristics\n(i.e., number of siblings and race), current sup-\nport exchanges between the dyadic members (i.e.,\nupward and downward directions of exchanges),\nand beliefs about family obligation.\nMethods\nSample\nThis analysis is based on data from \"The family\nexchanges study\" (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt,\n& Zarit, 2009). As a first step in the sampling\nprocedure, respondents aged 40\u00ad60 years who had\nat least one living parent and one or more biological\nchildren aged more than 18 years were recruited.\nPotential respondents were randomly selected\nfrom phone lists from Genesys Corporation as\nwell as random digit dialing from the Philadelphia\nPrimary Metropolitan Statistical Area. Of the\nFrom the original sample of 633 middle-aged\nbe interviewed. In 223 cases, one parent was inter-\nviewed, and in 57 cases, both parents were inter-\nviewed, which yielded a total of 337 discrete dyads.\nIn comparison to parents who did not participate\n< .01), and in a better relationship with their child\nBecause exchanges between the middle-aged\nchild and his or her mother and father were meas-\nured separately, we considered each parent\u00adchild\ndyad as a separate unit. The aging parents were\nasked a set of questions that were identical to those\nfor their children. Excluded were dyads who did\nnot have reports from both dyadic members on\nour main variable (n = 10), so that the final sample\nTable 1 presents background information of the\nsample.\nMeasures\nExpectation of Inheritance.--Our dependent\nvariable was expectation of leaving a bequest or\nreceiving an inheritance. Thus, we measured the\nviews of parents and children on the same future\nevent within the family. Older parents answered\nyes or no to whether they intend to leave an inher-\nitance for their child. Adult children also answered\nyes or no to whether they expect to receive an\ninheritance from their parent (see Table 2).\nIndependent Variables\nEconomic Resources.--As indicators of eco-\nnomic resources, we used household income and\neducation of each parent and child. Participants\nMcGarry & Schoeni, 1997), and they also pro-\nvided their years of education.\nFamily Characteristics.--Regarding family char-\nacteristics of parent\u00adchild dyads, family size was\nmeasured by the number of siblings that adult chil-\ndren have. Race was dichotomized: White families\nwere coded 1 and racial minority families were\ncoded 0. The vast majority of these families were\nCurrent Support Exchanges.--We assessed sup-\nport that children provided to their parents (i.e.,\nupward exchanges) and support that parents pro-\nvided to their children (i.e., downward exchanges).\nUsing the Intergenerational Support Scale (ISS;\nFingerman et al., 2009), we measured how often\nparticipants provided and received six types of\nsupport (emotional support, practical assistance,\nadvice, socializing, financial support, and listening\nto talk about daily events) on an 8-point scale\nranged from 1 (less than once a year or not at all)\nto 8 (daily). We calculated mean scores across the\nsix types of support. Because we have both chil-\ndren's and parents reports of support exchanged\nwith their dyadic partner, we used average scores\nof parents' and children's reports to represent each\ndirection of support exchanges between them\nupward support).\nFamily Obligation.--For norms of family obli-\ngation, parents were asked how often parents\nshould provide offspring with six types of support\n(emotional support, practical assistance, listening\nto the other's talk, socializing, advice, and finan-\ncial support), and children indicated how often\nthey thought children should provide such support\nto their parents. This assessment was based on\nTable 1.

Means of the six items were com-\nControl Variables.--Three demographic char-\nacteristics of parents and children (e.g., age, gen-\nder, and self-rated health) and geographic distance\nbetween dyadic members were included as control\nvariables. Participants provided their chronologi-\ncal age. Gender was coded 1 for male and 0 for\nfemale. Self-rated health for the past 12 months\nwas measured using a 5-point scale ranging from\n1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Geographic distance\nbetween parents' and noncoresident children's res-\nidences was measured in miles. To address positive\nskew of distance, we used a log\u00adlinear transforma-\ntion in the analyses.\nAnalysis Plan\nQuestion 1.--Dyadic data represents a special\ncase of hierarchically clustered data, with individu-\nals nested within dyads. To account for the interde-\npendence of individuals within each dyad, we used\nmultilevel models (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006;\nSayer & Klute, 2005). Because the dependent vari-\nable of this study is a dichotomous variable (yij\nor 0), we employed SAS PROC NLMIXED pro-\ncedure, which transformed the binary dependent\nvariable into the probability of the response, using\na logit link function (Guo & Zhao, 2000):\nh\nij\nij\nij\np\np\n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n( )\nwhere pij\nis the probability of observing the\nresponse, yij\n(e.g., expected or not inheritances),\nand ij\nis the log-odds of observing the response.\nBased on the link function, multilevel models were\nspecified as follows:\nLevel 1: ij\n(Generationij\n)\nWqj\nWqj\nAt Level 1, the multilevel model includes only\nthe distinguishing variable within dyads, genera-\ntion (coded 0 for parents and 1 for children), as\na predictor (Model 1). The intercept 0j\nrepresents\nthe expected inheritance probability for indi-\nviduals in dyad j whose generation is equal to 0\n(i.e., parents). The slope 1j\nrepresents effects of\ngeneration on the probability of inheritance. Here,\nit should be noted that the Level 1 equation does\nnot have an error term, due to the nature of dyadic\ndata with binary dependent variables (McMahon,\nAt Level 2, we examined the effects of four\nsets of predictors, Wqj\nto explain the variation of\nthe intercept (0j\n, overall inheritance probabil-\nity within dyads) and slope coefficients (1j\n, gen-\nerational differences in inheritance probability\nwithin dyads) across dyads. Thus, predictors for\nthe intercept show factors affecting expectations\non inheritance commonly for parents and children\n(Model 2), whereas predictors for the slope reveal\nif the effect of each factor is the same or different\nbetween parents and children, which is a form of\ninteraction with the distinguishing variable (Model\n3). We presented the significant interaction terms,\ntrimming insignificant interaction terms for par-\nsimoniousness of model. Given that inclusion of\nrandom slope variance for dyadic data with only\ntwo observations per cluster can cause convergence\nproblems (McMahon et al., 2006), we included\nonly the random intercept for the Level 2 model.\nQuestion 2.--To examine dyadic correspond-\nence on inheritance expectations, we looked at the\nproportion of four groups based on the answers of\nparent and offspring within dyads (Table 2): two\ncorrespondent dyads (\"yes\u00adyes\" or \"no\u00adno\") and\ntwo discordant dyads (\"yes\u00adno\" and \"no\u00adyes\").\nFirst, a McNemar test was used to examine an\neffect of generation in the percentage of parents\nand children who expected an inheritance (Kenny\net al., 2006). Second, to investigate factors related\nto patterns of the dyadic concordance on inherit-\nance expectations, we conducted a logistic regres-\nsion analysis (e.g., concordant dyads vs. discordant\ndyads), including the same sets of predictors as in\nQuestion 1.\nResults\nFactors Predicting Inheritance Expectations\nThe first question of this study was to exam-\nine factors that predict inheritance expectations\nreported by aging parents and their adult chil-\ndren (Table 3). As an initial step, we included only\nthe distinguishing variable (i.e., parent or child),\nwhich estimates generational differences in dyadic\nreports of the inheritance expectations (Model 1).\nGeneration showed a significant negative effect\non inheritance expectations, indicating that chil-\ndren were less likely to expect receiving an inher-\nitance than parents intended to leave a bequest\n(OR = 0.07). The significant random effect for\nintercept indicated that there is substantial unex-\nplained variance in the outcome variable, and\nLevel 2 predictors could be added to the model.\nNext, we added four sets of predictors to the\nmodel to explain between-dyad variability in the\noverall probability of expected inheritance (main\neffect model; Model 2). Regarding economic\nresources, only parents' income was significant in\na positive direction, suggesting that dyads in which\nparents had higher levels of income are more likely\nto expect inheritances. None of offspring's eco-\nnomic resources were significant. Among family\ncharacteristics, number of siblings was negatively\nassociated with bequest probability, indicating that\nhaving more siblings is associated with the lower\nexpectations of inheritance. Race did not show a\nsignificant effect on the inheritance expectations.\nAmong the estimates of current exchanges of sup-\nport, downward exchanges were positively associ-\nated with expectations of inheritance. Thus, dyads\nwhere parents are currently giving more support\nto children showed higher probability of expected\ninheritance. Upward exchanges (i.e., support given\nto parents) had no effect. Finally, we found no\neffects of parents' or offspring's beliefs about fam-\nily obligation on expectations of inheritance.\nWe then turned to the interactions with gen-\neration to look at whether the four sets of factors\nare associated with expectations on inheritance\nin the same or different ways for each generation\nTable 3. Multilevel Models to Predict Expectations of Inheritance\nPredictors\nFixed effects\n Economic resources\n Family characteristics\n Current support exchanges\n Beliefs on family obligation\n Controls\n Interaction terms\nRandom effects\n(interaction effect model; Model 3). We found\nsignificant interaction effects with generation for\nthree factors: child's income, upward exchanges,\nand parents' gender. Specifically, when children\nhad higher levels of income, they were less likely to\nexpect to receive an inheritance, whereas their par-\nents were more likely to intend to leave one. In the\ndyads where children were providing more sup-\nport to parents, children were less likely to expect\nto receive an inheritance, whereas their parents\nwere more likely to expect leaving one. Finally,\nwhen the parent is a father, children were less\nlikely to expect to receive an inheritance, whereas\nfathers were more likely to have intentions to leave\nan inheritance. After entering the interaction terms\nof these factors, the effect of generation was no\nlonger significant.\nDyadic Correspondence in Expectations of\nInheritance\nTo address the second question about the\ndyadic correspondence, we first looked at the pro-\nportion of the four groups formed from parents'\nand children's dichotomous answers (see Table 2).\nAs observed in the previous analysis, parents\nwere more likely than their offspring to expect an\nAbout a half of the dyads (53.5%) agreed regard-\ning expectations of inheritance and the other half\n(46.5%) disagreed. Among correspondent dyads,\nmore dyads answered \"yes\" (78.9%) than when\nboth members of the dyad answered\"no\"(21.1%).\nFor discordant dyads, the most common pattern of\ndiscordance was for parents to say that they will\nleave a bequest, but for their adult children to say\nthey do not expect an inheritance. In contrast, it\nwas very rare (5.3%) that parents say they would\nnot leave an inheritance but for their children to\nexpect to receive an inheritance.\nTo examine predictors associated with the\ndyadic concordance patterns on inheritance prob-\nability, we chose the two largest groups: \"yes\n(parent)\u00adyes (child)\" dyads (n = 138) as a corre-\nspondent pattern and \"yes (parent)\u00adno (child)\"\ndyads (n = 144) as a discordant pattern. We\ndecided not to combine groups or compare all four\ngroups separately, considering the small sample\nsizes of some groups and different characteristics\nof each group. We coded correspondent dyads 1\nand discordant dyads 0. Table 4 shows the results\nof the logistic regression analysis to explain the\ndifferences between correspondent and discordant\ndyads. Correspondent dyads where both parents\nand children answered \"yes\" showed higher levels\nof parents' income and support given from parents\nto children. They also showed lower levels of chil-\ndren's income and lower levels of children's obli-\ngation, compared with discordant dyads, in which\nparents intended to leave a bequest but their chil-\ndren did not expect an inheritance.\nDiscussion\nFindings of this study showed a significant dif-\nference in the expectations of inheritance between\nolder parents and adult offspring. Specifically, in\nmany families, adult children were less likely to\nexpect to receive an inheritance than their parents\nintended to leave one. Thus, discrepant expecta-\ntions over inheritance between generations suggest\nthat inheritance issues are a substantially hid-\nden agenda, even within older families. The fact\nthat parents were more likely to expect to give a\nbequest than offspring expected to receive one may\nalso reflect their psychological investment or stake\nin assuring the welfare of their children (Giarrusso,\nFeng, & Bengtson, 2004). In terms of the potential\nfor conflict around inheritance, lower expectations\nof offspring about future inheritance may be less\ndestructive following the parent's death than the\nopposite direction of differences (e.g., expectations\nof children are higher than parents' intentions).\nHowever, given that expectations surrounding\ninheritance can affect attitudes and behaviors\nregarding the inter-vivos support between parents\nand offspring, future studies are needed to exam-\nine how these generational differences in expecta-\ntions affect support exchanges over time.\nWe examined four sets of predictors for the\nbequest expectations: economic resources, fam-\nily characteristics, current support exchanges, and\nbeliefs about family obligation. Among economic\nresources, only parent's income was positively\nassociated with expectations on inheritance. This\nresult is consistent with prior studies suggesting\nthat bequest probability was not sensitive to chil-\ndren's characteristics, although parents are likely\nto respond to financial needs of children through\nimmediate inter-vivos transfers (McGarry, 1999).\nRegarding family characteristics, when there were\nmore children in the family, both members of the\ndyad were less likely to expect bequests.Again, this\nfinding is consistent with prior studies suggesting\nthe depletion of resources when there are more\nAlso, interestingly, we found that current sup-\nport given to a child had positive effects on inher-\nitance expectations, whereas support given to a\nparent was not significant. This result seems to be\ncontrary to the exchange hypothesis, which states\nthat bequests can be a compensation for the sup-\nport given to parents by children. Rather, it appears\nthat when more parental support is given to a child,\nthe dyads are more likely to expect an inheritance.\nThis result suggests a continuity of intergenera-\ntional transfers as part of the same decision-mak-\ning process leading to a bequest (McGarry, 1999).\nGiven the overwhelmingly asymmetric downward\ndirection of intergenerational transfers (from the\nupper to lower generations) over the life spans\nof both parents and children, adult families may\nrepeat their established transfer patterns based\non parents' altruism in their final transfers, rather\nthan based on reciprocity (Arrondel & Masson,\n2006). In addition, current downward support\nmay reflect offspring's needs for parental sup-\nport because inter-vivos transfers tend to be made\nin response to child's needs. Although variables\nregarding children's economic resources did not\nshow significant effects on inheritance expectation,\nthe findings about downward exchanges may be\nbecause of other needs, such as emotional support\nor practical assistance.\nBesides those factors commonly affecting\nbequest expectations for parents and children, we\nalso found that child's income, upward exchanges,\nand parent's gender had significant interactions\nwith generation.Thus, in forming one's own expec-\ntations over inheritance, parents and offspring\nappear to be influenced by these factors in dif-\nferent ways. Given that generation was no longer\nsignificant after entering the interaction terms, the\ndifferential effects of those factors appear to con-\ntribute to the generational differences observed in\nthe probability of expected inheritance.\nAlthough child's income and child-to-parent sup-\nport have been emphasized as the main variables\nto reveal the bequest motives, these two factors\nshowed differential effects by generation. The fact\nthat prior studies did not show consistent evidence\nabout the effects of these variables on the bequest\nbehaviors may be related to the differential effects\nof these variables within families. Regarding chil-\ndren' income, children who had higher levels of\nincome were less likely to expect an inheritance\nTable 4.

Thus, children appear to\nconsider their own financial situation in forming\nexpectations about inheritance, whereas parents\nplan for bequest regardless of children's income. In\naddition, when children are providing more help to\ntheir parents, children were less likely to expect to\nreceive an inheritance than the likelihood their par-\nents intended to leave a bequest. Contrary to the\nexchange hypothesis, if helping parents is caused by\nparents' needs and limited resources, it is less likely\nfor children to expect to receive an inheritance from\nparents. Caputo (2002) indicated that for adult\nchildren, providing support to aging parents may be\ndriven by needs of parents and filial responsibility,\nrather than expectations of future reciprocity on the\npart of their parents. Thus, the differential effects\nof these two variables may reflect issues about off-\nspring's resources. Offspring with more resources\nmay be less likely to expect inheritance as well as\nmore likely to provide support to their parents.\nIn addition, we found interaction effects of par-\nent's gender with generation on the inheritance\nexpectations, although gender was not a main\npredictor. Children were less likely to expect to\nreceive an inheritance from fathers. Given gen-\nder disparities in life expectancy, it may be that\nchildren consider that fathers' bequests are most\nlikely to go to their wives, who would be expected\nto survive longer than fathers (Clignet, 2009).\nThere was a surprising amount of discordance\nbetween parent's intention and child's expectation\nof an inheritance, with about a half of the dyads\ndisagreeing. The most common pattern of discord-\nance was that children do not expect to receive an\ninheritance, but their parents have the intention of\nleaving a bequest, whereas the most common pat-\ntern of concordance was that both parents and chil-\ndren expected an inheritance. Because the majority\nof parents (86%) expressed their bequest inten-\ntions, the dyadic correspondence patterns tended\nto be distinguished by whether children also had\nexpectations on inheritance. Our logistic regres-\nsion analysis of the two largest groups (\"yes\u00adyes\"\nvs. \"yes\u00adno\") found that parent's income, child's\nincome, downward exchanges, and child's filial\nobligation explained differences between the two\npatterns. Given that parents showed their inten-\ntion to leave a bequest in both groups we com-\npared, our analysis, in effect, can be interpreted as\nidentifying predictors for children's expectations\non inheritance when their parents have bequest\nintentions. First, regarding economic resources,\nwhen parents reported higher income and children\nreported lower income, children are more likely\nto expect an inheritance, which results in corre-\nspondence with parents' intention in their expec-\ntations. Unlike parents who tend to follow the\nequal division rule, children seem to consider their\nown economic status as well as parent's financial\navailability in their expectations over inheritances.\nSecond, when children are receiving more support\nfrom parents, they are likely to expect an inher-\nitance. Again, given that inheritance issues might\nbe an implicit agenda within families, current sup-\nport received from parent may provide a basis for\nchildren's expectations of the future inheritance.\nFinally, children with strong feelings of obligation\ntoward parent were less likely to expect an inher-\nitance. Because filial obligation reflects normative\nbeliefs that children are obligated to take responsi-\nbility for their aging parents without expectations\nfor anything in return, offspring with stronger\nbeliefs about filial obligation may not be concerned\nwith future bequests.\nThis study also has limitations. First, though the\nuse of information from multiple reporters offers\na unique opportunity to look at the correspond-\nence of the bequest expectations between parents\nand children, the parents who agreed to partici-\npate in this survey were different than parents who\ndid not participate, in terms of socioeconomic sta-\ntus, health, and relationship quality. Second, we\nfocused on parent\u00adchild dyads, but information on\nother family members (e.g., siblings) can be impor-\ntant beyond the dyad. Third, we used household\nincome and education as indicators of each genera-\ntion's economic situation. However, assets, savings,\nand debt should also be taken into account. Fourth,\ndue to the nature of a binary dependent variable,we\ncould not apply three-level models to deal with the\nshared variance within family for the 57 cases with\nreports about both mother and father. Fifth, we\nonly compared the two groups where parents have\ninheritance intentions in predicting dyadic corre-\nspondence of inheritance expectation. However,\ngiven cultural expectation that parents will leave\nan inheritance to their offspring, it may be more\ninteresting to examine situations under which par-\nents will not leave an inheritance to their children.\nFinally, we do not have expectations on how much\nparents intend to bequest and how much children\nexpect to receive. It would be interesting to exam-\nine the extent of concordance around the amount\nof inheritance, as well as to consider how much\nparents and children have discussed inheritance\nwith one another.\nThese findings showing discrepancies between\nparents and their middle-aged children in their\nexpectation over inheritance emphasize the impor-\ntance of understanding different perspectives from\nfamily members in intergenerational transfers. The\ndiscrepancies appear to reflect systematic differ-\nences in the way that parents and children form\ntheir intention or expectation about inheritance.\nAlthough concordance in expectations is not neces-\nsary for positive quality parent\u00adoffspring relation-\nships, discordance in these expectations could lead\nto conflict over inheritance issues. More detailed\ninformation, however, on factors such as amount\nof expected inheritance and how the inheritance\nis being divided among family members would be\nneeded to tease out the full implications of disa-\ngreement. Given the increasing diversity of families\nand the weakness of cultural norms surrounding\nfamily life, misunderstandings between the genera-\ntions about these issues are likely to become more\ncommon.\nFunding\nof intergenerational transfers\" (PI: Karen L.
