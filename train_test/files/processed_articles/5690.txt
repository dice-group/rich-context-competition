    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent investigations document a space number association effect in decisional processes of left-to-right reading cultures.\nHere, we expanded on this issue by studying motor decisional processes in a group of bilingual Iranians (i.e., which read\ntext from right to left and numbers from left to right) and a group of monolingual Australians, submitted to four different\nnumerical cues (i.e., digits written in Arabic, digits written in East Arabic, English number words, Farsi number words).\nAccording to previous evidence, we found that both Arabic digits and English number words affect the performance of the\nAustralian participants; on the contrary, no effect has been reported for all four codes in the performance of the Iranian\nparticipants. The current findings are discussed according to the absence of a consistence in the reading direction between\nnumbers and words (i.e., Iranian participants) as well as the specific Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI) adopted for displaying all four\ncodes.\n",

A consistent number of studies refer to the scanning\n(i.e., oculomotor) strategies linked to reading habits for\nexplaining the origin of this phenomenon. Scanning strate-\ngies might determine an overall visuospatial bias (Chokron\n& Imbert, 1993), which might make a left-to-right or a right-\nto-left SNARC effect more likely to be observed.\nThe first evidence in support of this assumption is pro-\nvided in the study by Dehaene et al. (1993). In this study, the\nauthors performed nine experiments to examine how numer-\nical magnitudes are associated with spatial response codes.\nThe results of this work show that the SNARC effect did not\nvary with handedness, or hemispheric dominance, but was\nlinked to the direction of writing. Specifically, a weaker\nSNARC was found in Iranian participants (i.e., which read\nwords from right to left), which correlated to the number of\nyears they spent in France.\nSubsequent studies have explored the SNARC effect with\nother populations characterized by no left to right reading\nhabit such as Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese (Chan &\nRussian-Hebrew (Shaki & Fischer, 2008), Palestinians and\nIsraelis (Shaki, Fischer, & Petrusic, 2009). These studies\nsuggest that different notations of the same quantity have\nflexible mappings within space, which is plausibly shaped by\nthe dominant context in which the numerical notations\nappear. However, the study by Shaki et al. (2009) showed\nthat the SNARC effect is only present when the reading\ndirections for numbers and words are consistent. In fact, the\nauthors found a SNARC effect only on Canadian (i.e., from\nleft to right) and Palestinian (i.e., from right to left) groups\nwhile they failed in finding this effect in the Israeli group,\nwhere the reading direction of words and digits are inconsis-\ntent (i.e., words are read from right to left and numbers from\nleft to right).\nSNARC seems also sensitive to finger counting strate-\ngies. In fact, several works (e.g., Fischer, 2008; Fischer &\nBrugger, 2011) have shown that sensorimotor practices, such\nas finger counting routines, do play a fundamental role in\ndetermining Spatial Numerical Associations. Interesting,\nthere is evidence suggesting a difference in counting strate-\ngies between Western and Eastern populations. The recent\nstudy by Lindemann, Alipour, and Fischer (2011) showed\nthat the 68% of the examined Western participants indicated\nto map the numbers 1 to 5 onto fingers of the left hand,\nwhereas the 63.4% of the Middle Eastern participants\n1Bangor University, Gwynedd, UK\n2International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste, Italy\n3University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nCarmelo Mario Vicario, Brigantia Building, Bangor University, Bangor,\nEmail: carmelo.vicario@uniroma1.it\nRandom Movements Generation in\nWestern and Eastern Cultures\nCarmelo Mario Vicario1,2,3, Giulia Sgubin2, and Anica Newman3\n Keywords\nWestern culture, Eastern culture, random movement generation, space number association\n2 SAGE Open\nreported an overall preference to start counting with the right\nhand.\nA space number association (SNA) like-effect has been\ndocumented also at decisional level. For example, Loetscher,\nSchwarz, Schubiger, and Brugger (2008) showed that lateral\nhead turning, which is known to affect spatial attention\n(Schindler & Kerkhoff, 1997; Vicario, Martino, Pavone, &\nFuggetta, 2011), influences numerical selection in Western\nparticipants asked to perform a Random Number Generation\n(RNG) task. Specifically, while facing left, participants pro-\nduced relatively small numbers, whereas while facing right,\nthey tended to produce larger numbers. Further work on\nShaki & Fischer, 2013) have documented a SNA like-effect\neven in motor decision-making tasks, such as the generation\nof random movement sequences. For example, Daar and\nPratt (2008) showed that low digits biased the voluntary\nselection of typing with their left hand, whereas high digits\nbiased the voluntary selection of typing with their right hand.\nSimilar results were found (Vicario, 2012) by using a ran-\ndom movement generation (RMG) paradigm (Jahanshahi &\nDirnberger, 1998). All these findings demonstrate that both\ntask-irrelevant sensory-motor manipulation (Loetscher et al.,\n2008) as well as the exposure to numbers (Daar & Pratt,\nnumerical) and motor decisional processes, against the par-\nticipants' efforts to be casual.\nIn the current study, we investigated the effect of the read-\ning direction habit, suggested by a particular numerical code,\nto the execution of a motor decisional task such as the RMG.\nIn particular, we tested the RMG (i.e., finger movement\nselection) performance in a group of bilingual Iranians,\nwhich are natively used not only to digits written in East\nArabic and Farsi language but also to both digits written in\nArabic and English (i.e., as their second language). In fact,\nIranian people habitually read Farsi texts from right to left,\nbut digits written in East Arabic from left to right. The choice\nof testing RMG in Iranian participants also allowed to inves-\ntigate any eventual effect related to their counting strategy\n(i.e., right to left), which is the most likely in this culture (see\nLindemann et al., 2011). Moreover, our Iranian participants\nwere familiar with Arabic numbers and fluent with the\nEnglish language (see the \"Participants\" section for more\ndetails), implying some familiarity with the left to right read-\ning. This is particularly relevant in the light of a recent study\n(Rashidi-Ranjbar, Goudarzvand, Jahangiri, Brugger, &\nLoetscher, 2014) showing that lateral head turning does not\naffect the random number selection in Iranian participants\nwith a low familiarity with the left-to-right reading direction\nhabit (i.e., participants were \"beginners\" for the English lan-\nguage). We also tested, with the same paradigm, a group of\nmonolingual Western participants (i.e., Australians partici-\npants). See Figure 1 for details about the visual codes used in\nthe study.\nThrough this study, we wanted to explore some theoreti-\ncal aspects not previously addressed: (a) investigate whether\nthe familiarity with the left-to-right reading direction habit,\nas might be argued from the results provided by Dehaene\net al. (1993), affects the RMG performance of Iranian par-\nticipants exposed to Arabic digits; (b) investigate whether\nthe exposure to English number words influences the RMG\nperformance as well as the exposure to number digits (Daar\nright-to-left finger counting strategy, which is more likely in\nthe Iranian sample (Lindemann et al., 2011), influences the\nRMG performance, with a particular regard for the exposure\nto Eastern numerical codes (i.e., East Arabic code and Farsi\nnumber code). This last issue appears particularly relevant\ngiven the adopted experimental paradigm (i.e., finger move-\nment's selection).\nParticipants and Method\nParticipants\nThirteen right-handed Iranian participants (6 men, 7 women,\nparticipants (control sample, 8 men, 9 women, M age = 23.5\n\u00b1 3.22) with normal or corrected vision participated in the\nresearch after providing written informed consent. Initially,\nit was planned to recruit an equal number of participants for\nboth groups. However, this proved to be unachievable due to\nthe limited availability of Iranian participants at the\nInternational School for Advanced Studies (Trieste, Italy).\nMost of the Iranian participants were PhD students. All par-\nticipants were born in Iran from Iranian parents and had ini-\ntially studied in their own country of origin, before living in\nItaly. All participants were familiar with Arabic numbers and\nfluent with the English language (the average number of\nyears elapsed since they started studying English was 19.54\n\u00b1 2.50). Moreover, three participants had \"beginner\" knowl-\nedge of the Italian language. The control group was recruited\nat the University of Queensland, Brisbane (Australia), among\nundergraduate and graduate students. We did not adopt sta-\ntistical procedures for determining the sample size of\nFigure 1. The four types of numerical cues (Arabic, East Arabic,\nEnglish numerical words, Farsi numerical words).\nVicario et al. 3\nAustralian participants. We decided to test 17 participants in\nagreement of the previous study by Vicario (2012), which\nhas adopted the same task. Verbal informed consent was\nobtained from all participants. The investigation has been\nconducted according to the principles expressed in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nProcedure and Instruments\nIranian participants were positioned 50 cm from an Olidata\ncomputer 21 monitor configured at a refresh rate of 60 Hz.\nAustralian participants were positioned 50 cm from a Dell\ncomputer 21 monitor configured at a refresh rate of 60 Hz.\nVisual stimuli were presented in four separate blocks (coun-\nterbalanced design) and were each composed of six numeri-\ncal codes (low numbers: 1-2; middle numbers: 4-6; high\nArabic, English, or Farsi. Visual stimuli were casually pre-\nsented according to an Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI) of 300\nms. This ISI, which marked the temporal pace for the random\nfinger movements selection task, was chosen according to\nthe evidence provided in a recent work (Vicario, 2012),\nshowing that numbers affect RMG performance only when\nthe ISI is set at 300 ms. Participants were explicitly asked to\nsynchronize their responses with the visual stimulus dis-\nplacement. In particular, they were asked to respond to\nnumerical cues presented on the computer screen by pressing\none among eight keys of the keyboard (left keys: A, S, D, F;\nright keys: H, J, K, L) with one of their eight fingers (the\nindex, the middle, the ring, and the pinkie of both left and\nright hands). Thus, the \"go\" signal to move a finger was rep-\nresented by the numerical cue itself. The numerical cue dis-\nappeared once the participant pressed the selected key. Each\nblock consisted of a total of 60 trials (10 per numerical cue)\ndisplayed on the center of the computer screen. The depen-\ndent variable was the frequency with which a finger move-\nment selection was made following the presentation of low\n(1, 2), middle (4, 6), and high numbers (8, 9). All participants\nwere submitted to a training block of 30 trials before starting\nthe experimental session.\nData Analysis\nThe amount of finger movements generated with the left and\nthe right hand while looking at low, middle, and high num-\nbers was analyzed via repeated-measures ANOVA. In par-\nticular, we were interested in investigating the effect of these\nfour codes on the RMG performance of our participants.\nThus, we performed a within-subjects analysis to address\nquestions discussed in the \"Introduction\" section. In particu-\nlar, the within-subjects analysis consisted of two separated\nANOVA (one for each group), in which we compared the\nRMG performance for all types of visual stimulus. Thus, for\neach single ANOVA, we considered the following factors:\nthe numerical magnitude (i.e., low, middle, high), the type of\ncode (i.e., Arabic numbers, East Arabic numbers, English\nnumber words, Farsi number words), and the Response\nselection (left, right). Post hoc comparisons were performed\nusing t test. For all tests, the level of statistical significance\nwas set at p < .05. Data analysis was performed using\nStatistica software, version 8.0, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,\nResults\nIranian Participants\nThe repeated-measures ANOVA did not reveal a significant\nused the right fingers more (M = 10.58) frequently than left\nfingers (M = 9.42).

In particular, left fingers were\nused more frequently than right fingers when looking at low\nquantity (p = .038); vice versa, right fingers were moved\nmore frequently than left fingers when looking at high num-\nbers (p = .038). No significant differences were detected for\nthe other East Arabic and the Farsi number codes. See\nFigure 3 for details about the average movement frequency\ndetected for all codes.\nDiscussion\nSeveral works recognize a central role to the reading direc-\ntion habit in the mental assessment of numerical magnitude.\nThe SNARC effect has been considered the most relevant\nexperimental evidence in support of this view. However, this\nrole has been re-evaluated in the light of recent works (see\nFischer & Brugger, 2011, for a discussion on this argument).\nFor example, a recent study involving bilingual Russian-\nHebrew readers (Fischer, Shaki, & Cruise, 2009) has shown\nthat merely reading a single Cyrillic or Hebrew word,\nchanged their SNA from 1 s to the next, clearly indicating\nthat effects of reading are much more fragile than originally\nSeveral studies have documented a strict interaction\nbetween motor system and numerical representation (Fischer,\nas well as the relationship between quantity, space, and deci-\nsional processes (Loetscher, Bockisch, Nicholls, & Brugger,\n2013). In this regard, spatial attention mechanisms might\nplay a key role in explaining these forms of interaction in the\nVicario, Caltagirone, & Oliveri, 2007; Vicario & Martino,\nVicario, Rappo, Pepi, & Oliveri, 2009; Vicario, Rappo, Pepi,\nPavan, & Martino, 2012). In fact, the mere sight of a number\nwould induce a spatial attentional bias, which depends on its\nmagnitude, with low numbers shifting attention to the left\nFigure 2. The RMG performance of the Iranian participants for all four codes.\nNote. The graph plots the average number of finger movements on the exposure to high, middle, and low numbers. Vertical bars indicate standard error.\nRMG = random movement generation.\nVicario et al. 5\nand high numbers shifting attention to the right space\n(Fischer, Castel, Dodd, & Pratt, 2003). This, in turn, could\ninfluence spatially encoded decisional processes.\nthe authors investigated the random movement selection per-\nformance, respectively, in Canadian and Italian participants\nwhile looking at Arabic digits. The results showed that left\nhand/fingers were moved more frequently while looking at\nlow with respect to high numerical digits. Vice versa, a\nhigher frequency in moving right hand/fingers while looking\nat high with respect to low numerical digits was\ndocumented.\nIn the current study, we used a RMG task to explore the\neffect of four different numerical codes (i.e., Western vs.\nEastern) on the motor decisional processes of two groups of\nparticipants (i.e., Iranians and Australians) to address the fol-\nlowing arguments:\ni. whether the RMG performance is affected by numer-\nical words as well as by digits (Daar & Pratt, 2008;\nii. (for the Iranian participants only) whether the high\nfamiliarity with the Arabic number code and with a\nlanguage characterized by a left-to-right reading\ndirection (i.e., the English language) induces a\nSNA effect in the RMG performance while looking\nat Arabic numerical codes. This question is timely\nin the light of the results recently provided by\nRashidi-Ranjbar et al. (2014) showing that the\nmodulation of spatial attention focus, via lateral\nhead turning, does not affect the RNG performance\nof Iranian participants with a low familiarity with\nthe left-to-right reading habit, although previous\nevidence in Western populations (Loetscher et al.,\niii. investigate whether the right-to-left finger counting\nstrategy, which is the most likely in Iranian sample\n(Lindemann et al., 2011), might exert some kind of\ninfluence in the current decision-making task, which\ninvolves finger movements.\nResults suggest,\ni. The interaction between numbers and motor deci-\nsional processes is specific for Western cultures and\ndoes not affect the performance of the examined\nFigure 3.

Even numerical words affect RMG, although only in\nthe Western sample.\niii. The right-to-left finger counting strategy, which is\nthe most common in the Iranian sample (Lindemann\net al., 2011), does not affect performance in the exe-\ncution of the current finger movements selection\ntask.\nIn detail, talking about the performance of the Australian\nsample, we found that digits written in Arabic code affect the\nRMG performance, like in previous works (Daar & Pratt,\nfingers were moved more frequently while looking at low\nquantities and right hand fingers were moved more fre-\nquently while looking at high quantities. This provides sup-\nport to the reliability of the current quantity/motor\ndecision-making interaction across different Western cul-\ntures (i.e., Canadian people, Daar & Pratt, 2008; Italian peo-\nple, Vicario, 2012; Australian people, in the current work).\nMoreover, the effect sizes (i.e., medium effect size) reported\nin the current work lead to argue that the current effect of\nnumber on RMG has a fair reliability.\nA novel result refers to the evidence of a similar effect on\nRMG performance in association to the exposure to English\nnumber words. This agrees with previous evidence showing\nvisuo-motor effects of both digits and number words\n(Calabria & Rossetti, 2005) on the performance of healthy\nhumans. No effects on the RMG performance were reported\nfor the other two codes (i.e., digits written in East Arabic and\nFarsi number words).\nFinally, talking about the RMG performance of the Iranian\nparticipants, no significant effects have been reported in\nassociation to all four codes. This result leads to argue the\nfollowing remarks:\ni. The familiarity with a left-to-right reading direction\nhabit (like in the case of our Iranian participants)\ndoes not induce a SNA like-effect in the RMG,\nalthough previous evidence (Dehaene et al., 1993)\nshows that the familiarity with a left-to-right reading\ndirection habit (like in the case of our Iranian partici-\npants) leads likely the occurrence of a SNARC effect;\nii. the right-to-left counting strategy, which is the most\nlikely in Iranian people (see Lindemann et al., 2011),\nresults irrelevant in influencing the execution of the\ncurrent finger movements selection task.\nOverall, the absence of a numbers/motor decisional pro-\ncesses interaction in the Iranian sample corroborates the\nreading direction inconsistency hypothesis proposed by\nShaki et al. (2009) documenting no SNA effect in popula-\ntions (i.e., Israelis) characterized by a reading direction\ninconsistency for word and digit numbers. In fact, a similar\nreading direction inconsistency is also reported for the\nEastern codes used by Iranian populations (i.e., digits written\nin East Arabic code are read from left to right; number words\nwritten in Farsi are read from right to left). Alternatively, the\nabsence of effects in the RMG performance of the Iranian\nsample could be due to the particular ISI (i.e., 300 ms)\nselected for presenting the four different numerical codes in\nthe computer screen. In fact, this particular ISI was chosen\naccording to the result provided by Vicario (2012) with\nWestern participants (i.e., Italian participants). In particular,\none could hypothesize that Western codes (i.e., Arabic\nnumerical codes and English number words) did not affect\nRMG of Iranian participants because the processing of these\ntwo codes might have required a longer ISI to affect the\nRMG performance. This suggestion is motivated by the rela-\ntively lower familiarity of the Iranian participants with\nWestern codes (their exposure was limited to a school con-\ntext) compared with the Eastern codes. In this sense, we can-\nnot exclude that the current ISI might not be appropriate to\ndisclose any eventual effect played by the exposure to\nWestern codes on the RMG performance in the Iranian\nsample.\nFuture works devoted in the investigation of this research\ntopic in right-to-left reading habit cultures might clarify this\nissue by using longer ISI. Moreover, it would be critical that\nthe adoption of statistical procedures for determining, in\nadvance, the size of the samples to be tested, to verify the\nresearch hypothesis. The absence of this procedure is cur-\nrently a limit of our work.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBadets, A., & Pesenti, M.
