For clarity, the investigator\nused Northouse leadership approach to understand the leadership in the current Nigerian leadership situation. Twelve\npast and present leaders in the government operations of the Eastern Region of Nigeria participated in the study, and the\nleadership assessment instrument survey questionnaire was used to support the study. While the study showed a great need\nfor change in leadership, the results of the study revealed that most of the leaders and policy makers in the Eastern Region\nof the country lack effective leadership skills for the positions they hold.

It is made of three major ethnic tribes, the\nHausas (occupying the north), the Yoruba (occupying the\nwest), and the Ibos (occupying the east). It has a total area of\nboundaries (Udogu, 2001). Culturally, Nigeria is the most\npopulated country in Africa; its population has risen above\n160 million. The population is extremely diverse with well\npeople. Most of its population is concentrated in the southern\npart of the country, as well as in the area of dense settlement\naround Kano in the north. Between the two areas is a sparsely\nHistorically, the Republic of Nigeria came under colonial\nrule of the British (United Kingdom) during the second half\nof the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century,\nmaking English its common language. The British depen-\ndencies of Northern and Southern Nigeria were merged into\na single territory in 1914, commonly known as the amalga-\nmation of northern and southern Nigeria. On October 1,\n1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the British rule.\nToday, Nigeria is a democratic nation with freedom of reli-\ngion. While 50% of the population is associated with Islamic\nworship, Christianity and African Traditional practice com-\nCulturally, Nigeria is a multitribal system in which every\ntribe wants to excel or suppress the other, so they are not on\nthe same level playgrounds. Every person in politics is\nregionalized and people are capitalizing on that. Once lead-\nership is zoned in the country, one cannot expect to get the\nbest, but Nigerians are trying to live with what they presently\nhave. There are more than 300 different tribal groups in\nNigeria, all of which belong to the political definition\n\"Nigerian\" but are distinct from one another in terms of cul-\ntural practices. Added to this are economic disparities among\nthe various groups, as well as potential for conflict on reli-\ngious grounds, especially between the long-established\nMuslim population and the rapidly growing Christian\nsector.\nSince its independence in 1960, civil war, military coup\nd'\u00e9tat, and consequent military governments have created a\nNigerian political environment that is not always seen as\n1Wayland Baptist University, Fairbanks, AK, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDr. Nichodemus O.

These circumstances have constantly destabilized and\njeopardized Nigeria's democracy as well as the political\nstates that border Nigeria. There has been a constant and\nutter lack of rule of law on the part of the government and the\ngoverned. The most urgent issues in Nigeria today are the\nlack of management of the public trust, corruption, govern-\nment instability, and the maintenance of decaying simple\namenities and infrastructures in the nation. The issue of the\nupsurge of corruption is endemic and troubling. Transparency\nInternational consistently rates the levels of corruption in\nNigeria among the highest in the world. Pervasive corruption\nappears to permeate many levels of the Nigerian society (Eti,\nHargreaves (2002) in discussing about the ways of\nimproving basic health care in Nigeria claimed that Nigeria,\nonce heralded as the beacon of Africa, has fallen somewhat\nshort of this potential. Years of plutocratic repressive dicta-\ntors and military rule, coupled with widespread corruption,\nhave resulted in large-scale neglect and deterioration of pub-\nthe giant was brought to its knees by 20 years of brutal and\ncorrupt military rule, which left a legacy of executive dominance\nand a political corruption in the hands of Nigeria's so-called\n\"godfathers\"--powerful political bosses sitting atop vast\npatronage networks who view the government primarily through\nthe lens of their own personal enrichment. (p. 73)\nAccording to Eicher and Liedholm (1970), the pressing\nproblems of everyday survival remain the highest immediate\npriority. Since the oil boom of the 1970s, the nation's\neconomy has been in crisis despite continued expansion in\noil production. Inefficiency in governance has further dete-\nriorated the Nigerian economy. Political instability and lack\nof proper accountability in the country have severely impeded\nthe ability of successive governments to implement eco-\nnomic policies for the common good of the people, thus cre-\nating a lack of basic amenities for the people in the country.\nFor Kirk-Greene and Rimmer (1981), the solution for\naddressing Nigeria's problems and consolidating democratic\ngovernance in the federal republic lies in having a govern-\nment or leadership that works on the principles of good gov-\nernance and is, most importantly, accountable to the Nigerian\npeople. Good governance in Nigeria is essential to its stabil-\nity and growth and that of the economies of West African\ncountries in the Subregion. While corruption and abuse of\npower long have been features of Nigeria's economic and\npolitical landscapes, they do not have to remain in the coun-\ntry's future. Studies designed to examine the positive chal-\nlenges of good leadership as an ongoing leadership process\n(Northouse, 2004) may have application to Nigeria's future.\nIn addition, more scientific studies as well as understanding\nfrom the experience of past and present Eastern Nigerian\nleaders will help highlight more specifically the problems of\nNigeria's leadership. Figure 1 shows some of the major prob-\nlems that are associated with the current situation in the\ncountry.\nThese identified problems are affecting the common peo-\nple as well as increasing the wave of corruptions and misman-\nagement in most regions of the country. The current leadership\nsituation in Nigeria is associated with chaos and conflicts.\nFigure 1. Major problems that are associated with the current situation in the country.\nThis study continues to explore the current challenges\namong elected leaders in Nigeria. The people of Nigeria, like\nmost people in other developing countries in Africa have\nbeen disadvantaged and neglected by their elected leaders,\nlawmakers, and politicians. Many Nigerian leaders are faced\nwith the dilemma of meeting the needs of its poor millions,\nwho have to eke out their living from primary productive\nactivities and maintain the integrity of natural resource and\nthe environment. These leaders have misrepresented and\nignored the voice of the people, the common good, peace,\nand stability of the country, and have equally hindered most\npeople from economic growth and opportunities due to their\nrace, lack of skill, greed, and power. They sometimes create\nobstacles to future growth and vision of the country. Lipset\nand Lenz (2000) stated that cultures that stress economic\nsuccesses as an important goal but, nevertheless, strongly\nrestrict access to opportunities will have higher levels of\ncorruption.\nIn assessing the leadership situation in Nigeria, Adejimi\n(2005) indicated that in Nigeria, most of the policy makers as\nwell as those involved in decision making are engaged in\nbribery, egoism, power, and trade liberalization. They are\ndistracted to an extent that they forget the nation's policies\naimed at improving the lives of people in the society.\nAlthough people in a normal society are expected to be hon-\nest, law-abiding and hardworking, instead, in the Eastern\nRegion of Nigeria, the lukewarm and unethical attitude of\nsome of their leaders (and those who are supposed to main-\ntain and enforce law and order) are leading the people to\nengage in corrupt behaviors.\nWhile some studies have provided insight into the con-\nstraints and obstacles that many Nigerians, especially people\nin the Eastern Region of Nigeria, experience in the hands of\nbad leaders, there is a need for more studies regarding effec-\ntive leadership and accountability to enable improvements\nand leadership capabilities on their leaders and policy mak-\ners.Agreat number of leaders and policy makers are occupied\nwith mismanagement and poor leadership skills in their\nadministration of the country. They neglect and ignore poli-\ncies that are aimed at improving the standard of living among\nthe people of the region. This research, guided by the leader-\nship approach of Northouse, centered specifically on a\nselected group of 12 past and current leaders of the Eastern\nRegion of Nigeria in an attempt to understand their leadership\npractices, experiences, and involvements in the operation of\nthe Nigerian government. This study was meant to enable the\npresent leaders and policy makers to better understand the\nprocess of leadership as it affects the people of the country\nwith regard to its perspectives, challenges, and realities.\nSupport of Literature\nThe study was aimed at understanding the perception and\nviews of some past and current government leaders toward\npeople in leadership as well as how decision-making process\noperates in the Eastern Region of Nigeria, in their response\nto the challenges of leadership and mismanagement in their\nnation. In this regard, it is of vital importance to understand\nsome of the main factors, especially religion, history, tribal,\nethnicity, power, colonialism, as well as political, get-rich-\nsyndrome, fraud, and corruption elements that have contin-\nued to undermine good leadership in the Nigerian situation.\nThese factors and others have contributed greatly to the\ninstability, poverty, and suffering among the people of the\nnation.\nThe review of related literatures in this study reveals a\ngreat concern for enhancing the understanding of the current\nimpact of leadership in Nigeria and the challenges the peo-\nple are experiencing due to poor governance and manage-\nment in the entire country. The literature review consists of\nfive main sections, namely (a) cultural and historical con-\ntext, (b) understanding decision-making process, (c) social\nreform, (d) ethical standards, and (e) the Northouse leader-\nship process. The literature review enabled the author to\nidentify a resemblance, what has been done and what needs\nto be investigated with regard to the topic. For instance,\nsome recent studies have suggested that Nigeria is a corrupt\nand a mismanaged country that needs attention as well as an\neffective leader. The country needs people who are edu-\ncated, sincere, and honest in administration and leadership\nRegardless of where corruption occurs, the individual or\ngroup involved, and what causes it or the form it takes, the\nfacts and outcomes still remain that, in Nigeria, corruption\nhas contributed immensely to greed, mistrust, insecurity, and\ninjustice, as well as to the poverty and the misery of a large\nsegment of the nation's population. In the views of Lipset\nand Lenz (2000), poverty and income inequalities are tied to\ncorruption. According to Walter (1990), Nigeria is the giant\nof Africa and many of its outstanding leaders have been kept\nin prison or in exile for the sake of criminal act and embez-\nzlement of public funds, as well as lack of accountability and\ngood leadership. Corruption is responsible in a large measure\nfor broken promises, the dashed hopes and shallow dreams\nthat have characterized the lives of most Nigerians in the past\nfew decades, he noted, adding that Nigeria was unlikely to\nmeet the Millennium Development Goals (Walter, 1990).\nMismanagement, government irregularities, and corrup-\ntion in Nigeria and other developing countries are among the\nmajor problems of national growth and development. These\nproblems and their practices occur in nearly every level of\nbureaucracy, ministries, departments, and polity, as well as in\nthe upper and lower administrations and agencies in the\nnation. In the mind of McMullan (1970), a public official is\ncorrupt if he accepts money or money equivalent for doing\nsomething that he is under duty to do anywhere, that he is\nunder duty not to do, or to exercise a legitimate discretion for\nimproper reasons (McMullan, 1970). Corruption and ineffi-\nciency in public services are linked to weak governance and\nleadership. The political and economic environment of a\n4 SAGE Open\ncountry determines, to a large extent, the standard and qual-\nity of its public services and administrations. There is virtual\nagreement among observers that corruption and political and\neconomic instability have been responsible for derailing\nNigeria's growth and development and primarily explain the\nsuffering and poverty in the country. Leaders and decision\nmakers in Nigeria should understand that a leader is one who\ncan lead a group of people to accomplish common goals in\nthe right direction, with cost efficiency, within the time\nframe, and achieve the desired outcomes (Nahavandi, 2004).\nCultural and Historical Context\nThe understanding of the culture of the people of any group is\nan authentic way of knowing them. In the views of Frake\n(1977), culture is not simply a cognitive map that people\nacquire, in whole or in part, more or less accurately, and then\nlearn to read. People are not just map-readers; they are map-\nmakers. People are cast out continually into imperfectly\ncharted seas of everyday life. Mapping them out is a constant\nprocess resulting not in an individual cognitive map, but in a\nwhole chart case of rough, improvised, continually revised\nsketch maps. Culture does not provide a cognitive map, but\nrather a set of principles for map making and navigation.\nDifferent cultures are like different schools of navigation\ndesigned to cope with different terrains and seas (Frake, 1977).\nIn every collectivistic cultural perspective, leaders have a\nmoral responsibility to take care of their followers and help\nthem develop their personal cares, to be a consultant for fol-\nlowers' personal problems (Bass, 1995). The Nigerian sys-\ntem is regimented and the people are following a system that\nis slightly different from our cultural way of doing things, the\nwesternized system is slightly interfering with their own sys-\ntem, but they are trying to cope with what it has produced.\nNigeria is a multitribal system where every tribe wants to\nexcel or suppress the other, and so they are not really on the\nsame level playgrounds. Every person in politics is regional-\nized and people are capitalizing on that. Once the govern-\nment officials start zoning leadership they will not expect to\nget the best, but in Nigerian situation most people are trying\nto live with what they presently have.\nThe beliefs and cultural values can affect and influence\nthe practice of leadership in any country or region. Leaders\nmust understand their own values and ensure, through their\nconsistent behavior, that they reflect their value and share\ntheir vision with their followers (Pielstick, 1998). Morgan\n(1997) described culture as an active living phenomenon,\nthrough which people jointly create and recreate the world in\nwhich they live. It is the hope of the researcher that in this\nstudy, strong, effective workable leadership techniques will\nbe uncovered to help the Nigerian leaders and policy makers\nto a new level of understanding and a standard management\nof the country.\nCulture comprised the assumptions, values, norms, peo-\nple, and their behavior. Each aspect of a cultural element can\nbe seen as a very important environmental condition affect-\ning the system and subsystem in any society. In the views of\nEdgar Schein (1993), culture is a pattern of a shared basic\nassumptions that the group learned as it solved its problems\nof external adaptation and internal integration, that has\nworked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to\nbe taught to new members as the correct way to perceive,\nthink, and feel in relation to those problems. Nigerian leaders\nshould be able to understand the diversity of tribes, tradition,\ncustoms, and languages of the different people in Nigeria to\nenhance a better and comprehensive leadership style and\neffectiveness in governance of the people. The people's cul-\nture is very important and what they think ought to be done\nCultural values and beliefs affect the practice of leader-\nship development, which relates to the values, beliefs, hopes,\nand fears of human existences. In Nigeria, culture is a phe-\nnomenon that surrounds the people as well as the nation's\nheritage. Both culture and leadership are intertwined. Many\npeople believe in their customs and traditions as a guide to\ntheir way of life. Culture is the sharing of values and beliefs\nof a society established through the interaction of human\nthinking, feeling, and action. In highly collective societies,\nsuch as Japan, the Philippines, Ghana, Guatemala, Nigeria or\nEcuador, where the social bond among members is very\nstrong, and people look out for one another, a strong patri-\narch at the top of the social hierarchy tends to emerge as an\neffective leader. Such a leader is not only accepted by the\nfollowers but is also expected to protect their interests.\nPeople who have different cultural norms and values require\ndifferent leadership styles. Thus, there are no good or bad\nIn discussing the current leadership situation of Nigeria,\nFagbadebo (2007) stated that the Nigerian State is a victim of\nhigh-level corruption, bad governance, political instability,\nand a cyclical legitimacy crisis. The country's authoritarian\nleadership faced a legitimacy crisis, political intrigues, in an\nethnically differentiated polity, where ethnic competition for\nresources drove much of the pervasive corruption, and prof-\nligacy. While the political gladiators constantly manipulated\nthe people and the political processes to advance their own\nselfish agenda, the society remained pauperized, and the\npeople wallowed in abject poverty. This invariably led to\nweak legitimacy, as the citizens lacked faith in their political\nleaders and by extension, the political system.\nGoodling (2003) in discussing Nigeria's crisis of corrup-\ntion maintained that Transparency International consistently\nrates the levels of corruption in Nigeria among the highest in\nthe world and pervasive corruption appears to permeate\nmany levels of the Nigerian society. Nigeria was positioned\nat the bottom of Transparency International's most corrupt\nBoth the outgoing and current administrations expressed\ncommitment to stamp out official corruption in the country.\nAccording to Ake (1995), decades of efforts have yielded\nlargely stagnation, regression or worse. The tragic conse-\nquences of this are increasingly clear: a rising tide of poverty,\ndecaying public utilities and infrastructures, social tensions\nand political turmoil, and now, premonition of inevitable\ndrive into conflict and violence.\nDespite being the eighth largest oil producers in the world,\nNigeria has the world's third largest poverty level (Goodling,\n2003). If these problems are not adequately addressed and\nchallenged, the whole nation will remain in chaos. Without\nadjusting the attitude of the people and without changing our\n\"enormous moral deficit\" our \"moral and social disorder\"\nwill not be mended (Etzioni, 1994, p. 9). In his opinion,\nAdeseyoju (2006) maintained that corruption is far more\ndangerous than drug trafficking or other crimes because\nwhen it goes unpunished, the public loses confidence in the\nlegal system and those who enforce the law.\nCulture, the accumulated shared learning from shared his-\ntory, focuses attention on the human side of the nation's life\nand thereby makes clear the importance of creating an appro-\npriate system of shared meaning to help people work together\ntoward desired goals and outcomes. Culture requires the\npeople, especially the leaders, to acknowledge the impact of\ntheir behavior on their environment (Schein, 1993). The\nunderstanding of the people's culture and history can enable\nany competent leader in any nation, institution or organiza-\ntion to exhibit courage: the courage to embrace complexity,\nto stop reducing racial relations as ineffective, and to increase\nthe possibility of building bridges, managing conflict, and\nfinding common ground in the nation.\nIn a nation or culture that stresses participation and auton-\nomy, the function of top leadership is not to control but to\nsupport, encourage, and make available hands-on coaching\nand consultation to help citizens and employees avoid unnec-\nessary frustration and waste of efforts, to increase task-rele-\nvant knowledge and skills, and to formulate uniquely\nappropriate performance strategies that result in process\nSituating the Northouse Leadership Process\nMost definitions and descriptions of leadership by different\npeople imply that there should be a good understanding\nbetween leaders and their followers to achieve their desired\ngoals and objectives. Leadership is all about getting people\nto work together to make things happen that might not other-\nwise occur or prevent that which ordinarily would take place.\nNorthouse (2004) defined leadership as a process consisting\nof transactions between the leader and the followers: a pro-\ncess whereby an individual influences a group of individuals\nto achieve a common goal. The paradigm of Northouse sug-\ngests that leadership is a process that is ongoing and dynamic\nin understanding leaders and followers as it affects the situa-\ntion in Nigerian structure. Leadership involves influence; it\noccurs in a group context and involves some form of goal\nattainment.\nThe author used the Northouse leadership approach to\nguide the study. The Northouse approach to leadership\nclearly explained the nature of leadership as well as what is\nexpected of an effective leader. The paradigm of Northouse,\nwhich states that leadership is a process whereby an indi-\nvidual influences a group of individuals to achieve a com-\nmon goal (Northouse, 2004) clearly focused on the leadership\nstyle needed in Nigeria. It conceptualizes and identifies the\nfive basic elements common to the phenomenon of leader-\nship. These five components include the following elements\nand themes that form the core \"consensus\" components of\nhow leadership is currently conceptualized in the views of\nNorthouse: (a) leadership is a process, (b) leadership emerges\nout of a reciprocal relationship of influence, (c) leadership\noccurs in a community or group context, (d) leadership\ninvolves goal attainment around shared visions, purposes,\nand values, (e) leadership is intentional about making real or\nconcrete change.\nThe aforementioned components of leadership as\nexplained in the Northouse paradigm suggest that leadership\nis a process that is ongoing and dynamic in understanding\nleaders and followers in an organization or institution. When\napplied to Nigeria, this conceptualization rightly suits the\nsituation. Northouse (2004) claimed that\nAlthough leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader\nwho often initiates the relationship, creates the communication\nlinkages, and carries the burden for maintaining the relationship.\nThe leadership style in Nigeria is not working effectively\nand could be addressed through the guidelines of the\nNorthouse concept of leadership. Leaders and followers are\ninvolved in effective leadership processes. Leaders need fol-\nlowers and followers need leaders to accomplish desired\nUnderstanding Decision-Making Process\nA good understanding and the establishment of sound deci-\nsions and policies are very important for leadership reform.\nThus, growth dynamics cannot simply be measured in eco-\nnomic terms. Positive criteria for growth and reform in\nNigerian leadership must include governance, efficiency,\naccountability, and democracy of institutions, as well as\ninvolvement of the people. Most of the issues in the country\ncan be linked to poor decisions and bad policies from the\nleaders, and policy makers. Decision makers must first\ndecide on their values and set goals to insure a fruitful deci-\nsion-making process. Their decisions fashion the environ-\nment in which the people of the nation live. Therefore,\nbefore taking any course of action, leaders must discover or\ncreate a set of alternative courses of action and gather infor-\nmation about each. Having gathered the information with\nwhich to make a decision, they must apply information for\n6 SAGE Open\neach course of action to predict the outcomes of each pos-\nsible alternative and make a decision for implementation\nFor Kirk-Greene and Rimmer (1981), the solution for\naddressing problems and consolidating democratic gover-\nnance in the federal republic of Nigeria lies in having gov-\nernment or leadership that works on the principles of good\ngovernance and, especially, is accountable to the Nigerian\npeople. Many Nigerians who are highly achievement ori-\nented have been relatively reduced to low access economic\nopportunities in the current leadership situation in the coun-\ntry. Good governance in Nigeria is thus essential to its stabil-\nity and growth and that of the economies of West African\ncountries in the Subregion. The apparent lack of confidence\nin the bureaucratic and political processes is a reflection of\nthe poor governance that has characterized the system for\ndecades.\nIn today's society, organizational leadership, decision\nmaking, growth, effective management, and organizational\nsuccess are based on the quality of the decisions policy mak-\ners or leaders make. In any country where legal systems fail\nto protect the rights of groups and individuals, the risk of vio-\nlence and conflict are bound to increase. For Nigerians, effec-\ntive leadership and good governance must be for the Nigerian\nleaders and decision makers the direct result of knowing their\ncriteria for success, the scope of their choices and the inherent\nrisk of each alternative (Nelson & Quick, 2003).\nThere is a great need for the development and establish-\nment of proper decision, rule of law and leadership styles\namong the country's leaders and decision makers that will\ninclude a review of the existing policies, strategies and stan-\ndards to ensure that managers and government officials will\ncontinue to achieve efficient and effective management roles\nin the country. According to Kotter (1990), leaders must\nknow how to lead as well as manage. Otherwise, without\nleading as well as managing effectively, today's organiza-\ntions face the threat of extinction. While leadership involves\nchange, inspiration, motivation, and influence, management\nand effective leadership must focus on the process of setting\nand achieving the goals of the nation through the functions of\nmanagement, with reference to strategic planning, organiz-\ning, directing, and controlling.\nNigerian leaders and decision makers should be influ-\nenced by collaborators while working together to achieve the\ncommon goal of the nation. Nahavandi (2004) claimed that a\nleader is anyone who influences individuals or groups within\nan organization, helps them in the establishment of goals,\nand guides them toward achievement of those goals, thereby\nenabling them to be effective.\nSocial Reforms\nNigerian leaders need clear and comprehensive social reform\nto break the cycle of inefficiency in leadership. For a suc-\ncessful reform to take place in Nigeria accountability and\ntransparency have to be guaranteed and the people have to be\ninvolved in issues that affect their lives and immediate envi-\nronment. It was obvious to the author, that one of the major\nreasons for the current leadership deficiency in the Eastern\nRegion of Nigeria and in the whole country in general is that\nmany Nigerians have not had the simple opportunity to live\nand operate in an environment that is under the rule of law. In\nthe views of Edward De Bono (1990), law and order are the\nbasic part of the fabric of society, and the society needs to\ngive priority to this aspect of life because poor quality here\ndowngrades everything else in the systemic network of the\nplace.\nNorthouse (2004) suggested that sociability refers to lead-\ners' inclination to seek out pleasant social relationships.\nLeaders who show sociability are friendly, outgoing, courte-\nous, tactful, and diplomatic. They are sensitive to others'\nneeds and show concern for their well-being. Social leaders\nhave good interpersonal skills and create cooperative rela-\ntionships with their followers. According to Fagbadebo\n(2007), transparency and accountability in governance will\nincrease the sense of national community as well as the level\nof system affect.\nAke (1995) has rightly suggested that \"democratization of\nconsiderable depth\" would be necessary to halt the impedi-\nments created by the problems of poor governance. To ensure\nmore and better government responsiveness, civil society\nactors who have all the capacity to compel their leaders to be\naccountable to them should brace up for the challenge.\nDeliberate and conscious efforts, borne out of patriotism, are\nneeded to ensure the emergence of a virile civil society. An\ninformed civil society is of vital importance to balance the\npowers of the Nigerian State. For successful reform to occur\nin Nigerian leadership, leaders and decision makers must\npossess problem-solving skills. According to Mumford,\nZaccaro, and Harding (2000), problem-solving skills refer to\na leader's creative ability to solve new and unusual, ill-\ndefined organizational problems. Nigeria needs problem-\nsolving skills of leaders to help fight fraud and corruption in\nthe country.\nTo truly clean up the bad leadership and corruption,\nNigeria needs sound ethical leadership that is rooted in\nrespect, service, justice, honesty, and community. Leaders\nwho place fairness at the center of decision making, includ-\ning the challenging task of being fair to individuals as well as\nto the common interest of the community they serve\n(Northouse, 2004). The country needs people who are edu-\ncated, and sincere and honest both in administration and\nleadership styles. In the Nigerian leadership situation, self-\nless and charismatic leaders are needed to amend the wrong\nEthical Standard Challenges\nEthics codes provide guidelines for the professional conduct\nand behavior for managers and employees (Pugh, 1991).\nLeaders and policy makers need to make positive laws and\nrules as well as implement them to the letter. Laws are not\nrespecters of persons. Adherence to ethical standards both in\nleadership and decision making must be a foundation of the\ncountry's policies. According to Lewis (1991), ethics codes\nfulfill the following three purposes: (a) encourage high stan-\ndards of behavior, (b) increase public confidence, and\n(c) assist in decision making.\nA true leader must be virtuous and a person to be trusted\nby the governed. This study was concerned with helping\nthe leaders to exercise leadership in a respectful and self-\nless manner for the common good of the people in the\nregion. Macintyre (1981) affirmed that virtue is an acquired\nhuman quality, the possession and exercise of which\nenables us to achieve those goods which are internal to\npractices, and the lack of which prevents us from achiev-\ning any such goods. Virtuous leaders either in government\nor business are persons of honesty, integrity, and trust\nBowman, ethics is action, the way we practice our values;\nit is a guidance system to be used in making decisions. The\nissue of ethics in the public sector as well as in the private\nlife encompasses a broad range of concerns, including a\nstress on obedience to authorities, on the necessity of logic\nin moral reasoning and on the necessity of putting moral\njudgment into practice (Bowman, 1991). Ethics codes are\na tool for clarifying acceptable behavior and provide guid-\nance to managers when dealing with ethical dilemmas\nLeadership can change followers' attitudes, beliefs, and\nbehaviors to improve performance (Northouse 2004). They\nshould encourage their followers to see with a new perspec-\ntive and stimulate them to face challenges and solve prob-\nlems (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Leaders should help arouse\ntheir followers'uniqueness and potential innovation perspec-\ntive for more effective problem solving without direct inter-\nvention from their leader (Bass & Avolio, 1990). It is of great\nvalue and importance that leaders have good moral conduct\nand ethical responsibility to enable them to attend to the\ndemands, concerns, needs, and problems of the citizens in\nthe country. In the views of Burns (1978), discussions of\nleadership sometimes are viewed as elitist because of the\nimplied power and importance often ascribed to leaders in\nthe leader\u00adfollowers relationship. Leaders are not above fol-\nlowers or better than followers. Leaders and followers must\nbe understood in relation to each other and collectively\nResearch Questions\nThe purpose of this qualitative critical ethnographic research\nstudy was to understand the perception of selected leaders\nand their experiences in regional and national leadership\npositions in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. The research\nquestions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: How do selected participants see\ntheir role as government leaders in Eastern Nigeria?\nResearch Question 2: How does the decision-making pro-\ncess operate for leaders in Eastern Nigeria?\nResearch Question 3: What recommendation do these\nparticipants have for improving political practices in\nEastern Nigeria?\nThe answers to these and other related questions that have\nemerged in the course of the study may provide current\nNigerian leadership and policy makers with information that,\nif applied, could enable the people of the country to live hap-\npily and enjoy the common good.\nMethod\nThe author used the qualitative critical ethnographic para-\ndigm to understand the perception of selected leaders and\ntheir experiences in regional and national leadership posi-\ntions in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. This methodology\nwas based on the experiences of the researcher and the\nselected participants which focused on identifying the lead-\nership practices of the past and present leaders involved in\nthe operation of the Nigerian government. The author used\ncritical ethnographic design to gain in-depth knowledge and\nauthentic understanding of the issues and problems associ-\nated with the current impact of leadership in Nigeria, with\nregard to its reality, challenges, and perspectives. With this in\nmind, the critical ethnographic design was used as the most\neffective means of carrying out comprehensive, systematic,\nand authentic research on the Nigerian leadership situation.\nBased on the researcher's judgment and the purpose of the\n1997) and in looking for those who \"have had experiences\nrelating to the phenomenon to be researched\" (Kruger, 1988,\np. 150), the key participants were limited to 12 past and cur-\nrent leaders who served in the eastern part of Nigeria between\n1960 and the present. The participants were selected from\ndifferent cities and towns of the eastern part of the country,\nand they all have political leadership and administrative\nexperience in the government operation of the country for a\nminimum of 12 years (2 participants had more than 30 years\nof experience). The participants consisted of three women\nand nine men, with an average age of 45. They also had a\nfirst degree as the minimum education level, although 3 of\nthe participants hold an honorary PhD. The informed consent\nagreement form and the purpose of the research study were\nexplained to the participants at the beginning of each\ninterview.\nThis study was based on a mixed-method, duplicating the\nself-designed survey questionnaire developed from the\nresearch questions and discussions from the focus group\ninterviews. The quantitative survey data were collected as a\nresponse to the questionnaire and used to support the qualita-\ntive data in the study. The researcher conducted both\n8 SAGE Open\nindividual and semistructured interviews with the selected\nparticipants forming three groups of four individuals. All\nselected individuals and each group participated in three\nseparate interviews to avoid responses being filtered only in\nthe single ideas of a particular interviewee. Here, the\nresearcher chose the researcher role as an active listener and\ncollaborator \"to tell the story from the participants' view\nrather than as `expert' who passes judgment on the partici-\ntape recorded with participant's permission and used as a\ncheck to the field notes of the researcher. This method is\nmuch encouraged in conducting critical ethnographic\nresearch. Because ethnographic analytical procedures vary\nby researchers' schools of thought, quantitative as well as\nqualitative procedures and instruments may be incorporated,\nBasically, data analysis employed a concurrent nested\nmodel (Creswell, 2003). Having said that, the qualitative\ndata analysis, which is primarily inductive and recursive pro-\ncess, were analyzed and organized into categories to identify\nthemes or patterns as these facilitated a deeper knowledge\nand understanding of the leadership situation in Nigeria. The\nquestionnaire and final survey revisions were made to sup-\nport and improve the content and process of the data collec-\ntions, both incorporated qualitative and quantitative items.\nThus, the quantitative data were systematically organized,\nanalyzed, and given a basic descriptive statistical treatment\nin the study. A follow-up research was conducted by imple-\nmenting focused interviews of the selected past and present\nof the Nigerian leaders to corroborate the data from the final\nsurvey and identify additional variables. The author allowed\nthe selected participants to serve as a check to the study to\nensure immediate validation as to the accuracy and credibil-\nity of the narratives in the data. The constant communication\nbetween the researcher and the selected participants added to\nthe confidence and validity of the interview transcripts.\nFindings\nThe findings are based on the purpose, objectives, and\nresearch questions of this study as well as examined in mul-\ntiple levels (Creswell, 2003) that include three major sources:\n(a) open-ended questions posed through interviews, (b)\ndemographics and observation, and (c) the survey\nquestionnaire.\nInterview Questions\n1.Relationshiptoregion'sinfrastructureandManagement:\n a.

What would you do differently if you had sole control\nof the public trust?\nBased on the research questions, the interview questions\nwere developed thematically. The interview questions helped\nto provide the structure for data gathering and also served as\na means for recording information that was used in this study.\nDemographics\nThe participants were selected from different cities and\ntowns of the eastern part of the country, and they all had\npolitical leadership and administrative experience in the gov-\nernment operation of the country for a minimum of 12 years\n(two participants had more than 30 years of experience). The\nparticipants consisted of three women and nine men with an\naverage age of 45. They also had a first degree as the mini-\nmum education level, although three of the participants hold\nan honorary PhD (Table 1).\nSurvey: The Leaders Attribute Inventory (LAI)\nSurvey data\nThirteen Nigerian leaders completed the Leadership as a\nProcess: Leader Attribute Inventory (LAL; one more than\nparticipated in the survey). All of the participants completed\nthe attribution items and 12 completed all of the demographic\nquestions. A general description of the participants shows\nyears old, the mean years of education was 23.75, and the\nmean years of work was 22.67. Further breakdowns of the\ndemographic information could jeopardize the identities of\nthe participants. Because there were few participants asked\nto complete the survey only descriptions of attribution item\nresults were needed to support the qualitative findings. The\nresults for the LAI items are listed in Table 2.\nTable 2 shows the minimum score, maximum score, and\nmeans for LAL attribution items (means in bold are the larg-\nest scores, means in italics are the lowest scores). Overall,\nthe survey completers seemed to have a good opinion of\nthemselves based on the survey results. Only one of the\nTable 1.

The five lowest scored items\nseem to relate to each other thematically. The other four\nitems are \"I demonstrate patience when the group cannot\n\"I am able to appropriately assign tasks and workloads\" (M =\nthings to the group and to individuals in a clear way\" (M =\n4.15, SD = 1.09). These items together suggest that there are\nmany things outside of the leaders' sphere of influence and\nsuggest a lack of structure and accountability within\ngovernment.\nHowever, the attribution items with the five highest scores\nsuggest that the leaders themselves take their roles seriously\nand have a desire to move toward real results. These items\nare \"I make sure that I understand what we are doing and\nwhy we are doing it\" (M = 4.85, SD = 0.96); \"I appreciate the\ngroup's confidence in me and take my leadership position\ntion in the organization seriously\" (M = 4.83, SD = 0.90); \"I\nhelp the group understand the need to come together as a\nnumber of survey completers, no inferential statistical tests\nwere conducted.\nThe findings in this study are in line with the Fagbadebo\n(2007) perspective that the Nigerian State is a victim of high-\nlevel corruption, bad governance, political instability and a\ncyclical legitimacy crisis. Consequently, national develop-\nment is retarded, and the political environment uncertain.\nThe country's authoritarian leadership faced a legitimacy\ncrisis, political intrigues, in an ethnically differentiated pol-\nity, where ethnic competition for resources drove much of\nthe pervasive corruption and profligacy.\nDiscussion\nIn the views of the participants in this study, Nigeria would have\nbeen a very wonderful place, but the only problem is those\npoliticians and retired government officials, those corrupt\npoliticians, and some people who encourage and influence\ncorruption and lawlessness in the country, if they can be swept\nout of offices or positions, if they can face the law, do what the\nlaw says, not just bribing themselves out of the way and trouble\nin everything, especially crimes, things would be better and well\nfor the common people of the country (Participant A, December\nThe stories and experiences of the focus group were the\ntools and elements used to discover a pattern of meaning and\nachieve result. The roles of the participants could be seen in\nmost of what the participants shared with the researcher. For\ninstance, one of the Participants stated that\nIf somebody commits a crime, goes back in there, goes through\nthe back door, and give some money and they let him go. If they\ncan get all those corrupt leaders out of the away, then our country\nwill be a very wonderful place. (Participant L, January 18, 2010)\nMost of the participants agreed that the nation's natural\nresources are being wasted and sold and packed in private\npockets. Thus, there are no good roads; the schools are not\nthere; the hospitals are not equipped, and the transport sys-\ntem is neither functioning nor available in most of the cities.\nIf the money and wealth of the country were spent appropri-\nately, the masses would have had at least good schools, good\nroads, good drinking water, electricity, and health facilities in\nplace. The fact is that these are seriously lacking.\nAll the participants were very happy to be part of the\nstudy. For them, it seemed that through the study the answers\nto their prayers and requests would be accomplished. They\nwere energetic, motivated, and eager to discover a result. In\nsharing their knowledge, stories, and experiences as leaders\nand policy makers in the government operations in the\nEastern Region, they also expressed their concerns, sugges-\ntions, and recommendations for the current leadership situa-\ntion in Nigeria. As Participant C (December 7, 2009) in\ntelling his stories said,\nMy role as a leader is to discover the ends and objectives of that\nparticular group so that we work towards achieving them; and to\ndo that, I will identify the group proper, the constituents of that\ngroup, what they expect to achieve, as I listen to them, and then\nas much as possible, pulling them together, making them\nunderstand individual participation, individual responsibilities;\nas much as possible, making sure that the group work as a team,\nthe group work as a peaceful group, because under a confused\nsituation, you can never achieve any good you want to achieve.\nThe situation in Nigeria during the period of this study\nwas very different from what the country used to be. Most\npeople were living in poverty, fear, and chaos which moti-\nvated, and encouraged armed robbery, killings, and kidnap-\nping to make quick money. Many people preferred to stay\nindoors and at home rather than going elsewhere for the fear\nof being kidnapped. Movement from one city to the other\nwas very difficult due to the bad roads and lack of security on\nmost of the Nigerian roads. While the armed robbers stole\nfrom the travelers, the police extorted money from the com-\nmercial drivers, thereby making things difficult for citizens,\nand commerce. Yet the participants were determined to be\ninvolved with the study to find a solution to the current situ-\nation. Many of the participants were out and ready to stand\nand defend the rights and integrity of the country. Most of\nthem were angry about the way things are going in the coun-\ntry's leadership and administration, the suffering and poor\nprovision of amenities for the people in the society.\nAs stated earlier, the participants in this study strongly\nmaintained that Nigeria could have been a very wonderful\nplace associated with a situation that is favorable to better\nliving conditions and that encourages growth and develop-\nment, but that condition is unattainable under the present\nleadership conditions. Some of the ex-politicians, retired and\nformer government officials, pose as stumbling blocks to\neffective leadership and administration in the country. These\nformer leaders have refused to exit the public offices and to\nrelinquish their positions to the new leaders. They used the\npast existing leadership protocols of the government system\nto either influence or subdue the efforts of the young and\nnewly elected leaders. They encouraged new leaders to fol-\nlow their corrupt and fraudulent parts in the administration of\ngovernment duties for fear of being probed or punished for\ntheir misconduct in the running of the government opera-\ntions by their successors.\nThese leaders through their conduct encourage and influ-\nence corruption and lawlessness in the country. These kinds\nof leaders need to be swept out of offices or positions and\nbrought to face the law, obey the law, and not allowed to\nbribe themselves out of the crimes they committed during\ntheir tenure of office. As a participant emphasized,\nIf somebody commits a crime, goes back in there, goes through\nthe back door, and give some money and they let him go. If they\ncan get all those corrupt leaders out of the way, then Nigeria as\na country will be a very wonderful place to live. (Participant L,\nAll the participants agreed that the national resources\nbestowed on them by nature are being wasted and sold and\npacked in private pockets.\nThere are no good roads; the schools are not there, the hospitals\nare not equipped, and the transport system is not working and\navailable in most of the cities. If the leaders should spent the\ncountry's wealth or money as appropriate, many Nigerians\nIn Nigeria, the decision-making process somehow is\nbelieved to belong only to a special interest group of people.\nThe process of decision making is in the hands of powerful\nand influential leaders and politicians, who control and\nmanipulate the justice system in the country to suit their spe-\ncial and individual interests. As one of the participants\npostulated,\nWe talk of democracy, government of the people, by the people,\nfor the people, that is in principle as far as leadership in Nigeria\nis concerned. But if leaders are to lead exactly according to that\nprinciple of democracy, things would be different in Nigeria.\nBut in this country, leaders make laws for other people to follow\nand not for them to follow. (Participant D, January 15, 2010)\nIn the present Nigerian situation, the interest of the peo-\nple and the image of the country are neglected. The law-\nmakers and some leaders and policy makers with money\nand power do not appear to have the interest of the common\npeople at heart. Laws are made for the common people and\nnot for the leaders. The decision-making process under the\ncurrent situation was not based on the analysis of the needs\nof the people. Instead, it is based on political advantage and\nexists to favor the rich and the special interests of those in\nauthority in the entire country. This poor leadership condi-\ntion and other negative practices in the country have led\nmany people to participate in different crimes and illegal\nactivities. Many of the Nigerian citizens are fed up and\nunhappy with the chaotic situation of administration and\nleadership in the country. The laws and those who make\nthem are not transparent and honest in doing what they\nwere elected to do for the interest of the common good and\nthe welfare of the country. According to Participant K\nRules and decisions relating to the country laws are based on the\nleaders, for what they can get, it is not actually from what the\npeople's needs are, even though they can present that to the\npeople, but they have a hidden agenda for personal issue in\nmaking decisions which they present as decision of the people or\nfor the country. The promotion of rule of law doesn't hold very\nmuch because the people that have the money, they believe that\nthey can buy their way through. Unlike the system they have in\nthe United States where nobody is above the law. But I think that\nthat can be accomplished in Nigeria when the right leaders come\ninto power that respect the rule of law and apply that rule of law\nto themselves as well.\nThe laws and rules in the present Nigerian situation are\nmade to represent special interests and the power that mat-\nters. Most of the time, the laws are enforced only on the\nweaker ones and implemented for the common people in the\nsociety. The only application to top politicians and govern-\nment officials is when the image of the high-ranking and\npowerful leaders is at stake in the eyes of the public. The law\nunder the present condition is not comprehensive, and it is\nnot working well enough to serve the interest of the country\ndue to lack of implementation and enforcement. Most people\nare sometimes afraid of the system of government, because\nof insecurity, chaos, and lack of rule of law. As the partici-\npants affirmed, there are rules and a constitution that are only\non paper and for decoration (Figure 2).\nConclusion\nThe overall conclusion that emerged from the research can\nbe summarized in the views of Sally Hargreaves (2002) who\nclaimed that Nigeria, once heralded as the beacon of Africa,\nhas fallen somewhat short of this potential. Years of pluto-\ncratic repressive dictators and military rule, coupled with\nwidespread corruption, have resulted in large-scale neglect\nand deterioration of public services. The upsurge of corrup-\ntion in Nigeria is endemic and troubling. Transparency\nInternational consistently rates the levels of corruption in\nNigeria among the highest in the world. Pervasive corruption\nappears to permeate many levels of the Nigerian society (Eti\nAll the participants agreed that the national resources\nendowed to them by nature are being wasted or misappropri-\nated to private pockets. Good roads and schools are missing;\nthe hospitals are not equipped; the transport system is not\nworking or available in most of the cities. If Nigerians spent\ntheir wealth as appropriate, they would not be complaining.\nThe masses would at least have good schools, good roads,\ngood drinking water, electricity, and health facilities, but the\nreality is that these are seriously lacking. A nation that has oil\nis still begging money to handle health issues and having\nproblems acquiring technology. There is need for awareness\nin the governance and leadership of the country, so that the\npeople and the society can embrace procedures in accor-\ndance with the dictates of the rule of law.\nRecommendations for\nElected Leaders and Policy Makers\n1. Maintain the rule of law as top priority of any elected\nleader in Nigeria from the federal to the local govern-\nment level.\n2. Establish collective effort in decision making in\nwhich every part is duly represented and mutually\nbeneficial decisions are made. Any leader that\nemerges to lead Nigeria must be totally de-tribalized.\nAll decisions must be made bearing one Nigeria in\nmind and be completely unbiased, filled with objec-\ntivity and free of sentiments. Nigeria is made up of\ndifferent tribes, cultures and religions; no one tribe or\nreligion should be marginalized.\n3. Divide the nation into three different sovereign\nregions, namely, the Hausa, Igbo, andYoruba regions.\nNigerians need leadership that harmonizes and main-\ntains the geopolitical systems.\n4. Develop a decision-making process that starts from\nthe community, involves the people, and represents\nthe interest of the general public.\n5. Encourage the understanding of the people's culture\nand history in the country.\n6. Nigerian leaders should be able to understand the\ndiversity tribes, tradition, customs, and languages of\nthe different people in Nigeria to enhance a better and\ncomprehensive leadership style and effectiveness in\ngovernance of the people.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdejimi, A.
