The six squares embedded in the patterned surround on the right are physically identical to\nthose embedded in the uniform surround on the left, yet the latter appear more colourful. The four\nchromatic targets look more saturated, and the two achromatic ones on the top appear as more pro-\nnounced shades of white and black. Regarded as points in three-dimensional colour space, the per-\nceived colours of the targets in the uniform surround are all shifted in the direction away from the\nintermediate grey of the surrounds.\nThe gamut expansion effect has stirred much interest because it clearly violates traditional laws of\nsimultaneous contrast. According to the \"complementarity law\" of simultaneous colour contrast, the\nsurround induces a shift in the perceived colour of the target, which is complementary to the colour\nof the surround. That is, the vector in colour space representing the colour shift should have a direc-\ntion opposite to the vector from the grey point to the surround colour (Figure 2a). Furthermore, the\ndirection of the colour shift should be the same for targets of any colour, as long as the colour of the\nsurround is fixed. Figure 2(b) schematically illustrates the kind of colour changes typically observed\nin investigations of the gamut expansion effect (Brown & MacLeod, 1997; Ekroll & Faul, 2013; Faul,\nEkroll, & Wendt, 2008). The observation that the perceived colours of the targets in the uniform grey\nsurround appear more saturated than those in the variegated one, but of the same hue, means that they\nare shifted in the directions corresponding to the vectors pointing from the colour of the surround\n(which is grey in this case) to the colours of the target. Based on many lines of converging evidence,\nwe have argued that the latter is a general rule (\"direction law\"), which holds for surrounds of arbitrary\ncolour (not just grey ones; see Figures 2b and c), and is characteristic not only of the gamut expansion\neffect but also of the classical simultaneous contrast effect (Ekroll & Faul, 2012a, 2012b).\nTraditional explanations of simultaneous colour contrast appeal to mechanisms providing col-\nBenzschawel, & Rogowitz, 1987). When the colour of the illumination changes in a given direction\nin colour space, the colour of the light reflected from objects in the scene typically change in roughly\nthe same direction and any visual mechanism that shifts the object colours in the opposite (\"comple-\nmentary\") direction would counteract the influence of the illumination and thus provide approximate\ncolour constancy. Thus, presuming that the visual system uses the colour of the surround as a cue to the\nPerceptual organization in colour perception:\nInverting the gamut expansion effect\nInverting the gamut expansion effect 329\ncolour of the illumination, this kind of mechanism can be expected to produce a simultaneous contrast\neffect that is complementary to the colour of the surround. However, if the simultaneous contrast\neffect actually obeys the direction law rather than the complementarity law, this traditional explanation\nwould seem less plausible, suggesting that an alternative theoretical account is needed.\nFigure 1. In the top panels, the perceived difference between the target patches is more pronounced in the uniform\nsurround (a) than in the variegated surround (b). In the lower panels, the converse is true. Here, the target patches\nin the variegated surround (c) appear (in a qualitatively similar way) more different than the physically identical\nones shown in the uniform surround (d). Together, the classical gamut expansion effect (top) and the inverted one\n(bottom) suggest that the compatibility with a perceptual interpretation in terms of transparency, which is given\nin the left panels, but not in the right ones, is the crucial determinant of the effect. The demonstration should\npreferably be viewed on-screen for optimal colour reproduction.\nFigure 2. (a) According to the traditional complementarity law, the direction of the perceived colour shifts\n(arrows) induced by a coloured surround is opposite to the direction given by the vector point from the grey point\nto the colour of the surround. (b) The colour shifts observed in the gamut expansion effect exhibit a different\npattern. Here, the targets in the uniform grey surround appear more saturated than those in the non-uniform\nsurround. This corresponds to colour shifts having the same direction as the vectors from the grey surround to\nthe targets. (c) According to our theory, the same principle (\"direction law\") also applies for coloured surrounds.\nAddressing this point, we have proposed that the gamut expansion effect (as well as the classical\nsimultaneous contrast effect) is instead due to mechanisms subserving the perception of transparent\ncoloured disc embedded in a uniformly coloured surround (Figure 3a) is compatible with the percep-\ntual interpretation of a transparent disc in front of a uniformly coloured background (Figure 3b). If the\nperceptual system makes this interpretation, and infers the colour of the transparent disc based on the\ncolour-mixture equations underlying Metelli's model of perceptual transparency (Gerbino, in press;\nMetelli, 1985), then the inferred colour of a disc embedded in a grey surround should be more satu-\nrated than its proximal colour.According to Metelli's equations, the perceived colour E of the transpar-\nent disc is related to the proximal colour P of the disc and the proximal colour B of the surround by the\nequation P = B + (1 - )E, where 0 <  < 1 is the perceived transmittance of the transparent disc.\nIntuitively, this equation means that the proximal colour P is located on the line segment connecting\nthe colours B and E in colour space. Hence, if B is an achromatic colour, the proximal colour P of the\ndisc is always less saturated than its inferred layer colour E. Importantly, though, this enhancement\nof perceived saturation should only occur when the stimulus is compatible with perceptual transpar-\nency. Since the structure of the background will generally be visible through a transparent object (see\nFigures 3c\u00add), a centre-surround stimulus should only be compatible with transparency of the central\npatch if the central patch and the surround exhibit compatible patterning (or a compatible lack of\npatterning). That is, a uniform target is compatible with transparency only when the surround is also\nuniform. If the surround is non-uniform, transparency would only be a viable solution if the target is\nalso non-uniform (as in Figure 1c or Figures 3c\u00add). Thus, according to our theory, the gamut expan-\nsion effect (top panels of Figure 1) results because the uniform targets can be interpreted as transparent\nwhen they are embedded in the uniform surround (Figure 1a) but not when they are embedded in the\nnon-uniform surround (Figure 1b).\nThe results reported in Ekroll and Faul (2013) lend strong support to this explanation of the gamut\nexpansion effect. A further interesting prediction of this theory, though, is that it should be possible\nto invert the gamut expansion effect by using non-uniform target squares rather than uniform ones.\nThe demonstration shown at the bottom of Figure 1 suggests that this is indeed the case. Here, the six\nsquares embedded in the uniform surround (Figure 1d), each composed of two differently coloured\nrectangles, are physically identical to those embedded in the variegated surround (Figure 1c). In this\ncase, the target squares embedded in the non-uniform surround appear more different from each other\nthan the ones embedded in the uniform surround, rather than the other way around, as was the case\nwith the uniform target squares (Figures 3a\u00adb). Thus, as predicted by our theory, the crucial variable\ndetermining which targets look more saturated is not the contrast of the surround, but the compatibility\nwith a perceptual interpretation in terms of perceptual transparency.\nJudging colours of the square targets in the bottom panels of Figure 1 is somewhat complicated\nby the fact that each square consists of two differently coloured rectangles rather than a single colour.\nIt is particularly difficult to judge the colour of the squares on the right, since no common transparent\nInverting the gamut expansion effect 331\nlayer is perceived in the square region corresponding to the two rectangles. Thus, whether the squares\nin Figure 1(c) actually look more saturated than those in Figure 1(d) will, to some extent, depend on\nwhat one regards as \"the\" colour of the two rectangles--which clearly also requires some mental\nconstrual. It is comparatively straightforward, however, to compare the colours of the transparent\nsquares in Figure 1(c) with the uniform squares in Figure 1(b). Although the average colour within\neach square in Figure 1(c) is identical to the colour of the corresponding square in Figure 1(b), the\nsquares in Figure 1(c) appear more saturated, which cannot be attributed to contrast adaptation, since\nthe two surrounds are identical.\nHistorically, the simple centre-surround stimuli shown in Figure 3(a) and the slightly more com-\nplex stimuli shown in Figure 3(c) are strongly associated with two separate research traditions pursu-\ning different goals with different strategies. The former kind of stimulus has been extensively used\nwithin the tradition of sensory psychophysics, which aims to study simple low-level mechanisms by\neliminating or at least minimizing the influence of perceptual organization. The latter kind of stimulus,\non the other hand, was preferred within the tradition of Gestalt psychology (Fuchs, 1923; Metelli,\n1985), which aims to reveal the role of perceptual organization by using stimuli containing sufficient\nstructure for doing so (Gerbino, in press, Wagemans et al., 2012a, 2012b). Modern approaches typi-\ncally appeal to both lines of reasoning within a theoretical framework postulating multiple levels of\nvisual processing (Adelson, 2000; Kingdom, 2003). While the idea of multiple levels of processing\nFigure 3. (a)Auniformly coloured target disc embedded in a uniformly coloured surround (a) can be interpreted\nas a transparent disc in front of a uniformly coloured background (b). Traditional research on perceptual\ntransparency, however, has focused on the slightly more complex stimuli shown in (c), which can be interpreted\nas a transparent disc in front of a non-uniform background. Reproduced from Ekroll & Faul, (2013) by kind\npermission of the Journal of the Optical Society of America A.\nPublished under a Creative Commons Licence a Pion publication\nInverting the gamut expansion effect 332\nseems quite plausible, there is no a priori justification for the widespread assumption that simpler\nstimuli engage less complex visual mechanisms than more complex stimuli do. As our analysis sug-\ngests, the very simple stimulus in Figure 1(a) may engage the same kind of comparatively complex\nvisual processing as the more complex stimulus in Figure 1(c). Thus, the well-documented influence\nof perceptual organization and layered scene representation on colour appearance (Anderson, in press;\nWollschl\u00e4ger & Anderson, 2009) may even play a crucial role in simple centre-surround stimuli. From\nthis perspective, it appears less surprising that the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast evoked by\nthese deceivingly simple stimuli has defied any simple and consistent explanation for more than a\n"
