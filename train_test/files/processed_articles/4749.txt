Analysis of the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ndescribe the clinical profile of undiagnosed\nT2DM patients, which may serve as guid-\nance for improving T2DM diagnosis in\nChina.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe NHANES is a cross-sectional health\nsurvey representing the noninstitutionalized\nUSA population. NHANES was carried out\nby the National Center for Health Statistics,\nwhich is a branch of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. A complex, multi-\nstage, probability sampling strategy was\nused for data collection and subgroups of\nparticular public interest were intensively\nsampled.25 The study was approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics\nInstitutional Ethics Review Board and all\nadult participants provided written\ninformed consent. In the current study,\nNHANES data were obtained from individ-\nwhich included men, and non-pregnant and\nyears). Participants answered questionnaires\non demographics, lifestyle and medical fac-\ntors. NHANES also obtained anthropomet-\nric measurements and biomarker data at\nmobile examination centres. This present\nstudy did not focus on adolescents and\nyoung adults because a young age of onset\nis a hallmark of type 1 diabetes.26\nParticipants with missing exposure out-\ncomes and covariate information were\nexcluded from the study.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus status\nType 2 diabetes mellitus status (normogly-\ncaemic, diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed\ndiabetes) was defined based on the fasting\nplasma glucose concentration, glycosylated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and question-\nnaires. Diagnosed diabetes was defined by\npositive responses to one or more questions\nsuch as: ``Have you ever been told by a\ndoctor that you have diabetes?'' and ``Are\nyou now taking diabetic pills to lower your\nblood sugar?''. Undiagnosed diabetes was\ndefined by negative responses to the ques-\ntions above and a fasting glucose concen-\n6.5%. Normoglycaemia was defined\n<6.5% and no positive responses to the\nRisk factors\nHypertension was defined as a mean dia-\nstolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or a mean\nsystolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or a\npositive response to the questions: ``Have\nyou been told on two or more different visits\nthat you had hypertension?'' or ``Are you\ntaking prescribed medicine to lower blood\npressure''. Prehypertension was defined as a\nmean diastolic blood pressure between 80\nand 89 mmHg or a mean systolic blood\nPhysical activity was defined as the number\nof hours a subject spent on vigorous or\nmoderate physical activity in a typical\nweek.29 Participants who claimed they car-\nried out moderate or vigorous activity\n>120 h/week were considered implausible\nand excluded from the analysis.\nHypercholesterolaemia was defined as a\nnon-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nlevels of non-HDL-C were classified as\nfollows based on the treatment goals rec-\nommended by the Adult Treatment Panel\nIII final report: optimal <130 mg/dl; near\nObesity categories were defined as follows:\ndefined as triglyceride 150 mg/dl.\nNutritional data were collected from 24-h\ndietary recall and were linked to a database\nof the nutrient composition of food for\nenergy intake calculation. Energy intake\nwas classified into four quartiles: first\nclassified into four quartiles and the cut-off\nvalues were: first quartile (<175.0 g); second\n(310.1 g). The cut-off values for categoriz-\ning physical activity into four quartiles were:\nfirst quartile (<0.23 h); second quartile\nCovariates\nRace/ethnicity was determined by self-\nreported demographic questionnaires and\ncategorized as `Mexican American', `Other\nHispanic', `Non-Hispanic White', `Non-\nHispanic Black', and `other Race \u00ad including\nMulti-Racial'. Marital Status was categor-\nized as `Married', `Widowed', `Divorced',\n`Separated', `Never married', and `Living\nwith partner'. Family income-to-poverty\nratio was determined by the family income\nand The Department of Health and Human\nServices' poverty guidelines. The cut-off\nvalues for the four quartiles of family\nincome-to-poverty ratio were: first quartile\n(4.21). Education levels were determined\nby questions: `What is highest degree or level\nof school completed or the highest degree\nreceived?' and categorized into `Less than\ngrade with no diploma), `high school gradu-\nation/General Educational Development or\nequivalent', `some college or Associate of\nArts degree', and `college graduate or\nabove'.\nInsurance status was determined by\nresponses to whether the participant was\n`covered by health insurance or some other\nkind of health care plan, including health\ninsurance obtained through employment or\npurchased directly, as well as government\nprogrammes like Medicare and Medicaid\nthat provide medical care or help to pay for\nmedical bills.\nStatistical analyses\nThe prevalence of diagnosed or undiagnosed\ndiabetes was established using SAS software\nversion 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)\nto estimate percentage and 95% confidence\nintervals. The standard error was estimated\nby a Taylor series (linearization) method\nbased on a complex sampling design. The\nRao-Scott 2-test was a design-adjusted\nversion of the Pearson 2-test, which was\nused for equality of prevalence for categor-\nical variables. The two samples t-test was\nInstitute) to test for equality of continuous\nvariables and two-proportion Z-tests were\nused to test proportions between diagnosed\nand undiagnosed diabetes groups. The\nPROC SURVEYREG described by\nNHANES tutorials, examined the age-\nadjusted prevalence of diagnosed and\nwith the 2000 Census serving as the standard\npopulation. Linear trends of age-adjusted\nprevalence were assessed by regression\nmodels, with a 2-year survey cycle treated\nas a continuous variable. A P-value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nMultinomial logistic regression was con-\nducted using SAS software version 9.3\nfor each variable to assess the association\nbetween risk factors and diagnosed or\nundiagnosed diabetes. Model 1 was a logis-\ntic regression model to assess the association\nbetween diabetes status as a dependent\nvariable and each risk factor as an inde-\npendent variable. Model 2 was based on\nmodel 1 and adjusted according to socio-\ndemographic variables including age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, education level,\nfamily income-to-poverty ratio, marital\nstatus, and insurance status. Model 3 was a\nmultivariable logistic regression analysis of\nall variables from model 2 and adjusted for\nother risk factor variables including hyper-\ntension, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertrigly-\nceridaemia, physical activity, carbohydrate\nintake and energy intake.\nResults\nThis study included a cohort of adults from\nclinical, demographic and laboratory data,\nwhich were divided into diagnosed diabetes,\nundiagnosed diabetes and normoglycaemic\ngroups (Table 1). During the 12 years,\nparticipants with undiagnosed diabetes\nwere significantly more likely to be male\nwithout insurance and have a higher carbo-\nhydrate and energy intake than those diag-\nnosed with diabetes (P < 0.05 for all\ncomparisons). Mean age, BMI, and the\nprevalence of hypertension, hypercholester-\nolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia were\nsimilar between the diagnosed and undiag-\nnosed groups (Table 1). Furthermore, the\nproportion of patients <30 years old was\nsignificantly higher in the undiagnosed than\n(Table 2).

As expected, the prevalence of\ndiagnosed diabetes was higher than undiag-\nnosed diabetes in the total population and in\nthe subgroups defined by risk factors\n(Figures 1a and 1b).

However,\na recent study reported a prevalence of\n32.55% of microvascular complications in\nasymptomatic newly diagnosed T2DM\npatients.36 In an earlier study undertaken\n38.6% had coronary heart disease and\n17.7% had silent myocardial infarctions;\nwith microvascular complications already\npresent (neuropathy [27.5%], nephropathy\nhad presumably developed during the\nasymptomatic preclinical phase of the dis-\nease.37 Another study showed that among\nwith undiagnosed diabetes had the lowest\ncognitive performance.38 In order to develop\npolicies and strategies for improving the\ndetection of T2DM, particularly in develop-\ning countries, noninvasive risk models\nfor predicting undiagnosed prevalent dia-\nbetes mainly based on age, BMI, waist\nTable 4.

However,\nBMI as a risk factor for developing T2DM\nhas been shown to vary between ethnic\ngroups40 and the BMI threshold for T2DM\nscreening of American Asians has been\nmodified to 23 kg/m2 by the American\nDiabetes Association.41 Although the per-\ncentage of individuals covered by insurance\nwas significantly lower in undiagnosed\nversus diagnosed T2DM patients in the\npresent study, the family income-to-poverty\nratio and educational status unexpectedly\ndid not have any influence on whether\nT2DM was diagnosed or not, indicating\nthat public health measures were effective\nfor poorer people and those with lower\nlevels of education.42\nNon-Hispanic white people were the\nmajority of the surveyed population and\nthe only ethnic group with a significantly\nhigher undiagnosed prevalence of T2DM.\nAlthough the prevalence of undiagnosed\nT2DM was lower in non-Hispanic whites\ncompared with other ethnic groups\n(Figure 1a), the predominant proportion of\nnon-Hispanic whites in the total undiag-\nnosed T2DM population implies that this\npopulation deserves to be the major target\nfor addressing T2DM unawareness. Low\nHDL-C levels have been noted to contribute\nlarger proportion of individuals with very\nhigh (220 mg/dl) non-HDL-C had undiag-\nnosed diabetes, which might reflect a\nlack of hypercholesterolaemia awareness.\nUnexpectedly, the rate was also higher in\npeople with non-HDL-C levels of 130\u00ad\n159 mg/dl, which might have been a factor\nfor not expecting a diagnosis of T2DM and\nthereby a reason for undiagnosed diabetes.\nIn addition, compared with individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes, those individuals with\nundiagnosed diabetes comprised a larger\nproportion of the <30 years age group,\nindicating that younger people may care\nless about their health and therefore have a\nhigher level of T2DM unawareness.\nSeveral studies have reported that a high\ncarbohydrate intake is associated with a risk\nof developing diabetes,45\u00ad47 findings consist-\nent with the results of the present study. In a\nfully adjusted model (model 3), carbohy-\ndrate intake was associated with diagnosed\ndiabetes but not with undiagnosed diabetes\n(Table 3 and Table 4), and carbohydrate and\nenergy uptake was lower in diagnosed\npatients (Table 2), indicating effective diet-\nary lifestyle intervention in diagnosed\nT2DM patients.12 In contrast, awareness\nof T2DM did not significantly drive physical\nactivity changes among patients in different\nphysical activity quartiles, which may imply\nthat unlike dietary intake, T2DM awareness\nis not a determining factor for physical\nactivity behaviour change. Among the\ncardio-metabolic factors, hypertension,\nhypertriglyceridaemia and obesity were\nstrongly associated with both diagnosed\nand undiagnosed diabetes, although hyper-\ncholesterolaemia did not reach statistical\nsignificance after adjusting for covariates\nand confounders (Table 3 and Table 4).\nPhysical activity displayed an inverse asso-\nciation with diabetes in the three models\nused in this present study, especially in\nmodel 1, findings that were consistent with\nthose of other research.48\nThe present research had several limita-\ntions. First, it was a cross-sectional survey\nstudy and directional cause\u00adeffect relation-\nships between risk factors and diabetes risk\ncannot be inferred. Secondly, there were\nissues with dietary intake recall, since par-\nticipants may have under-reported their\nfood intake or changed their usual dietary\npattern because they participated in the\nsurvey.49 Thirdly, due to a change of the\nmeasuring method, some variables may dis-\nplay slight differences. It is also important to\nnote that the prevalence, trends and possibly\npatient characteristics of undiagnosed\nT2DM patients in developing countries\nsuch as China may be distinct from those\nin the US. Thus, country-specific epidemio-\nlogical studies need to be carried out to\naddress the unmet T2DM unawareness, since\nthe rate of undiagnosed diabetes is consider-\nably higher in China then in the US.10\nIn conclusion, this present study investi-\ngated the differences in the prevalence rates\nof diagnosed and undiagnosed T2DM and\nthe associations with risk factors using data\noverall prevalence rates of diagnosed and\nundiagnosed T2DM increased significantly\nhypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia, obes-\nity and hypercholesterolaemia. Subgroup\nanalyses revealed increasing rates of hyper-\ntension, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity,\nhypertriglyceridaemia, and insurance cover-\nage in diagnosed patients and increasing\nrates of hypertension and hypercholesterol-\naemia in undiagnosed T2DM patients from\nT2DM was higher in males, in those\nyounger than 30 years of age, non-\nHispanic whites or those with very high\nnon-HDL-C levels (220 mg/dl). It was also\nhigher in individuals with near optimal non-\npatients without health insurance compared\nwith patients diagnosed with T2DM. Since\nthe rate of undiagnosed T2DM was high\nparticularly in people that are considered to\nbe at a low risk of developing T2DM, a\nChinese approach for diabetes screening\nshould involve general population surveil-\nlance, which is covered by public health\ninsurance.\n"
