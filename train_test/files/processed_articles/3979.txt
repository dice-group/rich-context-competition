Stock exchanges, regulators, legis-\nlators, credit rating agencies, and industry associations have\nimplemented changes designed to strengthen enterprise-wide\nrisk oversight with an emphasis on enhancing the board's role\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, 2013; New York\nStock Exchange [NYSE], 2004; Securities and Exchange\nMost of these place the onus of responsibility for owning risk\ngovernance on the board.\nIn terms of risk governance, there are two overarching\nresponsibilities being placed on boards of directors:\n1. The board of directors should understand and approve\nmanagement's process for overseeing enterprise risks\n(i.e., the board assesses the enterprise risk manage-\nment [ERM] process).\n2. The board of directors should evaluate the risks iden-\ntified by management's process for overseeing enter-\nprise risks to govern the actions taken by management\nto create value (i.e., the board uses information from\nthe ERM process).\nPressure to fulfill these responsibilities is causing many\nboards to place expectations on management to design and\nimplement robust processes for identifying, assessing, man-\naging, and monitoring the most significant enterprise-wide\nrisks. In fact, almost 70% of over 1,000 executives surveyed\nindicate that many board members are asking for greater risk\noversight involvement by senior management. That percent-\nage grows to 88% for public companies (Beasley, Branson,\nOften the board works through its audit committee to over-\nsee management's risk management processes, and that results\nin the audit committee turning to executives in key accounting\nand financial reporting roles, such as the chief financial officer\n(CFO) or chief audit executive, for initial risk management\nleadership. Accordingly, the accounting profession has been\nactively involved in developing ERM methods.

Viscelli1, Mark S. Beasley2, and Dana R. Hermanson3\n Keywords\nERM, risk, risk management, corporate governance, audit committee, board of directors, internal audit\n2 SAGE Open\nCommission (COSO; 2004) issued Enterprise Risk\nManagement--Integrated Framework to provide directors\nand managers with a model of the ERM process.\nIn response to these emerging expectations, a number of\norganizations have adopted ERM to enhance the organiza-\ntion's enterprise-wide risk oversight. ERM is a way to coor-\ndinate all the risk management activities so that management\nand the board have a top-down, enterprise-wide view of the\nmost important risks to the enterprise (COSO, 2004).\nOne of the challenges for the board of directors in fulfilling\nits risk governance responsibilities is determining whether or\nnot management's ERM practices are designed and operating\neffectively. In most situations, the board of directors is heavily,\nif not solely, dependent on management's description and self-\nassessment of the effectiveness of their risk management pro-\ncesses. Boards may be unsure as to whether the ERM processes\nimplemented by management are appropriate and consistent\nwith emerging best practices, and they may question whether\nthose processes generate risk information that the board and\nmanagement can use to design and implement strategies to pro-\ntect and enhance stakeholder value. In summary, boards are in\nneed of information to help them fulfill their risk governance\noversight responsibilities.\nTo respond to this need, we examine the emerging body of\nERM-related research to provide insights relevant to board of\ndirector risk governance responsibilities. While the overall vol-\nume and extent of ERM research is relatively small, we review\nthe emerging academic literature on ERM by performing sev-\neral searches for articles that provide insights related to ques-\ntions boards may have in regard to enterprise risk governance.\nSpecifically, we summarize findings from ERM research that\nprovides insights to the following questions related to the\nboard's two primary risk governance responsibilities:\n1. Research insights to inform the board as it assumes\nresponsibility for understanding and approving man-\nagement's risk management processes that address\nthese questions:\na. What types of organizations adopt ERM as a\nrisk management paradigm?\nb. What techniques comprise an ERM process?\nc. What is the role of internal audit (IA) in ERM?\n2. Research insights to inform the board as it assumes\nresponsibility for evaluating risk information gener-\nated by ERM processes as it governs management's\nstrategic actions to protect and enhance stakeholder\nvalue that address these questions:\na. How are organizations integrating ERM pro-\ncesses with strategy?\nb. How does ERM affect firm value and perfor-\nmance?\nc. How does organizational culture affect the value\nof ERM?\nWe believe the emerging stream of academic research\nabout ERM provides insights to boards as they assume\nresponsibilities for risk governance. To synthesize that\nresearch for boards and other governance players, we sum-\nmarize key insights by organizing our review of the key find-\nings along the above questions. One of our goals is to\nsynthesize this research to inform boards as they assume\ngreater risk oversight responsibilities.\nBecause research on ERM is still emerging, we also\nbelieve there is significant opportunity for future research to\nprovide additional analysis of a number of issues related to\nenterprise-wide risk management. Building on a model simi-\nlar to Bromiley, McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov (2015),\nwho reviewed ERM literature to promote research by man-\nagement scholars, we review ERM research to develop a\nnumber of ERM-related questions to be examined by gover-\nnance scholars (including those in accounting, auditing, and\nfinance), which is a second goal of this study.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows.\nThe next section summarizes our methodology for identi-\nfying ERM-related research, and the following section\nsummarizes key findings from articles that provide insights\nto inform the board as it assumes responsibility for under-\nstanding and approving management's risk management\nprocesses. We also include calls for additional research to\nprovide additional insights related to that responsibility.\nThe subsequent section summarizes key findings from\narticles that provide insights to the board as it assumes\nresponsibility for evaluating risk information generated by\nERM processes as it governs management's strategic\nactions to protect and enhance stakeholder value. That sec-\ntion also includes identification of a number of additional\nresearch topics relevant to the board. Finally, we provide\noverall conclusions.\nMethodology for Reviewing ERM\nAcademic Literature\nWe conducted several searches for articles to include in this\nreview, focusing mostly on topics related to ERM. Using the\nelectronic databases EBSCO, ProQuest, Science Direct, and\nGoogle Scholar, we searched on \"ERM,\" \"risk,\" \"enter-\nprise,\" and \"COSO.\" The search was limited primarily to\narticles published after 1999, as ERM emerged mostly in the\n2000s. While some articles from financial and insurance\njournals are included in this review, overall, we have\nexcluded most highly technical, industry-specific research\nthat does not directly address ERM. The references in each\nof the articles selected for review were examined to identify\nadditional articles that may not have been found in the search\nof the electronic databases. The focus was on published aca-\ndemic journal articles, but selected working papers have\nbeen included as well. Thus, we summarize the key findings\nfrom ERM-related research papers to provide insights rele-\nvant to the board's two overarching risk governance respon-\nsibilities (see Figure 1).\nViscelli et al. 3\nResearch Insights Related to Board's\nRole in Assessing Management's ERM\nProcesses\nAs expectations for more effective board risk governance\nhave emerged, boards are being held accountable for under-\nstanding and approving management's processes for manag-\ning enterprise-wide risks. For example, the NYSE's\ngovernance rules place explicit responsibilities on the audit\ncommittee of the board to \"discuss management's risk man-\nagement and risk assessment processes,\" and the SEC's\nproxy disclosure rules implemented in 2010 require public\ncompanies to include disclosures about the board's role in\nrisk oversight in the annual proxy statement (NYSE, 2004;\nAs boards assume greater responsibility for governance of\nmanagement's risk oversight processes, they face a number\nof questions relevant to their obtaining an understanding of\nand approving management's approach to enterprise-wide\nrisk oversight:\na. What types of organizations adopt ERM as a risk man-\nagement paradigm?\nb. What techniques comprise an ERM process?\nc. What is the role of IA in ERM?\nWe use these questions as a framework for organizing our\nunderstanding of insights from ERM-related research per-\nformed to date, and we build upon that to generate a number\nof research topics that governance scholars may consider for\nfuture examination. See Table 1 for a summary of the\ninsights.\nOrganizational Characteristics of ERM Adopters\nIn light of limitations associated with traditional risk man-\nagement, a number of organizations have begun to adopt\nERM. The goal of ERM is to manage risks at an enterprise\nlevel to ensure that entity-wide risks to the organization have\nbeen assessed, rather than just one aspect of risk to the orga-\nnization. As boards of directors respond to the increasing\nexpectations for more effective board risk governance, many\nare placing pressure on senior executives to implement ERM.\nHowever, in making that decision, boards may question\nwhether the implementation of ERM in their organization\nmakes sense.\nColquitt, Hoyt, and Lee (1999) conducted one of the first\nstudies on risk management as it applied to risk financing\nstrategies, describing it as Integrated Risk Management. The\nauthors surveyed 379 firms and found that the role of risk\nmanager was growing in scope to integrate across the organi-\nzation, beyond traditional financial risk management.\nIndustry and firm size also were associated with a more inte-\ngrated approach to risk management and affected the finan-\ncial tools used to oversee risk.\nSubsequent studies examine organizational factors and\nfinancial characteristics of entities that adopt ERM to under-\nstand factors that affect the embrace of ERM as a risk man-\nagement paradigm. However, as firms do not usually\nannounce when they are embarking on an ERM implementa-\ntion, it can be difficult for researchers to determine who has\nimplemented ERM. Some researchers have used announce-\nments of appointments of individuals to serve as chief risk\nofficer (CRO) or disclosures of ERM activities as proxies for\nERM adoption, while others have surveyed companies to\nunderstand their stage of ERM adoption.\nUsing the announcement of a CRO as a signal of ERM\nimplementation, Liebenberg and Hoyt (2003) found that\nfirms announcing a CRO were among the largest in their\nindustry and were primarily in the financial and energy\nindustries. While they did not find significant differences in\nfirms' ownership (institutional vs. individual shareholders),\nthe study did show a relationship between higher leverage\nand a greater likelihood to announce a CRO appointment.\nPagach and Warr (2011) also used the announcement of a\nCRO as a signal of ERM adoption to provide additional anal-\nysis of firmwide factors that might explain an entity's ERM\nimplementation. The study found that firms with higher lev-\nels of leverage and larger size (assets) were more likely to\nannounce the appointment of a CRO, consistent with\nLiebenberg and Hoyt (2003). In addition, they found that\nmore volatile operating cash flows and greater stock volatil-\nity were positively associated with the announcement of a\nCRO. Contrary to findings of Liebenberg and Hoyt, who did\nBoard's Role in Assessing\nERM\nBoard Evaluation of Risk\nInformation Future Research\nCharacteristics of\nERM Adopters\nStrategy and ERM Appendix A\nERM Implementation ERM and Firm Value\nand Performance\nAppendix B\nInternal Audit and\nERM\nCulture and ERM\nFigure 1. Overview of analysis.\nNote. ERM = enterprise risk management.\n4 SAGE Open\nnot find a difference in ownership structure between ERM\nadopters and the control group, Pagach and Warr found that\nfirms with a high percentage of shares owned by institutional\ninvestors were more likely to have announced a CRO\nappointment, consistent with institutions' desire for greater\nrisk control. In a subsample of firms where CEO compensa-\ntion could be determined, Pagach and Warr found that firms\nwhere CEO compensation was sensitive to stock volatility\nwere more likely to have a CRO.\nIn a study of U.S. insurers with ERM initiatives found\nusing a word search, Hoyt and Liebenberg (2011) found that\nfirms that have ERM initiatives were larger in size (assets)\nand had more institutional ownership, consistent with Pagach\nand Warr (2011). They did not find any significant associa-\ntion between the extent of leverage, stock return volatility, or\nopaqueness and the presence of ERM, as had been found in\nsome previous studies. In another study of U.S. insurers, Lin,\nWen, and Yu (2012) performed a similar word search and\nfound that firms that had implemented ERM had more rein-\nsurance and had greater geographic diversification compared\nwith firms that had not implemented ERM.\nLundqvist (2014a) examined the relationship between\nERM and credit risk management for a sample of banking\ninstitutions. The author found that credit risk was reduced as\nthe level of ERM quality increased. No significant relation-\nship was found between ERM quality and credit rating when\ncontrolling for governance characteristics such as board\nindependence, large ownership by a group, and corporate\ngovernance measured by Thompson Reuters ASSET4 envi-\nronmental, social, and governance (ESG) content. The author\nexplains this last finding by suggesting that the market per-\nhaps values the risk management function itself, while the\ncredit rating agencies focus on risk governance aspects.\nOther studies have used different proxies for ERM imple-\nmentation. Beasley, Clune, and Hermanson (2005) explored\norganizational factors and their relationship to the stage of\nERM implementation, based on surveys completed by internal\nauditors. Like other studies that focus on the association of\nfirm characteristics and ERM implementation, they found\nfirm size (revenues) was positively related to the stage of\nERM. In addition, the study found firms that had a CRO, more\nindependent directors, or explicit ERM calls from the CEO\nTable 1. Summary of Research Insights.\nBoard's role in assessing ERM Board evaluation of risk information\nCharacteristics of ERM adopters Strategy and ERM\nCertain firmwide characteristics, such as size and industry,\nand certain board and other governance characteristics\nmay be important factors that explain the decision by an\norganization to adopt ERM; however, there are mixed\nresults related to other organizational factors and financial\ncharacteristics of firms that may be associated with ERM\nimplementations.\nWhile ERM is envisioned to provide an organization the opportunity\nto manage risks to achieving its strategic objectives, the limited\nacademic research suggests that the integration of ERM and strategy\nhas not been fully achieved, and organizations are struggling to fully\nleverage the strategic benefits of ERM.\nERM implementation ERM and firm value and performance\nOnly a few studies specifically address the use of ERM\nframeworks, and they tend to focus on the COSO\nframework. Organizations might rely to some extent\non those frameworks, but they are not likely to have\nimplemented significant aspects of them. Articles that\npresent specific case studies of firms adopting ERM show\nthat ERM implementation varies widely across firms, even\nin the same industry. There is no one way to implement\nERM, and organizations have approached the launch of\nERM in a number of different ways. The limited access\nto data about specific techniques and internal processes\nused by organizations as they implement ERM has\nlimited the ability to conduct academic research about\nthe effectiveness of those processes. There is limited\nknowledge about specific factors that may affect the\neffectiveness of any number of ERM processes.\nBetter firm performance and increases in shareholder value are often\nused as arguments to embrace ERM. There is some research that\ncontains evidence that ERM provides value, which is measured in\ndifferent ways across those studies. While there is a general theme\nthat ERM is associated with enhanced firm value, a number of those\nstudies are limited to the insurance industry.\nCulture and ERM\nOrganizational culture has a significant impact on the decision to\nimplement ERM and on the effectiveness of that implementation.\nWithout sufficient support of ERM by the CEO or board of\ndirectors, organizations may struggle in their efforts to find strategic\nvalue in their ERM processes. Research about the role of culture in\nthe context of ERM is limited.\nInternal audit and ERM\nInternal auditors have facilitated a number of ERM\nimplementations, and there are concerns about\nthe potential compromising of IA's objectivity and\nindependence when IA assumes responsibility for ERM\nimplementation.\nNote. ERM = enterprise risk management; COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Organization; IA = internal audit.\nViscelli et al. 5\nand CFO were more likely to be at a more advanced stage of\nERM, suggesting that top management support for ERM is\ncritical for ERM implementation. Firms that engaged a Big\nFour auditor were also found to be further along in ERM\nimplementation than were firms using smaller auditing firms.\nFirms in the banking, education, and financial industries were\nat a more advanced stage of ERM implementation than other\nindustries. Finally, the study found that U.S. firms were less\nadvanced in ERM implementation stage than international\nfirms.\nUsing a sample of 825 firms located in the Netherlands,\nPaape and Spekle (2012) used the stage of ERM implemen-\ntation (based on an ordinal scale of 1 to 5 with 4 to 5 being\nadopters of ERM and 1 to 3 having traditional, silo\napproaches to risk) to examine firm characteristics of those\nwith more advanced ERM. They found larger firms and\nfirms in financial industries were further along in ERM\nstage, and stock ownership was not found to be significant,\nwhich is consistent with findings in Liebenberg and Hoyt\n(2003). Unlike some of the other studies focused on ERM\nimplementation, they did not find a relationship between\nhaving a Big Four auditor and ERM development. The\nauthors also found that publicly traded firms, firms with a\nCRO, and those with an audit committee were further along\nin ERM implementation.\nBaxter, Bedard, Hoitash, and Yezegel (2013) used S&P\nERM quality ratings for banking and insurance industry\nfirms to investigate variations in firm characteristics in rela-\ntion to ERM ratings. Their results showed that companies\nwith higher ERM ratings were more complex, had greater\nfinancial resources, and had better corporate governance.\nThey also found that higher risk firms had lower quality rat-\nings, which they attributed to resource constraints limiting\nthe investment in ERM.\nNordic stock exchanges across multiple industries and found\nthat firms implementing ERM are larger, in line with Beasley\nFour auditor did not affect risk governance, and firms in the\nfinancial industry were marginally more advanced in ERM,\nconsistent with previous studies (Beasley et al., 2005;\nLiebenberg & Hoyt, 2003). In addition, the quality of the\nERM governance and the following year's extent of leverage\nwere positively related, consistent with limiting the use of\nfree cash available to well-monitored managers. Finally,\nunlike prior research, organizations with higher leverage\nwere less likely to have embraced ERM.\nWith the passage of Sarbanes\u00adOxley Act of 2002 (SOX),\nexternal auditors and corporate boards were assigned spe-\ncific responsibilities for risk assessments related to financial\ncan leverage SOX Section 404's requirement that manage-\nment and auditors attest to the state of internal control over\nfinancial reporting effectiveness to promote the evaluation of\nrisk at an enterprise level. Arnold, Benford, Canada, Kuhn,\nand Sutton (2007) found in a study of four firms that all of\nthe firms believed their ERM was made more effective by\nthe effort to become SOX compliant, but it was an \"unin-\ntended\" consequence of the 404 compliance effort.\nMany companies have either board-level or management-\nlevel committees that have responsibility for ERM imple-\nmentation. Previous studies identified as a limitation the\nability to identify these firms. Subramaniam, McManus, and\nZhang (2009) used the presence of a Risk Management\nCommittee (RMC), as disclosed in a firm's annual report, to\nStock Exchange listed companies. Unlike some previous\nstudies, they did not find a significant relation between ERM\nadoption and financial industry, board independence, or\nleverage. The authors did find that an independent board\nchair and larger boards were positively related to the pres-\nence of an RMC, as was organizational complexity as mea-\nsured by the number of firm segments. Like Paape and\nSpekle (2012), having a Big Four auditor was not related to\nhaving an RMC.\nHines and Peters (2015) found that firms within the finan-\ncial industry that formed an RMC had higher leverage (unlike\nSubramaniam et al., 2009); had a larger, more independent\nboard; and were more likely to have a Big Four auditor. The\nauthors also found that lower financial quality, international\nbanking activity, and merger and acquisition activity where\nrelated to having an RMC.\nKey implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to\naddress our first question of interest (What types of organiza-\ntions adopt ERM as a risk management paradigm?) reveals\nthat that certain firmwide characteristics, such as size and\nindustry, and certain governance characteristics may be\nimportant factors that explain the decision by an organization\nto adopt ERM. In particular, most studies find that larger\nfirms and firms in certain regulated industries, particularly\nfinancial services and insurance, are associated with ERM\nadoptions. We also observe in some studies that certain gov-\nernance factors, such as the level of board engagement, inde-\npendence, and the presence of institutional investors, are also\nassociated with ERM adoptions. Other factors, such as lever-\nage, stock price or cash flow volatility, and the presence of a\nBig Four auditor are sometimes associated with a firm's deci-\nsion to implement ERM. We summarize these insights in\nOpportunities for future research.The mixed results suggest\nthe need for additional studies of the relationship of organi-\nzational factors and firm-level financial characteristics with\nERM initiatives. There are a number of research questions\nrelated to firm- or industry-level characteristics that might\naffect a firm's decision to implement ERM that warrant fur-\nther analysis. Column A of Appendix A includes a summary\nof these research questions.\n6 SAGE Open\nERM Implementation Process\nWhile boards of directors and senior executives may concep-\ntually embrace ERM, they often face a number of questions\nrelated to how organizations are implementing ERM to\nensure its effectiveness in risk oversight. Because ERM is a\nrelatively recent business paradigm, organizational leaders,\nincluding the board, have been calling for insights to help\nthem understand specific processes that are needed when\nimplementing ERM. A number of practitioner articles have\nbeen published with insights and suggestions related to pro-\ncesses important when implementing ERM. Some articles\nprovide detailed steps, activities, and tools that should be\nused, while others describe individual firms that have imple-\nmented ERM, but not necessarily how they did it.\nA number of ERM frameworks have been developed over\nthe last decade to assist organizations in their design and\nimplementation of ERM (COSO, 2004; International\nOrganization for Standardization [ISO], 2009). When a\nboard and its senior management team decide to implement\nERM, they may seek conceptual frameworks related to ERM\nto guide the design of their ERM processes. In doing so, they\nmay question what frameworks exist and which framework(s)\nare embraced by other organizations. Although only a few\nstudies specifically address the use of ERM frameworks, we\nexamine that research to summarize insights related to ERM\nconceptual frameworks.\nIn light of the prominence of COSO as a thought leader in\nERM, Hayne and Free (2014) sought to understand the rise\nof the COSO framework to its point of prominence in risk\nmanagement. The authors describe the processes and mecha-\nnisms used by COSO to create the COSO ERM framework\nand enable it to become so dominant. Through a series of\ninterviews with key stakeholders in risk management and\nanalysis of secondary documentation, the authors describe\nthe creation of \"hybrid\" professional groups and the impact\nof these groups on the eventual adoption of the framework.\nTekathen and Dechow (2013) studied a German organiza-\ntion while it implemented ERM by using semi-structured\ninterviews to understand how the organization implemented\nERM. Because the organization professed to having used the\nCOSO ERM framework, the authors compared the insights\nfrom the interviews with the COSO ERM framework to\ndetermine a fit to the framework. The authors stated that the\nCOSO framework was based on \"radical assumptions,\" and\nthey asserted that the COSO framework implies that experts,\nexpertise, and eventualities are aligned within an organiza-\ntion. The authors did not find this alignment in practice and\nconcluded that ERM is not effective in reducing uncertainty,\nbut instead increases the organization's interaction with\nuncertainty, unless processes are designed to support the\nalignment.\nPaape and Spekle (2012) addressed the actual use of an\nERM framework, in particular the COSO ERM framework,\nby 825 firms based in the Netherlands. The authors reported\nthat 43% of the firms indicated they used the COSO\nframework, but the study only dichotomously captured the\nuse of the framework (i.e., framework used or not used) and\ndid not provide any detail as to how much or how the frame-\nwork was used.\nBeyond studying the use of ERM frameworks, the ability\nto conduct rigorous academic research about ERM imple-\nmentation processes has been significantly limited by the lack\nof publicly available data about specific internal tools and\ntechniques used as part of the risk oversight process. To\naddress this limitation, studies that have focused on specific\ntechniques used by firms when implementing ERM typically\nhave used a case study approach or surveys to examine inter-\nnal activities that are associated with ERM implementations.\nArticles that present specific case studies of firms adopt-\ning ERM show that ERM implementation varies widely\nacross firms, even in the same industry.1 Arena, Arnaboldi,\nand Azzone (2010) studied three non-financial Italian firms\nover a 7-year period. All three firms professed to have an\nenterprise-wide risk management process, but each firm's\napproach and resulting ERM process was influenced by the\nfirm's risk rationale. One firm's rationale for ERM was for\ncompliance, the second firm's rationale was for stronger cor-\nporate governance to provide external assurance, and the\nthird firm's rationale was to improve performance that would\nlead to enhanced company value. In another study, Arena,\nArnaboldi, and Azzone (2011), again studied non-financial\nfirms to understand the extent of ERM use and the relation-\nship of ERM use to the characteristics of the ERM tools\nimplemented. The authors found that firms that used ERM\nfor proactive actions, such as planning at the strategic level,\nhad ERM tools that were highly integrated through the orga-\nnization at all levels and risk was centrally managed. The\nstudy also found that the role played by the ERM coordinator\nmust include interaction with managers at all levels to help\nthose managers understand the value of ERM and to encour-\nage open discussions across functional areas of the risks.\nA working paper by Mikes and Kaplan (2014) used con-\ntingency theory to identify design parameters that can explain\nvariation in how three different case study organizations\nimplemented ERM. Using interviews over the period of\ndetail at the three organizations. They classify the implemen-\ntation into three fundamental risk management components\nand then classify the types of risks each firm encountered\ninto three categories.2 The authors found that organizations\napproached risk management in different ways, and the\nauthors ultimately proposed that risk management is contin-\ngent on the organization's nature and ability to control differ-\nent types of risks, which supports the view that risk\nmanagement is different for each firm.\nIn a single-organization study, Aabo, Fraser, and Simkins\n(2005) studied ERM implementation at a Canadian electric\ncompany. They chronicle the process beginning with the cre-\nation of a CRO position. The authors describe the actual pro-\ncess including the techniques and tools that were used by the\nfirm. The successful implementation of ERM integrated risk\nViscelli et al. 7\ninto the workplace to the extent that the CRO position evolved\ninto a low-maintenance position within the company.\nTwo articles examine the use of risk maps in the imple-\nmentation of ERM. Woods (2009) performed a case study\nfocused on a public sector entity's risk management control\nsystem to examine whether risk management systems are\nsimilar across large organizations by comparing the risk pro-\ncess with the Institute of Risk Management (IRM; 2002)\nmodel. Because the organization's process was easily\nmapped to the IRM model, the author argued that large orga-\nnizations' overall risk processes are similar, as many organi-\nzations are following the IRM model. Woods also described\nthe use of heat maps (risk maps) to rank the organization's\nrisks on a scale from tolerable to material to severe (traffic\nlight), which determines the level of control and monitoring\n(the resulting level of control and monitoring is the risk con-\ntrol system for the organization). The author concluded that\nthe control system was affected by government policy, tech-\nnology, and organization size.\nJordan, J\u00f8rgensen, and Mitterhofer (2013) examined the\nuse of risk maps in the Norwegian petroleum industry as a\nway to represent risks within project management. They\nfound that risk maps are being used to negotiate the boundar-\nies of different project areas. The appearance of a risk object\non a risk map resulted in it being more likely to be discussed.\nThe risk maps were used to mediate concerns between groups\nand resulted in topics not shown being avoided, thus setting\nboundaries on the meeting discussions. Overall, the risk\nmaps were used to create project identity, increase commit-\nment to the project, and mediate between different groups in\nthe company.\nStudies that used surveys have each developed their own\nset of questions and surveyed a variety of groups, such as the\nAmerican Institute of Certified PublicAccountants (AICPA),\nThe Conference Board, companies listed on the two Nordic\nstock exchanges, and firms based in the Netherlands. Paape\nand Spekle (2012) examined design choices of ERM by\nfirms and the effects of the choices on risk management\neffectiveness. The authors found that the frequency of risk\nassessments and risk reporting and the use of quantitative\napproaches are associated with higher stages of ERM imple-\nmentation. They also found that use of the COSO framework\ndid not contribute to higher risk management effectiveness.\nAnother article based on the COSO ERM framework,\nGates, Nicolas, and Walker (2012), surveyed Conference\nBoard member firms to study the practical side of ERM.3\nBased on 150 completed responses, the authors modeled the\ndirect impact that each of the components has on the subse-\nquent component beginning with objective setting through\nperformance. The study found that a structured approach to\nrisk management can result in enhanced management and\nimproved performance.\nBeasley, Branson, and Pagach (2015) examined specific\nrisk management processes associated with greater ERM\nmaturity using a sample of 645 organizations across a number\nof industries. They found ERM maturity to be positively asso-\nciated with boards of directors that are more actively engaged\nin risk oversight. ERM maturity also was positively related to\norganizations with risk management responsibilities assigned\nto a board committee, formal risk management reports to the\nboard, and a formally articulated risk appetite.\ntwo Nordic stock exchanges to understand ERM implemen-\ntation and found four ERM implementation factors: (1) gen-\neral internal environment and objective setting, (2) specific\nrisk identification and risk assessment activities, (3) holistic\norganization of risk management, and (4) general control\nactivities and information and communication. Lundqvist\nexplained that Factors 1 and 4 could be viewed as \"prerequi-\nsites\" of an ERM implementation because they are necessary\nto support ERM but can exist without any effort toward risk\nmanagement. Factor 2 represents efforts by the organization\nto manage certain types of risks, such as financial and com-\npliance. Lundqvist identified Factor 3 as the true ERM iden-\ntifier. Factor 3 represents organizational activities such as a\nformal, written risk appetite definition, senior management\nresponsible for overseeing risk and risk management, and\nformal risk management reports provided to the board on a\nregular schedule. These activities are typical of firms\napproaching risk holistically the definition of ERM.\nIttner and Oyon's (2014) data consisted of responses from\nthe corporate-level finance and risk executives of 1,051\ninternational firms in multiple industries. The authors found\nthat the breath of functional and hierarchical ownership of\nrisk is positively associated with the sophistication of a\nfirm's ERM implementation and that management practices\nare more closely associated with the levels and functions of\nthe risk owners, not the number of owners. When the CFO of\na firm has risk ownership, significantly larger contributions\nare made to a wider range of strategic and operational risks.\nFinally, Viscelli, Hermanson, and Beasley (2016) con-\nducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 ERM\nchampions representing 14 organizations headquartered in\nthe United States to gain insight into how firms actually\nimplement ERM. They found that most firms began their\nprocess by developing a list of risks. Very few of the firms\nprovided formal education on ERM to the employees\ninvolved in the ERM implementation. Most of the organiza-\ntions did not define risk appetite. The most positive ERM\nimpact on the firm was greater risk awareness, risk manage-\nment, and risk mitigation, and more timely dissemination of\nrisk information was identified as the Number 1 change to\nthe firm.\nKey implications for boards. Akey \"takeaway\" from our analy-\nsis of ERM research to address our second question of inter-\nest (What techniques comprise an ERM process?) is that\nthere is no one specific approach used by organizations to\nimplement ERM. While several organizations mentioned\nthey have found some benefit in considering aspects of an\nERM framework, such as COSO (2004), our review of the\n8 SAGE Open\nresearch suggests that organizations approach the launch of\nERM in a number of different ways, and they have not\nfocused on implementing all elements laid out in an ERM\nframework. Some start by leveraging existing processes,\nwhile others start by appointing individuals to serve in new\nCRO roles or they create a RMC among the executive team\nto launch the process. But, one common aspect noted in sev-\neral studies is that most organizations engaged management\nin an initial risk identification task early in an ERM launch,\nand a number of those organizations used \"heat maps (risk\nmaps)\" to summarize the most important risks identified.\nOpportunities for future research.The limited access to data\nabout specific techniques and internal processes used by\norganizations as they implement ERM has limited the ability\nto conduct academic research about the effectiveness of\nthose processes. There is limited knowledge about specific\nfactors that may affect the effectiveness of any number of\nERM processes. Research that sheds insights into tools and\ntechniques, including both their advantages and disadvan-\ntages, would be extremely beneficial to better understand\nfactors that strengthen an entity's overall risk oversight. As\nresearchers can gain access to data about specific ERM\nimplementations, there are a number of important research\nquestions specific to ERM implementation processes that\nwarrant academic study by governance scholars. We sum-\nmarize a number of research questions related to ERM\nimplementations in column B of Appendix A.\nInternal Auditing and ERM\nIn response to growing expectations for more effective board\nrisk governance, a number of boards have called upon IA to\nassist them with their ERM efforts. In many organizations,\nthe audit committee of the board is responsible for oversight\nof the IA function, and there are direct lines of communica-\ntion between IA and the board via the audit committee.\nBecause IA has an enterprise-wide focus and because IA pro-\ncedures are often risk-based, a number of boards of directors\nhave initially assigned responsibility for ERM leadership to\nIA. However, in doing so, some boards may question what\nIA's role in ERM should be, and they may have concerns\nabout how ERM leadership affects IA's objectivity.\nThe IA function, especially the chief audit executive, is\nfrequently tasked with the leadership of ERM implementa-\ntion (Viscelli et al., 2016). While there is disagreement in the\nIA community about how closely the Institute of Internal\nAuditors (IIA; 2004) guidelines about IA involvement in\nERM should be followed, there is agreement that IA should\nnever \"own\" risk, because owning the risk would jeopardize\nIA's independence and objectivity in evaluating risk (Jackson,\n2005). Several articles discuss the appropriate role of the IA\nfunction in ERM.\nThe IIA released a position paper, The Role of Internal\nAuditing in Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (IIA, 2004),\nshortly after COSO (2004) released its ERM framework. The\nIIA provided guidance on the roles internal auditors should\nor should not perform in risk management, and it stated that\nIA's core role is to \"provide objective assurance to the board\non the effectiveness of risk management\" (p. 3). Some prac-\ntice-based polls of IA practitioners provide some insights\nabout consistency with the IIA guidelines. For example,\nGramling and Myers (2006) found in a survey that the\nresponsibilities held by internal auditors differed somewhat\nfrom The IIA's guidelines, but that internal auditors under-\nstood the guidance. Also, Sobel (2011) surveyed IIA mem-\nbers through the IIA's Global Audit Information (GAIN)\nFlash system and found that IA was not participating in core\nERM roles, consistent with IIA guidelines on ERM imple-\nmentation. In addition, Thompson (2013) provided a frame-\nwork that can be used to evaluate the potential conflicts that\nan internal auditor might face while implementing ERM.\nFraser and Henry (2007) found in a study of U.K. compa-\nnies that internal auditors were playing a bigger role in ERM\nthan recommended by the IIA, and there was concern that\nthey were doing so at the risk of losing independence.\nInterviews revealed that internal auditors were in the role of\nrisk management facilitators and consultants, rather than\nevaluators of risk management processes. This raised the\nquestion of whether the internal auditors were maintaining\ntheir independence.\nBeasley, Clune, and Hermanson (2008) focused on the\nmacro-level impact of ERM on IA. They surveyed 122 firms\nand found that, overall, ERM implementation positively\naffects IA by expanding IA's work as the organization pro-\ngressed through its implementation. This is not surprising, as\nERM implementation requires significant resources, and, as\noutlined by The IIA's guidelines, there are many roles for IA\nin the process. The authors also found a greater impact on IA\nby ERM when the CFO and audit committee have called for\nIA to have greater involvement in the ERM process and\nwhen IA has a greater role in leadership of the ERM imple-\nmentation. This suggests that CFOs and audit committees\nmay recommend that IA take a leadership role, thus leading\nto an impact on IA resources, which could lead to a loss of\nindependence. The authors did not conclude whether greater\nIA involvement in ERM was helpful or harmful to IA's inde-\npendence and objectivity.\nKey implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to\naddress our third question of interest (What is the role of IA\nin ERM?) indicates that IA has played an active role in the\ninitial launch of ERM in a number of organizations. In some\nways, this is not surprising given the board of directors often\ndelegates day-to-day responsibility for the board's risk over-\nsight to the audit committee. Because the audit committee\nhas direct oversight responsibility over IA, it is not surpris-\ning that boards, through their audit committees, have asked\nIA to assume some ERM leadership. However, that has led to\nconcerns about continuing to use IA in an ERM leadership\nrole. A number of studies have called attention to the impact\nof IA's leadership of ERM on its ability to\nViscelli et al. 9\nobjectively evaluate the functioning and effectiveness of the\norganization's ERM processes. Boards may benefit from\nconsidering whether IA should continue in its ERM leader-\nship role.\nOpportunities for future research. Because many ERM imple-\nmentations have been facilitated by internal auditors, there\nare a number of research questions related to the impact of\nthat reality. Although most IA functions use a risk-based\napproach to their audit scoping, it is uncertain the extent to\nwhich IA activities focus on risks beyond operations, finan-\ncial reporting, and compliance into those risks related to\nstrategy. In addition, while there are concerns about the\npotential compromising of IA objectivity and independence\nwhen IA assumes responsibility for ERM implementation,\nthere is limited research as to whether that concern can be\nempirically supported. In response, we summarize, in col-\numn C of Appendix A, a number of future research questions\nthat governance scholars could examine to provide addi-\ntional insights about the role of IA in ERM.\nResearch Insights Related to Board's Evaluation\nof Risk Information Generated by ERM Processes\nIn addition to responsibilities related to understanding and\napproving management's approach to risk oversight, boards\nalso are responsible for understanding risk information out-\nput from the ERM process as part of the board's oversight of\nmanagement. Conceptually, ERM is a process designed to\nincrease the likelihood that entity objectives are achieved\n(COSO, 2004). Thus, ultimately, ERM is designed to provide\nstrategic value. But, as boards evaluate information gener-\nated by ERM processes in organizations they serve, they may\nhave questions about how organizations integrate ERM with\nthe strategy of the organization, and they may ask whether\nERM processes actually enhance stakeholder value. We\nexamine ERM-related research to summarize insights to\nthese governance questions:\na. How are organizations integrating ERM processes\nwith strategy?\nb. How does ERM affect firm value and performance?\nc. How does organizational culture affect the value of\nWe use these questions as a framework for organizing our\nunderstanding of insights from ERM-related research per-\nformed to date and we build upon that to generate a number\nof future research topics that governance scholars may con-\nsider for future examination.\nERM and Strategy\nThe COSO (2004) framework emphasizes that ERM is a pro-\ncess \"applied in strategy setting\" designed \"to provide rea-\nsonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity\nobjectives\" (p. 2). That definition indicates that ERM is\nintended to focus on the management of risks affecting the\nstrategy a firm uses to achieve its objectives. Similarly, Frigo\nand Anderson (2011) stated that ERM must take place within\na strategic setting to actually create value.4 Despite these\nassertions, the academic literature indicates that firms typi-\ncally are struggling to effectively link ERM to strategy.5\nBeasley, Branson, and Pagach (2015) examined firm-spe-\ncific factors associated with the perceived strategic value of\nERM, using a sample of 645 organizations across a number\nof industries. They found that ERM is more likely to be\nviewed as a strategic tool when the organization has stated its\nrisk appetite in the strategic planning process and when the\nboard of directors receives, at least annually, a management\nreport describing top risks. As for management-level pro-\ncesses, they found greater linkage of ERM and strategy when\nthe organization has a management-level risk committee,\nprovides ERM training to executives, and regularly updates\nthe key risk inventories. Interestingly, they also found that\nthe presence of an explicit relationship between executive\ncompensation and risk management increases the perceived\nstrategic value of ERM. In addition, larger firms were more\nlikely to view ERM as a strategic tool, while private firms\nwere more likely than public firms to view ERM as value\nadding.\nCohen, Krishnamoorthy, and Wright (2014) interviewed\nCFOs, audit committee members, and audit partners within\nthe same firms (which they referred to as the governance\ntriad) for 11 organizations. They found that CFOs and audit\ncommittee members more often included strategic elements\nin their definition of ERM than did audit partners. In only\ntwo of the organizations did all three members of the gover-\nnance triad mention strategy. Of the remaining organizations,\nhalf had triads where the majority of the triad members noted\nstrategy in their responses, and in most of those triads, the\naudit committee member and the CFO were the ones noting\nthe strategy connection most often. When asked about their\nindividual role in addressing risks related to the four objec-\ntives (strategic, operational, reporting, and compliance) out-\nlined in the COSO (2004) ERM framework, the CFOs and\nthe audit committee members were more likely to respond\nthat they played a significant role in assessing risks related to\nthe strategic objective. The external auditors saw their role as\nweak in the assessment of risks related to the strategic objec-\ntive. The authors also reviewed the responses through the\nlens of agency theory and resource dependence theory. While\nthey found that ERM was mostly playing a monitoring role\n(agency theory), they did see it being used to balance corpo-\nrate strategy and business risks (resource dependence) in\nsome cases.\nViscelli et al. (2016) interviewed ERM champions in\n14 organizations and found that most of the organizations\nadopted ERM due to a \"strategic need to understand\nrisk.\" However, the most common area cited by inter-\nviewees for future improvement in the ERM process was\nthe link to strategic planning, and making ERM more a\npart of the organization's strategy was cited when asked\nabout goals for the ERM implementation over the next 3\nto 5 years. Overall, the responses seem to indicate that\nERM's strategic impact is limited and that the ERM\nimplementation process often begins with a resource\ndependence/strategic focus, but ultimately emerges as\nmore of an agency theory/monitoring tool. As a result, the\noverall impact of ERM is limited by the failure to tightly\nlink ERM and strategy.\nIn a study of 110 non-financial Canadian firms, Ben-\nAmar, Boujenoui, and Z\u00e9ghal (2014) found that a firm's risk\nmanagement approach is directed by the firm's corporate\nstrategy. Content analysis was performed on annual reports\nfor 2007 to examine risk management. The authors reported\nthat a firm's business sector affects the risk exposure level,\nperception of risk consequences, and risk management strat-\negy for both individual risks and risk categories.\nKey implications for boards. Akey \"takeaway\" from our analy-\nsis of ERM research to address our fourth question of interest\n(How are organizations integrating ERM processes with\nstrategy?) is that while ERM is envisioned to provide an\norganization the opportunity to identify and manage risks\nmost likely to affect the organization's achievement of its\nstrategic objectives, the integration of ERM and strategy has\nnot been fully achieved, and organizations are struggling to\nfully leverage the strategic benefits of ERM. Organizations\nthat have realized some strategic benefit are found to have\nboards of directors more engaged in the risk governance\nprocess.\nOpportunities for future research. Future research is needed on\nthe processes and activities used to incorporate ERM into\nstrategic planning, the related keys to how organizations\nhave successfully connected risk management and strategic\nplanning, and the extent that ERM is considered a priority for\nrunning the business. We summarize in column A of Appen-\ndix B a number of research questions related to the integra-\ntion of ERM and strategy that can be examined by governance\nscholars to provide insight to boards to help them properly\nposition risk governance for strategic value.\nFirm Value and Performance\nAs noted in the COSO definition of ERM, the goal of an\neffective ERM process is to increase the likelihood that orga-\nnizations achieve their objectives. Although that is conceptu-\nally appealing, a number of boards may question whether\nactual ERM implementations have demonstrated value-add-\ning contributions.6 To explore answers to that question, we\nexamine prior ERM research for insights about the associa-\ntion of ERM with firm value and performance.\nNocco and Stulz (2006) argued that the implementation of\nan integrated, holistic risk management environment (ERM)\ncan be used to create value by better managing risk at a\nmacro and micro level. By looking across the enterprise's\nrisks and coordinating them, ERM helps to ensure that no\nsingle project has a negative impact on the firm (Stulz, 1996).\nargued that ERM is lacking in solid empirical validation that\nthe comprehensiveness is worth the effort, and its adoption is\nlimited by its lack of solid theoretical support. The authors\nalso point out that ERM does not provide institutional design\nrecommendations.\nWhile ERM has been widely accepted, there has been\nsome resistance to the value proposition of ERM. For exam-\nple, Power (2009) argued that ERM encourages a \"logic of\nauditability,\" which results in process-based rules with an\never-expanding reach leading to \"the risk management of\neverything\" (Power, 2004). The author also argues that the\nnarratives of risk management cannot articulate nor compre-\nhend the interconnectedness of critical risks. Power (2009)\nsuggested that business continuity management (BCM) is a\nbetter way to manage risk because it potentially has a better\nconsideration of interconnectedness. Overall, Power (2009)\nsuggested that ERM ultimately can lead to the \"risk manage-\nment of nothing.\" These views illustrate how some question\nwhether ERM has the potential to be value adding.\nBeasley, Pagach, and Warr (2008) used announcements of\nappointments of senior executives into ERM roles such as\nCRO to proxy for the launch of ERM. In a sample of 120\nannouncements of a senior executive being appointed to an\nERM role, they found that there are significant relations\nbetween the magnitude of abnormal returns for the 2-day\nperiod surrounding the announcement and certain firm-spe-\ncific characteristics. The authors state,\nFor nonfinancial firms, announcement period returns are\npositively associated with firm size and the volatility of prior\nperiods' reported earnings and negatively associated with\nleverage and the extent of cash on hand relative to liabilities. For\nfinancial firms, however, there are fewer statistical associations\nbetween announcement returns and firm characteristics.\nOverall, the study found that the value of ERM is dependent\non the overall risk profile of the firm, with shareholders of\nhigher risk firms placing greater value on the announcements\nof CRO appointments relative to other firms.\nGordon, Loeb, and Tseng (2009) used a word search to iden-\ntify 122 firms that disclosed ERM activities. Using Compustat\ndata to measure strategy, operations, reporting, and compliance\n(the four objectives in COSO's ERM Framework), they devel-\noped an index of the effectiveness of a firm's ERM initiative.\nThe ERM effectiveness measure was then used in a regression\nwith independent variables representing firm characteristics.7\nThe authors used a subsample of high performance firms, as\nmeasured by 1-year excess stock returns (2% or better), to\nestablish coefficients (best practices) of the firm characteristics\nof high performing firms. The authors then developed an opti-\nmum ERM score, which was compared with actual ERM\nscores. They found that the smaller the difference in optimum\nscore and actual score, the greater the expected performance.\nThe results of the study indicated that firms whose ERM initia-\ntive characteristics were properly aligned with the firm's char-\nacteristics should experience greater firm performance.\nHoyt and Liebenberg (2011) performed a similar word\nsearch as Gordon et al. (2009) to identify insurance firms\nTobin's Q as a proxy for firm value, they found that firms\nwith an ERM initiative had a higher median change in value\nthan firms without an ERM initiative. On average, their\nresults showed that firms with ERM initiatives were valued\napproximately 4% higher than firms without an ERM initia-\ntive. However, unlike Hoyt and Liebenberg (2011), Lin et al.\n(2012) found that the market responded negatively to ERM\nadoption in a study of insurance firms using Tobin's Q and a\nsimilar word search to identify ERM adoption.\nMcShane, Nair, and Rustambekov (2011) also used\nTobin's Q as a proxy for firm value and the S&P ERM rat-\ning. The authors found that insurance firms experienced an\nincrease in firm value as the firms increased their risk man-\nagement sophistication in traditional risk categories. As\nthe firms moved beyond silo risk management to a coordi-\nnated (holistic) approach, the firms did not see an increase\nin firm value. This suggests that firms achieve a higher\nlevel of performance as the firm improves overall risk\nmanagement and controls, but further performance\nimprovement is not apparent as firms move into more\nadvanced ERM processes.\nannouncement of a CRO, and found that the market was\nmore likely to react positively, as measured by increase in\nstock price, if the organization had few outside directors,\nsuggesting that CRO appointments may lead to better\ngovernance.\nNair, Rustambekov, McShane, and Fainshmidt (2014)\nexamined 60 insurance firms during the 2008 financial crisis\nto determine if the ERM processes align with the dynamic\ncapabilities of the firm, allowing firms to better manage a\nchanging environment. They calculated the stock decline\n(S&P lowest point). Profitability return was calculated from\nthe lowest point and post-crisis high in April 2011. Using the\nS&P rating, translated to a scale of 1 (weak) to 5 (excellent),\nthey found that a superior ERM rating (5) resulted in a\nsmaller stock decline during the downturn and superior prof-\nitability during the recovery period.8\nfirm-years that received ERM ratings from S&P from 2006\nto 2008 to investigate the rating in relation to firm perfor-\nmance as measured by return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's\nQ. They found that firms with a higher ERM rating had\nhigher operating performance (ROA) and higher Tobin's Qs.\nThe authors attributed this to ERM helping to mitigate risks\nand/or allowing the firms to take advantage of opportunities.\nThe study also found that firms receiving a strong/excellent\nERM rating initially had a stronger market reaction to the\ndisclosure of the rating than those with lower ratings. In\naddition, they considered the time period before the global\nfinancial crisis, during the crisis, and after the crisis. They\nfound a strong relationship between higher ERM ratings and\nmarket value only after the crisis and attributed this to inves-\ntors looking for information such as the ERM rating to pro-\nvide insight into a firm's ability to address future risks.\nIn an additional study evaluating ERM maturity and firm\nvalue as measured by Tobin's Q, Farrell and Gallagher\n(2015) used the Risk Management Society (RIMS) risk\nmaturity model (RMM) to evaluate whether ERM maturity\nhad an impact on firm value. Using the results collected from\nindustries, the authors found that there is significant evi-\ndence that ERM maturity has a positive impact on firm value.\nFor firms with an overall RMM score of 3 to 5 (mature), firm\nvalue increased 25% and was highly significant as measured\nby Tobin's Q. All of the areas of the RMM online tool were\nfound to affect value, except risk appetite management and\nbusiness resilience and sustainability.\nIn a study of U.S. insurers who answered the Tillinghast\nPhillips, and Shimpi (2015) studied cash flow implications of\nthe adoption of ERM and found that organizations having a\ncross-functional dedicated risk manager who reported to the\nboard or CEO, along with a simple economic model, had sig-\nnificant increases in revenue and cost efficiency.\nKey implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to\naddress our fifth question of interest (How does ERM affect\nfirm value and performance?) reveals evidence that imple-\nmentations of ERM do affect positively different measures\nof firm value. Some studies find stock market reactions to\nERM implementation announcements, while others (but not\nall) find a relationship between ERM and firm value as mea-\nsured by Tobin's Q. Thus, there is empirical evidence that\nthere is a connection between ERM and value creation.\nOpportunities for future research. Because questions about the\nvalue relevance of ERM are often posed by boards of direc-\ntors and senior executives who may be reluctant to embrace\nERM as an effective risk oversight technique, further\nresearch is needed that might help to demonstrate whether, or\nwhen, ERM provides value to organizations. While there is\nsome research that suggests ERM does provide measurable\nvalue, more research is needed to expand our understanding\nof the various dimensions of value for ERM. We summarize\nin column B of Appendix B a number of research questions\nthat governance scholars could examine in future research.\nCulture and ERM\nThree of the major organizational change initiatives of recent\ndecades, reengineering, total quality management (TQM),\nand firm downsizing, have had less than stellar success\n(Cameron & Quinn, 2006). Lack of organizational culture fit\nto an initiative was given as a common reason for failure,\nleading to the belief that an organization's culture and strat-\negy must be aligned to be successful. As ERM is a change\ninitiative similar to the previously mentioned initiatives, it is\nreasonable to assume that an organization's culture would be\na significant factor in explaining the strategic value of ERM.\nMikes (2009) found in a longitudinal study of two banks that\ntwo cultures emerged, \"ERM by the Numbers,\" driven by a\nstrong shareholder value imperative, and \"Holistic ERM,\" driven\nby a risk-based internal-control imperative. The ERM by the\nNumbers firm relied heavily on calculations for quantitative risks,\nwhich resulted in a diagnostic risk model.The Holistic ERM firm\nquantified risks but did not rely solely on the numbers. Also,\nsenior risk managers with intimate knowledge of the business\nsectors responded to management's concerns and thus influenced\nthe actions beyond what the numbers might have shown.\nviduals in risk management positions at five major banks over\npursuit of expanding risk measurement in risk management\nwas leading to a dysfunctional environment, as espoused by\ndefined in Mikes (2009) explained why some organizations\nbecome committed to risk measurements, whereas others do\nnot. The author used boundary-work to suggest that organiza-\ntions that are \"ERM by the Numbers\" create risk measure-\nments that imply the expertise on risk lies in the risk\norganizations and can lead to greater organizational control.\nMikes described these organizations as having \"quantitative\nenthusiasm\" and being dedicated to risk measurements.\nOrganizations that approach ERM in a holistic manner focus\non combining risk measures with experience and intuition to\ndevelop soft measurements, which better reflect the risk of\nnon-measurable strategic risks. The approach seems to leave\nthe boundaries blurred as to where the expertise lies in an\norganization. These organizations were described as having\n\"quantitative skepticism\" and providing top management with\nalternative scenarios on emerging risks.\nCooper, Faseruk, and Khan (2013) performed a meta-\nanalysis of practitioner studies to determine the relationship\nbetween ERM and organizational culture. By grouping rele-\nvant questions from 14 major risk studies published from\nthe perspective that organizational culture was a \"major ben-\nefit\" or a \"major barrier\" to implementation of ERM. Their\nstudy did not put forth an answer to this question but did find\nthat a significant number of entities consider organizational\nculture important to ERM implementation.\nA common way of describing organizational culture is on\na continuum from mechanistic to organic (Burns & Stalker,\n1961). Mechanistic cultures have a chain of command struc-\nture in the form of rankings of positions, vertical communi-\ncation paths, and decisions driven down to employees from\ntop management. On the other end of the continuum, organic\ncultures have a network of control and authority, lateral com-\nmunication paths, and employees who receive information\nand advice in a cooperative manner rather than instructions\nfrom supervisors.\nKimbrough and Componation (2009) used an instrument,\nOrganizational Culture Assessment (OCA; Reigle, 2001,\n2003), which was based on the mechanistic/organic continuum\nof Burns and Stalker (1961), to study how the organizational\nculture framework is related to ERM implementation. In a\nstudy of 116 firms from 21 different industries, the authors\nfound that organizations with higher organic scores were more\nlikely to have a risk management program, were more likely to\nstate that culture aided in the speed and effectiveness of ERM\nimplementation, and were more satisfied overall with the effec-\ntiveness of the firm's ERM program. Firms with higher OCA\nscores (organic culture) were more likely to answer \"yes\" to the\nquestion of whether the firm's culture has been modified to\nsupport ERM. This finding is not surprising given that organic\nfirms are more open to change and innovation. The study did\nnot find that culture was related to the presence of a CRO, but\nfor the firms that did have a CRO, the firms with organic cul-\ntures were more likely to have a formal risk management pro-\ncess and to be further along in the ERM implementation.\nSimilarly, Kleffner, Lee, and McGannon (2003) found that a\nhindrance to ERM adoption was a silo mentality at firms due to\nthe firms' organizational structure, which could be interpreted\nas a characteristic of a mechanistic culture.\nKey implications for boards. Akey \"takeaway\" from our analysis\nof ERM research to address our final question of interest (How\ndoes organizational culture affect the value of ERM?) is that\norganizational culture has a significant impact on the decision\nto implement ERM and on the effectiveness of that implemen-\ntation. Some have argued that \"culture is king\" when it comes\nto ERM. Without sufficient support of ERM by the CEO or\nboard of directors, organizations may struggle in their efforts to\nfind strategic value in their ERM processes. Thus, boards may\nneed to consider the organization's culture as it evaluates the\neffectiveness of management's risk management processes.\nOpportunities for future research. Because research about the\nrole of culture in the context of ERM is limited, additional\nstudies are warranted to answer the question as to how orga-\nnizational culture influences an ERM implementation.\nResearch about elements of culture that affect the overall\neffectiveness of ERM is needed to help boards and senior\nexecutives in their efforts to implement risk oversight pro-\ncesses that help them navigate risks that may be on the hori-\nzon. We summarize in column C of Appendix B a number of\npotential research questions related to the role of culture in\nERM that governance scholars may want to examine.\nConclusion\nERM is emerging corporate governance topic, particularly for\nboards of directors as they respond to increasing expectations\nfor more effective risk governance. ERM has become a major\nfocus of many organizations because of legislation and regula-\ntions, as well as recent corporate failures. While the academic\nresearch related to ERM is emerging, it is still in its early\nstages. Despite that, we believe that there are a number of key\ninsights from research conducted to date that boards may ben-\nefit from considering. We have highlighted a number of those\nin this article and in Table 1. We also believe that there are\nmany other potential research questions that warrant rigorous\nacademic study by governance scholars. In this article, we\nhave identified a number of research questions in Appendices\nA and B related to the two primary ERM-related responsibili-\nties of the board of directors.\nIn some ways, the academic world's embrace of ERM has\nlagged the business world. There is tremendous opportunity\nfor researchers to contribute insights that would be highly\nrelevant to business leaders, and this study attempts to pro-\nvide motivation to encourage scholars to continue their\nexamination of a number of issues that can inform key gov-\nernance players, including the board of directors and audit\ncommittee, in their risk governance efforts.\nResearch is needed along multiple dimensions of\nERM, and expertise bridging a number of academic fields\nis needed. Because ERM is intended to oversee risks aris-\ning across the enterprise, academic experts in a variety of\nbusiness disciplines (i.e., accounting, finance, informa-\ntion technology [IT], marketing, strategy, and organiza-\ntional behavior), in addition to experts in disciplines\nbeyond business (i.e., economics, sociology, psychology,\nindustrial engineering, computer science, statistics, and\ndata analytics) have significant opportunities to contrib-\nute to our understanding of ERM. More importantly,\nresearch that integrates academic analysis of business\nand non-business disciplines can provide unique insights\nabout what works well and what does not in managing the\nvolume of complex risks facing enterprises. Because\norganizations will always face risks in the pursuit of\nvalue, organizations will constantly be seeking insights\nabout more effective techniques to proactively manage\nthe risks that may emerge. The academic community is\nuniquely positioned to assist with providing rigorous\nanalyses that will provide insight into the effectiveness of\nERM processes. The landscape of research questions\nrelated to ERM is open and diverse. The academic com-\nmunity needs to take advantage of this significant\nopportunity.\nAppendix A\nSummary of Research Opportunities to Address Board's Understanding and Approval of ERM Processes.\nColumn A Column B Column C\nResearch opportunities to address, \"What\ntypes of organizations implement ERM?\"\nResearch opportunities to address, \"What techniques comprise an ERM\nprocess?\"\nResearch opportunities to address, \"What is the\nrole of IA in ERM?\"\nTo what extent do prior risk events\naffecting the firm affect the decision to\nadopt ERM?\nHow are regulators affecting an entity's\ndecision to implement ERM, and\nhow might regulations explain ERM\nadoptions in different industries?\nWhat role does the board of directors\nplay in encouraging ERM adoption?\nHow do differences in ownership\nstructures, including shares held by\ndirectors, senior management, and\ninstitutional investors, affect ERM\nadoption?\nHow does the embrace of ERM by\ncompetitors explain a firm's adoption\nof ERM?\nTo what extent does the life cycle of\nan industry or firm explain the need\nfor ERM?\nHow does the level of diversification of\nan entity affect its decision to embrace\nWhat additional measures are available\nto proxy for ERM implementation?\nHow does executive compensation\naffect a firm's decision to embrace ERM?\nTo what extent are ERM\nimplementations affected by the types of\nexecutives responsible for leading risk\noversight in the organization?\nWhat attributes affect the embrace of a particular ERM\nconceptual framework, and why are frameworks important to\nERM champions in an organization?\nHow might existing theories in the academic literature be used\nto strengthen ERM frameworks, and how might ERM frameworks\nbe used to inform the development of new theoretical arguments\nfor ERM?\nHow do organizations organize ERM processes across complex,\nglobal enterprises?\nHow are organizations aggregating risks to create an enterprise-\nwide portfolio of risks?\nWhat techniques are organizations using to help leaders of\nspecific business functions recognize how their efforts to reduce\nrisks in their function actually may create risks for other functions\nin the enterprise?\nWhat techniques are entities using to engage executives in\nprocesses to prioritize risks?\nWhat processes are organizations using to assess the existence\nand adequacy of responses to top risks to the organization?\nHow are organizations assigning ownership to executives for each\nof the top risk exposures identified by the ERM process?\nHow might executive compensation create incentives for\nexcessive risk taking that is beyond the entity's appetite for risk?\nHow are organizations considering interrelationships (i.e.,\ncorrelations) among individual top-tier risks identified by the ERM\nprocess?\nHow are organizations developing KRIs to monitor changing risk\nconditions?\nHow are organizations communicating top risks to the board of\ndirectors?\nWhat are the typical ERM processes\nperformed by IA, and what tasks are they\nnot performing?\nHow do varying levels of involvement by IA\nin ERM processes affect perceptions of IA's\nobjectivity and independence?\nWhat techniques are boards of directors\nand audit committees using to monitor\nwhether IA is compromising its objectivity\nby performing ERM functions?\nHow do perceptions of ERM's value\ndiffer when ERM is led by IA vs. by other\nexecutives in the firm?\nTo what extent are IA functions being asked\nto perform objective assessments of the\norganization's ERM processes?\nHow is the output of ERM affecting the\nnature and extent of IA's audit work for the\nenterprise?\nBecause ERM is focused heavily on emerging\nrisks related to strategy, to what extent is IA\nable to respond to strategic risks?\nTo what extent are IA functions adjusting\ntheir staffing to include individuals with\nexperience beyond traditional IA roles that\nfocus on financial reporting or operational\nand compliance issues?\nHow are the results of IA involvement in\nERM processes affecting external auditor\nassessments of and reliance on IA in financial\nstatement and internal control audits?\nNote. ERM = enterprise risk management; KRI = key risk indicator; IA = internal audit.\nAuthors' Note\nThis article is partly derived from the first author's dissertation at\nKennesaw State University.\n"
