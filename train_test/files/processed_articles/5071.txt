The Lewis score (LS) and the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index\n(CECDAI) are validated endoscopic indices for quantification of small-bowel inflammation on\nCE. It is unclear whether these indexes are interchangeable for the evaluation of mucosal\ninflammation in established Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare the\nquantitative evaluation of small- bowel inflammation by LS and CECDAI.\nMethods: Patients with known quiescent small-bowel CD for at least 3 months (Crohn's\ndisease activity index < 150) were prospectively recruited and underwent CE. The LS was\ncalculated using RAPID 8 capsule-reading software and the CECDAI was calculated manually.\nCumulative LS (C-LS) was calculated by summation of individual tertile LS. Fecal calprotectin\n(FCP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured and correlated with the scores.\nResults: A total of 50 patients were included in the study. There was a moderate correlation\nbetween the worst segment LS and CECDAI (Pearson's r = 0.66, p = 0.001), and a strong\nto mucosal healing (LS < 135), while CECDAI > 9.2 corresponded to moderate-to-severe\ninflammation (LS  790). There was a moderate correlation between capsule scores and FCP\nCECDAI, respectively). CRP levels were not significantly correlated with either score.\nConclusions: CECDAI and C-LS are strongly correlated and perform similarly for quantitative\nassessment of mucosal inflammation in established CD.\n",

The Lewis score (LS)8 trun-\ncates the small bowel into three tertiles (by small\nbowel transit time) and assigns points to patho-\nlogical findings (i.e. mucosal edema, ulcers, and\nstrictures) characteristic for CD. Both severity\nand extent impact the scoring of the findings. The\nLS is incorporated in the RAPID reading soft-\nware for the PillCam SB capsule (Medtronic,\nDublin, Ireland). A score < 135 indicates normal\nor clinically insignificant mucosal inflammatory\nand a score  790 indicates moderate-to-severe\ninflammation. The LS was recently validated for\nmonitoring established CD.9,10 An additional\nscore known as the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's\nDisease Activity Index (CECDAI) is utilized for\nthe scoring of small- bowel inflammation on\nCE.11 This score divides the small bowel into two\nsegments and includes degree and extent of\nmucosal inflammation and presence of stric-\ntures.10 In a previous study that included a mixed\ncohort of patients evaluated for suspected CD, a\nstrong correlation between the indices (r = 0.68)\nwas demonstrated; the correlation of LS with\nfecal calprotectin (FCP) was somewhat stronger\nthan that of CECDAI.12 However, the correlation\nof both indices in the follow up of established\nCD, as well as the correlation with inflammatory\nbiomarkers in this setting, has not been previously\nevaluated.\nTherefore, the aim of the current study was to\nevaluate the correlation between LS and\nCECDAI, and the correlation of both indices\nwith inflammatory biomarkers for the evaluation\nof established CD.\nMethods\nPatient population\nThe current study was a retrospective analysis of\nprospectively collected data, as part of a larger\nproject aimed to identify predictors of clinical\nrelapse in patients with quiescent CD.6 The study\npopulation included adult (> 18 years) patients\nwith CD with established small-bowel disease in\nclinical remission or mild disease (Crohn's dis-\nease activity index < 250) that were in corticos-\nteroid-free remission for 3\u00ad24 months and treated\nwith a stable medication dose (60 days for thiopu-\nrines and methotrexate and infliximab, 30 days\nfor adalimumab and 5-aminosalicylic acid\nagents). All patients signed an informed consent\nand the study was approved by the institutional\nethics review board.\nCE studies\nIn patients with isolated small-bowel CD, an\nSB-III capsule (Medtronic) was ingested. In\npatients with established ileocolonic CD, a colonic\ncapsule (PillCam 2 colonic capsule, Medtronic)\nwas used. A patency capsule (PC) test was admin-\nistered to all patients with active small-bowel dis-\nease detected on MRE. If a PC was not eliminated\nfrom the small bowel within 30 h, the patient was\nwithdrawn from the study. All images were\nreviewed using the RAPID 8 software (Given\nImaging, Dublin, Ireland). Mucosal inflammation\nwas quantified using the LS.8 When a colonic cap-\nsule was used, the small-bowel data were reviewed\nand analyzed manually using the LS protocol,\nwhile for the SB III capsule it was calculated using\nthe built-in calculator in the Rapid 8 software.8\nMucosal healing was defined as LS < 135, mild-\nmoderate-to-severe inflammation as LS > 790.8\nIn addition to the traditional LS (derived from the\nscore achieved by the most involved tertile), we\ncalculated the cumulative LS (C-LS) by summa-\ntion of the individual tertile scores. Proximal small\nbowel was defined as the first or second tertiles in\naccordance with small bowel transit times.\nCECDAI was calculated manually using the pre-\nviously published algorithm11 by a different\nreviewer blinded to the LS results.\nInflammatory biomarkers\nFCP levels were measured using the Quantum\nblue calprotectin kit (B\u00dcHLMANN Laboratories\nAG, Basel, Switzerland).

Categorical\nvariables were analyzed by chi square test/Fisher's\nexact test and continuous variables by the Student's\nt test/Mann\u00adWhitney U test as appropriate.

Both scores have been available for\nover 10 years, however it was not clear whether\none is superior to the other. Both LS and CECDAI\nincorporate similar parameters (i.e. mucosal\nappearance, ulcerations, and strictures) and\naddress both the severity and extent of the find-\nings.8,14 While LS is derived from the most\nseverely involved segment of the small bowel (of\nthe three tertiles divided by small bowel transit\ntime), CECDAI is a cumulative score that repre-\nsents the summation of segmental scores for the\nproximal and distal small bowel. Not surprisingly\ntherefore, when LS is calculated as a cumulative\nscore (C-LS) that summarizes the tertile scores,\nthe correlation between the two substantially\nimproved.\nFCP is an accurate surrogate of the mucosal\ninflammatory burden in inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD). In the recent meta-analysis of 19\nstudies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity\nof FCP for detection of active inflammation\nAlthough it is currently unclear whether the\naccuracy of FCP is similar in the small\nbowel and the colon, the accuracy of FCP for\ndetection of small-bowel inflammation as dem-\nonstrated by CE is well established, with a nega-\ntive predictive value of > 90%.16 The correlation\nof both the LS and CECDAI with FCP is mod-\nerate, as previously reported.12 However, the\ncorrelation is improved when LS is calculated as\na cumulative score; this is not surprising as a\ncumulative score is more likely to represent the\ninflammatory burden in the entire small bowel\nand not just a given segment.\nMucosal healing is a major therapeutic goal in\nCD, and is associated with a higher rate of long-\nterm remission and lower risk of complica-\ntions.17 However, clinical trials in CD still\naddress mucosal healing by accessing the\ninflammation in the colon and the terminal\nileum. In at least 50% of patients with CD there\nis proximal small-bowel involvement that can be\nvisualized only by CE,2,18 while the degree of\ninflammation in one segment may entirely mis-\nrepresent the other.19 To date, very few studies\nassessed the efficacy of medical treatment\nin CD for healing the mucosa of the small\nbowel;20\u00ad22 clearly, if CE is to become a stand-\nard tool for evaluation of mucosal healing in CD\ntrials, there needs to be a consensus regarding\nthe method for quantification of the inflamma-\ntion. While CECDAI was designed specifically\nfor diagnosis and monitoring of CD, no cut-off\nvalues for this score were established; on the\nother hand, LS was recently validated for moni-\ntoring of the small bowel in CD with the original\ncut-off values of < 135 for mucosal healing.\nThe main current advantage of LS is that it is\nFigure 1.

This is the main advantage of\nLS, however it appears that both can be used\ninterchangeably. The C-LS may potentially be\nsomewhat more reflective of the small-bowel\ninflammatory burden than the traditional LS,\nhowever it should be validated in further studies.\nRecently, a new small bowel colon capsule has\nbeen introduced in Europe, that is, the PillCam\nCrohn's (Medtronic). This capsule will allow for\ncomplete pan-enteric evaluation of the digestive\ntract with a single diagnostic modality.23 This\ncapsule is a potentially ideal tool for repeated\nmonitoring in CD, in both clinical practice and in\nfuture clinical trials. The software bundled with\nthis capsule will incorporate both the LS and the\nnovel quantification system for both small-bowel\nand colonic inflammation.\nIn summary, our study demonstrates that both\nLS and CECDAI are equally suitable for quanti-\ntative monitoring of small-bowel inflammation in\n"
