The avoidable fraction multiplied by the expected number of BRHIs gives an estimate\nof the number of preventable cases. Direct and indirect health costs are estimated from a social\nperspective for the number of preventable BRHIs to assess potential cost savings that would be achieved\nif all riders wore helmets.\nThese preventable injuries and deaths represent an estimated $81 million in direct and $2.3 billion in\nindirect health costs. Estimates range from 200 preventable BRHIs and $3 million in health costs in\nCalifornia (population 32.3 million).\nConclusions: A number of successful approaches to increasing bicycle helmet use exist, including\nmandatory use laws and community based programs. The limited use of these strategies may be related\nto the fact that too little information is available to state agencies about the public health and economic\nburden of these preventable injuries. In conjunction with information on program costs, our estimates\ncan assist state planners in better quantifying the number of preventable BRHIs and the costs and ben-\nefits of helmet promotion programs.\nEach year in the US, nearly 700 persons die from bicycle\ndepartments.2 About two thirds of these fatalities and one\nthird of these injuries are related to a head injury.3 4 Although\nbicycle helmets substantially reduce the risk such injuries,5\u00ad7\nthe majority of bicyclists do not always wear helmets.8 9\nOne reason for the limited use of successful strategies to\nincreasing bicycle helmet use10 may be related to the dearth of\ninformation at the state level about the public health burden\nand associated health costs of these preventable injuries. This\ninformation could demonstrate to decision makers that\npromoting helmet use could be a cost saving investment.\nAccordingly, we report national and state specific estimates of\npreventable bicycle related head injuries (BRHIs) and the asso-\nciated health costs for 1997. We also discuss methodological\nissues and data gaps encountered in developing these estimates.\nMETHODS\nWe use four steps in the estimation process (fig 1). State level\npopulation estimates are multiplied by the corresponding\nnational death,hospitalization,and emergency department visit\nrates to generate the expected number of cases. The proportion\nof cases that could be prevented--the avoidable fraction--is\nestimated by combining information on helmet effectiveness\nand prevalence of use. The avoidable fraction is multiplied by\nthe expected number of injuries to estimate the number of\navoidable cases of fatal and non-fatal injuries. We then estimate\nthe direct health costs of medical treatment and the indirect\nhealth costs due to losses in productivity from premature death\nand permanent disability for the avoidable cases.\nBecause of a lack of information on state specific BRHI\nincidence,11 state level incidence estimates are obtained by\napplying national rates to state population data. Associated\nstate level health cost estimates are developed from both state\nand national data.12\nAn incidence based, cost-of-injury approach is used to esti-\nmate the \"lifetime\" economic burden of BRHIs, including all\ndirect costs for medical care and the indirect costs related to\nlost productivity due to disability or premature death\nassociated with the injury.\nAll incidence and cost estimates are for 1997. These are\ncharacterized by their presentation as: fatalities, non-fatal\nhospitalized cases, and non-hospitalized emergency depart-\nment cases.\nEstimating the expected number of cases\nWe used National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) multiple\ncause of death files from 1993\u00ad95 to estimate the incidence of\nfatal BRHIs13 by selecting deaths with bicycle related external\ncause of death and associated N codes suggestive of head\ninjury.3 4 The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 N and E\nwith a fourth digit of 0.1. Because NCHS data are too sparse\nwhen subdivided by state, age, and gender, we pooled the three\nyears of national level data to produce stable age and\ngender-specific rates that were applied to 1997 state population\nfigures.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: AIS, abbreviated injury scale; BRHI, bicycle related\nhead injuries; HCUP, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project; NCHS,\nNational Center for Health Statistics; NEISS, National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System\nSee end of article for\nauthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Jane Schulman, Battelle\nMemorial Institute, Centers\nfor Public Health Research\nschulman@battelle.org\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThe national incidence of non-fatal hospitalized BRHIs is\nestimated using the 1994 Healthcare Cost and Utilization\nProject (HCUP) database,14 which consists of uniform hospital\ndischarge records from 17 states. To identify BRHIs, 15\ndiagnosis fields were searched for the same ICD-9 N codes and\nE codes used to identify fatalities. All records with a BRHI\nnoted in any of the 15 diagnosis fields are included. To ensure\nunbiased incidence estimates, we only include nine states\nwith at least 80% of their head injury records E coded. In\nand approximately 3.3 million hospital discharge records were\neliminated. Because the HCUP database is designed to support\nnational level estimates and survey weights are provided for\nthis purpose, weighting adjustments were made to compen-\nsate for the loss of cases in non-E code states.\nsion's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)\nwas used to estimate the national rate of emergency\ndepartment visits.15 We identified bicycle related injuries using\nthe product code field, and head injury using the body part\nfield (which notes the most severely injured part). Head injury\nincluded injury to the eye, ear, face, and head because these\ninjuries are preventable with bicycle helmets.6 16\nEstimating the avoidable fraction and the number of\navoidable cases\nAge specific avoidable fractions were assumed constant for\nfatalities, non-fatal hospitalizations, and non-hospitalized\nemergency department visits, and estimated as17:\nwhere p is the proportion of riders who do not use helmets and\nRR is the relative risk of BRHI for those who do not use\nhelmets compared with those who do.\nThe proportion of riders who use helmets in a particular age\ngroup (l-p) is assumed to be 31.8% for those less than 10 years\nor gender.6\nIn each state, the number of avoidable cases for each age\nand gender group is obtained by applying the age specific\navoidable fractions to the age and gender specific expected\nnumbers of BRHI.\nEstimating the direct health costs for the avoidable\ncases\nThe direct health costs associated with the avoidable cases are\nestimated separately for fatalities, non-fatal hospitalized\ncases, and emergency department visits. Included are the costs\nof health care services used in acute and rehabilitative phases\nof treatment: inpatient hospital services, services of health\nprofessionals, those provided in emergency departments and\noutpatient clinics, and physical and vocational rehabilitation.\nWe do not include costs for outpatient pharmaceuticals, long\nterm care, home health care, medical supplies and devices, and\npatients' time costs in accessing these services. Because the\ndistributions of costs are right skewed, the geometric mean for\neach cost category is estimated.\nFatalities\nMedical expenses for fatally injured persons vary by the\nlength of time between injury and death. Three situations are\nconsidered: (1) those who die at the scene of the crash or in\nFigure 1 Estimation process (ED = emergency department).\nA.

The HCUP\ndatabase is used to estimate total hospital charges per\ndischarge at the national level. Costs per discharge are\nestimated from charges using 1994 state level, case weighted\naverage operating cost-to-charge ratios for urban and rural\nhospitals.19 As the cause of a head injury should have little\nbearing on whether the record is E coded, discharge records\nfrom all 17 states in the HCUP database are used to improve\nthe precision of the estimates. Physician fees are estimated as\n39% of the costs of the index admission.20 State specific\nestimates of hospital costs and physician fees are derived\nusing state-to-national ratios for hospital costs per admission\nTable 1 Estimating the number of avoidable fatal and non-fatal cases of BRHI in\n1997 and the associated direct and indirect health costs\nUnited States\nNo of avoidable cases\nTotal health costs\n($, in thousands)\nFatalities\nHospitalized\ncases\nED cases\nDirect\nIndirect\nED, emergency department.\nState estimates of the costs of non-universal use of bicycle helmets 49\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nand physician practice costs.21 22 Emergency department costs\nfor persons who died after admission to the hospital are esti-\nmated, as are the costs for those who died in the emergency\ndepartment, using encounter data from the state of Missouri.\nTo estimate costs for each type of fatality, we assumed that\napproximately 50% of the deaths occurred at the scene of the\ninjury or in transit, 30% occurred in the emergency\ndepartment, and 20% after hospital admission.23\nNon-fatal hospitalized cases\nThe direct health costs for non-fatal hospitalized avoidable\ncases are assumed to include: (1) emergency department\ncosts; (2) hospital costs and physician fees for the initial\nadmission and inpatient rehabilitation; (3) outpatient reha-\nbilitation; and (4) costs for subsequent hospitalizations.\nAs for fatalities, estimates of the average emergency\ndepartment costs for non-fatal hospitalized cases are devel-\noped from emergency department encounter records from\nMissouri, and national average inpatient costs are estimated\nby applying cost-to-charge ratios to the charges included in\nthe HCUP data. The remaining components for non-fatal hos-\npitalized avoidable cases are estimated as a per cent of the\ncosts of the index admission: 39.0% for professional fees; 4.7%\nfor subsequent hospitalizations; 3.4% for inpatient rehabilita-\ntion; and 2.7% for outpatient rehabilitation.20\nEmergency department cases\nAs discussed above, the average emergency department costs\nfor BRHIs treated and released from the emergency depart-\nment is the same as for patients who died or who were admit-\nted to the hospital following an emergency department\nencounter.\nEstimating the indirect costs for the avoidable cases\nTo estimate productivity losses at the state level, we modified\nthe human capital approach for prevention effectiveness.24 For\neach state, age and gender specific estimates of indirect costs\nwere estimated using state level data on average wages,\nemployment, and labor force participation by age and gender.\nThe individual age-gender estimates were summed to obtain\nthe overall state estimate. Because not all of these data\nelements are available by race, we could not make state\nspecific, age and gender estimates by race. Annual productive\nvalue is estimated as the sum of annual earnings, including\nfringe benefits and annual imputed value of housekeeping\nservices. Economic valuation for lost leisure time and pain and\nsuffering are not included because methods for quantifying\nthese outcomes in monetary terms are not well developed.\nSimilarly, productivity losses for partial disability are not\nincluded. With death or permanent total disability, annual\nlosses are accrued over the remaining years of a person's\nexpected lifetime and discounted to present values at a 3%\ndiscount rate.25 For children and adolescents who are not yet in\nthe labor force, the value of future lost work time is estimated\nin terms of projected lifetime earnings using the annual wages\nand salaries of current workers and an estimated annual\nincrease in non-farm labor productivity of 1.7%.\nEstimates for adults are based on rates of \"failure to return\nto work\" observed in follow up studies of workers who\nsuffered severe head injuries.26\u00ad30 Because injury severity is an\nimportant predictor of time to return to work and the\nproportion of injured persons who never return to work, the\nseverity of injury for each discharge record in HCUP was\nquantified using the abbreviated injury scale (AIS).31 The age\nand AIS specific distribution of cases from HCUP was\nmultiplied by the AIS specific estimates of failure to return to\nwork from the literature to estimate the severity adjusted age\nspecific per cent of cases who fail to return to work. The rates\nof failure to return to work observed in the studies of adults\nare assumed to occur among children once they reached\nworking age. We assume that if an individual did not return to\nwork after two years, he or she is likely to remain permanently\nunemployed due to disability.\nSensitivity analysis\nWe explored the effects of modifying key parameters\nincluding: (1) estimating the incidence of non-fatal hospital-\nized cases using HCUP principal diagnosis versus any diagno-\nsis of BRHI; (2) estimating the incidence of hospitalized inju-\nries using NEISS data versus HCUP; (3) varying the relative\nrisk; (4) varying the discount rate to estimate the expected\nlifetime productivity losses for fatalities and for non-fatal\nhospitalized cases; (5) using data from Seattle, Washington, to\nestimate emergency department rates versus the NEISS 15; and\n(6) varying assumptions about the per cent of non-fatal hos-\npitalized cases who either go, or return, to work after a BRHI.\nRESULTS\nThis study estimated that, in the US, approximately 327 fatal,\nbeen avoided in 1997 with universal use of bicycle helmets\n(table 1).

Our estimates do not include economic\nvaluation for lost leisure time, pain, and suffering. Human\ncapital estimates are smaller than injury cost estimates that\ntake these aspects of injury into account.32\nBeing comprehensive in estimating the costs and benefits of\ninjury is essential for analyses conducted from the social per-\nspective when economic comparisons are needed among a\nnumber of diverse injury prevention interventions, for exam-\nple, bicycle helmets, smoke detectors, and seat belts.25 It is our\nview that analyses conducted from a governmental perspec-\ntive are also useful for planners.\nNumerous methodological issues and data gaps face anyone\nattempting to generate analogous state level estimates for\nother injury prevention interventions (fig 1):\nNeed for state level estimates (steps 1\u00ad4)\nBecause of the lack of state level data systems, estimates for\nhelmet use prevalence, incidence, and costs were generated\nusing national data. Geographic variation in BRHI incidence is\nlikely, however, because of variability in the prevalence of hel-\nmet use and in bicycle riding patterns related to weather.\nTemporal effects (steps 1B, 1C, 4)\nWithout periodic updating, estimates quickly become out-\ndated. For example, a change in the use of the intervention\nover time affects not only estimates of prevalence of use, but\nalso estimates of expected injury incidence rates, and severity\nand disability distributions. Similarly, many of the data\nneeded to develop the components of direct and indirect\nhealth costs vary over time, for example, medical care costs,\nwages, and the proportion of the population employed.\nBecause specific types or causes of injuries are relatively rare\n(for example, BRHIs), pooling several years of data may be\nnecessary to achieve stable estimates, but this may mask time\ntrends.\nNeed for age and gender specific estimates (steps 1, 4)\nIncidence rates, direct and indirect health costs, prevalence of\nuse of the intervention, and effectiveness of the intervention\nmay vary by age and gender. Similarly, control efforts often\ntarget particular segments of the population.\nUnavailable data (steps 1C, 4)\nMany data needed are not readily available from state or\nnational sources. For example, although large numbers of\nnon-fatally injured persons are initially treated in outpatient\ndepartments, physicians' offices, and other ambulatory care\nsettings, encounter data from these settings do not generally\ninclude E codes to identify the external cause of injury. Simi-\nlarly, several treatment cost categories, including paramedic\nand emergency transport costs and costs for long term care,\nare not available. It is often impossible to distinguish subsets\nof persons whose risk for injury varies. For example, early\nadopters of an intervention may have a different level of risk\nof injury than do late adopters, and the costs may be different\nas well, because early adopters tend to have less severe\ninjuries. It is often necessary to extrapolate from highly\nselected series of patients that are not representative of the\nsituation for which an estimate is needed. We used studies of\nreturn-to-work in severely injured adults to estimate the like-\nlihood that a child would be permanently disabled.\nNon-comparability of existing data sources (steps 1, 4)\nObtaining comparable figures is a challenge because existing\ndata sources use different case definitions, measures of sever-\nity, referent years, and age groupings.\nMultiple injuries (step 4A)\nDecisions must be made about how to apportion costs for a\nBRHI if a person has multiple injuries and conditions.\nDefining the intervention (step 1B)\nThere are distinctions between the intervention and the\nsystem of intervention delivery and between the efficacy\n(ideal circumstance) and the effectiveness (real world results)\nof both. We define the intervention as a bicycle helmet that is\nworn; a law mandating its use would be a delivery system.\nEither could be modeled, assuming that the post-intervention\nprevalence of the risk factor can be defined.\nValuation of time for groups for whom there are no\ndirectly comparable labor market experiences, that is,\nthe elderly, children, and those unable to work (step\nFor a cost-of-injury assessment of a health and safety\nintervention, the appropriate measures of the opportunity cost\nof time are the wage rates of the individuals for whom the\nintervention is targeted. Implementing this approach presents\nproblems for groups for whom there are no wage data. Practi-\ncal alternatives and further research into methods for valuing\nthe time of these groups are needed.\nWhile we are making estimates of the incidence and economic\nburden of BRHIs for the US and the individual states, the\nproblem is well documented internationally.33 34 We highlight\nthese methodological issues because we believe that the\ndebate in injury, and disease prevention, needs to shift from\ntotal burden to preventable burden. Using this model we hope\nto generate state level estimates of the numbers of preventable\nhospitalized and non-hospitalized cases and deaths for other\ntypes of injuries, along with the associated direct and indirect\nKey points\n\u00b7 Too little information is available to state agencies about the\npublic health and economic burden of preventable bicycle\nrelated head injuries (BRHIs).\n\u00b7 We estimated that, in the US, approximately 327 fatal,\ncases of BRHI could have been avoided in 1997 with uni-\nversal use of bicycle helmets. These preventable cases are\nassociated with more than $81 million in direct and $2.3\nbillion in indirect health costs.\n\u00b7 Even using the most conservative assumptions, 56 000\nBRHIs could have been prevented in the US, for a total\nhealth cost saving of $1.3 billion.\n\u00b7 Estimates range from 200 preventable BRHIs and $3\nin California (population 32.3million).\n\u00b7 In conjunction with information on program costs, these\nestimates can assist state planners in better quantifying the\nnumber of preventable BRHIs and the costs and benefits of\nhelmet promotion programs.\n\u00b7 Numerous methodological issues and data gaps face any-\none attempting to generate analogous state level estimates\nfor other injury prevention interventions.\n\u00b7 We believe that the debate in injury, and disease preven-\ntion, needs to shift from total burden to preventable burden.\nState estimates of the costs of non-universal use of bicycle helmets 51\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nhealth costs from the failure to use available injury control\ninterventions.
