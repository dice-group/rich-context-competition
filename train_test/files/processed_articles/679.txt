Of-\nten, individuals are able to overcome such difficulties\nthrough the use of assistive devices (see, e.g., Hartke,\nProhaska, & Furner, 1998; Manton, Corder, & Stal-\nmany instances, however, disabled elderly persons\nneed help from others (i.e., personal assistance) to per-\nform ADLs (Norburn et al., 1995). If the need for as-\nsistance goes unmet, older adults may be at risk for a\nvariety of adverse outcomes, including increased\nhealth services utilization and depression (Allen &\nMor, 1997) as well as institutionalization (Chenier,\nestimates of need and unmet need for ADL personal\nassistance may serve as an indicator of future need\nfor long-term care services (Tennstedt et al., 1994).\nTo help reduce the burden of unmet need and to\nfacilitate the development and targeting of in-home\nand community-based services, it is important that\nwe determine the prevalence and correlates of unmet\nneed for personal assistance with ADLs. To date,\nhowever, few population-based studies have sought\nto address this issue. Analyzing data from the 1984\nNational Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), Manton\n(1989) found that, among community-dwelling older\nadults with chronic disability, the prevalence of un-\nmet need for ADL assistance ranged from 1.4% (eat-\ning) to 27.9% (toileting). Overall, more than a third\nand older reported an unmet need for assistance with\none or more ADLs. Prevalence of unmet need was\nstrongly associated with increasing age and level of\ndisability.\nUsing different definitions of disability, need, and\nunmet need, Allen and Mor (1997) conducted a tele-\nphone survey of disabled adults in Springfield, Mas-\nsachusetts, and found that the prevalence of unmet\nneed for assistance with ADLs ranged from 4.3% (eat-\nolder. Unmet need was significantly more likely among\npersons with two or fewer reliable helpers and among\nthose who were more severely impaired. The authors\nalso found that a substantial proportion of elderly\npersons with unmet needs experienced serious, nega-\ntive consequences as a result of receiving inadequate\npersonal assistance. In another study of disabled el-\nderly persons (aged 70 years and older) in Massachu-\nsetts, Tennstedt and colleagues (1994) reported that\nless than 10% of respondents had an unmet need for\nassistance with personal care ADLs and that the like-\nlihood of unmet need was significantly associated\nwith level of disability.\nFrom a national policy and planning perspective,\nthese previous findings are somewhat limited insofar\nThe Second Supplement on Aging to the 1994 National Health Inter-\nview Survey was developed and funded primarily by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics and the National Institute on Aging, with additional\nsupport from the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning\nand Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The field\nwork was conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.\nDr. Desai is currently with the Yale University School of Medicine, De-\npartment of Epidemiology and Public Health, New Haven, CT.\nAddress correspondence to Julie Dawson Weeks, PhD, National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\njweeks@cdc.gov\n1National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Hyattsville, MD.\nas they are based on older data or on data from a lim-\nited geographic region. In contrast, in the present\nstudy we used recent data from a nationally represen-\ntative sample of older adults to address the following\nobjectives: (a) to derive estimates of need and unmet\nneed for ADL personal assistance; (b) to identify cor-\nrelates of unmet need; and (c) building on the work\nof Allen and Mor (1997), to examine the prevalence\nand correlates of negative consequences of unmet\nneed for ADL assistance.\nMethods\nData Source and Analytic Sample\nData for these analyses come from the Second\nSupplement on Aging (SOA II) to the 1994 National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in col-\nlaboration with the National Institute on Aging. Cov-\nering a broad range of health topics, the NHIS is a\nhousehold survey that is administered annually to a\nmultistage probability sample of the civilian, nonin-\nstitutionalized population of the United States (Mas-\nsey, Moore, Parsons, & Tadros, 1989). Approximately\nhold members aged 70 years and older were recon-\ntacted, and 9,447 of these individuals completed the\nSOA II (NCHS, 1998). Reflecting the U.S. population\nTrained interviewers from the U.S. Bureau of the\nCensus collected SOA II data through face-to-face,\nin-home interviews. Assisted and proxy interviews\n(6% and 11%, respectively) were allowed for elderly\npersons who were unable to participate on their own\nbecause of illness or impairment. Data were col-\nlected on various aspects of health and well-being in\nlater life, such as sociodemographic characteristics,\nliving arrangements, and measures of physical health\nand functioning, including ADLs.\nThe SOA II interview included a series of ques-\ntions about seven ADLs: (a) bathing or showering; (b)\ndressing; (c) eating; (d) getting in and out of bed or\nchairs (i.e., transferring); (e) walking; (f) getting out-\nside; and (g) using the toilet, including getting to the\ntoilet (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963).\nFor each ADL, respondents were first asked whether\nor not, because of a health or physical problem, they\nhad any difficulty performing the activity (by them-\nselves and without using special equipment). For the\npurposes of this study, we defined disability as diffi-\nculty performing ADLs. The prevalence of ADL dis-\nability ranged from 2.5% (eating) to 23.9% (walking).\nOverall, nearly 30% of all persons aged 70 and older\nreported difficulty performing one or more ADLs. Ex-\ncluding individuals who reported no difficulty per-\nforming ADLs (see Figure 1), we focused the analyses\nof this study on older adults with ADL disabilities.\nPersonal Assistance With ADLs\nAfter asking respondents whether they had diffi-\nculty performing individual ADLs, interviewers asked\nstudy participants whether or not they received assis-\ntance from another person when performing a given\nactivity, and whether or not they needed (or needed\nmore) personal assistance. Personal assistance was de-\nfined as either hands-on help or supervisory/standby\nhelp. On the basis of the answers to these questions,\nwe categorized disabled respondents as having no\nneed, met need, or unmet need for personal assis-\ntance with ADLs (see Figure 1). As Figure 1 illustrates,\nindividuals were categorized as having no need for\npersonal assistance with a given ADL if they reported\nhaving difficulty performing the activity, but not re-\nceiving and not needing personal assistance. Respon-\ndents were categorized as having a met need if they\nreported having difficulty and receiving personal as-\nsistance, but not needing more assistance. Those who\nreported having difficulty and needing more personal\nassistance than they were receiving, if any, were cat-\negorized as having an unmet need.\nNegative Consequences of Unmet Need\nFor four of the seven ADLs, the SOA II interviewers\nasked respondents whether or not they had experi-\nenced (during the past month) any negative conse-\nquences as a result of inadequate personal assistance.\nFor example, respondents who reported experiencing\neither (a) discomfort because they were not able to\nbathe as often as they would have liked or (b) a burn\nor scald caused by bathing with water that was too\nhot were regarded as having experienced a negative\nconsequence of unmet need for personal assistance\nwith bathing/showering. Similar sorts of questions\nwere asked for dressing, eating, and toileting (see Ta-\nRespondents who reported difficulty walking were\nasked how often they moved around their house/\napartment. Multiple-choice answers ranged from\n\"whenever [I] want\" to \"not often enough even to use\nthe bathroom.\" Those who reported mobility restric-\ntion (i.e., something other than \"whenever [I] want\")\nwere categorized as having had a negative conse-\nquence of unmet need for personal assistance with\nwalking. In the SOA II interview, questions regarding\nnegative consequences of unmet need were not\nasked for the remaining two ADLs, that is, transfer-\nring and getting outside.\nFigure 1. Determination of personal assistance need status for activ-\nities of daily living.\n84  \nPotential Correlates\nSociodemographic characteristics, number of chronic\nconditions, and level of ADL disability were consid-\nered as potential correlates of unmet need and nega-\ntive consequences of unmet need for personal assis-\ntance with ADLs. Specifically, we included the\nfollowing sociodemographic variables in the analy-\n(White, Black, or other), education (12 or 12\nalone).\nRespondents reported whether or not they had\never had (a) a broken hip; (b) osteoporosis; (c) diabe-\ntes; (d) arthritis; (e) chronic bronchitis or emphysema;\n(f) asthma; (g) hypertension; (h) heart disease (includ-\ning coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or\nmyocardial infarction); (i) any other heart disease; (j)\na stroke or cerebrovascular accident; or (k) cancer.\nWe calculated a summary score and categorized re-\nspondents as having had zero to one, two to three, or\nfour or more chronic conditions. Level of ADL dis-\nability was defined according to the number of ADLs\nan individual had difficulty performing (one to two,\nthree to four, or five to seven ADLs). Because assisted\nand proxy interviews were allowed in SOA II data\ncollection, our analyses also included a variable for\nrespondent status (self, assisted, or proxy).\nData Analysis\nAmong persons with ADL difficulties, we deter-\nmined the overall distribution of need (i.e., no need,\nmet need, or unmet need) for personal assistance\nwith ADLs. Then, focusing on those individuals who\nreported need (either met need or unmet need) for as-\nsistance, we reexamined level of unmet need. Next,\nwe determined the proportion of individuals who\nhad experienced a negative consequence as a result\nof their unmet need. Finally, chi-squared and logistic\nregression analyses (Agresti, 1990) were performed to\nidentify correlates of both unmet need and negative\nconsequences of unmet need for personal assistance\nwith one or more ADLs. The multivariate analysis em-\nployed a backward elimination strategy (Kleinbaum,\nvals (CIs) were calculated. We performed all analyses\nusing SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996) to\ntake into account the survey's complex sample de-\nsign; this allowed for appropriate variance estimation\nand weighting of the data.\nTable 1.

Among those\nwho had difficulty performing individual ADLs, the\nprevalence of unmet need for assistance ranged from\n6.2% for eating to 11.7% for bathing/showering. Con-\nsidering only persons with need (either met need or\nunmet need) for assistance, estimates of unmet need\nring. Overall, 48.7% of older adults with ADL diffi-\nculties (or an estimated 3 million persons aged 70\nand older) reported needing some sort of personal as-\nsistance with one or more ADLs, and, of those indi-\npersons) had an unmet need. Nearly half (47.6%) of\nrespondents with an unmet need for ADL personal\nassistance reported experiencing a negative conse-\nquence as a result of their unmet need.\nCorrelates of unmet need for ADL personal assis-\ntance are presented in Table 3. Prevalence of unmet\nneed did not significantly vary by age, race, or num-\nber of chronic conditions. After adjusting for other\nsample characteristics, neither sex nor education was\nindependently associated with unmet need. In multi-\nvariate analysis, respondents whose annual house-\nhold income was less than $20,000, who lived alone,\nand who had difficulty performing an increasing num-\nber of ADLs were at increased risk of having an un-\nmet need for personal assistance. In addition, partici-\npants with a proxy respondent were less likely to\nhave unmet needs.\nTable 4 presents correlates of negative conse-\nquences of unmet need for ADL personal assistance.\nThe likelihood of experiencing negative consequences\nof unmet need was significantly associated with lower\nincome and increasing level of ADL disability. None\nof the other sociodemographic and health status vari-\nables considered were associated with negative con-\nsequences.\nTable 3.

Overall, fully one fifth of those\nneeding help reported receiving inadequate assis-\ntance, half of whom had recently experienced a neg-\native consequence as a result of their unmet need.\nLow-income elderly persons and those with multiple\nADL difficulties were at increased risk for both hav-\ning an unmet need and experiencing a negative con-\nsequence as a result. Those who lived alone were\nmore than twice as likely to have unmet needs,\nthough no more likely to report negative conse-\nquences.\nIt is difficult to compare estimates of unmet need\nfor ADL assistance across studies, because of consid-\nerable differences in study methods; sample charac-\nteristics; and definitions of disability, need, and un-\nmet need. Whether we use all persons reporting\ndifficulty performing a given ADL or only those need-\ning assistance as the denominator, our estimates of\nunmet need differ from those previously reported\n1994). For most ADLs, we found higher rates of un-\nmet need for assistance than either Manton (1989) or\nTennstedt and colleagues (1994). This may be ex-\nplained, at least in part, by our more comprehensive\ndefinition of unmet need: Whereas the two earlier\nstudies asked only respondents receiving no help at\nall whether or not they needed help, we additionally\nasked those receiving some help whether or not they\nneeded more help (similar to Allen & Mor, 1997).\nMoreover, the relatively low rates of unmet need re-\nported by Tennstedt and colleagues (1994) may re-\nflect the fact that their analysis focused on a select\nsubsample of study participants who were still alive\nand community-dwelling 2 years following baseline\ninterview. The higher rates of unmet need reported\nby Allen and Mor (1997) may, in part, be attributed\nto their assessment of need in the past month (1-\nTable 4.

The positive association between severity\nof disability and prevalence of unmet need for assis-\ntance likely reflects the fact that elderly persons with\nmore ADL difficulties require more personal care,\nthereby increasing the likelihood that caregivers will\nnot be able to satisfy all needs. The importance of the\nobserved association between level of ADL disability\nand prevalence of unmet need is underscored by\nfindings that increased disability and caregiver bur-\nden often precipitate the transition from community\nliving to institutionalization (Chenier, 1997).\nIn this study, we also found that disabled elderly\npersons whose annual household income was less than\n$20,000 were more likely to report receiving inade-\nquate personal assistance with ADLs. Although Tenn-\nstedt and colleagues (1994) did not find an associa-\ntion between income and unmet need, Allen and\nMor (1997) reported that the number of routine ex-\npenses one could not afford (a proxy for income) was\npositively associated with the number of unmet ADL\nin a study of cancer outpatients (Siegel, Raveis,\nHouts, & Mor, 1991), unmet needs were significantly\nmore likely among those eligible for Medicaid or\npublic assistance. In these data, we did not find an\nassociation between insurance status and unmet\nneed. More than 95% of the sample had Medicare; in\naddition, 21% had Medicaid and 64% had private in-\nsurance. Prevalence of unmet need for personal as-\nsistance with one or more ADLs did not differ ac-\ncording to presence or absence of Medicaid (21.2%\nvs. 20.6%, respectively, p  .84) or presence or ab-\ntively, p  .23). These data suggest that elderly per-\nsons living in lower income households are less\nlikely to be able to pay for formal care when the level\nof informal caregiving is insufficient. There is longitu-\ndinal evidence that increased access to formal in-home\nservices may contribute to continued community liv-\ning among disabled elderly persons (Tennstedt, Craw-\nOlder adults with multiple ADL difficulties and\nlimited financial resources were at increased risk for\nnot only having unmet needs but also experiencing\nnegative consequences of unmet needs. It is of great\nconcern that nearly half of those with unmet needs\nexperienced one or more negative consequences, be-\ncause many of the negative consequences (such as\nnot being able to eat when hungry and experiencing\na burn or scald when bathing) had the potential to se-\nriously threaten the health and safety of those with\nunmet needs.\nOur finding that older adults who lived alone were\ntwice as likely as those who lived with others to re-\nport an unmet need for personal assistance is con-\nsistent with an extensive body of literature on in-\nstrumental social support (e.g., Langford, Bowsher,\nMaloney, & Lillis, 1997) and informal caregiving\n(e.g., Robinson, 1997). As expected, in the majority\nof cases, a disabled respondent's spouse or child was\nthe primary caregiver. A more detailed analysis of\nhousehold composition, marital status, and availabil-\nity of children supported the findings of Chappell\n(1991) and Tennstedt, Crawford, and McKinlay\n(1993a) that coresidence is often more important\nthan kinship tie per se in determining patterns of in-\nformal care and use of formal services. The fact that\nthose who live alone are especially vulnerable to\nhaving unmet needs is important in light of the fact\nthat, over time, an increasing proportion of the old-\nest-old, particularly women, are living alone (U.S.\nWe also found that participants with a proxy re-\nspondent were less likely to have unmet needs. Al-\nthough we believe this likely reflects the fact that\nthose with an available proxy are more likely to need\nand, indeed, receive personal assistance with ADLs,\nthe association may stem from proxies' greater un-\nwillingness to report unmet need, fearing that doing\nso would negatively reflect on their own caregiving\nadequacy. To the extent that the latter is true, unmet\nneed for ADL personal assistance would be underes-\ntimated. Notably, the same correlates of unmet need\nand negative consequences of unmet need were\nfound when we restricted the sample to self-respon-\ndents only.\nAlthough the majority of older adults who have\ndifficulty performing basic ADLs have either no need\nor met need for personal assistance, a substantial pro-\nportion of disabled elderly persons continue to have\nunmet needs and experience negative consequences\nas a result. Most of the assistance that a community-\ndwelling elderly person receives is provided infor-\nmally by family caregivers; in some instances, this\ncare is supplemented by formal services. Because in-\ndividuals whose needs for assistance go unmet may\nbe at risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, it is im-\nportant that the likelihood of having unmet needs be\nminimized. Greater, targeted efforts are needed to\nidentify at-risk older persons living in the community\nand to provide services (e.g., home care, community-\nbased services, assistive devices, and residential mod-\nifications) that may reduce the burden of unmet\nneed. In the present study, we identified broad socio-\ndemographic and health status factors associated\nwith unmet need and negative consequences of un-\nmet need for ADL personal assistance. Further studies\nare needed to identify and overcome specific barriers\nto receiving help and services (e.g., inability to pay\nand lack of accessibility or availability in one's area).\nFuture work should consider the effectiveness of tar-\ngeting potentially vulnerable populations, such as\nolder adults living in low-income housing or poor ru-\nral communities.\nFollow-up data are currently being collected on\nSOA II respondents. In future studies, we will be able\nto examine the longitudinal effects of having unmet\n88  \nneeds for ADL personal assistance in terms of out-\ncomes such as functional decline, medical visits,\nhospitalizations, institutionalization, and mortality.\nReferences\nAgresti, A.
