Macrophages\nare tissue-resident white blood cells that regulate and\nactively participate in inflammation.4 These cells typi-\ncally express high levels of proteases and peptidases,5,6 in\nline with their function in phagocytosis and extracellular\nmatrix degradation.7 One example is aminopeptidase-N\nple functions in macrophages including antigen trim-\nming, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and signal\ntransduction.8,9 IRAP and AP-N are structurally closely\nrelated and share to some extent common substrate speci-\nficity.10,11 IRAP has a broad pH and substrate range, with\na preference for (but not limited to) Cys-rich peptides\nsuch as vasopressin, oxytocin and somatostatin.12 It also\nhelps in the generation of antigenic peptides from exog-\nenous antigens for cross-presentation on major histocom-\npatibility complex (MHC) class I in DCs.3 But what sets\nIRAP apart from the other members of the M1 amin-\nopeptidase family, is its extended cytoplasmic domain\nPresence and regulation of\ninsulin-regulated aminopeptidase\nin mouse macrophages\nAlexandros Nikolaou1\u00ad3, Benoit Stijlemans2,3, Damya Laoui2,3,\nElio Schouppe2,3, Huyen TT Tran2,3, Dirk Tourw\u00e94, Siew Y Chai5,\nPatrick ML Vanderheyden1,* and Jo A Van Ginderachter2,3,*\n Keywords\nAngiotensin IV, IVDE77, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, macrophage, M1\n1Molecular and Biochemical Pharmacology,Vrije Universiteit Brussel,\nBelgium\n2Myeloid Cell Immunology Laboratory, VIB, Belgium\n3Cellular and Molecular Immunology Unit, Vrije Universiteit Brussel,\nBelgium\n4Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium\n5Department of Physiology, Monash University, Australia\n*Shared senior authorship.\nCorresponding author:\nPatrick Vanderheyden, Molecular and Biochemical Pharmacology, Vrije\nUniversiteit Brussel, Building E, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.\nEmail: pvandhey@vub.ac.be\nOriginal Article\n(109 aa).13 This N-terminal domain contains two di-\nleucine trafficking motifs (preceded by acidic residues),\nwhich are responsible for the correct localization of IRAP\nand its complex intracellular trafficking.14,15 In this\nrespect, IRAP is mainly located perinuclearly in special-\nized secretory endosomes under basal conditions.2,16,17\nThese endosomes can be quickly recruited to the cell sur-\nface by activating cell type-specific receptors, such as the\nFcR activation in mast cells,2 the oxytocin receptors in\nvascular endothelial cells18 or insulin receptors in adipo-\ncytes.19,20 At present, no receptor is known to trigger\nIRAP recruitment in macrophages.\nThe hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) is a natural\ninhibitor of IRAP.21,22 Ang IV is extensively studied for its\nmemory-facilitating properties in mice and rats, however\nits mechanism of action remains unresolved.23 Ang IV is\nalso reported to protect against ischemic stroke,24,25 hyper-\ngroups, including ours, therefore continue to develop syn-\nthetic Ang IV-analogues with enhanced stability and affin-\nity for IRAP.17,29 Of particular interest, Ang IV binding to\nIRAP is described to activate the nuclear factor B pathway\n(NF-B) in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. This in\nturn results in an increased production of pro-inflammatory\nfactors such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor\nIn the present study we investigated the occurrence and\nsubcellular distribution of IRAP in mouse macrophages, as\nwell as the regulation of its expression by pro-inflammatory\nmediators. We explored the function of IRAP in glucose\nuptake and phagocytosis, and because of the central role of\nthe NF-B pathway in the induction of inflammation in\nmacrophages,32 we investigated the activity of Ang IV and\nAng IV-analogues on the expression of NF-B regulated\ngenes in macrophages.\nMethods\nMaterials\nAng IV (Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) was obtained from\nPolyPeptide Group (Strasbourg, France). AL-11 (2hVal-\nTyr-Ile-His-Pro-3hPhe) and IVDE77 (2hVal-Tyr-Ile-Aia-\nNva-Phe) were prepared as described before.33,34 Ang IV,\nAL-11 and IVDE77 were used at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M,\nunless specified otherwise. The specific activity of tritiated\nRecombinant mouse interferon- (IFN-) (BD Biosciences,\nErembodegem, Belgium) was used at 100 U/ml.\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) was obtained from Sigma\n(Bornem, Belgium) and used at 1 ng/ml. IL-4 (100 U/ml),\nIL-10 (100 U/ml) and transforming growth factor  (TGF-\n) (5 ng/ml) were obtained from Peprotech (London, UK).\nAll other reagents were of the highest grade commercially\navailable.\nMice\nIRAPwild-type (wt) and knock-out (IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad) C57BL/6 mice\nthat were generated by Ozgene (Ozgene Ptd Ltd, Australia)\nas described before were bred at the animal house of the\nVrije Universiteit Brussel.35 Macrophage mannose receptor\ndeficient (MMR\u00ad/\u00ad) mice were provided by Etienne Pays\n(Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles). Signal transducers and acti-\nvators of transcription deficient (STAT1\u00ad/\u00ad) mice were pro-\nvided by Chantal Mathieu (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,\nBelgium). Interferon regulatory factor deficient (IRF1\u00ad/\u00ad)\nmice were a gift of Peter Brouckaert (Universiteit Gent,\nBelgium). All experiments were approved by the Ethics\nCommittee at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium,\nand met the standards required by the Belgian Council for\nLaboratory Animal Science (BCLAS) guidelines.\nPreparation and in vitro stimulation of\nmacrophage populations\nMurine na\u00efve peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) or thioglycol-\nlate-elicited (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) peritoneal\nmacrophages (thioPEMs) were obtained by rinsing the peri-\ntoneum of na\u00efve or thioglycollate-inoculated (four days prior\nto cell collection) mice with PBS/10% sucrose.After 3 h cul-\nmg/ml streptomycin, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 1 mM nonessen-\ntial amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.02 mM\n2-mercaptoethanol) in 24-well plates, non-adherent cells\nwere washed away and the adherent peritoneal macrophages\nwere used for analysis. To generate bone marrow-derived\nmacrophages (BMDMs), bone marrow cells were cultured\nfor 10 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)\nmedium as a source of Macrophage-Colony Stimulating\nFactor (M-CSF). These macrophage types were seeded at 106\ncells/ml in ME-medium and subjected to stimulation by pro-\ninflammatory M1-inducing mediators (IFN-, LPS), anti-\ninflammatory M2-inducing cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-),\nIRAP-ligands (Ang IV, AL-11, IVDE77), or combinations\nthereof during 24 h unless stated otherwise.\nWestern blot\nTotal protein cell extracts were prepared as described ear-\nNuPAGE\u00ae Novex Tris-Acetate Gel (Life Technologies,\nMerelbeke, Belgium) and transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra\nnitrocellulosemembrane(GEHealthcare,Diegem,Belgium).\nAfter 1 h blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk, membranes\nwere incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with IRAP (D7C5) XP\u00ae\nrabbit monoclonal antibodies (Biok\u00e9, Leiden, The\nNetherlands) or with mouse monoclonal to -actin (Abcam,\nCambridge, UK).After washing, membranes were incubated\n468 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nfor 1 h with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody.\nExpression was measured by electrochemiluminescence\n(ECL) in a ChemidocTM XRS+ system (Bio-Rad, California,\nUSA) and the signal was quantified using Image Lab 3.0.\nRadioligand binding\nGeneral principles were described before.37 Briefly, experi-\nments were carried out with [3H]IVDE77 at a final concen-\ntration ranging between 1\u00ad20 nM for saturation binding\nand 10 nM for all other experiments. Non-specific binding\nwas determined in the presence of 10 \u00b5M of unlabelled\nAL-11. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD\n) and\nmaximal number of binding sites (Bmax\n) were calculated by\nnonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 5.0\n(GraphPad Software).\nThe distribution of intracellular versus cell surface IRAP\nin macrophages was investigated by the acid wash method\nas described earlier.38 In brief, after 40 min incubation of\nthioPEMs with 10 nM [3H]IVDE77, which is not cell-\npermeable and hence only binds to IRAP at the cell surface,\nthe unbound ligand was washed away. The cells were then\ntreated with glycine buffer (pH 3.0) to disrupt and collect\nthe cell surface bound [3H]IVDE77, corresponding to the\nfraction of IRAP at the cell surface. The remaining acid\nresistant binding thus represents the internalized [3H]\nIVDE77/IRAP complexes.\nRNA extraction and quantitative real-time\n(RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nanalysis\nTotal RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT\nPCR were performed as reported earlier.40 Primer sequences\nare listed in Table 1. Gene expression was always normal-\nized using ribosomal protein S12 as housekeeping gene.\nPhagocytosis assay\nIRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and wt thioPEMs were seeded in a 96-well plate\nYellow-green fluorescent latex microspheres (Polysciences,\nEppelheim, Germany) were then added (diluted 1:5000) and\nthree times with PBS before fluorescence of the phagocy-\ntosed particles was measured at an excitation wavelength of\nspectrophotometer (Tecan Group Ltd., Mechelen, Belgium).\nFlow cytometry\nThioPEMs from wt, IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and MMR\u00ad/\u00ad mice were cul-\ntured for 24 h either with or without IL-4 (100 U/ml). Cells\nwere then incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, scraped and brought\nto concentration (106 cells/ml) in Hank's Balanced Salt\nSolution (HBSS) supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum\nand 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Anti-\nFcR antibody (2.4G2, BD Biosciences) was added to the\n(MR5D3, Serotec) or the corresponding PE-conjugated iso-\ntype control (R35-95, BD Pharmingen). Dead cells were\nexcluded via 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD\nBiosciences). Data were acquired on a FACS Canto II (BD\nBiosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star).\nDQ-ovalbumin (DQ-OVA, Molecular Probes) process-\ning was performed as described before.41 Briefly, IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad\nand wt thioPEMs were allowed to internalize and process\nDQ-OVA for 15 min at 4\u00b0C (control) or at 37\u00b0C. Free\nDQ-OVA was subsequently washed away and thioPEMs\nwere allowed to process internalized DQ-OVA further for\nchilled, blocked with anti-FcR antibody and stained with\ncence was measured via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter\nCytokine quantification\nSecreted TNF levels from IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and wt thioPEMs cul-\ntures were quantified using sandwich ELISA following\nmanufacturer's instructions (DY410, R&D Systems).\nGlucose uptake assay\nIRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and wt thioPEMs were seeded in 24-well plates\nand used either unstimulated or stimulated for 24 h with\nTable 1.

Cells were washed three\ntimes with PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in\nbuffer alone or with 20 \u00b5M cytochalasin B (Sigma,\nBornem, Belgium) to block glucose transport39. 2-deoxy-\nD-[3H]glucose (Perkin Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium) was\nthen added at a final concentration of 1 mM (correspond-\ning to 1 \u00b5Ci/ml) and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C.\nUptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose was stopped by wash-\ning the cells three times with PBS on ice. Cells were then\nlysed with 1 M NaOH and the accumulated 2-deoxy-D-\n[3H]glucose was measured after adding 3 ml of scintilla-\ntion liquid (Optiphase Hisafe) using a -counter\n(Perkin-Elmer, Zaventem, Belgium). Data refer to spe-\ncific 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose uptake, calculated by sub-\ntracting non-specific uptake in the presence of 20 M\ncytochalasin B.\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed at least three times with\ntriplicate determinations each, unless stated otherwise.\nRadioligand saturation curves were obtained by analyzing\nthe data according to a one-site model using GraphPad\nPrism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Statistics were\nperformed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and\nwhen p<0.005, Dunnett's post-hoc test was performed to\ncompare each condition with the control. *p<0.05;\nResults\nDifferent mouse macrophage types express\nsimilar IRAP protein levels\nThe IRAP protein levels in different mouse macrophage\ntypes (na\u00efve PEMs, thioPEMs and BMDMs) were investi-\ngated by Western blotting. IRAP protein expression was\ncomparable among all the macrophages tested and was\nabsent in IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad macrophages, validating the IRAP-\nspecificity of the tested antibody (Figure 1). Notably, IRAP\nprotein levels in macrophages were twofold lower than\nthose in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which are known\nIRAP is mainly located intracellularly in\nresting macrophages\nTo investigate the presence of IRAP at the cell surface of\nlive macrophages, saturation binding experiments were\nperformed in vitro with theAng IV-analogue [3H]IVDE77.17\nSpecific binding of [3H]IVDE77 to wt thioPEMs was\nclearly detectable, and the binding parameters were deter-\nmined by non-linear regression (KD\nBmax\n2(a)). ThioPEMs derived from IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad mice showed no\nspecific binding, confirming that the measured radioactiv-\nity solely resulted from [3H]IVDE77 binding to IRAP.\nNext we investigated the distribution of intracellular\nversus cell surface IRAP in wt macrophages by the acid\nwash method.38 Under basal conditions, only 15% of [3H]\nIVDE77/IRAP complexes were located at the cell surface\nof thioPEMs, while the remaining bound [3H]IVDE77 was\ndetected intracellularly (Figure 2(b)). These results indicate\nthat the translocation of IRAP in macrophages is a dynamic\nprocess, in accordance with earlier observations in Chinese\nhamster ovary cells.37\nIRAP is higher expressed in M1-activated\nmacrophages\nMacrophages are very modular cells that are especially\nresponsive to their environment.32,45,46 We therefore charac-\nterized the expression and regulation of IRAP in mac-\nrophages, to determine in which macrophage activation\nstate (pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2)\nIRAP may be more prominent.\nCompared to the control condition, expression of IRAP\nmRNA rose almost threefold after 24 h stimulation with\nFigure 1. Different mouse macrophage types express\nsimilar insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) protein levels.\nIRAP protein content was compared between mouse na\u00efve\nperitoneal macrophages (PEMs) (lane 1), thioglycollate-elicited\nperitoneal macrophages (thioPEMs) (lane 2) and bone marrow-\nderived macrophages (BMDMs) (lane 3).

Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is mainly located intracellularly in resting macrophages. (a) Saturation binding\nto wild-type (wt) and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (thioPEMs) was carried out with [3H]IVDE77 at a final\nconcentration ranging between 1\u00ad20 nM. Data refer to specific binding (expressed as pmol/106 cells), calculated by subtracting non-\nspecific binding in the presence of 10 M AL-11 from total binding.A representative of two independent experiments is illustrated.\n(b) The distribution of intracellular versus cell surface IRAP was investigated by the acid wash method. Glycine buffer treatment (pH\n3.0) disrupted only the cell membrane bound [3H]IVDE77, corresponding to the fraction of IRAP on the cell surface.The remaining\nacid resistant binding represents the internalized [3H]IVDE77/IRAP complexes.Values are expressed as % binding compared to their\ncorresponding untreated control condition.\nwith IFN- and LPS caused effects similar to LPS alone\nIRAP is recruited to the cell surface during\nphagocytosis\nRecombinant soluble IRAP was reported to augment the\nphagocytic uptake of latex beads by IFN-/LPS-stimulated\nwhether latex beads could recruit IRAP to the cell surface,\nand whether IRAP-deficiency would decrease phagocyto-\nsis in thioPEMs. Incubating wt thioPEMs for 2 h with latex\nbeads significantly increased subsequent [3H]IVDE77\ning the cells with latex beads for 24 h or 48 h did not show\nincreased IRAP surface expression, indicating that IRAP\nrecruitment to the cell surface was transient.\nTo assess the role of IRAP recruitment in phagocytosis,\nthe fluorescence of ingested latex beads was measured at\ndifferent time points in wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thioPEMs. Basal\nuptake increased gradually over time, in a similar fashion in\nboth wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thioPEMs (Figure 7(b)). Phagocytic\nuptake was more pronounced after treatment with IFN-/\nLPS, but no significant difference between wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad\nthioPEMs was observed. Pre-treating wt thioPEMs for 1 h\nwith 1 \u00b5M IVDE77 to block the enzymatic activity for\nIRAP also did not influence phagocytosis of latex beads\n(Figure 7(c)).\nIRAP-deficiency does not alter macrophage\nmannose receptor (MMR)-mediated\nendocytosis in macrophages\nBesides phagocytosis of large particles, macrophages\nalso ingest molecules via receptor-mediated endocyto-\nsis. In this context, MMR-mediated endocytosis is of\nparticular interest, since IRAP has been reported to co-\nlocalize with MMR.3,48 Therefore, we first assessed\nwhether IRAP-deficiency could influence the distribu-\ntion of MMR. No difference in MMR-positive cells was\nobserved by flow cytometry between IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and wt\nthioPEMs (Figure 8(a)). IL-4 stimulation also increased\nMMR expression similarly in both groups. Additionally,\nwe tested whether MMR-deficiency would alter the dis-\ntribution of IRAP. No difference in [3H]IVDE77 bind-\ning to IRAP was observed between wt and\nMMR\u00ad/\u00ad thioPEMs (Bmax,wt\npmol/106 cells) (Figure 8(b)). These data indicate that\nalthough IRAP and MMR may co-localize, their distri-\nbution is regulated independently of each other in\nmacrophages.\nOVA uptake by macrophages is MMR-dependent.49\nHence, to test whether IRAP influences MMR functional-\nity, the kinetics of DQ-OVA uptake and degradation by wt\nversus IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad macrophages was assessed using flow\ncytometry. However, no differences between both mac-\nrophage types could be observed (Figure 9).\nIRAP-deficiency does not influence glucose\nuptake in macrophages\nIn fat and muscle cells, IRAP is co-localized with the glu-\ncose transporter GLUT4 and is as such involved in insulin-\nmediated glucose uptake.13,50 In addition, GLUT4 might\ncontribute to meeting the enhanced energy needs of acti-\nWe therefore investigated whether IRAP plays a role in\nthe glucose uptake of macrophages. No difference was\nobserved in the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose between\nwt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thioPEMs under basal conditions (Figure\n10(a)). Glucose uptake strongly increased (approximately\n50% higher compared to control) in both wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad\nthioPEMs after 24 h activation with IFN- or LPS (Figure\n10(b)). These data indicate that IRAP may not be impli-\ncated in glucose uptake by macrophages, both under basal\nand inflammatory conditions.\nFigure 4.Interferon- (IFN-)-mediated insulin-regulated\naminopeptidase (IRAP) mRNA expression is signal transducers\nand activators of transcription (STAT1)-dependent, but\ninterferon regulatory factor ( IRF1)-independent.

However, AL-11 did not significantly influence the\nsecretion of TNF by LPS-stimulated macrophages, illus-\ntrating that IRAP binding does not have a major impact on\nthe inflammatory status of these cells (Figure 12(c)).\nDiscussion\nFor the first time, the presence and regulation of IRAP was\ninvestigated in mouse macrophages. Total IRAP protein\nexpression was comparable between na\u00efve PEMs, thi-\noPEMs and BMDMs (Figure 1). These data are in line with\nthe IRAP protein levels reported in dendritic cells, which\nare similar between dendritic cell subtypes.3,54 The pres-\nence of IRAP at the cell surface of macrophages was shown\nby specific binding of the Ang IV-analogue [3H]IVDE77.\nNo binding was observed in IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad macrophages, indicat-\ning that no alternative binding sites nor specific uptake\nmechanisms of [3H]IVDE77 take place.

We observed that IFN- induced a threefold\nupregulation of IRAP mRNA expression, which was\nmediated by the transcription factor STAT1 but not by IRF1\n(Figures 3 and 4). This translated into a corresponding\nhigher IRAP protein content and [3H]IVDE77 binding in\nthioPEMs (Figures 5 and 6). These IFN- mediated effects\nare very similar to the data of Gabrilovac and coworkers,8\nwhich showed that IFN- induces a twofold increase in\nAP-N mRNA and surface expression in the macrophage\nLPS-treatment also increased IRAP mRNA and protein\nexpression in thioPEMs. Minimally modified low-density\nlipoprotein (mmLDL), which as LPS binds to Toll-like\nreceptor 4,55 was reported to increase IRAP-expression in\nfoam cells under high glucose and insulin conditions.56\nTogether with our observation that anti-inflammatory\ncytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-) did not induce IRAP-\nexpression, these data demonstrate that IRAP is more\nexpressed in pro-inflammatory M1-activated macrophages,\nand suggest it may play a role in cytotoxic or inflammation-\nassociated functions.\nA surprising pattern in [3H]IVDE77 binding was\nobserved in LPS-treated thioPEMs. While a relatively short\npre-incubation of 2 h with LPS augmented [3H]IVDE77\nbinding, it subsequently declined after longer time periods\n(24 h and 48 h) (Figure 6). A possible explanation for the\nrapid increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding is that LPS-treatment\nmight induce recruitment of IRAP-vesicles to the cell sur-\nface of macrophages. Trafficking of IRAP-vesicles is\nknown to be triggered by different stimuli and is cell type-\ndependent.3 For example, IRAP is quickly recruited to the\ncell surface of mast cells upon FcR-activation with\nopsonized antigen,2 or by oxytocin binding to its receptor in\nhuman vascular endothelial cells.18 In this context, we also\nobserved a transient increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding to thi-\noPEMs after incubation with latex particles (Figure 7).\nFurther work is clearly required to identify the stimuli and\nthe involved signaling pathways responsible for IRAP-\ntrafficking in macrophages.\nIncreasing evidence points towards the importance of\nIRAP in an immunological context. For instance, IRAP is\nreported to be crucial for N-terminal trimming of exogenous\nantigens that are directed for cross-presentation on MHC-I\nin dendritic cells.48,54 Also, addition of recombinant IRAP in\nthe culture medium augments phagocytosis of latex beads in\nIFN-/LPS stimulated RAW264-macrophages.47 While we\nobserved that fluorescent latex beads transiently recruited\nIRAP to the cell surface, phagocytosis of these fluorescent\nbeads was however similar between wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thi-\noPEMs, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of IRAP is\nnot required for the ingestion of particles. Given that the\nN-terminal cytosolic tail of IRAP interacts with several pro-\nteins implicated in protein sorting, vesicle formation and\ncytoskeleton remodeling, we speculate that recruitment of\nIRAP-containing vesicles may function as a shuttle, deliver-\ning important yet undefined proteins at the cell surface to\nFigure 7.

No dif-\nference was also observed in the MMR-mediated uptake\nand processing of DQ-OVA between IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad and wt thi-\noPEMs (Figure 9).\nMacrophages involved in an immune response demon-\nstrate an increased glucose demand to meet the energy\nneeds for activation.62,63 In this context, uptake of glu-\ncose represents the rate-limiting step.64,65 Hence, a rise in\ntranslocation of glucose transporters (including GLUT4)\nwas reported in human monocytes after activation by\ninvestigated whether IRAP-deficiency would disturb glu-\ncose uptake in macrophages. However, no difference in\nglucose uptake was observed between wt and IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thi-\noPEMs, either under resting, IFN- or LPS-activated\nconditions (Figure 10). IRAP may thus not be implicated\nin glucose uptake, as supported by the observation that\nglucose uptake increased by about 50% after 24 h LPS\ntreatment, while no increase in [3H]IVDE77 binding was\nseen under the same conditions. These data do not exclude\nthe contribution of GLUT4 in glucose uptake during\ninflammation, nor the existence of potential compensa-\ntion mechanisms upregulating other glucose transporters\nin IRAP\u00ad/\u00ad thioPEMs.\nA number of papers report activation of signaling path-\nways upon binding of Ang IV to IRAP, implying a recep-\ntor function for IRAP.26,66\u00ad69 Of note, Ang IV activates the\nFigure 10.

Secreted TNF\nlevels were however unaffected by Ang IV or AL-11. In\nthe current debate of IRAP functioning as a receptor,70\nthese data tend towards Ang IV as an anti-inflammatory\nmediator.\nAltogether, it is clear that IRAP plays different roles\ndepending on the cell type and extracellular environment.\nIn the case of macrophages, the role of (Ang IV binding\nto) IRAP has just started to be unraveled. We showed\nhere that IRAP is higher expressed in pro-inflammatory\nM1-activated macrophages, and that its presence at the\ncell surface varies upon exposure to IFN-, LPS or exog-\nenous particles. A further understanding of the regulation\nand translocation of IRAP in macrophages by use of syn-\nthetic Ang IV-analogues will contribute substantially to\nelucidating the function(s) of IRAP in an immunological\ncontext.\nFigure 12.
