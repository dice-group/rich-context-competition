Bearman and Douglas S. Massey)\nIndividuals with higher educational attainment live healthier and\nlonger lives. However, not everyone benefits equally from higher\neducation. In particular, the black\u00adwhite gap in life expectancy is\ngreater at higher levels of educational attainment. Furthermore,\nrecent research suggests that disadvantaged African Americans in\nthe rural Southeast who attend college have worse physical health\nthan their similarly disadvantaged peers who do not attend college.\nThe extent to which this pattern generalizes to a nationally repre-\nsentative, mixed-race sample is unknown. Using data from the Na-\ntional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we test\nwhether the health benefits associated with college completion\nvary by level of childhood disadvantage for depression and meta-\nbolic syndrome in young adulthood, across race/ethnicity. We find\nuniform lower depression associated with college completion re-\ngardless of childhood disadvantage, and across non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Hispanic young adults. College completion\nis associated with lower metabolic syndrome for whites across all\nlevels of childhood disadvantage. In contrast, college completion is\nassociated with higher metabolic syndrome among black and His-\npanic young adults from disadvantaged childhood environments.\nOur findings suggest that, for minorities from disadvantaged back-\ngrounds, finishing college pays substantial dividends for mental\nhealth but simultaneously exacts costs with regard to physical\nhealth. This pattern contrasts starkly with whites and minorities\nfrom more privileged backgrounds, for whom college completion\nis associated with benefits to both mental and physical health.\nThese results suggest that racial disparities in health may persist\nin part because the health of upwardly mobile minorities is compro-\nmised in young adulthood.\nsocial mobility | health disparities | race and ethnic disparities |\nyoung adulthood\nIncome and wealth inequality in the United States is high and has\nbeen growing since the 1970s, with an increasing concentration\nof fortunes in the top of the distribution (1\u00ad4). Upward inter-\ngenerational income mobility has become less likely over this\nperiod (5). While access to education has expanded, increasing\npopulation levels of college attainment have been met with a si-\nmultaneous intensification of differentiation within categories of\neducational attainment according to the quality of the educational\ndegree (6). Alongside the rise in income inequality, increases in\nincome segregation mean that the affluent are increasingly isolated\nin affluent communities, concentrating high-quality public goods,\nincluding schools, in restricted geographic locations (7). Income\nsegregation combined with racial segregation results in black and\nHispanic individuals living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods\nand attending lower-quality schools than whites with the same\nlevel of income and assets (8\u00ad10). Furthermore, there is evidence\nthat the returns to housing and educational investments are lower\nfor blacks and Hispanics than they are for whites (11, 12).\nThis context of inequality has been reflected in socioeconomic\ngradients in health. The socioeconomic gradient in health and\nmortality in the United States is large, persistent, and increasing\nover time (13\u00ad16). While greater levels of socioeconomic re-\nsources broadly defined are associated with better health, educa-\ntion demonstrates the most consistently robust association (17).\nMore-educated individuals live healthier and longer lives; indi-\nviduals with a college degree can expect to outlive their less-\neducated counterparts by about a decade (18).\nHowever, higher socioeconomic status (SES) is not equally\nbeneficial for all individuals; within SES categories, non-Hispanic\nwhites enjoy better health outcomes than non-Hispanic blacks,\nand this gap is wider at higher levels of SES (19, 20). Weathering is\na conceptual framework that has been proposed to explain this\npattern (21). Minorities face greater exposure to stressors, in-\ncluding discrimination and institutionalized racism, that requires\nsustained coping (22\u00ad25). Another conceptual framework relevant\nto these patterns is John Henryism, which suggests that individual\ncharacteristics such as self-control, grit, and perseverance promote\npsychosocial well-being and achievement but can be physiologi-\ncally taxing because they result in sustained activation of the stress-\nresponse system (26\u00ad28). This results in biological wear and tear,\naccelerated aging, and accumulated risk, also referred to as allo-\nstatic load (29, 30). Such stress-related deterioration is manifested\nin physiological risk across biological systems (29). Alongside this\nincreasing emphasis on the importance of accumulated stressors\nSignificance\nCollege graduates enjoy healthier, longer lives compared with\nindividuals who do not graduate from college. However, the\nhealth benefit of educational attainment is not as great for\nblacks as it is for whites. Moreover, college completion may not\nerase the detrimental effects of early-life disadvantage for\nblacks and Hispanics. We use nationally representative data on\nyoung adults to test whether American minorities experience\ndifferential returns to educational attainment. We find that\ncollege completion predicts lower rates of depression for all\nracial groups. It also predicts lower metabolic syndrome among\nwhites. However, college completion predicts higher metabolic\nsyndrome among black and Hispanic adults from disadvan-\ntaged backgrounds, suggesting upward mobility may come at\na health cost to young minorities in America.\nAuthor contributions: L.G., E.C., G.E.M., and K.M.H. designed research; L.G., K.M.S., and\nK.M.H. performed research; L.G., K.M.S., and K.M.H. analyzed data; and L.G., K.M.S., E.C.,\nG.E.M., and K.M.H. wrote the paper.\nReviewers: P.S.B., Columbia University; and D.S.M., Princeton University.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis open access article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-\nNoDerivatives License 4.0 (CC BY-NC-ND).\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

They document a\npattern of \"skin-deep resilience\" among African Americans from\nseverely disadvantaged backgrounds wherein those who evince\nhigh levels of self-control prospectively demonstrate better school\noutcomes and mental health than those with lower levels of self-\ncontrol, suggesting that they are psychologically resilient to dis-\nadvantage.

However, the gener-\nalizability of this phenomenon is unclear; most of the findings come\nfrom small cohorts of African Americans in the rural Southeast, and\nwhether the same pattern unfolds with upward mobility in other\nethnic and racial groups across the United States is unknown. The\nmajority of existing research has concentrated on black\u00adwhite dif-\nferences in health (20, 38, 39). However, the stress induced by\nupward mobility is likely greater among any minority group for\nwhom systems of inequality constitute additional and compounding\nbarriers to achieving upward mobility. Indeed, the experience of\nyoung adulthood and the process of becoming socially mobile vary\nby race/ethnicity. Both African Americans and Hispanics are more\nlikely to be incarcerated, live in poverty, be unemployed, and have\nlower incomes for a given level of education compared with whites\n(40\u00ad42). Differences in the life course markers and transitions\namong minority young adults not only affect their prospects for\nbecoming upwardly mobile but also affect the amount of distress\nand sustained effort required to achieve upward mobility. These\ndifferences have important implications for the experience and\npotential health consequences of mobility for minorities.\nWe consider that possibility here, using a large, nationally rep-\nresentative study with longitudinal data spanning 14 y that include\nyoung adults from all race, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic\ncontexts in America. Drawing from the literatures on weathering,\nJohn Henryism, and skin-deep resilience, we predicted there would\nbe racial and ethnic disparities in the mental and physical health\nbenefits associated with a college degree. We used self-reported\ndepressive symptoms as a measure of mental health, as it is a\nmental health problem that increases during adolescence and re-\nmains prevalent for young adults (43\u00ad46). Morbidity and mortality\nare unusual in 24- to 32-y-olds, so we measured physical health in\nterms of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of signs that is common in\nmidlife and forecasts risk for later diabetes, heart attack, stroke,\nand premature mortality (47, 48). Among whites from all socio-\neconomic backgrounds, we hypothesized that finishing college\nwould be associated with uniformly positive returns in adulthood,\nas reflected in fewer depressive symptoms and better car-\ndiometabolic health at ages 24\u00ad32 y. However, among ethnic and\nracial minorities, we hypothesized there would be mixed returns to\nfinishing college, particularly for those from the most severely\ndisadvantaged backgrounds, who are likely to face racism, dis-\ncrimination, and isolation as they progress through education.\nSpecifically, we predicted these individuals will go on to have better\nmental health, as reflected in fewer depressive symptoms at ages\n24\u00ad32 y, but simultaneously worse cardiometabolic health.\nResults\nThe data were drawn from the nationally representative National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health),\nan ongoing study of the social, behavioral, and biological linkages\nin health and developmental trajectories. Our analysis examined\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic young\nadults interviewed in adolescence (wave I, age 12\u00ad18 y) and early\nadulthood (wave IV, age 24\u00ad32 y). From these data we generated\na composite indicator of exposure to disadvantage in adolescence\nby summing the number of top quintile values across household,\nneighborhood, and school contexts (see details in Materials and\nMethods). Table 1 shows that black and Hispanic individuals ex-\nperienced significantly higher levels of disadvantage in adoles-\ncence compared with white peers. By early adulthood, both race/\nethnic minorities were also significantly less likely to complete a\ncollege degree than whites.\nWe measured adult depressive symptoms at wave IV using a\nsubset of nine items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression scale (CES-D) (see details in Materials and Methods).\nWhites reported the fewest depressive symptoms on average\nsurements were collected in home visits during wave IV. We\nconstructed an indicator of metabolic syndrome, modifying slightly\nthe National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines to ac-\ncommodate the available Add Health biomarkers. We used\nmeasures of blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, HDL cho-\nlesterol, triglycerides, and waist circumference (see details in\nMaterials and Methods). Similar to the pattern observed for de-\npression, and consistent with the broader epidemiologic literature,\nwhites were the least likely to have metabolic syndrome (26%)\ncompared with Hispanics (32%) and blacks (35%).\nWe tested for psychosocial resilience using Poisson regression\nfor the count of the number of depressive symptoms reported with\nmodels stratified by race/ethnicity (Table S2). In all models, sex\nand age were modeled as covariates. Individuals from disadvan-\ntaged childhood backgrounds reported more depressive symptoms\nin adulthood, and those who completed a college degree reported\nfewer depressive symptoms. To test whether the association be-\ntween college education and depression varies by level of ado-\nlescent disadvantage we included an interaction term. There was\nno evidence that the depression-buffering association of college\ncompletion varies by exposure to disadvantage in adolescence for\nwhites (P = 0.32) or Hispanics (P = 0.24). Furthermore, among\nblack young adults, a college degree was associated with even\nTable 1.

Controlling for\nbaseline depressive symptoms in adolescence does not sub-\nstantively alter the conclusion. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the results\nwere consistent with the hypothesis that greater educational at-\ntainment is associated with psychosocial benefits for individuals\nfrom all socioeconomic backgrounds and of varying race/ethnicity.\nWe tested the differential benefits of college completion for\nphysical health using logistic regression to predict the odds of\nhaving metabolic syndrome with models stratified by race/ethnicity\n(Table S3). In all models, sex and age were modeled as covariates.\nAmong white young adults, each SD increase in adolescent dis-\nadvantage was associated with a 10% increase in the odds of\nmetabolic syndrome (P < 0.05). College completion was associ-\nated with a 37% decrease in the odds of metabolic syndrome (P <\n0.001). There was no evidence that this health-protective associ-\nation of college completion varied by level of adolescent disad-\nvantage (P = 0.33). Results are substantively similar when\ncontrolling for measures of physical health in adolescence.\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 2, the results were different for black\nand Hispanic adults compared with whites. At low levels of ex-\nposure to adolescent disadvantage college completion predicted a\nlower probability of metabolic syndrome compared with those\nwithout a college degree. However, as exposure to adolescent\ndisadvantage increased, the health benefit associated with college\ncompletion declined. In fact, at high levels of disadvantage (>1 SD\nabove mean), black and Hispanic adults with a college degree\nwere predicted to be more likely to have metabolic syndrome\ncompared with their similarly disadvantaged peers who did not\ncomplete college. For example, a black adult exposed to an ado-\nlescent environment of disadvantage two SDs above the mean who\ncompleted college had a predicted probability of metabolic syn-\ndrome 9% points higher than a peer who did not complete college\nFollow-up analyses verified that the physical health benefit\nassociated with college completion was significantly different for\nHispanic and black adults compared with whites (Table S4).\nSpecifically, we tested for race/ethnic differences in a single lo-\ngistic regression model pooling the three groups and including\nadditional indicators for black/Hispanic identity interacted with\nadolescent disadvantage and college degree (i.e., a three-way\ninteraction). The main effect of college degree indicated that\ncollege completion is associated with lower odds of metabolic\nbetween adolescent disadvantage and college completion--rele-\nvant for the reference group of whites--was not statistically sig-\nnificant (P = 0.54). However, the three-way interaction between\nadolescent disadvantage, college completion, and black/Hispanic\nidentity was positive (OR = 1.44) and marginally significant (P <\n0.10). These findings indicate that for black and Hispanic adults the\nmetabolic \"benefit\" associated with college completion diminishes--\nand indeed appears to become a liability--with increasing levels\nof exposure to adolescent disadvantage.\nDiscussion\nUpward social mobility is a tenet of the American dream. Scholars\nand policymakers interested in health and inequality would hope\nthat greater social and economic advantage attained in adulthood\nwould improve health outcomes compared with remaining disad-\nvantaged. Indeed, many social policies are premised on the belief\nthat by promoting socioeconomic success among the disadvan-\ntaged we can improve their well-being and physical health, cre-\nating a healthier and more productive population. Consistent with\nthese aspirations, we found that young adults from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds who achieve upward mobility by attaining a college\ndegree report fewer depressive symptoms compared with their\nsimilarly disadvantaged peers who do not complete college. This\nrelationship holds for non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics.\nIn contrast, for metabolic syndrome we found that individuals do\nnot uniformly benefit from a college degree; black and Hispanic\nadults from the most disadvantaged backgrounds face higher\nlevels of metabolic syndrome with a college degree than those\nwithout a college degree. While whites from across the socioeco-\nnomic spectrum enjoy a physical health benefit associated with\ncollege completion, blacks and Hispanics from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds see no benefit and at higher levels of disadvantage\nmay actually experience a cost. If this relationship persists through\nadulthood and older age it has the potential to undermine the\nindividual and social benefits of upward mobility.\nThis is the first evidence documenting the psychological benefit\nand physiological deficit of college completion in both disadvan-\ntaged African American and Hispanic American young adults in a\nnationally representative sample. Our findings are consistent with\na pattern of skin-deep resilience among upwardly mobile\nFig. 1. Predicted number of depressive symptoms from race-stratified Poisson regression models allowing for an interaction between adolescent disad-\nvantage and college completion. The association between college completion and depression does not vary according to level of exposure to disadvantage in\nadolescence for whites (P = 0.32) and Hispanics (P = 0.24) and increases with disadvantage for blacks (P < 0.05).\nminorities from severely disadvantaged backgrounds (35, 37).\nWhat might underlie these patterns? We speculate that these\nupwardly mobile minority youth are psychologically hardy.\nHowever, when young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds\nachieve upward mobility the higher-status environment in which\nthey find themselves may differ greatly from their social envi-\nronment of origin (49, 50); such incongruence can lead to iso-\nlation and a lack of social support (20, 51\u00ad53). Furthermore,\nconditions in the environment of arrival may be inhospitable or\nhostile, particularly given discriminatory social structures. Up-\nwardly mobile minorities may also feel that their achieved posi-\ntion is tenuous (54, 55). To cope with these stressors, individuals\nmay deploy strategies that are effective in alleviating mental strife\nbut are harmful for physical health (51, 56). Despite such chal-\nlenges, these young adults complete their degrees and maintain\ngood mental health. As they do so, however, a wear and tear on\nbodily systems from hard-driving effort may accrue.\nIn supplementary analyses of metabolic syndrome (Table S5)\nwe tested the mediating role of four potential mechanisms: indi-\nvidual psychosocial characteristics of striving in adolescence\nand perseverance in adulthood, social isolation in adolescence and\nadulthood, experience of stressful life events in adolescence and\nadulthood and perceived social stress in adulthood, and adoles-\ncent body mass index. Accounting for differences in individual\nlevels of striving and exposure to social stressors does not explain\nthe elevated health risk observed among disadvantaged minority\ncollege graduates. Future research must consider both more nu-\nanced measures of the social context in which upward mobility\noccurs as well as more complicated intersections of stress exposure\nand response.\nThe absence of a physical health benefit to college completion\nfor young adult minorities suggests important implications for the\nlabor force, health care, and the future of inequality. If they do not\nexperience the expected health benefits of educational attainment,\nupwardly mobile minorities may spend less time in the labor force,\nlimiting their resource accumulation and the intergenerational\ntransfer of wealth, consequently stunting potential for reducing\ninequality within and across generations. Furthermore, accelera-\nted physiological deterioration may mean that they will need more\nhealth care at earlier adult ages. Greater health-care costs could\ndivert investment from future human capital development in\nthemselves and their children. Finally, given the persistence of\ninequality and the difficulty of mobility in the United States, it is\ntroubling if the individuals who manage to achieve upward mo-\nbility experience health costs. Perhaps more troubling still is that\nthis pattern is limited to black and Hispanic individuals, poten-\ntially making it more challenging to close existing racial disparities\nin health.\nHowever, it would be erroneous to conclude from our findings\nthat upward mobility is bad for your health and should therefore\nbe avoided. Rather, policies are needed that promote upward\nmobility, making it more common and less stressful, and sup-\nporting the upwardly mobile individual's ability to translate his or\nher additional education into health-promoting resources. This\nshould include increased attention to educational quality in ad-\ndition to access. Recent publicity of the challenges faced by first-\ngeneration college students provides an opportunity to examine\nhow supportive interventions affect not only completion, but\nmental and physical health. Online communities, such as I'm First!,\nprovide student testimonials and information to support first-\ngeneration students in accessing and completing college. Many\ncolleges and universities are beginning to offer programs tailored\nto the needs of first-generation students, such as the Harvard\nCollege First Generation Student Union. Such programs may in-\ncrease feelings of belonging and reduce stress; for example, a\nsocial-belonging intervention not only reduced the achievement\ngap but also demonstrated physical health improvements among\nminority students (57). Design and evaluation of other interven-\ntions, with specific attention to the potential physical health risks\nof college completion among disadvantaged minorities, is a fruitful\narea for future research.\nFuture research can also address a limitation of this study by\nfollowing individuals across the life course to better understand\nhow elevated health risk at this age shapes health and aging tra-\njectories among the upwardly mobile. We examined a composite\nmeasure of metabolic syndrome in early adulthood, when re-\nspondents were aged 24\u00ad32 y. The use of biomarker measure-\nments allows us to investigate risk before disease onset when many\nconditions are asymptomatic or undetected via traditional clinical\nscreening. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether such risk will\nultimately manifest in morbidities, or if upwardly mobile individ-\nuals will be able to translate their accumulating advantage into\nbetter health as they age. Documenting the health consequences\nassociated with social mobility in early adulthood provides a\nFig. 2. Predicted probability of metabolic syndrome from race-stratified logistic regression models allowing for an interaction between adolescent disad-\nvantage and college completion. The association between college completion and metabolic syndrome does not vary according to level of exposure to\ndisadvantage in adolescence for whites (P = 0.33) but increases with disadvantage for blacks (P < 0.01) and Hispanics (P < 0.01). There is evidence that the\nphysical health benefits of education in early adulthood vary by level of exposure to disadvantage earlier in life only for black and Hispanic adults.\nfoundation from which to understand different aging trajectories\nfor those from disadvantaged backgrounds that begin during the\ntransition to adulthood. In addition, the elevated health risk asso-\nciated with upward mobility for disadvantaged minority young adults\nmay partially explain the persistent racial disparity in health across\nplace and time among older adults at the same level of SES (58).\nMaterials and Methods\nSample and Design. Add Health is an ongoing national longitudinal study\nthe study, participants have been interviewed in home at four data collec-\nWe limited our analytic sample to respondents who participated in both\nwaves I and IV in-home interviews, were from schools that participated in the in-\nschool and school administrator surveys, and had valid sampling weights (n =\n14,167). From this sample, we conducted listwise deletion to exclude those\nwithout complete data for all predictors and demographic covariates used in\nthe analysis, leaving us with a final sample size of n = 13,009 for the depressive\nsymptoms analysis. An additional 20% of respondents had missing data for at\nleast one biological indicator of metabolic syndrome, yielding a sample size of\nn = 10,786 for the metabolic syndrome analysis. All data were analyzed with\ninstitutional review board approval from the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill. Information on how to obtain the Add Health data files is\navailable on the Add Health website (www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth).\nRace/Ethnicity. At wave I, individuals were asked, \"What is your race?\" and\ninstructed to indicate as many categories as applied. They were also asked a\nseparate question, \"Are you of Hispanic or Spanish origin?\" We classified\nany individual who indicated yes as Hispanic. We classified individuals as\nnon-Hispanic white if they did not identify as Hispanic and reported their\nrace as white only. We classified individuals as non-Hispanic black if they did\nnot identify as Hispanic and reported their race as black only; 135 individuals\nidentified as both white and black, and were excluded from analysis, and\n370 foreign-born individuals were also excluded from analysis.\nAdolescent Disadvantage. To measure childhood disadvantage, we constructed\na count of 22 binary indicators that capture cumulative exposure to household,\nschool, and neighborhood disadvantage over childhood and/or during ado-\nlescence (wave I; Table S1). Household disadvantage indicators include a binary\nindicator of single-parent family structure at birth, experience of any family\nstructure change across childhood and adolescence, parent education less than\nhigh school, and a retrospective measure of household welfare receipt during\nchildhood or adolescence. Neighborhood disadvantage indicators were taken\nfrom the 1990 US Census to best approximate neighborhood conditions during\nwave I of the Add Health study. Neighborhood disadvantage measures include\nthe tract-level proportion of households receiving welfare, proportion of un-\nemployed adults, proportion of households below poverty line, proportion of\nadults with less than a high school education, proportion female-headed\nhouseholds, proportion black residents, proportion vacant homes, and the\ncounty-level infant mortality rate and violent crime rate. Each item was reco-\nded so those residing in neighborhoods at the top quartile of the distribution\nwere coded as disadvantaged. Finally, indicators of school disadvantage at\nwave I included school-level aggregated measures of the proportion of\nhouseholds receiving welfare, the proportion of unemployed parents, the\nproportion of parents with less than a high school education, and the pro-\nportion of single-parent households. All items were recoded as binary indica-\ntors, with the top quartile coded as disadvantaged. School disadvantage was\nalso captured using wave I school administrator reports of grade retention, the\nschool dropout rate, class sizes, the proportion of teachers with a master's\ndegree, and daily school attendance. Consistent with other items in the index,\nschool administrator items were recoded as binary indicators, with the top\nquartile of grade retention, dropout rate, and class size coded as disad-\nvantaged and the bottom quartile of teachers with a master's degree and\ndaily school attendance coded as disadvantaged. We summed all of the in-\ndicators to create a score ranging from 0 to 22. We standardized the score,\nso that the coefficients associated with the disadvantage index can be\ninterpreted as the change in health risk associated with a one-SD increase\nin disadvantage.\nDepression. At wave IV, respondents were asked how often they \"were both-\nered by things that usually don't bother you,\" \"could not shake off the blues,\"\n\"felt you were as good as other people,\" \"had trouble keeping your mind on\nwhat you were doing,\" \"felt depressed,\" \"felt that you were too tired to do\nthings,\" \"enjoyed life,\" \"felt sad,\" and \"felt that people disliked you\" over the\npast 7 d. Response categories ranged from 0 to 3 and included \"never or rarely,\"\n\"sometimes,\" \"a lot of the time,\" and \"most of the time or all of the time.\"\nItems were summed to produce a continuous scale with a possible range of 0\u00ad27.\nMetabolic Syndrome. For each biomarker measured at wave IV we defined the\nhigh-risk threshold according to the guidelines established by the National\nCholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel when possible. High-risk\nblood pressure was defined as measured blood pressure greater than 130/\n85 mmHg, or self-report of doctor-diagnosed hypertension or antihyper-\ntensive medication. A measured waist circumference of 88 cm or greater for\nwomen and 102 cm or greater for men was defined as high risk.\nNCEP guidelines specify cut points of HDL and triglycerides for risk thresh-\nolds; however, Add Health only releases lipid measurements in deciles due to\ndetrending and interconversion procedures (59). As an alternative classifica-\ntion, we relied on previous estimates from the same time period on the\nprevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in similarly aged males and\nfemales (60). This approach has been used previously to create a modified\nmeasure of metabolic syndrome in Add Health (61). The top three deciles of\ntriglycerides were defined as high-risk for males, and the top two for females.\nThe bottom two deciles of HDL were defined as high-risk for males, and the\nbottom three for females. Finally, the NCEP guidelines use fasting blood glu-\ncose; due to differences in fasting time, we used glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)\nas a measure of glycemic homeostasis. HbA1c levels at 5.7% or greater were\ndefined as high-risk (62). Metabolic syndrome is an indicator, defined as hav-\ning high risk levels on three or more of the component risk factors. Detailed\nAdd Health data collection procedures and biomarker validation are available\nMediators. We tested the mediating role of four sets of potential mechanisms.\nStriving was measured in adolescence (wave I) using a four-item scale drawing\nfrom educational expectations, educational aspirations, hopefulness about the\nfuture, and belief in hard work. We measured perseverance in adulthood (wave\nIV) using nine personality items such as optimism, planning for the future, and\nsense of control over one's life. We tested the role of social isolation using\nscales of social isolation in adolescence (lack of social connections with family,\nfriends, and schoolmates and in the community) and adulthood (lack of social\nconnections with family, friends, community, and other social institutions).\nSocial stress was measured using a count of the number of stressful life events\nreported in adolescence and adulthood, and the Cohen perceived stress scale\nmeasured at wave IV. Finally, we investigated the role of obesity using a\nmeasure of adolescent body mass index derived from adolescent report of\nheight and weight at wave I.\n"
