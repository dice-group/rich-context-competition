Patient autonomy is a central value in Western\nand one of the three fundamental principles of the Charter\non Medical Professionalism (Medical Professionalism\nProject, 2002). Accordingly, this principle states that \"phy-\nsicians must have respect for patient autonomy ... be honest\nwith their patients and empower them to make informed\ndecisions about their treatment\" (Medical Professionalism\nProject, 2002: p.1). This recent official adoption of patient\nautonomy as a part of the physicians' charter thus indicates\nthat health care practitioners are now responsible for pro-\nmoting both autonomy and well-being in their patients\nAccording to Self-Determination Theory, patients'sense\nof autonomy represents a critical component of their moti-\nvational profile (Patrick and Williams, 2012; Ryan and\ntion is of particular importance concerning patient adher-\nence to medical advice, treatment and disease prevention.\nAccording to Sox (2002), \"`the center of patient care is not\nin the physician's office or the hospital.

From the\nperspective of the patient, the seemingly irrational act of\nnon-compliance may be perceived as having a rational\nbasis (e.g., unfavourable cost\u00adbenefit analysis or lacking\nsufficiently persuasive reasons to comply; DiMatteo etal.,\npatient beliefs concerning their personal circumstances,\nprior knowledge and medical options are salient anteced-\nents of their subsequent health-related decision-making;\ntheir personal beliefs concerning medical issues and physi-\ncian support are indeed worthy of empirical study (Donovan\nment in the treatment process and the relationship between\nthe patient and health care professionals are among the core\nelements of patient-centered care internationally (Kitson\netal., 2013).

With respect to the qualities of effective communi-\ncation, findings suggest that shared decision-making, pre-\nsenting options, addressing patients' concerns, and mutual\ntrust are critical to patient\u00adphysician relationships and\nhealth outcomes (Ha and Longnecker, 2010; Hillen etal.,\nmunication between a health care provider and a patient\nthat are captured by the Health Care Climate Questionnaire\ndeveloped by Williams etal. (2000) in which patients' per-\nceptions concerning autonomy-supportive nature of the\nhealth care climate are specifically assessed.\nThe HCCQ has been used in research for over 20years\nto measure patients' perceptions concerning the extent of\nautonomy support provided by their health care providers\n(Fortier et\ncare settings \"refers to providers' interacting with patients\nby taking full account of their perspectives, affording\nchoice, offering information, encouraging self-initiation,\nproviding a rationale for recommended actions, and\naccepting the patients' decisions\" (p. 81). The HCCQ was\ndesigned specifically to assess these specific aspects of\nautonomy support in health care environments. It was\ndeveloped based on prior work with similar questionnaires\nin non-health care settings (Williams etal., 1996), and can\nbe adapted for use with various medical professionals\nincluding physicians, nurses and dieticians (Williams etal.,\n1998b). However, given limited published research to date\non the empirical validation of the HCCQ, the purpose of\nthis study was to assess the validity and reliability of this\nself-report measure. Given that researchers and clinicians\nalike typically prefer less intrusive measures that perform\noptimally, the short 6-item version of the original 15-item\nscale was examined with respect to internal consistency,\nstructural and construct validity, test\u00adretest reliability, as\nwell as descriptive and item-specific statistics.\nScale validation was conducted in a hospital-based sam-\nple of patients diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer. This\npopulation was selected due to clinical guidelines recom-\nmending long-term adherence to a skin self-examination\n(SSE) regimen for melanoma survivors (Coit etal., 2009),\nthereby affording a sufficiently intensive examination of\npatient autonomy in the context of medical adherence. In\naddition to scale validation, the second study objective was\nto examine English\u00adFrench language equivalency in terms\nof mean level differences as well as contrasting internal con-\nsistency, structural validity, and item/scale descriptives\nbetween the English and French samples. French was chosen\nas a second language due to the measure having previously\nbeen employed in French samples (e.g. Fortier etal., 2007)\ndespite no published scale validation for the French version.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe study sample consisted of patients diagnosed with mel-\nanoma skin cancer treated at two major teaching hospitals\nin Montreal, Canada.

The HCCQ was\nutilized to assess the degree to which the participants per-\nceived their physicians as supportive of their autonomy as\nopposed to controlling in nature (Williams etal., 1996).\nSample items include `I feel that my doctor has provided\nme choices and options', `My doctor tries to understand\nhow I see things before suggesting a new way to do things'\nand `My doctor encourages me to ask questions'. Each item\nwas rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The language of the scale is\ndevoid of jargon, double negative statements, and advanced\nvocabulary to optimize accessibility for individuals across\neducation levels. Similar to the original 15-item scale hav-\ning excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha\n()\n=\nhigh internal consistency (Cronbach's =.96) and a 1-fac-\ntor structure were also obtained in the current sample.\nComprising items from the original 15-item version, the\nDetermination Theory, 2017).

Time since diagnosis and cancer\nstage were additionally collected from patients' medical\nfiles and hospital tumour registries. The Physician Support\nof Skin Self-Examination Scale assessed the patients' per-\nspective of their doctors' encouragement of skin self-\nexamination (SSE) (Coroiu et al., 2017). Patients'self-efficacy\nfor SSE was assessed using Skin Self-Examination Self-\nEfficacy Scale (Bergeron et al., 2017). The Skin Cancer\nIndex (SCI) was used to measure patients' worries specific\nto skin cancer (proposed by the original authors as a meas-\nure of quality of life; Matthews etal., 2006; Rhee etal.,\n2007), while the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used\nto assess psychological distress with respect to depressive\nand anxiety symptoms (Kroenke etal., 2010).\nProcedure\nDesign.Ethics approval was obtained from the universi-\nty's faculty of medicine research ethics board. This spe-\ncific study was conducted at two teaching hospitals as part\nof a larger, longitudinal project examining how psychoso-\ncial variables correspond with adherence to medical advice\nduring melanoma follow-up clinical care. Further proce-\ndural details are outlined in a published study protocol\nTranslation.There exists no official validated French ver-\nsion of the HCCQ despite its previous use in English\u00ad\nFrench bilingual settings (e.g. Fortier et\nConsequently, a professional translator was employed to\ntranslate the HCCQ as per a cross-cultural translation tech-\nnique (Banville etal., 2000). First, a professional translator\nfrom Qu\u00e9bec, Canada (study location) fluent in both Eng-\nlish and French translated the HCCQ from the original\nEnglish into French. Second, a bilingual individual without\naccess to the original version back-translated the measure\ninto English. Third, the original and back-translated ver-\nsions were compared and consensus on the final version\nwas reached between both translators. The 7-item response\nformat was retained from the English version (1=fortement\nen d\u00e9saccord, 3=neuter, 7=fortement en accord). The\ntranslated questionnaire items are presented in Table 1.\nAnalyses. The validation analyses were principally conducted\nusing baseline data (Time 1) from the longitudinal project to\nafford the greatest number of participants (N=242). To eval-\nuate test\u00adretest reliability, data from Time 2 (6-month lag,\nassessed. First calculated were item means, standard devia-\ntions (SDs), Cronbach's  if item deleted, inter-item correla-\ntions, corrected item-total correlations and factor loadings, as\nwell as the scale mean and SD. Second, the correlation with\nthe full scale (15-item version) was calculated, followed by\nCronbach's  and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for\nthe 6-item scale. Construct validity was evaluated by com-\nparing the HCCQ to similar and dissimilar constructs using\nPearson's r and point biserial correlations. Reproducibility of\nthe HCCQ scores (test\u00adretest reliability) was assessed by\ncorrelating Time 2 and Time 3 data using the intraclass cor-\nrelation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, floor and ceiling\neffects were investigated.\nEquivalency between the English and French versions\nwas examined by (a) correlating language with the HCCQ\nscore, (b) comparing group means, (c) comparing CFA fit\nand factor loadings between the English and French sub-\nsamples, (d) comparing overall Cronbach's s and\n4 Health Psychology Open \nitem-corrected Cronbach's s of the English and French\ngroups and (e) comparing item-level analytics (inter-item\ncorrelations, item-total correlations, item means).\nConfirmatory factor analyses were conducted using Mplus\nstatistical software (version 7.0; Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n,\nPredictive Analysis Software (PASW version 18; SPSS,\nResults\nDescriptive and item analyses\nItem means were similar in magnitude ranging from 4.74 to\n=\n(average mean across all individual item means). Similarly,\nthe means for the entire scale (regardless of single items\ndeleted) remained within a range of 1 point (from 26.09 to\n(p<.001 for all). Furthermore, corrected item-total correla-\ntions were high and comparable across items (ranging from\n.68 to .82) as were the Cronbach's s if item deleted\n(ranging from .88 to .90). The short, 6-item version of the\nquestionnaire correlated very highly with the original,\nshowed excellent factor loadings (Tabachnick and Fidell,\n2013; for more details on the structural validity see the next\nsection).

First, there is lit-\ntle by way of detailed psychometric information on the\n6-item version of the HCCQ, and only limited data on other\n(Williams et\n(Kasser and Ryan, 1999). Accordingly, the present valida-\ntion analyses of the 6-item official (Self-Determination\nTheory, 2017) brief HCCQ were conducted to address this\nresearch gap.\nSecond, whereas the scale has been used in French, there\nis presently no published information as to its psychometric\nproperties. Thus, not only is a valid French version neces-\nsary for conducting research using the HCCQ with\nFrancophone participants, one must evaluate the corre-\nspondence between the English and French versions to be\nable to directly compare data from French and English\nstudies using this measure. Consequently, we translated the\nHCCQ and evaluated the reliability and validity of the scale\nin both languages in samples of English- and French-\nspeaking melanoma patients.\nOverall, the 6-item HCCQ demonstrated excellent valid-\nity and reliability with respect to internal consistency, struc-\ntural validity, and construct validity.Additionally, acceptable\n3-month test\u00adretest reliability was observed, and floor or\nceiling effects were not detected. Furthermore, the compari-\nson of French and English versions in terms of scale means,\nstructural validity, and internal consistency did not reveal\nsignificant differences between the two subsamples indicat-\ning equivalence of performance in these two languages.\nNevertheless, specific limitations warrant discussion.\nFirst, the data in the present analyses are based on a sample\nof modest size, that although is adequate (minimum 10 par-\nticipants per item, minimum 100 data points overall for the\nCFAs; Terwee etal., 2007), did not significantly exceed\nthe English subsample). Second, in our examination of con-\nstruct validity, it was not possible to compare the HCCQ to\nanother gold standard measure of the `health care climate'\nCzajkowska et al. 7\nor `health care provider support of patient autonomy' as no\nsuch measures exist. Thus, the measures used to establish\nconstruct validity were not redundant but instead repre-\nsented close approximations to the construct proposed to be\ncaptured by the HCCQ.\nThird, whereas it is recommended that reliability testing\nof health status questionnaires be conducted 1 or 2\nweeks\napart \u00ad long enough for the participants to forget scale items\nbut short enough for no significant change to occur (Terwee\net\nmonths with some\npatients likely having consulted different physicians between\nTime 2 and Time 3. Given the substantial time lag, we con-\nsider the strong correlation and the adequate ICC as indica-\ntive of robust test\u00adretest reliability. Given these limitations,\nfuture research to validate the HCCQ in different populations\nwith larger samples and shorter retest lags are encouraged.\nFinally, as the analyses were conducted for patients specifi-\ncally diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, the utility of the\nHCCQ in other populations warrants investigation.\nConclusion\nThe brief, 6-item version of the Health Care Climate\nQuestionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of perceived physi-\ncian support of autonomy among patients diagnosed with mela-\nnoma, as administered in both English and French languages.\nPractice implications\nTo our knowledge, the use of the Health Care Climate\nQuestionnaire in clinical practice has not been reported in\nthe existing literature, and we hope that validating the\nmeasure will open doors to its potential use outside of\nresearch. The HCCQ-6 is recommended as a reliable and\nvalid measure for use in future research and clinical prac-\ntice to assess patients' perceived autonomy in both\nAnglophone and Francophone populations.\n"
