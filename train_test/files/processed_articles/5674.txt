Sputum\nsamples were collected at enrollment during stable state to evaluate the frequency of S.\npneumoniae colonization and in case of an acute exacerbation to evaluate the incidence of\npneumococcal infection.\nResults: A total of 79 stable patients with moderate to very severe COPD were enrolled. A total\nof 217 samples were collected, and 27% (n = 59) of those were positive for S. pneumoniae.\nA total of four exacerbations due to S. pneumoniae occurred during follow up (0.31 per 100\nperson/month). Among positive samples of S. pneumoniae, 109 serotypes were identified. The\nmost frequent serotypes in moderate-to-severe COPD patients during both stable state and\npatients were effectively vaccinated for S. pneumoniae with PPV23 vaccine.\nConclusion: The most frequent S. pneumoniae serotypes in COPD patients are 19F, 18, 19A,\n9V and 35 F, and that almost 50% of S. pneumoniae strains could be covered by PCV13 in adult\nCOPD patients.\n",

The potential bene-\nfit of recent vaccination programs designed for\nthese patients is still unknown and data regard-\ning vaccination coverage and distribution of\npneumococcal serotypes in COPD patients dur-\ning stable state and exacerbation are lacking.8\u00ad11\nVery few studies on pneumococcal infection in\nRole of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection\nin chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\npatients in Italy\nMarco Mantero, Stefano Aliberti, Chiara Azzari, Maria Moriondo,\nFrancesco Nieddu, Francesco Blasi and Marta Di Pasquale\n Keywords: COPD, pneumococcal disease, vaccine\nCorrespondence to:\nFrancesco Blasi\nDepartment of\nPathophysiology and\nTransplantation,\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di\nMilano, Internal Medicine\nDepartment, Respiratory\nUnit and Regional Adult\nCystic Fibrosis Center,\nIRCCS Fondazione C\u00e0\nGranda Ospedale Maggiore\nPoliclinico, via Francesco\nSofrza 35, Milan, Italy\nFrancesco.blasi@unimi.it\nMarco Mantero\nStefano Aliberti\nMarta Di Pasquale\nDepartment of\nPathophysiology and\nTransplantation,\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di\nMilano, Internal Medicine\nDepartment, Respiratory\nUnit and Regional Adult\nCystic Fibrosis Center,\nIRCCS Fondazione C\u00e0\nGranda Ospedale Maggiore\nPoliclinico, Milan, Italy\nChiara Azzari\nMaria Moriondo\nFrancesco Nieddu\nPediatric Section,\nDepartment of Health\nSciences, University of\nFlorence and Anna Meyer\nChildren's University\nHospital, Florence, Italy\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(10)\n404 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nCOPD patients are currently available, and\nreal-life data on respiratory tract infections due\nto S. pneumoniae in Italy are lacking.1 Specifically,\nthere is a lack of data regarding the type and rate\nof vaccination in COPD patients and moreover\npneumococcal serotypes involved are not well\ncharacterized. Therefore, we aimed at describ-\ning the real-life incidence of exacerbations due\nto S. pneumoniae in COPD patients during sta-\nble state.\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe conducted a prospective, observational,\ncohort study including stable COPD patients\nwho were evaluated at least every 4 months over a\n24-month period at the Respiratory Unit of the\nIRCCS Policlinico Hospital in Milan, Italy, from\nStudy population\nInclusion criteria. All outpatients with a diagnosis\nof moderate-to-severe COPD at the enrollment\nvisit and presence of at least one exacerbation\nduring the past year (but not in the last 30 days)\nand chronic sputum production. Ethics approval\nof study protocol, protocol amendments,\ninformed consent forms and other relevant docu-\nments were obtained prior to study initiation from\nthe Independent Ethic Committee. Informed\nconsent was obtained by each patient prior to\nenrollment in the study.\nExclusion criteria\nPatients with a diagnosis of asthma or bronchi-\nectasis at the enrollment visit or with immuno-\nsuppressive or other life-threatening disorders.\nStudy definitions\nModerate-to-severe COPD was defined as a\nforced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced\nvital capacity (FVC) ratio < lower limit of normal\nCOPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained\nworsening of the patient condition from the stable\nstate and beyond normal day to day variations,\nacute in onset and needing a change in regular\nmedication. A stable disease was considered as\nabsence of exacerbation episodes during the last\nS. pneumoniae colonization was present when S.\npneumoniae was found in two different sputum\ncultures recollected within 4 months from each\nother, in absence of an exacerbation event.\nExacerbation caused by an S. pneumoniae infec-\ntion was defined as the concomitant presence\n(during the same visit) of an ongoing exacerba-\ntion according to clinical evaluation and a sputum\nsample positive for S. pneumoniae.\nData collection\nAt each visit, demographic information and med-\nical history, including the presence of a pre-exist-\ning microbial colonization, were collected and\nphysical examination performed. Moreover, at\neach visit patients were questioned about the sta-\ntus of their chronic respiratory symptoms in order\nto identify previous or ongoing episodes of\nexacerbation.\nMicrobiological work up\nSputum samples were collected at enrollment\nduring stable state to evaluate the frequency of S.\npneumoniae colonization and in case of an acute\nexacerbation to evaluate the incidence of pneu-\nmococcal infection. All samples were analyzed for\npathogen identification at the Policlinico Hospital\n(local laboratory) and for polymerase chain reac-\ntion (PCR) testing, antibiotic resistance patterns\nand serotyping of S. pneumoniae samples in\nFlorence, Italy (central laboratory). DNA was\nextracted by a commercial kit for PCR amplifica-\ntion. To confirm the extraction, each DNA sam-\nple was tested for its ability to be amplified with\nB-globin specific primers. S. pneumoniae was\ndetected using real-time PCR, and the same tech-\nnique was used to find the presence of specific\nantibiotic resistance genes (specifically for beta-\nlactam, macrolides and quinolones). PCR was\nused also to describe the different serotypes of S.\npneumoniae, finding the different serotype genes.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were run using SPSS 20\n(IBM). Categorical data are presented as absolute\nnumber (n) and percentage (%). Normally dis-\ntributed data are shown as mean with standard\ndeviation, whereas non-normally distributed data\nM Mantero, S Aliberti et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 405\nare presented as median with interquartile range\n(IQR). The incidence rate was computed as the\nnumber of exacerbations concomitant to S. pneu-\nmoniae infection divided by the person-time of\nobservation.\nResults\nA total of 79 stable patients with moderate to very\nsevere COPD was enrolled. The majority of them\nwere male (81%) and former smokers (59%),\nyears.\nThe number of exacerbation episodes in the\n68% of patients had an influenza vaccination\nduring the year before, while only 32% of\npatients had a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine\n(PPV23) vaccination during the previous 10\nyears, despite national guidelines suggesting\nthat every COPD patient should receive a pneu-\nmococcal vaccination.2\nA total of 59 (91%) patients had at least one spu-\ntum sample collected during the study period. A\n(n = 59) of those were positive for S. pneumoniae.\nAmong patients with a positive sample for S.\npneumoniae, 17 (27%) patients were found to be\ncolonized at least at one visit during the follow-\npatients were colonized at 4-month and 8-month\nfollow-up visits, respectively.\nOverall four exacerbations due to S. pneumoniae\nmonth). COPD exacerbations were 37, and were\nmostly treated with levofloxacin (49%) and\namoxicillin/clavulanate (19%).\nAmong positive samples for S. pneumoniae, 109\nserotypes were identified. The most frequent\nserotypes in moderate-to-severe COPD patients\nduring both stable state and exacerbation were\nF (7%). Only 32% of COPD patients were effec-\ntively vaccinated for S. pneumoniae with PPV23\nvaccine.\nFinally, we found that pneumococcal strains iden-\ntified in our population were resistant to neither\nmacrolides, nor beta-lactams nor quinolones.\nDiscussion\nThe most frequent serotypes in moderate-to-\nsevere COPD patients during both stable state\nF. The serotypes identified in our study are con-\nsistent with previous experiences, except the\ninteresting new finding of high prevalence of sero-\nincrease of serotype 35F among children carriers,\nespecially after the extensive use of pneumococcal\nconjugate vaccine (PCV7) and adult patients with\nboth invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal dis-\nease, even if it was more likely to be associated\nAccording to our results, we might speculate that\nPCV13 could potentially be protective in about\n48% of isolated serotypes in COPD patients,\nfindings partly consistent with previous studies\nthat show a potential coverage from PCV13\nIn patients with COPD, S. pneumoniae,\nHaemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis\nare the main pathogens causing acute exacerba-\nbacteria may chronically colonize the airways and\ncause exacerbations after a simple viral upper res-\npiratory infection or an environmental stress.15\nNevertheless, studies also point out that a signifi-\ncant number of AECOPD infections may come\nfrom bacterial strains that are new to the patient.13\nPneumococcal vaccination could be useful both\nin decreasing S. pneumoniae colonization and\ntherefore subsequent exacerbations, and in\ndecreasing new pneumococcal infections in non-\ncolonized patients.\nMoreover, another interesting finding of our\nstudies is absence of antibiotic resistance, particu-\nlarly macrolide resistance, which is, on the con-\ntrary, described in previous studies.16\u00ad18 This\nresult could potentially affect the choice of antibi-\notic therapy for S. pneumoniae, at least in our geo-\ngraphical area.\nA major limitation of our study consists of its\nmonocentric design which impacts the generaliz-\nability of our results. Another limitation consists\nof the clinical challenge to discern between an\nacute COPD exacerbation and a pneumococcal\npneumonia, in the setting of outpatients with a\npositive sputum culture for S. pneumonia. Adding\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(10)\n406 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\na chest X-ray (CXR) to the evaluation may also\nnot resolve the situation in obese patients or in\nelderly patients with several comorbidities, as\ntheir CXR findings could be equivocal.\nHowever, this is the first prospective and real-life\nexperience in Italy designed according to a high\nlevel microbiological investigation with the aim at\nidentifying the proportion of COPD colonization\nand acute exacerbations attributable to S. pneumo-\nniae and describing serotype distribution and antibi-\notic resistance patterns of pneumococcal isolates.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our study found that the most fre-\nquent S. pneumoniae serotypes in COPD patients\n50% of S. pneumoniae strains could be covered by\nPCV13 in adult COPD patients.\n"
