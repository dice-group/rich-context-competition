Primary prevention of stroke\nincidence did not decline and may have increased during the 1980s, whereas survival after stroke improved substantially\nduring the 1970s and 1980s. The effect of these trends on the prevalence and number of stroke survivors in the United\nStates has not been determined.\nMethods--The prevalence and number of noninstitutionalized stroke survivors in the United States was estimated through\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) I, II, and III, respectively. Prevalence and number of stroke survivors were\nanalyzed by age (25 to 59 and 60 to 74 years), race (non-Hispanic whites/Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic blacks),\nand sex. Estimates were limited to the US population ages 25 to 74 years because NHANES I and II did not include\npersons older than 75 years.\ntime. Additionally, during this period, the estimated number of noninstitutionalized stroke survivors increased by\namong stroke survivors was similar in all 3 periods.\nConclusions--These data point to the increasing importance of the care and rehabilitation of stroke survivors.

These hypotheses were\ntested using data from 3 national health surveys.\nMethods\nFirst, secular trends in stroke mortality for persons 25 to 74 years of\nage were abstracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\nCompressed Mortality Files.19 The Compressed Mortality Files\ninclude individual records abstracted from every death certificate for\npersons dying within all 50 states and the District of Columbia\nexcept for 1972 where sampling, at a rate of 50%, was performed and\ndeaths were weighted accordingly. Mortality from stroke was de-\nfined by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes\nbetween 430 and 438 listed as the underlying cause or mentioned on\nthe death certificate.\nThe prevalence of stroke was estimated using self-report from\nyears of age, interviewed in National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Surveys (NHANES) I, II, III, respectively.20 \u00ad22 Each\nNHANES survey respondent was asked, \"Have you ever been told\nby a doctor that you have had a stroke?\" Self-reported \"health in\nFrom the Department of Epidemiology (P.M.), Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, La; and Departments\nof Medicine (E.G., M.J.K., J.C.), Epidemiology (M.J.K., J.C.), Biostatistics (J.C.), and Health Policy and Management (M.J.K.), and The Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Medicine and Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Md.\nReprint requests to Paul Muntner, PhD, Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University, SPHTM, 1430 Tulane Avenue, SL-18, New Orleans, LA\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ngeneral\" among stroke survivors was assessed on a nominal scale\n(1excellent, 2very good, 3good, 4fair, 5poor). Data for the\ntively, and used multistage probability sampling designs. Prevalence\nand count estimates for each study are averages for the period of time\nduring which the study was conducted.\nBecause NHANES is limited to the noninstitutionalized US\npopulation, we used data from the National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey to assess changes in the number and percentage of patients\nwith an underlying discharge diagnosis of stroke transferred to a\n\"long-term care institution.\" The National Hospital Discharge Sur-\nvey is conducted annually and maintains medical and demographic\ninformation from a sample of discharge records selected from a\nnational sample of non-Federal short-stay hospitals and can be\nweighted to estimate inpatient hospital utilization for the United\nStates.\nStatistical Methods\nto 59, and 60 to 74 years], race [black, white, and other], and sex)\ncomposition of the US population was estimated. Additionally, using\nNHANES interview response, the prevalence of persons reporting a\nhistory of stroke for each time period was estimated for the overall\nnoninstitutionalized US population and for each age, race, and sex\nsubgroup.\nChanges in stroke prevalence and number of stroke survivors\nacross the 3 time periods were assessed using Poisson regression\nwith parametric bootstrapping techniques to estimate standard errors\n(SE).23 Trends in prevalence and number of stroke survivors for the\noverall population and race-sex subgroups were regressed on calen-\ndar year difference between the NHANES survey midpoints (5 years\nanalyzed as a linear variable with estimates expressed for 5-year time\nincrements.

However, because we were\ninterested in changes in healthcare burden, direct adjustment was not\nused in the analyses investigating changes in the number of stroke\nsurvivors. Because of the low prevalence of stroke in the 25 to 39, 40\nto 49, and 50 to 59 year age groups, results for these groups are\npresented combined. Mean response for \"health in general\" among\npersons with and without a history of stroke were compared across\ntime periods. Change in the number and percentage of patients 25 to\n74 years of age with an underlying diagnosis of stroke (ICD-9 code\n430 to 438) discharged to a long-term care institution were assessed\nfrom 1981 (the initial year for which this data were collected)\nRace was recorded differently in the 3 surveys; therefore,\nMexican-Americans were grouped with non-Hispanic whites. Per-\nsons of race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, or Mexican-American were excluded from the race-specific\nanalyses. National estimates for the prevalence and number of stroke\nsurvivors among the noninstitutionalized population of the United\nStates were derived through the application of sampling weights to\nthe survey response.24\nResults\nUS Population Characteristics\nThe number of persons (SE) aged 25 to 74 years in the\nnoninstitutionalized population of the United States increased\npercentage of the US population that was black or male did\nnot change substantially.

These\nresults are concordant with the decrease in stroke mortality\nobserved in data obtained from the compressed mortality files\nand stable stroke incidence observed during the 1980s in\npopulation-based studies.14,15 In sum, these data point to a\ndecreased stroke case-fatality rate which, if present, clearly\nwould be a medical triumph.25 However, its consequence, an\nincrease in stroke survivors potentially living with disabili-\nties, places a burden on the survivor's family, the community,\nand the healthcare system,26 which must be recognized.\nThe current study did not have data to permit the investi-\ngation of trends in disability among the stroke survivor\npopulation. Although changes in \"health in general\" among\nstroke survivors were determined to be minimal, this can only\nbe considered a crude measure of disability after stroke.\nFuture investigations should endeavor to generate more\nTABLE 1.  -adjusted Prevalence of Stroke Among Noninstitutionalized White and Black\nMales and Females in the United States for 3 Time Periods\nChange in Stroke Prevalence\nCI indicates confidence interval; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SE, standard error.\n*Number of persons self-reporting a history of stroke in NHANES.\nFigure 2.

Several\ndifferences between the current study and the previous study\nare worth noting. First, estimates in the previous study were\nbased on data from National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS).  -specific stroke prevalence estimates in NHIS\nare about 50% lower than estimates based on NHANES\ndata.11 For example, based on NHIS estimates, stroke prev-\nalence among the population 45 years of age for the period\nsame age group was 4.6%. Similar discrepancies in disease\nprevalence between NHANES and NHIS are present for\nmyocardial infarction27,28 and may be a result of the use of\nproxy interviews in NHIS. Second, NHIS reported on data\nstroke trends in the US population investigated trends in\ndisability due to stroke and concluded that \"the prevalence of\nlimitation of activity due to stroke did not increase.\" Our\nstudy was limited to self-reported health in general, and\nsimilar to the previous study's results, this measure remained\nunchanged among stroke survivors in all 3 periods. Finally,\nthe current study extends previous reports by combining\nprevalence and population trends to calculate trends in stroke\nsurvivor counts, an important component in assessing the\nburden of stroke survival on the family, community, and\nhealthcare system.\nThere are several caveats that should be kept in mind when\nmaking inferences from these results. First, the assessment of\nstroke was based on self-report. In other studies, about 80%\nof self-reports of strokes can be validated by medical rec-\nords.29 If the validity of self-reports is similar for the\nNHANES surveys, estimates of relative change in stroke\nprevalence will be unaffected by such misclassification.30\nHowever, because of improved neurological imaging proce-\ndures, stroke may be better detected and more accurately\nreported in the later periods. Second, the NHANES surveys\nare limited to the noninstitutionalized civilian population of\nthe US; a large proportion of stroke survivors may have\nsevere disabilities, be in nursing homes, and not part of the\nsurveyed (target) population in NHANES.11 Thus, the report\nlikely underestimates the population burden of disease. How-\never, data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey\nindicates that a substantial change in the number of hospital-\ndischarged patients aged 25 to 74 years sent to long-term care\nrecording of race groups in NHANES I and II necessitated the\ngrouping of Mexican-Americans with non-Hispanic whites.\nThe prevalence of a history of stroke was different between\nMexican-Americans and whites in NHANES III, but we were\nunable to assess trends in any such difference. Although the\noverall results are unaffected by this concern, the race-\nspecific analyses should be interpreted with caution. Finally,\nthe prevalence of stroke is low, limiting the precision of the\nestimates. For example, in NHANES I, only 292 participants\nhad a self-reported history of stroke; this relatively small\nnumber resulted in substantial variability in estimates, wide\nconfidence intervals surrounding point estimates resulting in\nnonstatistically significant results, and an inability to inves-\ntigate trends in more refined subgroups. However, the survey\nmethodology applied in the current analysis takes into ac-\ncount the sampling design used in NHANES, providing\nconfidence that the estimates attained are reliable.\nThe NHANES I and II surveys included only the popula-\ntion under age 75 years.20,21 Thus, trends in stroke prevalence\nin the US population older than age 75 years cannot be\nestimated. The population older than 75 years of age com-\nprises a substantial percentage of stroke incidence, preva-\nlence, and mortality. In NHANES III, the prevalence of\nstroke among the population older than age 75 years was\nmillion stroke survivors older than 75 years of age in\nNHANES III, bringing the total number of stroke survivors in\nthe prevalence of stroke remained constant (11.3%) in this\nage group, the number of stroke survivors age 75 and older\nTABLE 2.

This is likely to be an underestimate to\nthe extent that survival from stroke improved during the\nsurvivors for the population older than 75 years may have a\nsubstantial effect on stroke trends if these changes differ from\ntrends in younger age groups. Future investigations should\nfocus on the prevalence of stroke among the population older\nIn conclusion, the age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence\nof stroke among the US population 25 to 74 years of age\n1991.
