Angles such as aesthetic, emotive, symbolic, psy-\nchic, cathartic, cryptic, normative, perfunctory, and meta-\nphysical have all been covered in manifold definitions of and\nabout music; yet, a consideration of music as a mere sonic\nmaterial presents music as the conscious and, at times, fortu-\nitous combination of individual notes that appear succes-\nsively (melody) or simultaneously (harmony), or even both.\nThe foregoing is true whether the medium of music-making\nis vocal, instrumental, or vocal\u00adinstrumental.\nMusic-making, therefore, is a global practice, but what is\narguable is that music is, solely, a human practice. The argu-\nment arises from expressions such as \"music of the spheres,\"\n\"celestial music,\" \"music of the gods,\" \"music of the spirits,\"\n\"mating songs and dances of certain animals,\" \"songs of\nbirds,\" \"musical cry of hounds,\" and \"musical murmur of\nbrooks.\" It is in support of renegotiating the musical sound-\nToday all sounds belong to a continuous field of possibilities\nlying within the comprehensive dominion of music:\nBehold the new orchestra: the sonic universe!\nAnd the new musicians: anyone and anything that sounds!\nThere is a shattering corollary to this for all music educators.\nFor music educators are the custodians of the theory and practice\nof music.\nAnd the whole nature of this theory and practice is now going to\nhave to be completely reconsidered. (p. 2)\nIt is in this proposal for a renegotiation and complete\nreconsideration of the theory and practice of music that the\npresent study of the philosophical angle of the folk songs of\nthe Igbo finds fascination. This fascination stems from the\nfact that the folk music of the Igbo is a communion shared by\nthe supernatural, the supra-terrestrial, the human, and the\ninforms,\nIgbo music is more than mere music. To the owners and\npractitioners, it is a living force that yields to various forms of\nmeanings and interpretations. It is just not one thing but many\nthings reviewed from a prism, which unifies all . . .At once, Igbo\nmusic becomes a philosophy, metaphysics. (p. 128)\nEducation of the Igbo child is, therefore, a sacred duty con-\nducted through music--along with other media of transmission.\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nIkenna Emmanuel Onwuegbuna, Department of Music, University of\nEmail: ikenna.onwuegbuna@unn.edu.ng\nPhilosophical Embodiments in Igbo Music:\nAn Analysis of Mike Ejeagha's \"Popular\"\nFolk Songs Style\nIkenna Emmanuel Onwuegbuna1\n Keywords\nfolk songs, interethnic pop music, textual content, igbo philosophy, symbolism, Mike Ejeagha\n2 SAGE Open\nFolklore, mnemonics, jingles, slogans, memory enhancers,\nand other agencies of education are first encountered in\nmusic.\nPhilosophy\nConceptually, philosophy can be considered to be man's crit-\nical approach to the acquisition and coordination of knowl-\nedge of his universe, using tools such as thought, logic, and\ntranscendental means to demystify the so-called mysteries\nbehind beingness, existence, reality, and nature. It also cov-\ners a set or system of ideas, opinions, beliefs, or principles of\nman's behavior based on an overall understanding of his\nexistence and the universe (Encarta Encyclopedia, 2013;\nDictionary, 1998). Much as professional philosophers are in\ndisagreement over a globally acceptable definition of phi-\nlosophy, some definitions still carry their weight in the field\nof philosophical studies. One such definition is that of a fore-\nmost professor of philosophy, Nwala (2007), who argues,\nNo definition of philosophy can be complete without taking into\naccount the nature of the more traditional world views, the\nproduct of ancient sages and the critical mass reflections and\nnature of reality including the nature of world views. (p. 21)\nMuch as there are diverse views about the definition of\nphilosophy, its regional application has never been as con-\ntestable as its interpretative and pedagogic approaches. This\naccounts for why we have medieval philosophy, Greek phi-\nlosophy, Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy, Islamic phi-\nlosophy, Western philosophy, African philosophy, and Igbo\nphilosophy. It is the latter that is, indeed, the thrust of the\ncurrent discourse.\nPhilosophy as it concerns the Igbo would, naturally, give\ninsights into the Igbo general world view about the people,\ntheir religion, art, language, culture, morals, social organiza-\ntions, belief patterns, divinity, time, matter, energy, space,\nand life generally; mostly in consonance with African phi-\nlosophy--part and parcel of which the Igbo is (Nwala, 1985;\nOkafor & Emeka, 2004; Okafor, Nwokike, Eziechi, &\nIgbo Music\nThe enterprising Igbo merchants of Southeastern Nigeria\nwere known worldwide for their commerce and industry.\nTheir ingenious transactions with Portuguese and British\ntrade partners led to the establishment of international mer-\ncantile firms such as the United African Company.,John\nHolt, P.Z., Miller Brothers, and Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise de\nl'Afrique de l'Ouest in Nigeria today. It is also to their credit\nthat international markets in Onitsha, Aba, Nnewi, and Port\nHarcourt and many road networks, rail lines, airports, and\nseaports were constructed to favor access to commercial and\nindustrial areas of Nigeria (Ozigbo, 1999).\nExotic in taste, lovers of innovation, and explorers of\nopportunity, Igbo merchants brought home fascinating items\nand practices of the various foreign cultures they had had\ncontact with. Such items and practices included dress, lan-\nguage, music, religion, and manipulated ethnicity (Collins &\nRichards, 1982). The foundation for the development of the\nNigerian first popular genre with national appeal was laid by\nthe ubiquitous Igbo minstrels who combined elements of\ntheir entertainment music of igede, ifo, nkwa, egwu-une,\negwu-amala, and so on, to form the initial neo-folk, native\nblues styles of dodokido and akk n'egwu--the precursors\nThe musical proceeds of these culture contacts between\nthe Igbo and her immediate and distant neighbors form a cor-\nnerstone in the musical style of Mike Ejeagha, the subject of\nthe current discourse. Akk n'egwu, the folkloric popular\nmusical style is one of the major proceeds of this culture con-\ntact, and it was Mike Ejeagha who popularized it. The major\nmusical instruments that accompany the Ejeagha's akk\nn'egwu include the Western guitar, chaka (beaded-gourd\nrattles), kpkl (wooden claves), and gba (membrane\ndrums).\nThe justification for locating Ejeagha's Akk N'Egwu\nwithin the matrix of Igbo cultural contact with her neighbors\nand foreigners is contained in the fact that urbanization and\nindustrialization, the offshoots of 19th century global mod-\nernization, and territorial expansion for commercialization\nof the excess products of some rich and powerful European\nnations, led to the disruption of traditional attitudes and life-\nstyles of the African nations. Different ethnic groups\nmigrated to the urban centers to form a stratified society\nbased on socioeconomic status. This new social order dif-\nfered widely from the traditional homogeneous ethnic set-\ntings. In expressing their musical artistry, these urban\ndwellers, drawn from different ethnic backgrounds, created a\nsyncretic urban neo-folk music classified as Interethnic pop\nstyles. In its unfolding as causes and effects in the time\u00ad\nspace structure, the definitive peculiarities of this form\ninclude the use of foreign musical instruments, expressions,\nand recording technology. This moves the cultural practice\nbeyond oral tradition to audio recording--what Goodman\n(2008) aptly captures as \"From Village to Vinyl.\" The fore-\ngoing is true about Ejeagha's Akk N'Egwu.\nMike Ejeagha: The Musician\nMichael Nwachukwu Okolo Ejeagha (a.k.a.Gentleman Mike\nEjeagha) was born in the month of August, 1932. He hails\nfrom Imezi-Owa, in the Ezeagu Local Government Area of\nEnugu State. Upon completion of his primary school educa-\ntion in 1948, Ejeagha started learning how to play the acous-\ntic guitar under the tutelage of Moses \"Moscow\" Aduba and\nCyprian Uzochiawa--taking advantage of his proximity to\nthese professional guitarists with whom he shared a common\nneighborhood at Coal Camp, in Enugu.\nOnwuegbuna 3\nAfter his apprenticeship under the Paradise Hotel's\nRhythm Orchestra, in Enugu, Ejegha's professional career as\na musician took off in the 1950s with his Mike Ejeagha and\nMerry-Makers Band. The band later transformed into the\nPremier Dance Band in the 1960s and has grown from\nstrength to strength since then. So far, Ejeagha has more than\n33 record albums and four singles--in the forms of vinyl,\nCDs, VCDs, and cassette tapes--to his credit (Nwagbo,\nEjeagha's compositional rationalization bestrides the cre-\native and methodical thoughts involved in composing most\nfolk songs. These creative thoughts are determined and\nshaped by the society's musical system, and influenced by\nthe society's folk musical thought and rules regarding inspi-\nration and fantasy. What Ejeagha does, in line with the fore-\ngoing, therefore, is to rearrange some extant Igbo folk songs\nto suit his akk n'egwu medium of presentation as well as\naccommodate the limitations of his choice of musical instru-\nments for performance.\nMike Ejeagha: The Music, the Songs\nWith the definitions of music, folk (also traditional) music,\nand popular music already given in the foregoing expos\u00e9, it\nis equally necessary to look closely at the word song. A song\nis a musical experience, expression, or composition that\ninvolves the setting of text to melody for vocal performance.\nSuch texts are often metrically composed verses, which\naccount for why they readily lend themselves to melodic\ninterpretations. They may or may not be accompanied by\nmusical instruments. However, some of such songs are, at\ntimes, delivered through the medium of musical instruments.\nThey are still identified as songs because they retain their\ntext-driven melodic expressions (Apel, 1964; Oxford Talking\nDictionary, 1998). The implication of the aforesaid is that\nthere could be music without song, but all songs still remain\nmusic. However, the Igbo use the term egwu in a generic\nsense for various musical activities. They include music,\nsong, dance, games, drama, festival, and banter. Hence, there\nare activities as follows:\n1. Egwu Imo Awka--\u00adImo Awka festival,\n2. Egwu nwa--moonlight plays,\n3. Egwu ekpili--ekpili music,\n4. Egwu maz--children's games,\n5. Egwu okolba--youthful banter, and\n6. Egwu nyanga--graceful dance.\nIn the case of Mike Ejeagha, while his style of music--the\nakk n'egwu--falls within the popular class, his songs are\nstill redolent of the folk. The modal melodies, the country-\nside lyrical contents, and the close-knitted intervallic ambi-\nence of his songs are evident features of the African folk\ntunes. Akk n'egwu, the literal translation of which is \"story\nin song,\" is delivered in a vocal technique that employs an\ninterchange of speaking and singing, couched in folkloric\nmusical activities--a practice that is often linked with the\ngriots, the folk poet\u00admusician\u00adhistorians of North and West\nAfrican regions. These explain why Ejeagha is here referred\nto as the folkloric popular musician.\nThe Song Texts\nSong 1: Omekag\nOpi m fugbuelum Omekag; Opi m fugbuelum Omekag\nMy horn, please, blow Omekagu to death\nOmekag lil' ji Mm; Omekag lil' ede Mm\nOmekag ate the yam of the Spirit; Omekag ate the cocoyam of\nthe Spirit\nb' n'ifugbuelum Omekag, fugbuelum Omekag\nIf you could just blow Omekag to death, blow Omekag to\ndeath\nKa m wel' ebini gwa yi aka\nSo I could sacrifice a ram in appreciation\nb' n'ifugbuelum Omekag, fugbuelum Omekag\nIf you could just blow Omekag to death, blow Omekag to\ndeath\nKa m wel' ebini gwa yi aka\nSo I could sacrifice a ram in appreciation\nMa g jide ogu, jide f; Ma g jide ogu, jidekwa f\nBut ensure you are just and fair; but ensure you are truly just and\nfair.\nOh ghoo, oh gho-oghoo; Oh ghoo, oh gho-oghoo!\nA summary of the story behind this song goes as follows:\nThe King, upon envisaging his imminent death from old age,\nassembled the elders and council of chiefs of his kingdom to\nintroduce to them the heir apparent to the throne. But instead\nof presenting his first son, as the custom of the land stipu-\nlates, the King presented his younger son, named Omekag.\nHis reason was that he loved Omekag better--whom he had\noften praised beyond the skies; thereby spoiling him. This\nunjust deprivation of the right of primogeniture of the first\nson was unacceptable to the elders and chiefs, who walked\nout on their King in disapproval. The King, adamantly,\nparaded Omekag to his community on the appointed market\nday. It was as this parade progressed that his aggrieved first\nson picked up the magical horn he received from the Spirit\nland and sounded the quoted song. The result: The horn did\nas was implored, striking Omekag to death; the King and\nthe entire community apologized to the first son; he reversed\nthe song of his magical horn; Omekag resurrected; the\nrightful heir was reinstated; and peace and harmony were\nrestored to the community.\nSome of the symbols in the song include the following:\n1. Omekag--the leopard brand (a name and an item of\ncharacterization),\n2. Opu--musical horn (voice and power of the Spirits),\n3. f na Ogu--justice and fair-play,\n4. Ebini--Ram (forbearance and resilience),\n4 SAGE Open\n5. Eze--King (spiritual and temporal ruler, custodian of\nOmenan),\n6. Ji na ede--Yam and cocoyam (totality of the agrarian\neconomy of the Igbo).\nThe philosophy therein. The song, Omekag, is Number 1 in\nthe Omenan series by Mike Ejeagha. Omenan (also\nOmenana, Omenal, or Omenala) stipulates, assigns, inter-\nprets, and orders in totality, the norms and values of the Igbo\nUmeh, 1999). Looking at Omenan as what accords to the\ncustoms and traditions of the Igbo, Nwala (1985) writes,\nOmenala includes major beliefs about the origin of the universe\nand its nature, the place of the spirits, deities, man and other\nbeings in the universe, the nature or character of taboos,\nregulations, prescriptions and prohibitions as to what is proper\nin such a universe--rules of marriage, sexual intercourse,\nattitudes to strangers--and forms of social relationship, as well\nas the realm of simple decency and etiquette. Indeed, Omenala\nis a body of law and morals along with their metaphysical\nfoundations. (p. 27)\nInjustice is a negation of Omenan, and when it is done by\nthe custodian of the Omenan himself, the Spirits of the land\nwould wade in on the living to defend the offended. As long\nas the oppressed is on the side of justice and fair-play, he is\nalways assured of the intercession of the Spirits. The face-\nlessness of both the king and his first son (none of whose\nnames were given in the story) speaks volumes about the\nimpartiality of the Spirits in administering justice. Ma g jide\nogu, jidekwa f--But ensure that you are truly just and fair!\nIt is this disposition of justice and fair-play that gave the\noppressed the qualification to \"receive\" the magical horn\nfrom the Spirits. The communion of the living and the dead\n(the immortal Spirit-Ancestors) is not a mere belief in the life\nof the Igbo; it is a reality. Hence, Arazu (as cited in Umeh,\nIgbo realization (not belief) of the existence of that which is\nbeyond the material, that which supports and modifies the\nmaterial, that which is the ultimate basis for the phenomenon of\nlife (Ndu) manifesting in matter, is expressed in the term Mm.\nWhen man puts off his material cocoon at what is called death\n(nw), he continues to exist on the other side of existence in a\nlife that is not cut off from relationships and mutual influences\nwith the world of the bodily senses of those who are on this side.\nTo further justify his claim to fair-play, and therefore, his\nqualification to receive divine assistance, the oppressed had\nto inform that Omekag lil'ji Mm; Omekag lil'ede Mm\n(Omekag ate the yam of the Spirit; Omekag ate the\ncocoyam of the Spirit). It is mere foolhardiness for a mortal\nto pounce on the entire economic wealth of the Spirits--as\nequated to Omekag's crime against the land. This is a highly\nphilosophical allusion, for, according to Nwala (1985), \"In\nIgbo traditional society we find evidence of economic factors\nreciprocably interacting with religious and philosophical\nideas\" (p.176). And touching on gender-sensitive issues,\nwhile yam represents the entire economic wealth of the male,\nand cocoyam represents the entire economic wealth of the\nfemale Spirits, a distress call from an oppressed mortal, with\nthis form of allusion, would surely put the Spirits on the dou-\nble to help. And it did!\nMost religious doctrines uphold the idea that divine utter-\nance is heard as sound. In the Igbo cosmology, this sound is\nmusical. Spirits speak to mortals via coded musical sounds,\nthe meaning of which can only be deciphered by the Afa\npriests and the initiated. The nonlexical syllables (often,\nerroneously, termed nonsense vocables) are actually the\ncoded language of the Spirits, and the onomatopoeic Oh\nghoo, oh gho-oghoo is, in effect, the voice of the Spirits\nspeaking through the medium of the magical horn that was\n\"received\" by the oppressed heir.\nKa m wel' ebini gwa yi aka (So I could sacrifice a ram in\nappreciation) is a figurative expression that conveys the\nmeaning, \"So I could forbear and defeat my assailant without\nviolence.\" This underscores the Igbo's belief in nonviolent\nresistance to evil and injustice. Rather than take the laws into\nhis hands, the Igbo would seek divine intervention in matters\nof misunderstandings and disagreements. This philosophy is\nborne in the name China (i.e., Chi nal m g)--Let my\npersonal God fight the fight for me.\nThe issue of postmortem among the Igbo is more spiritual\nthan physiological. The cause of physical death of humans is\noften traced back to the Spirits, and not just the disease that\nmay have ravaged only the body. This philosophy is\nexpressed in the Igbo adage: A chba isi ch e jee n'z\n(literarily, \"If you want to trace the cause of the murder/man-\nslaughter, you go to the blacksmith\"). The idea is that it was\nthe blacksmith that manufactured the weapon with which the\ncrime was committed. In the case of Omekag, it was the\nconsultation with the Afa priest that revealed that his sudden\ndeath was due to his connivance with his father, the King, to\ndispossess his elder brother, the rightful heir, of his right of\nprimogeniture.\nOmekag, as the title of the song as well as the name of\nthe protagonist, also stands as an item of imagery and char-\nacterization. Literarily meaning \"the leopard-brand,\"\nOmekag images a spoiled-brat who gloats about in a devil-\nmay-care attitude. His destination is quite predictable: disas-\nter, not minding that he may have the backing of the \"High\nand Mighty.\" The moral of this imagery is central to Igbo\nphilosophy of childbearing and rearing. Humility is a virtue,\nand pride is a vice. For this reason, Ejeagha warns against\notuto ntoghu na-egbu nwankta (the highly bloated praises\nthat lead the dog to its untimely death).\nIn all, the Omekag story-in-song (akk n'egwu) has\ntouched on the entire aspects of what Ekwunife (1997) calls\nthe quinquagram of Igbo traditional religious cultural\nOnwuegbuna 5\nvalues. They include life (nd), offspring (mm), wealth\n(ak na ba), peace (udo), and love (fnanya). The death\nand resurrection of Omekag provide insights into life as a\nsupreme value in the Igbo nation. The presence and activities\nof the two sons (offspring) of the King can be easily seen as\nthe hub upon which the whole story is built. The value of\nwealth (as typified in the throne) can also be appreciated by\nthe conflicts that arose from dispossessing the rightful heir\napparent to the throne. For the love of peace, the subjects\nboldly disagreed with their King, notwithstanding his power\nand might. Eventually, it was fraternal love that assuaged the\npains of the offended prince, which led to his act of reversing\nhis request of the Spirits.\nSong 2: Nwa Bu Onyinye Chukwu\nbanuju eeh--ehee! banuju eeh!!\nTal nnukwu aff na be diya maka ifi nwa.\nSuffered a great deal in her husband's house due to childlessness.\nMana O mesl nba di z, wee mta m saa.\nBut she latter remarried and begot seven children.\nIfele b nke onye? Ifele b nke di mb.\nWhose then is the shame? The shame is on the first husband.\nBiko, b'achkwa unye g na nwa b onyinye Chukwu.\nPlease, do not sack your wife because, childbearing is the gift of\nGod.\nThe story. banuju got married to a husband (di) who, soon\nafterward, started mounting pressures on her to give him off-\nsprings. Under the pressurized situation, banuju could not\nconceive, and this caused the husband to lose his patience\nand resorted to maltreating her. This situation endured for a\nlong time until banuju packed out of her husband's house\nand remarried. It was in this latter marriage that she begot\nseven children, thereby leaving the former husband in shame\nand disrepute.\nSome of the symbols in the song include,\n1. banuju--one that arrives in time of abundance (a\nname and an item of characterization).\n2. Di--husband (patience).\n3. Nwa--offspring (succession, perpetuation of lineage,\ntrue-wealth).\n4. saa--seven (fullness of a major cycle in Igbo\nnumerology).\nThe philosophy therein. The entire story of banuju is fore-\nshadowed by irony. The irony of the name banuju (one\nthat arrives in/with abundance of wealth) could not be deci-\nphered by the husband, whose titular status is \"patience\" (di\nb ndidi). In his impetuous temperament, he impeded and\neventually chased away the potent true-wealth in his wife,\nbanuju. The manifestation and realization of the full\npotentials of banuju had to wait until she found courage to\nquit her impatient husband and married a truly patient one (di\nb ndidi). Part of Igbo philosophy is that one's given name\nwould fit and shield the one like a cloak, only when the one\nunderstands the full import of the name. Ejeagha, in line with\nthis philosophy, sings Onye lie afa  s na nke ya kas nma\n(When one benefits from the full imports of his name, he\nacclaims that his is the best).\nThe issue of the offspring comes up again in this song.\nNwa, as a great value symbolizing succession, perpetuation\nof family lineage, and true-wealth, is the central theme of\nthis song. z e ji nwa adgh echi echi (the path that is\ncleared with offsprings is never terminated) is an Igbo adage\nthat supports the philosophy of nwa among the Igbo. The\nabsence of offsprings in banuju's first marriage was\nresponsible for her woes; the presence of offsprings in her\nsecond marriage restored her dignity. Mere (as cited in\nTraditionally children are highly valued. They have to continue\nthe ancestral line in order to retain the family's ownership of\nwhatever property belongs to it. The reality of family extinction\ncannot be ducked where children are not forthcoming. Such a\nsituation is socially abominable. On the part of any Igbo parents,\nhaving children wards off the anxiety of growing old and fear of\nloss of property to undeserving fellows. (p. 77)\nsaa (also asaa), which is the number \"7,\" is very impor-\ntant in Igbo numerology. It represents the fullness of a major\ncycle in the philosophy of the Igbo. Izu n'asaa (seven weeks),\nnwa n'asaa (seven months), mmili n'asaa (seven seas), and\nag n'asaa (seven forests) are all Igbo expressions regarding\nspace and time, and the asaa (or saa) here underscores the\ncentrality of the Number 7 in Igbo philosophy of numbers as\nsymbols of reality. For instance, 1 month (28 days), which is\nmade up of 7 weeks (1 week being 4 days) is calculated as 4\n\u00d7 7 = 28; to travel to the Spirit land, the traveler has to cover\nseven seas and seven forests in his travel. This philosophy of\nfullness of cycle is inherent in Ejeagha's story of Nwa Bu\nOnyinye Chukwu, woven around the character of banuju\nand her birth of seven children.\nSong 3: Udegbunam\nUde . . . Udegbunam; ude ndma, Ude!\nUde . . . Udegbunam; fame of the good people, Ude!\nNneg s g ejene zala g'agbue akw, Ude!\nYour mother asked you not to go to the wilderness to harvest\npalm fruit.\nNnag s g ejene zala g'agbue akw, Ude!\nYour father asked you not to go to the wilderness to harvest palm\nfruit.\nI kachie nti jebe.\nIn disobedience you went.\nMalkwa na mgba abl g, mgba ndmm,\nBe aware that a wrestling match that turns into a fight is a fight\nagainst the Spirits\nUdegbunam, Ude!\n6 SAGE Open\nThe philosophy therein. The child that dares his parents (and,\nas a matter of fact, his elders) is regarded as one who is so\ncallous as to challenge the Spirits to a bout. The counsel of\nelders is considered the wisdom of the ancestors, and a brash\nnegation of their admonition often leads to adverse repercus-\nsions. A supporting adage says that what an elder sees from\nhis humble stead under a tree, a child would climb the top of\nthe tree without seeing anything.\nConclusion\nThe utilitarian and contingent functions of music--espe-\ncially in Africa--put music in the center stage of therapy,\nworship, patriotism, social mobilization and control, enlight-\nenment, commerce, transcendental supplication, national\ndevelopment, and philosophy. Music, when composed and\nperformed with full complements of its cultural flavors, has\na carny way of engaging the lives of its consumers in an\nintense emotional and mental absorption. Beyond the text,\ndance, drama, art, and poetry, Igbo folk songs also embody\nphilosophies that are as personal to the musicians as they are\nuniversal to the contemplators. In aggregation, the Igbo folk\nsongs embody various dimensions of philosophy with global\nrelevance and appeal. Personal opinions held by individual\nartistes or groups form the bulk of the ideological stance of\nsuch musicians. These opinions could be philosophical, reli-\ngious, spiritual, political, interpersonal relationships, and the\ntotal world view of the artistes, which are revealed in the\nlyrics (including determinate associations of instrumental\nmelodies), personality image of the artistes, and their style of\nusage of polyglottism.\nTo benefit the most from these songs, the contemplator of\nthe art would need to have a thorough knowledge of the lan-\nguage and culture of the Igbo. The job of accessing this artis-\ntic treasure would become easier when ethnomusicologists,\nlinguists, philosophers, historians, and specialist scholars\ngather, articulate, and systematize the instructional value of\nthe philosophy embodied in these songs, and introduce the\nsame to related disciplines in the humanities and social sci-\nences for sincere, serious, and vigorous academic teaching\nand learning. Until this is done, professional philosophers\nand scholars of African descent may never realize how much\ndisservice they are doing to their continent and her posterity\nthrough their conscious or sub-conscious neglect of this\nunique and lucrative cultural heritage.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nApel, W.
