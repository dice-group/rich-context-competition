Positive associations between mindfulness and intuitive eating and negative links between\nintuitive eating and hedonic hunger and BMI were observed over time. BMI gainers experienced a significant decline in\nintuitive eating across the first college semester. No significant between-group effects for mindfulness or hedonic hunger\nwere detected. Preliminary results suggest that changes in internally derived appetite- and consumption-regulating processes\nmay underlie weight gain during the first-year college transition. Implications for optimizing college health promotion efforts\nfor young women at this developmental juncture are discussed.\n",

Consequently, a corresponding\nsurge in contemporary public health science has sought to\ncapture the magnitude and determinants of weight gain and\nother body composition changes occurring at this develop-\nmental juncture (e.g., Vella-Zarb & Elgar, 2009). Although\ndata generated from an influential quantitative review\nrevealed that the average weight gain observed during the\nfirst-year transition is considerably less than the popular\nweight increase still exceeds rates found in the general popu-\nlation (Levitsky, Halbmaier, & Mrdjenovic, 2004).\nNevertheless, stemming the cumulative impact of even small\nincreases in weight may mitigate risk for cardiometabolic\nmorbidity in ensuing adulthood.\nA major ecological contributor to the heightened vulner-\nability to overconsume and gain weight during the first year\nof college appears to be the relatively unlimited access to\nhighly palatable, calorically dense yet nutritionally deficient\nfoods (e.g., Levitsky et al., 2004). Indeed, studies have\nshown that entering college students consider the easy access\nto unhealthy foods served in \"all you can eat\" on-campus\ndining facilities, the close proximity of restaurants serving\nlow-cost fast food in conjunction with the limited availabil-\nity of healthier food options as key environmental barriers to\noptimal weight management (Greaney et al., 2009; Nelson,\nKocos, Lytle, & Perry, 2009). Quantitative evidence further\ncorroborates these qualitatively derived themes. Levitsky\net al.'s (2004) prospective analysis showed that consuming\nevening snacks, high-fat junk foods, and eating meals in \"all\nyou can eat\" dining halls accounted for significant variance\nin first-year weight gain.\nNotably, this phenomenon also extends to students'imme-\ndiate residential environment.

Interestingly, some of the unhealthier items dis-\ncovered were actually procured from the \"care packages\"\nreceived from home (Nelson & Story, 2009). The constant\nmedia barrage of food and beverage product advertising tar-\ngeting college-age youth serves as yet another environmental\nmechanism that further amplifies perceptions of the omni-\npresence and ready availability of a wide array of highly\nappetizing food for this at-risk population (Nelson, Story,\nLarson, Neumark-Sztainer, & Lytle, 2008).\nNonetheless, it is apparent that not all individuals are\nequally susceptible to overeating when exposed to the ines-\ncapable plethora of tasty albeit mostly unhealthy food\noptions. The modern conceptualization of hedonic hunger\nhas emerged to characterize variability in the sensitivity to\nthe reward properties of highly palatable food present in the\nenvironment (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Hedonically driven\nappetite processes reflect a psychological desire to consume\nfood for pleasure and represent a salient preoccupation with\nfood in the absence of true homeostatically driven physio-\nlogical hunger (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Scholars further con-\ntend that this extrinsically activated dimension of appetite is\npromoted by the ambient permissive social norms that\nencourage overconsumption in the United States' exces-\nsively rich food climate (Lowe & Butryn, 2007). Hedonic\nhunger was shown to positively correlate with a range of\nmaladaptive eating patterns (Finlayson, Cecil, Higgs, Hill, &\nGreen, 1990) and was elevated among obese relative to non-\nobese individuals (Cappelleri et al., 2009). One earlier study\nfound that college students who reported greater weight fluc-\ntuations tended to endorse lower efficacy in being able to\nresist the temptation to eat in the presence of palatable food\nversus their weight-stable peers (Toray & Cooley, 1997).\nNevertheless, evaluating the contribution of hedonic hunger\nto risk for first-year college weight gain specifically is sur-\nprisingly underdeveloped in the scientific literature. Results\nfrom a single prospective analysis conducted with first-year\nstudents in the United Kingdom indicated that possessing a\nstronger appetitive drive stimulated by the presence of envi-\nronmental food cues was predictive of changes in fat-free\nmass during this developmental transition (Finlayson et al.,\n2012). Researchers however did not specify whether changes\nin hedonic hunger were observed over time in relation to\nfirst-year weight gain status.\nAlternatively, individual differences in mindfulness and\nintuitive eating may serve as internally derived appetite reg-\nulatory processes that counteract the potent desire to eat in\nexcess of energy needs in the context of an overabundance\nof enticing high-calorie foods present on and in the vicinity\nof today's college campuses. Indeed, the construct of mind-\nfulness which has its historical roots in ancient Buddhist\ncontemplative traditions invites individuals to adopt a non-\njudgmental awareness to one's present moment experiences\n(Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Mindfulness has been studied exten-\nsively in Western science in recent decades (Greeson, 2009)\nand of relevance to the present investigation has been inno-\nvatively integrated into psychological and behavioral inter-\nventions for eating disorders (see Wolever & Best, 2009, for\na review), and for enhancing the regulation of weight and\nmetabolism (e.g., Daubenmier et al., 2011). Therefore, when\napplied to the context of eating mindfulness invokes a dis-\ncerning though relaxed awareness of the intricacies of the\nentire eating process by cultivating a multisensory engage-\nment of the complex interplay between internal (e.g.,\nthoughts, emotions, hunger, and satiety cues; Hepworth,\ntastes, textures, aromas, and colors of foods; contextual trig-\ngers such as the influence of food advertisements and social\nsituations involving tempting foods: Framson et al., 2009)\nfactors that regulate appetite and food intake. Of note,\nGrinnell and colleagues were the first to explore the rela-\ntionship between mindfulness, weight-related behaviors,\nand anthropometric parameters among first-year college\nstudents (Grinnell, Greene, Melanson, Blissmer, & Lofgren,\n2011). In the authors' cross-sectional analysis, mindfulness\nwas negatively associated with emotional eating and exter-\nnal eating; less-mindful students exhibited marginally larger\nwaist circumferences than their more-mindful peers\n(Grinnell et al., 2011). Although this research constitutes a\nunique contribution to the literature, the prospective associ-\nation between changes in mindfulness and weight gain sta-\ntus among first-year college students has not yet been\nexamined.\nAkin to mindful eating, an intuitive eating style is an out-\ngrowth of positive psychology and describes an approach to\nfood intake that is characterized by the unconditional per-\nmission to eat, eating for physiological rather than emotional\nreasons, and trusting the wisdom of the body's appetite sig-\nnals to guide the process of eating (Tylka, 2006). Studies\nhave cited positive relationships between intuitive eating and\nbody appreciation (Augustus-Horvath & Tylka, 2011) as\nwell as inverse associations with measures of eating pathol-\nogy (Tylka, 2006). Although cross-sectional research has\ndemonstrated a negative relationship between intuitive eat-\ning and body mass index (BMI) in a college female sample\n(Tylka, 2006), it remains to be clarified whether changes in\nthis adaptive eating orientation are associated with weight\ngain status among first-year females specifically.\nTo address the aforementioned evidentiary gaps, the pri-\nmary objectives of the present pilot investigation were (a) to\nexamine the linear relationships between hedonic hunger,\nmindfulness, intuitive eating, and BMI at the beginning of\nthe fall and spring semesters, and (b) to ascertain whether\nbaseline levels as well as changes in these externally and\ninternally mediated appetite and food intake regulating char-\nacteristics across the first college semester differed by BMI\ngain status in an ethnically diverse sample of first-year\nfemale undergraduates. Based on prior research (e.g.,\nWebb et al. 3\n2011), we anticipated observing positive relationships\nbetween mindfulness and intuitive eating as well as negative\ncorrelations between these variables and BMI and hedonic\nhunger irrespective of time of assessment. We further sur-\nmised that individuals who experienced an increase in BMI\nbetween the start of the fall and spring semesters would pos-\nsess lower mindfulness and intuitive eating scores and con-\nversely higher hedonic hunger scores at baseline relative to\nthose who did not gain weight. Last, we predicted a signifi-\ncant decline in adaptive self-regulatory characteristics and an\nincrease in the urge to eat in the presence of palatable food\nover time among weight gainers.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe analyses reported here were generated from a larger ini-\ntial-stage prospective cohort investigation seeking to eluci-\ndatebiopsychosocialcontributorstomodifiableweight-related\nbehaviors, weight gain, and other body composition changes\namong ethnically diverse first-year college women. In all,\n134 first-time first-year female undergraduates (54 Black/\nAfrican American [B/AA] and 80 White/European American\n[W/EA]; M age = 18.1, SD = 0.29) were recruited at the start\nof the fall semester in September (T1) of the year they entered\ncollege. Eighty-three participants (n = 39 B/AA students)\nreturned to complete a second series of follow-up assess-\nments in January (T2) as the spring semester commenced.\nMeasures\nDemographic questionnaire and body composition measure-\nments. Participants completed a standard demographic ques-\ntionnaire at T1 and at both time points had the following\nbody measurements taken: height, weight, waist and hip cir-\ncumference, and percentage of body fat. For the purpose of\nthe present analysis only BMI is reported here.\nMindfulness.The 12-item Cognitive and Affective Mindful-\nness Scale\u00adRevised (CAMS-R; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar,\nGreeson, & Laurenceau, 2006) measures the construct of\nmindfulness with specific emphasis given to four domains:\nattention, present-focus, awareness, and nonjudgment. Items\ninclude, \"I can tolerate emotional pain,\" and \"I am able to\naccept the thoughts and feelings I have.\" Participants are\nasked to rate responses on a 4-point Likert-type scale. After\nreverse scoring Items 2, 6, and 7, higher scores indicate\ngreater mindful qualities. The total scale showed acceptable\nlevels of internal consistency when tested with two separate\nduring the original series of validation studies. The Cron-\nbach's alpha coefficient derived from the present sample\nreached adequate levels ( = .71).\nIntuitive eating.The 21-item Intuitive Eating Scale (IES;\nTylka, 2006) is a composite measure of the construct assess-\ning attitudes characterized by offering oneself the uncondi-\ntional permission to eat, eating for physical versus emotional\nreasons, and trusting internal hunger and satiety cues to guide\nthe eating process. Items include, \"I can tell when I'm slightly\nfull\" and \"I trust my body to tell me what to eat.\" Greater\nendorsement of an intuitive eating style is indicated by higher\nscores. A high level of internal consistency for the total scale\nwas observed in the original series of validation studies con-\nducted in large samples of college women (s ranged from\nin the present sample exceeded adequate limits ( = .77).\nHedonic hunger. The 30-item Situational Appetite Measure\u00ad\nUrges (SAM-U; Stanton et al., 1990) is one of the two ver-\nsions of the Situational Appetite Measure (SAM) that were\ncreated to assess urges to overeat in selected situations\n(SAM-U) and self-efficacy in controlling urges to overeat\n(Situational Appetite Measures-E; SAM-E). The present\nstudy only used one of the five subscales within the SAM-U.\nThe 6-item Food Presence subscale was selected as a brief\nmeasure of hedonic hunger. Participants are asked to indicate\nwhether they feel the urge to eat in specific situations on a\n5-point Likert-type scale. Items include, \"When I am around\nfood or food is easily available\" and \"When I try to eat just a\nlittle of some good food.\" Higher scores indicate the pres-\nence of a greater desire to eat. Adequate internal consistency\nwas observed for the Food Presence subscale (females,\n = .78; males,  = .75) among college students in the origi-\nnal validation studies. The Cronbach's alpha for the current\nsample exceeded acceptable limits ( = .79).\nProcedure\nHuman subjects'approval was obtained from the appropriate\nuniversity Institutional Review Board prior to participant\nrecruitment. Participants provided written informed consent\nat the beginning of the fall semester. At both time points,\nparticipants completed a battery of psychosocial question-\nnaires after which anthropometric measurements were taken\nin a semiprivate lab space. At each visit, participants had the\noption of receiving either research credit in a participating\nPsychology course or a US$20 Visa debit card as an\nincentive.\nStatistical Analyses\nPreliminary descriptive statistics were computed to evaluate\nthe distributional characteristics of all study variables. These\ninitial data screening methods supported employing standard\nparametric analytic procedures. An alpha level of .05 was\nused to determine statistical significance though marginal\ntrends (i.e., reaching an alpha level between .05 and .10) are\npresented to offer beneficial avenues for future research to\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Paired t tests denoted a significant decline in intui-\ntive eating scores among BMI gainers between the two first-\nsignificant effects for hedonic hunger were not detected with\nrespect to this set of analyses.\nDiscussion\nThe first year of college has been targeted as a period of\nheightened risk for excess weight gain among emerging\nadults and the mere presence of a vast array of highly palat-\nable and often unhealthy food options is suggested to exert a\npowerful influence on these adverse changes in weight and\nbody composition. While others have examined psychologi-\ncal and behavioral factors that differentiate between those\nwho do and do not gain weight during the first-year transi-\ntion (e.g., Hodge, Jackson, & Sullivan, 1993; Jung, Bray, &\nWardle, 2007), our preliminary investigation was the first to\nexplore the influence of variables reflecting adaptive dimen-\nsions of self-regulating appetite and food intake in this devel-\nopmental context. Indeed, somewhat in accordance with\ninitial predictions we found noteworthy effects for intuitive\neating while statistical trends tentatively point to the utility\nof further evaluating individual differences in mindfulness\nand/or mindful eating in association with weight gain status\namong first-year college women.\nBaseline sociodemographic and anthropometric charac-\nteristics did not strongly distinguish first-year BMI gainers\nfrom nongainers. Notably, those who experienced an eleva-\ntion in BMI across the first college semester were not more\nlikely to be overweight or obese. This is in contrast to\nresearch which concluded that starting college at a higher\nbody weight is a risk factor for enhanced first-year weight\ngain relative to underweight/normal weight peers (Kasparek,\nCorwin, Valois, Sargent, & Morris, 2008; Webb & Hardin,\n2012). Yet these previous analyses were based on examining\nmean changes in body composition. Conversely, the present\ncomparisons were not based on stratifying the sample rela-\ntive to a predetermined threshold of significant BMI gain,\nwhich may explain why the link to overweight/obesity status\ndid not emerge.\nRegarding the correlational findings, results partially sup-\nported initial hypotheses. Positive associations were observed\nbetween mindfulness and intuitive eating and the latter was\nshown to negatively correlate with BMI and hedonic hunger\nat both first-year assessments. These effects replicate and\nextend earlier research conducted in college (Tylka, 2006)\nand community-dwelling female samples (Augustus-\nHorvath & Tylka, 2011). Not surprisingly, higher levels of a\nconstructive approach to appetite and food intake that is\ngrounded in valuing the inner wisdom of the body (vs. food-\nrelevant cues in the external environment, negative emo-\ntional activation, and/or rigid, internalized food rules), which\nprioritizes homeostatically driven eating behavior were\nindicative of espousing broader mindful self-regulation char-\nacteristics, lower BMIs, and less susceptibility to the pull of\nthe availability of enticing foods.\nMindfulness however, was only modestly correlated in\nthe negative direction with BMI at the beginning of the\nspring semester, whereas significant linear associations\nbetween hedonic hunger and mindfulness and BMI were not\nfound. This pattern of results suggests that general mindful\nawareness may be more strongly linked with changes in BMI\nor specifically with overweight/obesity status (Framson\net al., 2009). Moreover, variation in a mindful eating orienta-\ntion could be of greater relevance to consider in relation to\nindividual differences in the sensitivity to the reward proper-\nties of highly palatable foods present in the surrounding\nenvironment (Framson et al., 2009). It is also plausible that\neffects for hedonic hunger would have emerged in a larger\nsample with greater inclusion of young women with elevated\nbody weights and/or dietary restraint as is suggested by pre-\nOur prediction that first-year women who possessed\nhigher BMIs at the start of the spring semester versus the\nbeginning of the fall semester would have entered college\nwith lower levels of mindfulness and intuitive eating in con-\njunction with higher levels of hedonic hunger was not con-\nfirmed. In fact, BMI gainers reported a marginally higher\nlevel of mindfulness qualities at baseline though the validity\nof this finding is somewhat tenuous given the limited statisti-\ncal power of the analysis. Collectively, these largely null\nresults could stem from categorizing participants on a crude\nTable 2.

Furthermore, recent work\nby Provencher and colleagues proffers the usefulness of\naccounting for individual differences in baseline scores on\nrisk factors for eating disorders (e.g., dietary restraint) as a\ncontributor to delineating weight gain status (Provencher\net al., 2009). Thus, markers of greater disturbed (vs. adap-\ntive) eating processes may be more indicative of baseline\nvulnerability for first-year weight gain. Alternatively, per-\nhaps significantly higher scores on mindfulness (or mindful\neating) and intuitive eating and lower levels of hedonic hun-\nger at the outset of college are more predictive of enhanced\nweight maintenance and/or weight loss among first-year col-\nlege women. Replicating our analyses in a larger sample and\nfurther classifying nongainers in this manner which is more\nclosely aligned with the analytic approach cited in previous\net al., 2007) might lend support to this speculation.\nHowever, we did find partial support for the hypothesized\nassociation between BMI gain status and changes in extrinsi-\ncally and intrinsically mediated appetite and food regulatory\ncharacteristics during the first-year transition. More specifi-\ncally, students who experienced an increase in BMI between\nthe two assessments showed a significant decline in intuitive\neating scores and on average reported engaging in intuitive\neating to a lesser extent at the beginning of the spring semes-\nter than nongainers. The aforementioned statistical trend\nindicating marginally higher mindfulness scores at baseline\namong BMI gainers yet comparable means at the second\ntime point in comparison with nongainers tentatively implies\na potential reduction in this self-regulatory attribute, the\npresence of which could be more reliably detected in a larger\nand higher powered participant sample.\nWe also cannot rule out the possibility that individual dif-\nferences in intuitive eating processes are sensitive to the\nnaturally occurring changes that transpire in the early college\nas well as a result of engaging in a targeted behavioral\nintervention (Bacon, Stern, Van Loan, & Keim, 2005; Cole\na diverse range of body weights and eating patterns. However,\nrobust changes in arguably more stable appetite and food\nintake regulating qualities such as mindfulness and hedonic\nhunger may not emerge outside of the context of more\nfocused and intensive psychological treatments for individu-\nals with clinically significant levels of excess weight (e.g.,\nDaubenmier et al., 2011) and/or eating pathology (e.g.,\nCarter, McIntosh, Joyce, Frampton, & Bulik, 2006). Further\ndisentangling these relationships certainly merits future\nscholarly attention.\nThese novel albeit preliminary findings should be inter-\npreted cautiously in light of the following caveats. First, our\nmodest-sized, exclusively female sample precludes general-\nizing results to male first-year students. Second, due to a siz-\nable attrition rate analyses were underpowered to potentially\ndetect a stronger moderating effect for mindfulness. Third,\nevaluating the contribution of hedonic hunger within this\nbody of research would be further refined by incorporating a\nmeasure such as the Power of Food Scale (Lowe et al., 2009)\nthat provides even broader coverage of the construct. Other\nsuggestions for future analyses include exploring the pres-\nence of alternative moderators of shifts in these psychologi-\ncal appetite-regulating qualities in concert with weight gain\nstatus such as current dieting status/level of dietary restraint,\nrace/ethnicity, and BMI status at college entry. Subsequent\nefforts would also benefit from elucidating whether declines\nin mindfulness and intuitive eating in fact mediate weight\ngain and changes in other markers reflecting heightened car-\ndiometabolic risk (e.g., percentage of body fat, waist circum-\nference, waist-to-hip ratio, etc.) among first-year college\nwomen.\nIn conclusion, the general urge to eat when highly palat-\nable food is available in the environment (without consider-\ning elevations in dietary restraint and/or body weight\nconcurrently) may not be a robust vulnerability factor associ-\nated with weight gain during the first-year college transition.\nAlternatively, declines in factors associated with an\nTable 3.
