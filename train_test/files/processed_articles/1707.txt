Serum phosphorus > 4.2 mg/dl and 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 17.6 ng/ml were more common at\nlower eGFR levels. No association was present between lower eGFR and serum calcium < 9.4 mg/dl.\nConclusions: This study indicates that elevated iPTH levels are common among patients with moderate CKD.\nAlterations in bone and mineral metabolism are\npresent in nearly all patients with stage 5 chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) (1,2). Although severe os-\nteodystrophy is less common in earlier stages of CKD, elevated\nintact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, considered one of\nthe earliest markers of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in\nCKD, have been reported frequently in clinic-based studies of\npatients with renal insufficiency (3\u00ad10). Also, even moderate\nreductions in renal function have been associated with signifi-\ncant increases in the risk of hip fracture (11,12). However, the\nstage of CKD at which iPTH begins to increase and the risk\nfactors for elevated iPTH have not been well characterized (13).\nTo identify and manage metabolic bone abnormalities in the\ncontext of CKD, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initia-\ntive (K/DOQI) guidelines recommend routine measurement of\nserum iPTH, phosphorous, and calcium levels (13). Among\npatients with elevated iPTH above the target range, assessment\nof serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status and correction\nof 25(OH)D insufficiency are recommended. In addition, di-\netary interventions, including reduced phosphorous consump-\ntion, may be required. However, many patients find adherence\nto such diets difficult (4,14,15). Therefore, phosphate binders\nand calcitriol should be considered as adjunctive therapy\nDespite these guidelines, knowledge of the epidemiology of\nmetabolic bone disease in the population with less severe CKD\nremains limited (18,19). Given the large number of patients\nwith CKD, characterizing the burden of, and outcomes associ-\nated with, alterations in bone and mineral metabolism has\nimportant clinical implications. Furthermore, studies of early\nCKD are essential for preventing adverse outcomes caused by\nlongstanding untreated mineral metabolism alterations. To bet-\nter characterize the level of renal function at which markers of\nmetabolic bone disease become abnormal, we analyzed data on\nestimated GFR (eGFR) and iPTH from the population-based\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nPublished online ahead of print.

Participants\nwere selected for enrollment by means of a stratified, multistage prob-\nability sampling strategy.

Of relevance to the current anal-\nysis, variables collected during the in-home interview included age,\nrace/ethnicity, sex, menopausal status (for women), cigarette smoking,\nalcohol consumption, education, household income, and medical his-\ntory. For the current analysis, race/ethnicity was defined as non-His-\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other.

Three BP measurements were taken\nduring the examination visit using a protocol adapted from the Amer-\nican Heart Association. On the basis of the average of the three mea-\nsurements, hypertension was diagnosed if any of the following condi-\ntions was met: systolic BP  140 mmHg, diastolic  90 mmHg, or\nself-reported current use of BP-lowering medication. Because fasting\nplasma glucose level was available only from a subsample of partici-\npants, diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of a previous\ndiagnosis by a doctor or other healthcare provider while not pregnant,\nalong with current use of insulin and or oral hypoglycemic drugs.\nDuring the medical examination, a 24-h dietary recall was conducted. A\nsecond recall was conducted by telephone 3 to 10 d later. For the 3680\nparticipants who completed both recalls, the average calorie and cal-\ncium intake was used for analysis. Data from a single recall was used\nfor the remaining 269 participants who completed the first but not the\nsecond diet recall. Total calcium intake (mg/d) was calculated as the\nsum obtained through diet and supplementation.\nDetailed descriptions of blood collection and processing are provided\nin the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Man-\nual. Serum iPTH was measured at the University of Washington on an\nElecsys 1010 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany),\nusing an electrochemiluminescent process. To measure iPTH, this sec-\nond-generation method uses a biotinylated monoclonal PTH-specific\nantibody and a monoclonal PTH-specific antibody labeled with a ru-\nthenium complex to form a sandwich complex. This assay provides\nmeasurements of iPTH within 10% of the Nichol's Allegro assay (21).\nThree levels of control specimens were used to assess the quality of\neach serum iPTH run. Coefficients of variation for serum iPTH re-\nmained  10% throughout the study period. On the basis of the\ncut-point for defining elevated iPTH among adults with stage 3 CKD\nfrom the K/DOQI guidelines, elevated serum iPTH was defined as \n70 pg/ml (13). Serum calcium and phosphorus levels were measured\non the Synchron LX20 (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) . Serum cal-\ncium was corrected for serum albumin using the formula: adjusted\ncalcium  measured calcium  [(4.0  serum albumin in g/dl)  0.8].\nSerum 25(OH)D was quantified by RIA with a I125-labeled tracer, using\nthe DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy) assay in a two-step procedure (22). Ele-\nvated serum phosphorus was defined as values in the highest quartile\n( 4.2 mg/dl), and low serum calcium and 25(OH)D were defined as\nvalues in the lowest quartile ( 9.4 mg/dl and  17.6 ng/ml, respec-\ntively).\nSerum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic method of\nJaffe. Serum creatinine measurements were consistent with the assays\nused in the development of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\nstudy equation, which was used to calculate eGFR (23).\nStatistical Analyses\nThe overall age-standardized geometric mean serum iPTH and the\nprevalence of iPTH  70 pg/ml were calculated and stratified by\nparticipant characteristics. Standardization was performed to the age\ndistribution of the United States' adult population. Differences in age-\nstandardized means and proportions across categories were calculated\nusing linear and logistic regression models, respectively. Next, the\ndistribution of iPTH was plotted separately for non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans, and for men and women.\nTo explore iPTH levels across a broad range of eGFR (i.e., from 30 to\ngenerated using quantile regression models for the median and 75th\nand 90th percentiles of iPTH after standardization to 60 yr of age and\nthe sex and race/ethnicity distribution of U.S. adults (51% women, 80%\nnon-Hispanic white, 12% non-Hispanic black, and 8% Mexican-Amer-\nican). Next, eGFR was categorized into three levels:  60, 45 to 59, and\nserum iPTH and age-standardized prevalence and multivariate-ad-\njusted prevalence ratios of elevated serum iPTH were calculated by\neGFR level. Three sets of multivariate analyses were performed. Ini-\ntially, the association of iPTH with eGFR was calculated after adjust-\nment for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. A subsequent model included\nadditional adjustment for menopausal status (for women), household\nincome, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass\nindex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vitamin D supplement use, and\ntotal calorie and dietary calcium intake. A final model also included\nadjustment for serum calcium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D levels. Linear\ntrends across eGFR levels were calculated by including eGFR level as\nan ordinal variable in the regression model. In secondary analyses,\nage-standardized geometric mean serum calcium, phosphorus, and\n25(OH)D levels, and prevalence and prevalence ratios of low serum\ncalcium, high serum phosphorus, and low 25(OH)D by level of eGFR\nwere calculated.\nFinally, correlates of elevated serum iPTH were determined for the\noverall population and separately among participants with and with-\nlence ratios. Data were reanalyzed with elevated iPTH defined as levels\n65 pg/ml, the upper limit of normal for the assay used in NHANES\nmanagement was performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,\nNC), and all analyses were weighted to the U.S. population using\nSUDAAN 9.01 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC) after taking into account the multistage, complex survey design of\nResults\nThe geometric mean serum iPTH level was 39.3 pg/ml (95%\nadults had an elevated iPTH (Table 1). Levels of serum iPTH\nwere higher at older age and, after age-standardization, among\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans (compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites). Levels were also higher at progressively\nhigher body mass index levels and among participants with\nhypertension. Also, after age-standardization, serum iPTH lev-\nels were lower among former and current smokers (compared\nwith those who never smoked), those who consumed  2\ndrinks per day (compared with nondrinkers), and those who\ntook vitamin D supplements. Levels were also lower at higher\nlevels of calcium intake and at higher levels of serum calcium,\nphosphorus, and 25(OH)D.\nThe distribution of serum iPTH for non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-Americans overlapped sub-\nstantially (Figure 1). However, the median and 75th and 90th\npercentiles of serum iPTH levels were higher among non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans compared with non-\nHispanic whites. Specifically, the median iPTH levels were 37,\namong non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexi-\ncan-Americans, respectively. The entire iPTH distribution over-\nlapped for men and women, and the median and 75th and 90th\npercentiles were nearly identical (38, 51, and 69 pg/ml, respec-\ntively, for men, and 39, 52, and 68 pg/ml, respectively, for\nwomen; Figure 2).\nFigure 3 displays the age, race/ethnicity, and sex standard-\nized median, and 75th and 90th percentiles of serum iPTH by\neGFR. The median serum iPTH was  50 pg/ml for eGFR\nfor the 75th and 90th percentiles of serum iPTH; levels were\nGeometric mean serum iPTH and the age-adjusted preva-\nlence of elevated serum iPTH  70 pg/ml was higher at lower\neGFR categories (Table 2). After adjustment for age, race/\nethnicity, and sex, and multivariate adjustment, the prevalence\nratios of elevated serum iPTH were progressively higher with\nlower eGFR levels. No association was present between eGFR\nand low serum calcium levels. There was a trend toward higher\nprevalence of elevated serum phosphorus at lower eGFR levels,\nboth before and after multivariable adjustment. The prevalence\nof 25(OH)D  17.6 ng/ml was higher at lower eGFR levels.\nHowever, this association was no longer present after multi-\nvariate adjustment for serum iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus\nlevels.\nTable 3 summarizes risk factors for elevated iPTH. After\nadjustment for race/ethnicity and sex, older age was associated\nwith an elevated serum iPTH. After adjustment for age and sex,\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans were more likely\nthan non-Hispanic whites to have elevated serum iPTH. Fur-\nthermore, after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, and sex,\nobesity, hypertension, and low levels of serum calcium, 25(OH)D,\nand eGFR were associated with elevated serum iPTH. Addi-\ntionally, current smokers, compared to never smokers, and\nparticipants who consumed  2 drinks of alcohol per day\nversus nondrinkers, participants with higher dietary calcium\nintakes, and those who took vitamin D supplements were less\nlikely to have elevated serum iPTH. These associations re-\nmained present, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjust-\nment. After multivariate adjustment, men were 1.55 (95% CI:\nserum iPTH. Of note, adjustment for serum calcium, phospho-\nrus, and 25(OH)D reduced the prevalence ratio of elevated\nserum iPTH for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-His-\n1.63). These results were consistent for persons with and with-\nout stage 3 CKD (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study demonstrate a strong association\nbetween moderate CKD and a higher prevalence of elevated\nserum iPTH levels in a large, nationally representative sample\nof U.S. adults. The prevalence of elevated serum iPTH, defined\nin the current study as  70 pg/ml, was higher at lower eGFR\nlevels. Given estimates that 15 to 16 million U.S. adults have an\nreaching public health significance for musculoskeletal and\ncardiovascular outcomes in these individuals (24).\nFor the 2003 K/DOQI guidelines, an evidence review team\nidentified several studies, mostly with small sample sizes, of\nthe association between renal function, before the need for\ndialysis treatment, and serum iPTH levels (13). More recently,\na graded association between lower eGFR and a higher preva-\nlence of iPTH  65 pg/ml was reported among a moderate-size\npopulation of patients (N  1814) recruited from clinical offices\nin the United States and Canada and enrolled in the Study for\nthe Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease (25). The current study\nextends previous findings to a large, nationally representative\nsample of the U.S. population. In addition, independent pre-\ndictors of elevated iPTH levels were identified in the study\npresented here.\nNon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans in this study\nwere more likely to have elevated iPTH compared with non-\nHispanic whites. This finding is consistent with a previous\nstudy of patients with CKD that reported blacks to have higher\niPTH compared with nonblacks (26). Although a previous\nstudy has reported higher dietary calcium intake among whites\ncompared with blacks in the United States, adjustment for\ndietary calcium intake did not fully explain the higher preva-\nlence of elevated iPTH among non-Hispanic blacks in this\nstudy (27). On the basis of our data, lower serum 25(OH)D\nlevels appear to explain a substantial proportion of the higher\nlevels of elevated iPTH in non-Hispanic blacks. Interestingly,\nMexican-Americans in the current study also had higher iPTH\nlevels compared with non-Hispanic whites. Few data have been\npublished on iPTH levels among Mexican-Americans. Given\nthe strong association between elevated serum iPTH and health\nTable 1.

It has been hypothesized\nthat smoking causes an increase in plasma ionized calcium or\nchromogranin peptides and decreased bone formation, and that\nthere is a direct toxic effect of cigarette smoke on parathyroid\ncells (29,30). Also, alcohol consumption has been shown in vitro\nas well as in two human studies to reduce osteoblast activity\n(31\u00ad33). Further research is needed to understand the mecha-\nnisms underlying the associations of cigarette smoking and\nalcohol consumption with lower levels of iPTH.\nThe 2003 K/DOQI guidelines recommend routine measure-\nment of 25(OH)D levels in all patients with CKD and iPTH\nlevels above the target range, and treatment with vitamin D2\n(ergocalciferol) supplementation if serum 25(OH)D levels are \n30 ng/ml. This recommendation is based on the observation\nthat reductions in 25(OH)D, the substrate for renal production\nvitamin D, are associated with compensatory in-\ncreases in serum iPTH levels in individuals with normal renal\nfunction. When the concentration of 25(OH)D exceeds 30 ng/\nml, vitamin D supplementation no longer decreases serum\niPTH levels (34). Therefore, 25(OH)D deficiency may aggravate\nelevations in serum iPTH in CKD, and the prevention of vita-\nmin D deficiency may reduce the frequency and severity of\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism. The majority of the adults\nwith reduced eGFR in this study had 25(OH)D levels  30\nng/ml, highlighting the need for measuring vitamin D levels in\nThe data presented here also support a role for 25(OH)D\ndeficiency in the etiology of elevated iPTH in CKD. For exam-\nple, black race and obesity are recognized risk factors for\n25(OH)D deficiency. Blacks have a markedly increased risk of\n25(OH)D deficiency, largely as a result of the decreased ability\nof pigmented skin to synthesize vitamin D3\nafter exposure to\nsunlight (35). Multiple studies have demonstrated that obesity\nis associated with lower 25(OH)D levels and higher PTH levels\n(36\u00ad38). In our study, adjustment for 25(OH)D levels attenu-\nated markedly, but did not fully explain, the associations be-\ntween these risk factors and elevated PTH levels.\nData from experimental models suggest that iPTH has direct\ntrophic effects on myocardial myocytes and interstitial fibro-\nblasts (39,40). Importantly, higher serum iPTH levels in the\ncontext of stage 5 CKD have been associated with increased\ncardiovascular disease and mortality (41). Furthermore, a rela-\ntionship between abnormal mineral metabolism and vascular\nhealth has been reported in previous epidemiologic studies of\nthe general and stage 5 CKD populations (42). Abnormalities in\nmineral metabolism may lead to calcification of soft tissues and\nvascular tissue. Schulz and colleagues described an association\nbetween rates of spinal bone loss and aortic calcification in\npostmenopausal women with osteoporosis (43). Also, Braun\nand colleagues reported a correlation between lower bone mass\na group of dialysis patients (44).

Fewer data\nhave been published on the association between these abnor-\nmalities across the full range of eGFR (46). In the current study,\nthere was no association between serum calcium and eGFR. In\ncontrast, high serum phosphorus was more common at lower\neGFR levels. Previous studies have reported this association\nand suggested that elevated phosphorus may be responsible for\nthe increased serum iPTH levels seen in stage 3 CKD (47). This\nis a difficult area to study, because high serum iPTH increases\nurinary phosphorus excretion. This was observed in the current\nstudy: Participants with higher serum iPTH had lower serum\nphosphorus levels. Nonetheless, a strong association between\neGFR and elevated serum iPTH remained present after adjust-\nment for serum calcium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D levels.\nThere are several potential explanations for this finding. Be-\ncause high serum iPTH increases urinary phosphorus excre-\ntion, adjustment for serum phosphorus may not fully capture\nthe etiology of elevated iPTH. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)2\nvita-\nmin D are likely to be reduced in participants with decreased\neGFR, because of reductions in nephron mass and 1--hydrox-\nvitamin D promotes\nparathyroid gland hyperplasia and increased PTH synthesis\n(48). Also, the accumulation of iPTH fragments occurs in par-\nD or PTH fragments precluding its investigation\nin the current study.\nAdditional limitations of the current study include its cross-\nsectional design. Prospective data are needed to estimate the\nTable 2.
