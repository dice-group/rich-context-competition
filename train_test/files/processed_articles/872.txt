    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This analysis addresses the question of biased selection into health mainte-\nnance organizations (HMOs) by using recent, nationally representative data from the Com-\nmunity Tracking Study (CTS) to compare the health status of nonelderly privately insured\npersons enrolled in HMO and non-HMO plans. Contrary to the conventional view that HMOs\nreceive favorable selection, we find among the privately insured that HMO enrollees are not\nhealthier and may be slightly less healthy. To help understand that result, we present evi-\ndence suggesting that other factors, including cost considerations, may be more important\nthan health when people are deciding whether to enroll in an HMO.\nMany point to the lower premiums often associated with health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs) to suggest that HMOs offer a way\nto help control rising U.S. health care costs. However, HMOs' ability to\ncontrol costs depends on how they achieve lower premiums. To the extent that\ntheir cost advantage is the result of favorable selection in enrollment rather than\nefficiencies in health care delivery and lower payments to providers, their poten-\ntial to serve as a remedy for high health care spending is limited.1 The conventional\nview, arising perhaps from a subset of prior studies or from assumptions about the\npreferences of people in poor health, seems to be that HMOs do enroll a generally\nlower-risk population. Although considerable evidence suggests that this is true\nfor the Medicare and Medicaid populations, there is only mixed evidence for the\nprivately insured--the majority of the insured population.2\nThis analysis investigates the question of biased selection in HMOs by using re-\ncent, nationally representative data from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)\nto compare the health status of nonelderly privately insured persons enrolled in\nHMO and non-HMO plans.3 Contrary to the conventional view about biased se-\nlection in HMOs overall, we do not find among the privately insured that HMO\nenrollees tend to be healthier than non-HMO enrollees.\nH M O E n r o l l e e s ' H e a l t h\nElizabethSchaeferisahealthresearchanalystandJamesReschovskyisaseniorhealthresearcherattheCenterfor\nStudyingHealthSystemChange,inWashington,D.C.\n\u00a92002 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We use the term biased selection to indicate that\none type of health insurance plan enrolls persons who on average are better or worse\nrisks than enrollees in other types of plans. In empirical analyses of biased selection,\nenrollee risk is typically approximated using a measure highly correlated with risk,\nsuch as health status or health care use.\nDespite the conventional view that HMOs receive favorable selection, there is\nno clear theoretical prediction about whether this actually occurs. For example, in\nthe hypothetical situation where everyone has a choice between HMO and\nnon-HMO options, people who are in worse health, and who therefore expect to\nhave many visits to health care providers, may prefer HMO plans because of their\ntypically lower per visit cost sharing.4 On the other hand, people in worse health\nmay place greater weight on maintaining established ties to particular providers,\nand so they may prefer non-HMO plans, which impose fewer or no restrictions on\nprovider visits. In addition, people in poor health may tend to avoid HMOs be-\ncause of commonly held beliefs that managed care plans provide worse quality of\ncare.5 Thus, either favorable or adverse selection may arise depending on how peo-\nple in poor health weigh lower cost sharing in HMOs against their restrictiveness\nand perhaps perceived lower quality.\nBiased selection could also arise from correlations between health status and\nother characteristics that are related to preferences between HMO and non-HMO\nplans. For example, older people may be less familiar with managed care or more\nlikely to have long-standing relationships with providers. Since older people also\ntend to be in worse health, non-HMOs could receive adverse selection simply be-\ncause their method of care delivery is especially appealing to this group. Similarly,\npeople with lower incomes may prefer HMOs because of the lower premiums and\ncost sharing, and therefore HMOs could receive adverse selection because of the\nfact that lower income is often associated with worse health.6\nAlthough it is commonly assumed that biased selection results from consumers'\nchoices among plans, not everyone has the same opportunity to exercise such a\nchoice.7 To address this, we investigate health status differences for three distinct\ngroups of privately insured persons with different plan-choice opportunities:\nthose in the individual market, those with employer-sponsored insurance and a\nchoice of HMO and non-HMO plans, and those with employer-sponsored insur-\nance but no choice. Biased selection is least likely to be observed in this last group,\nalthough it may still occur if workers select jobs on the basis of the type of health\nplan offered or if employers choose to offer HMO or non-HMO plans based in part\non workers' health status. Although this is not a formal analysis of consumer or\nemployer decision making, separate analysis of these three groups allows us a\nfuller understanding of the factors behind the overall health status differences be-\ntween HMO and non-HMO enrollees.\nn Previous research. There is a large literature that examines biased selection in\nHMOs, and others have already reviewed this literature in detail.8 Conventional\nD a t a W a t c h\n2 5 0 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Most\nof these studies analyze measures of health care use (from either before or after the\nenrollment choice was made, and sometimes represented by expenditures), and\nthey find that people with lower use tend to enroll in HMOs.10 However, those re-\nsults cannot necessarily be used to conclude that HMOs receive favorable selec-\ntion, for several reasons. First, the relationship between low utilization and choice\nof an HMO plan is not universal.11 In addition, many of these studies rely on mea-\nsures of health care use in the period prior to choosing a health plan, and there is\nevidence suggesting that such measures may tend to overstate the differences in\nuse between the plan types in subsequent periods because of regression to the\nmean.12 Lastly, because these studies use samples that come from only a few em-\nployers, the ability to generalize from the results is limited.\nAnother common approach to this topic is to use nationally representative sur-\nvey data and measures of health status.13 The studies using this approach find few\nstatistically significant health status differences between enrollees in HMOs and\nnon-HMOs, and those differences go in both directions, with some health status\nmeasures indicating that HMOs receive favorable selection and others indicating\nadverse selection. Our analysis is most similar to this set of studies.\nData And Methods\nn Data source. The data come from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)\n1998\u00ad99 Household Survey, a large nationally representative survey of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population that tracks changes in the health care system\nthrough periodic surveys and site visits.14 The survey collected data on approxi-\nterviews that included questions on health insurance coverage, sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, and health status.15\nn Population groups. This analysis uses a subsample of about 34,900 nonelderly\npersons with private health insurance coverage, of whom 54 percent were enrolled\nin HMOs and 46 percent in other types of plans. HMO enrollment is defined by the\nresponse to a question about whether the plan is an HMO.16 Thus, the sample of\nHMO enrollees is likely to include enrollees in point-of-service (POS) products,\nsince these are typically marketed as HMOs with a POS option. These enrollment\npercentages are in line with results from other surveys, which show approximately\n50 percent combined enrollment in POS and traditional HMO products.17\nWe analyze results separately for the following three groups: people with em-\nH M O E n r o l l e e s ' H e a l t h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

To define whether an HMO/non-HMO choice was available for\neach person, information is used on the health insurance plans offered by the em-\nployers of all adults in the person's family.\nn Health status measures. We used four health status measures to ensure that\nour results are robust. Each is an indicator of whether an enrollee's health status is\nbelow a certain threshold.18 Two indicators, overall poor physical health and poor\nmental health, are based on the physical and mental health summary scores from the\nSF-12, which are available only for adults.19 Poor physical health is identified by a\nphysical health summary score below the twentieth percentile for the general U.S.\npopulation, and poor mental health is defined analogously. The third measure indi-\ncates whether the respondent's self-assessed health status is fair or poor (as opposed\nto excellent, very good, or good). The final measure is the presence of any chronic\nconditions that are considered expensive to treat.20\nWe first present results for the prevalence of poor health status among HMO\nand non-HMO enrollees. Then, because health status is correlated with many ba-\nsic sociodemographic variables, we use logit models to estimate the independent\neffect of health on the probability of a person's being enrolled in an HMO.21 We\nshow the marginal effects from those logit models for the sample with employer-\nsponsored insurance and a choice between HMO and non-HMO plan types.\nLastly, we present HMO/non-HMO differences in attitudes about trading off lower\nout-of-pocket costs for health care against limitations on choice of providers.\nn Data limitations. Two data limitations should be noted. The first is that we\nare evaluating biased selection using measures of health status, which is only an in-\ndirect measure of risk and propensity to use services. The second is that these re-\nsults may be affected by misreporting of plan type by household survey respon-\ndents.22 However, such misreporting would affect our results only if its direction\nvaried by health status, and our analysis of additional data in which plan type is\nidentified by health plans indicates that misreporting has not affected our results.23\nStudy Results\nn Health status and plan type. Among the privately insured, HMOs do not re-\nceive favorable selection (Exhibit 1). Although the differences are not large, HMOs\nhave a higher percentage of enrollees in poor health for three of the four health status\nmeasures. The recent growth in HMOs with a POS option providing at least some\nout-of-network coverage raises the possibility that favorable selection in traditional\nHMOs is being obscured by adverse selection in the less-restrictive POS products.\nAlthough the data used in this analysis cannot address that question, a supplement\nto an earlier year of these data can, and it shows no evidence of health status differ-\nences between POS-model and traditional HMOs.24\nD a t a W a t c h\n2 5 2 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We might expect biased selection primarily among the sub-\nsamples of individually insured and people with employer coverage and a choice of\nplan types, because for them plan type can most directly reflect enrollees' prefer-\nences. In fact, none of the health status differences for those two subsamples is\nstatistically significant. The remaining subsample of those with employer-spon-\nsored insurance but no choice of plan types does have significant differences, but\nthere is no compelling interpretation for that, because only two differences are\nsignificant and the magnitudes are not large. Therefore, at least according to these\nsimple descriptive results, it appears that enrollees' health status is not strongly\nrelated to choice of plans.\nn Health status and plan type, controlling for other factors. To explore these\ndescriptive results, we use multivariate analysis to estimate the independent effect\nof health on the probability of HMO enrollment for the full sample of adults, con-\nH M O E n r o l l e e s ' H e a l t h\nHealth Status Of Nonelderly Persons With Private Insurance, By Type Of Health\nPercent within each plan type HMO/non-HMO percentage-\npoint difference\nHealth status measure HMO Non-HMO\nAll privately insured\nPoor physical health\nPoor mental health\nSelf-assessed health fair or poor\nAny expensive chronic condition\nEmployer-sponsored, with choicea\nPoor physical health\nPoor mental health\nSelf-assessed health fair or poor\nAny expensive chronic condition\nEmployer-sponsored, no choicea\nPoor physical health\nPoor mental health\nSelf-assessed health fair or poor\nAny expensive chronic condition\nIndividual purchase\nPoor physical health\nPoor mental health\nSelf-assessed health fair or poor\nAny expensive chronic condition\nNOTES: The physical and mental health scores are not defined for children, so those percentages were calculated among adults\nand 2,341 for people with insurance purchased directly.

However, other factors did. For exam-\nple, age had a significant negative effect, which could reflect the fact that older\npeople are less familiar with HMOs. Income also had a significant negative effect,\nwhich supports the notion that those with lower incomes are attracted to HMOs'\nlower cost-sharing requirements. Overall, for this sample, the lack of large signifi-\ncant effects of any of the measures of health status, combined with the significant\neffects of income, suggests that nonelderly people with private insurance put more\nweight on cost considerations than on health status when choosing coverage.\nWe also tried including interactions between the health and income variables\nin the basic model shown in Exhibit 2, to investigate whether health effects might\nexist only at certain income levels (results not shown). In particular, people with\nhigher incomes may be the only ones who can afford to take their health status\ninto consideration when choosing a health plan. Our results, however, provide no\nevidence that the effect of health on the probability of HMO enrollment varies at\ndifferent levels of income.\nn Choice of providers versus lower costs.

This is not surprising, since one of the most basic features of HMOs is\nto lower costs by restricting choice of providers. The fact that the differences be-\ntween HMO and non-HMO enrollees are more pronounced for people with a choice\nof plan types than for those without reinforces our finding that cost considerations\ncan be an important factor in HMO enrollment decisions.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis has found little biased selection in HMOs among the privately in-\nsured, with HMOs tending to have slightly more enrollees in poor health. This re-\nsult is contrary to the conventional wisdom that HMOs receive favorable selec-\ntion, although it is generally consistent with other similar studies. To the extent\nthat health status represents risk, these studies in aggregate, based on data span-\nning 1977 through 1998, suggest that HMOs have not been receiving favorable selec-\ntion among their nonelderly enrollees for quite some time, if in fact they ever did.\nThese results make a noteworthy contribution to the literature on biased selec-\ntion in HMOs. First, our measure of choice captures all employer coverage avail-\nable through the family instead of just what is available from a person's own em-\nployer, and we use this information to identify that segment of the population\namong which biased selection is most likely to be observed. In addition, we have\ndirect information on attitudes about trading off more limited provider choice for\nlower out-of-pocket spending, which confirms our multivariate results indicating\nthat cost plays an important role in the HMO enrollment decision. Lastly, the use\nof timely data in this analysis is important, since many recent developments in the\nhealth insurance market could have affected biased selection among the privately\ninsured, such as the growth in HMO enrollment, changes in employers' health in-\nsurance offerings, and changes in managed care products.26\nOur results imply that, at least for the privately insured, lower HMO costs can-\nnot be attributed simply to enrollment of a healthier population. Rather, at least\nsome of HMOs' cost advantages are likely attributable to lower utilization associ-\nated with care management tools or to lower fees paid to providers.\nOur results also suggest that factors other than health status play a role in peo-\nple's decisions about whether to enroll in an HMO. In particular, our finding of in-\ncome's strong negative effect on HMO enrollment decisions suggests that people\nare influenced by HMOs' lower costs. This is reinforced by our finding that HMO\nenrollees express a much greater willingness to benefit from lower out-of-pocket\ncosts in exchange for having restrictions on their choice of providers. Age also ap-\npears to be important in HMO enrollment, most likely reflecting older people's\nlack of familiarity with HMOs. Together these results suggest that HMOs' ability\nto attract better risks because of older people's unfamiliarity with them is offset by\ntheir appeal to those with lower incomes, who tend to be worse risks.\nThe effectiveness of HMOs in reducing costs for consumers and the importance\nD a t a W a t c h\n2 5 6 H E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

During that pe-\nriod, consumers' and policymakers' complaints focused on the restrictions im-\nposed by managed care plans, although as our data show, some people neverthe-\nless still continued to choose HMOs because of their lower costs. However, we are\nnow seeing a weaker economy and looser labor markets, along with larger in-\ncreases in premiums. In this environment employers are far more likely to pass on\ncost increases to their employees. As the privately insured once again face large\npremium increases, our results suggest that cost may return to the forefront\namong the complaints of privately insured consumers. This possibility should not\nbe forgotten in discussions about managed care regulations that may greatly in-\ncrease costs or restrict consumers' choice of health plan features. If the ultimate ef-\nfect of such regulations is to reduce or eliminate some lower-cost health insurance\noptions, they may not be entirely welcome to all consumers.\nTheCommunityTrackingStudyisfundedbytheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation.TheauthorsthankLeifKarell\nofSocialandScientificSystemsforexcellentprogrammingassistanceandPaulGinsburg,AnnGreiner,Joy\nGrossman,JackHadley,LeeHargraves,andPeterKemperforhelpfulcommentsonanearlierversionofthispaper.\nNOTES\n1.
