We analyzed data from the National Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hos-\npital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) be-\nprescribing for acute sinusitis in adults. We estimated the\nannual number of acute sinusitis visits per 1000 adults\nin the United States. Acute sinusitis was designated for\nvisits in which any of 3 diagnosis fields contained the In-\nternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clini-\ncal Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for acute sinusitis\n(461.x). We excluded visits for acute sinusitis that had\nconcomitant diagnoses that could potentially require an-\ntibiotics (eg, urinary tract infections) and visits that re-\nsulted in hospital admission. We also excluded visits\nwhere an aminoglycoside or vancomycin was pre-\nscribed, since those patients were presumed to have more\nserious or atypical infections.\nIn analyses of antibiotic selection, we restricted our\nsample to those visits where acute sinusitis was the pri-\nmary diagnosis. The primary outcome measures were the\nproportion of visits for acute sinusitis in which any an-\ntibiotic was prescribed (antibiotic visits) and the pro-\nportion of antibiotic visits in which amoxicillin was\nprescribed.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using STATA\n11 software (StataCorp) and accounted for the compo-\nnents of the complex survey design. For analysis of time\ntrends, we grouped the survey data and census denomi-\nnators in five 2-year intervals as recommended by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics.\n0.5%) of all outpatient visits among adults during this\nperiod.

In addition,\nthere were no changes in the overall rates of prescribing\nfor any specific antibiotic class or antibiotic agent among\nvisits (n=1934) where an antibiotic was prescribed.

In the present study, using a nationally rep-\nresentative data set of ambulatory visits, we found that\nmore than 80% of patients diagnosed as having acute si-\nnusitis receive an antibiotic, despite mounting evidence\nthat the benefits of antibiotic treatment for sinusitis are\nlimited. Furthermore, we found that nearly 50% of pa-\ntients diagnosed as having acute sinusitis received either\na macrolide or a quinolone, while fewer than 20% re-\nceived amoxicillin, the recommended first-line treat-\nment during the study period. The frequent use of mac-\nrolides, as shown in this study, is particularly concerning\nbecause macrolide use has been associated with treat-\nment failures for respiratory tract infections.8 Although\nlikely to be effective, fluoroquinolones are usually un-\nnecessary for sinusitis, and overuse is an important risk\nfactor for colonization and infection with resistant\norganisms.9\nAntibiotic Selected, %\nAmoxicillin\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate\nMacrolides\nQuinolones\nSecond-/third-generation\ncephalosporins\nFigure.

Among this cohort, 60% believed that hyper-\nglycemia at the time of PCI is harmful, and 94% be-\nlieved that hypoglycemia at the time of PCI is harmful.\nAlthough most clinicians routinely hold oral hypogly-\ncemic medications prior to angiography, substantial num-\nbers do not, with nearly half routinely continuing thiazo-\nlidinediones on the morning of coronary angiography\n(Table). Clinicians are more likely to continue insulin-\nbased regimens than oral medications, but again there is\nnouniformityofpractice.InpatientswithuncontrolledDM\n(glycosylatedhemoglobinlevel10%orbloodglucoselev-\nels 200 mg/dL), a little more than one-third of physi-\ncians reported they would change their usual practice and\ncontinue hypoglycemic medications prior to coronary an-\ngiography.
