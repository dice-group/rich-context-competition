    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn 1980s and 1990s, Australian trade unions tried to combat declining influence and membership numbers by amalgamating\nwith other unions in the same or related industries. Much has been written on union mergers, but little on how these affect\nthe membership. This article aims to contribute to the literature of the impact of mergers and amalgamations on members\nbut studying just one union, The West Australian Locomotive Engine Drivers, Firemen's and Cleaners Union (LEDU; 1898-\n1999). In 1993, the three federal railway unions--the Australian Railways Union (ARU), the Australian Federated Union of\nLocomotive Employees (AFULE), and the National Union of Railworkers (NUR), and one bus and tram union, the Australian\nTramway & Motor Omnibus Employees Association (ATM)--amalgamated to become the Australian Rail Tram and Bus\nIndustry Union (RTBU). The LEDU reluctantly joined the RTBU in 1999. This article examines rank and file reaction to the\ninitial proposals and ultimately to becoming part of a larger union, covering workers with many different interests. The article\nconcludes that, irrespective of whether or not amalgamation was inevitable, given the circumstances in Western Australia at\nthe time, its impact upon the rank and file membership was devastating.\n",

This question, and a subsequent one,\n\"How do union mergers affect the members?\" have occu-\npied my mind ever since one of my students chose to exam-\nine the impact on the membership of the Printing and\nKindred Industries Union (PKIU) when it amalgamated\nwith the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union\n(AMWU) in Western Australia in the early 1990s (Moy,\nbeen written about union amalgamation in Australia, espe-\ncially with regard to the federal peak body, the Australian\nCouncil of Trade Unions' (ACTU) strategy of creating so-\ncalled \"super unions\" in the 1980s. Much less has been\nwritten on the impacts upon membership. Using the exam-\nple of the amalgamation of the railway and tram workers'\nunions in Australia in 1993, and a methodology employing\nworker interviews and historical archives including union\ncorrespondence, this article considers the impact of amal-\ngamation on the rank and file membership of the West\nAustralian Locomotive Engine Drivers, Firemen's and\nCleaners Union (henceforth LEDU). Secondary historical\nand industrial relations literature, including the author's\npublished work, will be used to draw comparisons with\nother Australian and British unions.\nThe LEDU, founded in 1898, covered employees who\nwere known in the railway industry as footplate staff--ini-\ntially the drivers, firemen, and cleaners of steam locomotives,\nbut later the drivers and assistant drivers on diesel engines.\nThese men saw themselves as having different working con-\nditions and interests from other railway staff such as guards,\nsignalmen, porters, and ticket collectors. This perceived dif-\nference was even more acute when comparing themselves\nwith inspectors and stationmasters (seen as being \"bosses\"),\nwho were members of the Railway Officers' Union (ROU;\nof being railwaymen--and engine drivers in particular. Given\nthat these men saw themselves as an elite, with different inter-\nests even from other railway staff, how did they react when,\nin its centenary year, their union merged with members\nof rival unions, who had not earned the particular mystique of\nbeing footplate men?

It involved\naccessing several hundred LEDU files (now part of the\nTransport Workers Union collection) in the State Library of\nWestern Australia and the records of WA Government\nRailways (later Westrail) in the State Records Office of\nWestern Australia. For the purposes of this article, the most\nrelevant records were correspondence files and minutes of\ntion. Comparative British material was researched in the\nrecords of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers\nand Firemen (ASLEF) lodged at the Modern Records Centre,\nUniversity of Warwick, UK.\nTo access the opinions of the rank and file, I drew upon the\nother interviews in the oral history collection of the J.S.\nBattye Library of West Australian History (part of the State\nLibrary of Western Australia), as well as secondary literature.\nOnly some of the men whom I interviewed commented on\nunion amalgamation; some had retired before this occurred,\nor had moved into other work and were no longer LEDU\nmembers. Interviewees included a former State Secretary of\nthe union, a former branch secretary, and the State Secretary\nof the Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union (RTBU),\nthe union with which the LEDU merged in 1999. Those who\ncommented on amalgamation expressed strong opinions\nabout whether the move benefited the membership.\nThe Literature on Union\nAmalgamations\nUnfortunately, union historians have often dealt briefly, if\nat all, with the impact of amalgamation on the rank and file.\nOf members' attitudes to the newly formed AMWU, for\nexample, Sheridan (1975) devoted only a few lines, when\nhe wrote, at the end of his history of the Amalgamated\nEngineering Union (AEU):\nWhile many members no doubt experienced a twinge of regret\nfor the final passing of the old order, AEU activists now felt\nmuch better equipped to cope with the new era of industrial\nrelations ushered in by contemporary radical changes in the\narbitration and bargaining areas and the appearance in Canberra\nof the first Labor government in 23 years. (p. 304)\nHence, the power that amalgamation gave to the newAMWU,\naccording to Sheridan, outweighed sentiment. Similarly Peter\nO'Connor (2005), discussing the merger that created the Rail,\nTram, and Bus Union in New South Wales, wrote that the new\nunion was a \"sensible grouping of rail unions\" which created\n\"a strong industry union that could serve each of their tradi-\ntional constituents from a stronger bargaining position\"\n(p. 86). This merger undoubtedly had more chance of success\nas all of the unions involved represented road or rail transport\nindustry workers, yet it contained the Australian Federated\nUnion of Locomotive Employees (AFULE), who--like the\nLEDU--had formerly resisted all attempts to merge with the\nARU. The problem of accommodating multiple interests\nbecame even more complex within unions such as theAMWU,\nwhich now covers a wide range of employees including those\nin the metal working, vehicle and ship building, plumbing, and\nfood and printing industries (Reeves & Dettmer, 2013).\nMost studies of union amalgamation are concerned with\nwhether the strategy succeeded in increasing union power,\nenabling economies through more efficient use of resources,\nand achieving improved wages and conditions for members\nWooden, 1999). Some have considered how individual\nunions have resisted amalgamation (e.g., Michelson, 1997;\nOliver, 2016). At least two studies have addressed the spe-\ncific issue of the impact upon the rank and file. As mentioned\nin this article's \"Introduction\" section, Sverke et al. (2004)\nraised the important question of the impact of union mergers\non members. To ascertain how a merger affected union rank\nand file of two blue-collar unions in Sweden, Sverke et al.\nWorkers' members prior to, shortly after, and then 2 years\nafter the event. The rationale for the merger included finan-\ncial necessity and the need to operate more efficiently, but,\nmore importantly, it was influenced by a desire to improve\n\"lower-level representational structures\" and create a flatter\nstructure to \"increase the closeness between the members\nand their union.\" Thus the aim of the merger, rather than to\n\"absorb\" a smaller union into a larger one, was to create a\ncompletely new union covering clothing and factory workers\nbership commitment, satisfaction and participation do not\nnecessarily have to be sacrificed for the benefit of building\nlarger, more stable and powerful unions through mergers\"\nabsence of negative consequences of the merger can be\ntraced to how and why the merger was proposed and negoti-\nated. The merger brought about more member participation\nat the local level and decentralized decision making\" (Sverke\nunions discussed in this article, and especially not in the\nLEDU that is the subject of the case study.\nRegarding the amalgamation of the PKIU with theAMWU\nofficials whom she interviewed to retain a printing division\nwithin the larger union. Factors affecting railway employees\nhad also impacted upon the printing industry. Just as in the\nrailways, printers had ceased to operate in a closed shop, and\ndeclining numbers--which had dropped from 51,000 mem-\nvided a major impetus for amalgamation (Moy, 2008).\nConsequently, despite fears of the printers'identity being sub-\nmerged in the culture of the metal workers who dominated the\nAMWU, amalgamation was regarded as being the only viable\nsolution for the PKIU. It has retained a separate identity as the\nAMWU Printing Division, although at least one of the inter-\nviewees in Moy's study did not think that this had been\nentirely successful. Unlike my study of the LEDU, however,\nMoy's study did not canvas the views of the rank and file\nmembership of printers.\nWhy Did Australian Unions\nAmalgamate?\nAustralian trade unions developed sometimes in parallel,\nsometimes in advance of their counterparts in Britain (Kirk,\ncenturies, grew stronger, and flourished mid-century, when\nmore than 50% of the workforce was unionized and declined\ngaining the right to present their members was the institution\nof State and Federal Arbitration Courts (Kirk, 2011), where\nunions were registered, at the beginning of the 20th century.\nWestern Australia was the first Australian state to adopt the\narbitration system, passing legislation in 1900 that established\nthe Arbitration Court prior to Australian Federation. New\nremaining states followed suit, although Victoria, Tasmania,\nand initially South Australia adopted a less judicial system of\nwages boards. Wages boards differed chiefly in their compo-\nsition and procedures. They were composed of representa-\ntives of employers and employees with an independent\nchairperson, and they could act without the formal require-\nment of a dispute. Unions, however, preferred an arbitration\nsystem, which granted them official recognition as represen-\ntatives of their members and permitted preference for union\nmembers in employment. Eventually the mechanisms of the\nDespite British and American workers' suspicions that a\ncompulsory arbitration system would favor employers\n(Oliver, 2016), in Australia, the reverse was true, nowhere\nquite so evidently as in Western Australia, where legislation\nhad to be passed to legalize trade unions before they could be\nregistered as partners in the industrial wage system. But the\nsystem also placed restrictions on union rules and conduct.\nOriginally, unions that chose the path of strike action were\nnotpermittedtoappearintheArbitrationCourt.Consequently,\nmilitants regarded arbitration as a \"sham,\" while employers,\non the contrary, wanted the Court to impose penalties on\nstrikers (Macintyre, 2005). On occasions this resulted in a\nunion being de-registered, as happened to the LEDU briefly\nThe British concept of a \"closed shop\"--a workplace\nwhere all employees must belong to a union--flourished in\nAustralian factories and workshops. Thus, not only was a\nmajority of workers unionized, but there were also many dif-\nferent unions, often operating only at the state or local level,\neven in government-owned facilities such as railway work-\nshops. The Western Australian Government Railway\n(WAGR) Workshops at Midland in Western Australia pro-\nvides just one example of the proliferation and then reduc-\ntion of the number of unions on a worksite. In the early to\nmid-20th century, two separate, rival unions covered engi-\nneers, and the trades of molder, boilermaker, blacksmith, car\nand wagon builder, coachbuilder, painter, plumber, carpen-\nter, coppersmith, and electrician each had its own union.\nThere was also a \"catch all\" government railway employees\nunion--the Western Australian Amalgamated Society of\nRailway Employees (WAASRE)--which included unskilled\nlaborers in its coverage. The impact of amalgamation was\nsuch that by the time the Workshops closed in 1994, only\nfour unions covered all of the trades and the clerical staff on\nSeveral factors caused this decrease in union numbers.\nAccording to Sheridan (1975), metal workers' unions were\nworking toward amalgamation from the late 1950s. Reasons\nfor this included technological changes (which resulted in\nthe disappearance of some trades, such as boilermakers),\njoint union efforts to achieve outcomes at arbitration tribu-\nnals, and an increased feeling of solidarity brought about by\nboth the tribunals' use of penal powers and the increasing\nimportance of shop committees consisting of representatives\nfrom kindred unions within a workplace. In the late 1960s,\nchanges to the wage system sparked industrial stoppages,\nand a growing perception that employers were becoming\nmore powerful provided further impetus for unions to con-\nsider amalgamation as a strategy for increasing their bargain-\ning power.\nA catalyst for the union amalgamations that occurred in the\niron ore mining industry, which commenced in the Pilbara\nregion during the 1960s. Union officials visiting mine sites\nfound poor conditions, a largely unorganized, non-unionized\nworkforce and multi-national employers with very hostile atti-\ntudes to unionism. Amalgamation, therefore, was a strategy\nfor increasing union strength and resources in an adversarial\nenvironment. The first amalgamation to affect the railway\nindustry was that of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (separate\nunions who had combined in one Society in 1966), and the\nAEU to form the AMWU in 1971. These unions represented\nseveral trades in the railway workshops but not members of\nunions covering ship builders and painters, waterside workers,\nand watchmen formed the MaritimeWorkers Union ofWestern\nAustralia (Oliver, 2003). Although this merger was limited to\nWestern Australia, this union later joined with the nation-wide\nMaritime Union ofAustralia (MUA), formed in 1993 from the\n4 SAGE Open\nWaterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union\n(Kirkby, 2008). The WAASRE joined with its federal counter-\npart to become the Australian Railways Union (ARU), WA\nBranch, in the 1970s. The ARU had been in existence in the\nWhereas the amalgamations of the late 1960s and early\n1970s had been instigated by the challenge of meeting indus-\ntrial changes in the mining industry and perceptions of\nincreased employer power, those of 20 years later were\nbrought about by an environment in which, by the beginning\n1988\" and trade unions were \"fighting for their very survival\nin the face of industrial and economic reorganization\" and\n\"legal and political onslaughts on the conditions of work and\nSeveral factors contributed to this decline. Computerized\nsystems replaced much manual labor. Railways, in a period\nof three or four decades, had passed from very labor inten-\nsive steam, through dieselization to a mix of diesel and elec-\ntric. Trades such as blacksmiths and carriage makers\ndisappeared when fiberglass and aluminum replaced wood\nas the material for building carriages and wagons (Fox,\n2006). The proportion of private industry (often with non-\nunionized workforces) increased, and governments began\noutsourcing contracts to private manufacturers, resulting in\nthe closure of government railway workshops at Ipswich\n(Queensland) Eveleigh (NSW), Launceston (Tasmania), and\nMidland (WA) in the last two decades of the 20th century\nunderwent considerable demographic change, caused by an\nincreased proportion of white-collar occupations, which are\ntraditionally less organized.\nPerhaps more significant than all of these changes, how-\never, were the legislative changes instituted by Federal Labor\ngovernments at the beginning of the 1990s, which permitted\nsingle-employer agreements (enterprise bargaining) and\nnon-union agreements. The resulting \"fragmentation of bar-\ngaining practices . . . eroded the capacity of the ACTU to\ncoordinate unions in the bargaining sector\" because it had\nlost the \"bargaining power to negotiate enterprise agree-\nthe way Australian society viewed unions. John Howard\nthat strong unions threatened Australia's economic perfor-\nmance, rather than playing a beneficial role in the commu-\nnity. Blame has also been leveled at unions themselves.\nAccording to Michael Crosby (2005), unions had grown\ncomplacent, partly because mid-century, they had enjoyed a\nworkforce density of 63%. There was increasing disquiet\namong the rank and file that their officials struck too many\n\"deals . . . with the boss,\" and these did not always benefit\nthe membership.\nAnother motivation for amalgamation arose from the fear\nthat what was happening to New Zealand unions would soon\noccur in Australia. Crosby argued that Australian companies,\nincluding the major banks, used New Zealand to test de-\nunionization strategies before attempting them in Australia.\nHe asserted that New Zealand's Employment Workplace\nRelations Act 1991 influenced the design of Australia's\nWorkplace Relations Act, 1996, and that the survival of\nAustralian unions was \"intimately linked with the survival of\nIn summary, then, Australian unions benefited from their\nintegral role within arbitration and tariff systems that pro-\ntected employers from outside competition. Their high mem-\nbership density, achieved through successfully negotiating\ngains for their rank and file within the organized structure of\narbitration, enabled to them to hold a privileged position in\nAustralian society. Traditionally, the union movement had\npaid little attention to industries with a high proportion of\nfemale workers when these were a minority in the workforce.\nThis complacency, combined with external circumstances\nincluding the numerical decline of the traditional union\nheartland--the industrial, highly skilled blue-collar work-\nforce; the increase of non-organized occupations such as\nhospitality; and the de-regulation of the industrial relations\nsystem led to a reduction in union membership numbers and\ndensity in the workforce. In the last two decades of the 20th\ncentury, government policies from both sides of politics\nfavored the privatizing of industries, and gave employers\nfreedom to hire non-unionized workers and broker non-\nunion agreements and employees the right to choose whether\nor not they would join a union. With the era of the closed\nshop well and truly passed in Australia, some claimed that\nunions were facing oblivion (Crosby, 2005), although other\ncommentators regarded the \"end-of-unionism-as-a-move-\nment thesis\" as being \"over-simplified, over-generalised and\nenvironment, some saw \"super unions\"--a strategy proposed\nby the ACTU in the 1980s--as the only viable means of sur-\nvival. With unions perceiving threats to their very existence,\nit is likely that what the rank and file wanted was a secondary\nconsideration.\nCase Study: The LEDU\nIn Western Australia for much of the 20th century, the two\nmain unions for railway staff were the LEDU, representing\nall footplate staff and engine cleaners, and the WAASRE,\nwhich covered all other wage-earning railway staff (such as\nguards, porters, crane and forklift drivers, trades assistants,\nand unskilled laborers). The much smaller ROU repre-\nsented railways clerical staff, stationmasters, and inspec-\ntors. To give some idea of the comparative sizes of these\nunions in their heyday, figures published in August 1948,\nwhen the population of Western Australia was a little more\nthan half a million (Caldwell, 1988), show that the\nWAASRE registered almost 5,000 workers--being the sec-\nond largest union in Western Australia, after the Australian\nWorkers' Union, which had over 10,000 members. In com-\nparison, the LEDU mustered fewer than 1,500 members\nin the 1970s, the WAASRE amalgamated with its Eastern\nStates counterpart, the ARU.\nOfficials of the LEDU had begun considering amalgama-\ntion in the late 1970s after membership declined, but rather\nthan negotiating with the ARU--which (despite the per-\nceived differences mentioned earlier in this article) at least\ncovered other railway workers in the traffic branch--the\nunion began talks with theAMWU.Approaching theAMWU\n(then titled the Australian Metal Workers Union) was an\ninteresting move, given the union's steadfast refusal to join\nwith WAASRE on several earlier occasions when that union\nhad made overtures; however, as the AMWU covered former\nAEU, boilermakers', and blacksmiths' members, and was a\nmilitant union, ideological similarity may provide the key to\nunderstanding it. Historically, all of these unions were more\nmilitant than the ARU, and they had supported the LEDU\nYet LEDU members were keen to maintain a separate\nidentity if a merger occurred. They belonged to the\nAFULE, forming the WA Branch of the Federal body, but\nthis was a loose knit, semi-autonomous federation of State\nbranches. The fact that the WA union--alone of all those\nthat entered into the AFULE in 1921--kept its original\nname indicates the strong desire to retain independence.\nAccording to LEDU official Jack Bainbridge (Oral history\ninterview, State Library of Western Australia [SLWA]\nwere prepared to amalgamate \"on the condition that we\ncan retain our identity\" (p. 23). He said that members of\nmany years standing were proud of being enginemen and\nthey did not want to just become part of a larger union.\nThus, he felt that maintaining their \"identity\" was very\nimportant to the members.\nIn 1983, in the Eastern States, theAFULE began talks with\nthe ARU, with a view to forming one union of railway work-\ners (Ellercamp, 1983). The LEDU opposed the amalgamation\nplans, in particular because, according to Des McPolin (the\ntion discussions had been arranged without adequate consul-\ntation. McPolin warned that if talks continued before all of\nthe Divisions had been consulted and given a full opportunity\nto discuss the proposal, the WADivision would prefer to enter\ninto amalgamation discussions with other Western Australian\nunions, with whom it felt it had more in common. McPolin\n(1987) expressed similar sentiments to AFULE General\nPresident Ron Bradford as those of Jack Bainbridge, quoted\nearlier. He wrote that locomotive enginemen were \"a proud\nbreed of workers\" who would not be intimidated by the\nACTU or the AFULE. Clearly, he felt that the union's rank\nand file had a strong desire to maintain a separate identity\nwithin a larger union of transport workers, with whom foot-\nplate staff would share some common concerns.\nDespite these differences, however, a 1991 LEDUWorking\nParty Report on a proposed amalgamation of themselves with\nthe ARU and the Amalgamated Tramways and Motor\nOmnibus Employees'Association (ATM) indicated that many\npractical issues such as relocation of office staff and officials\nwould not present major difficulties. Yet there were some\ncomplications. The ARU and the LEDU were State regis-\ntered, while ATM was registered federally. It is significant\nthat members of ATM, the smallest and least well resourced\nof the three, feared monopoly by the larger railway unions.\nSome members objected to the union disposing of property\nthat had been acquired with contributions from the rank and\nfile. The loss of such assets was equated with a loss of union\nidentity and possibly also the loyalty that most members felt\ntoward their union (LEDU, 1991). Despite the optimism in\nthe 1991 Working Party report, the LEDU again reneged on\namalgamation, leaving the other two parties to create the\nAustralian RTBU (n.d.). The LEDU continued to seek a\nmerger with other WA unions.\nnot to amalgamate, approximately 1,250 employees took\nvoluntary redundancy, leaving the union leadership fearing\nthat their union would be no longer viable (McPolin, 1994).\nOther members decided individually to make the decision\nthat had been denied them en masse by joining the RTBU.\nYet other drivers left the government railway service\n(Westrail) and joined the Commonwealth system (National\nRail), which meant transferring union membership to the\nfederal union, the Australian RTBU (R. Bergsma, interview\nIn 1996, in controversial and divisive circumstances (Oliver,\n2016), the union elected a new President, David Hathaway,\nwho strongly opposed amalgamation with the RTBU.\nHathaway stated that the union must continue to resist amal-\ngamating with either the RTBU or the Australian Services\nUnion (ASU; \"the old Right Wing Clerks'Union\" as he termed\nit). They should \"hold together as enginemen\" but, if amalga-\nmation became a necessary, it would be better to \"look to a\nrespectable blue collar Union\" (Hathaway, 1996). Despite the\nstrong feelings against the ASU, the LEDU's Executive signed\na Memorandum of Understanding with this union in 1997. This\nmove did not please some of the membership, who objected\nthat railway officers \"are not Enginemen's friends,\" and they\ncirculated a petition in September 1997 to reconsider the issue\nof amalgamation with the RTBU (LEDU, 1997). The ASU\nincluded in its coverage members of the former ROU. In this\nparticular instance, therefore, the strength of membership opin-\nion against the ASU influenced the direction the union's offi-\ncials chose to take.\nBy this time, the State had experienced 4\u00bd years of\nindustrial reform by the Liberal-National coalition govern-\nment of Premier Richard Court. The legislation replaced\nexisting award structures and centralized bargaining with\nindividual workplace agreements, some of which offered\nonly the most basic working conditions, curtailed workers'\n6 SAGE Open\nright to claim entitlements under the Workers'Compensation\nAct, and eroded safety requirements (Oliver, 2003). Westrail\nembarked on stringent rationalization measures to reduce\nstaff numbers and undermine working conditions as well as\nputting workers' safety at risk, according to the Union.\nSome members were pressured to sign individual workplace\nagreements. It became clear that the LEDU could not pre-\nvent the loss of conditions that had \"taken 100 years to gain\"\nIn mid 1998, the LEDU's centenary year, which should\nhave been a year of celebration, the membership voted on the\nmatter of \"harmonization\" of the LEDU and the RTBU. Only\n360 ballot papers were issued, indicating that the member-\ncompleted ballots returned, over two thirds voted in favor of\namalgamation--but what of the more than one third of the\nmembership who did not bother to vote? Did they believe\nthat the result was a foregone conclusion and that their opin-\nion made no difference? The evidence from the union's files\nis that former officials blamed the President, Hathaway, for\nunder mining the union's capacity to advocate strongly on\nbehalf of its members (e.g., Jarratt to Hathaway, 1997; Jarrett\nto Hathaway, 1997). Hathaway, however, criticized the\nbranches for not giving the General Committee any guidance\nor making their wishes known (Hathaway, 1997). The author\ninterviewed 22 former union members when researching the\nunion's history (Oliver, 2016). Not all expressed opinions\nabout the amalgamation, but some blamed the union's demise\non the division between officials in the Executive, especially\nHathaway, McPolin, and former Secretary Les Young. One\nsaid that joining the RTBU was \"the worst thing they did\" (J.\nanother that the officials' \"putting the union down\" weak-\nened its capacity to survive (V. Charushenko, interview with\nThe new union, theAustralian Rail,Tram and Bus Industrial\nUnion of Workers (WA Branch), was registered in the State\nLEDU rank and file feared that they would become a small,\nneglected group within a union that now had responsibility for\nmost public transport drivers. Their fears were not unfounded.\nFrom 2006, rail car drivers (many of whom were former\nLEDU members) were placed under a different award from\nTransWA drivers, which resulted in their receiving only about\n75% of the pay of their colleagues. They felt abandoned by the\nunion but powerless to do anything. Paul Robinson, himself a\nrail car driver, rectified this anomaly after he became State\nSecretary of the RTBU (P. Robinson, interview with the\nauthor, February 28, 2014). This incident indicates the need\nfor officials in \"super unions\" to be vigilant about the needs of\nall of their members, not just those from their own trade or\nsection. In summary, the evidence suggests that the amalga-\nmation of the LEDU with the RTBU, while it may have ben-\nefited members in creating a viable union, was accompanied\nby considerable bitterness, recrimination, and regret.\nConclusion\nThis article has not set out to draw conclusions about the full\nextent of the impact of amalgamation on union rank and file\nmembership, which would be impossible with just one case\nstudy. Rather, with the other contributions surveyed here, it\naims to begin to establish a literature of the ways that union\namalgamations do affect rank and file members, whether for\nwell or ill. In the case of the LEDU, it is difficult to ascertain\nthe extent to which becoming a mere division in a larger\nunion undermines the culture of being enginemen, because\nthat is not the only factor that has come into play. At least two\nother factors are significant in the WesternAustralian context.\nFirst, the large-scale privatization of industry has introduced\nan aggressively anti-union culture into the rail industry, par-\nticularly from international companies such as Genesee &\nWyoming Inc.Australia (Oliver, 2014). Second, the system of\ntraining engine drivers has changed significantly. Under the\nWAGR/Westrail system, employees might take 20 years to\nachieve the status of driver, so, not surprisingly it was sought\nafter, valued, and proudly held. Today, a person from a non-\nrailway background can be trained to be rail car driver in 6\nmonths (N. Little, interview with the author, December 12,\nwith generations who worked for the WAGR has vanished.\nOf the two WA unions compared in this article, the PKIU\nmembers appear to have had a much clearer idea about the\nbenefits that could be accessed by belonging to a numerically\nand politically powerful union. Moy (2008) found that both\nofficials and members saw advantages in \"economies of\nscale\" (p. 25), legal resources, and bargaining power.\nNegative effects, such as a fall in recruitment, have to be\nseen in the light of the fact that most of the post-amalgama-\ntion study has fallen either within the tenure of the Howard\nunions experienced the most sustained attacks since the\n1920s, or that of its conservative Labor successors, Rudd\nminority government dependent upon the support of\nIndependent members and the Australian Greens. The arbi-\ntration system (which was once claimed to benefit the\nworker) was completely re-shaped to re-emerge, in the post-\nHoward era, as the Fair Work Commission--a body that\nplaces considerable limitations upon what constitutes legal\nunion activity. The extent to which these changes impacted\nnegatively on union numbers and density in workforce is still\nbeing determined (see, for example, Oliver, 2014).\nIncreasing membership numbers would be one indicator\nthat unions have regained the confidence of workers in the\nindustries that they cover, but accessing reliable figures,\neven from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, appears to\nbe very difficult. Recent observations state that the per-\ncentage of unionized workers in Western Australia rose\nFalling,\" 2014). Evidently, larger unions have a greater\ncapacity to offer services to members and provide more\nadequate legal protection in times of adversity. Conversely,\nlarger numbers of rank and file are governed by smaller\ngroups of officials and action may be determined more by\nideology or political expediency than by responding to\nwhat the rank and file wants.\nAs another major amalgamation is being contemplated\nbetween two of Australia's largest and most militant unions,\nthe MUA and the Construction, Forestry, Minerals and\nEnergy Union, it is to be hoped that the sacrifices enforced\nupon the rank and file by amalgamation are beginning to\nyield the benefits anticipated by union officials, as enunci-\nequipped to cope with the new era of industrial relations\"\nhave envisaged the ravages that 21st century politics and\neconomics would inflict on the Australian union movement.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmendola,S.(2009).TradeunionmembershipinWesternAustralia.\nInReviewoftheWesternAustralianIndustrialRelationsSystem,\nFinal Report.
