But whether aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2)\npolymorphism is related to diabetic nephropathy is still\ncontroversial. Up to now, there is no meta-analysis investi-\ngating the association between them. To estimate the over-\nall risk of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) polymorphism\nassociated with diabetic nephropathy and to quantify the\npotential between-study heterogeneity, we conducted this\ncomprehensive meta-analysis.\nMaterials and methods\nPublication search\nTwo independent investigators searched the relevant stud-\nies in Embase, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science,\nWanfang Data, VIP Database, China Knowledge Resource\nIntegrated Database and SinoMed with the last search\n\"diabetes mellitus OR diabetic patients\" AND \"diabetic\nAssociation of aldosterone synthase\ndiabetic nephropathy: A meta-analysis\nHaiyan Xu, Xu Wang, Mingming Liu, Xin Shao and Xueyuan He\n Keywords\nAldosterone synthase, CYP11B2, polymorphism, diabetic nephropathy, risk, meta-analysis\nThe First Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of Chinese\nMedicine, Nanjing, China\nCorresponding author:\nXu Wang, The First Clinical Medical College, Nanjing University of\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nnephropathy OR diabetic kidney complications OR dia-\nbetic kidney damage\" AND \"aldosterone synthase poly-\nmorphism OR CYP11B2 gene polymorphism\". References\ncited in recruited studies were also searched. As to some\nresearches without sufficient data, we sent emails to the\ncorresponding authors for request.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria: (a) case-control study; (b) evaluation of\nthe association between aldosterone synthase polymor-\nphism with DN; (c) detailed data of genotypes distribution\ncould be acquired or calculated.\nExclusion criteria: (a) reviews, meeting abstracts, edi-\ntorials and commentaries; (b) study did not meet the inclu-\nsion criteria; (c) duplication of previous publications.\nData extraction and synthesis\nTwo investigators extracted data independently and reached\na consensus by discussing or consulting a third party. The\nfollowing contents were extracted from the studies: the first\nauthor's name, publication year, ethnicity of the study pop-\nulation, the characteristics of cases and controls, the geno-\ntyping method, controls source, sample size of cases and\ncontrols. The alleles frequencies and genotypic distribu-\ntions in both cases and controls were extracted or calcu-\nlated. In addition, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\nstatus in controls were tested for each research.\nStatistical analyses\nOdd ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength\nof the association between aldosterone synthase CYP11B2\npolymorphism and diabetic nephropathy risk. The genetic\nmodels evaluated for pooled ORs of the polymorphisms\nwere allele comparison (T vs. C), homozygote comparison\n(TT vs. CC), heterozygote comparison (TC vs. CC), domi-\nnant comparison (TC+TT vs. CC) and recessive compari-\nson (TT vs. TC+CC), respectively. Heterogeneity among\nstudies was checked by the chi-square-based Q statistic\nand was considered statistically significant at P < 0.10.6\nAccording to the heterogeneity, the OR was calculated by\nusing a fixed effects model or a random effects model.7\nWhen P > 0.10, the pooled OR was calculated by using the\nfixed effects model, otherwise, the random effects model\nwas used. The significance of the pooled OR was deter-\nmined by a Z-test and P < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate\nthe effect of each study on the combined ORs. Subgroup\nanalyses were stratified to evaluate the ethnicity specific\neffects. Potential publication bias was analyzed by Begg's\nfunnel plots8 and Egger's test.9 All statistical tests were\nperformed using STATA 12.0 software.\nResults\nCharacteristics of studies\nThe research selection process is shown by the flow dia-\ngram (Figure 1). A total of 79 potentially eligible studies\nwere acquired from the databases. According to the\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, 74 articles were\nexcluded and five relevant studies concerning aldoster-\none synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism and diabetic\nnephropathy risk were included in our meta-analysis.10\u00ad14\nThe characteristics of each study included in the meta-\nanalysis are shown in Table 1. The genotype and allele\ndistributions in each study and HWE status in controls\nwere also summarized in Table 1. The included studies\nlyzed in our meta-analysis.\nMeta-analysis\nThis is the first meta-analysis about the association\nbetween aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism\nand diabetic nephropathy susceptibility. No significant\nheterogeneity was identified by Q-test and I-squared sta-\ntistic in dominant comparison, recessive comparison,\nhomozygote comparison and heterozygote comparison.\nTherefore, the fixed-effects model was used in above com-\nparisons. Significant between-study heterogeneity only\nexisted in allele comparison, so the random-effects model\nwas chosen. As the result, a significant increased risk was\nfound in recessive comparison (TT vs. TC+CC: OR =\nsignificant association was found in dominant comparison\nNext, subgroup analysis was conducted according to\nethnicity. Only one study was about Caucasian, so we\nonly did descriptive analysis. The research revealed\n-344T/C polymorphism of the aldosterone synthase gene\nwas not associated with initiation or progression of dia-\nbetic nephropathy in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients.10\nThe rest of the four studies were all about Asian popula-\ntion, having no significant heterogeneity. The fixed-\neffects model was chosen and the pooled analysis results\nshowed significant increased risk in allele comparison\nin heterozygote comparison (TC vs. CC: OR = 1.44,\n(shown in Table 2).\nXu et al. 3\nHeterogeneity analysis\nIn the present meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity\nonly existed in the allele comparison (for T vs. C: PQ\n=\nwe conducted the subgroup analyses based on ethnicity\n(Asian or Caucasian), and sensitivity analyses based on\nHWE status. The heterogeneity was significantly reduced\nafter subgroup analyses (PQ\ncould not be effectively removed after sensitivity analyses\nbased on HWE status (PQ\nregression was also performed to explore the other\npotential sources of heterogeneity under the allele genetic\nmodel. The confounding factors included publication year,\nsample size, quality score, HWE status and genotyping\nmethod. The controls source in each study was similar, so\nit was not included. The meta-regression results revealed\nthat none of these five factors could explain significant\nbetween-study heterogeneity:publication year (P = 0.724),\nHWE status (P = 0.604). In addition, we replaced the fixed\neffects model for the random effects model to calculate\npooled ORs, and the results were not materially altered.\nFigure 1.

This procedure was\nused to explore whether individual study was entirely\nresponsible for the combined results. We found only one\nstudy had greater effect on the combined results.10 But\nafter omitting this study, the results were not materially\naltered in every genetic model except for dominant\ncomparison.\nPublication bias\nBegg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test were per-\nformed to assess the publication bias in allele comparison\n(T vs. C). No publication bias was identified by Begg's\nfunnel plot (P = 0.806) or Egger's regression test (P =\n0.474). The funnel plots in all genetic models were sym-\nmetrical (Figure 5, T vs. C).\nDiscussion\nAldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene is located on chro-\nmosome 8 (8q22), and it contains eight introns and nine\nexons.15 Studies have shown that aldosterone synthase\n-344 T/C polymorphism was associated with essential\nhypertension, stroke and cardiovascular function.16\u00ad18 But\nstudies concerning relations between aldosterone synthase\n-344 T/C polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy showed\ncontroversial conclusions. Prasad et al.11 found that T > C\n(-344) polymorphisms in aldosterone synthase were sig-\nnificantly associated with diabetic chronic renal insuffi-\nciency. Lajer et al.10 maintained the -344T/C polymorphism\nof the aldosterone synthase gene was not associated with\ninitiation or progression of diabetic nephropathy in\nCaucasian. So we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate\nthe association. And our results were not exactly the same\nas previous research results.\nAs the first meta-analysis focused on the association\nbetween aldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism\nTable 2. Meta-analyses of aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy risk.\nCategory Sample size T vs. C TT vs. TC+CC TC+TT vs. CC TT vs. CC TC vs. CC\naSignificant heterogeneity existing, the random-effects model was chosen to summarize the result.\nFigure 2. Forest plot for the overall analysis for aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy risk for\nallele comparison (T vs. C).\nXu et al. 5\nand the susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy, our\nresearch analyzed the available data, including a total of\nnificant increased risk was found in recessive compari-\nson, homozygote comparison and allele comparison. No\nsignificant association existed in dominant comparison\nand heterozygote comparison. Subgroup analyses\naccording to ethnicity were conducted. The results in\nAsian population revealed significant increased risk in\nallele comparison, dominant comparison, homozygote\ncomparison and recessive comparison, but not in hete-\nrozygote comparison. In the only Caucasian study,\naldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism was found\nnot associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 1 dia-\nbetic patients. The different results between Asians and\nCaucasians may be accounted for in a number of ways.\nFirstly, different genetic and environmental background\nin different races may play an important role on gene\nphenotypes. Secondly, only one research may not be able\nto explain the genotype distribution of aldosterone syn-\nthase gene polymorphism in Caucasus diabetic nephrop-\nathy patients.\nIn this meta-analysis, significant heterogeneity only\nexisted in the allele comparison (T vs. C). After subgroup\nanalyses the heterogeneity was significantly reduced.\nAccording to the meta-regression result, none of the five\nconfounding factors including publication year, sample\nsize, quality score, HWE status and genotyping method\ncould explain the between-study heterogeneity. So the het-\nerogeneity may derive from racial differences mainly.\nThen, sensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting one\nFigure 3. Forest plot for the subgroup analysis in Asian population for aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 polymorphism and diabetic\nnephropathy risk for allele comparison (T vs. C).\nFigure 4. Result of sensitivity analysis.\nFigure 5.

We found one study had greater effect on\nthe combined results.10 But after omitting the research, the\nresults were not materially altered in every genetic model\nexcept for in dominant comparison. Moreover, we replaced\nthe fixed effects model for the random effects model to\ncalculate pooled OR, and the results were not materially\naltered too. No publication bias was identified by Begg's\nfunnel plot or Egger's regression test. The funnel plots in\nall the genetic models were symmetrical. But owing to the\nlimited number of included studies, power of these two\ntests was small. The conclusion needs further support of\nlarger sample size studies.\nWhen interpreting the results of this meta-analysis,\nsome limitations should still be considered. Firstly, our\nmeta-analysis only contained studies in Caucasians and\nAsians. We cannot know the genotype distributions in\nother ethnic groups. Secondly, the number of included\nstudies limited further analysis due to shortage of original\nstudies. Thirdly, the heterogeneity existed in the allele\ncomparison (T vs. C) should be noted. Ethnicity and sam-\nple size might contribute to the heterogeneity.\nIn conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that\naldosterone synthase -344 T/C polymorphism may be asso-\nciated with increased risks of diabetic nephropathy, espe-\ncially among Asian populations. However, larger sample\nsize studies conducted in different ethnic populations are\nrequired to further evaluate our conclusion in the future.\n"
