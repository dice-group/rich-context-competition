    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aimed to investigate the referrers (including educators) and reasons children were referred to an audiology\nclinic for central auditory processing (CAP) evaluation, to identify a referral pathway for listening problems and professional\ndevelopment needs. A case file audit was used to examine the intake questionnaire completed by 150 parents whose child\nwas diagnosed with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). School staff were the most common referrers, followed\nby medical/allied health professionals, and family members. The most common concerns leading to referral were literacy,\nspeech, language, and academic underperformance, followed by hearing, listening, and processing difficulties and emotional-\nbehavioral issues. Significant correlations were observed between the referral sources and concerns. Results suggest that\nCAPD is primarily conceptualized as part of a more general educational concern. Continuing education and informational\ncounseling is required to ensure that CAP referrals continue to be appropriately made.\n",

Less frequently, deficits in central auditory processing\n(CAP) are directly raised as a possible etiological basis for\nthese difficulties, especially when hearing loss has been\nexcluded as a possible cause. Yet, central auditory processing\ndisorder (CAPD) is a diagnostic category associated with an\narray of difficulties in a variety of academic and life domains\n(American Academy of Audiology, 2010). This retrospective\nstudy investigates educators as a referral source for CAP\nevaluation and also presents a compilation of the other most\ncommon referrers and concerns that precipitate children's\nreferrals to an audiology clinic for CAP evaluation, resulting\nin an eventual diagnosis of CAPD.\nInterest in CAPD is topical and has received significant\nattention from a variety of research and clinical perspectives.\nAlthough a universally accepted definition and set of diag-\nnostic criteria are still lacking, audiologists primarily con-\nceptualize CAPD as a perceptual disorder related to\ndysfunction of central auditory structures in the central ner-\nvous system (CNS; Stach, 2003). In this article, theAmerican\nSpeech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) definitions\nof CAP and CAPD are adopted. CAP is\nthe auditory mechanisms that underlie the following abilities or\nskills: sound localization and lateralization; auditory\ndiscrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of\naudition,includingtemporalintegration,temporaldiscrimination\n(e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and temporal\nmasking; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals\n(including dichotic listening); and auditory performance with\nCAPD refers to \"difficulties in the perceptual processing of\nauditory information in the CNS as demonstrated by poor\nperformance in one or more of the above skills,\" despite nor-\nmal peripheral hearing thresholds (Chermak, 2002, p. 2).\nDebate about the definition, nature, and symptomatology\nof CAPD has undergone a fluctuating trajectory historically\nwith a resurgence (particularly in the audiology literature) of\nCAPD as a distinct diagnostic entity. The heterogeneous\nnature of the extensive list of associated behavioral features\n1La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia\n2Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel\n3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nChyrisse Heine, School of Human Communication Sciences, La Trobe\nUniversity, Bundoora, Victoria 3084, Australia.\nEmail: c.heine@latrobe.edu.au\nEducators as Referrers for Central\nAuditory Processing Assessments: Who\nElse Refers and Why?\nChyrisse Heine1, Michelle Slone2, and Wayne J. Wilson3\n Keywords\ncentral auditory processing, central auditory processing disorder, referrals, educators, allied health professionals\n2 SAGE Open\nhas evoked criticism since CAPD defies definition and spec-\nification on the basis of a unique cluster of diagnostic signs\nreflecting some underlying mechanism (DeBonis &\nMoncrieff, 2008). For example, Ferguson, Hall, Riley, and\nMoore (2011) compared the communication, listening, and\nbehavior of normally developing children to two groups of\nchildren, one group with specific language impairment (SLI)\nand one with CAPD. These authors concluded that the groups\nof children with SLI and CAPD displayed similar behavioral\nand parental report profiles, thereby suggesting that differen-\ntial diagnosis based on their referral route rather than diag-\nnostic outcome is impossible. Furthermore, high levels of\ncomorbidity with other language, literacy, cognitive and\nbehavioral disorders further confound attempts at delineating\nthe boundaries of the impairment based on behaviors and\nsymptomatology (Hamaguchi & Tazeau, 2007).\nCAPD is a controversial label and, although it is a pre-\nferred diagnostic label to other labels such as language and\nphonological disorders (Kamhi, 2004), it has attracted debate\nand criticism among professionals. Foremost among these\ncontroversies is whether CAPD is primarily an auditory defi-\ncit or attributed to or comorbid with other deficits such as\nlanguage processing (Medwetsky & Musiek, 2011) or atten-\ntion (Moore, Ferguson, Edmondson-Jones, Ratib, & Riley,\ndiversity in the field of CAPD since there is a lack of consen-\nsus regarding its definition, the battery of tests used for its\ndiagnosis and the rehabilitation measures used for its man-\nagement. Notwithstanding the controversies surrounding the\nlabel, CAPD is considered a complex multifaceted auditory\ndeficit usually diagnosed by an audiologist using specific\naudiological tests designed to assess CAP skills (such as\ndefined in the ASHA, 2005, definition), although its implica-\ntions converge with domains addressed by numerous medi-\ncal and allied health professionals (M/AHP), including\nmedical specialists (such as otolaryngologists or neurolo-\ngists), speech-language pathologists (SLPs), occupational\ntherapists, psychologists, and educators.\nBehavioral characteristics associated with the impairment\nare descriptive and exhaustively described, and include dif-\nficulty comprehending speech in competing or reverberant\nenvironments, requests for repetition of information often\nusing nonspecific clarification requests, misunderstanding\nmessages, inconsistent or inappropriate responses, delays in\nresponding to oral communication, difficulty following com-\nplex auditory directions, difficulty with sound localization,\ninattentiveness, distractibility, and literacy difficulties\n(Hamaguchi & Tazeau, 2007). A point of confusion for pro-\nfessionals (specifically those working in a school environ-\nment) is the issue of exclusivity, since many of the above\nbehavioral manifestations may also be evident in children\nwith other disorders such as those with language difficulties,\nmemory or attention deficits among many other disorders.\nEhren (2009) suggests that in many instances, the curriculum\ndemands facing school aged children are fundamentally\nbased on language knowledge and skills, and may contribute\nto a child's listening and auditory processing difficulties\nleading to difficulty with separating out the symptomatology\n\"supposedly\" specific to CAPD. Moreover, comorbidity of\nCAPD with other disorders such as language-learning diffi-\nculties may result in difficulty with differential diagnosis and\nneeds to be accounted for in the assessment of children sus-\npected of having CAPD so that appropriate diagnoses can be\nmade and management can be sought (Geffner & Ross-\nCAPD as a modality specific perceptual dysfunction as\nquestioned by Cacace and McFarland (2005) has been widely\nchallenged (Katz & Tillery, 2005; Musiek, Bellis, &\ndeficits that make up CAPD and associated deficits across\nlife domains necessitate a holistic approach to identify rea-\nsons for referral for CAP evaluation. Interacting language,\nliteracy, and auditory processing systems contribute to the\ncomplexity of identifying specific behaviors leading to a\nCAPD diagnosis. Numerous scenarios are therefore possible.\nIt is possible that children who will eventually be diagnosed\nwith CAPD have poor listening skills and poor skills in other\ndomains such as language, in which case, it is difficult to\nseparate CAPD symptomatology from symptoms arising\nfrom other difficulties. CAPD thus may be present but over-\nlooked. It is also possible that children's good language or\nliteracy competency may mask potential CAP symptomatol-\nogy and deficits (Heine & Slone, 2008). The interacting sys-\ntems of language, literacy, memory, and attention stress the\nneed for further investigation in regard to the referral con-\ncern and the referral sources best positioned to detect signs\nand symptoms that warrant further investigation.\nIt is anticipated that a wide variety of people in the educa-\ntional system and community (including family) would refer\na child to an audiologist and possibly other M/AHP for CAP\nevaluation. Listening or hearing difficulties (Johnson, Benson,\n& Seaton, 1997), difficulty with the acquisition of literacy as\nin reading and/or spelling, learning difficulties including\nsuspected dyslexia, slow academic progress, or language\ndifficulty may alert educators about the need for further\ninvestigation of CAP skills. Although teachers are potentially\nexcellent referral initiators for CAP testing as they observe\nchildren's listening and academic skills and behaviors in a\nvariety of listening environments, they may not have the\nknowledge to pinpoint CAPD as a possible feature of chil-\ndren's language-learning and literacy-based problems, which\ncould lead to under referral for CAPD evaluation.\nAllied health professionals such as SLPs may also con-\nceptualize CAPD as another disorder such as receptive lan-\nguage disorder or be unable to differentiate CAPD from\nanother disorder (Heine, Joffe, & Greaves, 2003). Hence,\nthey may not be referring children with potential CAPD to an\naudiology clinic for CAP evaluation. Furthermore, comor-\nbidity with other deficits such as attention deficit hyperactiv-\nity disorders, Asperger's Syndrome, or sensory integration\nHeine et al. 3\ndisorder (Medwetsky & Musiek, 2011) may misguide pro-\nfessionals in referring a child for audiological CAP evalua-\ntion. For families, usually a child's listening difficulties or\nbehavior evident in the home and social environment may\nnecessitate referral. For example, difficulty following\ninstructions or communicating effectively with others as dis-\nplayed by frequent requests for repetition (Heine, 2003).\nAlthough a universally accepted definition and set of\ndiagnostic criteria for CAPD is still lacking, the general pub-\nlic is becoming increasingly more aware of the concept of\nCAPD and referrals for CAP assessment continue to increase\n(Bellis, 2011). Most research has concentrated on debates\naround definitions and criteria, terminology and constructing\nassessment instruments. While it is reported that certain\nbehaviors in children warrant referral for a CAP assessment\n(e.g., listening difficulties; Bellis, 2011), no research has\nbeen conducted on who is referring for CAP assessments and\nwhy they are referring. The determination of the referral con-\ncern most frequently leading to referral for CAP evaluation\nand resulting in a CAPD diagnosis will assist and alert future\nreferrers in regard to the behaviors that could necessitate\nreferral to an audiologist for CAP evaluation. In addition, the\nidentification of referral sources would highlight the referral\nconcern specific to the referral initiator and determine which\nif any referral initiators are in need of further informational\ncounseling so that children with CAPD can be identified and\nmanaged. Information regarding referral concerns and refer-\nral sources will also provide insight into the decision-making\nprocess that professionals and families consider when refer-\nring a child for audiological evaluation.\nThe aims of this case file audit were to identify the refer-\nral sources and concerns that necessitate a child's referral to\nan audiological clinic for CAP evaluation, whether educators\nare the primary referrers of children for a CAP evaluation,\nand examine the relationship between referral sources and\nconcerns.\nMaterials and Method\nParticipants\nData were collected over a 6-month period (beginning in\nCAPD since January 2013. These children had completed a\nfull battery of hearing and CAP tests at an audiology clinic\nthat specifically specializes in CAP evaluation.At the time of\nthe assessment, the parents/guardians of these children com-\npleted a short generic questionnaire that was routinely used\nin this clinic. The questionnaire (adapted from Northern &\nDowns, 2002) enquired about each child's demographics,\nreferral information, schooling, prior professional consulta-\ntions, medical history, family history, and developmental his-\ntory. The referred group of children comprised 94 boys\nbackgrounds (Australian or an immigrant group, such as\nfrom the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or South Africa)\nand socioeconomic class (attending both state and private\nschools) and derived from urban or rural population groups\n(living in Metropolitan Melbourne or surrounding areas in\nVictoria Australia).\nParticipants were excluded from this study if the parent\ndid not fully complete the demographic or referral question\nparts of the case history questionnaire; if they did not sign\ninformed consent for the use of their child's information for\nresearch purposes; if the child's home language was any lan-\nguage other than English, because English as a second lan-\nguage can influence the results of CAP testing, and if they\nwere not diagnosed with CAPD after completing the audio-\nlogical testing.\nInstruments\nHearing and CAP evaluation. The hearing evaluation consisted\nof otoscopic examination, pure-tone air-conduction threshold\naudiometry, speech audiometry, and acoustic immittance\ntesting. The measures used to assess CAP were selected\naccording to ASHA (2005) guidelines and included evalua-\ntion of monaural low-redundancy speech, dichotic listening,\nand auditory temporal processing (see Table 1). The children\nin this study were diagnosed as having CAPD if they received\na score of 2 standard deviations below the mean on two or\nmore tests (as recommended by ASHA, 2005).\nCase history questionnaire. Parents completed a case history\nquestionnaire (see the appendix) in which the following\ninformation was provided: demographic data (including\nchild's date of birth and age, gender, home address, language\nspoken at home), referral information (the referral source ini-\ntiating the referral for this evaluation and the reason for the\nreferral), schooling (school attended and year level), medical\nhistory (general medical and ear specific history), and family\nhistory and developmental history (pregnancy, birth history,\nand developmental milestones).\nReferral sources and referral concerns questions.The parents\ncompleted the referral sources and concerns section of the\nquestionnaire by responding to questions that aimed at iden-\ntifying the presenting concern necessitating the CAP evalua-\ntion and the referral source initiating the CAP evaluation.\nThe following questions were asked (see the appendix): Did\nanyone refer you to this clinic (Yes/No)? If yes, who referred\nyou? If no, how did you hear about this clinic? Please\ndescribe the concern/s that led you to contact this clinic.\nOn observation of item analysis, it was noted that referral\nsources could be delineated into three broad categories. One cat-\negory was comprised of educators (the principal, assistant princi-\npal or vice principal, teachers, and special education personnel).\nThe second category worked in the M/AHP (including doctors,\notolaryngologists, pediatricians, neurologists, psychologists,\n4 SAGE Open\noccupational therapists, SLPs, and other professional personal).\nThe final category comprised family members (which included\nfamily and friends as the referrer). In this way, referral sources\nwere categorized as \"school staff,\" \"M/AHP,\" and \"family.\"\nThere were no instances of more than one referrer.\nA range of referral concerns was also reported. These were\nclearly delineated into concerns describing \"hearing, listen-\ning, and processing\" problems, such as \"difficulties listening\nin noise\" or \"slow processing speed.\" The second category\nwas comprised of concerns describing literacy, speech, lan-\nguage, and academic problems, such as \"difficulty with read-\ning or spelling\" or \"receptive language difficulties.\" The third\ncategory constituted items describing emotional-behavioral\nsymptoms (including attention and concentration problems),\nsuch as \"difficulty concentrating on tasks\" or \"difficulty sus-\ntaining attention.\" For each child, the primary (first) reported\nconcern as well as any further (secondary) concerns was cat-\negorized into one of the three categories. Following this allo-\ncation, the total number of reports per category was tallied,\nproducing a total score in the categories \"hearing, listening,\nand processing\" problems; \"literacy, speech, language, and\nacademic\" problems; and \"emotional-behavioral\" problems.\nThere were 45 instances of children referred for two concerns\nand seven instances of three concerns per child.\nProcedure\nThe same procedure was adopted for all children attending the\nclinic. Parents and their children attended the CAP clinic at a\npre-arranged appointment date and time. They completed the\ncase history questionnaire and informed consent form which\ntakes approximately 5 min. Children's hearing and CAP skills\nwere then evaluated by a qualified audiologist in a sound-\nproof clinic room adjacent to the waiting room. The peripheral\nhearing evaluation was conducted using a Heine Otoscope,\nEarscan Immittance Meter, and Itera diagnostic audiometer\nwith TDH-39 headphones. Peripheral hearing testing was fol-\nlowed by the CAP test battery evaluating, in order of test pre-\nsentation, monaural low-redundancy speech testing, dichotic\nlistening, and temporal processing (see Table 1).\nFollowing this evaluation, a case discussion took place\nbetween the audiologist and the parents.\nData Analysis\nThe data were analyzed descriptively and statistically using\n2 tests at the p = .05 level of significance.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nAs an initial step in data analysis, descriptive analyses were\nconducted. School staff was the primary referral source\nSLPs, and finally by family members (9.0%). See Figure 1.\nAnalysis of the percentage of referral concerns revealed\nthat more than half the children (55.2%) were referred for\nTable 1.

However, in the category of\nfamily, referrals were equally made on the basis of the hear-\ning, listening, and processing difficulties (18.4%), followed\nby literacy, speech, language, and academic underperfor-\nmance (4.3% and 4.8%). There were no referrals made by\nfamily on the basis of emotional-behavioral issues.\nTo determine which categories of variables were major\ncontributors to the statistically significant 2 values, 2 pair\ncomparisons were examined. The result of 2 indicated that\nthere was a significant relationship between the referral\nsources of M/AHP and family for emotional-behavioral\nissues and hearing, listening and processing difficulties (2 =\nbetween school staff and family for emotional-behavioral\nissues and hearing, listening, and processing difficulties (2 =\n8.4, p < .005).

Literature is available describing the\nclose association between CAPD and literacy and academic\nproblems and CAPD and speech and language disorders\nSchow, 2000). Numerous theories have been hypothesized\nFigure 1. Distribution of referral sources.\nNote. M/AHP = medical or allied health profession.\n6 SAGE Open\n(although not yet proven) to explain the link between CAP,\nlanguage and learning difficulties. Tallal and Piercy (1973)\nused an auditory repetition task (ART) to investigate the tem-\nporal processing of children with SLI compared with normal\ndeveloping children. These authors concluded that children\nwith SLI had more difficulty on this task than their normal\ndeveloping counterparts when the interstimulus interval was\nshort. In a follow-up study, Tallal, Miller, Jenkins, and\nMerzenich (1997) attributed oral and written childhood lan-\nguage disorders to a nonverbal processing deficit which\noccurs when auditory information is presented rapidly. Tallal\n(1980) found similar findings in a study with reading-\nimpaired children. In contrast, however, Nittrouer (1999)\nfound that good and poor readers did not differ in their ART\nperformance or ability to identify brief formant transitions.\nLanguage, learning, and SLI are common deficits associated\nwith literacy and academic underperformance. Diagnosis of\nlanguage and learning difficulties may in fact overshadow\nthe referral for CAPD evaluation as CAP deficits are less\nknown as a clinical entity.\nThe second most frequent category of concerns on which\nreferral was based, was hearing, listening, and processing\nproblems. Referral to an audiologist on this basis would be\nhighly insightful as the audiologist is the professional com-\npetent in evaluating the audiological system using audio-\nmetric instruments, and thus should have been the most\nobvious place to refer a child for these specific concerns.\nHowever, overall, these referral criteria were used by only\n23.3% of cases. School staff and M/AHPs underutilized this\ncriterion as a prompt for referral. A possible reason for lack\nof recognition of deficits in the auditory system as an under-\nlying explanation for the child's functional deficits could be\nthat referral sources are not familiar with the audiological\nevaluation of CAPD. Potential referral sources are possibly\nalso unable to distinguish auditory processing deficits from\ngeneral academic, literacy, speech, and language disorders\nand may in their professional view believe that CAPD is a\nlanguage or learning disorder. It is also possible that they\nrefer children with these problems to other professionals\nsuch as the SLP or psychologist even if there are only listen-\ning, hearing, or processing symptomatologies (e.g., diffi-\nculty experienced only in complex listening situations such\nas when there is excessive background noise). The referral\nto other allied health professionals (other than the audiolo-\ngist) may also be explained on the basis of comorbidity or\nthe possibility that hearing, listening, or processing symp-\ntomatology may also be associated with other deficits (e.g.,\n, a child with a language disorder may display hearing, lis-\ntening or processing difficulties).\nA large proportion of families also used these criteria\nappropriately as a stimulus for referral to an audiologist. A\ntentative explanation accounting for the prevalence of this\nreferral category among family referrers is their ability to\ndetect the child's difficulty in attending to auditory informa-\ntion in an everyday home environment. Families may thus be\nin the best position to identify the child's auditory discrimi-\nnation difficulties, misidentification of auditory-presented\ninstructions, confusion of sounds and words, inability to fol-\nlow instructions, or communication, particularly in com-\npromised listening environments. Because these difficulties\nFigure 2. Distribution of referral concerns.\nHeine et al. 7\noccur in routine home environments, parents may not be\nconfused with listening and processing difficulties as\nopposed to difficulties in other academic areas such as liter-\nacy or academic underperformance.\nThe third category of presenting problems was emotional-\nbehavioral problems that prompted referral in only 21.4% of\ncases. It is most probable that the audiologist is not the pri-\nmary person associated with this referral concern and the\npossibility of an audiological associated problem is enter-\ntained only after exhausting other alternative diagnoses.\nSchool staff and M/AHPs used emotional-behavioral\nproblems as a basis of referral. In contrast, the family did not\nuse this concern at all as a referral criterion possibly as this\nsymptomatology is more obscure and is probably attributed\nby them to psychological disorder.\nSchool staff play a central role in referring children for\nCAP evaluation. They have broad knowledge and training in\na variety of educational and associated content and issues,\nthereby positioning them to identify CAPD as a possible eti-\nology for children's listening difficulties. They also have\naccess to large populations of children and carry the respon-\nsibility for delivering the curriculum to children, as well as\nfor evaluating and monitoring children's performance and\nreferring children to a specialist when appropriate. This\nhighlights the importance of continued appraisal of school\nstaff in relation to CAPD, its symptomatology and audiologi-\ncal diagnosis to assist with identifying appropriate children\nfor referral. A recent review of the literature evaluated\nwhether reexamining the current CAPD protocols for school-\nage children is required, and concluded that the focus should\nrather be redirected to evaluating overall listening needs\n(DeBonis, 2015). Thus, for school staff, describing and dif-\nferentiating children's listening performance in a variety of\nlistening contexts would be useful to inform the referral for\nCAP evaluation. These include differentiating performance\nin quiet environments as opposed to environments with\nexcessive background noise or high reverberation, one-on-\none situations as opposed to group situations where dichotic\nlistening (multi-task listening) is required, and single-task\nauditory contexts as opposed to multiple task auditory con-\ntexts where the ability to divert auditory attention to various\nsimultaneously presented auditory stimuli is required. It is\nimportant to note, however, that although these observations\nmay be useful for educators to consider the necessity for\nCAP referral, these listening behaviors are not implicitly\nsuggestive of CAPD.\nTable 2.

The relatively lower referral rate\nby M/AHPs for CAP assessment may be due to several rea-\nsons. It is possible that many personnel in this category con-\nceptualize CAPD in a different way to the audiologist; they are\nnot fully knowledgeable of strongly indicative referral criteria,\nthe complexity of this diagnostic category, types of audiologi-\ncal assessments that can inform a diagnosis, and knowledge of\nthe audiologist's expertise in CAP evaluation.\nIn this study, the family did not make as many referrals for\nCAP evaluation compared to school staff and M/AHPs. It is\nlikely that families (and possibly many other nonhealth pro-\nfessionals) are unaware of this diagnostic category and of\nsymptoms that would prompt referral for CAP assessment,\nparticularly as CAPD is a complex disorder that frequently\ndefies specificity. In addition, families often become\nimmersed in their child's difficulties thereby limiting their\nobjectivity when considering the source of problems.\nFamilies did not make any referrals for CAP evaluation\nbased on emotional-behavioral symptoms, suggesting that\nthey are unaware of this association, or this concern is not\napparent in a home environment, or they consult specialists\nother than the audiologist in this regard. Notwithstanding the\nimportance of parental referrals for CAP assessment, it\nwould be a difficult task to apprise parents with the appropri-\nate knowledge on a widespread basis. This fortifies the rele-\nvance of school staff and M/AHPs in detecting criteria for\naudiological CAPD referral.\nLimitations\nThis sample was conducted on clients attending a private\naudiological clinic, and the origin of the sample may possibly\nbe limited in generalizability, although no state-funded ser-\nvices for CAP testing are available in this state. In addition,\nparticipants in this study were collapsed into one sample\nfrom the age range 7 to 11 years. It would be interesting to\nincrease the sample size and examine possible developmen-\ntal differences that might alter the referral source and\nconcerns.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study suggested that school staff were\nthe primary referral sources, while literacy, speech, language,\nand academic underperformance were the primary concern\nnecessitating referral for an audiological CAP assessment.\nThis suggests that for educators, CAPD is connected to gen-\neral concerns about children's underperformance at school.\nSchool staff are at the forefront of contact with children's\nlistening and learning difficulties and are therefore in one of\nthe best positions to identify children that require an audio-\nlogical CAP assessment. In addition, their training in educa-\ntion positions them to be alert to behaviors and symptoms\nthat could suggest the need for referral. Dialogue between\nschool staff and audiologists should be cultivated to further\ndefine the referral criteria for CAPD evaluation.\nHuman Subjects Approval Statement\nAt the time of the assessment, all parents/guardians signed\nand dated an informed consent form for their case records to\nbe used in any current or future research projects.
