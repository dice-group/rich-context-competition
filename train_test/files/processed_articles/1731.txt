All participants\n(and parents or guardians of minors) gave their\nwritten informed consent after receiving a de-\nscription of the study and the potential risks\nof participation.\nDemographic characteristics were col-\nlected at the household interview. Partici-\npants reported their ethnicity and race.10 The\nNCHS later categorized these classifications into\nnon-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexi-\ncan American, or other (including Asian [vari-\nous countries], Pacific Islander, Native Ameri-\ncan, non\u00adMexican American Hispanic, and\nmultiracial).\nThe vision examination was conducted on\nparticipants 12 years and older. An autorefrac-\ntor (NIDEK ARK-760; Nidek Co Ltd, Tokyo,\nJapan) was used to measure the refractive er-\nror of each eye after corrective lenses had been\nremoved. Three separate measurements of\nsphere, cylinder, and axis were acquired and\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of\nEpidemiology and Clinical\nResearch, National Eye\nInstitute, National Institutes of\nHealth (Drs Vitale, Cotch,\nFerris, and Sperduto), and\nNational Eye Institute, National\nInstitutes of Health\n(Dr Ellwein), Bethesda,\nMaryland.\n\u00a92008 American Medical Association.

For myopia and hyperopia, we\ncategorized participants based on the refractive error measure-\nments from the eye with the larger absolute spherical equiva-\nlent (SphEq) value. If one eye had missing refractive error data,\ndata from the eye with available data were used. Refractions\nwere recorded in plus cylinder notation, and the SphEq value\nwas computed as the sphere measurement plus half the cylin-\nder measurement. Clinically important myopia was defined as\na myopic SphEq value of at least -1.0 diopter (D); clinically im-\nportant hyperopia was defined as a hyperopic SphEq value of\n3.0 D or more. Severe myopia was defined as a myopic SphEq\nvalue of at least -5.0 D.11,12 We also present data with myopia\ndefined as a SphEq value of at least -0.5 D. Astigmatism was\ndefined as a cylinder of 1.0 D or greater in the eye with the larger\ncylinder value.\nBecause of time constraints imposed by the comprehensive\nNHANES, it was not feasible to obtain cycloplegic refractions.\nAccommodation may, therefore, have affected the measure-\nment of the refractive error, particularly in younger partici-\npants, despite the autofogging used by the autorefractor to mini-\nmize accommodation. Consequently, for persons aged 12\nthrough 19 years, the prevalence of myopia is likely to be over-\nestimated and the prevalence of hyperopia is likely to be un-\nderestimated by the autorefractor measurements.

Our estimated prevalence of\nmyopia was higher than the 25% reported in previous\nof ethnic Chinese persons in Singapore.12 General over-\nall statements regarding the distribution of myopia among\ndemographic subgroups cannot be made because we\nfound statistically significant interactions between age and\nsex (P.001) and between age and race/ethnicity\n(P.001), as well as a borderline statistically signifi-\ncant interaction between sex and race/ethnicity (P=.07).\nOverall, it appears that the pattern of myopia preva-\nlence by age is similar, regardless of the definition of myo-\npia, with nearly identical prevalence estimates within the\nedly lower prevalence for those 60 years and older (ap-\nproximately half that for the younger ages). Sex differ-\nences in myopia prevalence were observed within the\n20- to 39-year age group, in whom myopia (SphEq value\n-1.0 D) was more prevalent in women (40%) than in\nmen (33%) (P.001); the same pattern was observed for\nmyopia defined as an SphEq value of -0.5 D or less\n(P .001) and for myopia defined as an SphEq value of\n-5.0 D or less (P.001). The prevalence of myopia of\n-0.5 D or less was similar to that found in studies of Asian\npopulations.12 Sex differences in refractive error preva-\nlence were also observed within the 60 years or older\ngroup, in whom hyperopia was more common (13% vs\nP.001) among women than among men. The preva-\nlence of refractive error varied by age, with those 60 years\nand older being less likely to have myopia (P.001 for\nall myopia definitions) and more likely to have hyper-\nyounger persons. Although hyperopia and astigmatism\nprevalence did not vary among race/ethnicity catego-\nries, myopia prevalence was higher in non-Hispanic whites\nthough this race/ethnicity difference was not apparent\nMost previous epidemiologic studies that provide\nprevalence estimates for refractive error were limited to\na specific geographic location or age group. The 1971-\n1972 NHANES provided the first US-wide population-\nbased prevalence estimates for many eye conditions, in-\ncluding refractive error. Sperduto et al20 found that the\nprevalence of myopia in the United States in persons aged\non lensometry [for those with visual acuity of 20/40 or\nbetter] or on retinoscopy [for those with worse visual acu-\nity]) compared with 33.1% in the current study (in per-\nsons 20 years). The prevalence estimates for myopia\nare substantially higher for both non-Hispanic black and\nrespectively). It is possible that myopia prevalence in the\nUnited States has increased during the 30-year period be-\ntween the 2 NHANES studies. A previous study21 docu-\nmented an increased prevalence of myopia during a 12-\nyear period in young Israeli adults and attributed it to a\npossible cohort effect. However, because of consider-\nable differences in the methods used to define myopia\nin the 2 NHANES studies, additional research would be\nrequired to conclude that prevalence of myopia had in-\ncreased and, if so, to explore possible reasons for such\nan increase.\nRecently, the Eye Disease Prevalence Research Group\n(EDPRG) performed a meta-analysis of existing popu-\nlation-based studies in persons 40 years or older (con-\nestimates for the prevalence of refractive error in the\nUnited States and other countries.11 Definitions of hy-\nperopia, myopia, and severe myopia were the same as in\nTable 6.

Our NHANES-based estimate of prevalence\nof myopia in the United States for persons 40 years and\nstantially higher than the EDPRG estimate for the United\nof myopia was higher in the recent NHANES study than\nin the EDPRG for both non-Hispanic blacks and non-\nHispanic whites.\nThe prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less in the\ncurrent study was 41.0% for persons 40 years and older.\nWong et al12 found a similar prevalence of myopia\n(38.7%) in ethnic Chinese persons living in Singapore.\nHowever, the prevalence of severe myopia in the cur-\nrent study was lower (6.0%) than that found by Wong\net al (9.1%), possibly attributable to differences in the\nage structure of the 2 populations because the United\nStates may have more older individuals (who have a\nrelatively lower prevalence of myopia) than Singapore.\nOur estimated prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less\nfor persons 60 years and older was 26.5%, greater than\nthe 19.5% estimated from the Rotterdam Study22 (per-\nsons 55 years). The prevalence of myopia in the Blue\nMountains Eye Study23 was 15%, which is strikingly\nlower than the prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less\nfound in the current NHANES and that reported from\nthe Beaver Dam Eye Study.24 The Blue Mountains Eye\nStudy and Rotterdam Study populations may have a dif-\nferent distribution of underlying risk factors for myopia\nthat could explain their lower prevalence estimates, but\nwe are unable to address this issue within the scope of\nthe current study.\nOur myopia prevalence estimates for non-Hispanic\n(9%). Our prevalence estimates for myopia in those 60\nyears and older appear comparable to those reported from\nthe Barbados Eye Study.\nThe EDPRG results for Hispanic individuals were\nbased on a single study4 in a Mexican American popu-\nlation (Proyecto Ver [Nogales, Arizona]). Recently,\nthe Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES)26 reported\nprevalence estimates of myopia for Hispanic persons\n40 years and older (90% of whom reported Mexican\nprevalence of myopia among NHANES Mexican\nAmerican participants was higher than in their LALES\nand EDPRG counterparts. For those 60 years and\nolder, NHANES and LALES prevalences were similar\nand higher than those from the EDPRG.\nIt is not possible for us to compare results for \"other\"\nrace/ethnicity with previous studies because this cat-\negory includes participants with a wide range of ances-\ntries and NHANES does not provide data to allow fur-\nther differentiation within this subgroup. However,\nbecause the NHANES sample as a whole is designed to\nrepresent the entire US population, it is important to in-\nclude the other subgroup in calculating estimates for the\nentire US population.\nWe found that the prevalence of myopia was lowest\nin participants 60 years and older, consistent with other\npopulation-based studies.28,29 Although it is possible that\nthe lower prevalence of myopia in those 60 years and older\nis because of a cohort effect, as reported in other, younger\npopulations,21,30 this observation may also be because of\nintrinsic, age-related changes in the refractive compo-\nThe observed lower prevalence of myopia in persons\n60 years and older may also in part be because of an\nassociation of cataract surgery (a criterion for exclusion)\nwith myopic refractive status.33 Because we have no\ninformation on the refractive status of participants\nbefore cataract surgery, we are unable to explore this\nhypothesis.\nOur study has several important limitations. Because\nof time constraints and potential for participant fatigue,\nwe could not perform a full ophthalmic examination on\nall participants in the MEC. Our study protocol, there-\nfore, included the use of an autorefractor, operated ac-\ncording to a standard protocol by trained operators. Our\nnoncycloplegic refraction values were based on the mean\nof 3 measurements by the autorefractor and did not in-\nclude subjective refinement. This may have resulted in\noverestimates of the true number with myopia,34 espe-\ncially among younger participants, who have a higher am-\nplitude of accommodation. Because of this concern, we\nlence estimates of refractive error for those aged 12\nAs in the EDPRG, we categorized participants based\non the refractive characteristics of the eye with a greater\nabsolute SphEq value, resulting in an estimated myopia\non 5709 individuals]). If we had considered an indi-\nvidual as myopic if either eye was myopic,35 we would\nhave classified an additional 15 participants as myopic,\nAlthough the NHANES sampling weights correct for\nnonresponse within population subgroups, it is pos-\nsible that NHANES participants who had vision data had\ndifferent refractive characteristics than those who did not\nhave vision data. Response rates to the home interview\nand MEC examination were lower in older individu-\nals.36 Participants who reported for the MEC examina-\ntion may have had missing vision data because of equip-\nment malfunction or inability to cooperate with the\nexamination.\nBecause refractive error's effect on visual acuity\ncan be mitigated relatively easily, it has sometimes\nbeen overlooked as an important cause of visual\nimpairment.37,38 Many previous epidemiologic stud-\nies39 based definitions of visual impairment on best-\ncorrected rather than presenting (ie, with habitual cor-\nrection) visual acuity. However, newer research40,41\nhas focused attention on the benefits of correcting\nrefractive error. A recent analysis7(p1760) found that\nmuch of the economic burden posed by vision disor-\nders is because of refractive error, concluding that\n\"interventions to diagnose and treat uncorrected\nrefractive error have the potential to be highly cost-\neffective based on the improvements in patient quality\nof life they generate.\"\n\u00a92008 American Medical Association.

Refractive er-\nror is, therefore, the most common condition affecting\nthe ocular health of the US population, involving young\nadults, middle-aged persons, and older adults of all eth-\nnicities. In a previous study,6 we estimated the annual\ndirect cost of providing refractive correction to the 100\nmillion people who need it to achieve good vision as ex-\nceeding $3.5 billion (not including the costs of identi-\nfying those who need refractive correction). Others es-\ntimated the economic burden (including indirect costs)\nof refractive error in those 40 years and older to be $5.5\nbillion.7 Accurate, current estimates of the prevalence of\nrefractive error are essential for projecting vision care\nneeds and planning for provision of vision care services\nto the many people affected.\nCorrespondence: Susan Vitale, PhD, MHS, 5635 Fish-\n.nih.gov).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Vitale had full access to all of\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nFinancial Disclosure: None reported.\nFunding/Support: The NHANES is sponsored by the\nNCHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
