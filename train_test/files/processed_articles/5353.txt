While the study of online political\ncommunication provides several different perspectives, few studies have attempted\nto uncover tendencies of so-called permanent campaigning in online environments.\nThe term signifies campaign-like activities at the hands of politicians also during non-\nelection periods and has spawned a number of conceptual discussions. This article\npresents an exploratory effort, studying traces of permanent campaigning in two\nsimilar countries--Norway and Sweden. As the former of these countries underwent a\nparliamentary election during the studied period, the study provides insights into \"the\nelection effect\"--heightened levels of online activity among the Norwegian parties and\npoliticians that can perhaps best be understood in relation to an ongoing election.\n",

Indeed, in an early study from 1996, Margolis\net al. (1996) suggested that \"the Internet may have the potential to change the nature [...]\nof world politics, but we doubt that it will\" (p. 75). While many such claims of unearthed\npotentials seem to hold true also in later studies (e.g. Dahlgren, 2005; Karpf, 2012;\nLarsson, 2013a), echoing the often-discussed normalization hypothesis, scholars have\nalso found support for what is sometimes referred to as its antithesis--the equalization\nhypothesis, suggesting traces of the Internet functioning as some form of political\nengagement panacea, \"allowing new forms of political participation which previously\nThe study of citizens online has been complemented with scrutiny of the Internet\nactivities of those holding or seeking parliamentary power--that is, politicians up for\nelection. While hosting your own web site has become \"virtually mandatory\" (Druckman\nparadigm of web publishing have reinstated the necessity to maintain an active online\npresence. This time around, the focus lays not on self-hosted web pages, but rather on\nso-called social media like Facebook or Twitter--ready-made platforms where users\nsupposedly come to socialize and communicate. Moreover, while the notion of the per-\nmanent campaign, suggesting blurred lines between campaigning and governing, was\nfirst coined in the 1970s (e.g. Blumenthal, 1980), the \"always-on\" logic of social media\nhas led to suggestions that such continuous endeavors by politicians might be on the rise\nstructural approach, this study employs a series of quantitative analyses in order to assess\nthe degree to which political actors make use of their Facebook Pages outside of as well\nas during election periods--and how this use is reflected in their online following. Taking\nthe aforementioned normalization and equalization hypotheses as conceptual starting\npoints, this exploratory study traces tendencies for both hypotheses with specific regard\nto the issue of permanent campaigning in a data set which encompasses empirical mate-\nrial from two similar countries: Norway and Sweden. As the former of the two case\ncountries underwent an election during September of 2013, the longitudinal focus of this\nstudy will allow for assessment of what this article tentatively labels as the \"election\neffect\"--structural patterns of activity that can perhaps best be understood as traces of\nelectoral campaigning.\nWhile case study\u00adtype research settings have provided important insights regarding\nthe Internet use of politicians, the article at hand seeks to lessen the suggested dearth of\ncomparative studies on the present topic (e.g. De Vreese, 2009; Enli and Skogerb\u00f8, 2013;\nonly permits the measurement of Facebook Page activity as a continuous variable rather\nthan a dichotomous one (Strandberg, 2013), but it does so in a setting that allows for\ncomparison between individual politicians and the party organizations to which they\nbelong (Klinger, 2013). This is done outside a US/UK context (Hermans and Vergeer,\n2013), in two countries characterized by high numbers of voter engagement as well as\nPermanent campaigning: traces of normalization or\ninnovation?\nThe debate regarding the political consequences of Internet use at the hands of politicians\nhas largely circled around a series of dichotomies, denoting similar themes of optimistic\nor pessimistic approaches to these ongoing developments. Indeed, the pairing of innova-\ntion (sometimes equalization) and normalization is used quite often to denote different\nviews on the topic at hand (e.g. Gibson et al., 2008; Larsson and Svensson, 2014; Margolis\nand Resnick, 2000). The former of these terms suggests that as the Internet allows politi-\ncians to \"communicate directly with citizens without direct interference from the mass\nmedia\" (Hermans and Vergeer, 2013: 74), such possibilities for increased interaction\nwould be incorporated by those seeking public office. Given the lack of resources often\nfound among smaller or fringe parties, the Internet was often thought of as providing an\n\"opening for the outsiders\" (Strandberg, 2009: 835). Specifically, the proposed low cost\nand potential broad reach of the new medium was seen as especially interesting for such\nsmaller actors, who would supposedly be able to level the political playing field through\nsupposed innovative use of new technology. While such largely conceptual musings did\nindeed come to fruition in at least a few instances, suggesting equalizing tendencies\nrelated to the employment of online techniques by comparatively diminutive political\nresearch have largely suggested otherwise. Especially for comparably later scholarly\nefforts, innovation in terms of the utilization of novel online practices is largely found\namong more established actors such as larger parties (e.g. Strandberg, 2013; Tenscher,\n2013) or incumbents (e.g. Williams and Gulati, 2013)--findings that instead suggest a\nnormalization of the online. While we should be wary to draw any firm conclusions, it\nwould seem that while innovative practices can certainly be noted among actors big and\nsmall, the actual use of social media such as Facebook by politicians is often characterized\nas a \"Web 1.5\" approach--suggesting a hybrid of top-down \"Web 1.0\" approaches and\nIn sum, then, the empirical evidence regarding differences between minor and major\npolitical actors and their online conduct is inconclusive. One way forward could be to\napply these broad hypothetical designs in more focused conceptual setting. This is what\nthis article seeks to do.\nThe concept of permanent campaigning was touched upon previously, and while it is\ndifficult to provide precise metrics regarding what such permanence would entail in an\nempirical setting, the study presented here employs the innovation and normalization\nhypotheses to guide a series of quantitative analyses in this regard. As such, our focus\nhere goes beyond a dichotomous approach--detailing whether or not politicians had\nadopted the technology at hand or not (e.g. Gulati and Williams, 2013). Instead, we\nmobilize an exploratory approach, mapping the degree to which politicians make use of\ntheir Facebook Pages. In so doing, we can say very little about the actual content being\nposted--but all the more about how often such postings are taking place, and what effects\nthese uses appear to have in terms of audience engagement.\nThe idea of the permanent campaign, denoting a blurring of the lines between time\nspent on the campaign trail and in the governing office, appears to have first been coined\nin 1976 by Patrick Cadell, advisor to president-elect Jimmy Carter in order to describe\nthe necessity for campaign-like efforts to take place also outside traditional election peri-\nods (Blumenthal, 1980; Noguera and Correyero, 2009). Such schemes for political activ-\nities have arguably only grown more common since the late 1970s--perhaps in some\npart due to the technological developments that today provide the infrastructure neces-\nsary to procure such efforts of online permanent campaigning (Cook, 2002; Sparrow and\nTurner, 2001). Indeed, Vergeer, Hermans and Sams (2011) suggest that \"with the advent\nof the Internet, permanent campaigning [...] to build public support becomes easier\" (p.\n485). While previous studies have shown that the online efforts of politicians and parties\nare largely centered around election periods, scholars, pundits, and practitioners insist\nthat online environments built or hosted by political actors are \"maintained for extended\nperiods and long-term objectives\" (Vaccari, 2008b: 6) or that \"campaigns are permanent,\nalthough with varying intensity\" (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2007: 54)--claims that resonate well with\nthe aforementioned always-on social media logic and that is often associated with ser-\nvices like Facebook. By tracing tendencies of the innovation and normalization hypoth-\neses in the empirical material collected, the study at hand furthers our understanding of\nonline permanent campaigning in two modern democracies--Norway and Sweden.\nResearch setting: Norway and Sweden\nThe adopted analytical setup follows a \"most similar cases\" strategy, studying compara-\nble cases that share basic characteristics, but vary concerning dimensions of specific\ninterest (e.g. Ragin, 1987). For this study, such dimensions concern elections--specifi-\ncally the fact that while one of the case countries--Norway--underwent a parliamentary\nelection during the time of data collection, the other did not. Both countries are charac-\nterized by high levels of general Internet use--a claim that holds true also with regard to\nthe uses of the specific service under scrutiny here, Facebook (e.g. Karlsen, 2011;\nNordicom, 2013). As for the use of Internet technologies at the hands of political actors,\nparties in both countries have utilized the new medium for a long time--however, they\n\"have not necessarily been trailblazers in campaigning online\" (Gibson, 2004: 104).\nMore recent studies tend to at least partially confirm such claims, also finding that politi-\ncal \"underdogs\" appear to be more active in fora like these (Larsson and Kalsnes, in\npress). Nevertheless, the effect of the Obama election in 2008 has been felt also in these\ncontexts, while such employments have had to be adapted to local characteristics\nBoth Norway (approximately 4.9 million inhabitants, parliament with 169 representa-\ntives) and Sweden (9 million, parliament with 349 representatives) represent the Nordic\nwelfare state model (Hilson, 2008). As such, both countries can be likened to what\nSartori (1990) labels a parliamentary system characterized by moderate pluralism--mul-\ntiple parties and limited centrifugal forces. Moreover, while individual politicians can\nplay important parts in these political systems, both countries can be described as party-\ncentered rather than candidate-centered (e.g. Enli and Skogerb\u00f8, 2013). Inspired by\nKalnes (2009), Table 1 presents the basic characteristics of the main political parties in\nNorway and Sweden, including results from the latest elections to have taken place at the\ntime of data collection.\nAs indicated by the penultimate column in Table 1, the 2009 Norwegian elections\nresulted in a victory for the ruling Left-Centre coalition, while the 2010 Swedish elec-\ntions saw a Right-Centre union taking office. Indeed, while ideological classifications\nlike these might simplify the complex nuances of political environments, this type of\npresentation does indeed make the type of comparative efforts undertaken here easier.\nMethod\nCollection and analyses of online data bring a number of different ethical challenges to the\nfore, especially when the research to be performed deals with issues of political prefer-\nences (Moe and Larsson, 2012). Contrasting with Twitter, while the \"generally public\nnature of tweets and replies\" (Bruns and Highfield, 2013: 671) makes research on that\nTable 1.

While our focus here lay on the Facebook activities\nof political parties and politicians seeking office, the need to protect their specific ideo-\nlogical persuasions could be seen as superfluous. Nevertheless, the privacy of each\nincluded politician must be respected. With such precautions in mind, the study focused\non the Facebook Pages related to each politician rather than their corresponding personal\nProfiles. While the former of these types of Facebook presences are geared toward \"public\nshowcase\"\u00adtype activity, the latter is more focused on activities related to a specific user's\nprivate sphere. Beyond ethical considerations, the focus of Facebook Pages has been\nencouraged by previous research (e.g. Gulati and Williams, 2013), supposedly because\nthe uses of the service at the hands of politicians could serve as an indicator of political\nprofessionalization (e.g. Vaccari and Nielsen, 2012). By focusing on Facebook Pages, the\nresults presented here can be compared with previous research findings.\nWhile more or less manual rationales for data collection have been successfully\nemployed to gather content from Facebook (e.g. Williams and Gulati, 2013), this study\nopted for an automated approach. Although automated approaches to various forms of\nanalyses are associated with certain difficulties (e.g. Lewis et al., 2013), similar\napproaches to data gathering allow for considerable ease in this stage of the research\nprocess (Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan, 2013). Given the exploratory quantitative outset of\nthe study, such an approach seemed appropriate. Specifically, data collection was per-\nformed by means of the Netvizz service (Rieder, 2013). In short, Netvizz allows for\narchiving of Facebook Page activity. Of specific interest here was the ability to gain\naccess to all posts authored by the Page owner, as well as the associated meta-data, such\nas likes and shares, during a specific time period. While such meta-data are the product\nof the clicks and actions by other Facebook users, the internal mechanisms of the plat-\nform at hand and the previous choices made by account holders could also be expected\nto play a part in how content is presented to each individual user (Bucher, 2012). In order\nto provide a comparably neutral starting point, a separate Facebook account was created\nfor the purposes of data collection only.\nThe sample for the study consisted of all major Norwegian and Swedish parties and poli-\nticians who operated a Facebook Page at the time of data collection--28 September 2013.\nGuided by Table 1, the sample included parliamentary seat holders, as well as those politi-\ncians and parties seeking such offices. Following Klinger (2013), the selection process was\nguided by selecting only those Facebook Pages that were officially sanctioned by each\nrespective party or politician. In order to cover a sufficient period of time, data were archived\nfrom 1 January 2013 until 27 September of the same year. As the Norwegian elections were\nheld on 9 September, the longitudinal data collected should provide a suitable starting point\nfor comparing the effect of an election year in one of our two case countries.\nResults\nWith regard to political parties, all identified actors--both in- and outside of parlia-\nment--had adopted the Pages feature at the time of data collection. As for individual\npoliticians with seats in parliament, 24% (N = 46) of Norwegian politicians had adopted,\nwhile data for the Swedish context indicated that 19% (N = 71) had taken similar\nmeasures. No significant relation could be found between country and rate of Facebook\nPage adoption (Cramer's V = .06, p > .05). As such, this very basic introductory notice\nindicates that if there indeed is an election year effect at work, it cannot be gauged by\nfocusing solely on adoption rates.\nAs an attempt to assess the permanence of activity undertaken by politicians on their\nof the same year. The figures feature a series of timelines denoting the number of posts\nmade on Pages operated by parties (represented by the black line), party leaders (gray\nline), and other politicians (dotted black lines) in Norway and Sweden, respectively. By\ndistinguishing between different types of actors, we can gauge the relative homo- or\nheterogeneity of Page activity throughout the examined period.\nWhile the obvious quantitative differences between the categories of political actors\nfound in Figures 1 and 2 should be taken into account, this mode of presentation allows\nus to assess the degrees of interdependence between these different actors. As social\nmedia services like the one under scrutiny here supposedly allow individual politicians\nto maintain a media platform of their own, different line shapes could indicate diverging\nonline endeavors. As the lines for both countries imply, such varying tendencies are\nrather limited. While the lines for the Swedish context appear shaped in a slightly less\nsimilar manner than for Norway, the general trend must be said to be one of similarity.\nParties, their leaders, and elected parliamentarians generally appear to follow the same\nrationales with regard to activity on their individual Facebook Pages--a result which\nbegs the question: what influences those rationales?\nFigure 1. Timelines representing Facebook Page posts by parties (black lines), party leaders\n(gray lines), and politicians (black dotted lines) per month in Norway.\nAs research on Twitter has found that political (e.g. Arag\u00f3n et al., 2013; Bruns and\nrelated to events in mainstream media, such tendencies are apparent also for Facebook\nPages. For Norway, the activity visibly increases as the month of August indicates the\nstart of the \"short campaign\"--the final weeks before Election Day on 9 September.\nFrom there on, we can identify at least three clear rises in the lines--each corresponding\nto debates (held on 12 and 20 August and 6 September, respectively) broadcast on the\nNorwegian public service broadcaster. Election day sees the absolute peak of use, after\nwhich the activity clearly diminishes.\nFor Sweden, the period leading up to July is not marked by any specific outbursts of\nactivity. As for Norway, the month of April features the Easter holiday, characterized by\na considerable decrease in activity. The month of July is of specific interest here, as this\ntime period features the Almedalen week. This annual event sees political elites gather in\nthe Almedalen park in Visby on the Gotland island right of Sweden's east coast. A staple\nin Swedish politics and societal debate since the 1960s, the event features debates, dis-\ncussions, and essentially serves as a meeting place for those holding power (e.g. Wendt,\n2012). This event yields the highest amount of activity for the Swedish case--after\nwhich the summer holidays appear to have a decreasing effect on the uses of Facebook.\nThe official opening of the Parliament at the beginning of September sees another high\npoint in the data, after which our collection period comes to a halt.\nOn a final note regarding the line graphs, we can note the difference in scale for the\ntwo countries. As previously mentioned, Sweden boasts a larger parliament in terms of\nFigure 2. Timelines representing Facebook Page posts by parties (black lines), party leaders\n(gray lines), and politicians (black dotted lines) per month in Sweden.\nrepresentatives than Norway. However, the intensity with which posts were made was\narguably more tangible in the Norwegian context. As the scale for Norway appears as\ndouble (maximum value is 400 posts) than that for the country which does not (maxi-\nmum value for Sweden is 200 posts), we can postulate an election year effect at work--\nindeed, as Election Day drew closer, this effect for Norway becomes even more tangible\nin comparison to Sweden.As such, permanence in campaigning appears as clearly related\nto an electoral event.\nWe turn now to look at the individual parties and politicians who distinguished\nthemselves as being particularly frequent posters throughout the studied time period.\nFigures 3 and 4 introduce bar charts featuring those users whose median number of posts\nper day was at least 0.5. While this demarcation could certainly be put into question,\nexpanded or diminished, it was deemed suitable in order to focus on those users who\nmade a clear mark in the political Facebook spheres in the two countries. By focusing on\nthese high-end users, we are able to tell if more established actors--such as incum-\nbents--or challengers--such as those seeking office--appear as more permanent in their\nuses of the Facebook platform.\nMuch like for Figures 1 and 2, a color scheme is employed in order to differenti-\nate between the types of actors identified in the bar charts. Black bars represent\nparties, dark gray bars denote party leaders, light gray bars identify ministers and\n\"celebrity politicians\" (e.g. Van Zoonen, 2005), whereas white bars show activity\nundertaken by members of parliament without specific portfolios or public profiles.\nEach actor is identified with name and party abbreviation (please refer to Table 1\nfor key) on the vertical axis, while the horizontal axis features a gauge for the medi-\nans measured.\nArild Stokkan-Grande (Ap)\nJonas Gahr St\u00f8re (Ap)\nTrine Skei Grande (V)\nKjersti Toppe (Sp)\nKnut Arild Hareide (Krf)\nJan Tore Sanner (H)\nHelga Pedersen (Ap)\nPer Sandberg (Frp)\nSiv Jensen (Frp)\nErna Solberg (H)\nKarin Yrvin (Ap)\nLiv Signe Navarsete (Sp)\nJens Stoltenberg (Ap)\nAudun Lysbakken (Sv)\nChristian Democrats (Krf)\nProgress Party (Frp)\nHeikki Holm\u00e5s (Sv)\nInga Marte Thorkildsen...\nGreen Party (MDG)\nLiberal Party (V)\nRed Party (R)\nPer Olaf Lundteigen (Sp)\nCentre Party (Sp)\nKristin Halvorsen (Sv)\nConservative Party (H)\nKarin Andersen (Sv)\nMette Hanekamhaug (Frp)\nLabour Party (Ap)\nSocialist Left Party (Sv)\nFigure 3. Norwegian political actors with a median of posts per day reaching at least 0.5.\nWith these guidelines for interpretations in place, we can notice a few differences\nbetween the case countries. First, scale size again appears as more far-reaching for the\nNorwegian case (Figure 3) than for the Swedish (Figure 4), reaching a maximum value\nof 3 Page posts per day (2 posts per day in Sweden). Moreover, while 29 Norwegian\npolitical actors emerge as highly active using our current rationale, the number for the\nSwedish context is 20. As such, while the differences pertaining to scale might not be as\nevident as in Figures 1 and 2, this could be interpreted as yet another sign of the sug-\ngested \"election year effect.\"\nSecond, focusing on Norway, the accumulation of black bars--indicating the activity\nof political parties--in the top half of Figure 3 suggests the need for parties to mobilize\nduring an election year. While sizeable organizations like the Labour Party and the\nConservatives clearly make their mark on Figure 3, we can also discern smaller parties--\nboth those who enjoyed seats in parliament (such as the Socialist Left, Liberal or Center\nParties) and those on the outside (such as the Red and Green Parties). As such, Figure 3\nshows that while large political actors are making their presence felt, we can also discern\nrepresentatives of comparably small political actors among these ardent Page users.\nThird, if the bars in Figure 3 are slightly tinted toward black and dark gray, indicating\nthe activities of parties and their leaders, a somewhat dissimilar tendency can be dis-\ncerned when focusing on the Swedish. Specifically, while all Norwegian parties placed\nthemselves in upper part of the corresponding graph, their Swedish equivalents appear\ndispersed throughout Figure 4. Moreover, while all Norwegian parties made marks in the\nresults, three parties with representation in the Swedish parliament--Left Party,\nConservatives, and the Sweden Democrats (Sd)--did not make use of the Pages feature\nto such a degree. As such, the trends of election year influences are visible also here.\nStefan Attefall (Kd)\nErik Ullenhag (Fp)\nMaria Larsson (Kd)\nStefan L\u00f6fven (S)\nSocial Democrats (S)\nAnna Troberg (PP)\nPirate Party (PP)\nVeronica Palm (S)\nBino Drummond (M)\nLiberal Party (Fp)\nCarl Bildt (M)\nChristian Democrats (Kd)\nGreen Party (Mp)\nBj\u00f6rn Samuelson (M)\nCaroline Szyber (Kd)\nJonas Sj\u00f6stedt (V)\nAnnie L\u00f6\u00f6f (C)\nMarta Obminska (M)\nCentre Party (C)\nMeeri Wasberg (S)\nFigure 4. Swedish political actors with a median of posts per day reaching at least 0.5.\nAs permanence does not necessarily equal influence, we need to assess the reach of\nthe Facebook Page activities undertaken. For these purposes, we focus on the median\nshares and likes per post by each actor. As both measurements individually provide\ninsights into the relative popularity of posts, the combination of the two should be help-\nful in this regard. The results are presented as two scatter graphs--Figure 5 (Norway)\nand Figure 6 (Sweden).\nThe color scheme used previously is employed also for Figures 5 and 6. Starting\nwith the Norwegian case, Figure 5 finds the node representing the official party\naccount for the right-wing populist Progress Party (Frp)--as well as the node cor-\nresponding to their party leader, Siv Jensen--to be among the political actors enjoy-\ning the highest medians of likes and shares per Facebook Page posts. While a more\nrigid evaluation of the contents of the posts made is not possible within the article,\nJensen's most popular posts tend to focus on so-called negative campaigning--cri-\ntiquing her peers as well as certain media outlets, who she claims misrepresent the\nagenda championed by herself and her party. The posts made by PM Jens Stoltenberg,\nwho likewise enjoys a sizeable amount of popularity, are typically geared toward\nmore traditional campaigning materials. For example, a staged campaign commer-\ncial featuring Stoltenberg as an undercover taxi driver, chit-chatting with unsus-\npecting passengers, gained an especially large amount of traction in terms of shares\nand likes.\nJan\nTore\nSanner\n(H)\nLiv\nSigne\nNavarsete\n(Sp)\nHeikki Holm\u00e5s (Sv)\nPer Olaf\nLundteigen (Sp)\nKarin\nAndersen\n(Sv)\nStine Renate H\u00e5heim\n(Ap)\nAudun Lysbakken (Sv)\nSocialist\nLeft Party (Sv)\nTrine\nSkei\nGrande\n(V)\nTrond Giske (Ap) Hadia Tajik (Ap)\nSvein Fl\u00e5tten (H)\nKnut Arild Hareide (Krf)\nChristian\nDemocrats (Kd)\nHanna Elise Marcussen\nKarl Eirik Schj\u00f8tt-\nPedersen (Ap)\nLiberal Party (V)\nConservative Party (H)\nCentre Party (Sp)\nRed Party (R)\nPer Sandberg (Frp)\nErna Solberg (H)\nJonas Gahr St\u00f8re (Ap)\nLabour Party (Ap)\nGreen Party (MDG)\nJens Stoltenberg (Ap)\nProgress Party (Frp)\nSiv Jensen (Frp)\nShares\nLikes\nFigure 5. Relationship between median shares (vertical axis) and median likes (horizontal axis)\nper post for Norwegian Political Facebook Pages. Logarithmic scales are presented.\nMoving on, all political party accounts save for two (Socialist Left and Christian\nDemocrats) are positioned above the horizontal dividing line. As for the two parties\nbelow the horizontal line, these are both small parties in terms of voter share. This sug-\ngested that relationship between ballot recognition and Facebook Page post popularity is\nperhaps particularly interesting when considering the case of the Socialist Left Party. As\nshown in Figure 3, their official party account produced the highest yield of Page posts\nduring the studied period, while Figure 5 shows that their reach in terms of Likes and\nShares was comparably limited. While party size probably plays a role here, a quick\nglance at their most popular posts reveals that they can mostly be characterized as pro-\nviding information on policy issues--perhaps not the type of content most likely to \"go\nviral.\" As a small Party, albeit with seats in government and a role as incumbents going\ninto the 2013 elections, the Socialist Left Party appears to have had some difficulty in\ngetting their messages across on Facebook.\nThis finding on the activities of an incumbent but small party on the left side of the\nNorwegian political spectrum can be contrasted with the spread that other accounts,\noperated by somewhat similar parties, appear to have enjoyed. Consider the nodes repre-\nsenting the Green and Red Parties--both without representation in parliament. As visible\nin Figure 5, these parties appear to have hosted comparably popular Facebook Pages,\nresulting in corresponding nodes placed in the middle of the figure. Furthermore, both\nparties seem to have utilized the platform primarily with mobilization in mind--their\nrespective posts largely urge followers to vote green or red, or for them to convince\nFredrik Lundh\nSammeli (S)\nPer Bill\n(M)\nStefan Attefall (Kd)\nCaroline Szyber (Kd)\nErik Ullenhag (Fp)\nBino\nDrummond\n(M)\nMarta\nObminska\n(M)\nMeeri\nWasberg (S)\nAnna\nTroberg\n(PP)\nChristian Democrats\n(Kd)\nVeronica Palm (S)\nGreen Party\n(Mp)\nRoland Utbult\n(Kd)\nFredrik Reinfeldt (M)\nBj\u00f6rn Samuelson (M)\nGustav Fridolin (Mp)\nLeft Party (V)\nSocial\nDemocrats (S)\nH\u00e5kan Juholt (S)\nConservative\nParty\n(M)\nPirate Party (PP)\nJimmie \u00c5kesson\n(Sd)\nJonas\nSj\u00f6stedt\n(V) Stefan L\u00f6fv\u00e9n (S)\nSweden Democrats\n(Sd)\nShares\nLikes\nFigure 6.

Taken together, this indicates that while party size appears to hold\nexplanatory power regarding the online coverage enjoyed by parties, smaller, non-\nincumbent parties are indeed able to get their message across on Facebook.\nThis tendency of comparably popular non-parliamentary parties is discernible also in\nthe Swedish case, as depicted in Figure 6. Consider the node representing the Pirate\nParty, whose placement in the graph indicates a median of shares per post on par with\nmajor parties like the Social Democrats or the Conservatives. The most popular posts\nmade by the two latter parties typically feature quotes from party leaders or comments on\nvarious current events. In contrast, the Pirate Party appears as more thematically focused\nin the postings made, mainly discussing their key issues--such as online integrity and\ncopyright law. The findings that two of the parties in the right-wing coalition governing\nSweden (the Liberal Party and the Centre Party) are not present in Figure 6 could be\nanother indication of the previously mentioned election year effect--especially when\nconsidering that all Norwegian parties were present as visible in the corresponding fig-\nure. With regard to the most popular Facebook Pages, we see another tendency repeated\nfrom the Norwegian context. Much like the Frp appears to have produced a series of\nposts yielding high amounts of both Likes and Shares, so do the right-wing populist Sd\nseem to enjoy a similar status in the Swedish context. However, when one considers the\nchange in scale on the vertical axis, representing the median of shares per post--0\u00ad100\nshares for Norway, 0\u00ad1000 shares for Sweden--the dominance of the Sd in this regard is\nfurther affirmed. With regard to the content, their most shared and liked posts commonly\ndeal with their controversial stance on immigration and suggestions regarding the sup-\nposed \"Islamization\" of Sweden and various Swedish practices. As such, far right parties\nappear to have succeeded in getting their message across through Facebook in both coun-\ntries, while this tendency is arguably more affirmed in the Swedish context.\nDiscussion\nThe results presented in this exploratory study have provided important insights into how\nan impending parliamentary election influences the permanence of social media activity\nat the hands of political actors--and the reach that this activity appears to have among\nFacebook users. By utilizing a comparative effort between two similar countries--\nNorway and Sweden--the study has attempted to uncover what has been tentatively\nlabeled as the \"election year effect.\" While the intricacies of intra-Scandinavian relation-\nships can surely offer up a selection of societal or systemic discrepancies, the argument\nis made here that the political systems of the two case countries are similar enough to be\nmeaningfully included in a comparative study such as the one presented in this article.\nThe uncovering of differences and similarities with regard to the permanence of polit-\nical campaigns can be operationalized in different ways. This study employed a struc-\ntural quantitative approach, opting for three main modes of structural analyses of patterns\nof communication presented in Figures 1 to 6. First, for the line graphs presented in\nFigures 1 and 2, the suggested election effect is discerned as the scale needed to fit the\nFacebook Page activity undertaken by the smaller Norwegian populace of politicians is\ndouble the size of the scale representing the activities of their more plentiful Swedish\ncolleagues. While differing scales were perhaps probable, the difference in size between\nthe two parliaments might have been expected to provide a potential balancing influence.\nInstead, the members of the smaller Norwegian Stortinget made extensive use of their\nFacebook Pages when compared to those politicians holding seats in the larger Swedish\nRiksdag. Furthermore, as pointed out previously, while Figures 1 and 2 do not present\ncomparable data between each identified group in both countries, the shapes of the lines\ncan tell us something about the degree to which Page activity by parties, party leaders,\nand other politicians is symbiotic--or if it differs in ways that would indicate dissimilar\nonline agendas of different types of actors. Such divergent modes of use must, however,\nbe described as limited. Tendencies from similar studies of Twitter use (e.g. Arag\u00f3n et\nFacebook, indicating that political content in the mainstream media produces clearly vis-\nible activity \"spikes\" in the timelines. As suggested by Lilleker and Jackson (2010), such\na finding implies that social media services largely take on a role that \"reflects and ampli-\nfies other events [...] rather than start[s] them\" (Lilleker and Jackson, 2010: 93). As line\npatterns are characterized by differing scale sizes between countries, as well as internal\nresemblance for each country viewed in isolation, this is interpreted as strengthening for\nthe normalization hypothesis with regard to permanence of campaigning. Specifically,\nthe findings presented in Figures 1 and 2 indicate that Facebook activity by political\nactors can largely be described in terms of \"politics as usual\" (e.g. Margolis and Resnick,\n2000)--the activity appears as closely related to broadcast media programming in gen-\neral and to preparation for political events (such as the Norwegian elections or the\nAlmedalen week) in particular.\nDiffering scale sizes again come into play when assessing the bar charts representing\nhighly active political actors presented in Figures 3 and 4, uncovering common charac-\nteristics of such zealous users. The color scheme employed suggests a limited tendency\nfor relatively lesser-known politicians to be more active in this regard. Moreover, influ-\nences of age can be discerned--comparably younger politicians, such as Mette\nHanekamhaug (Norway) and Marta Obminska (Sweden) make use of the service at a\nlevel that in some cases parallel party accounts (see also Larsson and Kalsnes, in press).\nAnother trend suggests that smaller political parties make use of their Facebook Pages at\nlevels that sometimes match the activity of more sizeable competitors. Indeed, while\nrepresentatives from major parties can likely rest assure that mainstream media attention\nwill be directed toward them (e.g. Vergeer and Hermans, 2013), smaller parties can\nattempt to compensate for their comparably limited access to such media outlets by uti-\nlizing online services to higher degrees (e.g. Bruns and Highfield, 2013). In so doing,\nthey would hopefully harness the \"new media logic\" (e.g. Klinger, 2013)--the success-\nful application of which supposedly results in reinforced ties between parties and pre-\nsumable voters. For permanence of campaigning, the results presented must be described\nas mixed--although perhaps slightly geared toward affirmation of the equalization\nhypothesis, as comparably less established actors appear to be more ardent in their appli-\ncations of the platform at hand--a finding especially valid, it seems, for the Norwegian\ncontext.\nThe ways in which these activities--be they permanent or not--spread and gain\nmomentum also need to be taken into account. Attempts to assess these qualities as\nplayed out on Facebook were presented in Figures 5 and 6. The results suggest that minor\nparties and actors were not only comparably more ardent in posting to their Facebook\nPages--it would also appear that they succeeded in gaining online support as their posts\nwere shared and liked at levels sometimes corresponding to the spread enjoyed by more\nestablished political actors. As such, it seems that much like political actors representing\nminor parties are resolute in using their Facebook presences, so do their supporters make\nclear efforts to spread the word on the platform at hand. While studies have attempted to\nrelate social media activity by parties with received vote share (e.g. Tumasjan et al.,\n2010), the findings presented here suggest that these relationships are too complex to be\nunderstood in such terms. While minor parties are seeing their messages being spread\nacross Facebook in both countries, this tendency is arguably clearer in the Norwegian\ncontext, where both the Red and Green Party, respectively, take their places among those\nparties enjoying considerable amounts of redistribution.\nThe popularity of the Norwegian Green Party can be seen as a case in point. Indeed,\nprevious scholarship often suggests that environmentalists took to the web earlier and to\nhigher degrees (e.g. Strandberg, 2009)--perhaps as a result of such parties catering to\ntheir mostly \"educated and middle class\" (Gibson, 2004: 109) voters. While the medians\nof shares and likes per post by the Swedish Green Party (Mp) as pictured in Figure 6\nmust be described as limited at best, their Norwegian counterpart (MDG) appears as\nmore popular in Figure 5. However, while the former of these two parties was firmly\nseated in parliament with a large share of the vote at the time of data collection, the latter\ndid not enjoy such status. As such, the aforementioned suggested influence of party size\nmust not be forgotten.\nFor both case countries, the parties whose messages enjoy the widest range are the\nright-wing populist Frp and Sd. As Frp turned out to be part of the right-wing coalition\nwinning the 2013 Norwegian elections, and as Sd enjoy a sizeable share of the Swedish\nvote, these parties cannot be understood as minor actors. Nevertheless, the activity\nundertaken by the parties themselves is shown here to be rather restricted. Referring back\nto Figures 3 and 4, while the activity undertaken by the Frp places them in the middle of\nthe figure, their Swedish counterpart did not make use of their Facebook Page to degrees\nthat would even include them in this display. Nevertheless, the comparably few posts\nmade by these parties--especially the Sd--appear as among the most popular ones in the\nresults presented in Figures 5 and 6. While the design of this study does not allow for any\nqualitative analyses as to why these comparably controversial parties enjoy such immense\npopularity on Facebook, a tentative starting point from which to investigate further could\nbe the positioning of both parties in their respective political context. While the previ-\nously discussed smaller parties could be described as marginalized in terms of size, these\ntwo populist right-wing parties could be seen as marginalized in terms of being propo-\nnents of stigmatized ideology. The policy issues favored by both parties often challenge\nthe popular consensus held around matters of immigration, foreign policy, and the rights\nof religious minorities. With no other apparent similarities at hand, the results presented\nhere suggest that marginalization of different kinds would lead to a highly active voter\nbase. While political actors who are in some way marginalized might not be among the\nmore permanent users of Facebook, they appear as comparably more successful in hav-\ning their posts redistributed throughout Facebook than their more established or main-\nstream counterparts.\nIn sum, then, it would seem that while the longitudinal distribution of Facebook posts\nlargely corresponds to the curriculum set by the mass media and the \"congressional cal-\nendar\" (Golbeck et al., 2010), detailing the actual users--and their apparent support-\ners--behind these time-spanning data paints a more detailed picture. While the methods\nemployed for data collection and analysis employed in this article can provide a struc-\ntural overview of Facebook Page use at the hands of politicians, this article suffers from\ntwo main limitations that need to be duly addressed. First, the utilized design does not\nallow for insights regarding the contents of the Pages studied. As this article provides\n\"the bigger picture\" of events like these, future studies might find it useful to employ a\nvariety of qualitative methods in order to provide researchers and practitioners alike with\nricher insights into the uses of social media for permanent--or maybe not so perma-\nnent--campaign efforts. Second, as already mentioned, the inner workings of the\nFacebook platform need to be assessed more clearly in relation to how content is shown\ndifferently for different users. For example, the ever-changing popularity of the pages\nthemselves could be expected to have influence over the degree to which certain posts\nare made visible on the timelines of platform users. As such, while the \"snapshot\" design\nof the study at hand could prove useful for comparative efforts with future elections, a\nfocus on the algorithms guiding Facebook content flows could also be feasible.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nAnduiza E, Cantijoch M and Gallego A (2009) Political participation and the Internet: a field\nArag\u00f3n P, Kappler KE, Kaltenbrunner A, et al.
