We replicated the existing full-scale ISEL subscale structure in this short version.\nIn addition, subscale scores were found to differ across gender, race, level of educational attainment, and marital status,\nalthough the magnitude of the various effects was modest. Correlations with another established measure of social support\nprovide convergent validity for this abbreviated instrument.

Its mechanisms have been considered\nfrom a number of theoretical perspectives, including the\nhealth beliefs model (Montgomery et al., 1989) and social\ncognitive theory (Bandura, 1994), among others. Research\nhas identified the importance of diverse supportive func-\ntions, including receiving practical information, obtaining\ndirect assistance, feeling accepted by others, and other\nstress-buffering aspects, which then appear to influence\nimmune function, mood, coping, and health behaviors\nLess consensus exists regarding the specific dimensions\nor types of support most likely to affect health outcomes. The\nvarious ways in which support has been defined and opera-\ntionalized across studies has prompted calls for greater spec-\nificity in defining the social support construct. This would\npermit the evaluation of the unique contributions of specific\nFishbein, Triandis, Kanfer, Becker, & Middlestadt, 2001;\nMermelstein, Cohen, Lichtenstein, Baer, & Kamarck, 1986).\nThe emerging literature documenting differences in social\nsupport across population subgroups is germane to these\nconsiderations. Perhaps the most extensively studied dimen-\nsion is gender. For example, men tend to respond more nega-\ntively to support than women (Nagurney, Reich, & Newsom,\n2004), but men may be more receptive to certain types of\nsupport when attempting to modify health-related behaviors,\nsuch as smoking (Westmass, Wild, & Ferrence, 2002).\nWomen tend to derive greater benefit later in life as a func-\ntion of their broader support systems relative to men (Gurung,\nTaylor, & Seeman, 2003). These studies highlight that type,\ntiming, and receptivity to support may be critical issues in\ndetermining the ultimate impact of supportive activities.\n1University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA\n2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Morgantown,WV, USA\n3GV Sonny MontgomeryVeterans Affairs Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nThomas H.

ARIC is a prospective, population-based investigation\nof the natural history of cardiovascular disease and associ-\nated risk factors in a cohort of European Americans and\nAfrican Americans in four U.S. communities. Participants\ncompleted the ISEL-SF, a short version of the Interpersonal\nSupport Evaluation List (ISEL), which assesses the per-\nceived availability of functional social support resources,\nthat is, those supportive functions afforded by social rela-\ntionships (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983; Cohen, Mermelstein,\nKamarck, & Hoberman, 1985). In the current study, we\nsought to confirm the factor structure of the ISEL-SF as well\nas examine differences in subscale scores across gender,\nrace, and other demographic characteristics. This study is a\nnecessary precursor to an investigation of the relationship\nbetween the ISEL-SF and health outcomes in the ARIC\ncohort, as it will provide important data regarding scale char-\nacteristics and population subgroup differences.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe design of the ARIC study has been described previously\nwomen and men aged 45 to 64 were recruited from probabil-\nity samples in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County,\nNorth Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi (African Americans\nonly); suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington\nCounty, Maryland. Geographic and racial/ethnic balance,\ncensus borders, and potential for community member par-\nticipation were considered in selecting the four communi-\nties. The initial examination, which included a variety of\nphysical, vascular, medical, and psychosocial measures, was\nFollow-up examinations were conducted approximately\nevery 3 years through 1999.

The ISEL-SF was included in the study protocol\nas an index of perceived social support. The original 40-item\nscale contains four theoretically derived subscales that mea-\nsure conceptually distinct dimensions thought to buffer the\neffects of stressful events (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983). An\ninitial factor analysis provided evidence for a four-factor\nmodel, with moderate intercorrelations noted among sub-\nscale scores (Brookings & Bolton, 1988). Because multiple\nsocial, psychological, and health assessment instruments are\nincluded in the clinical examination components of large\nepidemiological studies such as ARIC, the time burden for\nparticipants must be considered. Consequently, it is often\nimpractical to administer lengthy questionnaires. To reduce\nthe survey time burden for ARIC study participants, a short\nform was derived from the original ISEL scale. The ISEL-SF\nconsists of 16 items drawn from the full scale. The items\nselected were those that possessed the highest factor load-\nings within each of the four subscales from the original anal-\nysis of the full ISEL instrument (Brookings & Bolton, 1988).\nThe short form was constructed by the original ARIC\ninvestigators as four 4-item subscales, consistent with the\noriginal instrument. These four subscales are (a) Appraisal\nSupport (AP)--the perceived availability of someone to dis-\ncuss issues of personal importance, (b) Tangible Assets\nSupport (TA)--the perceived availability of material aid, (c)\nBelonging Support (BE)--the perceived availability of oth-\ners to interact with socially, and (d) Self-Esteem Support\n(SE)--the perceived availability of others with whom one\ncompares favorably. The ISEL-SF also yields an aggregate\nindex of social support (TOT), ranging from 0 to 48, with\nhigher scores indicating greater perceived social support.\nThe ISEL-SF was modified from a true\u00adfalse response for-\nmat to a 4-point rating scale (definitely true, probably true,\nprobably false, and definitely false; scored 0-3), presumably\non an assumption of improved response sensitivity.\nLubben Social Network Scale (LSNS). The 11-item LSNS\nassesses structural components of social support (Lubben,\n1988). Items address the number of family and friends and\nfrequency of contact. The total score ranges from 0 to 50,\nand includes five subscales (not examined in this study). The\nrelationship between the LSNS and ISEL-SF was examined\nto provide an index of convergent validity.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 8.2\n(SAS Institute, 1999). Factor analyses were performed using\nPayne et al. 3\na confirmatory approach for estimation and assessment of\nmeasurement models (Hatcher, 1999). All groupwise com-\nparisons for continuous dependent variables were performed\nusing ANOVA and ANCOVA, as appropriate. These analyses\nwere performed using the SAS general linear models proce-\ndure (SAS Institute, 1999), with zero/one dummy coded\nvariables for multilevel categorical covariates.\nResults\nThe average age of the current sample was 57 years, 55.4%\nwere female, 24.7% were African American, 78% completed\nat least high school, and 79% were married (Table 1).\nInternal Consistency\nCronbach's alpha was calculated as an index of internal con-\nsistency, yielding an overall value of 0.83, suggesting a high\ndegree of interrelatedness among items. Indices for each\nracial subgroups yielded negligible differences.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)\nCFA was performed using the SAS covariance analysis of\nlinear structural equations procedure (SAS Institute, 1999).\nIn the original factor analysis for the long form (Brookings\n& Bolton, 1988), it was noted that items demonstrated an\nextreme negative skew. This was also confirmed for the\npresent data set with estimates of skew ranging from -0.06\nequal to -1.25. To overcome these departures from normal-\nity, we used the asymptotically distribution free (ADF) esti-\nmation method appropriate for large (N > 5,000) nonnormal\ndata sets. The CFA model was estimated, allowing the four\nlatent factors related to the instrument subscales to covary\nwithout restriction. The model fit the data quite well, with fit\nindices as follows: root mean square error of approximation\n2 displays the path coefficients for each item. Table 3 reports\nthe correlations among the linear composite subscales, as\nwell as the estimated latent subscales (see Tables 2 and 3).\nUsing the maximum likelihood (ML) method for perform-\ning the CFA resulted in a less optimal model fit than the ADF\nmethod. The ML method resulted in an RMSEA estimate\nas typically desired to infer good model fit. The ML method\nresulted in a smaller GFI estimate (0.897) than that of theADF\n(0.919). Other fit indices included the following: Adjusted\nGoodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.8878 (greater than or equal\n(greater than or equal to 0.9 means good fit).\nDemographic Characteristics\nCorrelations between subscale scores and age were either\nnonsignificant or significant but of very low magnitude (r <\n.10). We then analyzed data for gender differences, racial\ndifferences, and Gender \u00d7 Race interaction effects. Women\nand there were no differences on AP (p > .15). Race \u00d7\nGender interactions were evident for TOT and all subscales\nexcept TA (Table 4 displays details and post hoc compari-\nsons). For AP, BE, and TOT, European American women\ngenerally reported the highest levels of support, followed by\nAfrican American men, African American women, and\nTable 1.

Comparison of intraracial correla-\ntions revealed higher values for European Americans than\nAmericans, structural and functional components of support\nappear to be more highly interrelated, relative to African\nAmericans.\nDiscussion\nIn large studies, practical considerations of participant bur-\nden often require compromises in the breadth and depth of\nthe assessments conducted. Brief measures with established\npsychometric properties are necessary and invaluable. In the\nARIC study, an abbreviated version of the ISEL was\nincluded as a measure of perceived functional social support\nbased on existing data attesting to the reliability and validity\nof the original scale. The current findings provide support\nfor the ISEL-SF in that (a) the four-factor structure of the\noriginal scale was replicated, (b) it was found to be inter-\nnally consistent, and (c) differences across important popu-\nlation subgroups were identified. The primary limitation of\nthis short form is that the small number of items precludes\nthe capacity to score the tertiary (third tier) subscales that are\navailable in the full-scale version.\nWith respect to reliability, the internal consistency esti-\nmates obtained indicate a set of items that are highly inter-\nrelated for the overall scale, and moderately so for subscales.\nGiven available data on the original ISEL, this was expected\nand confirmed. In addition, the moderate level of intercor-\nrelation across subscales suggests the presence of somewhat\nindependent dimensions of perceived support.\nIt would have been useful to validate the ISEL-SF against\nthe full-scale ISEL, but this was not possible.Acknowledging\nthis limitation, it is noteworthy that the four-factor solution\nof the original ISEL scale (Brookings & Bolton, 1988) was\nreplicated using CFA in the present study despite substantial\nmethodological differences, including (a) length of the scale\n(16 vs. 40 items), (b) response format (true\u00adfalse vs. 4-point),\nistics (college students vs. middle-aged, population-based).\nIn addition, the large pool of participants consisting of\nAfrican and European American men and women across\neducational levels and marital categories from different geo-\ngraphic locations strengthens the validity and generalizabil-\nity of our findings.\nNotable racial and gender differences emerged. Consistent\nwith previous research, women endorsed higher overall lev-\nels of support compared with men. Subscale differences sug-\ngest that women prefer to draw support from trusted\nindividuals and those available for social interaction (AP and\nBE). However, men appeared to preferentially value support\nfrom those perceived as similar or from whom necessary\nresources were available (SE and TA).\nPrevious research has raised the possibility that the mod-\nerating effects of social support on health outcomes may be\ndifferentially related to gender and race, as well as the influ-\nence of specific support dimensions (Berkman et al., 1993;\nBrownley, Light, & Anderson, 1996). In the current investi-\ngation, European Americans indicated higher levels of over-\nall support, including higher TA and BE; SE was higher for\nAfrican Americans. Examination of interaction effects\nrevealed interesting subgroup differences (Table 4) that sug-\ngest the value of further exploration. Finally, the differential\nmagnitude of subscale intercorrelations across race suggests\nthat structural and functional facets of support operate more\nindependently for African Americans relative to European\nAmericans. It is unclear why this may be the case, or under\nwhich circumstances this may be advantageous. One broad\npossibility is that such an organization may confer greater\nflexibility in the utilization of support resources. Alternately,\nrace may play a role in determining the nature and degree of\ncommunity cohesiveness and support. These observations\nand tentative explanations await confirmation from further\nresearch.\nHigher levels of education were positively associated\nwith all types of support, again confirming previous work.\nSimilarly, results related to marital status suggest that being\nmarried is associated with higher levels of AP, TA, and SE\nsupport scores, as would be expected. The lack of difference\nacross marital subgroups on BE seems reasonable as well, as\nthis type of support may be derived primarily outside the\nmarriage. A somewhat anomalous finding was that divorced\nindividuals scored as high on SE support as married indi-\nviduals. It may be that those who have ended a relationship\nperceive they possess the personal resources necessary to\n\"move on.\"\nWhile the characteristics of the ISEL-SF are promising, it\nis important to consider that the constructs tapped by the\nISEL-SF (and original ISEL) are limited. A comprehensive\nevaluation of social support on health and health outcomes\nmust also address complementary constructs such as struc-\ntural support, negative support, social isolation, and other\nConclusion\nThe results of this study provide support for the utility of the\nISEL-SF as a brief, internally consistent instrument that\ndiscriminates among individuals of varying demographic\ncharacteristics. The large, diverse sample studied permits a\nhigh degree of confidence in the stability of the results. The\nfull scale and subscales possess adequate internal consis-\ntency to suggest reliable measurement of key constructs,\nwhile the results of the CFA and evidence of a moderate\ncorrelation with another measure of social support attest to\nvalidity of the instrument. Finally, the brief form of this\nPayne et al. 7\ninstrument underscores its value for inclusion in studies\nwhere time is of concern. Future studies are required to\ndetermine whether the ISEL-SF is associated with health\noutcomes, and to elucidate the relative contribution of the\nspecific support dimensions addressed.\n"
