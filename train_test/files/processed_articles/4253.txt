    "abstract": "Abstract\nSelf-regulation has become a widely discussed subject in education as it facilitates learners' ability to master their own\nlearning. The purpose of the present study is to examine the psychometric properties of self-regulation in second language\nlearning via Rasch measurement. A total of 528 high-school students from an East Asian country participated in the study,\nand the Self-Regulating Capacity in English Language Learning (SRClang) Scale was used as a self-report instrument. The\nresults suggest that self-regulation in second language learning as measured by the SRClang Scale does not appear to be\nunidimensional. Based on item-model fit statistics, several items in the SRClang Scale may need to be revised or removed.\nNonetheless, the response categories in the SRClang Scale function well as intended, and the scale can reliably separate\nitems and persons based on their difficulty levels and ability trait levels, respectively. Overall, the SRClang Scale serves as an\nappropriate measure of self-regulatory capacity in second language learning.\n",

Studies on self-regulation, particularly on its\nrole in learning, have been prolific since the mid-1980s\n(Zimmerman, 2001). The rationale behind the increasing\nemphasis on the importance of self-regulated learning can be\nattributed to the common awareness among researchers and\npractitioners that learners' self-regulatory capacity greatly\nenhances their performance outcomes.\nSelf-regulation is defined as a state of learning that involves\nlearners' metacognition, strategic action, and motivation to\nlearn (Butler & Winne, 1995; Perry, Phillips, & Hutchinson,\nSeveral researchers have investigated the effectiveness of self-\nregulated learning in various content areas, such as mathemat-\nics (De Corte, Mason, Depaepe, & Verschaffel, 2011) and\nscience (Sinatra & Taasoobshirazi, 2011). The empirical evi-\ndence generally supports that learners who take initiatives to\nset realistic learning goals and subsequently achieve the goals\nby utilizing proper learning strategies tend to have more satis-\nfactory performance outcomes than their peers.\nDespite that self-regulated learning has been examined in\nnumerous educational settings and has proven to be effective\nin facilitating learning processes, few empirical studies have\nbeen conducted in the context of second language learning.\nGiven that self-regulatory capacity is a crucial characteristic\nfor learners to maintain confidence and motivation even\nwhen faced with obstacles, the importance of its role in\nenhancing the process of second language learning becomes\napparent. One of the first attempts at investigating self-regu-\nlation in second language learning is a study done by Tseng,\nD\u00f6rnyei, and Schmitt (2006). In their work, Tseng et al.\nintroduced a new instrument, the Self-Regulating Capacity\nin Vocabulary Learning (SRCvoc) Scale, to measure second\nlanguage learners' self-regulation in the context of vocabu-\nlary learning.\nThe theoretical conceptualization of the SRCvoc Scale,\nproposed by D\u00f6rnyei (2005), is formed on the basis of Kuhl's\ncontrol theories. Each descriptor in the SRCvoc Scale is\ndesigned to fit into one of the five categories in D\u00f6rnyei's\n(2005) taxonomy of self-regulation. The categories include\ncommitment control, which helps learners preserve their\ncommitment to the learning goals; metacognition control,\nwhich allows learners to monitor their own learning behavior\nto concentrate and avoid procrastination; satiation control,\nwhich helps learners minimize boredom in learning; emotion\ncontrol, which helps learners manage their emotions during\nthe learning process; and environmental control, which\nallows learners to facilitate learning by putting themselves in\n1Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nHeidi Han-Ting Liu, Teachers College, Columbia University, Box 66, 525\nEmail: han-ting.liu@tc.columbia.edu\nMeasuring Self-Regulation in Second\nLanguage Learning: A Rasch Analysis\nHeidi Han-Ting Liu1 and Young-Sun Lee1\n Keywords\nself-regulation, second language learning, Rasch analysis\n2 SAGE Open\na positive learning environment. With empirical evidence\nfrom a series of elaborate statistical analyses, the SRCvoc\nScale was shown to serve as a useful instrument for the mea-\nsurement of self-regulation in vocabulary learning. Tseng\net al. (2006) further concluded that second language learners'\nself-regulatory capacity in vocabulary learning can be attrib-\nuted to all five traits outlined by the self-regulation taxon-\nomy (i.e., commitment control, metacognition control,\nsatiation control, emotion control, and environment control)\nas initially conceptualized.\nWhile the SRCvoc Scale allows for the investigation of the\nunderlying traits of second language learners' self-regulatory\ncapacity in vocabulary learning, several researchers have\npointed out that the scale has not been fully \"utilized and vali-\ndated\" in other aspects of second language learning (Mizumoto\nstand the role of self-regulation in second language learning in\na more generalized manner, Liu (2009) adapted Tseng et al.'s\n(2006) SRCvoc Scale and developed the Self-Regulating\nCapacity in English Language Learning (SRClang) Scale, a\nquestionnaire that can be used to collect information regarding\nlearners' self-regulatory capacity in their overall second lan-\nguage learning experience. The results in general indicated\nthat the revised form of the SRCvoc Scale (i.e., the SRClang\nScale) can be reliably applied to the context of English lan-\nguage learning. The detailed findings in terms of the underly-\ning traits of self-regulation, however, differed from those\nshown in Tseng et al. While Tseng et al. suggested that the\nunderlying traits of self-regulation in vocabulary learning con-\nform to the five controls conceptualized in the scale (commit-\nment control, metacognition control, satiation control, emotion\ncontrol, and environment control), Liu found that the construct\nof self-regulation in the SRClang Scale only answers to one\npsychometric property. In other words, the underlying trait of\nself-regulation in second language learning appears to be uni-\ndimensional in nature.\nNevertheless, it is important to note a major limitation to\nthe analysis conducted by Liu (2009): There was no confir-\nmatory statistical procedure beyond exploratory factor anal-\nysis to further validate the claim of the unidimensionality of\nself-regulation as suggested by the SRClang Scale. In an\nattempt to compare factor analysis and Rasch measurement,\nWaugh and Chapman (2005) found that with the same sets of\ndata, Rasch measurement suggests less certainty in score\nreliability and construct dimensionality than factor analysis\ndoes, calling into question the statistical inferences made\nfrom factor analysis. Given that Rasch models have been\nconsidered a confirmatory type of measurement (Christensen,\ndimensionality as well as item fit, the present study aims to\nreexamine the psychometric properties of the SRClang Scale\nusing Rasch measurement. Specifically, item-model fit,\nresponse category use, dimensionality, appropriateness of\nitem difficulty level for sample, and reliability measures (i.e.,\nseparation reliability and separation index) were analyzed to\nhave a more holistic view of the underlying trait(s) of self-\nregulation as depicted in the SRClang Scale.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 528 English language learners from an East Asian\ncountry participated in the present study. Excluding the\nThe participants were recruited from 15 intact 10th- and\n11th-grade classes in three public high schools. All of the\nparticipants had been learning English as a foreign language\nas a required course for a minimum of 5 years when the pres-\nent study was administered. In general, the participants'\nEnglish proficiency level as a group could be considered\napproximately at the B1 level of the Common European\nFramework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).1\nInstrument\nThe SRClang Scale (Liu, 2009) was used to collect the data\nconcerning second language learners' self-regulatory capac-\nity in English learning. Considering that the present study\nwas conducted in an English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL)\nlearning context, the items were translated into the partici-\npants'native language to avoid construct-irrelevant variables\nintroduced by the participants' second language proficiency\n(for the detailed procedure of questionnaire adaptation and\nReduced with empirical evidence from the original\nSRClang item bank (k = 33), the finalized form of the\nSRClang Scale has 27 items. A 4-point Likert-type scale of\n\"disagree,\" \"slightly disagree,\" \"slightly agree,\" and \"agree\"\nwas used, and the participants were asked to check the appro-\npriate box that best describes their English learning experi-\nences. A summary of the SRClang Scale and its item-control\ntaxonomy correspondence is provided in Table 1.\nData Coding\nThe participants'responses to the items in the SRClang Scale\nwere coded in accordance with the arranged Likert-type\nscale as described in the \"Instrument\" section. To be more\nspecific, \"disagree\" was coded as 1, \"slightly disagree\" as 2,\nand 27 were reverse-coded due to the negative nature of the\nitem descriptions.\nData Analysis\nThe Rasch model. Conventionally, the Rasch model (Rasch,\n1960) is used to estimate the conditional probability that a\nperson j endorses an item i, given the person's ability and the\nitem's difficulty level for dichotomously scored items:\nLiu and Lee 3\nP uij\nj i\nj i j i\n=\n( ) =\n+\n=\n+\n-\n- - -\ne\ne e\n( )\n( ) ( )\n,\n \n   \nwhere P(u\nij\n= 1) indicates the probability for a person j to\nrespond correctly to, or to be in agreement with, an item i. \nj\nisthelatenttrait(orability)parameterofpersonj ( , , , ),\nj n\nand \ni\nis the difficulty parameter for item i ( , , , )\ni k\nillustrate, when person j's ability parameter and item i's dif-\nficulty parameter are equivalent (i.e., \nj\n= \ni\n), the probability\nestimate of person j obtaining the correct response to, or\nagreeing with item i, is .5. When person j has a greater ability\nlevel than item i requires (i.e., \nj\n> \ni\n), person j's probability\nof answering item i correctly or agreeing with item i is greater\nthan .5. The Rasch model places the person parameter and\nthe item parameter on the same metric of logits for the esti-\nmation of person ability and item difficulty. To meet the\nRasch requirement of invariance of comparisons, the rela-\ntionship between the parameters should be linear (Bond &\nThe rating scale model (RSM).Because the Rasch model is\nspecifically used for dichotomous items, an extension of the\nRasch model, the RSM (Andrich, 1978; Wright & Masters,\n1982), is used to generalize the Rasch analysis to polytomous\nresponses. The RSM dictates that, for the items with m\ni\nresponse categories, the item category response function is\nPix\ni i\nj\nx\ni i\nj\nx\nx\nm\n=\n- -\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- -\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n\ne\ne\n  \n\n \ni\ni\n\n,\nwhere   \n- - =\n=\n ( )\ni i\nj\nx\n0. The equation describes the\nprobability of person n choosing a specific category x on a\nparticular item i. RSM is characterized by two parameters:\nitem location parameter, i , and category intersection\nparameter, i ; the former can be interpreted as the relative\ndifficulty of an item, whereas the latter represents the cate-\ngory threshold parameter, which is assumed to be constant\nacross all items in the RSM. Therefore, each item in the RSM\nis described by a single parameter i on the latent trait scale.\nGiven that the SRClang Scale uses a 4-point Likert-type\nscale, the RSM is suitable for analyzing the SRClang data\nbecause both assume constant thresholds for each item,\nwhich is a common characteristic found in scales that mea-\nsure personality or attitude (Lee, Grossman, & Krishnan,\n2008). Such scales have two features: The relative difficul-\nties of steps within items should remain constant (Embretson\n& Reise, 2000), and the psychological distances between\nresponse categories (e.g., disagree and slightly disagree,\nslight disagree and slightly agree) should be assumed the\nsame for all items (Fox & Jones, 1998). The described fea-\ntures fit the underlying assumptions in the construction of the\nSRClang Scale.\nThe SRClang Scale was analyzed for the properties of the\nitem-model fit, response category, adherence to the unidi-\nmensionality assumption, appropriateness of item difficulty\nlevel for the sample, and reliability. Items were reverse-\ncoded when necessary before performing the analysis.\nWINSTEPS (Linacre, 2005b) was used to conduct the Rasch\nanalysis. As the proportion of the missing data was minimal\n(<0.19%), WINSTEPS was able to treat the raw score and\nthe counts of nonmissing observations as sufficient statistics\nand perform estimations accordingly.\nItem-model fit. The item fit statistics show how well the items\nfit the model. To determine whether the assumption of unidi-\nmensionality of the SRClang Scale was met in the Rasch\nmodel, the values of the item fit mean square (MNSQ) statis-\ntics were calculated to investigate the extent to which each\nitem represented the underlying construct.\nThe infit (weighted) and outfit (unweighted) MNSQ sta-\ntistics were used to measure the fit of the items. While infit\nstatistics are sensitive to abnormal patterns within the obser-\nvations made by persons on the items that match their ability\nlevels, outfit statistics are sensitive to outliers as well as\nabnormal patterns within the observations made by persons\non the items that do not match their ability levels (Linacre,\n2005b). Ideally, the MNSQ value in the Rasch model should\nbe 1.0, indicating that the item fits the model perfectly.\nHowever, perfect fit does not always happen. For an RSM,\nresearchers generally consider a range between 0.6 and 1.4 to\nbe acceptable MNSQ values (Lee et al., 2008; Linacre,\nconsidered misfitting if its MNSQ value falls out of this\nTable 1. Summary of the SRClang Scale.\nConstruct Control taxonomy No. of items Item number\nNote. SRClang = Self-Regulating Capacity in English Language Learning.\n4 SAGE Open\nrange. Items that are underfitting suggest that high levels of\nnoise or other variance are introduced in the data; such items\n\"may distort or degrade the measurement system\" (Wright &\nindicate that the model predicts the data too well; such items,\nwhile not degrading, are potentially problematic because\nthey \"may produce misleadingly good reliabilities and sepa-\nResponse category use. In Rasch measurement, response cat-\negory use is examined via category use statistics (i.e., cate-\ngory frequencies, average measures) and the thresholds of\neach category. The average measure for each category is the\nempirical mean of the ability of the people who respond in\nthat category (Linacre, 2005a). The thresholds are boundar-\nies between categories, representing the measures where\nadjacent categories are equally probable. If response catego-\nries are appropriately used, that is, higher and lower catego-\nries are responded to by persons with higher and lower\nability estimates, both the average measures and the thresh-\nolds should increase monotonically as the response catego-\nries ascend.\nItem difficulty level. Rasch analysis produces maps of persons\nand items to graphically illustrate how item difficulty levels\noverlap with person ability trait levels. Rasch model esti-\nmates item difficulty parameters and person ability trait lev-\nels using \"logits\" (i.e., log-odd units), and logits \"form an\ntures allow the two parameters to be compared at the same\ntime for the purpose of determining whether the scale's item\ndifficulty matches the ability level of the person. If the item\ndifficulty level of the scale is appropriate for the sample of\npersons, there would be a sufficient amount of overlap on the\nmap when comparing the parameters of items and persons.\nReliability measures.Statistics of separation reliability and\nseparation index for both persons and items are measures of\nreliability in Rasch measurement (Wright & Masters, 1982).\nSeparation reliability estimates show the degree to which the\nscale is able to differentiate persons or items on the measured\nvariables; it is the Rasch equivalent to Cronbach's alpha for\nRSMs. The values of separation reliability should range\nbetween 0 and 1, with .8 or greater being acceptable (Fox &\nJones, 1998). Separation index estimates show the spread of\npersons or items on the measured variables. The separation\nindex provides a measure of separation in standard error\nunits and should be at least 2 to indicate adequate separation\nfor persons, items, or both.\nDimensionality.Rasch-residual-based principal components\nanalysis (PCA) was performed to investigate the dimension-\nality of the SRClang Scale.As explained by Linacre (2005a),\nPCA decomposes the item correlation matrix based on stan-\ndardized residuals, or the differences between the observed\nand the hypothesized, so that other potential dimensions\nmay be identified. It is also considered \"a standard proce-\ndure of dimensionality checking\" in Rasch measurement\nunidimensional, one commonly acknowledged rule of\nthumb is that the model needs to have a variance of at least\n60% accounted for by the Rasch dimension in its first factor\nof the PCA (Linacre, 2005a). The second dimension, or the\nfirst contrast in the residuals, indicates whether there are any\npatterns in the differences within the residuals large enough\nto suggest multiple dimensions. To be considered a possible\nsecond dimension, the secondary dimension should have the\nstrength of at least three items, as measured by its Eigen-\nvalue, that represent more than 5% of the unexplained vari-\nance. Smith (2002) proposed that, for RSMs, having a first\nEigenvalue greater than 1.5 is considered a violation of uni-\ndimensionality under the research condition of 500 persons\nand 30 items. Given that the present study has more than\n500 participants and close to 30 items, it is plausible to also\nadopt the 1.5 Eigenvalue cutoff-point criterion in the inves-\ntigation of dimensionality.\nResults\nItem-Model Fit\nThe item-model fit for the SRClang Scale was measured by\ninfit (weighted) and outfit (unweighted) MNSQ statistics. In\nthe initial stage of item-model fit analysis, the decision of\nremoving misfitting items with MNSQ values larger than 1.4\nfor further analysis was made, as these underfitting items\nintroduced an undesired amount of unpredictable random-\nness in the data and could not provide sufficiently meaning-\nfulinformation.Threeitemswereidentifiedtobeunderfitting:\nItem 1, Item 19, and Item 21. The detailed description of\neach misfitting item is presented in Table 2.\nFor the analysis to be more \"Rasch-compliant\" (Wright &\nporarily removed from the SRClang Scale, leaving 24 items\nfor analysis. The remaining items were refit to the model to\ninvestigate whether their MNSQ values fell in the range of\nmisfitting in the refit SRClang model; therefore, they were\ntaken out from the SRClang Scale, leaving 21 items in the\nfinal version of the scale for subsequent analyses. Table 3\nshows the descriptions of the misfitting items in the second\nrefit model, and Table 4 presents the item-model fit statistics\nand the item descriptions of the remaining items.\nThe refit item-model fit statistics as shown in Table 4\nindicate that, after removing the misfitting items, the MNSQ\nvalues of all of the remaining items were in the acceptable\nrange of 0.6 and 1.4. The mean of the infit MNSQ value of\nthe SRClang model is 1.00 (SD = 0.19) and that of the outfit\nthe items in the scale fit the model well.\nLiu and Lee 5\nResponse Category Use\nThe SRClang Scale used a 4-point Likert-type scale. To deter-\nmine whether the categories (i.e., disagree, slightly disagree,\nslightly agree, agree) were used as intended, diagnostics of the\nuse of the rating scale response categories were performed.\nThe properties of the response categories of the SRClang\nscale are presented in Table 5. The frequencies in all category\nresponses exceeded the recommended minimum number of\nsures and the threshold estimates both increased with the cat-\negories, indicating that they were functioning properly. Both\ninfit and outfit MNSQ statistics for each category were\nbetween 0.8 and 1.2 (less than 2.0), suggesting that the cate-\ngories provided adequate information rather than noise that\nwould have brought misinterpretation (Linacre, 1999).\nFigure 1 shows the category probability curve, illustrating\nthe probability of responding to a specific category given the\ndifferences in estimates between person trait scores and item\ndifficulties. The threshold corresponds to the intersected\npoints where one category probability curve meets the one\nfor the adjacent category. The hill-shaped category probabil-\nity curves show that all categories were used as intended.\nAppropriateness of Item Difficulty Level for\nSample\nThe map of persons and items for the SRClang Scale is\nshown in Figure 2. Both item difficulty level and person\nlatent trait level are arranged from the highest to the lowest.\nThat is, respondents with higher levels of self-regulatory\ncapacity as well as items measuring more demanding behav-\niors of self-regulation are at the top of the map, whereas\nrespondents with lower levels of self-regulatory capacity and\nitems measuring less demanding behaviors of self-regulation\nare at the bottom of the map.\nGenerally speaking, Figure 2 shows that the range of item\ndifficulties appears to overlap with the person's range of\nlatent trait scores, suggesting that the items in the SRClang\nScale were able to measure respondents with varying levels\nof self-regulatory capacity. Therefore, the difficulty levels of\nthe items were mostly appropriate for the sample, and the\nscale was able to provide meaningful information to distin-\nguish respondents with different levels of self-regulatory\ncapacity. It should be noted, however, that there were a num-\nber of respondents whose trait levels were much higher or\nlower than any of the items could measure. The item that\ndemands the most self-regulatory capacity, Item 11 (\"When\nit comes to learning English, I have my special techniques to\nprevent procrastination\"), has a difficulty value of 0.63; and\nthe item that demands the least self-regulatory capacity, Item\n3 (\"When I am studying English and the learning environ-\nment becomes unsuitable, I try to sort out the problem\"), has\na difficulty value of -0.54. However, excluding the extreme\ndata, the person with the highest self-regulatory capacity has\nan estimated ability level at 3.34 and the lowest at -3.39. The\ndifferences of the maximum and minimum values between\nperson trait scores and item difficulties indicate that the\nSRClang Scale may not be able to provide sufficient infor-\nmation for persons at the higher and lower ends of the self-\nregulation continuum. In addition, several items (Items 2, 8,\nthe same level of person latent trait.\nReliability Measures\nThe summary of person and item reliability estimates is\nshown in Table 6.

The empirical evidence appears to suggest that remov-\ning the misfitting items did not significantly affect the dimen-\nsionality of the scale. Because the unidimensionality of the\nscale could not be determined by the first factor Eigenvalue,\nthe PCA statistics of the unexplained variance were investi-\ngated. In the second revision of the scale where six misfitting\nitems were excluded from the analysis, the first contrast of the\nunexplained variance had an Eigenvalue of 2.3, which is\ngreater than the 1.5 cutoff point proposed by Smith (2002). To\nbe more specific, the unexplained variance in the first contrast\nconsisted of an amount that is equivalent to the weight of two\nto three items and accounted for 6.2% of the unmodeled data.\nBecause the Eigenvalue of the first contrast was close to 3.0\nand accounted for slightly over 5% of the variance, there was\nno sufficient empirical evidence to support the unidimension-\nality of the SRClang Scale. Figure 3 illustrates the PCAresults\nof the final revision of the SRClang Scale. The horizontal axis\n(x-axis) is the Rasch dimension showing the difficulty of the\nitems; the vertical axis (y-axis) is the factor loadings on the\ncontrast (i.e., unexplained variance). Items with a substantial\namount of unexplained variance have higher factor loadings,\nand thus appear on the top of the y-axis. Bond and Fox (2007)\nsuggested that a secondary dimension may exist when the\nitems are clustered in a clear pattern. From Figure 3, two items\nappear to be substantially positively correlated with the first\ncontrast (loadings > 0.60): Item 11 (Metacognition Control)\nand Item 10 (Commitment Control). Another two items have\nsubstantial negative loadings with the factor: Item 23 (Emotion\nControl) and Item 25 (Emotion Control). This indicates that,\nwhile a secondary dimension of the SRClang Scale may exist\nbased on PCA of Rasch residuals, its robustness and nature\nneed further investigation.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe main purpose of this study was to investigate the psycho-\nmetric properties of the SRClang Scale and to further exam-\nine the unidimensionality of self-regulation in second\nlanguage learning via Rasch measurement. Specifically, the\nRSM was used to examine the adequacy of response category\nuse, appropriateness of item difficulty level for the sample,\nreliability of person and item separation, and dimensionality.\nThe initial item-model fit analysis revealed several misfit-\nting items that were unable to provide meaningful informa-\ntion for the model. For the purpose of maintaining the\nprecision of the results, the misfitting items--Items 1, 17, 19,\nquent analyses.\nWhen taking a closer look at the descriptions of the mis-\nfitting items, it is observed that the items do not belong to\nany specific action control taxonomy. To elaborate, each of\nthe five action and volition controls has at least one misfit-\nting item, suggesting that the performance of the items was\nnot particularly affected by any specific control. However, it\nshould be noted that, out of the six misfitting items, five of\nthem describe negative learning behaviors: being impatient,\nbeing upset, giving up halfway, procrastinating, and being\ndistracted. Although additional empirical data need to be col-\nlected for confirmation, it is highly possible that the\nFigure 1. Category probability curves for the SRClang Scale.\nNote.

In addition, researchers have started to\nrecommend that social science questionnaires avoid the use\nof negative wording due to the fact that respondents tend to\ndisagree with items that describe negative behaviors to be in\naccordance with social desire or preference (J.

Each \".\" represents one to three responses. SRClang = Self-Regulating Capacity in English Language Learning.\nLiu and Lee 9\nand then reexamine whether the items in the revised SRClang\nScale can well represent the underlying traits of each action\nand volitional control.\nThe results of the persons and items map indicate that\nthere were respondents who demonstrated both higher and\nlower levels of self-regulatory capacity (person latent trait)\nthan the items were able to measure. In the SRClang Scale,\nthe item that describes the most demanding self-regulatory\ncapacity in second language learning (Item 11) is related to\nlearners' metacognition control, whereas the item that\ndescribes the least demanding self-regulatory capacity (Item\n3) belongs to learners' environment control. However, the\nscale in general shows no clear pattern regarding the corre-\nspondence between the items' difficulty levels and their con-\ntrol taxonomy; therefore, the nature of what makes one\nself-regulation behavior more demanding than another can-\nnot be determined at this point. In addition, several items\nseem to be functioning in a similar manner, thus serving as\nrepetitive measures. For example, the map shows that Items\nlevel, and among them, Items 8, 15, and 16 are three of the\nfour items that describe satiation control. In other words,\nItems 8, 15, and 16 are likely to function so similarly that\nlittle new information could be extracted from individual\nitems. While the current items in the SRClang Scale can\nappropriately differentiate learners with various levels of\nself-regulatory capacity, items that can measure person\nability trait at both the higher and lower ends of the self-\nregulatory capacity continuum are needed to fulfill construct\nrepresentation. Furthermore, items that function similarly\nshould be reexamined and reduced if necessary, so that the\nscale can be more concise.\nLiu (2009) employed exploratory factor analysis to examine\nthe SRClang Scale, and the factor loadings indicated that self-\nregulation in second language learning appeared to answer to\none single factor. However, the dimensionality analysis through\nRasch measurement in the present study was unable to support\nLiu's previous finding. The variance of the first factor in the\nscale did not reach the suggested 60% for the scale to be con-\nsidered unidimensional. Furthermore, the unexplained vari-\nance of the first contrast accounted for slightly over 5% with an\nEigenvalue of 2.3, indicating that there might be a second\ndimension in the model. The Rasch-residual analysis also iden-\ntified four items with considerably high correlations--two\npositively, two negatively--with the potential second dimen-\nsion. Although not all four items are under the same control\ntaxonomy, the items seem to share a common trait of describ-\ning learners'ability to perform strategic actions:\nItem 10: When learning English, I persist until I reach the\ngoals that I make for myself.\nItem 11: When it comes to learning English, I have my\nspecial technique to prevent procrastination.\nItem 23: When I feel stressed about learning English, I\nknow how to handle the stress.\nItem 25: When learning English, I know how to manage\nmy personal emotions to make the learning efficient.\nIt is possible that learners' ability to manage their own\nlearning behaviors with strategies constitutes a second\ndimension of self-regulation. While such an explanation is\npotentially reasonable, it still needs further investigation.\nBoth theoretical foundation and empirical evidence are\nrequired to fully understand the nature of the potential\nsecond dimension in self-regulation in second language\nlearning.\nEven though the underlying construct of self-regulation in\nsecond language learning as measured by the SRClang Scale\nmay not be unidimensional, the dimensionality analysis in\nthe present study only detected a possible second dimension.\nSuch a finding suggests that the five action and volitional\ncontrols as originally conceptualized in the SRCvoc Scale\n(Tseng et al., 2006) may not all contribute to self-regulatory\ncapacity in second language learning. In fact, a similar claim\nhas been empirically supported by Mizumoto and Takeuchi's\n(2012) replication study. In their study, Mizumoto and\nTakeuchi adapted Tseng et al.'s (2006) SRCvoc Scale and\napplied it to a Japanese EFL setting (i.e., Japanese students\nlearning English as a foreign language). They found that\nwhile the SRCvoc Scale can serve as a reliable measure of\nself-regulatory capacity in vocabulary learning in a Japanese\ncontext, the underlying traits of self-regulation only\naccounted for three controls (emotion, metacognition, and\nenvironment), as opposed to the five controls proposed by\nTseng et al. While Mizumoto and Takeuchi (2012) attributed\nthe differences in the dimensions of self-regulation to \"cul-\ntural differences or item parceling\" (p. 90), it is likely that the\nunderlying traits of self-regulation are more parsimonious\nthan initially proposed. However, because Mizumoto and\nTakeuchi only focused on vocabulary learning instead of lan-\nguage learning in general, its generalizability might be\nrestricted when it comes to determining whether there indeed\nexists a second dimension in the SRClang Scale, and if so,\nwhat the exact nature of self-regulation in second language\nlearning is. Meanwhile, the SRClang Scale still demonstrates\nproper response category use, high reliability in item and\nperson separation, as well as appropriate item difficulty level\nfor the sample; therefore, it can be considered an adequate\ninstrument.\nTable 7.

Based on\nthe results of the present study, the unidimensionality of self-\nregulation indeed cannot be established. Nonetheless, the\nanalyzed scale underwent several modifications, and word-\ning in the scale descriptors has been identified early in the\nanalysis process as a potential construct-irrelevant variable.\nIn addition, although not conventionally recommended by\nRasch analysts, the analysis did not compare models that dif-\nfered in their dimensionality specifications. Therefore, a\nmore complete investigation of the data would reveal whether\na unidimensional model works better than a theory-informed,\nmultidimensional one.\nThe study also carries several other limitations. As seen\nfrom the results, the SRClang Scale was unable to suffi-\nciently measure learners with either higher or lower levels\nof self-regulatory capacity. In addition, the participants were\nrather homogeneous in terms of their background, resulting\nin the evidence being limited to this particular sample of\nsecond language learners. Based on the limitations of the\npresent study, two directions for future research are pro-\nposed: First, there is a need to determine, from a theoretical\nperspective, what traits constitute more (or less) demanding\nself-regulation behaviors and add items accordingly to the\ncurrent scale to provide more useful diagnostics for learners\nwith extremely high or low levels of self-regulatory capac-\nity. Second, participants with more diverse backgrounds\nshould be recruited, so that the results can be more valid and\nmore generalizable.\nIn conclusion, the SRClang Scale at its current state\nserves as an appropriate scale to provide diagnostic infor-\nmation for second language learners regarding their self-\nregulatory capacity in English learning. Second language\nteachers may use the information to provide proper assis-\ntance to students based on their self-regulatory capacity and\ntheir needs. For second language learners who wish to\nachieve a certain outcome by learning on their own, having\na better understanding of their own self-regulatory capacity\ncan help them monitor and evaluate their learning progress.\nIt is also hoped that the present study contributes to the cur-\nrent understanding of the role self-regulation plays in sec-\nond language learning.\n"
