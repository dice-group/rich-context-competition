    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe affective profiles model is based on the combination of individuals' experience of high/low positive affect and high/low\nnegative affect: self-fulfilling, high affective, low affective, and self-destructive. We used the profiles as the backdrop for the\ninvestigation of individual differences in malevolent character traits (i.e., the Dark Triad: psychopathy, Machiavellianism,\nAmazons' Mechanical Turk (MTurk), responded to the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule and the Dark Triad Dirty\nDozen. Individuals with a high affective profile reported higher degree of narcissism than those with any other profile,\nand together with individuals with a self-destructive profile, also higher degree of Machiavellianism and psychopathy than\nindividuals with a low affective and self-fulfilling profile. Males scored higher in Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Together\nwith earlier findings, our results show that while individuals in both the self-fulfilling and high affective profiles are extrovert\nand self-directed, only those in the high affective profile express an immature and malevolent character (i.e., high levels of all\nDark Triad traits). Conversely, individuals in the self-fulfilling profile have earlier reported higher levels of cooperativeness\nand faith. More importantly, the unique association between high levels of positive emotions and narcissism and the unified\nassociation between negative emotions to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism imply a dyad rather than a triad of\nmalevolent character traits.\n",

Indeed, there is extensive evi-\ndence that positive and negative affect are best thought as two\nindependent dimensions of the affective system (for a review,\nposits that the function of positive affect is related to approach-\nrelated behavior, which builds an individual's resources for\nsurvival and well-being, while negative affect inhibits behav-\nior that might lead to pain or punishment. Positive affect is a\ndimension that varies from pleasant engagement (e.g., enthu-\nsiastic and active) to unpleasant disengagement (e.g., sad and\nbored). The negative affect dimension, on the other hand,\nmoves from unpleasant engagement (e.g., anger and fear) to\npleasant disengagement (e.g., calm and serene; Watson &\nthere is evidence that rather than being completely indepen-\ndent, the two affectivity dimensions might be interrelated in a\ntwo-dimensional circumplex model containing not only\narousal (vertical axis) but also a valence dimension (horizon-\nIn the context of personality, positive and negative affect\ndimensions are strongly associated with extraversion and\n1Blekinge Center of Competence, Karlskrona, Sweden\n2University of Gothenburg, Sweden\n3Network for Empowerment and Well-Being, Sweden\n4University of Bor\u00e5s, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nDanilo Garcia, Network for Empowerment and Well-Being, Axel W.\nEmail: danilo.garcia@icloud.com\nThe Dark Side of the Affective\nProfiles: Differences and Similarities\nin Psychopathy, Machiavellianism,\nand Narcissism\nand Patricia Rosenberg3\n Keywords\naffective profiles model, Dark Triad, Machiavellianism, narcissism, negative affect, personality, positive affect, psychopathy,\nunification argument, uniqueness argument\n2 SAGE Open\nneuroticism, respectively. For example, individuals who\nscore high on extraversion attend and react more intensely to\npositive stimuli than individuals with low levels of positive\naffect (i.e., introverts). In contrast, individuals who score\nhigh on neuroticism attend and react more intensely to nega-\ntive stimuli than individuals with low levels of negative\naffect (i.e., emotionally stable individuals; Larsen & Ketelaar,\n1991). However, sensitivity to negative stimuli is best pre-\ndicted by measures of being a neurotic introvert (i.e., being\nhigh in harm avoidance or high in neuroticism and low in\nnovelty seeking or low in extraversion), whereas sensitivity\nto positive stimuli is best predicted by being a stable extra-\nvert (i.e., being high in novelty seeking or high in extraver-\nsion and low in harm voidance or low in neuroticism; Corr,\nHence, positive and negative affect represent general biobe-\nhavioral systems: positive affect is related to the Behavioral\nActivation System (BAS) or sensitivity to reward as well as\napproach motivation, while negative affect is related to the\nBehavioral Inhibition System (BIS) or sensitivity to signals\nof punishment as well as avoidance motivation (Gray, 1981;\nFollowing this line of thinking, Archer and colleagues\nhave developed four affective profiles: self-fulfilling (high\npositive affect, low negative affect), high affective (high posi-\ntive affect, high negative affect), low affective (low positive\naffect, low negative affect), and self-destructive (low positive\naffect, high negative affect; see for example, Adrianson,\nAncok, Ramdhani, & Archer, 2013; Archer, Adolfsson, &\nKarlsson, 2008; Archer, Adrianson, Plancak, & Karlsson,\nBeninger, Kostrzewa, & Archer, 2008; Palomo, Kostrzewa,\nBeninger, & Archer, 2007). A person with a self-fulfilling\nprofile shows high self-acceptance, high autonomy, purpose\nin life, high energy, and internal locus of control (i.e., agency),\npositive relations with others, and helpful behavior (i.e., com-\nmunion), and also seek support in faith (i.e., spirituality),\nwhile a person with a self-destructive profile experiences low\nlevels in all these variables (e.g., Archer & Garcia, 2014,\ndefines as feeling good (i.e., happiness), doing good (i.e.,\nmature and actively virtuous living), physical health (i.e.,\nabsence of disease or infirmity), and prosperity (i.e., success,\ngood fortune, and flourishing). As the affective profile model\nis person-centered (Garcia, 2015; Garcia, MacDonald, &\nArcher, 2015), it is possible to discern differences between\nprofiles at the extreme ends of the model (i.e., self-destructive\nvs. self-fulfilling, low affective vs. high affective), but also\nwithin individuals that differ in one affectivity dimension and\nare similar in the other (i.e., self-destructive vs. high affective,\nself-destructive vs. low affective, low affective vs. self-fulfill-\ning, and high affective vs. self-fulfilling). In other words, the\naffective profile model provides the advantage of studying\nmultidimensional profiles of specific combinations of traits,\nbecause it allows the understanding of the experience in an\nindividual who is \"adapting within his or her biopsychosocial\ncontext\" (Cloninger & Zohar, 2011, p. 25; see also Cloninger\nMore recently, researchers (e.g., Garcia, 2012; Garcia,\nKerekes,Andersson-Arnt\u00e9n, &Archer, 2012; Garcia, Sch\u00fctz,\nferences between profiles with regard to personality mea-\nsures using models such as the Big Five model (Costa &\nMcCrae, 1992) and Cloninger's psychobiological model\n(Temperament and Character Inventory; Cloninger, Svrakic,\n& Przybeck, 1993). As hypothesized by these researchers,\nindividuals with a self-fulfilling profile scored high in self-\ndirectedness, high in cooperativeness, high in persistence,\nhigh in extraversion, high in self-regulatory strategies\ndefined as locomotion or a \"just-do-it\" mentality, and happi-\nness-increasing strategies related to agency (e.g., frequently\nexercising, active leisure, goal-pursuit), communion (e.g.,\nhelping others, receiving help from others), and spirituality\n(e.g., seek support in faith). In contrast, individuals with a\nself-destructive profile scored high in reward dependence,\nhigh in neuroticism, high in self-regulatory strategies defined\nas assessment or inaction, and happiness-increasing strate-\ngies focused on suppression and rumination (e.g., suppres-\nsion of negative thoughts, rumination of negative\nexperiences). Moreover, individuals with a high affective\nprofile were higher in reward dependence, higher in self-\ntranscendence, higher in self-directedness, high in persis-\ntence, high in extraversion, and high in both locomotion and\nassessment. In contrast, individuals with a low affective pro-\nfile were high in self-directedness, high in harm avoidance,\nand high in the self-regulatory strategy of assessment.\nTaken together, these results suggest that individuals with\na high positive affect profile (i.e., self-fulfilling and high\naffective) share certain personality features, but that individ-\nuals with a high affective profile also share features with\nindividuals with a self-destructive profile. For example, indi-\nviduals with a high affective profile are goal-directed, hard\nworking, and agentic (i.e., high in self-directedness, high in\npersistence) as individuals with a self-fulfilling profile, but\nas individuals with a self-destructive profile they are also\nlow in autonomy (i.e., one aspect of agency), pessimistic and\ntend to worry (i.e., high in neuroticism), are highly depen-\ndent on external appraisal (i.e., high in reward dependence),\nand ruminate about their ability to achieve goals (i.e., high in\nassessment). Other important differences between the indi-\nviduals with a self-fulfilling and those with a high affective\nprofile are, for example, that individuals with a high affec-\ntive profile do not score high in helpful behavior, tolerance\ntoward others, and empathy (i.e., communion and coopera-\ntive traits). Individuals with a self-fulfilling profile are, for\ninstance, the only ones who report that they seek support in\nfaith as one strategy in their own pursue of the happy life\nGarcia et al. 3\nHowever, individuals with a high affective profile score\nhigher than individuals with low negative affect profiles (i.e.,\nlow affective and self-destructive) in self-transcendence (i.e.,\na spiritual trait partially defined as the ability to sense a unity\nwith something bigger than the self; Cloninger, 2004; Garcia,\nTo expand the personality constructs that define each of\nthe affective profiles, the present study aims to investigate\ndifferences between profiles in Dark Triad traits (i.e., psy-\nchopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism). The Dark\nTriad traits are, for instance, suggested to expand the Big\nFive personality model (Veselka, Scherme, & Vernon, 2012),\nthat is, one of the personality models in which we have dis-\ncerned differences between affective profiles. Thus, differ-\nences among profiles in their level of Dark Triad traits will\nalso expand the current understanding of the affective pro-\nfiles model. In addition, the affective profiles differ in per-\nsonality traits using Cloninger's psychobiological model,\nwhich is related to the Big Five model but yet a distinctive\nmodel of personality that measures character traits (Garcia,\nAnckars\u00e4ter, et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge,\nCloninger's psychobiological model has not been used in\nconjunction with the Dark Triad. Hence, using the affective\nprofiles model to map the Dark Triad traits in conjunction\nwith earlier discerned personality differences among affec-\ntive profiles in two different personality models might con-\ntribute to the debate of the Dark Triad as three distinctive\ntraits (i.e., uniqueness argument; for example, Jones &\nVickers, & Harris, 2008) or as one global trait (i.e., unifica-\ntion argument; for example, Jonason, Li, & Teicher, 2010;\nJonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009; Jonason & Webster,\nexpectations and the implications of these relationships in\nthe context of Cloninger's biopsychosocial model of person-\nality, we briefly present the Dark Triad and how individuals'\nBig Five personality traits are related to their malevolent\ntraits.\nThe Dark Triad: Psychopathy,\nMachiavellianism, and Narcissism\nPaulhus and Williams (2002) coined the term Dark Triad\nwhen they identified three clusters of personality traits at a\nsubclinical level within the normal population: psychopathy,\nMachiavellianism, and narcissism. Psychopathy refers to\nhigh impulsivity, thrill-seeking, and low empathy and anxi-\nety (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). The Machiavellian person-\nality includes manipulative behaviors and deception for\nself-benefit (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006). Individuals high in\nMachiavellianism are cynical, misanthropic, cold, prag-\nmatic, and show immoral beliefs, and detached affect\n(Rauthmann & Will, 2011). Individuals high in narcissism\nshow exaggeration of self-worth and importance, superiority\nover others, and are manipulative toward others yet they\nhave a fragile sense of the self (Ames, Rose, & Anderson,\n2006). They show vanity to an extreme, are constantly seek-\ning attention, and harbor feelings of entitlement they do not\ndeserve (Lee & Ashton, 2005). In other words, these traits\nare at the conceptual level different from each other (i.e., the\nuniqueness argument). Nevertheless, previous research has\nshowed that the three traits have low to moderate correla-\ntions with one another (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006; Lee &\nWilliams, for example, reported positive intercorrelations\nbetween narcissism and psychopathy, and between\nMachiavellianism and psychopathy. There was also a low\nintercorrelation between narcissism and Machiavellianism.\nAlthough these results have been replicated in some studies\n(e.g., Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006), they have not been repli-\ncated in others (e.g., Vernon et al., 2008). In addition, some\nstudies report stronger correlations between the dark traits,\nwhile others report weaker correlations (e.g., Jakobwitz &\nVernon et al., 2008). Hence, there is a wide range of mixed\nresults on how interrelated the dark traits actually are.\nIn line with the uniqueness argument, however, individu-\nals high in narcissism stand apart by their high scores on self-\nenhancement (Furnham, Richards, & Paulhus, 2013; Jones &\nPaulhus, 2011). Self-enhancement, for instance, has been\nassociated with extrinsic spiritual behavior (Sedikides &\nGebauer, 2010), that is, spiritual behavior adopted as a means\nto an end (Allport & Ross, 1967). Individuals high in psy-\nchopathy, on the other hand, are different from individuals\nscoring high in the others Dark Triad traits because they also\nscore high on impulsivity (Jones & Paulhus, 2011).\nNevertheless, individuals high in levels of each of the Dark\nTriad traits share also high levels of agency and low levels of\ncommunion (Jones & Paulhus, 2011; Paulhus & Abild,\n2011), which supports the unification argument.\nIndeed, research on the Dark Triad shows these traits cor-\nrelate with aggression, bullying, and racism, that is, antago-\nnistic behaviors in interpersonal situations (i.e., low\ncommunion). High levels of psychopathy, for example, are\npositively related to direct (i.e., physical or verbal) and indi-\nrect aggression (i.e., gossiping, spreading rumors; Douglas,\nBore, & Munro, 2012; Muris, Meester, & Timmermans,\n2013), high levels of Machiavellianism are positively associ-\nated with both forms of aggression but more strongly to indi-\nrect aggression, and narcissism is positively linked to direct\nforms of aggression (Kerig & Stellwagen, 2010; Lau &\nMarsee, 2013). With regard to bullying, psychopathy is the\none dark trait most strongly related to bullying, followed by\nMachiavellianism and narcissism (Baughman, Dearing,\nGiammarco, & Vernon, 2012). It is important to point out that\nbully/victims score significantly higher than non-bully/non-\nvictims on psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism\n(Linton & Power, 2013). The Dark triad is positively corre-\nlated with out-group threat perceptions, anti-immigrant\n4 SAGE Open\nprejudice (Hodson, Hogg, & McInnes, 2009), and different\nformsofracism(Jones,2013).HighlevelsofMachiavellianism\npredict modern racism (i.e., specific types of inequality rather\nthan negative responses to minorities in general), whereas\nhigh levels of psychopathy predict old-fashioned racism\n(embedded in opposition of any form of racial equality). In\nsum, the three dark traits seem to share a non-cooperative\ncore, but with different nuances of non-cooperative behavior.\nThis suggests a one global trait structure (i.e., unification\nargument) rather than a ternary structure (i.e., uniqueness\nargument). In this context, researchers have turned to one of\nthe most common and reliable model of personality, the Big\nFive, to discern differences and similarities between individu-\nals who express these malevolent traits.\nA Dyad of Personality Models: The\nDark Triad and the Big Five Model\nAs it could be expected, individuals who score high in any of\nthe three Dark Triad traits score low in agreeableness as well.\nIndividuals who score high in psychopathy and narcissism\nscore also high on extraversion and openness. Those high in\nMachiavellianism and psychopathy score low in conscien-\ntiousness, while individuals high in psychopathy also score\nlow in neuroticism (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). As with the\nrelationships within the triad, relationships between the triad\nand the Big Five traits have been replicated in some studies\n(Lee & Ashton, 2005) but not in others (Jakobwitz & Egan,\n2006). Yet other studies report correlations between each of\nthe Dark Triad traits and several of the Big Five traits, for\nexample, high psychopathy with low agreeableness and low\nconscientiousness, and high narcissism with high extraver-\nsion, high openness, and low agreeableness (Vernon et al.,\n2008). Thus, even if there are some correlations between the\nDark Triad and the Big Five, these are neither large nor consis-\ntent and this indicates that the two models represent overlap-\nping but distinct clusters of personality (Vernon et al., 2008).\nThe most consistent finding is that individuals who\nexpress high levels in any of the Dark Triad traits also score\nlow in agreeableness (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006; Jonason &\n2002). Importantly, agreeableness is positively related to the\ncharacter trait of cooperativeness in Cloninger's model (De\nthe Dark Triad as one global construct (i.e., the sum of all\nthree traits) is related to low levels of agreeableness, high\nlevels of extraversion, high levels of openness, low levels of\nneuroticism, and low levels of conscientiousness, the only\ncommon correlate for each unique dark trait is low levels of\nagreeableness (Jonason et al., 2010). This does, as discussed\nearlier, suggest a common uncooperative core for the three\ndark traits (i.e., unification argument).\nIndividuals who are agreeable are described as interested in\nsocialharmony,whereasthosewhoaredisagreeablearedescribed\nas antisocial, autocratic, selfish, stubborn, demanding, head-\nstrong,impatient,intolerant,outspoken,hard-hearted,argumenta-\ntive, and aggressive (cf. low cooperativeness; Cloninger, 2004).\nHence, it is clear why individuals with high levels in any of the\ndark traits always score lowest in agreeableness and are less likely\nto help other people (Furnham et al., 2013; Jonason, Li, & Buss,\nthe core trait contributing to prosocial behavior (Aghababaei,\nWasserman, & Nannini, 2014; Carlo, Okun, Knight, & de\nson high in the Dark Triad traits is predominantly disagreeable,\nshe or he is also low in conscientiousness, stable, and extravert\n(Furnham, Richard, Rangel, & Jones, 2014).\nThe Present Study\nThe aim of this study was to investigate differences between\naffective profiles in the Dark Triad traits. To the best of our\nknowledge, no other studies have investigated these differ-\nences. We expect this to expand the research on differences in\npersonality between affective profiles because the Dark Triad\ntraits are suggested to expand the Big Five personality model\n(Veselka et al., 2012), which is one of the personality models\nalready studied using the affective profiles model. Research\non the Dark Triad has a fairly detailed picture of which of the\nBig Five personality traits help to discern diferences (i.e.,\nuniqueness argument) and commonalities (i.e., unification\nargument) among the Dark Triad traits. This is, however, not\nthe case for Cloninger's model of personality, which has\nalready been used to discern differences in personality\nbetween affective profiles. Hence, using the affective profiles\nmodel as the framework for differences in malevolent tenden-\ncies, in conjunction with earlier discerned personality differ-\nences among profiles, might contribute to the debate of the\nDark Triad as one global trait (i.e., unification argument) or\nthree distinctive traits (i.e., uniqueness argument).\nIn the context of affectivity, psychopathy seems to be\nassociated with high levels of negative affect (Love &\nHolder, 2014), which is a marker for neuroticism and harm\navoidance. In contrast, psychopathy is associated with low\nlevels of positive affect (Love & Holder, 2014), which is a\nmarker for low levels of extraversion and self-directedness.\nThus, suggesting that individuals with a self-destructive\nprofile (low positive affect/high negative affect) can be\nexpected to be high in psychopathy. In this line, individuals\nwith a self-fulfilling profile (high positive affect, low nega-\ntive affect) have been depicted as more cooperative and tol-\nerant to others, more stable, and conscious, whereas\nindividuals with a high negative affect profile (i.e., high\naffective and self-destructive) are depicted as less agree-\nings suggest that individuals with a high affective or a\nself-destructive profile should score higher in the Dark\nTriad traits. Nevertheless, one obvious difference between\nGarcia et al. 5\nindividuals with a high affective and those with a self-\ndestructive profile is that individuals with a high affective\nprofile experience high positive affect, which is positively\nrelated to extraversion (see, for example, Garcia's [2012]\nstudy, in which individuals with a high affective profile\nscore higher in extraversion compared with individuals\nwith a self-destructive profile). Extraversion is, for instance,\npositively related to narcissism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams,\nviduals with a high affective and a self-destructive profile\nto be higher in both psychopathy and Machiavellianism\ncompared with individuals with a self-fulfilling or a low\naffective profile, but this two high negative affect profiles\n(i.e., self-destructive and high affective) were expected\nto differ in narcissism--the individuals with a high affec-\ntive profile being the ones expected to score higher in\nnarcissism.\nMethod\nEthics Statement\nThe review board of the Network for Empowerment and\nWell-Being approved the research protocol, which was found\nto comply with the law concerning research involving humans\nand requiring only informed consent from the participants.\nParticipants, workers from the crowdsourcing platform\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), provided their consent\nby simply accepting the task (or HIT as it is called in MTurk)\nand then answering the survey. This acceptance is recorded\nelectronically together with the participants' answers.\nParticipants and Procedure\nmales and 333 females) were recruited through MTurk\n(https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). MTurk allows\ndata collectors to recruit participants (workers) online for\ncompleting different tasks in exchange for wages. This\nmethod for data collection online has become more common\nduring recent years and it is an empirical tested valid tool for\nconducting research in the social sciences (see Buhrmester,\nKwang, & Gosling, 2011). Participants were recruited by the\nfollowing criteria: being U.S. resident and being able to\nspeak and read fluent in English. Participants were paid a\nwage of .20 cents of American dollars for completing the\ntask and informed that the study was anonymous and volun-\ntary. The participants were presented with a battery of self-\nreports comprising the affect and Dark Triad measures, as\nwell as demographic questions (e.g., age, sex). We included\ntwo validity check items to control for random responding\n(\"In this question, please answer either agree or disagree\"). A\nfrom the final analysis because they answered erroneously to\none or both validity check items.\nInstruments\nPositive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule.The instrument\n(Watson et al., 1988) instructs participants to rate to what\nextent they generally have experienced 20 different feelings\nor emotions (10 positive affect and 10 negative affect) during\nthe last weeks, using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = very\nslightly, 5 = extremely). The 10-item positive affect scale\nincludes adjectives such as strong, proud, and interested. The\n10-item negative affect scale includes adjectives such as\nafraid, ashamed, and nervous. We averaged together the\nresponses to each item to create an index of each scale.\nThe DarkTriad Dirty Dozen. The instrument (Jonason & Web-\nnot at all; 7 = very much), four for each Dark Triad trait:\npsychopathy (e.g., \"I tend to lack remorse\"), Machiavellian-\nism (e.g., \"I have used deceit or lied to get my way\"), and\nnarcissism (e.g., \"I tend to want others to admire me\"). We\naveraged together the responses to each item to create an\nindex of each trait.\nStatistical Treatment\nParticipants'positive and negative affect scores were divided\ninto high and low using the median as reference and then\ncombined to create the four affective profiles (cutoff points\nin the present study: high positive affect = 3.20 or above; low\npositive affect = 3.10 or less, or above; high negative\naffect = 1.90 or above; low negative affect = 1.80 or less).\nThis resulted in 281 individuals with a self-fulfilling profile,\nprofile, and 305 individuals with a self-destructive profile.\nThe distribution of the participants over the profiles showed\nthat the number of individuals in the low affective and high\naffective profiles were about the same. Similarly, about the\nsame number of participants was allocated to the self-\ndestructive and self-fulfilling profiles (see Table 1). A\nShapiro\u00adWilkes test for normality showed that the affective\nprofiles scores on the Dark Triad, except for high affective\nindividual's scores on Machiavellianism, deviated from the\nnormal distribution. Nevertheless, the Central Limit Theorem\nsuggests that, with sufficiently large sample sizes, it is plau-\nsible to assume that sampling distributions of means are nor-\nmally distributed regardless of the distributions of the\nvariables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Moreover, there were\nno significant results on Levene's test for homogeneity of\nvariance with the profiles as the independent variable.\nTo check for the validity of the profiling of the partici-\npants, we contacted an independent researcher who has\nworked with k-means analyses as the method for the person-\noriented approach on individual differences. Our data were\nsubmitted to this analysis. Specifically, Ward's hierarchical\ncluster analysis was used to divide the sample into four\ngroups, and k-means cluster analysis used the starting points\n6 SAGE Open\nfrom this analysis to investigate whether individuals actually\nended up in a group most similar to their affective profile.\nThe weighed mean of clusters homogeneity coefficient was\n.73. Suggesting a good model fit and that the participants in\nthe present study were categorized in four profiles using their\ncombination of self-reported affect (S. MacDonald, personal\ncommunication on January the 2nd, 2015). Part of the data in\nthe present study was used in a study in which we address\nmethodological questions regarding the median split and\ncluster approaches (see Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer,\nResults\nPearsoncorrelationsbetweenpsychopathy,Machiavellianism,\nand narcissism were positive and significant showing moder-\nate correlations for Machiavellianism and psychopathy (r =\nNegative affect was positively and significantly related to\np < .001).

Table 2 shows the correlations,\nmeans and standard deviations (SD), and Cronbach's  for all\nvariables in the present study.\nA multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was cal-\nculated with affective profiles and sex as the independent\nvariables and the Dark Triad traits as the dependent variables.\nTable 3 shows the means and standard deviations (\u00b1) for the\ndifferent profiles and across sex. There was a significant main\neffect of the affective profiles on the Dark Triad traits,\n2 = .02. A post hoc test using Bonferroni correction to the\nalpha level showed that individuals with a self-destructive\n1.37) profile scored higher on psychopathy compared with\nindividuals with a self-fulfilling profile (M = 2.49, SD = 1.20).\nThe affective profiles differed in Machiavellianism as well,\nBonferroni correction to the alpha level showed that individu-\nindividuals with a self-destructive profile (M = 3.54, SD =\n1.30) scored higher on Machiavellianism compared with indi-\nviduals with a low affective profile (M = 3.14, SD = 0.97) and\nindividuals with a self-fulfilling profile (M = 3.15, SD = 1.34).\nFurthermore, the profiles also differed in narcissism,\nBonferroni correction to the alpha level showed that individu-\nals with a high affective profile (M = 4.25, SD = 1.27) scored\nhigher on narcissism compared with individuals with a self-\ndestructive profile (M = 3.88, SD = 1.26) and individuals with\na self-fulfilling profile (M = 3.77, SD = 1.38). Individuals\nwith a low affective profile scored lower on narcissism (M =\n3.43, SD = 1.29) compared with all profiles but the self-ful-\nfilling. For a summary of the differences, see also Figure 1.\nThere was a main effect of sex on Dark Triad traits,\n1.32). There were no significant mean differences between\nthe sexes with regard to narcissism (men: M = 3.88, SD =\ncant interaction effects between affective profiles and sex.\nDiscussion\nThe research on affective profiles has a 10-year long history,\nwhile the number of studies on the Dark Triad has increased\nfast during the last years. To expand earlier findings that show\ndifferences in personality traits between individuals with dif-\nferent affective profiles, were we interested in differences\nbetween profiles in the Dark Triad traits. The Dark Triad traits\nshow, for instance, significant phenotypic, genetic, and envi-\nronmental correlations to measures of personality traits that\nare distinct to those measured in the Big Five model (Veselka\net al., 2012), thus, making these dark traits non-explored ter-\nritory in the context of the affective profiles model. Moreover,\nif individuals with different affective profiles varied in their\nDark Triad traits, this was expected to shed some light into the\ndebate of unification versus uniqueness of these malevolent\ntraits. After all, individuals with different affective profiles\nhave shown variance in personality traits commonly (i.e., the\nBig Five model) and non-earlier (i.e., Cloninger's psychobio-\nlogical model) used to investigate associations to the dark\ntrait. The most important findings were that (a) individuals\nwith a high affective profile reported higher degree of narcis-\nsism than individuals with any of the other profiles, and they\nalso reported higher levels of Machiavellianism and psychop-\nathy than individuals with a low affective or a self-fulfilling\nTable 1. Sex Distribution Among Affective Profiles.\nAffective profile Male % (n) Female % (n) Total % (n)\nGarcia et al. 7\nprofile and that (b) individuals with a self-destructive profile\nalso were higher on Machiavellianism and psychopathy com-\npared with individuals with a low affective or a self-fulfilling\nprofile. For a summary of the differences in the present study,\nsee Figure 1.\nEarlier findings show that individuals with a self-fulfilling\nor a high affective profile share high levels of agentic traits,\nsuch as self-directedness (i.e., goal-directedness, self-accep-\ntance, etcetera) and persistence (i.e., a personality trait\ndescribing an individual who is perfectionist and hard work-\npresent results, however, show that despite the fact that indi-\nviduals with any of these two profiles might be defined as\nhigh in agentic traits, individuals with a self-fulfilling profile\nscored lower in the Dark Triad traits, while individuals with a\nhigh affective profile scored high in these malevolent traits.\nThat is, high levels in the malevolent triad are associated with\npositive affect when negative affect is high (see Figure 1). In\nthis context, earlier results show that, compared with the other\nprofiles, including the high affective, the self-fulfilling scores\nthe highest in communal traits (i.e., cooperativeness); traits\nthat comprise tolerance toward others and empathic and help-\nful behavior (Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2). Accordingly, indi-\nviduals who score high in levels of each of the Dark Triad\ntraits share also high levels of agency and low levels of com-\nNevertheless, others have suggested that it is not correct\nto dismiss the Dark Triad as simply low in communal traits\n(e.g., agreeableness, cooperativeness)--a person high in the\nDark Triad traits is predominantly disagreeable, but also an\nextravert (Furnham et al., 2014). Indeed, individuals with a\nhigh affective profile, compared with those with a low posi-\ntive affect profile (i.e., low affective and self-destructive),\nare high in extraversion (Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2).\nNevertheless, individuals with a high affective profile have\nbeen found to be high in neuroticism, as those with a self-\ndestructive profile, but low in harm avoidance, as those indi-\nviduals with a self-fulfilling profile. In other words, all these\nthree profiles (i.e., high affective, low affective, and self-\ndestructive; see Figure 2) are rather emotionally unstable\ncompared with the self-fulfilling profile (Garcia, 2012).\nHowever, individuals with a high affective profile show, at\nthe same time, a tendency to be fearless, carefree, coura-\ngeous, energetic, outgoing, and optimistic even in situations\nthat worry most people (i.e., low harm avoidance).\nPsychopathy is, indeed, negatively associated with harm\navoidance (Fowles & Dindo, 2006). In other words, individ-\nuals with a high affective profile seem to be high in agentic\ntraits (i.e., self-directedness, persistence, extraversion), low\nin communal traits (i.e., cooperativeness, agreeableness),\nhigh in the dark traits (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism,\nnarcissism), and low in harm avoidance, but high in neuroti-\ncism. In contrast, individuals with a self-destructive profile\nare low in agentic traits, low in communal traits, and high in\ndark traits, but high in both harm avoidance and neuroticism\n(see Figure 2).\nNevertheless, our finding linking psychopathy to the self-\ndestructive profile, a profile in turn linked to high neurotic\nTable 3.

Psychopathy has after all been found to correlate\nnegatively to neuroticism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams, 2002)\nand negative affect (Love & Holder, 2014), which is almost\nsynonymous with neuroticism (e.g., Tellegen, 1993; Watson\net al., 1988). Nevertheless, some studies have not replicated\nthe link high psychopathy-low neuroticism (Veselka et al.,\n2012). The findings presented here, however, suggest that\nboth high and low neuroticism (emotional stability being the\nopposite end of neuroticism) might be found in individuals\nhigh in psychopathy, hence suggesting the probability of\nboth a emotionally stable (tentatively high in affectivity:\nhigh affective) and a emotionally instable psychopath (tenta-\ntively low in positive affect and high in negative affect: self-\ndestructive). Importantly, psychopathy was only higher when\nprofiles at one extreme end of the model where compared\n(i.e., self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling, see Figure 1) or\nwithin profiles high in positive affect that vary in negative\naffect (high affective vs. self-fulfilling, see Figure 1). Hence,\npsychopathy does not seem to be higher within profiles low\nin positive affect that vary in their negative affect levels\n(self-destructive vs. low affective, see Figure 1), within pro-\nfiles with high negative affect that vary in their positive\naffect levels (self-destructive vs. high affective, Figure 1), or\nwithin profiles with low negative affect that vary in their\npositive affect levels (low affective vs. self-fulfilling, Figure\n1). Furthermore, Machiavellianism differed between profiles\nat both extreme ends of the model (high affective vs. low\naffective and self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling, Figure 1),\nbut also within profiles low in positive affect that vary in\ntheir levels of negative affect (self-destructive vs. low affec-\ntive, see Figure 1) and within profiles high in positive affect\nthat vary in their levels of negative affect (high affective vs.\nself-fulfilling, see Figure 1).\nMoreover, individuals with a high affective profile scored\nhigher in narcissism compared with all profiles, even com-\npared with individuals with a self-destructive profile. This\nwas expected because individuals with a high affective pro-\nfile score higher in extraversion compared with individuals\nwith a self-destructive profile--extraversion is after all posi-\ntively related to narcissism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams, 2002;\nVernon et al., 2008). The matched comparisons, however,\nFigure 1. Differences found between individuals with affective profiles that are at their extremes: self-destructive versus self-fulfilling\n(low-high positive affect, high-low negative affect) and low affective versus high affective (low-high positive affect, low-high negative\naffect). Differences found when individuals were matched in one affective dimension, and differed in the other (i.e., within differences):\nself-destructive versus high affective (matching: high-high negative affect, differing: low-high positive affect), self-destructive versus low\naffective (matching: low-low positive affect, differing: high-low negative affect), high affective versus self-fulfilling (matching: high-high\npositive affect, differing: high-low negative affect), and low affective versus self-fulfilling (matching: low-low negative affect, differing: low-\nhigh positive affect).\nNote.

Moreover, in relation to earlier research, individu-\nals high in narcissism stand apart by being high in self-\nwhich is in turn associated with extrinsic spiritual behavior\n(Sedikides & Gebauer, 2010). Extrinsic spiritual behavior is\nadopted as a means to an end (Allport & Ross, 1967). In this\ncontext, individuals with a high affective profile score high\nin spiritual traits (i.e., self-transcendence) compared with\nindividuals with a low affective and self-destructive profile\n(Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2). Nevertheless, only individuals\nwith a self-fulfilling profile report seeking support in faith\n(Sch\u00fctz, Sailer, et al., 2013). We argue that this suggests that\nindividuals with a high affective profile have a more means\nto an end approach to their spirituality/self-transcendence.\nThe high affective profile is for instance depicted using\nCloninger's model of personality, as high in self-directed-\nness, low in cooperativeness, and high in self-transcendence\ncific character combination as \"fanatical\" (e.g., Cloninger &\nZohar, 2011). Individuals with this character combination\nare prone to depression but also paranoid (Cloninger, 2004;\nJosefsson, Merjonen, Jokela, Pulkki-R\u00e5back, & Keltikangas-\nJ\u00e4rvinen, 2011). That is, our findings suggest that narcissism\nshould be associated with these types of disorders.\nNevertheless, this is a question for future research that should\ninclude measures of character and the Dark Triad traits along\nthe affective profile model.\nFinally, we found that men scored higher in psychopathy\nand slightly higher in Machiavellianism compared with\nwomen. This is accordingly to earlier research showing that\nmen score higher than women in all three Dark Triad traits\nFigure 2. Summary of the personality trait differences between affective profiles in the present and other studies (e.g., Garcia, 2012;\nGarcia, Kerekes, Andersson-Arnt\u00e9n, & Archer, 2012).\nNote. The black ring points to traits that are shared by individuals with high levels of psychopathy and Machiavellianism in the present study. Reprinted\nwith permission from Well-Being and Human Performance Sweden AB.\nWebster, 2010). However, narcissism did not differed\nbetween men and women in the present study and the differ-\nences in Machiavellianism were rather small. This is, none-\ntheless, also in line with other studies (Jones & Paulhus,\nthose findings suggesting positive correlations between\nMachiavellianism and psychopathy (Paulhus & Williams,\n2002) and correlations between Machiavellianism and nar-\ncissism (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006). This last finding is, how-\never, contradictory to that from other studies (e.g., Paulhus &\nLimitations and Strengths of the Present Study\nIt is plausible to point out some potential issues with the\nchoice of using MTurk to gather the data: for example, work-\ners' attention levels, cross-talk between participants, and the\nfact that participants get remuneration for their answers\n(Buhrmester et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a large quantity of\nstudies show that data on personality scales collected through\nMTurk meet academic standards and it is demographically\ndiverse (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Horton, Rand, &\nMoreover, data on health measures collected through MTurk\nshow satisfactory internal as well as test\u00adretest reliability\n(Shapiro, Chandler, & Mueller, 2013). In addition, the\namount of payment does not seem to affect data quality,\nremuneration is usually small, and workers report being\nintrinsically motivated (e.g., for enjoyment) to take part in\nWith regard to the Dark Triad measure used here (i.e.,\nDark Triad Dirty Dozen; Jonason & Webster, 2010), it is\nimportant to point out that while some researchers find it as\nan appropriate measure of these malevolent traits, others\nhave criticized its validity (e.g., Lee et al., 2012; Miller &\nJonason and Webster's (2010) Dirty Dozen only comprises\n12 items (four for each trait), while other measures, such as,\nitems (seven for each trait). For instance, the Dark Triad\nDirty Dozen has demonstrated less predictive power (e.g.,\nmeasure developed by Jones and Paulhus (2014; the Short\nDark Triad). In addition, although we opted to use a 7-point\nLikert-type scale, as in Jonason and Lu\u00e9vano's (2013) study,\nsome studies have used a 5-point Likert-type scale (e.g.,\nJonason, Li, & Czarna, 2013; Jonason, Slomski, & Partyka,\n2012) or a 9-point Likert-type scale (e.g., Jonason & Webster,\n2010). Hence, it is difficult to compare samples and our find-\nings need to be replicated using more reliable measures of\nthe Dark Triad.\nFinally, the allocation of the participants to different pro-\nfiles using median splits has some methodological problems\n(Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer, 2015). For instance, median\nsplits distort the meaning of high and low because scores\njust-above and just-below the median become high and low\nby fiat, not by reality (Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer, 2015;\nSch\u00fctz, Archer, & Garcia, 2013). To avoid this problem,\nsome studies have used larger samples as reference to create\nthe profiles of smaller samples (e.g., Rapp Ricciardi et al.,\n2014), others have opted to use the cutoff points found in the\noriginal study (i.e., Norlander et al., 2002), and yet others\nhave used aged-based cutoff points (e.g., Garcia, 2011).\nNevertheless, using more sophisticated approaches (e.g.,\nk-means cluster analysis) to allocate individuals in profiles,\nbased on self-reported affect, also arrives to a four profiles\nsolution as theorized by Archer (e.g., Garcia, MacDonald, &\nalso the case for the sample used here. To the best of our\nknowledge, no study has established which of the methods\n(median split vs. cluster analysis) construe the profiles more\nstatistically accurate or has analyzed whether there are dif-\nferences in the results depending on the approach being used.\nImportantly, the categorization is based on the theoretical\nframework of the affective system as being composed of\nindependent dimensions. Hence, the affective profiles model\ngoes beyond the view of affect as two separate systems and\ntakes into account the interaction of both dispositions and\nalso observations of two-system theories suggesting that,\nwhen using dichotomous features, combinations must be\nruled out (for a point of view on two-system theories, see\nthere are differences between individuals in positive and/or\nnegative affect, these two components of the affective sys-\ntem exist within each individual. On the basis of this inde-\npendent coexistence of self-regulation (i.e., approach\nbehavior vs. avoidance behavior), it is plausible to assume\nthat there exist differences within the individual as well--\nsome experiencing high positive affect but low negative\naffect or any combination in-between.\nOur findings using the affective profile model suggest\nthat the description of an individual high in the Dark Triad\ntraits is complex and that, as suggested by Furnham and col-\nleagues (2013), studies comparing the dark traits with other\npersonality traits might need to investigate differences at the\nsubscale level. For instance, individuals with a high affective\nprofile have scored lower than individuals with a self-fulfill-\ning profile in the agentic trait of autonomy (Garcia et al.,\n2014). In other words, although both the self-fulfilling and\nthe high affective are high in agentic traits, such as, self-\ndirectedness they might differ in aspects of self-directedness\ndescribing self-discipline and self-control, which are nega-\ntively associated with the Dark Triad traits (Jonason & Tost,\nConclusion and Final Remarks\nIn sum, the affective profiles model allows the comparison\nbetween individuals taking into account the different combi-\nnations of individuals' affective experience. The strength of\nthe model is that comparisons take into consideration that\nindividuals can be diametrically different (low affective vs.\nhigh affective and self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling) or equal\nin one aspect of their affective experience and at the same\ntime different in the other (i.e., high affective vs. self-fulfill-\ning, low affective vs. self-fulfilling, self-destructive vs. low\naffective, and self-destructive vs. high affective; see Figure\n1). In light of the results presented here, some suggestions\nand predictions are warranted in regard to the unification\nversus uniqueness Dark Triad traits'debate. First, we suggest\nthat narcissism is uniquely different from the other three dark\ntraits because it is the only dark trait to be associated with\nhigh positive affect when negative affectivity is high (self-\ndestructive vs. high affective). A direct translation of the\nfindings to other models of personality could be that, while\nnarcissism shares low levels of agreeable and cooperative\nbehavior with the other dark traits, narcissism is positively\nrelated to extrovert behavior (e.g., high positive affect,\nsocializing) only when the individual is also high in neurotic\nbehavior (e.g., high negative affect, emotionally unstable).\nThis is accordingly to the description of a narcissistic person-\nality as involving a grandiose yet fragile sense of the self\nAt a first look, psychopathy and Machiavellianism seem to\nmostly be associated with negative affect, both the high affec-\ntive and self-destructed profiles scored high in these malevo-\nlent traits. However, Machiavellianism was associated with\nhigh levels of negative affect when positive affect was high\n(high affective vs. self-fulfilling, Figure 1) and low (self-\ndestructive vs. low affective, Figure 1) or when profiles at\nboth extreme ends of the model were compared. Psychopathy\non the other hand was associated with high negative affect\nonly in two instances: when profiles at one extreme end of the\nmodel were compared (self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling) and\nwhen positive affect was high (high affective vs. self-fulfill-\ning, Figure 1). In other words, while Machiavellianism is gen-\nerally associated with high levels of negative affect,\npsychopathy has a unique association with high negative\naffect only when positive affect is high at the same time. This\nalso suggests that psychopathy should be positively related to\nextrovert behavior (e.g., high positive affect, socializing) only\nwhen the individual is high in neurotic behavior (e.g., high\nnegative affect, emotional stable). But psychopathy should\nalso be positively related to the opposite of extrovert behav-\nior, that is, introvert behavior (e.g., low positive affect, being\nreserved and a loner), under the same premises (i.e., high in\nneurotic behavior). At the end, however, psychopathy and\nMachiavellianism seem to have more similarities than differ-\nences, at least when it comes to affectivity (see Figure 1).\nThus, our study suggests that there are two unique traits in the\ntriad, narcissism being one of them, because it is uniquely\nassociated with positive affect when negative affect is high.\nThe other is probably a global antisocial trait composed of\npsychopathy and Machiavellianism that is related to negative\naffect in general.\nOur results suggest that individuals who score high in\nthe Dark Triad traits might have lesser of the attributes\nlinked to the self-fulfilling profile: agency (i.e., self-accep-\ntance, autonomy, goal-directedness), communion (i.e.,\ncooperation, helpfulness, empathy), and intrinsic spiritual-\nity (i.e., seeking support from faith). These attributes\ntogether form a creative character and are all necessary for\nfeeling good (i.e., happiness), doing good (i.e., mature and\nactively virtuous living), physical health (i.e., absence of\ndisease or infirmity), and prosperity (i.e., success, good for-\ntune, and flourishing) (see also Falhgren, Nima, Archer, &\nGarcia, 2015). In contrast to individuals with a high affec-\ntive profile and who are also high in some agentic and some\nspiritual traits, individuals with a self-fulfilling profile are\nnot self-centered, manipulative, or malevolent. For instance,\nself-fulfilling individuals with a creative character, such as,\nMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King (Cloninger,\n2004), have imposed important changes for humanity\nusing, for example, civil disobedience (Thoreau, 2009).\nThis behavior has led their oppressors to see them as vil-\nlains. The difference between a hero and a villain might be\nthat the hero pursue communal values in an agentic and\nspiritual manner, while the villain is all about agency and\nmanipulation of communal and spiritual values (for recent\nresearch on the difference between agentic/communal val-\nues and agentic/communal traits showing important effects\nIn the end, my kingdom was united not by a hero or a villain, as\nlegend had predicted, but by one who was both hero and villain.\nAnd her name was Maleficent.
